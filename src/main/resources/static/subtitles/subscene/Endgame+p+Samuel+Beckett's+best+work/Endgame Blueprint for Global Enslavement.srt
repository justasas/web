1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,520
Countless people will hate
the New World Order -

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,420
and will die protesting against it.

3
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,700
I appeared before the Congressional Committee -

4
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,800
to tell what I knew of activities -

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,400
which might lead to an attempt
to set up a fascist dictatorship.

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,410
The potential for the disastrous rise
of misplaced power exists and will persist.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,730
The very word 'secrecy' is repugnant
in a free and open society -

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,300
and we are as a people,
inherently and historically -

9
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,640
opposed to secret societies, -

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,730
to secret oaths and
to secret proceedings.

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,700
President Bush signed
a formal agreement -

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,860
that will end the Unites
States as we know it -

13
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:01,570
and he took the step without
approval from either -

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,140
the U.S. Congress or the
people of the United States.

15
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,210
The secret organizations of the world
power elite are no longer secret.

16
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,680
It's known as the Bilderberg Group.

17
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,980
Could their objective be world domination?

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,940
I'm Jim Tucker. I've chased
Bilderberg for 30 years.

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,420
I'll never give up the chase.

20
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:32,160
The Bilderberg plan for the whole world
is nothing less than World Government.

21
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,600
I'm not comfortable with that at all.
Who elected these guys to run the planet?

22
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,050
They are the elitists.

23
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:44,610
They feel they should run the world
for their own selfish interests.

24
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,800
Now we can see a new
world coming into view.

25
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,120
A world in which there is a very real
prospect of a New World Order.

26
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,460
Bilderberg is making great progress
toward a World Government -

27
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,510
and only an educated and informed
public can stop them in their tracks.

28
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,680
David Rockefeller admits in his own memoirs
that he wants to destroy the United States.

29
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,080
He's a traitor!

30
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,950
It's good to be back at the
Council on Foreign Relations.

31
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,120
As Pete mentioned, I've been
a member for a long time -

32
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,190
and was actually a director
for some period of time.

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,330
I never mentioned that while campaigning
for reelection back home in Wyoming.

34
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,670
Let us never tolerate outrageous
conspiracy theories...

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,380
I need you to move off
the property please.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,650
Some shots were fired...

37
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,820
There's Bilderbergers right there.

38
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,230
The Trans-Texas Corridor is a
vital part, because if we stop it -

39
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,300
we stop the New World Order
right here in Texas.

40
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,230
This thing started here -

41
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:04,270
and to save this country,
we kill this damn thing here.

42
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,990
There is a chance for the
President of the United States -

43
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,760
to carry out a phrase
his father used, -

44
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,160
and that is a
New World Order.

45
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,100
Your New World Order will fall.
Humanity will defeat you.

46
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,510
The answer to
1984 is 1776.

47
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,610
Alex Jones Presents -

48
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:55,820
ENDGAME
- Blueprint for Global Enslavement

49
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,830
In the near future earth is dominated
by a powerful world government.

50
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,670
Once free nations are slaves
to the will of a tiny elite.

51
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,810
The dawn of a new dark
age is upon mankind.

52
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:21,680
Countries are a thing of the past. Every
form of independence is under attack -

53
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,450
with the family and even the
individual itself nearing extinction.

54
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,590
Close to 80% of the earth's
population has been eliminated.

55
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,230
The remnants of a once free
humanity are forced to live -

56
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,070
within highly controlled
compact prison-like cities.

57
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:47,080
Travel is highly restricted. Superhighways
connect the mega cities and keep the -

58
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,880
population from entering
into unauthorized zones.

59
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,880
No human activity is private.

60
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,850
A.I. supercomputers chronicle
and categorize every action.

61
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,090
A Prison Planet dominated by a
ruthless gang of control freaks -

62
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,560
who's power can
never be challenged.

63
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,260
This is the vision of the
global elite: their goal.

64
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,570
A program of total dehumanization
where the science of tyranny is law.

65
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,610
A world-wide control grid -

66
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,680
designed to ensure the overlord's
monopoly of power forever.

67
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,180
Our species will be condemned
to this nightmare future -

68
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,780
unless the masses
are awakened

69
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,590
to the New World Order Master Plan
and mobilized to defeat it.

70
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,030
Erected by a secretive group,
the Georgia Guidestones -

71
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,730
are a testament to the elite's
plan for a world religion, -

72
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,630
global laws, with a global court
and army to enforce it.

73
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,100
And set in stone it is written
that the population -

74
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,710
never rise above 500 million.

75
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,020
In this film you will learn how
our world is truly governed.

76
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,750
You will see how highly secretive
round-table groups interlock -

77
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,490
to form a global
intelligence network.

78
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,100
This group has been steering planetary
affairs for hundreds of years.

79
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,850
Now in the final stage, they prepare
for open world government; -

80
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,440
a goal tyrants throughout
history have lusted after.

81
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,430
Dr. Michael Coffman is a published ecologist
specializing in Ecosystem Research, -

82
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,150
Forest Ecology and Ecosystem Classification.

83
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,550
Dr. Coffman played a key role
in blocking the ratification -

84
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,760
of the Convention on Biological
Diversity in the U.S. Senate.

85
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,990
The concept of a New World Order
has been around for centuries, -

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,670
it's been receiving tremendous play
over the last half of the 20th century.

87
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,100
George Bush senior, President George
Bush used it a lot in his speeches -

88
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,280
and really implies that he really
wants to see an Order -

89
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,640
in which we have a universal
or global type of governance, -

90
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,620
in which every human being on planet
Earth is ultimately responsible -

91
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,020
to the policies that are being
formulated at the international level.

92
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,630
It is a big idea.
A New World Order.

93
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,130
President Bush said that the
New World Order was in tune -

94
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,070
and that's what they were working for.
The U.N. is part of that government.

95
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,870
They're working right now, very significantly,
for a North American Union.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,140
That's why a lot of people in Washington
don't care too much about our borders.

97
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,010
They have a philosophic belief that
national sovereignty is not important.

98
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,120
It's also the reason I have
made very strong suggestion -

99
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,520
that we need not be in the United
Nations for our national security.

100
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,490
It's really always the same,
you go back throughout all of history, -

101
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,930
the Roman Empire, The Soviet Union,
Hitler during the Nazism, -

102
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,600
it was always saying that it is going to
create the utopia for the average person, -

103
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,640
when in fact, history always shows
that it does exactly the opposite.

104
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,530
Ancient Roots of
Globalism -

105
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,450
Conquest and Empire is as old as civilisation.

106
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,880
Babylon, Egypt and Greece, -

107
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,220
They all built empires in an
attempt to rule the world.

108
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,660
The Roman system at it's peak
dominated the known world.

109
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,900
Complex governmental systems were
developed to control diverse populations.

110
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,600
During the period between
the 15th and 19th century,

111
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:37,040
new empires emerged and again
waged war for supremacy.

112
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,140
The nobility as well as the
thriving merchant class -

113
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,550
were financed by a handful
of private banks.

114
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,250
Many of the great money houses would hedge
their bets and finance both sides of a war.

115
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,590
Sophisticated intelligence gathering
networks gave the financiers a clear edge -

116
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,200
over the governments they were
slowly gaining control of.

117
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,200
On the 18th of June 1815 -

118
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,200
agents of the British arm of the
Rothschild family looked on -

119
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,580
as Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte fought
desperately to save his army -

120
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,110
from the jaws of a British
Pression Pincer Attack.

121
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,480
A Rothschild agent was able to get
the news of Napoleon's defeat, -

122
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,360
at the hands of Lord Wellington,
and to Nathan Rothschild -

123
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,630
a full 20 hours before the
news reached London.

124
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,300
Nathan, the head of the British
arm of the Rothschild family, -

125
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:42,250
put out the rumor to the London Stock
Exchange that Napoleon had won the war.

126
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,940
Stocks plunged by 98% and
Rothschild was then able to -

127
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:53,410
buy up the entire British economy
for pennies on the pound.

128
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,040
When the news of Napoleon's defeat
finally arrived, stocks soared.

129
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,750
Britain was now the undisputed ruler of
Europe and Rothschild ruled England.

130
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,090
The already dominant empire
grew even more aggressive.

131
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,000
Her troops and bureaucracies
spread across the globe.

132
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,260
The sun never set on
Britannia's holdings.

133
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,870
The banking cartel funded...
in fact since about 1800 -

134
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,540
they have funded both sides
of almost every war, -

135
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,270
and of course they're getting the
interest off of the loans that they'd -

136
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,710
given the governments for the wars
that they helped stimulate and create.

137
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:48,990
By 1900, Germany was a rising force,
and a leader of the industrial revolution.

138
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,990
World War I for instance, -

139
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,460
there was absolutely no reason
to have World War I, -

140
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,030
except that  it was an ideal
opportunity for the banking cartel -

141
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,970
to make a pile of money by funding
both sides of that particular war.

142
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,210
On June 28th 1914, the heir to
the Austro-Hungarian throne -

143
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,410
Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated
while traveling in a motorcade.

144
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:25,460
The Black Hand, a Serbian Secret
Society with connections to French -

145
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,290
and British Intelligence, took credit.

146
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,060
World war I had begun.

147
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,020
Armaments Companies financed
by Rothschild controlled banks -

148
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:58,360
in Germany, France, England and
Austria bankrolled all the factions.

149
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,530
At least 20 million were
killed in the war.

150
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:15,170
It was a conflict so terrible, the
people vowed to never fight again.

151
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,740
They'd dubbed it
"The War To End All Wars".

152
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,020
The question is,
"Why did they want war?".

153
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,120
Well, first of all, there's
money and power, -

154
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,150
but secondly, they wanted to
create The League Of Nations.

155
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,960
They had this in their plans all
along and as a consequence, -

156
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,060
once the war was over or about
to be over, they begin to formulate -

157
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,130
this idea of a League of Nations so
this would never ever happen again.

158
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,640
Hundreds of years of practice
made the British experts at -

159
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,270
hiding their empire behind puppet
governments and councils.

160
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,810
In the name of stopping all future
conflicts they proposed that -

161
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,580
countries would join a League of Nations.

162
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,750
Their true intention was for the League to
serve as a framework for World Government.

163
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,530
President Woodrow Wilson who had
spearheaded the establishment of -

164
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:12,400
the private Federal Reserve system
in the United States in 1913 -

165
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,300
strongly supported the establishment
of a League of Nations.

166
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,100
Woodrow Wilson was
a very naive President.

167
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,440
He was basically a college professor that
was drafted into this whole system.

168
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,910
The League convened in Paris in
1919 but many nations recognized -

169
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,820
it as a threat to their sovereignty
and refused to join.

170
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,690
Frustrated by the U.S. Congress
blocking the League of Nations, -

171
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,920
British Intelligence, with the
help of the Rockefeller family, -

172
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:45,200
set up the Council on Foreign Relations
in New York City in 1921.

173
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,500
The Council recruited the best
and brightest of American life -

174
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,870
to support the growth of the
Anglo-American empire.

175
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,210
The C.F.R.'s stated mission
is to abolish all Nation States -

176
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,010
in favor of an all powerful World
Government administered by a tiny elite.

177
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,690
By 1930 the promoters of World Government
had split into 2 interlocking camps: -

178
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:16,260
the Fabian Socialists centered in London
and the Fascists based in Italy and Germany.

179
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,270
"National socialism will use it's
own revolution for establishing a -

180
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,170
New World Order."
~Adolf Hitler

181
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,480
Supporters of the fascists in the
United States and England believed -

182
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,820
that the military should be used to quickly
transform the world into a New World Order, -

183
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,090
while the more sophisticated
practitioners of socialism stated -

184
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,420
that incrementalism was the
sure path to world domination.

185
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,660
Congressional Medal of Honor winner
Major General Smedley Butler -

186
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:53,730
went public in 1934 exposing an
attempt by the robber barons -

187
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,900
to launch a military overthrow
of the United States.

188
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,910
The war hero testified to the
McCormack-Dickstein Committee in Congress -

189
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,380
that some of the most
powerful men in America -

190
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,750
had tried to recruit him
to lead a military coup, -

191
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,820
so they could set up National
Socialism in the United States.

192
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,420
Gen. Butler Bares
"Plot" by Fascists

193
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,790
I appeared before the
Congressional Committee, -

194
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,460
the highest representation
of the American people, -

195
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,770
under subpoena to tell what
I knew of activities which -

196
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,040
I believed might lead to an attempt
to set up a fascist dictatorship.

197
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,740
I was supposed to lead an
organization of 500,000 men -

198
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,910
which would be able to takeover
the functions of government.

199
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,010
The fascists had also made
deep inroads in England.

200
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,090
Edward VIII, King of England,
was forced to abdicate the throne -

201
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,860
because of his public support for Hitler.

202
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,950
Though the German-led
fascist camp was strong, -

203
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,080
the Fabian Socialists block
was able to maintain control -

204
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,190
of the U.S., Russia and England.

205
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,230
In the build-up to World War II,
and during the conflict, -

206
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:38,540
the bakers again financed both sides,
just as they had done with Napoleon.

207
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,350
With the rise and fall of the
3rd Reich, Europe lay in ruins.

208
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,810
Once again the elite claimed
that only Global Governance -

209
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,110
could save humanity from certain
destruction, and this time -

210
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,250
the elite would succeed in
setting up their world body.

211
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,590
In April of 1945, at the Presidio
Naval Base in San Francisco, -

212
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,170
the United Nations was founded
by the victors of World War II.

213
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,100
The United Nations complex
was then built in New York City -

214
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,070
on land donated by
John D. Rockefeller.

215
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,580
Shortly after the elite established the
United Nations as their base in the US, -

216
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,480
the newly formed World Council quickly
began work on the next phase in their plan: -

217
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,620
the incremental formation
of continental superstates.

218
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,590
The 1st step in their trilateral plan was
the creation of the European Union.

219
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:15,270
Unifying Europe had been tried many
times and was extremely unpopular.

220
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,840
Where Napoleon and Hitler had failed
to accomplish their goals using force, -

221
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,510
the Globalists would
succeed using stealth.

222
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:29,780
The British spearheaded the formation
of a Council of Europe on May 5th 1949.

223
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,320
The treaty of London claimed to
only establish trade ties between -

224
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,190
European Nations, like N.A.F.T.A.
or G.A.T.T. in North America.

225
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,560
It's true intention was the formation
of a European Superstate.

226
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,090
We shall have World Government
whether or not you like it, -

227
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,340
by conquest or consent.
~James Warburg

228
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:53,570
In the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
February 17, 1950 -

229
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,610
In 1954 the elite of the
planet met in secret at the -

230
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,000
Bilderberg Hotel in
Oosterbeek, Holland.

231
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,700
The Bilderberg Group would
later admit that their mission -

232
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,150
was the formation of the EU.

233
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,360
Once the EU was established
under the guise of trade deals, -

234
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,100
a North American Union and
Asian Union would be formed.

235
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,770
The 3 interlocking superstates form
the core of the Global Government -

236
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,840
while the United Nations would
serve as a world regulatory -

237
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,880
and enforcement body over
the 3rd world subregions.

238
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,950
The Bilderberg Group consists
of the heads of all the -

239
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,680
managing roundtable groups
that steer individual countries.

240
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,820
Picture the elite power structure
of the world as a giant pyramid -

241
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,830
with only the elite of the elite
at the tip top of the capstone.

242
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,670
The group has been so secretive
that until the mid 1980s the -

243
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,640
controlled corporate media
denied it's existence.

244
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,580
Into the late 1990s coverage only
consisted of rare one-line mentions.

245
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,790
With the rise of the
alternative media -

246
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,100
their stranglehold on
information has begun to slip.

247
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,700
On the outskirts of the
National Capitol today -

248
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,470
black limousines with darkened
windows converged on a hotel -

249
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,610
where private security guards
imposed iron-clad control.

250
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,140
The limos carried, royalty,
political power brokers and -

251
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:43,850
industrial titans to a secret
meeting that will last all weekend.

252
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,020
It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
Could their objective be world domination?

253
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,690
Every 4 years Bilderberg
meets in North America -

254
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,900
and in June of 2006 we
decided to travel  to Ottawa -

255
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:05,640
the Capitol of Canada:
the site of Bilderberg.

256
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,610
In Bilderberg's long history
many reporters attempting -

257
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,080
to cover the group have been
harassed, detained and even jailed.

258
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,560
I jokingly reassured my cameramen
that the horror we'd read about -

259
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,260
were probably exaggerated.
I was wrong.

260
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,000
Detained at Airport

261
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,460
We know reporters get detained
at airports, people aren't let in.

262
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,870
We know people get sent to
the jail house for 3 or 4 hours -

263
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,670
It happens every time!
Well, it happened to Alex Jones this time.

264
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,670
They admitted Bilderberg...
that they had pressure -

265
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,040
put on them by the government
to heighten security, -

266
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,000
and that that's why
all this happened.

267
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,250
Yes, I was told that
by two separate people.

268
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,280
They scoured our records for
hours yesterday and hours today, -

269
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,460
trying to find something on us,
and of course there was nothing.

270
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,520
It was just scary, -

271
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,590
I've been all over the world and
I've never seen anything like this.

272
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,460
It was like hours of humiliation, and
they said, "What are you here for?" -

273
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,700
and I said, "Well, I'm here
to cover the media, -

274
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,100
covering a political event, I hope to
talk to some members of Parliament".

275
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,610
I was answering all the questions, -

276
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,500
it was clear I
wasn't a threat, -

277
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,870
it was clear I
didn't have a criminal record, -

278
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,820
it was clear I
was press, -

279
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,680
it was clear I
was coming to interview people.

280
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,940
They were gonna deny me, -

281
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,810
they told me earlier that
I'd probably be denied, -

282
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,750
and then you guys showed
up and everything changed.

283
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,350
So what's your plan now?

284
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,660
My plan is to go out and try
to interview Jim Tucker, -

285
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,060
to try to go down to the
Bilderberg Group and maybe -

286
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,000
catch some of them still arriving,
and try to still make a documentary.

287
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,080
So instead of being here at
8am in the morning when the -

288
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,980
Bilderberg Group attendees and the
100 elite of the planet start showing up, -

289
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,580
were gonna be in here
about 3:30 or so, -

290
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,850
and we'll see if we can catch
any of the elites coming in.

291
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,170
Brookstreet Hotel / Ottawa Canada

292
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:30,320
What do you think is on the agenda for
this edition of the Bilderberg's annual meeting.

293
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,450
They're debating the attack on Iran
and how to take out Hugo Chavez.

294
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,460
They're talking about how to
get their American Union in, -

295
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,330
it destroys Canadian, U.S.
and Mexican sovereignty.

296
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,530
We're talking about the death of Canada
that's what's happening in there right now.

297
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,870
The death of your sovereignty is
happening in there right now.

298
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,700
CNN has even reported that these
individuals have put out the policy reports -

299
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:55,000
through the Council on Foreign Relations
that writes their scholarly white papers -

300
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,540
to end the United States, to
end Canada and to end Mexico.

301
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,680
About 10 have come in.

302
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,490
They've been coming in slowly, -

303
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,020
in typically big black cars with
what appears to be bullet proof glass, -

304
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,630
and we've got a few pictures
of some of the people.

305
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,430
We're being kept well back from the
building by an awful lot of -

306
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,300
security people, but there'll be
more security as this thing develops.

307
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,210
OK, just a reminder to
stay off the property, OK?

308
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,740
I am, I am. This is the line,
we checked with the city.

309
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,060
Yes you are!

310
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:30,710
Thank you.

311
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:48,160
I came here from up state New York.
I booked a room way in advance -

312
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,600
but I checked in at 10 at night,
but they told me I had to be -

313
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,730
out by 8:30 in the morning. And so,
of course I complied with what they wanted, -

314
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,200
I wasn't happy about it because I had
been tired, I drove quite a long way.

315
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,610
Then I went down to have
something to eat and I just -

316
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,280
saw a bunch of security here,
and I was wondering what was -

317
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,350
going on and I asked questions
and they said that they were having -

318
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,980
a wedding or they were having
some sort of reception, -

319
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,150
so I decided to ask a couple
more questions 'cause I thought -

320
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,460
it was kinda weird, and then I
saw them from my hotel window, -

321
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,800
they were in the back with
flashlights looking at the trees, -

322
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,900
looking up through the trees, and they
were also in front of the hotel combing...

323
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,300
it looked like combing the hotel,
so I kinda got..was wondering -

324
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,810
what was going on, and I left.
I got up this morning, -

325
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,910
I checked out and then the
fella that I spoke with, -

326
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,450
the last fella I spoke with said
"You'll see in the newspaper."

327
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,820
Well I didn't have to wait
because there was a group -

328
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,720
of people out here telling me
about everything that was going on.

329
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,730
They're not fooling anybody any longer.
When you've got this many cops, -

330
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,200
you know, and detaining
Alex Jones at the border.

331
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,000
Get 'em on both sides.
Yeah you crook!

332
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,410
Yeah, you're gonna go
to jail like Ken Lay!

333
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,550
Oh yeah, There's one right there.
Hi! Hey, we're not your property, -

334
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,850
we're not your slaves. We're
gonna defeat the New World Order.

335
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,690
The New World Order's gonna be
defeated. You realize that, -

336
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,200
I'm glad you do. Always
does throughout history.

337
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,960
Etienne Devignon is the Honorary
Chairman of the Bilderberg Group, -

338
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,400
as well as the head
of its steering committee.

339
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,270
The committee he heads selects
and invites each years attendees.

340
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,250
In the last decade the
list of attendees has been -

341
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,880
leaked to reporters by
moles on the inside.

342
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,620
Veteran newspaper reporter Jim
Tucker has been covering the -

343
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,930
Bilderberg meetings for over 30 years
and has physically attended more than 20.

344
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:40,000
We traveled back to our hotel to see
if Jim Tucker received the 2006 list.

345
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,040
I first heard about Bilderberg in
1975 and I said, "I don't believe it", -

346
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,240
"That's not possible",
"Who in hell's Bilderberg?".

347
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,880
I spent 20 happy years
with metropolitan newspapers.

348
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,850
All the while there's
a clicking at my ear: -

349
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,890
that could not happen
without me knowing about it.

350
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,220
And the thing that first impressed
me most was calls in 1957 -

351
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,930
by the late great Westbrook Pegler,
widely syndicated columnist.

352
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:16,400
He wrote 2 lengthy columns
about how approximately 100 leaders -

353
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,440
of international finance, heads
of state, high public officials, -

354
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,010
were meeting behind armed guards, closed
doors on Jekyll Island, sealed off.

355
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:31,220
What are these powerful internationalists
doing? And why is it so secret?

356
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,090
Why do they have armed guards
outside? Why is it sealed off?

357
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,060
The newspapers totally ignore
it - not a word.

358
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,730
Total blackout in the United States.

359
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:48,270
Since then I have never stopped
pursuing Bilderberg or the whole -

360
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:53,570
international gangster organization
lead by Rockefellers and -

361
00:28:53,730 --> 00:29:00,000
Rothschilds as they manipulate the
world for their own selfish interests.

362
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,890
Jim, you've been waiting on the list.
You normally get it on the 1st day.

363
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,660
You haven't gotten it. We're
told it might come in today.

364
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,120
How important is that list?

365
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,660
It's absolutely essential,
although identifying people outside -

366
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,600
as we always do is important too,
to find out who is not on their own list.

367
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:25,240
In recent years someone from
Europe has sent a machine copy -

368
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,170
with the letterhead and so
forth, without identifying himself.

369
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,740
So far I haven't heard from him.

370
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:47,690
Well Bilderberg assumed that
name in 1954 at their first -

371
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,100
meeting as Bilderberg,
at the Bilderberg hotel.

372
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,830
It's a little bit like
Shakespeare's "As you like it".

373
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,270
They say to Shakespeare,
"What do you want to call this book?"

374
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,140
and he says, "As you like it",
meaning whatever you want to call it, -

375
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,210
but they thought it was a
dictation so one of his plays -

376
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,480
is called "As you like it", but
the title has nothing to do with the play.

377
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,510
So that's how the Bilderberg
came by their name.

378
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,890
Now they had been meeting
for half a century, -

379
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,060
the monied class had been meeting.
But they decided they have to -

380
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,860
meet systematically, every
year, well planned in advanced, -

381
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,560
in addition to other smaller
meetings throughout the year.

382
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,830
Is the right turn, Jim?

383
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,970
Nope.

384
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,550
This is the Global Government.
They are setting the world agenda.

385
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,420
Inside right now,

386
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,190
they're deciding whether or not
there will be a war with Iran, -

387
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,460
whether or not
taxes will increase, -

388
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,230
whether oil prices will
be suppressed or increased.

389
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:02,170
There's much more on agenda,
that we'll find out about in time, -

390
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,100
but those are 3 items that
are heavy on their list this year.

391
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,820
This is Jim Tucker, Ladies and
Gentlemen. 27 years covering these crooks.

392
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,520
Mr Tucker, a
pleasure to meet you.

393
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,020
The media said he was crazy,
it didn't exist. Now we forced them.

394
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,250
It's a pleasure to meet you.

395
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,920
120 of the worlds most powerful
men: heads of state from Europe,

396
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,160
high officials from the United
States Government, Treasury Dept., -

397
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:33,630
White House, state, defense.
They're setting the world agenda now.

398
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,170
The reason they want secrecy
is because they're doing evil.

399
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:43,000
Evil is done under the cover of darkness,
good works are done in the sunshine.

400
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,380
Hi, how you doin'? Good.

401
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,680
Get off the property please.

402
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,820
Well, Jim has some
questions for you.

403
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,750
I need you to move
off the property please.

404
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,620
OK, sure.
It's a public sidewalk.

405
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,790
Oh yeah we are cooperating.

406
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,890
Thank you.
Right onto the sidewalk.

407
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,890
Yeah, there's no implication
that we aren't cooperating.

408
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,360
When your onto the sidewalk
can you stay there please?

409
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,530
Sure. Yeah. Thank you.

410
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,100
Great.

411
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,970
Jim has some questions for you.

412
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,240
Again, I need you to stay
right on the sidewalk.

413
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,370
Yeah, we actually checked with the
city. The property line is actually right here.

414
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,510
Also...

415
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,280
That's good. The property
line's actually right here.

416
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,480
We are on the verge of
a global transformation.

417
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,790
All we need is the right
major crisis and the nations -

418
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,390
will accept the New World Order.
~David Rockefeller

419
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,400
We saw David Rockefeller at the
back of the building of the hotel -

420
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:43,570
and they had no body guards.
One of my friends shouted, -

421
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:50,010
"Hey Rockefeller" and he
turned back and he was...afraid.

422
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,210
My name's René. I'm from Manitoba.
I drove about 26 hours to get here, -

423
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,080
just to show my..that I'm
against the Bilderbergers, -

424
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,720
just to fight for my freedoms,
fight for my rights, -

425
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,320
make sure that my children
can grow up in a free country.

426
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,760
My name is Daniel Estulin and I've
been doing this for the last 15 years.

427
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,030
I'm from Canada. I'm very proud
of my country because as you can see -

428
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,200
there are a lot of people
covering the Bilderberg conference.

429
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:22,610
Last year it took me 14 and
a half hours to get to Munich.

430
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,080
I was pulled off a plane in Milan,
I was pulled off a plane in Munich.

431
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,910
They interrogated me for
4 hours, both places.

432
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,250
I was able to call a friend,
a journalist in Rome, -

433
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:35,190
as a result of his presence
and others calling the -

434
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,160
Foreign Ministry Department in Italy,
they backed off and they let me go.

435
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,530
They basically told me that they'll
be keeping an eye on me 24 hours a day.

436
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,970
The little hotel we were staying at,
Jim and I, out of the 20 rooms -

437
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,370
6 were occupied, 3 by the CIA
and 3 by the German Secret Service.

438
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,570
That's how serious these people are.
That's how afraid they are of -

439
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,480
what we may be able
to reveal and what we -

440
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,450
actually do reveal publicly
about the Bilderberg intents.

441
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,850
Daniel Estulin has covered the
Bilderberg meetings in Europe -

442
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:10,020
and North America for more than
15 years. His book, Club Bilderberg, -

443
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:15,090
has been translated into more than
20 languages and is a global best seller.

444
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,800
Estulin has photographed
many past Bilderberg meetings.

445
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:25,240
Rockefeller front man, Henry
Kissinger, is always a key participant.

446
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:30,380
Here you see the President
of the CFR, Richard N. Haas, -

447
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,710
followed by Vice Chairman of
Rothschild Europe, Franco Bernabé, -

448
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:39,650
who is speaking with Henry Kravis,
and behind them is Richard Holbrooke, -

449
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,390
former U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations.

450
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:49,730
The head of Daimler Chrysler,
Jürgen Schrempp, arrives by helicopter.

451
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,870
Here the owner of the
Washington Post, Donald Graham, -

452
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,100
escorts Indra Nooyi,
the head of Pepsi Co.

453
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,440
Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands,
who's father, Prince Bernhard, -

454
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,410
founded Bilderberg, is a
leading figure in the group.

455
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,410
Of course Globalist Kingpin,
David Rockefeller, -

456
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,420
seen here with his body guard,
James Ford, always attends.

457
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,860
The then newly appointed
World Bank Chief, -

458
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:21,430
Paul Wolfowitz, is
photographed at Bilderberg 2005.

459
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,330
It has been reported that Wolfowitz
had attended previous meetings -

460
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,240
while still the Deputy Secretary
of Defense, a violation of the Logan Act.

461
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,210
Under the Logan Act it is a
felony offense for any member of -

462
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,940
federal or state government to meet
with members of a foreign government -

463
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,620
without the express authority and
authorization of the President or Congress.

464
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,550
Put simply, it is illegal
for members of the government -

465
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,990
to meet secretly, behind closed
doors, with foreign power brokers -

466
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,630
due to the problems of corruption
and espionage that it breeds.

467
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,330
For this reason, many
prominent politicians attend -

468
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,740
but their names do not
appear on the official list.

469
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,740
Despite the Logan Act, the Governor
of New York's name, George Pataki -

470
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,350
does appear on the list, and
we were able to catch the Governor -

471
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,250
on tape walking with David
Rockefeller at Brookstreet.

472
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,060
Multiple staff members inside
Brookstreet reported to us that -

473
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,390
Hillary Clinton had
attended for half a day.

474
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,930
Several armored limos
with diplomatic plates did arrive -

475
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,230
with police escorts and
offloaded their passengers -

476
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:38,000
in the underground parking garage
out of the sight of the press.

477
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,940
Former World Bank President, James
Wolfensohn, sardonically stared at our cameras.

478
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,420
Do you think that they're upset
about the fact their being exposed?

479
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,490
Well I'm sure they are,
look at the tinted windows.

480
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,920
They don't want to be seen, they
don't want anybody to know they're here.

481
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,460
So I'm sure they're ticked, and that's
why we're here, to try to expose them.

482
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,600
Do you think they're angry being on
the front page of the local paper today?

483
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,670
Do you think they're in there
reading it right now, Jim?

484
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,600
Yes, I don't think
they're happy about it.

485
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,400
They prefer nothing at
all. No publicity.

486
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,370
They prefer absolute secrecy.

487
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,880
Yeah, you better look away! We're
not your slaves. You don't own me.

488
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,390
Did you get a list of
the attendees or anything?

489
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:32,160
No, I've asked for one under
a slight variation of my name, -

490
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,430
and I don't know if I'll get
it or not. Also, it could happen today.

491
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,960
The last 3 years,
I get back to the hotel...

492
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,630
...and there's a copy
there waiting for you.

493
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:47,240
I'm not just not revealing the source,
I don't know the source myself.

494
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:53,580
But a fax, because they want the
letter head on it, makes a nice memento.

495
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:55,710
Alex.

496
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:56,610
Yeah?

497
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,820
That's Chalabi.

498
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,780
You think Chalabi?

499
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:00,990
No, no, I don't think,
I know.

500
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,990
It looked like Chalabi,
and it was a fat guy, -

501
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,760
Yeah. That was Ahmed Chalabi?

502
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,460
Yeah.

503
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,300
Oh my God, then they're
really gonna attack Iran.

504
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,300
Hey Chalabi,
don't attack Iran

505
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,960
Over the last couple of years they've
been reeling with the amount of -

506
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,600
leakage that they've been experiencing,
so it's getting harder and harder, -

507
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,470
it will never get too hard for us
because of the sources that we have inside.

508
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,100
Our top notch sources: people
who are actually working for them, -

509
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,470
the Secret Service, the second
layer people in the Bilderbergers, -

510
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,050
the clerks, the administry
office. They're there.

511
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,880
They are our eyes and ears and
every time there's something out, -

512
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,290
we always get the information.

513
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:23,800
I think that's the Queen.
You see her?

514
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,750
What usually happens,
the Secret Service guys -

515
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,050
who are protecting the Bilderberger
delegates, the staff, the cooks, the chefs, -

516
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:44,720
when they actually see and hear
what the nasty people are talking about, -

517
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,430
they're the first ones to look
for us, they're the first ones -

518
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,960
to make sure we get the
information from the meeting.

519
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,000
Again, we're very rigorous
with information that does come out, -

520
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,170
we double, triple, and
quadruple the confirmed sources -

521
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,170
to make sure that all the
information checks out.

522
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,310
A lot of the stuff, the
Bilderbergers have planted information -

523
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,050
to make sure this information
nullifies the accuracy of the reporting -

524
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,680
which is why we never publish
the first things we hear.

525
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,660
It looks like Rockefeller.

526
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:31,040
The decisions that these people take,
they're not only decisions that -

527
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,410
affect the business community, they affect politics, -

528
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,840
business, environment,
across the entire spectrum, -

529
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:42,650
and these decisions are taken by a very
elite group of people behind closed doors, -

530
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:46,550
this year at the Brookstreet Hotel.
We're not privy to these decisions, -

531
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,520
we're not allowed to know what
they talk about, but we'll definitely -

532
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,090
feel the consequences of these decisions
over the next 12 months when events, -

533
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:57,130
apparently by accident seem to happen,
in fact they've been planned right here, -

534
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:01,730
this year at Brookstreet Hotel
between 8th & 11th of June.

535
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,540
What does it do when you get 120 of
the most powerful people in the world -

536
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:08,640
getting together to have meetings with
government officials? I mean that's amazing.

537
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,340
Well this is what I mean, they
are planning the corporate agenda, -

538
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:17,720
they are not planning the democratic
human journey agenda, in my opinion.

539
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:21,590
Mussolini had a definition; it's when
the interests of the corporation -

540
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,890
take completely over from all other
interests - and that's fascism.

541
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,830
He said they should probably
call it Corporatism.

542
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,630
Well, call it Corporatism, call it
Fascism, call it neo-lib, neo-con...

543
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,900
there's a whole variety of political
words depending on which side -

544
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,140
of the stripe you come from, to start
with, which describes the thing.

545
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:41,170
But, what they are describing is
the complete end of democracy, -

546
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:44,340
the end of what matters to people,
the end of what happens to -

547
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:47,280
the human journey, and for that
reason I think this is revolting.

548
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,280
Ladies and gentlemen
we're here in Canada today -

549
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,350
to stand up against the Bilderberg
Group that's attempting to get rid of -

550
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:58,090
the sovereignty of the United States.
The truth of their world government -

551
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:03,260
has now been exposed. We know you are
ruthless, we know you are evil.

552
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:07,770
To David Rockefeller, to the
Rothschilds' representatives here, -

553
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,370
to the Queen of the Netherlands,
to all of you, we tell you: -

554
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,970
"You are not our Queens", -

555
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,270
"You are not our Kings", -

556
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,740
"You are not our Gods", -

557
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,040
"We do not belong to you",
"We are not your slaves".

558
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,810
We stand as free humans have
stood since the beginning of time -

559
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,120
against the strong men, against
the thugs, against the bullies.

560
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,790
We will defeat your world government.
We will defeat world taxation.

561
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:36,160
We will defeat your control grid.
God is on our side.

562
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,030
I stand before the creator of the
universe, and I ask the creator, -

563
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,940
as our founding fathers did in 1776,
to lead, guide and direct us, -

564
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:51,080
and to give us the power, and
the foresight and the understanding -

565
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,210
and the will to stand
against your entire agenda -

566
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,080
including your final plan of
world population reduction of 80%, -

567
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:04,990
that Henry Kissinger penned in 1973.
Why do you put mercury in the vaccines?

568
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,130
Stani(?)sodium chloride
in the water? Why?

569
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,400
Why do you put cancer
viruses in the vaccines?

570
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,630
Why have you used depleted uranium
now in four separate nations?

571
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,700
You're arrogant. You have the
sickness that elites have had -

572
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:24,010
throughout history in their literal,
and in some cases figurative, ivory towers.

573
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:29,250
You believe that you are invincible.
You will and you are failing now.

574
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,920
Your new world order will fall.
Humanity will defeat you.

575
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:41,060
The answer to 1984 is 1776.

576
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,200
Bilderberg is an elite organization
and the way it works, -

577
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,570
the protocol of the meetings is,
the staff, after they're vetted out, -

578
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,610
they're told exactly how they're
supposed to behave themselves, -

579
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:59,280
meaning they can never address the
attendees, they can never speak to them -

580
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,880
unless they are spoken to first,
they can never look them in the eye.

581
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,220
They have to approach them from
the right side (right-handed people) -

582
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:10,060
and the left side (left-handed people).
They can never look them straight on.

583
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,590
And needless to say, all the
information that is being spoken -

584
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,200
during the conferences is under
no circumstances allowed to come out.

585
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,670
That's what they're told. They're
threatened with not being able to find -

586
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:24,990
another job anywhere in the sector if
they reveal any information to the press.

587
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,110
Richard Holbrooke.

588
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,080
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke thought
the peasantry wouldn't recognize him -

589
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,990
if he took a stroll off
the grounds of Brookstreet.

590
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,200
Holbrooke cackled when I told
him that we were not his slaves.

591
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:55,770
Holbrooke, we're not your slaves,
Holbrooke.

592
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,670
We're not your slaves.

593
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,480
Holbrooke, we don't belong to
you. We're not your property.

594
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,090
Get back on the sidewalk.

595
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,090
We're free humanity.

596
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:21,790
Yeah, there he goes. Coward.

597
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,600
They love it. They love it.

598
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,780
OK, we're gonna be going
round the back here guys.

599
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,880
Hey guys, how you doin?

600
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:56,290
There are several rings of security
service. The American delegation -

601
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,060
at every Bilderberg meeting
is usually protected by the CIA -

602
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,400
and the special division of the
U.S. Army. The British delegation -

603
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,470
is protected by the MI6. Israelis
are usually protected by the Mossad.

604
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,780
The Ottawa Police, in this
case working for the security, they have -

605
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,380
very little...actually they don't
have any information at all -

606
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,980
of what the meeting's about - they don't
even know who the Bilderbergers are.

607
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,320
Then there's an elite private
firm protecting the perimeter, -

608
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,290
doing all the dirty work such
as shooing off the photographers -

609
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:30,200
and bothering the protesters,
but, that's piddly stuff.

610
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:34,730
All the heavy stuff is done by the
security service such as the CIA, MI6.

611
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:38,170
Some years ago, my legs were a
little bit stronger than they are now, -

612
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:42,770
and I crept over a fence, under
cover of darkness, approached...

613
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,010
the cops started yelling
and pointing at me, so I ran -

614
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:51,380
with speed I didn't know I still
had and some shots were fired, -

615
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,920
but they were far above my head.
I mean, they were intimidating but -

616
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,990
they were not really trying to
kill me. Not when sharpshooters are -

617
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,690
firing far above...
20 feet above your head.

618
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:06,160
Bilderberg was founded
by David Rockefeller and the -

619
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:12,070
Rothschilds in Britain and Europe.
They're still the main powers.

620
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:18,140
Baron Evelyn de Rothschild, a
male, attended for many years.

621
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:22,450
Rothschild is still represented, you'll
see them on the list of participants.

622
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:30,190
Somebody represents the Rothschild group.
They are the main powers behind Bilderberg.

623
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:36,930
The Dutch, Shell is part of the Queen's
fortune, of course the Rockefellers have -

624
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:43,230
always had oil interests, that was the
original source of their old man's money.

625
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:52,280
Jim just got the official
Bilderberg-letterhead list from -

626
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:55,650
his mole inside the Bilderberg
Group. Lets go look at it.

627
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,830
So Jim you got the list.

628
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:11,300
Yeah. Did we identify Wolfowitz as
being here? 'cause he's not on the list.

629
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,600
No, we positively
identified Wolfensohn.

630
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,430
Yeah, he's on the list.
Eh, Wolfowitz...

631
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,270
Yeah, there's Wolfensohn
right there. James Wolfensohn.

632
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:18,740
Yip.

633
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:20,310
But aren't there always
people who aren't listed?

634
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,080
Yip. Over the years we've
identified, like, sometimes 3 -

635
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:27,950
people who are not on their
own list, who have attended.

636
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,520
Now, I think what is very difficult for
most people to understand is how such a small -

637
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:39,890
group, of 125 men and a few women, control
a population base of 6 billion people.

638
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,190
Actually it's much
easier than you think.

639
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,130
These people work in what
I call a Systemic Methodology, -

640
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:49,000
meaning that you take an apple pie,
just imagine, and you slice this apple pie -

641
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,260
into lots of very small pieces,
and you put in front of -

642
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,370
each one of these pieces your
man or women of trust, -

643
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:59,940
and by controlling this individual
you control an entire organization.

644
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,950
For example, if you take Paul
Wolfowitz who runs the World Bank, -

645
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:08,350
through him you can control the entire
organization. You don't need to control -

646
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:12,820
what the dishwasher or the toilet
cleaner thinks or does or believes in,

647
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,890
you just need to control what [Wolfowitz]
does and what he believes in.

648
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:19,300
And what [Wolfowitz] does will
permeate the entire organization.

649
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:22,770
And that's how you control, with
a very, very small power base, -

650
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,440
an entire global population
of 6 billion people.

651
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:29,770
Bilderberg is making great
progress toward a world government.

652
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:33,140
They have created a superstate in
Europe called the European Union.

653
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:37,750
They're intent on creating a
western hemisphere union called the -

654
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:44,290
North American Union. NAFTA is to be expanded
into every country in this hemisphere.

655
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:49,030
As NAFTA expands it will take
on the role of the American Union.

656
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:54,070
And only an educated and informed
public can stop them in their tracks.

657
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:59,770
We went into downtown Ottawa
and talked to locals to learn

658
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,910
if they were aware of the
elite meeting in their city.

659
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,620
Hey guys, give me your
attention just for a second.

660
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,890
I just need to tell you that
a group just met here in Canada -

661
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,790
and they're trying to get
rid of your sovereignty, -

662
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,900
merging you with the U.S. and Mexico.
It's not funny, I'm serious.

663
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,040
And your news isn't gonna tell
you about this. This is deadly serious, -

664
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,870
so I'm just letting you know
and telling you about it.

665
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,170
As they say, they are the
guys that run the world.

666
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:39,740
They make the decisions for [us],
and we just carry it out.

667
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,000
Sir, did you here about the Bilderberg
Group meeting here in town -

668
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,800
the 120 most elite
people in the world?

669
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,420
No.

670
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,350
Hey, did you know that the elites
are meeting here in town right now?

671
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:54,090
Have you heard about it - The 120 crime
bosses? None of you have heard about it?

672
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,730
None of you guys have heard of the
Bilderberg Group? There meeting right now.

673
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,070
In the city, around 10%
of the people were aware -

674
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:05,840
of the New World Order agenda.
When we traveled to Parliament, -

675
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:10,040
close to half of the people
we randomly spoke to were informed.

676
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,290
Ma'am, what did you say
about the American Union?

677
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,690
I said it's gonna end up happening.
We don't want it but it's gonna happen.

678
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:26,390
Why do you think?

679
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,350
Well, because the Bilderberg
Group runs the world.

680
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:32,300
You have the Trilateral Commission
that's also part of the Bilderberg,

681
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,800
which is Unites States, Europe and Asia.
But most of this is public knowledge.

682
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,640
Nobody wants to believe their are
conspiracies - that world leaders are already -

683
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:49,310
elected before they're voted on.
So here we know that Bernard Lord is -

684
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:53,490
part of the outer circle.
I was surprised to read that -

685
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:57,990
[Canadian Prime Minister] Harper
addressed a group in 2003, -

686
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,490
because my understanding was,
nobody gets into politics without -

687
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:05,030
becoming part of the Bilderberg
Group, and then you find out -

688
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,670
afterwards that that is
the case, that they have...

689
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:11,440
Well, yeah, well, Bill Clinton went
there in 1991, George Bush Sr.

690
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:16,040
attended back in '85. And Tony
Blair. Same thing. Who we think -

691
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,280
we're electing as leaders have
already been pre-picked for us, -

692
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,650
whether it's Liberal or Conservative,
they're already part of the group.

693
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:27,020
They own all the
horses in the race.

694
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,890
They own the horses and I understand
that...for example the United States, -

695
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:35,260
it's a one party system with 2 factions,
though you think it's 2 different parties.

696
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:39,500
Oh it is, yeah. It's like,
Bill Clinton constantly vacations -

697
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:42,370
with the Bushes and they call
him their son. And they actually -

698
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:45,240
staged all that in '92 and
all that's come out.

699
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:49,170
It's just all staged. They're not
gonna let trillions of dollars -

700
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,980
slip through their hands. The good
news is people are waking up though.

701
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,880
When you read human history,
when you study it, all you see is -

702
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,450
elites trying to dominate,
subterfuge, Machiavellian backstabbing, -

703
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:02,820
and somehow in the last 50 years
they convinced westerners that the -

704
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,590
government's fine, can do no wrong,
trust them. How did this happen?

705
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,800
It's easy to lead sheep.
I mean, people just follow.

706
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,430
They don't want to believe
these things will happen. No way.

707
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,330
We'll just follow
along with the norm.

708
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,740
That's all, it just makes
it easier for everyone.

709
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,470
What's you view on
losing Canada's sovereignty.

710
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,640
I'd like this country to stay as it is,
and I love United States to be there.

711
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,780
Back in Austin, the Capitol
of Texas, the public -

712
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,850
was frighteningly unaware
of the nation's peril.

713
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,090
Have you heard of the
North American Union?

714
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,800
Um, not really, no.
I don't watch T.V.

715
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,860
No I haven't.

716
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:46,730
Interesting. I was
not aware of that.

717
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,400
I don't, I don't know
exactly what you mean so...

718
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:54,140
I don't think there's going
to be a merger of the free nations.

719
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,670
No, I have not.

720
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,580
Eh, no.

721
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:00,680
Eh, no, I didn't know
this was happening so...

722
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,150
Yes, I have.

723
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:02,650
No I haven't.

724
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:03,610
Oh, you have heard about it.
Yes.

725
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:04,920
No.

726
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,450
After that big rally today
they don't know about it?

727
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,150
I don't know about anything.

728
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,550
No I have not.

729
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,220
Have you heard of
the European Union?

730
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,090
I have, yes.

731
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,790
Are you aware of
the European Union?

732
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:14,290
Oh yeah, of course.

733
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,360
Have you heard about
the European Union?

734
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,960
Heard about them.

735
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:20,070
Do you know about
the European Union?

736
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,300
No.

737
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,540
Europe? 15 member group? Expanding?

738
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:25,500
A what?

739
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,470
15 nations of Europe
merging in 2000.

740
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,580
Whatever.

741
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:36,250
For over 50 years the Bilderberg
Group constructed the European -

742
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,750
Union by stealth under the guise
of trade deals. Now the elite -

743
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:44,090
are using the same secretive
program to complete the North -

744
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:48,290
American Union, but this time
superstate integration is on the -

745
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:53,500
extreme fast track. International
agreements like NAFTA, GATT -

746
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:58,570
or APEC were just stepping stones
in the formation of the N.A.U.

747
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,780
The North American Union was officially
born at Baylor University in Waco, -

748
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:10,550
Texas on March 23rd, 2005. The leaders
of the United States, Mexico and -

749
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,250
Canada told the press that they
were only meeting to discuss trade.

750
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,560
It soon leaked that a secret
meeting had been held during the -

751
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,920
Security and Prosperity
Trilateral Summit.

752
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:24,500
The 3 governments had refused to release
the secret agreement to the people.

753
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:30,300
In September of 2006 their treasonous
operation was blown wide open.

754
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:34,470
From September 12th to September
14th, in Banff, Canada, -

755
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,080
hundreds of elected and appointed
government leaders from Canada, -

756
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,510
Mexico and the United
States, met in secret.

757
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,680
On the last day of the conference
someone inside the secret -

758
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:47,950
North American Union Forum
leaked the agenda.

759
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:53,090
The front pages of newspapers
across Canada carried the story.

760
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,460
The Judicial Watch Foundation submitted
Freedom of Information Act Requests -

761
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:00,670
to obtain the full agenda and
minutes of the secret assembly.

762
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,340
Many federal agencies refused
citing National Security.

763
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:10,240
The foundation finally succeeded and
did receive thousands of pages of documents.

764
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:14,180
The documents, marked 'Unclassified',
are the blueprints of a -

765
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,980
shadow government ruling by
bureaucratic and Executive fiat.

766
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:22,750
The pages chronicle an already
operating North American Union.

767
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,030
Transportation, Law Enforcement,
Agriculture, Regulation, Banking, -

768
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:32,200
Manufacturing, Construction, Education,
Immigration and even the -

769
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:36,740
Military are being merged with
no input from the people or their -

770
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,740
elected representatives in
Congress and Parliament.

771
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,240
One of the first items on their
agenda was to stress how important -

772
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:46,980
it was that their plan quote
"be carried out by stealth".

773
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,450
The controllers also talked about
exploiting the public's fears of -

774
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:56,320
climate change to push a continent-wide
tax to fund the new government.

775
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,030
Globalist tool, Robert Pastor, is
incessantly paraded on the world stage -

776
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:07,500
as the man behind the North American
merger. When he testified before congress, -

777
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,900
he pushed the idea of a
continental security perimeter that -

778
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:14,440
erases national boundaries and
merges the security apparatus.

779
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:19,210
The best way to secure the United
States today is not at our 2 borders -

780
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:23,680
with Mexico and Canada, but at the
borders of North America as a whole.

781
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:28,650
In fact, the North American Command
based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, -

782
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,020
was clearly running the meeting in
Canada. For the past decade the Pentagon -

783
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:37,330
has been training with Mexican and
Canadian forces, and has openly discussed -

784
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:42,770
them inside the United States for
disasters and to quell domestic unrest.

785
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:51,580
There are already over 100,000 non-U.S.
citizens serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.

786
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:55,850
The Pentagon is now expanding
it's recruiting centers in -

787
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:59,250
Mexico, the Philippines
and Eastern Europe.

788
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:05,260
Big city police departments nation-wide
are lobbying to change laws -

789
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,830
so they can recruit non-citizens
to join the police force.

790
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:15,170
What we are witnessing is a
Red Don scenario in slow motion.

791
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:22,070
Tyrants throughout history have used
foreigners to oppress their domestic populations.

792
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:33,550
When their coup by stealth was exposed,
the 3 governments went into damage-control mode.

793
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:37,190
The Security and Prosperity Partnership
quickly staged a show -

794
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,990
summit that was held in Ottawa,
Canada, in February of 2007.

795
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,960
The only way that we can achieve
Security and Prosperity for our people -

796
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,470
is through this cooperation.

797
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:53,240
We actually occupy one physical
space, the North America.

798
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,810
We've also had a chance,
as Foreign Ministers, -

799
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:00,350
to talk about how we cooperate in
the region and, indeed, in the world.

800
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:04,720
Protesters who were upset about losing their
countries and freedoms were not tolerated.

801
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,690
...no democratic process...

802
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:14,560
...whatsoever. the Security and
Prosperity Partnership has been...

803
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,030
...to put an end to the parliamentary debate.

804
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:21,430
Globalist publications have
been open with their frustration -

805
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:25,540
that the population has not
bought their latest P.R. stunt.

806
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,980
As integration inside the European
and American Unions accelerates, -

807
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,450
the superstates themselves
are being merged.

808
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:41,790
On April 30th, 2007, a summit
was held at the White House.

809
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,620
The Security and Prosperity
Partnership's secretive approach -

810
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:49,730
had alarmed the public, so
this time President Bush, -

811
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:53,730
German Chancellor Merkel and
EU Commission President Barroso -

812
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:57,200
hid their treachery in plain sight.

813
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:02,440
I thank the Chancellor and Jose
very much for the Trans-Atlantic -

814
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,810
Economic Integration Plan.

815
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:08,450
And for that too, we need to develop
a common market, common standards.

816
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,850
So this is indeed a very important
agreement, and an agreement -

817
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,150
that also brings with it a
Trans-Atlantic Economic Council -

818
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:21,060
to be a permanent body with
senior people on both sides of the -

819
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,330
Atlantic that will look at all
those issues in a concrete -

820
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:27,100
manner in which way we can
make it move forward.

821
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:33,240
The B.B.C. reported that the U.S.
and E.U. had agreed on a single market.

822
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:37,940
By announcing a new economic community
integration they were simply -

823
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:43,620
repeating what had been done in
America and the E.U. on a larger scale.

824
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,750
The accord states that the 2
blocks will aggressively push -

825
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,290
regulatory convergence in more than
35 areas, from financial services, -

826
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:57,730
intellectual property, military,
education, mergers & acquisitions.

827
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:02,300
They also agreed to jointly
push a global carbon tax.

828
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:05,440
We recognize that we have a
problem with greenhouse gases.

829
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:08,170
We agree there is a global
threat - it's a serious threat.

830
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,140
We agree there is the need to
establish a limit to greenhouse gases.

831
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:17,680
We need to discuss a possible
pricing of CO2, on how -

832
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,420
can we translate this into a
market economic compatible scheme.

833
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:26,190
We have agreed to establish a
high level group - a forum.

834
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:31,630
This E.U.-U.S. result is translated
into the G8, debated together with -

835
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:36,940
the average countries, China, South
Africa, Brazil, among others, and India.

836
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,070
A global solution to
a global problem.

837
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:42,540
If Bilderberg succeeds,
America falls.

838
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:46,380
All the victimized countries
lose their sovereignty.

839
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,480
Bilderberg is not a person, it's
not an idea - it's an ideal.

840
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,650
A very powerful group of people
working together, and for the positions -

841
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:56,090
of ultimate and absolute power,
destroying every constitution on Earth, -

842
01:01:56,210 --> 01:02:00,490
no matter how powerful the
constitution of the nation is, -

843
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,130
that's what these people do.

844
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:08,830
The African Union arose out of the
African Economic Community set up in the 1980s.

845
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:14,310
The African Union is financed by
a consortium of international bodies, -

846
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,740
governments and corporations.

847
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:21,680
The African Union Army serves as an -

848
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:26,520
enforcement arm for the New World
Order's exploitation of Africa.

849
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:33,890
In Asia, A.P.E.C. and A.S.E.A.N.
have announced plans to form the -

850
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:41,000
Asian Union consisting of Asian
and Pacific nations having more than -

851
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,100
3 billion people within it's borders.

852
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:47,910
A.P.E.C. will become the Asian-Pacific
Union and the world is to be -

853
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,980
divided into 3 great regions for
the administrative convenience of the -

854
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:56,510
world government in which
the U.N. is to evolve.

855
01:02:56,770 --> 01:03:00,690
As the Unions form individually,
they are simultaneously -

856
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,120
merged to form the first
Planetary Government.

857
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,390
They're trying to destroy every
nation on Earth which is trying to -

858
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,760
promote progress because these
people, basically they are land owners, -

859
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,870
they don't need progress because
they control the land.

860
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:18,000
If you take the most powerful men
in London, the people who belong -

861
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:22,510
to the council and the committee of
300 who belong to the Bilderbergers, -

862
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,640
and you know, the British Royalty,
the Guelfes, and you know, -

863
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:29,210
the Black Nobility of Venice and Genoa,
these people, they're land owners.

864
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:33,020
The New World Order is the Old World,
I mean, it's just the names have -

865
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:36,090
changed and the appearances have changed
but the concepts haven't changed.

866
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,020
The idea is still to bring the men
back, kicking and screaming -

867
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:43,190
back to the middle ages,
Post-Industrial Age World Order.

868
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:46,130
One of the things that is very
shocking to the most Americans is -

869
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:48,930
the fact that the United Nations
Global Bio-Diversity Assessment, -

870
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:54,140
which came out in 1995, clearly shows
that in order to protect planet Earth -

871
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:57,780
we have to go back to a feudal system -
they actually said that in the document.

872
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,650
To craft a Modern Feudal Society
the globalists are implementing -

873
01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:07,320
a standardized North American Union
I.D. Card to track, trace and -

874
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:13,160
control their serfs as they travel
throughout the 3 regions of the N.A.U.

875
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:20,370
Building on the massive displacement
of humanity, caused by globalization, -

876
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:25,000
the New World Order is rapidly
constructing the physical infrastructure -

877
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:30,340
of the North American Union - the
NAFTA superhighway control grid.

878
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:33,850
I'm Arthur Peterson, Colonel,
Retired, in the Army.

879
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:40,750
I see things today that are happening
that would make my friends -

880
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:46,090
who died in World War II,
turn over in their grave.

881
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:51,100
To think that people would even
think of confiscating land of farmers -

882
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:57,000
and ranchers, and taking their
homes away from them, to turn it over -

883
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:02,610
to a foreign company in Spain which
was controlled by Don Carlton, -

884
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:09,480
the notorious socialist, and they get
the tolls on Texas land for 50 years.

885
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:14,150
The proposed Trans-Texas Corridor would
be a patchwork of superhighways -

886
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:19,020
and railroads stretching 4,000
miles from the border of Mexico, -

887
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:23,400
coming through Texas, to Oklahoma.
A lease has been signed that would -

888
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:28,400
make Texas Highway 121 a toll road.
A private Spanish company won the -

889
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,370
bid to build and collect the
tolls for the next 50 years.

890
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:37,010
These deals with private companies
are being negotiated largely in secret -

891
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,710
and many State lawmakers are worried
taxpayers are being sold down the road.

892
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:45,280
Critics say it's a threat to our
National Security. It's part of a plan -

893
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,150
for a North American Integration
being carried out by government -

894
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:52,890
and corporate elites without
congressional or voter approval.

895
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:06,370
We took to the air over central
Texas to get a birds-eye view -

896
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:09,940
of the Trans-Texas Corridor which
is under construction and -

897
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:13,650
will form the heart of the
Trans-NAFTA superhighway system.

898
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:27,760
History repeats itself. 2000 years
ago all roads led to Rome.

899
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,430
Rome constructed and maintained more
than 10 thousand miles of roads -

900
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:39,670
throughout its empire. The roads were
used to project Roman military power, -

901
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:45,680
to control commerce and to bind the
nations and peoples they ruled.

902
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:51,750
Rome also demanded tribute. Roman
subjects from Albion's to Judæa -

903
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:57,590
were forced to pay a tax to use the
roads. The Romans would then use the -

904
01:06:57,710 --> 01:07:04,400
tax to dominate their subjects.
Today's superhighways are a powerful tool -

905
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:09,670
in the globalis arsonal. They
are instrumental in tearing down nation -

906
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,970
borders and merging Nation
States into larger confederations.

907
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:19,040
Foreign governments and corporations
are predatorily seizing infrastructure -

908
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:25,080
across North America, but nowhere has
there attack been greater than in Texas.

909
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:30,360
Texas is the frontline. Over 8,000
miles of existing roads and land -

910
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,530
are being handed over to
government-backed foreign companies.

911
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:38,560
Foreign companies buy the legislators
who then turn over complete -

912
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,370
control to the same foreigners
who finance their campaigns.

913
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:46,600
Government power is then
illegally transfered to unelected -

914
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:50,840
quasi-governmental regional boards
that circumvent local governments -

915
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:53,650
and the will of the people.

916
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,420
The next stage of this world
government plan is to have a -

917
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:01,920
transportation control, and that
is called the NAFTA superhighway -

918
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:05,090
or in Texas called the Trans-Texas
Corridor. It confiscates -

919
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:12,400
584,000 acres of land to be transfered
into the control of a Spanish company, -

920
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:16,130
which will collect tolls in
Texas for the next 50 years, -

921
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:20,340
and there is no limit in the amount
of tolls that can be collected.

922
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:26,780
More than 80 Federal State Highways have
been designated as international arteries.

923
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:31,380
The I-35 NAFTA Corridor starts
deep inside Mexico and travels -

924
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:35,550
through the middle of the United
States and ends in Central Canada.

925
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:41,990
Container ships from Asia dump their
cargo on the pacific side of Mexico, -

926
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:46,700
it then travels duty free by rail
to the New Kansas City Inland Port, -

927
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:52,640
now considered sovereign soil of
Mexico, in the heart of the United States.

928
01:08:52,990 --> 01:08:57,140
Under international agreements,
predominantly foreign companies are placing -

929
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:02,410
tolls on already existing, paid-for
roads. Federal, State and corporate -

930
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:07,490
documents show that they will then use
the revenue raised to build up the -

931
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:12,290
transportation infrastructure of Mexico,
not the United States or Canada, -

932
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:17,300
so foreign-made products can
pour in even faster from Mexico.

933
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:20,900
Revenues raised will also be
used to fund the fledgling -

934
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,500
North American Union and
its growing bureaucracy.

935
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:29,040
Bottom line: they're using
our own money to enslave us.

936
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:33,010
First of all they're proposing
a North American Tribunal, -

937
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:36,750
which would be similar to what we
have in Chapter 11 of the NAFTA agreement, -

938
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:40,420
which is trumped by international
law. The U.S. Supreme Court and the -

939
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:43,390
Constitution could potentially
be rendered invalid, -

940
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,460
and what we would have is a
new North American business law -

941
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:49,460
that would trump what we have
here in the United States.

942
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:53,570
What is also interesting to
note, that the NAFTA Headquarters -

943
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:59,170
is in Mexico, and controls the
United States trade, and rules -

944
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:02,840
against United States Congress,
and no one seems to challenge it.

945
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,180
It's very probable, and probably
inevitable that our right to -

946
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,780
bear arms will be challenged
in a North American court.

947
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:13,150
So this is just an example of what's
happening and what's being proposed.

948
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:18,290
We want to keep our trial-by-jury
system. We want to keep our right to -

949
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:22,190
keep and bear arms. We want the system
where we have the Supreme Court -

950
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,970
and not have a tribunal that will be
superior to the Supreme Court.

951
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:33,100
In 2005, Cintra, a Spanish-owned company
signed a secret agreement with -

952
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:37,410
the Texas Department of Transportation
to erect toll roads on existing -

953
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:42,750
roads and to toll new roads that
were completely paid for by tax dollars.

954
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:46,120
There are people, believe it or not,
in Texas, who don't know what -

955
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,850
the Trans-Texas Corridor is.

956
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:48,850
He's right!

957
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:52,460
TTC69, we still have the environmental
hearings, starting this spring,

958
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:55,560
on runs through my part of the State.
And there are people over there -

959
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,400
who have no idea of what's fixing
to come in their back yard.

960
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,170
TxDOT, an unelected State Agency
claimed that the agreement with -

961
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:07,040
the foreign company was even
secret from the Texas legislator.

962
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:11,080
When the truth came out, newspapers
across the State called -

963
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,410
for heads to roll, politically.

964
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:17,580
Citra's response was to have it's
Australian subsidiary make it's first -

965
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:22,890
U.S. newspaper buy. Every newspaper
they bought was along branches of -

966
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:27,130
the Trans-Texas Corridor and had
been critical of the toll road plan.

967
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:32,200
The cost of 40 or 50 newspapers is
nothing compared to the profits -

968
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:37,540
that'll be made. Just phase one alone,
of the State toll road plan is -

969
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:41,740
estimated to raise more than 200
billion dollars in just the first -

970
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:47,750
15 years, and Texas is just a
small part of the global panorama.

971
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,080
A combine of trans-national companies
is aggressively consolidating -

972
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:57,460
public finance infrastructure,
world-wide. And the same interests -

973
01:11:57,610 --> 01:12:02,330
are erecting a world government
according to their rules.

974
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:06,300
A literal wonderland of corporate
corruption where governments -

975
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:10,940
simply act as vacuum cleaners,
sucking up the wealth and resources -

976
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:15,540
of the middle class, and transferring
it to offshore bank accounts, -

977
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:21,010
leaving behind a cultural and economic
wasteland of easily managed slaves.

978
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:25,520
The whole purpose about the North
American Free Trade Agreement is -

979
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:30,190
not about 'trade', it's about
control - control of people.

980
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:35,260
GATT is even worse. Control of
people. It's not about trade, -

981
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:37,760
it's subsidized trade
with taxpayer's funds.

982
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:40,200
This thing started here, -

983
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,770
and to save this country,
we kill this damn thing here.

984
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,940
Yeah! Woo! Alright!

985
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:52,180
If we stop it here in Texas, we stop the
New World Order right here in Texas.

986
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:55,850
Polls consistently show that
over 90% of the people are -

987
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:59,050
against the NAFTA highway
systems and it's toll roads.

988
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:03,020
As the people learned of the threat,
they got angry and took action.

989
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,960
Our ranch is part of the
original Spanish land grant -

990
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,330
and I would love to not
have to give it back to Spain.

991
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:21,840
Opponents of a proposed superhighway
today held a major protest.

992
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:34,420
No TTC! No TTC! No TTC! No TTC!
Down with the American Union!

993
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,860
A majority of Texas counties
have voted to resist the plan -

994
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,890
for a North American Union
and have vowed to block the -

995
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,800
construction of it's infrastructure.

996
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:47,770
And heck, we already know,
in a law that was passed by a -

997
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:51,870
subservient United States Congress,
where practically nobody -

998
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:55,070
in the entire Congress stood up
and said, no, they've already -

999
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:58,380
passed a law saying all their drivers'
licenses are gonna be chipped.

1000
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,210
Well I'm telling you right now,
I am not gonna carry any driver's -

1001
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:05,920
license that's got a chip in it,
so big brother can watch everywhere -

1002
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:13,730
I go and see everything I do. No!
No! Hell no! No to all of it. No! No!

1003
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:20,970
We the people own this plot of ground.
We the people own those trees there.

1004
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:27,240
We the people own our beautiful Texas,
and we are not going to let -

1005
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:33,910
a bunch of crooks and robber barons
take our beautiful Texas away from us.

1006
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:41,390
Hell no! Thank you.
Hell no! No! No! No!

1007
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:49,930
RFID tracker chips embedded
in State Inspection Stickers and -

1008
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,730
Toll Tags are already being
used to track the population.

1009
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,370
The new system is also supposed
to control growth and steer development, -

1010
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:02,710
or so-called 'smart growth'. Smart
growth which is nothing more than -

1011
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:06,640
an effort to bring control into the
cities. You have the rewilding of -

1012
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,180
America in the Wildlands Project,
the Convention on Biological Diversity, -

1013
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:13,280
which is to control or
rule the population.

1014
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:17,720
Toll roads on interstate highways
nation-wide are walling off -

1015
01:15:17,850 --> 01:15:22,130
exit ramps to small towns and
rural communities and are creating -

1016
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:27,000
ghost-towns by design. This trend
is accelerating under the -

1017
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:32,000
NAFTA highway system and is meant to
re-wild more than half the country.

1018
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:35,370
All of these things are designed
to bring more and more control -

1019
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:39,210
to bureaucracies rather than
to the independent individual, -

1020
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:41,680
the sovereignty individual
of this nation.

1021
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,550
What brought me into this whole
discussion was the fact that, -

1022
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:47,450
while I was doing this multi-million
dollar research effort in the -

1023
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:52,720
1980s and early 1990s, I became
aware of an agenda basically to -

1024
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:55,290
lock up one half of the
United States into wilderness -

1025
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:58,400
corridors and reserves. It was
called the Wildlands Project, -

1026
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,500
but it was also a key cornerstone
of the United Nations -

1027
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:05,170
convention on Biological Diversity.
It was during that study -

1028
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:09,040
in which I began to realize that
this was not an effort to -

1029
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,910
protect the environment, but an
effort to control you and I.

1030
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:15,180
They were dividing the Unites
States up into little compartments -

1031
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:18,150
in which they would rip out roads,
which they would rip out -

1032
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:20,250
whole communities and put them
back in the wilderness.

1033
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:26,360
The federal highway system was
designed by Pentagon war planners -

1034
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:31,030
in the 1950s to serve as a rapid
deployment conduit to move ground -

1035
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:35,170
forces for the defense of the
United States during invasion.

1036
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,170
The unconstitutional Northern Command
is now using the highway system -

1037
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:45,710
as a Force Projection Matrix,
to dominate populations across -

1038
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:50,250
the United States. Through federally
funded Emergency Command Centers, -

1039
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:55,050
county and city governments are
being quietly federalized nation-wide.

1040
01:16:56,610 --> 01:17:00,490
Billions of dollars per city is
being spent to install millions of -

1041
01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:04,430
surveillance cameras. Every town
and hamlet, no matter how -

1042
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:09,330
small or remote, is surveilled.
License plate reading software -

1043
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:14,340
tracks American movements wherever
they go. New systems are being -

1044
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:20,250
deployed that scan your face,
read your lips and analyze your walk.

1045
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:25,050
Under the treasonous Military
Commissions Act, American citizens -

1046
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:29,550
can be secretly arrested, stripped
of citizenship, flown to offshore -

1047
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:35,590
torture camps and secretly executed.
Under section 802 of the -

1048
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:39,530
Patriot Act, all misdemeanors
are considered terrorism.

1049
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:45,970
Federal Police Squads called VIPER
Teams randomly force Americans to -

1050
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:50,040
line up and show their papers.
From the sidewalks of Miami, -

1051
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:54,080
to the subways of New York,
to the streets of Houston, Texas, -

1052
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:59,950
citizens are being searched by heavily
armed gangs of paramilitary police.

1053
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,360
New York City / Sept 2006

1054
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:07,760
Where's the vehicle? We're supposed to...
Come on guys, come here.

1055
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,100
Yo, yo, can you get that
camera off of us, sir?

1056
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:13,130
Sir, can you...

1057
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:15,000
It's the United States
1st Amendment.

1058
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,670
You can get that camera...
I'm saying get that -

1059
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,140
camera out of my face.
That's what I'm saying.

1060
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,340
No, no, you're on the
streets of New York.

1061
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,670
Sir, what does that mean,
I'm saying get that -

1062
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,940
camera out of my face,
that's what I'm saying.

1063
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,310
No! No! It's a free country.

1064
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,510
What the Fuck is wrong
with you people, man.

1065
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,410
It's a free country.

1066
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:26,510
Get this damn camera out of my face.

1067
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,350
Well this isn't Nazi Germany,
there's no camera in you face.

1068
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,950
Hey, move to Russia, OK.

1069
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:35,000
Sarge, sarge.

1070
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,220
We can have cameras on the streets.

1071
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,720
Look, I said get it out of my face.

1072
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:39,020
Your guy starts cussing at us..

1073
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:40,760
I said get it out of my face,
that's what I'm saying.

1074
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,530
It was never in your face.

1075
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:48,500
Yo

1076
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,670
Long before 9/11 the Pentagon
was aggressively violating -

1077
01:18:54,800 --> 01:19:00,710
federal law that bars the military
from policing the American people.

1078
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:05,580
Coast to coast, for more than 2
decades, teams of troops would just -

1079
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:11,220
appear out of nowhere and randomly
stop cars and search pedestrians.

1080
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:15,730
The acclamation accelerated with
regular armies searching bags at the -

1081
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:20,830
superbowl and the Kentucky Derby,
as well as other high profile events.

1082
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,900
Then President Bush signed a Defense
Authorization Act which radically -

1083
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:28,970
increased the funding for the
already bloated shadow government.

1084
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:33,450
In the Act, the Executive Branch
formally announced that it was -

1085
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,280
preparing for domestic insurrection,
and went on to preemptively strip -

1086
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,220
the State Governors and
Legislators of their powers.

1087
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:46,390
The federal government is openly
announcing that it is the only authority, -

1088
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:53,570
as it treats the people and the States
as enemies. Then on May 9th, 2007, -

1089
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:58,040
President Bush unlawfully
granted himself new powers, -

1090
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:03,680
and the Presidency officially
became a Fiat Dictatorship.

1091
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:08,710
In the past, Continuity of Government
has been shared of the Legislative, -

1092
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:13,350
Judicial and Executive branches
of government. Now, all power -

1093
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:18,790
resides with the President. For
the smallest of reasons including,

1094
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:24,900
in the documents own text: any incident
in the world regardless of location, -

1095
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:30,400
that affects population, infrastructure,
environment, economy or -

1096
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,210
government functions can trigger,
at the Presidents own will, -

1097
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:40,550
total Martial Law. It is important to
add that the President is merely a -

1098
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:44,720
puppet of the global crime syndicate
and may not use the new powers, -

1099
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:51,290
but simply pass them on for use
by future puppet administrations.

1100
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:41,740
You must teach people to love their
leader. This is the only most important.

1101
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:50,820
Why don't we learn from the
mistakes of our ancestors.

1102
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:58,020
Why does human kind find itself bound
in a cycle of bloodshed and enslavement.

1103
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:03,930
Predatory elites have always
rationalized their oppression by -

1104
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:08,200
claiming that they are superior
and have the divine right to rule, -

1105
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:12,170
when all they really are is a
gaggle of ruthless psychopaths, -

1106
01:22:12,290 --> 01:22:16,370
parasitically feeding on the host
population until their cancerous -

1107
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:22,150
movement causes the collapse of the
host. There have been thousands of -

1108
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:27,520
tyrannical governments in history and less
than 10 that can truly be called free.

1109
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:33,160
In the 20th century alone,
over 150 million people were -

1110
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:38,530
murdered at the hands of the State.
In Russia, the Red Terror -

1111
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:43,800
consumed the lives of more than
60 million, men women and children.

1112
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:49,840
Hitlers war killed 22 million.
During Mao Tse Tung reign alone -

1113
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:54,850
more than 60 million peasant
farmers were killed, and the -

1114
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:00,650
list goes on. 300,000 innocent
civilians killed in Guatemala.

1115
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:06,560
More than 2 million souls brutally
murdered by the government of Cambodia.

1116
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:12,860
1,500,000 killed in Turkey.
300,000 in Uganda.

1117
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:18,170
800,000+ hacked to death
with machetes in Rwanda.

1118
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:22,970
Sadly, there are too many examples
of innocent families being

1119
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:28,080
exterminated by their governments,
on an industrial scale, to name them all.

1120
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:33,890
It is a historical fact that the
State is the n°1 cause of unnatural death.

1121
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:40,530
If you take the 150 million people
killed by power-mad government -

1122
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:45,960
in the last century and divide it
by 100,000, the number of souls lost -

1123
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:50,900
would fill the biggest sports stadium,
packed with 100,000 screaming fans, -

1124
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:58,480
1,500 times over. That's 1,500
sports stadiums crammed with -

1125
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:04,920
100,000 people each - all exterminated.
For those who think -

1126
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,420
it can't happen here or wont happen
to them - you have been warned.

1127
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:13,930
The carnage witnessed in the
last 100 years was only -

1128
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:17,900
the preparatory phase of the
New World Order's Master Plan.

1129
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:33,980
Hitler and Stalin's crimes are
now part of history but the Communist -

1130
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:37,580
Chinese system of evil is not
content with racking up the highest -

1131
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:39,680
death toll in history.

1132
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:46,520
The mass murder and enslavement
is still going on today and enjoys -

1133
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:49,990
the full support and sanction
of the New World Order.

1134
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,240
Communist China serves as a globalist
laboratory - a proving ground, -

1135
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:09,880
where 1.4 billion live out their
lives as guinea pigs who serve as -

1136
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:13,790
test subjects for the formulation
of the brave new world.

1137
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:18,190
U.S. and British forces worked
closely with Mao Tse Tung during -

1138
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:21,260
World War II and at the end of
the war they secretly backed -

1139
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:26,770
Mao in driving out Chiang Kai-shek,
the Nationalist, the O.S.S. and -

1140
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,000
then the C.I.A. believed that Mao
would have a stabilizing effect.

1141
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:37,910
Bill Clinton's mentor and Georgetown
University Political Science Professor, -

1142
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:41,150
Carroll Quigley explained
in his book, Tragedy & Hope, -

1143
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:45,080
how the Anglo-American roundtable
groups backed every brand of -

1144
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:49,590
authoritarianism, from Communism to
Fascism, to ensure that a centralized -

1145
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:53,220
government dominates the population,
and the economy is planned.

1146
01:25:56,950 --> 01:26:01,130
The elite are monopoly men.
They seek to create monopolies and -

1147
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:04,240
dominate the populations
through the barrel of a gun.

1148
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:09,040
In their writings, the leadership
of the New World Order has -

1149
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,310
continuously heaped praise on the
corrupt Communist Chinese model.

1150
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:22,220
In August Of 1973, in an article
written by David Rockefeller -

1151
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:25,890
for the New York Times, Rockefeller
openly lauds and endorses -

1152
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:30,130
Mao Tse Tung's actions whilst celebrating
their command and control system.

1153
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,830
"Whatever the price of the
Chinese Revolution it has obviously -

1154
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:38,170
succeeded not only in producing
more efficient and dedicated -

1155
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:42,270
administration, but also in fostering
high morale and community of purpose.

1156
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,080
The social experiment in China
under Chairman Mao's leadership -

1157
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:49,280
is one of the most important
and successful in history."

1158
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:54,450
~David Rockefeller
New York Times, August 10, 1973

1159
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:02,590
Communist China is the Model Planned
Society for the New World Order.

1160
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:07,500
China has received more United
Nations Awards for it's policies -

1161
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:11,870
and form of governance than any
other nation. In the eyes of -

1162
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:16,370
globalist planners, authoritarian
China is the future.

1163
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:20,810
China adopted the dreaded 'one child'
policy due to lobbying from -

1164
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:24,380
a consortium of eugenics
organizations, which includes: -

1165
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:30,420
Planned Parenthood and the United
Nations. Couples that have more than -

1166
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:36,430
one child face heavy fines and imprisonment.
The practice of forced abortion -

1167
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:40,870
in China coupled with the cultural
desire to have a male child, has plunged -

1168
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:46,740
China into a deepening crisis where
there are 30 million more men than women.

1169
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:53,680
The Chinese Police State ruthlessly
crushed all forms of dissent.

1170
01:27:54,970 --> 01:28:00,890
Underground churches, Falun Gong
practitioners, striking factory workers,

1171
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:06,290
are all sent to Forced Labor Camps.
Their blood and tissue types are -

1172
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:14,130
cataloged in preparation for organ
harvesting. The Chinese Government -

1173
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:21,710
then sells the prisoners organs to
the highest bidder on the world market.

1174
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,580
If a wealthy patient chooses to
fly into China, the prisoner is -

1175
01:28:29,740 --> 01:28:34,520
killed and the organs are implanted.
If the organs are being -

1176
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:38,790
flown out of the country, a mobile
execution van extracts the organs -

1177
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:41,260
on the way to the waiting aircraft.

1178
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:51,070
The social engineers of China
aggressively euthanize the elderly and -

1179
01:28:51,190 --> 01:28:56,500
disabled. China is merely following
the globalist blueprint for the world.

1180
01:28:56,970 --> 01:29:02,810
The same system of total dehumanization
is quietly being phased in world-wide.

1181
01:29:04,770 --> 01:29:08,290
"Depopulation should be the
highest priority of foreign policy -

1182
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:12,420
towards the Third World."
~Henry Kissinger, 1974

1183
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:18,260
Now, there's a need for a
New World Order, but it has -

1184
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:24,170
different characteristics in
different parts of the world.

1185
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:29,270
Now, none of this may succeed this
time. But this to me is sort of the -

1186
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:38,480
outline by which some day, in the
next few years, a solution will emerge.

1187
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:42,920
Where does this mindset come from?
Why do the elites kill the -

1188
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:47,630
largest masses of people when no
one is resisting them - when they've -

1189
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:53,770
already attained total control. What
ideology drives the elite psychopath?

1190
01:29:56,090 --> 01:30:00,570
Since Plato's time 2,400 years
ago, State planners have openly -

1191
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:04,980
proclaimed their desire to control
every detail of the commoners life.

1192
01:30:05,130 --> 01:30:08,950
From breeding programs to massive
extermination of undesirables, -

1193
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:12,420
the dark dream has continued
on for millennia.

1194
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:14,880
Eugenics

1195
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
"is the study of the agencies
under social control, that improve -

1196
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,400
or impair the racial qualities
of future generations either -

1197
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,800
physically or mentally."
~Sir Francis Galton

1198
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:26,000
The scientific rational for tyranny
has always been attractive to -

1199
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:30,200
elites because it creates a
convenient excuse for treating -

1200
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:35,240
their fellow man as lower than
animals. Robert Thomas Malthus, -

1201
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,940
famous for saying that a mass
food collapse would be helpful -

1202
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,610
because it would wipe out the poor.
His fictional scenario -

1203
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:48,020
would later be called a Malthusian
Catastrophe. Malthus is important -

1204
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:52,890
because his ideas led to the
rise of the new scientific field -

1205
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:58,000
that would dominate the course of
human history for the next 200+ years.

1206
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,740
Charles Darwin, an admirer of the
Malthusian Catastrophe Model, -

1207
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:07,840
developed the theory of evolution,
it's chief tenant being the -

1208
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:12,140
survival of the fittest. With the
help of T. H. Huxley, known as -

1209
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:15,680
Darwin's bulldog for his strong
support of Darwin's theories, -

1210
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:19,120
Darwin's theories were pushed
into wide acceptance among key -

1211
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,690
scientific circles throughout
England and then the world.

1212
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:27,390
Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton,
credited as the father of Eugenics, -

1213
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:32,000
saw an opportunity to advance mankind
by taking the reigns of Darwin's -

1214
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:37,200
evolution theory and applied social
principles to develop Social Darwinism.

1215
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:42,370
The families, Darwin, Galton,
Huxley and Wedgwood were so -

1216
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:46,180
obsessed with their new social
design theory that they pledged: -

1217
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,680
their families would only
breed with each other.

1218
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:54,020
They falsely predicted that
within only a few generations, -

1219
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:56,350
they would produce supermen.

1220
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:03,260
The emerging pseudoscience was only
codifying the practice of inbreeding, -

1221
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:09,200
already popular within elites for
millennia. The 4 family's experiment -

1222
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:14,670
was a disaster. Within only 2
generations of inbreeding, close to 90% -

1223
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:19,040
of their offspring either died at
birth or were seriously mentally -

1224
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:23,310
or physically handicapped. The monied
classes of the planet, and -

1225
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,720
particularly the Royal families of
the world [who] were already obsessed -

1226
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:29,950
with breeding and filled with a
predatory disdain for the underclass, -

1227
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:35,230
seized on the new science and began
aggressively enforcing it's aims world-wide.

1228
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,770
Biometrics appears to be a new science,
but it was actually developed by -

1229
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:49,210
Galton back in the 1870s as a way
to track racial traits and -

1230
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:54,180
genetic histories, and as a way to
decide who would be licensed to breed.

1231
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:59,120
In 1904 the Cold Spring's Harbor
Research facility was started -

1232
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:02,550
in the United States by eugenicist
Charles Davenport, with the -

1233
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:06,460
funding of prominent robber barons,
Carnegie, Rockefeller and Harriman.

1234
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:13,630
In 1907 the 1st sterilization laws
were passed in the United States.

1235
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:17,270
Citizens with mild deformities
or low test scores on their -

1236
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:21,310
report cards were arrested
and forcibly sterilized.

1237
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:23,310
You're 17, aren't you, Alice?

1238
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:26,040
Yes, but what have
you done with my folks.

1239
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,510
Well we're trying to help
them, Alice, and you too.

1240
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,320
They were taken to the
hospital this afternoon.

1241
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,820
Hospital! Wasn't none of
them sick this morning.

1242
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:37,690
We thought it necessary to present
your family's case to the State

1243
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:41,630
Medical Commission, and after an
examination they decided that there

1244
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:47,130
was but one important action to take to
have your entire family sterilized.

1245
01:33:47,290 --> 01:33:50,040
Well what's that? I don't know
what you're taking about!

1246
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:53,470
Well, in this State we have a
law which provides for such

1247
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,440
people to have an operation so
there wont be any more children.

1248
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,880
I see.

1249
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,150
Now then, we'll take your brothers
to institutions where they'll

1250
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:04,080
be properly cared for. And you
can go back to your job too.

1251
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:06,450
I'll arranged to have
it held open for you.

1252
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:09,320
But I'm keeping my job!
I'm not going anywhere.

1253
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:11,990
Now you're going to the
hospital too, Alice.

1254
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:15,390
And you mean there going to stop
me from having children ever.

1255
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,560
Exactly.

1256
01:34:18,050 --> 01:34:20,500
I'm alright, I tell you.
I wont go to any hospital.

1257
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:22,470
We don't want any trouble
with you, young woman.

1258
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:25,440
If you refuse to go the officer
here will take you by force.

1259
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:30,380
In 1910, the U.S. Eugenics
Record Office was set up.

1260
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:34,380
By then the British had created
the 1st network of social workers, -

1261
01:34:34,540 --> 01:34:39,320
expressly to serve as spies and
enforcers of the Eugenics Race Cult -

1262
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:43,050
that was rapidly taking control
of Western society.

1263
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:47,690
The social workers would decide who
would have their children taken away, -

1264
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:53,430
who would be sterilized, and in some
cases, who would be quietly murdered.

1265
01:35:03,570 --> 01:35:07,580
In 1911, the Rockefeller family
exports Eugenics to Germany by -

1266
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:11,520
bankrolling the Kaiser Wilhelm
Institute which later would form a -

1267
01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:14,890
central pillar in the 3rd Reich.

1268
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:19,320
At the 1912 International Eugenics
Conference in London, Eugenics becomes -

1269
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:24,900
an international craze and gains
superstar status. The futurist and -

1270
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:29,830
bestselling sci-fi author H. G. Wells
had studied biology under top -

1271
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:34,010
eugenicists, and was spreading
the new faith world-wide.

1272
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:40,080
In 1916, H. G. Wells's lover, Margaret
Sanger, starts her promotion of -

1273
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:46,050
eugenics in the United States. In 1923,
Sanger receives massive funding -

1274
01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:51,720
from the Rockefeller family.
Sanger wrote to fellow eugenicist

1275
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:56,230
Clarence J. Gamble that black leaders
would need to be recruited to act -

1276
01:35:56,350 --> 01:36:00,930
as frontmen in sterilization programs
directed against black communities.

1277
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:06,710
In 1924, Hitler pens 'Mein Kampf'
(or 'My Struggle') and credits -

1278
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:12,610
U.S. eugenicists as his inspiration.
Hitler even wrote a fan letter -

1279
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:17,580
to American eugenicist and
conservationist, Madison Grant, -

1280
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:22,390
calling his race-based book,
'The Passing of the Great Race', his bible.

1281
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:26,520
Hitler developed the plan for mass
extermination of the Jews, -

1282
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:30,500
and what he called other sub-races
as well as the handicapped, -

1283
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:36,230
from [Madison] Grant. By 1927,
Eugenics hit the mainstream.

1284
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:40,370
The so-called science was aggressively
pushed through contests at schools, -

1285
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:46,310
churches and at State fairs. Churches
competed in contest with big -

1286
01:36:46,530 --> 01:36:51,520
cash prizes to see who could best
implement eugenics into their sermons.

1287
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:57,320
Major denominations then tell
Americans that Jesus is for Eugenics.

1288
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:04,460
That same year in the United
States more than 25 States passed -

1289
01:37:04,550 --> 01:37:09,170
'for sterilization' laws and the
Supreme Court ruled in favor of -

1290
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:14,510
brutal sterilization policies. When
Hitler came to power, in 1933, -

1291
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:19,080
one of his 1st acts was to pass
national eugenics laws modeled -

1292
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:21,910
after laws in the United States.

1293
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:31,920
The 1934 film, 'Tomorrows Children',
brought the eugenics -

1294
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:35,190
agenda to the Silver Screen
in the United States.

1295
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:37,660
In the case of Miss Mason,
I can see no reason for the -

1296
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:40,670
operation that's been recommended.
The girl is perfectly normal.

1297
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:43,000
She's hard working and
has a good reputation.

1298
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:45,240
Do you know anything about
her family background?

1299
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:46,540
Well, yes, your honor. I do.

1300
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:48,440
There are several other
children, aren't there?

1301
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:48,940
Yes.

1302
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:50,140
What is their condition?

1303
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:54,880
One is a cripple, 2 others might
be classed as feeble-minded.

1304
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,720
Isn't the oldest son in jail?

1305
01:37:56,870 --> 01:37:58,250
Well, yes. I believe so.

1306
01:37:58,470 --> 01:38:01,320
And knowing all that, you still
contend that this girl should -

1307
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,560
be allowed to bring more people
like that into the world?

1308
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:06,690
She's sound, your honor. She's
not anything like the rest.

1309
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:10,160
Surely she should be given a chance
to work out her own salvation?

1310
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:13,000
I can't agree with you, Doctor.
Suppose she is normal, -

1311
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:16,430
the chances are that her children
will inherit the family taint, -

1312
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:19,140
isn't that possible?
But your honor I...

1313
01:38:19,330 --> 01:38:25,910
I'm sorry, Doctor. 3 Generations of
unfit are enough. Petition not allowed.

1314
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:31,620
By 1936, Germany had become the
world leader in Eugenics for taking -

1315
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:37,690
effective actions to sterilize and euthanize
hundreds of thousands of victims.

1316
01:38:38,810 --> 01:38:42,790
The big 3 of American Eugenics,
Davenport, Laughlin and Goethe -

1317
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:46,430
were dispatched by the Rockefellers
to Germany where they advised -

1318
01:38:46,550 --> 01:38:49,630
the Nazis on the fine-tuning of
their extermination system.

1319
01:38:50,990 --> 01:38:55,010
With the strong support of the U.S.
and England, Germany had gone -

1320
01:38:55,160 --> 01:39:00,250
over the edge and tens of millions
would pay with their lives.

1321
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,920
At the end of the war, the allies
protected from prosecution the -

1322
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:11,890
very Nazi scientist that had
tortured thousands of people to death.

1323
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:18,430
The Nazi brand of Eugenics had
embarrassed the elites but they had -

1324
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:24,140
no intention of stopping their
plans. The allies literally fought -

1325
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:27,840
with each other over who would
get top Nazi eugenicists.

1326
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:30,480
It didn't matter if the S.S.
Doctors had tortured -

1327
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:33,510
tens of thousands to death,
they were free to go.

1328
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:39,820
The angel of death, Josef Mengele and
his boss Otmar von Verschuer were not -

1329
01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:45,390
prosecuted and von Verschuer even continued
his work in Germany after the war.

1330
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:49,730
Eugenicists were angry that their
great work had been exposed.

1331
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:53,400
They then scrambled to
camouflage their agenda.

1332
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:56,530
Eugenics Quarterly became
Social Biology.

1333
01:39:57,230 --> 01:40:00,710
The American Birth Control League
became Planned Parenthood.

1334
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:07,510
New terms like Transhumanism,
Population Control, Sustainability,

1335
01:40:07,870 --> 01:40:14,050
Conservation and Environmentalism replaced
Racial Hygiene and Social Darwinism.

1336
01:40:18,950 --> 01:40:24,760
Many eugenicists of the previous period
engaged in what they called crypto-eugenics.

1337
01:40:25,290 --> 01:40:29,630
Purposefully taking their eugenics
beliefs underground, they became highly -

1338
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:35,440
respected anthropologists, biologists
and geneticists in the post-war world.

1339
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:44,780
The allies then smuggled thousands
of Nazi scientists out of Germany -

1340
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:49,520
and placed them in key scientific
positions ranging from bioweapons -

1341
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:53,190
to rocketry throughout the
Military Industrial Complex.

1342
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:58,600
The founder of I.B.M. was
a devout follower of Hitler.

1343
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,240
Thomas J. Watson had supplied
his punch card computers -

1344
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:08,610
and I.B.M. technicians to the
Nazis for use in the death camps.

1345
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:15,880
Tattoos on camp victims were IBM human
ID numbers which fed into the computers.

1346
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:22,690
IBM had used similar systems as early
as 1928 in a Jamaican Race Mixing Study.

1347
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:29,960
The first real computers were literally
invented by a eugenicist for Eugenics.

1348
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:37,640
UN chieftain and unrepentant eugenicist,
Julian Huxley, argued that -

1349
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:40,470
since the leaders of eugenics had
founded the environmental and -

1350
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:44,180
conservation movements, that they
should be used as vehicles in the -

1351
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:49,410
formation of a world government.
Just as H. G. Wells had envisioned, -

1352
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:54,150
this government would be controlled
by a scientific dictatorship

1353
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:59,320
and would be guided by the principles
of Eugenics. Huxley created -

1354
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:03,400
the World Wildlife Fund with
Bilderberg founder, and former S.S. -

1355
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:09,270
Officer, Prince Bernard (Netherlands)
& Prince Philip (England).

1356
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:15,010
In the event that I am reincarnated,
I would like to return as a deadly virus, -

1357
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:18,380
in order to contribute something
to solve overpopulation.

1358
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:19,880
~Prince Philip

1359
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,950
Reported by Deutsche
Press Agentur (DPA)

1360
01:42:23,270 --> 01:42:25,280
August 1988

1361
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:30,620
Aldous Huxley, author of 'Brave New
World', and brother of Julian Huxley, -

1362
01:42:30,710 --> 01:42:35,230
gave a speech at Berkeley in 1962
shortly before his death.

1363
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:41,600
He admitted that his bestselling book,
'Brave New World', written in 1932, -

1364
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:46,710
was based not on fiction but on what
the elite were planning to implement.

1365
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:58,950
And here I would like briefly to
compare the parable 'Brave New World' -

1366
01:42:59,210 --> 01:43:03,960
with another parable which was
put forth more recently in -

1367
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:11,600
George Orwell's book '1984'.
I'm inclined to think that the -

1368
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:16,370
scientific dictatorships of the
future, and I think there are -

1369
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:19,740
going to be scientific dictatorships
in many parts of the world, -

1370
01:43:20,030 --> 01:43:24,640
will be probably a good deal nearer
to the 'Brave New World' pattern -

1371
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:29,140
than to the '1984' pattern. They
will be a good deal nearer -

1372
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:34,190
not because of any humanitarian
qualms in the scientific dictators -

1373
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:38,720
but simply because the 'Brave New
World' pattern is probably -

1374
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:43,330
a good deal more efficient than the
other. But if you can get people -

1375
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:47,500
to consent to the state of affairs
in which they are living, -

1376
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:51,170
the state of servitude, the state
of being, well, it seems to me -

1377
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:55,740
that the nature of the ultimate
revolution with which we are now faced -

1378
01:43:55,900 --> 01:44:00,650
is precisely this - that we are
in the process of developing -

1379
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:07,520
a whole series of techniques which
will enable the controlling oligarchy, -

1380
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:12,620
who have always existed and will
presumably always will exist, -

1381
01:44:12,810 --> 01:44:20,570
to get people actually to love
their servitude. People can be made -

1382
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:27,870
to enjoy a state of affairs
which by any decent standard they -

1383
01:44:28,030 --> 01:44:35,880
ought not to enjoy, and these methods,
I think, are a real refinement -

1384
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:41,500
on the older methods of terror because
they combine methods of terror -

1385
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:44,600
with methods of acceptance.

1386
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:48,560
Well, then there are the various
other methods one can of, -

1387
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:52,900
there is for example the pharmacological
method, this was one -

1388
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:59,140
of the things I talked about in
'Brave New World' and the result -

1389
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:06,110
would be that...you can imagine
a euphoric which would make people -

1390
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:10,150
thoroughly happy, even in the
most abominable circumstances, -

1391
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:13,520
I mean, these things are possible.

1392
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:23,430
The elite have left a massive wave
of destruction behind them as they -

1393
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:29,600
coldbloodedly experiment on civilian
populations as if we are lab-rats.

1394
01:45:30,330 --> 01:45:33,870
A string of congressional
investigations have uncovered -

1395
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,210
more than 20,000 secret tests
that were carried out -

1396
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:40,980
against the American people
between 1910 and 2000.

1397
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:47,820
One well known eugenics study,
the Tuskegee syphilis project, -

1398
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:51,420
killed hundreds of blacks and
spanned 40 years until -

1399
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:54,860
whistleblowers exposed it in 1972.

1400
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:58,760
From 1943 until present
the British have tested -

1401
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:03,230
lethal nerve gas on their own
personnel on land, air and sea.

1402
01:46:03,430 --> 01:46:09,240
Many died instantly. Others died
grooling deaths over several years.

1403
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:13,980
The federal government commissioned
secret radiationing experiments -

1404
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:19,020
on 1,000s of non-consenting patients.
100s of hospitals in the US -

1405
01:46:19,170 --> 01:46:23,790
injected healthy men, women and
children with uranium and plutonium -

1406
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:28,090
at dosage levels ranging from
non therapeutic to lethal, -

1407
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:30,730
killing many of the test subjects.

1408
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:37,800
Pregnant wives of G.I.s were given
vitamins by armybase doctors that -

1409
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:43,710
actually consisted of highly radioactive
uranium 239 and plutonium 241 -

1410
01:46:43,870 --> 01:46:48,210
resulting in violent miscarriages
and the death of the mothers.

1411
01:46:57,350 --> 01:47:00,730
Soldiers, sailors and marines
were used as guinea pigs -

1412
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:03,830
in 100s of atomic and hydrogen
bomb tests.

1413
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:10,740
Patriotic Americans were radiated,
side by side, with lab-animals.

1414
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:29,790
Pilots were forced to repeatedly fly through
mushroom clouds of DNA destroying radiation.

1415
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:49,970
From 1951 to 1961 the U.S. Army
paid Israel's health ministry -

1416
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:54,910
3 million lira to conduct radiation
testing on Sephardic children -

1417
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:56,510
that immigrated to Israel.

1418
01:47:57,370 --> 01:48:01,020
The government-run public schools
would tell the children that they -

1419
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:04,920
were going to get a medical check-up
and that were receiving an x-ray.

1420
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:21,010
The Pentagon had already radiated
more than 4,000 institutionalized -

1421
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:24,810
children in the United States,
many of which had died.

1422
01:48:25,530 --> 01:48:30,250
More than 110,000 of the darker
skinned Jews were given -

1423
01:48:30,410 --> 01:48:35,420
35,000 times the maximum dose of
x-rays to the head - repeatedly.

1424
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:39,720
Many of the children died within
months. All of them lost their hair.

1425
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:44,130
Some still live today and endure
excruciating health problems.

1426
01:48:46,450 --> 01:48:50,400
The covert testing of chemical,
biological and radiological agents -

1427
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:54,070
on unsuspecting populations
continues world-wide today.

1428
01:48:54,830 --> 01:48:59,140
From 1940 to 1979 the vast
majority of the British population -

1429
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:03,280
was sprayed by aircraft more
than 2,000 times with deadly -

1430
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:06,990
chemicals and micro-organisms
without ever being told.

1431
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:12,520
In 1968, the Pentagon tested a
deadly bioweapon on New York Subways -

1432
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:17,430
and placed personnel at local
hospitals to monitor the effects.

1433
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:21,000
Aggressive sterilization
of men and women -

1434
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:24,100
continued in many States
until the mid 1980s.

1435
01:49:25,390 --> 01:49:28,370
The United States and England
are currently testing pesticides -

1436
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,840
and highly toxic experimental drugs
on 10s of 1,000s of healthy -

1437
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,920
foster children, many of which die
as a result of the experiments.

1438
01:49:38,010 --> 01:49:41,390
Prisons across the nation have
forced inmates to participate in -

1439
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:45,290
grizzly experiments ranging from
pesticide studies to having tablets -

1440
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,430
of dioxin sewn into their backs.

1441
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:51,560
"Gradually, by selective breeding,
the congenital differences -

1442
01:49:51,690 --> 01:49:54,800
between rulers and ruled will
increase until they become -

1443
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,570
almost different species.

1444
01:49:56,730 --> 01:49:59,840
A revolt of the plebs would become
as unthinkable as an organized -

1445
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:03,040
insurrection of sheep against the
practice of eating mutton."

1446
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,140
~Bertrand Russel

1447
01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:09,810
H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley,
Bertrand Russel and 100s of other -

1448
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:13,350
eugenicists constantly bragged
about how the establishment -

1449
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:16,690
believe themselves to be a separate,
more advanced species -

1450
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:21,130
than the common man. Top eugenicists
were bold enough to admit -

1451
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,800
their real goal was not improving
the hereditary of the commoner -

1452
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:29,330
but to further dumb them down so
that they could be more manageable.

1453
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:33,470
Nobel prize winner, Russel, wrote
at length about how vaccinations -

1454
01:50:33,630 --> 01:50:37,340
filled with mercury, and other
brain damaging compounds would induce -

1455
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:41,910
partial, chemical lobotomies, and
develop a servile zombie population.

1456
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:45,950
"Diet, injections, and injunctions
will combine, from a very early age, -

1457
01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:49,750
to produce the sort of character
and the sort of beliefs that the -

1458
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:51,520
authorities consider desirable, -

1459
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:54,630
and any serious criticism of
the powers that be will become -

1460
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:57,130
psychologically impossible."
~Bertrand Russel

1461
01:50:57,250 --> 01:50:58,630
The Impact of Science on Society

1462
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:02,830
Over a hundred years ago eugenicist
social planners said that -

1463
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:06,370
they'd use mind-altering drugs
to control the population.

1464
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:12,580
By 2007, more than 20% of the
US population were on some type -

1465
01:51:12,770 --> 01:51:15,610
of prescription anti-depressant.

1466
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:18,850
But in the case of foster children, -

1467
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:23,290
a sector where the state has total
control, at least 66% are forced -

1468
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:28,590
to take a cocktail made up of,
on average, 7 psychotropic drugs.

1469
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:33,830
Chairmen of the Society of
Psychiatric Physicians, Joe Burkett, -

1470
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:37,140
testified before the State House
Select Committee hearing on -

1471
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:40,740
psychotropic drugs in foster
care and shocked the public -

1472
01:51:40,830 --> 01:51:44,440
when he said that 66% of the foster
children in Texas had -

1473
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:47,850
been placed on psychiatric drugs
because they were -

1474
01:51:47,970 --> 01:51:51,550
very, very sick from a bad gene pool.

1475
01:51:52,110 --> 01:51:55,420
A lot of these kids come from
bad gene pools. They don't have -

1476
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:59,620
stable parents making good
decisions. Besides the gene pools, -

1477
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:02,490
they've been traumatized by
abuse, neglect and problems, -

1478
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:04,400
and then they've been
traumatized by separation, -

1479
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:06,400
and all those things
predispose to mental illness. -

1480
01:52:07,020 --> 01:52:11,040
The western world is now implementing
eugenics precrime policies.

1481
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:15,010
Foetuses are now being prescreened
according to family histories of crime, -

1482
01:52:15,660 --> 01:52:19,680
from Portland, Oregon to London,
England, child protective services -

1483
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:23,180
are enrolling newborn children
into criminal databases at birth -

1484
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:27,320
and forcing them to attend
probation hearings at age 2.

1485
01:52:28,110 --> 01:52:32,660
The overlords of scientific
dictatorship are ruthlessly prosecuting -

1486
01:52:32,850 --> 01:52:39,930
a war on our most defenseless.
In December of 1974, the US government -

1487
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:44,470
made 3rd World population reduction
a central national security issue.

1488
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:49,640
The operation plan titled:
National Security Study Memorandum 200, -

1489
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:53,510
was simply a regurgitation of
the British Commission on Population, -

1490
01:52:53,770 --> 01:52:58,520
created by King George VI of
England in 1944, which openly -

1491
01:52:58,670 --> 01:53:02,690
stated that populous 3rd World
nations posed a threat

1492
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:06,320
to the international elite's
monopoly of global power.

1493
01:53:06,750 --> 01:53:11,030
The Kissinger-authored U.S.
plan targeted 13 key countries -

1494
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:14,330
where massive population
reduction was called for.

1495
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:18,070
Kissinger recommended that
I.M.F. and World Bank loans be -

1496
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:21,340
given on condition that
nations initiate aggressive -

1497
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:24,980
population control programs
such as sterilization.

1498
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:29,280
Kissinger also recommended that
food be used as a weapon and -

1499
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:34,020
that instigating wars was also a
helpful tool in reducing population.

1500
01:53:35,410 --> 01:53:40,460
In 1972, the Nixon White House
also implemented a eugenics policy -

1501
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:43,260
which was directed by George
Herbert Walker Bush, -

1502
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:46,360
then United States Ambassador
to the United Nations.

1503
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:50,170
Bush advised China on the formulation
of their one child policy,

1504
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:53,370
and directed the federal government
to forcibly sterilize -

1505
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:57,410
more than 40% of Native American
women on reservations.

1506
01:53:59,070 --> 01:54:03,350
The Bilderberg-dominated Club of
Rome advocated environmentalism -

1507
01:54:03,470 --> 01:54:07,120
as the best front to implement
population reduction.

1508
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:13,220
Western populations would
accept serphtum if it was -

1509
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:15,830
packaged as saving the Earth.

1510
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:26,740
Industrialization of Africa, Asia
and Latin America could be blocked.

1511
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:31,180
Citizens would more willingly give
up their National Sovereignty -

1512
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:34,250
if it were sold as a way
to help the planet.

1513
01:54:34,570 --> 01:54:38,150
The thinktank [Club of Rome]
also concocted the peak-oil fraud -

1514
01:54:38,310 --> 01:54:42,520
as a way to create artificial
scarcity and The Club of Rome -

1515
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:45,890
has been aggressively pushing
a Global Carbon Tax -

1516
01:54:46,050 --> 01:54:49,030
as a way to fund their
planetary government.

1517
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:52,300
In the draft copy of the United
Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment, -

1518
01:54:52,450 --> 01:54:57,870
it states, very clearly, that we must
reduce human population from -

1519
01:54:58,030 --> 01:55:02,810
it's current level of ~6 billion
people down to ~1 billion people.

1520
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:08,250
In the 1970s, South Africa
developed race-specific bioweapons -

1521
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:11,850
to target blacks and Asians
and then subsequently sold the -

1522
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:16,960
technology to Israel in the
mid-1980s. In September of 2000, -

1523
01:55:17,110 --> 01:55:20,830
The Project for a New American
Century published a document -

1524
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:25,030
in which Dick Cheney described
race-specific bioweapons as -

1525
01:55:25,120 --> 01:55:27,830
'politically useful tools'.

1526
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:31,700
And somebody mentioned, "well,
why would they want to reduce -

1527
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:34,710
the human population when that
means less money for them."

1528
01:55:34,830 --> 01:55:37,580
Most people have no idea.
They're not after money.

1529
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:40,510
They have all the money they need.
They're after power.

1530
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,750
That's their aphrodisiac.

1531
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:48,350
The overlords of the New World
Order are now aggressively -

1532
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:51,890
pushing for a world-wide
one child policy.

1533
01:55:53,780 --> 01:55:56,760
The Chinese one child policy
was phased in gradually.

1534
01:55:57,090 --> 01:56:01,430
In the '60s when it began, you
only had to pay a tax penalty.

1535
01:56:01,860 --> 01:56:05,800
Only later did they imprison you
if you had more than one child.

1536
01:56:05,960 --> 01:56:09,670
Now the exact same proposals to
penalize couples who have more than -

1537
01:56:09,830 --> 01:56:13,750
one child are being made in the
United States, England and Europe.

1538
01:56:13,940 --> 01:56:17,380
In the quest to reduce Global
Warming, children, according to some, -

1539
01:56:17,510 --> 01:56:21,250
are the new culprits. A thinktank
in the U.K. says 2 many kids -

1540
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:24,660
are what's making the planet
worse, saying large families, -

1541
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:27,860
anything over 2 children really,
should be frowned upon as -

1542
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:32,130
an environmental no-no, akin to
not reusing your plastic bags, -

1543
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:36,700
driving one of those big gas guzzling
cars, taking long trips over seas.

1544
01:56:36,860 --> 01:56:39,970
The U.K. in fact has negative
growth. I think Canada does too.

1545
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:44,380
Families in our rich countries
shouldn't have more than 2 kids.

1546
01:56:45,230 --> 01:56:49,110
In 1998, Ted Turner pledged
to give more than 1 billion -

1547
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:53,390
to the United Nations to be
spent in the implementation -

1548
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:56,860
of population reduction
policies planet-wide.

1549
01:56:58,150 --> 01:57:01,650
"A total world population of
250-300 million people, -

1550
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:05,450
a 95 percent decline from
present levels, would be ideal."

1551
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:09,250
~Ted Turner
Interview, Audubon Magazine

1552
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:15,110
In 1999, the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation gave 2.2 billion -

1553
01:57:15,260 --> 01:57:19,240
to Planned Parenthood, the
United Nation's Population Fund -

1554
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:24,320
and other population reduction groups.
By 2007 the Gates had given -

1555
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:28,550
more than 30 billion dollars
almost exclusively to Population

1556
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:33,760
Control Groups. The controlled
corporate press cynically reported -

1557
01:57:33,950 --> 01:57:38,760
that the Gates were giving the
money to help 3rd World children.

1558
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:44,700
Bill and Melinda Gates were dethroned
as the worlds most generous -

1559
01:57:44,790 --> 01:57:48,710
philanthropists when their friend,
and fellow population reduction -

1560
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:53,550
enthusiast, Warren Buffet, gave
37 billion to fund an army of -

1561
01:57:53,670 --> 01:57:56,280
Population Control Groups.

1562
01:57:57,970 --> 01:58:00,720
"And I actually think the
world will be much better -

1563
01:58:00,910 --> 01:58:03,560
when there's only 10 or
20 percent of us left."

1564
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:05,460
~Dr. Eric Pianka

1565
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:10,730
Prominent, University of Texas
Biologist, Dr. Eric Pianka, -

1566
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:13,970
while receiving an award from
the Texas Academy of Science -

1567
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:19,970
said that the world-wide AIDs pandemic
was quote "no good, it's too slow", -

1568
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:23,440
and went on to laud the virtues
of Ebola because it would kill -

1569
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:26,510
90% of the world population quickly.

1570
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:31,220
When his statements erupted
into a national controversy -

1571
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:35,620
his graduate students defended him
stating that Pianka was too conservative, -

1572
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:38,220
and that all humans should be killed.

1573
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,060
But most frightening was the fact -

1574
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:47,470
in a crowd of over 1000 prominent
scientists, local newspapers reported that -

1575
01:58:47,590 --> 01:58:54,510
95% of those in attendance gave Pianka
sustained standing ovations every -

1576
01:58:54,660 --> 01:59:00,680
time he extolled the virtues of mass
culling microbes and man's destruction.

1577
01:59:07,980 --> 01:59:10,260
"China was able to turn the
corner and become the -

1578
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:13,160
leading world super power
because they have a police state -

1579
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:16,330
and they are able to force
people to stop reproducing."

1580
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,730
~Dr. Eric R. Pianka

1581
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:23,670
The eugenics movement has now shaken
off much of its Nazi baggage, -

1582
01:59:24,190 --> 01:59:29,000
and is using peoples legitimate concern
about the environment as a cloak -

1583
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:31,680
to conceal their real agenda.

1584
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:37,480
Everyone wants to breath clean
air and have good water, -

1585
01:59:37,640 --> 01:59:40,490
but the controllers of the environmental
movement have done nothing -

1586
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:44,560
but co-op people's concerns and
parole it into support -

1587
01:59:44,650 --> 01:59:48,960
for global policies that further
destabilize the 3rd World -

1588
01:59:49,050 --> 01:59:51,130
and create untold misery.

1589
01:59:55,070 --> 01:59:57,640
Phony environmental and
conservation groups -

1590
01:59:57,730 --> 01:59:59,970
are now the biggest private
land owners in the world.

1591
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:03,940
They lobby government to take property
away from local populations -

1592
02:00:04,070 --> 02:00:08,050
only to develop it themselves later.

1593
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:12,280
When the U.S. Military dumps
millions of gallons of nerve gas -

1594
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:16,120
on the east coast of the US,
they don't say a word.

1595
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:21,130
1000s of companies are creating
trans-genetic cross-species hybrids, -

1596
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:25,760
splicing plants, animals and insects,
and releasing the new organisms -

1597
02:00:25,890 --> 02:00:31,040
into the global biosphere, vandalizing
the very genetic code of the planet.

1598
02:00:31,290 --> 02:00:35,040
And large environmental
organizations do nothing.

1599
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:40,950
The corporate elite of the
planet intensified their push -

1600
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:45,280
for a global taxation system
with a year-long buildup for the -

1601
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:51,720
Live Earth hysteria, held on
July 7th, 2007 on 7 continents.

1602
02:00:52,180 --> 02:00:55,360
World leaders announced that
saving the Earth was the new -

1603
02:00:55,520 --> 02:01:01,030
organizing principle for humanity,
and hailed it as a new religion.

1604
02:01:03,730 --> 02:01:07,970
They claim that CO2, which plants
breath was killing the Earth -

1605
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:10,710
and that we must reduce the
number of children we have -

1606
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:13,080
to curtail our carbon footprint.

1607
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:20,850
Countries across the world mark the
day by passing new carbon tax schemes -

1608
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:26,360
and raising taxes on gasoline,
natural gas and electricity.

1609
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:33,130
It is a scientific fact that
the sun is the main driver -

1610
02:01:33,290 --> 02:01:36,840
of planetary climate, and
the measurements are clear.

1611
02:01:37,030 --> 02:01:40,170
The sun is becoming hotter,
brighter.

1612
02:01:40,330 --> 02:01:44,610
It has slowly increasing thermal
output in the last hundred years, -

1613
02:01:44,770 --> 02:01:49,510
causing warming, not just on earth
but throughout the solar system.

1614
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:57,120
But the scientific facts, and
even the order of the planets, -

1615
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:00,430
didn't matter to one of the
chief organizers of Live Earth, -

1616
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:04,160
David Mayer de Rothschild,
heir to the British arm -

1617
02:02:04,350 --> 02:02:07,070
of the Rothschild fortune,
when we spoke to him.

1618
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:12,770
When I called Rothschild on the
order of the planets he just laughed -

1619
02:02:12,990 --> 02:02:15,000
thinking the audience
wouldn't get it.

1620
02:02:15,130 --> 02:02:18,980
He continued to count on the
population's ignorance and claimed -

1621
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:23,720
the global warming lobby has
nothing to do with carbon taxes.

1622
02:02:23,870 --> 02:02:27,620
I guess he hadn't spoken with
his good personal friend, Al Gore.

1623
02:02:28,910 --> 02:02:32,160
Global warming, the
time for debate is over.

1624
02:02:32,350 --> 02:02:34,360
I think what you have
to realize is that being -

1625
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:38,100
environmentaly sensitive and making
money aren't mutually exclusive.

1626
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:41,600
There's a lot of money to be
made in addressing this issue.

1627
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:44,870
But you guys are gobbling up all
the worlds concern to just -

1628
02:02:44,990 --> 02:02:48,370
simply line your pockets and make
kids read your book in schools -

1629
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:51,540
and do all this, it's a business
just like you said Rothschild.

1630
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:54,450
It's not a...do you think I
make any money out of this?

1631
02:02:56,810 --> 02:03:01,150
It's the same thing your great, great, great
gran...your money changing ancestors did.

1632
02:03:01,340 --> 02:03:04,760
They're in Germany, red shield,
and I'm calling you out, red shield.

1633
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:06,830
We know it's a scam.

1634
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:09,390
A pollution based tax system,
principally CO2.

1635
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:13,100
Were causing it, mainly,
the vast majority of it.

1636
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:17,140
The consequences are bad and will
be catastrophic unless we act...

1637
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:22,670
The polar ice caps of Mars have...are
receding, it's several miles a year, -

1638
02:03:22,830 --> 02:03:28,910
much faster than ours, and that the
moons of Saturn and Jupiter are melting, -

1639
02:03:29,070 --> 02:03:33,020
in fact, several moons were
ice and are now liquid seas.

1640
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:37,760
Now, how are S.U.V.s causing
that, David Rothschild?

1641
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:41,560
Because those planets are
closer to the sun my friend.

1642
02:03:41,720 --> 02:03:46,260
No Jupiter and Saturn are not closer
to the sun, neither is Mars.

1643
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:49,900
Yes, sir. I think you'll find...right,
that the very simple matter -

1644
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:51,970
on what I wanted to say,
and this is my final point, -

1645
02:03:52,090 --> 02:03:55,040
to get your taxation system,
because actually it's not taxation...

1646
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:59,080
Put a price on the carbon.
A tax is the best way.

1647
02:03:59,230 --> 02:04:01,050
Cap-and-trade can also do it.

1648
02:04:01,570 --> 02:04:07,050
If there were a carbon based
tax, would there be a need -

1649
02:04:07,210 --> 02:04:12,290
for an economy-wide
cap-and-trade system.

1650
02:04:12,980 --> 02:04:16,460
They are not either/or.
We can do both.

1651
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:18,300
I am in favor of both.

1652
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:27,010
The architects of the New
World Order are in a race -

1653
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:29,210
to complete the structure
of world government -

1654
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,780
so they can suppress the
independent development -

1655
02:04:31,930 --> 02:04:35,280
of technologies that threaten
their monopoly of power, -

1656
02:04:35,440 --> 02:04:38,180
while at the same time
steering new developments -

1657
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:41,120
in the direction the
architects chart for humanity.

1658
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:47,890
The technocrats call their governing
system the final revolution -

1659
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:51,460
because in the past empires
were enforced militarily.

1660
02:04:53,150 --> 02:04:56,400
Now enforcement is primarily
psychological and economic.

1661
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:59,570
And society itself is
a construct of the elite -

1662
02:04:59,690 --> 02:05:02,170
who operate outside the
controlled paradigm -

1663
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:04,640
and control the civilization within.

1664
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:08,080
Just as a child maintains the
environment of a fishtank, -

1665
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:11,550
we are like lab-rats living
out our entire existence, -

1666
02:05:11,710 --> 02:05:16,520
never questioning the confines of the cage
or the scientists who experiment on us.

1667
02:05:18,280 --> 02:05:21,830
New World Order engineers
have hijacked human destiny.

1668
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:26,360
It's controllers have closely studied human
behavior for more than a hundred years, -

1669
02:05:26,690 --> 02:05:29,000
and are now steering
us with expert control -

1670
02:05:29,120 --> 02:05:32,540
using our primitive drives
and desires as levers.

1671
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:35,740
They have developed their mind
control systems to the point -

1672
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:40,480
of being able to control the average
unconscious person like a car.

1675
02:05:52,580 --> 02:05:56,490
Eugenics dominated the 20th century.
It's ruthless spirit -

1676
02:05:56,690 --> 02:06:00,330
has now metastasized into
the fields of genetics, -

1677
02:06:00,490 --> 02:06:03,870
nanotech and robotics,
but that's not surprising.

1678
02:06:04,060 --> 02:06:09,370
From their inception, all 3 disciplines
have been dominated by eugenicists.

1679
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:14,510
The billionaire founder of
Sun Microsystems, Bill Joy, -

1680
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:19,420
courageously went public in 2000
to warn of a cancerous consensus -

1681
02:06:19,570 --> 02:06:22,250
among the technocratic
elite, that at best -

1682
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:25,790
humanity would be completely
enslaved by the year 2030, -

1683
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:31,200
and at worst, mass extermination of
everyone but the elite would take place.

1684
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,700
A who's who of the techno-elite -

1685
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:39,700
are members of what is known as the
transhumanist or posthumanist movement.

1686
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:45,210
Many of it's adherents see
only the beneficial aspects -

1687
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:49,750
of technology's exponential rise
like bringing sight to the blind, -

1688
02:06:50,310 --> 02:06:54,890
sound to the deaf and
longer life for all.

1689
02:06:57,800 --> 02:07:01,230
But what many of them don't know
is that master eugenicist, -

1690
02:07:01,350 --> 02:07:05,960
Julian Huxley, founded transhumanism
and that society's controllers -

1691
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:12,070
openly admit that the new system is
designed to progress into absolute tyranny.

1692
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:20,280
Leading transhumanist, Ray Kurzweil,
boasts that technological advancements

1693
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:23,780
will allow those that can
afford it, to live forever, -

1694
02:07:23,950 --> 02:07:28,350
but admits that most wouldn't be able
to keep up with the new master race.

1695
02:07:31,150 --> 02:07:35,130
The drive for world government
is now all about who will control, -

1696
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:39,600
and have access to, radical
life extension systems.

1697
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:45,870
"Biological evolution is too
slow for the human species.

1698
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:49,610
Over the next few decades it's
going to be left in the dust."

Transhumanists believe that they
will attain the fountain of youth -

1701
02:07:55,440 --> 02:08:00,320
by merging with technology. Now
it may be within their reach.

1702
02:08:03,780 --> 02:08:07,930
Decades ago transhumanists said that
if you do not accept augmentation -

1703
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:11,130
or enhancements you would no
longer be able to get jobs -

1704
02:08:11,320 --> 02:08:13,630
and now it's happening today.

"The elite who occupy the commanding
heights of digital reality -

1707
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:24,610
are suicidal nihilists.
Suicidal nihilists know -

1708
02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:28,050
that there is no longer any
substantive purpose to their willing.

1709
02:08:28,170 --> 02:08:31,680
But they would always prefer to
go on willing that not to act at all.

1710
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:34,010
They can very happily ally themselves -

1711
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:37,290
with a notion of nuclear
holocaust or perfect exterminism."

in it's capacity for destruction -

that free humanity cannot afford
to let psychopathic technocrats, -

1715

with delusions of grandeur,
repeat the mistakes of their forebearers, -

1716
02:08:51,560 --> 02:08:55,070
because it is highly probable that
this time they may destroy -

1717
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:59,610
everything including themselves
in their mad rush for Godhood.

1718
02:09:04,810 --> 02:09:08,190
In this film we have chronicled
the overlord's bloody orgy -

1719
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:10,960
of experimentation which
already claimed the lives -

1720
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:14,790
of over 150 million people
in the 20th century.

1721
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:20,630
And now they are promising
to deliver an -

1722
02:09:20,790 --> 02:09:24,400
invincible tyranny that will
dwarf their past exploits.

1723
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:30,040
In the days of World War II
there were sovereign nations -

1724
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:34,380
and armies to stand against
Hitlers final solution.

1725
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:41,490
Once world government is in place
no one will be able to stop -

1726
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:45,360
the New World Order's plans
for Global Population Reduction.

1727
02:09:46,350 --> 02:09:48,760
For those immune to
psychological programming, -

1728
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:51,800
100s of FEMA camps have already
been built throughout the -

1729
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:55,730
United States in their quest
for population reduction.

1730
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:57,640
No method is off the table.

1731
02:09:58,190 --> 02:10:02,870
These dark builders intent to release
a String of manmade bioweapons plagues, -

1732
02:10:03,060 --> 02:10:06,810
each one worse than the last,
while at the same time, -

1733
02:10:06,970 --> 02:10:10,620
expanding the Police State to
enforce an orderly extermination -

1734
02:10:10,770 --> 02:10:15,420
of the population - all in the
name of fighting invisible terrorists.

1735
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:21,990
And the Georgia Guidestones
stand today as a cold testament -

1736
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:27,000
to the elite's sacred mission.

1737
02:10:28,820 --> 02:10:30,540
to have a two class system -

1738
02:10:30,660 --> 02:10:33,100
where the underclass are
forced to live as slaves -

1739
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:38,180
in tiny enclosed cities, while the
elite enjoy the land of the Earth, -

1740
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:43,880
evolve into superhumans with the
aid of implantable technologies, -

1741
02:10:44,010 --> 02:10:47,650
live eternal lives and
travel throughout the cosmos.

1742
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:51,160
This is the promise given
to the inner members -

1743
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:56,230
of the New World Order, and
the agenda of the Bilderberg Group.

1744
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:26,790
In 2007, Jim Tucker continued
his 30 year quest -

1745
02:11:26,950 --> 02:11:30,430
to expose the globalists by
traveling to Istanbul, Turkey, -

1746
02:11:30,590 --> 02:11:33,830
the site of Bilderberg 2007.

1747
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:44,510
Jim Tucker, thank you for
comin' on, my friend.

1748
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:45,940
It's always fun.

1749
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:51,180
Jim, tell us what you saw when
you were out at the Ritz Hotel.

1750
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:57,260
We were at the Ritz-Carlton. It looked
like a typical Bilderberg scenario, -

1751
02:11:57,350 --> 02:11:59,320
with the heavy armed guards
all around the place, -

1752
02:11:59,450 --> 02:12:04,430
they had platoons of cops in
formation waiting for their dispersement.

1753
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:07,630
They also had cops all the
way around the building, -

1754
02:12:08,190 --> 02:12:12,270
and they had all those high-tech
things where every member can -

1755
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:14,810
hear whatever's spoken in any language, -

1756
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:20,680
instantly translated to his own
language so they can keep up with it.

1757
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:58,920
Is the hotel open?

1758
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:07,830
Let's just ask him directly.

1759
02:13:18,230 --> 02:13:21,170
Is Bilderberg meeting
here this weekend?

1760
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:23,580
You can go this way.

1761
02:13:24,730 --> 02:13:27,880
We had my 2 personal
cops following me today.

1762
02:13:28,170 --> 02:13:31,680
I was not aware because my nose
is always sticking into a camera -

1763
02:13:31,810 --> 02:13:36,490
and my jaws are always flapping,
but the TV crew said, -

1764
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:44,260
those guys are gonna follow you.
And their car followed us out to

1765
02:13:44,450 --> 02:13:51,070
the hotel then the TV crew identified
the 2 cops in plain clothes, -

1766
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:54,570
not business suits but
sport shirts and so-forth.

1767
02:13:57,970 --> 02:14:02,610
That's the car that's been on our
ass. Anyone wanna photograph him?

1768
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:05,240
You are, aren't you.

1769
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:11,720
Well, they're very likely
[to be] Bilderberg boys.

1770
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:20,400
John Elkann, owner of fiat
and a fellow Bilderberger, -

1771
02:14:20,590 --> 02:14:22,970
thought that they could
take a stroll off the grounds -

1772
02:14:23,090 --> 02:14:25,570
without being noticed by the commoners.

1773
02:14:25,730 --> 02:14:27,310
I was thinking about that.

1774
02:14:33,170 --> 02:14:36,820
This Bilderberg attendee
sneered at our camera.

1775
02:14:41,080 --> 02:14:45,060
This car load of kingpins gave
the media a murderous look -

1776
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:49,390
and seemed shocked that they would
dare point a camera in their direction.

1777
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:09,250
In 2007, the Bilderberg Group -

1778
02:15:09,370 --> 02:15:12,150
received the heaviest global
coverage in it's history.

1779
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:16,120
Jim Tucker witnessed press
conferences attended by -

1780
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:20,390
hundreds of members of the media,
and a new generation of info-warriors, -

1781
02:15:20,550 --> 02:15:23,230
like reporter
Paul Dorneanu of Romania, -

1782
02:15:23,390 --> 02:15:26,230
are tracking the elite
no matter where they hide.

1783
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:31,040
We are exposing this group called Bilderberg.

1784
02:15:31,590 --> 02:15:35,070
Now, Jim, my governor,
Rick Perry, it's in the frontpage -

1785
02:15:35,230 --> 02:15:37,440
of the Dallas Morning News,
the headline reads: -

1786
02:15:37,630 --> 02:15:41,450
Texas Governor Rick
Perry to attend Bilderberg.

1787
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:45,320
What does it mean to have the Governor
of Texas in the Dallas Morning News, -

1788
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:47,950
just admitting he's
going to Bilderberg Group?

1789
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:50,720
That means he's a
potential President. -

1790
02:15:51,050 --> 02:15:53,160
Even as the obscure
Governor of Arkansas, -

1791
02:15:53,480 --> 02:15:57,760
Bill Clinton lost his virginity to
the Bilderberg meeting in Baden-Baden -

1792
02:15:57,890 --> 02:16:02,200
in Germany in 1991, and he's
elected President the following year.

1793
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:05,040
Now, if he goes nowhere,

1794
02:16:05,190 --> 02:16:07,670
then in the run for the
White House in the years ahead, -

1795
02:16:07,830 --> 02:16:11,110
they'll drop him like an old
shoe - they do that often.

1796
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:18,850
But officially Bilderberg considers
Perry a potential President of the US.

1797
02:16:19,210 --> 02:16:25,220
Yes, it's a violation of the
Logan Act for which Bill Clinton's -

1798
02:16:25,350 --> 02:16:30,330
White House was fined $300,00,
which means the tax payers paid it.

1799
02:16:34,890 --> 02:16:37,300
When Perry returned to
Texas from Istanbul -

1800
02:16:37,530 --> 02:16:41,970
we were determined to hold him
accountable for his treasonous actions.

1801
02:17:02,850 --> 02:17:06,730
We don't want our roads, our
water, our power plants, -

1802
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:10,600
our entire infrastructure turned
over to the New World Order.

1803
02:17:10,830 --> 02:17:14,770
And we tell you now, the people
are rising up and learning -

1804
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:18,680
what you're doing and they're
angry, and they're tired of it.

1805
02:17:18,870 --> 02:17:22,410
Stop enslaving us.
Stop setting up tyranny.

1806
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:26,020
Stop going along with
the New World Order plan -

1807
02:17:26,220 --> 02:17:28,450
if you've got any soul
left, Rick Perry.

1808
02:17:29,910 --> 02:17:34,290
The 1st Amendment still exists, Perry,
and we're back here again tonight, -

1809
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:37,000
telling you we're not
gonna put up with it.

1810
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:39,500
Long live the Republic!

1811
02:17:39,690 --> 02:17:41,870
We shall prevail!

1812
02:17:42,060 --> 02:17:46,240
Death to the New World Order!
