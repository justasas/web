1
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,794
Want a hot dog?

2
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,005
No, thanks.

3
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:04,505
Just ketchup, please.

4
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,179
Thanks.

5
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,876
Listen, I've got
an errand to run.

6
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:16,253
Kind of skimpy
on the ketchup.

7
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,356
Duncan, I've got to do this alone.

8
00:03:19,427 --> 00:03:20,637
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

9
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:22,081
You called me in Paris,

10
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:24,535
and you said,
"We have to meet."

11
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:27,513
Now suddenly you've
got an errand to run?

12
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:29,725
What's going on?

13
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,453
I don't know.

14
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:32,635
It's...

15
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:36,282
nothing.

16
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:37,816
You okay?

17
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:42,267
Yeah. I'm okay.

18
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:43,712
Really.

19
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:47,126
I know you better
than that, Connor.

20
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,056
Haven't seen you like this.

21
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:53,344
People change, Duncan.

22
00:03:53,408 --> 00:03:55,514
You'll learn that.

23
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:57,112
Fine.

24
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:59,324
You can tell me
all about it tonight.

25
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:02,076
8:00 at the bar.

26
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:04,283
And you're buying.

27
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:06,044
Right.

28
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,414
8:00, and I'm buying.

29
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,789
Mm-hmm.

30
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:14,295
You sure you gonna be
all right, Connor?

31
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:15,894
Of course.

32
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:17,015
Duncan...

33
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:22,591
watch your back.

34
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:50,163
Connor?

35
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:54,172
Connor?

36
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,675
Okay.

37
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,088
What is it, Connor?

38
00:05:39,163 --> 00:05:40,145
Open it.

39
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:41,681
Oh, a ballerina.

40
00:05:41,756 --> 00:05:44,855
Wow. She's beautiful.

41
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:46,712
Thank you.

42
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,185
Mmm, my angel.

43
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:55,604
Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you.

44
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:56,657
I love you, Connor.

45
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,104
I love you, my Rachel.

46
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,697
Oh, God,
I'm proud of you.

47
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,697
Thank you.

48
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:30,197
Hello?

49
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:41,614
Rachel!

50
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,118
Rachel.

51
00:06:47,192 --> 00:06:49,134
My beloved Rachel.

52
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,894
How long has it been
since she died?

53
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,702
A year?
A century? More?

54
00:06:59,768 --> 00:07:01,710
My mind keeps slipping,

55
00:07:01,784 --> 00:07:04,883
but some things I know.

56
00:07:04,952 --> 00:07:07,799
I am Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod,

57
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:12,620
and once,
a very long time ago,

58
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:15,030
I was a Highlander.

59
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,205
Born of this land,

60
00:07:28,278 --> 00:07:31,212
and like this land, immortal.

61
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:42,636
Witch!

62
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,466
You brought
this plague on us.

63
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:47,566
You damned us all,
Connor MacLeod.

64
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:49,263
You sold your soul!

65
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:51,854
You're a witch!

66
00:07:51,925 --> 00:07:52,819
You child of Satan!

67
00:07:52,885 --> 00:07:53,965
They drove you from your home,

68
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:56,078
cut you off
from your own people.

69
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,906
What else do they want?

70
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:59,282
Someone to blame.

71
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:01,138
Your mother will burn!

72
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:02,579
Connor.

73
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:04,303
Your mother will burn!

74
00:08:04,373 --> 00:08:05,900
Rot in hell!

75
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:07,533
Get in the house.

76
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:10,189
Get off my land!

77
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:11,821
Leave us in peace!

78
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,169
Get off my land!

79
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:20,080
Connor, please.

80
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:22,155
You're not going back
to Glenfinnan.

81
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:23,984
I have no choice.

82
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:25,426
Connor, please.

83
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:28,141
They can't hurt me,
and they know it,

84
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:30,829
but they can still
hurt the ones I love.

85
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,103
I'm afraid.

86
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:36,174
I love you, Heather.

87
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,347
More than anything in this world.

88
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:40,654
Do you believe me?

89
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:41,617
Yes.

90
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:43,341
Then don't be afraid.

91
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,582
Nothing can keep me from you.

92
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,258
Nothing.

93
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:43,949
Connor.

94
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:47,819
I thought you might be
the water horse...

95
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,204
come to take me on his back
and drown me in the loch.

96
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,100
No one comes
to take care of you?

97
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,693
Not in years.

98
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:04,425
They think I bedevil
their children...

99
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:07,016
because my own was banished.

100
00:10:09,422 --> 00:10:11,811
I'm sorry.

101
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:13,315
I'm so sorry.

102
00:10:15,246 --> 00:10:17,482
Tiny mites...

103
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:20,102
and soured dispositions.

104
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,368
I've no need of them, Connor,

105
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:25,161
any of them.

106
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:31,875
Then it's settled.

107
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:33,226
You're coming with me.

108
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:40,619
Aah!

109
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,310
Connor!

110
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:43,811
Connor, what is it?

111
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:45,259
I'm not sure.

112
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:46,851
It happened once before.

113
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:47,873
Aah!

114
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,442
Aah! Connor!

115
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:56,418
In the name
of the Holy See...

116
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:59,339
and the rule of law,

117
00:10:59,404 --> 00:11:01,771
you are hereby charged,

118
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:04,170
Connor MacLeod,

119
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:05,381
with heresy...

120
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:07,044
and the practice
of black magic.

121
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:09,536
We were friends, remember, Jacob?

122
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,302
I stood at your ordination.

123
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,713
I vouched for you.

124
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,470
You shouldn't have
come back, Connor.

125
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:15,847
Take him.

126
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:17,929
Aah!

127
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:27,232
The ties of blood...

128
00:11:27,306 --> 00:11:32,041
cannot be severed
by word or deed.

129
00:11:39,018 --> 00:11:40,393
Mother.

130
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:42,247
Due to
the infinite compassion...

131
00:11:44,553 --> 00:11:48,994
you are entitled
to one final opportunity...

132
00:11:49,065 --> 00:11:50,920
to renounce all that is unholy,

133
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:55,327
and declare Connor MacLeod
not of your loins.

134
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:58,596
How say you,
Caiolin MacLeod?

135
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:03,011
If your God...

136
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,040
should persecute me
into the next world,

137
00:12:07,112 --> 00:12:09,982
then I shall simply have
to find myself another.

138
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:13,894
Burn her!

139
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:16,196
No! No! No!

140
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:19,359
He is your son.

141
00:12:20,392 --> 00:12:22,247
I am silent for you.

142
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:31,077
Black powder.

143
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:32,486
It will ease your suffering.

144
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,476
Mother!

145
00:12:41,735 --> 00:12:43,076
No!

146
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,329
No!

147
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,665
You're next, you demon!

148
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:27,805
Aah!

149
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:49,825
Aah!

150
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,653
My water horse.

151
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:12,989
Unh!

152
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:19,358
The Devil's come back to life!

153
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:29,849
Let her be, Connor.

154
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:32,310
Aah!

155
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,311
Father?

156
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,384
Father?

157
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:42,197
Please.

158
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:44,247
Do not leave me.

159
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:47,033
Father.

160
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,680
Aah!

161
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:07,994
Connor--

162
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:47,414
My endless days...

163
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:50,967
are filled with memories
of the past...

164
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:53,973
and the death of my mother
by Jacob Kell.

165
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:32,146
Boy, you people are
extremely difficult to find.

166
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:33,812
We like it that way.

167
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:44,855
Go ahead, man.
Take your pick.

168
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:47,513
Unh!

169
00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:56,786
Uhh!

170
00:16:58,522 --> 00:16:59,700
Aah!

171
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,833
Aah.

172
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:10,326
Take their heads.

173
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,983
They might be Immortals.

174
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:14,028
Yes, they might be.

175
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,328
Aah!

176
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:41,266
Don't be long.

177
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,500
The Sanctuary.

178
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,158
So it's true.

179
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:13,747
What sacrifices
they have made of you,

180
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:17,587
warehoused like
rotting pieces of meat.

181
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:23,949
Tell me,

182
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:26,953
is this... the better way?

183
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:31,402
I'm sure you've had
time to reflect upon it.

184
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:34,833
What you need to understand...

185
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:37,648
is that I don't care
about the game.

186
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:40,081
I don't care about the rules.

187
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:43,495
I don't even care about
these pathetic souls...

188
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:48,555
you keep locked away
as a barrier to the prize.

189
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:52,880
Which one is
Connor MacLeod?

190
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:55,598
Well, what do we do now?

191
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:57,997
What we always do.

192
00:20:58,063 --> 00:21:00,103
We're Watchers, not cops.

193
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,247
We'll find another volunteer.

194
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:48,705
Whatever you fear
about Connor MacLeod,

195
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,275
fear the worst.

196
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:53,572
Who is this?

197
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,051
A friend.

198
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:58,214
Don't bother looking for me, Duncan.

199
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:10,214
He's on the move.

200
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:22,537
Duncan MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

201
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,511
Hello, Methos.

202
00:22:24,586 --> 00:22:27,552
What brings you
to my humble abode?

203
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,666
Need your help.

204
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:30,981
Why me?

205
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,569
You've been around for 5,000 years.

206
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:38,016
I want the benefit
of your experience.

207
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:41,352
And I thought
it was a social call.

208
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:44,392
You ever had nightmares?

209
00:22:44,457 --> 00:22:46,792
What kind of nightmares?

210
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:48,002
Bloody images...

211
00:22:48,073 --> 00:22:50,789
powerful enough to even
break your meditation.

212
00:22:50,857 --> 00:22:54,567
We live violent lives, MacLeod.

213
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:56,542
Some of that's
bound to stay with us.

214
00:22:57,545 --> 00:22:59,203
These ones came
10 years to the day...

215
00:22:59,273 --> 00:23:00,931
that Connor MacLeod disappeared.

216
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,135
Connor had good reason to go.

217
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,437
He told me how much
Rachel meant to him.

218
00:23:06,505 --> 00:23:09,799
There was more to it than that.
I was with him that day.

219
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:11,686
The day Rachel was killed?

220
00:23:11,752 --> 00:23:13,988
Something wasn't right.

221
00:23:14,055 --> 00:23:15,234
Connor, you okay?

222
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:19,078
Yeah. I'm okay.
Really.

223
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:21,598
I know you better
than that, Connor.

224
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:24,769
I've never seen you like this.

225
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,773
People change, Duncan.

226
00:23:27,847 --> 00:23:29,373
You'll learn that.

227
00:23:31,174 --> 00:23:33,412
I need to know
if he's still alive, Methos.

228
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:36,957
You know a little
about Buddhist monks.

229
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:38,885
Some of them come
to cherish life so much...

230
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:42,812
that to step on an insect
or harm a blade of grass...

231
00:23:42,886 --> 00:23:44,926
becomes a violation
of their creed,

232
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:46,690
so they place themselves
under an extreme form...

233
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,701
of protective custody--

234
00:23:48,774 --> 00:23:51,327
A Sanctuary of sorts.

235
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:53,024
Well, for an Immortal...

236
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:54,653
who comes to abhor
the bloodshed,

237
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,995
there's a similar solution--

238
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,517
Away to be removed
from the game forever.

239
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,531
The price
is unimaginably high,

240
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:03,612
but you are, for
all practical purposes,

241
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:07,875
protected from
the violence within you.

242
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:09,981
And it's called The Sanctuary.

243
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:11,941
Connor would never do that.

244
00:24:12,005 --> 00:24:13,182
Are you sure?

245
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:15,107
It's been around since
before you were born.

246
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:17,311
At least until last night.

247
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:19,072
What happened last night?

248
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,890
It was annihilated.

249
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,521
Hey, Duncan, what's the matter?

250
00:24:39,587 --> 00:24:40,536
The British...

251
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,138
destroyed the clans, Connor.

252
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:43,902
Scotland's finished.

253
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:46,873
Scotland will always be Scotland,

254
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:48,769
and someday you'll go back.

255
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,209
You can bet on it.

256
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:51,169
How much?

257
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:52,218
Aw, come on.

258
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:55,008
Does everything have
to be a wager with you?

259
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:56,536
Well, you're the one
that keeps telling me...

260
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,749
our lives are nothing
but a boundless game.

261
00:25:01,443 --> 00:25:02,522
Good morning, gentlemen.

262
00:25:02,594 --> 00:25:04,983
What seems to be
the problem here?

263
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:07,676
They refuses to pay her toll, sir.

264
00:25:07,746 --> 00:25:09,437
Really? How dare they.

265
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:10,880
These men are rogues.

266
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:13,149
These men are
liars and scoundrels, sir.

267
00:25:13,218 --> 00:25:16,000
They've done nothing but
prey upon us 3 years running,

268
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:17,953
right at this very spot.

269
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:20,190
And by whose authority
do you act?

270
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:21,403
By Deed of the King.

271
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,205
There is a little "X" down here.

272
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:29,273
Does the King always
sign his name with an "X"?

273
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:30,751
Excuse me. Sorry. Ha ha.

274
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:32,246
I think these gentlemen
should be paid.

275
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,750
That deed is a fake.

276
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:35,101
That's a matter of opinion.

277
00:25:35,168 --> 00:25:37,144
You, sir, are
no better than they.

278
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:39,584
That is also a matter of opinion.

279
00:25:39,648 --> 00:25:40,630
Here you go.

280
00:25:42,017 --> 00:25:43,675
Ladies.

281
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:45,500
It's gold!

282
00:25:45,568 --> 00:25:46,876
Why not--
It's gold.

283
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:48,318
First man: Ha ha!

284
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:50,271
Hey, wait a minute.
They took my money!

285
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,678
Oh, it's here.

286
00:25:51,744 --> 00:25:53,150
They took my money!

287
00:25:53,215 --> 00:25:54,426
Let's go get 'em!

288
00:25:54,496 --> 00:25:55,925
Shall we?

289
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,489
Aye.

290
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,763
Aah!

291
00:26:03,966 --> 00:26:05,080
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

292
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,515
Heh heh.

293
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,476
Not bad.

294
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,656
Uh-oh.

295
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,374
Mmm.

296
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:24,506
All right boys, time to go.
Let's go!

297
00:26:24,574 --> 00:26:25,468
Come on!

298
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:29,116
Ohh. Cuckoo.

299
00:26:29,183 --> 00:26:31,070
Oh, looks heavy, huh?

300
00:26:31,134 --> 00:26:32,792
Looks like
you lost your edge, lad.

301
00:26:32,862 --> 00:26:33,756
Really heavy.

302
00:26:33,822 --> 00:26:35,283
Or could he be lass?

303
00:26:35,358 --> 00:26:36,634
Could be.

304
00:26:36,702 --> 00:26:37,595
Could be.

305
00:26:40,926 --> 00:26:42,038
Hyah!

306
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:44,219
Come on!

307
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:46,619
Hyah! Hyah!

308
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:49,690
Hyah!

309
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,508
Corporal Duncan MacLeod, sir.

310
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:42,030
I've come to pick up
the wounded.

311
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,506
You've improved greatly.

312
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:21,035
Ah, you really think so?

313
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:27,123
No.

314
00:29:28,212 --> 00:29:29,554
I'm just being gracious.

315
00:29:29,622 --> 00:29:30,155
Hmm.

316
00:29:32,084 --> 00:29:33,840
Now, remember.

317
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:35,502
You are only immortal...

318
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:37,994
as long as you
can keep your head...

319
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,180
on your shoulders.

320
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:43,756
Gahh.

321
00:29:43,828 --> 00:29:47,308
Duncan, what you give up
to your adversary...

322
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,355
in defeat...

323
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:50,444
is everything.

324
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:52,523
I know.
And at that point,

325
00:29:52,596 --> 00:29:54,418
I'm very, very dead.
Come on!

326
00:29:54,484 --> 00:29:55,378
Heh heh heh.

327
00:29:55,444 --> 00:29:57,811
Not just dead, Duncan--

328
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:58,769
Empty!

329
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:03,466
Aye, Connor, I know.
It's called the Quickening.

330
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,547
Our strength and knowledge,
our life essence,

331
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,179
flows into the victor, feeds him,

332
00:30:07,251 --> 00:30:08,942
and makes him stronger, yes?

333
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,084
It's what drives
the other Immortals...

334
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:12,083
to kill us,

335
00:30:12,147 --> 00:30:13,575
and what forces us...

336
00:30:13,651 --> 00:30:15,177
to be smarter,
better than the rest.

337
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,323
I understand.

338
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:20,077
Ooh.

339
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:23,312
You do?

340
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,708
Ohh.

341
00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:26,672
Good.

342
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:30,223
I slipped.

343
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:33,160
Listen, soon you and I
will have to part.

344
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:35,536
There is one more thing
I want to give to you.

345
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:40,303
Va via. Va via!

346
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:41,482
Ho ho ho.

347
00:30:41,554 --> 00:30:42,699
Oh, aye!

348
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,086
Oh, aye. This is
much more to my liking.

349
00:30:46,162 --> 00:30:47,056
Good.

350
00:30:47,122 --> 00:30:48,649
Bah! Heh heh heh.

351
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:49,615
Heh heh heh.

352
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:51,851
Attack me.

353
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:54,823
But you've got your back to me.

354
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:59,084
It's not always
about strength, Duncan.

355
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:00,080
Attack me!

356
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,340
Aah!

357
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,124
It's about manipulation
of the mind...

358
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,398
as well as the body.

359
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:18,090
Aye, but now I'm in control.

360
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,395
Heh heh heh. Are you?

361
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:30,215
Remember well, my friend.

362
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:33,636
Properly executed,
this move is unstoppable.

363
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:38,188
Properly executed,
we'll nae have this talk again.

364
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,344
Who are you?

365
00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:04,966
A friend... or a lover.

366
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:06,980
Or a wife.

367
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:08,101
Kate?

368
00:32:08,172 --> 00:32:09,634
Attaboy.

369
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:12,578
Except I'm Faith now.

370
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:15,074
Part of the makeover.

371
00:32:15,148 --> 00:32:16,675
What are you doing here?

372
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:19,368
Remember our wedding day,
Duncan?

373
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,812
I do.

374
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:24,844
The way we danced.

375
00:32:26,316 --> 00:32:27,778
I felt like we were flying.

376
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,857
Of course,
we did come down...

377
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:39,817
didn't we?

378
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:44,610
Crashing.

379
00:32:48,523 --> 00:32:50,018
Oh, shit.

380
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:01,383
It's time to show
our Immortal brother...

381
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,581
a thing or two.

382
00:33:13,483 --> 00:33:15,305
Somebody order
a club sandwich?

383
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,704
He's funny.
Nice outfit, too.

384
00:33:17,771 --> 00:33:20,389
Faith, I told you I look
like a fuckin' orange!

385
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:22,879
I'm not dressing you black, Bob.
Trust me.

386
00:33:22,953 --> 00:33:23,814
Who are they?

387
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:27,045
Friends.

388
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:28,521
What, it's a team sport now?

389
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:30,014
What, you didn't know?

390
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:33,286
It's a whole new ball game.

391
00:33:33,354 --> 00:33:35,208
Aah!

392
00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:53,054
Hey!

393
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,034
Nice bat.

394
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:08,741
Aargh!

395
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:10,269
Told you I was gonna cut you.

396
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:21,315
Aaah!

397
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:30,054
Let my man Jin Ke
deal with him.

398
00:34:32,518 --> 00:34:34,851
Jin Ke...

399
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,478
who served with
the Emperor Chin.

400
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,721
The same man.

401
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:40,731
Some people say
you're a man of honor.

402
00:34:40,805 --> 00:34:42,659
What do you know about honor?

403
00:34:44,485 --> 00:34:46,078
Oh, great.

404
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:48,510
Yaah!

405
00:35:30,787 --> 00:35:33,438
Honor's not in a weapon.

406
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:34,717
It's in the man.

407
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:03,226
Enough!

408
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:08,887
Boys, boys.

409
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:11,449
I do apologize.

410
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:13,943
When it comes to discipline,

411
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:17,759
the first hundred years
are the hardest.

412
00:36:21,025 --> 00:36:22,039
Ohh!

413
00:36:23,456 --> 00:36:24,350
Ohh!

414
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,349
Guess I'm not much
of a swords guy.

415
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:32,791
I thought I told you to stop.

416
00:36:34,687 --> 00:36:35,615
Yeah, well,

417
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,890
I stopped.

418
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:37,941
Tell me, Carlos.

419
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,383
How much is your life worth?

420
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:42,815
Don't start this bullshit, man.

421
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,498
'Cause the only way
to win your freedom...

422
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:47,193
is to kill me.

423
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:48,158
You're crazy.

424
00:36:48,224 --> 00:36:49,271
Am I?

425
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:51,252
Then go ahead.

426
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:54,110
Stop the madness.

427
00:36:55,775 --> 00:36:58,874
Can you live with the fear?

428
00:36:58,943 --> 00:37:01,626
Can you live
with the weakness?

429
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:07,866
Weakness, Carlos.

430
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:14,104
I call this...

431
00:37:14,174 --> 00:37:16,825
decap with a twist--

432
00:37:16,894 --> 00:37:18,071
No sugar.

433
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,274
Watchers?

434
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:05,558
Huh?

435
00:38:07,836 --> 00:38:09,875
Watchers observe Immortals.

436
00:38:09,947 --> 00:38:12,052
They're not supposed
to interfere.

437
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,708
Unfortunately, our role
has changed somewhat.

438
00:38:14,778 --> 00:38:16,088
Why?

439
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:18,009
Because the rules
have been broken.

440
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:21,849
One of your kind
has gone renegade.

441
00:38:24,474 --> 00:38:27,027
In doing so, he's gained
himself a sizable advantage.

442
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,587
One that'll be
impossible to overcome.

443
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:30,935
Nobody's unbeatable.

444
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:33,424
Oh, yes, Duncan. He is.

445
00:38:37,018 --> 00:38:38,447
Unbeatable.

446
00:38:42,074 --> 00:38:43,284
No.

447
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:54,039
Ahh.

448
00:38:55,065 --> 00:38:56,112
Sorry about that.

449
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,150
There must always be
two of your kind.

450
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:01,744
As long as there are two,

451
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:03,343
and you're kept from fighting,

452
00:39:03,417 --> 00:39:05,206
then the prize is safe.

453
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:08,174
The Sanctuary must not fail again.

454
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:09,425
You're insane.

455
00:39:09,495 --> 00:39:11,830
Get yourself another volunteer.

456
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:15,692
We had a number of volunteers!

457
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:19,030
Sadly, that's
no longer the case.

458
00:39:19,096 --> 00:39:20,558
You'll be warehoused,

459
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:21,974
hidden away.

460
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,218
Go to hell.

461
00:39:23,288 --> 00:39:24,433
Don't worry.

462
00:39:25,592 --> 00:39:28,145
The drugs'll kick in momentarily.

463
00:40:05,877 --> 00:40:06,924
Get up.

464
00:40:08,053 --> 00:40:09,101
Get up!

465
00:40:16,341 --> 00:40:19,188
You have better things to do
than lie there on your ass.

466
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:21,740
Who are you?

467
00:40:21,813 --> 00:40:24,049
Someone who knows
more about you...

468
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:25,742
than you know about yourself.

469
00:40:25,813 --> 00:40:27,057
Are you a demon?

470
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,067
Heh, heh heh.

471
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,417
I've been called that...

472
00:40:30,484 --> 00:40:31,564
and worse.

473
00:40:33,652 --> 00:40:35,824
I'm Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

474
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,583
Connor MacLeod?

475
00:40:37,653 --> 00:40:40,522
And like you, my friend,

476
00:40:40,596 --> 00:40:42,537
I have a hard time dying.

477
00:40:58,226 --> 00:40:59,306
Dawson?

478
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:01,993
Heh, you look like shit.

479
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:03,147
Thanks.

480
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:04,626
How long have I--

481
00:41:04,691 --> 00:41:05,520
We'll talk about it later.

482
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,515
We gotta get outta here.

483
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:09,394
Come on, can you walk?

484
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:10,386
Yeah.

485
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,497
Uhh.

486
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:29,711
Go. Go!

487
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,054
What are you doing here?

488
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:31,950
Keeping tabs on you.

489
00:41:32,017 --> 00:41:33,424
Yeah?

490
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:34,666
Well...

491
00:41:34,737 --> 00:41:35,948
someone should keep tabs...

492
00:41:36,017 --> 00:41:37,707
on that psychotic asshole
back there.

493
00:41:37,777 --> 00:41:39,303
Didn't you get it
back in London?

494
00:41:39,377 --> 00:41:41,581
These guys don't play by the rules.

495
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:43,307
You don't know what
you're up against, Mac.

496
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:44,620
So people keep telling me.

497
00:41:44,688 --> 00:41:45,933
Stop the car.

498
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:48,334
I managed to liberate that
from their lost and found.

499
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,188
There's blood on it.

500
00:41:50,255 --> 00:41:52,044
I didn't say it was easy.

501
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:53,006
Pull over.

502
00:41:53,072 --> 00:41:54,895
What?

503
00:41:54,961 --> 00:41:56,389
Pull over.

504
00:41:56,465 --> 00:41:58,985
MacLeod, tell me something.

505
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:00,103
Mac, hear him out!

506
00:42:00,176 --> 00:42:02,565
Mac! Will you
tell me something?

507
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,974
Now, how many Quickenings
have you had?

508
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,933
How many heads
have you taken?

509
00:42:09,007 --> 00:42:10,916
I don't keep score.

510
00:42:11,535 --> 00:42:13,128
Well, we do.

511
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,573
MacLeod, Connor.

512
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,850
What's that?

513
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:25,577
The Watchers' version
of a resumé.

514
00:42:28,975 --> 00:42:31,461
It's a bit like
handicapping horses, I know,

515
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:32,810
but it's part
of the gig, all right?

516
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:38,412
174 confirmed Immortal kills.

517
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:42,951
Sound about right?

518
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:44,995
So, what's your point?

519
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:47,753
Here's the gentleman
you met in Connor's loft.

520
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:54,790
661 confirmed Immortal kills.

521
00:42:58,606 --> 00:43:00,994
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

522
00:43:01,069 --> 00:43:03,273
Sanctuary wasn't shit, pal.

523
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:05,894
This guy is way
out of your league.

524
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:12,617
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.

525
00:43:12,684 --> 00:43:15,367
Why?

526
00:43:15,436 --> 00:43:16,713
Something
doesn't make sense.

527
00:43:17,964 --> 00:43:19,525
What are you saying?

528
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:23,043
I think he's saying
he wants to see the body.

529
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:24,807
Well, it's gonna be a rough I.D.

530
00:43:24,876 --> 00:43:27,264
They're all missing their heads!

531
00:44:06,058 --> 00:44:08,294
We gave 'em
a Christian burial, MacLeod.

532
00:44:08,361 --> 00:44:09,572
It was decent, you know.

533
00:44:09,642 --> 00:44:11,234
Said all the right words.

534
00:44:11,306 --> 00:44:13,672
Can't begin to tell you
how reassuring that is.

535
00:44:13,737 --> 00:44:15,079
With all these
unexplained corpses,

536
00:44:15,145 --> 00:44:18,757
well, we had to take it
off the beaten track.

537
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:20,352
End of the road, Joe.

538
00:44:22,985 --> 00:44:23,879
Thanks.

539
00:44:25,544 --> 00:44:27,911
You watch your ass, MacLeod.

540
00:44:27,976 --> 00:44:30,148
It's not my ass
I'm worried about.

541
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,359
Did I happen to mention
about all this...

542
00:44:35,432 --> 00:44:36,578
coming to a bad end?

543
00:44:36,649 --> 00:44:38,656
No, Methos.

544
00:44:38,728 --> 00:44:40,255
I don't believe you did.

545
00:44:46,087 --> 00:44:47,429
You were gonna stay and dig.

546
00:44:47,496 --> 00:44:50,048
Dig? Oh, yeah!

547
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:17,055
I need to know
if he's still alive, Professor.

548
00:45:17,126 --> 00:45:20,442
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.

549
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:24,381
One of your kind
has gone renegade.

550
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:32,100
People change, Duncan.

551
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,594
You'll learn that.

552
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:00,989
No.

553
00:46:08,324 --> 00:46:09,949
What are you doing here?

554
00:46:11,427 --> 00:46:14,110
You walked out
on your life, Connor.

555
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,127
Why?

556
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:19,742
I had my reasons.

557
00:46:19,812 --> 00:46:21,371
Reasons?

558
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:26,497
Every life I touch ends...

559
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:28,578
brutally...

560
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:30,976
and for no reason.

561
00:46:31,043 --> 00:46:32,570
It's a curse...

562
00:46:32,642 --> 00:46:34,846
that's followed me for centuries.

563
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:40,503
I can't outrun it,
and I can't outlive it.

564
00:46:42,435 --> 00:46:44,376
Rachel's death made you
the last soul on this planet...

565
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:45,694
that means a damn to me.

566
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:48,479
I thought there was a way out.

567
00:46:48,546 --> 00:46:49,528
The Sanctuary?

568
00:46:51,362 --> 00:46:52,255
Yes.

569
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:56,310
The Sanctuary.

570
00:46:57,569 --> 00:46:58,649
So, how did you escape?

571
00:47:00,257 --> 00:47:01,817
I didn't escape.

572
00:47:03,873 --> 00:47:04,952
I was let go.

573
00:47:08,257 --> 00:47:11,355
I couldn't see the slaughter,

574
00:47:11,425 --> 00:47:12,472
only heard it...

575
00:47:13,857 --> 00:47:14,751
and felt it.

576
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:47,452
Jacob Kell.

577
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:00,022
So, here we are--

578
00:48:00,093 --> 00:48:02,199
Both immortal.

579
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,506
Missed the signs,

580
00:48:04,574 --> 00:48:06,461
didn't we?

581
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:09,973
But we were both
so new at the game.

582
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:14,202
Connor.

583
00:48:15,486 --> 00:48:18,552
What a glorious sight.

584
00:48:20,286 --> 00:48:22,325
Just look, Connor.

585
00:48:24,093 --> 00:48:27,442
Look back at the endless
travesties of your life,

586
00:48:27,517 --> 00:48:29,012
and you'll see me,

587
00:48:29,085 --> 00:48:31,671
always there
waiting in the shadows.

588
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:33,464
When friends and lovers...

589
00:48:33,533 --> 00:48:35,093
are wiped from your sight--

590
00:48:36,157 --> 00:48:37,139
I'm there.

591
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:38,871
When those you cherish...

592
00:48:38,941 --> 00:48:41,875
die abruptly and for no reason--

593
00:48:41,948 --> 00:48:43,802
I'm there for you.

594
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:46,201
And when your cellmates...

595
00:48:46,268 --> 00:48:48,886
in their so-called Sanctuary...

596
00:48:48,955 --> 00:48:51,889
are left twitching
like headless chickens--

597
00:48:53,468 --> 00:48:54,362
Guess who?

598
00:48:59,387 --> 00:49:00,315
Connor.

599
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,616
Stay out of it, Duncan.

600
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:09,177
Would you kill
an unarmed man...

601
00:49:09,243 --> 00:49:10,388
again, Connor?

602
00:49:11,642 --> 00:49:12,536
Oh!

603
00:49:12,602 --> 00:49:15,188
You didn't know, Duncan?

604
00:49:16,379 --> 00:49:19,128
Because you didn't tell him.

605
00:49:19,194 --> 00:49:21,300
Would that finally
put the agony...

606
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,541
in your soul to rest?

607
00:49:23,609 --> 00:49:26,391
Then go ahead.

608
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:28,978
Send me home.

609
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:31,504
What's stopping you?

610
00:49:31,577 --> 00:49:32,854
Honor?

611
00:49:33,881 --> 00:49:35,605
Guilt?

612
00:49:35,674 --> 00:49:37,844
The nagging sense that maybe you,

613
00:49:37,912 --> 00:49:39,189
more than I, deserve to die?

614
00:49:40,665 --> 00:49:42,225
Or somewhere along the way...

615
00:49:42,297 --> 00:49:45,843
did you just lose your nerve?

616
00:49:45,913 --> 00:49:47,158
It's holy ground, Connor.

617
00:49:47,226 --> 00:49:49,080
Ooh.

618
00:49:49,145 --> 00:49:50,672
Yes.

619
00:49:50,745 --> 00:49:53,265
Take your shot.

620
00:49:54,393 --> 00:49:55,953
What better chance than now?

621
00:49:56,024 --> 00:49:58,065
Do it.

622
00:49:58,137 --> 00:50:02,838
Do it for your sweet mother.

623
00:50:02,904 --> 00:50:05,109
Aah!

624
00:50:05,177 --> 00:50:07,926
Or the sweet little war orphan...

625
00:50:07,992 --> 00:50:11,734
Rachel Ellenstein...

626
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:16,049
who, if I'm not mistaken,

627
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,607
you raised
as your own daughter.

628
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:20,751
Tell me, do they even begin...

629
00:50:20,823 --> 00:50:23,125
to equal for the murder
of a man of God...

630
00:50:23,191 --> 00:50:25,263
who raised me as his own son?

631
00:50:25,335 --> 00:50:27,539
Aah!

632
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,612
Slow...

633
00:50:30,678 --> 00:50:32,337
close--

634
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:35,308
Feels good, doesn't it?

635
00:50:35,382 --> 00:50:37,422
But look at you.

636
00:50:38,487 --> 00:50:41,334
Even now, you're afraid--

637
00:50:41,399 --> 00:50:43,090
Afraid you'll lose.

638
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:45,100
That's your true fear, isn't it?

639
00:50:45,174 --> 00:50:47,662
The thought of giving up
your essence to me,

640
00:50:47,734 --> 00:50:51,312
making me
even stronger by it.

641
00:50:53,046 --> 00:50:54,769
What's wrong?

642
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:58,318
Don't you want
to be inside me?

643
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,249
I want you to think back
to this moment, Connor!

644
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:34,411
In the endless nights ahead!

645
00:51:34,484 --> 00:51:35,978
Aah!

646
00:51:49,235 --> 00:51:50,380
And know...

647
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:51,792
Aah!

648
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,746
every time
you close your eyes...

649
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:57,159
from now to eternity,
I'll be there!

650
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:03,147
Ripping apart the ones
you care about most!

651
00:52:03,218 --> 00:52:04,647
Aah!

652
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:16,526
It's never over,
Connor MacLeod.

653
00:52:16,593 --> 00:52:19,244
Living is what matters.

654
00:52:19,313 --> 00:52:22,312
And you will live with this.

655
00:52:22,386 --> 00:52:23,313
Count on it.

656
00:52:23,378 --> 00:52:25,067
One far-off day,

657
00:52:25,138 --> 00:52:27,504
you and I will be
the only two remaining.

658
00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:28,943
You will look back on this...

659
00:52:29,009 --> 00:52:32,806
and know you had
one chance to stop me.

660
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:34,288
You failed.

661
00:52:34,353 --> 00:52:36,175
But until that day,

662
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:38,183
I will take my vengeance...

663
00:52:38,257 --> 00:52:40,198
on those you love.

664
00:52:40,272 --> 00:52:44,298
Your living...
has been my prize.

665
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,538
For old times' sake.

666
00:52:48,272 --> 00:52:50,181
He is your son.

667
00:52:52,591 --> 00:52:57,163
You, on the other hand...

668
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,825
are on borrowed time.

669
00:53:02,895 --> 00:53:04,040
Call you.

670
00:53:08,654 --> 00:53:10,443
Is what he said true?

671
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:15,663
Is it?

672
00:53:15,727 --> 00:53:17,287
Believe only what your heart...

673
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,464
and conscience tell you.

674
00:53:21,647 --> 00:53:23,239
Connor...

675
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,318
with time, anything
can be forgiven.

676
00:53:25,391 --> 00:53:27,081
You taught me that.

677
00:53:32,237 --> 00:53:33,895
Did I?

678
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,522
Oh, look at Dave. Dave!

679
00:54:03,596 --> 00:54:05,003
Behave yourself, Duncan!

680
00:54:05,068 --> 00:54:06,857
No more talking!

681
00:54:06,924 --> 00:54:10,666
May all your hardships fade away.

682
00:54:10,733 --> 00:54:12,937
Till night becomes morn,

683
00:54:13,005 --> 00:54:15,852
let love remain
to guide your way.

684
00:54:15,916 --> 00:54:17,890
Till the day we are reborn.

685
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:20,906
Till the day we are reborn.

686
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:22,248
Kiss her, won't you?

687
00:54:30,762 --> 00:54:31,941
Connor?

688
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:36,807
I thought you'd never get here.

689
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:38,947
Connor!

690
00:54:41,994 --> 00:54:45,125
You know
Kate is like us, immortal.

691
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:47,365
Aye. I sensed something
the day we met,

692
00:54:47,434 --> 00:54:48,895
but I wasn't sure.

693
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,839
Well, now you know.

694
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,302
And you know as well as I do...

695
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:58,022
that her Immortality
can only be triggered...

696
00:54:58,089 --> 00:55:01,220
by the shock of a violent death.

697
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,265
Yes, I do.

698
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:04,286
And without such a death,

699
00:55:04,362 --> 00:55:05,703
she will simply
grow old and die.

700
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:07,362
Yes, I know, Connor.

701
00:55:07,433 --> 00:55:09,888
Is that what you came
to tell me on my wedding day?

702
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:12,350
Come on.
Drink up, man.

703
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,906
No.

704
00:55:15,977 --> 00:55:18,180
I was wondering.

705
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:21,512
Does she know?

706
00:55:23,656 --> 00:55:24,549
Why?

707
00:55:29,129 --> 00:55:32,640
Many years
after I was married,

708
00:55:34,919 --> 00:55:36,774
one night...

709
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:39,206
I found Heather
in front of the house.

710
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:42,587
She had a knife in one hand...

711
00:55:42,663 --> 00:55:44,485
and her hair in the other.

712
00:55:44,552 --> 00:55:45,631
When I asked her...

713
00:55:45,703 --> 00:55:47,939
why she had done such
a thing to herself,

714
00:55:48,007 --> 00:55:50,395
she said it was
the one part of her...

715
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,576
that would never age.

716
00:55:52,647 --> 00:55:54,981
It would forever
remain the same...

717
00:55:55,047 --> 00:55:57,469
as when I first
fell in love with her.

718
00:55:58,566 --> 00:56:01,184
That's how she wanted me
to remember her.

719
00:56:01,254 --> 00:56:03,905
Why are you telling me this?

720
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:06,723
Because I once loved a woman...

721
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:08,099
more than life itself--

722
00:56:11,718 --> 00:56:13,627
and I watched her die.

723
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:18,819
Unlike me, you have a choice.

724
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,224
What would you have me tell her?

725
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:38,496
I'd tell her nothing.

726
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:39,579
She wouldn't believe you anyway.

727
00:56:39,652 --> 00:56:41,081
Then I can do nothing.

728
00:56:41,156 --> 00:56:43,392
She's in the flower of her youth.

729
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,144
Enjoy the moment,
and let it pass.

730
00:56:46,212 --> 00:56:48,416
And if it were you in my place?

731
00:56:48,484 --> 00:56:50,426
I was in your place!

732
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:54,780
But I thank God
I never had the choice.

733
00:56:54,852 --> 00:56:56,575
I love Kate,

734
00:56:56,644 --> 00:56:58,684
and I will hold on to her
as long as I can.

735
00:56:58,756 --> 00:57:01,177
And that is all I can do!

736
00:57:06,148 --> 00:57:08,003
Forever, my love.

737
00:57:09,955 --> 00:57:11,581
Until the day we are reborn.

738
00:57:13,219 --> 00:57:14,463
Until the day we are reborn.

739
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:10,590
You haven't lost your touch.

740
00:58:10,656 --> 00:58:11,933
What do you want?

741
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,893
To talk.

742
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,007
Oh, that's a first.

743
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:15,225
I've tried to talk to you
a thousand times--

744
00:58:15,296 --> 00:58:17,084
Get to the point.

745
00:58:17,152 --> 00:58:18,296
I was wrong.

746
00:58:18,367 --> 00:58:19,676
Oh, no, no.

747
00:58:19,744 --> 00:58:21,205
Stealing's wrong.

748
00:58:21,279 --> 00:58:23,320
Lying's wrong.
Killing's wrong.

749
00:58:23,392 --> 00:58:25,246
What you did
goes well beyond wrong.

750
00:58:25,311 --> 00:58:26,652
Fine.

751
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:28,442
I deserve that,

752
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,886
but I want a chance
to make it right.

753
00:58:29,952 --> 00:58:31,806
You want to make it right?

754
00:58:31,871 --> 00:58:32,886
Then give me back the ability...

755
00:58:32,959 --> 00:58:34,682
to have children,

756
00:58:34,751 --> 00:58:37,053
to grow old
with the man I love.

757
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,257
How about anything that
resembles a normal life?

758
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:41,498
And you took it all
away from me.

759
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:42,646
Those things I can't give you.

760
00:58:42,718 --> 00:58:45,653
Oh, something else
you forgot to tell me.

761
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:48,053
Good-bye, Duncan.

762
00:58:48,126 --> 00:58:49,719
Kell can't give you
those things, either,

763
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:53,434
so tell me, Kate, why him?

764
00:58:53,502 --> 00:58:54,996
Because I've never
known anybody...

765
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:57,656
with such a capacity for hate--

766
00:58:57,726 --> 00:58:58,969
Except me.

767
00:58:59,037 --> 00:59:02,136
That's what's kept you
going all these years?

768
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,132
Hmm?

769
00:59:05,597 --> 00:59:06,545
Fine.

770
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:09,939
Go home, Faith.

771
00:59:11,676 --> 00:59:14,043
Take care of what's important.

772
01:00:32,985 --> 01:00:36,334
You were with him.

773
01:00:38,073 --> 01:00:40,341
A woman is a temple...

774
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:43,889
built on a sewer.

775
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:49,455
Remember what you were
when I first found you.

776
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,453
A whore.

777
01:00:54,679 --> 01:00:57,461
Now, look at you.

778
01:00:57,527 --> 01:00:59,797
A liberated whore.

779
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,008
Fuck you.

780
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:04,560
Oh, we'll get to that, blossom.

781
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:06,606
But in the interim, be grateful...

782
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:10,160
I don't take
your pretty little face off.

783
01:01:10,232 --> 01:01:13,265
Hurts, doesn't it...

784
01:01:14,647 --> 01:01:18,192
that there is something
you actually can't have?

785
01:01:19,479 --> 01:01:22,293
Hmm. I can have...

786
01:01:22,358 --> 01:01:24,725
anything I want.

787
01:01:26,198 --> 01:01:28,085
Except me.

788
01:01:31,126 --> 01:01:34,061
I've already had you.

789
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,560
Not really.

790
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:48,241
Close enough.

791
01:03:58,671 --> 01:03:59,816
Forever.

792
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:37,291
May love remain
to guide our way...

793
01:04:37,357 --> 01:04:39,113
till the day we are reborn.

794
01:04:44,109 --> 01:04:45,668
Forgive me.

795
01:04:47,277 --> 01:04:48,837
Uhh!

796
01:05:02,316 --> 01:05:04,771
I'm sorry.

797
01:05:06,411 --> 01:05:09,094
You had no right.

798
01:05:25,579 --> 01:05:27,106
Uhh!

799
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,685
Kate?

800
01:05:31,755 --> 01:05:33,183
No. Don't be frightened.

801
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:34,404
You're immortal.
We both are.

802
01:05:34,474 --> 01:05:36,416
Aah!

803
01:05:36,491 --> 01:05:37,384
Uhh!

804
01:05:38,955 --> 01:05:41,856
I did it for you--

805
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:42,878
For us.

806
01:05:42,954 --> 01:05:44,361
- Uhh!
- Kate.

807
01:05:44,425 --> 01:05:45,319
Kate?

808
01:05:45,385 --> 01:05:46,465
Oh, no!

809
01:05:46,538 --> 01:05:47,650
Oh, no.

810
01:05:47,721 --> 01:05:49,128
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

811
01:05:49,193 --> 01:05:50,720
Kate!

812
01:05:50,793 --> 01:05:52,996
You wanted this.

813
01:05:53,064 --> 01:05:56,131
You forced it on me.

814
01:05:56,201 --> 01:05:58,240
I never asked for eternity.

815
01:05:59,817 --> 01:06:02,664
I never wanted us to be apart.

816
01:06:06,601 --> 01:06:07,877
Would you have really understood?

817
01:06:07,944 --> 01:06:09,220
Which part?

818
01:06:09,288 --> 01:06:12,636
The endless, numbing
sameness of it all?

819
01:06:12,712 --> 01:06:14,916
Or never bothering
to love someone...

820
01:06:14,984 --> 01:06:18,082
because whole lifetimes
tick by so fast...

821
01:06:18,151 --> 01:06:19,362
they don't even count anymore?

822
01:06:22,088 --> 01:06:23,364
Then why did you come?

823
01:06:24,744 --> 01:06:28,059
To see if I could feel again--

824
01:06:28,136 --> 01:06:29,891
Anything.

825
01:06:47,494 --> 01:06:49,501
You're missing the point, Kate.

826
01:06:49,574 --> 01:06:51,811
The difference
between Connor and I...

827
01:06:51,878 --> 01:06:53,219
is that as long
as you're still alive,

828
01:06:53,287 --> 01:06:55,109
there's a chance that one day...

829
01:06:55,174 --> 01:06:56,101
I might be forgiven.

830
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:58,076
It may take years--

831
01:06:59,238 --> 01:07:00,645
Centuries, even.

832
01:07:02,022 --> 01:07:04,028
But at least I can
carry that hope inside me.

833
01:07:04,101 --> 01:07:06,555
That's one blessing
of immortality--

834
01:07:08,485 --> 01:07:10,395
There's always tomorrow.

835
01:07:12,804 --> 01:07:13,918
Even for us.

836
01:07:31,652 --> 01:07:34,751
What are you doing, Jin?

837
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,248
Just thinking.

838
01:07:37,796 --> 01:07:39,357
Men, for the most part,

839
01:07:39,428 --> 01:07:40,834
can mend their ways...

840
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,617
only after they have made
a mistake.

841
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:46,746
One day soon,

842
01:07:46,819 --> 01:07:48,728
we will all...

843
01:07:48,803 --> 01:07:51,170
serve very little purpose to Kell,

844
01:07:51,235 --> 01:07:52,828
except dead.

845
01:08:08,003 --> 01:08:09,247
A toast.

846
01:08:11,362 --> 01:08:13,185
I see tonight...

847
01:08:14,275 --> 01:08:17,090
as a celebration of the spirit.

848
01:08:18,626 --> 01:08:20,382
To all of you...

849
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:22,272
who continue to stand by me--

850
01:08:22,338 --> 01:08:24,607
even those who might waver...

851
01:08:24,674 --> 01:08:26,397
at times--

852
01:08:27,682 --> 01:08:30,997
You are my flock.

853
01:08:32,289 --> 01:08:33,217
You...

854
01:08:33,281 --> 01:08:35,648
nourish my soul.

855
01:08:38,753 --> 01:08:40,989
You are all a part...

856
01:08:41,057 --> 01:08:43,227
of a great journey--

857
01:08:43,296 --> 01:08:46,078
a 400-year quest--

858
01:08:47,968 --> 01:08:49,343
for justice.

859
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,094
And here, my friends,

860
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:58,135
is the instrument
of that justice--

861
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,084
The giver...

862
01:09:01,153 --> 01:09:03,542
and taker of creation...

863
01:09:05,632 --> 01:09:08,349
baptized in blood.

864
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:12,253
It is the living...

865
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,524
that matters...

866
01:09:14,592 --> 01:09:15,965
after all.

867
01:09:20,575 --> 01:09:22,680
It sings like an angel.

868
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,720
Just listen.

869
01:09:34,430 --> 01:09:35,805
Uhh!

870
01:09:41,757 --> 01:09:42,651
Uhh!

871
01:09:50,397 --> 01:09:51,891
Uhh!

872
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:06,489
Till the day we are reborn.

873
01:10:17,276 --> 01:10:18,486
Ohh!

874
01:10:26,011 --> 01:10:28,531
Ohh!

875
01:10:28,603 --> 01:10:32,760
Aah!

876
01:10:32,827 --> 01:10:34,736
Uhh!

877
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:02,453
Kell.

878
01:11:03,737 --> 01:11:05,046
Jacob Kell.

879
01:11:13,401 --> 01:11:14,349
Connor?

880
01:11:26,904 --> 01:11:30,068
We've lived many lives,
you and I.

881
01:11:30,136 --> 01:11:31,697
We've seen things...

882
01:11:31,769 --> 01:11:35,150
that most people
could never understand.

883
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:38,126
But now what do you see?

884
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,851
I see someone who would
never kill an unarmed man.

885
01:11:42,295 --> 01:11:46,551
I also see someone
who has lost hope.

886
01:11:46,616 --> 01:11:48,950
Life brings hope and pain...

887
01:11:51,287 --> 01:11:54,135
but revenge
never brings redemption.

888
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,014
The path and choice are ours.

889
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:05,420
Connor, what the hell's going on?

890
01:12:05,494 --> 01:12:08,276
I have chosen mine.

891
01:12:08,342 --> 01:12:09,236
Aah!

892
01:12:09,303 --> 01:12:10,383
What are you doing?

893
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:11,599
Kell's too strong,

894
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,907
and he's getting stronger.

895
01:12:13,974 --> 01:12:15,948
Neither one of us can beat him alone.

896
01:12:17,495 --> 01:12:18,901
Are you out of your mind?

897
01:12:20,214 --> 01:12:22,286
Aah! If we let him win,

898
01:12:22,357 --> 01:12:23,732
it could mean the end.

899
01:12:29,398 --> 01:12:31,024
Connor, no!

900
01:12:32,662 --> 01:12:35,563
Kell is going
to kill you, Duncan,

901
01:12:35,638 --> 01:12:37,427
just to torment me,

902
01:12:37,494 --> 01:12:39,152
and there is nothing
you can do about it--

903
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:40,301
Nothing!

904
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:41,715
I don't believe that, Connor.
Neither should you.

905
01:12:41,781 --> 01:12:44,629
Alone, neither one of us
can beat him.

906
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:45,675
Together, we can.

907
01:12:45,748 --> 01:12:48,083
You know the rules.

908
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:49,971
Only one Immortal
can challenge another.

909
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,195
And only one will.

910
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:54,349
This isn't the answer.

911
01:12:54,421 --> 01:12:56,689
Listen to me.

912
01:12:56,756 --> 01:12:57,738
In the end,

913
01:12:57,813 --> 01:12:59,820
there can be only one,

914
01:12:59,892 --> 01:13:01,386
and that has to be you.

915
01:13:04,372 --> 01:13:05,299
No.

916
01:13:06,611 --> 01:13:07,724
We can beat him together.

917
01:13:07,796 --> 01:13:10,184
Then we are in agreement.

918
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:21,681
Enough, Connor!

919
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:23,913
I won't fight you.

920
01:13:23,988 --> 01:13:26,835
I will never fight you, Connor.

921
01:13:26,899 --> 01:13:28,786
Then you die!

922
01:13:40,338 --> 01:13:41,232
Uhh.

923
01:13:54,609 --> 01:13:57,903
No! You're not
doing this, Connor.

924
01:13:57,969 --> 01:14:00,303
Oh, yes, we're doing this.

925
01:14:00,368 --> 01:14:01,645
Every day,

926
01:14:01,713 --> 01:14:05,291
every breath we took
was for this end.

927
01:14:08,592 --> 01:14:11,854
Look inside
and tell me I'm wrong.

928
01:14:30,928 --> 01:14:32,455
Aah!

929
01:14:34,287 --> 01:14:36,491
Aah! Aah!

930
01:14:41,646 --> 01:14:43,054
Do it!

931
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:48,013
I can't.

932
01:14:51,214 --> 01:14:53,418
Remember how
you first found me?

933
01:14:53,486 --> 01:14:55,461
Sitting in that bloody bog,

934
01:14:55,535 --> 01:14:57,738
scared out of my mind?

935
01:14:57,806 --> 01:14:59,562
You taught me
how to live, Connor.

936
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:00,808
You taught me why we live.

937
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,812
Have you forgotten all of that?

938
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:07,085
No.

939
01:15:09,390 --> 01:15:11,113
Our bonds...

940
01:15:11,182 --> 01:15:15,273
are all that hold us
in this world.

941
01:15:15,342 --> 01:15:17,197
Don't break this one.

942
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:23,111
Please, Connor.

943
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:24,555
I'm begging you.

944
01:15:29,005 --> 01:15:30,378
It's too late.

945
01:15:37,516 --> 01:15:39,883
This has to be done.

946
01:15:39,948 --> 01:15:41,225
Haah!

947
01:15:44,363 --> 01:15:45,443
No, Connor!
Not like this!

948
01:15:45,515 --> 01:15:46,890
Come on, stop!

949
01:15:46,956 --> 01:15:48,744
Connor, stop!

950
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:49,640
Duncan!

951
01:15:53,836 --> 01:15:56,420
One of us has to die now,
old friend.

952
01:15:58,412 --> 01:15:59,306
No.

953
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,782
And you know it.

954
01:16:05,835 --> 01:16:06,762
No.

955
01:16:10,443 --> 01:16:11,817
Good-bye, Duncan,

956
01:16:13,387 --> 01:16:14,794
my true brother.

957
01:16:17,993 --> 01:16:20,165
I love you, Connor.

958
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:29,984
Aah!

959
01:16:32,586 --> 01:16:34,625
No!

960
01:16:41,386 --> 01:16:45,760
Aah!

961
01:19:04,354 --> 01:19:05,369
Duncan.

962
01:19:06,561 --> 01:19:08,285
Well done.

963
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:15,543
I ever thought
you had him in you.

964
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:20,988
What does it feel like
to kill a brother?

965
01:19:22,016 --> 01:19:23,707
Feels good,

966
01:19:23,776 --> 01:19:25,980
doesn't it?

967
01:19:26,048 --> 01:19:28,700
You'll never know, will you?

968
01:19:30,817 --> 01:19:34,112
Now you'll never have
Connor MacLeod's head.

969
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:38,198
Are you going to run?

970
01:19:38,273 --> 01:19:40,890
Are you going to hide?

971
01:19:43,583 --> 01:19:44,893
Run?

972
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:45,908
Uhh!

973
01:19:45,984 --> 01:19:47,294
Aah!

974
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:49,597
Brother, come on!

975
01:19:49,664 --> 01:19:51,803
Aah!

976
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:55,516
Aah!

977
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:02,171
- Aah!
- Aah!

978
01:20:26,558 --> 01:20:28,413
How bad do you
want it, Duncan?

979
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:32,627
You'll pay!

980
01:20:56,636 --> 01:20:57,618
Ahh!

981
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:19,065
Ohh!

982
01:21:28,379 --> 01:21:29,786
Duncan!

983
01:22:48,887 --> 01:22:52,018
Okay, Kell. Come on.
Let's do this.

984
01:23:03,063 --> 01:23:05,070
Just watch.

985
01:23:27,413 --> 01:23:30,130
Merry Christmas.

986
01:23:50,644 --> 01:23:52,531
A valiant effort, Duncan.

987
01:23:53,588 --> 01:23:55,377
Too bad.

988
01:23:55,444 --> 01:23:57,865
And this is
just the beginning.

989
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:00,460
You see, when
you absorbed Connor's spirit,

990
01:24:00,532 --> 01:24:03,314
you inherited his curse.

991
01:24:03,379 --> 01:24:04,459
Revenge...

992
01:24:04,531 --> 01:24:06,025
is so sweet.

993
01:24:06,099 --> 01:24:08,717
I wonder who we'll start with?

994
01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:15,984
Oh, Kate.

995
01:24:19,218 --> 01:24:20,112
Forever.

996
01:24:21,586 --> 01:24:23,113
Oh, God.

997
01:24:24,787 --> 01:24:25,735
Kell!

998
01:24:27,538 --> 01:24:29,294
Jacob Kell!

999
01:24:31,537 --> 01:24:33,359
Revenge...

1000
01:24:33,425 --> 01:24:36,492
will never bring you redemption,

1001
01:24:36,562 --> 01:24:39,115
so I'm going to do it for you.

1002
01:24:40,753 --> 01:24:41,769
Aah!

1003
01:24:44,113 --> 01:24:46,666
Is that all you've got?

1004
01:24:55,441 --> 01:24:56,717
Dunc,

1005
01:24:56,784 --> 01:24:58,213
I'd thought
I'd be home for dinner...

1006
01:24:58,288 --> 01:25:00,655
an hour ago, but
this is very impressive.

1007
01:25:02,449 --> 01:25:03,757
Come on.

1008
01:25:03,824 --> 01:25:05,482
Come on.What are you
waiting for?

1009
01:25:05,552 --> 01:25:07,243
I'd be delighted.
Yaah!

1010
01:25:18,512 --> 01:25:20,266
Impressive...

1011
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:22,470
isn't it?

1012
01:25:22,543 --> 01:25:23,972
Uhh!

1013
01:25:24,048 --> 01:25:24,996
Duncan!

1014
01:25:30,222 --> 01:25:34,216
You see at last your fate!

1015
01:25:34,287 --> 01:25:35,880
Yes!

1016
01:25:35,951 --> 01:25:37,260
Because this game is done!

1017
01:25:42,735 --> 01:25:44,360
Uhh!

1018
01:25:45,582 --> 01:25:46,956
Well, look on the bright side.

1019
01:25:47,022 --> 01:25:49,640
At least
you went down swinging.

1020
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:50,888
Jacob Kell.

1021
01:25:52,974 --> 01:25:55,013
Time for redemption.

1022
01:25:57,965 --> 01:26:00,518
The game isn't over yet.

1023
01:26:01,934 --> 01:26:02,981
What's the matter?

1024
01:26:03,053 --> 01:26:06,349
Don't you want to be inside me?

1025
01:26:09,069 --> 01:26:10,182
In the end--

1026
01:26:10,252 --> 01:26:13,002
...there can be only one.

1027
01:26:23,532 --> 01:26:25,157
And you're not it.

1028
01:26:25,228 --> 01:26:26,822
Uhh!

1029
01:26:26,893 --> 01:26:28,321
Call ya.

1030
01:26:49,067 --> 01:26:52,897
No!

1031
01:26:57,515 --> 01:26:59,370
Aah!

1032
01:28:00,424 --> 01:28:03,238
Hope you found peace,
my friend.

1033
01:29:35,138 --> 01:29:37,211
So, why are you here?

1034
01:29:37,282 --> 01:29:39,420
You hoping you'd find me?

1035
01:29:42,018 --> 01:29:43,840
For whatever reason,
Kell made his choice.

1036
01:29:47,745 --> 01:29:50,265
So, um,

1037
01:29:50,337 --> 01:29:51,930
what now?

1038
01:29:54,658 --> 01:29:56,928
Trust.

1039
01:29:56,994 --> 01:29:59,328
You can always trust me, Faith.

1040
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:01,631
Faith is dead.

1041
01:30:01,698 --> 01:30:04,894
I thought we'd give
Kate another chance.

1042
01:30:15,233 --> 01:30:17,949
Not yet.

1043
01:30:18,016 --> 01:30:19,707
Till the day we are reborn.

1044
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:22,329
You hold onto it for me.

1045
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,188
We've got plenty of time.
