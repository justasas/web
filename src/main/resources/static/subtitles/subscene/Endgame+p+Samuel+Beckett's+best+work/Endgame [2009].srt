1
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,033
This is an illegal gathering.

2
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,233
You must disperse immediately.

3
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,450
Stay down.

4
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,322
Pass.

5
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,007
You're in Soweto.
Why?

6
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,923
My sister lives in District Three.

7
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,199
What's in the back?

8
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,243
Furniture.

9
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,811
Wait.

10
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,413
Okay, it's fine.

11
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,944
He was out collecting wood
with his father and his sister.

12
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:22,004
The Police came out of nowhere and
grabbed us and took us to the bridge.

13
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,823
They took my dad and tied him
in a canvas bag...

14
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,046
and dropped him into the river.

15
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:37,057
They made us watch him drown.

16
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:47,587
They told us to go home and tell
the others the price for being ANC.

17
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,579
We have a word...

18
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,664
'Ubuntu'.

19
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,511
It means a person's humanity...

20
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,285
is measured according to their
relationship with others.

21
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,659
We tell the children that these
people, who commit these crimes...

22
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,956
have lost their humanity...

23
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,937
and are as much victims
of Apartheid as we are.

24
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,058
Who the hell is he?

25
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,546
He's a friend I can vouch for him.

26
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,754
He's here to help.
He's from Consolidated Goldfields.

27
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,990
To talk about fund raising for our
schools programme.

28
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,383
We didn't ask for his hand-outs.

29
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,559
- Leave him be! Let him be!
- Michael Young.

30
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:41,504
Sir?

31
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,993
Go, go, go!

32
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,828
- It's Michael Young.
- What progress?

33
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,577
This isn't going to work for us.
We need to aim higher.

34
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,637
Safer to stay in the foothills.

35
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,894
The more visible, the more
vulnerable we are.

36
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,072
Yes, it's much safer.
Yes.

37
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,889
A bit of hush.

38
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,639
It is my pleasure to present
Thabo Mbeki.

39
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,709
The African National Congress'
Head of Information...

40
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,461
who is here representing
the ANC president, Oliver Tambo.

41
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,380
I know that you'll make Mr Mbeki
feel most welcome.

42
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,670
My name is Thabo Mbeki...

43
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,670
and I am a terrorist.

44
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,998
No doubt, that is what you
have been told.

45
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,656
No incendiary devices.

46
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,078
No concealed weapons.

47
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,387
I am just a man, as you are.

48
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,875
Every day the President
of South Africa...

49
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,889
under the mantle of his State
of Emergency...

50
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,758
deploys thousands more of
his troops in the townships...

51
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:52,699
brutally crushing the rising
resistance to his oppressive regime.

52
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:57,606
Yet, the UK, is still one of South
Africa's leading trading partners.

53
00:08:57,641 --> 00:08:59,037
Every company...

54
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:03,015
every financial institution
which continues to invest there...

55
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,960
is a source of political and economic
strength to P.W. Botha.

56
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:13,452
If it is true that money talks,
then let it speak, clearly.

57
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:19,646
Let your voice join ours when we say
the bloodshed of our people must end.

58
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,590
The time to shout 'enough' has come.

59
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:28,102
The time for you to act is here.

60
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,365
Mr Mbeki?

61
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:52,911
Michael Young.

62
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,269
Public Affairs Director,
Consolidated Goldfields.

63
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,241
Tell me how we can help.

64
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:06,120
It's not an offer to make lightly,
Mr Young. We might take you up on it.

65
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:07,732
It wasn't made lightly.

66
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,860
As you say, we too have an incentive
to ensure your country's survival.

67
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,574
We have this recurring
nightmare, Mr Young...

68
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,220
that one day the South African
Government will send us a message...

69
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:27,317
indicating that it is ready to talk
to us about ending apartheid.

70
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,954
Because of our antagonism and
mistrust, we fail to hear the message.

71
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,139
We fail to respond.

72
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,598
We miss the moment.

73
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,123
Thank you.

74
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,709
An apparatchik working for
a reactionary outfit like Goldfields?

75
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:53,951
Is that what it's come to?

76
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,114
The fact that he works for Goldfields
means he'll be listened to.

77
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,124
You know a better entry card?

78
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,332
And if the Public Affairs
thing is just a front?

79
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,885
I doubt he's Ml6.

80
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:10,917
I need a word.

81
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:18,932
He's expecting you.

82
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:22,764
Come in.

83
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,049
I think I have a way forward
on our problem.

84
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,535
I'm listening.

85
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:56,960
Mr Vijoan?

86
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,552
It's Michael Young. I called last
week about the meetings...

87
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,375
I'm trying to set up between
the ANC and leading Afrikaners.

88
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,335
The risk is too great.

89
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,747
I have a young family to think of.

90
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,534
Please don't call me again.

91
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,575
They're just exploratory meetings...

92
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:22,844
and someone representing
the Dutch Reform Church...

93
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,010
who better to act as
a mediator between the two sides?

94
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:30,960
It's not the policy of our church
to involve ourselves in politics.

95
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:33,055
I can't help you. I am sorry.

96
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:25,501
There are those on both sides
who favour force over dialogue.

97
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:29,570
To maintain secrecy, it's best
if we hold the talks in the U.K.

98
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:32,090
In South Africa secrets are
a way of life.

99
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,046
They also have a habit
of exploding in your face.

100
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:36,958
I can't be bothered.
I'm sorry.

101
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,501
- Can I use your toilet?
- Yeah, it's around the back.

102
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,366
Love has a habit of pushing us
into the arms of philosophy.

103
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,271
An earthquake claims a thousand lives.

104
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,206
Families bludgeoned to death
by intruders.

105
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,482
The death of a much loved child.

106
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,462
Such events prompt us to ask
how a benign deity can allow...

107
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,001
such tragedies to happen.

108
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:43,481
The task of Philosophy is to rise above
the futility and chaos of daily life...

109
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:46,139
to seek a deeper truth
to our existence.

110
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,156
I'll finish with the words of Pascal.

111
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,154
'If man's dignity lies in thought...

112
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:01,013
then let us all strive to think well.'

113
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,177
Good day.

114
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,178
Be warned!

115
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,441
Those who have not yet handed in their
assignment on Freedom and the State...

116
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:14,235
will find their own freedom curtailed.

117
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,066
Mr Gruber, make my day.

118
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,412
Treat yourself to a new
typewriter ribbon.

119
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,086
Mr Young, I assume?

120
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,043
An audacious mission
you've undertaken.

121
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,463
A mission impossible,
might be more apt.

122
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,068
What you are asking is impossible.

123
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:57,111
No sane man would put his livelihood,
not to mention his life...

124
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:00,204
on the line
to break bread with the devil.

125
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:03,068
In this country, those who go public
against Apartheid...

126
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,476
acquire the status of a pariah.

127
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,554
Yet, you still agreed
to meet with me?

128
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:14,472
You say Consolidated Goldfields have
agreed to fund these meetings?

129
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,936
Your founder would turn in his grave.

130
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,993
Rhodes knew that market forces
can succeed where politicians fail.

131
00:17:24,028 --> 00:17:26,264
You are being disingenuous.

132
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:30,203
This is about your company protecting
it's investments here, is it not?

133
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:34,414
They know apartheid is an anathema
morally and economically.

134
00:17:34,449 --> 00:17:36,490
They've colluded with it long enough.

135
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:50,037
It's an open secret that a silent
coup has taken place in our country.

136
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:55,006
Botha no longer consults Parliament
or the cabinet...

137
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,749
but rules in the manner of
a medieval monarch.

138
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:03,200
Only his inner sanctum of
security advisors have his ear.

139
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,257
It's they who wield the power,
and they are not interested...

140
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,066
in a political solution.

141
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,298
Like most Afrikaners, I find...

142
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:29,161
the murderous methodology of
the ANC morally repugnant...

143
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:33,408
and the idea of cosying up to them
is abhorrent...

144
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:35,357
even the thought makes me retch.

145
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,421
I'm sorry that you
had a wasted journey.

146
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,289
I am not the man
for your mission.

147
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,854
Get on the move.

148
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,923
If you are not otherwise engaged,
Mr Mandela...

149
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,859
the Minister of Justice invites
you to join him for tea.

150
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,176
I'm told it's cucumber sandwiches
this time.

151
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,957
It seems you
have another visitor, too.

152
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,042
The Head of National Intelligence,
no less.

153
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,153
Doctor Barnard is here?

154
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,678
A moment if you please, Mr Brand.

155
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,833
Copy, control.

156
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,905
Thank you.

157
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,386
Control.
Confirm subject's arrival.

158
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,788
Mr Coatsee.
Good to see you again.

159
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:18,812
Good to see you too, Mr Mandela.

160
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,951
Doctor Neil Barnard is here,
Head of National Intelligence.

161
00:22:22,986 --> 00:22:25,193
He's asked to sit in
on our discussions.

162
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,826
Mr Nelson Mandela.
Doctor Neil Barnard.

163
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:33,963
I've waited a long time
for this opportunity, Doctor.

164
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,877
Likewise, sir.

165
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,786
...used tear gas
to disperse the crowd...

166
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,197
in what a security forces
spokesperson described as...

167
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,401
'necessary measures
to contain the violence'.

168
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,974
And, there were further arrests when
Eugène Terre'Blanche's AWB party...

169
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:31,842
held a recruitment rally,
four people were detained.

170
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:36,109
If they want to take this country
by force and violence...

171
00:23:36,144 --> 00:23:40,758
they'll meet us
over the barrel of a gun.

172
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:42,630
A! W! B!

173
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,270
Michael Young.

174
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:18,263
I cannot stand by and do nothing
while my country is reduced to ashes.

175
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:20,256
I'll come to your meeting.

176
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,918
Let me know where and when.

177
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,792
Doctor Barnard, Mr President.

178
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,434
- Did he take the bait?
- And deny his moment of destiny?

179
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:56,864
- He took it alright.
- Vanity... vanity.

180
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,014
Tambo's waiting to see you.

181
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,834
Oliver, maybe these talks are the
opportunity we've been waiting for.

182
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:29,930
Yes, but not everyone is going
to like it.

183
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,106
Many will see this as a betrayal.

184
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:36,463
So, we need to keep this between us,
and report back only to me.

185
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,799
Be careful, Thabo.

186
00:25:59,024 --> 00:25:59,843
We're in.

187
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,735
Some housekeeping notes.

188
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,482
No telephone communication
with the ANC either...

189
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,567
in Lusaka or here in London.

190
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:12,291
South African Intelligence have our
phones tapped. Yours too, by now.

191
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,805
Don't think because you're back
in London you're not vulnerable.

192
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:20,000
Car and letter bombs are the weapons
of choice of the security agents.

193
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:21,208
Welcome to our world.

194
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,321
The board get wind we're jumping into
bed...

195
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:34,052
with a bunch of Kalashnikov
carrying terrorists...

196
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,062
we'll both be out on our ears.
You realise that?

197
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,758
They can't ignore reality.

198
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,737
Every day Botha gets more isolated,
the country more ungovernable.

199
00:26:43,772 --> 00:26:47,110
Something doesn't give, and soon
the company will go down with it.

200
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,908
You see your role in this as what?

201
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,561
To create a neutral arena
and step aside.

202
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,256
Hope that they can see each other
as men, rather than as enemies.

203
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,983
A risky strategy.

204
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,895
Others are risking more than that.

205
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,857
Heroics don't cut much ice with
shareholders.

206
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:17,913
A 'need to know' basis. Only.
Trust no-one. Confide in no-one.

207
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:22,939
I'll bury the costs under Research
and Development, or some such.

208
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:29,705
Arrangements for my personal affairs
should anything happen to me.

209
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,404
- You think that's likely?
- A precaution.

210
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:37,609
Michael?

211
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,223
If this ever gets out...

212
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:43,796
I shall have to deny all knowledge
of it and, disown you.

213
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,562
And, I'll be nothing,
if not convincing.

214
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,525
Passport? Ticket?

215
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,150
Taxi.

216
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,387
It's okay.

217
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,030
Professor.

218
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,252
In the nick of time.

219
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,994
May I come in?

220
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,246
In public, Botha's still holding
the party line...

221
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:13,557
that you must defeat terrorists before
you can negotiate with them.

222
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:18,391
Privately, he wants you to continue
the dialogue for as long as possible.

223
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,403
The more we know about the ANC's
fault lines in their power structure...

224
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,128
the better we are equipped
to control the end game.

225
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:28,931
So, I am to act as your spy?

226
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,302
A go between is more what
we had in mind.

227
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:42,211
Have you thought why you were chosen
to lead these talks, Professor?

228
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,992
You're a soft target.

229
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:49,225
They think your reputation as an
advocate for social justice...

230
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,097
gives them a way in.

231
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,026
Play along.

232
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,546
Mbeki must think you are just a...

233
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,891
respected academic on
a fact-finding mission.

234
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,336
A soft target is not
a soft touch, Doctor.

235
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,238
I'm going to that meeting to hear
what they have to say.

236
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,576
As importantly for them to hear
what I have to say.

237
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,900
The whole process
is futile otherwise.

238
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,829
Ja, but the thing is,
you see, Professor.

239
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,683
You don't co-operate...

240
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,889
your participation in
the process will be terminated.

241
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,897
My direct line. Call me.

242
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,993
You need to be vigilant
about incendiary devices now.

243
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,531
Always check under your
car before using it.

244
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,760
I'll send my people over
to show you how.

245
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,838
And your ticket?

246
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,725
Don't forget to ring Albi Sachs.

247
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,242
Hello?

248
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,954
This is Thabo Mbeki.
I need a quick word.

249
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,954
He's just left for the airport.
I'll try and catch him, hold on.

250
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:43,854
Albi!

251
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:51,930
Albi!

252
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,393
- Get another line.
- Another line, please!

253
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,975
Background checks on staff. And
they know that security is an issue?

254
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,398
I briefed them this morning.

255
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,299
Brief them every morning.
Just keep hammering it home.

256
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,342
- This is Mr Mambenki's room.
- Mbeki.

257
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,078
- All the rooms are ensuite.
- It's nice.

258
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:10,123
- And, next door?
- His colleague. Mr... Pahad.

259
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,157
Put Professor Esterhuyse
next to Mbeki.

260
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,730
We need to mix them up. Maximise
the opportunity for chance meetings.

261
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,526
- Right.
- Good. Thank you.

262
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:15,908
'Welcome' seems a meagre word
for such an occasion.

263
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:20,136
But, it is no less sincere,
all the same.

264
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,396
Now, as you can see from
the agenda I drew up...

265
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,102
we have a lot of ground to cover.

266
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:31,936
So, if we're to get through it
I think it is essential that...

267
00:34:31,971 --> 00:34:33,404
With respect, Mr Young.

268
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:36,406
Since you are not South African,
it's not your agenda.

269
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,236
It's ours.

270
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,846
And, with respect, Mr Mbeki...

271
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:48,250
I must remind you that the agenda
was agreed by both sides in advance.

272
00:34:56,894 --> 00:35:01,194
Item one.
The ANC perspective.

273
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:10,065
We know that you Afrikaners have
paid in blood for your country.

274
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,906
As, we have.

275
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,162
We know too, that it was from your
suffering...

276
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:17,830
that a system of apartheid
was incubated.

277
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,871
The need to dominate is often
a consequence of survival.

278
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:24,970
Our problem is, as exiles, we are...

279
00:35:25,005 --> 00:35:28,357
outside the political system.

280
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,815
So, we are not in a position to offer
any concessions or compromises...

281
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:34,685
in any potential negotiations with
the government.

282
00:35:37,935 --> 00:35:40,870
If you can't offer concessions,
what can you offer?

283
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,397
All we can do is set out our
stall of demands.

284
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:47,145
The release of Nelson Mandela
and all political prisoners.

285
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,079
The unbanning of all proscribed
political organisations.

286
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:55,314
Only then can a negotiated transition
to majority rule take place.

287
00:35:55,349 --> 00:36:00,515
So, then, we can take it that there
is no truth in the rumour...

288
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:03,417
that the ANC hopes Mandela will
die in prison?

289
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,285
Thus elevating him to the status
of martyr.

290
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,685
You don't think he's achieved
that status already?

291
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,702
That rumour, along with most
information about us...

292
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,647
is based on disinformation.

293
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:17,273
And, the riots and bloodshed
if he does get released?

294
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,436
Can you guarantee you can control
your guerrilla extremists?

295
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:23,208
Controlling Mrs Mandela and her
necklacing would be a start.

296
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:27,036
As would controlling the brutality
of your security police.

297
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,247
Can you guarantee that?

298
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:36,161
There's talk in Pretoria that Botha
is considering...

299
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:39,862
forming a new body to be
affiliated to Parliament...

300
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:45,119
where black representatives can join
the coloured and Indian delegates...

301
00:36:45,154 --> 00:36:47,357
as a prelude to power sharing.

302
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,510
Can we ask your opinion on such
a proposal?

303
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,757
What is yours?

304
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,945
I'm just here on a fact-finding
mission, Mr Mbeki.

305
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,840
Your opinion is the issue.

306
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,011
My understanding is we are not here
to discuss reforming Apartheid.

307
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:05,978
Or, disguising it under some new
administrative structure.

308
00:37:06,013 --> 00:37:08,063
We're here to talk about how
to abolish it.

309
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,804
What we are seeking, is a prelude
to majority rule.

310
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,585
Power sharing, is not an option.

311
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,245
Ah, Professor.

312
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,443
Okay. Good, good.
Gentlemen, please. Good.

313
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,007
Perhaps, if you outline the specific
nature of your fears...

314
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,800
relating to majority rule.

315
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,987
It's not bloody rocket science.

316
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,639
The blacks come after our blood,

317
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,898
and our children get slaughtered
in their beds. That, is the reality.

318
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:32,410
A communist leaning administration
will destroy our economic stability.

319
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:35,072
They'll end up in the same post
colonial chaos...

320
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,286
as the other African states.

321
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,270
Professor?

322
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:42,337
You'll obliterate not only our language
and our culture, but our human rights.

323
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,962
Fear is the first weapon
of the oppressor.

324
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,142
It blinds us all from seeing
the humanity of the other.

325
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,516
Your hands are not
so clean either, Mr Mbeki.

326
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,462
What is your campaign of terror
based on if not fear?

327
00:38:56,497 --> 00:38:59,528
The culture of fear is not of
our making, Professor.

328
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,335
We learnt it at the feet
of our masters.

329
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:13,561
You're looking tired, Mr Mandela.
We've kept you talking too late again.

330
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,637
Fortunately, I had no other
plans tonight.

331
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:23,085
I look forward to our next
conversation, Doctor.

332
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,527
For a moment I thought you said,
'negotiation'.

333
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,096
My ear's playing tricks on me.

334
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,868
Good night, Doctor.

335
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,790
- Mr. Coatsee.
- Good night.

336
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:44,103
Stop all contact with the
other Robben Islanders.

337
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,516
We don't need their
Greek Chorus in his ear.

338
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,372
Alright.

339
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,268
And get him a suit for next time.

340
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,906
We'll get more out of him
if he thinks he's an equal.

341
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,427
Okay. It's a good idea.

342
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,286
I'll leave you to it.

343
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:44,535
I just think things might free up
a bit without an outsider present.

344
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:50,973
Bored with us already?

345
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,920
It's a tactical withdrawal.

346
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:12,825
So, Professor.

347
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,643
When you first saw me,
did you think...

348
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:22,009
'Ah, so that's what a fucking,
communist terrorist looks like'?

349
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:28,551
And, you? Did you think...

350
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:32,738
'Ah, so that's what a fucking
racist Boer looks like'?

351
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,926
No doubt, you assume our claim
to be non-racial...

352
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:41,159
is just a rhetoric of political
convenience, but you are mistaken.

353
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,124
It's what defines us.

354
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,138
And you are mistaken in your
assumptions about us, Mr Mbeki.

355
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:57,459
Our fear doesn't
stem from propaganda...

356
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:02,063
but from the deep rooted knowledge
that one day we will be punished...

357
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,887
for all the terrible wrongs
we have inflicted.

358
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,083
Good night, Professor.

359
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,560
Goodnight.

360
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:05,895
Hello?

361
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,510
Professor?

362
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,795
Can I help you?

363
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,991
Young gave his assurance the place
was clean of bugs.

364
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,716
I couldn't take the chance.

365
00:44:56,293 --> 00:45:01,105
I hope to God, you don't make me
regret what I'm about to do.

366
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:06,335
To the press and parliament,
Botha's still on message that...

367
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,909
you must abandon your weapons before
he'll conduct a dialogue with you.

368
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:19,415
But, my presence here suggests
otherwise.

369
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,061
Botha knows about these talks?

370
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,847
I'm instructed to report back
to him via Doctor Barnard...

371
00:45:32,882 --> 00:45:34,422
in National Intelligence.

372
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:41,059
I'm to be their Trojan horse.

373
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,035
You take a risk telling
me this, Professor.

374
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,476
It would be a risk not telling you.

375
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,591
Without trust, we'll achieve nothing.

376
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,956
Tambo says if we are to...

377
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,807
win our freedom
we must first...

378
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,077
banish bitterness.

379
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,327
This will be the test of it.

380
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:15,761
For all of us.

381
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,238
Get him ready.

382
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:40,125
Let's give him a taste
of what he's been missing.

383
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,011
If you could just turn around.

384
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,279
- Okay. It's good?
- Ja.

385
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:57,336
I've lost the knack
of tying them over the years.

386
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,567
Well, shall we?

387
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,198
Got it. I've got it.

388
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:00,490
Barnard.

389
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,944
Did he enjoy his day of freedom?

390
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,668
Enough to get a taste for it,
let's hope.

391
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,206
- And the UK talks?
- Work in progress.

392
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,147
I need more than that to placate
the bloody doves in Cabinet.

393
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,674
Sir, the Cabinet must know
absolutely nothing about this.

394
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,848
If some loose lips blabs to CNN the
whole process could implode on us.

395
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:21,881
You sold me these talks
to get the inside track on the ANC.

396
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,371
To give us leverage over Mandela.

397
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,919
If you're not going to deliver.
What's the damn point?

398
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,739
I have his exact words
here somewhere.

399
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,447
Leave us.

400
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,183
I do have a home to go to, Doctor.

401
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:07,108
At the risk of invoking more accusations
that I'm gullible and naive, I repeat...

402
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:12,631
In my view, Mbeki, is a man
the government can do business with.

403
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,988
A view based on what?

404
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,450
Your cosy fireside chats?

405
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:25,512
His existential ramblings
about universal suffrage?

406
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:30,689
One can respect a man's commitment
to his ideals...

407
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,185
without sharing his methods
of achieving them.

408
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,933
Forgive me, if I don't also genuflect
at his altar of self government.

409
00:50:39,968 --> 00:50:41,643
Talk is cheap, Professor.

410
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,287
He made no concessions, did he?
Not one.

411
00:50:46,576 --> 00:50:50,728
His so called conversion to moderation
is a ploy, orchestrated by Tambo.

412
00:50:50,763 --> 00:50:51,601
And you...

413
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,083
you fell for it.

414
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,400
- Can I go home?
- Not yet.

415
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,478
Mandela sent his lawyer with
a message for me.

416
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,577
They've isolated him from Sisulu
and the other Robben Islanders.

417
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,210
He's been holding secret talks with
Doctor Barnard from the N.I. S...

418
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,225
who reports back to Botha.

419
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:46,770
I pressed Bizoz on the content
of the meetings.

420
00:51:46,805 --> 00:51:48,544
He claims Nelson said nothing.

421
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:51,837
He wanted to assure me he's
acting in good faith.

422
00:51:51,872 --> 00:51:53,720
He's walking into a trap.

423
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:58,547
Botha knows about the U.K. talks.

424
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:02,097
Barnard recruited Esterhuyse
to act as his informer.

425
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,917
They're playing 'divide and rule'
with us.

426
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,050
Pretoria will claim that
South Africa's most famous prisoner...

427
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:12,665
wanted a peaceful settlement but
the ANC terrorists...

428
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,495
rejected it to pursue their
doctrine of violence.

429
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,709
Madiba would never fall for such
a trick.

430
00:52:17,744 --> 00:52:19,919
How do we know what
his mental state is?

431
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:21,881
The pressure he's under?

432
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:25,702
What concessions he'll make
in return for his freedom?

433
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:33,093
If he's so solid with us
why not tell us what he's doing?

434
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,621
Why exclude you, of all people.

435
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,841
This Esterhuyse,
do you trust him?

436
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:47,635
Yes.

437
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,632
A man you've barely
known a few hours?

438
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,636
Yet, I'm supposed
to doubt a man I've known a lifetime.

439
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,547
Who sacrificed everything for us.

440
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,233
If trust is the issue...

441
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,600
perhaps it is my judgement
which is in doubt.

442
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:04,880
If we let ourselves be tainted
by distrust...

443
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:10,069
Botha's tactics will succeed.
We play into his hands.

444
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:49,679
The bombing came less than 24 hours
after President Botha told parliament...

445
00:53:49,714 --> 00:53:53,074
that security forces had uncovered
a terrorist cell in Natal...

446
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:55,679
and arrested 23 suspected insurgents.

447
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:59,067
We understand that two of
the terrorists evaded capture.

448
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:02,708
Security Forces have stepped up
their search in the Soweto area.

449
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,296
Get in here.

450
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:25,596
I'm home, Marie.
Anyone home?

451
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:41,469
Target is confirmed.
Tomorrow at twelve p.m.

452
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:42,176
Sure.

453
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,963
And the bloodshed
in South Africa today...

454
00:57:48,998 --> 00:57:51,137
after a bomb exploded
outside a shopping centre...

455
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,146
in Roodeport, near Johannesburg.

456
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,227
Four civilians were killed
and 18 others injured.

457
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:59,474
A spokesman claimed that
the target was a nearby bank.

458
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:02,091
He declined to give details on the
operational difficulties...

459
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,669
which caused the explosion.

460
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:11,228
Is that how you justify your campaign
of indiscriminate bombings...

461
00:58:11,263 --> 00:58:13,257
the killing of innocent civilians?

462
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:15,904
We have never supported
the killing of civilians.

463
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,450
Tell that to the women
and children that you maim and kill...

464
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,396
with your limpet bombs and
your pipe bombs.

465
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:24,673
Or are dead children legitimate
collateral damage...

466
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:26,512
to promote your cycle of terror?

467
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:30,017
I can quote you chapter and verse
on dead children, Professor.

468
00:58:30,052 --> 00:58:32,907
Names, ages and dates,
my son included.

469
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:39,701
I think a break
is in order, gentlemen.

470
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:44,419
ANC policy is,
and always has been...

471
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:48,686
that only military and economic
targets are legitimate.

472
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:50,831
If it smells like crap and
it sounds like crap...

473
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,146
chances are, it is crap.

474
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:57,486
Not once have I tried to justify...

475
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,628
the excesses of
the South African Security Forces.

476
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:06,191
Yet, you persist in spouting this
pre-digested dogma at me.

477
00:59:06,226 --> 00:59:11,746
Maybe they think if they say it
enough times, we'll buy it.

478
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:16,129
This really is not productive,
so either we move on...

479
00:59:16,164 --> 00:59:20,511
The timing, of the Roodeport
bomb isn't coincidental.

480
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,752
Lusaka authorised it...

481
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:26,693
in the full knowledge of our meetings.

482
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,653
It's the old terror tactic...

483
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:34,694
once the talking starts,
step up the violence.

484
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:38,253
If you think that's going
to strengthen your hand...

485
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,890
in any negotiations with
the Government...

486
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:45,062
you've seen to it that
all chance of that is off the table.

487
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,150
Frankly...

488
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,471
so are these talks.

489
01:00:21,217 --> 01:00:23,833
- Time to turn up the heat.
- Alright.

490
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,994
Hello, Mr Mandela. Please.

491
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:39,487
Let's talk about Roodeport.

492
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,516
It needed saying.

493
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,925
There was no getting round it.

494
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,746
Perhaps.

495
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,956
But, box a man into a corner and...

496
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,742
The President is running out
of patience, Mr Mandela.

497
01:01:04,777 --> 01:01:07,459
Either, you denounce the communist
links with the ANC...

498
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:08,828
condemn the violence...

499
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:15,541
or, frankly, you and I?
We have nothing further to discuss.

500
01:01:15,576 --> 01:01:19,601
When political movements are forced
underground...

501
01:01:19,636 --> 01:01:21,932
they inevitably are thrown together...

502
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,917
and, no man of honour would desert
a lifelong friend...

503
01:01:28,952 --> 01:01:31,683
at the request of a common enemy.

504
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,696
Gentlemen, excuse us.

505
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:51,301
You're not the only game
in town, Mr Mandela.

506
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,623
Don't you see?

507
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:59,323
This is your chance to seize
the initiative.

508
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:03,326
The ANC think they can bomb
their way into power...

509
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:08,772
but a few words from you,
condemning the violence...

510
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,051
will not only secure your freedom...

511
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:20,368
but will ensure that you alone...

512
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,655
will be the man the Government
deals with.

513
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:29,820
You, alone, can lead us all out
of this impasse.

514
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:40,076
Haven't your years of sacrifice
earned you that right?

515
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:29,580
This is the situation.

516
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:33,541
All ANC bombing operations...

517
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:36,878
fall under the command and
control structure in Lusaka.

518
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:41,065
But, some of our cadres,
believing force to be the only way...

519
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,598
sometimes act without authority.

520
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,534
Operations can get bungled.

521
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,522
Innocent people...

522
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,840
get killed.

523
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,193
But, you have my word...

524
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,516
that I will do everything
in my power...

525
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:05,075
to ensure that civilians no longer
suffer from our inadequacies.

526
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:09,928
Are you telling us that you are unable
to control some of your...

527
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:14,485
renegade cadres, Mr Mbeki?

528
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,799
If you know the truth
of our situation, Professor...

529
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:22,957
you will see that the issue
of violence...

530
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:26,564
is irrevocably connected to
the other issues we wrestle with.

531
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,609
Only when we can participate
in a truly democratic process...

532
01:04:30,644 --> 01:04:35,650
will our armed struggle
become obsolete.

533
01:04:35,685 --> 01:04:40,657
Only then will the conflict
between us end.

534
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:55,783
- How did you sleep?
- Not too bad. You?

535
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,460
Alright, except for terrible
dreams about lawyers.

536
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:00,793
Oh, yes. That is a nightmare.

537
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:05,867
So, anyway, Thatcher is in Moscow...

538
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,642
the crowds in Red Square are all
over her, mobbing her...

539
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,938
She's getting quite queasy with all
this adulation...

540
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:14,488
so, she says to her interpreter,
'I'm not a communist, you know? '

541
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:18,448
And, they shout back,
'Neither are we! '

542
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:33,002
I came here believing what happened
at Roodeport had derailed everything...

543
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,541
you changed that.

544
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:40,039
What you said in that room
will go no further.

545
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:48,930
- Safe home, Willie.
- May I tell you...

546
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,582
how truly sorry
I am about your son.

547
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:00,927
Thank you.

548
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:45,655
Thabo?

549
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:22,094
Come off the road.

550
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:40,442
There was an incident on the way
from the airport.

551
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,278
They were not security agents.

552
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:55,485
Word is out about your talks.

553
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:59,206
Some of the militants will
use any tactics to halt them.

554
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:03,883
For two decades we've said only
force will crush the enemy.

555
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:06,748
Instead of force,
we now preach talks.

556
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:10,428
They see that as a betrayal.

557
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,168
And when you pressed him
on the violence issue...

558
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:17,032
did he admit the ANC high command
now sanction civilian targets?

559
01:10:17,067 --> 01:10:19,594
He made the same point
he has made from the beginning...

560
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,276
cessation of violence...

561
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:25,651
is contingent on the Government
committing to a democratic process.

562
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:38,087
You told him there can be no question
of that while the violence continues?

563
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:41,137
Tell me, Doctor,
should they agree to...

564
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:46,288
give up the armed struggle and
negotiate with the government...

565
01:10:46,323 --> 01:10:48,448
what would you give them in return?

566
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:52,484
You cannot go into negotiation without
bringing something to the table.

567
01:10:52,519 --> 01:10:54,221
Yet you send me in empty handed.

568
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,014
Don't be surprised if I come
back empty handed.

569
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:59,920
You are not empowered
to negotiate, Professor.

570
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:05,467
You're wrong. Doctor.
Talk is not cheap.

571
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,745
It's all we have left.

572
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:44,255
Mr Esterhuyse takes the view that...

573
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,666
before formal negotiations
can take place...

574
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:49,033
concessions, must be made
on both sides.

575
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:53,540
If we make a gesture by
releasing Mandela...

576
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:56,783
I said nothing about making
concessions to Mandela's freedom.

577
01:11:56,818 --> 01:11:59,577
This is no longer a matter
of political survival, sir.

578
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,335
Your policy of buying us time
has created a...

579
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:07,361
a vacuum of uncertainty
that is only fuelling the violence.

580
01:12:07,389 --> 01:12:08,822
You know what I think?

581
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:14,340
This is about your own survival,
covering your own sorry arse.

582
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:19,034
If you are seen to take
the initiative with the ANC...

583
01:12:20,069 --> 01:12:22,833
history will always acknowledge it was
you who had the statesmanship...

584
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:27,241
and vision to pull this country back,
from the brink of civil war.

585
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:29,666
You alone averted that catastrophe.

586
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:33,159
History might also say I took
my hand off the tiller too soon.

587
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:40,544
I give way on Mandela's freedom now,
I give away our trump card.

588
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:42,902
He's a man like any other.

589
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:44,870
The more he gets of it,
the more he'll want it.

590
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,836
Mandela is the key.

591
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:07,950
- Where to today?
- A surprise.

592
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:48,612
Control, confirm
subject arrival.

593
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,597
Everything is alright,
no problems.

594
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:05,935
I hope you like your
new quarters, Mr Mandela?

595
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:09,546
This is Warrant Officer Swart.

596
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,679
He'll look after you.
Do your cooking and so on.

597
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:17,965
We've met before, at Robben Island.

598
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,425
I used to drive you to the quarry.

599
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:24,163
I hope you are a better cook
than you were a driver.

600
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:31,941
Give him the tour.
I'll leave you to settle in.

601
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:36,656
There's three bedrooms.
This is the largest.

602
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:40,469
I'm sure you'll find the bed more
comfortable than you're used to.

603
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:20,939
The departmental conference
is postponed, professor.

604
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:27,013
We know exactly what's going on
in the UK...

605
01:16:27,015 --> 01:16:29,563
between you and
the ANC thugs professor.

606
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:34,726
Think carefully before going next time
or learn to sleep with your eyes open.

607
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:19,970
This is Michael Young.
Please leave a message.

608
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:21,367
This is Esterhuyse.

609
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,483
I suggest...

610
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:27,884
that you make a date for
the next meeting as soon as possible.

611
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,562
- I missed you.
- It's nice to see you back.

612
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,726
Marigolds.
Pansies.

613
01:17:55,637 --> 01:17:59,494
This one is in the wrong place.
It needs more light.

614
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,976
You pick a spot.
I'll fetch a shovel.

615
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,422
Mr President?

616
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,969
Mr President, are you alright?

617
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,143
We need an ambulance now.

618
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,996
Hip, hip, hooray!

619
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,773
Bye bye, Tata.

620
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:59,083
My dear friend.

621
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:05,680
At best, Botha regarded my gilded cage
as a way to seduce me into submission.

622
01:20:07,269 --> 01:20:12,184
But I have had twenty years
to prepare me for this moment.

623
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:17,787
Talking to Barnard was
a high risk strategy...

624
01:20:17,822 --> 01:20:19,998
but you can trust in one thing.

625
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:24,561
That I am not negotiating terms
with the government...

626
01:20:24,596 --> 01:20:28,241
but facilitating the process
for the ANC to do so.

627
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:36,599
Surely, you and I have come too far
to let them divide us now.

628
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:42,750
The election of the new
State President F. W. De Klerk...

629
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:45,228
has sparked a wave
of violence across the country.

630
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:48,997
And sensitivity about
his commitment to reform...

631
01:20:49,044 --> 01:20:50,784
seems to be fuelling the violence.

632
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,868
Mr De Klerk's position
to the right of the National Party...

633
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:57,840
have left some observers
to question his appetite for change.

634
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:02,594
Botha's mistake was his reliance
on his security apparatus...

635
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:05,900
at the expense of protecting
his power base in Parliament.

636
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:10,616
I must tell you, that is a mistake
I do not intend to repeat.

637
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,804
My mistake was accommodating his
plan to try and divide Mandela...

638
01:21:16,839 --> 01:21:19,901
from the ANC in a futile attempt
to cling on to power.

639
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:23,436
My discussions with Mr Mandela have
convinced me that the only way...

640
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:26,243
of doing that now is to give some
of it away and negotiate.

641
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:29,196
Before it's taken from us.

642
01:21:30,452 --> 01:21:32,943
You've been detained
long enough, Doctor.

643
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:36,151
Gentlemen, shall we?

644
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:46,254
Help us end Apartheid now!

645
01:21:46,768 --> 01:21:49,259
I doubt we're looking at
the Messiah of change.

646
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:52,722
De Klerk is a life long
apologist for apartheid.

647
01:21:52,757 --> 01:21:54,744
Presumably that's why his party
chose him.

648
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:58,291
Names for the next meeting.
I've added a new one.

649
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:01,673
- Mix things up a bit.
- Willem De Klerk?

650
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:04,686
- Yes, the President's brother.
- How prescient of you.

651
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:11,297
I'm hoping he's got
his brother's ear.

652
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:14,487
Unlike F.W.,
he's on record condemning apartheid.

653
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:18,034
What if his brother vetoes his
attendance? Along with Esterhuyse?

654
01:22:18,069 --> 01:22:21,241
Esterhuyse is committed now.
Nothing will keep him away.

655
01:22:21,276 --> 01:22:23,818
Unless his passport is revoked.

656
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:39,723
This is the Esterhuyse residence.
We're not home right now.

657
01:22:39,758 --> 01:22:41,757
If you leave a message.
We'll call you back.

658
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:45,737
And you're sure that
he's nowhere in the University?

659
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:48,996
I've tried him at home.

660
01:22:58,073 --> 01:23:01,486
Thabo. Tony. Aziz.
Good to see you again.

661
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,914
- The others aren't here yet?
- They will be. They will be.

662
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:11,523
If he contacts you,
or if you see him...

663
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:14,647
tell him to call Michael Young
as soon as possible.

664
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,567
I'll be waiting by the phone.

665
01:24:01,503 --> 01:24:03,539
Tell him that I can't see him now.

666
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:12,914
The President will be unable
to see you today after all, Doctor.

667
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:15,973
His diary secretary will
be in touch, sir.

668
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,560
Bloody highway pile-up.
Stuck there for hours.

669
01:24:55,595 --> 01:24:56,240
Gentlemen.

670
01:24:56,624 --> 01:24:58,945
- Michael Young, Mr De Klerk.
- How do you do?

671
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,646
Willem De Klerk, Journalist and
political commentator, Thabo Mbeki.

672
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,760
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleasure, sir.

673
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,284
Shall we?

674
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:16,543
You had us worried there.

675
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,402
You don't get rid of me that easily.

676
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,712
My dear friend and comrade.

677
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:55,664
I cannot tell you my relief
to hear from you at last.

678
01:25:56,518 --> 01:26:00,153
Had you contacted me before,
I could have warned you...

679
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:04,079
that yours are not the only talks
taking place with the Government.

680
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:08,146
Your release is high on the agenda
of those discussions.

681
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:11,974
Given the hard line position
of the new State President...

682
01:26:12,009 --> 01:26:15,453
the future of those talks
must now hang in the balance.

683
01:26:16,538 --> 01:26:20,429
Call it what it is, Willie.
Minority rights, equals white rights.

684
01:26:20,464 --> 01:26:22,035
In other words, you want us to
ensure...

685
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:24,567
the privileges whites enjoy
are perpetuated.

686
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:29,562
The idea of group rights is that
no group has dominance over another.

687
01:26:29,597 --> 01:26:30,814
White or black.

688
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:34,694
Isn't that what your non-racial
credo is all about?

689
01:26:34,729 --> 01:26:36,532
But without assurance of that...

690
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:40,198
the President will never come
to the negotiating table.

691
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:43,170
Is that not so, Willem?

692
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:51,667
That's not for me to say, Professor.

693
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:58,499
De Klerk's brother
doesn't give much away.

694
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:02,427
He frequently points out he's
not his brother's keeper.

695
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:07,816
He barely got his feet under
the table, give him time.

696
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:09,119
Time is the enemy.

697
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:13,491
Every day he procrastinates,
is one closer to bloody insurrection.

698
01:27:13,526 --> 01:27:14,985
What is Barnard's sense of him?

699
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:19,863
Barnard's access to the President's
office is not what it used to be.

700
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:24,314
We must rely on his brother
for that now.

701
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:31,167
I thought we might discuss your
impressions of the day, Willem?

702
01:27:31,202 --> 01:27:32,919
I've some excellent brandy
in my room.

703
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:34,471
Another night, perhaps.

704
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,948
My dear friend...

705
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:49,600
our struggle is now at a tipping
point, as is our country.

706
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:53,341
We must try and convince De Klerk
and his government...

707
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:55,950
that the whites have nothing
to fear from us.

708
01:27:56,738 --> 01:28:01,474
It is not revenge that governs
us, but reconciliation.

709
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:06,492
We must use every method open
to us to make him understand...

710
01:28:06,527 --> 01:28:10,235
that unless he acts soon,
we cannot deliver.

711
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:11,484
What is he waiting for?

712
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:13,908
How many more weeks,
how many more months until he acts?

713
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:17,539
And where is he on Mandela? Can he not
see the longer he keeps him in prison...

714
01:28:17,574 --> 01:28:19,744
the more time he is giving
for mob rule to take hold?

715
01:28:19,779 --> 01:28:20,479
Exactly!

716
01:28:20,528 --> 01:28:23,830
I do not have the answers
you're looking for, Mr Mbeki.

717
01:28:23,865 --> 01:28:27,585
My brother is not in the habit of
confiding in me about Government policy.

718
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:29,615
Or anyone else, it seems.

719
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:34,179
Yes.

720
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,725
Yes, I understand well.
Are you absolutely sure?

721
01:28:40,515 --> 01:28:42,210
We can't put it like that.

722
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:49,784
Yes, it's important, but
it's a waste of time.

723
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:22,186
I apologise. I lost track of...

724
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:29,388
Shall we start by returning to
the outstanding items from yesterday?

725
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:31,718
I wonder...
Do you mind, I'm sorry?

726
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,393
On behalf of my brother, I have
some issues for clarification.

727
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:38,605
If you will bear with me.

728
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:44,867
One...

729
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:50,658
when would it be possible for
the ANC to embark on talks...

730
01:29:50,693 --> 01:29:54,703
about how to progress formal
negotiations with the Government?

731
01:29:54,738 --> 01:29:56,020
Two.

732
01:29:56,057 --> 01:30:00,050
What would your preconditions
be to such talks...

733
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:04,607
and, three... what agenda
would be acceptable to you?

734
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:22,728
You can... tell the President...

735
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:29,433
there will be no preconditions
on our side...

736
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:36,598
and we leave it to him
to determine the agenda.

737
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:40,327
As for timing...

738
01:30:44,172 --> 01:30:46,185
we are ready when he is.

739
01:31:00,221 --> 01:31:04,624
And your position on the cease
fire of violence?

740
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:08,939
We would order that all violence
be suspended...

741
01:31:08,974 --> 01:31:10,966
while negotiations take place.

742
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:15,661
When a new constitution
has been agreed...

743
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:19,779
we will give the instruction that
the armed struggle...

744
01:31:21,309 --> 01:31:23,413
is to be abandoned.

745
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:33,802
Oliver.

746
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:37,863
Thabo.

747
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:43,786
Would you read this for me, please?

748
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,179
"Although we have been apart
all these years..."

749
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:55,984
It's as if I've been conducting
a lifelong conversation...

750
01:32:56,019 --> 01:32:57,665
with you in my head.

751
01:33:00,975 --> 01:33:05,890
All I pray now, is that you recover
so, God willing...

752
01:33:05,925 --> 01:33:08,815
we can continue it face to face.

753
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:13,689
As for my freedom...

754
01:33:14,455 --> 01:33:19,813
it is a secondary matter
until you are strong again.

755
01:33:20,628 --> 01:33:25,509
And, until all those imprisoned
have won theirs.

756
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:30,404
I must be the last
to gain his liberty.

757
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:38,591
He wouldn't give a name,
much less take no for an answer.

758
01:33:44,752 --> 01:33:46,083
Esterhuyse.

759
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:48,735
I suppose the weather's
the usual crap?

760
01:33:50,057 --> 01:33:52,036
Is that what you called to discuss?

761
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:56,996
What time is it over there?

762
01:33:58,532 --> 01:34:01,945
- Noon.
- Turn on your TV. 2 pm, your time.

763
01:34:17,084 --> 01:34:20,524
Now, as we wait for what's been
billed as an historic address.

764
01:34:20,559 --> 01:34:23,964
Let's reflect on the momentous events
of the past few months.

765
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:28,164
The tearing down of the Berlin Wall
and the end of the Cold War.

766
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:31,697
But, South Africa has had many
false dawns.

767
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:35,884
So many speeches which have promised
so much, yet delivered so little.

768
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:40,519
Here now is President De Klerk
flanked by his cabinet.

769
01:34:41,976 --> 01:34:44,672
As he makes his way to the podium,
all of South Africa...

770
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:47,102
and indeed the world,
holds it's breath.

771
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:53,027
My Government has taken the decision
to immediately and unconditionally...

772
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:55,602
release Mr Nelson Mandela.

773
01:34:56,924 --> 01:34:59,176
I've also instructed that the
prohibition...

774
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:02,196
of the African National Congress
the Pan African Congress...

775
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:06,313
and the South African Communist
Party be immediately lifted.

776
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:09,724
The time has come to negotiate.

777
01:35:10,504 --> 01:35:12,927
The hopes of millions
of South Africans...

778
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:14,919
will be centred on that process.

779
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:20,061
We must not falter.
We dare not fail.

780
01:35:21,082 --> 01:35:22,162
Thank you.

781
01:35:26,487 --> 01:35:29,795
We go now to Victor Verster Prison,
where Mr Mandela...

782
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:33,103
the man who's been imprisoned
for nearly three decades...

783
01:35:33,138 --> 01:35:36,643
72 years old, will be
appearing in public...

784
01:35:36,678 --> 01:35:39,180
for the first time, any moment now.

785
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:42,342
International media perched.

786
01:35:43,637 --> 01:35:45,298
The crowd getting excited.

787
01:35:46,173 --> 01:35:46,958
That's him.

788
01:35:47,975 --> 01:35:52,059
And there is Mister Mandela.
Nelson Mandela. A free man.

789
01:35:52,546 --> 01:35:56,061
Taking his first steps into
a new South Africa.

790
01:36:00,054 --> 01:36:03,182
Mrs Winnie Mandela next to him
waving to the crowds.

791
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:05,962
And a salute
from Mr Nelson Mandela.

792
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:10,259
His wife greeting the people who have
been waiting for so long for this day.

793
01:36:14,101 --> 01:36:17,138
This is the man that the world's
been waiting to see.

794
01:36:17,173 --> 01:36:20,551
His first public appearance
in 27 years.

795
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:25,297
The day for which he too,
has waited so long.

796
01:36:49,904 --> 01:36:51,496
We owe you so much more.

797
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:55,675
It takes a big man to make
himself invisible.

798
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,931
Thank you.

799
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:02,708
Thank you. Michael.
Thank you.

800
01:37:09,023 --> 01:37:09,910
Stay safe.

801
01:37:12,626 --> 01:37:13,672
And you...

802
01:37:15,763 --> 01:37:17,264
comrade.

803
