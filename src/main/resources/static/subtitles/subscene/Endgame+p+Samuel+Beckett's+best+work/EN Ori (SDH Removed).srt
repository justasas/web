1
00:03:23,415 --> 00:03:25,666
- Want a hot dog?
- No, thanks.

2
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:28,586
Just ketchup, please.

3
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:32,131
Thanks.

4
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:33,883
Listen, I've got an errand to run.

5
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:39,639
Kind of skimpy on the ketchup.

6
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:42,683
Duncan, I've got to do this alone.

7
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:44,310
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

8
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:47,813
You called me in Paris,
and you said we have to meet.

9
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:51,192
Now suddenly you've
got an errand to run?

10
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:53,527
What's going on?

11
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:55,529
I don't know.

12
00:03:55,656 --> 00:03:57,156
It's...

13
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,451
...nothing.

14
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:02,203
You OK?

15
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:06,791
Yeah. I'm OK.

16
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,417
Really.

17
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:11,837
I know you better
than that, Connor.

18
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:13,923
Haven't seen you like this.

19
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:18,302
People change, Duncan.

20
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:20,596
You'll learn that.

21
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:22,265
Fine.

22
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:24,558
You can tell me
all about it tonight.

23
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:27,311
8:00 at the bar.

24
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:29,855
And you're buying.

25
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:31,565
Right.

26
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:34,026
8:00, and I'm buying.

27
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,199
You sure you
gonna be all right, Connor?

28
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:42,827
Of course. Duncan...

29
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,624
...watch your back.

30
00:05:16,153 --> 00:05:17,695
Connor?

31
00:05:20,198 --> 00:05:21,532
Connor?

32
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,117
'OK.'

33
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:08,662
'What is it, Connor?'

34
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:09,789
'Open it. '

35
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,207
'Oh, a ballerina.

36
00:06:12,876 --> 00:06:14,460
'Wow. She's beautiful.

37
00:06:14,586 --> 00:06:16,337
'Thank you. '

38
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,214
'Mmm, my angel. '

39
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,805
'Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you. '

40
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:26,931
'I love you, Connor. '

41
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:28,224
'I love you, my Rachel.

42
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,767
'Oh, God,
I'm proud of you. '

43
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:30,976
'Thank you. '

44
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:01,715
Hello?

45
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:11,517
Rachel!

46
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:19,275
'Rachel.

47
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:21,444
'My beloved Rachel.

48
00:07:25,615 --> 00:07:28,409
'How long has it been
since she died?

49
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:32,455
'A year?
A century? More?

50
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:34,457
'My mind keeps slipping,

51
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,835
'but some things I know.

52
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:40,838
'I am Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod,

53
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:45,885
'and once,
a very long time ago,

54
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:48,387
'I was a Highlander.

55
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,151
'Born of this land,

56
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:05,362
'and like this land, immortal. '

57
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,208
Witch!

58
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:20,169
You brought
this plague on us.

59
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:22,630
You damned us all,
Connor MacLeod.

60
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:24,131
You sold your soul!

61
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,468
You're a witch!
You child of Satan!

62
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:31,263
They drove you from your home,
cut you off from your own people.

63
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:33,182
What else do they want?

64
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:34,517
Someone to blame.

65
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:36,477
Your mother will burn!

66
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:37,978
Connor.

67
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:41,440
Your mother will burn!
Rot in hell!

68
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,317
Get in the house.

69
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:45,861
Get off my land!

70
00:08:45,987 --> 00:08:47,571
Leave us in peace!

71
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,198
Get off my land!

72
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:56,163
Connor, please.

73
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:58,332
You're not going back to Glenfinnan.

74
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,376
I have no choice.

75
00:09:00,502 --> 00:09:02,169
Connor, please.

76
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:04,588
They can't hurt me,
and they know it,

77
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:07,383
but they can still
hurt the ones I love.

78
00:09:08,301 --> 00:09:09,802
I'm afraid.

79
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:13,222
I love you, Heather.

80
00:09:13,348 --> 00:09:15,224
More than anything in this world.

81
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,434
Do you believe me?

82
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:18,602
Yes.

83
00:09:18,728 --> 00:09:20,396
Then don't be afraid.

84
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:22,815
Nothing can keep me from you.

85
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:29,947
Nothing.

86
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,876
Connor.

87
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:27,421
I thought you might be
the water horse...

88
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:31,258
come to take me on his back
and drown me in the loch.

89
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,727
No one comes
to take care of you?

90
00:10:41,853 --> 00:10:43,270
Not in years.

91
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:45,272
They think I bedevil
their children

92
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:48,734
because my own was banished.

93
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,821
I'm sorry.

94
00:10:52,947 --> 00:10:54,406
I'm so sorry.

95
00:10:56,785 --> 00:11:01,497
Tiny mites
and soured dispositions.

96
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,960
I've no need of them, Connor,
any of them.

97
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:15,177
Then it's settled.
You're coming with me.

98
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:24,561
Connor!

99
00:11:24,688 --> 00:11:26,230
Connor, what is it?

100
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:27,773
I'm not sure.

101
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,191
It happened once before.

102
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:32,778
Connor!

103
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:41,787
In the name of the Holy See
and the rule of law...

104
00:11:41,913 --> 00:11:42,913
Jacob?

105
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,376
...you are hereby charged,
Connor MacLeod, with heresy

106
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:50,379
and the practise of black magic.

107
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:53,090
We were friends, remember, Jacob?

108
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:54,800
I stood at your ordination.

109
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:56,260
I vouched for you.

110
00:11:56,386 --> 00:11:58,095
You shouldn't have
come back, Connor.

111
00:11:58,221 --> 00:11:59,555
Take him.

112
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:16,405
The ties of blood
cannot be severed by word or deed.

113
00:12:23,747 --> 00:12:25,122
Mother.

114
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:29,376
Due to the infinite compassion

115
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:34,173
you are entitled
to one final opportunity

116
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:36,133
to renounce all that is unholy,

117
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:40,679
and declare Connor MacLeod
not of your loins.

118
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:44,099
How say you,
Caiolin MacLeod?

119
00:12:46,478 --> 00:12:48,854
If your God

120
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,066
should persecute me
into the next world,

121
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:55,944
then I shall simply have
to find myself another.

122
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,990
Burn her!

123
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:02,993
No! No! No!

124
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:06,705
He is your son.

125
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:08,791
I am silent for you.

126
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:17,883
Black powder.

127
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:19,426
It will ease your suffering.

128
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:25,307
Mother!

129
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:31,188
No!

130
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:35,317
No!

131
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:06,974
You're next, you demon!

132
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:45,178
My water horse.

133
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:10,787
The Devil's come back to life!

134
00:15:19,797 --> 00:15:21,924
Let her be, Connor.

135
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:29,681
Father?

136
00:15:30,558 --> 00:15:31,725
Father?

137
00:15:33,353 --> 00:15:35,103
Please.

138
00:15:35,229 --> 00:15:36,897
Do not leave me.

139
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:39,733
Father.

140
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:01,630
Connor...

141
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:46,466
'My endless days
are filled with memories of the past

142
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:50,178
'and the death of my mother
by Jacob Kell. '

143
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,468
Boy, you people are
extremely difficult to find.

144
00:17:29,594 --> 00:17:31,094
We like it that way.

145
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:42,689
Go ahead, man.
Take your pick.

146
00:19:09,443 --> 00:19:11,862
Take their heads.

147
00:19:11,988 --> 00:19:13,488
They might be Immortals.

148
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:15,115
Yes, they might be.

149
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:43,977
Don't be long.

150
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:02,996
The Sanctuary.

151
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:05,832
So it's true.

152
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:18,011
What sacrifices
they have made of you,

153
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:21,848
warehoused like
rotting pieces of meat.

154
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:31,691
Tell me,
is this the better way?

155
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:36,321
I'm sure you've had
time to reflect upon it.

156
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:39,908
What you need to understand

157
00:20:40,034 --> 00:20:42,786
is that I don't care
about the game.

158
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:45,372
I don't care about the rules.

159
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:49,584
I don't even care about
these pathetic souls

160
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,172
you keep locked away
as a barrier to the prize.

161
00:20:54,757 --> 00:20:58,718
Which one is Connor MacLeod?

162
00:22:02,658 --> 00:22:04,159
Well, what do we do now?

163
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,619
What we always do.

164
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:08,747
We're Watchers, not cops.

165
00:22:08,873 --> 00:22:11,041
We'll find another volunteer.

166
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:59,589
'Whatever you fear
about Connor MacLeod,

167
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:01,341
'fear the worst. '

168
00:23:03,386 --> 00:23:04,552
Who is this?

169
00:23:04,678 --> 00:23:06,054
A friend.

170
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:09,432
'Don't bother looking for me, Duncan. '

171
00:23:20,152 --> 00:23:21,986
He's on the move.

172
00:23:31,539 --> 00:23:34,791
Duncan MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

173
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:37,252
Hello, Methos.

174
00:23:37,378 --> 00:23:40,839
What brings you
to my humble abode?

175
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:42,215
Need your help.

176
00:23:43,217 --> 00:23:44,426
Why me?

177
00:23:44,552 --> 00:23:46,386
You've been around
for 5,000 years.

178
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:51,099
I want the benefit of your experience.

179
00:23:51,225 --> 00:23:54,352
And I thought it was a social call.

180
00:23:55,855 --> 00:23:57,564
You ever had nightmares?

181
00:23:58,107 --> 00:23:59,357
What kind of nightmares?

182
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:01,985
Bloody images

183
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:04,237
powerful enough to even
break your meditation.

184
00:24:05,448 --> 00:24:08,450
We live violent lives, MacLeod.

185
00:24:08,576 --> 00:24:10,160
Some of that's
bound to stay with us.

186
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,789
These ones came 10 years to the day
that Connor MacLeod disappeared.

187
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,126
Connor had good reason to go.

188
00:24:18,252 --> 00:24:20,503
He told me how much
Rachel meant to him.

189
00:24:20,629 --> 00:24:24,048
There was more to it than that.
I was with him that day.

190
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:26,009
The day Rachel was killed?

191
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:28,136
Something wasn't right.

192
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:29,762
'Connor, you OK?'

193
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:33,766
'Yeah. I'm OK.
Really. '

194
00:24:33,893 --> 00:24:36,311
'I know you better
than that, Connor.

195
00:24:36,437 --> 00:24:39,689
'I've never seen you like this. '

196
00:24:39,815 --> 00:24:42,775
'People change, Duncan.

197
00:24:42,902 --> 00:24:44,486
'You'll learn that. '

198
00:24:46,614 --> 00:24:48,698
I need to know
if he's still alive, Methos.

199
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:52,410
You know a little
about Buddhist monks.

200
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:54,579
Some of them come
to cherish life so much

201
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:58,708
that to step on an insect
or harm a blade of grass

202
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:00,710
becomes a violation
of their creed,

203
00:25:00,836 --> 00:25:05,089
so they place themselves under
an extreme form of protective custody...

204
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:07,342
A Sanctuary of sorts.

205
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:11,429
Well, for an Immortal
who comes to abhor the bloodshed,

206
00:25:11,555 --> 00:25:13,306
there's a similar solution...

207
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:15,892
A way to be removed
from the game forever.

208
00:25:16,018 --> 00:25:18,561
The price is unimaginably high,

209
00:25:18,687 --> 00:25:24,609
but you are, for all practical purposes,
protected from the violence within you.

210
00:25:24,735 --> 00:25:26,819
And it's called The Sanctuary.

211
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:28,780
Connor would never do that.

212
00:25:28,906 --> 00:25:32,158
Are you sure? It's been around
since before you were born.

213
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,452
At least until last night.

214
00:25:34,578 --> 00:25:36,287
What happened last night?

215
00:25:37,498 --> 00:25:39,165
It was annihilated.

216
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:57,934
'Hey, Duncan,
what's the matter?'

217
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,270
'The British
destroyed the clans, Connor.

218
00:26:01,188 --> 00:26:02,355
'Scotland's finished. '

219
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:05,191
'Scotland will always
be Scotland,'

220
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:07,193
and someday you'll go back.

221
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,820
You can bet on it.

222
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:11,072
- How much?
- Aw, come on.

223
00:26:11,198 --> 00:26:13,866
Does everything have
to be a wager with you?

224
00:26:13,993 --> 00:26:15,868
Well, you're the one
that keeps telling me

225
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:18,162
our lives are nothing
but a boundless game.

226
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,500
Good morning, gentlemen.

227
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:24,168
What seems to be
the problem here?

228
00:26:24,295 --> 00:26:26,963
They refuses to pay her toll, sir.

229
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:28,923
Really? How dare they?

230
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:30,300
These men are rogues.

231
00:26:30,426 --> 00:26:32,677
These men are
liars and scoundrels, sir.

232
00:26:32,803 --> 00:26:35,638
They've done nothing but prey upon us
three years running,

233
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:37,682
right at this very spot.

234
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:40,101
And by whose authority
do you act?

235
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:42,395
By Deed of the King.

236
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:46,316
There is a little 'X' down here.

237
00:26:47,026 --> 00:26:49,444
Does the King always
sign his name with an 'X'?

238
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,945
Excuse me. Sorry.

239
00:26:51,071 --> 00:26:52,572
I think these gentlemen
should be paid.

240
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,157
That deed is a fake.

241
00:26:54,283 --> 00:26:55,533
That's a matter of opinion.

242
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,702
You, sir,
are no better than they.

243
00:26:58,162 --> 00:27:00,204
That is also a matter of opinion.

244
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:01,873
Here you go.

245
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Ladies.

246
00:27:05,336 --> 00:27:06,377
It's gold!

247
00:27:06,503 --> 00:27:08,588
Why not... It's gold.

248
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:11,341
Hey, wait a minute.
They took my money!

249
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:12,800
Oh, it's here.

250
00:27:12,926 --> 00:27:14,344
They took my money!

251
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,678
Let's go get 'em!

252
00:27:16,263 --> 00:27:17,263
Shall we?

253
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:19,932
Aye.

254
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:37,659
Heh heh.

255
00:27:37,785 --> 00:27:39,952
Not bad.

256
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,501
All right boys, time to go.
Let's go!

257
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:48,878
Come on!

258
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:51,881
Oh. Cuckoo.

259
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:54,550
Oh, looks heavy?

260
00:27:54,677 --> 00:27:56,094
Looks like
you lost your edge, lad.

261
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,303
Really heavy.

262
00:27:57,429 --> 00:27:59,764
- Or could he be lass?
- Could be.

263
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,557
Could be.

264
00:28:04,311 --> 00:28:05,436
Hyah!

265
00:28:06,939 --> 00:28:08,356
Come on!

266
00:28:08,482 --> 00:28:10,650
Hyah! Hyah!

267
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:14,070
Hyah!

268
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:07,850
'Corporal Duncan MacLeod,
sir.

269
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:11,312
'I've come to pick up
the wounded. '

270
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:49,934
You've improved greatly.

271
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,144
Ah, you really think so?

272
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:58,359
No.

273
00:30:58,485 --> 00:30:59,944
I'm just being gracious.

274
00:31:02,781 --> 00:31:04,490
Now, remember.

275
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:08,870
You are only immortal as long
as you can keep your head

276
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:10,246
on your shoulders.

277
00:31:15,377 --> 00:31:20,631
Duncan, what you give up
to your adversary in defeat...

278
00:31:20,757 --> 00:31:21,841
...is everything.

279
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:26,971
I know. And at that point,
I'm very, very dead. Come on!

280
00:31:27,097 --> 00:31:30,600
Not just dead, Duncan.
Empty!

281
00:31:33,353 --> 00:31:35,563
Aye, Connor, I know.
It's called the Quickening.

282
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:37,815
Our strength and knowledge,
our life essence,

283
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:41,068
flows into the victor, feeds him,
and makes him stronger, yes?

284
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:44,322
It's what drives the other Immortals
to kill us,

285
00:31:44,448 --> 00:31:47,617
and what forces us to be smarter,
better than the rest.

286
00:31:47,743 --> 00:31:49,827
I understand.

287
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,751
You do?

288
00:31:58,921 --> 00:32:00,421
Good.

289
00:32:01,423 --> 00:32:03,257
I slipped.

290
00:32:03,383 --> 00:32:05,676
Listen, soon you
and I will have to part.

291
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:09,972
There is one more thing
I want to give to you.

292
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:13,809
Va via. Va via!

293
00:32:13,936 --> 00:32:16,270
Oh, aye!

294
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:19,482
Oh, aye.
This is much more to my liking.

295
00:32:19,608 --> 00:32:20,983
Good.

296
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:25,780
Attack me.

297
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:28,908
But you've got your back to me.

298
00:32:30,202 --> 00:32:32,954
It's not always
about strength, Duncan.

299
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,455
Attack me!

300
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:44,924
It's about manipulation of the mind...

301
00:32:48,845 --> 00:32:50,304
...as well as the body.

302
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,140
Aye, but now I'm in control.

303
00:32:53,934 --> 00:32:55,476
Are you?

304
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:05,903
Remember well, my friend.

305
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:09,407
Properly executed,
this move is unstoppable.

306
00:33:10,993 --> 00:33:14,078
Properly executed,
we'll now have this talk again.

307
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:39,311
Who are you?

308
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:42,106
A friend or a lover.

309
00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:44,191
Or a wife.

310
00:33:44,317 --> 00:33:46,360
- Kate?
- Atta boy.

311
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:49,321
Except I'm Faith now.

312
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:52,867
Part of the makeover.

313
00:33:52,993 --> 00:33:54,243
What are you doing here?

314
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,121
Remember our wedding day,
Duncan?

315
00:33:58,123 --> 00:34:00,124
I do.

316
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,835
The way we danced.

317
00:34:04,421 --> 00:34:06,172
I felt like we were flying.

318
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:18,601
Of course, we did come down,
didn't we?

319
00:34:21,938 --> 00:34:23,481
Crashing.

320
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:28,778
Oh, shit.

321
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:43,584
It's time to show
our Immortal brother a thing or two.

322
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:55,429
Somebody order a club sandwich?

323
00:34:55,555 --> 00:34:57,932
He's funny.
Nice outfit, too.

324
00:34:58,058 --> 00:35:00,768
Faith, I told you
I look like a fuckin' orange!

325
00:35:00,894 --> 00:35:03,354
I'm not dressing you black, Bob.
Trust me.

326
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,481
- Who are they?
- Friends.

327
00:35:07,234 --> 00:35:09,026
What, it's a team sport now?

328
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:10,444
What, you didn't know?

329
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,196
It's a whole new ball game.

330
00:35:34,553 --> 00:35:35,803
Hey!

331
00:35:36,721 --> 00:35:38,305
Nice bat.

332
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:52,778
Told you I was gonna cut you.

333
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:13,424
Let my man Jin Ke
deal with him.

334
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:18,220
Jin Ke...

335
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:20,097
...who served
with the Emperor Chin.

336
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,433
The same man.

337
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,518
Some people say
you're a man of honour.

338
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:26,604
What do you know about honour?

339
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:30,024
Oh, great.

340
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,651
Yah!

341
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:19,406
Honour's not in a weapon.

342
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:20,866
It's in the man.

343
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,604
Enough!

344
00:37:54,192 --> 00:37:56,402
Boys, boys.

345
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,154
I do apologise.

346
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:01,699
When it comes to discipline,

347
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:05,744
the first hundred years
are the hardest.

348
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:16,755
Guess I'm not much
of a swords guy.

349
00:38:16,881 --> 00:38:21,385
I thought I told you to stop.

350
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:25,556
Yeah, well, I stopped.

351
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:26,724
Tell me, Carlos.

352
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,268
How much is your life worth?

353
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:31,812
Don't start this bullshit, man.

354
00:38:31,938 --> 00:38:34,565
'Cause the only way
to win your freedom

355
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:36,317
is to kill me.

356
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:38,986
- You're crazy.
- Am I?

357
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:40,571
Then go ahead.

358
00:38:40,697 --> 00:38:43,532
Stop the madness.

359
00:38:45,327 --> 00:38:48,495
Can you live with the fear?

360
00:38:48,621 --> 00:38:51,415
Can you live
with the weakness?

361
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:58,005
Weakness, Carlos.

362
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:04,428
I call this

363
00:39:04,554 --> 00:39:07,139
decap with a twist...

364
00:39:07,265 --> 00:39:08,599
No sugar.

365
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:58,190
Watchers?

366
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:02,861
Watchers observe Immortals.

367
00:40:02,987 --> 00:40:04,863
They're not supposed to interfere.

368
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:07,658
Unfortunately, our role
has changed somewhat.

369
00:40:07,784 --> 00:40:09,201
Why?

370
00:40:09,327 --> 00:40:11,036
Because the rules have been broken.

371
00:40:11,162 --> 00:40:15,416
One of your kind has gone renegade.

372
00:40:18,044 --> 00:40:20,462
In doing so, he's gained
himself a sizable advantage.

373
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:22,923
One that'll be
impossible to overcome.

374
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:24,508
Nobody's unbeatable.

375
00:40:24,634 --> 00:40:27,636
Oh, yes, Duncan.
He is.

376
00:40:30,932 --> 00:40:32,433
Unbeatable.

377
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:38,439
No.

378
00:40:49,826 --> 00:40:52,244
Sorry about that.

379
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,955
There must always
be two of your kind.

380
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:58,417
As long as there are two,
and you're kept from fighting,

381
00:40:58,543 --> 00:41:00,419
then the prize is safe.

382
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:03,172
The Sanctuary must not fail again.

383
00:41:03,298 --> 00:41:04,631
You're insane.

384
00:41:04,757 --> 00:41:07,134
Get yourself another volunteer.

385
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,263
We had a number of volunteers!

386
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:14,808
Sadly, that's no longer the case.

387
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:17,519
You'll be warehoused, hidden away.

388
00:41:17,645 --> 00:41:19,146
Go to hell.

389
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:21,440
Don't worry.

390
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:24,568
The drugs
will kick in momentarily.

391
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:04,733
Get up.

392
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,736
Get up!

393
00:42:14,744 --> 00:42:17,538
You have better things to do
than lie there on your ass.

394
00:42:18,748 --> 00:42:20,290
Who are you?

395
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:24,461
Someone who knows more about you
than you know about yourself.

396
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:26,463
Are you a demon?

397
00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:31,093
I've been called that
and worse.

398
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:34,763
I'm Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

399
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:36,598
Connor MacLeod?

400
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:41,937
And like you, my friend,
I have a hard time dying.

401
00:42:58,204 --> 00:42:59,246
Dawson?

402
00:43:00,623 --> 00:43:01,999
You look like shit.

403
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,208
Thanks.

404
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:04,876
How long have I...

405
00:43:05,003 --> 00:43:06,712
We'll talk about it later.
We gotta get outta here.

406
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:09,381
Come on, can you walk?

407
00:43:09,507 --> 00:43:10,799
Yeah.

408
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:31,737
Go. Go!
What are you doing here?

409
00:43:31,863 --> 00:43:33,322
Keeping tabs on you.

410
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:35,073
Yeah?

411
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:39,328
Well, someone should keep tabs
on that psychotic asshole back there.

412
00:43:39,454 --> 00:43:40,996
Didn't you get it back in London?

413
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:43,373
These guys don't play by the rules.

414
00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:45,167
You don't know what
you're up against, Mac.

415
00:43:45,293 --> 00:43:46,543
So people keep telling me.

416
00:43:46,669 --> 00:43:48,003
Stop the car.

417
00:43:48,129 --> 00:43:50,422
I managed to liberate
that from their lost and found.

418
00:43:51,257 --> 00:43:52,341
There's blood on it.

419
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:54,343
I didn't say it was easy.

420
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:57,304
- Pull over.
- What?

421
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,805
Pull over.

422
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:01,558
MacLeod, tell me something.

423
00:44:01,684 --> 00:44:02,684
Mac, hear him out!

424
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:05,270
Mac! Will you tell me something?

425
00:44:05,396 --> 00:44:07,981
Now, how many Quickenings
have you had?

426
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:11,902
How many heads have you taken?

427
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:14,529
I don't keep score.

428
00:44:14,656 --> 00:44:16,239
Well, we do.

429
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:25,999
'MacLeod, Connor. '

430
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,459
What's that?

431
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:29,169
The Watchers' version of a résumé.

432
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:32,714
'262 confirmed Immortal kills. '

433
00:44:33,591 --> 00:44:36,718
It's a bit like handicapping horses,
but it's part of the gig, all right?

434
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:38,845
'MacLeod, Duncan.

435
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:42,474
'174 confirmed Immortal kills.

436
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,560
'174 confirmed Immortal kills. '

437
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:47,354
Sound about right?

438
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,648
So, what's your point?

439
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:52,359
Here's the gentleman
you met in Connor's loft.

440
00:44:53,444 --> 00:44:59,700
'Kell, Jacob.
661 confirmed Immortal kills.

441
00:44:59,826 --> 00:45:03,620
'661 confirmed Immortal kills. '

442
00:45:03,746 --> 00:45:06,206
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

443
00:45:06,332 --> 00:45:08,542
Sanctuary wasn't shit, pal.

444
00:45:08,668 --> 00:45:11,253
This guy is way out of your league.

445
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:19,594
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.

446
00:45:19,721 --> 00:45:21,138
Why?

447
00:45:21,264 --> 00:45:23,807
Something doesn't make sense.

448
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:25,851
What are you saying?

449
00:45:25,977 --> 00:45:29,354
I think he's saying
he wants to see the body.

450
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,022
Well, it's gonna be a rough I.D.

451
00:45:31,149 --> 00:45:33,650
They're all missing their heads!

452
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:16,276
We gave 'em
a Christian burial, MacLeod.

453
00:46:16,402 --> 00:46:19,362
It was decent, you know.
Said all the right words.

454
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:21,948
Can't begin to tell you
how reassuring that is.

455
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:24,159
With all these
unexplained corpses,

456
00:46:24,285 --> 00:46:27,412
well, we had to take it
off the beaten track.

457
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:29,372
End of the road, Joe.

458
00:46:31,584 --> 00:46:32,584
Thanks.

459
00:46:34,629 --> 00:46:37,214
You watch your ass, MacLeod.

460
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,800
It's not my ass
I'm worried about.

461
00:46:43,262 --> 00:46:45,847
Did I happen to mention
about all this coming to a bad end?

462
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:49,851
No, Methos.
I don't believe you did.

463
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,150
You were gonna stay and dig.

464
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:59,903
Dig? Oh, yeah!

465
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:28,431
'I need to know
if he's still alive, Professor.

466
00:47:28,558 --> 00:47:31,601
'I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body. '

467
00:47:32,395 --> 00:47:36,314
'One of your kind
has gone renegade. '

468
00:47:41,279 --> 00:47:43,864
'People change, Duncan.

469
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,824
'You'll learn that. '

470
00:48:12,685 --> 00:48:13,852
No.

471
00:48:21,694 --> 00:48:23,236
What are you doing here?

472
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,407
You walked out
on your life, Connor.

473
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:28,575
Why?

474
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:33,330
I had my reasons.

475
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:35,040
Reasons?

476
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:40,629
Every life I touch ends...

477
00:48:41,672 --> 00:48:45,050
...brutally and for no reason.

478
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:49,179
It's a curse that's followed me
for centuries.

479
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:54,601
I can't outrun it,
and I can't outlive it.

480
00:48:56,687 --> 00:48:59,022
Rachel's death made you
the last soul on this planet

481
00:48:59,148 --> 00:49:00,482
that means a damn to me.

482
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:03,318
I thought there was a way out.

483
00:49:03,444 --> 00:49:04,486
The Sanctuary?

484
00:49:06,155 --> 00:49:07,280
Yes.

485
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:11,534
The Sanctuary.

486
00:49:12,745 --> 00:49:13,995
So, how did you escape?

487
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,290
I didn't escape.

488
00:49:19,335 --> 00:49:20,460
I was let go.

489
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,299
I couldn't see the slaughter...

490
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:28,385
...only heard it...

491
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:30,762
...and felt it.

492
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:04,879
Jacob Kell.

493
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:17,892
So, here we are.

494
00:50:18,436 --> 00:50:20,145
Both Immortal.

495
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:24,691
Missed the signs,
didn't we?

496
00:50:24,817 --> 00:50:28,361
But we were both
so new at the game.

497
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:32,782
Connor.

498
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:37,328
What a glorious sight.

499
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:41,499
Just look, Connor.

500
00:50:43,169 --> 00:50:46,671
Look back at the endless
travesties of your life,

501
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:50,967
and you'll see me, always there
waiting in the shadows.

502
00:50:51,677 --> 00:50:54,554
When friends and lovers
are wiped from your sight...

503
00:50:55,598 --> 00:50:56,681
...I'm there.

504
00:50:57,433 --> 00:51:01,603
When those you cherish
die abruptly and for no reason

505
00:51:01,729 --> 00:51:03,730
I'm there for you.

506
00:51:04,857 --> 00:51:08,902
And when your cellmates
in their so-called Sanctuary

507
00:51:09,028 --> 00:51:12,155
are left twitching
like headless chickens...

508
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:14,616
Guess who?

509
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:20,789
Connor.

510
00:51:20,915 --> 00:51:23,208
Stay out of it, Duncan.

511
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:31,341
Would you kill
an unarmed man again, Connor?

512
00:51:34,303 --> 00:51:36,429
You didn't know, Duncan?

513
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:40,350
Because you didn't tell him.

514
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:44,979
Would that finally put the agony
in your soul to rest?

515
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:47,816
Then go ahead.

516
00:51:47,942 --> 00:51:51,694
Send me home.

517
00:51:51,821 --> 00:51:53,279
What's stopping you?

518
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:55,406
Honour?

519
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:57,617
Guilt?

520
00:51:57,743 --> 00:52:01,412
The nagging sense that maybe you,
more than I, deserve to die?

521
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:04,582
Or somewhere along the way

522
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,627
did you just lose your nerve?

523
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:09,712
It's holy ground, Connor.

524
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:13,383
Yes.

525
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:16,261
Take your shot.

526
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,888
What better chance than now?

527
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:21,099
Do it.

528
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:25,311
Do it for your sweet mother.

529
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:31,317
Or the sweet little war orphan

530
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:34,404
Rachel Ellenstein...

531
00:52:38,409 --> 00:52:39,784
...who, if I'm not mistaken,

532
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,495
you raised
as your own daughter.

533
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:44,706
Tell me, do they even begin

534
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:47,167
to equal for the murder
of a man of God

535
00:52:47,293 --> 00:52:49,419
who raised me as his own son?

536
00:52:53,549 --> 00:52:54,924
Slow...

537
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:56,801
...close...

538
00:52:57,678 --> 00:52:59,846
Feels good, doesn't it?

539
00:53:00,598 --> 00:53:02,432
But look at you.

540
00:53:03,184 --> 00:53:06,186
Even now, you're afraid,

541
00:53:06,312 --> 00:53:08,062
afraid you'll lose.

542
00:53:08,189 --> 00:53:10,064
That's your true fear, isn't it?

543
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:12,734
The thought of giving up
your essence to me,

544
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,571
making me
even stronger by it.

545
00:53:18,449 --> 00:53:20,283
What's wrong?

546
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:23,912
Don't you want
to be inside me?

547
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:53,149
I want you to think back
to this moment, Connor!

548
00:53:59,531 --> 00:54:01,574
In the endless nights ahead!

549
00:54:16,298 --> 00:54:18,216
And know...

550
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:21,719
...that every time
you close your eyes

551
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:26,307
from now to eternity,
I'll be there!

552
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:31,521
Ripping apart the ones
you care about most!

553
00:54:41,699 --> 00:54:45,451
It's never over,
Connor MacLeod.

554
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:48,329
Living is what matters.

555
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:52,542
And you will live with this.
Count on it.

556
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:56,921
One far-off day, you and I
will be the only two remaining.

557
00:54:57,047 --> 00:54:58,881
You will look back on this

558
00:54:59,008 --> 00:55:02,677
and know you had
one chance to stop me.

559
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:03,970
You failed.

560
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:05,972
But until that day,

561
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:08,891
I will take my vengeance
on those you love.

562
00:55:10,436 --> 00:55:14,397
Your living has been my prize.

563
00:55:15,274 --> 00:55:16,774
For old times' sake.

564
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:20,528
'He is your son. '

565
00:55:23,115 --> 00:55:25,867
You, on the other hand...

566
00:55:30,164 --> 00:55:33,583
...are on borrowed time.

567
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:34,959
Call you.

568
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:42,258
Is what he said true?

569
00:55:46,138 --> 00:55:47,138
Is it?

570
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:52,477
Believe only what your heart
and conscience tell you.

571
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:57,273
Connor, with time,
anything can be forgiven.

572
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:59,233
You taught me that.

573
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,074
Did I?

574
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:37,021
Oh, look at Dave. Dave!

575
00:56:37,147 --> 00:56:38,564
Behave yourself, Duncan!

576
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:40,483
No more talking!

577
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:44,487
May all your hardships fade away.

578
00:56:44,613 --> 00:56:46,823
Till night becomes morn,

579
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:50,076
let love remain
to guide your way.

580
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:52,036
Till the day we are reborn.

581
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:55,164
Till the day we are reborn.

582
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:56,582
Kiss her, won't you?

583
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:06,592
Connor?

584
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:11,973
I thought you'd never get here.

585
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:13,599
Connor!

586
00:57:17,312 --> 00:57:20,356
You know
Kate is like us, Immortal.

587
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:22,817
Aye. I sensed something
the day we met,

588
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,360
but I wasn't sure.

589
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:26,320
Well, now you know.

590
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:32,910
And you know as well as I do
that her immortality

591
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:36,456
can only be triggered
by the shock of a violent death.

592
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:39,333
Yes, I do.

593
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,961
And without such a death,
she will simply grow old and die.

594
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:43,796
Yes, I know, Connor.

595
00:57:43,922 --> 00:57:46,299
Is that what you came
to tell me on my wedding day?

596
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:48,968
Come on.
Drink up, man.

597
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:51,846
No.

598
00:57:52,514 --> 00:57:53,764
I was wondering.

599
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:58,311
Does she know?

600
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:01,397
Why?

601
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:10,781
Many years
after I was married...

602
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:13,868
...one night...

603
00:58:15,162 --> 00:58:18,414
...I found Heather
in front of the house.

604
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,251
She had a knife in one hand
and her hair in the other.

605
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:25,963
When I asked her why she
had done such a thing to herself,

606
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:28,591
she said it was
the one part of her

607
00:58:28,717 --> 00:58:30,760
that would never age.

608
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:32,720
It would forever
remain the same

609
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:35,806
as when I first
fell in love with her.

610
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:39,727
That's how she wanted me
to remember her.

611
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:42,522
Why are you telling me this?

612
00:58:42,648 --> 00:58:46,859
Because I once loved a woman
more than life itself...

613
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:52,740
...and I watched her die.

614
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:57,537
Unlike me, you have a choice.

615
00:59:14,012 --> 00:59:16,264
What would you have me tell her?

616
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:19,767
I'd tell her nothing.
She wouldn't believe you anyway.

617
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:21,310
Then I can do nothing.

618
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:24,605
She's in the flower of her youth.

619
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:27,441
Enjoy the moment,
and let it pass.

620
00:59:27,568 --> 00:59:28,985
And if it were you in my place?

621
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:30,987
I was in your place!

622
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:35,616
But I thank God
I never had the choice.

623
00:59:35,742 --> 00:59:37,868
I love Kate,

624
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:40,997
and I will hold on to her
as long as I can.

625
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:43,124
And that is all I can do!

626
00:59:47,546 --> 00:59:50,131
'Forever, my love. '

627
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,301
'Until the day we are reborn. '

628
00:59:54,761 --> 00:59:56,345
'Until the day we are reborn. '

629
01:00:52,694 --> 01:00:55,863
- You haven't lost your touch.
- What do you want?

630
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:58,074
- To talk.
- Oh, that's a first.

631
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,992
I've tried to talk to you
a thousand times...

632
01:01:00,118 --> 01:01:01,452
Get to the point.

633
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:04,163
- I was wrong.
- Oh, no, no.

634
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:05,790
Stealing is wrong.

635
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:07,917
Lying is wrong.
Killing's wrong.

636
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:09,960
What you did
goes well beyond wrong.

637
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:13,089
Fine. I deserve that,

638
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:14,799
but I want a chance
to make it right.

639
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:16,801
You want to make it right?

640
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,804
Then give me back the ability
to have children,

641
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:22,181
to grow old
with the man I love.

642
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:24,558
How about anything that
resembles a normal life?

643
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:26,852
And you took it all
away from me.

644
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:28,729
Those things I can't give you.

645
01:01:28,855 --> 01:01:31,273
Oh, something else
you forgot to tell me.

646
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:33,734
Goodbye, Duncan.

647
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:38,531
Kell can't give you those things, either,
so tell me, Kate, why him?

648
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:43,661
Because I've never known anybody
with such a capacity for hate

649
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,121
except me.

650
01:01:45,247 --> 01:01:48,416
That's what's kept you
going all these years?

651
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:53,587
Fine.

652
01:01:55,257 --> 01:01:56,590
Go home, Faith.

653
01:01:58,385 --> 01:02:00,928
Take care of what's important.

654
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:26,096
You were with him.

655
01:03:28,517 --> 01:03:30,810
A woman is a temple

656
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:33,604
built on a sewer.

657
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:40,277
Remember what you were
when I first found you.

658
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,031
A whore.

659
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:47,785
Now, look at you.

660
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:50,913
A liberated whore.

661
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,373
Fuck you.

662
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:56,085
Oh, we'll get to that, blossom.

663
01:03:56,211 --> 01:04:01,924
But in the interim, be grateful
I don't take your pretty little face off.

664
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:05,761
Hurts, doesn't it...

665
01:04:07,138 --> 01:04:10,266
...that there is something
you actually can't have?

666
01:04:11,768 --> 01:04:17,022
I can have
anything I want.

667
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:20,609
Except me.

668
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:26,782
I've already had you.

669
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:33,539
Not really.

670
01:04:37,919 --> 01:04:39,920
Close enough.

671
01:06:58,101 --> 01:06:59,935
Forever.

672
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:37,890
May love remain
to guide our way

673
01:07:38,016 --> 01:07:39,767
till the day we are reborn.

674
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:47,024
Forgive me.

675
01:08:05,251 --> 01:08:06,502
I'm sorry.

676
01:08:08,338 --> 01:08:10,255
You had no right.

677
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:34,780
Kate?

678
01:08:34,906 --> 01:08:37,699
No. Don't be frightened.
You're Immortal, we both are.

679
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:44,081
I did it for you...

680
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:46,291
...for us.

681
01:08:46,417 --> 01:08:48,794
Kate.

682
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:52,798
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God! What have I done?

683
01:08:52,924 --> 01:08:54,424
Kate!

684
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:56,802
'You wanted this. '

685
01:08:56,928 --> 01:08:59,555
You forced it on me.

686
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:02,266
I never asked for eternity.

687
01:09:04,018 --> 01:09:06,895
'I never wanted us to be apart. '

688
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:13,735
- Would you have really understood?
- Which part?

689
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:17,281
The endless, numbing
sameness of it all?

690
01:09:17,407 --> 01:09:19,616
Or never bothering
to love someone

691
01:09:20,535 --> 01:09:24,329
because whole lifetimes tick by so fast
they don't even count any more?

692
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,500
Then why did you come?

693
01:09:30,044 --> 01:09:32,713
To see if I could feel again...

694
01:09:33,548 --> 01:09:35,215
...anything.

695
01:09:53,651 --> 01:09:55,652
You're missing the point, Kate.

696
01:09:55,778 --> 01:09:58,113
The difference
between Connor and I

697
01:09:58,239 --> 01:09:59,907
is that as long
as you're still alive,

698
01:10:00,033 --> 01:10:02,534
there's a chance that one day
I might be forgiven.

699
01:10:03,411 --> 01:10:04,620
It may take years...

700
01:10:05,955 --> 01:10:07,706
...centuries, even.

701
01:10:08,833 --> 01:10:10,792
But at least I can carry
that hope inside me.

702
01:10:11,794 --> 01:10:14,213
That's one blessing
of immortality...

703
01:10:16,257 --> 01:10:18,258
...there's always tomorrow.

704
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:21,136
Even for us.

705
01:10:39,697 --> 01:10:42,115
What are you doing, Jin?

706
01:10:43,076 --> 01:10:44,451
Just thinking.

707
01:10:46,037 --> 01:10:49,373
Men, for the most part,
can mend their ways

708
01:10:49,499 --> 01:10:52,209
only after they have made
a mistake.

709
01:10:54,128 --> 01:10:55,462
One day soon,

710
01:10:56,506 --> 01:11:01,843
we will all serve very little purpose
to Kell, except dead.

711
01:11:17,527 --> 01:11:18,902
A toast.

712
01:11:21,197 --> 01:11:23,198
I see tonight...

713
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:27,202
...as a celebration of the spirit.

714
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:30,497
To all of you

715
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:34,918
who continue to stand by me
even those who might waver

716
01:11:35,044 --> 01:11:36,878
at times...

717
01:11:38,172 --> 01:11:41,550
You are my flock.

718
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:43,885
You

719
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:46,513
nourish my soul.

720
01:11:50,226 --> 01:11:54,271
You are all a part
of a great journey,

721
01:11:54,772 --> 01:11:57,607
a 400-year quest...

722
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:01,153
...for justice.

723
01:12:03,156 --> 01:12:06,616
And here, my friends,

724
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:10,287
is the instrument of that justice.

725
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:15,500
The giver and taker
of creation...

726
01:12:18,171 --> 01:12:20,714
...baptised in blood.

727
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,347
It is the living
that matters after all.

728
01:12:33,269 --> 01:12:35,437
It sings like an angel.

729
01:12:36,898 --> 01:12:38,523
Just listen.

730
01:13:19,107 --> 01:13:21,108
Till the day we are reborn.

731
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:19,583
Kell.

732
01:14:21,043 --> 01:14:22,252
Jacob Kell.

733
01:14:31,095 --> 01:14:32,929
Connor?

734
01:14:44,942 --> 01:14:48,320
We've lived many lives,
you and I.

735
01:14:48,446 --> 01:14:53,825
We've seen things that most people
could never understand.

736
01:14:53,951 --> 01:14:56,703
But now what do you see?

737
01:14:56,829 --> 01:14:59,539
I see someone who would
never kill an unarmed man.

738
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:05,504
I also see someone
who has lost hope.

739
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:08,340
Life brings hope and pain...

740
01:15:10,718 --> 01:15:13,428
...but revenge
never brings redemption.

741
01:15:13,554 --> 01:15:16,556
The path and choice are ours.

742
01:15:23,648 --> 01:15:25,232
Connor, what the hell's going on?

743
01:15:26,067 --> 01:15:27,567
I have chosen mine.

744
01:15:28,861 --> 01:15:30,278
What are you doing?

745
01:15:30,404 --> 01:15:33,573
Kell's too strong,
and he's getting stronger.

746
01:15:33,699 --> 01:15:36,159
Neither one of us can beat him alone.

747
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,246
Are you out of your mind?

748
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:44,292
If we let him win,
it could mean the end.

749
01:15:50,174 --> 01:15:51,883
Connor, no!

750
01:15:54,428 --> 01:15:58,223
Kell is going to kill you, Duncan,
just to torment me,

751
01:15:58,349 --> 01:16:01,101
and there is nothing
you can do about it, nothing!

752
01:16:01,227 --> 01:16:03,061
I don't believe that, Connor.
Neither should you.

753
01:16:03,187 --> 01:16:05,855
Alone, neither one of us
can beat him.

754
01:16:05,982 --> 01:16:07,190
Together, we can.

755
01:16:07,316 --> 01:16:09,526
You know the rules.

756
01:16:09,652 --> 01:16:11,653
Only one Immortal
can challenge another.

757
01:16:12,655 --> 01:16:14,114
And only one will.

758
01:16:15,116 --> 01:16:16,199
This isn't the answer.

759
01:16:16,993 --> 01:16:18,201
Listen to me.

760
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:19,744
In the end,

761
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:24,165
there can be only one,
and that has to be you.

762
01:16:26,586 --> 01:16:28,086
No.

763
01:16:28,879 --> 01:16:30,130
We can beat him together.

764
01:16:30,256 --> 01:16:32,716
Then we are in agreement.

765
01:16:43,811 --> 01:16:45,812
Enough, Connor!

766
01:16:45,938 --> 01:16:50,025
I won't fight you.
I will never fight you, Connor.

767
01:16:50,526 --> 01:16:52,569
Then you die!

768
01:17:19,055 --> 01:17:21,514
No!
You're not doing this, Connor.

769
01:17:22,558 --> 01:17:24,934
Oh, yes, we're doing this.

770
01:17:25,061 --> 01:17:30,148
Every day, every breath we took
was for this end.

771
01:17:33,569 --> 01:17:36,905
Look inside
and tell me I'm wrong.

772
01:18:07,937 --> 01:18:09,938
Do it!

773
01:18:13,275 --> 01:18:15,276
I can't.

774
01:18:17,988 --> 01:18:20,156
Remember how
you first found me?

775
01:18:20,282 --> 01:18:24,619
Sitting in that bloody bog,
scared out of my mind?

776
01:18:24,745 --> 01:18:27,956
You taught me how to live, Connor.
You taught me why we live.

777
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:31,543
Have you forgotten all of that?

778
01:18:33,462 --> 01:18:34,963
No.

779
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:41,052
Our bonds are all
that hold us in this world.

780
01:18:43,097 --> 01:18:45,098
Don't break this one.

781
01:18:49,687 --> 01:18:53,606
Please, Connor.
I'm begging you.

782
01:18:57,361 --> 01:18:59,362
It's too late.

783
01:19:06,203 --> 01:19:08,663
This has to be done.

784
01:19:13,252 --> 01:19:14,627
No, Connor!
Not like this!

785
01:19:14,754 --> 01:19:16,129
Come on, stop!

786
01:19:16,255 --> 01:19:18,840
- Connor, stop!
- Duncan!

787
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:26,097
One of us has to die now,
old friend.

788
01:19:28,058 --> 01:19:29,559
No.

789
01:19:31,937 --> 01:19:33,730
And you know it.

790
01:19:35,816 --> 01:19:37,317
No.

791
01:19:40,613 --> 01:19:42,614
Goodbye, Duncan...

792
01:19:43,699 --> 01:19:45,867
...my true brother.

793
01:19:48,537 --> 01:19:50,789
I love you, Connor.

794
01:20:04,345 --> 01:20:05,845
No!

795
01:22:41,919 --> 01:22:43,419
Duncan.

796
01:22:44,213 --> 01:22:46,214
Well done.

797
01:22:50,219 --> 01:22:53,680
I ever thought
you had him in you.

798
01:22:55,683 --> 01:22:59,352
What does it feel like
to kill a brother?

799
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:03,856
Feels good,
doesn't it?

800
01:23:04,984 --> 01:23:07,360
You'll never know, will you?

801
01:23:09,738 --> 01:23:13,157
Now you'll never have
Connor MacLeod's head.

802
01:23:14,368 --> 01:23:17,286
Are you going to run?

803
01:23:17,413 --> 01:23:20,248
Are you going to hide?

804
01:23:22,835 --> 01:23:24,377
Run?

805
01:23:27,006 --> 01:23:29,215
Brother, come on!

806
01:24:07,546 --> 01:24:09,672
How bad do you want it,
Duncan?

807
01:24:12,676 --> 01:24:14,093
You'll pay!

808
01:25:12,402 --> 01:25:13,611
Duncan!

809
01:26:36,236 --> 01:26:39,906
OK, Kell. Come on.
Let's do this.

810
01:26:51,043 --> 01:26:52,585
Just watch.

811
01:27:16,443 --> 01:27:19,111
Merry Christmas.

812
01:27:40,717 --> 01:27:42,593
A valiant effort, Duncan.

813
01:27:43,595 --> 01:27:45,554
Too bad.

814
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:47,974
And this is just the beginning.

815
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:53,229
You see, when you absorbed
Connor's spirit, you inherited his curse.

816
01:27:53,355 --> 01:27:56,649
Revenge is so sweet.

817
01:27:56,775 --> 01:27:59,402
I wonder who we'll start with?

818
01:28:05,409 --> 01:28:06,951
Oh, Kate.

819
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,247
'Forever. '

820
01:28:12,874 --> 01:28:14,709
Oh, God.

821
01:28:16,044 --> 01:28:17,128
Kell!

822
01:28:19,089 --> 01:28:21,382
Jacob Kell!

823
01:28:23,677 --> 01:28:28,347
Revenge will never
bring you redemption,

824
01:28:28,473 --> 01:28:31,058
so I'm going to do it for you.

825
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:38,941
Is that all you've got?

826
01:28:47,993 --> 01:28:51,454
Duncan, I'd thought
I'd be home for dinner an hour ago,

827
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,497
but this is very impressive.

828
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:58,669
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

829
01:28:58,795 --> 01:29:00,546
I'd be delighted.
Yah!

830
01:29:13,018 --> 01:29:16,312
Impressive... isn't it?

831
01:29:18,065 --> 01:29:18,981
Duncan!

832
01:29:24,988 --> 01:29:27,656
You see at last your fate!

833
01:29:28,575 --> 01:29:31,702
Yes!
Because this game is done!

834
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:41,879
Well, look on the bright side.

835
01:29:42,005 --> 01:29:44,340
At least
you went down swinging.

836
01:29:44,466 --> 01:29:45,966
'Jacob Kell.

837
01:29:47,844 --> 01:29:50,596
'Time for redemption.

838
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:56,018
'The game isn't over yet.

839
01:29:57,104 --> 01:29:58,521
'What's the matter?

840
01:29:59,189 --> 01:30:01,607
'Don't you want to be inside me?

841
01:30:05,028 --> 01:30:06,112
'In the end... '

842
01:30:06,822 --> 01:30:08,948
...there can be only one.

843
01:30:20,085 --> 01:30:22,378
'And you're not it. '

844
01:30:24,297 --> 01:30:25,798
Call ya.

845
01:30:47,529 --> 01:30:49,530
No!

846
01:32:01,269 --> 01:32:04,605
Hope you found peace,
my friend.

847
01:33:39,743 --> 01:33:43,078
So, why are you here?
You hoping you'd find me?

848
01:33:46,458 --> 01:33:48,792
For whatever reason,
Kell made his choice.

849
01:33:53,298 --> 01:33:54,798
So...

850
01:33:55,675 --> 01:33:57,259
...what now?

851
01:34:00,347 --> 01:34:02,389
Trust.

852
01:34:02,515 --> 01:34:04,016
You can always trust me, Faith.

853
01:34:05,018 --> 01:34:06,852
Faith is dead.

854
01:34:07,812 --> 01:34:11,649
I thought we'd give
Kate another chance.

855
01:34:22,535 --> 01:34:24,495
Not yet.

856
01:34:24,621 --> 01:34:26,330
'Till the day we are reborn. '

857
01:34:26,456 --> 01:34:28,082
You hold onto it for me.

858
01:34:29,459 --> 01:34:30,918
We've got plenty of time.
