1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:08,240
Spring - 1649

2
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:28,864
So, even though you're a whore,
you refuse me?

3
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:34,070
If I don't like someone...
then I don't like him.

4
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:36,075
And I don't like you.

5
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:37,875
What?

6
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:40,974
You are persistent!...

7
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:43,946
I am a prostitute
because I like it.

8
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:46,849
But I won't sleep with someone
who disgusts me.

9
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:50,652
You rude bitch!

10
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:52,356
Are you going to kill me?

11
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:57,259
Well, then do your best.
I'd like to see it.

12
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:05,967
Don't get involved!

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,775
If she doesn't like you...
just leave.

14
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:14,272
Bastard!

15
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,287
We won't forget this!

16
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:27,554
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

17
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:31,059
Don't give up your life
so easily.

18
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:37,266
Excuse me... what is your name?

19
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:39,666
My name isn't important.

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,272
Maybe we'll meet again
under better times.

21
00:01:46,286 --> 00:01:49,676
My name is Kyara...
come visit anytime.

22
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:58,288
I hope I see him again.

23
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:14,371
FEMALE NINJAS MAGIC CHRONICLES 2
Kunoichi Ninpo-cho ll: Seishojo no Hiho

24
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,084
Religious Census Magistrate's Office

25
00:02:58,892 --> 00:02:59,881
Okay, next!

26
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:19,767
*Somon Bugyo: Baba Samemasa*

27
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:39,588
My Christ...
I can't step on him.

28
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:48,597
You are a secret Christian!
Take her to the prison!

29
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:50,761
Yes! Right away!

30
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:57,767
In the 17th century, the Shogunate
tried to wipe out Christianity.

31
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:00,976
Innocent people were persecuted
for their religious beliefs.

32
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:04,780
Many were forced to practice
their religion in secrecy.

33
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:17,593
I am innocent of any crime!
You are a monster!

34
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:21,701
I'll discover your deepest secrets.

35
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:35,578
You are wearing a bell.
I hear it inside your body.

36
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,875
I have no bell.

37
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:41,686
Yes, you do. The bell of Christ
is inside your body.

38
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:45,993
The bell is jingling because
I'm holding this cross near.

39
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:58,503
Matsudaira Izu-no-Kami's Mansion

40
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:06,001
Oh? So you found it, Chuo...

41
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:12,781
It wasn't just idle gossip,
nor a made-up story...

42
00:05:13,593 --> 00:05:15,083
Tenth year

43
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:19,887
Christian Lord, Otomo Sorin

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,389
and four other Christians
asked for help.

45
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:25,396
*Roju Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobutsuna*
The Vatican sent money.

46
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:26,497
* Roju Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobutsuna *

47
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:27,495
* Roju Matsudaira Izu-no-kami Nobutsuna *
They want to establish their religion in Japan,

48
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:31,898
They want to establish their religion in Japan,

49
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:40,408
so they sent a shipment of 100,000 gold coins.

50
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:47,710
100,000 coins?... That would be
over a million ryo!

51
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:53,564
The money was hidden
somewhere near Shinagawa,

52
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,488
and it will remain hidden until
the Christians are ready to act.

53
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:03,799
The key to its whereabouts
lies with this cross.

54
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:10,502
We found the first of the five bells
inside the girl.

55
00:06:10,617 --> 00:06:13,905
Once we get them all, we'll know
the location of the fortune.

56
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:28,324
Most likely, the bell is
hidden in the girl's vagina.

57
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:34,292
Now, I'll show you how to remove
it without touching her...

58
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:37,092
Look at this! Just as we heard!
There's a message on the bell.

59
00:07:38,605 --> 00:07:42,598
Saint and Salt water

60
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:58,814
What does this mean? The two
words don't mean anything.

61
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:02,517
No. Remember... there
are five bells altogether

62
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:07,521
Each of them are hidden inside
a Christian female...

63
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:16,094
Females who have pledged
obedience to Princess Maria Ten.

64
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:19,804
She holds the ultimate answer.

65
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,404
Princess Maria Ten.

66
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:26,809
She is the granddaughter of the
Christian Daimyo Otomo Sorin...

67
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,513
The princess is protected by
5 Catholic female ninjas.

68
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:38,821
It's frightening to comprehend...

69
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:43,223
A religion that would hide a
bell inside a girl's vagina!

70
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:44,725
But...

71
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:49,031
Regardless... I can't let
the money slip away.

72
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:54,136
Contact Amakusa Seiichiro.
I must see him immediately.

73
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,617
Oh! Christian slut...
you're awake.

74
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:12,616
Are you thirsty?
Do you want something?

75
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:43,614
I'm praying for salvation.
And I'm taking you with me.

76
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:51,828
Salvation? You mean 'death'?
I'm not going with you.

77
00:09:57,143 --> 00:10:00,715
I curse you with my magic...
The Cross!

78
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:17,018
What have you done?

79
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:25,327
The cross in your eye
will never go away!

80
00:10:33,846 --> 00:10:40,240
Princess Maria Ten!
Let her divine curse fill you!

81
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:43,911
Okyo!

82
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:59,629
Sisters! I'm going to my
salvation! Goodbye sisters!

83
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:15,646
Otomo Magic
The Cross

84
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:36,229
Okyo.

85
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,539
What are you doing here?

86
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:46,841
I'm not doing anything.

87
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:52,142
I saw you make the sign
of the cross. Are you Christian?

88
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:17,635
Young Noble, he's one of Otomo's
ninjas... Mikaeru Sukezo.

89
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:29,650
Seiichiro...

90
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:37,322
I want you to locate the Roman
treasure and claim it for us!

91
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:43,125
Yes, I'll accept with honor.
I'll do my best.

92
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:51,840
Mmmm. Very good. I'm happy.
You're the best and most trusted.

93
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:59,348
Your family will be rewarded
by the Shogunate.

94
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:00,951
Thank you, my lord.

95
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:08,356
For 60 years my family has known
poverty and unhappiness...

96
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:14,830
This is a grand opportunity
for my Amakusa Family.

97
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:22,233
Tell me your ideas... How will
you compromise the Christians?

98
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:25,440
I've collected the best ninja
army possible...

99
00:13:30,456 --> 00:13:32,344
I'm Mahiru Kyonen.

100
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,860
My name is Uguisu Donin.

101
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,739
Hata Manjimaru.

102
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:02,346
Soga Mokubei.

103
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:17,364
Thank you for coming...
Army of Seiichiro! Do a good job!

104
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:19,160
Yes!

105
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:25,267
Seiichiro... please demonstrate
some of your ninja magic.

106
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:26,767
Yes...

107
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:29,938
My lord... try to attack me.

108
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:32,144
Are you sure?
- Yes -

109
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:44,052
Strike me as hard as you can...
This is my Echo Trick.

110
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:56,664
What did you do?

111
00:14:57,076 --> 00:15:02,070
I'm sorry. This is a trick...
When you hit me...

112
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:04,572
Like an echo...
it returns to you.

113
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:11,581
This is very good magic.
Use it against the harlots.

114
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:13,449
It's a trick of my eyes...

115
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,852
As long as I can see...
I can use it.

116
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:21,956
Seiichiro... you are the perfect
Tokugawa warrior.

117
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:25,860
And now, like a good warrior,
it's time to fight!...

118
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:30,165
Do your best against
the bitches!

119
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:39,875
Religious Census Magistrate
Government Office

120
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:44,779
Thank you for accepting...
here is money from the Lord.

121
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,883
If you need anything more, just ask.

122
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:48,487
Thank you.

123
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:52,785
Prepare for a most ambitious job.
- I know that.

124
00:15:53,866 --> 00:16:01,159
The Princess and the 4 remaining
girls are related to Lord Otomo.

125
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:04,368
They are very dangerous.
Do not underestimate them.

126
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:07,967
I understand they're well protected in Edo...

127
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:13,674
But I plan a direct approach.
I'll challenge them rationally.

128
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:14,875
I see.

129
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,279
Excuse me.

130
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:24,286
My daughter...
This is Amakusa Seiichiro.

131
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:27,483
I'm Shino.
- Nice to meet you.

132
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,392
I've heard much about you.

133
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,190
You're the samurai from the
Amakusa famlly.

134
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:37,102
She's not impressed with the
power and plight of our country.

135
00:16:37,576 --> 00:16:39,771
She doesn't even respect
my political position.

136
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,068
Father...

137
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:42,670
Why do you feel that way?

138
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:45,073
His job is very important.

139
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:49,382
I don't like it.
Killing Christians is awful!...

140
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,174
They don't hurt anybody.

141
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:52,783
I apologize for her political views.

142
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:55,287
Excuse me, gentleman.

143
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:13,801
What is that?

144
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:51,004
Rufina.

145
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:52,706
Francesca.

146
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,508
Justa.

147
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:55,876
Savina.

148
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:04,480
Okyo is dead. But she killed the
man who stole her bell.

149
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,492
The Tokugawa family knows about
the bells and their secret.

150
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:19,001
Seiichiro the ninja has been
hired to find and kill you.

151
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:24,907
Sukezo... is Princess Maria Ten
in danger?

152
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:29,511
The Princess is safe for now.

153
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:33,212
But these are dangerous times
for Catholics.

154
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:37,318
Our treasure must remain
a secret.

155
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:41,186
I taught the ninja magic to you
for times like this.

156
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:48,199
You must be prepared to protect
the bells with your lives.

157
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:56,102
The others risked their lives to
protect their own bells.

158
00:18:57,716 --> 00:19:00,207
No waiting or loyalty is necessary in battle.

159
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,814
Trust in God. Everything
will work out.

160
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:07,514
Yes.

161
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:26,498
Guard this place.
And be careful.

162
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:29,308
Go with God.
Amen.

163
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,313
I want the bells...
I don't want to kill them.

164
00:19:39,024 --> 00:19:40,309
I can't allow that!

165
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:44,222
I'll protect them
with my life.

166
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,119
Do you value your life
so little? I'm ready!

167
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:44,812
Echo Magic! Now!

168
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,596
Otomo magic!
Blow darts!

169
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:09,806
Your eyes will never open!

170
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:17,312
You won't be able to use the
Echo Trick again... without eyes!

171
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:45,604
Can we stop?
- Yes.

172
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,029
Samurai!

173
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:16,838
You're burning up with fever!
Be strong! Strong!

174
00:22:57,623 --> 00:22:59,818
Samurai! You're awake!

175
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:02,916
Who are you?

176
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:05,324
I'm Kyara. The whore you
helped once before.

177
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:06,825
Kyara!

178
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:09,521
Yes. I work in the brothel.

179
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:12,024
You helped me once.

180
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,330
Don't try to get up.

181
00:23:18,343 --> 00:23:20,334
You can stay here until
you feel better.

182
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:24,238
But that's not a good idea...
it'd be bad for your business.

183
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,340
Don't worry. I can
do what I want...

184
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:33,512
But, tell me, what happened
to your eyes?...

185
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:40,526
There must be some reason...
perhaps because of this bell?

186
00:23:42,835 --> 00:23:46,532
Give the bell back to me!
Give it to me! Give it!

187
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,829
Here.

188
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:10,452
I wouldn't care if you decided
to stay here forever... forever!

189
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:21,129
Come everyone! Look at these
incredible eggs.

190
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,026
They aren't the usual farm-eggs
you've been eating.

191
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:26,532
These are the eggs from
giant frogs.

192
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:30,237
And their taste is...

193
00:24:30,349 --> 00:24:33,841
Get away! Move!

194
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:39,645
Merchant! Who gave you permission
to conduct business here?

195
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,849
Pay me your rent money
if you wish to continue!

196
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:49,357
Your tone doesn't match
your pretty face.

197
00:24:49,668 --> 00:24:51,363
Pay me the money,
forget the flattery.

198
00:24:51,436 --> 00:24:54,325
I'd like to pay you...
but I have no money.

199
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,331
Perhaps I could pay you with
some loving tonight?

200
00:24:57,442 --> 00:25:01,333
What the hell are you doing?
- Is that how you treat a lady?

201
00:25:10,856 --> 00:25:16,351
Stop the violence! Everyone has
to pay rent around here.

202
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:18,850
Mmmm? Who are you?

203
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:22,256
Me? I'm the one who has this...

204
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:23,857
What! But it's...

205
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,456
I took it from a samurai.

206
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:33,062
This is the rent money!

207
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:38,339
You!
... wait! wait!

208
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:55,759
Where are you, woman?
Come out!

209
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:11,944
I knew you would come for me.

210
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:18,840
Woman! It seems you know the
meaning of that bell...

211
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:22,650
You're a secret Christian!

212
00:26:24,763 --> 00:26:25,957
My name is Okai!

213
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:28,755
Rufina Okai!

214
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:53,684
This bell is mine! And now I'll
take another one from your body!

215
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:08,963
Cherry Blossom Trick!...

216
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:13,467
Your body will get very hot
soon.

217
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:52,771
Hotter! Even hotter!...

218
00:27:54,286 --> 00:27:55,776
Where is the bell?

219
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:05,151
Where?

220
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:23,670
I found it.

221
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:42,759
I have it!
I won!

222
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:51,470
You want more?
I understand.

223
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,276
Otomo magic!
Serpent tongue!

224
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,268
Otomo Magic - Serpent Tongue

225
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:53,291
Rufina Okai prays to meet God...
Amen.

226
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:15,782
Festival...
Treasure

227
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:28,262
Mahiru Kyonen died very quickly.

228
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:35,871
That's a strange name...
Who is he? Your partner? Friend?

229
00:30:39,584 --> 00:30:42,576
You never answer my questions.

230
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:45,980
Kyara...
- What?

231
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:49,385
I need to find all five bells.

232
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:52,581
Five of them? Why?

233
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:54,783
I can't tell you why, but...

234
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:57,796
I'll find the bells
even though I'm blind...

235
00:30:58,403 --> 00:31:02,191
I dedicate my life to the bells.

236
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:08,467
Very good! And I'll help you...
I've fallen in love with you...

237
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,769
Ask anything of me...

238
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:14,975
I'll keep them for you...
I'd never lose them.

239
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:17,277
Samurai...

240
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:20,780
That's fine.

241
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:23,383
Madam Kyara...?

242
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:24,784
What is it?

243
00:31:26,898 --> 00:31:30,095
There is someone here
to see you. Someone named Shino.

244
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:31,491
Shino?

245
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:33,293
Oh, it's a visitor for me.

246
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:38,394
You have a lady visiting you?
That's not good.

247
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:43,804
Thank you for coming.

248
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:46,502
Do your eyes hurt?

249
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,808
It's inconvenient...
but there's no pain.

250
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:56,488
You are Seiichiro the ninja!
How did this happen?

251
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:01,586
It is embarrassing, but...
I lost a challenge.

252
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:07,893
will you take a message to
the Lord, Shino?...

253
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:13,196
So far, I have two bells...
- Two bells?

254
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:16,708
You don't need to tell him
anything more.

255
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:23,906
Kyara... come out.
I know you're hiding over there.

256
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:28,515
So you discovered me?
Well, I'm just curious.

257
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:36,090
This is Kyara. She nursed me
back to health.

258
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:39,993
Oh, she's very beautiful!

259
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:44,799
My name's Shino. I came to visit
him on behalf of my father.

260
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,499
How nice of you!

261
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:53,610
Kyara, did you hear a daughter of
Huchira died at Tomyo-ji Temple?

262
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,409
I knew about that.

263
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:05,419
Let's go to Hakone right away

264
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,325
There's a natural spring...
the water would help your eyes.

265
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:10,923
Well, let's go!

266
00:33:13,805 --> 00:33:14,794
Kyara!

267
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:22,303
Hakone

268
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:34,915
It feels quite good.
I'm happy with you.

269
00:33:36,328 --> 00:33:38,319
I feel like I'm in a dream.

270
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:42,821
Because you're with me,
You should always be with me.

271
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:46,827
When I'm with you...
I forget all the bad things.

272
00:33:47,339 --> 00:33:51,332
You're lying. You never stop
thinking about the damn bells.

273
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:53,132
Well...

274
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:58,301
Don't worry. If you stay with me,
we'll find the bells.

275
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,110
Spring God...
make his eyes better.

276
00:34:10,628 --> 00:34:11,617
Hot!

277
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:15,824
It's not good to sneak up
on people.

278
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:21,529
Young Noble, I heard you had an
unfortunate accident.

279
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,527
What did he call you?

280
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:26,028
My eyes won't affect anything.

281
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:32,342
Good. I feel much better now.
Mokubei and Manjimaru are coming.

282
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:33,445
I see.

283
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:34,946
Who is this man?

284
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:40,245
I'm sorry. I didn't introduce
myself... Uguisu Donin.

285
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:45,018
Uguisu? Like the bird?

286
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:49,518
This is a special place...

287
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:53,529
It's especially refreshing to
see such a pretty nude lady...

288
00:34:54,339 --> 00:34:56,034
I must pray now...

289
00:34:56,441 --> 00:34:57,430
He's too strange!

290
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:00,134
Ouch! It's hot!

291
00:35:01,846 --> 00:35:07,239
I'm so surprised... Samurai,
you're from such a good family,

292
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:09,741
You're right. He is from a good
family...

293
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:11,845
Certainly above your level.

294
00:35:11,956 --> 00:35:12,945
Don't fight.

295
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:16,845
Fine! So what if I'm just
a whore?!

296
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:20,258
Stop, Kyara. 'Young Noble' is only a
name...

297
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:24,461
In truth, I don't have anything...
No house, no money...

298
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:25,658
Only this band of ninjas.

299
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:29,363
Oh? Is that right?

300
00:35:30,842 --> 00:35:34,039
And I have you, Kyara.

301
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:38,137
Sweetheart.

302
00:35:43,354 --> 00:35:44,548
I'll get some more sake.

303
00:35:51,362 --> 00:35:54,650
Young Noble, can you trust Kyara?

304
00:35:55,767 --> 00:35:56,756
What do you mean?

305
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:01,065
She could be one of the
secret Christians.

306
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:04,760
Mokubei, how dare you!

307
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:07,867
I just saying... sometimes it's
safer to think that way.

308
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:11,371
Be wary of anyone who wants to
get close to you.

309
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,146
There's no way she would've
helped me...

310
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:17,448
if she were a Christian.

311
00:36:19,157 --> 00:36:22,354
I guess she wouldn't have given
you the bells...

312
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:25,847
if she were a Christian.

313
00:36:26,464 --> 00:36:29,456
Kyara doesn't have a bell
in her body...

314
00:36:30,268 --> 00:36:32,964
And she's definitely not
a virgin!

315
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:39,666
When I think about Kyara the
darkness in my eyes gets bright...

316
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:41,062
but I haven't forgotten my training.

317
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:51,472
I'll recover the bells.
Somehow I'll get them.

318
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:56,250
And she'll continue to help me.

319
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:14,470
Goodnight, samurai.

320
00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:39,759
Come over here.

321
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:43,863
Samurai!

322
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:47,465
I want to be close to you
tonight.

323
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:55,378
Samurai! I'm so happy.
So happy!

324
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:13,082
Well, well. I'm surprised to find you up
so early in the morning.

325
00:39:13,264 --> 00:39:19,055
I'm a woman... with things to do...
do you play that lute?

326
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:23,468
Would you like to hear
'Bateren no Goeika'?

327
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:57,669
Please stop!
I hate that song!

328
00:39:58,576 --> 00:40:03,866
That's good... most Christians
I've met love that song.

329
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:09,076
Stop playing! I simply have a
headache... from lack of sleep.

330
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:12,979
Oh? You haven't been
sleeping well?

331
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:22,391
Young Noble, I have information
for you.

332
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:27,289
There's talk about a stranger
living on the outskirts of town.

333
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:30,101
The townspeople say
she's a hermit.

334
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:32,060
She doesn't want people to see
her face.

335
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:34,562
And she says weird prayers.

336
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:35,968
Prayers?

337
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:38,867
You don't think she's saying
Christian prayers?

338
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:41,274
Uguisu went to investigate.

339
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:46,783
We should go, too.
Mokubei, you carry this.

340
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:48,180
Yes, Young Noble.

341
00:41:12,884 --> 00:41:14,579
I'm sorry sweet Christ...

342
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:23,385
I'm wearing these clothes to
protect myself... and the bell.

343
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:07,291
Do you like this?
Eh, Christian girl?...

344
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:17,704
Your body is going to sing...
with my Lute Trick!

345
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:31,785
The string is made from an
enforced spider's web.

346
00:42:32,997 --> 00:42:34,487
You can't lift your hands
from it.

347
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,689
Now... I'm going to investigate.

348
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:41,294
No! Please stop!

349
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,981
I'm going to enter you!
Prepare!

350
00:43:21,612 --> 00:43:23,102
Give me the bell...

351
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:28,012
Give it to me!

352
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,092
River - Descent

353
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:54,800
I'll kill you!

354
00:44:06,524 --> 00:44:14,624
Otomo magic moon water bubble!

355
00:44:42,727 --> 00:44:48,222
Otomo Magic
Moon Water Bubble

356
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:09,313
Be strong!

357
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:16,116
I've been poisoned!
- Uguisu! Uguisu!

358
00:45:16,627 --> 00:45:22,418
Young Noble, good luck. I hope your
family regains its power.

359
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:26,493
Uguisu!
- Uguisu!

360
00:45:37,114 --> 00:45:44,111
Princess Maria Ten!
Francesca Oyu is coming

361
00:45:45,022 --> 00:45:49,311
coming to salvation.
Amen.

362
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:21,710
Young Noble, I'll find the next bell
with this...

363
00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:35,294
Be careful!

364
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:47,306
The cross is mine.

365
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:57,020
Mokubei... after her!
Do it now!

366
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:00,217
Umbrella Trick!

367
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:09,431
I'll go ahead.

368
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:28,812
Tell me! Are you Princess Maria?

369
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:31,310
You're my enemy!

370
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:56,604
I don't know if you're Otomo's
granddaughter... but you'll die!

371
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:24,531
Princess Maria Ten...
Justa Ofue is coming to see God.

372
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:46,223
Ofue... I'll take your bell.

373
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:02,535
Sink - Under

374
00:50:18,228 --> 00:50:21,322
Otomo magic
Dead Eyes Portrait.

375
00:50:50,327 --> 00:50:51,817
I thought you were alive.

376
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:41,534
Otomo Magic Dead Eyes Portrait

377
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:55,513
That was a great trick...
I saw the face of your attacker.

378
00:51:58,128 --> 00:52:02,417
Justa, die quietly now...
Salvation awaits.

379
00:52:16,346 --> 00:52:20,237
We have four bells, but we've
lost many brave fighters.

380
00:52:20,851 --> 00:52:22,842
You can't have weak emotions
over this.

381
00:52:24,121 --> 00:52:28,512
Remember your goal...
the plight of your family.

382
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:39,520
True. But after all this...
we still don't know the secret.

383
00:52:40,637 --> 00:52:44,425
Samurai, I think I know how
to read the eight symbols.

384
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,036
I think this is it...

385
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:54,635
Saint - Treasure...

386
00:52:55,552 --> 00:52:58,942
Salt water - Under - Sink

387
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:04,749
River - Descent - Festival

388
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:06,819
I don't know what that means.

389
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:11,328
The first part 'Saint Treasure
Under Salt water'

390
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:15,528
is about the Catholic treasure
probably under the ocean.

391
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,932
And the second part... traveling
down a river to the right spot.

392
00:53:20,444 --> 00:53:21,433
Does that make sense?

393
00:53:21,545 --> 00:53:26,437
Yes. That's very good. But
what about 'festival'?

394
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:33,642
Plus an ocean is unpredictable...
with the tides moving in and out.

395
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:36,349
The treasure must be moving
around.

396
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:42,059
Young Noble... we can't figure it out
from only 8 characters.

397
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:46,761
There must be another symbol
which gives the answer.

398
00:53:47,037 --> 00:53:53,533
The secret of time. The word
'festival' seems out of place.

399
00:53:55,145 --> 00:53:58,433
We need to find the 5th bell.

400
00:54:11,862 --> 00:54:17,858
I can't believe how easily they
accept their death...

401
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:24,158
They look so relaxed as they
go to their salvation.

402
00:54:27,644 --> 00:54:30,135
I wonder if I will die
with the same ease...

403
00:54:31,548 --> 00:54:34,335
I don't like it
when you talk of death.

404
00:54:37,254 --> 00:54:39,848
I don't plan to die soon, Kyara.

405
00:54:40,557 --> 00:54:44,550
Are you telling me the truth?
Promise me.

406
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:51,760
What will you do when you find
the treasure?

407
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:55,559
The treasure belongs to our
emperor.

408
00:54:56,073 --> 00:55:00,271
The Emperor? But you're risking
your life for it!

409
00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:05,073
The Amakusa Family will gain
respect again through my success.

410
00:55:07,351 --> 00:55:15,042
I forgot. You're from a good family.
You are important.

411
00:55:15,459 --> 00:55:16,847
You live in the clouds.

412
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,049
Kyara!

413
00:55:18,662 --> 00:55:21,756
I wanted to be with you,
but it's only a dream!

414
00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:23,560
I won't leave you.

415
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:26,758
Oh, will you marry me?

416
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:27,959
Yes.

417
00:55:28,772 --> 00:55:33,562
There's no way it could happen...
not in this world.

418
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:40,773
When my family regains strength...
I can do whatever I want.

419
00:55:45,288 --> 00:55:52,080
Samurai! Even if it's a lie...
I love hearing talk like that.

420
00:55:55,265 --> 00:55:56,254
I'm telling the truth.

421
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:03,161
Samurai!

422
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:27,352
What is it?

423
00:56:28,665 --> 00:56:30,053
The crickets stopped.

424
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:31,461
Do you think someone is there?

425
00:56:40,077 --> 00:56:41,066
I don't see anybody.

426
00:56:41,778 --> 00:56:43,166
Kyara, get the cross.

427
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:03,455
I don't hear anything.

428
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:09,061
Our enemy wants to steal
this cross and the 4 bells.

429
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:13,261
They will come after us
to get these things.

430
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:18,471
We won't have to look for
the fifth bell. It will come.

431
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:46,265
Edo

432
00:57:58,488 --> 00:57:59,682
The fifth bell?

433
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:07,286
Move! Out of the way!

434
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:15,692
Kyara! I accuse you of being
a secret Christian!

435
00:58:16,006 --> 00:58:19,100
That's absurd!
How could I be a Christian?

436
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:23,772
Shut up! This cross will tell us
everything we need to know!

437
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:24,969
Take her!

438
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:32,976
Let me go!
I'm not a Christian...

439
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:34,479
Help! Samurai!

440
00:58:36,693 --> 00:58:39,981
The cross which Kyara had
was the key to finding the bells.

441
00:58:40,597 --> 00:58:42,792
She can't be a Christian.
There's no way!

442
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:47,990
I'm sorry. She was accused
of being a Christian.

443
00:58:48,605 --> 00:58:50,095
We apologize.

444
00:58:51,107 --> 00:58:54,395
Who? Who made the accusation?
- I can't say.

445
00:58:55,312 --> 00:59:00,807
I did. I knew you would come
if she was arrested.

446
00:59:03,587 --> 00:59:04,576
Shino...

447
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:16,788
Shino!

448
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:20,593
You've been spying on us,
haven't you?

449
00:59:21,404 --> 00:59:23,099
I am a Christian.

450
00:59:23,306 --> 00:59:25,501
No! Shino! What are you saying?

451
00:59:26,209 --> 00:59:29,303
Father, I was hiding it from you.

452
00:59:29,813 --> 00:59:31,804
I've been a Christian
since I was a little girl.

453
00:59:32,716 --> 00:59:36,709
I've carried mother's beliefs
ever since she died.

454
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:38,209
This can't be!

455
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:44,010
Shino! Are you also the
Princess Maria Ten?

456
00:59:44,294 --> 00:59:45,283
Will you kill me?...

457
00:59:45,395 --> 00:59:51,288
If you kill me, my followers
have instructions to beat Kyara.

458
00:59:52,202 --> 00:59:53,191
Kyara!

459
00:59:53,904 --> 00:59:56,099
I have four bells in my hand.

460
00:59:57,107 --> 01:00:00,599
Before I can add the fifth bell...
I must kill your family.

461
01:00:02,212 --> 01:00:04,305
Father, what is your response?

462
01:00:04,915 --> 01:00:10,308
Will you destroy your only
daughter? Or kill Seiichiro?

463
01:00:14,925 --> 01:00:17,621
Guards! Somebody!

464
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:24,828
Seiichiro is a Christian!
Throw him in jail!

465
01:00:39,015 --> 01:00:40,004
Samurai!

466
01:00:44,521 --> 01:00:46,512
Samurai!
Kyara!

467
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:12,804
I've been looking for you.

468
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:16,703
You're the one who stole
the bell from Justa.

469
01:01:19,122 --> 01:01:21,511
So you are also a Christian?

470
01:01:32,335 --> 01:01:35,327
My ninja magic...
Silk Worm Finger!

471
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:38,735
Die!

472
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:46,302
Otomo magic...
Double shadow.

473
01:01:47,217 --> 01:01:49,503
The one you killed
was merely my reflection.

474
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:54,513
You little bitch!

475
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:03,722
Go to Hell, warrior!

476
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:12,825
I lost to a Christian!

477
01:02:18,114 --> 01:02:23,108
Justa... I killed him for you.

478
01:02:25,522 --> 01:02:27,911
What's going to happen to us?

479
01:02:29,526 --> 01:02:32,723
I'm going to be killed.
- I won't let them!

480
01:02:34,631 --> 01:02:36,622
I want to help you.
You must stay alive.

481
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:39,825
I feel guilty for involving
you in this!

482
01:02:41,337 --> 01:02:47,230
It's too late... I already
know the secret.

483
01:02:47,744 --> 01:02:49,234
They won't let me live.

484
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:56,838
I'm not afraid...
if I'm with you.

485
01:03:04,027 --> 01:03:06,120
Maybe it would be best
if we died together.

486
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:13,719
We know who has the fifth bell
but we can't do anything.

487
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:17,927
There's still something else
I want to do...

488
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:21,328
I want to meet
Princess Maria Ten.

489
01:03:29,352 --> 01:03:30,341
Come out...

490
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:46,854
Monika Okyo, Rufina Okai, Francesca Oyu, Justa Ofue.
God rest your souls.

491
01:03:58,948 --> 01:03:59,937
Kneel down.

492
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:07,346
Shino. You smell of death.
What have you done?

493
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:13,652
I killed your last ninja.
I killed him for Justa.

494
01:04:14,831 --> 01:04:16,116
You murdered Mokubei...

495
01:04:17,233 --> 01:04:18,928
I'll kill you too.

496
01:04:21,738 --> 01:04:23,228
And what about Kyara?

497
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:29,034
I must kill everyone associated
with the enemy.

498
01:04:29,846 --> 01:04:32,838
Is that the wish of
Princess Maria Ten?

499
01:04:37,153 --> 01:04:39,348
I don't know what Princess Ten
wants anymore.

500
01:04:41,157 --> 01:04:46,151
I don't know why she has allowed
all the bells to be discovered.

501
01:04:48,464 --> 01:04:53,254
It seems the Princess has
betrayed the Christians...

502
01:04:55,872 --> 01:04:57,863
I can't support that.

503
01:05:01,144 --> 01:05:06,832
I'd say the Princess has stopped
taking an interest in you.

504
01:05:12,455 --> 01:05:13,444
So be it!

505
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:35,367
Princess Maria Ten!

506
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:56,357
I, Savina Oshino, am coming to
my salvation! Amen.

507
01:06:04,274 --> 01:06:06,560
Kyara... can I ask a question?

508
01:06:08,778 --> 01:06:09,767
What is it?

509
01:06:10,246 --> 01:06:13,340
Shino tried to kill you
as her enemy.

510
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,945
It's like she was trying to
say something...

511
01:06:16,352 --> 01:06:19,344
Perhaps you are the
Princess Ten.

512
01:06:20,757 --> 01:06:23,248
That's impossible!
Don't you think?

513
01:06:25,962 --> 01:06:30,752
That's true. There's no way
you could be Princess Ten.

514
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:49,673
The fifth bell reads:
Virgin - Birth

515
01:06:52,955 --> 01:06:54,741
Do you know what it means?

516
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:14,767
Saint-Treasure-Salt Water-Under-Shinagawa
Virgin-Birth-Descent-Festival

517
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:21,270
'Virgin Birth Descent FestivaI'
That's the Christian's holiday.

518
01:07:21,584 --> 01:07:26,578
Christmas time.
The 25th of December.

519
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:31,977
Probably the treasure will be
there in the water.

520
01:07:33,062 --> 01:07:36,953
Samurai! You did it!

521
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:48,165
I see. Finally, Seiichiro solved
the secret of the bells.

522
01:07:49,178 --> 01:07:53,569
Now there's nothing to keep us
from getting the treasure.

523
01:07:54,684 --> 01:07:56,879
So... like you promised...

524
01:07:57,186 --> 01:07:59,177
will you reinstate the
Amakusa family?

525
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:04,886
Don't be a fool. We need the
fortune for the Tokugawa Shogunate...

526
01:08:05,294 --> 01:08:07,489
But I don't have any room for
the Amakusa Family.

527
01:08:07,897 --> 01:08:11,993
I'll kill them and
keep the money.

528
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:15,563
That's the true meaning
of Christmas.

529
01:08:16,572 --> 01:08:17,960
You are a powerful Lord.

530
01:08:28,284 --> 01:08:33,278
Shinagawa
December 25th

531
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:49,358
The Christians probably
calculated the weight of the box,

532
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:53,860
and the movement of the tide.
Everything is on schedule for today.

533
01:08:55,578 --> 01:08:59,366
We should wait for
the tide to go out.

534
01:09:09,392 --> 01:09:13,283
Today is the day.
If we find the treasure...

535
01:09:14,297 --> 01:09:16,288
my family's future will be secure.

536
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,888
Samurai, do you still want to
see Princess Ten?

537
01:09:23,206 --> 01:09:27,097
Yes. If possible... I'd like
to see her... at least once.

538
01:09:28,277 --> 01:09:29,266
I understand.

539
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:34,170
But the real person I want to
see is you, Kyara.

540
01:09:35,985 --> 01:09:38,078
That's all I want.

541
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:42,175
You want to see me more
than anyone else?

542
01:09:43,593 --> 01:09:44,582
Yes, only you.

543
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:51,790
Ninja echo trick.

544
01:09:58,307 --> 01:10:02,994
I understand... I can
open your eyes.

545
01:10:05,014 --> 01:10:06,003
Kyara.

546
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:44,705
Open your eyes.
Do it.

547
01:11:06,108 --> 01:11:08,804
I can see! I see you Kyara!

548
01:11:10,613 --> 01:11:14,709
Kyara! You are...

549
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:19,607
I am Princess Ten...
Maria Ten

550
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:22,079
Are you going to kill me?

551
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:33,886
I didn't know then... but now
I understand what Shino said.

552
01:11:36,305 --> 01:11:38,091
The reason she wanted to kill you...

553
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:45,399
I don't know why she has allowed
all the bells to be discovered.

554
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:52,106
It seems the Princess has
betrayed the Christians...

555
01:11:53,623 --> 01:11:55,409
What Shino said
was exactly correct.

556
01:11:56,325 --> 01:12:03,219
My plan changed.
The girls became insignificant.

557
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:10,496
My goal is now to recover the
money and use it as a barter.

558
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:16,604
I decided to use the Christians
to eliminate my enemies.

559
01:12:19,015 --> 01:12:24,112
No matter who died, I was still
ahead...

560
01:12:25,121 --> 01:12:28,613
And now the money will secure
my own reign.

561
01:12:29,525 --> 01:12:31,720
It was easy to use the religion
of these Christians...

562
01:12:32,128 --> 01:12:33,914
They are so gullible and eager.

563
01:12:36,232 --> 01:12:41,226
I have no intention
of letting you keep the money...

564
01:12:43,706 --> 01:12:48,200
Seiichiro... it won't be turned over to
the Tokugawa Shogunate.

565
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:49,800
Kyara!

566
01:12:51,013 --> 01:12:52,002
I am Princess Maria Ten.

567
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:53,904
What?

568
01:12:58,721 --> 01:13:02,714
Seiichiro, why don't you try
the Echo Trick?

569
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:10,122
Can't your open eyes secure me
as I just did to you?

570
01:13:13,536 --> 01:13:23,639
Kyara, I won't even try. I refuse
to use magic on my loved one.

571
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,609
Kyara!

572
01:13:44,433 --> 01:13:45,422
Samurai.

573
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:43,409
I'm going to give up my plan
for Amakusa family's recovery.

574
01:14:45,427 --> 01:14:47,418
I want to live with you.
Only you.

575
01:14:48,831 --> 01:14:51,823
You can't. It's impossible.

576
01:14:53,536 --> 01:14:58,530
Besides, I don't want to be
trapped in the weakness of woman.

577
01:15:00,743 --> 01:15:02,836
Do you understand?

578
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:06,036
Kyara!

579
01:15:07,249 --> 01:15:09,945
Thank you, Samurai.

580
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:16,212
I'm so in love with you.

581
01:15:18,227 --> 01:15:20,320
I wish I could be only one person.

582
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:23,823
As Kyara, I could love you,

583
01:15:26,535 --> 01:15:30,323
but I am Princess Maria Ten.

584
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:26,111
I have to go into the ocean...
and open the lock...

585
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:29,325
This cross is the key.
I must do it.

586
01:16:31,333 --> 01:16:33,426
Kyara! Don't go!

587
01:16:33,936 --> 01:16:37,929
No, Princess Maria Ten must do it.

588
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:40,333
Now is the time.

589
01:16:44,747 --> 01:16:49,741
If there is a God, protect me.
Amen.

590
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:02,849
Kyara! Stop!
Come back!...

591
01:17:03,933 --> 01:17:06,925
Kyara! Please stay with me!

592
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:27,447
Princess Ten... you are an
enemy I can't destroy.

593
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:35,353
Kyara. Thank you for the dream.
We'll be together in Heaven.

594
01:18:07,463 --> 01:18:10,557
My final magic...
The Echo Trick!

595
01:18:35,657 --> 01:18:38,854
The souls of Kyara and Seiichiro have
ascended to Heaven.

596
01:18:40,863 --> 01:18:45,857
Two souls, which were never meant to be
united in this life, can finally be together.

597
01:18:49,238 --> 01:18:53,527
No one knows the whereabouts
of the 1 million ryo in gold.
