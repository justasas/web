2
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,997
Oh, come on.

3
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,319
What now?

4
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,434
Leave it to me.
I can handle them all.

5
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,949
Push this down.

6
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,556
Bring it on. All at once.

7
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,708
What is it?

8
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,910
Didn't you feel something?

9
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,434
No one should be following us.

10
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,228
Chickened out, huh?

11
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,836
Woman's intuition?
Can't count on it.

12
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,950
We thought you were as good as a man,
but now you want us men to protect you?

13
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,469
Cut it out.

14
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,510
We're almost there.
Can you make it?

15
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,515
Ouch!

16
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,038
What the hell are you  doing?

17
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,591
-Jeez.
-Why are you hiding?

18
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,397
Waiting for you, of course.

19
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,594
Trying to attack me from
behind as I pass by?

20
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,799
Kill and take all the credit,
I heard this old man say.

21
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,511
Hey, don't say such a thing
in a nonchalant way.

22
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,678
Doesn't sound like a joke.
You're terrible!

23
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,520
You ran away leaving Yamata behind.
Who's terrible?

24
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,355
What? I gave Yamata a new
weapon I made, right?

25
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,389
You call this piece of shit a weapon?

26
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,754
You don't know
how long it took to make this.

27
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,198
How did you survive all these years,
making such stupid things?

28
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,598
I got more weapons, thank you.

29
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,952
I can handle them
without your stupid gadgets.

30
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,592
Don't flatter yourself.
Someone's gonna make you eat dirt.

31
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,672
Yeah?
I'm sure you're not the one.

32
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,231
I hope you guys fall out and kill each other.

33
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,720
Then I take all the credit.

34
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,193
Hey, go easy on me!
I'm not so young any more.

35
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,633
Hey, did you see?

36
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,392
The fire in the sky?

37
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,190
The work of Lord Oda or Koga ninja?

38
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,430
No, it didn't seem like it.

39
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,679
So what then?
Lightning? A dragon?

40
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,590
Tornado, maybe?

41
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,276
It went toward our village.
We'd better hurry.

42
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,395
Yeah.

43
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,592
Hey, hey! Wait up!

44
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,715
Wait!

45
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,476
Yamata, Jinnai, we're home.

46
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,592
Grit

47
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,234
Sincerity

48
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,951
Look who's here!
I knew it!

49
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,350
Welcome back.

50
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,432
Master is waiting for you.

51
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,715
Us?

52
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,270
What have you done now?

53
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,637
What's with you?

54
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,630
I'm talking to Yamata!
Get lost, you creep!

55
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,633
What do you mean by "done?"

56
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:29,590
You always pick unnecessary fights
and mess up your missions.

57
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,589
Come again?

58
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,711
Like last night, for example.

59
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,317
All you had to do was recon.
And what else did you do?

60
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,600
That's why he wants to see you.
Learn the first duty of ninja.

61
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,477
And what is that, huh?
To flee? Or sneak about?

62
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,791
Did you hear that?
He doesn't know.

63
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,598
How come?

64
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,592
Oh, I get it. He's not a born ninja.
He was an outsider.

65
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,759
Sorry, I should've known better.

66
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:17,398
Which means, you can't get the job
done properly! Come on boys.

67
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,993
No way!

68
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,235
No need to say that.

69
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,230
He doesn't kill for no reason.

70
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,713
We kill.

71
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,599
We risk our lives for the job.

72
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,517
Unlike you guys, who do
daily chores in the village.

73
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:47,509
Oh, give me a break.
But you know, you're kind of cute.

74
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,630
Oh well. Go to Master.
Get going now.

75
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,631
And out of my sight!

76
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,314
Let's go, boys! He's cute, eh?

77
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,395
Don't let it get to you.
He's just jealous of you.

78
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,518
Being the best ninja
can be a pain in the ass.

79
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,389
How did it go?

80
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,394
No soldiers at the castle.

81
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,394
They might have
already joined the Oda army.

82
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,955
So there were ninja guarding the castle?

83
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,077
Correct, sir. But they were no good at all.

84
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,073
Yamata here took all of them  down.

85
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,314
You just watched, Nezumi?

86
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,269
No, no, no, I just fled,
leaving Yamata behind.

87
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,153
That's the smartest way to stay alive, huh?

88
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,709
Yes, sir...

89
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,879
I just gave the young ones all the credit.

90
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,671
Then, I should assign you
a mission you can handle.

91
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,599
A mysterious ball of fire fell near the village.

92
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,394
We saw that on our way back.

93
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,791
All the other ninja are out now.

94
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,599
I know you three just came back
and you must be tired, but...

95
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,198
Go and search the area with the
group who came back last night.

96
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,158
You think it was a tool of Oda's army?

97
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,434
I'm not sure.
When you find out...

98
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,239
Get back to me immediateIy.

99
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,828
Now go.

100
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,829
Yes sir.

101
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,068
So the others are gathering
information on warlords, huh?

102
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,439
The fate of us Iga ninja depends on
the warlord we side with.

103
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,158
Guys! Wait! Wait up!

104
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,472
We just need to side with

105
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,037
the one who ensures our survival, eh?

106
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,072
Oda or Tokugawa, doesn't matter.

107
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,389
Got big ears, huh?

108
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,279
Of course! I'm a ninja, too!

109
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,830
I can hear you guys from a distance.

110
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,028
Doesn't matter?
Sure, you're good at kissing ass.

111
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,435
We ninja work in the shadows.
That's who we are.

112
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,075
You always step out of the shadows.
You'll get yourseIf killed.

113
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,636
I hate staying in the shadows.

114
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,676
I' d prefer to take down big shots
rather than their men.

115
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,069
I've got the right thing for you.

116
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,070
The custom-made auto-ninja exterminator!

117
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,113
Oh, that piece of shit.

118
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,590
No way, this has been modified.
It will work just fine.

119
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,830
It's fine. I guess.

120
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,037
Oh, and then... Presto!

121
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,350
Cool stuff, huh?

122
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,838
A dagger?

123
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,439
Take a close look.

124
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,714
You gotta give up old weapons and
get cool stuff from foreigners.

125
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,788
Well, this is mine though.

126
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,837
Let me try.

127
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,195
Hey!

128
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,635
Hey, give it back!

129
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,836
Come on.

130
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,956
Okay, you win.

131
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,959
How about this?
Pretty powerful.

132
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,351
No thanks. I've aIways wanted to fire a gun.

133
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,990
Give it back to me!
I'm serious!

134
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,875
Watch it! Yamata, no!
Give it back! Give me!

135
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:12,036
Told you! Stop playing around!
I ain't got much ammo.

136
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,518
Hey, no, it wasn't me.
I didn't do this. No.

137
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,834
No, I didn't do...
Sorry!

138
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,309
I was having a good time!

139
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,713
It hurts.

140
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,436
It's your fauIt.

141
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,630
Shit, blood.

142
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,033
Still alive, huh?

143
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,354
You too.

144
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,036
Did you see the fire?

145
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,714
Yeah, on our way back.

146
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,632
Where did it go?

147
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,468
Over there.
About 20 km from here.

148
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,558
Wait a minute. You guys go first.

149
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,551
Don't be a nuisance.

150
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,317
Why? We returned after they did.
It's only natural.

151
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,993
Sure, I'll guide you.
Follow me, old man.

152
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,630
A young girl will guide us!
Living long isn't so bad.

153
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,076
Told you.

154
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,198
How was the mission?

155
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,793
Boring.

156
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,315
Did what you do best?

157
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,197
How was yours?

158
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,675
I could use a challenge.

159
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,559
Want it right here, right now?

160
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,709
Actually, I want it in bed.

161
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,279
What is it?

162
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,192
Bear or something.

163
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,430
No bears around here.

164
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,233
What then?

165
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,712
Our enemies wouldn't leave a mark like this.

166
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,999
Who are you?

167
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,392
Why don't you answer?

168
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,550
Talk or I'll kill you.

169
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,438
Stop, Yamata.

170
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,229
Look at him. He's so shook up.

171
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,516
Don't scare him.

172
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,758
Hungry?

173
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,075
Food!

174
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,431
Yes, ma'am.

175
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,553
Eat.

176
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,553
What happened?
Are you alone?

177
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,476
Where are you from?

178
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,031
You all right?
Come on!

179
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,233
Assemble!

<font color=Red><b>Aldi Arman</font></b>

181
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,555
Rin!

182
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,830
Get a grip! Run!

183
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,199
Yamata!
Let's get out of here!

184
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,509
I'm staying!

185
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,551
Forget it! It's too fast!

186
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,874
Go! Now!

187
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,995
You'll die!

188
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,874
That thing killed our brothers!

189
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,394
Yamata!

190
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,514
Come with us!

191
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,589
Yamata!

192
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,994
Damn!

193
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,915
What was that?

194
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,189
Anybody see anything?

195
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,953
Just part of it.

196
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,997
And the others?

197
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,638
So, that thing came to
our village last night...

198
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:48,629
Is it a dog or wolf sent by the Oda army?

199
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,592
Or a bear after all?

200
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,599
Too big for a dog or wolf.
Too fast for a bear.

201
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,993
Then what? Demon? Monster?
We got a monster in our village?

202
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,389
I've been many places over the years, but...

203
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,154
I've never heard of such a monster!

204
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,598
It could come from a foreign
land along with firearms.

205
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,069
Do we have to deal with it,
whatever it may be?

206
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,595
I've survived many years...

207
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,719
...only to be killed by a monster?

208
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,195
No way! No!

209
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,753
Now what?

210
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,315
-Yamata!
-What?

211
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,594
You...

212
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,590
You brought that thing!

213
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,634
What? Say it louder!

214
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,836
Kill that thing!

215
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,512
That killed everyone in my village.

216
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,274
Your village?

217
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,597
So you fled?

218
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,911
What does it want?

219
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,839
It's a monster, all right?
It just wants to kill us all.

220
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,194
Sure.

221
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:55,833
I've never fled from enemies
who killed our brothers, right?

222
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,558
Right?

223
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,240
But not this time.

224
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,479
But whatever that thing may be,
we are ninja.

225
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,754
You may be too young, but you
can't flee from the monster

226
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,832
without getting revenge, right?

227
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,875
Yes.

228
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,911
Keep watch.

229
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,718
Ouch! Oh shit! It hurts!

230
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,877
Why do I have to do this?

231
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,990
Scared me.

232
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,952
Serves you right!

233
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,075
Nezumi, get down!

234
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,433
It can't be!

235
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,831
That's exciting.

236
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,155
I don't think so!

237
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,148
No! There it is!

238
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,078
Sorry I took so long.

239
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,919
You bastard!

240
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,838
The Strongest

241
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,837
Go ahead, pick them up.

242
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,759
You all right?

243
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,795
Yeah.

244
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,473
You okay?

245
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,236
Yeah. No broken bones.

246
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,994
What happened to Jinnai?

247
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,551
Dead.

248
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,918
He must be.
He was taken by the monster.

249
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,512
Devoured already.

250
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,999
What were you doing when
Jinnai and Rin were attacked?

251
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,878
Taking a nap?

252
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,677
I was sent flying through the air.
You saw it.

253
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,999
You didn't get a scratch.
How could you give up so fast?

254
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,720
It hurts! I'm sorry!
At any rate...

255
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,958
...let's get back to the village.
We must report to Master.

256
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,872
Hey! I have an idea!

257
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,750
That's the last one.
Let's capture it.

258
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,754
Huh?

259
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,916
Release it in the Oda territory.

260
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,118
Let it destroy the Oda army and Koga ninja.

261
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,913
We can receive rewards from Grand Master.

262
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,559
Nonsense.

263
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,993
Or, we could lure it into
other villages of Iga ninja...

264
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,716
...and have it kill all the others.

265
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,589
That way, we can rule the whole
Iga clan! What do you think?

266
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,558
Enough!

267
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:33,956
What we must do now is save Jinnai, right?

268
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,552
Why? Are you nuts?
What do we get then?

269
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,754
You're gonna fight that
slimy monster for no reward?

270
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,595
He saved me when he was attacked.

271
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,116
And you saved him, too.

272
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,759
You saw it?

273
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,037
No, that boy told me so.

274
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,758
No I didn't!

275
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,754
Don't make a fool of me.

276
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,473
Where have you been?
It's dangerous.

277
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,193
I found a trail of blood.
That monster must be bleeding.

278
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,036
Let's go save him.
We can track down the monster!

279
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,237
I was so afraid.
But watching you guys fight...

280
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,273
I wanna do my part.

281
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,879
I wanna avenge my mother
and my people! Please!

282
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,994
Don't take him seriousIy, Yamata.
He's just a kid.

283
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,312
He's gonna get you killed for sure.

284
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,358
Yeah, I know.

285
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,756
What? I'm not going there.
I'm going back.

286
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:12,959
Yeah, tell Master about it.

287
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,593
Somebody has to do it.
It's important.

288
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,111
Oh, yeah.

289
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,832
You're right.

290
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,071
I guess I'll have to go.
I'm a senior.

291
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,998
You bet I will.

292
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,469
Better now than later.

293
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,871
I'll go now.

294
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,111
See ya!

295
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,948
Are you sure?

296
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,908
We should warn the village.

297
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,879
That thing could go there.

298
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,838
Now, show us the trail.

299
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,194
Let's go save Jinnai.

300
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,795
Why did the monsters take them away alive?

301
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,393
Fresh meat, I guess.

302
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,515
Yamata!

303
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,635
What?

304
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,518
He doesn't have to know.

305
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,834
Why not? Nishi will join us
as ninja someday like his father.

306
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:14,435
I want Jinnai alive, too. But
ninja are inseparable from death.

307
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,993
We're living on the edge.

308
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,995
If you don't like that,
be a farmer or something.

309
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:30,512
You volunteered.
You should know that.

310
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,918
Why did you become a ninja, Rin?

311
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:43,275
I have no brothers. So I did my
father a favor and became one.

312
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,033
No choice?

313
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,278
No, no.

314
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,276
I just didn't like the fact
that my dad wanted me to be a man.

315
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:04,871
My old man was a peasant.
Killed in a war with my mother.

316
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,031
I was adopted.

317
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,919
We have to fight to live.

318
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,515
But I won't give up on him.

319
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,998
I  don't expect to live long.
I'll just fight with my brothers.

320
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,914
Right?

321
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,515
Look.

322
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,109
They're not from Iga.
Must be Koga ninja.

323
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,475
They were scouting?

324
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,392
Out for that fire?

325
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,350
Killed by the monster, huh?

326
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,111
Where are the bodies?

327
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,398
I'm home.

328
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,433
Oh shit.

329
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,279
Monster...

330
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,435
Uh-oh.

331
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,508
Look!

332
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,759
What the hell?

333
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,513
Nezumi?

334
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,393
Yamata! Help! Help me!

335
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,755
What's wrong?

336
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,552
Everyone is...

337
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:32,915
What?

338
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,198
Dead! All of them!

339
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,079
What?

340
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,759
Where is it?

341
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,992
Let's get out of here!
It'll kill us all!

342
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,312
It's not here.

343
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,591
Where's Jinnai?

344
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,232
Is that Jinnai?

345
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,710
It's the monster thing.

346
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,233
Huh?

347
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,432
Kid, I'll teach you how to fight.
But for now, stay back.

348
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,471
Don't come out.

349
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,871
Come on! Wake up!

350
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,399
What's going on?

351
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,516
We'll have to kill them.

352
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,749
Jinnai, too?

353
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,309
Yeah, I know that!

354
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,830
Shut the fuck up.

355
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,511
Their throat!

356
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:45,558
Jinnai! Come on! Wake up!

357
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,673
You all right?

358
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,637
Ya... Yamata...

359
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,229
Yamata!

360
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,918
See to Jinnai.

361
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,874
Smart bastard, aren't you?

362
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,520
Death

363
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:49,471
Revenge is ours.

364
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,595
You okay?

365
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,033
Feel funny.

366
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,917
What did you do to me?

367
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:25,556
I hate reaching into your throat.

368
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:43,835
Hey.

369
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:01,398
Okay, let's go.

370
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,113
Nishi! Hurry up!

371
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,558
What are you doing?
Let's go.

372
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,719
Nishi!

373
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,159
Coming!

374
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:07,160
