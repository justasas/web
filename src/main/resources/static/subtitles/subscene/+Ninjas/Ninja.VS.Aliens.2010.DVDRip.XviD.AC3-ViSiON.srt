1
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,797
Oh, come on.

2
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,119
What now?

3
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,235
Leave it to me.
I can handle them all.

4
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,750
Push this down.

5
00:02:58,402 --> 00:03:00,359
Bring it on. All at once.

6
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,518
What is it?

7
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,720
Didn't you feel something?

8
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,244
No one should be following us.

9
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,038
Chickened out, huh?

10
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,646
Woman's intuition?
Can't count on it.

11
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,761
We thought you were as good as a man,
but now you want us men to protect you?

12
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:02,280
Cut it out.

13
00:06:05,011 --> 00:06:08,321
We're almost there.
Can you make it?

14
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:19,329
Ouch!

15
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:24,853
What the hell are you  doing?

16
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:28,406
-Jeez.
-Why are you hiding?

17
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:32,212
Waiting for you, of course.

18
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:36,409
Trying to attack me from
behind as I pass by?

19
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:40,614
Kill and take all the credit,
I heard this old man say.

20
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:45,326
Hey, don't say such a thing
in a nonchalant way.

21
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:51,494
Doesn't sound like a joke.
You're terrible!

22
00:07:56,216 --> 00:08:01,336
You ran away leaving Yamata behind.
Who's terrible?

23
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:05,171
What? I gave Yamata a new
weapon I made, right?

24
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:09,206
You call this piece of shit a weapon?

25
00:08:09,817 --> 00:08:13,571
You don't know
how long it took to make this.

26
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:18,015
How did you survive all these years,
making such stupid things?

27
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:23,415
I got more weapons, thank you.

28
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:27,769
I can handle them
without your stupid gadgets.

29
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,410
Don't flatter yourself.
Someone's gonna make you eat dirt.

30
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:36,490
Yeah?
I'm sure you're not the one.

31
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:49,049
I hope you guys fall out and kill each other.

32
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:53,538
Then I take all the credit.

33
00:08:56,099 --> 00:09:00,012
Hey, go easy on me!
I'm not so young any more.

34
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:02,452
Hey, did you see?

35
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,211
The fire in the sky?

36
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:07,009
The work of Lord Oda or Koga ninja?

37
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,249
No, it didn't seem like it.

38
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:13,498
So what then?
Lightning? A dragon?

39
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,410
Tornado, maybe?

40
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,096
It went toward our village.
We'd better hurry.

41
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,215
Yeah.

42
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,412
Hey, hey! Wait up!

43
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,535
Wait!

44
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:46,297
Yamata, Jinnai, we're home.

45
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:56,413
Grit

46
00:09:57,461 --> 00:10:00,055
Sincerity

47
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:03,773
Look who's here!
I knew it!

48
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:06,172
Welcome back.

49
00:10:06,342 --> 00:10:09,254
Master is waiting for you.

50
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:10,537
Us?

51
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:14,092
What have you done now?

52
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:16,459
What's with you?

53
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:20,452
I'm talking to Yamata!
Get lost, you creep!

54
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:23,456
What do you mean by "done?"

55
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,413
You always pick unnecessary fights
and mess up your missions.

56
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:33,412
Come again?

57
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:38,534
Like last night, for example.

58
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:43,140
All you had to do was recon.
And what else did you do?

59
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:48,424
That's why he wants to see you.
Learn the first duty of ninja.

60
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:54,301
And what is that, huh?
To flee? Or sneak about?

61
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:58,615
Did you hear that?
He doesn't know.

62
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,422
How come?

63
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:07,417
Oh, I get it. He's not a born ninja.
He was an outsider.

64
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:11,584
Sorry, I should've known better.

65
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:18,223
Which means, you can't get the job
done properly! Come on boys.

66
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:19,818
No way!

67
00:11:23,705 --> 00:11:26,060
No need to say that.

68
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:29,056
He doesn't kill for no reason.

69
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,539
We kill.

70
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:34,425
We risk our lives for the job.

71
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:40,343
Unlike you guys, who do
daily chores in the village.

72
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:48,335
Oh, give me a break.
But you know, you're kind of cute.

73
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:54,457
Oh well. Go to Master.
Get going now.

74
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:56,458
And out of my sight!

75
00:11:56,627 --> 00:11:59,141
Let's go, boys! He's cute, eh?

76
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:08,222
Don't let it get to you.
He's just jealous of you.

77
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:16,346
Being the best ninja
can be a pain in the ass.

78
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,219
How did it go?

79
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,224
No soldiers at the castle.

80
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:19,224
They might have
already joined the Oda army.

81
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,786
So there were ninja guarding the castle?

82
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:26,908
Correct, sir. But they were no good at all.

83
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:29,904
Yamata here took all of them  down.

84
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,145
You just watched, Nezumi?

85
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:37,100
No, no, no, I just fled,
leaving Yamata behind.

86
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:43,985
That's the smartest way to stay alive, huh?

87
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:46,541
Yes, sir...

88
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:50,711
I just gave the young ones all the credit.

89
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:56,503
Then, I should assign you
a mission you can handle.

90
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:03,431
A mysterious ball of fire fell near the village.

91
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:06,227
We saw that on our way back.

92
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:09,624
All the other ninja are out now.

93
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:16,432
I know you three just came back
and you must be tired, but...

94
00:14:16,593 --> 00:14:22,031
Go and search the area with the
group who came back last night.

95
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,991
You think it was a tool of Oda's army?

96
00:14:26,514 --> 00:14:30,268
I'm not sure.
When you find out...

97
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:35,073
Get back to me immediateIy.

98
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:37,662
Now go.

99
00:14:38,514 --> 00:14:39,663
Yes sir.

100
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:45,902
So the others are gathering
information on warlords, huh?

101
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:51,274
The fate of us Iga ninja depends on
the warlord we side with.

102
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:54,993
Guys! Wait! Wait up!

103
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:02,307
We just need to side with

104
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:05,872
the one who ensures our survival, eh?

105
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:08,907
Oda or Tokugawa, doesn't matter.

106
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,224
Got big ears, huh?

107
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:13,115
Of course! I'm a ninja, too!

108
00:15:13,276 --> 00:15:16,666
I can hear you guys from a distance.

109
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:21,864
Doesn't matter?
Sure, you're good at kissing ass.

110
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:28,271
We ninja work in the shadows.
That's who we are.

111
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:34,912
You always step out of the shadows.
You'll get yourseIf killed.

112
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:39,473
I hate staying in the shadows.

113
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:44,513
I' d prefer to take down big shots
rather than their men.

114
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:49,906
I've got the right thing for you.

115
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:56,908
The custom-made auto-ninja exterminator!

116
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:01,951
Oh, that piece of shit.

117
00:16:02,798 --> 00:16:07,428
No way, this has been modified.
It will work just fine.

118
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:09,668
It's fine. I guess.

119
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:12,875
Oh, and then... Presto!

120
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,188
Cool stuff, huh?

121
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:18,677
A dagger?

122
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,278
Take a close look.

123
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:30,553
You gotta give up old weapons and
get cool stuff from foreigners.

124
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,627
Well, this is mine though.

125
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,676
Let me try.

126
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:37,034
Hey!

127
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,474
Hey, give it back!

128
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,676
Come on.

129
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,796
Okay, you win.

130
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,799
How about this?
Pretty powerful.

131
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,191
No thanks. I've aIways wanted to fire a gun.

132
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,830
Give it back to me!
I'm serious!

133
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,715
Watch it! Yamata, no!
Give it back! Give me!

134
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:12,877
Told you! Stop playing around!
I ain't got much ammo.

135
00:17:21,161 --> 00:17:25,360
Hey, no, it wasn't me.
I didn't do this. No.

136
00:17:32,162 --> 00:17:34,676
No, I didn't do...
Sorry!

137
00:17:34,842 --> 00:17:37,151
I was having a good time!

138
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:40,555
It hurts.

139
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:46,279
It's your fauIt.

140
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,473
Shit, blood.

141
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:16,877
Still alive, huh?

142
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:18,198
You too.

143
00:18:24,844 --> 00:18:26,880
Did you see the fire?

144
00:18:27,044 --> 00:18:29,558
Yeah, on our way back.

145
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:31,477
Where did it go?

146
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:36,313
Over there.
About 20 km from here.

147
00:18:36,525 --> 00:18:39,403
Wait a minute. You guys go first.

148
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:41,396
Don't be a nuisance.

149
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:47,162
Why? We returned after they did.
It's only natural.

150
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:51,838
Sure, I'll guide you.
Follow me, old man.

151
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:59,476
A young girl will guide us!
Living long isn't so bad.

152
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:20,923
Told you.

153
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:13,047
How was the mission?

154
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,642
Boring.

155
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:17,164
Did what you do best?

156
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:21,046
How was yours?

157
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:23,525
I could use a challenge.

158
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,409
Want it right here, right now?

159
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,559
Actually, I want it in bed.

160
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,130
What is it?

161
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,043
Bear or something.

162
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:53,281
No bears around here.

163
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:55,084
What then?

164
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:59,563
Our enemies wouldn't leave a mark like this.

165
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:30,852
Who are you?

166
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:34,245
Why don't you answer?

167
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,403
Talk or I'll kill you.

168
00:21:38,653 --> 00:21:40,291
Stop, Yamata.

169
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:45,082
Look at him. He's so shook up.

170
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:47,369
Don't scare him.

171
00:21:53,894 --> 00:21:55,612
Hungry?

172
00:21:58,974 --> 00:21:59,929
Food!

173
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:02,285
Yes, ma'am.

174
00:22:11,054 --> 00:22:12,407
Eat.

175
00:22:16,575 --> 00:22:19,408
What happened?
Are you alone?

176
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:22,331
Where are you from?

177
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:38,889
You all right?
Come on!

178
00:24:48,742 --> 00:24:50,095
Assemble!

179
00:25:54,384 --> 00:25:55,420
Rin!

180
00:25:56,545 --> 00:25:58,695
Get a grip! Run!

181
00:25:59,345 --> 00:26:02,064
Yamata!
Let's get out of here!

182
00:26:02,225 --> 00:26:03,374
I'm staying!

183
00:26:03,505 --> 00:26:05,416
Forget it! It's too fast!

184
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:06,739
Go! Now!

185
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:07,860
You'll die!

186
00:26:08,145 --> 00:26:10,739
That thing killed our brothers!

187
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:12,259
Yamata!

188
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:16,379
Come with us!

189
00:26:23,386 --> 00:26:24,455
Yamata!

190
00:26:33,586 --> 00:26:34,860
Damn!

191
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:23,786
What was that?

192
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:25,060
Anybody see anything?

193
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:26,824
Just part of it.

194
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:28,868
And the others?

195
00:28:39,392 --> 00:28:43,510
So, that thing came to
our village last night...

196
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,501
Is it a dog or wolf sent by the Oda army?

197
00:28:49,872 --> 00:28:51,464
Or a bear after all?

198
00:28:51,592 --> 00:28:55,472
Too big for a dog or wolf.
Too fast for a bear.

199
00:28:55,633 --> 00:29:00,866
Then what? Demon? Monster?
We got a monster in our village?

200
00:29:03,553 --> 00:29:07,262
I've been many places over the years, but...

201
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:10,027
I've never heard of such a monster!

202
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:14,472
It could come from a foreign
land along with firearms.

203
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:21,943
Do we have to deal with it,
whatever it may be?

204
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:27,469
I've survived many years...

205
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:33,593
...only to be killed by a monster?

206
00:29:34,554 --> 00:29:38,070
No way! No!

207
00:29:42,195 --> 00:29:43,628
Now what?

208
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:49,190
-Yamata!
-What?

209
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:09,470
You...

210
00:30:12,236 --> 00:30:14,466
You brought that thing!

211
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:18,510
What? Say it louder!

212
00:30:20,676 --> 00:30:22,713
Kill that thing!

213
00:30:24,397 --> 00:30:27,389
That killed everyone in my village.

214
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:33,151
Your village?

215
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,476
So you fled?

216
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,790
What does it want?

217
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:27,719
It's a monster, all right?
It just wants to kill us all.

218
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,074
Sure.

219
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:56,714
I've never fled from enemies
who killed our brothers, right?

220
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,439
Right?

221
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:02,121
But not this time.

222
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:09,360
But whatever that thing may be,
we are ninja.

223
00:32:11,641 --> 00:32:16,636
You may be too young, but you
can't flee from the monster

224
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:19,714
without getting revenge, right?

225
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:27,757
Yes.

226
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:31,796
Keep watch.

227
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:46,604
Ouch! Oh shit! It hurts!

228
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:09,764
Why do I have to do this?

229
00:34:56,729 --> 00:34:58,879
Scared me.

230
00:36:09,852 --> 00:36:12,844
Serves you right!

231
00:36:19,853 --> 00:36:20,968
Nezumi, get down!

232
00:36:45,894 --> 00:36:47,327
It can't be!

233
00:36:57,814 --> 00:36:59,725
That's exciting.

234
00:37:01,775 --> 00:37:04,050
I don't think so!

235
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:20,043
No! There it is!

236
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,980
Sorry I took so long.

237
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:28,823
You bastard!

238
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,745
The Strongest

239
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,747
Go ahead, pick them up.

240
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:56,672
You all right?

241
00:43:57,753 --> 00:43:58,708
Yeah.

242
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:46,388
You okay?

243
00:44:47,796 --> 00:44:51,152
Yeah. No broken bones.

244
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:53,910
What happened to Jinnai?

245
00:44:57,636 --> 00:44:59,467
Dead.

246
00:45:00,716 --> 00:45:04,834
He must be.
He was taken by the monster.

247
00:45:05,756 --> 00:45:07,428
Devoured already.

248
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:15,916
What were you doing when
Jinnai and Rin were attacked?

249
00:45:16,077 --> 00:45:17,795
Taking a nap?

250
00:45:20,157 --> 00:45:24,594
I was sent flying through the air.
You saw it.

251
00:45:24,717 --> 00:45:29,916
You didn't get a scratch.
How could you give up so fast?

252
00:45:30,077 --> 00:45:32,638
It hurts! I'm sorry!
At any rate...

253
00:45:33,438 --> 00:45:38,876
...let's get back to the village.
We must report to Master.

254
00:45:39,718 --> 00:45:42,790
Hey! I have an idea!

255
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,668
That's the last one.
Let's capture it.

256
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:48,672
Huh?

257
00:45:49,558 --> 00:45:52,834
Release it in the Oda territory.

258
00:45:53,759 --> 00:45:58,037
Let it destroy the Oda army and Koga ninja.

259
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,832
We can receive rewards from Grand Master.

260
00:46:06,999 --> 00:46:08,478
Nonsense.

261
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:14,912
Or, we could lure it into
other villages of Iga ninja...

262
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,636
...and have it kill all the others.

263
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:26,509
That way, we can rule the whole
Iga clan! What do you think?

264
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,478
Enough!

265
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,876
What we must do now is save Jinnai, right?

266
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,473
Why? Are you nuts?
What do we get then?

267
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:47,675
You're gonna fight that
slimy monster for no reward?

268
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:51,516
He saved me when he was attacked.

269
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:54,037
And you saved him, too.

270
00:46:54,201 --> 00:46:55,680
You saw it?

271
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:01,959
No, that boy told me so.

272
00:47:02,122 --> 00:47:03,680
No I didn't!

273
00:47:06,082 --> 00:47:08,676
Don't make a fool of me.

274
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:12,395
Where have you been?
It's dangerous.

275
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:19,115
I found a trail of blood.
That monster must be bleeding.

276
00:47:21,602 --> 00:47:24,959
Let's go save him.
We can track down the monster!

277
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:30,160
I was so afraid.
But watching you guys fight...

278
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:33,196
I wanna do my part.

279
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:37,802
I wanna avenge my mother
and my people! Please!

280
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:46,918
Don't take him seriousIy, Yamata.
He's just a kid.

281
00:47:47,084 --> 00:47:51,236
He's gonna get you killed for sure.

282
00:47:57,564 --> 00:47:59,282
Yeah, I know.

283
00:48:05,084 --> 00:48:09,681
What? I'm not going there.
I'm going back.

284
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:13,884
Yeah, tell Master about it.

285
00:48:14,445 --> 00:48:18,518
Somebody has to do it.
It's important.

286
00:48:19,045 --> 00:48:21,036
Oh, yeah.

287
00:48:22,085 --> 00:48:23,757
You're right.

288
00:48:24,765 --> 00:48:27,996
I guess I'll have to go.
I'm a senior.

289
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:30,924
You bet I will.

290
00:48:31,086 --> 00:48:33,395
Better now than later.

291
00:48:33,966 --> 00:48:35,797
I'll go now.

292
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:38,037
See ya!

293
00:48:42,646 --> 00:48:43,874
Are you sure?

294
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:47,834
We should warn the village.

295
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:52,806
That thing could go there.

296
00:48:56,127 --> 00:48:57,765
Now, show us the trail.

297
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,121
Let's go save Jinnai.

298
00:50:50,892 --> 00:50:55,727
Why did the monsters take them away alive?

299
00:50:55,892 --> 00:50:57,325
Fresh meat, I guess.

300
00:50:57,492 --> 00:50:58,447
Yamata!

301
00:50:58,612 --> 00:50:59,567
What?

302
00:50:59,732 --> 00:51:01,450
He doesn't have to know.

303
00:51:01,612 --> 00:51:06,767
Why not? Nishi will join us
as ninja someday like his father.

304
00:51:09,133 --> 00:51:15,368
I want Jinnai alive, too. But
ninja are inseparable from death.

305
00:51:16,093 --> 00:51:18,926
We're living on the edge.

306
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:23,928
If you don't like that,
be a farmer or something.

307
00:51:27,214 --> 00:51:31,446
You volunteered.
You should know that.

308
00:51:32,974 --> 00:51:35,852
Why did you become a ninja, Rin?

309
00:51:38,134 --> 00:51:44,209
I have no brothers. So I did my
father a favor and became one.

310
00:51:44,614 --> 00:51:45,967
No choice?

311
00:51:46,094 --> 00:51:50,213
No, no.

312
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:58,211
I just didn't like the fact
that my dad wanted me to be a man.

313
00:52:00,095 --> 00:52:05,806
My old man was a peasant.
Killed in a war with my mother.

314
00:52:05,975 --> 00:52:07,966
I was adopted.

315
00:52:10,135 --> 00:52:12,855
We have to fight to live.

316
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:16,451
But I won't give up on him.

317
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:22,934
I  don't expect to live long.
I'll just fight with my brothers.

318
00:52:23,656 --> 00:52:24,850
Right?

319
00:52:30,336 --> 00:52:31,451
Look.

320
00:52:43,337 --> 00:52:47,046
They're not from Iga.
Must be Koga ninja.

321
00:52:47,217 --> 00:52:49,412
They were scouting?

322
00:52:49,577 --> 00:52:51,329
Out for that fire?

323
00:52:52,137 --> 00:52:54,287
Killed by the monster, huh?

324
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,049
Where are the bodies?

325
00:53:12,778 --> 00:53:14,336
I'm home.

326
00:53:38,939 --> 00:53:40,373
Oh shit.

327
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,219
Monster...

328
00:54:02,421 --> 00:54:03,376
Uh-oh.

329
00:54:56,223 --> 00:54:57,451
Look!

330
00:55:11,304 --> 00:55:12,703
What the hell?

331
00:55:23,104 --> 00:55:24,457
Nezumi?

332
00:55:25,664 --> 00:55:28,337
Yamata! Help! Help me!

333
00:55:28,584 --> 00:55:29,699
What's wrong?

334
00:55:30,905 --> 00:55:32,497
Everyone is...

335
00:55:32,905 --> 00:55:33,860
What?

336
00:55:35,585 --> 00:55:37,143
Dead! All of them!

337
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,024
What?

338
00:55:40,985 --> 00:55:43,704
Where is it?

339
00:55:43,865 --> 00:55:46,937
Let's get out of here!
It'll kill us all!

340
00:55:52,506 --> 00:55:54,258
It's not here.

341
00:57:01,549 --> 00:57:03,540
Where's Jinnai?

342
00:57:19,589 --> 00:57:21,182
Is that Jinnai?

343
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,660
It's the monster thing.

344
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,183
Huh?

345
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:38,382
Kid, I'll teach you how to fight.
But for now, stay back.

346
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:40,421
Don't come out.

347
00:58:12,832 --> 00:58:14,823
Come on! Wake up!

348
01:00:41,879 --> 01:00:43,358
What's going on?

349
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:45,475
We'll have to kill them.

350
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:46,708
Jinnai, too?

351
01:00:46,959 --> 01:00:49,268
Yeah, I know that!

352
01:02:04,642 --> 01:02:06,792
Shut the fuck up.

353
01:02:32,644 --> 01:02:34,475
Their throat!

354
01:04:43,649 --> 01:04:46,528
Jinnai! Come on! Wake up!

355
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:48,643
You all right?

356
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:59,607
Ya... Yamata...

357
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:25,200
Yamata!

358
01:05:31,172 --> 01:05:32,890
See to Jinnai.

359
01:07:24,097 --> 01:07:27,851
Smart bastard, aren't you?

360
01:13:03,952 --> 01:13:06,512
Death

361
01:13:48,474 --> 01:13:50,465
Revenge is ours.

362
01:14:12,635 --> 01:14:13,590
You okay?

363
01:14:15,595 --> 01:14:17,028
Feel funny.

364
01:14:17,715 --> 01:14:20,912
What did you do to me?

365
01:14:23,276 --> 01:14:26,552
I hate reaching into your throat.

366
01:14:43,876 --> 01:14:44,832
Hey.

367
01:14:59,437 --> 01:15:02,395
Okay, let's go.

368
01:15:07,278 --> 01:15:10,111
Nishi! Hurry up!

369
01:15:12,598 --> 01:15:15,556
What are you doing?
Let's go.

370
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,719
Nishi!

371
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,159
Coming!
