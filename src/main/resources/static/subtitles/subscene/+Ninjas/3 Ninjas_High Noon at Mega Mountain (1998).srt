1
00:00:23,889 --> 00:00:27,915
Centuries ago, a village
in Japan lived in peace...

2
00:00:28,713 --> 00:00:31,823
protected by the power
of the Golden Broadswords.

3
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,653
And now, young warriors...

4
00:00:34,732 --> 00:00:38,800
you have been chosen to wrest
the sword from evil hands...

5
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,790
and return it
to its rightful place.

6
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,563
Ninja!

7
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:16,634
Let the games begin!

8
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:29,631
Let's do it.

9
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:38,450
Let's go, TumTum, come on!

10
00:02:57,413 --> 00:02:58,454
- Yeah!
- All right!

11
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:00,293
- Way to go!
- Awesome!

12
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:04,335
- Piece of cake!
- Speaking of cake, let's eat.

13
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:07,256
So you think you're feeling
pretty good?

14
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:09,335
Why shouldn't we?
We smoked that course.

15
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,376
- Shredded it!
- Kicked its butt!

16
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:15,457
You think you're master
of your domain, don't you?

17
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:19,257
I thought you'd be proud of us.
We got the sword!

18
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:25,339
A ninja's journey is never over
until he returns...

19
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:27,420
from whence he came.

20
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,421
Beware, young ninjas!

21
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:44,342
Try to find you...

22
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:18,389
Congratulations, you all passed
with flying colours.

23
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,390
Yeah, black and blue.

24
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,390
You just learned a ninja's most
valuable lesson, humility.

25
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:26,511
Don't you mean the agony of defeat?

26
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,311
Agony in defeat.

27
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:33,393
When the ninja's head
swells with pride...

28
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:35,512
he becomes his own worst enemy.

29
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:40,354
He loses focus,
his spirit loses balance.

30
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:45,315
He sees, but he is blind.
A ninja's eyes can betray him.

31
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:47,475
He must learn to trust
his other senses.

32
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:51,356
He must learn to see with his ears!

33
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:54,316
He must be one with his environment.

34
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,397
Take this!

35
00:04:59,397 --> 00:05:02,478
Go over there and dig a well, go!

36
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,680
I wish we didn't have to go soon.

37
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:15,481
Now we have to wait another
year for more training.

38
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:19,441
Ninja training is cool,
but this summer was my last.

39
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:23,322
- Don't say that. Grandpa might hear.
- You mean that, Rocky?

40
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:26,443
Don't get me wrong. I love Grandpa
and karate is way cool...

41
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:28,323
but next year I'll be 15.

42
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:31,364
Time to get a job so I have
wheels when I get my license.

43
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:33,284
But what about ninja training?

44
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:37,325
I don't think anyone's gonna hire me
because I got ninja experience.

45
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:41,286
Maybe Rocky's got a point.

46
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:45,287
Not you too, Colt! Don't you guys
like being ninja warriors?

47
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:46,487
It's just a game we play.

48
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:48,367
I'd like to hang at the beach.

49
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,528
But we'll be superheroes...

50
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:52,448
learn the closed fist,
like Dave Dragon.

51
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:56,369
You watch too much TV.

52
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:59,530
There's gonna be a lot of
good summers here.

53
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,290
Just because we're leaving
doesn't mean you are.

54
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,331
I'm 15. Summers are starting
to be important to me.

55
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,332
I miss the beach.
Now you got Grandpa to yourself.

56
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,460
The men are ready.

57
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,503
Mom, Dad!

58
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:07,423
Hey, guys!

59
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:09,423
How are my ninjas? How you doing?

60
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:10,504
I missed you!

61
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:12,344
Hi, baby, hi!

62
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:14,544
- How's my birthday boy?
- You have a great time?

63
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:18,466
We murderized this killer
obstacle course and had cake.

64
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:21,426
Mom, anything to eat in the fridge?

65
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:23,306
Yeah, sandwiches sound okay?

66
00:07:23,387 --> 00:07:24,546
- Awesome!
- Thanks, Mom.

67
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:28,547
Colt, Rocky!

68
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:34,349
- Once a ninja, always a ninja.
- Sure, Grandpa.

69
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:38,509
Anything the matter, Dad?

70
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:42,510
Oh, nothing a little
adolescence won't cure.

71
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,511
I think it's time to put...

72
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:50,351
old Grandpa on the shelf
like GI Joe and Buzz Lightyear.

73
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:56,393
I'm afraid our young ninjas
have found new thresholds to cross.

74
00:07:56,433 --> 00:08:00,353
They do grow up fast. One minute
you bounce them on your knee...

75
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:03,315
and then they want to borrow
the car for a date.

76
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:05,315
You sound like they're going off...

77
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:07,515
to fight the Crusades!
They're still boys!

78
00:08:08,315 --> 00:08:10,475
I gotta get back to work.
The FBI doesn't wait.

79
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,556
All right, baby.

80
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:16,397
I still need you, Grandpa.

81
00:08:17,357 --> 00:08:21,398
And I need you, now even more.

82
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:26,398
And as you grow older the distance
between us will become greater.

83
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:31,360
But, if you have this,
I'll always be with you.

84
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,401
- "Where one goes, we all go."
- Yes.

85
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:41,481
You coming to my party?
We're going to Mega Mountain.

86
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,483
You bet the world I will!

87
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,483
- Hurry up!
- I'm trying!

88
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:51,444
- There they are!
- Let's get them!

89
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:55,405
All right, we got you now!

90
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:11,527
Thanks, Dave Dragon.

91
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:14,448
Hope you enjoyed
this ex citing episode.

92
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:17,409
Unfortunately, it's our last.

93
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:21,372
After 15 years, the network's
pulling the plug on our show.

94
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:25,373
According to the ratings,
kids don't believe in heroes anymore.

95
00:09:25,454 --> 00:09:29,376
So to my legions of young warriors
who still do believe...

96
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:31,497
my heartfelt thanks
for your support.

97
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,538
You gave me
a lifetime of memories.

98
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:37,421
If you uphold the way
of the closed fist, respect...

99
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,384
courage, trust, honour, teamwork,
you'll always be heroes to me.

100
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,545
Join Dave Dragon in his final
public appearance...

101
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,426
as he shows you the way
of the closed fist!

102
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:51,389
This weekend, at the one,
the only, Mega Mountain!

103
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:55,430
TumTum, how about
a bologna-ham-cheese-bacon...

104
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,472
lettuce-tomato-turkey
and Swiss sandwich?

105
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:00,393
It's your favourite.

106
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,435
No, thanks, Mom, I'm not hungry.

107
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,482
There's one main entrance
to the park, here...

108
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:18,444
on the north side.
The perimeter is covered...

109
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,446
with a 10-foot fence prohibiting
all other access.

110
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:26,489
These points, A and B,
are emergency exits.

111
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:31,376
"A" squad will split into three groups
of six and seize these points.

112
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:36,462
"B" squad will be here, at the pumping
station, our point of entrance.

113
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:39,506
Three roving patrols will wander
through the park...

114
00:10:39,627 --> 00:10:43,431
to take care of any troublemakers.
Any problems...

115
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:47,557
we put them here, in the tank,
under the roller coaster.

116
00:10:47,637 --> 00:10:51,562
Then we seize this area,
Master Control.

117
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:55,447
Then the entire park
will be at our disposal.

118
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:57,650
Any questions?

119
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:01,495
Good. We strike at noon.

120
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:32,616
Amanda, have you seen my mixing bowl?
Amanda?

121
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:34,539
Hi, welcome to the neighbourhood.

122
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:38,464
Oh, thank you!
Hi, I'm Beverly Morgan-Green.

123
00:11:38,544 --> 00:11:39,904
Jessica Douglas, nice to meet you.

124
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:44,632
I hope they don't have prissy girl
types like the Anderson twins.

125
00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:47,556
Hit it!

126
00:12:08,744 --> 00:12:10,586
Look out!

127
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:31,654
I'm terribly sorry about your window.
Meet my daughter, Amanda.

128
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:33,737
- Hello, Amanda.
- I'm sorry.

129
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:35,699
That comes out of your allowance.

130
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,585
Hi, guys. These are my sons,
Jeffrey and Michael.

131
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,747
I'm TumTum, he's Colt.

132
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:42,669
Let's get your helicopter back.

133
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,750
Want to join us for breakfast?

134
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:47,595
- Oh, it's okay with me, honey.
- Come on.

135
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:49,758
Rocky, breakfast!

136
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,682
That helicopter's cool.
Did you make it?

137
00:12:52,722 --> 00:12:55,686
My dad taught me. He works
for a special effects firm.

138
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:57,688
They make neat stuff for movies.

139
00:12:57,769 --> 00:12:59,650
You must be the pilot.

140
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,731
Rocky, this is Amanda.

141
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:01,772
Thanks.

142
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:04,853
- Hi.
- What have you got there?

143
00:13:05,574 --> 00:13:06,775
Gizmos for my dad's movie.

144
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:08,816
Cool, a yo-yo!

145
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:10,658
Watch me loop-the-loop.

146
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:11,739
No, don't!

147
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:24,908
- Sorry again, Mrs. Douglas.
- Oh, Rocky, Jennifer called.

148
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,790
She'll meet you at Mega Mountain
at the main gate.

149
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,833
- What's Mega Mountain?
- The coolest amusement park!

150
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:34,716
We'll see Dave Dragon
fight the Tsunamis.

151
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:36,597
No!

152
00:13:36,676 --> 00:13:39,639
But you guys promised me.
It's my birthday.

153
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,640
You two, be nice to your brother.

154
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,763
I have an idea, Amanda.
Why not join us?

155
00:13:45,803 --> 00:13:48,645
That sounds like fun, but...

156
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:50,686
I don't want to impose.

157
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,730
No, we want you to come.

158
00:13:56,731 --> 00:13:58,733
Yeah, Dave Dragon!

159
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:00,813
Great, thank you.

160
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:04,857
- Hi, welcome to Mega Mountain.
- Thank you.

161
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:08,819
Here are your tickets.
We'll meet you here at 5:00.

162
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,741
Hi, Samuel!

163
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:17,626
- Rocky, look after your brother.
- I don't need a babysitter.

164
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:19,787
- Promise me.
- Promise her.

165
00:14:20,828 --> 00:14:22,709
- I promise.
- Great!

166
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,712
Have a good time, and try
to stay out of trouble, okay? Bye!

167
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,007
What do you want to ride first?

168
00:14:48,648 --> 00:14:49,769
I want to see Dave Dragon.

169
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:52,891
Hey, nobody told us we were
babysitting squirts.

170
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,734
Get a haircut, Buzz.
Nobody's babysitting anybody.

171
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:00,777
They were just leaving, weren't you?

172
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,659
Come on.

173
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:06,099
Let's go, guys. We don't need them.

174
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:09,903
- But you promised Mom.
- Come on.

175
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:11,865
What's wrong with him?

176
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:15,747
Just a case of the stupids
whenever he's around Jennifer.

177
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:17,789
Rocky loves Jennifer.

178
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:19,830
Rocky loves Jennifer.

179
00:16:51,776 --> 00:16:53,777
Let's have some fun.

180
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:52,862
This Dave Dragon fella.

181
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:55,944
He's just an actor,
but he could cause problems.

182
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,986
Take care of it, personally.

183
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,870
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls!

184
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,832
The moment you've all
been waiting for...

185
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:10,074
Dave Dragon and the Star Force Five!

186
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:35,881
Here he is, Dave Dragon!

187
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,830
Thanks for visiting Mega Mountain,
enjoy your stay.

188
00:20:08,026 --> 00:20:10,862
The park is closed.

189
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:36,737
- What's going on?
- Where are you going?

190
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:38,894
What's it to you?
Get your hands off me!

191
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:40,970
What's going on here? Stop, stop it!

192
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,841
Hello, I'm Sister Beatrice
of Our Lady of...

193
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,756
Perpetual Motion Hospital.

194
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:15,670
Could I please see your manager?

195
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:16,908
I'll handle this.

196
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:24,817
Can I help you?

197
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:27,691
I'm taking up a collection.

198
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:51,609
You have the right to remain silent.

199
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:55,802
Anything you say will be
used against you.

200
00:21:56,601 --> 00:21:57,679
Move it! Move it!

201
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:26,550
Remote uplink interconnected.

202
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:27,789
One.

203
00:22:30,623 --> 00:22:31,623
Two.

204
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:34,736
- Closed-circuit monitors active.
- Three.

205
00:22:36,612 --> 00:22:37,651
Four.

206
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:39,609
Five.

207
00:22:39,687 --> 00:22:43,561
The video link is functioning.
All stations secure.

208
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:47,553
Excellent. Time to play
"Dialing for Dollars."

209
00:22:51,707 --> 00:22:56,618
A little bit more to the left, sugar.
Oh, yeah, that's the spot.

210
00:22:56,738 --> 00:22:59,613
Vidphone, sir. Mr. Smithers.

211
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:00,653
Can't you see I'm busy?

212
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:03,527
I'm sorry, sir,
he insists it's urgent.

213
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,596
Don't forget where we left off, sugar.

214
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:17,623
Smithers, this better be good.

215
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:24,650
Mr. Jacobson, how nice to meet you.

216
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:27,685
Who are you?
What are you doing in my park?

217
00:23:28,483 --> 00:23:31,518
Haven't you heard?
I'm the new director of operations...

218
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,552
at Mega Mountain, Mr. Jacobson.
Or may I call you Harry?

219
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:37,548
No, you most certainly may not.

220
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:40,664
In any case, it's my first day
on the job...

221
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,458
and I'm afraid I'm all thumbs.

222
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:46,613
What would happen if I increased
Raging Waters' speed...

223
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:48,531
another 20 miles an hour?

224
00:23:48,609 --> 00:23:51,485
Those turns would be
awfully hard to manoeuvre.

225
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:52,602
- You wouldn't!
- I would.

226
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:56,516
And I will, if you don't
pay me $10 million.

227
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:57,635
You are insane!

228
00:23:58,433 --> 00:23:59,673
That's what my shrink tells me.

229
00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:02,625
Unless you cough up
the dough by 3., 00 p.m...

230
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:07,498
you'll be broke. You never know
when a roller coaster might derail...

231
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:12,409
a safety harness might release.
Imagine the lawsuits, Harry.

232
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:15,524
Heartbroken families,
the cover of Time magazine.

233
00:24:15,564 --> 00:24:17,560
You'll be the owner
of "Murder Mountain."

234
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:20,515
I'll call the cops!
I'll call the National Guard!

235
00:24:20,595 --> 00:24:23,350
If I so much as smell a cop...

236
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,465
I'll take your customers
on the ride of their lives.

237
00:24:26,505 --> 00:24:30,378
Drop the money by helicopter
over the Main Street fountain.

238
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,535
Do as I say and no one gets hurt.

239
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,442
Harry, when can we go shopping
for my new Mercedes?

240
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:52,341
- Sure is high.
- 208 feet, to be exact.

241
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,374
- Should we do this so soon after lunch?
- What are you, chicken?

242
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:00,407
Oh, my God, my purse!
I lost my purse!

243
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:03,362
Maybe you left it back
at the burger place.

244
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,477
You guys go ahead.
I'll go look for it.

245
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:09,312
Meet you after the ride?

246
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,387
Shut up, Eric. He's being considerate.

247
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:15,422
- I'm considerate.
- Don't you mean "conceited"?

248
00:25:31,354 --> 00:25:34,269
Thank you, boys and girls,
moms and dads.

249
00:25:34,349 --> 00:25:36,265
You've been a terrific audience.

250
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:39,300
That was awesome!

251
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:41,337
Yeah, I forgot how cool he was.

252
00:25:41,377 --> 00:25:43,253
Too bad they're cancelling his show.

253
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:46,248
Will you take me backstage
to get his autograph?

254
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:48,325
Come on, I want to ride Galactic!

255
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:50,401
It'll only take a minute, please.

256
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,318
Go ahead, I'll wait here.

257
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:58,268
Great show!

258
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:14,201
Excellent show.
Marvellous, truly marvellous.

259
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:18,194
Thank you. It's always nice
to meet some of my older fans.

260
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:20,311
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you can help me.

261
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,265
By going to sleep. Klaus?

262
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:30,213
- Put him under there.
- All right, come on.

263
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,210
We're gonna need a couple guys.

264
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:35,285
What are you doing to Dave?

265
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:39,158
- Get them!
- Come back here!

266
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:48,343
- Let's go, let's go!
- Get the kid!

267
00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:00,082
The burger place guy said
someone dropped off a purse?

268
00:27:00,163 --> 00:27:03,077
Yeah, it's here someplace.
Wait a minute.

269
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:19,090
Hey, where'd you go?

270
00:27:22,084 --> 00:27:24,161
- Who are those guys?
- Over there!

271
00:27:38,177 --> 00:27:40,054
Come on, TumTum.

272
00:27:52,194 --> 00:27:57,105
If you come quietly,
I promise not to harm you.

273
00:27:57,185 --> 00:28:00,140
Otherwise, I feed you to my dogs!

274
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:04,013
Even ugly dogs can be taught to heel.

275
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:08,087
I don't think you understand
who you're messing with!

276
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:15,035
Ninjas!

277
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:34,082
- There he is!
- I got him!

278
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:50,973
Get me out of here!

279
00:28:56,044 --> 00:28:59,119
Come here, you little punk, come here!
You're all mine.

280
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:25,953
Get up there!

281
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:28,988
What do you want on your tombstone?

282
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,979
- Pepperoni, sausage and onion.
- Knock it off!

283
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:38,013
Every year, the same old show.
Next year we go back to Disneyland.

284
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:29,730
- Come and get me!
- I'll pick you up by your ponytail!

285
00:30:41,972 --> 00:30:43,732
Get off me!

286
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:48,733
What do you think you're
doing there, partner?

287
00:30:59,855 --> 00:31:02,736
- Have you seen my brothers?
- They ran in there!

288
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:17,977
Surprise!

289
00:31:22,899 --> 00:31:24,779
Give me five!

290
00:31:47,902 --> 00:31:49,783
All right, way to go!

291
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:50,943
That was awesome!

292
00:32:01,905 --> 00:32:03,906
Come on, you mangy dogs!

293
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:12,827
Hurry! You've got to see this!

294
00:32:12,907 --> 00:32:13,907
Come on.

295
00:32:25,748 --> 00:32:28,750
I ran here to get help
and I found him like this.

296
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:30,950
- What do you think?
- Probably a sleep agent.

297
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:33,750
And that's not all. Look there.

298
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,791
- Someone's taken over the park.
- That's impossible.

299
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,871
- Let's call.
- It's dead. I already tried.

300
00:32:38,951 --> 00:32:40,751
Look!

301
00:32:40,952 --> 00:32:43,872
- What do we do?
- I know someone who can help us!

302
00:32:46,912 --> 00:32:48,753
What the?

303
00:32:48,952 --> 00:32:51,873
- What's going on?
- You were attacked by ninjas!

304
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:53,873
- Who are you kids?
- I'm Colt.

305
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:56,994
These are my brothers, Rocky
and TumTum. This is Amanda.

306
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:00,754
We came for an autograph
but saw you get attacked.

307
00:33:00,835 --> 00:33:02,995
Yeah, but don't worry.
We kicked their butts!

308
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:05,995
We think ninjas may have
taken over the park.

309
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:09,796
If that's true, I want to
thank you for saving me.

310
00:33:09,836 --> 00:33:11,836
Let the grownups handle it from here.

311
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:13,797
I'll see what's up.

312
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:14,957
Can't we come with you?

313
00:33:16,837 --> 00:33:18,837
I appreciate it, TumTum, I do.

314
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:22,958
But real heroes know when to play
it cool. Stay here till I get back.

315
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:26,759
And don't worry.
I'll be back with help soon.

316
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:33,840
Great. We have to sit around here
while he has all the fun.

317
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Hey!

318
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,961
Look at this.

319
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,961
Those guys must've left it
when they chased you out.

320
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:41,881
Does it work?
We could call the police!

321
00:33:44,842 --> 00:33:46,803
Where's the best place to transmit?

322
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:57,964
Cool! We can see everything
from up here!

323
00:34:02,965 --> 00:34:06,845
Switch to channel 9, the emergency
frequency Dad transmits on.

324
00:34:06,926 --> 00:34:10,886
Great. What'll we say, ninjas have
taken over Mega Mountain?

325
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,767
We're just kids.
They'll think it's a prank.

326
00:34:13,846 --> 00:34:16,767
TumTum, remember what
Dad tells us to yell...

327
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,807
in case of a real emergency?

328
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,008
Fire!

329
00:35:07,976 --> 00:35:09,776
We've got company.

330
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:11,856
Medusa!

331
00:35:13,897 --> 00:35:15,977
That fool! Send them a warning!

332
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:20,937
You heard her.

333
00:35:46,022 --> 00:35:48,822
This is way beyond my jurisdiction.

334
00:35:48,903 --> 00:35:50,022
Call in the feds!

335
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:55,863
Yes, I won't forget the cake.

336
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:59,824
- I'll get it on the way to the park.
- Sam, urgent call on line two.

337
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:02,865
Hang on one minute, honey.
Sam Douglas.

338
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:03,985
What?

339
00:36:04,865 --> 00:36:05,905
How long ago?

340
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,865
I'm on my way.

341
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:11,825
Jessica, something's happened
at the park. I gotta go.

342
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:14,906
That's the feds.

343
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:17,947
Find me a UHF frequency
and patch me through.

344
00:36:18,027 --> 00:36:19,987
Remote uplink interconnected.

345
00:36:32,029 --> 00:36:35,829
- Sam Douglas, FBI. What do you got?
- I'm not sure.

346
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,830
They opened fire when we arrived.

347
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,911
According to our spotters, they've got
the park sealed off from within.

348
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:43,871
Sam, I've got something.

349
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:51,033
They're broadcasting on UHF.
We'll have to untrap.

350
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:54,913
- Welcome to the party.
- Good Lord!

351
00:36:55,073 --> 00:36:57,833
I want to speak to
whoever's in charge.

352
00:36:57,993 --> 00:37:00,954
This is Sam Douglas, FBI.
Who am I speaking with?

353
00:37:01,034 --> 00:37:02,794
Dad!

354
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:03,874
Kids?

355
00:37:03,915 --> 00:37:06,915
- What's going on?
- Ninjas are all over the park, Dad!

356
00:37:06,995 --> 00:37:09,915
- Are you okay? Is Amanda with you?
- We're okay.

357
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:12,836
They cut the phones,
so we used the radio.

358
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:14,876
You did fine, son. You did fine.

359
00:37:14,956 --> 00:37:17,877
Lay low and let the pros
do their jobs, all right?

360
00:37:17,956 --> 00:37:19,797
How very touching.

361
00:37:19,877 --> 00:37:23,877
I hate to break up this family
reunion, but I have an agenda to keep.

362
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:27,038
- Name your demands.
- It's a little late for that.

363
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:29,878
Mr. Moneybags himself,
Harry Jacobson...

364
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:32,959
is already emptying the
piggy banks, as instructed.

365
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:37,880
Get Jacobson here.
We need to try and buy some time.

366
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,961
Run her picture. I want to
know who we're dealing with.

367
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,001
And get me an engineer, now!

368
00:37:43,841 --> 00:37:44,962
I told Harry, no police.

369
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:47,842
You'll have to
suffer the consequences.

370
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:49,002
Watch closely.

371
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:02,044
Now increase the speed
by 20 percent.

372
00:38:07,925 --> 00:38:10,845
All right, stop the ride!
You've made your point.

373
00:38:10,925 --> 00:38:12,045
I don't believe I have.

374
00:38:12,886 --> 00:38:13,886
Thirty percent.

375
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,928
It's our fault!
They're gonna get hurt.

376
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:27,088
- We're ninjas, we can stop them.
- It's out of our league.

377
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,009
This isn't one of Grandpa's crazy
adventures, this is real stuff.

378
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:33,811
We're unarmed and outnumbered.

379
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,895
Maybe we can even the odds.

380
00:38:38,896 --> 00:38:41,860
My dad and I worked on
these for his new movie.

381
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,874
Amanda, this is no time for games!

382
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:55,916
Yeah, what are we gonna do...

383
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:57,959
beat them at Go Fish?

384
00:39:03,045 --> 00:39:05,848
Go ahead, Rocky, now you.

385
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:18,943
- Hey, what about me?
- Wait, they're smoke bombs.

386
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,104
They explode on impact.

387
00:39:20,945 --> 00:39:23,027
If they can't see you,
they can't hit you.

388
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,992
We can't do it without you.

389
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:30,877
Let's do it.

390
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,883
Hold it.

391
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,050
- Somebody called for an engineer?
- Look.

392
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,052
Oh, my God!

393
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:47,136
What happens to them if
that ride goes any faster?

394
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:49,097
At twice its normal speed?

395
00:39:49,938 --> 00:39:52,902
Extreme nausea, loss of
consciousness...

396
00:39:53,022 --> 00:39:54,904
maybe even death.

397
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,120
Hey, boiled scum!

398
00:40:10,963 --> 00:40:13,045
Afraid of someone half your size?

399
00:40:13,966 --> 00:40:15,008
Let's get them!

400
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:17,050
Now, TumTum!

401
00:40:56,134 --> 00:40:58,177
Why do you use your head
to hit my feet?

402
00:41:16,078 --> 00:41:18,000
Emergency stop!

403
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:39,104
Numeric access granted.

404
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:27,119
Power terminated.

405
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:39,293
Patch me through to
those little snots!

406
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:52,308
Don't think of escaping,
or I'll come and deck you.

407
00:42:53,149 --> 00:42:54,270
Get it? "Deck" you?

408
00:42:56,353 --> 00:43:00,237
Foolish children!
I'll teach you to mess with Medusa!

409
00:43:00,317 --> 00:43:03,160
- Nice face.
- Yeah, nice face.

410
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,240
Not!

411
00:43:07,245 --> 00:43:11,170
- We're not afraid of you.
- Oh, but you will be!

412
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:12,291
Freeze that picture.

413
00:43:12,371 --> 00:43:14,293
Get me a printout.

414
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,142
- Lothar?
- Medusa.

415
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:26,307
Find those idiot nephews of mine.
I have a job for them.

416
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:38,201
Sam! I've got her!

417
00:43:40,363 --> 00:43:43,206
Mary Ann Rogers.
Goes by the name "Medusa."

418
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,210
Escaped from prison last month.
It's a laundry list:

419
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,332
Extortion, robbery.
She's done it all.

420
00:43:48,412 --> 00:43:52,217
She's looking for a quick
score to get out of the country.

421
00:43:56,421 --> 00:44:00,266
This is killer! You sure
Auntie won't mind us taking a break?

422
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:02,389
What Auntie M. Don't know
won't hurt her.

423
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:05,232
What can go wrong if
the plan's foolproof?

424
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:07,314
I wish the line would move faster.

425
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,365
- Hey, no cutting in line!
- Hey, you're not the boss of me!

426
00:44:19,248 --> 00:44:20,409
You idiots!

427
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,212
I told you, no horsing around!

428
00:44:23,292 --> 00:44:26,456
- If Medusa knows you're goofing off...
- No! Please, she'll kill us!

429
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,300
Okay, then pay attention.

430
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,224
You find these kids
and maybe I'll let you live.

431
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:35,426
They were last seen at
the Avalanche ride.

432
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:39,351
Hey! This is a covert operation.

433
00:44:40,352 --> 00:44:42,434
- Put on your glasses!
- Oh!

434
00:44:44,397 --> 00:44:45,397
Now move it!

435
00:44:45,478 --> 00:44:47,280
Sorry.

436
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:59,374
It's been over an hour.
What could he possibly be doing?

437
00:44:59,454 --> 00:45:01,496
- Maybe he got sick.
- Probably wussed out.

438
00:45:02,297 --> 00:45:04,420
Wet his pants and is too
chicken to face us.

439
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,462
We're wasting time. We should bail.

440
00:45:07,303 --> 00:45:10,347
I'm his girlfriend.
How could he do this to me?

441
00:45:10,426 --> 00:45:14,351
Girl, I've been there,
and they're all dogs.

442
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:24,443
Can I have your autograph?

443
00:45:25,404 --> 00:45:26,525
Sure.

444
00:45:32,452 --> 00:45:33,493
This is interesting.

445
00:45:34,334 --> 00:45:36,457
- Why?
- The rides are controlled manually...

446
00:45:36,536 --> 00:45:39,420
with switch boxes.
But the speed of the rides...

447
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,462
and the tracking,
are monitored...

448
00:45:41,543 --> 00:45:45,306
through this display.
- Then somewhere inside the park...

449
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:47,429
there's a Master Control.
- Wait!

450
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:50,392
Back at Guest Relations,
they had a computer.

451
00:45:50,473 --> 00:45:53,516
- It's probably tied to Master Control!
- So?

452
00:45:54,357 --> 00:45:55,399
So...

453
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:58,482
if I hack my way into
the mainframe computer...

454
00:45:58,562 --> 00:46:01,365
I can shut the ride controls down.

455
00:46:01,445 --> 00:46:02,527
We wouldn't be fighting.

456
00:46:02,567 --> 00:46:05,410
Technically, we wouldn't
be disobeying Dad...

457
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,373
and the bad guys
couldn't zap the rides.

458
00:46:08,413 --> 00:46:09,494
There they are!

459
00:46:10,376 --> 00:46:12,418
He didn't say we couldn't
defend ourselves.

460
00:46:12,498 --> 00:46:16,502
Amanda, we'll draw them out.
We'll meet up at Guest Relations.

461
00:46:16,582 --> 00:46:18,384
Good luck.

462
00:46:18,465 --> 00:46:20,548
Hey! Come and get us!

463
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:22,509
Come on!

464
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:01,434
Sam! What happened?
Are the kids okay?

465
00:47:01,554 --> 00:47:05,519
Honey, don't worry. I talked to them.
They're gonna be fine.

466
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:09,444
Chief, how long before
SWAT arrives?

467
00:47:09,564 --> 00:47:11,566
They'll be here in 15 minutes.

468
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:15,569
What do you want?

469
00:47:32,492 --> 00:47:33,651
Is there a problem?

470
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:46,453
Susan Blankenship here,
for Eyewitness News.

471
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:48,573
Boss, take a look at this.

472
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:52,533
Terrorists have seized
the park and are holding hostages.

473
00:47:52,614 --> 00:47:56,494
However, police and FBI officials
are not releasing information...

474
00:47:56,534 --> 00:47:57,654
regarding the demands.

475
00:47:58,494 --> 00:48:00,455
I'll update you with developments.

476
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:04,655
Good. That ought to put more pressure
on the very rich Harry Jacobson.

477
00:48:09,656 --> 00:48:10,656
Get him.

478
00:48:26,577 --> 00:48:27,578
Get him!

479
00:48:29,418 --> 00:48:30,418
Hold him!

480
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,580
Maybe I'll show you mercy
and make you my boy-toy.

481
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,540
Thanks, but I'd rather
be eaten alive by wolves.

482
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:48,460
That can be arranged.
Tie him up over there.

483
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,420
Come on, get up!

484
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,502
Excuse me, man. Excuse me.

485
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:02,582
I know we're taking you hostage,
but could I get an autograph?

486
00:49:02,662 --> 00:49:04,542
- It's for my sister.
- C. J!

487
00:49:05,662 --> 00:49:07,462
I get it later, man.

488
00:49:15,463 --> 00:49:16,623
- Split up!
- Yeah!

489
00:49:17,463 --> 00:49:18,464
Okay, okay, okay!

490
00:49:18,543 --> 00:49:20,664
Zed, get that one! Buelow, that one!

491
00:49:21,504 --> 00:49:23,504
Come on! Go!

492
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:28,425
Hey, beat it, kid!

493
00:49:31,545 --> 00:49:33,586
I'll have five dollars' worth.

494
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:48,587
You couldn't hit an elephant
in the butt with a bazooka!

495
00:49:57,508 --> 00:50:00,589
Those who paid, get ready
to shoot at the target.

496
00:50:04,628 --> 00:50:05,628
I'll get you!

497
00:50:07,469 --> 00:50:08,590
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

498
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,630
I'm gonna get you,
and you're gonna pay for this!

499
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,471
Little twerp! I got you!

500
00:50:25,671 --> 00:50:27,472
Not the face!

501
00:50:31,472 --> 00:50:34,552
Exit to your left, everyone.
Exit to your left, please.

502
00:50:34,633 --> 00:50:38,473
I'm sorry, you guys, you're
gonna have to take your seats.

503
00:50:38,553 --> 00:50:40,673
- I'm sorry, you have to sit down.
- No, see...

504
00:50:41,473 --> 00:50:42,673
I'm sorry! Sit!

505
00:50:43,554 --> 00:50:44,554
Down!

506
00:50:55,675 --> 00:50:57,515
What's the matter?

507
00:50:57,635 --> 00:51:00,436
- Bad hair day?
- Hey!

508
00:51:00,556 --> 00:51:02,555
- It won't budge!
- I know! Shut up!

509
00:51:03,635 --> 00:51:06,477
Let's see how they like
their own medicine.

510
00:51:09,516 --> 00:51:11,517
Oh, uh, excuse me!

511
00:51:19,438 --> 00:51:20,598
Oh, a little faster?

512
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,679
Hey, man, check this out.

513
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,680
Lothar.

514
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,601
I'll take care of the geeks myself.
They're dog meat.

515
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:55,602
Let's find Amanda.

516
00:52:30,446 --> 00:52:31,446

Yes! Dang, I'm good!

521
00:52:49,488 --> 00:52:51,648
Start with the Atom Smasher.

522
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:53,568
Locked.

523
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:09,690
Okay, men.

524
00:53:11,651 --> 00:53:14,451
We have a D-9 scenario.

525
00:53:14,571 --> 00:53:16,532
Those are innocent civilians inside.

526
00:53:16,691 --> 00:53:18,572
I don't want anybody harmed.

527
00:53:18,651 --> 00:53:20,452
Let's move out.

528
00:53:27,493 --> 00:53:28,533
Sam?

529
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:30,573
They're the best, honey.

530
00:53:31,493 --> 00:53:32,533
It's gonna be fine.

531
00:53:35,533 --> 00:53:37,494
I hope you're right.

532
00:53:44,495 --> 00:53:45,654
They're bringing the big guns!

533
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:49,456
Ha! Game over. You're finished.

534
00:53:49,535 --> 00:53:52,696
If I were you, I'd cut my losses.
Surrender now and beg for mercy.

535
00:53:53,536 --> 00:53:56,696
- You're no match for SWAT.
- We'll just have to "swat" them...

536
00:53:57,536 --> 00:53:59,577
like the bugs they are.

537
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:03,537
They are entering the north,
south and east quadrants.

538
00:54:06,697 --> 00:54:08,658
- "B" squad.
- Go for B.

539
00:54:08,697 --> 00:54:10,578
You know what to do.

540
00:54:19,538 --> 00:54:21,539
You're wasting your time.

541
00:54:21,619 --> 00:54:23,499
Spinning your wheels...

542
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,460
swimming in circles,
going nowhere fast.

543
00:54:26,539 --> 00:54:28,500
- Ready?
- Give the word.

544
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,500
Fry them.

545
00:54:39,501 --> 00:54:42,461
When I get my hands on you, you...
You witch!

546
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:45,662
Save your strength, Dragon.
You're just wasting your time.

547
00:54:46,502 --> 00:54:48,702
Spinning your wheels,
swimming in circles...

548
00:54:49,502 --> 00:54:51,662
going nowhere fast.

549
00:54:56,503 --> 00:54:58,663

Emergency brakes engaged.

00:56:15,592 --> 00:56:16,592
Oh, no!

573
00:56:17,552 --> 00:56:19,513
No!

574
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:26,593
He's starting to bore me.
Get him out of my sight.

575
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,595
More attempts to stop me,
I release the safety harnesses...

576
00:56:34,634 --> 00:56:37,514
and presto! Instant pancakes.

577
00:56:37,715 --> 00:56:39,675
This is your last warning.

578
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:44,636
It's hopeless. It looks like
you're gonna have to pay.

579
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:47,675
I'm on my way to the bank.

580
00:56:59,557 --> 00:57:01,557
- Keep moving!
- Go on!

581
00:57:01,677 --> 00:57:03,638
- Get over there!
- Open those doors!

582
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:06,638
- Get back!
- Get out of the way!

583
00:57:07,478 --> 00:57:09,478
Head back, come on!

584
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,520
Turn around!

585
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:35,721
Hey, Dragon, I'll show you
the Way of the Closed Fist.

586
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:45,722
Why don't you do something?

587
00:57:46,522 --> 00:57:50,563
Are you really a hero, or
just a phony like my dad says?

588
00:57:52,563 --> 00:57:53,724
It's not that simple.

589
00:57:54,643 --> 00:57:56,684
These aren't much good against guns.

590
00:57:57,524 --> 00:57:58,684
I thought so.

591
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,565
What?! Oh, Auntie M...

592
00:58:06,645 --> 00:58:08,726
I mean, Aunt Medu...
I don't know what I mean.

593
00:58:09,526 --> 00:58:10,565
Where were the kids...

594
00:58:10,646 --> 00:58:12,526
while you were joy riding?

595
00:58:12,605 --> 00:58:14,686
Well, the thing is,
they kind of escaped.

596
00:58:15,686 --> 00:58:18,646
When I get ahold of you,
I'll have your heads!

597
00:58:22,647 --> 00:58:24,727
- How about a picture?
- You want a picture?

598
00:58:25,527 --> 00:58:27,687
No, you idiot! Not you, Medusa.

599
00:58:28,568 --> 00:58:29,688
- How you doing?
- Good.

600
00:58:30,528 --> 00:58:32,648
I'll take a picture of those two.

601
00:58:36,569 --> 00:58:37,569
Thank you.

602
00:58:40,609 --> 00:58:42,649
Pay the man. Let's go.

603
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,529
Where is he?

604
00:58:45,569 --> 00:58:47,608
Cheer up, there's plenty of fish
in the sea.

605
00:58:47,688 --> 00:58:50,647
Hey, no sweat.
I'll be your new boyfriend.

606
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,687
That'll cheer her right up.

607
00:58:53,606 --> 00:58:54,646
Yep, that's her.

608
00:58:54,726 --> 00:58:57,565
- Yes?
- I have a message from your boyfriend.

609
00:58:57,645 --> 00:58:59,605
- Samuel? Where is he?
- Come with me.

610
00:58:59,684 --> 00:59:02,724
Hey, butthead,
maybe I'm her new boyfriend!

611
00:59:10,561 --> 00:59:12,520
Bummer, man, you peed your pants.

612
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,640
Hey, where are they taking Jennifer?

613
00:59:17,598 --> 00:59:20,518
- Any luck with the rides?
- Am I glad to see you.

614
00:59:20,597 --> 00:59:23,476
Yeah, all except for
the last one on the list.

615
00:59:23,557 --> 00:59:25,636
She beat me to it. Come here.

616
00:59:28,635 --> 00:59:31,634
Any more tricks and she'll
drop them on their heads.

617
00:59:32,554 --> 00:59:33,714
Stop it! Let go of me!

618
00:59:36,553 --> 00:59:38,553
Somebody help me! Get off of me!

619
00:59:38,632 --> 00:59:40,472
What?

620
00:59:40,552 --> 00:59:41,671
Rocky, isn't that Jennifer?

621
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:43,670
I've gotta save her!

622
00:59:43,711 --> 00:59:45,550
- It's a trap!
- We're coming.

623
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:47,509
No, it's too dangerous.

624
00:59:48,509 --> 00:59:50,548
Stay with Amanda
in case the ninjas come.

625
00:59:50,589 --> 00:59:54,467
Rocky, if you don't come back,
can I have your Barry Bonds glove?

626
00:59:55,547 --> 00:59:56,666
I'll be back.

627
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:04,664
That ought to keep those
little monsters busy.

628
01:00:05,504 --> 01:00:07,663
Lothar, you know what to do.

629
01:00:59,527 --> 01:01:03,485
What the heck.
I'm out of a job next week anyway.

630
01:02:01,627 --> 01:02:03,506
Hey, Dave!

631
01:02:05,466 --> 01:02:06,466
Way to go.

632
01:02:09,505 --> 01:02:10,545
Come on, everybody!

633
01:02:40,535 --> 01:02:42,495
Jacobson's left with the money.

634
01:02:42,574 --> 01:02:46,493
And we got the park surrounded,
tracking devices in the bags...

635
01:02:46,573 --> 01:02:49,452
The minute the money's dropped,
we move in.

636
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:50,612
They can't escape.

637
01:02:51,452 --> 01:02:52,572
That's what worries me.

638
01:02:54,491 --> 01:02:55,571
Help!

639
01:02:56,411 --> 01:02:58,410
- I'm in here!
- Jennifer, I'm coming!

640
01:02:58,489 --> 01:02:59,649
Hurry!

641
01:03:01,648 --> 01:03:05,448
Never send a boy to do a man's job.

642
01:04:06,548 --> 01:04:09,547
Hurry! Get me out of here!

643
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:16,585
No more room to run, punk!

644
01:04:17,425 --> 01:04:19,505
Now it's just you and me.

645
01:04:26,503 --> 01:04:28,502
You can do it. Just don't look down.

646
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:32,500
Smell that, kid?
That's fear coming up behind you.

647
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:33,580
Look out!

648
01:04:48,535 --> 01:04:50,374
Oh, my God.

649
01:05:09,568 --> 01:05:11,408
Hurry!

650
01:05:28,403 --> 01:05:29,443
Yes!

651
01:05:30,602 --> 01:05:32,602
I'm alive!

652
01:05:40,439 --> 01:05:41,558
That little rodent!

653
01:05:43,478 --> 01:05:45,397
Thattaboy!

654
01:05:49,396 --> 01:05:50,556
Hurry, Samuel!

655
01:05:51,476 --> 01:05:53,435
Look, boss! The helicopter!

656
01:05:53,515 --> 01:05:55,514
Everybody pack up! We're leaving.

657
01:05:56,554 --> 01:05:59,553
I'll teach you
to pick a fight with me, Romeo.

658
01:06:00,513 --> 01:06:02,392
Hurry!

659
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:06,351
Emergency brakes released.
Emergency brakes released.

660
01:06:23,586 --> 01:06:25,425
Samuel...

661
01:06:25,505 --> 01:06:26,585
you saved me.

662
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:29,344
Call me Rocky.

663
01:06:35,462 --> 01:06:37,381
All right, move away, people!

664
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:43,340
Just look out! Get out of the way!

665
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:45,458
Everybody step back!

666
01:06:50,577 --> 01:06:53,497
Goodbye Andrew Jackson...

667
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:55,416
Honest Abe...

668
01:06:55,496 --> 01:06:57,495
Alexander Hamilton.

669
01:06:57,535 --> 01:06:59,454
I'll miss you most of all.

670
01:06:59,535 --> 01:07:01,374
Air to base, air to base.

671
01:07:01,414 --> 01:07:02,414
Base, over.

672
01:07:02,453 --> 01:07:04,373
The drop is a go.

673
01:07:04,573 --> 01:07:06,452
Your men ready?

674
01:07:07,412 --> 01:07:08,451
Move out!

675
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:14,370
Go, drop.

676
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:18,569
Come to Mama!

677
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:22,567
Get the money.

678
01:07:23,447 --> 01:07:24,526
Come on, my money.

679
01:07:25,566 --> 01:07:27,366
Come on, let's go.

680
01:07:27,405 --> 01:07:28,446
Let's move it!

681
01:07:29,365 --> 01:07:30,404
They got the money.

682
01:07:31,444 --> 01:07:33,364
More, more, more.

683
01:07:33,443 --> 01:07:36,363
- They've won.
- I got an idea.

684
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:38,483
Come on.

685
01:07:40,561 --> 01:07:43,320
- Get the money!
- The money.

686
01:07:49,439 --> 01:07:50,478
I got it!

687
01:08:05,554 --> 01:08:07,433
Let's go get Rocky!

688
01:08:26,347 --> 01:08:27,427
Oh, no! Oh!

689
01:08:28,426 --> 01:08:29,546
That's my...

690
01:08:30,465 --> 01:08:31,545
That's my money!

691
01:08:32,385 --> 01:08:33,385
That's my money!

692
01:08:34,464 --> 01:08:35,544
Get away from my money!

693
01:08:38,384 --> 01:08:39,463
Don't touch my money!

694
01:08:39,543 --> 01:08:41,462
My money!

695
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:48,340
- That's my money!
- That's her money!

696
01:08:51,379 --> 01:08:52,499
We got the other two bags!

697
01:08:53,339 --> 01:08:54,378
Let's get out of here.

698
01:09:05,295 --> 01:09:06,455
You're coming with me.

699
01:09:06,534 --> 01:09:08,454
Wait. Stop! Stop!

700
01:09:08,534 --> 01:09:10,533
Amanda! Amanda!

701
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:12,453
Rocky! TumTum!

702
01:09:12,533 --> 01:09:14,292
Colt!

703
01:09:18,411 --> 01:09:20,530
Rocky, they've got Amanda!

704
01:09:21,329 --> 01:09:22,490
Kids, over here!

705
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,410
Rocky, there's no time.
They're getting away!

706
01:09:28,412 --> 01:09:29,413
Come on!

707
01:09:30,413 --> 01:09:32,294
- Shut up!
- Let go of me!

708
01:09:32,414 --> 01:09:34,535
- Follow me this way. Come on!
- Let go of me!

709
01:09:35,335 --> 01:09:36,416
Lars, are you in position?

710
01:09:36,496 --> 01:09:38,297
Ready and waiting.

711
01:09:38,417 --> 01:09:39,418
Go! Go!

712
01:09:40,498 --> 01:09:42,499
- Whoa, kids.
- They got our friend.

713
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:46,381
Guess I can't talk you out of it.
You know what you're doing?

714
01:09:46,461 --> 01:09:47,502
- Respect.
- Courage.

715
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:49,503
- Trust!
- Honour!

716
01:09:50,343 --> 01:09:51,464
Teamwork!

717
01:09:57,467 --> 01:10:00,428
- Where'd they go?
- Over there!

718
01:10:05,431 --> 01:10:09,553
- What'll you do with her?
- She'll come in handy as a hostage.

719
01:10:12,435 --> 01:10:14,396
Let go of me!

720
01:10:14,556 --> 01:10:17,357
Then I'll make you
my personal slave...

721
01:10:17,397 --> 01:10:19,438
so you can work off
the money you cost me.

722
01:10:19,518 --> 01:10:22,320
I figure in about 50 years...

723
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:23,481
we'll be even.

724
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,442
You three get back to the ship. You!

725
01:10:29,523 --> 01:10:31,405
Allow me.

726
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:40,449
Yes! We got money!

727
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:42,411
We're rich! We're rich!

728
01:10:48,373 --> 01:10:50,414
I always did like fireworks.

729
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:52,495
There she is!

730
01:10:53,376 --> 01:10:54,457
How precious.

731
01:10:54,536 --> 01:10:57,378
The three little bears
and the big, bad wolf...

732
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:59,499
come to rescue Goldilocks.
Get them!

733
01:10:59,579 --> 01:11:03,341
You want a piece of me?
Come and get it!

734
01:11:19,389 --> 01:11:22,431
Bring it on!
One ninja stew, coming up!

735
01:11:25,432 --> 01:11:27,353
No stew for you.

736
01:11:38,519 --> 01:11:40,601
- He's out.
- Looks like we're on our own.

737
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:45,443
- I wish Grandpa were here with us.
- Grandpa gave this to me.

738
01:11:46,484 --> 01:11:48,484
"Where one goes, we all go."

739
01:11:49,565 --> 01:11:52,446
- Let's rock!
- Yeah!

740
01:11:58,530 --> 01:12:01,571
- I got your back.
- No, I got your back.

741
01:12:10,456 --> 01:12:12,377
Don't! Stop it!

742
01:12:12,456 --> 01:12:14,458
Don't! You're hurting me!

743
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,421
Where do you think you're going?

744
01:12:20,501 --> 01:12:21,541
Handcuffs.

745
01:12:23,622 --> 01:12:26,384
These ought to hold you for a while.

746
01:12:28,505 --> 01:12:31,467
I have a surprise for you.

747
01:14:22,564 --> 01:14:23,605
Yes!

748
01:15:10,669 --> 01:15:11,670
See you.

749
01:15:40,524 --> 01:15:41,645
Yes!

750
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,589
Later.

751
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:29,670
- All right!
- Yeah!

752
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,511
Yeah!

753
01:16:32,752 --> 01:16:35,673
You little runts!
It seems I misjudged you.

754
01:16:35,753 --> 01:16:38,755
Your training is far superior
to my warriors'.

755
01:16:39,555 --> 01:16:40,676
Why don't we even the odds?

756
01:16:55,524 --> 01:16:57,565
Use your night goggles, you fools!

757
01:17:35,704 --> 01:17:37,665
Nice surprise, huh?

758
01:17:42,628 --> 01:17:44,708
Rest in pieces.

759
01:18:06,761 --> 01:18:09,681
Colt! TumTum!

760
01:18:10,802 --> 01:18:12,763
Rocky!

761
01:18:23,729 --> 01:18:25,727
- Where are they?
- I can't see!

762
01:18:29,804 --> 01:18:33,560
When a ninja's head
swells with pride...

763
01:18:33,641 --> 01:18:35,719
he becomes his own worst enemy.

764
01:18:36,638 --> 01:18:38,556
He loses his focus...

765
01:18:38,636 --> 01:18:40,554
his spiritual balance.

766
01:18:40,634 --> 01:18:43,672
He has eyes but cannot see.

767
01:20:41,687 --> 01:20:43,566
Over here!

768
01:20:51,519 --> 01:20:52,677
Is that what I think it is?

769
01:20:53,476 --> 01:20:54,476
Grab my pack!

770
01:21:05,586 --> 01:21:06,624
No, my computer!

771
01:21:10,581 --> 01:21:12,499
Deactivate the timer.

772
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:15,577
My dad showed me how to do it
in his last movie.

773
01:21:18,534 --> 01:21:21,492
Shove the parallel cord
into the timer slot.

774
01:21:26,567 --> 01:21:29,644
Now, type in the words "run sequence."

775
01:21:31,483 --> 01:21:32,602
Insufficient power!

776
01:21:33,441 --> 01:21:36,518
The battery must need a recharge.
Try using the power cord.

777
01:21:40,474 --> 01:21:43,432
It's no good!
We need a three-prong outlet!

778
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:55,421
Save yourselves.

779
01:22:05,493 --> 01:22:06,532
Grab those tanks.

780
01:22:06,572 --> 01:22:09,370
- What?
- Trust me.

781
01:22:09,449 --> 01:22:12,367
TumTum, grab the tape and a hammer.

782
01:23:06,558 --> 01:23:08,317
You made it!

783
01:23:08,436 --> 01:23:10,475
Help me up, you idiots!

784
01:23:14,392 --> 01:23:16,430
One instant torpedo.

785
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:18,468
TumTum, hammer.

786
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:40,449
Let's get out of here!

787
01:23:48,442 --> 01:23:50,480
Adis, Mega Mountain!

788
01:23:54,436 --> 01:23:56,314
Jump!

789
01:24:29,365 --> 01:24:30,444
Freeze!

790
01:24:41,475 --> 01:24:43,273
It's come to our attention...

791
01:24:43,393 --> 01:24:47,350
these are the boys who foiled
the terrorists. Is this true?

792
01:24:47,469 --> 01:24:48,469
Kids!

793
01:24:49,428 --> 01:24:51,466
- Dad! Grandpa!
- How are you?

794
01:24:58,379 --> 01:25:01,297
You must be quite proud
of your heroes.

795
01:25:03,295 --> 01:25:05,253
If you want the real hero...

796
01:25:05,294 --> 01:25:06,413
He's over there.

797
01:25:07,291 --> 01:25:09,250
Dave Dragon!

798
01:25:24,317 --> 01:25:26,435
Sources tell us in lieu
of the day's events...

799
01:25:27,234 --> 01:25:29,392
the network may sign you
to a long-term contract.

800
01:25:30,232 --> 01:25:33,389
- Can you comment on that?
- I'm always happy to oblige my fans.

801
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,267
That's great news.

802
01:25:35,387 --> 01:25:39,223
Off the record, Dave,
I've always been a great fan.

803
01:25:39,263 --> 01:25:42,261
So, just another typical day
at the park, huh?

804
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:45,178
Yeah, pretty boring, I guess.

805
01:25:45,258 --> 01:25:47,336
We might need another
summer at ninja camp.

806
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:49,255
In case we get rusty.

807
01:25:49,295 --> 01:25:51,293
We might even have a new recruit.

808
01:25:53,211 --> 01:25:55,329
- Think you can handle it?
- Piece of cake.

809
01:25:55,409 --> 01:25:57,327
Speaking of cake...
