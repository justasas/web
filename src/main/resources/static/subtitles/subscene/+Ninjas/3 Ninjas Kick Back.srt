1
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,719
We spent last summer training
at our grandfather's cabin.

2
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,552
Grandpa wanted to give
us the ultimate test.

3
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,510
We just got too good for him.

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,069
-Your level is ninja daycare.
-No, yours is!

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,514
Grow up, you two.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,274
Grandpa said we still
had lots to learn.

7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,709
Come on!

8
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,155
Why'd you get in my way, Colt?
I had him.

9
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,915
You didn't even get near him, Tum Tum.

10
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,232
I did too. Didn't l, Rocky?

11
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,470
Looks like grandpa wins again.

12
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,070
Keep your eyes on the target.

13
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,119
Wipe all thoughts from your mind...

14
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,794
...and keep your energy focused
on the target.

15
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,112
Watch the bull's-eye grow in front
of your eyes.

16
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,470
And when it gets as big as a melon....

17
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,354
I want you to look within yourself.

18
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,115
And remember, all ninjas...

19
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,474
...heart...

20
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,479
...mind and body!

21
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,719
And spirit.

22
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,592
Now I've taught you all I know.

23
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,589
And it's time for you
to go and study...

24
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,638
...with a teacher far greater
than myself.

25
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,916
Japan, Japan, Japan!

26
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,673
We get to go to Japan?

27
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,155
All right. Quiet, quiet.

28
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,470
I must go next week...

29
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,077
...to my hometown in Koga.

30
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,278
And I have arranged for you...

31
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,274
...to come with me to study
with the Grand Master!

32
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,909
All right! Grand Master!

33
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,072
-I never knew that was there.
-That's the point.

34
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,675
Fifty years ago...

35
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,075
...I was just about your age.

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,671
I fought for the honour
of receiving this dagger.

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,315
There was a legend about the dagger
and a samurai sword.

38
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,319
They could open the door
to a cave of gold...

39
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,393
-...Iaden with riches!
-Like a key?

40
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,755
Exactly.

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,670
The old master told me
the whole legend...

42
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,675
...when the dagger was passed along.

43
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,476
Many believed the story.

44
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,150
Koga, the boy who I defeated...

45
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,872
... was one of them.

46
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,077
When he lost, he tried to steal
the dagger from me.

47
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,478
What happened to that kid
who tried to steal your dagger?

48
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,279
Who knows?

49
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,790
Just little boys playing
a long time ago. But now...

50
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,792
...I must take this dagger...

51
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,999
...and present it to the winner
of the Ninja Tournament.

52
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,470
What about the cave of gold, Grandpa?

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,314
Can we visit it when we go to Japan?

54
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,358
Weren't you listening, twerp?
You need the sword too.

55
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,953
-Bigger twerp.
-Biggest.

56
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,714
-Bigger-est.
-Boys, boys.

57
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,110
It's just a legend.

58
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,875
There is no cave of gold.
And the sword....

59
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,832
Who knows where it is?

60
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,512
I waited 50 years
for my revenge...

61
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,069
...Mori Shintaro.

62
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,637
Before you go to Japan...

63
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,073
...you will be tested
on the field of battle.

64
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,996
Now remember what I have taught you:

65
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,389
Control.

66
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,834
Restraint.

67
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,798
Concentration.

68
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,792
Unity.

69
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,270
Four strands of rope.

70
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,591
Now, separately you will snap.

71
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,469
But together you'll be strong.

72
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,877
Now get out there and kick butt!

73
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,478
All right. Get it up, son.

74
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,193
Michael, where are you?

75
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,080
Two, please.
One with the bun, one without.

76
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,595
-It's on me.
-Thanks.

77
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,752
-When does the ice cream guy get here?
-ln a half-hour.

78
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,268
Hi, Lisa DiMarino.

79
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,678
Bye, Lisa!

80
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,956
Don't they look adorable
in their uniforms?

81
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,715
Welcome to the league championship
playoffs.

82
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,670
This game will determine who goes home
proudly with the championship trophy:

83
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,472
The Dragons...

84
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,876
...or the Mustangs.

85
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,710
Play ball!

86
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,473
Batter up!

87
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,634
-Safe!
-Michael!

88
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,199
You're playing baseball!

89
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,670
Catch the ball, not the weenie!

90
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,354
Hey, come on, break it up. Back off.

91
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,033
Don't dig so deep. You'll only
be here for one more pitch.

92
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,595
Hey, batter!

93
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,592
Couldn't hit with a telephone pole.

94
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,434
Little Pony couldn't hit a full moon.

95
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,116
Rocky! Concentration!

96
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,195
Heart.

97
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,998
Mind.

98
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,878
Body.

99
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,875
Lisa?

100
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,996
You're home! Safe! Here's the ball.

101
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,959
Stepping up to the plate for the
Mustangs, number 11, Gerald Thomas.

102
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,757
He doesn't come alive very often.

103
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,675
But when he does, he really lets go.

104
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,789
It's a long drive.
It's back, back, back!

105
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,554
And it's out of here!
It's on the parkway!

106
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,509
At bat for the Dragons, number 14,
Jeffrey Douglas!

107
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,109
Batter's got time.

108
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,874
Remember the bull's-eye!

109
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,995
Time!

110
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,071
Get your shoe here, son.

111
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,869
Two down. Let's go.

112
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,271
Strength in restraint! Control!

113
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,068
Shall we play ball, boys?

114
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,868
Stop!

115
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,076
Don't do it, Jeffrey!

116
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,233
Scramble!

117
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,749
Thank you.

118
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,670
This is the most disgraceful display
I have ever seen in baseball history!

119
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,879
You're supposed to learn how to be
citizens and sportsmen, not hooligans!

120
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,591
I am suspending this game for one week
to give you a chance to cool down!

121
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,876
The game starts over next Sunday.

122
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,279
That is if, by then,
any of you decide to grow up!

123
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,478
We're not going to Japan.

124
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,669
What?

125
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,114
-I want to go.
-I want to play.

126
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,478
Stop it! "l want, I want."
What's the matter with you guys?

127
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,310
I was embarrassed and ashamed of your
behaviour, and you should be too.

128
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,997
How can I pay attention with Grandpa
pestering me from the stands?

129
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,151
-That's embarrassing.
-Enough.

130
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,314
Just what were you looking at
when you were supposed to be pitching?

131
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,154
Lisa DiMarino, Lisa DiMarino....

132
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,311
And Jeffrey, fighting like that.

133
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,391
What have I said about your temper?

134
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,312
You have to learn to control it.

135
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,869
Well, I wonder where he gets it from.

136
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,470
You see what this ninja stuff does?
All they want to do is fight.

137
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,757
Does this mean no Japan?

138
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,120
It may mean no to a lot of things
until all of you decide to grow up.

139
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,476
This sucks.

140
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,159
What are you doing dreaming
about Lisa DiMarino on the plate?

141
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,713
Four strands.

142
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,077
Hey! I didn't do that!
That was-- And Rocky!

143
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,550
I think the rope is unravelling.

144
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,676
One, two, three-- Three....

145
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,678
-Four!
-Four!

146
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,679
Who?

147
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,472
Stop!

148
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,476
Somebody pull the plug!

149
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,237
What's the name of your band?

150
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,835
-Tough Noogies.
-Alien Vomit.

151
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,036
Get behind the bar.

152
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,719
The rest of you clowns...

153
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,871
...get out of my club!

154
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,076
There's a phone call for you.

155
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,429
Thank you.

156
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,029
Hey, Uncle!

157
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,114
How's the weather in Japan?

158
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,874
My idiot nephew, forget the weather.

159
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,475
Did you get the pictures?

160
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,873
Oh, yeah.

161
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,388
Cool knife.

162
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,835
I will pay you well...

163
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,918
...to perform this task for me.

164
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,309
We'll take it!

165
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,471
The tickets are for Tokyo, Japan.

166
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,278
How many tickets, boys?

167
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,279
All right, huddle up.

168
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,476
It's Japan. How often do you get this
chance? Are you gonna throw it away?

169
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,911
What about the championship?
You want to throw that away?

170
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,276
-I want to go.
-Your vote doesn't count.

171
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,919
It does too.

172
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,549
You could pitch the winning game.

173
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,075
What do you think Lisa would think?

174
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,958
I can't wait all day.

175
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,795
We voted...

176
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,670
...we're gonna play baseball.

177
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,675
Just one ticket.
I'll come pick it up. Thanks.

178
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,038
I voted to go, Grandpa.

179
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,270
Thank you, Tum Tum, for wanting
to continue your ninja training.

180
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,798
Ninja? I really wanted to go there
to learn how to be a sumo wrestler.

181
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,317
You know how much those guys get
to eat every day?

182
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,279
Don't burn dinner, and clean
up the mess afterwards.

183
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,830
By the time you get back,
dinner will be on the table.

184
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,473
I think that's him.

185
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,078
The guy who we're
trying to steal this from.

186
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,675
No wonder your uncle's offering
20 grand.

187
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,193
He's gone.
That means the cabin's empty.

188
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,718
Rock 'n' roll!

189
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,389
Someone's coming.

190
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,635
Robbers.

191
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,673
Or maybe somebody's lost.

192
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,473
A ninja must always be prepared
for battle. Or to give directions.

193
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,552
We should also steal some VCRs....

194
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,076
-Directions?
-I don't think so.

195
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,437
Let's murder-lize them!

196
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,273
Let's see what we have here
for our guests.

197
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,318
Eggs, old pie....

198
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,278
Let me have a taste of it.

199
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,557
I'll keep watch, you two go in.

200
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,119
-I'll flatten you!
-Focus!

201
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,316
What are you hitting me for?

202
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,869
I gotta do all the work around here.

203
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,474
Piece of cake. Okay. On three.

204
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,473
Wait. Wait.
Is that the one after two?

205
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,275
One...

206
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,079
...two....

207
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,709
--three!

208
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,273
Get off of me!

209
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,275
Look, a desk!

210
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,674
If you were gonna hide
a letter opener...

211
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,077
...wouldn't you hide it in a desk?

212
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,073
I found it.

213
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,271
See? Let's go.

214
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,512
Were you hatched from a moron egg?

215
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,149
Does that look like this?
Get a better scent.

216
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,868
You sniff around down here.
I'll go upstairs.

217
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,879
Who's there?

218
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,954
Who's there?

219
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,192
How hard can it be
to find a little dagger?

220
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,675
Slam?

221
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,358
Slam, man. You find it?

222
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,710
-Lemon meringue.
-Banana cream, bozo!

223
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,678
Nice try.

224
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,429
Vinnie!

225
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,672
Come on, cheesehead!

226
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,749
Was that a yes?

227
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,275
I don't think the house is empty.

228
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,272
There's nobody here.

229
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,910
You're right.
There's somebody here.

230
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,917
I'm tired of playing with you--

231
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,071
That's it, you runts! You're mine!

232
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,995
Please, Mr. Man, don't hurt us.

233
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,468
Come on!

234
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,676
Get over here!

235
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,350
Who are you, teenage mutant wannabes?

236
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,830
We're the Three Ninjas!

237
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,678
-Let's go while we're still standing.
-I'm with that.

238
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,270
Out of my way, Slam. I'm out of here!

239
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,554
I'm working with idiots.

240
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,152
Oh, yeah? Come on. Try and get me.
Come on, come on.

241
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,395
Let's get him!

242
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,548
Watch the tree! Watch the tree!

243
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,199
Chickens.

244
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,715
Come on. Go, go, go.

245
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,678
-Vinnie!
-What are you doing?

246
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,356
Now, if I was a dagger,
where would I hi--?

247
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,679
Will you hurry?

248
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,909
I did it!

249
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,275
Come see us again!

250
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,509
I thought it was supposed to be empty.

251
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,315
It was supposed to be an easy job.

252
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,076
-Stop!
-Glam said it was empty.

253
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,474
We forgot Glam!

254
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,678
He's here. Drive!

255
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,200
-Wasn't that great?
-That was awesome.

256
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,113
I can't believe the oil trick
worked twice.

257
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,475
What?

258
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,272
I thought you'd have dinner ready.
What's this mess?

259
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,476
-Three guys--
-Tried to rob the cabin!

260
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,193
What did they want to rob?

261
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,876
-TVs and stuff. We heard them.
-But we got rid of them.

262
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,554
They finally gave up and ran away.

263
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,711
We used what you taught us.
We were great.

264
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,919
A true ninja never brags
about his skills.

265
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,072
The next time, call the police.

266
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,399
There were these...security guards.

267
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,198
-And....
-Watchdogs!

268
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,957
-I got close to it. I saw it.
-Do you have the dagger?

269
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,988
No, I don't have it. It's not like
it's exactly in my hands.

270
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,119
I want the dagger in my hands tomorrow.
Understand? Tomorrow!

271
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,796
Get the dagger and be at my office
here in Tokyo...

272
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,951
...or you will receive no pay.

273
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,073
Love you.

274
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,791
We're dropping Dad at the airport.

275
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,076
He's disappointed they aren't going.

276
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,279
Everything they need to know
they can learn from baseball, like me.

277
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,599
Don't forget your dad
was a kid once too.

278
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,673
I thought he was born full-grown
with a briefcase.

279
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,915
That's enough.

280
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,793
When I was a kid, I played
like a member of the team.

281
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,996
The way you'll play next week, right?

282
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,355
Michael, come on!

283
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,076
Hey! Who ate my Good & Plenty?

284
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,479
This should protect my bag.

285
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,029
Mousetrap.

286
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,869
I almost forgot
the most important thing.

287
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,278
They're taking the dagger.

288
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,476
Wait, wait, wait.

289
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,276
-Which bags are yours?
-The one without the sticker.

290
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,074
Which one?

291
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,155
Oh, here it is.

292
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,516
Goodbye. Wish you
were coming with me.

293
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,955
Me too, Grandpa.

294
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,675
There he goes!

295
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,436
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye, Grandpa.

296
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,152
Vacation time!

297
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,155
This is terrible. I'm so sorry.
I'm just a stupid American.

298
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,276
Very sorry. Sorry, sir. Sorry.

299
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,476
Get in! Get in! Get in!

300
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,793
Greetings, Uncle!

301
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,077
I was expecting you earlier.
Don't touch me!

302
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,029
Uncle, we did your bidding,
and we got the goods right here.

303
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,589
-Quiet, fool.
-Quiet, fool.

304
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,394
-Give it to me!
-Give it to him!

305
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,471
Hey, nice vase.

306
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,916
Behold! The dagger of doom.

307
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,800
-I can explain this.
-You have failed!

308
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,476
Ishikawa! Show them
how we deal with fools!

309
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,110
Hey, that's our lead singer, you!

310
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,874
We can do instrumentals.
We don't need lyrics.

311
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,870
Can we talk about this?

312
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,833
Nephew, I am much dissatisfied.

313
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,958
But I am prepared to give you...

314
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,997
...another chance.

315
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,279
You say Mori Shintaro is in Japan.

316
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,397
Keep an eye on him.

317
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,835
Listen to every word he says.

318
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,548
And bring back that dagger to me!

319
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,510
My fortune says,
"Love appears on a journey."

320
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,153
You blew that one for us.

321
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,277
-You voted to stay too.
-I know.

322
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,072
But I wish I hadn't.

323
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,550
Besides, all love fortunes
are for Rocky.

324
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,075
That means you got mine.
What's it say?

325
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,591
Put them on. Grandpa says you
make it worse when you squint.

326
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,071
Put them on, Rocky.
We won't make fun of you.

327
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,916
The four-eyed beast!

328
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,431
Mine says I have an insect for a
brother, and I should squash him!

329
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,073
Help me!

330
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,514
-He's right.
-Yeah.

331
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,716
You do look like a four-eyed beast.

332
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,871
Only I can call my brother that.

333
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,750
What do you call him? My Little Pony?

334
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,752
Kick their butts, Colt.

335
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,195
I'd love to see you try. Come on.

336
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,079
Let's go. Let's go inside.

337
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,471
-Now!
-You're not my boss.

338
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,272
I said, now!

339
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,399
Yeah, go inside. The Strike Out Kid.

340
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,159
See you Sunday, Dragons!

341
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,270
You're acting like Grandpa.

342
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,277
You should have murder-lized them.

343
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,756
You made me look like a wimp
in front of those guys.

344
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,473
Chill, it's Grandpa.

345
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,757
Well, hello, boys! I'm all right.

346
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,393
I'm in a hospital.

347
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,349
What's wrong?

348
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,674
Oh, I was in a tiny car accident.
A few bruises.

349
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,071
I'm at the mercy of a nurse
that doesn't speak English.

350
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,471
Actually, she's a witch
posing as a nurse.

351
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,074
Do you mind?
I'm talking to my grandson.

352
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,196
I had all my luggage stolen.

353
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,477
They took everything.
Even the dagger.

354
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,789
They stole the dagger.

355
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,917
You vampire!

356
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,631
I saw this weird Japanese guy
with long, white hair running away.

357
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,394
-Don't tell your mom and dad.
-We won't.

358
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,031
I'm in Tokyo General.
Oh, it's a fine hospital.

359
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,070
Except for this wicked nurse
with a face like a dragon's butt.

360
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,350
Some people here do understand
English, Mr. Shintaro!

361
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,193
Hope you feel better soon. Bye.

362
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,635
-Who hit him?
-A Japanese guy with white hair.

363
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,075
Like the jerko at the cabin?

364
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,871
-Oh, no!
-Those guys are in Japan!

365
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,914
This isn't my bag.
This is Grandpa's bag. Look.

366
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,388
They were after the dagger.

367
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,279
We gotta go there.
We gotta help Grandpa.

368
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,511
What about the baseball game?

369
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,469
-That's a game. This is Grandpa.
-But where are my Ding Dongs?

370
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,598
Forget your Ding Dongs.
We gotta work fast.

371
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,308
First, I'll take care of the tickets.

372
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,193
Okay, so that's three
children's fares to Tokyo.

373
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,352
-We're almost grown-up.
-The name on the card?

374
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,790
Mori Shintaro. He's my grandfather.

375
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,514
We'll need his authorization.
Can I talk to him?

376
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,317
Sure. Colt, do you have Grandpa's
message from the answering machine?

377
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,509
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Shintaro? How are you?

378
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,352
I'm all right.

379
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,157
That's nice. I just took
a reservation from--

380
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,994
-My grandson.
-Yes, that's what he said.

381
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,549
Three seats this afternoon to....

382
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,279
-Tokyo.
-Yes!

383
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,956
I have your authorization for three
first-class children's tickets...

384
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,789
...to Tokyo, totalling $1 1,364?

385
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,634
I'm sorry?
Is this amount okay with you?

386
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,557
-Yes, everything, you vampire!
-Really, sir! I don't set the prices.

387
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,433
I just work here.
I'll run this through.

388
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,148
They can pick
the tickets up at the airport.

389
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,353
Ugly witch.

390
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,357
Yeah? Well, you know what you are?

391
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,959
Goodbye.

392
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,431
All right, we got a lot to do.

393
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,477
I'll write a note to Mom and Dad.

394
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,476
Colt, find money,
and, Tum Tum, call a shuttle.

395
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,874
We'll be packed on time.

396
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,469
How will we do all that
before Mom and Dad get home?

397
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,356
You've heard of ingenuity, right?
Well, this is "ninja-nuity."

398
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,790
-Tum Tum!
-I don't want to leave Mom and Dad.

399
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,151
Tum Tum, it's for Grandpa.

400
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,670
Happy?

401
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,599
-How fast can you get us to LAX?
-Buckle up.

402
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,348
Colt?

403
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,553
Tum Tum?

404
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,549
Rocky?

405
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,031
It's okay. We'll stick together.

406
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,556
Rocky, catch.

407
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,752
You're out!

408
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,790
She thank you. Want to repay you.

409
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,952
Could you take us
to Tokyo General Hospital?

410
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,958
She want to know, are you sick?

411
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,555
We're fine.
But our grandpa's there.

412
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,315
-Mori Shintaro. Do you know him?
-No, but it will be our pleasure.

413
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,592
Can't you do that more gently?

414
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,355
Really, Mr. Shintaro! My grandkids
behave better than you do.

415
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,309
My grandchildren can drive you
out of town with their ninja sticks.

416
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,990
-He's right! We could!
-That's right, Tum Tum....

417
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,356
Boys! What are you doing here?

418
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,558
Grandpa, we missed you!

419
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,951
Nurse Hino, these are my three ninjas!

420
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,794
Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum.

421
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,753
Would you get that--?
Get out of here!

422
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,478
Well, boys. Colt, what
about the baseball game?

423
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,950
You're more important, Grandpa.

424
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,953
-We think you're in danger.
-What kind of danger?

425
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,675
You know the Japanese guy with
the white hair who stole your luggage?

426
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,797
He tried to rob the cabin.

427
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,836
How do you know?

428
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,356
Did he look like he was trying
to be a grunge-rock stud?

429
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,672
-The guy with the ugly white hair.
-The troll hair!

430
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,797
You know, a real wannabe type.

431
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,359
Oh, yeah.

432
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,553
Will you shut up, please?

433
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,871
I think they were after the dagger.

434
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,358
Well, they have it now.

435
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,069
-Rocky, how?
-You took Tum Tum's bag by mistake.

436
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,998
And they got my Ding Dongs.

437
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,790
Did you hear that?
Those kids got it!

438
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,959
So you came all this way because
you thought I needed your help.

439
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,991
What'd you tell your parents?

440
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,709
Well....

441
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,589
Oh, no.

442
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,995
We left them a note.

443
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,877
We have to call them
and tell them what's going on.

444
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,038
Meanwhile, we'd better make plans
about the dagger.

445
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,912
Hello, Jessica!

446
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,315
How's everything? How's the weather?

447
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,159
She's pissed.

448
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,669
Hi, Mom.

449
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,636
Jessica, it's not their fault.
I missed them and I sent for them.

450
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,319
Here, you talk to Tum Tum.

451
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,036
Hi, Mom. No.

452
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,719
Hey, boys.

453
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,790
The tournament is going on
right now in Koga.

454
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,951
I want you to take this dagger...

455
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,158
...and present it to the winner
of the competition.

456
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,829
-What about you?
-I'll meet you in Koga.

457
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,837
What? Oh, Ma.

458
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,873
Now do this for me.
Set the beeper on your watch.

459
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,112
Call us every day
at 2 p.m., Tokyo time.

460
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,596
Okay, Mom, okay, got it. 2 p.m.

461
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,273
Mom wants to say goodbye!

462
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,395
-Bye.
-Bye, Mom.

463
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,554
Nurse Hino, I thought I told you
to go away!

464
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,191
Do you know how I deal
with troublesome patients?

465
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,515
Nurse Hino, can I make a deal
with you?

466
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,749
I'll let you use me
as a pin cushion...

467
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,919
...if you see to it that my boys
get on the train to Koga.

468
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,599
I'll be glad to help.

469
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,276
-It's the end of my shift anyway.
-Thank God.

470
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,790
Nurse Shibuya will be taking my place.

471
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,238
I hope we make it there in time.

472
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,994
-I hope we see some great ninjas.
-I hope there's food.

473
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,194
Is this what Grandpa
wanted us to learn?

474
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,749
The next level of screaming?

475
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,595
This guy's good.

476
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,468
I could take him.

477
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,714
Hey, Colt. If number 16 wins this
one, he'll be in the finals.

478
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,913
I'll be right back.

479
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,112
Hey, that guy's not bad.

480
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,399
He's kind of wild, like Colt.

481
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,469
Colt!

482
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,039
Come on, he'll get his
brains splattered.

483
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,078
Stay here. Maybe it's the lesson
Grandpa had in mind.

484
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,236
Yes!

485
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,030
Ow!

486
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,549
A girl?

487
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,358
A girl?

488
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,430
A girl?

489
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,591
I'm such a spaz.

490
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,998
Rocky?

491
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,118
If she's the winner,
does that mean we give her this?

492
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,515
Let's go ask Mr. Big over there.

493
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,238
I'm sorry, you're going too fast.

494
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,711
Perhaps I can help.
I speak some English.

495
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,111
Tell him we bring this
from our grandfather, Mori Shintaro.

496
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,710
Whoa! Look at those feet!

497
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,233
He say he know everything. He spoke
with your grandfather from Tokyo.

498
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,556
Bet he's ticklish.

499
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,150
He says ceremony can wait a few
days, until Mori Shintaro arrive.

500
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,118
We must uphold the tradition.

501
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,352
What shall we do with this?

502
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,029
Grand Master say if your grandfather
trusted you with it, so does he.

503
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,519
Colt got beat by a girl!
Colt got beat by a girl!

504
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,312
Colt got beat by a girl!

505
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,755
-I'm still better than you.
-Shut up, spaz!

506
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,150
You are worthy opponent, Spaz.

507
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,358
Oh, no. It's Colt.
This is Rocky and Tum Tum.

508
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,160
I am Miyo. This is my mother.

509
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,430
I would love to hear about America.
You live near Bart Simpson?

510
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,910
-No.
-Were do you stay in Koga?

511
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,718
We didn't plan anything.

512
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,791
Then you come home with us.

513
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,273
We'd be honoured. But we must hurry.
One more important place to go.

514
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,519
Every year she is the only girl
to try out.

515
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,673
Hey, who lives in that castle over
there? The evil umpire?

516
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,510
Castle Hikone. No one live there.
Very, very old.

517
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,312
-Maybe she should stick to ninja.
-Shut up.

518
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,438
He tell me to come back
when I learn to catch.

519
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,389
He say because of ninja I am
good at swinging butt.

520
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,470
What?

521
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,392
You know, swing my butt.

522
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,073
You mean your "bat."

523
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,072
Yes. My butt.

524
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:37,031
Hey, I got an idea.

525
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,317
-You teach us ninja.
-And we'll teach you baseball.

526
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,469
Yes!

527
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,871
Grand Master's house. Run!

528
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,990
-Greetings, Uncle!
-Where have you been?

529
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,869
Doing your bidding, my dearest blood
of my blood. Listen to this.

530
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,309
Rock 'n' roll!

531
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,915
Stop! Why are you wasting my time?

532
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,277
Relax, san. What's the big deal?
Wrong tape.

533
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,475
Here, go on.

534
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,193
Just a second.

535
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,119
The tournament is going on
right now in Koga.

536
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,158
So I want you to take this dagger
and present it...

537
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,399
-... to the winner of the competition.
-That is his plan.

538
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,872
Return the dagger to the Grand Master.

539
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,639
Perfection.

540
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,348
I will be ready for him.

541
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,313
Ishikawa, prepare for our journey.

542
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,112
What about our dough?

543
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,392
I asked for a dagger,
you bring me a tape.

544
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,675
Two tapes.

545
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,319
No payment!

546
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,797
You have failed me.
Take care of them!

547
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,918
This is great. Rocky...

548
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,515
...tell Miyo's mother how
good this is.

549
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,597
-Thank you.
-We know my brother's a picky eater.

550
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,950
Your Japanese is getting good, Rocky.

551
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,720
You should say something
to the Grand Master.

552
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,871
Like, "Clip your toenails."

553
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,954
I have an idea to help.
Come, I will show you.

554
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,912
This book helps me learn
your language.

555
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:10,155
See?

556
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,799
I don't read Japanese.
You can teach me a few words.

557
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,714
No, it's half in English.
Don't you see?

558
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,476
Well, why don't you just read it
to me? You're better at this.

559
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,113
Just go ahead. Just sound it out.

560
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,639
"Hello."

561
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,318
"Nice to meet you."

562
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,512
"Nice to meet you."

563
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,553
"Nice to meet you."

564
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,475
Ow!

565
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,432
Rocky loves Miyo!

566
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,996
Rocky loves Miyo!
Rocky loves Miyo!

567
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,754
Grand Master say he will start
your training today too.

568
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,709
We're ready for him.
You were a great help, Miyo.

569
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,150
I wish I could go with you.

570
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,952
-Well, good luck.
-Thanks.

571
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,475
We'll do great. See you later.

572
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,559
-Bye, Miyo!
-Bye, Miyo!

573
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,351
Bye, Miyo. My little chicken pot pie.

574
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,318
So...

575
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,275
...you are the grandsons
of Mori Shintaro.

576
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,354
Hey, how come you didn't speak English
to us at the tournament?

577
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,760
In front of the other people?

578
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,788
They would not understand us.
It would be rude.

579
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,512
Did you bring the dagger
your grandfather gave you?

580
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,310
I thought you wanted to wait
till he arrived.

581
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,955
I changed my mind.

582
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,155
I want it now.

583
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,909
Weren't you shorter the other day?

584
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,075
Rocky! Colt! Tum Tum!

585
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,229
He's a fake!

586
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,719
Scramble!

587
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,398
You gonna talk us to death?

588
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,511
Oh, no. Mom!

589
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,755
Rocky!

590
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,353
-Give me the phone!
-Sure.

591
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,713
Catch.

592
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,437
It's about time. You're late.

593
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,238
Hey, Mom. It's me.

594
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,310
What's going on?

595
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,276
Not much.

596
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,231
You know, it's just
a small town in Japan.

597
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,160
Colt, Mom wants to talk to you.

598
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,719
Coming down!

599
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,558
Hi, Mom. Dad!

600
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,314
I thought there wasn't gonna
be any ninja stuff.

601
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,597
We're not. We're seeing
the sights and meeting the people.

602
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,276
When you get home, we're having
a long talk about responsibility.

603
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,839
Fine. I'll set aside a month.

604
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,069
Don't be a smart kid.

605
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,596
I'm not being a smart kid.
Rocky wants to talk to you.

606
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,639
Hi, Dad. The noise? What noise?

607
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,871
It's the TV. It's a kung fu movie.

608
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,394
Tum Tum, turn it down!

609
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,874
Hang on a sec.

610
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,836
Grandpa? He's out fishing
with friends.

611
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,514
Yeah, gotta go. Bye.

612
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,675
Come on, Rocky!

613
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,148
Rocky!

614
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,712
All right, Miyo!

615
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,997
Where have you guys been?

616
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,639
So that's where you were?

617
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,509
Quickly, but be careful.

618
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,669
This way, secret passageway
to outside.

619
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,072
You said this was a secret.

620
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,671
This is my ninja compound.
My army trains here.

621
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,676
Don't even think of escaping.

622
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,958
Let me go, you big hairy ape!

623
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,109
Did I say ape? Forget it.

624
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,555
It's not fair to the other apes.

625
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,993
I just knew it was a bad idea
coming to Japan.

626
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,835
What? You voted for it
in the first place.

627
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,516
I just wish I was home.

628
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,876
I want to see Mom and Dad.

629
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,231
I want to be in my own house.

630
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,036
I want to eat a real cheeseburger
with real cheese.

631
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:00,232
I knew this would come to food.

632
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,390
What is a ninja?

633
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,030
Rocky, stop being like Grandpa.

634
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,349
What is a ninja?

635
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,239
A body. A spirit. A mind.

636
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,434
Tum Tum?

637
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,195
A heart.

638
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,992
Pretty quiet around here without
the team, huh, coach?

639
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,674
They don't even seem to care
what I think anymore.

640
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,158
They listen to their Grandpa
more than me.

641
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,518
They listen to their Grandpa because
their Grandpa listens to them.

642
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,712
I wish they could behave more like....

643
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,952
-Like what? Like you?
-Yeah.

644
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,553
They can't. They're not you.

645
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,997
They're Samuel and Jeffrey
and Michael.

646
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,515
-No, they're not.
-They're not?

647
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,154
They're Rocky and Colt and Tum Tum.

648
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,670
-I just wish they'd come home.
-Yeah.

649
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,548
I will give you one last chance.

650
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,429
I have the dagger and the samurai
sword, but they tell me nothing.

651
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,549
Only one man knows their secret...

652
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,518
...and that is Mori Shintaro.

653
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,276
Are you capable of kidnapping
an old man?

654
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:47,640
-Uncle.
-A hospitalized old man?

655
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,159
I've a marvellous idea.

656
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,438
This is stupid. I feel ridiculous.

657
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,113
Quiet, you.

658
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,914
The phone was ringing.
I thought it was for me.

659
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,913
Straighten up.

660
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,953
Good day, ladies. Hello.

661
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,388
Hello.

662
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,553
-That was him!
-That was him?

663
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,358
Yo, sir! Excuse me, we have--

664
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,555
-Yes?
-Your therapy.

665
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,552
I had my physical therapy today.

666
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,950
-I don't mean therapy.
-We're discharging you.

667
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,878
Oh, I see.

668
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,238
I never saw you lovely
young ladies before.

669
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,278
Oh, that's because we've
been on holiday.

670
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,677
I'm getting tired of this!

671
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,836
You're on the wrong floor, girls.

672
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,752
Mine!

673
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,035
Bye, girls.

674
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,109
Oh, my leg, my foot, my ankle!
Oh, Vinnie!

675
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,912
Say something! What kind of
leader are you?

676
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,236
-Surgery preparation.
-Yeah, surgery.

677
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,708
Vinnie! Glam!

678
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,354
No surgery, we're fine! We're fine!

679
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,313
Why have you brought me here?

680
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,154
Why have you put me in
these clothes? Why?

681
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,913
Leave us.

682
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,952
Who are you?

683
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,556
A boy from your childhood.

684
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,079
Koga!

685
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,029
-Boys!
-Grandpa!

686
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,829
Are you all right?

687
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:17,990
We're okay, Grandpa.

688
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,037
What about you?
Are they hurting you?

689
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,475
Grandpa, get us out of here.
Please?

690
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,950
I'll try my best.

691
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,679
Who's in there with you?

692
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,876
Rocky's girlfriend.

693
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,712
She's not my girlfriend.
Well, I mean....

694
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,952
Remember: four strands of rope.

695
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,634
The cave. Where is the cave?

696
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,271
According to legend...

697
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:47,758
...the cave is beneath Castle Hikone.

698
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,958
The dagger. The dagger.

699
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,714
The sword and the dagger are the keys.

700
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,717
Now let my grandchildren go!

701
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:01,032
You have someplace else to go first.
Castle Hikone.

702
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,910
A ninja must use everything around him
to his advantage.

703
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,754
But there's nothing here we can use.

704
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,558
I still have a ninja ball.

705
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,711
I don't even
have my jellybeans anymore.

706
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,111
Forget it. There's no way to escape.

707
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,117
We don't have to.

708
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,068
We just have to
make it look like we did.

709
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,273
Don't you just hate us?

710
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,710
They must be on their way
to Castle Hikone.

711
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,439
-My bag!
-Where's that?

712
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,954
I know where it is.

713
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,596
-What do we do?
-Let's kick their butts!

714
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,838
-Light up their eyes!
-Let's light these fat boys up.

715
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:37,631
Colt! Get him off me!

716
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,792
Colt! Get him off me!

717
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,075
How are we gonna get there?

718
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,992
On the wings of eagles.

719
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,516
I don't want to fly!

720
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,555
Come on! It's just like
a roller coaster.

721
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,758
I hate roller coasters!

722
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,591
I want to go down!

723
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,832
The entrance is down an old well.

724
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,159
Over there.

725
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,157
Ah, here it is!

726
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:59,913
Watch where you're going!

727
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,229
I am watching.

728
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,914
-Look out for that tree!
-What tree?

729
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:10,874
There's the door.

730
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,953
The sword.

731
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,593
The dagger!

732
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:54,549
The gate to my cave of gold.

733
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:06,319
Ishikawa, wait here.

734
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,914
Look! The dagger and the sword.

735
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,992
-Maybe you should leave it there.
-No, we might need it.

736
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,519
I don't like the look of this place.

737
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,159
It's sealed shut.

738
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,794
Nice job, spaz.

739
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,359
What is this place?

740
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,351
It's creepy, that's what it is.

741
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,072
Four strands of rope.

742
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,352
These are ancient samurai warriors!

743
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,994
Your riches are nothing
but skulls and bones!

744
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,872
You're chasing fairy tales...

745
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,595
...and I'm not gonna be
buried here for your greed!

746
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,798
There is no cave of gold.

747
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,991
No!

748
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,795
A fairy tale?

749
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,792
It is a cave of gold!

750
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,432
The legend was true!

751
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,592
Yes. It is true.

752
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,594
I-- I beg of you.

753
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,310
The brave warrior,
begging for his life.

754
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,670
Goodbye, Mori Shintaro.

755
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,999
I beat you once, Koga.

756
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,119
That was a long time ago, Grandpa.

757
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,993
Behind you!

758
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,191
Excuse me, Mr. Man.

759
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,234
This way!

760
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,196
Colt!

761
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:33,999
We're coming!

762
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,355
I will win, because you
are controlled by your greed!

763
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,719
-Don't move.
-Fifty years ago...

764
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,997
...I accidentally scarred your face.

765
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:18,796
What has happened to your soul,
that I truly regret.

766
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,598
No more talking.

767
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,116
Your fate is to be buried here.

768
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,519
Let's go!

769
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,594
You mean, "Scramble!"

770
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,512
Koga, it's not worth it.

771
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,835
Come with me.

772
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,353
Come on!

773
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,999
Tum Tum, watch out behind you.
Here comes the bag.

774
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,754
-Hurry up!
-Come on!

775
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,598
I'm trying!

776
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,191
I want to find it!

777
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,595
-Please!
-Tum Tum!

778
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,597
I found it!

779
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,792
-Let's go!
-Hurry!

780
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:36,789
-Go!
-Please hurry!

781
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,594
I found my Ding Dongs.

782
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:17,998
A true ninja is free from all desire.

783
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:22,194
It took me a long time
to understand that, Mori Shintaro.

784
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,396
From our days in Koga...

785
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:25,995
...until this moment.

786
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,759
Slow learner.

787
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,634
You are all very brave ninjas.
All of you.

788
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,952
Grandpa, this is Miyo.
Champion of the Koga Dojo.

789
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,037
You? A young lady?

790
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:04,116
As this was presented to me
by a ninja master...

791
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,199
...I pass this to you.

792
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,396
You have achieved...

793
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:15,189
...ninja level at the
highest mastery of mind....

794
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,078
-Body.
-Spirit.

795
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:19,269
And heart.

796
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:23,398
Keep this dagger...

797
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:27,389
...till the day you will present it...

798
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,079
...to a young ninja.

799
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,319
This is better
than winning World Cereals.

800
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,116
I think you mean "Series."

801
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,596
What I said, "Cereals."

802
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,795
It's too bad we missed our game.

803
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,956
I thought it wasn't till Sunday.

804
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,754
-lt is Sunday.
-Not in America. It's Saturday.

805
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,235
-lf we catch a plane today....
-We can make it!

806
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:54,836
What are you gonna do?
You can't play with only six players.

807
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:59,477
-The rest of them are off on vacation.
-What are you gonna do?

808
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:02,396
I guess we have no choice.

809
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,193
I forfeit.

810
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:07,069
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry to say...

811
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,278
...due to a shortage of players,
the Dragons have announced--

812
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,709
Play ball!

813
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,832
Oh, this is great timing!

814
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,514
This is great. Let's play ball, huh?

815
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,795
You heard him!

816
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,037
Play ball!

817
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:31,589
-I missed you so much.
-And the boys.

818
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,672
The big question on our mind is:

819
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,633
Will this be a baseball game
or a wrestling match?

820
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,991
-Out!
-Two down, everybody.

821
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:52,875
Dragons down by one.

822
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:56,038
Two strikes, runners at
second and third. Here we go.

823
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,754
Come on, Colt! Bring me home!

824
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,590
Thanks for the
air-conditioning, horsy.

825
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,955
Now batting, number 10,
Gerald Thomas.

826
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,995
It's a bloop single to left.
Runner digging for third base.

827
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,758
That's hitting below the belt.

828
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,191
I hope the Mustangs won't turn
this into a wrestling match.

829
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:41,838
Replacing number 25
for the Dragons is number 21.

830
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,274
That player doesn't seem
to be on the roster.

831
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,350
Top of the 7th, Mustangs up 4 to 2.

832
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,792
Bases are loaded, they have a chance
to blow it wide open. And the pitch.

833
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,991
Long drive, deep centre field.

834
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,919
The centre fielder going back,
back to the wall.

835
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,754
Leaping!

836
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,279
A great catch!

837
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,833
By a girl!

838
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,434
Great! That was a great catch.

839
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,193
Everybody gather around.

840
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,273
All right, listen up.
It's our last three at bat.

841
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,392
Let's just go out there
and do our best, all right?

842
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,192
-All right.
-Okay!

843
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,590
Boys, come here.

844
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,791
Look, win or lose...

845
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,031
...I just wanted to tell you...

846
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,476
...that I'm really very proud of you.

847
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:42,750
You're real sportsmen out there.

848
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:46,438
You see? You learn
about life through baseball.

849
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,792
With a little bit
of ninja thrown in, huh?

850
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,510
I'm really glad to have you home, men.

851
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:01,999
Dad?

852
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,828
Four strands of rope.

853
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,033
Four strands of rope.

854
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,359
Let's murder-lize them!

855
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,549
Yeah!

856
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,632
Bottom of the 7th. Last chance.

857
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:22,396
The Dragons need three runs
to win this championship.

858
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,949
Strike!

859
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,354
Goes to bunt.

860
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,193
Swings away!

861
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,597
Whoa, almost hit
the third baseman's head off!

862
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,076
-A base hit.
-Come on, Rocky!

863
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,593
All right, Colt!

864
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,996
Hey, Strikeout Kid!

865
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,311
Come on, ninja-nuity!

866
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,511
All right, Colt! You can hit now!

867
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:06,109
Come on, horsy.
Bet you can't hit this one.

868
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,193
Come on, Darren!

869
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,228
Strike!

870
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,397
And another one!

871
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:26,190
Two strikes, two outs. One more strike
and the Mustangs win the championship.

872
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,838
And the pitch.

873
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:39,794
It's a long drive,
deep left field. Way back!

874
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,598
Way back!

875
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,793
Dragons could win the championship!
It's headed towards the foul pole.

876
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,195
Twisting, turning, spinning.

877
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:52,315
-Foul ball!
-Oh, no!

878
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,997
It's a foul ball! A foul ball.

879
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:22,113
Colt.

880
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,794
Here. Use my butt.

881
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,794
I carved my name for luck,
strength and control.

882
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,198
Ninja-nuity.

883
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,829
Come on, son! Come on, you can do it!

884
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:36,708
Go get them!

885
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:40,037
Long foul ball. Bet you can't
hit it again, loser.

886
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:41,593
Batter up!

887
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:55,590
Throw at this batter one more time,
you're gonna forfeit the game, coach.

888
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,193
Play ball!

889
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:12,789
Watch the bull's-eye grow
in front of your eyes.

890
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,795
And when it gets as big as a melon....

891
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:56,351
The Dragons win the league
championship! The Dragons win!

892
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,316
This game ain't over yet.
Extra innings in the parking lot.

893
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:54,754
Come on, fellas.

894
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:57,674
You'll show them
when you get back to Koga.

895
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,953
Yes. I tell them how I kicked bat.

896
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:08,189
I think you mean-- Oh, never mind.

897
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,791
You won the first round,
but the game ain't over yet.

898
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:17,555
I can handle it.

899
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,793
Tell you what. One on one.

900
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,276
Your best guy. You can pick
any one of us to fight against.

901
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,599
Okay.

902
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,109
I pick you.

903
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,318
You ruined my home run, girl.

904
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,954
Oh, come on. She's just a girl.

905
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:35,909
Hey, you play on a guys' team,
you play by guys' rules.

906
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:39,795
She's just visiting.
Pick me. I'll fight you.

907
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:41,793
Come here.

908
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,834
Well, I tried.

909
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,838
I said, come here!

910
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,076
What? Where'd she go?

911
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:05,992
I hope there's more food
in our next adventure.

912
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,590
See you next time. Bye!

913
