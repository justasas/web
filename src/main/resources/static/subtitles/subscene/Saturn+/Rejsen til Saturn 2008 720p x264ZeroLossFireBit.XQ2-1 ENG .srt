Dear Denmark. Dear Danes.

In less than 24 hours,

4
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,539
the greatest event in our
history will take place:

5
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,764
Kurt Maj's Saturn Expedition!

6
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:04,989
The purpose is to find
eco-friendly energy resources

8
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:09,826
that will benefit people on Earth
and the Danish welfare state.

10
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:13,398
We transmit live from Cape Kurt.

11
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:19,351
But let's have a closer look at
the project's creator: Kurt Maj!

13
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:24,996
<i>Tycoon and media kingpin, Kurt Maj,
is a man of many talents.</i>

15
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:28,758
<i>Deeply affected by the rapidly
escalating global warming,</i>

17
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:33,865
<i>Kurt Mej has made it  his personal
cause to fight for the environment.</i>

19
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:39,394
<i>And now, always the pioneer,
he's on his way to the stars!</i>

21
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,427
You're on in ten minutes, Per.

22
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,689
How's the suit?

23
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:51,396
Well, it's not as cool as the one

24
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:53,680
I wore for NASA's Mars Mission.

25
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:56,091
But then again,
I'm not exactly going

26
00:02:56,103 --> 00:02:57,828
on a 48 hour space walk, am I?

27
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:02,245
You're so cool, Per.

- Mr. Maj, over here!
- Showtime!

42
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,489
Dear Denmark. Dear Danes.

43
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:55,977
In just a fow hours, Kurt Maj's

44
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:58,675
Saturn Expedition
will be a reallty.

45
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:03,551
What has inspired this heroic deed?

46
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,916
Ever since Cape Kurt discovered

47
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:08,198
limitless resources on Saturn,

48
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:11,899
I knew that Denmark
would have to

49
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,032
claim exclusive rights to them.

50
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,607
It is therefore of
vital importance

51
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,715
to claim that planet
for Denmark!

52
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,440
Isn't this project
of greater benefit to you,

53
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:26,130
than Denmark, as such?

54
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:29,548
Rubbish!

55
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:32,770
Kurt Maj Enterpsises
has financed

56
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:35,501
the project as a national gift.

57
00:05:35,845 --> 00:05:40,263
- But...
- Imagine all those riches!

58
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:43,494
It will be the end of taxes, and

59
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:46,675
the beginning of greater welfare.

60
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,620
Mr. Maj, we have a problem.

61
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,931
Our navigator has fallen ill.

62
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:58,041
It seems to be food poisoning.

63
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:01,920
Caused by this Kurt Maj TV Dinner.

64
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:06,358
But he's being treated by
the Danish Medical Services,

65
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,833
so all is well.

66
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:19,066
How will we find a new navigator?

67
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,080
Go over the list once more.

68
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,977
Try to squeeze its tummy.

69
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,178
How many do you want?

70
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:35,664
The crew could have perished

71
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:38,362
from lack of oxygen or small pox.

72
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:40,819
Voila! There you go.

73
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:44,033
I'll never bathe again.

74
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:46,579
No, why start now?

75
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:53,683
CONTRACT

76
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:55,838
What the hell is this?

77
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,483
Kurt Maj and Denmark need you!

78
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,209
- Say what?
- We need a new navigator.

79
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:04,577
And you're the man
for the job.

80
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,662
Do you want me to go to Saturn?

81
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,158
- Please follow us.
- It's urgent.

82
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,479
Yes, but... I haven't got

83
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:14,842
the time just here and now.

84
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:18,183
I have lots of plans.
Laundry and TV...

85
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:19,489
Time is running.

86
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:22,483
I'll have to leave. Goodbye.

87
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,708
What's your problem Jensen?

88
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,512
You're a trained astronaut,
right?

89
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:32,623
<i>When the stars beckon,
I will be there!</i>

90
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:39,474
I guess I could serve my country.

91
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:40,724
Perfect!

92
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:43,655
We knew we could count on you.

93
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:46,714
No problem. I'll just call a cab.

94
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:50,093
I'll meet you out front in ten...

95
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,638
We have some transportation.

96
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,048
But I need to go home first.

97
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:57,464
Go for it, Per!

98
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:01,345
I need to cut my toenails.

99
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:06,346
I need to get that board sanded

100
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:08,258
before I leave, or...

101
00:08:16,973 --> 00:08:19,202
- Wait...
- Bye, bye.

102
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:28,077
Welcome aboard, Per.

103
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:30,453
Let's have a nice chat, now.

104
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:43,355
This is our command center.

105
00:08:43,664 --> 00:08:47,964
The best brains in the nation
are gathered here.

107
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:54,372
That computer has been
programmed

108
00:08:54,384 --> 00:08:56,873
to bring you all the way
to Saturn.

109
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:00,174
So you are just a safety measure.

110
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,996
What are the chances
of a mishap?

111
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:08,355
Zero percent!

112
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:11,738
Besides, your commander,
Skrydsbøl,

113
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,153
is a distinguished soldier.

114
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,070
You will not find a more steady man.

115
00:09:18,415 --> 00:09:21,234
<i>You've disgraced the Army.</i>

116
00:09:21,246 --> 00:09:23,369
<i>You've failed us.</i>

117
00:09:23,675 --> 00:09:26,825
<i>You are a failure, Skrydsbøl.</i>

118
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,436
Basra!

119
00:09:37,807 --> 00:09:39,306
THE MISSION COMES FIRST

120
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:49,250
<i>Arne? Where are you?</i>

121
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:55,318
<i>- Help me, Arne... Arne</i>
- Gerd! Gerd!

122
00:09:56,815 --> 00:10:00,104
Get away from him, you bastards!

123
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:02,076
I'm coming, Gerd!

124
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,278
The reading materlals
you asked fer.

125
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,716
Die, you filthy
Al Qaeda combatant!

126
00:10:12,752 --> 00:10:14,874
Skrydsbøl is known to run
a tight ship

127
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:16,707
on all of his missions.

128
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:18,799
Arne Skrydsbøl at your service.

129
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:20,740
If I may be so bold as to say...

130
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:23,033
You'll make a great team.

131
00:10:23,045 --> 00:10:25,731
I promise you, I will not fail

132
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,302
It needs to be cleared.
Hold on...

133
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:33,911
Hello?...In the 3rd matrix
of the launch coordinates.

135
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:39,900
No, in the third...
Well, look at the binary code!

137
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:45,893
Susanne speaking.

138
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:49,332
Yes, I heard. They're
looking for a new navigator.

139
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:53,495
You want me to ..?
I'll be there right away. Yes!

141
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:57,438
Susanne, welcome aboard.

142
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,636
As always, a sight for sore eyes.

143
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:04,171
I'm glad you thought of me.

144
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:07,855
I've always wanted to go on
a space mission.

145
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,122
I'll do my best.

146
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,484
No! Susanne, my sweet...

147
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:16,112
You know, we can't send you
out there.

148
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,147
- Why you are...
- I'm what?

149
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,723
I'm your technical director.

150
00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:23,755
No, it just won't work.

151
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:26,586
You brighten up the
premises down here.

152
00:11:26,598 --> 00:11:28,056
We've chosen this guy.

153
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:37,651
- Per?
- Susanne?

153
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:39,651
You know him?

154
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:44,341
- We used to be lovers.
-We went to the Astronaut Academy.

155
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:47,371
Then you're the perfect team.

156
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:51,392
Per is, to put it mildly,
not suited

157
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:54,130
for an expedition
of this magnitude.

158
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:56,426
Fiddlesticks.

159
00:11:56,438 --> 00:12:00,849
Per is a true man of the people.

160
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:03,383
Per is a fucking fraud!

161
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:05,648
The closest he ever got to space

162
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,953
was when we watched Star Wars!

163
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,175
Why do you insist on hiring

164
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,792
the most incompetent idiots
for the expedition?

165
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:14,334
I hope you know

166
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:17,015
what the flipping hell
you're doing!

167
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:21,970
I guess someone's
on the rag today.

168
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:32,000
Susanne Mortensen, here

169
00:12:32,075 --> 00:12:34,411
Technical Director of Project Saturn.

170
00:12:34,718 --> 00:12:36,486
I need the exam papers from

171
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:38,674
Space Academy for a Per Jensen.

172
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,357
Yes, right now.

173
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:43,782
Well, you'll just have to wake
the security guard!

174
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,798
TIME FOR LIFT OFF!!

175
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:08,050

Oh la la.
Exquisite taste, Monsieur.

180
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:26,164
I'd like to stress a point here.

181
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:28,403
I demand strict discipline.

182
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:31,055
As representatives of Denmark

183
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:33,356
we'll be part of history forever.

<i>and two of Denmarks's finest pilots.</i>

186
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,338
<i>And finally,
the experienced astronaut,</i>

187
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,794
<i>Per Jensen.</i>

188
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:08,493
Here you are, Madam.

188
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,493
Ow, merde!

189
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,867
Hello, beautiful!

190
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:24,400
Don't just stand there
dawdling, men.

191
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:27,348
All aboard now!
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

192
00:14:31,341 --> 00:14:33,918
Wait! Do I have time
to take a crap?

193
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,679
Just a teeny-weeny crap?

194
00:14:52,193 --> 00:14:55,572
A proper hello to you! I'm Jamil,
your cook on this trip.

196
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:57,913
Hi, there. My name is Per

197
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:00,217
and I'm the new navigator.

198
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:04,402
Don't worry,
I'll get you to Saturn.

199
00:15:04,414 --> 00:15:05,710
Come here.

200
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:08,778
A cheese sandwich
with jelly and cress

201
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,162
or a Company Sandwich?

202
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,003
Isn't that a Club Sandwich?

203
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,191
Hey, it's alright.

204
00:15:17,203 --> 00:15:20,609
No, it's important
that I learn.

205
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:23,227
I flunked the
Danish Citizen Test

206
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,563
but if I work hard
on this trip

207
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,541
and learn to be a real Dane,

208
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,517
they promised me
a second chance.

209
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:32,002
Then I'll bring my
family up here and

210
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,203
we'll open a classy restaurant.
Look!

211
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,199
HOT DOGS

212
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:40,998
Howdy ho, space homos!

213
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:45,800
Yo ho, you two Princesses.

214
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:48,717
It's hot-ass-mothafuckin party time!

215
00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:52,213
Ole is in charge of supplies.

216
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,698
Here's some high culture

217
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,579
for your Danish Test, Jamil.

218
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,358
{\an5}SQUIRT IN MY ASS

219
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:59,459
{\an5}WITH: WERNER FUCKHAPPY
& HELGA HORNYBITCH

220
00:15:58,367 --> 00:15:59,734
It's German, but,

221
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:01,313
we do it the same in Denmark.

222
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:04,521
I'm not sure my
wife would approve.

223
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,869
Come on, man!

224
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:08,030
Saucy young chicks!

225
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:10,529
Are those
girls you've been porking?

226
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:15,221
You son of a dog!
I'll butcher you halal style

227
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,672
and feed you to the rats!

228
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,002
I just want to be
your pork partner!

229
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:21,850
These are my family photos!

230
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,855
Time out, boys.

231
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:26,237
Gorm the Old, Harald Bluetooth,

232
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:28,270
Sweyn Forkbeard, Harald II,

233
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:33,186
Canute the Great... I'm sorry.

234
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:36,000
I was way too sensitive.

235
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:39,330
A real Dane can handle
insults and taunts.

236
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:41,492
You're absolutely right there,

237
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:43,708
my little monkey boy.

238
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:48,131
You fat...
You big, fat bastard.

239
00:16:48,143 --> 00:16:49,545
Right on!

240
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:56,687
<i>Stand by for lift off.
Man your stations.</i>

241
00:16:57,494 --> 00:17:01,487
Sergeant Skrydsbøl.
Wait a second.

242
00:17:01,794 --> 00:17:04,681
We've got T minus 4 minutes
and 12 to lift off!

243
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:06,786
It is a clear violation.

244
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:09,627
You must read it
before lift off.

245
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:12,355
Is it cleared
according to protocol?

246
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,948
No, but it contains...

247
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,729
It can be contaminated
with anthrax!

248
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:20,874
But it's about Per. He's...

249
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:22,991
Brief me when we're airborne.

250
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:32,177
Now, let's have a bitchin'

251
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:34,435
awesome heck of a party! Here.

252
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,198
Beer. The favourite soft drink
of the Danes.

254
00:17:38,544 --> 00:17:41,692
Beer is a pacifier, not a satisfier.

255
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,228
Balthazar!

256
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:59,471
No, Balthazar! Come back here!

257
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:02,468
<i>10, 9, 8, 7...</i>

258
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:07,037
<i>Main booster start.
4, 3, 2, 1...</i>

259
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:10,186
<i>Lift off!</i>

260
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:18,289
Mon cherie!

261
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:39,415
Man, this sure is enough
to make your

262
00:18:39,427 --> 00:18:41,712
asshole rock and shake,
ain't it?

263
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:54,346
Mr. Maj, look over here.

264
00:19:08,822 --> 00:19:11,282
Owr, but really...

265
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:24,874
ACCESS DENlED

266
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:27,871
Kurt Maj, look over here. Mr.

267
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:31,096
Prime Minister,
look at the duck.

268
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:33,574
Mr. Maj, I seem to have a problem

269
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:35,397
with protocol 314.

270
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:37,920
It's a video,
but I can't access it.

271
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:40,004
And I've never heard of it befere.

272
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:41,769
Don't trouble your pretty head

273
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,153
with that technical stuff.

274
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:47,453
But I'm Techical Director, Mr. Maj.

275
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:07,721
What's the protocol on knocking
before approaching your superior?

277
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,121
- That... yo shod knock flsth?
- Exactly.

278
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,866
If this had been Kabul,

279
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:15,991
your mother would've had you
back in a body bag.

280
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,724
Look me in the eyes... I knew it!

281
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:21,553
You've got it.

282
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,713
The look of death.

283
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:25,432
We've stared death straight
in the eyes.

284
00:20:25,778 --> 00:20:28,843
You never forget your
first time, huh?

285
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:30,117
The first kill!

286
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,950
Mine was in Belrut '82.
Them were the days.

287
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:34,610
How many kills have you had?

288
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:40,908
That is... two... eh,
fifty... ninety!

289
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:44,260
It's an honour to
have you aboard.

290
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:47,205
Let's have a real
astronaut chat.

291
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,825
Yes, definitely. I just have to

292
00:20:49,837 --> 00:20:52,312
check some... navigation stuff.

293
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:54,063
That's right, Per.

294
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:55,692
The mission comes first!

295
00:20:57,151 --> 00:21:02,373
What a beautiful cow.
Please sit down. (GERMAN)

296
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,059
- Bratwurst?
- So big!

297
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:13,256
I just love that movie, dude!

298
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:16,121
Ole has to watch it at least
once a day.

299
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:19,962
Then little Ole will
come out to play.

300
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,457
And for a dollar,
I'll let you watch.

301
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:27,173
Aah, pussy, wonderful pussy.

302
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,792
Let's have some pussy...

303
00:21:30,137 --> 00:21:34,561
See what I've made, dude.
A pee bubble!

304
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:36,051
Made of pee!

305
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:39,238
Yikes! Get that thing away from me.

306
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:41,755
It's just like urine squash!

307
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,078
No! My photos!

308
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:50,449
Ole's invented a
new sport with pee!

309
00:21:50,461 --> 00:21:52,180
I'll be damned...

310
00:21:52,486 --> 00:21:54,522
Be quiet!

311
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,166
Yuck, shame on you!

312
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:03,178
That's what comes from
having such a...

313
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,159
WOG aboard this craft. Yuck!

314
00:22:05,503 --> 00:22:07,808
I expect discipline on this mission!

315
00:22:08,115 --> 00:22:10,105
In the Gulf, we didn't have any

316
00:22:10,117 --> 00:22:12,378
of this stinking
monkey business!

317
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:17,293
HOT DOGS

318
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:07,943
They're almost there.

319
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:13,065
All hands on deck!

320
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:16,544

in T minus 15 minutes.

321
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,527
Ready for landing?

322
00:23:44,693 --> 00:23:47,419
Say, what are you doing?

323
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:51,756
I'm ready to put on my helmet
in case of...

324
00:23:51,768 --> 00:23:54,524
acute decompression symptoms?

325
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,908
Of course! Why didn't
I think of that?

326
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,167
Good point, Per.

327
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:30,005
Touchdown. Welcome to Saturn.

328
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:32,391
Good! Form formation:

- Hear, hear!
- They don't seem primitive.

353

We come from a highly developed
country called Denmark.

freedom of speech.
As a little bonus!

359
00:27:01,572 --> 00:27:05,258

I mentioned freedom of speech?

00:27:15,358 --> 00:27:18,755
Dang it! Ouch!
I don't believe it.

366
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,617
My trigger finger!

367
00:27:26,148 --> 00:27:27,185
Shit!

368
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,500
The closest planet
we could find

369
00:27:49,512 --> 00:27:51,855
is in the Solaris cloud,
just 12 years...

370
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:57,973
Get to the point!

371
00:27:57,985 --> 00:27:59,940
What is the size of
its water supply?

372
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:03,205
- Two percent.
- Two percent?

373
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,068
But we have sucked dry,

374
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,544
all the other planets
in the galaxy.

375
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,994
You idiot!

376
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:12,543
2% will not even keep
the army going for a week!

377
00:29:00,998 --> 00:29:04,146
Bon appetit.

378
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,203
Beloved Dictator,

379
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:19,121
we have captured
this gang of aliens.

380
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:21,004
We demand to be treated
in accordance with

381
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:22,484
the Geneva Convention...

382
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:29,029
...our military rights.

383
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:31,870
Insert the translators now!

384
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:35,458
Let me go, you terrosist bastard.
This is utterly...

386
00:29:38,285 --> 00:29:40,479
They don't have an orifice
in their back

387
00:29:40,491 --> 00:29:41,932
for the translators.

388
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,119
They must have an incredibly
primitive DNA structure.

390
00:29:46,464 --> 00:29:49,629
Hey, wait! There's an
orifice further down.

391
00:29:49,641 --> 00:29:51,301
Roll in the machinery.

392
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:11,269
Oh, yes! A little more
to the left, please.

394
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:18,681
Tell me where you come from.

395
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:22,599
Just state your name,
rank and home port.

396
00:30:22,944 --> 00:30:26,208
Arne Skrydsbøl, Navy sergeant,
Planet Earth.

398
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:29,287
What business
have you on Saturn?

399
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:31,968
Arne Skrydsbøl,
Navy sergeant, Earth.

400
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:34,967
Are the translators
fitted right?

401
00:30:34,979 --> 00:30:36,385
Fuck, that hurt!

402
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:39,114
It should work perfectly.

403
00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:40,839
Take them away.

404
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:48,600
Bring them back when
it's time for dinner.

405
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:50,478
You two, come with me.

406
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:12,289
Hopelessly outdated.

407
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:22,811
What's he saying?

408
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:27,147
I've kept an eye on you since my

409
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:30,067
first test probes
reached Saturn.

410
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:33,640
I know that water is
of vital importance to you

412
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:37,431
yet you have
problems procuring it.

413
00:31:37,443 --> 00:31:40,628
Allow me to present,
Planet Earth.

414
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:45,928
<i>Earth, known as the Blue Planet.</i>

415
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:49,265
<i>78% of it is covered in water...</i>

416
00:31:49,277 --> 00:31:52,187
<i>just waiting to be sucked up.</i>

417
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:55,745
<i>This is an offer
you cannot refuse.</i>

418
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:59,292
<i>Drop by Earth, and
we'll discuss this.</i>

419
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:02,210
I look forward to meeting you.

420
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:06,202
Strip this sorry
craft of everything,

421
00:32:06,214 --> 00:32:09,199
and then prepare my spaceship.

422
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,882
Where the hell are they?

423
00:32:17,108 --> 00:32:19,244
They went out
to stretch their legs.

424
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:21,294
They should have
been back by now.

425
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:24,021
Hey, that might be them!

426
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,782
What?

427
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,584
Oopsy daisy!

428
00:32:32,892 --> 00:32:36,462
There goes all of our communication!

429
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,801
I won't stand for
that tone of voice.

430
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:40,533
Accidents do happen, you know.

431
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:43,792
It'll take days to
re-establish connections.

432
00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:46,254
That was our only server.

433
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:49,210
Annoying, isn't it?

434
00:32:49,222 --> 00:32:51,592
Well, I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

435
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:06,799
Come here.
We have a pretty gift for you.

436
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:09,986
Gu ga gu ga gu ga.

437
00:33:15,592 --> 00:33:18,948
Well, horrible testicle torture

438
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,309
is an unavoidable aspect
of our business.

439
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:23,788
Look at it
as an occupational hazard.

440
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,078
That makes it all easier.

441
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:27,267
Cheers, Ole.

442
00:33:29,993 --> 00:33:32,547
My last one!
It should join the rest

443
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,986
of the Brewsky family
in my belly.

444
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:37,313
I'm like a beautiful flower.

445
00:33:37,325 --> 00:33:39,630
I need a beer or I'll wither away.

446
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,430
I'm withering away!

447
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:43,088
What are you doing?

448
00:33:43,432 --> 00:33:45,938
I think our prison cell
is made of

449
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,425
frozen metallic gas.

450
00:33:48,732 --> 00:33:51,485
It has crystallized
and appears hard

451
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:54,262
but vaporizes if
exposed to alcohol.

452
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,277
How the hell did you know?

453
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:59,639
I have a doctorate
in nuclear physics.

454
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:02,832
Any monkey can claim that.

455
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:05,168
Let's rock'n'roll, boys!

456
00:34:06,273 --> 00:34:08,738
Halt! Prison break!

345
00:34:08,837 --> 00:34:10,756
Basra!

457
00:34:11,273 --> 00:34:16,534
Great teamwork.
Let's go! Hup, hup, hup.

458
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:36,597
They're getting ready
for something.

459
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:37,808
Yeah, but what?

460
00:34:38,154 --> 00:34:40,498
Look! Our spaceship.

461
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,722
And there's the boss dude.

462
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:47,600
<i>Saturn Force One, departure!</i>

463
00:34:47,947 --> 00:34:51,287
<i>Destination: Planet Earth.</i>

464
00:34:52,477 --> 00:34:53,500
Earth?

465
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,416
<i>Operation Suck Earth Dry.</i>

466
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:58,913
<i>Proceed to hut 3 and
await the Dictator's signal.</i>

467
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:02,808
- Suck Earth Dry?
- Sounds kinky!

468
00:35:03,152 --> 00:35:05,349
The Dictator is on his way
to Earth

469
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:07,300
to launch an invasion.

470
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,442
I knew it was a rogue state!

471
00:35:09,454 --> 00:35:11,792
Look at that giant
vacuum cleaner.

472
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,457
If he reaches Earth
and transmits the signal,

473
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:15,748
it would mean...

474
00:35:16,054 --> 00:35:18,455
The End of the World!

475
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:21,509
We'll put an end to that.

476
00:35:31,453 --> 00:35:33,123
Move over, boys!

477
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:35,179
Time for some boobs and beer.

478
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:58,104
I found this in the Earthlings' craft.

479
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,531
Some outmoded audio-visual media

480
00:36:00,543 --> 00:36:02,943
based on electromagnetic current.

363
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:09,747
<i>You're so good, Hans!
I'm so horny!</i> (GER.)

481
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:15,076
Seems to be an instruction
manual on Earth customs.

483
00:36:15,851 --> 00:36:18,010
Interesting.

484
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:33,663
Ow! Fucking shit!

485
00:36:35,084 --> 00:36:39,538
Then there's a slight increase.
You hold it in for ten minutes.

487
00:36:39,845 --> 00:36:43,915
Saturn mission to Cape Kurt,
come in.

488
00:36:44,024 --> 00:36:47,441
Per, let's get'er in the air
so we can eliminate that UFO.

490
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:49,960
I haven't had much
practice with this model,

491
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:52,094
I'm used to the Apollo type.

492
00:36:52,203 --> 00:36:55,665
You and I have the look of death.
Remember that.

494
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,531
Always nice to have
a clear view.

495
00:37:09,543 --> 00:37:10,604
Right?

496
00:37:16,786 --> 00:37:19,743
Per, hurry up!

497
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:22,354
HANDBRAKE

498
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:31,378
Tilt, Per! Tilt!

499
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:39,436
What's the matter with you, kid?

500
00:37:39,448 --> 00:37:41,324
Don't worry.
I'll take it from here.

501
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:45,125
I flew the Hercules planes
when we carpet-bombed Belgrade.

503
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:48,903
Post-traumatic stress disorder
is quite common

504
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:50,503
after dangerous missions.

505
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:56,837
Ow! Old fucking plece of shit!

506
00:37:57,874 --> 00:38:00,045
Yes! Come on. Expedition...

507
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:03,212
Expedition, Cape Kurt calling.
Can you hear me?

508
00:38:03,558 --> 00:38:06,438
- Hello.
- Per, is that you?

509
00:38:06,646 --> 00:38:10,278
This is George from
the Short wave Radio Club.

510
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,391
Any kinky girls on line?

511
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:20,914
Hello? Hello...

512
00:38:22,374 --> 00:38:25,753
Ole has totally freaked out.

513
00:38:28,594 --> 00:38:31,092
Enemy in sight!

514
00:38:34,624 --> 00:38:36,642
The Earthlings' spacecraft!

515
00:38:36,654 --> 00:38:38,233
It's gaining on us.

516
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:41,153
Let them come.

517
00:38:44,186 --> 00:38:47,286
Fire! And not just a
warning shot either.

518
00:38:47,298 --> 00:38:49,447
Just throw it right at them.

519
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:00,852
They're gone.

520
00:39:03,271 --> 00:39:06,995
- Contact! Per, eliminate them.
- What?

521
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,818
Let me have a shot at it.

522
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:19,523
You know dog fights too,
Mr. 9/11?

523
00:39:19,668 --> 00:39:23,362
No, three years in the
Accommodation Centre.

524
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:25,467
PlayStation, see?

525
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:32,948
Way to go, Jamil. Bull's eye!

526
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,335
The UFO seems to be unharmed.

527
00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:41,979
They don't stand a chance
against our deflector shield.

529
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:44,518
Give me an estimate
of the steering system

530
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,203
of their pathetic vessel.

531
00:40:05,826 --> 00:40:09,362
A black hole.
It's sucking us in!

532
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,739
Arne, turn the wheel!

533
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:17,114
Way to go, Arne!

534
00:40:23,182 --> 00:40:24,351
<i>Red alert!</i>

535
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:27,906
Take over.
I'll check the air lock.

536
00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:34,511
<i>Red alert! Red alert!</i>

537
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:39,733
CONFIDENTIAL

538
00:40:49,027 --> 00:40:51,560
Per, would you please come with me?

539
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:54,932
Just activate the jet pack,

540
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:57,513
scoot over to the UFO and
attach the explosives.

541
00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:00,291
Have you gone mad, man?

542
00:41:00,303 --> 00:41:02,390
Don't worry, Per.

543
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:04,884
This should be a piece of cake

544
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:06,845
for a seasoned astronaut like you.

545
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,312
Wait! I'm not an astronaut.

546
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:12,322
I've never been to space before.

547
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:14,447
I don't know how to ride
a jet pack!

548
00:41:14,793 --> 00:41:18,940
I've known that
from the moment I saw you.

549
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:22,146
Arne Skrydsbøl has a keen eye.

550
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:24,997
You smell like a con man.

551
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:27,158
Arne, I can explain it all...

552
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,425
No, you cannot!

553
00:41:29,846 --> 00:41:32,292
Know... who sailed Olfert Fischer?

554
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:33,301
An ole fart?

555
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,788
Hello?

556
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,371
Shot them...
call it friendly fire.

557
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:40,021
Can you hear me?

558
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,448
Arne, this is dangerous!

559
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,245
You've endangered the mission.

560
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,969
What with your lies
and fake exam papers.

561
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:51,449
Wait! I lied for a reason.

562
00:41:51,461 --> 00:41:53,693
It had better be a good reason.

563
00:41:54,037 --> 00:41:56,742
I lied because I was in love.

564
00:41:56,754 --> 00:41:57,959
I see.

564
00:41:57,964 --> 00:42:00,259
That's the worst excuse ever!

565
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:03,358
Have you never been in love,
Arne?

566
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:06,250
I was close to my pup,
Dick Cheney.

567
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:09,086
But I shot it
when it ate my medals!

568
00:42:09,098 --> 00:42:11,472
I'm talking about
real love, Arne.

569
00:42:11,778 --> 00:42:13,499
Have you never been so
madly in love

570
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:15,580
that it hurts, just to see her?

571
00:42:15,889 --> 00:42:18,594
That's how I felt about Susanne.

572
00:42:18,606 --> 00:42:21,379
She'd just been accepted
into the Academy.

573
00:42:21,586 --> 00:42:24,227
I thought,
I'll be an astronaut, too,

574
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,140
just to be close to her.

575
00:42:26,448 --> 00:42:29,290
But I flunked all the tests.

576
00:42:29,636 --> 00:42:32,218
Get to the point, or
I'll shoot you in the head,

577
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,614
like little Dick Cheney.

578
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:36,319
So I started cheating
to impress her.

579
00:42:36,331 --> 00:42:38,775
Yes, I tampered with
my exam papers.

580
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,063
No Dane with any kind of

581
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:43,691
space-slash-military training
is fooled by a con.

582
00:42:44,036 --> 00:42:46,466
Yes. She was mad about me,

583
00:42:46,478 --> 00:42:48,758
and everything was just great.

584
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,369
Then she found out I'd cheated
and went totally ballistlc.

586
00:42:52,415 --> 00:42:55,585
She said I was a disgrace
to the space program.

587
00:42:55,597 --> 00:42:57,707
She never understood.

588
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,331
I didn't give a fuck
about the space program.

589
00:43:01,343 --> 00:43:04,118
I just wanted to be with her.

590
00:43:05,655 --> 00:43:09,418
You activate the bomb
on the red button.

591
00:43:11,185 --> 00:43:13,258
No!

592
00:43:16,023 --> 00:43:17,751
Oh, no!

593
00:43:18,058 --> 00:43:20,899
- Where's Per?
- There.

594
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:24,811
It's always nice to have
a clear view,

595
00:43:24,823 --> 00:43:26,161
right, Per?

596
00:43:28,157 --> 00:43:31,459
Activate the jet pack, you idiot!

597
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:37,835
Hell, bloody!

598
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:48,971
- Oh. no.
- No more games.

599
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:57,995
What kind of abomination is this?

600
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:01,075
Some sort of advanced
remote control.

601
00:44:01,087 --> 00:44:03,947
They've taken over
our control system.

602
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,612
What the fuck are you up to?

603
00:44:28,409 --> 00:44:30,520
Goodbye.

604
00:44:36,811 --> 00:44:38,608
Get us outta here!

605
00:44:45,304 --> 00:44:46,763
Typical!

606
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:50,104
Per!

607
00:44:57,784 --> 00:45:00,845
<i>You are a trained astronaut,
right?</i>

608
00:45:00,857 --> 00:45:03,929
<i>We'll be a part of history forever.</i>

609
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:07,320
<i>You're so cool, Per!</i>

610
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:09,996
<i>You smell like a con man.</i>

611
00:45:10,302 --> 00:45:13,437
<i>Per is a genuine
man of the people.</i>

612
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:15,602
<i>Per is a fucking fraud!</i>

613
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:22,707
Susanne!

614
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:27,929
Susanne... no!

615
00:45:31,846 --> 00:45:35,800
Per! Oh, no, it's all my fault.

616
00:45:41,715 --> 00:45:42,909
Bloody hell!

617
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:45,747
The autopilot is down
with a fatal error.

618
00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:48,301
This is a crisis situation.

619
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:50,239
We'll never make it back to Earth.

620
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:51,954
What happened to Per?

621
00:45:51,966 --> 00:45:54,111
He was sucked into
the black hole.

622
00:45:54,317 --> 00:45:56,177
We have to go in after him.

623
00:45:56,189 --> 00:45:58,803
A suiclde mission?
You'd like that!

624
00:45:58,811 --> 00:46:00,656
We have to try.

624
00:46:01,001 --> 00:46:04,256
<i>Arne, where are you?</i>

625
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,980
<i>Arne, for fuck's sake!</i>

626
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:11,007
The mission always comes first!

627
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:13,972
Per failed us. I can do nothing!

628
00:46:18,463 --> 00:46:21,401
What the hell is wrong now?

629
00:46:21,413 --> 00:46:23,956
We've run out of gas.

630
00:46:30,215 --> 00:46:32,634
Well, you'll have it your way then.

631
00:46:43,232 --> 00:46:47,149
Beloved Dictator, we're
entering the Earth's atmosphere.

633
00:46:47,257 --> 00:46:48,685
He was right.

634
00:46:48,697 --> 00:46:51,736
They've got enough water to keep
the fleet running for 20 years.

635
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,914
Send the co-ordinates
to the invasion force.

637
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,976
I don't know what to say,
but I think

638
00:47:05,988 --> 00:47:08,308
something has gone
terribly wrong.

639
00:47:10,113 --> 00:47:11,605
What's going on?

640
00:47:11,617 --> 00:47:14,875
Someone is entering
the atmosphere.

641
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:17,024
Oh, no!

642
00:47:18,483 --> 00:47:23,399
Six. One, two, three, four... Oh, no.

643
00:47:23,706 --> 00:47:25,495
Oops, Mr. Prime Minister,

644
00:47:25,507 --> 00:47:27,508
this is going to be expensive.

645
00:47:27,816 --> 00:47:31,618
We'll just cut back on
senior citizen care, again this year.

647
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:36,724
- Mr. Maj.
- Susanne. What an entrance!

648
00:47:36,832 --> 00:47:38,507
Our spaceship is lost,

649
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:40,872
and an unidentified vessel
is approaching.

650
00:47:41,179 --> 00:47:42,759
I think it's hostile.

651
00:47:42,771 --> 00:47:45,402
The Danish People's Party protest.

652
00:47:46,594 --> 00:47:51,700
There comes a time when you as a
citizen of this peaceful nation,

654
00:47:52,045 --> 00:47:55,810
are forced to perform that
noble defence mechanism,

656
00:47:56,155 --> 00:47:58,064
which we, over the generations

657
00:47:58,076 --> 00:48:00,841
have proudly resorted to,
again and again,

658
00:48:00,848 --> 00:48:04,220
and proven that we master it
to perfection:

659
00:48:04,564 --> 00:48:06,990
Total subjection!

659
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,020
What?

660
00:48:08,366 --> 00:48:10,517
We're talking about cool cash here.

661
00:48:10,823 --> 00:48:13,174
Imagine the export rights and

662
00:48:13,186 --> 00:48:16,201
exchange of sustainable
technology.

663
00:48:16,507 --> 00:48:19,736
Your re-election is
ensured because you

664
00:48:19,748 --> 00:48:23,074
can lower taxes AND
preserve Welfare.

665
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,184
You can't just do that!

666
00:48:26,492 --> 00:48:28,528
Leave this to the men, now.

667
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,061
OK, you sweet little thing?

668
00:48:40,046 --> 00:48:43,376
I think we've
passed through it.

669
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:46,921
Never underestimate
Danish design.

670
00:48:59,977 --> 00:49:02,547
The atmosphere is compatible.

671
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,891
We're really out
in the sticks, huh?

672
00:49:07,188 --> 00:49:10,190
We have to survey the area
and find fuel,

673
00:49:10,202 --> 00:49:12,425
if Denmark is to be saved.

674
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:16,681
Look! A light.

675
00:49:19,982 --> 00:49:25,475
DENMARK HAS VISITORS FROM SPACE

676
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:53,930
Cheers!

676
00:50:22,224 --> 00:50:24,530
D.U.F.O. BIDS YOU WELCOME

677
00:50:34,634 --> 00:50:37,091
<i>I'm so horny.</i> (GERMAN)

678
00:50:37,238 --> 00:50:40,662
<i>We want to take all your girls</i>

679
00:50:40,674 --> 00:50:44,258
<i>and squirt in their assholes.</i>

680
00:50:44,264 --> 00:50:51,200
<i>Give me your big cock.
Ach, ja! Ach, ja!</i>

681
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:05,816
Dear Danes!
Let's welcome our new allies.

682
00:51:06,161 --> 00:51:08,472
These fascinating beings
have come to

683
00:51:08,484 --> 00:51:10,807
negotiate the future
export of goods.

684
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:14,564
Of all nations on
Earth they chose us.

685
00:51:14,576 --> 00:51:17,682
Because Danish goods
are the best!

686
00:51:19,064 --> 00:51:23,172
If we enter into this agreement,

687
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,098
then early retirement
is guaranteed

688
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:28,087
for all coming generations.

689
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,819
That's not true!

690
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,676
The aliens are hostile.

691
00:51:35,788 --> 00:51:38,341
They've murdered our astronauts!

692
00:51:38,685 --> 00:51:41,215
Well, as soon as someone takes

693
00:51:41,227 --> 00:51:45,598
a splendid initiative
to create prosperity,

695
00:51:45,604 --> 00:51:48,312
the leftwinged,
paranoid eco-freaks

696
00:51:48,324 --> 00:51:50,744
crawl out of their
filthy wood works.

697
00:51:50,988 --> 00:51:53,102
Some people will
always be naysayers,

698
00:51:53,114 --> 00:51:54,961
when it comes to progress,

699
00:51:55,005 --> 00:51:59,709
but real Danes will agree that
those who try to slow progress

700
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:01,636
are traitors!

701
00:52:01,643 --> 00:52:05,183
- You fucking communist!
- Filthy bitch!

702
00:52:05,527 --> 00:52:09,253
But where is
the Saturn Expedition then?

703
00:52:09,598 --> 00:52:12,324
Traitor!

704
00:52:14,168 --> 00:52:16,427
Welcome to Earth.

705
00:52:16,439 --> 00:52:19,428
Prepare a translator.

706
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,453
Attention! This looks like

707
00:52:33,465 --> 00:52:36,402
a cultural leftist
art installation.

708
00:52:36,709 --> 00:52:39,052
Hey, there's doorbell.

709
00:52:39,397 --> 00:52:41,048
OUR FATHER & SONS

710
00:52:57,676 --> 00:52:59,001
I'm Saint Peter,

711
00:52:59,023 --> 00:53:03,513
and I can smell your earthly
vessels from in here.

712
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,520
No time to chat, Santa Claus.

713
00:53:05,532 --> 00:53:07,545
We're on a mission and
have run out of gas.

714
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:11,849
Gas? I don't know
anything about that.

715
00:53:11,861 --> 00:53:14,610
But... come on in and ask.

716
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,368
{\an8}HEAVEN

717
00:53:21,867 --> 00:53:25,515
Just make your inquiry
at the counter over yonder.

719
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:39,686
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

720
00:53:39,994 --> 00:53:41,933
So, take off your boots,

721
00:53:41,945 --> 00:53:44,026
don't drag your dust in here.

722
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:49,566
We need gas. I demand to
talk to your superior.

724
00:53:59,385 --> 00:54:01,114
It's him.

725
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:04,282
Hey, what's up, guys?

726
00:54:04,294 --> 00:54:07,680
Want a guided tour of the garden?

727
00:54:07,986 --> 00:54:10,051
I'm willing to help you

728
00:54:10,063 --> 00:54:12,288
suck up all the water from Earth.

729
00:54:12,596 --> 00:54:13,990
The oceans, the ground water,

730
00:54:14,002 --> 00:54:15,437
the whole shebang.

731
00:54:15,744 --> 00:54:19,465
And what do you expect
in return?

732
00:54:19,477 --> 00:54:23,002
I want the island
of Greenland.

733
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,181
The Kurt Maj Drink is top notch.

734
00:54:27,193 --> 00:54:30,222
It's made from pure
Greenland ice.

735
00:54:30,566 --> 00:54:35,366
The Kurt Maj Drink,
the only water.

736
00:54:35,674 --> 00:54:37,824
$ 399 a bottle.

737
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:40,479
When you've sucked up
all the water,

738
00:54:40,491 --> 00:54:42,624
it'll be more valuable
than gold.

739
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:45,776
People have to drink
Kurt Maj Drink.

740
00:54:45,788 --> 00:54:48,461
I already extracted
large quantities

741
00:54:48,807 --> 00:54:51,503
and stored it at
different spots

742
00:54:51,515 --> 00:54:54,222
all over the world.
Have a Kurt Maj Drink!

743
00:54:58,522 --> 00:55:01,940
You can't do that!

744
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:05,319
Kill her.

745
00:55:36,308 --> 00:55:38,996
CATALOGUE OF SINS

746
00:55:47,367 --> 00:55:50,197
Excuse me, are you Jesus?

747
00:55:50,209 --> 00:55:53,873
No, man. I'm Stand-in-Jesus.

748
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,592
My older brother is on Earth

749
00:55:55,604 --> 00:55:57,428
trying to make a comeback.

750
00:55:57,774 --> 00:55:59,869
The old man is
making an effort to

751
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:01,807
get the business booming again.

752
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:07,106
We haven't had much following
these days.

753
00:56:10,063 --> 00:56:11,280
Disgusting!

754
00:56:11,292 --> 00:56:13,788
Sexually deviant mutants
with wings.

755
00:56:15,362 --> 00:56:17,972

BEER, PUSSY & HORN MISIC

758
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:29,923
Hell changed its
marketing strategy

759
00:56:29,935 --> 00:56:31,988
from eternal
punishment and misery.

760
00:56:32,335 --> 00:56:33,840
Now their slogan is:

761
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:35,368
"beer, pussy & horn music"

762
00:56:35,676 --> 00:56:37,810
How can you compete with that?

763
00:56:37,822 --> 00:56:40,438
Let me go, you
disgusting cockatoo!

764
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:44,852
- Look!
- Let go of me, for fuck's sake!

765
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,000
I haven't got the
time to be dead.

766
00:56:48,012 --> 00:56:48,962
Hey, Per.

767
00:56:49,269 --> 00:56:51,771
I never thought
I'd see you again.

768
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,686
Where have you been, Per?

769
00:56:53,992 --> 00:56:55,609
Little Per, my friend.

770
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:58,064
It's worse than
the IRS up here.

771
00:56:58,408 --> 00:57:00,366
I told them I had to return, but

772
00:57:00,378 --> 00:57:02,594
they asked for a load of papers

773
00:57:02,901 --> 00:57:06,857
- Oh, no. You're not dead are you?
- No.

774
00:57:07,203 --> 00:57:08,967
What about the UFO?

775
00:57:08,979 --> 00:57:11,771
Well, it got away, didn't it?

776
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,749
Let's just find some gas and

777
00:57:13,761 --> 00:57:15,382
blow this hippie commune.

778
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:18,128
We don't have stuff
like that up here.

779
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,182
The whole place is wind-powered.

780
00:57:20,527 --> 00:57:22,256
God Almighty!

781
00:57:22,268 --> 00:57:25,981
You must help us save Earth.

782
00:57:26,326 --> 00:57:30,704
Earth?
But that's our entire clientele.

783
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:34,658
Say, the Holy Ghost might
be able to help you.

785
00:57:40,688 --> 00:57:42,952
What do we need that for?

786
00:57:42,964 --> 00:57:44,873
Ouch, you filthy little creep!

787
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,572
They're flying vermin.

788
00:57:47,684 --> 00:57:50,671
Easy now. Trust me.

789
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:54,858
ANGEL PUSSY

790
00:57:55,203 --> 00:57:59,428
Unfortunately,
these guys have to return.

791
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:05,303
- Good luck with it all, then.
- Likewise.

792
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,129
Where do you think
you're going?

793
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:09,565
What do you mean?

794
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:11,795
Our policy is strict:

795
00:58:11,807 --> 00:58:15,709
Once you've died and gone
to Heaven, that's it!

796
00:58:16,054 --> 00:58:18,610
I'm not even a
member of the Church.

797
00:58:18,622 --> 00:58:19,741
What the hell?

798
00:58:21,162 --> 00:58:25,463
Fuck off, you fucking parasite!

799
00:58:31,529 --> 00:58:34,543
Where's it going? Come back.

800
00:58:34,555 --> 00:58:36,674
Filthy shit bird.

801
00:58:54,801 --> 00:58:58,755
It's a gas station! Right on!

802
00:59:10,737 --> 00:59:15,190
- Look. They sell Danish beer.
- Beer?

803
00:59:15,537 --> 00:59:18,532
Brewsky!

804
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,828
Yes!

805
00:59:33,509 --> 00:59:36,193
Well, Arne. It's fllled up.

806
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,693
And so what?

807
00:59:38,002 --> 00:59:39,858
We have no autopilot,

808
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:41,995
and our navigator is an impostor!

809
00:59:53,975 --> 00:59:55,588
Right on!

810
00:59:58,314 --> 00:59:59,968
This beer's heavy.

811
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:03,230
Per's never here
for manual labour!

812
01:00:04,306 --> 01:00:07,301
Aviation deck, check.
Flaps, check.

813
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:09,067
Engine burst, check.

814
01:00:09,412 --> 01:00:12,753
We're ready for lift-off.

815
01:00:13,061 --> 01:00:15,670
I found the manual.
Just push start,

816
01:00:15,682 --> 01:00:18,090
and we're headed
right for Earth.

817
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:25,350
Well, let's go then, Per.

818
01:00:52,651 --> 01:00:54,966
Alright, when the stars beckon,

819
01:00:54,978 --> 01:00:57,644
here we fucking come.

820
01:01:04,211 --> 01:01:07,013
We're flying at 20 times
normal speed.

821
01:01:07,321 --> 01:01:10,392
Do we need these
translators anymore?

822
01:01:10,404 --> 01:01:12,351
I'm so sore in my butt.

823
01:01:12,697 --> 01:01:14,925
It might contain info about the enemy.

824
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:17,147
Keep it up there, and you'll pass

825
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:18,803
the Dane test, next time.

826
01:01:29,709 --> 01:01:32,589
Well, boys. we're almost home.

827
01:01:57,855 --> 01:02:02,004
Hello. - Susanne?
- Per, is that you?

828
01:02:02,311 --> 01:02:04,110
I thought you were dead.

829
01:02:04,122 --> 01:02:05,997
How did you find your way back?

830
01:02:06,304 --> 01:02:08,993
Per handled that.
He turned out to be

831
01:02:09,005 --> 01:02:11,488
an outstanding navigator.

832
01:02:20,052 --> 01:02:22,934
Susanne, has the UFO arrived?

833
01:02:22,946 --> 01:02:24,813
Yes, but I've...

834
01:02:25,121 --> 01:02:27,825
The invasion fleet
is on its way.

835
01:02:27,837 --> 01:02:29,497
The invasion fleet?

836
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:32,801
Did the dictator
bring a remote control?

837
01:02:33,108 --> 01:02:35,409
Of course!

838
01:02:35,421 --> 01:02:38,137
The dictator uses the remote control

839
01:02:38,445 --> 01:02:40,425
to log into the operative system

840
01:02:40,437 --> 01:02:42,324
of other spacecrafts
and control them.

841
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:44,250
If you could get hold of it,

842
01:02:44,262 --> 01:02:46,394
we may be able to stop
the entire UFO fleet.

843
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,539
Okay. I'll do my best.

844
01:02:48,551 --> 01:02:51,041
We'll come as fast as we can.

845
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:55,617
So this is where you're hiding,

846
01:02:55,629 --> 01:02:58,183
On an intergalactic date.

847
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:01,524
- How sweet.
- Leave her alone!

848
01:03:01,831 --> 01:03:04,689
When the stars beckon, then

849
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:07,783
big, bad Per is on his way!

850
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:10,149
Why do you think I picked

851
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,929
a bunch of losers and a
burned-out soldier?

852
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:16,005
You're good for nothing,
and that made you

853
01:03:16,017 --> 01:03:18,229
perfect for my little mission.

854
01:03:18,574 --> 01:03:20,247
Wish I had time to chat, but

855
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:22,484
I've got a planet to suck dry.

856
01:03:22,629 --> 01:03:25,677
Say goodbye to Susanne now.

857
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:31,004
I thought you'd
done away with them.

858
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:34,011
They don't know
what they're in for.

859
01:03:36,123 --> 01:03:39,387
Put the pedal to the metal.
Let's go!

860
01:03:46,336 --> 01:03:48,672
Where did that come from?

861
01:03:48,684 --> 01:03:50,946
We're dead meat, boys.

862
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,459
We'll hit the moon. Shit!

863
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:58,933
This is gonna be one tough
crash landing!

864
01:04:13,524 --> 01:04:17,365
Oh, no. The invasion fleet.

865
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:29,377
Why did I join this
shitty mission?

866
01:04:29,389 --> 01:04:31,803
I'll never see my
dear family again.

867
01:04:32,111 --> 01:04:33,845
I've lost everything

868
01:04:33,857 --> 01:04:35,952
for fucking Denemarci!

869
01:04:36,296 --> 01:04:38,480
Sandwiches, beer
and crappy soccer!

870
01:04:38,492 --> 01:04:40,444
You can't even beat the Swedes!

871
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,288
And silly proverbs!

872
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:44,859
Who the hell lives in
a house of glass?

873
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:48,658
And who wants one bird
in the hand?

874
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,811
It's a shitty nation!

875
01:04:58,875 --> 01:05:01,524
I have to speak to my God.

876
01:05:03,676 --> 01:05:05,799
Where the heck is Mecca?

877
01:05:05,811 --> 01:05:09,014
Just face Earth.
That should do it.

877
01:05:18,901 --> 01:05:22,994
<i>Git yer goddam hands in the air
you Taliban motherfucker!</i> (ENG)

878
01:05:26,485 --> 01:05:28,924
This is the perfect place to erect

879
01:05:28,936 --> 01:05:31,247
your water exploitation machine.

880
01:05:31,555 --> 01:05:33,410
You can't just take
the water on Earth.

881
01:05:33,422 --> 01:05:34,589
It belongs to all of us.

882
01:05:34,933 --> 01:05:38,049
You get the Kurt Maj Drink,
instead.

883
01:05:38,061 --> 01:05:41,271
But ordinary people
can't afford it.

884
01:05:41,615 --> 01:05:44,151
Then they'd better start saving up.

885
01:05:44,495 --> 01:05:46,416
A strong signal on our radars

886
01:05:46,428 --> 01:05:48,335
seems to indicate more
incoming UFOs.

887
01:05:48,643 --> 01:05:51,600
It's almost an army.

888
01:05:53,673 --> 01:05:56,443
So many to build that machine?

889
01:05:56,455 --> 01:05:59,932
My soldiers won't build anything.

890
01:06:02,774 --> 01:06:05,347
We'll have slaves do the work!

<i>Let's just do the fat one first.</i> (ENG)

891
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,363
Never point a thing like that
at other people.

892
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:20,937
It's fucking dangerous.

Hold it right there!

894
01:06:39,449 --> 01:06:40,945
We're on our way to Earth

895
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:43,296
to stop an alien invasion.

896
01:06:43,308 --> 01:06:45,438
We don't have time for
your foolishness.

in 24 hours.

899
01:07:21,803 --> 01:07:23,042
You have 12.

900
01:07:23,054 --> 01:07:25,912
Danes can't work any faster.

901
01:07:26,256 --> 01:07:28,897
Their work ethic has
deteriorated

902
01:07:28,909 --> 01:07:31,479
from decades of being
public employees.

903
01:07:31,787 --> 01:07:34,980
Wrong answer.
You're in charge now.

904
01:07:34,992 --> 01:07:37,930
You've got 12 hours, understood?

905
01:07:38,238 --> 01:07:41,003
Start the countdown!

906
01:07:49,412 --> 01:07:52,215
Hey, kabob.

906
01:07:52,712 --> 01:07:56,815
<i>This is our secret space program
called 'Nucular' Emergency Manoeuver</i>

906
01:07:56,912 --> 01:07:58,715
<i>Or Nukem for short. Check it out.<i>

906
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:01,215
<i>Now, where's that Denmark place?<i>

685
01:08:01,593 --> 01:08:03,392
<i>There we go!<i>

907
01:08:06,877 --> 01:08:09,765
Hey, let the grown-ups have a look.

908
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,562
Hornbæk Beach. High society tits!

689
01:08:16,755 --> 01:08:20,954
<i>We can nuke anything from up here.
See those two white-ass bitches?</i>

909
01:08:24,049 --> 01:08:27,391
What's that?

910
01:08:27,735 --> 01:08:30,269
It's the countdown for
the end of the world.

912
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:34,973
Susanne!

913
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:38,411
Someone ran off
with your girl.

914
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,090
Treachery on the home-front.

915
01:08:41,102 --> 01:08:43,404
She's been taken hostage!

916
01:08:43,712 --> 01:08:45,755
At least the problem is solved.

917
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:47,551
We'll nuke the platform and be heroes.

918
01:08:47,896 --> 01:08:50,436
We can't!
Susanne is down there.

919
01:08:50,448 --> 01:08:52,927
Let me tell you
something, Per!

920
01:08:53,234 --> 01:08:55,487
I've only had one true friend,

921
01:08:55,499 --> 01:08:57,688
Gerd, my second in command.

922
01:08:57,996 --> 01:09:00,157
During a mission in Basra

923
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,566
he was caught in enemy crossfire.

924
01:09:02,873 --> 01:09:05,215
I could either
complete the mission

925
01:09:05,227 --> 01:09:07,057
or save Gerd. I chose Gerd.

926
01:09:07,366 --> 01:09:09,761
If Gerd died, I wouldn't have

927
01:09:09,773 --> 01:09:12,512
anyone left in my life. Nobody!

928
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:16,696
It didn't work.
The mission went totally awry.

930
01:09:17,004 --> 01:09:19,730
Arne!

931
01:09:20,038 --> 01:09:23,298
Gerd was killed. 60 bullets.

932
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:26,488
I was demoted from colonel
to sergeant.

933
01:09:26,796 --> 01:09:29,031
I'd forgotten the
most important rule

934
01:09:29,043 --> 01:09:31,289
in the army:
The mission comes first.

935
01:09:31,596 --> 01:09:35,014
But this is my chance
to make it right!

936
01:09:35,322 --> 01:09:37,025
That's not right, Arne.

937
01:09:37,037 --> 01:09:39,392
You went through the black
hole to save me.

938
01:09:39,736 --> 01:09:41,234
It wasn't quite like that.

939
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:45,131
I get your point
about not nuking anybody,

940
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:47,608
but how can we stop them?

941
01:09:47,686 --> 01:09:49,520
Kurt Maj had a point.

942
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,831
We are just a bunch of losers.

943
01:09:59,475 --> 01:10:01,990
We didn't get this far
just to end up nuking

944
01:10:02,002 --> 01:10:04,007
hundreds of innocent people.

945
01:10:04,314 --> 01:10:07,270
Did we at any time have
the odds in our favour?

947
01:10:07,616 --> 01:10:09,507
Would a bunch of losers
have survived

948
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:11,072
everything we've been through?

949
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,721
We aren't losers. We're astronauts.

950
01:10:15,066 --> 01:10:17,089
We represent Denmark

951
01:10:17,101 --> 01:10:19,135
in the entire universe

952
01:10:19,444 --> 01:10:21,598
and Denmark doesn't nuke
innocent people

953
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:23,897
just to serve a greater cause.

954
01:10:26,087 --> 01:10:28,051
I suggest we put it to a vote.

955
01:10:28,063 --> 01:10:29,927
Danish democracy is the thing!

956
01:10:30,235 --> 01:10:33,920
All in favour of saving Denmark
in a humane way.

958
01:10:34,267 --> 01:10:37,991
- Hear, hear!
- Utter foolishness!

959
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,786
Per, do we have a plan?

960
01:10:50,798 --> 01:10:54,579
No. But I know
someone who might.

961
01:10:58,267 --> 01:11:00,264
RACE OF TERRORISTS FROM SATURN?

962
01:11:00,276 --> 01:11:01,453
ALIENS DO ExIST

963
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:04,525
Mom! I was supposed to go

964
01:11:04,537 --> 01:11:07,406
with the others to see the aliens.

965
01:11:16,813 --> 01:11:19,617
I think you have some visitors, Ib.

966
01:11:21,115 --> 01:11:23,035
Coffee's served.

967
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,724
Why did we let ourselves
be fooled?

968
01:11:25,736 --> 01:11:27,411
What are we going to do?

969
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,947
Let me see.
All aliens are prone to

970
01:11:29,959 --> 01:11:32,135
be eliminated by
some Earth stuff.

971
01:11:32,443 --> 01:11:34,345
They may get the flu and die.

972
01:11:34,357 --> 01:11:36,629
Or mosquito spray,
shampoo, or cooties.

973
01:11:36,973 --> 01:11:38,628
DUFO has taped everything on

974
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,545
the aliens since they arrived.

975
01:11:40,852 --> 01:11:45,000
We've only got
an hour and a half left.

976
01:11:46,075 --> 01:11:48,801
Wait! Rewind a bit.

977
01:11:49,147 --> 01:11:51,067
There. Pause!

978
01:11:51,412 --> 01:11:56,328
- Slow forward.
- <i>How about a beer?</i>

979
01:11:56,635 --> 01:11:59,400
- Why, it's beer!
- Of course!

980
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:02,300
Yo, have a beer!

981
01:13:03,221 --> 01:13:05,024
They're back!

982
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:07,693
Per!

983
01:13:07,605 --> 01:13:10,526
We've got her,
they won't touch us.

984
01:13:10,633 --> 01:13:12,482
Keep them out of
the control room.

985
01:13:12,494 --> 01:13:14,590
Lead them onto the upper deck.

986
01:13:14,596 --> 01:13:18,773
- But how?
- Just do it. Now!

987
01:13:28,528 --> 01:13:31,580
The suction machine!
We have to stop it.

988
01:13:31,592 --> 01:13:32,713
Come on, Arne!

989
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:37,323
Where is the control room?

990
01:13:37,335 --> 01:13:38,780
Over here, boys.

991
01:13:40,622 --> 01:13:45,285
You! Get all these people
as far away as possible.

993
01:13:50,338 --> 01:13:53,834
- Stop your griping, Susanne.
- Susanne!

994
01:13:54,178 --> 01:13:56,819
Let's split up.
Arne, Ole, stop the engine.

995
01:13:56,831 --> 01:13:58,749
Jamil, come with me.

996
01:14:10,653 --> 01:14:13,572
You stay here and fix that door.

997
01:14:15,299 --> 01:14:19,023
Come and get me
you oversized lizard!

998
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:29,545
Susanne!

999
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,676
Take that!

1000
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:57,156
- Only ten minutes left!
- Yo!

1001
01:15:13,054 --> 01:15:15,818
Per! I'm coming!

1002
01:15:23,806 --> 01:15:26,147
Jamil...

1003
01:15:29,835 --> 01:15:32,215
Jamil, no!

1004
01:15:33,598 --> 01:15:39,051
- Jamil...
- I can't feel my legs. Cold...

1005
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:42,130
Don't die! You have to
become a real Dane.

1006
01:15:42,142 --> 01:15:43,889
We'll visit the landmarks.

1007
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,826
I'll introduce you
to 'Ida Davidsen' and

1008
01:15:45,838 --> 01:15:48,191
let you taste her
open-faced sandwiches.

1009
01:15:48,199 --> 01:15:52,052
Per, you need to be a father
to my kids.

1010
01:15:52,064 --> 01:15:54,641
Jamil Junior and Jamilla.

1011
01:15:54,987 --> 01:15:57,853
Promise to talk to
my wifo, Nadja,

1012
01:15:57,865 --> 01:16:00,440
cousin Ali, uncle Nadim
and Dina.

1013
01:16:00,784 --> 01:16:03,188
My cousin and her children,
Hakim and Yassir

1014
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:04,779
and their wives

1015
01:16:05,087 --> 01:16:07,775
and Mohammad, my other cousin...

1016
01:16:08,082 --> 01:16:10,103
Right, right, all of them.

1017
01:16:10,115 --> 01:16:12,729
Wait, I have more
pictures here.

1018
01:16:13,766 --> 01:16:19,179
"There is a lovely land..."

1019
01:16:21,215 --> 01:16:23,484
It didn't penetrate you.

1020
01:16:23,596 --> 01:16:26,092
Your photos stopped the bullet!

1021
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:29,701
You made it!

1022
01:16:39,801 --> 01:16:42,796
Hey, greenhorn. Skol!

1023
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:03,686
Right on, Susanne!

1024
01:17:04,761 --> 01:17:06,527
Let's get out of here.

1025
01:17:06,834 --> 01:17:10,096
We have to stop that suction machine.

1026
01:17:12,863 --> 01:17:14,763
What the hell does it say?

1027
01:17:14,775 --> 01:17:17,165
You have to mount
a translator.

1028
01:17:17,509 --> 01:17:19,720
You can borrow mine.

1029
01:17:19,732 --> 01:17:22,157
Fine, just hurry up.

775
01:17:34,769 --> 01:17:36,608
Ha!

776
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:55,570
Billy Bob, keep an eye on
our Danish friends.

777
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:59,670
Holy monkeys, there's the sign!
Let's nuke'em!

778
01:18:04,592 --> 01:18:09,751
Yeeeha!
That's a helluva titty twister!

1030
01:18:10,326 --> 01:18:11,583
What are you up to?

1031
01:18:11,595 --> 01:18:14,457
A nuclear missile
is on its way.

1032
01:18:14,765 --> 01:18:17,128
We just need to
get out of here.

1033
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:19,719
Susanne and Ole
are still up there!

1034
01:18:20,064 --> 01:18:22,934
The mission comes first.
That's the way it is.

1036
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:33,069
That sounds just about right.

1037
01:18:33,081 --> 01:18:36,846
You could've told me
where it went.

1038
01:18:39,788 --> 01:18:41,255
ON/OFF

1039
01:18:53,626 --> 01:18:57,344
Why couldn't you have read it?

1040
01:18:58,119 --> 01:19:01,382
- Susanne!
- Per!

1041
01:19:03,841 --> 01:19:06,328
You were so good up there!

1042
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:09,486
Why didn't you just
come right out and say it?

1043
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:12,405
- Susanne.
- I thought you were a lame smartass.

1044
01:19:12,649 --> 01:19:14,010
Susanne, not now!

1045
01:19:14,022 --> 01:19:16,858
There's a nuclear missile
on its way.

1046
01:19:28,724 --> 01:19:31,489
Basra!

1047
01:19:37,786 --> 01:19:39,438
Arne?

1048
01:19:39,783 --> 01:19:42,449
I told you I only had one
true friend.

1049
01:19:42,461 --> 01:19:44,315
I see now that's not true.

1050
01:19:44,659 --> 01:19:46,678
I've gained two new friends.

1051
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:49,162
Sometimes, friends come
before the mission.

1052
01:19:50,997 --> 01:19:54,030
Alright, three friends then.

1053
01:19:57,525 --> 01:20:00,136
Run, dammit, run!

1054
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:09,620
- Arne!
- You shall not pass, you bastard!

1055
01:20:18,607 --> 01:20:20,566
Arne!

1056
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:36,885
We can't get away. He's too heavy.

1057
01:20:38,882 --> 01:20:40,956
Jamil, the gun!

1058
01:20:41,954 --> 01:20:44,910
Bottoms up!

1059
01:20:55,011 --> 01:20:57,929
- Right on, man!
- Yeehaw!

1060
01:21:00,501 --> 01:21:03,151
Hurry up! The missile is coming.

1061
01:21:05,455 --> 01:21:07,259
Yeehaw!

1062
01:21:09,526 --> 01:21:14,096
Fools! I have thousands of
UFOs left in the universe.

1064
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,115
Did you really think

1065
01:21:16,127 --> 01:21:18,243
it would be that easy
to beat me?

1066
01:21:20,585 --> 01:21:23,004
Scheisse! (GER. Shit)

1067
01:21:52,150 --> 01:21:55,609
Would a desert princess like you
wanna see the palm rise

1068
01:21:55,621 --> 01:21:57,026
at Ole's oasis?

1069
01:21:57,335 --> 01:21:59,251
Bloody hell, Ole!

1070
01:21:59,263 --> 01:22:03,018
Remember, respect for traditions.

1071
01:22:03,325 --> 01:22:06,397
That doesn't count when we're
talking about my cousin.

1073
01:22:06,741 --> 01:22:08,526
Do you really understand Danish

1074
01:22:08,538 --> 01:22:10,345
if you use one of these?

1075
01:22:13,947 --> 01:22:16,727
Where will we spend
our honeymoon?

1076
01:22:16,739 --> 01:22:19,330
We could begin
with the Milky Way.

1077
01:22:19,338 --> 01:22:22,295
After that,
we'll just follow the stars.

1079
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,736
SUSANNE HAS GOT A TIGHT PUSSY

1080
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:22,375
I sensed that something
was not right

1081
01:23:22,387 --> 01:23:23,928
with the strangers.

1082
01:23:24,272 --> 01:23:27,003
So I decided to isolate them
at my oil field

1083
01:23:27,005 --> 01:23:28,804
and exterminate them.

1084
01:23:29,149 --> 01:23:31,954
It was a tough battle,
but my plan worked.

1085
01:23:31,966 --> 01:23:33,604
I had them exterminated.

1086
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:36,550
And now, Kurt Maj Enterpsises

1087
01:23:36,562 --> 01:23:40,003
has always been very keen on
getting cheap,

1089
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:42,821
alternative energy resources
for the Danes.

1090
01:23:43,128 --> 01:23:46,108
So let me introduce
my latest project:

1091
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,194
The Journey to the Sun!

1092
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,657
What the hell?

1093
01:25:53,769 --> 01:25:56,451
They haven't been true to
the comic at all!

1094
01:26:01,255 --> 01:26:03,367
