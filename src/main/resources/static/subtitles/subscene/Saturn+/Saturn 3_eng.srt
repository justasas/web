1
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,438
Captain James, your
presence on Pad 73. Urgent.

2
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,994
Captain James,
your presence required. Urgent.

3
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,390
Pad 73, for immediate launch.

4
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:24,875
Launch 392. Captain James,
your presence required. Urgent.

5
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,594
Is that you, Benson?

6
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,999
How you doing?

7
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,629
So you blew the mental test?
"Potentially unstable". Huh!

8
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,793
I'd have been unstable,
too, getting Saturn 3.

9
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,838
Huh! Saturn 3...

10
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,990
You're not going to appeal?
It's been tried before.

11
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,639
Hey, Benz, what are you doing?!
Wait a minute! Stop!

12
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,032
Stop! No, B... Quick, stop!
Benz! Hold it!

13
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,115
Launch 392. Captain James
for Saturn 3 launch minus 5.

14
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,636
Launch 392. Commit minus 3.

15
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:08,074
Launch to Control. Group
on board. Commit minus 250.

16
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,716
Status red and counting.

17
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,590
You remain clear.
Let's go. Minus 030.

18
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,514
Have a pleasant trip, Captain.

19
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,874
Minus 20.

20
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,197
Minus 15.

21
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,118
Minus 10 and counting...
Nine, eight, seven, six, five,

22
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,557
four, three, two, one...

23
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,077
You are entering the field

24
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,550
of Saturn 3 Experimental
Food Research Station.

25
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,599
Landers should adopt vectors
3-9 to the polar elliptic,

26
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,069
2-4 to the equator.

27
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,711
You are entering the field

28
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,554
of Saturn 3 Experimental
Food Research Station.

29
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,589
- Any urgent unloads?
- It can wait.

30
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,558
- I'll take that.
- No.

31
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,636
Is that all right in here?

32
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,073
Yes.

33
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,194
Here's where we've been
for the last three years.

34
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,554
- Captain.
- Major.

35
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,959
This is my partner.

36
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,556
Take a look around.
We'll lock up.

37
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,793
You're quite an event
in our lives.

38
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,519
I guess you don't get
many drop-ins.

39
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,795
Hardly ever,
especially not from Earth.

40
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,269
- Hmm...
- Captain.

41
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,034
- What condo do you come from?
- Terminal 5.

42
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,759
Oh, I know 5. Where?

43
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,593
Far side of the East Billions.

44
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,832
Where were you?

45
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,992
I spent a couple of terms
in Billion Park.

46
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,834
They've cleaned it out now.
It's a dead cell.

47
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,957
Dead? I didn't know that.

48
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,074
- It's been a while. This way.
- I see by your scan

49
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,835
- you've never been to Earth.
- No, I haven't.

50
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,475
Saturn 3...
When they want to give...

51
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,996
...the Solar System an enema,
it's where they stick the tube.

52
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,674
We've heard that one.

53
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,357
I expected to go the lab.

54
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,635
We thought we'd have
a welcoming drink first.

55
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,076
- How's Earth, Captain?
- You get the bulletins.

56
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,628
You're supposed
to scan and acknowledge.

57
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,312
We do acknowledge.

58
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,356
But we don't always scan.

59
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,913
No.

60
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,310
- Earth is hungry.
- That's why we're here.

61
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,913
Your research
is behind schedule.

62
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,912
We're doing all we can.

63
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,673
- You need help.
- You're the help?

64
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,596
- No taction contact.
- You mean don't touch?

65
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,829
Correct.

66
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,032
What's in there?

67
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,752
I have to report in.

68
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,229
- You can't.
- We're in eclipse.

69
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,837
Oh, yes.

70
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,071
No external contact
while we're shadow-locked.

71
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,549
- You know that.
- Of course.

72
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,394
- How long will it last?
- 22 days.

73
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,190
- I need some rest.
- Show the captain his quarters.

74
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,633
Major.

75
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,436
Can I get you anything?
Some herbal?

76
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,080
- I'll just take some blues.
- Blues?

77
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,197
Blues. Blue dreamers.

78
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,157
Sleeping pills?

79
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,949
You've never heard of blues?
You lead a shut life here.

80
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,508
I choose to be here.

81
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,598
Here... In case
you choose to try one.

82
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,678
- One thing I envy him.
- What's that?

83
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,479
He's breathed.
We lead a shut life here.

84
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,358
It must be something
to go outside and breathe.

85
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,238
When I was last there,
if you breathed,

86
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,074
the pollution count
would rust your tubes!

87
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,718
What do you think
of the captain?

88
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,155
- He's funny.
- Funny?

89
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,232
I must have missed
his best lines.

90
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,515
- Adam?
- Hmm?

91
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,670
What are blues?

92
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,239
Blues?

93
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,312
- Blue dreamers.
- Where did you get that?

94
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,958
From him.

95
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,995
He had no business
giving you this.

96
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,513
What do they do?

97
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,750
When they send
someone out alone,

98
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,037
they give them these
to stop them going static.

99
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,315
Did you ever take one?

100
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,517
- Blue dreamers?
- Did you?

101
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,999
Years ago.

102
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,796
- What was it like?
- Huh?

103
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,836
You heard me.

104
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,273
Interesting.

105
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,159
Let's try one... together.

106
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,713
- Maybe.
- Come on.

107
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,949
Please.

108
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,789
After he goes.

109
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,791
How long will he be here?

110
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,791
No longer than I can help.

111
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,714
Do your best to make him feel
at home, huh?

112
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,795
- Sally.
- Shut in the lab.

113
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,235
I'll get her.

114
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,828
Alex!

115
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,516
There you are.

116
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,074
No!

117
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,716
No taction contact.

118
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,155
Come here, Sally.

119
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,113
Sally?

120
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,192
Sally, where are you?

121
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,078
Come on. Sally?

122
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,278
- It has a name?
- Of course she has a name.

123
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,396
- You never had a dog?
- A few times.

124
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,357
Didn't they ever have names?

125
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,319
- Just something to eat.
- Give her to me. Don't.

126
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,236
It's time for bed, Captain.

127
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,949
Yes, you have a great body.
May I use it?

128
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,713
- I'm with the major.
- For his personal use only?

129
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,229
Yes.

130
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,910
That's penally unsocial
on Earth, you know that?

131
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,595
Well, it's not here.
Enjoy your blues.

132
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,113
Hey!

133
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,192
Problems?

134
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,319
Come on.

135
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,714
Come into my quarters.
We'll discuss your problem.

136
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,309
Looks like he's building
his own place.

137
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,913
He's not travelling light.
Maybe I should help him.

138
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,958
Why? He's here to help us.

139
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,875
He's so strange.

140
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,190
That's a lot of stuff.
How long are you staying?

141
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,032
Till I'm done.

142
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,190
What have you got for us?

143
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,919
It's the best. The latest robot.

144
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,037
- We've got three.
- They're not much help.

145
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,111
This one's different.

146
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,236
Different, huh?

147
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,788
It's the first
of the Demi-God series.

148
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,113
Alex? Where'd you get that name?

149
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,475
It's what the major calls me.

150
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,632
I know why
you deny me hospitality.

151
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,676
You have
the run of the place.

152
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,639
I mean you. Your body is
beautiful. I'd like to use it.

153
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,597
I'm not interested.

154
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,274
On Earth, we use our bodies
for pleasure.

155
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,315
No, thanks.

156
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,232
You're afraid of me,
aren't you?

157
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,151
I'm not afraid of anyone.

158
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,596
You're afraid he'll be jealous.
He will be jealous.

159
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,990
He's frightened of new ways.
He's obsolete. He's prob...

160
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,596
Lights.

161
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,356
Pure brain tissue.

162
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,430
Human?
This is an unborn.

163
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,233
It hasn't a thing
on its mind... yet.

164
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,199
Then it has to be programmed.
It takes a human 20 years...

165
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,078
- I'll need four weeks.
- Four weeks?

166
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,718
Once it's together,

167
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,074
- it will take over...
- Take over?

168
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,229
With help.

169
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,393
- Then what?
- One of you will be obsolete.

170
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,833
We can apply for remission
together, can't we?

171
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,595
We have to find a way
to stay together.

172
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:38,958
The truth is,
I'm close to abort time.

173
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,037
I hoped they'd forgotten us.

174
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,113
They never
seem to forget.

175
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,836
Obsolete...

176
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,234
Alex! I've got it.

177
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,437
We flush the captain
and his friend into space.

178
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,999
You wouldn't do that.

179
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,913
Why? People are flushed
all over the solar system.

180
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,629
- No one cares!
- It's a horrible idea.

181
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,156
It's a great idea.

182
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,834
- Blue dreamers?
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,196
Now?

184
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,236
Why not?

185
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,797
I don't feel anything.

186
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,516
You always want instantaneous
satisfaction.

187
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,876
Do you miss it?
Maybe it's different now.

188
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,951
Yeah, maybe it's worse.

189
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,034
That pill's getting to you.

190
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,792
No...

191
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,473
I think you ought
to go to Earth.

192
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,312
What?

193
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,037
You said I'd hate it.

194
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,078
Find out for yourself
you hate it.

195
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,116
I don't want to go.

196
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,312
Yes, you do.

197
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,639
- I just want to have been.
- So have been.

198
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,271
- And leave you?
- It'll happen sooner or later.

199
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,230
Quiet, please.
You're blocking him.

200
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,713
Meet Hector.

201
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,234
Adam.

202
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,629
Give it an instruction.
Ask something.

203
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,031
- Hector?
- Yes.

204
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,389
Hector, hand the flask
to the major.

205
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,112
Abort!

206
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,871
Glad you didn't ask him
to shake hands.

207
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,308
Wheel and peditate.

208
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,633
Obviously,
there's some fine tuning to do.

209
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,152
Begin.

210
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,077
- I thought you had me.
- You have me.

211
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,875
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening.

212
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,393
Can he play?

213
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,359
Yes. I play. He plays.

214
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,556
I'd like to see that.

215
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,753
Hector. All right.

216
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,151
How would you like
to make a small wager, Hector?

217
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,879
He doesn't like
to be laughed at.

218
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,349
Can't you program
a sense of humour?

219
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,793
That's not a priority.

220
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,235
You can't program
a sense of humour.

221
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,039
- Anything I have, he can have.
- He'll definitely have one.

222
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,315
- Who's white?
- You be, Hector.

223
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,390
How does he learn?

224
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,549
Direct input.

225
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,200
He sits him
in front of a blackboard.

226
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,998
I said direct input.

227
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,835
How do you work that?

228
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,990
Brain to brain.

229
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,230
A brain drain?

230
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,475
You mean he draws
from your brain?

231
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,358
Yes. When I want him to.

232
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,431
But how?

233
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,518
Radio contact.

234
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,196
Where do you make
the connection?

235
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,954
Hector.

236
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,279
What were you thinking?

237
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,316
Exchange and simplify.

238
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,868
And you can control
what you think?

239
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,315
- Yes.
- I wish I could.

240
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,915
I teach him
as much as I choose.

241
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,309
You haven't taught him enough.

242
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,632
Sacrifice. That's one thing you
can't teach him, Captain.

243
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,312
Sacrifice.

244
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,838
Checkmate.

245
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:03,318
Now, whatever he thinks goes
straight into that robot.

246
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,277
Doesn't that scare you?

247
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,475
Not really.

248
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,632
The captain's been carefully
selected. He's trained.

249
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,678
- To control his thoughts.
- Of course.

250
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,591
How do you work that?

251
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,598
Is it the box?

252
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,671
You can hear me, right?

253
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,119
But you can't talk.

254
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,157
Who knows
what's in the captain's brain?

255
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,119
Who knows what goes on
in anybody's head?

256
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:32,116
Alex, would you say I was a man
who could control his thoughts?

257
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,872
I think so.

258
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,436
Stand up... please.

259
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,279
Now take that off very slow...
No, go on.

260
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,035
Now I'm gonna think about
nothing... but hydroponics.

261
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,152
Hydroponics...

262
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,468
Hydroponics...

263
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,597
Hydroponics... hydroponics...

264
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,910
Hydroponics!

265
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,472
Who devised this system? There
are sources for food present.

266
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,118
And cities...

267
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,317
- What happened?
- My eye. Something's in my eye.

268
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,834
- Get Adam.
- Let me look.

269
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,558
It's a live chip. Sit down.

270
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,950
- Get Adam.
- Please. Hector.

271
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,031
- No!
- Relax.

272
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,908
- Trust him, Alex.
- No! Don't. Please don't.

273
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,676
- Don't let him touch me.
- Be still. It could spread.

274
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,832
Steady.

275
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,272
- No!
- Steady.

276
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,554
No!

277
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,992
Please don't...

278
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,636
Ready, Hector?
Keep the eye still!

279
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,559
All right, Hector.
She's ready... now.

280
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,072
- Hold your head still.
- No...

281
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,392
Oh... That's better.

282
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,830
That's much better. Thank you.

283
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,229
I have something for you.
Earth dreams.

284
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,389
No.

285
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,589
You'll feel like you're there.
A 3-D inner experience.

286
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,954
No, thank you.

287
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:24,036
You're worried you'll like it.
You'll never know until you try.

288
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,315
I'm today. He's yesterday.

289
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,709
Don't you like me? Don't you?

290
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,276
Turn off the video scans.

291
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,155
There. What's wrong
with you today?

292
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,268
Today? I'm not today.
I'm yesterday.

293
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,238
You've been listening
to our cuckoo.

294
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:02,440
- He's not so cuckoo.
- You can tell the time by him.

295
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,513
What is it?
Nearly out of charge?

296
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,638
I wish you would talk.
You know you can.

297
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,312
Why won't you talk?

298
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,112
What have I done wrong?

299
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,234
Blank that.
That's not what I meant.

300
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,916
That was
an improper thought leakage.

301
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,034
What have I done wrong?

302
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,911
Don't get smart.

303
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,149
Are you aware of Alex?

304
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,432
What do you think?

305
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,751
What do you know?

306
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,479
Don't get ideas
above your station, Hector.

307
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,555
I said blank that. Now blank it.

308
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,078
Now reply as ordered.
Am I a killer?

309
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,392
Is that the truth?

310
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,793
Is that the truth?

311
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,274
You're malfunctioning. Answer.

312
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,431
Now, tell me. Can you talk
or are you malfunctioning?

313
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,153
Sally!

314
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,875
Sally! Sally!

315
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,278
Sally!

316
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,673
Sally?

317
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,233
Sally?

318
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,273
Sally?

319
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,198
Sally, come on.

320
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,390
Come on, Sally. Sally?

321
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,433
Sally?

322
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,916
No! No!

323
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,437
No!

324
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,799
No! Adam!

325
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,111
No!

326
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,956
Hector, put her down.

327
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,912
Let her go.

328
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,552
Conform!

329
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,268
Hector.

330
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,156
He'll do what you say.
Alex, you ask him.

331
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,510
Hector, please put me down.

332
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,672
W-w-why did you bring him here.

333
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,040
Did you teach him to kill?

334
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,475
No. It's you.

335
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,677
He wants you. We both do.
He's learned too much.

336
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,355
- Alex!
- Adam!

337
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,873
Major!

338
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,359
What happened?

339
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,070
Major! Help me! Major!

340
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,116
Let the robot have him.

341
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,155
Help!

342
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,558
Help me, please, Major!
Don't leave me!

343
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,238
- Please! Don't leave me!
- I can't do it.

344
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,078
How long will the doors hold?

345
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,639
How strong is Hector?

346
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,912
Come on.

347
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,957
Go through your drills, Captain.

348
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,429
What's emergency procedure?

349
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,670
I don't know.

350
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,716
You don't know?!

351
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,076
If we weren't in eclipse,
we could call Central.

352
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,072
If we were chickens,
we could lay eggs.

353
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,675
We're shadow-locked.
What do we do?

354
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,149
Sit and watch for three days?

355
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,955
He's getting low on charge.

356
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,356
He's about to recharge.

357
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,156
Let him.

358
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,312
- You can't...
- Oh, yes, we can. Alex?

359
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,870
We'll overload him. I'll give
him a headache he won't forget.

360
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,792
Track it.

361
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,795
Track it.

362
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,149
Can't see... I can't see it.

363
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,113
Now.

364
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,195
He's out. You'll have
no more trouble from him.

365
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,033
Or from you.
As soon as we declipse,

366
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,237
I'm reporting your incompetent
handling of this experiment.

367
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,949
You call me incompetent?
You said he'd function.

368
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,395
- You told me...
- On your say so.

369
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,516
- You said you could handle him!
- You put him together!

370
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,158
It's moving!

371
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,674
Hold him down.
Quick, get his brain out!

372
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,512
Hold onto his arm!

373
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,478
Dismantle it. Piece by piece.

374
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,838
Then crate it, and take him
and your ideas back with you.

375
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,948
What you can't stand, you run
from. Like you ran from Earth.

376
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,953
That's right. To get away
from people like you.

377
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,555
To set up
your own little universe?

378
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,312
To help feed yours.

379
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,516
And Alex,
were you thinking of her?

380
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,832
Captain, you flunked.

381
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,157
You want to kill me?
You want to kill me?

382
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,435
Go ahead...

383
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,556
Go ahead. Kill me.

384
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,996
Kill me! If you think you can.

385
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:37,476
Did you know the original Hector
came to a tragic end?

386
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,552
He was slain by Achilles,

387
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,428
his body dragged
around the walls of Troy.

388
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,556
You want the girl?

389
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,633
Sure, sure. You want the girl.

390
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,632
You think she's beautiful,
too, don't you?

391
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,277
You know the captain's crazy?

392
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,157
He really is crazy.

393
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,834
The robot scared me more.

394
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,477
If the robot can kill,
the captain can kill.

395
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,234
I thought I could kill.

396
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,191
I'm just not update enough
for murder.

397
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,233
I wish I was.

398
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,788
Are you sure
he's taking it apart?

399
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,639
Either he takes it apart
or it takes him apart.

400
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,996
Captain,
how are things progressing?

401
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,718
I have completed dismantling.

402
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,998
I'm glad that's over.

403
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,272
It's my fault. I should
never have let him stay.

404
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,512
In a week or two, we'll have
forgotten it ever happened.

405
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,438
- Will we?
- Of course we will.

406
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,310
I'm leaving.

407
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,631
I told you
never to barge in here.

408
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,474
- I'm taking her with me.
- What?

409
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,879
You are crazy.

410
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,712
Come along, Alex.

411
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,110
I'm taking command. You're
inadequate... in every area.

412
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,713
Captain, for the last time...

413
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:05,635
Doesn't it disgust you to be
used by an old man? Can't you...

414
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,795
Stop it! Stop it!

415
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,231
Stop it!

416
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,272
It's me.

417
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,712
Why did you stop me?

418
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,116
You're coming with me. The first
thing to do is see Earth.

419
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,676
Adam, how can we get
to the captain's ship?

420
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,279
We gotta be quick. Let's try.

421
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,555
- Now?
- Come on.

422
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,478
It's no use. We can't lose him.

423
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,873
Alex?

424
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,877
Alex?

425
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,793
Adam!

426
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,475
Shh!

427
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,593
Get back!

428
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,549
Run for it!

429
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,350
Where is he?

430
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,795
I don't know. He just vanished.

431
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,558
He's in the communications room.

432
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,436
He's tracking us.

433
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,235
Come in, Hector.

434
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:24,077
Come on. Come on in.

435
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,515
- Can you fly it?
- No trouble.

436
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,795
It'll be locked
into automatic return.

437
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,314
We just light up and sit back.

438
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,349
Now we know something.
He doesn't want to kill us.

439
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:52,674
Whatever he wants us for,
it's not for that.

440
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,719
It's hopeless.

441
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,639
You'll get your trip
to Earth. I promise.

442
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,318
The captain!

443
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,638
He's alive?

444
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,557
Yes, I'm alive.

445
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,992
Captain, what happened?

446
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,753
Hector and I have come
to an arrangement.

447
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,239
Where is the robot?

448
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,436
Hector is with me.

449
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,629
Come this way, please.

450
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:35,749
How strange
that it ends like this.

451
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,070
How will it end, Captain?

452
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,831
You and I will come
to an arrangement.

453
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,390
This way, please. This way.

454
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,990
Hurry along, please.

455
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,200
Hurry along, please.

456
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,233
I'm here.

457
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,749
I'm alive. I haven't died.

458
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,671
I'm taking over.

459
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,955
Good morning, Adam.
I trust you slept well?

460
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,675
What are you doing to me?

461
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,197
Your programme for the day
is very simple.

462
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,312
Where's Alex?

463
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:31,188
First, you will restore the
damage to the laboratory.

464
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,714
What are you putting in my head?

465
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,519
Put in? Put in?

466
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,478
I'm not putting anything in.
That comes later.

467
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,790
I'm taking it out.

468
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,549
Where's Alex?

469
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:55,108
What have you done to her?

470
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,112
Have you done
the same thing to her?

471
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,190
Good morning, Alex.
I hope you slept well.

472
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,555
Your programme
for the day is simple.

473
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:08,269
-After repairing the lab...
- Where's Adam?

474
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,397
I'm happy to report
he's cooperating fully.

475
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:14,358
Where is he? What's going on?

476
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:17,830
We're coming out of eclipse.
Excuse me for one moment.

477
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,989
Wait!

478
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:23,835
This is Survey 19.
Come in, Saturn 3.

479
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,753
Hello, this is 19.
Come in, Major.

480
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,515
Survey 19, this is the major.

481
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,512
Saturn 3 here.
This is the major.

482
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,192
Receiving you, Survey.

483
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,833
We have audio but no picture.
Are you in difficulty?

484
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,115
Just a temporary
video inconvenience.

485
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:45,918
Everything's A-OK.

486
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,515
We wanted to make
our routine contact.

487
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,477
Everything's normal here.

488
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,758
You can expect increased output
on our hydroponics shortly.

489
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,432
How's our space girl?

490
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:01,069
She's wonderful.
In fact, she's perfect.

491
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,879
Is she nearby? Put her on.

492
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,872
Hello?
Survey 19, can you hear me?

493
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,951
Hello, survey 19.

494
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,793
No! No! It's not me!

495
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,314
That Hector unit,
is it working out?

496
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,517
He's responding
well to this challenge.

497
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,272
Would you like a word
with the captain?

498
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,079
That won't be necessary.
That's all, then.

499
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,516
Talk to you in six months.
Bye, now.

500
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,593
Now we can proceed.

501
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:37,310
First, make your way to the lab
to continue our work.

502
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,830
After repairing all damage,
we shall continue

503
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,388
with our search
and analysis procedures.

504
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,755
I'm sure you will find
them profitable

505
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,593
and, for
the most part, painless.

506
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,072
This way, please. Come along.
I don't want to force you.

507
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,390
You could very quickly
become hungry...

508
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,153
hot, cold or even breathless.

509
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,594
Now, this way, please.

510
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,554
Adam!

511
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,510
When I heard your voice,
I thought I was going mad.

512
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,637
Oh, Alex.

513
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,439
Hurry along, please.

514
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:45,553
- Go on in there.
- Without you?

515
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,078
- I need a minute.
- What'll happen to us?

516
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,479
Don't worry.

517
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,797
Hurry along!

518
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,428
Go on.

519
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,909
Ah, there you are.

520
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,879
And how beautiful.
Come in, Alex. Come in.

521
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,315
Stop it, Hector.

522
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,073
Hector. I never liked that name.

523
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:11,072
Did you know Hector
was slain by Achilles,

524
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:14,277
his body dragged
around the walls of Troy?

525
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,430
No. I never liked Hector.

526
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:20,433
We can do better.
How about Adam?

527
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,674
Stop using his voice.

528
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,433
Forgive me. Is this better?

529
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:28,556
Or this, perhaps?

530
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,393
Stop it! Stop using us.

531
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,630
Well, you see my difficulty.

532
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,039
I'm you,

533
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,269
I'm Adam

534
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,079
and the other one. I'm everyone.

535
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,357
Conversation is an art.
I do it to perfection.

536
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,953
There you are.

537
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,191
Don't be late again, Adam.

538
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:55,037
Major. You will call me major.

539
01:16:55,120 --> 01:17:00,148
I am in command here.
You will do as I say.

540
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,559
Both of you.

541
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,358
Stay where you are!

542
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,032
It's time we
programmed your brain

543
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,873
to be a bit more productive.

544
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:19,394
Captain...?
Yes, that's who you really are.

545
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:22,552
I'm not the captain,
I'm your superior.

546
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:27,674
- Adam, please...
- I told you to keep away!

547
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,956
Don't do that!

548
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,830
You must learn to obey.

549
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:39,871
- It's not your fault, Hector.
- Turn around.

550
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,194
- It's not James' fault.
- Turn around!

551
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,118
It's everybody's fault.

552
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:03,671
No, No! This is...

553
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,317
Hello, there.
This is your captain speaking.

554
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,631
I trust you're enjoying
the ongoing flight situation.

555
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:44,111
We hope you're going to fly
World Spaceways again and again.

556
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:47,636
Duty-free goods
will be closing shortly.

557
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:50,951
Right now, I suggest
you walk to the ports

558
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:56,910
to get ready for a swell view
of Mother Earth coming up.

559
