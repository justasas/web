00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,514
JOURNEY TO SATURN

2
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,319
No! My beer!
What the hell...

3
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,154
Dear Denmark. Dear Danes.

4
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:08,037
In less than 24 hours, the greatest
event in our history will take place:

5
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,232
Kurt Maj's Satum Expedition!

6
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,479
The purpose is to find
eco-friendly energy resources -

7
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,310
- that will benefit people on Earth
and the Danish welfare state.

8
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,876
We transmit live from Cape Kurt.

9
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,837
But let's have a closer Icok
at the project's creator: Kurt Maj!

10
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,478
Kurt Maj, tyccon and media kingpin,
is a man of many talents.

11
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,229
Deeply affected by the rapidly
escalating global warming, -

12
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,355
- Kurt Maj has made it his personal
cause to fight for the environment.

13
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,714
And now he is on his way
to the stars - always the pioneer!

14
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,149
You're on in ten minutes, Per.
How's the suit?

15
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,150
Well, it's not as cool as the one
I wore for NASA's Mars Mission.

16
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,319
But then again, I'm not exactly
going on a 48 hour space walk, am I?

17
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,559
You're so cool, Per.

18
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,909
You and me, Per. Forever!

19
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,518
DANISH UFO ASSOCIATION
ANNUAL CONVENTION

20
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,630
Per! Per! Per! Per!

21
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,110
And now,
the man we've all been waiting for:

22
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,155
Lecturer and real-life astronaut:
Per Jensen!

23
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,832
- When the stars beckon...
- Here we come!

24
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,319
Per! Per! Per! Per!

25
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,556
...that you cannot refuse.

26
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,788
Drop by Earth and let's chat.
I look forward to meeting you.

27
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,468
NAME FILE:

28
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,756
- Mr. Maj! Over here?
- Showtime!

29
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,959
Dear Denmark. Dear Danes.

30
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,995
In just a few hours, Kurt Maj's
Saturn Expedition will be a reality.

31
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,037
What has inspired this heroic deed?

32
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,677
Ever since Cape Kurt discovered
limitless resources on Saturn, -

33
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,513
- I knew that Denmark would have
to claim exclusive rights to these.

34
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,193
It is therefore of vital importance
to claim that planet for Denmark!

35
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,439
Isn't this project of greater benefit
to you than Denmark as such?

36
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,033
Rubbish!

37
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,997
Kurt Maj Enterprises has financed
the project as a national gift.

38
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,751
- But...
- Imagine all those riches!

39
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,990
It will be the end of taxes,
and the beginning of greater welfare.

40
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,391
Mr. Maj, we have a problem.
Our navigator has fallen ill.

41
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,512
It seems to be food poisoning.

42
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,395
Caused by this
Kurt Maj TV Dinner.

43
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:19,153
But he's being treated by the Danish
Medical Services, so all is well.

44
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,393
- How will we find a new navigator?
- Go over the list once more.

45
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,670
Try to squeeze its tummy.
How many do you want?

46
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,830
The crew could have perished
from lack of oxygen or small pox.

47
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,315
Voila! There you go.

48
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,913
- I'll never bathe again.
- No, why start now?

49
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,150
CONTRACT

50
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,956
- What the hell is this?
- Kurt Maj and Denmark need you!

51
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,675
- Say what?
- We need a new navigator.

52
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,158
- And you're the man for the job.
- Do you want me to go to Saturn?

53
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,636
- Please follow us.
- It's urgent.

54
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,311
Yes, but... I haven't got the time
just here and now.

55
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,957
I have lots of plans.
Laundry and TV... Time is running.

56
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,799
I'll have to leave. Goodbye.

57
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,839
What's your problem, Jensen?
You are a trained astronaut, right?

58
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,950
When the stars beckon,
I will be there!

59
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,194
- I guess I could serve my country.
- Perfect!

60
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,191
- We knew we could count on you.
- No problem. I'll just call a cab.

61
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,551
I'll meet you out front in ten...

62
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,515
- We have some transportation.
- But I need to go home first.

63
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,670
- Go forit, Per!
- I need to cut my toe nails.

64
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,593
I need to have that board sanded
before I leave, or...

65
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,515
- Wait...
- Bye, bye.

66
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,758
Welcome aboard, Per.
Let's have a nice chat now.

67
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,834
This is our command center.

68
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,272
The best brains in the nation
are gathered here.

69
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,349
That computer has been programmed
to bring you all the way to Saturn.

70
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,472
So you are just a safety measure.

71
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,836
- What are the chances of a mishap?
- Zero percent!

72
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,637
Besides, your commander, Skrydsbøl,
is a distinguished soldier.

73
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,549
You will not find a more steady man.

74
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,834
- You've disgraced the Army.
- You've failed us.

75
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,316
You are a failure, Skrydsbøl.

76
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,750
Basra!

77
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,639
THE MISSION COMES FIRST

78
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,552
Arne? Where are you?

79
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,634
- Help me, Ame... Arne...
- Gerd! Gerd!

80
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,393
Get away from him, you bastards!
I'm coming, Gerd!

81
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,029
- The reading materials you asked for.
- Die, you filthy Al Qaeda combatant!

82
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,193
Skrydsbøl is known to run
a tight ship on all of his missions.

83
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,234
Arne Skrydsbøl at your service.
If I may be so bold as to say...

84
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,195
- You'll make a great team.
- I promise you, I will not fail...

85
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,790
It'll just need to be cleared.
Hold on.

86
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,391
Hello? They're in the third matrix
of the launch coordinates.

87
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,232
No, in the third...
Well, then look at the binary code!

88
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,716
Susanne speaking. Right, I've heard.
They're looking for a new navigator.

89
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,799
You want me to...?
I'll be there right away. Yes!

90
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,116
Susanne, welcome aboard.
As always, a sight for sore eyes.

91
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,630
I'm glad you thought of me.

92
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,597
I've always wanted to go
on a space mission. I'll do my best.

93
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,591
No! Susanne, my sweet...
You know we can't send you out there.

94
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,633
- Why you are...
- I'm what?

95
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,231
- I'm your technical director.
- No, it just won't work.

96
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,353
You brighten up the premises
down here. We've chosen this guy.

97
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,115
- Per?
- Susanne? We used to be lovers.

98
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,839
- We went to the Astronaut Academy.
- Then you're the perfect team.

99
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:04,593
Per is, to put it mildly, not suited
for an expedition of this magnitude.

100
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,319
Fiddlesticks.
Per is a true man of the people.

101
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,875
Per is a fucking fraud!

102
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,437
The closest thing he ever got to space
was when we watched Star Wars!

103
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,270
Why do you insist on hiring the most
incompetent idiots for the expedition?

104
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,474
I hope you know
what the flipping hell you're doing!

105
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,275
I guess someone
is on the rag today.

106
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,875
Susanne Mortensen speaking,
technical director of Project Saturn.

107
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,153
I need the exam papers from
Space Academy for a Per Jensen.

108
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,115
Yes, right now. Well, then you'll
just have to wake the security guard!

109
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,112
TIME FOR LIFT OFF!!

110
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,514
Ladies and gentlemen:

111
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,678
Ourbeloved Queen of Denmark...
and the Prince Consort.

112
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,670
Accompanied
by our dear Prime Minister.

113
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,715
Oh la la.
Exquisite taste, Monsieur.

114
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,870
I'd like to stress a point here:
I demand strict discipline.

115
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,676
As representatives of Denmark,
we will be part of history forever.

116
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,959
Please welcome: Arne Skrydsbøl
and two of Denmarks's finest pilots.

117
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,119
And finally,
the experienced astronaut, Per Jensen.

118
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,799
Here you are, Madam.

119
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,192
Hello, beautiful!

120
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,676
Don't just stand there dawdling, men.
All aboard now! Hup, hup, hup, hup!

121
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,992
Wait! Do I have time to take a crap?
Just a teeny-weeny crap?

122
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,030
Aproper hello to you.
I'm Jamil, your cook on this trip.

123
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,677
Hi, there. My name is Per
and I'm the new navigator.

124
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,193
- Don't worry, I'll get you to Saturn.
- Come here.

125
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,633
A cheese sandwich with jelly and cress
or a Company Sandwich?

126
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,469
Isn't that a Club Sandwich?

127
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,073
- Hey, it's alright.
- No, it's important that I learn.

128
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,035
I flunked the Danish Citizen Test
but if I work hard on this trip -

129
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,994
- and learn to be a real Dane,
they promised me a second chance.

130
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,671
Then I'll bring my family up here and
we'll open a classy restaurant. Look!

131
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,677
HOT DOGS

132
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,317
Howdy ho, space homos!

133
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,194
Yo ho, you two Princesses. Now it's
hot-ass-mothafuckin' party time!

134
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,676
Ole is in charge of supplies.

135
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,317
Here's a bit of high culture
for your Danish Test, Jamil.

136
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,308
It's German, but we do it much
in the same way here in Denmark.

137
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,230
- I'm not sure my wife would approve.
- Come on, man!

138
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,831
Saucy young chicks!
Are those girls you've been porking?

139
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,157
You son of a dog! I'll butcher you
halal style and feed you to the rats!

140
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,035
- I just want to be your pork partner!
- These are my family photos!

141
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,310
Time out, boys.

142
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,752
Gorm the Old, Harald Bluetooth,
Sweyn Forkbeard, Harald II, -

143
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,670
- Canute the Great...
I'm sorry.

144
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,796
I was way too sensitive. Areal
Dane can handle insults and taunts.

145
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,198
You're absolutely right there,
my little monkey boy.

146
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,872
- You fat... You big, fat bastard.
- Right on!

147
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,998
Stand by for lift off.
Man your stations.

148
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,958
Sergeant Skrydsbøl.
Wait a second.

149
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,280
We've got T minus 4 minutes and 12
to lift off! It is a clear violation.

150
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,838
- You must read it before lift off.
- Is it cleared according to protocol?

151
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:29,195
- No, but it contains...
- It can be contaminated with anthrax!

152
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,313
- But it's about Per. He's...
- Brief me when we're airborne.

153
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,918
Now, let's have a bitchin'
awesome heck of a party! Here.

154
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,669
Beer. The favourite
soft drink of the Danes.

155
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,156
Beer is a pacifier, not a satisfier.

156
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,554
Balthazar!

157
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,952
No, Balthazar!
Come back here!

158
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,958
10, 9, 8, 7...

159
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,358
Main bcoster start.
4, 3, 2, 1...

160
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,517
Lift off!

161
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,591
Mon cherie!

162
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,030
Man, this sure is enough to make
your asshole rock and shake, ain't it?

163
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,679
Mr. Maj, look overhere.

164
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,594
Owr, but really...

165
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,352
ACCESS DENIED

166
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:41,556
Kurt Maj, look over here.
Mr. Prime Minister, look at the duck.

167
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,878
Mr. Maj, I seem to have a problem
with protocol 314.

168
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,471
It's a video, but I can't access it.
And I've never heard of it before.

169
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,638
Don't trouble your pretty head
with that technical stuff.

170
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,753
But I'm Technical Director, Mr. Maj.

171
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,874
What's the protocol on knocking
before approaching your superior?

172
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,676
- That... yo shod knock fisth?
- Exactly.

173
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,350
If this had been Kabul, your mother
would've had you back in a body bag.

174
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,032
Look me in the eyes.
I knew it! You've got it.

175
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,915
The look of death. We've
stared death straight in the eyes.

176
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,591
You never forget your first time, huh?
The first kill!

177
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,078
Mine was in Beirut '82. Them were
the days. How many kills have you had?

178
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,389
That is... two... eh,
fifty... ninety!

179
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,675
It's an honour to have you aboard.
Let's have a real astronaut chat.

180
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,795
Yes, definitely. I just have
to check some... navigation stuff.

181
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,992
That's right, Per.
The mission comes first!

182
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,674
What a beautiful cow.
Please sit down.

183
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,354
- Bratwurst?
- So big!

184
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,438
I just love that movie, dude! Ole
has to watch it at least once a day.

185
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,754
Then little Ole will come out to play.
And for a dollar, I'll let you watch.

186
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,272
Aah, pussy, wonderful pussy.
Let's have some pussy...

187
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,510
See what I've made, dude.
Apee bubble! Made of pee!

188
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,712
Yikes! Get that thing away from me.

189
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,390
- It's just like urine squash!
- No! My photos!

190
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,634
- Ole's invented a new sport with pee!
- I'll be damned...

191
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,831
Be quiet!

192
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,634
Yuck, shame on you!

193
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,630
That's what comes from having such
a... wog aboard this craft. Yuck!

194
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,274
I expect discipline on this mission!

195
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,678
In the Gulf, we didn't have any
of this stinking monkey business!

196
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,598
HOT DOGS

197
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,231
They're almost there.

198
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,837
All hands on deck!
ETA on Saturn in T minus 15 minutes.

199
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,836
Ready for landing?

200
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,873
Say, what are you doing?

201
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,838
I'm ready to put on my helmet in case
of... a cute decompression symptoms?

202
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,473
Of course! Why didn't I think of that?
Good point, Per.

203
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,468
Touchdown. Welcome to Saturn.

204
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,834
Good! Form formation
"The Capture of Saturn". All hands!

205
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,596
I hereby raise this flag as a symbol
of the Danish colonization of Saturn.

206
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:04,874
For King, Country... No, for God,
King, and Country. Yes, I'm ready.

207
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,396
God save our gracious King...

208
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,158
No, dammit!

209
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,037
And here is Denmark,
and here is Denmark, olé, olé, olé.

210
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,516
This is a clearbreach of the chain
of command! Turn that thing off!

211
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,948
From the top!

212
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,077
Hey ho, here we go,
d'ya want Ole's cock, you filthy ho?

213
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,468
And Ole... Ole...

214
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,760
Don't worry. It's under control.
Give me your wristwatches.

215
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,750
We, the White Gods, bring you gifts
as a token of our good intentions.

216
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,396
Obey us, or we'll use our fire sticks!

217
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,036
They don't like you shouting at them.

218
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,392
Fiddlesticks. Primitive civilizations
need to know who's in charge.

219
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,716
- Hear, hear!
- They don't seem primitive.

220
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,072
We come from a highly developed
country called Denmark.

221
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,354
We want to use your natural resources
for our high technological machinery.

222
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:10,430
We'll teach you about democracy and
freedom of speech. Great spin-off!

223
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,708
See how he turned hostile
when I talked about freedom of speech.

224
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,717
It's the way you say it.

225
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,596
Draw your weapons! Let's see how they
like good, old-fashioned brute force!

226
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,519
- Bad idea!
- Basra!

227
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,919
Dang it! Ouch!
I don't believe it. My triggerfinger!

228
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,469
Shit!

229
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,748
The closest planet we could find is in
the Solaris cloud, just 12 years...

230
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,390
Get to the point!
What is the size of its water supply?

231
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,672
- Two percent.
- Two percent?

232
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,998
But we have sucked all
the other planets in the galaxy dry.

233
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,638
You idiot! Two percent will not even
keep the army going for a week!

234
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,432
Bless you...

235
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,590
Beloved Dictator, we have captured
this gang of aliens.

236
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,669
We demand to be treated in accordance
with the Geneva Convention...

237
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,309
...our military rights.
- Insert the translators now!

238
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,354
Let me go, you terrorist bastard.
This is utterly...

239
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,394
They don't have an orifice
in their back forthe translators.

240
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,593
They must have an incredibly
primitive DNA structure.

241
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,590
Hey, wait! There's an orifice
furtherdown. Roll in the machinery.

242
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,551
Oh, yes!
A little more to the left, please.

243
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,995
Tell me where you come from.

244
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,077
Just state your name,
rank and home port.

245
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,670
Arne Skrydsbøl, sergeant in the Navy,
Planet Earth.

246
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,432
- What business have you on Saturn?
- Arne Skrydsbøl, sergeant, Earth.

247
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,838
- Are the translators fitted right?
- Fuck, that hurt!

248
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:51,158
- It should work perfectly.
- Take them away.

249
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,796
Bring them back when it's time
for dinner. You two, follow me.

250
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,592
Hopelessly outdated.

251
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,118
What's he saying?

252
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,517
...I've kept an eye on you since
my first test probes reached Saturn.

253
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,110
I know that water is
of vital importance to you, -

254
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,919
- yet you have problems procuring it.
Allow me to present, Planet Earth.

255
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,392
Earth, known as the Blue Planet.

256
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:02,630
78% of it is covered in water...
just waiting to be sucked up.

257
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:09,757
This is an offer you cannot refuse.
Drop by Earth, and we'll discuss this.

258
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,679
I look forward to meeting you.

259
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,513
Strip this sorry craft of everything,
and then prepare my spaceship.

260
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,196
Where the hell are they?

261
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,592
- They went out to stretch their legs.
- They should have been back by now.

262
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,318
Hey! That might be them.

263
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,236
What?

264
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,035
Oopsy doopsy...

265
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,915
There goes all of our communication!

266
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,999
I won't stand for that tone of voice.
Accidents may happen, you know.

267
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,718
It'll take days to re-establish
connections. That was our only server.

268
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,869
Annoying, isn't it?
Well, I'm sure you'll figure it out.

269
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,275
Come here.
We have a pretty gift for you.

270
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,278
Gu ga gu ga gu ga.

271
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,471
Well, horrible testicle torture is an
unavoidable aspect in ourbusiness.

272
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,549
Just see is as a work hazard.
That makes it all easier.

273
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,557
Cheers, Ole.

274
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,440
My last one! It should join the rest
of the Brewsky family in my belly.

275
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,077
I'm like a beautiful flower.
I need a beer or I'll wither away.

276
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,556
- I'm withering away!
- What are you doing?

277
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,880
I think our prison cell is made
of frozen metallic gas.

278
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,712
It has crystallized and appears hard
but vaporizes if exposed to alcohol.

279
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:10,119
- How did you know?
- I am a doctor of nuclear physics.

280
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,474
Any porch monkey can claim that.
Let's rock'n'roll, boys!

281
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,031
- Hold it! Prison break!
- Basra!

282
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,833
Great teamwork.
Let's go! Hup, hup, hup.

283
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,275
- They seem to be getting ready.
- But for what?

284
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,191
- Look! Our spaceship.
- And there's the boss dude.

285
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,075
Satum Force One, departure!

286
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,590
Destination: Planet Earth.

287
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,633
- Earth?
- Operation Suck Earth Dry.

288
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,276
Proceed to hut 3
and await the Dictator's signal.

289
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,268
- Suck Earth Dry?
- Sounds kinky!

290
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,758
Aha! The Dictatoris on his way
to Earth to launch an invasion.

291
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,238
- I knew it was a rogue state!
- Look at that giant vacuum cleaner.

292
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,194
If he reaches Earth and transmits
the signal, it would mean...

293
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,793
- The End of the World!
- We'll put an end to that.

294
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,475
Move over, boys!
Time for some boobs and beer.

295
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,550
I found this in the Earthlings' craft.

296
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,231
Some outmoded audio-visual media
based on electromagnetic currents.

297
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:25,353
This seems to be a manual
in the customs of the Earthlings.

298
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,914
Interesting.

299
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,948
Ouch, that fucking shit!

300
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,991
And then there's a slight ascend,
which you stick to for ten minutes...

301
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,352
Saturn mission to Cape Kurt, come in.

302
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,597
Per, let's get this baby in the air
so we can eliminate that UFO.

303
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,555
I haven't had much practice with this
model... I'm used to the Apollo type.

304
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,958
You and I have the look of death.
Rememberthat.

305
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,911
It's always nice
to have a clearview, right?

306
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,032
Per, hurry up!

307
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,629
HANDBRAKE

308
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,669
Tilt, Per! Tilt!

309
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,795
What's the matter with you, kid?
Don't worry. I'll take it from here.

310
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,596
I flew the Hercules planes
when we carpet-bombed Beograd.

311
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,793
Post-traumatic stress disorder after
dangerous missions is quite common.

312
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,119
Ouch, that old fucking piece of shit!

313
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,672
Yes! Come on. Expedition,
Cape Kurt calling. Can you hear me?

314
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,872
- Hello.
- Per, is that you?

315
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:22,677
This is George from the Short Wave
Radio Club. Any kinky girls on line?

316
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,197
Hello? Hello...

317
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,030
Ole has totally freaked out.

318
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,388
The enemy is in sight!

319
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,669
The Earthlings' spacecraft!
It's gaining on us.

320
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,440
Let them come.

321
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,753
Fire! And not just a warning shot
either. Just throw it right at them.

322
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,159
They're gone.

323
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,275
- Contact! Per, eliminate them.
- What?

324
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,791
- Let me have a shot at it.
- You know dog fights too, Mr. 9/11?

325
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,757
No, three years in the accommodation
centre. PlayStation, see?

326
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,631
- Way to go, Jamil. Bull's eye!
- The UFO seems to be unharmed.

327
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,429
They don't stand a chance
against our deflector shield.

328
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,519
Give me an estimate of the steering
system of their pathetic vessel.

329
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,030
- A black hole. It's sucking us in!
- Arne, turn the wheel!

330
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,392
Way to go, Arne!

331
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,196
- Red alert!
- Take over. I'll check the air lock.

332
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,796
Red alert! Red alert!

333
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,036
CONFIDENTIAL

334
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,828
Per, would you please come with me?

335
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,955
Just activate the jet pack, scoot over
to the UFO and attach the explosives.

336
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,836
- Have you gone mad, man?
- Don't worry, Per.

337
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,318
This should be a piece of cake
for a seasoned astronaut like you.

338
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,478
Wait!
I'm not an astronaut.

339
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,912
I've never been to space before.
I don't know how to ride a jet pack!

340
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,398
I've known that
from the moment I saw you.

341
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,232
Arne Skrydsbøl has a keen eye.
You smell like a con man.

342
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,716
- Arne, I can explain it all...
- No, you cannot!

343
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,749
- Know... who sailed Olfert Fischer?
- An ole fart?

344
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,829
- Hello?
- Shot them... call it friendly fire.

345
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,473
Can you hear me?

346
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,708
- Arne, this is dangerous!
- You've endangered the mission.

347
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,435
What with your lies
and fake exam papers.

348
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,156
- Wait! I lied for a reason.
- It had better be a good reason.

349
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:10,708
- I lied because I was in love.
- I see. That's the worst excuse ever!

350
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,711
- Have you never been in love, Arne?
- I was close to my pup, Dick Cheney.

351
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,914
- But I shot it when it ate my medals!
- I'm talking about real love, Arne.

352
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,033
Have you never been so madly in love
that it hurts just to see her?

353
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,837
That's how I felt about Susanne. She'd
just been accepted into the Academy.

354
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,591
I thought, "I'm will be an astronaut,
too." Just to be close to her.

355
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,758
But I flunked all the tests.

356
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,953
Get to the point, or I shoot you
in the head like little Dick Cheney.

357
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,234
So I started cheating to impress her.
Yes, I tampered with my exam papers.

358
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,150
No Dane with any kind of space slash
military training is fooled by a con.

359
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:59,195
Yes. She was mad about me,
and everything was just great.

360
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,836
Then she found out I had cheated
and went totally ballistic.

361
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,989
She said I was a disgrace to the space
program. She never understood.

362
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,397
I didn't give a fuck about the space
program. I just wanted to be with her.

363
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,709
You activate the bomb
on the red button.

364
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,556
No!

365
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,191
Oh, no!

366
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,198
- Where's Per?
- There.

367
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,436
It's always nice to have a clear view,
right, Per?

368
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,756
Activate the jet pack, you idiot!

369
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,110
Hell bloody!

370
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,269
- Oh, no.
- No more games.

371
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,433
What kind of abomination is this?

372
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,237
Some sort of advanced remote control.
They've taken over our control system.

373
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,916
What the fuck are you up to?

374
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,796
Goodbye.

375
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,793
Get us away from here!

376
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,039
Typical!

377
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,394
Per!

378
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:14,229
- You are a trained astronaut, right?
- We'll be a part of history forever.

379
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,430
- You're so cool, Per!
- You smell like a con man.

380
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,873
- Per is a genuine man of the people.
- Per is a fucking fraud!

381
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,148
Susanne!

382
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,229
Susanne... no!

383
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,073
Per! Oh, no, it's all my fault.

384
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,192
Bloody hell! The autopilot is down
with a fatal error.

385
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,678
This is a crisis situation.
We'll never make it back to Earth.

386
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,759
- What happened to Per?
- He was sucked into the black hole.

387
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,748
- We have to go in after him.
- A suicide mission? You'd like that!

388
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,717
- We have to try.
- Arne, where are you?

389
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,435
Ame, for fuck's sake!

390
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,272
The mission always comes first!
Per failed us. I can do nothing!

391
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,238
- What the hell is wrong now?
- We've run out of gas.

392
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,915
Well, you'll have it your way then.

393
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,599
Beloved Mr. Dictator,
we're entering the Earth's atmosphere.

394
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,793
He was right. They've got enough water
to keep the fleet running in 20 years.

395
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,992
Send the co-ordinates
to the invasion force.

396
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,590
I don't know what so say, but I think
something has gone terribly wrong.

397
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,309
- What's going on?
- Someone is entering the atmosphere.

398
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,317
Oh, no!

399
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,828
Six. One, two, three, four... Oh, no.

400
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,953
Oops, Mr. Prime Minister,
this is going to be expensive.

401
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,073
We'll just cut back on the care of
our senior citizens again this year.

402
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:47,149
- Mr. Maj.
- Susanne. What an entrance.

403
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,319
Our space ship is lost, and an
unidentified vessel is approaching.

404
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,672
- I think it's hostile.
- The Danish People's Party protest.

405
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:02,153
There comes a time when you as
a citizen of this peaceful nation -

406
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,273
- will be forced to perform
the noble defence mechanism, -

407
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,268
- which we through proud generations
have resorted to again and again -

408
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,678
- and proven that we master
to perfection.

409
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,475
- Total subjection.
- What?

410
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:20,955
We're talking about cool cash here.

411
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:26,632
Imagine the export rights and
exchange of sustainable technology.

412
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:33,518
Your re-election is ensured since you
can lowertaxes and safeguard welfare.

413
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,632
You can't just do that!

414
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:41,356
Leave this to the men now,
right, you sweet little thing?

415
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:57,198
- I think we've passed through it.
- Never underestimate Danish design.

416
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:16,190
- The atmosphere is compatible.
- We're really out in the sticks, huh?

417
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,669
We have to survey the area and
find fuel, if Denmark is to be saved.

418
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,953
Look! Alight.

419
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:35,758
DENMARK HAS VISITORS
FROM SPACE

420
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,235
Cheers!

421
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,554
I'm so horny.

422
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,598
We want to cum in the ass
of all your girls.

423
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:01,592
Give me your big cock.
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

424
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,276
Dear Danes!
Let's welcome our new allies.

425
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,235
These fascinating beings have come to
negotiate the future export of goods.

426
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,959
Of all nations on Earth they chose us.
Because Danish goods are the best!

427
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,632
If we enter into this agreement, -

428
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,356
- then early retirement is guaranteed
for all further generations.

429
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,069
That's not true!

430
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,798
The aliens are hostile.
They've murdered our astronauts!

431
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,232
Well, as soon as someone makes
a splendid initiative -

432
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,034
- that will create prosperity, -

433
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:01,189
- the leftwinged, paranoid eco-freaks
crawl out of their filthy wood works.

434
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,109
Some people will always be naysayers,
when it comes to progress, -

435
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:11,475
- but real Danes will agree that those
who try to slow progress are traitors!

436
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,639
- You fucking communist!
- Filthy bitch!

437
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,719
But where is
the Saturn Expedition then?

438
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,593
Traitor!

439
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,713
- Welcome to Earth.
- Prepare a translator.

440
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,833
Attention! This looks like
a cultural leftist art installation.

441
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,508
Hey, there's a doorbell.

442
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,312
OUR FATHER & SONS

443
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,950
I'm Saint Peter, and I can smell
your earthly vessels from in here.

444
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,994
No time to chat, Santa Claus. We're
on a mission and have run out of gas.

445
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:24,878
Gas? I don't know anything about that.
But... come on in and ask.

446
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,631
HEAVEN

447
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,796
Just make your inquiry
at the counter over yonder.

448
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,113
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, -

449
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,472
- so take off your boots
so as not to drag your dust in here.

450
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:00,073
We need gas.
I demand to talk to your superior.

451
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,551
It's him.

452
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:18,108
Yo, what's up, guys?
Want a guided tour of the garden?

453
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,711
I'm willing to help you suck up
all the water from Earth.

454
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,878
The oceans, the ground water,
the whole shebang.

455
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:33,270
- And what do you expect in return?
- I want the island of Greenland.

456
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:40,676
The Kurt Maj Drink is top notch.
It's made from pure Greenland ice.

457
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,795
The Kurt Maj drink,
the only water.

458
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,275
399 $ a bottle.

459
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,076
When you've sucked up all the water,
it'll be more valuable than gold.

460
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,912
People have to drink Kurt Maj Drink.
I already extracted large quantities -

461
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:04,513
- and stored it at different spots all
over the world. Have a Kurt Maj drink!

462
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,230
You can't do that!

463
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,596
Kill her.

464
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,279
CATALOGUE OF SINS

465
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:03,915
- Excuse me, are you Jesus?
- No, man. I'm Stand-in Jesus.

466
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,874
My older brother is on Earth
trying to make a comeback.

467
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:12,232
The old man is making an effort
to get the business booming again.

468
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,389
We haven't had much following
these days.

469
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,075
Disgusting!
Sexually deviant mutants with wings.

470
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,399
ADULTERY - DECEIT
TAX FRAUD

471
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:32,229
Yes! Alright!

472
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,035
SEX DRUGS
AND ROCK'N'ROLL

473
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,432
Hell changed its marketing strategy
from eternal punishment and misery.

474
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,791
Now their slogan is:
"Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll."

475
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,869
- How can you compete with that?
- Let me go, you disgusting cockatoo!

476
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,278
- Look!
- Let go of me, for fuck's sake!

477
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,393
- I haven't got the time to be dead.
- Hey, Per.

478
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:04,116
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Where have you been, Per?

479
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,518
- Little Per, my friend.
- It's worse than the IRS up here.

480
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,032
I told them I had to return, but
they asked for a load of papers...

481
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,313
- Oh, no. You're not dead, are you?
- No.

482
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,196
- What about the UFO?
- Well, it got away, didn't it?

483
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,836
Let's just find some gas
and blow this hippie commune.

484
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:30,636
We don't have stuff like that up here.
The whole place is wind-powered.

485
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:36,437
- God Almighty!
- You must help us save Earth.

486
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,156
Earth?
But that's our entire clientele.

487
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,956
Say, the Holy Ghost might
be able to help you.

488
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,312
What do we need that for?
Ouch, you filthy little creep!

489
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:00,958
- They're flying vermin.
- Easy now. Trust me.

490
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,309
ANGEL PUSSY

491
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,718
Unfortunately,
these guys have to return.

492
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,759
- Good luck with it all, then.
- Likewise.

493
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,999
- Where do you think you're going?
- What do you mean?

494
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:26,150
Our policy is strict: Once you've died
and gone to Heaven, that's it!

495
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:30,035
- I'm not even a member of the Church.
- What the hell?

496
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,758
Fuck off, you fucking parasite!

497
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:46,960
- Where's it going? Come back.
- Filthy shit bird.

498
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:09,033
It's a gas station! Right on!

499
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:25,636
- Look. They sell Danish beer.
- Beer?

500
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,798
Brewsky!

501
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,110
Yes!

502
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,118
- Well, Arne. It's filled up.
- And so what?

503
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:52,279
We have no autopilot,
and our navigator is an impostor!

504
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,872
Right on!

505
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,509
- This beer's heavy.
- Per's never here for manual labour!

506
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,509
Aviation deck, check.
Flaps, check. Engine burst, check.

507
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:23,190
We're ready for lift off.

508
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,349
I found the manual. Just push start,
and we're headed right for Earth.

509
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,635
Well, let's go then, Per.

510
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,909
Alright, when the stars beckon,
here we fucking come.

511
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:17,432
We're flying at 20 times normal speed.

512
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:22,794
Do we need these translators anymore?
I'm so sore in my butt.

513
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,355
It might contain info about the enemy.

514
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,075
Keep it up there, and you'll pass
the Dane test the next time.

515
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,873
Well, boys. We're almost home.

516
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,438
Hello. Per, is that you?

517
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,428
I thought you were dead.
How did you find your way back?

518
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:21,760
Per handled that. He turned out
to be an outstanding navigator.

519
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:35,229
- Susanne, has the UFO arrived?
- Yes, but I've...

520
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,911
- The invasion fleet is on its way.
- The invasion fleet?

521
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,237
Did the dictator
bring a remote control?

522
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,560
Of course! The dictator uses
the remote control -

523
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,753
- to log unto the operative system
of other spacecrafts and control them.

524
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,839
If you could get hold of it, we may
be able to stop the entire UFO fleet.

525
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:01,318
- Okay. I'll do my best.
- We'll come as fast as we can.

526
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:08,634
So this is where you're hiding,
right in an intergalactic date.

527
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,957
- How sweet.
- Leave her alone!

528
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:18,235
When the stars beckon,
then big, bad Per is on his way!

529
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:23,355
Why do you think I picked a bunch
of losers and a bumed-out soldier?

530
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:28,680
You're good for nothing, and that made
you perfect for my little mission.

531
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,634
Wish I had time to chat,
but I've got a planet to suck dry.

532
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,957
Say goodbye to Susanne now.

533
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:44,270
- I thought you'd done away with them.
- They don't know what they're in for.

534
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,671
Put the pedal to the metal. Let's go!

535
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:01,236
- Where did that come from?
- We're dead meat, boys.

536
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,191
We'll hit the moon. Shit! This is
going to be one tough crash landing!

537
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,628
Oh, no. The invasion fleet.

538
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:42,229
Why did I join this shitty mission?
I'll never see my dear family again.

539
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:46,399
I've lost everything
for fucking Denemarci!

540
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:50,878
Sandwiches, beer and crappy soccer!
You can't even beat the Swedes!

541
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:55,278
And silly proverbs! Who the hell
lives in a house of glass?

542
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:01,077
And who wants one bird in the hand?
It's a shitty nation!

543
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,794
I have to speak to my God.

544
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,279
- Where the heck is Mecca?
- Just face Earth. That should do it.

545
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:41,669
This is the perfect place to erect
your water exploitation machine.

546
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,031
You can't just take the water
on Earth. It belongs to all of us.

547
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:51,713
- You get the Kurt Maj Drink instead.
- But ordinary people can't afford it.

548
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,593
Then they'd better start saving up.

549
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:58,759
A strong signal on our radars seems
to indicate more incoming UFOs.

550
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,872
It's almost an army.

551
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,189
- So many to build that machine?
- My soldiers won't building anything.

552
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,640
We'll have slaves do the work!

553
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,189
Never point a thing like that at
other people. It's fucking dangerous.

554
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,390
Hold it right there!
We're on our way to Earth -

555
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,718
- to stop an alien invasion, and we
don't have time for your foolishness.

556
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:31,912
Work is progressing at a steady pace.
We expect to be ready in 24 hours.

557
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:36,352
- You have 12.
- Danes can't work any faster.

558
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:41,918
Their work ethic has deteriorated from
decades of being public employees.

559
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:48,355
Wrong answer. You're in charge now.
You've got 12 hours, understood?

560
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,279
Start the countdown!

561
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:02,473
Hey, kabob.

562
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,039
Hey, let the grown-ups have a look.

563
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,835
Hornbæk Beach. High society tits!

564
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,830
What's that?

565
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,555
It's the countdown
for the end of the world.

566
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:48,836
- Susanne!
- Someone ran off with your girl.

567
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,830
- Treachery on the home-front.
- She's been taken hostage!

568
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:57,999
At least the problem is solved. We'll
nuke the platform and be heroes.

569
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:03,354
- We can't! Susanne is down there.
- Let me tell you something, Per!

570
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:08,111
I've only had one true friend,
Gerd, my second in command.

571
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,996
During a mission in Basra,
he was caught in enemy crossfire.

572
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,478
I could either complete the mission
or save Gerd. I chose Gerd.

573
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:22,800
If Gerd died, I wouldn't have anyone
left in my life. Nobody!

574
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,116
It didn't work.
The mission went totally awry.

575
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:30,153
Arne!

576
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:36,913
Gerd was killed. 60 bullets. I was
demoted from colonel to sergeant.

577
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:41,716
I'd forgotten the most important rule
in the army: The mission comes first.

578
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,435
But this is my chance
to make it right!

579
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,838
That's not right, Arne. You went
through the black hole to save me.

580
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,679
It wasn't quite like that.

581
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,795
I get your point about not nuking
anybody, but how can we stop them?

582
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:04,109
Kurt Maj had a point.
We are just a bunch of losers.

583
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,430
We didn't get this far just to end up
nuking hundreds of innocent people.

584
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,712
Did we at any time
have the odds in our favour?

585
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,515
Would a bunch of losers have survived
everything we've been through?

586
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:25,156
We aren't losers. We're astronauts.

587
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,558
We represent Denmark
in the entire universe-

588
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,151
- and Denmark doesn't nuke innocent
people just to serve a greater cause.

589
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,359
- I suggest we put it to the vote.
- Danish democracy is the thing!

590
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,348
All in favour of saving Denmark
in a humane way.

591
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,269
- Hear, hear!
- Utter foolishness!

592
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:04,829
- Per, do we have a plan?
- No. But I know someone who might.

593
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,870
NEWSATURN RACE - TERRORISTS?
ALIENS DO EXIST

594
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:17,677
Mom! I was supposed to go
with the others to see the aliens.

595
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,873
I think you have some visitors, lb.

596
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,476
Coffee's served.

597
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,832
- Why did we let ourselves be fooled?
- What are we going to do?

598
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,556
Let me see. All aliens are prone to be
eliminated by some Earth stuff.

599
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:47,072
They may get the flu and die. Or
mosquito spray, shampoo, or cooties.

600
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,955
DUFO has taped everything
on the aliens since they arrived.

601
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:55,278
We've only got
an hour and a halfleft.

602
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,233
Wait! Rewind a bit.

603
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,510
There. Pause!

604
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:06,748
- Slow forward.
- How about a beer?

605
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,679
- Why, it's beer!
- Of course!

606
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,551
Yo, have a beer!

607
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,956
They're back!

608
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,755
- Per!
- If we have her, they won't touch us.

609
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,509
Keep them out of the control room.
Lead them up to the top deck.

610
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:29,032
- But how?
- Just do it. Now!

611
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,992
The suction machine!
We have to stop it. Come on, Arne!

612
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:49,030
Where is the control room?
Overhere, boys.

613
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:56,153
You! Get all these people
as far away as possible.

614
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,269
- Stop your griping, Susanne.
- Susanne!

615
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:09,031
Let's split up. Arne and Ole,
stop the engine. Jamil, come with me.

616
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,838
You stay here and fix that door.

617
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,275
Come and get me,
you oversized lizard!

618
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:39,799
Susanne!

619
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,952
Take that!

620
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:07,439
- Only ten minutes left!
- Yo!

621
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,079
Per! I'm coming!

622
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,395
Jamil...

623
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:42,469
Jamil, no!

624
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:49,472
- Jamil...
- I can't feel my legs. Cold...

625
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:54,310
Don't die! You have to become a
real Dane. We'll visit the landmarks.

626
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:58,115
I'll introduce you to Ida Davidsen and
let you taste her open sandwiches.

627
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:05,078
Per, you need to be a father
to my kids. Jamil Junior and Jamilla.

628
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:10,877
Promise me to talk to my wife, Nadja,
cousin Ali, uncle Nadim and Dina.

629
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:15,198
And my cousin and her children,
Hakim and Yassir and their wives -

630
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,198
- and Mohammad, my other cousin...

631
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:22,996
- Right, right, all of them.
- Wait, I have more pictures here.

632
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:29,438
There is a lovely country...

633
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:36,355
It didn't penetrate you.
Your photos stopped the bullet!

634
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,951
You made it!

635
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,078
Yo, greenhorn. Cheers!

636
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,952
Right on, Susanne!

637
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,957
Let's get out ofhere.

638
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:21,358
We have to stop that suction machine.

639
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:27,597
- What the hell does it say?
- You have to mount a translator.

640
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,430
- You can borrow mine.
- Fine, just hurry up.

641
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:24,870
- What are you up to?
- Anuclear missile is on its way.

642
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:30,154
- We just need to get out of here.
- Susanne and Ole are still up there!

643
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,989
The mission comes first.
That's the way it is.

644
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:47,113
- That sounds just about right.
- You could've told me where ite went.

645
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,228
ON/OFF

646
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,310
Why couldn't you just have read it?

647
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:11,637
- Susanne!
- Per!

648
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:19,917
You were so good up there! Why didn't
you just come right out and say it?

649
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,839
I thought you were a lame smartass...

650
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:27,113
Not now!
There's a nuclear missile on its way.

651
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,759
Basra!

652
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,877
Arne?

653
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:54,756
I told you I only had one true friend.
I see now that's not true.

654
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,238
I've gained two new friends. Sometimes
friends come before the mission.

655
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:04,278
Alright, three friends then.

656
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,400
Run, dammit, run!

657
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,872
- Arne!
- You shall not pass, you bastard!

658
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,831
Arne!

659
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:47,158
We can't get away. He's too heavy.

660
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,236
Jamil, the gun!

661
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:55,152
Bottoms up!

662
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,198
- Right on, man!
- Yeehaw!

663
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,394
Hurry up! The missile is coming.

664
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,512
Yeehaw!

665
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:24,516
Fools! I have thousands of UFOs
left in the universe.

666
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:28,508
Did you really think it would be
that easy to beat me?

667
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,269
Shit!

668
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,434
Would a desert princess like you like
to see the palm rise at Ole's oasis?

669
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:13,431
- Bloody hell, Ole!
- Remember: Respect for traditions.

670
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:16,837
That doesn't count
when we're talking about my cousin.

671
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,316
Do you really understand Danish
if you use one of these?

672
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:29,439
- Where will we spend our honeymoon?
- We could begin with the Milky Way.

673
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:32,552
And after that
we'll just follow the stars.

674
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,518
SUSANNE HAS GOT
ATIGHT PUSSY

675
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:34,350
I sensed that something was not right
with the strangers, -

676
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:39,236
- so I decided to isolate them at
my oil field and exterminate them.

677
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:44,036
It was a tough battle, but my plan
worked. I had them exterminated.

678
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:49,598
And now: Kurt Maj Enterprises has
always been very keen -

679
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,236
- on getting cheap, alternative
energy resources forthe Danes.

680
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:59,436
So let me introduce my latest project:
The Journey to the Sun!

681
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:16,390
THE END

682
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:08,713
What the hell? They haven't
been true to the comic at all!

683
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:13,312
THE END
