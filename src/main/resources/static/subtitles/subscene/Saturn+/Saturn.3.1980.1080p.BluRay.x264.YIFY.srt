1
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:43,503
Captain James, your presence on Pad 73.
Immediate. Urgent.

2
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:40,583
Captain James, your presence required.
Urgent. Pad 73, for immediate launch.

3
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:50,541
Launch 392. Captain James,
your presence required. Stats: Urgent.

4
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,723
Is that you, Benson?

5
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:13,042
How you doing?

6
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:17,489
So you blew the mental test?
"Potentially unstable". Huh!

7
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:26,416
I'd have been unstable, too,
getting Saturn 3.

8
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:28,760
Saturn 3...

9
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:34,972
You're not going to appeal, are you?

10
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:38,019
I wouldn't recommend it.
It's been tried before.

11
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,689
Hey, Benz, what are you doing?!
Wait a minute Benz! Holy how, stop!

12
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,112
Stop! No, B... Quick, stop!
Benz! Hold it!

13
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:08,542
Launch 392. Captain James
for Saturn 3 launch minus 5.

14
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:28,891
Launch 392. Commit minus 3.

15
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:37,804
Launch to Control. Group on board.
Commit minus 250.

16
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:44,152
Status red and counting.

17
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:47,738
You remain clear.
Let's go.

18
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:50,014
Minus 030.

19
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:53,236
Have a pleasant trip, Captain.

20
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:55,149
Minus 20.

21
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:00,361
Minus 15.

22
00:07:01,927 --> 00:07:08,486
Minus 10 and counting...
Nine, eight, seven, six, five,

23
00:07:08,487 --> 00:07:12,844
four, three, two, one...

24
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:16,516
You are entering the field of Saturn 3
Experimental Food Research Station.

25
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:20,862
Intended landers should adopt vectors
3-9 to the polar elliptic,

26
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:22,863
2-4 to the equator.

27
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:05,472
You are entering the field of Saturn 3
Experimental Food Research Station.

28
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:58,730
- Any urgent unloads?
- It can wait. - Let's get inside then.

29
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:01,253
- I'll take that.
- No.

30
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:38,179
- Is that all right in here?
- Yes.

31
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:05,389
Here's where we've been
for the last three years.

32
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,435
- Captain.
- Major.

33
00:12:20,436 --> 00:12:21,956
This is my partner.

34
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:36,783
Take a look around.
We'll lock up.

35
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:59,052
You're quite an event in our lives.

36
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:01,692
I guess you don't get
many drop-ins on Saturn 3.

37
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,682
Hardly ever, especially not from Earth.

38
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:06,115
- Hmm...
- Captain.

39
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:11,105
- What condo do you come from?
- Terminal 5.

40
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:13,754
Oh, I know 5. Where?

41
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:16,583
Far side of the East Billions.

42
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:19,613
Where were you?

43
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:22,476
I spent a couple of terms
in Billion Park.

44
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:25,223
They've cleaned it out now.
It's a dead cell.

45
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:30,195
Dead?
I didn't know that.

46
00:13:36,406 --> 00:13:39,868
- It's been a long time. This way.
- I see by your scan

47
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:42,814
- you've never been to Earth.
- No, I haven't.

48
00:13:44,163 --> 00:13:46,438
Saturn 3...
When they want to give...

49
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,537
...the Solar System an enema,
it's where they stick the tube in.

50
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:51,618
We've heard that one.

51
00:13:57,832 --> 00:13:59,629
I expected to go the laboratory.

52
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,718
We thought we'd have
a welcoming drink first.

53
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:05,190
- How's Earth, Captain?
- You get the bulletins, don't you?

54
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:07,705
You're supposed to scan and acknowledge.

55
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:09,700
We do acknowledge.

56
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,883
But we don't always scan.

57
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:14,440
No.

58
00:14:15,344 --> 00:14:18,245
- Earth is hungry.
- That's why we're here.

59
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:19,884
Your research is behind schedule.

60
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:24,823
- We're doing all we can.
- Not enough, you need help.

61
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:27,054
You're the help?

62
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,299
- No taction contact.
- You mean don't touch?

63
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:50,821
Correct.

64
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:55,181
What's in there?

65
00:14:56,951 --> 00:14:59,345
I have to sound Earth and report in.

66
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:02,015
- You can't do that.
- We're in eclipse.

67
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:05,001
Oh, yes.

68
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:08,667
No external contact
while we're shadow-locked.

69
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:11,226
- You know that.
- Of course.

70
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:14,322
- How long will it last?
- 22 days.

71
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,028
- I need some rest.
- Alex, show the Captain to his quarters.

72
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:22,799
Major.

73
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,095
Can I get you anything?
Some herbal?

74
00:15:30,355 --> 00:15:33,467
- No, I'll just take some blues and crash.
- Blues?

75
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,976
Blues. Blue dreamers.

76
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:37,682
Sleeping pills?

77
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,219
You never heard of blues?
You really lead a shut life out here, don't you?

78
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,957
I choose to be here.

79
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:52,052
Here... in case you choose to try one.

80
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:22,489
- One thing I envy him.
- What's that?

81
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,343
He's breathed.
I mean, we lead a shut life here.

82
00:16:25,344 --> 00:16:28,450
It must be really something
to go outside and breathe.

83
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:31,415
When I was last there,
if you went outside and breathed,

84
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,564
the pollution count
would rust your tubes!

85
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:39,872
- What do you think of him... the Captain?
- I don't know.

86
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:42,576
- He's funny.
- Funny?

87
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:45,474
I must have missed his best lines.

88
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:47,864
- Adam?
- Hmm?

89
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:50,019
What are blues?

90
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,007
Blues?

91
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:56,559
- Blue dreamers.
- Where did you get that?

92
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,810
From him.

93
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:01,861
He had no business giving you this.

94
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:03,295
What do they do?

95
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,386
When they send someone out alone,

96
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:08,584
they give them these
to stop them from going static.

97
00:17:08,585 --> 00:17:10,490
Did you ever take one?

98
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:14,335
- Blue dreamers?
- Did you?

99
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,918
Years ago.

100
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:21,420
- What was it like?
- Huh?

101
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:24,105
You heard me.

102
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:27,307
Interesting.

103
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:33,924
Let's try one... together.

104
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:37,715
- Maybe.
- Come on.

105
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:40,231
Please.

106
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:43,040
After he goes.

107
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:45,805
How long you think he's gonna be here?

108
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,186
No longer than I can help.

109
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:50,609
Do your best to make him
feel at home, huh?

110
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:57,555
- Sally.
- Shut in the lab.

111
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:59,230
I'll get her.

112
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:03,159
Alex!

113
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:29,494
There you are.

114
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:45,694
No!

115
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,120
No taction contact.

116
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:52,086
Come here, Sally.

117
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,873
Sally?

118
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,649
Sally, where are you?

119
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,359
Come on. Sally?

120
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,704
- It has a name?
- Of course she has a name.

121
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,183
- Haven't you had a dog?
- A few times.

122
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:09,061
Didn't they ever have names?

123
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:13,886
- Just something to eat.
- Give her to me. Don't.

124
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:18,218
It's time we get to bed, Captain.

125
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,695
Yes, you have a great body.
May I use it?

126
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:29,411
- I'm with the Major.
- For his personal consumption only?

127
00:19:30,076 --> 00:19:31,190
Yes.

128
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:34,817
That's penally unsocial on Earth,
you know that?

129
00:19:36,162 --> 00:19:39,119
Well, it's not here.
Enjoy your blues.

130
00:19:47,914 --> 00:19:49,267
Hey!

131
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,090
Problems?

132
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:55,012
Come on.

133
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:05,555
Come into my quarters.
We'll discuss your problem.

134
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:58,878
Looks like he's building his own place.

135
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,523
He's not travelling light.
Maybe I should help him.

136
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:14,211
Why?
He's here to help us.

137
00:21:15,632 --> 00:21:17,605
He's so strange.

138
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:32,186
That's a lot of stuff.
How long are you staying?

139
00:21:32,743 --> 00:21:34,227
Till I'm done.

140
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,372
Now exactly what did you got for us?

141
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:39,620
It's the best. The latest robot.

142
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:42,871
- We've got three robots.
- They're not much help.

143
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:44,538
This one's different.

144
00:21:45,665 --> 00:21:47,151
Different, huh?

145
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:52,628
It's the first of the Demi-God series.

146
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,464
Alex?
Where'd you get that name?

147
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:01,650
That's what the Major calls me.

148
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:05,255
I know why you deny me hospitality.

149
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:07,016
We offer you the run of the place.

150
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:11,215
Talking about you. Your body is beautiful.
I'd like to use it.

151
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:12,673
I'm not interested.

152
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:16,443
On Earth, we use each other bodies
to give ourselves pleasure.

153
00:23:16,444 --> 00:23:17,250
No, thanks.

154
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:21,016
You're afraid of me, aren't you?

155
00:23:21,394 --> 00:23:23,063
I'm not afraid of anyone.

156
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:26,546
You're afraid he'll be jealous.
He will be jealous.

157
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:30,286
He's frightened of new ways.
He's obsolete. He's prob...

158
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:51,598
Lights.

159
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,134
Pure brain tissue.

160
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:11,521
- Human?
- This is an unborn.

161
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:16,271
It hasn't a thing on its mind...
yet.

162
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,850
Then it has to be programmed.
It takes a human 20 years just too...

163
00:24:20,851 --> 00:24:23,648
- I'll need three to four weeks.
- Three to four weeks?

164
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:25,843
Once I gets it's head together
it will take over your program.

165
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:28,027
- Take over?
- With a little help.

166
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:31,383
- Then what?
- Then one of you will be obsolete.

167
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:44,580
We can apply for remission together,
can't we?

168
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:46,963
We have to find a way
to stay together.

169
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,932
The truth is,
I'm close to abort time.

170
00:24:54,483 --> 00:24:56,355
I hoped they'd forgotten us.

171
00:24:57,716 --> 00:24:59,299
They never seem to forget.

172
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:08,039
Obsolete...

173
00:25:12,656 --> 00:25:13,703
Alex!

174
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:15,801
I've got it.

175
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:19,470
We flush the Captain
and his friend into space.

176
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:21,907
You wouldn't do that.

177
00:25:21,908 --> 00:25:25,057
Why not? People are being flushed
all over the solar system.

178
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:28,687
- No one cares!
- It's a horrible idea.

179
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:31,451
It's a great idea.

180
00:26:21,316 --> 00:26:23,277
- Blue dreamers?
- Mm-hmm.

181
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:26,225
Now?

182
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:28,792
Why not?

183
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:42,322
I don't feel anything.

184
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,687
You always want
instantaneous satisfaction.

185
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:54,112
Do you miss it?
Maybe it's different now.

186
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,104
Yeah, maybe it's worse.

187
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:00,083
That pill's getting to you.

188
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:01,756
No...

189
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:11,089
I think you ought to go to Earth.

190
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,312
What?

191
00:27:15,128 --> 00:27:17,005
You said I'd hate it.

192
00:27:17,493 --> 00:27:20,450
Find out for yourself
you hate it.

193
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:21,962
I don't want to go.

194
00:27:24,048 --> 00:27:25,352
Yes, you do.

195
00:27:28,593 --> 00:27:32,552
- I just want to have been.
- So have been.

196
00:27:32,553 --> 00:27:37,304
- And leave you?
- It'll happen sooner or later.

197
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:14,830
Quiet, please.
You're blocking him.

198
00:29:21,507 --> 00:29:23,181
I wanted you to meet Hector.

199
00:29:23,182 --> 00:29:24,451
Adam.

200
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:28,855
Give it a simple instruction.
Ask it something.

201
00:29:31,032 --> 00:29:33,239
- Hector?
- Yes.

202
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:38,635
Hector, hand the flask
to the Major.

203
00:29:43,474 --> 00:29:44,937
Abort!

204
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:51,038
Glad you didn't ask him
to shake hands.

205
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,628
Wheel and peditate.

206
00:29:58,278 --> 00:30:01,461
Obviously,
there's some fine tuning to do.

207
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:28,470
Begin.

208
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:23,665
- I thought you had me.
- You have me.

209
00:31:24,585 --> 00:31:27,453
- Good evening, Captain.
- Good evening.

210
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,592
Can he play?

211
00:31:29,593 --> 00:31:32,667
Yes. I play. He plays.

212
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:35,744
I'd like to see that.

213
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:41,797
Hector. All right.

214
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:48,364
How would you like
to make a small wager, Hector?

215
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,827
He doesn't like to be laughed at.

216
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:53,656
Can't you program him
to have a sense of humour?

217
00:31:53,657 --> 00:31:55,384
That's not a early priority.

218
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:58,506
Oh come'on, you can't program
a sense of humour.

219
00:31:58,507 --> 00:32:04,048
- Anything I have sir, he can have.
- Then he definitely have a sense of humour.

220
00:32:04,392 --> 00:32:09,000
- Who's white?
- You be, Hector.

221
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,981
How does he learn?

222
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:27,617
Direct input.

223
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,626
He sits him down
in front of a blackboard.

224
00:32:30,627 --> 00:32:32,714
I said direct input.

225
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,519
How do you work that?

226
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:40,984
Brain to brain.

227
00:32:41,566 --> 00:32:43,716
A brain drain?

228
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,947
You mean he draws
from your brain?

229
00:32:47,948 --> 00:32:50,987
Yes.
When I want him to.

230
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,190
But how?

231
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:58,485
Radio contact.

232
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,026
Where do you make the connection?

233
00:33:19,508 --> 00:33:20,790
Hector.

234
00:33:57,707 --> 00:33:59,186
What were you thinking?

235
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,406
Exchange and simplify.

236
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:03,875
And you can control
whatever you think?

237
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,964
- Yes.
- I wish I could.

238
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:09,480
I teach him
as much as I choose.

239
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:12,228
You haven't taught him enough.

240
00:34:12,229 --> 00:34:16,468
Sacrifice. That's one thing you
can't teach him, Captain.

241
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,061
Sacrifice.

242
00:34:21,295 --> 00:34:22,556
Checkmate.

243
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,185
Now, whatever he thinks goes
straight into that robot.

244
00:34:40,186 --> 00:34:42,063
Doesn't that scare you?

245
00:34:42,202 --> 00:34:43,317
Not really.

246
00:34:43,427 --> 00:34:46,963
The Captain's been carefully selected.
He's trained.

247
00:34:46,964 --> 00:34:50,083
- To control his thoughts.
- Of course.

248
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,111
How do you work that?

249
00:34:54,981 --> 00:34:56,567
Is it the box?

250
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:03,015
You can hear me, right?

251
00:35:04,984 --> 00:35:06,386
But you can't talk.

252
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:02,460
Who knows what's in
the Captain's brain?

253
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:05,609
Who knows what goes on
in anybody's head?

254
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:13,381
Alex, would you say I was a man
who could control his thoughts?

255
00:36:13,913 --> 00:36:15,585
I think so.

256
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:19,093
Stand up... please.

257
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:25,281
Now take that off very slow...
No, go on.

258
00:36:25,282 --> 00:36:29,263
Now I'm gonna think about nothing...
but hydroponics.

259
00:36:31,686 --> 00:36:33,278
Hydroponics...

260
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,545
Hydroponics...

261
00:36:37,063 --> 00:36:40,260
Hydroponics... hydroponics...

262
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,440
Hydroponics!

263
00:37:26,066 --> 00:37:29,937
Who devised this system?
There are sources for food present.

264
00:37:29,938 --> 00:37:31,928
And cities are starve...

265
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:35,123
- What happened?
- My eye. Something's in my eye.

266
00:37:35,472 --> 00:37:37,752
- Get Adam.
- Let me look.

267
00:37:39,713 --> 00:37:42,746
It's a live chip. Sit down.

268
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:48,881
- Get Adam.
- Please, Adam can't help. Hector.

269
00:37:48,882 --> 00:37:50,627
- No!
- Relax.

270
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:54,287
- Trust him, Alex.
- No! Don't. Please don't.

271
00:37:54,288 --> 00:37:59,253
- Be Still. - Don't let him touch me.
- Do as you're told, be still! It could spread.

272
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,553
Steady.

273
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:09,616
- No!
- Steady.

274
00:38:10,184 --> 00:38:11,378
No!

275
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,631
Please don't...

276
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:26,751
Ready, Hector?
Keep the eye still!

277
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:32,812
All right, Hector.
She's ready... now.

278
00:38:33,387 --> 00:38:36,728
- Hold your head still.
- No...

279
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,963
Oh... That's better.

280
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:52,617
That's much better. Thank you.

281
00:38:52,812 --> 00:38:55,798
I have something for you.
Earth dreams.

282
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:56,868
No.

283
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:03,999
You'll feel like you're there.
A 3-D inner experience.

284
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,609
No, thank you.

285
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:11,826
You're worried you'll like it, aren't you?
You'll never know how good it is until you try.

286
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:14,267
I'm today. He's yesterday.

287
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,321
Don't you like me?
Don't you?

288
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:30,650
Turn off the video scans.

289
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:37,498
There.
What's wrong with you today?

290
00:39:38,286 --> 00:39:43,296
Today? I'm not today.
I'm yesterday.

291
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,621
You've been listening to our cuckoo.

292
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:53,472
- He's not so cuckoo.
- You can tell the time by him.

293
00:40:09,813 --> 00:40:12,566
What is it?
Nearly out of charge?

294
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:35,062
I wish you would talk.
You know you can.

295
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,178
Why won't you talk?

296
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:41,086
Why not?
What have I done wrong?

297
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:45,307
That blank there.
That's not what I meant.

298
00:40:46,685 --> 00:40:49,072
That was an improper thought leakage.

299
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:53,092
What have I done wrong?

300
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,627
Don't get smart.

301
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:09,481
Are you aware of Alex?

302
00:41:12,205 --> 00:41:13,877
What do you think?

303
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:16,371
What do you know about it?

304
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:19,896
Don't get ideas above
your station, Hector.

305
00:41:22,384 --> 00:41:24,693
I said to blank that.
Now blank it.

306
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,705
Now reply as ordered.
Am I a killer?

307
00:41:31,518 --> 00:41:33,110
Is that the truth?

308
00:41:34,306 --> 00:41:35,739
Is that the truth?

309
00:41:36,676 --> 00:41:38,671
You're malfunctioning.
Answer.

310
00:41:42,994 --> 00:41:48,306
Now, tell me. Absolutely can you talk?
Or are you malfunctioning?

311
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:41,354
Sally!

312
00:42:43,905 --> 00:42:46,862
Sally! Sally!

313
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,704
Sally!

314
00:42:57,029 --> 00:42:58,382
Sally?

315
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:03,331
Sally?

316
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,493
Sally?

317
00:43:11,294 --> 00:43:12,852
Sally, come on.

318
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:15,876
Come on, Sally. Sally?

319
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:17,907
Sally?

320
00:44:12,727 --> 00:44:14,478
No!

321
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,988
No!

322
00:44:23,212 --> 00:44:26,010
No! Adam!

323
00:44:29,624 --> 00:44:31,615
No!

324
00:44:38,673 --> 00:44:41,202
Hector, put her down.

325
00:44:43,129 --> 00:44:44,881
Let her go.

326
00:44:45,865 --> 00:44:47,617
Conform!

327
00:44:49,113 --> 00:44:50,341
Hector.

328
00:44:52,145 --> 00:44:55,710
He'll do what you say.
Alex, you ask him.

329
00:44:55,981 --> 00:44:58,800
Hector, please put me down.

330
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:12,169
W-w-why did you bring him here.

331
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:31,299
Did you teach him to kill?

332
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,833
No. It's you.

333
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:38,134
He wants you. We both do.
He's learned too much from me.

334
00:45:48,732 --> 00:45:51,722
- Alex!
- Adam!

335
00:45:51,723 --> 00:45:53,156
Major!

336
00:45:57,552 --> 00:45:59,039
What happened?

337
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,240
Major! Help me! Major!

338
00:46:03,241 --> 00:46:05,409
Let the robot have him.

339
00:46:05,407 --> 00:46:06,362
Help!

340
00:46:08,021 --> 00:46:11,272
Help me, please, Major!
Don't leave me!

341
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:16,900
- Major! Please! Help me!
Don't leave me! - I can't do it.

342
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:14,902
How long will the doors hold?

343
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,661
How strong is Hector?

344
00:47:18,258 --> 00:47:19,733
Come on.

345
00:47:41,527 --> 00:47:43,177
Go through your drills, Captain.

346
00:47:43,178 --> 00:47:45,179
What's emergency procedure?

347
00:47:45,793 --> 00:47:47,635
I don't know.

348
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:49,681
You don't know?!

349
00:47:51,265 --> 00:47:54,541
If we weren't in eclipse,
we could call Central.

350
00:47:54,713 --> 00:47:57,976
And if we were chickens,
we could lay eggs.

351
00:47:57,977 --> 00:48:01,676
We're shadow-locked.
What do we do?

352
00:48:01,677 --> 00:48:04,437
We sit and watch him for three days?

353
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:23,443
He's getting low on charge.

354
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:32,015
He's about to recharge.

355
00:48:32,706 --> 00:48:34,203
Let him.

356
00:48:34,532 --> 00:48:37,971
- You can't let him...
- Oh, yes, we can. Alex?

357
00:48:40,252 --> 00:48:45,700
We'll overload him. I'll give him
a headache he won't forget.

358
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,780
Track it.

359
00:48:55,521 --> 00:48:57,243
Track it.

360
00:49:19,066 --> 00:49:21,944
Can't see... I can't see it.

361
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:29,739
Now.

362
00:50:00,986 --> 00:50:04,127
He's out.
You'll have no more trouble from him.

363
00:50:04,128 --> 00:50:07,041
Or from you.
As soon as we declipse,

364
00:50:07,042 --> 00:50:10,374
I'm reporting your incompetent
handling of this whole experiment.

365
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,412
Where have you the right
to call me incompetent?

366
00:50:12,413 --> 00:50:14,643
You told me he can perform
those functions.

367
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:16,874
- You told me you can handle...
- I did it on your say so.

368
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:19,361
- You told me you could handle him!
- You're the one who put him together!

369
00:50:19,362 --> 00:50:21,556
- Is this the way you handle him?
- It's moving!

370
00:50:23,569 --> 00:50:26,732
Hold him down.
Sit, get his brain out!

371
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,805
Hold onto his arm!

372
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:02,637
Dismantle it.
Piece by piece.

373
00:51:02,638 --> 00:51:07,089
Then crate it, and take him
and your ideas back with you.

374
00:51:07,621 --> 00:51:12,902
What you can't stand, you run from.
Like you ran from Earth.

375
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:17,158
That's right.
To get away from people like you.

376
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:19,487
To set up your own little universe?

377
00:51:20,632 --> 00:51:22,382
To help feed yours.

378
00:51:22,698 --> 00:51:25,517
When you bought Alex here,
were you thinking just of her?

379
00:51:28,014 --> 00:51:30,718
Captain, you flunked.

380
00:51:36,617 --> 00:51:39,733
You want to kill me?
You want to kill me?

381
00:51:39,734 --> 00:51:41,904
Go ahead...

382
00:51:41,905 --> 00:51:44,114
Go ahead. Kill me.

383
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:47,642
Kill me!
If you think you can.

384
00:51:49,582 --> 00:51:54,635
Did you know the original Hector
came to a tragic end?

385
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:59,000
He was slain by Achilles,

386
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:02,743
his body dragged
around the walls of Troy.

387
00:52:07,346 --> 00:52:08,995
You want the girl?

388
00:52:09,556 --> 00:52:13,549
Sure, sure. You want the girl.

389
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,645
You think she's beautiful, too,
don't you?

390
00:52:17,675 --> 00:52:20,552
You know the Captain's crazy?

391
00:52:20,553 --> 00:52:22,448
He really is crazy.

392
00:52:22,449 --> 00:52:25,042
The robot scared me more.

393
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:29,406
If the robot can kill,
the Captain can kill.

394
00:52:32,145 --> 00:52:33,554
I thought I could kill.

395
00:52:35,681 --> 00:52:38,831
I'm just not update enough for murder.

396
00:52:41,852 --> 00:52:43,345
I wish I was.

397
00:52:43,346 --> 00:52:46,298
Are you sure
he's taking it apart?

398
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:50,849
Either he takes it apart
or it takes him apart.

399
00:52:57,334 --> 00:52:59,342
Captain, how are things progressing?

400
00:53:01,321 --> 00:53:03,229
I have completed the dismantling.

401
00:53:04,956 --> 00:53:06,581
I'm glad that's over.

402
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:43,893
It's my fault.
I should never have let him stay.

403
00:56:43,894 --> 00:56:47,621
In a week or two, we'll have
forgotten it ever happened.

404
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:50,652
- Will we?
- Of course we will.

405
00:57:13,634 --> 00:57:14,544
I'm leaving.

406
00:57:15,173 --> 00:57:17,981
I told you never to barge in here.

407
00:57:17,982 --> 00:57:21,736
- I'm taking your partner with me.
- What?

408
00:57:21,737 --> 00:57:23,666
You are crazy.

409
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:25,419
Come along, Alex.

410
00:57:26,034 --> 00:57:30,988
I'm taking command.
You're inadequate Major... in every area.

411
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,827
Captain, for the last time...

412
00:57:32,828 --> 00:57:36,090
Doesn't it disgust you to be used by him,
to be touch by an old man?

413
00:57:36,091 --> 00:57:38,768
Can't you feel the decay?

414
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,288
Stop it! Stop it!

415
00:57:54,935 --> 00:57:56,258
Stop it!

416
00:58:01,341 --> 00:58:02,535
It's me.

417
00:58:23,486 --> 00:58:25,078
Why did you stop me?

418
00:58:30,872 --> 00:58:32,990
- You're coming with me.
- Let me go!

419
00:58:32,991 --> 00:58:34,867
First thing we do is go see Earth.

420
00:59:08,476 --> 00:59:12,231
Adam, how can we get
to the Captain's ship?

421
00:59:12,232 --> 00:59:15,379
We gotta be quick. Let's try.

422
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,575
- Now?
- Come on.

423
01:01:54,564 --> 01:01:57,899
It's no use. We can't lose him.

424
01:02:57,519 --> 01:02:58,872
Alex?

425
01:03:16,364 --> 01:03:18,240
Alex?

426
01:03:51,337 --> 01:03:52,971
Adam!

427
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:54,743
Shh!

428
01:04:03,623 --> 01:04:05,399
Get back!

429
01:04:20,251 --> 01:04:22,959
Run for it!

430
01:05:07,097 --> 01:05:08,878
Where is he?

431
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:12,408
I don't know.
He just vanished.

432
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,477
He's in the communications room.

433
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:30,064
He's tracking us.

434
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:14,074
Come in, Hector.

435
01:07:16,313 --> 01:07:19,731
Come on.
Come on in.

436
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,975
- Are you sure you can fly it?
- No trouble.

437
01:09:04,976 --> 01:09:07,440
It'll be locked
into automatic return.

438
01:09:07,441 --> 01:09:10,033
All we have to do is
light up and sit back.

439
01:09:42,926 --> 01:09:46,994
Now we know something.
He doesn't want to kill us.

440
01:09:50,001 --> 01:09:54,160
Whatever he wants us for,
it's not for that.

441
01:10:26,993 --> 01:10:28,737
It's hopeless.

442
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:41,421
You'll get your trip to Earth.
I promise.

443
01:10:51,134 --> 01:10:52,772
The Captain!

444
01:11:01,387 --> 01:11:03,025
He's alive?

445
01:11:03,438 --> 01:11:05,235
Yes, I'm alive.

446
01:11:07,546 --> 01:11:11,048
Captain, what happened?

447
01:11:11,049 --> 01:11:13,562
Hector and I have come
to an arrangement.

448
01:11:13,563 --> 01:11:15,120
Where is the robot?

449
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:16,863
Hector is with me.

450
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:22,091
Come this way, please.

451
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:40,715
How strange that it ends like this.

452
01:11:41,522 --> 01:11:43,752
How will it end, Captain?

453
01:11:45,531 --> 01:11:48,963
You and I will come
to an arrangement.

454
01:11:48,964 --> 01:11:52,434
This way, please. This way.

455
01:12:06,515 --> 01:12:08,664
Hurry along, please.

456
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,240
Hurry along, please.

457
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:41,164
I'm here.

458
01:12:43,266 --> 01:12:46,815
I'm alive.
I haven't died.

459
01:12:47,169 --> 01:12:49,000
I'm taking over.

460
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:28,177
Good morning, Adam.
I trust you slept well?

461
01:14:31,562 --> 01:14:33,273
What are you doing to me?

462
01:14:33,274 --> 01:14:36,707
Your programme for the day
is very simple.

463
01:14:38,514 --> 01:14:40,311
Where's Alex?

464
01:14:40,312 --> 01:14:44,272
First, you will restore the
damage to the laboratory.

465
01:14:44,273 --> 01:14:47,030
What are you trying to put
in my head?

466
01:14:47,031 --> 01:14:49,881
Put in?
Put in?

467
01:14:49,882 --> 01:14:52,760
I'm not putting anything in.
That comes later.

468
01:14:52,915 --> 01:14:54,903
I'm taking it out.

469
01:15:04,019 --> 01:15:05,686
Where's Alex?

470
01:15:06,603 --> 01:15:08,757
What have you done to her?

471
01:15:10,268 --> 01:15:12,375
Have you done
the same thing to her?

472
01:15:13,385 --> 01:15:16,402
Good morning, Alex.
I hope you slept well.

473
01:15:16,403 --> 01:15:18,993
Your programme
for the day is simple.

474
01:15:18,994 --> 01:15:22,623
-After repairing the damage to the lab...
- Where's Adam?

475
01:15:22,624 --> 01:15:25,713
I'm happy to report
he's cooperating fully.

476
01:15:26,116 --> 01:15:28,475
Where is he?
What's going on?

477
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:32,509
We're coming out of eclipse.
If you'll excuse me for one moment.

478
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:34,102
Wait!

479
01:15:35,917 --> 01:15:39,051
This is Survey 19. Survey 19.
Come in, Saturn 3.

480
01:15:39,366 --> 01:15:42,430
Hello, this is 19, 19.
Come in, Major.

481
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:45,886
Survey 19, this is the Major.

482
01:15:45,887 --> 01:15:49,567
Saturn 3 here. Saturn 3.
This is the Major.

483
01:15:49,568 --> 01:15:51,344
Receiving you, Survey.

484
01:15:53,446 --> 01:15:57,951
We have audio reception, Major,
but no picture. Are you in difficulty?

485
01:15:57,952 --> 01:16:00,407
Just a temporary video inconvenience.

486
01:16:00,408 --> 01:16:02,126
Everything's A-OK.

487
01:16:02,127 --> 01:16:06,079
We just come out of shadow and
 we wanted to make our routine contact.

488
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,675
Everything's normal here.

489
01:16:07,676 --> 01:16:12,239
You can expect increased output
on our hydroponics shortly.

490
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,339
How's our favorite space girl?

491
01:16:14,634 --> 01:16:17,633
She's wonderful.
In fact, she's perfect.

492
01:16:17,634 --> 01:16:20,353
Is she nearby?
Put her on.

493
01:16:21,188 --> 01:16:24,290
Hello? Survey 19!
Hello, can you hear me?

494
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:25,816
Hello, survey 19.

495
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:28,875
No! No! It's not me!

496
01:16:29,212 --> 01:16:31,662
That Hector unit,
is it working out?

497
01:16:31,663 --> 01:16:34,663
Hector is responding very well
to his challenge.

498
01:16:35,025 --> 01:16:36,939
Would you like a word
with the Captain?

499
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:40,136
That won't be necessary.
That's all, then.

500
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:43,492
Talk to you in six months.
Bye, now.

501
01:16:49,754 --> 01:16:51,109
Now we can proceed.

502
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:55,740
First, make your way to the laboratory
so we can continue with our work.

503
01:16:56,933 --> 01:17:02,057
After repairing all the damage, we shall continue
with our search and analysis procedures.

504
01:17:02,058 --> 01:17:04,481
I'm sure you will find them profitable

505
01:17:04,482 --> 01:17:07,782
and, for the most part, painless.

506
01:17:08,653 --> 01:17:13,284
This way, please. Come along.
I don't want to force you.

507
01:17:13,285 --> 01:17:15,625
You could very quickly
become hungry...

508
01:17:15,626 --> 01:17:18,884
hot, cold or even breathless.

509
01:17:28,846 --> 01:17:31,280
Now, this way, please.

510
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:39,627
Adam!

511
01:17:48,228 --> 01:17:52,256
When I heard your voice,
I thought I was going mad.

512
01:17:54,207 --> 01:17:56,268
Oh, Alex.

513
01:17:57,847 --> 01:18:00,313
Hurry along, please.

514
01:18:03,667 --> 01:18:06,448
- Go on in there.
- Without you?

515
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,838
- I need a minute.
- What's gonna happen to us?

516
01:18:12,314 --> 01:18:13,633
Don't worry.

517
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:17,347
Hurry along!

518
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:32,742
Go on.

519
01:19:20,799 --> 01:19:23,108
Ah, there you are.

520
01:19:23,337 --> 01:19:27,786
And how beautiful.
Come in, Alex. Come in.

521
01:19:27,787 --> 01:19:29,738
Stop it, Hector.

522
01:19:30,277 --> 01:19:32,678
Hector. I never liked that name.

523
01:19:32,679 --> 01:19:35,792
Did you know Hector
was slain by Achilles,

524
01:19:35,793 --> 01:19:38,676
his body dragged
around the walls of Troy?

525
01:19:38,677 --> 01:19:40,510
No, I never liked Hector.

526
01:19:41,493 --> 01:19:45,405
We can do better.
How about Adam?

527
01:19:46,628 --> 01:19:49,142
Stop using his voice.

528
01:19:49,143 --> 01:19:52,075
Forgive me.
Is this more to your liking?

529
01:19:52,449 --> 01:19:54,458
Or this, perhaps?

530
01:19:54,459 --> 01:19:57,259
Stop it!
Stop using us.

531
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:59,532
Well, you see my difficulty.

532
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:01,102
I'm you.

533
01:20:01,191 --> 01:20:02,251
I'm Adam

534
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:04,784
and the other one.
I'm everyone.

535
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:08,499
Conversation is an art.
I do it to perfection.

536
01:20:10,582 --> 01:20:12,095
There you are.

537
01:20:12,527 --> 01:20:14,906
Don't be late again, Adam.

538
01:20:15,545 --> 01:20:19,073
Major.
You will call me Major.

539
01:20:21,668 --> 01:20:26,244
I am in command here.
You will do as I say.

540
01:20:27,276 --> 01:20:28,481
Both of you.

541
01:20:28,482 --> 01:20:30,199
Stay where you are!

542
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:38,394
It's time we
programmed your brain

543
01:20:38,395 --> 01:20:40,583
to be a bit more productive.

544
01:20:42,955 --> 01:20:47,125
Captain...?
Yes, that's who you really are.

545
01:20:47,126 --> 01:20:50,198
I'm not the Captain,
I'm your superior.

546
01:20:51,967 --> 01:20:55,817
- Adam, please...
- I told you to keep away!

547
01:20:57,106 --> 01:20:58,643
Don't do that!

548
01:21:00,797 --> 01:21:02,947
You must learn to obey.

549
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:08,221
- It's not your fault, Hector.
- Turn around.

550
01:21:14,301 --> 01:21:17,909
- It's not James' fault.
- Turn around!

551
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:25,296
It's everybody's fault.

552
01:21:28,519 --> 01:21:32,989
No, No!
This is...

553
01:23:06,494 --> 01:23:09,611
Hello, there.
This is your Captain speaking.

554
01:23:09,612 --> 01:23:13,051
I trust you're enjoying
the ongoing flight situation.

555
01:23:13,052 --> 01:23:17,853
And we hope you're going to fly
World Spaceways again, again and again.

556
01:23:17,854 --> 01:23:21,405
Duty-free goods service
will be closing shortly.

557
01:23:21,406 --> 01:23:24,637
Right now though, I suggest
you walk to the ports

558
01:23:24,638 --> 01:23:30,508
to get position for a swell view
of Mother Earth coming up.
