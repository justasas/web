00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:18,532
JOURNEY TO SATURN

2
00:01:39,376 --> 00:01:43,419
No! My beer!
What the hell...

3
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:02,272
Dear Denmark. Dear Danes.

4
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:08,161
In less than 24 hours, the greatest
event in our history will take place:

5
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:11,359
Kurt Maj's Satum Expedition!

6
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:15,610
The purpose is to find
eco-friendly energy resources -

7
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:20,446
- that will benefit people on Earth
and the Danish welfare state.

8
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:24,015
We transmit live from Cape Kurt.

9
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:29,982
But let's have a closer Icok
at the project's creator: Kurt Maj!

10
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:35,628
Kurt Maj, tyccon and media kingpin,
is a man of many talents.

11
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:39,383
Deeply affected by the rapidly
escalating global warming, -

12
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:44,514
- Kurt Maj has made it his personal
cause to fight for the environment.

13
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,878
And now he is on his way
to the stars - always the pioneer!

14
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,322
You're on in ten minutes, Per.
How's the suit?

15
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:04,328
Well, it's not as cool as the one
I wore for NASA's Mars Mission.

16
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:08,501
But then again, I'm not exactly
going on a 48 hour space walk, am I?

17
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:12,745
You're so cool, Per.

18
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,101
You and me, Per. Forever!

19
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:28,720
DANISH UFO ASSOCIATION
ANNUAL CONVENTION

20
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:38,841
Per! Per! Per! Per!

21
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:47,330
And now,
the man we've all been waiting for:

22
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,379
Lecturer and real-life astronaut:
Per Jensen!

23
00:04:11,923 --> 00:04:16,079
- When the stars beckon...
- Here we come!

24
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:21,572
Per! Per! Per! Per!

25
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,819
...that you cannot refuse.

26
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:37,056
Drop by Earth and let's chat.
I look forward to meeting you.

27
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:39,738
NAME FILE:

28
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:55,041
- Mr. Maj! Over here?
- Showtime!

29
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:04,253
Dear Denmark. Dear Danes.

30
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:09,294
In just a few hours, Kurt Maj's
Saturn Expedition will be a reality.

31
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:14,341
What has inspired this heroic deed?

32
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:18,985
Ever since Cape Kurt discovered
limitless resources on Saturn, -

33
00:05:19,188 --> 00:05:25,828
- I knew that Denmark would have
to claim exclusive rights to these.

34
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:32,514
It is therefore of vital importance
to claim that planet for Denmark!

35
00:05:32,721 --> 00:05:36,764
Isn't this project of greater benefit
to you than Denmark as such?

36
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:40,362
Rubbish!

37
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:46,332
Kurt Maj Enterprises has financed
the project as a national gift.

38
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:51,090
- But...
- Imagine all those riches!

39
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:57,335
It will be the end of taxes,
and the beginning of greater welfare.

40
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,744
Mr. Maj, we have a problem.
Our navigator has fallen ill.

41
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:08,868
It seems to be food poisoning.

42
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:12,755
Caused by this
Kurt Maj TV Dinner.

43
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,520
But he's being treated by the Danish
Medical Services, so all is well.

44
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:32,772
- How will we find a new navigator?
- Go over the list once more.

45
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:43,059
Try to squeeze its tummy.
How many do you want?

46
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,225
The crew could have perished
from lack of oxygen or small pox.

47
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:51,713
Voila! There you go.

48
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,316
- I'll never bathe again.
- No, why start now?

49
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,560
CONTRACT

50
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,371
- What the hell is this?
- Kurt Maj and Denmark need you!

51
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:13,093
- Say what?
- We need a new navigator.

52
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:17,581
- And you're the man for the job.
- Do you want me to go to Saturn?

53
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:21,062
- Please follow us.
- It's urgent.

54
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:25,742
Yes, but... I haven't got the time
just here and now.

55
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,392
I have lots of plans.
Laundry and TV... Time is running.

56
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:33,237
I'll have to leave. Goodbye.

57
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,283
What's your problem, Jensen?
You are a trained astronaut, right?

58
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,398
When the stars beckon,
I will be there!

59
00:07:46,571 --> 00:07:51,650
- I guess I could serve my country.
- Perfect!

60
00:07:51,856 --> 00:07:57,652
- We knew we could count on you.
- No problem. I'll just call a cab.

61
00:07:57,862 --> 00:08:01,016
I'll meet you out front in ten...

62
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:05,984
- We have some transportation.
- But I need to go home first.

63
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:12,145
- Go forit, Per!
- I need to cut my toe nails.

64
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:19,075
I need to have that board sanded
before I leave, or...

65
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,008
- Wait...
- Bye, bye.

66
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,261
Welcome aboard, Per.
Let's have a nice chat now.

67
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:54,350
This is our command center.

68
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:58,792
The best brains in the nation
are gathered here.

69
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:07,878
That computer has been programmed
to bring you all the way to Saturn.

70
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,004
So you are just a safety measure.

71
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:19,376
- What are the chances of a mishap?
- Zero percent!

72
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:25,183
Besides, your commander, Skrydsbøl,
is a distinguished soldier.

73
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:29,099
You will not find a more steady man.

74
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:34,389
- You've disgraced the Army.
- You've failed us.

75
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:37,874
You are a failure, Skrydsbøl.

76
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,311
Basra!

77
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:50,209
THE MISSION COMES FIRST

78
00:09:57,057 --> 00:10:00,132
Arne? Where are you?

79
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:06,220
- Help me, Ame... Arne...
- Gerd! Gerd!

80
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:12,985
Get away from him, you bastards!
I'm coming, Gerd!

81
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:22,630
- The reading materials you asked for.
- Die, you filthy Al Qaeda combatant!

82
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:27,799
Skrydsbøl is known to run
a tight ship on all of his missions.

83
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:31,844
Arne Skrydsbøl at your service.
If I may be so bold as to say...

84
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:36,810
- You'll make a great team.
- I promise you, I will not fail...

85
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:40,409
It'll just need to be cleared.
Hold on.

86
00:10:40,619 --> 00:10:45,014
Hello? They're in the third matrix
of the launch coordinates.

87
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:50,861
No, in the third...
Well, then look at the binary code!

88
00:10:55,753 --> 00:11:00,354
Susanne speaking. Right, I've heard.
They're looking for a new navigator.

89
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:04,441
You want me to...?
I'll be there right away. Yes!

90
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:11,765
Susanne, welcome aboard.
As always, a sight for sore eyes.

91
00:11:11,969 --> 00:11:15,282
I'm glad you thought of me.

92
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:21,255
I've always wanted to go
on a space mission. I'll do my best.

93
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:27,255
No! Susanne, my sweet...
You know we can't send you out there.

94
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:30,300
- Why you are...
- I'm what?

95
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:34,902
- I'm your technical director.
- No, it just won't work.

96
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,028
You brighten up the premises
down here. We've chosen this guy.

97
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:51,803
- Per?
- Susanne? We used to be lovers.

98
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:58,533
- We went to the Astronaut Academy.
- Then you're the perfect team.

99
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:05,294
Per is, to put it mildly, not suited
for an expedition of this magnitude.

100
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:12,026
Fiddlesticks.
Per is a true man of the people.

101
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:14,585
Per is a fucking fraud!

102
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,151
The closest thing he ever got to space
was when we watched Star Wars!

103
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:23,989
Why do you insist on hiring the most
incompetent idiots for the expedition?

104
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,198
I hope you know
what the flipping hell you're doing!

105
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:33,002
I guess someone
is on the rag today.

106
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:45,615
Susanne Mortensen speaking,
technical director of Project Saturn.

107
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,897
I need the exam papers from
Space Academy for a Per Jensen.

108
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:54,863
Yes, right now. Well, then you'll
just have to wake the security guard!

109
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:07,873
TIME FOR LIFT OFF!!

110
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,286
Ladies and gentlemen:

111
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:22,453
Ourbeloved Queen of Denmark...
and the Prince Consort.

112
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:27,450
Accompanied
by our dear Prime Minister.

113
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,500
Oh la la.
Exquisite taste, Monsieur.

114
00:13:34,867 --> 00:13:39,662
I'd like to stress a point here:
I demand strict discipline.

115
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:44,472
As representatives of Denmark,
we will be part of history forever.

116
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:55,766
Please welcome: Arne Skrydsbøl
and two of Denmarks's finest pilots.

117
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:59,930
And finally,
the experienced astronaut, Per Jensen.

118
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,629
Here you are, Madam.

119
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:26,028
Hello, beautiful!

120
00:14:32,603 --> 00:14:38,525
Don't just stand there dawdling, men.
All aboard now! Hup, hup, hup, hup!

121
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:46,849
Wait! Do I have time to take a crap?
Just a teeny-weeny crap?

122
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:06,906
Aproper hello to you.
I'm Jamil, your cook on this trip.

123
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:11,557
Hi, there. My name is Per
and I'm the new navigator.

124
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:17,079
- Don't worry, I'll get you to Saturn.
- Come here.

125
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:22,524
A cheese sandwich with jelly and cress
or a Company Sandwich?

126
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:26,364
Isn't that a Club Sandwich?

127
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:31,973
- Hey, it's alright.
- No, it's important that I learn.

128
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,940
I flunked the Danish Citizen Test
but if I work hard on this trip -

129
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,903
- and learn to be a real Dane,
they promised me a second chance.

130
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:45,584
Then I'll bring my family up here and
we'll open a classy restaurant. Look!

131
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:47,592
HOT DOGS

132
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:52,237
Howdy ho, space homos!

133
00:15:55,042 --> 00:16:00,121
Yo ho, you two Princesses. Now it's
hot-ass-mothafuckin' party time!

134
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:03,607
Ole is in charge of supplies.

135
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:08,252
Here's a bit of high culture
for your Danish Test, Jamil.

136
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:12,247
It's German, but we do it much
in the same way here in Denmark.

137
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:17,174
- I'm not sure my wife would approve.
- Come on, man!

138
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:21,779
Saucy young chicks!
Are those girls you've been porking?

139
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:29,112
You son of a dog! I'll butcher you
halal style and feed you to the rats!

140
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:32,994
- I just want to be your pork partner!
- These are my family photos!

141
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,271
Time out, boys.

142
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:39,718
Gorm the Old, Harald Bluetooth,
Sweyn Forkbeard, Harald II, -

143
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:44,640
- Canute the Great...
I'm sorry.

144
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:50,772
I was way too sensitive. Areal
Dane can handle insults and taunts.

145
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:55,179
You're absolutely right there,
my little monkey boy.

146
00:16:55,381 --> 00:17:00,858
- You fat... You big, fat bastard.
- Right on!

147
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:07,991
Stand by for lift off.
Man your stations.

148
00:17:08,834 --> 00:17:12,956
Sergeant Skrydsbøl.
Wait a second.

149
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:18,283
We've got T minus 4 minutes and 12
to lift off! It is a clear violation.

150
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:23,846
- You must read it before lift off.
- Is it cleared according to protocol?

151
00:17:24,048 --> 00:17:30,209
- No, but it contains...
- It can be contaminated with anthrax!

152
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:34,331
- But it's about Per. He's...
- Brief me when we're airborne.

153
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:45,948
Now, let's have a bitchin'
awesome heck of a party! Here.

154
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,702
Beer. The favourite
soft drink of the Danes.

155
00:17:49,913 --> 00:17:53,193
Beer is a pacifier, not a satisfier.

156
00:17:53,397 --> 00:17:54,592
Balthazar!

157
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,006
No, Balthazar!
Come back here!

158
00:18:11,214 --> 00:18:14,015
10, 9, 8, 7...

159
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:18,419
Main bcoster start.
4, 3, 2, 1...

160
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:21,581
Lift off!

161
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,663
Mon cherie!

162
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,124
Man, this sure is enough to make
your asshole rock and shake, ain't it?

163
00:19:01,903 --> 00:19:05,786
Mr. Maj, look overhere.

164
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:22,717
Owr, but really...

165
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:36,488
ACCESS DENIED

166
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:42,698
Kurt Maj, look over here.
Mr. Prime Minister, look at the duck.

167
00:19:42,903 --> 00:19:47,025
Mr. Maj, I seem to have a problem
with protocol 314.

168
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:51,622
It's a video, but I can't access it.
And I've never heard of it before.

169
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,792
Don't trouble your pretty head
with that technical stuff.

170
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:58,911
But I'm Technical Director, Mr. Maj.

171
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:19,051
What's the protocol on knocking
before approaching your superior?

172
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:23,858
- That... yo shod knock fisth?
- Exactly.

173
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:27,536
If this had been Kabul, your mother
would've had you back in a body bag.

174
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:33,223
Look me in the eyes.
I knew it! You've got it.

175
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:37,110
The look of death. We've
stared death straight in the eyes.

176
00:20:37,315 --> 00:20:41,790
You never forget your first time, huh?
The first kill!

177
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,282
Mine was in Beirut '82. Them were
the days. How many kills have you had?

178
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:52,599
That is... two... eh,
fifty... ninety!

179
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:58,891
It's an honour to have you aboard.
Let's have a real astronaut chat.

180
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:04,016
Yes, definitely. I just have
to check some... navigation stuff.

181
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,216
That's right, Per.
The mission comes first!

182
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:13,904
What a beautiful cow.
Please sit down.

183
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:18,589
- Bratwurst?
- So big!

184
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:27,682
I just love that movie, dude! Ole
has to watch it at least once a day.

185
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:34,004
Then little Ole will come out to play.
And for a dollar, I'll let you watch.

186
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:41,529
Aah, pussy, wonderful pussy.
Let's have some pussy...

187
00:21:41,737 --> 00:21:47,773
See what I've made, dude.
Apee bubble! Made of pee!

188
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:50,978
Yikes! Get that thing away from me.

189
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:54,660
- It's just like urine squash!
- No! My photos!

190
00:21:58,754 --> 00:22:03,913
- Ole's invented a new sport with pee!
- I'll be damned...

191
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,112
Be quiet!

192
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:11,920
Yuck, shame on you!

193
00:22:12,127 --> 00:22:16,921
That's what comes from having such
a... wog aboard this craft. Yuck!

194
00:22:17,132 --> 00:22:19,568
I expect discipline on this mission!

195
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:23,976
In the Gulf, we didn't have any
of this stinking monkey business!

196
00:22:27,261 --> 00:22:28,901
HOT DOGS

197
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:19,583
They're almost there.

198
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:28,197
All hands on deck!
ETA on Saturn in T minus 15 minutes.

199
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,207
Ready for landing?

200
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:59,263
Say, what are you doing?

201
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:06,235
I'm ready to put on my helmet in case
of... a cute decompression symptoms?

202
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:11,875
Of course! Why didn't I think of that?
Good point, Per.

203
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:41,899
Touchdown. Welcome to Saturn.

204
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:47,271
Good! Form formation
"The Capture of Saturn". All hands!

205
00:24:56,365 --> 00:25:01,046
I hereby raise this flag as a symbol
of the Danish colonization of Saturn.

206
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,329
For King, Country... No, for God,
King, and Country. Yes, I'm ready.

207
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:14,859
God save our gracious King...

208
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:17,624
No, dammit!

209
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:23,509
And here is Denmark,
and here is Denmark, olé, olé, olé.

210
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:31,996
This is a clearbreach of the chain
of command! Turn that thing off!

211
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,429
From the top!

212
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:43,568
Hey ho, here we go,
d'ya want Ole's cock, you filthy ho?

213
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:50,966
And Ole... Ole...

214
00:26:28,174 --> 00:26:33,299
Don't worry. It's under control.
Give me your wristwatches.

215
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:42,298
We, the White Gods, bring you gifts
as a token of our good intentions.

216
00:26:42,508 --> 00:26:45,947
Obey us, or we'll use our fire sticks!

217
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:49,591
They don't like you shouting at them.

218
00:26:49,795 --> 00:26:53,951
Fiddlesticks. Primitive civilizations
need to know who's in charge.

219
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,277
- Hear, hear!
- They don't seem primitive.

220
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:00,637
We come from a highly developed
country called Denmark.

221
00:27:00,846 --> 00:27:05,924
We want to use your natural resources
for our high technological machinery.

222
00:27:06,131 --> 00:27:12,006
We'll teach you about democracy and
freedom of speech. Great spin-off!

223
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:17,289
See how he turned hostile
when I talked about freedom of speech.

224
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,300
It's the way you say it.

225
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:24,184
Draw your weapons! Let's see how they
like good, old-fashioned brute force!

226
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:27,110
- Bad idea!
- Basra!

227
00:27:27,311 --> 00:27:32,515
Dang it! Ouch!
I don't believe it. My triggerfinger!

228
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:39,071
Shit!

229
00:27:59,582 --> 00:28:03,374
The closest planet we could find is in
the Solaris cloud, just 12 years...

230
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:12,024
Get to the point!
What is the size of its water supply?

231
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:15,309
- Two percent.
- Two percent?

232
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:19,640
But we have sucked all
the other planets in the galaxy dry.

233
00:28:19,842 --> 00:28:25,285
You idiot! Two percent will not even
keep the army going for a week!

234
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:16,128
Bless you...

235
00:29:27,908 --> 00:29:31,301
Beloved Dictator, we have captured
this gang of aliens.

236
00:29:31,511 --> 00:29:36,385
We demand to be treated in accordance
with the Geneva Convention...

237
00:29:39,078 --> 00:29:44,032
...our military rights.
- Insert the translators now!

238
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:48,081
Let me go, you terrorist bastard.
This is utterly...

239
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:54,127
They don't have an orifice
in their back forthe translators.

240
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:58,330
They must have an incredibly
primitive DNA structure.

241
00:29:58,537 --> 00:30:03,332
Hey, wait! There's an orifice
furtherdown. Roll in the machinery.

242
00:30:20,158 --> 00:30:23,312
Oh, yes!
A little more to the left, please.

243
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:30,763
Tell me where you come from.

244
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:34,849
Just state your name,
rank and home port.

245
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:38,446
Arne Skrydsbøl, sergeant in the Navy,
Planet Earth.

246
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:44,213
- What business have you on Saturn?
- Arne Skrydsbøl, sergeant, Earth.

247
00:30:44,422 --> 00:30:48,624
- Are the translators fitted right?
- Fuck, that hurt!

248
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:52,948
- It should work perfectly.
- Take them away.

249
00:30:56,753 --> 00:31:02,595
Bring them back when it's time
for dinner. You two, follow me.

250
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,412
Hopelessly outdated.

251
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:34,948
What's he saying?

252
00:31:36,672 --> 00:31:42,354
...I've kept an eye on you since
my first test probes reached Saturn.

253
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,951
I know that water is
of vital importance to you, -

254
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:52,767
- yet you have problems procuring it.
Allow me to present, Planet Earth.

255
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,245
Earth, known as the Blue Planet.

256
00:31:58,453 --> 00:32:04,489
78% of it is covered in water...
just waiting to be sucked up.

257
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:11,623
This is an offer you cannot refuse.
Drop by Earth, and we'll discuss this.

258
00:32:11,826 --> 00:32:14,548
I look forward to meeting you.

259
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:21,388
Strip this sorry craft of everything,
and then prepare my spaceship.

260
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:27,077
Where the hell are they?

261
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:33,479
- They went out to stretch their legs.
- They should have been back by now.

262
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:36,207
Hey! That might be them.

263
00:32:39,172 --> 00:32:41,130
What?

264
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,933
Oopsy doopsy...

265
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:48,817
There goes all of our communication!

266
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:52,905
I won't stand for that tone of voice.
Accidents may happen, you know.

267
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:58,629
It'll take days to re-establish
connections. That was our only server.

268
00:32:58,831 --> 00:33:03,785
Annoying, isn't it?
Well, I'm sure you'll figure it out.

269
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:19,206
Come here.
We have a pretty gift for you.

270
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:22,212
Gu ga gu ga gu ga.

271
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:32,415
Well, horrible testicle torture is an
unavoidable aspect in ourbusiness.

272
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:37,498
Just see is as a work hazard.
That makes it all easier.

273
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:39,508
Cheers, Ole.

274
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:47,398
My last one! It should join the rest
of the Brewsky family in my belly.

275
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:52,040
I'm like a beautiful flower.
I need a beer or I'll wither away.

276
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:55,522
- I'm withering away!
- What are you doing?

277
00:33:55,726 --> 00:34:00,851
I think our prison cell is made
of frozen metallic gas.

278
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:06,689
It has crystallized and appears hard
but vaporizes if exposed to alcohol.

279
00:34:06,897 --> 00:34:12,101
- How did you know?
- I am a doctor of nuclear physics.

280
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:17,461
Any porch monkey can claim that.
Let's rock'n'roll, boys!

281
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:22,023
- Hold it! Prison break!
- Basra!

282
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:28,831
Great teamwork.
Let's go! Hup, hup, hup.

283
00:34:46,696 --> 00:34:50,294
- They seem to be getting ready.
- But for what?

284
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:56,216
- Look! Our spaceship.
- And there's the boss dude.

285
00:34:56,425 --> 00:35:00,103
Satum Force One, departure!

286
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:03,622
Destination: Planet Earth.

287
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,669
- Earth?
- Operation Suck Earth Dry.

288
00:35:07,876 --> 00:35:11,315
Proceed to hut 3
and await the Dictator's signal.

289
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,311
- Suck Earth Dry?
- Sounds kinky!

290
00:35:15,523 --> 00:35:19,806
Aha! The Dictatoris on his way
to Earth to launch an invasion.

291
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:24,290
- I knew it was a rogue state!
- Look at that giant vacuum cleaner.

292
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:28,250
If he reaches Earth and transmits
the signal, it would mean...

293
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:33,854
- The End of the World!
- We'll put an end to that.

294
00:35:43,871 --> 00:35:47,549
Move over, boys!
Time for some boobs and beer.

295
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:10,647
I found this in the Earthlings' craft.

296
00:36:10,857 --> 00:36:15,332
Some outmoded audio-visual media
based on electromagnetic currents.

297
00:36:22,228 --> 00:36:27,466
This seems to be a manual
in the customs of the Earthlings.

298
00:36:28,594 --> 00:36:31,030
Interesting.

299
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:46,079
Ouch, that fucking shit!

300
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:52,128
And then there's a slight ascend,
which you stick to for ten minutes...

301
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:56,493
Saturn mission to Cape Kurt, come in.

302
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:59,741
Per, let's get this baby in the air
so we can eliminate that UFO.

303
00:36:59,944 --> 00:37:04,704
I haven't had much practice with this
model... I'm used to the Apollo type.

304
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:09,111
You and I have the look of death.
Rememberthat.

305
00:37:19,843 --> 00:37:23,078
It's always nice
to have a clearview, right?

306
00:37:29,293 --> 00:37:32,207
Per, hurry up!

307
00:37:33,657 --> 00:37:34,807
HANDBRAKE

308
00:37:41,544 --> 00:37:43,856
Tilt, Per! Tilt!

309
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,991
What's the matter with you, kid?
Don't worry. I'll take it from here.

310
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:58,797
I flew the Hercules planes
when we carpet-bombed Beograd.

311
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:02,998
Post-traumatic stress disorder after
dangerous missions is quite common.

312
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:09,330
Ouch, that old fucking piece of shit!

313
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:15,890
Yes! Come on. Expedition,
Cape Kurt calling. Can you hear me?

314
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:19,093
- Hello.
- Per, is that you?

315
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:24,903
This is George from the Short Wave
Radio Club. Any kinky girls on line?

316
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,432
Hello? Hello...

317
00:38:34,956 --> 00:38:38,269
Ole has totally freaked out.

318
00:38:41,162 --> 00:38:43,632
The enemy is in sight!

319
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:50,920
The Earthlings' spacecraft!
It's gaining on us.

320
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:53,694
Let them come.

321
00:38:56,777 --> 00:39:02,015
Fire! And not just a warning shot
either. Just throw it right at them.

322
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:13,432
They're gone.

323
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:19,554
- Contact! Per, eliminate them.
- What?

324
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:32,082
- Let me have a shot at it.
- You know dog fights too, Mr. 9/11?

325
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:38,054
No, three years in the accommodation
centre. PlayStation, see?

326
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:47,937
- Way to go, Jamil. Bull's eye!
- The UFO seems to be unharmed.

327
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:54,742
They don't stand a chance
against our deflector shield.

328
00:39:54,953 --> 00:39:58,836
Give me an estimate of the steering
system of their pathetic vessel.

329
00:40:18,496 --> 00:40:24,372
- A black hole. It's sucking us in!
- Arne, turn the wheel!

330
00:40:26,664 --> 00:40:29,739
Way to go, Arne!

331
00:40:35,873 --> 00:40:40,553
- Red alert!
- Take over. I'll check the air lock.

332
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,160
Red alert! Red alert!

333
00:40:50,287 --> 00:40:52,405
CONFIDENTIAL

334
00:41:01,738 --> 00:41:04,208
Per, would you please come with me?

335
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:10,341
Just activate the jet pack, scoot over
to the UFO and attach the explosives.

336
00:41:10,546 --> 00:41:15,227
- Have you gone mad, man?
- Don't worry, Per.

337
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:19,713
This should be a piece of cake
for a seasoned astronaut like you.

338
00:41:19,915 --> 00:41:22,876
Wait!
I'm not an astronaut.

339
00:41:23,078 --> 00:41:27,314
I've never been to space before.
I don't know how to ride a jet pack!

340
00:41:27,523 --> 00:41:31,805
I've known that
from the moment I saw you.

341
00:41:32,007 --> 00:41:37,644
Arne Skrydsbøl has a keen eye.
You smell like a con man.

342
00:41:37,853 --> 00:41:41,132
- Arne, I can explain it all...
- No, you cannot!

343
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:46,170
- Know... who sailed Olfert Fischer?
- An ole fart?

344
00:41:46,381 --> 00:41:51,255
- Hello?
- Shot them... call it friendly fire.

345
00:41:51,466 --> 00:41:52,900
Can you hear me?

346
00:41:53,107 --> 00:41:58,140
- Arne, this is dangerous!
- You've endangered the mission.

347
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:01,871
What with your lies
and fake exam papers.

348
00:42:02,076 --> 00:42:06,596
- Wait! I lied for a reason.
- It had better be a good reason.

349
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:13,155
- I lied because I was in love.
- I see. That's the worst excuse ever!

350
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:19,164
- Have you never been in love, Arne?
- I was close to my pup, Dick Cheney.

351
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:24,372
- But I shot it when it ate my medals!
- I'm talking about real love, Arne.

352
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:28,495
Have you never been so madly in love
that it hurts just to see her?

353
00:42:28,702 --> 00:42:34,304
That's how I felt about Susanne. She'd
just been accepted into the Academy.

354
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:39,063
I thought, "I'm will be an astronaut,
too." Just to be close to her.

355
00:42:39,272 --> 00:42:42,233
But I flunked all the tests.

356
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:46,432
Get to the point, or I shoot you
in the head like little Dick Cheney.

357
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:51,718
So I started cheating to impress her.
Yes, I tampered with my exam papers.

358
00:42:51,924 --> 00:42:56,639
No Dane with any kind of space slash
military training is fooled by a con.

359
00:42:56,849 --> 00:43:01,689
Yes. She was mad about me,
and everything was just great.

360
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:05,333
Then she found out I had cheated
and went totally ballistic.

361
00:43:05,537 --> 00:43:10,491
She said I was a disgrace to the space
program. She never understood.

362
00:43:11,143 --> 00:43:16,905
I didn't give a fuck about the space
program. I just wanted to be with her.

363
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:22,222
You activate the bomb
on the red button.

364
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:26,073
No!

365
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,713
Oh, no!

366
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:33,723
- Where's Per?
- There.

367
00:43:35,686 --> 00:43:38,966
It's always nice to have a clear view,
right, Per?

368
00:43:41,012 --> 00:43:44,291
Activate the jet pack, you idiot!

369
00:43:48,499 --> 00:43:50,651
Hell bloody!

370
00:43:58,108 --> 00:44:01,821
- Oh, no.
- No more games.

371
00:44:08,158 --> 00:44:10,994
What kind of abomination is this?

372
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:16,803
Some sort of advanced remote control.
They've taken over our control system.

373
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:34,499
What the fuck are you up to?

374
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,388
Goodbye.

375
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,393
Get us away from here!

376
00:44:58,246 --> 00:44:59,647
Typical!

377
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,005
Per!

378
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:16,853
- You are a trained astronaut, right?
- We'll be a part of history forever.

379
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:23,060
- You're so cool, Per!
- You smell like a con man.

380
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:28,508
- Per is a genuine man of the people.
- Per is a fucking fraud!

381
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,790
Susanne!

382
00:45:36,003 --> 00:45:40,876
Susanne... no!

383
00:45:44,811 --> 00:45:48,728
Per! Oh, no, it's all my fault.

384
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:58,857
Bloody hell! The autopilot is down
with a fatal error.

385
00:45:59,065 --> 00:46:03,347
This is a crisis situation.
We'll never make it back to Earth.

386
00:46:03,549 --> 00:46:07,432
- What happened to Per?
- He was sucked into the black hole.

387
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:11,425
- We have to go in after him.
- A suicide mission? You'd like that!

388
00:46:11,637 --> 00:46:17,400
- We have to try.
- Arne, where are you?

389
00:46:17,603 --> 00:46:21,121
Ame, for fuck's sake!

390
00:46:21,326 --> 00:46:26,964
The mission always comes first!
Per failed us. I can do nothing!

391
00:46:31,496 --> 00:46:36,940
- What the hell is wrong now?
- We've run out of gas.

392
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:45,625
Well, you'll have it your way then.

393
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,323
Beloved Mr. Dictator,
we're entering the Earth's atmosphere.

394
00:47:00,524 --> 00:47:04,521
He was right. They've got enough water
to keep the fleet running in 20 years.

395
00:47:04,728 --> 00:47:07,723
Send the co-ordinates
to the invasion force.

396
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:21,334
I don't know what so say, but I think
something has gone terribly wrong.

397
00:47:23,186 --> 00:47:28,060
- What's going on?
- Someone is entering the atmosphere.

398
00:47:28,271 --> 00:47:30,070
Oh, no!

399
00:47:31,554 --> 00:47:36,587
Six. One, two, three, four... Oh, no.

400
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:40,716
Oops, Mr. Prime Minister,
this is going to be expensive.

401
00:47:40,923 --> 00:47:44,840
We'll just cut back on the care of
our senior citizens again this year.

402
00:47:45,047 --> 00:47:49,921
- Mr. Maj.
- Susanne. What an entrance.

403
00:47:50,132 --> 00:47:54,095
Our space ship is lost, and an
unidentified vessel is approaching.

404
00:47:54,296 --> 00:47:58,452
- I think it's hostile.
- The Danish People's Party protest.

405
00:47:59,701 --> 00:48:04,940
There comes a time when you as
a citizen of this peaceful nation -

406
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:09,064
- will be forced to perform
the noble defence mechanism, -

407
00:48:09,271 --> 00:48:13,062
- which we through proud generations
have resorted to again and again -

408
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:17,477
- and proven that we master
to perfection.

409
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,277
- Total subjection.
- What?

410
00:48:21,483 --> 00:48:23,760
We're talking about cool cash here.

411
00:48:23,965 --> 00:48:29,442
Imagine the export rights and
exchange of sustainable technology.

412
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:36,335
Your re-election is ensured since you
can lowertaxes and safeguard welfare.

413
00:48:36,537 --> 00:48:39,452
You can't just do that!

414
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:44,180
Leave this to the men now,
right, you sweet little thing?

415
00:48:53,193 --> 00:49:00,038
- I think we've passed through it.
- Never underestimate Danish design.

416
00:49:13,172 --> 00:49:19,048
- The atmosphere is compatible.
- We're really out in the sticks, huh?

417
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,533
We have to survey the area and
find fuel, if Denmark is to be saved.

418
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:29,822
Look! Alight.

419
00:49:33,192 --> 00:49:38,635
DENMARK HAS VISITORS
FROM SPACE

420
00:50:04,862 --> 00:50:07,140
Cheers!

421
00:50:47,904 --> 00:50:50,500
I'm so horny.

422
00:50:50,707 --> 00:50:57,551
We want to cum in the ass
of all your girls.

423
00:50:57,753 --> 00:51:04,552
Give me your big cock.
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

424
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:19,250
Dear Danes!
Let's welcome our new allies.

425
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:24,214
These fascinating beings have come to
negotiate the future export of goods.

426
00:51:24,419 --> 00:51:30,945
Of all nations on Earth they chose us.
Because Danish goods are the best!

427
00:51:32,387 --> 00:51:36,623
If we enter into this agreement, -

428
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:41,352
- then early retirement is guaranteed
for all further generations.

429
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:46,069
That's not true!

430
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:51,804
The aliens are hostile.
They've murdered our astronauts!

431
00:51:52,006 --> 00:51:56,242
Well, as soon as someone makes
a splendid initiative -

432
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:59,047
- that will create prosperity, -

433
00:51:59,253 --> 00:52:04,207
- the leftwinged, paranoid eco-freaks
crawl out of their filthy wood works.

434
00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:08,130
Some people will always be naysayers,
when it comes to progress, -

435
00:52:08,342 --> 00:52:14,503
- but real Danes will agree that those
who try to slow progress are traitors!

436
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:18,671
- You fucking communist!
- Filthy bitch!

437
00:52:18,872 --> 00:52:22,755
But where is
the Saturn Expedition then?

438
00:52:22,956 --> 00:52:25,631
Traitor!

439
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,758
- Welcome to Earth.
- Prepare a translator.

440
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:49,895
Attention! This looks like
a cultural leftist art installation.

441
00:52:50,102 --> 00:52:52,572
Hey, there's a doorbell.

442
00:52:52,785 --> 00:52:54,378
OUR FATHER & SONS

443
00:53:11,082 --> 00:53:17,038
I'm Saint Peter, and I can smell
your earthly vessels from in here.

444
00:53:17,248 --> 00:53:21,086
No time to chat, Santa Claus. We're
on a mission and have run out of gas.

445
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:27,977
Gas? I don't know anything about that.
But... come on in and ask.

446
00:53:32,823 --> 00:53:34,736
HEAVEN

447
00:53:35,306 --> 00:53:39,906
Just make your inquiry
at the counter over yonder.

448
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,236
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, -

449
00:53:53,443 --> 00:53:57,599
- so take off your boots
so as not to drag your dust in here.

450
00:53:57,807 --> 00:54:03,206
We need gas.
I demand to talk to your superior.

451
00:54:12,862 --> 00:54:14,695
It's him.

452
00:54:14,904 --> 00:54:21,258
Yo, what's up, guys?
Want a guided tour of the garden?

453
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:25,865
I'm willing to help you suck up
all the water from Earth.

454
00:54:26,075 --> 00:54:29,036
The oceans, the ground water,
the whole shebang.

455
00:54:29,238 --> 00:54:36,435
- And what do you expect in return?
- I want the island of Greenland.

456
00:54:38,006 --> 00:54:43,848
The Kurt Maj Drink is top notch.
It's made from pure Greenland ice.

457
00:54:44,052 --> 00:54:48,972
The Kurt Maj drink,
the only water.

458
00:54:49,177 --> 00:54:51,454
399 $ a bottle.

459
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:56,260
When you've sucked up all the water,
it'll be more valuable than gold.

460
00:54:56,464 --> 00:55:02,101
People have to drink Kurt Maj Drink.
I already extracted large quantities -

461
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:07,708
- and stored it at different spots all
over the world. Have a Kurt Maj drink!

462
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:15,432
You can't do that!

463
00:55:16,764 --> 00:55:18,802
Kill her.

464
00:55:49,876 --> 00:55:52,517
CATALOGUE OF SINS

465
00:56:00,926 --> 00:56:07,167
- Excuse me, are you Jesus?
- No, man. I'm Stand-in Jesus.

466
00:56:07,373 --> 00:56:11,130
My older brother is on Earth
trying to make a comeback.

467
00:56:11,336 --> 00:56:15,492
The old man is making an effort
to get the business booming again.

468
00:56:15,701 --> 00:56:20,654
We haven't had much following
these days.

469
00:56:23,668 --> 00:56:27,347
Disgusting!
Sexually deviant mutants with wings.

470
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:31,675
ADULTERY - DECEIT
TAX FRAUD

471
00:56:31,876 --> 00:56:35,509
Yes! Alright!

472
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,318
SEX DRUGS
AND ROCK'N'ROLL

473
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:45,722
Hell changed its marketing strategy
from eternal punishment and misery.

474
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:49,084
Now their slogan is:
"Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll."

475
00:56:49,293 --> 00:56:54,167
- How can you compete with that?
- Let me go, you disgusting cockatoo!

476
00:56:54,378 --> 00:56:58,580
- Look!
- Let go of me, for fuck's sake!

477
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:02,699
- I haven't got the time to be dead.
- Hey, Per.

478
00:57:02,906 --> 00:57:07,427
- I never thought I'd see you again.
- Where have you been, Per?

479
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:11,833
- Little Per, my friend.
- It's worse than the IRS up here.

480
00:57:12,035 --> 00:57:16,351
I told them I had to return, but
they asked for a load of papers...

481
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,636
- Oh, no. You're not dead, are you?
- No.

482
00:57:20,843 --> 00:57:25,524
- What about the UFO?
- Well, it got away, didn't it?

483
00:57:25,728 --> 00:57:29,168
Let's just find some gas
and blow this hippie commune.

484
00:57:29,372 --> 00:57:33,972
We don't have stuff like that up here.
The whole place is wind-powered.

485
00:57:34,176 --> 00:57:39,779
- God Almighty!
- You must help us save Earth.

486
00:57:39,982 --> 00:57:44,502
Earth?
But that's our entire clientele.

487
00:57:44,707 --> 00:57:49,307
Say, the Holy Ghost might
be able to help you.

488
00:57:54,356 --> 00:57:58,672
What do we need that for?
Ouch, you filthy little creep!

489
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,323
- They're flying vermin.
- Easy now. Trust me.

490
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:08,679
ANGEL PUSSY

491
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:13,092
Unfortunately,
these guys have to return.

492
00:58:15,256 --> 00:58:19,139
- Good luck with it all, then.
- Likewise.

493
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:23,383
- Where do you think you're going?
- What do you mean?

494
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:29,540
Our policy is strict: Once you've died
and gone to Heaven, that's it!

495
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:33,429
- I'm not even a member of the Church.
- What the hell?

496
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:39,157
Fuck off, you fucking parasite!

497
00:58:45,245 --> 00:58:50,370
- Where's it going? Come back.
- Filthy shit bird.

498
00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:12,464
It's a gas station! Right on!

499
00:59:24,483 --> 00:59:29,083
- Look. They sell Danish beer.
- Beer?

500
00:59:29,288 --> 00:59:32,248
Brewsky!

501
00:59:37,415 --> 00:59:39,567
Yes!

502
00:59:47,305 --> 00:59:51,587
- Well, Arne. It's filled up.
- And so what?

503
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:55,752
We have no autopilot,
and our navigator is an impostor!

504
01:00:07,765 --> 01:00:09,358
Right on!

505
01:00:12,129 --> 01:00:17,003
- This beer's heavy.
- Per's never here for manual labour!

506
01:00:18,135 --> 01:00:23,008
Aviation deck, check.
Flaps, check. Engine burst, check.

507
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:26,693
We're ready for lift off.

508
01:00:26,903 --> 01:00:31,857
I found the manual. Just push start,
and we're headed right for Earth.

509
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,150
Well, let's go then, Per.

510
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:11,455
Alright, when the stars beckon,
here we fucking come.

511
01:01:18,073 --> 01:01:20,987
We're flying at 20 times normal speed.

512
01:01:21,196 --> 01:01:26,355
Do we need these translators anymore?
I'm so sore in my butt.

513
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:28,918
It might contain info about the enemy.

514
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:32,642
Keep it up there, and you'll pass
the Dane test the next time.

515
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:46,453
Well, boys. We're almost home.

516
01:02:11,764 --> 01:02:16,047
Hello. Per, is that you?

517
01:02:16,249 --> 01:02:20,040
I thought you were dead.
How did you find your way back?

518
01:02:20,253 --> 01:02:25,378
Per handled that. He turned out
to be an outstanding navigator.

519
01:02:33,986 --> 01:02:38,860
- Susanne, has the UFO arrived?
- Yes, but I've...

520
01:02:39,071 --> 01:02:43,546
- The invasion fleet is on its way.
- The invasion fleet?

521
01:02:43,755 --> 01:02:46,875
Did the dictator
bring a remote control?

522
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:52,204
Of course! The dictator uses
the remote control -

523
01:02:52,404 --> 01:02:56,401
- to log unto the operative system
of other spacecrafts and control them.

524
01:02:56,608 --> 01:03:00,491
If you could get hold of it, we may
be able to stop the entire UFO fleet.

525
01:03:00,692 --> 01:03:04,974
- Okay. I'll do my best.
- We'll come as fast as we can.

526
01:03:07,218 --> 01:03:12,297
So this is where you're hiding,
right in an intergalactic date.

527
01:03:12,503 --> 01:03:15,623
- How sweet.
- Leave her alone!

528
01:03:15,826 --> 01:03:21,907
When the stars beckon,
then big, bad Per is on his way!

529
01:03:22,112 --> 01:03:27,032
Why do you think I picked a bunch
of losers and a bumed-out soldier?

530
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:32,362
You're good for nothing, and that made
you perfect for my little mission.

531
01:03:32,563 --> 01:03:36,320
Wish I had time to chat,
but I've got a planet to suck dry.

532
01:03:36,526 --> 01:03:39,646
Say goodbye to Susanne now.

533
01:03:42,012 --> 01:03:47,967
- I thought you'd done away with them.
- They don't know what they're in for.

534
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:53,374
Put the pedal to the metal. Let's go!

535
01:04:00,349 --> 01:04:04,950
- Where did that come from?
- We're dead meat, boys.

536
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:12,912
We'll hit the moon. Shit! This is
going to be one tough crash landing!

537
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:31,367
Oh, no. The invasion fleet.

538
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:45,982
Why did I join this shitty mission?
I'll never see my dear family again.

539
01:04:46,194 --> 01:04:50,156
I've lost everything
for fucking Denemarci!

540
01:04:50,358 --> 01:04:54,640
Sandwiches, beer and crappy soccer!
You can't even beat the Swedes!

541
01:04:54,842 --> 01:04:59,044
And silly proverbs! Who the hell
lives in a house of glass?

542
01:04:59,246 --> 01:05:04,849
And who wants one bird in the hand?
It's a shitty nation!

543
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,576
I have to speak to my God.

544
01:05:17,784 --> 01:05:23,068
- Where the heck is Mecca?
- Just face Earth. That should do it.

545
01:05:40,606 --> 01:05:45,480
This is the perfect place to erect
your water exploitation machine.

546
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:48,845
You can't just take the water
on Earth. It belongs to all of us.

547
01:05:49,054 --> 01:05:55,534
- You get the Kurt Maj Drink instead.
- But ordinary people can't afford it.

548
01:05:55,741 --> 01:05:58,416
Then they'd better start saving up.

549
01:05:58,624 --> 01:06:02,586
A strong signal on our radars seems
to indicate more incoming UFOs.

550
01:06:02,788 --> 01:06:05,702
It's almost an army.

551
01:06:07,832 --> 01:06:14,027
- So many to build that machine?
- My soldiers won't building anything.

552
01:06:16,921 --> 01:06:19,484
We'll have slaves do the work!

553
01:06:31,415 --> 01:06:35,048
Never point a thing like that at
other people. It's fucking dangerous.

554
01:06:51,955 --> 01:06:55,268
Hold it right there!
We're on our way to Earth -

555
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:59,601
- to stop an alien invasion, and we
don't have time for your foolishness.

556
01:07:29,031 --> 01:07:35,829
Work is progressing at a steady pace.
We expect to be ready in 24 hours.

557
01:07:36,038 --> 01:07:40,274
- You have 12.
- Danes can't work any faster.

558
01:07:40,482 --> 01:07:45,845
Their work ethic has deteriorated from
decades of being public employees.

559
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:52,288
Wrong answer. You're in charge now.
You've got 12 hours, understood?

560
01:07:52,494 --> 01:07:55,215
Start the countdown!

561
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:06,420
Hey, kabob.

562
01:08:21,361 --> 01:08:24,003
Hey, let the grown-ups have a look.

563
01:08:28,528 --> 01:08:30,806
Hornbæk Beach. High society tits!

564
01:08:38,338 --> 01:08:41,811
What's that?

565
01:08:42,021 --> 01:08:45,540
It's the countdown
for the end of the world.

566
01:08:48,147 --> 01:08:52,828
- Susanne!
- Someone ran off with your girl.

567
01:08:53,032 --> 01:08:57,827
- Treachery on the home-front.
- She's been taken hostage!

568
01:08:58,037 --> 01:09:02,000
At least the problem is solved. We'll
nuke the platform and be heroes.

569
01:09:02,201 --> 01:09:07,360
- We can't! Susanne is down there.
- Let me tell you something, Per!

570
01:09:07,566 --> 01:09:12,122
I've only had one true friend,
Gerd, my second in command.

571
01:09:12,331 --> 01:09:17,011
During a mission in Basra,
he was caught in enemy crossfire.

572
01:09:17,215 --> 01:09:21,498
I could either complete the mission
or save Gerd. I chose Gerd.

573
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:26,825
If Gerd died, I wouldn't have anyone
left in my life. Nobody!

574
01:09:27,866 --> 01:09:31,145
It didn't work.
The mission went totally awry.

575
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:34,185
Arne!

576
01:09:34,392 --> 01:09:40,951
Gerd was killed. 60 bullets. I was
demoted from colonel to sergeant.

577
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:45,759
I'd forgotten the most important rule
in the army: The mission comes first.

578
01:09:45,963 --> 01:09:49,482
But this is my chance
to make it right!

579
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:53,889
That's not right, Arne. You went
through the black hole to save me.

580
01:09:54,091 --> 01:09:56,733
It wasn't quite like that.

581
01:09:56,934 --> 01:10:01,854
I get your point about not nuking
anybody, but how can we stop them?

582
01:10:02,059 --> 01:10:08,174
Kurt Maj had a point.
We are just a bunch of losers.

583
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:18,505
We didn't get this far just to end up
nuking hundreds of innocent people.

584
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,790
Did we at any time
have the odds in our favour?

585
01:10:21,998 --> 01:10:25,596
Would a bunch of losers have survived
everything we've been through?

586
01:10:25,802 --> 01:10:29,241
We aren't losers. We're astronauts.

587
01:10:29,445 --> 01:10:33,647
We represent Denmark
in the entire universe-

588
01:10:33,849 --> 01:10:38,245
- and Denmark doesn't nuke innocent
people just to serve a greater cause.

589
01:10:40,496 --> 01:10:44,459
- I suggest we put it to the vote.
- Danish democracy is the thing!

590
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:48,452
All in favour of saving Denmark
in a humane way.

591
01:10:48,664 --> 01:10:52,376
- Hear, hear!
- Utter foolishness!

592
01:11:02,677 --> 01:11:08,952
- Per, do we have a plan?
- No. But I know someone who might.

593
01:11:12,687 --> 01:11:16,000
NEWSATURN RACE - TERRORISTS?
ALIENS DO EXIST

594
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:21,813
Mom! I was supposed to go
with the others to see the aliens.

595
01:11:31,265 --> 01:11:34,021
I think you have some visitors, lb.

596
01:11:35,589 --> 01:11:37,627
Coffee's served.

597
01:11:37,831 --> 01:11:41,987
- Why did we let ourselves be fooled?
- What are we going to do?

598
01:11:42,195 --> 01:11:46,716
Let me see. All aliens are prone to be
eliminated by some Earth stuff.

599
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,236
They may get the flu and die. Or
mosquito spray, shampoo, or cooties.

600
01:11:51,444 --> 01:11:55,123
DUFO has taped everything
on the aliens since they arrived.

601
01:11:55,328 --> 01:11:59,450
We've only got
an hour and a halfleft.

602
01:12:00,573 --> 01:12:03,409
Wait! Rewind a bit.

603
01:12:03,616 --> 01:12:05,688
There. Pause!

604
01:12:05,898 --> 01:12:10,931
- Slow forward.
- How about a beer?

605
01:12:11,143 --> 01:12:13,865
- Why, it's beer!
- Of course!

606
01:13:14,965 --> 01:13:16,798
Yo, have a beer!

607
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:21,207
They're back!

608
01:13:21,411 --> 01:13:25,010
- Per!
- If we have her, they won't touch us.

609
01:13:25,215 --> 01:13:28,767
Keep them out of the control room.
Lead them up to the top deck.

610
01:13:28,979 --> 01:13:33,295
- But how?
- Just do it. Now!

611
01:13:43,112 --> 01:13:47,268
The suction machine!
We have to stop it. Come on, Arne!

612
01:13:49,839 --> 01:13:53,312
Where is the control room?
Overhere, boys.

613
01:13:55,204 --> 01:14:00,442
You! Get all these people
as far away as possible.

614
01:14:04,933 --> 01:14:08,566
- Stop your griping, Susanne.
- Susanne!

615
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:13,332
Let's split up. Arne and Ole,
stop the engine. Jamil, come with me.

616
01:14:25,273 --> 01:14:28,154
You stay here and fix that door.

617
01:14:29,917 --> 01:14:33,596
Come and get me,
you oversized lizard!

618
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,130
Susanne!

619
01:14:57,704 --> 01:14:59,298
Take that!

620
01:15:07,914 --> 01:15:11,797
- Only ten minutes left!
- Yo!

621
01:15:27,733 --> 01:15:30,455
Per! I'm coming!

622
01:15:38,504 --> 01:15:40,781
Jamil...

623
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:46,861
Jamil, no!

624
01:15:48,313 --> 01:15:53,871
- Jamil...
- I can't feel my legs. Cold...

625
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:58,713
Don't die! You have to become a
real Dane. We'll visit the landmarks.

626
01:15:58,923 --> 01:16:02,522
I'll introduce you to Ida Davidsen and
let you taste her open sandwiches.

627
01:16:02,727 --> 01:16:09,492
Per, you need to be a father
to my kids. Jamil Junior and Jamilla.

628
01:16:09,694 --> 01:16:15,296
Promise me to talk to my wife, Nadja,
cousin Ali, uncle Nadim and Dina.

629
01:16:15,499 --> 01:16:19,621
And my cousin and her children,
Hakim and Yassir and their wives -

630
01:16:19,824 --> 01:16:22,624
- and Mohammad, my other cousin...

631
01:16:22,827 --> 01:16:27,427
- Right, right, all of them.
- Wait, I have more pictures here.

632
01:16:28,512 --> 01:16:33,875
There is a lovely country...

633
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:40,799
It didn't penetrate you.
Your photos stopped the bullet!

634
01:16:42,566 --> 01:16:44,398
You made it!

635
01:16:54,577 --> 01:16:57,538
Yo, greenhorn. Cheers!

636
01:17:15,357 --> 01:17:18,432
Right on, Susanne!

637
01:17:19,561 --> 01:17:21,440
Let's get out ofhere.

638
01:17:21,643 --> 01:17:25,845
We have to stop that suction machine.

639
01:17:27,649 --> 01:17:32,090
- What the hell does it say?
- You have to mount a translator.

640
01:17:32,294 --> 01:17:36,928
- You can borrow mine.
- Fine, just hurry up.

641
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:29,419
- What are you up to?
- Anuclear missile is on its way.

642
01:18:29,629 --> 01:18:34,708
- We just need to get out of here.
- Susanne and Ole are still up there!

643
01:18:34,914 --> 01:18:38,547
The mission comes first.
That's the way it is.

644
01:18:45,044 --> 01:18:51,683
- That sounds just about right.
- You could've told me where ite went.

645
01:18:54,573 --> 01:18:55,802
ON/OFF

646
01:19:08,507 --> 01:19:11,900
Why couldn't you just have read it?

647
01:19:13,031 --> 01:19:16,231
- Susanne!
- Per!

648
01:19:18,756 --> 01:19:24,519
You were so good up there! Why didn't
you just come right out and say it?

649
01:19:24,722 --> 01:19:27,444
I thought you were a lame smartass...

650
01:19:27,645 --> 01:19:31,722
Not now!
There's a nuclear missile on its way.

651
01:19:43,661 --> 01:19:46,382
Basra!

652
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:54,508
Arne?

653
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:59,392
I told you I only had one true friend.
I see now that's not true.

654
01:19:59,596 --> 01:20:03,878
I've gained two new friends. Sometimes
friends come before the mission.

655
01:20:05,962 --> 01:20:08,923
Alright, three friends then.

656
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:15,051
Run, dammit, run!

657
01:20:19,055 --> 01:20:24,532
- Arne!
- You shall not pass, you bastard!

658
01:20:33,589 --> 01:20:35,502
Arne!

659
01:20:48,964 --> 01:20:51,844
We can't get away. He's too heavy.

660
01:20:53,888 --> 01:20:55,926
Jamil, the gun!

661
01:20:56,931 --> 01:20:59,846
Bottoms up!

662
01:21:10,024 --> 01:21:12,905
- Right on, man!
- Yeehaw!

663
01:21:15,509 --> 01:21:18,106
Hurry up! The missile is coming.

664
01:21:20,474 --> 01:21:22,228
Yeehaw!

665
01:21:24,558 --> 01:21:29,238
Fools! I have thousands of UFOs
left in the universe.

666
01:21:29,443 --> 01:21:33,234
Did you really think it would be
that easy to beat me?

667
01:21:35,609 --> 01:21:38,000
Shit!

668
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:12,198
Would a desert princess like you like
to see the palm rise at Ole's oasis?

669
01:22:12,404 --> 01:22:18,201
- Bloody hell, Ole!
- Remember: Respect for traditions.

670
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:21,610
That doesn't count
when we're talking about my cousin.

671
01:22:21,813 --> 01:22:25,092
Do you really understand Danish
if you use one of these?

672
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:34,224
- Where will we spend our honeymoon?
- We could begin with the Milky Way.

673
01:22:34,425 --> 01:22:37,340
And after that
we'll just follow the stars.

674
01:22:47,358 --> 01:22:50,319
SUSANNE HAS GOT
ATIGHT PUSSY

675
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:39,198
I sensed that something was not right
with the strangers, -

676
01:23:39,408 --> 01:23:44,089
- so I decided to isolate them at
my oil field and exterminate them.

677
01:23:44,293 --> 01:23:48,893
It was a tough battle, but my plan
worked. I had them exterminated.

678
01:23:49,098 --> 01:23:54,461
And now: Kurt Maj Enterprises has
always been very keen -

679
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:58,102
- on getting cheap, alternative
energy resources forthe Danes.

680
01:23:58,306 --> 01:24:04,308
So let me introduce my latest project:
The Journey to the Sun!

681
01:24:11,559 --> 01:24:21,279
THE END

682
01:26:07,151 --> 01:26:13,710
What the hell? They haven't
been true to the comic at all!

683
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,314
THE END
