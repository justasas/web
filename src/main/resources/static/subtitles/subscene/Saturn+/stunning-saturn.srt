00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,000
This month, we are at the Harwell Space Cluster, near Oxford, 

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,080
home to some of the biggest names in the exploration of our universe. 

3
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,960
There is the European Space Agency, 

4
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,720
the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, 

5
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,440
and Chris and I have been invited 

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,800
to the new Satellite Applications Catapult, 

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,520
who are building business links to astronomy and space science. 

8
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,760
Tonight's programme is all about Saturn, one of the first things 

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,960
I saw through a telescope and still my favourite planet. 

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,200
Saturn is famous for its fantastic rings, but there is so much more 

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,040
to this mysterious planet, including its very strange moons. 

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,320
Chris North is here too, 

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,240
and he'll be answering some of your Space Surgery questions. 

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,600
And because Saturn is so well placed in the night sky at the minute, 

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,280
Peter and Paul have headed off to Hampshire 

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,400
to see if they can catch a glimpse. 

17
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, my word! Look at that. 

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,600
I think that's the best view I've had of Saturn all night. 

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. 

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,880
Spectacular Saturn, 

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,240
out amongst the stars of Virgo. 

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,640
The reason we have such amazing images of Saturn and its moons 

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,000
is because we've had a spacecraft there for almost ten years - Cassini. 

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,400
Cassini has an amazing camera 

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,720
and we have been astounded by the images it has been sending back, 

26
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,760
forcing us to rethink our ideas about Saturn, 

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,400
its rings and its moons. 

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,600
It can see in different wavelengths - 

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,200
useful if you want to peer through the layers of Saturn's atmosphere. 

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,240
We're joined by Leigh Fletcher to tell us about stunning Saturn. 

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,640
Now, Leigh, Saturn is basically a giant ball of gas, isn't it? 

32
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,240
That's right. It's an enormous ball of gas 

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,000
that's 95 times more heavy than Planet Earth. 

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,640
But, in fact, because its density is so low, 

35
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,720
it's made mostly of hydrogen and helium, if you were able 

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,600
to take it and put it in a bathtub, it would float on water. 

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,880
- It's the least dense planet in the solar system. 
- That's right. 

38
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,080
Here we're seeing it fantastically lit up by the sun on this side 

39
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
and rings casting beautiful shadows. 

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,720
Yeah, you're seeing the shadow of the rings 

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,640
and one of the important things about this image is, it shows you 

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,720
that Saturn normally looks rather bland 

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,760
compared to something like Jupiter, that you're familiar with. 

44
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,720
But even though it looks featureless, there are indications 

45
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,440
- of very dynamic things happening in Saturn's atmosphere. 
- Oh, absolutely. 

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,080
It's a meteorologist's paradise. 

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,840
We can actually study the weather system of this giant planet 

48
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,160
and one of the beauties of having Cassini there 

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,440
for almost a decade now is that we can explore 

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,120
all the different seasons taking place in this giant. 

51
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,800
So if we go to the next image, we can see a storm on Saturn. 

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,040
We do get storm activity occurring. 

53
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,840
It's maybe not quite as dramatic as something like Jupiter. 

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,960
Yeah, it doesn't stand out quite as much as Jupiter's great red spot. 

55
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,120
It does look slightly like the world's largest seagull! 

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,760
But every now and then, 

57
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,560
you get something really special happening on Saturn 

58
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,600
and we were lucky enough with Cassini to witness such an event 

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,160
over the last couple of years. 

60
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,840
Well, let's go back to look at that. 

61
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,040
- Let's start with December 2010, so that's this image here. 
- There we go. 

62
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,480
There's something going on, 

63
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,520
there's a little storm, but not much going on, 

64
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,760
and then where shall we go next? January, I guess. 

65
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,440
- Oh, and it's broken out here. 
- You can see the difference 

66
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,240
between these two images 

67
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,040
over just a month of time. 

68
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,920
So the storm has popped up 

69
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,600
and it's popped up into these winds 

70
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,720
that are rapidly circulating around Saturn 

71
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,360
and it's starting to be drawn up. 

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,320
Let's go on to February 2011, 

73
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,640
and you can really see what that's done to the storm, 

74
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,400
so this storm has been stretched out. 

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,760
We should say, these winds you described on Saturn, 

76
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,280
- they're some of the solar system's fastest. 
- That's right, 

77
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,720
and this goes back to the idea that it's Saturn's own internal energy 

78
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,600
which is powering and creating these very fast winds. 

79
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,680
The thing that strikes me is the detail available in this image, 

80
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,400
so let's bring the storm up and put it right across the screen 

81
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,640
and you'll see what I mean. 

82
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,320
We've got incredible details here, 

83
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,800
and this is the head of the storm 

84
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,520
and if you think that the Earth is the size of this image, 

85
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,160
you get a sense of how big this thing really is. 

86
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,760
What's happening in this swirling cloud structure? 

87
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,200
Well, we had this huge plume of activity 

88
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,520
dredging up ammonia ice and water ice, 

89
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,640
and it deposited it at the cloud tops, 

90
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,440
and so the winds that are taking place in the clouds 

91
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,880
then waft all of this material downstream. 

92
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,640
At the same time, we were detecting 

93
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,600
super Saturnian lightning bolts within this atmosphere, 

94
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
which create this incredible structure. 

95
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
What is it we have happening here? Is this the head of the storm now? 

96
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,600
This I like to think of as the heart of the storm itself. 

97
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,080
What you're seeing here 

98
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,160
is the birth of a large churning vortex within Saturn's cloud tops. 

99
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,400
So these storms are absolutely fascinating, 

100
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,120
but actually, there's some really interesting activity 

101
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,200
happening up at the poles of Saturn, so let's have a look at those. 

102
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,560
Right. So what do we have here? 

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,240
You immediately see so much more detail. 

104
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,440
The thing that really stands out in this image for me 

105
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,680
is the large-scale structure, this incredible hexagonal wave. 

106
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,680
We don't see anything like this anywhere else in the solar system. 

107
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,280
We don't know why it's a hexagon, 

108
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,400
and this goes back to what we were talking about with a plughole, 

109
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,440
a swirling vortex of air 

110
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,040
right at the north pole of Saturn. 

111
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,560
- So what comes up at the equator goes down in the poles. 
- Must come down. 

112
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,920
Cassini captured this particular movie... 

113
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,160
- Oh, wow. 
- That's fantastic. 
- ..back in November of last year. 

114
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,440
You can see this incredible, churning weather system. 

115
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,480
That plughole you keep referring to 

116
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,440
is right in the heart of this swirling vortex. 

117
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,360
Now, the gas that's contained within this vortex is hot, 

118
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,360
and you know that if you squeeze a gas together, it heats up, 

119
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,040
and that sinking action is heating the air 

120
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,520
within this swirling hurricane. 

121
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,240
They're fabulous images and fantastic science, 

122
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,360
so, Leigh, thank you very much. 

123
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,080
And fantastic though Saturn is, it's now time to look at the rings. 

124
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,280
The rings of Saturn never fail to look spectacular. 

125
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
We can see them quite clearly, 

126
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,520
even through a small telescope 

127
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,600
but get up close and you see they are extremely complex, 

128
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,680
made of hundreds of individual ringlets, 

129
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,040
with some extending far out into space. 

130
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,000
What's mind-blowing is that these structures are not solid. 

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,440
They're made largely of tiny pieces of ice, dust and small rocks. 

132
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,080
There are small moons running round within the rings, 

133
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,560
called shepherd moons, 

134
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,560
which create gaps and form these amazing structures. 

135
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,040
But Saturn's rings still hold many mysteries. 

136
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,240
Crucially, we still don't know 

137
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,680
how or when the rings were formed, 

138
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,240
but there are a couple of opposing theories. 

139
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,600
This is a fantastic image of Saturn 

140
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,720
showing its rings beautifully on our video wall. 

141
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,440
Now, Saturn's being backlit, the sun is setting behind. 

142
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,920
You can just see the sunlight coming through here, 

143
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,640
and this is us here on the Earth, 

144
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,520
but they look absolutely fantastic, Chris, these rings. 

145
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,240
It's amazing to see the Earth through Saturn's rings, 

146
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
but the rings themselves are exciting too 

147
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,960
and new results from Cassini 

148
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,680
have told us they're even more interesting than we thought. 

149
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,960
One thing that surprised me 

150
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,120
was that the rings are thinner than we thought. 

151
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,800
They're just, in places, 10 to 30 metres thick, 

152
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,320
so that's about the height of a three-storey building 

153
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,160
and something that thin produces this spectacular structure. 

154
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,320
One of the other mysteries about the rings is how old they are. 

155
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,960
People have argued that because they're very bright, 

156
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,880
they must be made of fresh water ice 

157
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,960
or they have fresh water ice within them, 

158
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,440
and if there's fresh ice, 

159
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,040
that means they're young rings, no more than a few million years old. 

160
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,920
But you could also argue that the rings are in fact very old 

161
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,480
and they're something that formed 

162
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,000
close in time to the formation of the planet itself. 

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,040
It's one of the key things that we need to understand about Saturn. 

164
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,160
Whether the rings are old or young, they're certainly beautiful, 

165
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,880
but we can't talk about Saturn 

166
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,960
without also mentioning its family of amazing moons. 

167
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,480
The moons of Saturn are strange, wonderful and plentiful, 

168
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,040
with the current tally running to 62, 

169
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,320
most of them discovered within the last 15 years. 

170
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
There's Mimas, the "Death Star moon" 

171
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,240
with its large impact crater. 

172
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,920
Then there's Iapatus, the "yin-yang moon" 

173
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,880
and thanks to Cassini, we now know that its odd colouring 

174
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,000
is due to dust sprayed onto it 

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,040
from the tiny moon Phoebe. 

176
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,520
Still mysterious, though, 

177
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,240
is the ridge of ten-mile-high mountains around its equator. 

178
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,320
Weird Hyperion looks like a big sponge 

179
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,160
and is probably more similar to a pile of rubble than a solid moon. 

180
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,200
And finally, there's Enceladus, perhaps the strangest world of all, 

181
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,520
with its fountains of water spewing into space 

182
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,440
and feeding Saturn's E ring. 

183
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,800
The discovery of Enceladus' fountains by Cassini was remarkable 

184
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,640
and it took some plucky flying! 

185
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,800
Something strange had been spotted 

186
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,840
in the magnetic field around the moon's south pole, 

187
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,400
but to investigate this tantalising clue, 

188
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,000
the spacecraft had to go dangerously close to the moon. 

189
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,360
Following up on this hunch 

190
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,240
was the responsibility of Cassini's Michele Dougherty. 

191
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,440
What was it that first made you realise 

192
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,160
Enceladus had something unusual going on? 

193
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,800
The magnetic field looked different. When we looked at the data, 

194
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,640
we could see that it was draping around Enceladus, 

195
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,160
so it was almost as if it wasn't able to go down 

196
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,600
onto the surface of the moon, so something was holding it off. 

197
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,200
There was an obstacle that shouldn't have been there. 

198
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,560
It was almost like there was an atmosphere, 

199
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,240
so we thought we'd be brave and we went to the Cassini project. 

200
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,400
I spoke to the guy responsible for the spacecraft 

201
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,480
and I said, "I want to fly much closer to Enceladus than planned," 

202
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,280
and he said, "Oh, that's cool!" 

203
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,680
So they changed the third fly-by to be 173 kilometres above the surface, 

204
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,440
and fortuitously, it was going to fly below the south pole. 

205
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
And that's when we realised 

206
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,640
that there were actually cracks on the surface, 

207
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,840
which the imaging team called tiger stripes, and out of these cracks, 

208
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,800
water vapour was leaking, and so that was the atmosphere that we had seen. 

209
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,520
So you've got this leaking water. Where it is coming from? 

210
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,560
There's a liquid source underneath the surface, 

211
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,240
a water ocean of some kind. 

212
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
Why it's there we don't know, because Enceladus is small. 

213
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,920
It should have cooled down a long time ago, 

214
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,680
so something is keeping its interior warm, but it's not only water. 

215
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,840
We've seen organic material as well. 

216
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,560
Organic means chemicals, complex chemicals with carbon? 

217
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,160
Carbon, nitrogen, methane, benzene. 

218
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,400
All we know is that 

219
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,840
at this little moon that we thought was a dead body, 

220
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,680
there is a liquid reservoir under the surface. 

221
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,200
Dust, water vapour, organic materials are leaking out. 

222
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,240
For me, Titan is the most exiting of Saturn's moons. 

223
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,280
In the 1980s, Voyager, in flying past, 

224
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,600
saw an orange ball with a thick hazy atmosphere 

225
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,480
made up of nitrogen, methane and complex hydrocarbons. 

226
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,840
It has taken Cassini, with some help from its tiny lander Huygens, 

227
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,360
to show us what Titan's surface is really like. 

228
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,040
In January 2005, Huygens was released from the mother spacecraft. 

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,680
This descent movie shows it plunging through the atmosphere, 

230
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,240
being buffeted by winds which blow at up to 300 miles an hour. 

231
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,240
On board, a microphone recorded the eerie sound of a moon, 

232
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,200
a billion miles away from those of us listening in on Earth. 

233
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,160
WIND RUSHES 

234
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,080
Finally, Huygens dropped through the clouds 

235
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,280
and was able to see the surface, 

236
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,760
complete with cliffs, rivers and even the shore of an ancient lake. 

237
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,080
When it landed on the surface, it cracked one of the icy pebbles, 

238
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,360
the first example 

239
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,400
of a prang on another world. 

240
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,400
Since then, the Cassini spacecraft 

241
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,480
has been using radar to map the surface. 

242
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,800
Smooth surfaces show up dark, 

243
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,880
so these black and blue areas seem to be liquid of some sort. 

244
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,800
At minus 180 degrees, this can't be water. 

245
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,640
These lakes are made of liquid methane. 

246
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,200
Cassini can also see in infrared, 

247
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,240
picking up the signs of clouds as well as land. 

248
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,160
Titan, it seems, is a complex world, 

249
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,480
just like our own. 

250
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,360
What we've learned about Titan since Cassini arrived 

251
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,000
has transformed our view of this fascinating moon, 

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,120
and with us to discuss those new results is Annie Wellbrook. 

253
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,040
- Welcome to the programme. 
- Thank you. 

254
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,360
What we have here is a beautiful image of Titan, 

255
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,200
but what exactly is it showing? 

256
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,960
This is actually showing the terrain of Titan, 

257
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,640
so we can see the brighter areas are actually high plains of Titan, 

258
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,120
and the darker areas are kind of the surface, 

259
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,400
so all this different terrain, it's actually very similar to Earth. 

260
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,120
If we go to the next image we have, 

261
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,640
we can start to see some of these Earth-like features. 

262
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,400
This is an incredible image. This is presumably a river. 

263
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,360
Yes, absolutely. It's feeding into a lake on the left there. 

264
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,000
You can see how the river is meandering 

265
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,360
and it's just like a river on Earth, really. 

266
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,080
But if we're talking about rain, we're talking about weather, 

267
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,160
so does it change as the seasons change? 

268
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,960
Yes, Cassini has now been in the Saturn system for almost ten years. 

269
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,400
We can now start to observe seasonal changes 

270
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,200
and that's such an exciting thing to do 

271
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,120
because we're realising that, actually, 

272
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,520
the seasonal changes are again similar to Earth's seasonal changes. 

273
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,040
Where does all this methane come from on Titan? What's the source? 

274
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,520
It has been kind of a mystery for a while 

275
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,040
because there's all this methane in the atmosphere 

276
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,320
and it gets broken apart by sunlight. For a long time, 

277
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,840
scientists have thought that 

278
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,320
there must be a source replenishing the methane, 

279
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,040
but actually, there was a recent paper where they talk about 

280
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,320
maybe the methane isn't being replenished, 

281
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,080
and Titan is going to run out of methane 

282
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
in tens of millions of years. 

283
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,520
That seems really quick. 

284
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,320
Yeah, in planetary terms that is not a very long time. 

285
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,640
But I really didn't know about this! And I'm really disappointed. 

286
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,400
This is actually really upsetting, 

287
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,520
because I wanted Titan to be a place with methane, with oceans, 

288
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,600
with lakes, with places where life might have even got started. 

289
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,320
People thought of it as a laboratory for the early Earth, 

290
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,360
and now you're telling me that might just be 

291
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,160
the last few tens of millions of years. 

292
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,800
Maybe. At the moment it is a theory, 

293
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,920
and there's still plenty of methane around. 

294
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,040
In your lifetime, it's not going to run out! 

295
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,120
- So don't worry about that. 
- That's good to know. 

296
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,960
Whether we're down on the surface or up at the top of the atmosphere, 

297
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,040
there's no doubt this is a fascinating world, 

298
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,280
so thank you so much for coming to tell us about it. 

299
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,320
Thank you very much. 

300
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,360
When you think that all we used to know of Titan 

301
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,840
was that it was an orange ball, 

302
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,680
it's now amazing to think what might be going on beneath these clouds. 

303
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,280
Our exploration of Saturn has come to an end 

304
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,240
and we're coming back down to Earth 

305
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,400
to find out about a camera that's being built right here. 

306
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,320
At the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory 

307
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,080
they are getting two very special cameras ready for space, 

308
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,520
and a journey to the International Space Station. 

309
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,400
Looking at Earth is a magical experience. 

310
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,680
You never get tired of an astronaut's view of our home planet. 

311
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,240
There are no space cameras available to the public 

312
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,720
which can see the Earth's surface in detail, until now. 

313
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,560
When fitted, we will be able 

314
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,680
to look at the Earth's surface, 

315
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,080
making out metre-sized objects, 

316
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,840
for the very first time. 

317
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,480
'Called Urthecast, it's a Canadian venture 

318
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
'with Russian and British partners, 

319
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,520
'and Tom Morse is the electronic design engineer 

320
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,240
'who's working on the project.' 

321
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,800
Right, so we're here at the entrance to the clean rooms, 

322
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,640
where the cameras are being assembled. In order to go in there, 

323
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,720
we need to get all kitted up in the clean room gear 

324
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,680
to make sure we don't do anything that will contaminate the cameras. 

325
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,760
I feel like I'm being some sort of dinner lady! 

326
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,720
- Right, a face mask here. 
- Thanks. 
- So if you hold on to that bit. 

327
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,320
Just pull it over your head. 

328
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,480
Ah-ha, here we have it. 

329
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,200
So here we have the high-resolution Urthecast camera. 

330
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,560
This is going to be mounted on a steerable platform 

331
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,160
on the Russian segment of the International Space Station. 

332
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,480
It's going to be taking video at 3.25 frames a second 

333
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,320
looking down onto Earth and beaming those pictures down to Earth, 

334
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,360
so anybody can access those at home. 

335
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,520
What size of features will this telescope be able to pick out? 

336
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,840
It'll be able to pick out features about 1.1 metres on the ground, 

337
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,720
so you'll be able to see houses, 

338
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,520
you'll be able to see sporting stadiums, you'll be able to see 

339
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,440
natural disasters taking place on the Earth from space. 

340
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,360
What about the other camera? What will that be doing? 

341
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,120
As well as the high-resolution camera, 

342
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,440
we've got what we call the medium-resolution camera, 

343
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,000
and that camera will be pointing 

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,880
directly down from the space station, 

345
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,560
scanning across the Earth at 17,000 miles per hour 

346
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,600
and building up strip images of the ground as it passes over. 

347
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,080
And as the Earth rotates underneath that orbit 

348
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,440
it's going to build up a picture of the entire Earth. 

349
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,080
And how frequently will this camera 

350
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,680
be able to build up a complete snapshot of the Earth? 

351
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,880
We're looking at revisiting each spot on the Earth 

352
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,200
about roughly every month, something like that. 

353
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
This is a totally new kind of project, isn't it? 

354
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,360
We haven't had these kind of images publicly available before? 

355
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Exactly, so the point of Urthecast is to give everybody on Earth 

356
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,880
the perspective that you can get from the space station. 

357
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,600
People in their armchairs at home are going to be able to log in 

358
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,360
with their laptops or their phones and they'll be able to see 

359
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,120
what an astronaut's-eye view is like from space. 

360
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,240
The cameras go up to the International Space Station in October, 

361
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,360
and I know I'll be giving it a try. 

362
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,720
It's back now to stunning Saturn 

363
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,160
to join Pete and Paul in Hampshire, 

364
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,400
who hope to see it in the night sky. 

365
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,600
'Pete and I have come to Clanfield 

366
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,040
'to visit the Hampshire Astronomical Group, 

367
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,880
'who affectionately call themselves HAGs!' 

368
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,200
The group have a variety of telescopes. 

369
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,480
This one is 117 years old. 

370
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,800
'Graham Bryant helps keep it in fine working order.' 

371
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,080
Hello! 

372
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,800
Oh, wow, look at that. A proper telescope. It's very impressive. 

373
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,080
- This is a refractor. 
- It is. 
- What size is this? 

374
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,960
We've got a five-inch Cook refractor 

375
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,640
- and a four-and-a-half-inch Smith, Beck, and Beck. 
- Wow. 

376
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,840
What sort of focal length are you talking about? 

377
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,880
The Cook is an F17 so it's brilliant for planetary and lunar work. 

378
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,320
And what about this? This looks like the original drive. 

379
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,760
- It is, yes. This is an old weight drive. 
- Wow. 

380
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,880
I tell the visitors that this was driven by gravity. 

381
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,120
- Is it easy to manoeuvre? 
- Yes. 
- Let's have a little... 

382
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,240
- Oh, that's very smooth motion. 
- Yes. 

383
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,520
See, this is much better than yours, Pete. A proper telescope! 

384
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,640
It's very impressive. What sort of things do you concentrate on here? 

385
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,760
This is used mainly for planetary work, lunar work and solar work. 

386
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,240
Well, it's clearing up nicely up there, so I wouldn't mind 

387
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,800
- having a look at Saturn through this later. 
- That would be good. 

388
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,960
The sun is setting 

389
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,800
and it's time to brave the elements and set up the telescopes. 

390
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,080
A small group of astronomers have joined us, 

391
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,200
some of whom are new to the wonderful world of Saturn. 

392
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,480
Can you see to that one, or does it need to come lower again? 

393
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,200
A bit lower, please. 

394
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,560
Paul and Olivia live nearby. 

395
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,880
- What have you got in the telescope? 
- Currently, we're looking at Jupiter. 

396
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,120
- Can I have a look? 
- Certainly can. 
- Let's have a look. What have we got? 

397
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,600
That's a lovely image. 

398
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,480
- I see one of the satellites is transiting. 
- Satellites? 

399
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,480
A satellite is a moon and Jupiter has four really big ones, 

400
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,280
Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, 

401
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,440
and if you have a look through the telescope, what can you see? 

402
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,720
There are two moons to the right of Jupiter, 

403
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,760
but because this is reversed 

404
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,400
and it's back-to-front, 

405
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,080
it looks like it's at the bottom, but it's at the top. 

406
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,920
Pete Lawrence, the fountain of all knowledge and wisdom, 

407
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,720
has just informed me it's Callisto, 

408
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
so that's one of the moons passing over. 

409
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,160
- Quite pretty, isn't it? 
- Yeah. 

410
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,640
Hopefully, later on, Saturn will be rising over there in the east, 

411
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,160
so we can have a look at it, 

412
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,320
and your telescope should bring out some nice details, I think. 

413
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,080
For Christina, Saturn is one planet 

414
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,360
she has been looking forward to getting in her viewfinder. 

415
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,040
- Christina! 
- Hello! 
- Hello again, hi. 

416
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,640
What are you looking at? The moon? 

417
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,120
I'm looking at the moon, yes, big and bright. 

418
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,280
It's actually first quarter at the moment, 

419
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,440
so that shadow line is right the way down the middle of the moon. 

420
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,480
- Have you had a chance to get out and see Saturn? 
- I have. 
- You have? 

421
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,880
- I've seen it for the first time. 
- Wow. What was your reaction? 

422
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,280
- Wow! 
- Yeah, it is, isn't it? 

423
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,600
I mean, it was teeny tiny, but still wow. 

424
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,840
Becky is new to astronomy and really enjoying it. 

425
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,960
- Becky, welcome to The Sky At Night. 
- Thank you. 

426
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,280
- You're an absolute beginner, aren't you? 
- Total absolute beginner, yeah. 

427
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,280
What sort of things have you been looking at? 

428
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,200
I've been looking at Jupiter as that's the easiest to find in the sky 

429
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,840
and I remember seeing Jupiter for the first time through it 

430
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,320
and it was like, "Wow, that's absolutely amazing." 

431
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,280
Have you had any luck with anything else? 

432
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,400
I'm hoping to see Saturn tonight, that's kind of on my tick list today. 

433
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,960
- Fingers crossed for clear skies! 
- Thank you very much. 

434
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,800
- Let's hope for the best. 
- Thank you. 

435
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,800
With a small telescope, 

436
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,720
you can see Saturn and its rings and some of the moons, 

437
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,520
but with a bigger one, you can see much more detail 

438
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,880
such as the subtle banding on the planet. 

439
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,840
Its rings have features too - 

440
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,320
the outer A ring, then a gap 

441
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,000
called the Cassini Division, 

442
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,880
and then the inner B ring. 

443
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,880
Yeah, I thought it would be a bit of a blur, 

444
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,960
but you can actually see everything. 

445
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,280
- Yeah. 
- You can see the rings and... 
- Yeah. Yes. 

446
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,360
Tonight, with Saturn so low down, 

447
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,520
it's going to be tough to see that detail. 

448
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,800
Ah, Olivia, you're looking through the telescope. 

449
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,120
That's what I like to see. What are you looking at? 

450
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,840
I'm looking at a picture of Saturn. 

451
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,920
So what do you think of it as a planet? 

452
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,240
It's quite nice with the rings. 

453
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,000
- You can see the divisions, and you can see the moons. 
- Yeah? 

454
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,880
When you're looking at the rings, so you've got the planet in the middle 

455
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,160
and you've got the rings that go around them, so you can see the gap 

456
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,840
- between the rings and the planet, you can see that? 
- Yeah. 

457
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,080
Can you see in the rings that there is a sort of dark line 

458
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,640
running around between the rings, 

459
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,520
sort of dividing them up? 

460
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,640
- It's not easy to see. 
- Sort of. 
- Sort of? 

461
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,360
Keep a look out for it, and it will get better. 

462
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,160
So, we're with Becky 

463
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,440
- and you've done something brand-new tonight, haven't you? 
- Yes, I have. 

464
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,680
- Go on, tell them. Tell them! 
- It's totally amazing. 

465
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,280
- I have actually found Saturn through my telescope. 
- Hurray! 

466
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,840
- Well done! 
- Brilliant! 

467
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,160
You've got your little three-inch telescope here. 

468
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,920
It's obviously Saturn, isn't it? 

469
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,600
With the rings and the satellite, so you must be very proud. 

470
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,360
Yeah, I'm really proud. It took me a while, but I'm so excited 

471
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,560
that I found it. It's absolutely brilliant. 

472
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,400
You have to be patient when looking at the planets, 

473
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,040
especially Saturn with its gentle pastel colouring. 

474
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,560
Keep looking through the eyepiece and that detail should emerge. 

475
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,200
- Come and have a look at this. 
- OK. 

476
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,880
Your perseverance will pay off. 

477
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,560
Oh, yeah. You can start to see the shadows on the globe now. 

478
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,760
If you'd like to find Saturn in May's night sky, go to our website. 

479
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,480
Pete has some helpful star charts. 

480
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,680
There are some nice globular clusters such as M13. 

481
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
You'll find charts for those too. 

482
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,240
Yeah. That's amazing. 

483
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,120
- Beautiful, isn't it? 
- Wonderful. 

484
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,240
We have one more chance to see Saturn with the old telescope. 

485
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,200
- Hello there. 
- We thought we'd come back for a final view of Saturn 

486
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,360
through this magnificent antique piece of yours. 

487
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,800
Well, it's a very nice, steady view at the moment. 

488
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,520
- Do you want to take a look, Pete? 
- I'd love to have a look. 

489
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,400
- Go on, you go first. 
- This is 117 years old, this telescope. 

490
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,880
- Yes. 
- That's incredible. 

491
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,000
It looks so beautiful, doesn't it, in this light? 

492
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,560
- Oh, that's just gorgeous. 
- Is it a good view? 

493
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,400
It's absolutely beautiful. That's the classic view 

494
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,720
that looks as if someone's cut out a picture of Saturn 

495
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,160
- and stuck it on the front of the telescope. 
- Absolutely. 

496
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,520
- Let's have a look. 
- It's lovely, absolutely beautiful. 

497
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,760
And where's the focusing? 

498
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,320
Ah, there it is. So let's have a look. What have we got? 

499
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,080
Oh, my word, look at that. 

500
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,480
That is a magnificent view. I have to say, 

501
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,200
I think this is better than the view in your 24-inch. 

502
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,640
The magic is always there. 

503
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,360
Spectacular Saturn, out amongst the stars of Virgo. 

504
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,720
Well, thanks, Graham, 

505
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,920
for showing us Saturn in this beautiful constructed telescope. 

506
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,720
I think it's been one the best views of Saturn for a long time. 

507
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,760
- Thank you very much, Graham. That was brilliant. 
- You're both welcome. 

508
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,280
Well, weren't Pete and Paul lucky to get such good weather? 

509
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,600
Let's hope we have clear skies this month too. 

510
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,200
The Sky At Night's Space Surgery 

511
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,600
has been receiving lots and lots of your queries, 

512
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,720
and on call this month, as ever, Chris North. 

513
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,720
- Chris, what have you got for us? 
- We've had a lot of questions 

514
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,120
and our first one this month refers to the planet Saturn, 

515
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,400
that we've talked about for most of the programme. 

516
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,280
Coming in from James Coyle, aged five, from Northern Ireland, 

517
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,480
who asks... 

518
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,760
James, although Saturn is the planet that's by far the most famous 

519
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,400
for its beautiful ring system, 

520
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,920
the other planets, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, the large planets, 

521
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,080
do in fact have ring systems. 

522
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,600
They're very hard to detect, they're very faint, 

523
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,440
and they've only been discovered in the last few decades. 

524
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,880
Chris, our next question is for you. It refers to last month's programme. 

525
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,520
It comes in from Kevin Geary, and many others, 

526
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,160
who've asked about that rock you were holding 

527
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,960
that you claimed was from Mars. 

528
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,520
People should just believe me. 

529
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,280
I think that's the easy way, but actually, the reason we know 

530
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,280
this particular rock was from Mars is, we have sort of been there. 

531
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,720
We've sent probes there, 

532
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,440
and in particular, the Viking probes in the '70s 

533
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,000
told us about the chemical composition of the Martian rocks 

534
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,640
and, in fact, the atmosphere. 

535
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,520
So when we find that composition in a meteorite that's landed on Earth, 

536
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,080
we are able to say yes, this definitely isn't Earthly, 

537
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,560
this rock comes from Mars. 

538
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,080
And they're precious because these are the only samples we get back, 

539
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,240
so until we go to Mars and pick some up, we need these meteorites, 

540
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,400
but we can be sure they're from Mars. 

541
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,920
And, Lucie, finally, last one is for you. 

542
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,080
It refers to the gas giants again, 

543
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,720
so Jupiter and also Saturn have atmospheres 

544
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,560
of mainly hydrogen and helium. 

545
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,440
Audrey Michie from Turriff asks... 

546
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,000
So as the meteor comes in, 

547
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,600
it does indeed burn up as it goes through the atmosphere, 

548
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,680
but even though hydrogen is very explosive, for example, 

549
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,440
if I had a balloon full of hydrogen and I put a flame to it, 

550
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,960
it would explode and make a huge bang. 

551
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,280
We also use hydrogen to get rockets into space because we burn it, 

552
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,520
and there is no oxygen in these planets 

553
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,440
to allow the hydrogen to burn, so that's why it doesn't set light. 

554
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,920
Lucky for the planets, I guess, 

555
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,920
otherwise it would be a very big fireball! 

556
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,080
Keep your questions about this programme 

557
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,720
or in fact anything to do with astronomy coming in. 

558
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,600
You can do that at our website... 

559
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,400
We look forward to the challenges you'll set us. 

560
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,200
Yes, do try to catch Chris out. But when we come back next month, 

561
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,000
we'll be talking about the lives of the stars. So until then... 

562
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,160
ALL: Good night. 

563
