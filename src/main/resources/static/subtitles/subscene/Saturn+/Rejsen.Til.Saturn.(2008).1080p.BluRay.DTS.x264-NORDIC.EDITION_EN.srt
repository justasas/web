00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:18,915
JOURNEY TO SATURN

2
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,249
No! My beer!
What the hell ...

3
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,707
Dear Denmark. Dear Danes.

4
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:12,832
In less than 24 hours, the greatest
event in our history will take place:

5
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:16,165
Kurt Maj's Saturn Expedition!

6
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,582
The purpose is to find
eco-friendly energy resources -

7
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:25,624
- that will benefit people on Earth
and the Danish welfare state.

8
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,332
We transmit live from Cape Kurt.

9
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:35,540
But let's have a closer look
at the project's creator: Kurt Maj!

10
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:41,415
Kurt Maj, tycoon and media kingpin,
is a man of many talents.

11
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,332
Deeply affected by the rapidly
escalating global warming, -

12
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:50,665
- Kurt Mej has made it his personal
cause to fight for the environment.

13
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,415
And now he is on his way
to the stars - always the pioneer!

14
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,082
You're on ln ten minutes, Per.
How's the sult?

15
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:11,290
Well, lt's not as cool as the one
l wore for NASA's Mars Misslon.

16
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:15,624
But then again, l'm not exactly
going on a 48 hour space walk' am l?

17
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:20,207
You're so cool, Per.

18
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,832
You and me, Per. Forover!

19
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:36,832
DANlSH UFO ASSOClATlON
ANNUAL CONVENTlON

20
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:47,374
Per! Per! Per! Per!

21
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:56,040
And now,
the man we've all been waltlng for:

22
00:03:56,375 --> 00:04:01,457
Lecturer and real-life astronaut:
Per Jensen!

23
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,957
- When the stars beckon ...
- Here we come!

24
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:31,832
Per! Per! Per! Per!

25
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:42,332
... that you cannot refuse.

26
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:47,790
Drop by Earth and let's chat.
l look forward to meeting you.

27
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:50,749
NAME FlLE:

28
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:06,665
- Mr. Maj! Over here?
- Showtime!

29
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,082
Dear Denmark. Dear Danes.

30
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:21,499
ln just a fow hours, Kurt Maj's
Saturn Expedition wlll be a reallty.

31
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,582
What has insplred this heroic deed?

32
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:31,415
Ever slnce Cape Kurt dlscovered
limltless resources on Saturn, -

33
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,540
- l knew that Denmark would have
to claim exclusive rlghts to these.

34
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:45,499
lt is therefore of vltal importance
to clalm that planet for Denmark!

35
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:50,082
lsn't thls preject of greater beneflt
to you than Denmark as such?

36
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,665
Rubbish!

37
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,874
Kurt Maj Enterprlses has flnanced
the preject as a natlonal gift.

38
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:04,832
- But ...
- lmaglne all those rlches!

39
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:11,499
lt wlll be the end of taxes,
and the beginning of greater welfare.

40
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:20,082
Mr. Maj, we have a problem.
Our navlgator has fallen lll.

41
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,332
lt seems to be food polsonlng.

42
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,374
Caused by this
Kurt Maj TV Dlnner.

43
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:34,582
But he's being treated by the Danish
Medlcal Servlces, so all is well.

44
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:48,374
- How will we find a new navlgator?
- Go over the list once more.

45
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:58,915
Try to squeeze lts tummy.
How many do you want?

46
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:05,332
The crew could have perished
from lack of oxygen or small pox.

47
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,915
Voila! There you go.

48
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,915
- l'll never bathe again.
- No, why start now?

49
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,290
CONTRACT

50
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:26,290
- What the hell ls thls?
- Kurt Maj and Denmark need you!

51
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:30,165
- Say what?
- We need a new navlgator.

52
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,832
- And you're the man for the job.
- Do you want me to go to Saturn?

53
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,457
- Please follow us.
- lt's urgent.

54
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:43,332
Yes, but ... l haven't got the time
just here and now.

55
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:48,165
l have lots of plans.
Laundry and TV ... Time ls runnlng.

56
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,290
l'll have to leave. Goodbye.

57
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:57,582
What's your problem' Jensen?
You are a tralned astronaut, rlght?

58
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,874
When the stars beckon,
l will be thero!

59
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:10,290
- l guess l could serve my country.
- Perfact!

60
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:16,540
- We knew we could count on you.
- No problem. l'll just call a cab.

61
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,040
l'll meet you out front ln ten ...

62
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:25,207
- We have some transportation.
- But l need to go home flrst.

63
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:31,790
- Go for it, Per!
- l need to cut my toe nalls.

64
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,999
l need to have that board sanded
before l leave, or ...

65
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,374
- Wait ...
- Bye, bye.

66
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,082
Welcome aboard, Per.
Let's have a nlce chat now.

67
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,540
Thls ls our command center.

68
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:20,332
The best bralns in the nation
are gathered here.

69
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:29,624
That computer has been programmed
to bring you all the way to Saturn.

70
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:33,040
So you are just a safety measure.

71
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,582
- What are the chances of a mlshap?
- Zero percent!

72
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:47,624
Besides, your commander, Skrydsbøl,
is a distingulshed soldler.

73
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:51,707
You wlll not flnd a more steady man.

74
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:57,207
- You've disgraced the Army.
- You've failed us.

75
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,832
You are a failure, Skrydsbøl.

76
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:03,540
Basra!

77
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,832
THE MlSSlON COMES FlRST

78
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:24,165
Arne? Where are you?

79
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:30,499
- Help me, Arne ... Arne ...
- Gerd! Gerd!

80
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:37,540
Get away from him, you bastards!
l'm comlng, Gerd!

81
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:47,582
- The reading materlals you asked fer.
- Die, you filthy Al Oaeda combatant!

82
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:52,790
Skrydsbøl ls known to run
a tlght shlp on all of hls missions.

83
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,999
Arne Skrydsbøl at your service.
lf l may be so bold as to say ...

84
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:02,165
- You'll make a great team.
- l promlse you, l wlll not fail ...

85
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,915
lt'll just need to be cleared.
Hold on.

86
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,707
Hello? They're ln the third matrix
of the launch coordinates.

87
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:16,957
No, ln the third ...
Well, then look at the blnary code!

88
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,665
Susanne speaklng. Rlght, l've heard.
They're looklng for a new navigator.

89
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,082
You want me to ..?
l'll be there right away. Yes!

90
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:38,540
Susanne, welcome aboard.
As always, a slght for sore eyes.

91
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:42,207
l'm glad you thought of me.

92
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:48,415
l've always wanted to go
on a space mission. l'll do my best.

93
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,665
No! Susanne, my sweet ...
You know we can't send you out there.

94
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,832
- Why you are ...
- l'm what?

95
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:02,624
- l'm your technical dlrector.
- No, ltjust won't work.

96
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,082
You brlghten up the premlses
down here. We've chosen thls guy.

97
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:20,207
- Per?
- Susanne? We used to be lovers.

98
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:27,207
- We went to the Astronaut Academy.
- Then you're the perfact team.

99
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:34,249
Per ls, to put it mildly, not suited
for an expedltlon of this magnitude.

100
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:41,249
Fiddlesticks.
Per ls a true man of the people.

101
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,915
Per ls a fucking fraud!

102
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,665
The closest thing he ever got to space
was when we watched Star Wars!

103
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,707
Why do you insist on hirlng the most
lncompetent ldlots for the expedition?

104
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:59,124
l hope you know
what the flipplng hell you're doing!

105
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:03,249
l guess someone
ls on the rag today.

106
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:16,207
Susanne Mortensen speaking,
technical director of Preject Saturn.

107
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:20,665
l need the exam papers from
Space Academy for a Per Jensen.

108
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,999
Yes, rlght now. Well, then you'll
just have to wake the securlty guard!

109
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,540
TlME FOR LlFT OFF!!

110
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:51,249
Ladies and gentlemen:

111
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:54,540
Our beloved Oueen of Denmark ...
and the Prince Consort.

112
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:59,749
Accompanied
by our dear Prime Minister.

113
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:05,165
Oh la la.
Exquisite taste, Monsieur.

114
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:12,457
l'd llke to stress a point here:
l demand strict disclpllne.

115
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:17,624
As representatlves of Denmark,
we wlll be part of hlstory forever.

116
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:29,207
Please welcome: Arne Skrydsbøl
and two of Denmarks's finest pilots.

117
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:33,707
And finally,
the experienced astronaut, Per Jensen.

118
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,207
Here you are, Madam.

119
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,874
Hello, beautlful!

120
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:13,874
Don'tjust stand there dawdllng, men.
All aboard now! Hup, hup, hup, hup!

121
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,540
Wait! Do l have time to take a crap?
Just a teeny-weeny crap?

122
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,249
A proper hello to you.
l'm Jamil, your cook on thls trlp.

123
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:48,082
Hl, there. My name is Per
and l'm the new navigator.

124
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:53,832
- Don't worry, l'll get you to Saturn.
- Come here.

125
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:59,499
A cheese sandwich wlth jelly and cress
or a Company Sandwich?

126
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,499
lsn't that a Club Sandwlch?

127
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:09,332
- Hey, lt's alright.
- No, lt's important that l learn.

128
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:14,499
l flunked the Danish Citizen Test
but lf l work hard on thls trlp -

129
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,624
- and learn to be a real Dane,
they promised me a second chance.

130
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,499
Then l'll bring my famlly up here and
we'll open a classy restaurant. Look!

131
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,582
HOT DOGS

132
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:30,582
Howdy ho, space homos!

133
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:38,624
Yo ho, you two Prlncesses. Now lt's
hot-ass-mothafuckin' party time!

134
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,249
Ole is in charge of supplies.

135
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:47,082
Here's a bit of hlgh culture
for your Danish Test, Jamll.

136
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:51,249
lt's German, but we do it much
ln the same way here in Denmark.

137
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:56,374
- l'm not sure my wifo would approve.
- Come on, man!

138
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:01,332
Saucy young chicks!
Are those glrls you've been porklng?

139
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:08,790
You son of a dog! l'll butcher you
halal style and foed you to the rats!

140
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,832
- l just want to be your pork partner!
- These are my family photos!

141
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,207
Time out, boys.

142
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:19,832
Gorm the Old, Harald Bluetooth,
Sweyn Forkbeard' Harald ll, -

143
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:24,957
- Canute the Great ...
l'm sorry.

144
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:31,332
l was way too sensitive. A real
Dane can handle insults and taunts.

145
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:35,915
You're absolutely right there,
my little monkey boy.

146
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:41,999
- You fat ... You blg, fat bastard.
- Rlght on!

147
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:49,415
Stand by for lift off.
Man your stations.

148
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,415
Sergeant Skrydsbøl.
Wait a second.

149
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,957
We've got T minus 4 mlnutes and 12
to llft off! lt is a clear violation.

150
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:05,749
- You must read it before lift off.
- ls it cleared according to protocol?

151
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:12,374
- No, but it contalns ...
- lt can be contaminated with anthrax!

152
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:16,832
- But it's about Per. He's ...
- Brief me when we're airborne.

153
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,749
Now, let's have a bitchln'
awesome heck of a party! Here.

154
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:32,665
Beer. The favourite
soft drink of the Danes.

155
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,290
Beer is a pacifier, not a satisfier.

156
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:37,915
Balthazar!

157
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:54,832
No, Balthazar!
Come back here!

158
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,957
10, 9, 8, 7 ...

159
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:02,707
Main booster start.
4, 3, 2, 1 ...

160
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,999
Lift off!

161
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,415
Mon cherie!

162
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:38,832
Man, thls sure ls enough to make
your asshole rock and shake, aln't it?

163
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,999
Mr. Maj, look over here.

164
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:09,624
Owr, but really ...

165
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,790
ACCESS DENlED

166
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:30,249
Kurt Maj, look over here.
Mr. Prime Mlnister, look at the duck.

167
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:34,749
Mr. Maj, l seem to have a problem
with protocol 314.

168
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:39,540
lt's a video, but l can't access it.
And l've never heard of it befere.

169
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,832
Don't trouble your pretty head
with that technical stuff.

170
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:47,290
But l'm Techical Director, Mr. Maj.

171
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:08,082
What's the protocol on knocking
befere approaching your superior?

172
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:13,082
- That ... yo shod knock flsth?
- Exactly.

173
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:16,915
lf thls had been Kabul, your mother
would've had you back in a body bag.

174
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,832
Look me ln the eyes.
l knew lt! You've got it.

175
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:26,874
The look of death. We've
stared death straight ln the eyes.

176
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:31,749
You never forget your first time, huh?
The first kill!

177
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:36,415
Mine was ln Belrut '82. Them were
the days. How many kllls have you had?

178
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:42,999
That ls ... two ... eh,
fifty ... nlnety!

179
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:49,540
lt's an honour to have you aboard.
Let's have a real astronaut chat.

180
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:54,874
Yes, definitely. l just have
to check some ... navlgation stuff.

181
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:58,374
That's right, Per.
The mission comes first!

182
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:05,332
What a beautiful cow.
Please sit down.

183
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:10,207
- Bratwurst?
- So big!

184
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:19,665
l just love that movle, dude! Ole

185
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,249
Then llttle Ole will come out to play.
And for a dollar, l'll let you watch.

186
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,915
Aah, pussy, wonderful pussy.
Let's have some pussy ...

187
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:40,415
See what l've made, dude.
A pee bubble! Made of pee!

188
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:43,749
Ylkes! Get that thlng away from me.

189
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:47,749

190
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:57,207
- Ole's invented a new sport with pee!

191
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:59,665
Be quiet!

192
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,540
Yuck, sham on you!

193
00:23:05,875 --> 00:23:10,749
That's what comes from having such
a ... wog aboard this craft. Yuck!

194
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,499
l expect discipline on thls mission!

195
00:23:13,833 --> 00:23:18,249
ln the Gulf, we dldn't have any
of thls stlnking monkey business!

196
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:23,374
HOT DOGS

197
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:16,124
They're almost there.

198
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:25,082
All hands on deck!
ETA on Saturn ln T minus 15 mlnutes.

199
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,540
Ready for landing?

200
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:57,249
Say, what are you dolng?

201
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:04,665
l'm ready to put on my helmet in case
of ... acute decompression symptoms?

202
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:10,540
Of course! Why didn't l think of that?
Good polnt, Per.

203
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:41,624
Touchdown. Welcome to Saturn.

204
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:47,374
Good! Form formation
"The Capture of Saturn". All hands!

205
00:25:56,791 --> 00:26:01,540
l hereby raise this flag as a symbol
of the Danish colonlzation of Saturn.

206
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:07,207
For King, Country ... No, for God,
Klng, and Country. Yes, l'm ready.

207
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,082
God save our gracious King ...

208
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:18,790
No, dammit!

209
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:25,082
And hero is Denmark,
and hero is Denmark, olé, olé, olé.

210
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:33,749
Thls ls a clear breach of the chain
of command! Turn that thing oft!

211
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,415
From the top!

212
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:45,957
Hey ho, here we go,
d'ya want Ole's cock' you filthy ho?

213
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:53,665
And Ole ... Ole ...

214
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:37,707
Don't worry. lt's under control.
Give me your wristwatches.

215
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:46,915
We, the Whlte Gods, bring you glfts
as a token of our good lntentions.

216
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,707
Obey us, or we'll use our flre sticks!

217
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:54,499
They don't llke you shoutlng at them.

218
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:59,040
Flddlesticks. Primltlve civllizatlons
need to know who's ln charge.

219
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,457
- Hear, hear!
- They don't seem primltlve.

220
00:28:01,791 --> 00:28:05,999
We come from a highly developed
country called Denmark.

221
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:11,499
We want to use your natural resources
for our high technologlcal machlnery.

222
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:17,999
We'll teach you about democracy and
freedom of speech. Great spin-off!

223
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,332
See how he turned hostile
when l talked about freedom of speech.

224
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:25,415
lt's the way yu say it.

225
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:30,499
Draw your weapons! Let's see how they
like good, old-fashloned brute force!

226
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:33,540
- Bad ldea!
- Basra!

227
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:39,332
Dang lt! Ouch!
l don't belleve lt. My trigger finger!

228
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,165
Shit!

229
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:11,457
The closest planet we could find is in
the Solaris cloud, just 12 years ...

230
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:20,290
Get to the point!
What is the size of its water supply?

231
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,707
- Two percent.
- Two percent?

232
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:28,207
But we have sucked all
the other planets in the galaxy dry.

233
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:34,249
You idiot! Two peroent will not even
keep the army going for a week!

234
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:27,165
Bless you ...

235
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:42,790
Beloved Dictator, we have captured
this gang of aliens.

236
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:48,249
We demand to be treated ln accordance
with the Geneva Conventlon ...

237
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,040
- ... our military rights.
- lnsert the translators now!

238
00:30:56,375 --> 00:31:00,415
Let me go, you terrorlst bastard.
This is utterly ...

239
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,540
They don't have an orifice
in their back for the translators.

240
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:10,915
They must have an incredibly
primitive DNA structure.

241
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:16,290
Hey, wait! There's an orifice
further down. Roll in the machinery.

242
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,082
Oh, yes!
A little more to the left, please.

243
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:44,832
Tell me where you come from.

244
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:48,915
Just state your name,
rank and home port.

245
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,665
Arne Skrydsbøl, sergeant in the Navy,
Planet Earth.

246
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,665
- What buslness have you on Saturn?
- Arne Skrydsbøl, sergeant, Earth.

247
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,249
- Are the translators fitted right?
- Fuck, that hurt!

248
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:07,915
- lt should work perfectly.
- Take them away.

249
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:17,957
Bring them back when it's tlme
for dinner. You two, follow me.

250
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,665
Hopelessly otdated.

251
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:51,624
What's he saying?

252
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:59,165
... I've kept an eye on you since
my first test probes reached Saturn.

253
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,915
l know that water is
of vital importance to you' -

254
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:10,165
- yet you have problems procuring it.
Allow me to present, Planet Earth.

255
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,707
Earth, known as the Blue Planet.

256
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:22,207
78% of it is covered in water ...
just waiting to be sucked up.

257
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:29,624
This is an offer you cannot refuse.
Drop by Earth, and we'll discuss this.

258
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:32,665
l look forward to meeting you.

259
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,957
Strlp this sorry craft of everything,
and then prepare my spaceship.

260
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,874
Where the hell are they?

261
00:33:48,166 --> 00:33:52,540
- They went out to stretch thelr legs.
- They should have been back by now.

262
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:55,374
Hey! That mlght be them.

263
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,332
What?

264
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:04,290
Oopsy doopsy ...

265
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,332
There goes all of our communication!

266
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:12,582
l won't stand for that tone of voice.
Accidents may happen, you know.

267
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:18,540
lt'll take days to re-establish
connectlons. That was our only server.

268
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:24,082
Annoying, isn't it?
Well, l'm sure you'll flgure lt out.

269
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:39,957
Come here.
We have a pretty gift for you.

270
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:43,249
Gu ga gu ga gu ga.

271
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:53,707
Well, horrlble testicle torture ls an
unavoldable aspect in our business.

272
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:58,999
Just see is as a work hazard.
That makes lt all easier.

273
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,249
Cheers, Ole.

274
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:09,290
My last one! lt should joln the rest
of the Brewsky family ln my belly.

275
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:14,124
l'm like a beautlful flower.
l need a beer or l'll wlther away.

276
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:17,749
- l'm witherlng away!
- What are you dolng?

277
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:23,290
l thlnk our prison cell is made
of frozen metallic gas.

278
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:29,374
lt has crystallized and appears hard
but vaporlzes if exposed to alcohol.

279
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:34,999
- How dld you know?
- l am a doctor of nuclear physics.

280
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:40,749
Any porch monkey can clalm that.
Let's rock'n'roll, boys!

281
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:45,499
- Hold lt! Prison break!
- Basra!

282
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:52,582
Great teamwork.
Let's go! Hup, hup, hup.

283
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:14,749
- They seem to be getting ready.
- But for what?

284
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:20,915
- Look! Our spaceship.
- And there's the boss dude.

285
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,957
Saturn Force One, departure!

286
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:28,790
Destination: Planet Earth.

287
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,832
- Earth?
- Operation Suck Earth Dry.

288
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:36,624
Proceed to hut 3
and await the Dictator's signal.

289
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:40,790
- Suck Earth Dry?
- Sounds klnky!

290
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:45,457
Aha! The Dictator is on hls way
to Earth to launch an invaslon.

291
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:50,124
- l knew it was a rogue state!
- Look at that glant vacuum cleaner.

292
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:54,249
lf he reaches Earth and transmlts
the signal, lt would mean ...

293
00:36:54,583 --> 00:37:00,249
- The End of the World!
- We'll put an end to that.

294
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:14,499
Move over, boys!
Time fer some boobs and beer.

295
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,374
l found thls l the Earthllngs' craft.

296
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:43,415
Some outmoded audio-visual media
based on electromagnetic currents.

297
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:56,040
Thls seems to be a manual
ln the customs of the Earthllngs.

298
00:37:57,166 --> 00:37:59,749
lnteresting.

299
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:15,415
Ouch, that fucking shlt!

300
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:21,540
And then there's a slight ascend,
whlch you stlck to for ten minutes ...

301
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:26,082
Saturn misslon to Cape Kurt, come in.

302
00:38:26,416 --> 00:38:29,457
Per, let's get this baby ln the air
so we can elimlnate that UFO.

303
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:34,624
l haven't had much practice wlth this
model ... l'm used to the Apollo type.

304
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:39,374
You and l have the look of death.
Remember that.

305
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,915
lt's always nice
to have a clear vlew, rlght?

306
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:03,415
Per, hurry up!

307
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,124

308
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:15,540
Tilt, Per! Tilt!

309
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:25,915
What's the matter with you, kld?
Don't worry. l'll take lt from here.

310
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:30,915
l flew the Hercules planes
when we carpet-bombed Beograd.

311
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,457
Post-traumatlc stress dlsorder after
dangerous mlsslons ls qulte common.

312
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:42,040
Ouch, that old fucking plece of shit!

313
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:48,707
Yes! Come on. Expedltlon,

314
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:52,040
- Hello.
- Per, is that you?

315
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:58,249
This is George from the Short wave
Radio Club. Any kinky girls on line?

316
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:07,124
Hello? Hello ...

317
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:12,165
Ole has totally freaked out.

318
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:17,749
The enemy ls ln sight!

319
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:25,165
The Earthlings' spacecraft!
lt's galning on us.

320
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,207
Let them come.

321
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:36,874
Fire! And not just a warning shot
either. Just throw it right at them.

322
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:48,749
They're gone.

323
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,124
- Contact! Per, elimlnate them.
- What?

324
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:07,999
- Let me have a shot at lt.
- You know dog fights too, Mr. 9/1 1?

325
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:14,374
No, three years in the accommodation
centre. PlayStation, see?

326
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:24,665
- Way to go, Jamil. Bull's eye!
- The UFO seems to be unharmed.

327
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:31,582
They don't stand a chance
against our deflector shield.

328
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:35,999
Give me an estimate of the steering
system of their pathetic vessel.

329
00:41:56,416 --> 00:42:02,582
- A black hole. lt's sucklng us in!
- Arne, turn the wheel!

330
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:08,165
Way to go, Arne!

331
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:19,415
- Red alert!
- Take over. l'll check the air lock.

332
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:26,290
Red alert! Red alert!

333
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,749
CONFlDENTlAL

334
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:44,040
Per, would you please come wlth me?

335
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:50,249
Just actlvate the jet pack, scoot over
to the UFO and attach the explosives.

336
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:55,332
- Have you gone mad, man?
- Don't worry, Per.

337
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:59,999
Thls should be a plece of cake
for a seasoned astronaut llke you.

338
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:03,290
Wait!
l'm not an astronaut.

339
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:07,915
l've never been to space before.
l don't know how to rlde a jet pack!

340
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:12,582
l've known that
from the moment l saw you.

341
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:18,665
Arne Skrydsbøl has a keen eye.
You smell like a con man.

342
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,457
- Arne' l can explain lt all ...
- No, you cannot!

343
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:27,540
- Know ... who sailed Olfert Fischer?
- An ole fart?

344
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:32,832
- Hello?
- Shot them ... call it friendly fire.

345
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:34,540
Can you hear me?

346
00:43:34,875 --> 00:43:39,999
- Arne, thls ls dangerous!
- You've endangered the mlssion.

347
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:43,874
What with your lies
and fake exam papers.

348
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:48,790
- Walt! l lied for a reason.
- lt had better be a good reason.

349
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:55,624
- l lled because l was in love.
- l see. That's the worst excuse ever!

350
00:43:55,958 --> 00:44:01,874
- Have you never been in love, Arne?
- l was close to my pup, Dick Cheney.

351
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:07,290
- But l shot it when lt ate my medals!
- l'm talklng about real love, Arne.

352
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:11,582
Have you never been so madly in love
that it hurts just to see her?

353
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:17,624
That's how l felt about Susanne. She'd
just been accepted lnto the Academy.

354
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:22,582
l thought, "l'm will be an astronaut,
too." Just to be close to her.

355
00:44:22,916 --> 00:44:25,874
But l flunked all the tests.

356
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:30,249
Get to the point, or l shoot you
ln the head like llttle Dick Cheney.

357
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:35,749
So l started cheating to impress her.
Yes, l tampered with my exam papers.

358
00:44:36,083 --> 00:44:40,874
No Dane wlth any klnd of space slash
milltary tralnlng ls fooled by a con.

359
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:46,124
Yes. She was mad about me,
and everythlng was just great.

360
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:49,915
Then she found out l had cheated
and went totally balllstlc.

361
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:55,457
She sald l was a disgrace to the space
program. She never understood.

362
00:44:56,083 --> 00:45:02,124
l didn't give a fuck about the space
program. l just wanted to be with her.

363
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,665
You actlvate the bomb
on the red button.

364
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,665
No!

365
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:16,332
Oh, no!

366
00:45:16,666 --> 00:45:19,624
- Where's Per?
- There.

367
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:25,082
lt's always nlce to have a clear view,
rlght, Per?

368
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:30,624
Activate the jet pack, you idiot!

369
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:37,249
Hell bloody!

370
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:48,874
- Oh. no.
- No more games.

371
00:45:55,416 --> 00:45:58,249
What klnd of abomlnatlon ls this?

372
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:04,457
Some sort of advanced remote control.
They've taken over our control system.

373
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:22,874
What the fuck are you up to?

374
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:32,124
Goodbye.

375
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:40,457
Get us away from here!

376
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:49,040
Typlcal!

377
00:46:51,166 --> 00:46:52,540
Per!

378
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:06,957
- You are a trained astronaut, right?
- We'll be a part of history forever.

379
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:13,249
- You're so cool, Per!
- You smell like a con man.

380
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:19,082
- Per is a genuine man of the people.
- Per is a fucking fraud!

381
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,499
Susanne!

382
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:31,957
Susanne ... no!

383
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,124
Per! Oh, no, lt's all my fault.

384
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:50,499
Bloody hell! The autopilot ls down
with a fatal error.

385
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:55,165
This is a crisis situation.
We'll never make it back to Earth.

386
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,415
- What happened to Per?
- He was sucked lnto the black hole.

387
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,582
- We have to go in after him.
- A suiclde mission? You'd llke that!

388
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:09,790
- We have to try.
- Arne, where are you?

389
00:48:10,125 --> 00:48:13,665
Arne, for fuck's sake!

390
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,915
The mission always comes flrst!
Per failed us. l can do nothing!

391
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:30,290
- What the hell is wrong now?
- We've run out of gas.

392
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:39,332
Well, you'll have lt your way then.

393
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:54,457
Beloved Mr. Dictator,
we're enterlng the Earth's atmosphere.

394
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:58,832
He was rlght. They've got enough water
to keep the fleet running in 20 years.

395
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:02,332
Send the co-ordlnates
to the invaslon force.

396
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:16,499
l don't know what so say, but l think
somethlng has gone terribly wrong.

397
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:23,332
- What's golng on?
- Someone ls enterlng the atmosphere.

398
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:25,582
Oh, no!

399
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:32,207
Slx. One, two, three' four ... Oh, no.

400
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:36,499
Oops, Mr. Prime Minister,
this is going to be expensive.

401
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:40,790
We'll just cut back on the care of
our senlor citizens again this year.

402
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:46,082
- Mr. Maj.
- Susanne. What an entrance.

403
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:50,415
Our spaceshlp is lost, and an
unldentified vessel is approaching.

404
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:55,124
- l thlnk it's hostlle.
- The Danlsh People's Party protest.

405
00:49:56,375 --> 00:50:01,707
There comes a time when you as
a citizen of thls peaceful nation -

406
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:05,999
- will be forced to perform
the noble defonce mechanism, -

407
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:10,165
- which we through proud generatlons
have resorted to agaln and again -

408
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,749
- and proven that we master
to perfection.

409
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:18,707
- Total supjection.
- What?

410
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:21,290
We're talking about cool cash here.

411
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:27,207
lmaglne the export rights and
exchange of sustainable technology.

412
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:34,374
Your re-electlon is ensured slnce you
can lower taxes and safoguard welfare.

413
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:37,624
You can't jus do that!

414
00:50:37,958 --> 00:50:42,707
Leave thls to the men now,
right, you sweet llttle thing?

415
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:59,207
- l thlnk we've passed through it.
- Never underestlmate Danish deslgn.

416
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:18,999
- The atmosphere is compatible.
- We're really out ln the stlcks, huh?

417
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:25,582
We have to survey the area and
find fuel, lf Denmark ls to be saved.

418
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:30,207
Look! A llght.

419
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:39,374
DENMARK HAS VlSlTORS
FROM SPACE

420
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:09,040
Cheers!

421
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:53,999
l'm so horny.

422
00:52:54,333 --> 00:53:01,332
We want to cum in the ass
of all your girls.

423
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:08,790
Give me your big cock.
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

424
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:23,915
Dear Danes!
Let's welcome our new allles.

425
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:29,082
These fasclnatlng belngs have come to
negotlate the future export of goods.

426
00:53:29,416 --> 00:53:36,249
Of all natlons on Earth they chose us.
Because Danlsh goods are the best!

427
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:41,999
lf we enter into this agreement, -

428
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:47,082
- then early retlrement ls guaranteed
for all further generatlons.

429
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:51,832
That's not true!

430
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:57,790
The aliens are hostile.
They've murdered our astronauts!

431
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:02,415
Well, as soon as someone makes
a splendid inltlative -

432
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:05,332
- that will create prosperlty, -

433
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:10,707
- the leftwlnged, paranoid eco-freaks
crawl out of their filthy wood works.

434
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:14,790
Some people wlll always be naysayers,
when it comes to progress, -

435
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:21,415
- but real Danes will agree that those
who try to slow progress are traltors!

436
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:25,749
- You fucking communlst!
- Filthy bitch!

437
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:29,999
But where ls
the Saturn Expedltlon then?

438
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:33,165
Traltor!

439
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:40,582
- Welcome to Earth.
- Prepare a translator.

440
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:58,249
Attention! Thls looks llke
a cultural leftist art installation.

441
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:01,040
Hey, there's  doorbell.

444
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:30,707
No tlme to chat, Santa Claus. We're

445
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:38,040
Gas? l don't know anythlng about that.
But ... come on in and ask.

447
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:50,457
Just make your inqulry
at the counter over yonder.

448
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,165
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, -

449
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,707
- so take off your boots
so as not to drag your dust in here.

450
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:14,707
We need gas.
l demand to talk to your superlor.

451
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:26,499

Yo, what's up, guys?

l'm wllling to help you suck up
all the water from Earth.

454
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:41,415
The oceans, the ground water,

455
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:49,290
- And what do you expect ln return?
- l want the island of Greenland.

456
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:56,832
The Kurt Maj Drink is top notch.
lt's made from puro Greenland ice.

457
00:56:57,166 --> 00:57:02,165
The Kurt Maj drink'
the only water.

458
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,749
399 $ a bottle.

459
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:09,749
When you've sucked up all the water,
it'll be more valuable than gold.

460
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:15,832
People have to drink Kurt Maj Drink.
l already extracted large quantltles -

461
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:21,832
- and stored lt at different spots all
over the world. Have a Kurt Maj drlnk!

462
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:29,874
You can't do that!

463
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,374
Kill her.

475
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,457
- How can you compete with that?
- Let me go, you dlsgustlng cockatoo!

476
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:17,040
- Look!
- Let go of me, for fuck's sake!

477
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:21,332
- l haven't got the time to be dead.
- Hey, Per.

478
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:26,249
- l never thought l'd see you agaln.
- Where have you been, Per?

479
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:30,832
- Little Per, my frlend.
- lt's worse than the lRS up here.

480
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:35,540
l told them l had to return, but
they asked for a load of papers ...

481
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:39,999
- Oh, no. You're not dead' are you?
- No.

482
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:45,082
- What about the UFO?
- Well, it got away, didn't lt?

483
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:48,874
Let's just flnd some gas
and blow this hippie commune.

484
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:53,874
We don't have stuff like that up here.
The whole place ls wind-powered.

485
00:59:54,208 --> 00:59:59,915
- God Almighty!
- You must help us save Earth.

486
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:04,832
Earth?
But that's our entlre clientele.

487
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:09,999
Say, the Holy Ghost mlght
be able to help you.

488
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:19,582
What do we need that for?
Ouch, you filthy llttle creep!

489
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:25,624
- They're flylng vermin.
- Easy now. Trust me.

490
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,999
ANGEL PUSSY

491
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:34,749
Unfortunately,
these guys have to return.

492
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:40,874
- Good luck with lt all, then.
- Llkewlse.

493
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:45,290
- Where do you thlnk you're going?
- What do you mean?

494
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:51,707
Our pollcy ls strlct: Once you've dled
and gone to Heaven, that's lt!

495
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:55,915
- l'm not even a member of the Church.
- What the hell?

496
01:00:57,375 --> 01:01:01,874
Fuck off, you fucklng paraslte!

497
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:13,540
- Where's it going? Come back.
- Fllthy shlt bird.

498
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:36,540
lt's a gas station! Right on!

499
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,665
- Look. They sell Danlsh beer.
- Beer?

500
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,124
Brewsky!

501
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,749
Yes!

502
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:17,082
- Well, Arne. lt's fllled up.
- And so what?

503
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:21,582
We have no autopllot,
and our navigator ls an lmpostor!

504
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,749
Rlght on!

505
01:02:38,583 --> 01:02:43,707
- Thls beer's heavy.
- Per's never here fer manual labour!

506
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:49,790
Avlation deck, check.
Flaps, check. Englne burst, check.

507
01:02:50,125 --> 01:02:53,624
We're ready r lift oft.

508
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:59,165
l found the manual. Just push start,
and we're headed rlght for Earth.

509
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:06,749
Well, let's go then, Per.

510
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:40,374
Alright, when the stars beckon,
here we fucklng come.

511
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:50,124
We're flylng at 20 times normal speed.

512
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:55,707
Do we need these translators anymore?
l'm so sore ln my butt.

513
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:58,374
lt mlght contaln info about the enemy.

514
01:03:58,708 --> 01:04:02,415
Keep it up there, and you'll pass
the Dane test the next tlme.

515
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:16,790
Well, boys. e're almost home.

516
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:47,415
Hello. Per, is that you?

517
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,582
l thought you were dead.
How did you find your way back?

518
01:04:51,916 --> 01:04:57,290
Per handled that. He turned out
to be an outstanding navigator.

519
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:11,165
- Susanne, has the UFO arrived?
- Yes, but l've ...

520
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:16,040
- The invasion fleet is on its way.
- The invasion fleet?

521
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:19,499
Dld the dictator
brlng a remote control?

522
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:25,040
Of course! The dictator uses
the remote control -

523
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:29,415
- to log unto the operatlve system
of other spacecrafts and control them.

524
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:33,665
lf you could get hold of lt, we may
be able to stop the entire UFO fleet.

525
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,499
- Okay. I'll do my best.
- we'll come as fast as we can.

526
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:45,957
So this is where you're hldlng,
rlght ln an intergalactic date.

527
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:49,415
- How sweet.
- Leave her alone!

528
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:55,957
When the stars beckon,
then big, bad Per is on his way!

529
01:05:56,291 --> 01:06:01,290
why do you think I picked a bunch
of losers and a burned-out soldier?

530
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:06,832
You're good for nothing' and that made
you perfoct for my little mission.

531
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:10,957
Wish l had time to chat,
but I've got a planet to suck dry.

532
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:14,582
Say goodbye to Susanne now.

533
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,249
- l thought you'd done away with them.
- They don't know what they're in fer.

534
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:28,874
Put the pedal to the metal. Let's go!

535
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:40,915
- Where did that come from?
- We're dead meat, boys.

536
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:49,207
We'll hlt the moon. Shlt! This is
going to be one tough crash landing!

537
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:08,415
Oh, no. The invaslon fleet.

538
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:23,457
Why did l joln thls shitty mission?
l'll never see my dear famlly again.

539
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:27,790
l've lost everything
for fucking Denemarci!

540
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:32,457
Sandwiches, beer and crappy soccer!
You can't even beat the Swedes!

541
01:07:32,791 --> 01:07:37,040
And silly proverbs! Who the hell
llves in a house of glass?

542
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:43,249
And who wants one bird in the hand?
lt's a shitty nation!

543
01:07:51,666 --> 01:07:54,415
l have to speak to my God.

544
01:07:56,666 --> 01:08:02,207
- Where the heck ls Mecca?
- Just face Earth. That should do it.

545
01:08:20,416 --> 01:08:25,374
Thls ls the perfoct place to erect
your water exploltation machlne.

546
01:08:25,708 --> 01:08:28,874
You can't just take the water
on Earth. lt belongs to all of us.

547
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:35,832
- You get the Kurt Maj Drlnk instead.
- But ordlnary people can't afford it.

548
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:38,832
Then they'd better start saving up.

549
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:43,165
A strong signal on our radars seems
to indicate more incoming UFOs.

550
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:46,582
lt's almost an army.

551
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:55,249
- So many to bulld that machine?
- My soldlers won't building anythlng.

552
01:08:58,208 --> 01:09:00,915
We'll have slaves do the work!

553
01:09:13,291 --> 01:09:17,124
Never polnt a thlng like that at
other people. lt's fucklng dangerous.

554
01:09:34,666 --> 01:09:37,999
Hold it right there!
We're on our way to Earth -

555
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:42,665
- to stop an alien invasion, and we
don't have time for your feollshness.

556
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:20,207
Work ls progressing at a steady pace.
We expect to be ready in 24 hours.

557
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:24,832
- You have 12.
- Danes can't work any faster.

558
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:30,624
Their work ethic has deterlorated from
decades of belng publlc employees.

559
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:37,332
Wrong answer. You're in charge now.
You've got 12 hours, understood?

560
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:40,540
Start the countdown!

561
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:52,207
Hey, kabob.

562
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:10,499
Hey, let the grown-ups have a look.

563
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:17,582
Hornbæk Beach. High soclety tlts!

564
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:28,874
What's that?

565
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:32,915
lt's the countdown
for the end of the world.

566
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:40,332
- Susanne!
- Someone ran off with your girl.

567
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:45,540
- Treachery on the home-front.
- She's been taken hostage!

568
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:49,874
At least the problem is solved. We'll
nuke the platform and be heroes.

569
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:55,457
- We can't! Susanne is down there.
- Let me tell you something, Per!

570
01:11:55,791 --> 01:12:00,415
l've only had one true friend,
Gerd, my second in command.

571
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:05,499
During a mlssion in Basra,
he was caught ln enemy crossflre.

572
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:10,165
l could elther complete the mission
or save Gerd. l chose Gerd.

573
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,874
lf Gerd dled, l wouldn't have anyone
left in my llfe. Nobody!

574
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:20,207
lt didn't work.
The mission went totally awry.

575
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:23,374
Arne!

576
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:30,415
Gerd was killed. 60 bullets. l was
demoted from colonel to sergeant.

577
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:35,415
l'd forgotten the most important rule
ln the army: The mission comes first.

578
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:39,290
But this is my chance
to make lt right!

579
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:43,874
That's not right, Arne. You went
through the black hole to save me.

580
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,832
lt wasn't qulte like that.

581
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:52,165
l get your point about not nuklng
anybody, but how can we stop them?

582
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:58,915
Kurt Maj had a point.
We are just a bunch of losers.

583
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:09,499
We didn't get thls far just to end up
nuklng hundreds of innocent people.

584
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:12,915
Did we at any tlme
have the odds in our favour?

585
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:16,874
Would a bunch of losers have survived
everythlng we've been through?

586
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:20,665
We aren't losers. We're astronauts.

587
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,249
We represent Denmark
ln the entlre unlverse -

588
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:30,207
- and Denmark doesn't nuke lnnocent
people just to serve a greater cause.

589
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:36,499
- l suggest we put it to the vote.
- Danlsh democracy ls the thlng!

590
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:40,665
All ln favour of saving Denmark
ln a humane way.

591
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,915
- Hear, hear!
- Utter feollshness!

592
01:13:55,583 --> 01:14:02,165
- Per, do we have a plan?
- No. But l know someone who might.

593
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,332
NEW SATURN RACE - TERRORlSTS?
ALlENS DO ExlST

594
01:14:09,666 --> 01:14:15,540
Mom! l was supposed to go
with the others to see the allens.

595
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:28,249
l thlnk you have some vlsitors, lb.

596
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:31,832
Coffee's served.

597
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:36,374
- Why dld we let ourselves be fooled?
- What are we golng to do?

598
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:41,290
Let me see. All allens are prone to be
ellminated by some Earth stuff.

599
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:45,999
They may get the flu and dle. Or
mosqulto spray, shampoo, or cooties.

600
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:50,040
DUFO has taped everything
on the allens slnce they arrlved.

601
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:54,707
we've only got
an hour and a half left.

602
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:58,665
Wait! Rewind a blt.

603
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,040
There. Pause!

604
01:15:01,375 --> 01:15:06,499
- Slow forward.
- How about a beer?

605
01:15:06,833 --> 01:15:09,707
- Why, it's beer!
- Of course!

606
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:15,207
Yo, have a beer!

607
01:16:16,166 --> 01:16:19,624
They're back!

608
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:23,582
- Per!
- lf we have her, they won't touch us.

609
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:27,499
Keep them out of the control room.
Lead them up to the top deck.

610
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:32,374
- But how?
- Just do it. Now!

611
01:16:42,541 --> 01:16:46,915
The suction machlne!
We have to stop it. Come on, Arne!

612
01:16:49,541 --> 01:16:53,207
Where ls the control room?
Over here, boys.

613
01:16:55,125 --> 01:17:00,624
You! Get all these people
as far away as posslble.

614
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:08,915
- Stop your grlplng, Susanne.
- Susanne!

615
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:14,040
Let's spllt up. Arne and Ole,
stop the engine. Jamll, come with me.

616
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:29,457
You stay here and fix that door.

617
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:35,124
Come and get me'
you overslzed lizard!

618
01:17:44,666 --> 01:17:46,082
Susanne!

619
01:18:00,166 --> 01:18:01,874
Take that!

620
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:14,874
- Only ten mlnutes left!
- Yo!

621
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:34,290
Per! l'm comlng!

622
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:45,040
Jamil ...

623
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:51,374
Jamil' no!

624
01:18:52,833 --> 01:18:58,499
- Jamll ...
- l can't feel my legs. Cold ...

625
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:03,540
Don't die! You have to become a
real Dane. We'll vislt the landmarks.

626
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:07,499
l'll lntroduce you to lda Davldsen and
let you taste her open sandwiches.

627
01:19:07,833 --> 01:19:14,749
Per, you need to be a father
to my klds. Jamil Junior and Jamilla.

628
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:20,790
Promise me to talk to my wifo, Nadja,
cousin All, uncle Nadim and Dina.

629
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:25,290
And my cousln and her children,
Hakim and Yassir and thelr wives -

630
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:28,415

01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:47,499

We have to stop that suction machine.

639
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:40,707

- You have to mount a translator.

650
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:45,374
Not now!
There's a nuclear mlsslle on its way.

651
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:00,624
Basra!

652
01:23:07,166 --> 01:23:08,915

653
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:13,999

654
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:18,832

friends come before the mlssion.

655
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:24,082
Alright, three friends then.

656
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:30,457

659
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:08,749
We can't get away. He's too heavy.

660
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:12,999
Jamil' the gun!

661
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,082

Fools! l have thousands of UFOs
left ln the unlverse.

666
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:51,832
Dld you really thlnk it would be
that easy to beat me?

667
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:56,790
Shit!

668
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:32,207
Would a desert princess like you like
to see the palm rlse at Ole's oasis?

669
01:25:32,541 --> 01:25:38,457
- Bloody hell, Ole!
- Remember: Respect for traditions.

670
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:41,999
That doesn't count
when we're talking about my cousin.

671
01:25:42,333 --> 01:25:45,790
Do you really understand Danish
if you use one of these?

672
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:55,124
- Where wlll we spend our honeymoon?
- We could begin with the Milky Way.

673
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:58,540
And after that
we'll just follow the stars.

674
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:12,040
SUSANNE HAS GOT

675
01:26:59,416 --> 01:27:02,749

01:27:03,083 --> 01:27:07,832
- so l declded to isolate them at
my oil field and extermlnate them.

677
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:12,832
lt was a tough battle, but my plan
worked. l had them exterminated.

678
01:27:13,166 --> 01:27:18,624
And now: Kurt Maj Enterprlses has
always been very keen -

679
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:22,415
- on gettlng cheap, alternatlve
energy resources for the Danes.

680
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:29,040
