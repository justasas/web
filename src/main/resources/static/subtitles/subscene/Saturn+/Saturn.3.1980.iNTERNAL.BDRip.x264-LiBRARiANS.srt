- Mm-hm.

00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:25,417
He's breathed.
I mean, we lead a shut life here.

129
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,501
It must be really something
to go outside and breath.

130

What do they do?

145
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:05,501
Well, when they send
someone out alone,

146
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:08,584
they give them some of these
to keep them from going static.

00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:06,876
- Haven't you ever had a dog?
<i>- A</i> few times.

184
00:19:06,876 --> 00:19:09,792
<i>Well, didn't they have names?
[Sally whimpers]</i>

185
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,001
Just something to eat.

186
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,584
- Give her to me!
- What?

187
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,167
Don't.

188
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,876
It's time we get to bed,
Captain.

189
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:21,334
Yes, you have a great body.

190
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,667
May I use it?

191
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,334
I'm with the major.

192
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:29,001
For his personal
consumption only?

193
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,001
Yes.

194
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:34,584
That's penally unsocial on Earth,
you know that?

195
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,751
Well, it's not here.

196
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:39,292
Enjoy your blues.

197
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,167
Hey.

198
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:52,084
Problems?

199
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,667
Come on.

200
00:20:00,834 --> 00:20:03,542
Come into my quarters,
we'll discuss your problem.

201
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,084

[Click]

204
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:58,667
Looks like he's gonna build
his own place.

205
00:20:58,667 --> 00:20:59,751
Hm.

206
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,334
He's not travelling light.
Maybe I should help him.

207
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:13,876
Why?
He's here to help us.

208
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:18,001
<i>[Alex]
He's so strange.</i>

209
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:32,459
That's a lot of stuff.
How long are you staying?

210
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,792
Till I'm done.

211
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,251
Now, exactly what have
you got for us?

212
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:39,376
It's the best.
The latest robot.

213
00:21:39,376 --> 00:21:41,334
We've got three robots.

214
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,792
They're not very much help.

215
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,251
This one's different.

216
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:46,792
Different, huh?

217
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:52,292
It's the first
of the Demigod Series.

218
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:59,334
Alex.
Where'd you get that name?

219
00:22:59,334 --> 00:23:01,209
That's what the major calls me.

220
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:05,084
<i>[Captain] I know why
you're denying me hospitality.</i>

221
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,626
<i>[Alex] We offered you
the run of the place.</i>

222
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:09,709
<i>I'm talking about you.
Your body is very beautiful.</i>

223
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:11,376
<i>I'd like to use it.</i>

224
00:23:11,376 --> 00:23:13,126
<i>I'm not interested.</i>

225
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:16,209
<i>On Earth we use each others bodies
to give ourselves pleasure.</i>

226
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:17,459
<i>No thanks.</i>

227
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,292
You're afraid of me,
aren't you?

228
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:22,792
I'm not afraid of anyone.

229
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,584
You're afraid he'll be jealous.

230
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:26,376
<i>He will be jealous.</i>

231
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:29,417
<i>He's frightened of the new ways.
He is obsolete.</i>

232
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:30,584

<i>[Captain]
This is an unborn.</i>

00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:16,501
Hasn't a thing on its mind.
Yet.

240
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:18,417
Then it has to be programmed.

241
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,209
It takes a human being 20 years
just to develop--

242
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,084
I need three to four weeks.

243
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:23,209
Three to four weeks?

244
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:25,792
Once I can get its head together,
it will take over your program.

245
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,542
- Take over?
- With a little help.

246
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,001
Then what?

247
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,084
Then one of you
will be obsolete.

248
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:43,709
[sighs] We can apply
for re-mission together, can't we?

249
00:24:44,876 --> 00:24:47,001
We have to find a way
to stay together.

250
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:52,126
The truth is
I'm close to abort time.

251
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,376
I hoped they'd have
forgotten us.

252
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:59,417
[Alex]
They never seem to forget.

253
00:25:06,584 --> 00:25:08,417
Obsolete.

254
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:16,334
Alex, I've got it.

255
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:19,417
We flush the captain
and his friend into space.

256
00:25:20,459 --> 00:25:22,209
- You wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

257
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:24,917
People are being flushed
all over the solar system.

258
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,709
No one cares.

259
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,292
That's a horrible idea.

260
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:31,459
It's a great idea.

261
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:35,292
Come here, baby.
Yes.

262
00:26:21,042 --> 00:26:23,626
- Blue dreamers?
- Mm-hm.

263
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:26,209
Now?

264
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:28,584
Why not?

265
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:36,876
<i>Ahh!</i>

266
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:42,167
I don't feel anything.

267
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:49,001
You always want
instantaneous satisfaction.

268
00:26:50,334 --> 00:26:52,126
Do you miss it?

269
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:53,876
Maybe it's different now.

270
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:56,001
Yeah, maybe it's worse.

271
00:26:57,667 --> 00:27:00,001
That pill is getting to you.

272
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:01,167
No.

273
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:10,209
I think you ought
to go to Earth.

274
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:12,042
What?

275
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:16,501
You said I'd hate it.

276
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:20,209
Well, find out for yourself
if you hate it.

277
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:21,417
I don't want to go.

278
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:25,167
Yes, you do.

279
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:26,834
Oh.

280
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:29,751
I just want to have been.

281
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:32,084
So, have been.

282
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,209
And leave you?

283
00:27:34,792 --> 00:27:37,084
It's gonna happen
sooner or later.

I wanted you to meet Hector.

Adam.

291
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,876
Give it a simple instruction.
Ask it something.

292
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,459
- Hector?
- Yes.

293
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:37,501
Hector, hand the flask
to the major.

294
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,459
Abort.

I'm glad you didn't ask him
to shake hands.

Wheel and peditate.

297
00:29:58,084 --> 00:30:00,751

fine tuning to do.

- Good evening.

302
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:29,376
Can he play?

303
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:32,292
Yes.
I play, he plays.

304
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:35,417
I'd like to see that.

00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:42,376
All right.

00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:53,501
Can't you program him
to have a sense of humor?

311
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:55,001
That's not an early priority.

312
00:31:55,001 --> 00:31:58,251
Oh, come on, you can't program
a sense of humor.

313
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:00,501
Anything I have, sir,
he can have.

314
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,459
Well then, he'll definitely have
a sense of humor.

Direct input.

00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:30,417
He sits him down
in front of a blackboard.

320
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:32,209
I said direct input.

00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,417

No. no, go on.

Hydroponics.

Who devised this system?

369
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:29,834
There are sources
for food present

370

Why won't you talk?

Why not?

Not that, blank that.
That's not what I meant.

Answer.

absolutely can you talk

438

around the walls of Troy.

You want the girl?

546
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:12,542
Hm, sure, sure,
you want the girl.

547
00:52:13,501 --> 00:52:16,001
You think she's beautiful too,
don't you?

548
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:19,417
You know the captain's crazy?

549
00:52:20,334 --> 00:52:22,459
He really is crazy.

550
00:52:22,459 --> 00:52:24,501
The robot scared me more.

551
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:29,501
If the robot can kill,
the captain can kill.

552
00:52:31,876 --> 00:52:33,626
I thought I could kill.

553
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:38,209
I'm just not update enough
for murder.

554
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:43,417
I wish I was.

555
00:52:43,417 --> 00:52:45,501
Are you sure
he's taking it apart?

556
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:49,626
Either he takes it apart

It's my fault, Alex.
I should never have let him stay.

564

In a week or two we will have
forgotten it ever happened.

- Of course we will.

You are crazy.

Come along, Alex.

Captain, for the last time.

576

Doesn't it disgust you
to be used by him?

577
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:35,876
<i>To be touched by an old man?</i>

578
00:57:35,876 --> 00:57:38,417
- Can't you feel the decay?
- Get out of here!

01:18:03,626 --> 01:18:05,959
- Go on in there.
- Without you?

721
01:18:08,209 --> 01:18:09,751
I need a minute.

722
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:12,126
What's going to happen to us?

723
01:18:12,126 --> 01:18:13,667
Don't worry.

724
01:18:15,334 --> 01:18:17,042
<i>Hurry along!</i>

725
01:18:26,626 --> 01:18:27,751
[gasps]

726
01:18:30,834 --> 01:18:32,126
Go on.

727
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:11,584
<i>[whirring]</i>

728
01:19:20,542 --> 01:19:25,001
[Major's voice] Ah, there you are,
and how beautiful.

729
01:19:25,001 --> 01:19:26,501
Come in, Alex.

730
01:19:26,501 --> 01:19:29,209
- Come in.
- Stop it, Hector.

731
01:19:29,751 --> 01:19:32,626
Hector, I never liked
that name.

732
01:19:32,626 --> 01:19:35,542
<i>Did you know that Hector
was slain by Achilles?</i>

733
01:19:35,542 --> 01:19:38,167
<i>His body dragged
around the walls of Troy.</i>

734
01:19:38,167 --> 01:19:41,251
<i>No, I never liked Hector.</i>

735
01:19:41,251 --> 01:19:45,042
<i>We can do better.
How about Adam?</i>

736
01:19:46,084 --> 01:19:48,876
Stop using his voice.

737
01:19:48,876 --> 01:19:50,209
[Captain's voice]
Forgive me.

738
01:19:50,209 --> 01:19:51,667
Is this more to your liking?

739
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:54,001
[Alex's voice]
Or this perhaps.

740
01:19:54,001 --> 01:19:55,417
Stop it.

741
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:56,917
Stop using us.

742
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:59,251
[Captain's voice]
Well, you see my difficulty.

743
01:19:59,251 --> 01:20:02,001
<i>- [Alex's voice] I'm you.
- [Adam's voice] I'm Adam.</i>

744
01:20:02,001 --> 01:20:04,376
[all voices] I'm the other one.
I'm everyone.

745
01:20:04,876 --> 01:20:06,459
<i>Conversation's an art.</i>

746
01:20:06,459 --> 01:20:08,251
I do it to perfection.

747
01:20:10,334 --> 01:20:12,084
[Captain's voice]
There you are.

748
01:20:12,084 --> 01:20:14,126
<i>Don't be late again, Adam.</i>

749
01:20:15,251 --> 01:20:19,001
Major.
You will call me Major.

750
01:20:21,459 --> 01:20:23,376
I'm in command here.

751
01:20:24,376 --> 01:20:26,126
You will do as I say.

752
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:28,376
Both of you.

753
01:20:28,376 --> 01:20:29,584
Stay where you are!

754
01:20:35,917 --> 01:20:40,209
It's time we programmed your brain
to be a bit more productive.

755
01:20:42,709 --> 01:20:44,459
Captain?

756
01:20:44,459 --> 01:20:46,917
Yes, that's who you really are.

757
01:20:46,917 --> 01:20:49,792
I'm not the captain.
I'm your superior.

758
01:20:51,709 --> 01:20:53,542
Adam, please.

759
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:55,834
I told you to keep away!

760
01:20:56,834 --> 01:20:58,209
[Hector]
Don't do that!

761
01:21:00,584 --> 01:21:02,501
You must learn to obey.

762
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:06,667
It's not your fault, Hector.

763
01:21:06,667 --> 01:21:07,792
Turn around.

764
01:21:14,251 --> 01:21:15,542
It's not James' fault.

765
01:21:15,542 --> 01:21:16,834
<i>Turn around!</i>

766
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:25,084
It's everybody's fault.

767
01:21:26,084 --> 01:21:28,459
Yeahh!

768
01:21:28,459 --> 01:21:30,417
[Hector]
No, no.

769
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:34,709
Desist.
I <i>am</i> your superior...

770
01:23:06,292 --> 01:23:09,417
<i>[male] Hello there,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

771
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:12,876
<i>I trust you're enjoying
the ongoing flight situation</i>

772
01:23:12,876 --> 01:23:15,417
<i>and we hope you're gonna fly
World Spaceways</i>

773
01:23:15,417 --> 01:23:17,584
<i>again, and again, and again.</i>

774
01:23:17,584 --> 01:23:21,209
<i>Duty-free goods service
will be closing shortly.</i>

775
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:24,584
<i>Right now, though,
I'd suggest you walk to the ports</i>

776
01:23:24,584 --> 01:23:28,001
<i>and get a good position
for a swell view of Mother Earth</i>

777
01:23:28,001 --> 01:23:30,292
<i>coming right up.</i>
