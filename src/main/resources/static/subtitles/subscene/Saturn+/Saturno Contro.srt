A Ferzan Özpetek Film

00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,357
SATURN OPPOSITE

3
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,559
I wonder if inviting Paolo tonight
was the right thing to do.

4
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,834
Can't change things now,
besides I bet he's already here.

5
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:26,839
Taste this.

6
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,956
How is it?

7
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,239
It's perfect,
good thing I'm the cook.

8
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,157
He's probably been outside
waiting for a long time.

9
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,795
Not because he's shy,
he's just terrified.

10
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,796
- Who is it?
- The Gestapo.

11
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,911
Just a minute!

12
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,679
- Do you want to mug me?
- No, why?

13
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,119
Well, you never know.

14
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,974
I think we're at
the same party.

15
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:11,794
It's not a party.
Anyway, I'm Neval.

16
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:13,725
I know.

17
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,239
- Lorenzo mentioned me to you?
- All of you.

18
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,799
So you had
nothing better to talk about!

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,074
- What pastry is it?
- A fruit cake.

20
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:26,519
Too bad! I love chocolate cake.

21
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,759
- Sorry.
- How long have you known Lorenzo?

22
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,079
A couple of months.

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,439
- Do you sleep with him?
- No, why?

24
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,119
I like to know these things
from the start.

25
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,919
-I see you've met.
-Hi.

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,199
-Welcome.
-Hi, you mummy!

27
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,468
That's Sergio,
let's not bother him now.

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,279
Here you are.

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,519
-Thanks, but you didn't have to.
-Lorenzo...

30
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,799
Give that to him later.

31
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,199
-This is Paolo, Angelica, Davide.
-Hi.

32
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,879
-Hello.
-He brought dessert.

33
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,871
Thank you.

34
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,679
I can't understand
why didn't Antonio come.

35
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,034
-He is too busy nowadays isn't he?
-Yes. I'm not happy at all about this...

36
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:26,155
But this is it... Unfortunately.

37
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,879
Sorry!
I'll put it out.

38
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,479
-That's not an ashtray.
-Isn't it?

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,879
-No.
-End of the hall, on the right.

40
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,075
Going now.

41
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,854
-Antonio?
-A client at his bank...

42
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:48,034
...invited him
to a fish restaurant.

43
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:50,119
What a drag!

44
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,119
I'd already warned Paolo...

45
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,154
there were no more ashtrays in
the house since we all quit smoking.

46
00:03:54,155 --> 00:03:56,439
We needed symbolic gestures...

47
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,119
...to strengthen our conviction.

48
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,165
Occupied!

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,634
I just want to put out my cigarette.

50
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:05,839
-Paolo?
-Yes?

51
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,874
You SOB, are you alone?

52
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,245
Yes, I'm.

53
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,292
How did you convince Lorenzo?

54
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,639
He's the one who insisted.

55
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,279
- Give me a drag.
-Didn't you quit?

56
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,194
Yeah, I just want to make sure.
Here. Has Lorenzo read it?

57
00:04:23,195 --> 00:04:25,359
He will, for sure.

58
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,079
He swore just Davide will read it.

59
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,919
And you believe him, Lorenzo loves to
snoop. I'll be the last to read it.

60
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,199
-Roberta!
-I can't quit everything at a time.

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,999
I've even got Saturn in opposition!

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,559
Where are your planets?
Let me see.

63
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,193
You're Taurus with Libra rising
and Uranus squared to mid-heaven, eh?

64
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,119
Take a hit, you'll need it!

65
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,114
You weren't born smokers, there was
a time when you didn't smoke.

66
00:04:56,115 --> 00:04:59,074
It is not impossible to quit.
You just need to believe yourself.

67
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:02,828
Angelica is a psychologist
in a cancer research center.

68
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:08,079
She holds anti-smoking courses
and forced us to join.

69
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,159
The method didn't work for
everybody, but Roberta was hopeless.

70
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,759
You quit a bad habit by starting another
one, it's the law of compensation.

71
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,839
Did you know it?

72
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,159
I said not to talk to one another.

73
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,759
Concentrate on the smoke,
on how it tastes...

74
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,119
...how it feels when it slides down
your throat and into your chest...

75
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,115
Now take a deep puff, all together.

76
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,079
- How does it feel? Nasty?
- Definetly.

77
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,599
Sergio's just as bad,rather than quit
something, he'd rather add something.

78
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,999
- So, you're a young writer.
- No, it's just a hobby.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,239
I just got my degree in Medicine
and I'm starting my specialization.

80
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,989
Writing is an outlet,
I don't like to brag about it.

81
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,639
What are you writing?

82
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,599
Novels, stories,
poetry, opera librettos?

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,919
Short stories.
Sort of fairy-tales.

84
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,359
Like our famous writer here,
that's why Davide invited you.

85
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,914
I'm his fan, so since
he and Lorenzo were close friends...

86
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:29,159
Very close, so you decided
to take advantage.

87
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,199
No, Lorenzo asked me to.

88
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,039
Yes, that's the beauty of friendship.

89
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,839
To take care of each other's needs
and satisfy them even when not asked.

90
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,030
And how do you satisfy Lorenzo?

91
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,159
I already slept with him twice.

92
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,279
- But we're just friends.
- Friends who have sex too.

93
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,639
But he has sex with guys also.

94
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,079
- Gosh, a bisexual!
- One big revelation after another.

95
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,159
No pigeonholes, please,
I don't like labels.

96
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,874
If I like a person, I don't care who
they are or what they do...

97
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,399
...it depends on what
you feel, on your emotions.

98
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,474
- So, you write fairy-tales?
- Are you pulling my leg?

99
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:43,319
Dinner is served!

100
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,239
I'd never do that,
I'd love to pull something else.

101
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,834
Don't waste your time,
he's not a gerontophile.

102
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:55,670
You grabbed the only one left!

103
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,995
These guys are very talented
about food. Trust me.

104
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,239
There are moments like this
when I feeI happy.

105
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,559
I don't know why, but seeing Davide
with our friends makes me feeI safe.

106
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,999
I know what's on their minds...

107
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,759
...same thoughts, same
words, that's how I like it.

108
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,039
I don't want surprises
or sudden changes.

109
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,039
I want things to stay
as they are now, forever...

110
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,999
...even though I know
"forever" doesn't exist.

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,679
I know what they'll do later on.

112
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,279
Angelica will try not to
wake up anyone at home.

113
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:56,038
...and she'll read a book
in bed waiting for Antonio.

114
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,235
So?

115
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,639
- She's back...
- You have school tomorrow.

116
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,919
The film was on only at midnight.

117
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,359
- You could have taped it.
- Did you repair the VCR?

118
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,074
- I told you not to let him eat.
- He feeds himself.

119
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:22,559
You're his big sister.

120
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,834
If he eats so much, it's not because
he has problems with his big sister...

121
00:09:26,835 --> 00:09:30,039
...must be he has
problems with someone else.

122
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,119
- And you're a psychologist!
- When Dad gets home, you'll get it!

123
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,454
He's already in bed
and he even took a shower.

124
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:38,754
- So?
- He usually showers in the morning.

125
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:42,279
Daddy said he smelled of fish.

126
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,239
I can't go to sleep without
watching two hours of television.

127
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,759
Davide hates TV, but I have to
watch at least one yilm a night.

128
00:09:51,760 --> 00:10:00,759
Lorenzo, let's go to bed.
You have to get up early tomorrow.

129
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,915
Wait, let me finish this dream.

130
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,954
- The building superintendent?
- I'm seeing him alone.

131
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:13,074
- Are you sure?
- Yes, it's for the best.

132
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:15,279
Ok then. Waiting for news.

133
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,079
-I'm going to the bank right now.
-Great.

134
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,434
I've got another call, bye.

135
00:10:20,435 --> 00:10:23,359
-Ok.
-See you.

136
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,594
- Hello?
- Hi, Lorenzo. Angelica.

137
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:27,871
- I'm worried about Roberta...
- Why?

138
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:30,079
She was acting
strange last night.

139
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,519
- You have to tell her.
- She doesn't listen to me.

140
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,814
How many times
have we already tried with her?

141
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:38,074
I could get her an
appointment with a doctor...

142
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:40,111
...but she has to
believe herself.

143
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:42,290
- Otherwise it won't work.
-Antonio!

144
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,434
- What?
-He just came out of the bank...

145
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,679
I'll catch him for you.

146
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,999
We have to do something
or she'll get worse.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,519
What's the matter?
You sound nervous.

148
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,399
The usual mess,
Giulia missed school again today.

149
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,119
Wait.

150
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,790
- No way.
- No, what?

151
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,879
- Antonio went back inside.
- I'll call him later.

152
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,439
Do something about Roberta,
you're the only one she listens to.

153
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,239
- Promise me.
- Yes, I promise. Can I call you later?

154
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,077
-Sure, okay.
-Bye.

155
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,159
Don't say you're
late, schmuck-oo.

156
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,314
- I can't find parking.
- Didn't you use your scooter?

157
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:37,354
- No, I drove.
- With all this traffic?

158
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:39,474
I've got a meeting in 15 minutes.

159
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:41,479
You weren't around earlier.

160
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,854
- Meaning what?
- You can't fool me.

161
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:46,879
- What's bugging you?
- I saw you.

162
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,919
- When?
- Who was she?

163
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,399
- Who?
- I saw you with a woman.

164
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,159
- She's a client.
- Do you kiss your clients?

165
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,999
- She's a friend, you kiss friends.
- Not on the lips.

166
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,599
I'll be 10 minutes late,
could you tell them?

167
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,999
Are you jealous now?

168
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,074
- Does Angelica know her, too?
- Mind your own fuckin' business.

169
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:14,674
- It is my business.
- Knock it off and try to get here...

170
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:19,039
I've got a busy day.

171
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,759
It's none of my fuckin' business,
maybe I was wrong.

172
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:33,279
And just when I needed him! Did I upset
him? Maybe he's just getting laid, so what?

173
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,599
Where's the harm?
What if Angelica finds out though?

174
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,755
If they break up?

175
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,839
Your daughter missed school,
today. Angelica told me.

176
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,999
- Did you call her?
- I was on my cell with her when I saw you.

177
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,479
- But I didn't say a thing.
- What was there to say?

178
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,879
I've known that woman for years,
she's almost a friend.

179
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,719
Angelica doesn't know
all my friends at work.

180
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
Do you know all
of Davide's friends?

181
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,039
- Yes.
- Even those at the publishing house?

182
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,076
Yes.

183
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,359
- I didn't kiss her on the mouth.
- On the lips.

184
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,039
You phoned me just to say this?
You call that normal?

185
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,319
No, maybe you're right.

186
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,519
Now tell me why you're here?

187
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,679
I came to ask you a favor.

188
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,159
I need 15,000 euros right away...

189
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,951
...but I can't take it
from the company account.

190
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,399
Take it from your own, it's there.

191
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,314
I have to grease three different
people, but I don't want Davide to know.

192
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:49,794
In fact I don't want
to be asked questions.

193
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:53,559
- I'll find a way.
- Thank you.

194
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,279
This money has to be back in a week.

195
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,479
Sure... Neval
has a great idea.

196
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,919
She wants us all to go
to Lipari in two weeks.

197
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,999
- Angelica's excited.
- She already knows?

198
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,389
Of course.

199
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,679
Leave a message if you like,
I might return your call,

200
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,239
...it all depends on my mood.

201
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,279
Neval, I've decided,
in two weeks we'll all go to Lipari.

202
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,879
I'll arrange things, as usual.

203
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,199
I've already told everyone,
so you and Roberto have to come.

204
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,679
- How was work?
- As usual, why?

205
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,599
- Me asking about you, is that odd?
- No.

206
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,599
You have to talk to Giulia about
school, it's becoming a problem.

207
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,039
- You're better at that.
- You should give her rules.

208
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,279
And I should be the one
who protects her when she disobeys.

209
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,434
- Why is it so hard for you?
- There's a reason why she disobeys.

210
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:59,519
Find it out, I don't want to be
my daughter's psychologist.

211
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,759
- What are you doing?
- Using a night cream.

212
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,279
Neval's pissed off with Lorenzo
and it's my fault.

213
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,914
He said the trip
was her idea, but he lied.

214
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:12,879
I didn't know, so I told Neval.

215
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,314
It's Lorenzo's fault, not yours.

216
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,235
Yes.

217
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,399
Why go so far away?

218
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,454
How about our usual place?

219
00:15:20,455 --> 00:15:22,439
Maybe I have to go away...

220
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,999
- ... for a training course.
- Over the weekend?

221
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,473
The bank pays me double.

222
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,074
Lorenzo's acting odd, isn't he?

223
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:41,359
Maybe he and Paolo...

224
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,799
I don't even know who Paolo is.

225
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,719
Lorenzo wanted Davide to read
his short story, no matter what.

226
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,999
You know Lorenzo,
he'd help even a stranger.

227
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,239
Maybe he's in love with someone
else or maybe he wants Davide...

228
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,279
-... to fall in love with Paolo.
- You make life so complicated!

229
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,519
It happens, sometimes a person
wants to be cheated on...

230
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,839
...and puts the other
in a position to do so.

231
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:13,757
- Will you stop?
- Why?

232
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,759
Nothing.

233
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,319
What's wrong?

234
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,076
Davide...

235
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,879
Is it Angelica?

236
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,799
Is it your work?

237
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,875
Change jobs, go on!
You still have time.

238
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,159
Look, no one ordered Angelica
to write that book.

239
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:31,839
Lorenzo too, started his job just to earn
some extra money, now he loves his work.

240
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,845
What book?

241
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,879
I gave her the idea to write
on how to quit smoking...

242
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,759
- ... didn't she tell you?
- She will.

243
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,274
Sure!

244
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,189
After you call her.

245
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,319
- I'm having an affair.
- What?

246
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,039
Wait!

247
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,039
- Eat mine, too.
- Throw it out if you want!

248
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,959
- No, they'll notice.
- I can't eat twice.

249
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,279
You can eat much
more than that.

250
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,474
- I'll tell Daddy.
- If you don't eat...

251
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:25,319
...you'll pay for it!

252
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,479
You know what that means, right?

253
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,119
This is unfair!

254
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,874
- Shut up!
- Signor Antonio! Signor Antonio!

255
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,999
- Yes, Rosy.
- The children are eating.

256
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,799
- Will you wait for your wife?
- Yes, Angelica will get home late.

257
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,919
- You can go, thank you.
- Will you watch the kids?

258
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,995
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

259
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:00,680
Good night.

260
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,676
Hurry up and eat!

261
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,319
I know, you don't want
to talk about it, are you outside?

262
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,599
No, it's the TV.
Have you talked to Lorenzo?

263
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,479
No, why?
Changing the subject?

264
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,879
I made it all up.

265
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,359
- You're not having an affair?
- No.

266
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,839
- Then why did you say so?
- I don't know.

267
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:53,319
I was pissed off because I didn't know about
Angelica's book, you two have your secrets.

268
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,679
You and I were friends
before I met Angelica.

269
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,959
Who you meet first doesn't matter.

270
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,079
- Anyway, I'm here for you.
- I know, forgive me.

271
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,799
I'm a pain in the ass sometimes.

272
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,839
- A lot.
- Goodbye.

273
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,639
- Was that Antonio?
- Yes, why?

274
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,399
- He was acting weird yesterday.
- Were you at the bank?

275
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,719
I bumped into him on the street.

276
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,679
- So?
- So, what?

277
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:34,517
Your building...
Did you get it?

278
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,835
I'll know tomorrow,
but things are looking good.

279
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,199
- How is it?
- I'm not done, no judgement yet.

280
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,719
A sneak preview!

281
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,039
Your friend's in love with
me. He copies me.

282
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,239
- But he writes well.
- He's in love because he copies you?

283
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,319
He gets his style from me,
but he's got his own spirit.

284
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,190
- What's it about?
- Love.

285
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,159
About how we always fall in love
with the wrong person.

286
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:24,238
- There are exceptions, right?
- Until proven differently.

287
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,679
- Isn't that a beautiful building?
- Yeah.

288
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,319
What's so funny?

289
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,594
You think a building's beautiful
only when it's covered.

290
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,839
I do, if I did the covering!

291
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,839
Know how many of us
were competing for this spot?

292
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,119
Whoever won it,
got eight other spots too.

293
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,519
- It cost me a lot.
- In bribes.

294
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,519
Roberta, no bribes,
what are you saying?

295
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,279
- You could be more supportive.
- I didn't say a word!

296
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,319
Didn't you!

297
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,839
Let's go to that bookshop, your
book's probably not on sale...

298
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,034
- But if it's there, we'll laugh!
- I love you. I love you.

299
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:47,070
Let's go.

300
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,599
- Ok.
- Let's go.

301
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,834
And I'm the drug addict!

302
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,599
Everything has to
be perfect today.

303
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,999
I got what I wanted, Paolo will get
Davide's approvaI, he promised me.

304
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,559
And Antonio came without his usuaI excuses,
so maybe I really saw things wrong.

305
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:19,879
Today I want us all to be
relaxed and happy.

306
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,279
Fuck off Lorenzo,
you're morbid and suffocating.

307
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,039
You want to see us cooped
up in a cage and feed us birdseed.

308
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,439
I just proposed a trip.

309
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,439
Why go tell everyone it was my idea?

310
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,919
We haven't done anything
together for a long time.

311
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,559
It's not our fault if you
and that junkie joined us later...

312
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,359
...all of us have been friends for
ages. You can't even imagine...

313
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,594
- ... all the things we've done together.
- Don't come if you don't want to.

314
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,519
Can't you step off the
stage just once?

315
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,759
Lorenzo! Lorenzo
wait a minute. Listen to me.

316
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,359
She'll come anyway.
Are you mad?

317
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,628
I'll get over it.

318
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,679
Neval had her usual outburst,
I think Lorenzo didn't take it well.

319
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,114
Why did you have to talk,
you're not even coming to Lipari.

320
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:43,719
- Why not?
- He has a training course.

321
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,637
I said "maybe",
I could change my mind.

322
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,759
Not even a bottle of champagne?

323
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:59,439
Lorenzo doesn't like it
and it's his party.

324
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,954
- Coming in all wet?
- I have to dry off.

325
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:06,079
What about your clothes?

326
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,159
I'll hang them in the bathroom!

327
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,319
It's not a "nude party".
Where are you going?

328
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,239
- To get some champagne.
- God bless you!

329
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,799
Pato, I made a bit of a mess,
but I'll clean it up.

330
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:27,359
What's the matter?
Pato, what's wrong?

331
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,599
- A little headache.
- Sure, with Neval always yacking!

332
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,599
- I'll put you back in shape.
- I don't use that stuff.

333
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,312
- I've even got legal stuff.
- I don't want anything.

334
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,199
Not this one...
What's this pill?

335
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,994
I wish I was like you.

336
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,931
- Are you Paolo?
- Yes.

337
00:27:08,932 --> 00:27:11,639
My wife told me about you.

338
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,879
Nice to meet you...

339
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,199
I'm Roberto, Neval's husband.

340
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,039
Hello, do I give this to you?

341
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,159
- What kind of pastry is it?
- A chocolate cake.

342
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,997
Too bad! I love fruit cake.

343
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:46,799
I can't come with you next weekend.

344
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,119
Lorenzo saw us. I was
about to tell Davide...

345
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:02,199
But I think he knows.
I can't lie anymore.

346
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,119
It has to stop here, it's best.

347
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,195
It has to stop here
because you can't lie anymore?

348
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,399
- Are you falling in love with me?
- No... yes...

349
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:33,719
I don't know. I can't
see you anymore, Laura.

350
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,919
Are you afraid?

351
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:44,235
It's my fault,
I'm not strong enough.

352
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,239
His cell is off,
how long can it take him?

353
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,439
He'll never find champagne
around here at night.

354
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,196
He's been acting so strange lately.

355
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:19,434
I told him about the book,
sorry. It really upset him.

356
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:24,519
Who knows, maybe... He's jealous.

357
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,239
- Of what?
-Of us.

358
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:36,478
Still, you gotta be kidding!

359
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,599
- How do I look?
- Out of it.

360
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,719
- Is it that obvious?
- What's she wearing?

361
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,359
- Is that mine or Davide's sweater?
- I'm wearing your sweater.

362
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,079
- No, it's Lorenzo's.
- Let's eat, I'm hungry.

363
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,039
Let's wait for Antonio.

364
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,114
Forget about Antonio.

365
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:57,079
Allright then.

366
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,134
You should have been a chef,
not a writer.

367
00:29:59,135 --> 00:30:01,154
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- It is!

368
00:30:01,155 --> 00:30:05,479
- I'll go change.
- Yeah, you stink!

369
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,875
- Not going to pick out his underwear?
- I already did.

370
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,952
To the guest of honor!

371
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,429
I must remember
to change the light in this room.

372
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,790
Guys!

373
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,399
It took me forever
to find champagne.

374
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,714
I'll try to massage him today,
after Davide comes out.

375
00:33:32,715 --> 00:33:37,039
But Davide's never left the room.

376
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,999
- When are they going to operate?
- Nobody mentions it anymore.

377
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,874
At two o'clock
I'll see the doctor on duty.

378
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:46,679
You realize they're not
telling us everything?

379
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,719
Paolo wants one of his doctor
friends to do some asking.

380
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,834
- Between doctors.
- What's that little fag know?

381
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:55,879
Still here!

382
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,634
You can't stay
after visiting hours.

383
00:33:58,635 --> 00:34:01,279
We'll be quiet, we won't move.

384
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,039
Wait outside, please.

385
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:10,054
- We'll be serving lunch soon.
- But he doesn't eat.

386
00:34:10,055 --> 00:34:14,034
- Don't make me kick you out.
- What's your sign?

387
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:15,999
I'm serious.

388
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,599
Give me your birth-date and time
of birth, I'll do your horoscope.

389
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,994
It's the only thing she's good at.

390
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,199
-When will they let us in?
-In ten minutes.

391
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:42,119
Yesterday I said: "If you understand
me, move your lips" and he moved them.

392
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,359
- The lower lip?
- Yes.

393
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,399
- It's a reflex movement.
- No, he understood.

394
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,799
He doesn't understand.

395
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,719
Then why did the nurse
tell us to talk to him?

396
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,999
Because you never know.

397
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,474
His eyes were wide open last night.

398
00:34:57,475 --> 00:35:01,039
- He never closed them.
- Hi.

399
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,879
Did your doctor friend
talk to the doctor here?

400
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,399
- Yes.
- And?

401
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,439
A subarachnoid hemorrhage
at the base of the neck...

402
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,559
It has invaded both lobes.

403
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:25,114
Even with a miracle, he'd
be paralyzed from the neck down.

404
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,999
But there'll be no miracle.

405
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,156
- How long can he survive?
- He told me to hope he dies.

406
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,760
I just can't leave him.

407
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,079
I'm in love.

408
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,559
I know, for a long time.

409
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,679
Not so long.

410
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,519
From the first
moment you saw her.

411
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,119
Yes, right away.

412
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:09,079
I bet you don't remember where.

413
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:16,239
Of course I remember.
In a cafe.

414
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:25,957
No, dummy! The first time we met
it was in the university auditorium.

415
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,913
This time it was
in a cafe near the bank.

416
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,719
- This time?
- Yes.

417
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:52,119
I have a thing going
with another woman.

418
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,839
- What kind of "thing"?
- I don't know.

419
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:02,200
- You have a relationship?
- Maybe.

420
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,836
Since when?

421
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,559
A few months.

422
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:18,638
I'd dumped her,
but I saw her again today.

423
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,439
- What a way to tell me!
- Is there a better way?

424
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,119
What timing, with
Lorenzo in that condition.

425
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,559
I don't want to know anything,
don't say another word.

426
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,679
I'll pretend you didn't say anything.

427
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,879
-Angelica?
- Shut up, nothing's happened.

428
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,514
Did you hear me?
I'm having sex with another woman!

429
00:40:49,515 --> 00:40:55,670
Lower your voice,
you'll wake up the kids.

430
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,351
- What are they saying?
- Shut up!

431
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:10,239
No questions?

432
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,354
Don't you want to know who she is?

433
00:41:12,355 --> 00:41:16,233
No.

434
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,999
You know what? Maybe you just want
to feel young with a young girl.

435
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,271
She's not a young girl,
she has two kids, one's 16.

436
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:44,432
Great! Then it's a
lot more complicated.

437
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,519
- What are you doing?
- I'm making the bed.

438
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:00,392
We won't be going back to sleep.

439
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:14,155
Stop moving your hand,
you won't die!

440
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,359
Help me, I don't
know what to do.

441
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,759
Want my congratulations?

442
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,759
Do you want my approval,
want me to make a scene?

443
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,319
Stop with that hand!

444
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:39,799
Want me to kick you out?
Okay then, get out!

445
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,439
- I don't want to leave.
- Alright, then I will.

446
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,319
Why does one of us have to leave?

447
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,399
Okay then, let's all live
together, bring her here.

448
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,794
Have you picked her room?

449
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,279
As of today we're
part of a majority.

450
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,439
- What's that?
- Now our parents are separated.

451
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,559
So, you'll be assigned to Dad
in another house...

452
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,154
...with another mother and other kids
and treated like a step-brother.

453
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:21,239
- You'll sleep in the cellar.
- Mommy!

454
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,759
- What is it?
- Will I have to sleep in a cellar?

455
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,919
- What did you say?
- Why are you fighting?

456
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,479
Haven't you heard
us argue before?

457
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:41,833
Be a good boy, we'll stop
now. Go to bed. Get up there!

458
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,273
So... I'm leaving.

459
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,674
- What are you doing here?
- Just passing through.

460
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:34,389
Won't you run after him?
On TV they always return if you do.

461
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,719
What if I run after him?

462
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,637
Don't you move.

463
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,599
A real mess, eh?

464
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,914
I saw Angelica this morning
at the hospital.

465
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,354
When are you going in there
to see Lorenzo?

466
00:45:10,355 --> 00:45:12,594
- I can't.
- Then stay home.

467
00:45:12,595 --> 00:45:14,994
I can't.

468
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,439
But you can come and go
from the bathroom.

469
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,839
She'll probably
ask for her horoscope!

470
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,274
Roberta would like to talk to you
about your horoscope.

471
00:45:27,275 --> 00:45:33,119
You asshole...

472
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,839
- I'd promised you.
- What's it like?

473
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:41,839
A sort of... Do you
believe in reincarnation?

474
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,879
We all have many lives,
some go better than others.

475
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,799
If you have a shitty life,
maybe the next one will be wonderful.

476
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,194
- I have a lousy horoscope.
- In fact...

477
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:59,439
I knew that, thank you anyway.

478
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,839
I didn't mean to...

479
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,839
She hates me and she'll
hate me in her next life.

480
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,599
- You could have lied, you're a liar.
- I never lie about horoscopes.

481
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:18,790
They're here. The
nurse said they're coming up.

482
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,919
- I'm Angelica, I called you.
- Thank you.

483
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,199
This is Davide.

484
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,239
- Hi.
- Hi.

485
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:44,156
- We saw you on TV.
- This is my wife.

486
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,554
Lorenzo is stable, they didn't
mention any operation for now.

487
00:46:50,555 --> 00:46:55,559
Thank you, but I've already spoken
with the doctor.

488
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:03,832
- You can go in, one at a time.
- You go, I'll wait here.

489
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:35,232
- They're Lorenzo's friends.
- Are they?

490
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,039
- Hi.
- Hi.

491
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,439
What an awful moment to meet.

492
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,319
I'm Minnie.

493
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,759
- Like Minnie Mouse.
- It's a funny name...

494
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,719
But it's better than my real name,
Minerva. My father loved mythology.

495
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,159
He's Sergio, Roberta and I'm Neval.

496
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,759
- A foreigner?
- No, Turkish.

497
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,039
Ah, I see! Istanbul, how beautiful!
I was there two years ago.

498
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,279
- Do you work with Lorenzo?
- No, she's a translator.

499
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,759
Really, I'm an interpreter for
conferences, a simultaneous translator.

500
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:19,159
- I work with Lorenzo.
- She helps him out.

501
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,879
- What do you do?
- Nothing.

502
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,559
His mother left
him a small income.

503
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:32,039
I don't do anything either,
besides being a wife.

504
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,479
Since Vittorio sold the company, I
always asked him to bring me to Rome...

505
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,919
I've never been.
It took this terrible misfortune.

506
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:47,519
But I used to work.
I was a hairdresser.

507
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,595
Who'd have imagined!

508
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,119
- I didn't want to leave.
- What did you want?

509
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,199
To tell her the truth,
I couldn't stand lying anymore...

510
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,230
...not about
something so important.

511
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,679
Rules exist even for relationships.

512
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,839
Can't the rules change?

513
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:19,359
In my fairy-tales,when the protagonist
and the prince finally get together...

514
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,639
He can't tell her
he loves another woman too.

515
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,039
Two people live "happily
ever after", not three.

516
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,639
What are you talking about?
Fairy-tales, rules...

517
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:37,399
But you do just as you like,
are you the only one allowed?

518
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,719
I can't because I'm not
talented, not creative?

519
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,839
Only you have the right,
because no one ever leaves you?

520
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,479
They're all around you like puppies...

521
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,599
You're the chief, the artist,
you have control over everybody.

522
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,279
It's about you and Angelica, not me!

523
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:05,519
Exactly. Angelica and I
have always shared everything,

524
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,879
But now she's not supposed to
know anything about me?

525
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:15,439
Suddenly I'm a stranger. I'm her
husband, but I'm also Antonio...

526
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,479
...now Antonio is experiencing something
new. Does this change me, am I different?

527
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,999
I can't understand that.

528
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,839
Even so, can't she
experience this with me?

529
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:31,394
Philosophical masturbation.
You wanna get laid, get laid!

530
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,509
I can't separate myself from her.

531
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,513
I can?

532
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:54,636
Oh God, Davide!

533
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:59,353
I'm sorry.

534
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:24,553
Pato? Pato?

535
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,799
Is he suffering?

536
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,159
Maybe, we don't know.

537
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,599
Why are you here
in the middle of the night?

538
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:17,109
- Isn't his friend enough?
- Davide fell asleep.

539
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,199
Get some sleep yourself.

540
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,398
I can't.

541
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:33,238
I have a horrible horoscope too.

542
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,679
I don't expect a happy ending.

543
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,759
Maybe I'm already at the end.

544
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:46,079
I do drugs.
Did you ever do drugs?

545
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:50,799
No, I crochet.
What kind of drugs?

546
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,839
Everything, except heroin.

547
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:59,999
All I do is doilies,
but my next step is knitting.

548
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,793
So you could knit scarves,
everyone loves scarves.

549
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:15,034
Ever think of getting a
complete check-up, a blood test?

550
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,599
You should, you're still so young.

551
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,759
If they saw what's in my blood,
they'd put me behind bars.

552
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:28,870
-You're a pessimist.
-No, I'm a loser.

553
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,479
Your friend's father
wants to take him away...

554
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:41,399
-Did you know that?
-Where does he want to take him?

555
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:48,319
Up north, where he lives, to a hospital
for the terminally ill. If he survives.

556
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:52,199
None of us would know.

557
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,479
He didn't tell us, not even Davide.

558
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:00,199
He's not obliged to tell you.
Who are you though?

559
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:05,399
You're just his friends and,
in this case, you don't count shit.

560
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:13,149
I'm sorry. I get a little
foul-mouthed after 3 A.M.

561
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,799
Vittorio really wanted
to see Lorenzo's home.

562
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:37,910
- He knows, I asked him myself.
- Nice painting, isn't it?

563
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,719
-How about some coffee?
-I'd like to see my son's room.

564
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,950
Here.

565
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:05,559
Here are his things. They're mixed with
mine, we wear each other's things, often.

566
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:10,279
How lucky. Do you
wear each other's shoes too?

567
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:15,833
Come with me,
let's leave them alone.

568
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,199
- Does Lorenzo sleep here?
- Yes.

569
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,714
And it's your room too.

570
00:55:35,715 --> 00:55:39,319
Yes, of course.

571
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,679
- Is this house yours?
- It's ours.

572
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,439
Of course, but you own it.

573
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,799
- I bought it before I met Lorenzo.
- He's your guest.

574
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,799
No, it's his as well. When we
remodeled it, he paid his share.

575
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:03,195
And a lot of things belong to him.

576
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:11,119
- Are you that way too?
- What way?

577
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,074
Like them, like him, I mean.

578
00:56:14,075 --> 00:56:17,639
- In grief?
- No, gay!

579
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:23,799
- Me gay? No! I'm a fag.
- I see. Isn't it the same thing?

580
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,279
Yes, but I'm old-fashioned.

581
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,434
He bought the sofa with his first
paycheck... He wanted a wide screen TV.

582
00:56:32,435 --> 00:56:39,432
The DVDs and
the videocassettes are his.

583
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:43,799
- Have you a co-signed bank account?
- Yes, we do.

584
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,399
But Davide makes more money.

585
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,439
- Sergio, that's not the point.
- How about that coffee?

586
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,715
Please.

587
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,479
We can make an inventory
of what's his and what's mine.

588
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,079
I'm not here for an inventory,
I just want to understand.

589
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:13,269
There's not
much to understand.

590
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:25,791
For me there is.

591
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,319
A great deal.

592
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,559
Don't go by appearances,
Vittorio loves his son very much.

593
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,719
Is that why he kicked him out?

594
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,599
He didn't kick him out,
Lorenzo wanted to leave.

595
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,759
Once he came out, the
atmosphere at home was strained.

596
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,719
It was a shock,
he didn't want that kind of son.

597
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:54,119
What kind then?

598
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,479
What does a father
expect his son to be?

599
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,039
An aviator?

600
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,879
I like you, you make me laugh!

601
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,319
- Not as much as you make me.
- Really?

602
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,079
It's a compliment, believe me.

603
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,519
His son was happy, wasn't he?

604
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,750
Was he?

605
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,919
Lorenzo makes other people
happy and you know why?

606
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:25,559
Because he's not afraid
of expressing his feelings.

607
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:30,199
He always hated me, I never
tried to replace his mother...

608
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,559
I wanted his father to accept him.

609
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,114
It's not a matter of
acceptance, but of sharing.

610
00:58:35,115 --> 00:58:41,156
Ah, sharing.

611
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,839
- How's it going?
- No improvement.

612
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,599
- I meant you.
- Fine.

613
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:29,839
- Work?
- Fine.

614
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:35,479
-At home?
-Fine.

615
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,669
- So, everything's fine.
- Yes.

616
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:53,359
Don't worry, the doctors
won't authorize his transfer...

617
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,719
-He's in no condition to be moved.
-Is he dying?

618
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,479
Ask the doctors.

619
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,999
You're doing all you can for him?

620
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,879
It's our duty. Do
you have any complaints?

621
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,919
I meant something else. Look!

622
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:18,599
Even though we're always here, I'd like
you to know... If there's no more hope,

623
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:25,119
- If he should go on suffering...
- What are you getting at?

624
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:28,514
Don't misunderstand me,
I didn't mean to...

625
01:01:28,515 --> 01:01:34,439
Then not another word.

626
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,635
Bye.

627
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:47,230
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

628
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,839
I hear you do floral arrangements
for weddings, parties and baptisms.

629
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:00,039
- Yes, sure.
- And for divorces too?

630
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,079
I've never had to.

631
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,239
That's odd. You're doing all
you can to cause a divorce.

632
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:11,395
- Who are you?
- I'm here for Antonio.

633
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,159
- Did he send you?
- No.

634
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,559
- Did his wife?
- No!

635
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,319
If she finds out, she'll kill me.

636
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:26,039
I like to meddle, I can't help it.

637
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:29,634
When I care for a friend,
I want to know what he's involved in.

638
01:02:29,635 --> 01:02:32,879
Do you love him?

639
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,875
I don't even know if he loves me.

640
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,839
How long does it take to make
this kind of arrangement?

641
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,039
Almost all day.

642
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:49,359
I have an urge to rip it apart!

643
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:54,039
- Would it resolve anything?
- I'd take one less tranquillizer.

644
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:58,799
Then do it. I really mean it, or...

645
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:04,279
Let's do it together,
one less tranquillizer for me too.

646
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:09,279
I can't, I'd be your accomplice.

647
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,039
...and I don't collaborate
with the enemy.

648
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:16,999
I'm on Angelica's side.

649
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:24,079
- At first we just slept together.
- And now?

650
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,279
- I don't know.
- There's a lot on your plate...

651
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:35,108
Because you have a lover who's available
and who really needs your consoling.

652
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:41,912
Be kind to him, do it for us.

653
01:03:54,280 --> 01:04:00,959
Not now, we have to clean him
and change the drip.

654
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:23,471
Let's go get some coffee?

655
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,156
Hello.

656
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:07,474
They wouldn't let me in,
I thought you might be here.

657
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:46,670
Lorenzo has gone to sleep.

658
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:16,159
- How long will it take to move him?
- It depends...

659
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:22,679
- You want to take him up north?
- Yes, to bury him next to his mother.

660
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:26,079
Funeral services
will handle the transfer.

661
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,279
- He wanted to be cremated.
- Do you have that in writing?

662
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,479
No, we just talked about it.

663
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,479
- What have you decided?
- Do we have to decide right away?

664
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:42,794
If you want to say goodbye,
they'll be putting him away soon.

665
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:53,549
Excuse me!
Lorenzo Marchetti's relatives?

666
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:59,392
-Yes, that's us.
-Come this way.

667
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:34,516
Want me to come home this evening?

668
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,199
It's better if you don't.

669
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:44,560
You're right.

670
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:50,599
I did what Lorenzo wanted,
he'll be cremated.

671
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:55,719
I'll leave his ashes with you,
do what he would have wanted.

672
01:13:55,720 --> 01:14:01,399
We'll say a Mass
if you have no objection.

673
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:06,479
If any of you
come up our way and visit us...

674
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:12,511
We'd like that.

675
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:28,793
It's going to be hard,
especially for you, Davide. Be strong.

676
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:53,399
What are your plans for Christmas?
I'd like to go skiing...

677
01:14:53,400 --> 01:15:01,159
Even though I don't know how. I
could learn... But I never learn anything.

678
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:05,996
Isn't it early to make plans?

679
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,279
Would you like to be like me?

680
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,119
-In what sense?
-Right, it doesn't make sense.

681
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:33,999
I knew that it made no sense.
Who'd like to be like me?

682
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,639
No one, not even me.

683
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:38,679
Cut it out, you're exaggerating.

684
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:46,559
I always exaggerate.
It's the only thing I'm good at.

685
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:53,439
Have you heard from Davide?
I'm talking to you.

686
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,479
- Heard from him?
- What do you want?

687
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,714
- I asked if you'd heard from Davide.
- Call him.

688
01:15:58,715 --> 01:16:01,039
Do I always have to call?

689
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,795
Calm down. I just
asked a qu... question.

690
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:10,879
I wonder how you made it into
the Police Force with how you speak.

691
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:16,599
I stutterjust with you, all I asked
was if you'd heard from Davide and A...

692
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,839
- Angelica.
- Well?

693
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:25,159
Call them yourself! Then you
complain you're a fifth wheel.

694
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:31,039
If you want to know about
Davide or Angelica, call them!

695
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:37,037
- What do you want from me?
- What's wrong with you today?

696
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,873
The French and Turkish
versions are perfect...

697
01:18:33,874 --> 01:18:38,679
I'll bring you the English one
in four days.

698
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:48,352
I met her. Antonio
doesn't know, I went on my own.

699
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:56,559
Antonio's your best friend, you have
every right to know who he sees.

700
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,479
Aren't you going to ask
what she's like, what we did?

701
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:04,159
If she's thin, tall,
if she's cooler than you.

702
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,479
- You want to argue, don't you?
- No.

703
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:10,359
I just want to see you have
a reaction, get angry!

704
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:16,079
I didn't fight with Antonio,
and I don't want to fight with you.

705
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:20,919
She's nice and also married.
They were perfect as secret lovers...

706
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,039
- Antonio shouldn't have told you.
- In fact, he left the house.

707
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:30,034
Why don't you try to get him back
or call it quits?

708
01:19:30,035 --> 01:19:33,319
- Aren't you jealous?
- I'm very jealous.

709
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:40,314
It's just that, maybe... I envy him, he did
something I'd never have dreamed of doing.

710
01:19:40,315 --> 01:19:42,319
And you didn't talk to him.

711
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:47,639
Antonio threw a pebble in the
mud puddle and you didn't pick it up.

712
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:52,079
- So, my marriage is a mud puddle?
- It was a metaphor.

713
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,359
Your lectures on life
really tick me off.

714
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,674
What have you got to teach others?

715
01:19:58,675 --> 01:20:01,639
At last, spit it out!

716
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,319
You married a slave
you can manipulate...

717
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,799
You act like the perfect
wife telling me what to do.

718
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,239
All you do is to criticize.

719
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:16,759
You even clawed at Lorenzo
before he fell ill.

720
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,039
- Now you've gone too far.
- You are right.

721
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:26,279
I have to take advantage of this situation.
To get rid of some of my friends...

722
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:30,759
- To prune the thin branches.
- I'm not a thin branch.

723
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:36,632
That's obvious, given your size.

724
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,319
- Yes?
- Good morning, sir.

725
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,834
Mrs. Pontesilli
is here for you.

726
01:20:50,835 --> 01:20:54,319
Yes, put her on.

727
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,399
-Antonio...
- What are you doing here?

728
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:00,639
- Davide is missing.
- Couldn't you have phoned?

729
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:04,399
- Your cell is off.
- I mean here, at the hotel.

730
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:09,199
I found the address first.

731
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:12,679
Did you hear me, Davide is missing,
they're waiting for us.

732
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:18,199
Give me five minutes,
I'll be right down.

733
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:25,075
Okay, I'll be right up.

734
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,039
Third floor, room 32.

735
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:33,831
- It's late, I have to go.
- Ready.

736
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:51,439
Excuse me, I never
thought I'd find you here.

737
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:55,439
I'm looking for my husband.

738
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,594
- He's almost ready, come in.
- No, I'll wait downstairs.

739
01:21:59,595 --> 01:22:01,954
I'm leaving, you can wait here.

740
01:22:01,955 --> 01:22:03,876
Come in.

741
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,679
This is Antonio's room,
I don't live here.

742
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,399
- So, you're just passing through?
- It's my first night here.

743
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,634
I'm embarrassed, I'll go down.

744
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:25,391
I'm leaving, honestly.

745
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:34,439
I knew you were here,
but I was curious to meet you.

746
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,000
Me too.

747
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,599
Something serious has happened
or I wouldn't have come.

748
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:46,719
Then we wouldn't
have met. I'm Laura.

749
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,870
Angelica.

750
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:55,679
Now that you've finished
with formalities, we can all go.

751
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:59,119
You both go, it's odd for all of
us to leave together.

752
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,759
You go first.

753
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,599
I just have to open the shop,
you both have an emergency.

754
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,834
- Please go ahead.
- I've already intruded...

755
01:23:07,835 --> 01:23:13,319
I'll go, or there'll
be no end to this.

756
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:19,078
Alright, goodbye.

757
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:54,755
I'm over here.

758
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:06,039
- Hi.
- Hi.

759
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,311
It's cold in the house at night.

760
01:25:08,312 --> 01:25:13,315
You have some wine to warm us.

761
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,839
Did Sergio tell you to come here?

762
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:28,749
When he said you were here,
we got a little nostalgic.

763
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:36,195
- Hi.
- No one's working today?

764
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:51,239
Your first novels have
come out in paperback.

765
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:56,600
That's right.

766
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:13,832
- Let's open another bottle?
- Would be fine.

767
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,631
- Can I help you?
- There's no need.

768
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,795
There was no need
to bring them all here.

769
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,879
You can't even imagine the pain.

770
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,956
You think you know everything
but you don't know a fuckin' thing.

771
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:56,839
You don't know what it means
to survive him...

772
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:02,950
...or you wouldn't be here.

773
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:08,679
And you'd leave me alone.

774
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:14,040
You're right.

775
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:28,759
You can't get away with just
wine, we're staying for dinner.

776
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:32,439
- There's not much in the house.
- We'll whip something up.

777
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:36,958
- We'll find some food.
- Sure...

778
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:54,319
There were tables everywhere, there must
have been more than 80 people.

779
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:01,399
It was the first time I came
here, Lorenzo brought me.

780
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:06,839
I was sure he wanted
to make a pass at me.

781
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:14,839
But it happened right here,
Lorenzo and Davide's first kiss.

782
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:19,039
I was dumbfounded, but
you can't imagine how Sergio felt.

783
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:22,599
- Sergio and Davide were a couple?
- Exactly.

784
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:27,679
Sergio is "Rebecca", the first wife.

785
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:30,799
But you'll never be the third.

786
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:35,119
Come on, it never crossed my mind!

787
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,679
Yeah, right!

788
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:43,279
- About what I said the other day...
- Just forget it.

789
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,319
Laura left her husband.

790
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:49,639
- You never give up!
- She hasn't told Antonio yet.

791
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,359
So you hang out together?

792
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,119
No, I ran into her by chance.

793
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:58,039
Nothing happens to you by chance.

794
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:01,529
How about some potato soup?

795
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:07,751
No, Lorenzo doesn't like...

796
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:15,799
Roberto, ever see a woman and think:
"I'd love to get into her pants"?

797
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:18,354
Yes, but you can choose
to get in or stay out.

798
01:29:18,355 --> 01:29:20,559
I always choose to get laid.

799
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,439
Sex is one thing, love is another.

800
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:27,079
You shut up! You can't
tell a man from a woman...

801
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:32,030
Pants or skirts are the same for you
and you sound like a cloistered nun!

802
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:47,279
Remember when that Belgian
researcher came to work at the Center?

803
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:54,199
He came to dinner
a few times, Pierre.

804
01:29:54,200 --> 01:30:00,629
I remember him too,
two years ago, right?

805
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:07,317
I liked him, a lot.

806
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,879
I never caught that.

807
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:17,159
Neither did he, I never let it show.
He was always on my mind.

808
01:30:17,160 --> 01:30:25,193
After he left, I wrote him an e-mail, he
answered, asked me to meet him in Brussels.

809
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:32,319
I told you I had a cultural
exchange in Belgium, for two weeks.

810
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,599
But you didn't go.

811
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:41,679
No, I had you, Giulia, Marco...

812
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:47,199
Was it for the three of you? No. I couldn't
accept not being the perfect woman...

813
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:53,754
...who always does the right thing
and needs nothing else.

814
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,759
-How embarrassing!
-What's so embarrassing?

815
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,559
I shouldn't have told you,
it was a mistake.

816
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:12,594
Is there any real liquor in this
house? Vodka, gin, rat poison.

817
01:31:12,595 --> 01:31:17,635
For once, we agree!

818
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:34,197
Thank you for today.
For making them stay.

819
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:40,039
I was desperate,
I never could have done it alone.

820
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:43,679
- Are you still worried?
- Yes.

821
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:51,600
Davide's in his room, he's
sleeping, but I don't trust him.

822
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,639
It's been a while
since you had an...

823
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:00,085
An affair?

824
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:05,479
I've had lots,
but they come and go.

825
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:09,279
You've never
introduced us to anyone.

826
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:14,439
Trains are high-speed nowadays.

827
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:20,391
I'm too old to create
new love stories.

828
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:28,394
But if love hits me like a
sledgehammer, I'd take the beating.

829
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:34,273
Wouldn't you?

830
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:29,359
There are moments like this
when I feeI happy.

831
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:36,119
I don't know why, but seeing Davide
with our friends makes me feeI safe.

832
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:38,759
I know what's on their minds,
same thoughts, same words...

833
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:42,559
That's how I like it.

834
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:46,519
I don't want surprises
or sudden changes...

835
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:49,879
I want things to stay
as they are now, forever...

836
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:57,913
...even though I know
"forever" doesn't exist.

837
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:00,599
SATURN OPPOSITE

838
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:05,960
For the loving memory of
Flavio Merkel, forever.
