00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,900
What more can I do, there's nothing I haven't tried 

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Still it's so hard for her to notice 

4
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,600
I've tried hard to be straight 

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,800
There's nothing left I can say 

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If only she would look my way 

7
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,300
She don't know me (she don't know) 

8
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,200
She don't see me (she don't care)

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,000
She can't hear me (she can't hear) 

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
Can not help me (she don't want) 

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:15,000
She don't want me like I want her ( like I want her)

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,700
I've got to tell her ( got to tell her)

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,400
That I love her ( that I love her)

14
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,900
She doesn't even know my name 

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,000
I dream of when she'll be mine 

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,900
I dream of crossing that line 

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,000
And holding her so tender 

18
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Dreaming it could come true 

19
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,200
So many things I would do 

20
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,600
If only you'd give me a chance

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,800
She don't know me (she don't know) 

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,100
She don't see me (she don't care) 

23
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,000
She can't hear me (she can't hear) 

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,600
Can not help me (she don't want) 

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,200
She don't want me like I want her (like I want her)

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,700
I've got to tell her ( got to tell her)

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,700
That I love her

28
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,000
She doesn't even know my name

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,600
She don't know me ( she don't know)

30
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,500
She don't see me ( she don't care)

31
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,000
She can't hear me ( she can't hear)

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,800
Can not help me ( she don't want)

33
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,200
She don't want me ( like I want her) like I want her

34
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,800
I've got to tell her ( got to tell her)

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,900
That I love her

36
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,500
She don't know me ( she don't know)

37
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,800
She don't see me ( she don' know)

38
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,800
She can't hear me
