1
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:34,058
Simmer down, simmer down
They say we're too young now to amount to anything else

2
00:00:34,058 --> 00:00:39,486
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now

3
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:45,001
If you don't swim, you'll drown
But don't move, honey

4
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:50,793
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear

5
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:56,575
And I know now, that I'm so down

6
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:02,713
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart

7
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:08,681
And I know now, that I'm so down

8
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:27,887
Let's get out, let's get out
'Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down

9
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:35,560
While I was out, I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket

10
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,769
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?

11
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,948
'Cause all I really want is you

12
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:50,811
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear

13
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:56,726
And I know now, that I'm so down

14
00:01:56,726 --> 00:02:02,882
I made a mixtape straight out of '94
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor

15
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:08,387
And I know now, that I'm so down

16
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:26,844
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear

17
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:32,760
And I know now, that I'm so down

18
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,906
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart

19
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:44,328
And I know now, that I'm so down

20
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:02,734
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear

21
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:09,050
And I know now, that I'm so down (hey)

22
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:15,058
Your lipstick stain is a work of art (hey, hey)
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart (hey, hey)

23
00:03:15,058 --> 00:03:21,276
And I know now, that I'm so down (hey, hey)
