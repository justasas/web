1
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,003
Go, swim away! You're free now.

2
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:07,124
The two snake spirits

3
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:17,262
White snake is the elder, green snake
is younger.

4
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:28,440
They are always caring for
and helping each other.

5
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:45,260
It's so boring here as celestial beings.

6
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,997
And so lonely too.

7
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:58,806
Everday just drags on.

8
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:06,284
Everything remains the same here.

9
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:19,155
To be joyful one should go to
the mortal world.

10
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:25,729
It's certainly warmer there.

11
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:33,613
Seek fun in the mortal world.

12
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:40,810
Romance is sweet in the world of humans.

13
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:48,828
If you know the mortal world is fun,

14
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:54,389
...why not go there to live?

15
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:01,929
I'd sure like to.

16
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:11,143
But I fear the heavenly rules
and punishments.

17
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:17,318
Well, I've had enough here,

18
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:22,793
I'll take my chances.

19
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:30,825
I've decided to take a trip there.

20
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:38,810
Please take care of our home.

21
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:42,506
You treat me like your younger sister,

22
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,312
we go through everything together.

23
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:54,053
I will worry if you go alone.

24
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:03,728
Of course I too would like to go with you.

25
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:28,225
After Xu Xian paid his respects to
his ancestors,

26
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:37,134
...he took his time on the way home.

27
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:44,073
Gazing tirelessly West Lake's
picture-perfect scener.

28
00:05:47,246 --> 00:06:00,614
There, unexpectedly, he'd meet
a beauty by the shore.

29
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:26,847
Dear sister.

30
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:41,957
He's neither kith nor kin,

31
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:49,474
why are you so lost in thought over him?

32
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,976
We have just got here to the mortal world,

33
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:58,381
and you seem to be like, totally besotted!

34
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:09,184
It's true that we don't know him, but...

35
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:17,930
I remember him saving my life once
perhaps eons ago.

36
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,101
That's in his past life,

37
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,700
of course you wouldn't know.

38
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,179
Oh, so then he's your benefactor.

39
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,683
I have to pay my debt of gratitude.

40
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,277
I need to get to know him first,

41
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:41,520
...and I'll need your help.

42
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,475
Hey, look.

43
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,661
Boatman, would you go to Qingbo Gate?

44
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:55,529
Yes.

45
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:56,863
Hop on.

46
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,163
Please come closer.

47
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,471
Be careful.

48
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,050
Boatman.

49
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,474
Where are you heading to?

50
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,247
We're going to Qingbo Gate.

51
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,345
Could you take us?

52
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,651
Of course, this master is going that way.

53
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,125
Come on, you two.

54
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,751
Watch out!

55
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,293
It's slippery.

56
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,332
Mister.

57
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,502
My lady invites you to sit inside.

58
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,005
There's no room.

59
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,302
I don't want to cause you
any inconvenience.

60
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,820
Mister, since we are travelling together,

61
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,824
there's no such thing as inconvenience.

62
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,860
Please come in.

63
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,723
- Come on.
- Please stop pulling.

64
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,430
- It's fine.
- I'll come in.

65
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,429
- It's fine.
- Sure.

66
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,837
Let me hold the umbrella.

67
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,166
That's alright, thank you.

68
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,436
Please sit down.

69
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,242
Please.

70
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,081
Just sit down,

71
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,811
or my boat will rock over.

72
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,825
May we know your name, mister?

73
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,460
Xu Xian.

74
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,634
So it's Mr. Xu.

75
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:12,437
Yes.

76
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,435
Sorry to bother you.

77
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,471
Don't be so modest.

78
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,750
Boatman.

79
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,782
You can't take their money.

80
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,359
- I should pay.
- It's the same.

81
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,326
Give her money back, I'll pay you.

82
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,261
Let me pay...

83
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,959
It's the same.

84
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,563
You shouldn't have.

85
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,440
You're most welcome.

86
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:52,544
Qingqing.

87
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,372
We ought to move on,

88
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,644
looks like it might rain.

89
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:00,146
Is that so?

90
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:10,723
It's raining again.

91
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,795
It's quite heavy, what should we do?

92
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,839
Please take this umbrella, miss.

93
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,273
We can't... what about you?

94
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,367
It's fine, I live close by.

95
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,640
Thank you.

96
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,045
You're welcome.

97
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,208
Let's go, it's getting heavier.

98
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,722
Where do you live, mister?

99
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,318
I'll return the umbrella to you tomorrow.

100
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,158
Don't worry.

101
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,996
I'll pick it up from your residence
tomorrow.

102
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,932
Good idea.

103
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,334
Outside Qingbo Gate,
there's Qianwang Temple.

104
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,535
Beside it is a red door;
with character "Bai" on it.

105
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,441
That's my home.

106
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,216
I'll pay you a visit tomorrow.

107
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,527
Mister, you can get off too.

108
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,755
Alright.

109
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:17,788
Playing in the woods a thousand years ago,

110
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:27,595
I was held hostage by a naughty child.

111
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:37,100
Luckily my benefactor was there to help,

112
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:46,845
...or else I'd be beaten to death.

113
00:14:51,757 --> 00:15:00,131
I must repay this favour,

114
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:09,834
I'd like to marry him.

115
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,680
"Bai Residence"

116
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,820
Mr. Xu.

117
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,639
Mr. Xu, why are you leaving?

118
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,107
My lady worried that you can't find us,

119
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,114
she sent me here to welcome you.

120
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,308
Please come inside.

121
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,879
My lady has been expecting you.

122
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,193
Please have a seat, Mr. Xu.

123
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,445
Mr. Xu.

124
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,493
Please sit down, Mr. Xu.

125
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:53,366
After you, miss.

126
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,546
Are you busy at work?

127
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,919
Yes, I work in a shop.

128
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,585
We're busy all the year round.

129
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,865
The dishes are getting cold,
I'll check in the kitchen.

130
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,264
Please have another drink.

131
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,300
Please.

132
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,618
The wine's getting cold,
I'll fill this up.

133
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:41,617
Be seated, please.

134
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:45,648
No, I can't drink too much.

135
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,084
Don't worry, you won't get drunk.

136
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,133
Sister. Should I send him off?

137
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,166
Qingqing.

138
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,179
I must remind you,

139
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,380
although you're in love with Mr. Xu,

140
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,322
and we've checked his background out.

141
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:23,155
But still, you never know.

142
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,996
I request you to think it over.

143
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:33,631
Qingqing, I appreciate your concern.

144
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,900
But about Mr. Xu,

145
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,879
he's honest and sincere.

146
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,482
There's not a lie coming from him,

147
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,550
he's not like the others.

148
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,658
If you love him that much,

149
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:57,786
I'll talk to him.

150
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:23,087
You're dashing and polite,

151
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:31,755
young and good looking.

152
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:38,598
Your wife must be ver lucky, I'd say

153
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:46,839
She's fortunate to have a husband
like you.

154
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:54,081
My parents died when I was ver young,

155
00:20:54,186 --> 00:21:02,787
I work & live at my brother-in-law's
pharmacy.

156
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:09,663
I'm not married yet,

157
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:18,267
so how would there be a wife as you say?

158
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,709
One should get married on coming of age.

159
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,440
Say, even if not married
you should be engaged.

160
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,778
I have no assets and no abilities,

161
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:32,414
...how could I get engaged?

162
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,617
Okay, so you're not engaged now,

163
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,456
you don't plan to stay single forever,
do you?

164
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,826
No matter what,

165
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:46,268
you don't have to worry about me.

166
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:51,172
I don't think it's a good idea
to be single.

167
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:56,236
Let me be your matchmaker.

168
00:21:56,348 --> 00:22:01,081
There's a young spinster I know of;

169
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:07,716
She's prettier than the fairies.

170
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:12,627
Even if she is,

171
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:17,896
she certainly won't marry a poor man,
right?

172
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:22,633
But this young lady that I speak of...

173
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:29,112
she's marrying for love, not for money.

174
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:34,049
To fall in love it's got to be
predestined.

175
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:39,146
Otherwise it won't work.

176
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:43,717
If it's not meant to be,

177
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:50,393
how could she fall in love
at first sight?

178
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:55,166
She'd have to meet me first,

179
00:22:55,273 --> 00:23:01,405
before she could fall in love.

180
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,073
You've met her, and you've talked to her.

181
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,810
Please don't pretend to be a fool.

182
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,148
I've met and talked to her?

183
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,722
Are you teasing me?

184
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,223
Whom are you referring to?

185
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:19,730
My lady Miss Bai Suzhen.

186
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,732
I'm a junior worker in a pharmacy,

187
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,240
I am no match for your lady.

188
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:39,547
I'm from a poor family, I've no assets,

189
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:41,750
...how could I get married?

190
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,645
Haven't I told you?

191
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,245
She's not interested in betrothal money.

192
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,325
There's no need to worry.

193
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,417
I appreciate your kindness. I however,

194
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,962
must talk to my elder sister and
brother-in-law first.

195
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,156
Then I'll give you an answer.

196
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,126
What if your sister says no?

197
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,099
She would of course consider.

198
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,262
Wait a minute, I'll ask my lady
to come here,

199
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,771
...and you can have a talk.

200
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,341
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side.

201
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:46,543
In a pair, under the full moon.

202
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:50,553
Like a fish in the sea,

203
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:56,560
husband and wife will be together forever.

204
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:18,081
Ver much in love,

205
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,017
the couple is thrilled.

206
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,920
The hills and the willow trees
on the side,

207
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:32,122
...the little boat sails on.

208
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,940
My dear wife...

209
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:14,631
You're a rare gem, such a romantic.

210
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:24,307
You are willing to marry a poor man
like me.

211
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:33,290
I'm ashamed that I haven't achieved
my goals yet,

212
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:43,767
I feel bad not being able to
provide you a good life.

213
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:55,508
We're husband and wife now,
don't be so modest.

214
00:26:55,614 --> 00:27:06,855
I'm not marrying for money;

215
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:15,593
As long as our love can last forever,

216
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:26,076
...I can live a simple and poor life.

217
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:37,748
Even if you put vanity aside,

218
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:47,963
one would still need money to live
a simple life.

219
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:56,735
My income is limited,

220
00:27:56,841 --> 00:28:16,683
I reckon it will be difficult for us.

221
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:35,707
Don't worry,

222
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:43,914
I have it all planned out.

223
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:52,987
I have many relatives in Suzhou city.

224
00:28:53,665 --> 00:29:07,033
They'd all be willing to lend
a helping hand.

225
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:17,814
I've been practising medicine
since I was young, &...

226
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:26,591
I've been handed down a
'cure-all' prescription.

227
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:40,708
Let's move to Suzhou.

228
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:51,552
We'll open a clinic.

229
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:05,366
Xu Xian bid his sister goodbye
and moved away.

230
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,438
"Baohe Clinic"

231
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:18,145
Business at the new clinic is going well.

232
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,285
Bai Suzhen is a good doctor.

233
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:27,017
She can cure all.

234
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,492
She can even cure all kinds of
hopeless cases.

235
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:34,622
One dose of her prescription
will do the trick.

236
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:42,202
Their reputation has spread far and wide.

237
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:51,477
The clinic is often packed.

238
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,612
"Luzu Temple"

239
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,337
Incense sticks for sale...

240
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,205
I'll burn incense sticks under
my master's order.

241
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,873
I'm passing by, and it happens to be
Luzu's birthday.

242
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,747
That's why I'm here to meet and
greet new friends.

243
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,786
Charms, amulets for sale.

244
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,448
Guaranteed to keep off all troubles
and evil spirits.

245
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,991
Work like magic they do.

246
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:38,893
My name is Guo Wei,
I can summon wind and rain.

247
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,056
I know how to ward off evil spirits.

248
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,065
You are here to pay your respects to Luzu,

249
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,465
don't miss the chance to buy my charms.

250
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,365
Strange, I can feel some evil spirit.

251
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,985
It's you to flush the spookiness around!

252
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,685
Nonsense! We all know Mr. Xu.

253
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,888
Mr. Xu and his wife are life-savers;

254
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,328
Evil spirits? That's ridiculous.

255
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,626
Everone.

256
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,757
What evil spirits?

257
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,702
No one believes you.

258
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,535
He indeed has evil force around him.

259
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,269
And it's from someone close to him.

260
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,311
What rubbish!

261
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,407
Your wife is a monster.

262
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,482
That's sheer nonsense.

263
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:33,243
Tell me then, what kind of a monster
is she?

264
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,846
Speak up.

265
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,818
Where? Monster?

266
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:37,819
If you can't tell,

267
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,116
...I'll wreck your booth.

268
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,521
Wreck it!

269
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,990
I couldn't say what kind of
a monster she is,

270
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,690
but I'm certain that she's the one.

271
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,562
If you don't get rid of her,

272
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,828
your life is in grave danger.

273
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,597
Taoist priest, you are much older than me,

274
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,195
I'll let you get away this time.

275
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,732
I'd be a conman if I take your money.

276
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,944
Now, I'm giving you three charms for free.

277
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:05,072
Come here to thank me tomorrow.

278
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,083
He makes sense.

279
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,949
- What if she isn't?
- If she isn't...

280
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,180
What do you say?

281
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,722
Wreck his booth.

282
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:16,726
Fine! It's a deal.

283
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,760
Alright.

284
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:18,624
Alright.

285
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,130
Here you go.

286
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:25,498
Hide the first one in your hair,

287
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,901
then the devil wouldn't hurt you.

288
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,233
Place the second one above your door,

289
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,276
then she couldn't escape.

290
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:38,577
Burn the third one in front of her,

291
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,082
and her true identity...

292
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,545
will be revealed!

293
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:12,005
What a silly Taoist priest.

294
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:17,383
A third grade fortune-teller he is.

295
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:23,893
I've been a snake spirit for
a thousand years,

296
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:31,859
do you think I'll be scared of
your charms?

297
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:45,412
But my husband is confused,

298
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:52,615
I must try to lift his suspicion.

299
00:34:54,425 --> 00:35:07,532
I must solve this puzzle for him.

300
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,642
Are you alright, dear?

301
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,913
What do you want to tell me?

302
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:09,225
I met a Taoist priest at Luzu Temple.

303
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:14,390
He just kept insisting that
you're a monster;

304
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:22,037
Moreover, he has even given me 3 charms.

305
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:26,438
This is ridiculous!

306
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:28,870
Go on then, try it out!

307
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,107
See if it works.

308
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,705
What if it doesn't?

309
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,280
If it doesn't,

310
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,547
I'm going to wreck his booth tomorrow.

311
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:39,988
Go on then, try it out!

312
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,160
Go on.

313
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:58,671
I'm worried that you couldn't handle it...

314
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,744
So you believe what the
Taoist priest said?

315
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:02,710
You think that I'm some evil spirit.

316
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:07,682
If I burn this you will...

317
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,016
my true identity will be revealed.

318
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:10,312
Dear, it's just a scam,

319
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:15,183
You shouldn't listen to such gossip
from now on.

320
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,685
Especially not those conmen.

321
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:21,155
I won't listen to such nonsense anymore.

322
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,988
I'll go wreck his booth right now.

323
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:24,857
Dear.

324
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,460
Dear.

325
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,837
Where do you think you're going,
Taoist priest?

326
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:49,279
Do you think you can bully people

327
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,581
...with your voodoo?

328
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,549
Are you scared of me?

329
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:58,660
Taoist priest.

330
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:12,207
Miss Qing...

331
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,774
Please spare me...

332
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:43,970
Sister.

333
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:47,471
Are you alright?

334
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,758
Congratulations!

335
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,766
What is it, dear?

336
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,119
Dear.

337
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,196
Should I congratulate you or myself?

338
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,429
Congratulations!

339
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:56,836
Mr. Xu...

340
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:57,811
What is it?

341
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,780
Miss Qing, where is Mr. Xu?

342
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:00,584
What is it?

343
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,813
There's a monk outside
who wants to meet the master.

344
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,909
A monk.

345
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,614
What is it?

346
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,285
There's a monk here to see you.

347
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:10,792
Give him a donation and send him off.

348
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,193
He's not here for money or
for consultation.

349
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,355
He wants to see you;

350
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,956
Um... it seems rather important.

351
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:22,669
What does he want from me?

352
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:23,902
Strange.

353
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:37,385
Do you know who that monk is?

354
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,450
Monk Fahai of Golden Mountain Temple.

355
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,420
Master, are you looking for me?

356
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,230
You don't know me, but I know
you are Xu Xian.

357
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,203
Do you have advice for me, master?

358
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,905
This is not such a good place to talk;

359
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:00,874
There's an open space over the bridge,

360
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,536
...let's walk over there.

361
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,978
Only my family's here,
we can talk at ease.

362
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,481
This is kinda private,
we better talk over there.

363
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,350
After you.

364
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,304
Don't let anyone disturb us.

365
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:36,112
Yes.

366
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,750
I don't collect alms nor am I
connected to medicine.

367
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,517
But this is important,

368
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,355
I must warn you.

369
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,395
Please, master.

370
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,061
Listen well:

371
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:58,464
Your wife is a white snake spirit.

372
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,065
A white snake spirit?

373
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,930
Also,

374
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:06,908
her maid is a green snake spirit.

375
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,571
Both snakes could be tring to harm you.

376
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,513
I don't believe any of this!

377
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:13,674
I'm just a poor man,

378
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,274
why do they want to harm me?

379
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,445
They've done nothing but good deeds.

380
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:20,648
In fact people call my wife "Empress Bai".

381
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,890
Well, that's her bewitching charm.

382
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,756
The white snake spirit is ver powerful.

383
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,193
If you don't leave her,

384
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:28,093
...you might die.

385
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:29,392
You see, it was fate that brought us
together.

386
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,627
Follow me to Golden Mountain Temple
to become a monk.

387
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:34,226
That way, you can stay alive.

388
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,363
I don't aspire to be a monk.

389
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,442
Don't be so stubborn!
Trouble is upon you.

390
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,477
Thanks for your concern, master.

391
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,307
I don't believe they are snake spirits.

392
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,746
And I don't think they are tring to
harm me.

393
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,908
Most of all, I don't want to
become a monk.

394
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,509
Thank you.

395
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,757
So you still don't believe me.

396
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,961
No, last time I got tricked by

397
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,758
...some Taoist monk.

398
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,424
Guess I won't believe any of this again.

399
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,935
That Taoist monk must be incompetent.

400
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,664
Fine, if you don't believe me,

401
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,637
wait till the Dragon Boat Festival;

402
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,436
And you'll know it's all true.

403
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,642
Amitabha Buddha.

404
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:54,808
High noon sun on Dragon Boat Festival
is unbearable,

405
00:45:54,918 --> 00:46:03,690
Snakes and insects are in panic.

406
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,292
The realgar wine being naturally
ver potent,

407
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:12,425
Snakes & insects will keep at bay
or suffer from it.

408
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:20,170
Over here it's the festival preparations,

409
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:30,016
others are in panic.

410
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:41,926
The red sun shines brightly,

411
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:49,394
the scorching heat is unbearable.

412
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:52,942
It's almost noon;

413
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:56,911
you better hide, Qingqing!

414
00:46:57,014 --> 00:47:00,450
We'll go through...

415
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:05,250
bliss and misfortune together.

416
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:12,056
I can't leave you on your own.

417
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:16,895
I can't let you suffer all by yourself.

418
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:24,563
I'm more powerful,

419
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:28,509
I think I can handle it.

420
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:37,714
You better go,

421
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:53,761
don't waste anymore time.

422
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:09,308
I want to be here with you.

423
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,684
Qingqing.

424
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:15,847
Dear.

425
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:39,247
It's been so busy at work these days,

426
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:46,221
at least we have a day off today.

427
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:49,588
Have a cup of realgar wine,

428
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:53,060
let's celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival.

429
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:58,294
But I can't drink,

430
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:03,101
not at all.

431
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,704
Just have a sip,

432
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,211
you'll be fine.

433
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:13,408
I'm pregnant,

434
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:16,816
I can't take realgar.

435
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,117
That's actually good for you,

436
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:25,320
...you will be fine.

437
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,626
You should have a few drinks too,

438
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:33,601
it's refreshing and it detoxicates.

439
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:37,029
I... I can't drink.

440
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:41,903
Qingqing, watch out.

441
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:42,774
Yes.

442
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,508
Dear.

443
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,476
I told you I can't drink.

444
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,150
Just smell it.

445
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:25,016
No.

446
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,086
It smells so good.

447
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,327
Very well then, just one sip.

448
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:41,995
- Okay.
- No more.

449
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:42,867
No more.

450
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:47,739
Come on.

451
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,879
Are you alright, dear?

452
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:57,687
What's wrong?

453
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:05,792
I... I need to lie down.

454
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,693
Dear.

455
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,060
You look terrible.

456
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,360
Is it nausea?

457
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,398
I'm fine.

458
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,805
Don't come in,

459
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,875
I just need to lie down for a while.

460
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,387
My dear, I'm bringing you medicine.

461
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,652
Qingqing, my wife needs help.

462
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,589
Hurry!

463
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,322
Dear.

464
00:52:15,665 --> 00:52:16,563
Dear.

465
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,227
Take some medicine,

466
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,134
you'll feel better.

467
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,649
Sister.

468
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:44,475
Sister.

469
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,086
Master Xu was frightened to death by you.

470
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,950
Where is he?

471
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,755
My dear.

472
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:12,238
I wanted to repay you.

473
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:23,283
But I scared you to death

474
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:35,966
It's all because of Monk Fahai.

475
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:50,351
It's his fault.

476
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,618
He tried to alienate us.

477
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,553
I didn't want you to suspect,

478
00:54:54,658 --> 00:55:00,597
that's why I drank the wine unwillingly.

479
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:14,009
This is terrible.

480
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:23,850
Stop cring, don't be sad.

481
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:29,619
We must try to save him.

482
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:35,096
But he's dead.

483
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:43,298
What can bring him back to life?

484
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:51,604
Only the glossy ganoderma,

485
00:55:51,715 --> 00:56:01,113
yet it's on the summit of Kunlun Mountain.

486
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:07,697
Thank you for reminding me,

487
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:11,324
I'll go right away.

488
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:17,100
I know the danger I'll face,

489
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:25,307
but for my husband, I must go.

490
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:38,626
After I've got the ganoderma,

491
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:43,722
I'll come back right away.

492
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:49,066
If I'm not back within three days,

493
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:54,166
...it means that I'm dead.

494
00:56:54,277 --> 00:57:11,286
In that case, you must leave after
buring my husband.

495
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:30,577
Master Xu, my sister did this for you.

496
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:38,950
She might not live.

497
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,191
Qingqing.

498
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,294
Sister.

499
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:51,861
I'll be off then. Take care of him.

500
00:57:56,439 --> 00:58:02,503
Don't worry. You... just go.

501
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:08,973
Riding the clouds to Mount Kunlun.

502
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:15,422
All for the sake of her beloved.

503
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:21,691
Desperate to bring him back to life,

504
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:29,830
She'll beg for the venerable old man's
mercy.

505
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,239
How dare you pick-up the ganoderma?

506
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,182
Celestial spirits.

507
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:58,487
Please wait, let me explain.

508
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,022
You're a thief!
What more do you want to say?

509
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:26,472
Stop it...

510
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:30,478
Step back...

511
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:34,045
It's you, White Snake!

512
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:40,885
Please spare me, venerable old man.

513
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:50,931
I'm Bai Suzhen, the sinful.

514
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:59,407
I tried to steal the ganoderma to save
my husband.

515
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:08,372
I just hoped to repay him
for saving me in past life,

516
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:17,188
and now he's dead because of me.

517
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:25,758
After some thought,

518
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:35,971
I decided to risk by coming here.

519
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:49,555
Please have mercy on me;

520
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:58,363
Allow me to bring this
to the mortal world.

521
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:06,932
Trust me, I'm not tring to escape,

522
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:15,451
I don't expect to be spared.

523
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:28,688
I just want to bring my husband to life.

524
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:37,502
Then I'll return for my punishment.

525
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:45,514
I'm willing to die for this.

526
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:51,414
If you want to save your husband,

527
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,751
you should have told us first.

528
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:58,088
You've committed a theft,

529
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:01,857
it's hard to talk your way out.

530
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:06,058
She's pregnant,

531
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:11,367
and she didn't mean bad.

532
01:05:11,474 --> 01:05:14,637
I'll let her go this time,

533
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:20,205
but this won't be let off again.

534
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:23,615
Give the ganoderma to her,
White Crane, Yellow Deer.

535
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,346
Thank you!

536
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:41,962
After Bai Suzhen thanked the
venerable old man,

537
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:50,342
she left in gratitude.

538
01:05:50,446 --> 01:06:05,851
Heading back to the mortal world,

539
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:13,095
she is hurrying home.

540
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:04,718
My dear.

541
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:06,421
You...

542
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:10,592
My dear...

543
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:27,768
My dear.

544
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:30,309
What have you seen?

545
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:37,649
When I brought you the medicine,

546
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:40,813
I saw a big white snake on the bed,

547
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:42,254
...it was so scar.

548
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:46,556
I've killed the snake,

549
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,186
it's hanging on the tree.

550
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,099
Do you want to take a look?

551
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,189
No.

552
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:58,933
You better go,

553
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:02,204
I don't want you to conjure up
crazy stories, go on.

554
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:08,840
Are you still scared?

555
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:12,584
Don't worry,

556
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:14,616
I'll go with you.

557
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:17,487
Alright then, I'll go.

558
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,356
There, it's hanging on the tree.

559
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,418
Master Xu, look.

560
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:09,974
It's dead.

561
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:13,880
Master Xu.

562
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:15,982
Go back to the room to rest.

563
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:37,463
You're no monster,

564
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:45,912
that monk is full of nonsense.

565
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:53,513
Say, if I was really a monster,

566
01:09:53,622 --> 01:10:02,655
will you stop loving me?

567
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:11,901
What are you talking about?

568
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:19,072
We love each other.

569
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:26,383
I don't care if you were a monster.

570
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:35,590
Without affection, human is not
as good as a monster.

571
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:56,116
I'm glad to hear that.

572
01:10:56,218 --> 01:11:06,253
So you are true to me.

573
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:17,001
Let me tell you the truth now.

574
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:30,475
I'm indeed a snake spirit.

575
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:39,792
You've saved me in your past life,

576
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:48,428
I'm here to repay you.

577
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:57,845
I hoped we can grow old together.

578
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:05,375
That we'll forever live happily.

579
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:16,728
Then came the cold hearted monk Fahai;

580
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:24,830
he just wouldn't give up.

581
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:34,475
I don't want anyone to come between us.

582
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:42,251
I don't want anyone to be in the way.

583
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:51,232
Telling you the truth is my only option.

584
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:57,103
Don't worry.

585
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:00,937
We've been a couple for quite a while,

586
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:04,809
our love is real.

587
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:10,647
We don't need to worry.

588
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:18,159
It doesn't matter whether
you're human or a spirit,

589
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:28,135
nothing can come between us.

590
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:53,450
Master Xu.

591
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:56,720
Good day, master.

592
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,863
It's fate! Here we meet again.

593
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:04,394
Master.

594
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:06,169
You can't go back,

595
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,675
you will only be hurt by the monster.

596
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:11,837
Follow me to Golden Mountain Temple
to become a monk.

597
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,676
That's your only chance to be saved.

598
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:16,546
Even if my wife is a monster,

599
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,246
I'm not scared of her. She's nice to me.

600
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:21,879
She revealed her true form
on Dragon Boat Festival,

601
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,048
...and you were scared to death.

602
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,053
I'm here to save you.

603
01:14:26,161 --> 01:14:27,492
Okay, so I was scared to death on
Dragon Boat Festival

604
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:28,722
...where were you?
You weren't there to save me.

605
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:30,890
Instead, my wife risked her life

606
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,297
and brought the ganoderma
in order to restore my life.

607
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:41,499
That's because I knew it wasn't
your time to go yet,

608
01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:42,702
...that's why I wasn't there.

609
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:44,511
Let's not talk about this.

610
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:46,808
Follow me to Golden Mountain Temple
to become a monk.

611
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,007
I don't want to be a monk.

612
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:58,790
Please let me go home.

613
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:00,521
I've no business with the Buddhist Temple.

614
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:02,654
Please let me go home.

615
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:03,696
Please leave me alone.

616
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:07,929
Master...

617
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,965
You're so stubborn. Where's Fashan?

618
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:13,536
- Here, master.
- Master.

619
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,805
Bring him back.

620
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:18,539
I don't want to go.

621
01:15:18,647 --> 01:15:19,875
I don't want to be a monk.

622
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:32,124
My dear wife, help me!

623
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:42,667
Help me!

624
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,788
Did you hear, sister?

625
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,161
Qingqing, he kidnapped my husband.

626
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:09,355
Hateful monk Fahai!

627
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:10,863
We haven't done anything wrong
to deserve this.

628
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:13,434
Qingqing, we must hurry to
the Golden Mountain Temple.

629
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:30,712
Be careful, Qingqing.

630
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:35,051
Monk Fahai is ver powerful.

631
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:35,857
I know.

632
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:46,992
"Golden Mountain Temple"

633
01:16:50,973 --> 01:16:54,409
Master, please let my husband go.

634
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:31,244
You're a snake spirit yet

635
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:34,042
It's an offence on your part
coming to mortal world.

636
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:36,982
You better turn around while you can,

637
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:40,213
...or you will be punished.

638
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:50,130
Xu Xian was once my savior,

639
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:57,434
I made it up to him by marrying.

640
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:02,169
Please be kind,

641
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:09,149
and let my husband go.

642
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:12,015
How dare you talk about
your personal life?

643
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,112
This is a Buddhist temple.

644
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:18,124
If I hand Xu Xian over,

645
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:21,525
you will turn him into a monster too.

646
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:25,566
We haven't harmed anyone,

647
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:29,967
what's wrong with me looking for
my husband here?

648
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:33,803
And tell me what's your grudge,

649
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:38,505
why are you separating me from my husband?

650
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:49,146
You're a high rank Buddhist monk,

651
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:59,792
you should be kind to
all living creatures.

652
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:08,570
Please don't go over the top,

653
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:19,246
you should be more forgiving.

654
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:22,348
I won't be duped by you,

655
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:25,255
there's no use for the pretty speech.

656
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,057
Unless you move Yangtze River up here
on the mountain,

657
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:32,895
...you won't see your husband.

658
01:19:51,653 --> 01:19:56,420
He is unreasonable,

659
01:19:56,525 --> 01:20:02,259
mean and arrogant.

660
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:08,826
Fine, let's do what he wants.

661
01:20:14,676 --> 01:20:21,081
We'll move Yangtze River here.

662
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:26,511
Then he'll let Xu Xian go.

663
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:21,667
Amitabha Buddha.

664
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:14,290
Let me go!

665
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:22,325
Sister.

666
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:26,533
Are you alright?

667
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:29,944
It hurts.

668
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:32,673
I think it's time to give birth.

669
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:33,645
What should we do?

670
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:36,216
We're so close to winning.

671
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:41,678
Qingqing, I can't hold up anymore.

672
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:43,317
Sister.

673
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:46,218
We can't stop now,

674
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:47,727
or the water will flow back down,

675
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:49,626
...and we'll drown.

676
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:54,998
The water!

677
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:59,972
Let's go!

678
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,408
Come on.

679
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:13,910
Hurry.

680
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:29,565
Sister.

681
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:32,364
My dear.

682
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:33,174
Xu Xian.

683
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:42,249
And you are?

684
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:54,626
Venerable old man.

685
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:57,057
Please help me.

686
01:23:57,165 --> 01:23:58,928
Save my wife.

687
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:02,970
Bai Suzhen has failed in her attempt.

688
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:05,334
Where's my wife?

689
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,876
She's hidden in the woods.

690
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:10,638
I'll show you the way.

691
01:24:10,745 --> 01:24:13,111
I'll let you two see each other.

692
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,772
Thank you, master.

693
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:16,180
Close your eyes.

694
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:16,984
Yes.

695
01:24:21,222 --> 01:24:22,246
Qingqing.

696
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:26,259
Sister.

697
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:35,329
My dear...

698
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:36,961
Listen, Qingqing.

699
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:42,837
My dear.

700
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:44,536
My husband is here.

701
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:48,416
Dear wife...

702
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:49,216
My dear.

703
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:51,417
My beloved!

704
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:53,643
Dear wife...

705
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:54,653
My dear husband.

706
01:24:55,557 --> 01:24:57,422
Dear wife...

707
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:59,925
My dear husband...

708
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:01,626
Dear wife...

709
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,931
- My beloved!
- Dear wife... you...

710
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:17,704
How did you escape?

711
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:20,280
The venerable old man saved me.

712
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:24,711
Sweetheart.

713
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,045
Thank you, venerable old man.

714
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:29,182
Hurry, sister.

715
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,587
You better hurry.

716
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:39,866
Are you alright?

717
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:42,126
It's all because of you.

718
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,135
Qingqing.

719
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:44,905
I cannot believe you.

720
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:47,304
My sister has suffered all because of you.

721
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:52,070
Think it over, Xu Xian.

722
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:59,177
We've risked everything for you.

723
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,487
Sister.

724
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:04,820
Dear wife...

725
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:05,790
Move away.

726
01:26:08,396 --> 01:26:11,422
Sister...

727
01:26:11,533 --> 01:26:13,330
Qingqing...

728
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:17,271
Sister...

729
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:19,465
Dear wife...

730
01:26:19,574 --> 01:26:20,541
Don't come any closer.

731
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:21,540
A bit further.

732
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:23,474
A little bit more.

733
01:26:23,778 --> 01:26:25,006
Turn your head.

734
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,012
Qingqing.

735
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:36,346
Sister...

736
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:41,186
Qingqing.

737
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,426
Sister.

738
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:59,242
Dear...

739
01:27:03,518 --> 01:27:09,354
My dear wife...

740
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:13,158
Dear.

741
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:17,527
Sister, you have a bonny boy!

742
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:24,969
My dear, you've borne enough hardships...

743
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:29,533
I want to look at my son.

744
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:18,789
Fahai is here, take the baby.

745
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:20,326
Honey.
Hurry and leave.

746
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:22,089
We'll go through this together,

747
01:28:22,196 --> 01:28:24,528
Let's go!

748
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:25,997
You better leave, dear.

749
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,761
No.
I don't think I can go anywhere.

750
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:28,927
No.

751
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:31,505
Qingqing, you...

752
01:28:34,075 --> 01:28:37,533
Take him to Hangzhou,

753
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:41,274
ask my aunt to take care of him.

754
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:46,820
And I'll have an heir,

755
01:28:46,921 --> 01:28:50,687
also someone to revenge for me.

756
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:54,694
Listen to me, go now!

757
01:28:54,796 --> 01:29:06,697
Or you won't be able to make it.

758
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:14,080
Sister.

759
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:16,974
Leave, Qingqing.

760
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:39,601
Qingqing.

761
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:10,270
For your own personal grudge
you stirred up trouble.

762
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:13,306
By drowning Golden Mountain
you tried to harm others.

763
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:16,275
You've done the worst crime,

764
01:30:16,377 --> 01:30:19,141
what do you have to say now?

765
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:22,415
Why did I do that for?

766
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:25,645
Who's really behind this?

767
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:28,745
I've done serious damage,

768
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:31,825
but you should share the punishment
with me.

769
01:30:31,926 --> 01:30:34,793
You're a real snake spirit.

770
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:37,660
Still tring to bite at your time
of death.

771
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:41,292
I'm generous enough to let you live,

772
01:30:41,402 --> 01:30:44,337
so you can live the rest of life
in an earthen bowl.

773
01:30:54,215 --> 01:31:01,553
She's just given birth.

774
01:31:01,656 --> 01:31:09,256
Have mercy on her.

775
01:31:09,363 --> 01:31:13,993
Let her go!

776
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:22,133
We'll forever be grateful.

777
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:23,904
She's nothing but a pest.

778
01:31:24,011 --> 01:31:25,638
Why won't you give up?

779
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:27,077
You refuse to come to your senses,

780
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:30,173
...do you really wish to die?

781
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:34,720
You have no conscience.

782
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:38,815
You're the pest.

783
01:31:38,926 --> 01:31:42,123
I'm not scared of death.

784
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:48,169
I'll fight you.

785
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,800
Dear...

786
01:31:53,608 --> 01:32:00,207
Dear...

787
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:02,441
Snake Spirit, you aren't going anywhere.

788
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:16,789
Amitabha Buddha.

789
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:41,515
My dear...

790
01:33:22,196 --> 01:33:39,103
My dear...

791
01:33:49,857 --> 01:33:58,526
Dear wife...

792
01:33:59,066 --> 01:34:05,437
My dear...

793
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:14,379
Leaping out from a foggy cloud of
miserable gloom...

794
01:34:16,517 --> 01:34:24,617
They soared into a sunny day
with gentle breeze.

795
01:34:24,725 --> 01:34:35,624
In a different world of emotions.

796
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:40,400
We'll never be apart.

797
01:34:41,075 --> 01:34:51,781
Never again shall we be apart.
