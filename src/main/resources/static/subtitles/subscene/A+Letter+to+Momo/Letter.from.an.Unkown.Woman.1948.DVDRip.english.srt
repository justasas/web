1
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,595
Then... You've made up your mind?

2
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,765
You are going through with it?

3
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,224
Why not?

4
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,800
For one thing, he's an excellent champ.

5
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,502
At least try to get some sleep.

6
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,230
If I were you, no more Congnac.

7
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,433
We'll come for you at five.
It'd give you three hours.

8
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,134
You will be here.

9
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,712
I don't mind so much to being killed.

10
00:01:56,082 --> 00:02:00,746
But you know how it is for
me to get up in the morning.

11
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:01,485
Good night.

12
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,656
Good night.

13
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:12,998
I'm afraid this time, Stephan has picked
a fight with the wrong man

14
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,330
I wonder if he'll be here
when we come back?

15
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,334
Who is it?

16
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,301
Brown.

17
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,477
Good morning, Mr. Brown.

18
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,187
Cheer up, John.

19
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,591
This is one engagement
that I have no intention of keeping.

20
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:48,289
Honor is a luxury.
Only gentleman can afford.

21
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,059
Pack my things...

22
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,004
Whatever you think
that I'll need for a indefinite stay.

23
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,177
I have a cab downstairs...

24
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:03,041
In about an hour,
I'll go out the back way.

25
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:09,188
I'm sorry.
I won't be here to see their faces.

26
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:17,126
Has this come during the night?

27
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:23,269
Would you bring me
some coffee... with Congnac?

28
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:32,704
"By the time you read this letter,
I may be dead."

29
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:37,532
"I have so much to tell you,
perhaps very little time."

30
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,336
"Will I ever send it?"

31
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,515
"I don't know."

32
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:49,647
"I must find strength to write
before it's too late."

33
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:54,551
"And as I write, it became clear
that what happened to us"

34
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:59,255
"...had its own reason beyond
our poor understanding."

35
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,023
"If this reaches you..."

36
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,098
"You'll know how I became yours..."

37
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:08,138
"When you didn't know who I was,
or even that I existed."

38
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:13,278
"I think everyone has two birthdays.
Day of his physical bir

39
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:16,949
"And the beginning
of his conscious life."

40
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,482
"Nothing is vivid...
or really my name."

41
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,517
"Before that day in Spring..."

42
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,686
"When I came home from school,"

43
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:29,028
"And found a moving
van in front of our building."

44
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,241
"I wander about in our new neighbor..."

45
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,713
"Who owned such beautiful things."

46
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,610
Lisa! Come in, Lisa!

47
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,655
Come in this minute, did you hear?

48
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,322
Lisa!

49
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,495
Yes, mother.

50
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,326
Who is going to play that dock?

51
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,693
Me. I suppose.

52
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:13,004
I have nothing to do.

53
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,072
You better get another rope.

54
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:15,740
Uh?

55
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,303
You better get another rope.

56
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,705
Alright!

57
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,637
Get another rope!

58
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,982
This is the last time I move a musician.

59
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:30,156
Why does he have to play the paino?

60
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,730
Where do these go?

61
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,066
What?

62
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,672
In the study.

63
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,170
Thank you.

64
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,507
Lisa, what are you doing out there?

65
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,684
Come inside.

66
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:18,102
"I didn't see you that day,
or from many days that day after

67
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:24,276
"But I could listen to your playing."

68
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,763
I wish he stop that noise.

69
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,073
What noise?

70
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:59,472
Don't bite my head off.
Mr. Brown is playing.

71
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,236
You called that playing?

72
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,381
Shh...

73
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,950
How old is he?

74
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,424
Who?

75
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:19,598
Him!

76
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,691
Quite old, I guess.

77
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,059
Oh.

78
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,635
You know the boy
I was talking to outside the school?

79
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,464
The bony one with the yellow
hair and a long nose.

80
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,974
One who lives next to the grocery.

81
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,544
I'm gonna do something about it...

82
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:38,683
If he dosen't keep his hands to himself.

83
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:44,387
The things he does,
Right out in the street

84
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:28,732
Thank you, John.
I'll be home later.

85
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,079
Thank you.

86
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,582
Good morning.

87
00:09:55,294 --> 00:10:01,130
Why, Lisa! You're all red in the face.

88
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,564
You're bulshing!

89
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,203
I'll get you for that!

90
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,430
"Yes, I was blushing."

91
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,337
"And hard as it
may be for you to realize..."

92
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:16,072
"From that moment on,
I was in love with you."

93
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,718
"Quite consciously,
I was preparing myself for you."

94
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:24,716
"I kept my clothes neater,
so you wouldn't be ashamed of me."

95
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,752
Bow, two three four...

96
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,753
"I went to dancing school."

97
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:34,725
"I wanted to become more graceful,
and learn good manners for

98
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:39,401
Bow... two three, and one two three...

99
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:43,541
And one two three...

100
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,806
"So I would know more about you,
and your world..."

101
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,409
"I went to the library...

102
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:56,589
"And study the lives
of great musicians of the past."

103
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,668
"Though I was not able to
go to your concerts,"

104
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:16,976
"I found ways of sharing in
your success."

105
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:31,149
"As months went by,
I began to know your friends."

106
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:37,296
"Many of them are women. Most of them."

107
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,765
Lisa!

108
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,335
Lisa!

109
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,474
Where are you, Lisa?

110
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:58,217
Aren't you going to finish your dinner?

111
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,582
Sorry, mother.

112
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:11,462
"But I really lived for
those evenings when you're alone."

113
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:17,603
"And I pretended
that you're playing just for me."

114
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,751
"I know you didn't know it..."

115
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,059
"You're giving me some
of the happiest hours of my life."

116
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,000
"Then came a great day for me."

117
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,972
"In the building where we lived."

118
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:11,150
"Thursday was rug-beating day."

119
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:17,750
Come on, let's help him!

120
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,522
Oh! I've got to do my own.

121
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:27,257
I'll do it for you afterwards.
Come on!

122
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,435
Remember what you've promised!

123
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,571
I will.

124
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,044
Beautiful rug.

125
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,271
It's a beautiful rug, isn't it?

126
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,607
Oh, it's just a rug.

127
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:47,752
Oh, you wouldn't know.

128
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,050
Say, what are we doing this for?

129
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,518
Shh! He will hear you.

130
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,158
Oh, he can't talk.

131
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,196
Well, he can hear, can't he?

132
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,369
You're welcome.

133
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,700
Come on, Lisa.

134
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:10,973
I'll be right down.

135
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,200
What are you going to do?

136
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,673
Go away, I'll be right down.

137
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:14,978
What are you going to do?

138
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:18,741
Go away, or I'll throw you downstairs.

139
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,053
Are you crazy?

140
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,383
Lisa!

141
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,250
What are you doing up there?

142
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,585
Come dear, I've something to tell you.

143
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:45,259
It's really good news.

144
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:52,666
If you think about it sensibly,
you'll be very happy.

145
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,007
Sit down.

146
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,345
I can understand
that you must've been startled...

147
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,216
When you saw
her customer and me in the hall.

148
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:17,259
Perhaps it's my fault for not telling
you something about it

149
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:21,456
You see, dear,
your mother is not really old.

150
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:22,725
She can have admirers, too.

151
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:28,165
She can even be in love with a man.

152
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:32,673
Someday you'll understand
better what I means.

153
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:33,534
Besides...

154
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,181
You know how hard it is for us to
get along on that small pe

155
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,407
That guy has a comfortable business.

156
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,712
It links... a military tailor.

157
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:49,027
And he's down here
to ask me to marry him.

158
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,522
Besides, he is a kind man,
and he likes you very much.

159
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,326
I'm sure with his help,
it'll be much easier for you to...

160
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,060
Mother!

161
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,101
What is it?

162
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,601
But we have to go to Lance?

163
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,703
We have to live there?

164
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:05,168
But why not?

165
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,639
What is there to keep us here?

166
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,138
I won't go!

167
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:08,937
I won't go!

168
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,512
Lisa!

169
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,206
What's the matter?

170
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,078
But... what is it?

171
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,150
Lisa!

172
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,252
I won't go.

173
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,717
I won't go.

174
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,150
Now Lisa!
Do be reasonable and tell your mother.

175
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,224
I won't! I won't!

176
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,396
Lisa!

177
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,464
That will do with our ocean part liner.

178
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,296
Let see...
We've eleven altogether.

179
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:37,737
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.
Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven.

180
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,042
It comes, Dear.

181
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,575
Don't worry, dear.
I'll take care of everything.

182
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:44,010
The adjustment promised the trunk
said that...

183
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,946
Oh, either I'd lost half a minute...
or the station parted ear

184
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,552
How much would that be, please?

185
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:50,311
It's up to you, sir.

186
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,217
Up to me?

187
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,448
One dollar should be enough.

188
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,525
The guy promised the trunk
would be here on time.

189
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,717
With all the boxes...

190
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:01,156
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.

191
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:06,030
Uh... how long will it take
if we send them through the third

192
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:06,761
Two weeks, maybe.

193
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:08,606
Two weeks... very good.

194
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,332
Now each of these... second class.

195
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,635
Third class...

196
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,569
Each of these... third class.

197
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,508
Yes...

198
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,376
Ah... what did I tell you.

199
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,245
When you're going to a thing,
do it one time

200
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,747
That is always nice.

201
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,745
Hello. Thank you.

202
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,110
You can unloaded it here.

203
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,688
Our train doesn't leave until 12:00.

204
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,990
Yes,12:00,darling.

205
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,161
The twelve!

206
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,391
Please don't get excited, dear

207
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,536
I'd be calm.

208
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,368
"Suddenly I knew
I couldn't live without you."

209
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,477
"I didn't know what I had in mind, or..."

210
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,706
"...what my parents would do
when they found me missing."

211
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,315
"All I wanted was to see you once more."

212
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,282
"To be near you again."

213
00:20:56,488 --> 00:21:00,652
"To throw myself at your feet,
cling to you, and never leave you."

214
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:06,965
"Nothing else. Nothing else matters."

215
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,532
Alright, alright.

216
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:15,707
Oh, it's you, Lisa.

217
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,566
I thought now
that you're half way to Linze?

218
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,575
Didn't your train leave in about...

219
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,716
I forgot something.

220
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:54,502
"These rooms where I've lived,
have been filled with your music."

221
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,197
"Now they were empty."

222
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,536
"Would they ever come to life again?"

223
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,372
"Would I?"

224
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,571
"Only you could answer."

225
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,216
"So, I waited."

226
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,386
"Waited..."

227
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:13,121
"For what seemed endless hours
I set outside your door..."

228
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,384
"Try to keep myself awake."

229
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,324
"...afraid that
I might fall asleep and miss you."

230
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,499
"Then..."

231
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,461
Who is it?

232
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,228
Brown!

233
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:32,376
Good morning, Mr. Brown.

234
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:17,019
"And so, there was nothing left for me."

235
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:21,158
"I went to Linze."

236
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,626
"You who have always lived so freely..."

237
00:24:30,001 --> 00:24:35,200
"Have you any idea
what life's like as a little garrison in

238
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:37,102
"I was eighteen now..."

239
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:42,144
"And was expected to take
my place in society."

240
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,009
Come now, Lisa.
Don't look down at your feet.

241
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,310
Please be tactful and
let him do the talking.

242
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,080
But not all the talking.
Do you hear me, Lisa?

243
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,347
Good morning, Colonel.

244
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,492
Good morning, Colonel.

245
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,629
Good morning.

246
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,326
Mrs. Castler, Miss Castler.
Mr. Castler.

247
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,729
May I have the honor to
present you my nephew...

248
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,072
Leitenent Leonard Oncathelic...

249
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,298
I have the honor to kiss your hand.

250
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,737
Very pleased to make your acquaintance.

251
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:12,735
Thank you, Lieutenant.

252
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,545
Mr. Castler, I have the honor, sir.

253
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:16,941
I'm very pleased to make
your acquaintance.

254
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,638
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

255
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,076
Allow me to present our daughter, Lisa.

256
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:25,222
Lieutenant Leonard.

257
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,133
Good morning...

258
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:41,538
Excuse me.

259
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,676
Do you like it here in Lance?

260
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,570
Quiet well.

261
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,750
It must seemed
very restfull living in Vienna?

262
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,676
I like Vienna.

263
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,078
Indeed.

264
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:01,691
What did you like about it?

265
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,288
Perhaps you were found of the music?

266
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,463
Yes.

267
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,030
We also have good music here.

268
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,930
Every other Saturday afternoon
they gave a concert on the co

269
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:13,536
Oh, really?

270
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,571
Perhaps someday you'll allow
me the honor to escorting you?

271
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,538
Very nice of you.

272
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,268
When there was a good chance,
I'd take part of it myself.

273
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,241
I played second trumpet.

274
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,641
Oh, how nice.

275
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,540
I must say I'm glad that you like music.

276
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,240
You see...

277
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:33,391
There's nothing wrong
with her if she meets the right people

278
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:44,023
Up! Up! Up! Up!

279
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,204
Up! Up! Up!

280
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:51,602
"The Lieutenant was right."

281
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,778
"Linze was a musical town."

282
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:56,306
"So twice a month
that's what I listened..."

283
00:26:56,514 --> 00:27:01,349
"The Lieutenant and I."

284
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,178
Before the afternoon is over,
I'm sure we'll hear an announc

285
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,353
Nothing could please us more, Colonel.

286
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:40,490
Is that right, my dear?

287
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,427
Miss Lisa, this is a subject
which I wish to bring up for so

288
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:51,466
I trust you'd forgive me to
presume the action that I allow

289
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,638
It maybe unnecessary to mention that...

290
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,267
Eversince you first came
to my attention,

291
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,168
I've been most favorably impressed.

292
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,034
Thank you.

293
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,301
And I believe
that your parents are not opposed...

294
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,572
...my keeping company
that is dedicate with you.

295
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:04,471
But, Lieutenant, I...

296
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,584
Oh, please allow me to finish.

297
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,546
As far as my prospects are concerned,
You must be aware that...

298
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,689
It's generally pleased
by my uncle and others,

299
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,651
That I have a qualifications
for an ourstanding military car

300
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:16,925
It's no doubt of that.

301
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,460
Naturally, it's too soon to
discuss a definite step.

302
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,154
We should know each other
for a reasonable time...

303
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:21,661
But, Lieutenant...

304
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,500
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

305
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,000
It's impossible?

306
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,296
Please allow me to explain.

307
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,940
I must insist.
Is there someone else?

308
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,302
Yes.

309
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,636
I'm engaged to be married.

310
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,377
Engaged to be married?

311
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,377
I should've told you before,
But I didn't realize that how...

312
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:38,571
But all the time you've been in Linze,

313
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:39,977
I haven't seen anyone's company.

314
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,618
He doesn't live in Linza.
He lives in Vienna.

315
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:42,953
In Vienna?

316
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,452
He... he likes music, he's a musician.

317
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:46,715
But how can that be?

318
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,117
Your mother and father,
they gave my uncle the encouragement...

319
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,692
They don't know yet!

320
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,964
You're engaged to a man,
and your parents don't even know it?

321
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,258
Um...

322
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,904
I'm sorry, I...

323
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,972
Then, please.

324
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:11,416
Waiter, the wine. The wine.

325
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,927
Up! Up!

326
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,210
But I don't understand.

327
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,616
Lisa, sit down. What happened?

328
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,251
Nothing.

329
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,047
But after all...

330
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,452
But you must've said something.

331
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:55,387
What did you say to him?

332
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,288
I only told him the truth.

333
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,622
The truth! What do you mean the truth?

334
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,329
What did you say to him?

335
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,764
I told him, I wasn't free.

336
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:05,966
What...?

337
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:09,368
"My poor parents,
for them this was the end."

338
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:15,513
"For me, it was a new beginning."

339
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,379
"Vienna, when I saw her again,"

340
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,245
"Seemed to have taken
on a new splendor."

341
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,454
"All the time I've been away,"

342
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,316
"I thought longingly, it's your city."

343
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,618
"Now, it's our city."

344
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,160
"Madam Spitt's where I found work."

345
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,799
"It's the kind of establishment
where one learns many things

346
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,566
Miss Lisa, please.

347
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,738
Coming.

348
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,715
Hold your breath.

349
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:58,022
Miss Lisa, we're waithing.

350
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:08,330
Very pretty.

351
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,694
Yes.

352
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,038
Very.

353
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:41,164
Very charming. Very charming, indeed.

354
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,093
Do you think...

355
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,167
She is not like the others,
I don't understand that girl...

356
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,337
But every evening,

357
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:50,405
As soon as this shop are closes,
off she goes straight home.

358
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,543
Really?

359
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,282
"Madam Spitt spoke the truth."

360
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,712
"I was not like the others."

361
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,681
"Nobody waited for me."

362
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,753
"Off I went, not home..."

363
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:13,564
"But to the only place
that it ever seemed home to me."

364
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:18,429
"Night after night,
I returned to the same spot."

365
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:24,575
"You never noticed me...
until one evening."

366
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:42,017
I've seen you before, few nights ago.

367
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,678
Right here. Or... your live near here?

368
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:49,026
No.

369
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,695
You like to listen to the street singers?

370
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,257
Um... yes.

371
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:56,399
Neither do I.

372
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:00,601
I should introduce myself.

373
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:05,739
No. I know who you are.

374
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:18,313
I suppose sooner or later,
we have to decide where we're walk

375
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,151
I have something I should call off.

376
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,298
I'd never get to the place
where I start out for, anyway.

377
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,070
Pardon.

378
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,570
Excuse me.

379
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,037
Very charming.

380
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:12,709
Thank you.

381
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,635
Anything else I can do for you,
Mr. Brwon?

382
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:16,001
Will you please tell Mr. Bowlish,

383
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:19,081
I won't be at the rehearsal this evening.

384
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,012
Congratulations.

385
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,380
Bruce, is that gentleman free now?

386
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:24,350
Just moment, sir.

387
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,523
Don't you see I'm busy with Mr. Brown?

388
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:30,990
Now... how about Lady Lilian?

389
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,958
If she comes,
how am I going to tell her?

390
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,392
Well, tell her...

391
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,228
I'll tell her... It was most important
and you had to work.

392
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,368
Yes, that's it. That's fine.

393
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,366
I'm sure she will understand.

394
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:41,037
I'm sure.

395
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:41,568
Thank you.

396
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,364
Bye.

397
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:47,237
Stephen, I missed you yesterday.
I have to talk to you.

398
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,070
Later.

399
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,713
I saw the manager group at the conchter.
It's a young man I met...

400
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,779
His father owns half the colege to

401
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,486
I thought it was something
for one of your concerts.

402
00:35:58,689 --> 00:35:59,621
If you just go outside...

403
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:00,950
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

404
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,128
Tomorrow...

405
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:21,703
Now, don't be frighten.

406
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,947
If it's not to becoming,
the lobster would have no intention.

407
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,175
I was wrong. It is becoming.

408
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:31,549
Let see,
when do they have lobster again?

409
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,417
Friday. How about Friday?

410
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,387
A week is a long time.

411
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,959
How about Wednesday.
That's pheasant.

412
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,629
They have pheasant on Monday.

413
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,521
Could you possibly make it on Monday?

414
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,257
I've no engagement at all.

415
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:47,699
I've none, either.
We'll have dinner tomorrow night.

416
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,131
Dinner, that's all

417
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,707
Excuse me, Mr. Brown.
The lady in the next room,

418
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,010
If I'm not mistaken,
is The Countess Newesky.

419
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:58,740
Would you sign her the program
of this afternoon's concert?

420
00:36:59,116 --> 00:36:59,980
Certainly.

421
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:03,086
She said, Mozart
himself could not have done better.

422
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,152
How nice of her.

423
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,050
There you are.

424
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:07,349
Thank the Countess for the compliment.

425
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,354
Thank you. Haybra.

426
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,527
The note is not the least she deserves.

427
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,923
Four years ago
when you played the D Minor.

428
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,119
You remember that?

429
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,265
The morning review, also.

430
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,491
Compare too young Mozart.

431
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:21,638
I was very young.

432
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,010
You like it?

433
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,240
Mar Poly Charli, it's called.

434
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:33,110
First thing you see
when you come down the other side of the

435
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:35,581
The Italians say,
it is such a good wine,

436
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,683
Because the grapes have
their roots in the vine,

437
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,320
And the eyes on the mountains.

438
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:42,253
Please...

439
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,451
Please what?

440
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,563
Please talk about yourself.

441
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:52,168
I believe you really want to hear about it.
Why?

442
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,531
Uh, never mind why.

443
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,606
The truth is,
I had rather an easy time of it.

444
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,972
People accepted my music very quickly.

445
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,340
Perhaps too quickly.

446
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:09,212
Sometimes it seemed easier
to please others than oneself.

447
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,320
What're you going to say?

448
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,183
You know you don't talk very much.

449
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,518
Well... I can't say very well. But...

450
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,250
Yes.

451
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,055
Sometimes,
I felt when you're playing that...

452
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,164
Go on.

453
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:28,305
That... your haven't quite found
what you're looking for.

454
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,235
How long have you
been hiding in my paino?

455
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,412
Uh, never mind explaining.

456
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:38,173
I just assume you're a sorcerous,

457
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:42,284
And that
you can make yourself very tiny.

458
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,751
It might be a good thing
to have a sorcerous friend.

459
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,990
Who knows?

460
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:55,132
You maybe able to help me someday.

461
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,302
How could I help you?

462
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,670
So, that's what you've been thinking?

463
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,376
You're a very stange girl.

464
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,947
Who ever you are,
where ever you came from...

465
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,242
Don't you have any problem?

466
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:18,388
Not... important ones.

467
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:27,923
It's been a long
while since anyone did that for me?

468
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,029
Stop here, please.

469
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:32,168
Woo... Ah.

470
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,537
Good evening, Mr. Brown.

471
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,403
Good evening.

472
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,042
Roses?

473
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,211
Yes. Please.

474
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:42,002
Nice red ones?

475
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:48,948
No. Red is the wrong color.
I think the white one would be perfect

476
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,621
This is a special occassion.

477
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:52,614
Here you are. Good night.

478
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,423
Good night, Mr. Brown.

479
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,561
Enjoy yourself.

480
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,024
Did I guess wright?

481
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,664
Is it your flower?

482
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,660
From now on it will be.

483
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,525
Would you like me to close it?

484
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:07,499
No.

485
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:13,644
Hah... and now to the park.

486
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,420
Do you think it would all be close?

487
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,564
I hope not.

488
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,727
I never come here in the season.

489
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,297
It's more pleasant in the winter.
I don't know why.

490
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:41,493
It's perhaps...

491
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,503
Because you prefer to imagine
how it will be in the spring.

492
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:48,269
Because if it's spring,
then it's nothing to imagine and to w

493
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,446
Is there anything about
me you don't know?

494
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:51,670
A few things.

495
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:53,607
For instance, one thing I don't know,

496
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,616
If one day they would
make a wax figure of you and put it th

497
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:59,221
Because you'll be so famous.

498
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:03,382
Well, if they do, will you pay your
penny to come in and see me?

499
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:07,530
If you come alive.

500
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,469
Now I see you as a little girl.

501
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,612
You do?

502
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,378
When my father was alive,
we traveled a lot.

503
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:27,983
He went nearly everywhere.

504
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,516
We've had a wonderful time.

505
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,244
I didn't know you traveled so much.

506
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:32,547
Oh, yes.

507
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:35,247
Perhaps we've been in some
of the same places.

508
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:37,324
No, I don't think so.

509
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:38,358
Where did you go?

510
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,530
Well, it was a long time. But...

511
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,664
For instance, there was Rio de Janeiro.

512
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,661
Beautiful, exotic,
real with its botanical garden.

513
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:48,527
Its Avenue palms, Sugarloaf fountain,

514
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:53,301
And the harbor where you can
look down and see the flying fi

515
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,136
We're in Venice.

516
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,277
Yes, we've arrived.

517
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,744
Where would you like to go next?
France? England? Russia?

518
00:41:59,116 --> 00:41:59,411
Switzerland.

519
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,106
Switzerland.

520
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:06,223
Excuse me a moment
while I talked to the engineer.

521
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,489
You and the lady,
are you enjoying the trip?

522
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,494
Very much.?
We're off to Switzerland.

523
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,494
There you go. Thank you.

524
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,463
Oh... thank you.

525
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,001
Switzerland.

526
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,365
Switzerland.

527
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,508
Switzerland.

528
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:50,192
So, you're looking
down at the flying fish. Then what?

529
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,369
Aren't you going to finish the trip?

530
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,538
Well, there weren't any trip,
do you mind?

531
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,536
You see, my father
had a friend in the Travel Bureau.

532
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,003
My father worked across the street.

533
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,076
He was an assistant super
attendant of the Municipal water?

534
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:07,080
And he used to bring photos home
with pictures in them.

535
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:08,717
And in the evening,
he'd put on his traveling coat.

536
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,384
That's what he called it,
'Cause I was very young.

537
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,181
And he'd say:
where should we go this evening?

538
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,723
And I would say: Verra Cruse.
Because it's a beautiful name.

539
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,460
And then he would say: um...
it's summer there,

540
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,188
You don't want to be roasted
like a coffee bean, do you?

541
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,627
So, you never did get there?

542
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,697
No. It's just like I tripped the land
with the midnight sun.

543
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,071
What stop are you in time?

544
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,034
The weather.

545
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,035
I thought of India.

546
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,572
But then father remembered
it was the raining season.

547
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,505
Your father was an expert on climates.

548
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:35,576
My mother used to say that...

549
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,738
He knew what the weather
was everywhere except home.

550
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:40,742
What mountain was that?

551
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,018
That's the Mt. MataHorn.

552
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,312
You've climbed it?

553
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:45,487
Um hum.

554
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,658
Tell me when you've climbed up
the mountain,
what then?

555
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:56,300
Well, you come down again.

556
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,268
Tell me more about your father.

557
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,967
Well, then he finally did go away.

558
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,610
He had the nicest eyes.

559
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,210
Yes, I can see them.

560
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,646
Why do you like to climb mountains?

561
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,452
Well, I suppose because,

562
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:20,021
No matter how high you climb,
there's always a higher one.

563
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:22,692
And you like to imagine
that the other one is even more wond

564
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,458
Like the spring in the park.

565
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,093
You know far too much about me already,

566
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:28,196
And I know almost nothing about you

567
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:33,200
Except you traveled a great deal.

568
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:38,238
0End of the line.
All change.

569
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,377
All change.

570
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:52,515
What now?

571
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:53,781
Where haven't we been?

572
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:56,092
We have no countries left.

573
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,523
Then we'll begin all over again.

574
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:02,493
There you are.
Thank you.

575
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,659
We'll revisit the scenes of your youth.

576
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:37,233
I don't know about them
but I'm going home.

577
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:38,298
Right after this number.

578
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,528
? Me too, if he is not paying
me 50 quarters.

579
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:49,269
I'd like to playing for married people.
They've got homes.

580
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,490
You're sorcerous.

581
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:06,220
Now I'm sure,
How else could we dance this way

582
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:09,962
Unless we've danced together before.

583
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:16,106
And if we had,
we should ever remember it.

584
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,081
Please.

585
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:01,444
Promise me something.

586
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,246
Anything.

587
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,956
But I don't even know where you live.

588
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,557
Promise me you won't vanish.

589
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,699
I won't be the one who vanishes.

590
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:40,315
We're here.

591
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,493
Thank you.

592
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,473
Thank you.

593
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:07,381
Who is it?

594
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:08,516
Brown.

595
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:13,656
Good morning, Mr. Brown.

596
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:21,230
(End of Side A)

597
00:48:57,467 --> 00:49:00,925
Please be seated.

598
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:04,232
Lisa, leave it on.
Someone wants to see it.

599
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:05,032
Oh.

600
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:11,181
Real customer. Looks like a good one.

601
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,713
One moment.

602
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:24,592
You'll like this one, I'm sure.
I'm sure.

603
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:31,190
I like it very much.
Very much.

604
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,959
How did you find me?

605
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,727
I'm a good detective, what you think?

606
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:38,074
You are.

607
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:48,411
I'm afraid we have to put off
our play for tonight.

608
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:51,382
I couldn't go away without seeing you.

609
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:52,577
Where are you going?

610
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,086
Milano.

611
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:57,988
The whole orchestra are going.
We go to play at Chigano.

612
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,527
It's wonderful.

613
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,700
I've forgotten all about it.

614
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,626
It won't be long.
Just two weeks.

615
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,063
The train leaves at 5:30.

616
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:12,571
Do you suppose you could see me off?

617
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:13,708
I'll try.

618
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:20,414
I'll look for you then.
Good bye. Thank you.

619
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:27,590
Good-bye. You will be there.

620
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:30,126
How did it go?

621
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:31,692
He wasn't interested in the suit.

622
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:35,225
But... Madam,
could I leave a bit earlier today?

623
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,230
How early?
About 5:00.

624
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:41,165
Yes.
Sure.

625
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,531
Thank you, Madam.

626
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:47,676
Congratulations, my dear.

627
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:13,099
Stephan, the train is leaving.
Just a minute

628
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:17,205
How long have you been standing here?

629
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:21,002
I don't want to go. Do you believe that?

630
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:22,769
I'll be here when you get back.

631
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:23,544
Come on.

632
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:27,046
Yes.
Stephan, hurry, please.

633
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,242
I still know so little about you.

634
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:34,322
You like mistery.

635
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:38,016
That a woman like you exist,
and I found you.

636
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:41,163
That's mistery to me.

637
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:45,494
Say"Stephan",
the way you said it last night.

638
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,330
Stephan.

639
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,062
As if you've said it all your life.

640
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:50,671
Better hurry, sir.

641
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,804
Yes.

642
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:53,574
Good-bye.

643
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:58,271
Stephan.
Good-bye.

644
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:02,951
Won't be long.
I'll be back in two weeks.

645
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:10,125
Good-bye. Two weeks.

646
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:30,443
"Two weeks... Stehpan,
how little you knew of yourself."

647
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:37,187
"That train was taking
you out of my life."

648
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,526
"He was a married man."

649
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:21,663
"Does he live here in Vienna?"

650
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,464
"If we knew who he was,"

651
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:29,606
"He might be willing
to accept his responsibility."

652
00:53:31,074 --> 00:53:37,013
You won't tell us his name?

653
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,983
But you haven't the means
to take care of the child.

654
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:48,123
We'll get along.

655
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,317
It's your duty to tell us.

656
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:51,516
When a man does...

657
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:57,223
I'm feeling tired.
Would you go?

658
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:02,695
"You may wonder
why I never came to you for help."

659
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:06,041
"I wanted to be one woman
you've had known,"

660
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,710
"Who had asked you for nothing."

661
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:13,071
"My deep regret is
that you never saw your son."

662
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:18,243
"There were times during those years,
I prefer not to remember."

663
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:20,480
"But this I can assure you,"

664
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:25,753
"Whatever the cost,
he'd repayed me a thousand times."

665
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:29,155
"You'd have been proud of him, too."

666
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,333
"When he was almost nine."

667
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:35,402
"As much for his sake as mine,
I married."

668
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,539
"You know who my husband is."

669
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,709
"Yohan Stafe asked to marry me."

670
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,977
"Knowing the truth about us,
and about our child."

671
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,271
Oh. How lovely.

672
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,108
Thank you, Yohan.

673
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,750
What a nice birthday!

674
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,383
This..., and Stephan home.

675
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,056
You know,
I'm not good at saying such things.

676
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:58,489
But... Lisa, I want you to be
as happy as you may be.

677
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:05,362
If I were really deserving why,
I'll be ready on time.

678
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:08,537
You are happy?

679
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,337
You are?

680
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:18,480
"Why shouldn't I be?"

681
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:22,951
Let's say Good-night.

682
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:30,148
Is that your another talent?

683
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:36,332
He has a lot of talents,
but not until he finishes his milk.

684
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,228
Or for brushing his teeth.

685
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:41,665
Made in Switzerland.

686
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:45,030
Switzerland must be a very nice place,
don't you think?

687
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,469
Who gave it to you, darling?

688
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,438
Her Frank.

689
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:48,576
Who's Her Frank?

690
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:49,745
His music teacher.

691
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,104
He said that he thinks
that I'm nature talented.

692
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,475
For harmonica?

693
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,049
No. For music.

694
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:59,050
Oh.

695
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:00,244
Good night, Stephan.

696
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:03,551
Good night, sir.

697
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,692
Good night, darling.

698
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:08,997
Good night, mother.

699
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:12,326
Mother!

700
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:13,501
Yes!

701
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:17,673
I'll be right back.

702
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,636
You remember the last time,
first night I was home from school.

703
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,035
Um-hum, what about it?

704
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:25,737
When you went out,
you let me sleep in your room.

705
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:26,445
Alright.

706
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:29,083
It's a special concession
because it's your first night home

707
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:33,221
But hurry. I'm late.

708
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,560
In just a minute.
There's no hurry.

709
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,025
Good night, sir.

710
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:44,199
Good night.

711
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,236
You know, Stephan, it might be nicer...

712
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,637
If you could say "Good night,
father!"instead of"Good nigh

713
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,443
But I've always said it that way.

714
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:58,010
I think he'd like it
if you could manage to change it.

715
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:00,375
Suppose you said to me
"Good night, Madam."

716
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,143
It would sound very silly, wouldn't it?

717
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:06,049
Now, promise me you'd go to sleep,
and not wait up for me.

718
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,223
I promise.

719
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,085
Would you bring me
the program of the opera?

720
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:12,227
I promise.

721
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,294
Good night, Madam.

722
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,193
Good night, Sir.

723
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,528
After all when a person treats
you so much like his son,

724
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,465
He is make sense of your father.

725
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,731
Alright, mother, if you say so.

726
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,077
Good night.

727
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:41,249
"The course of our lives can
be changed by such little thing

728
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:46,054
"So many passing by,
each intent on his own problems."

729
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:52,064
"So many faces,
that one might be easily lost."

730
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:56,728
"I know now. Nothing happens by chance."

731
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:03,909
"Every moment is measured.
Every step is counted."

732
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,978
Curtain. Curtain going up.

733
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:06,978
Second act.

734
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:12,416
Curtain going up. Second act.

735
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,954
Look! Isn't that Stephan Brown?

736
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,523
He played last week.
Is that a concert tour?

737
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,422
Pleasure trip, most likely.

738
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:26,296
The way he's burning himself up,
it's a wonder he's still alive.

739
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,404
Ten years ago, he showed great promise.

740
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:30,698
Too bad.

741
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:34,133
With that talent,
he could've been a great pianist.

742
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,175
Perhaps talent is not enough.

743
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:38,745
Perhaps he's have too many talents.

744
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:39,979
Second act!

745
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:44,119
Curtain going up!

746
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:54,988
Sorry.

747
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,096
We're late.

748
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:59,097
You know the colonel is going...

749
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:00,997
Everyone is asking for you.

750
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,068
You've made a conquest.

751
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:08,211
My dear, you should have joined this.

752
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:31,497
"Suddenly, in that one moment."

753
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,692
"Every thing was in danger."

754
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,697
"Every thing I thought was safe."

755
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:43,478
"Somewhere out there were your eyes.
couldn't escape them.""Somewhere out there were yo

756
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,274
"It's like the first time I saw you."

757
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:52,148
"The years between were melting away."

758
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:53,049
I have a headache.

759
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:53,551
I'll take you home.

760
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,723
No. Please don't worry.

761
00:59:55,091 --> 01:00:00,461
I'll be alright.
Please stay here.

762
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:15,373
Would you be kind enough
to give my husband a message.

763
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,205
He's in 17. Not now.

764
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:18,402
But after the show.

765
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,742
Tell him, I've decided to go home.
Tell him not to worry.

766
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:24,052
Thank you.

767
01:00:34,063 --> 01:00:35,087
Call my carriage, please.

768
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,766
Yes, Madam.

769
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:38,566
Sergeant!

770
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,736
Yes, Madam.

771
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,066
Excuse me.

772
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,463
You must realized
that where there's a pursuit.

773
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,106
And there'd also be a pursuer.

774
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:21,606
I've seen you somewhere, I know.

775
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:23,210
I followed you upstairs.

776
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,040
And watched you in your box.

777
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,716
But I couldn't place you.

778
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:31,349
And I had to speak with you.

779
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:36,184
I know how it sounds.
I assure you in this case that it's true.

780
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:38,587
Believe that, don't you?

781
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,695
Yes.
Thank you.

782
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,622
Now please, just a moment.

783
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:46,359
Is that any place we could have met,
that I might have seen

784
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:49,231
At one of my concerts?

785
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,100
There must have been sometime ago.

786
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:54,503
I haven't given any concerts
in Vienna lately.

787
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,407
Or anywhere else in that matter.

788
01:01:57,613 --> 01:02:00,138
You don't play anymore?

789
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,317
Oh, it's not quite as final as that.

790
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:05,316
I always tell myself that,
"Beginning next week."

791
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:07,648
And when next week comes,
it's this week.

792
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,685
So, I wait for next week again.

793
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,550
What are you waiting for?

794
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:14,389
It's a very disturbing question.

795
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:15,222
My carriage...

796
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:18,992
You can't ask such a question,
and just walk away.

797
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:22,330
I have a feeling...
please don't think I'm mad.

798
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:26,235
I know it sounds strange.
I can't explain it.

799
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:31,573
But I feel that you understand
what I can't even say.

800
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:35,376
And that you can help me.

801
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:41,524
Have you ever shopped
for places like cards,

802
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,388
Hoping to find the one...

803
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:47,290
Lies somewhere at the edge
of your memory.

804
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:50,660
The one you've been waiting for.

805
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,228
But tonight, when I first saw you.

806
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:56,098
And later
when I watched you in the darkness.

807
01:02:56,305 --> 01:03:01,072
It looked like one face amongst others.

808
01:03:01,310 --> 01:03:04,245
Who are you?

809
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:08,172
Promise me, I'll see you again.
I must see you.

810
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:11,319
I don't know.

811
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:40,182
Yohan,
you don't think I want this to happen?

812
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,275
What are you going to do?

813
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:46,421
I don't know.

814
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:51,049
Lisa. We have a marriage.

815
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:54,286
Perhaps it's not all you once
hoped for. But...

816
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:58,695
You've a home, and your son.
People who care for you.

817
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,059
I know that, Yohan.

818
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,033
I'll do anything to avoid hurting you.

819
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:06,605
But I can't help it.

820
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:09,171
And your son?

821
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:11,209
Can you avoid hurting him?

822
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:16,374
I have to calm down and see that.

823
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:22,024
There're such things as honor,
and decency.

824
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,659
I told myself that hundred times
this one evening.

825
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,655
You talk like it is out of your hands.

826
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:31,397
It's not, Lisa.
You have a will.

827
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:34,694
You can do what's right,
what's best for you.

828
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:37,266
Or you can throw away your life.

829
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:39,998
I have no hopes whatsoever.

830
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,074
That's romantic nonsense.

831
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:43,768
Is it?

832
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,170
Yohan, I can't help it.

833
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,611
I can't dispute that.

834
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:53,312
What about him?
Can him help himself, either?

835
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:58,359
I know now that he needs me
as much as I always needed him.

836
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:01,927
Isn't it a bit late for him
to find that out?

837
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:06,067
We're home, sir.

838
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:17,505
Good night.

839
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:21,649
Good night, sir.

840
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:40,535
Lisa. If you do this,
you can never turn back.

841
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:42,067
You know that, don't you?

842
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:45,206
Yes.

843
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:53,646
I warn you. I shall do everything in
my power to prevent it.

844
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:27,748
Hello, darling. Wake up.

845
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:34,957
It's time to go to your own room.

846
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:39,091
Did you have a nice time?

847
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:42,230
Yes, darling.

848
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:44,690
Good night, father.

849
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:47,035
Good night.

850
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:49,033
Did you hear? I just said it.

851
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:51,172
Yes, darling.

852
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:57,313
Tell me about the opera...
was it exciting?

853
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:04,145
How's that?

854
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,186
You're wonderful.

855
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:11,326
You're wonderful.

856
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:14,562
You've always been a wonderful boy.

857
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,460
You know how much that it's meant to me?

858
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:21,102
Be so proud of you, always.

859
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:24,272
I know it.

860
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,028
Don't worry, mother.

861
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,966
Two weeks will go like an express train.

862
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:58,367
You sure you're coming?

863
01:07:58,574 --> 01:07:59,563
Of course. I promise.

864
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:01,674
You can even get
my room in the village for me.

865
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,602
I'll get you the same
one you're there last time.

866
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,970
The one with the balcony.

867
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:12,121
Didn't I tell you
that compartment was quaranteened?

868
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,520
I'm sorry, Madam.

869
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:16,282
This compartment had to be closed up.

870
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,084
I'll take you to the next cart forwards.

871
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:21,195
That's good.
I'll be near the local motive.

872
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:25,333
I'll take the box.

873
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,332
Do we have two local motives
on our train?

874
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,266
We usually get along with one.

875
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:32,464
But I talked to the engineer.

876
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:35,143
How about that one over there?
You can have two seats in there.

877
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:37,642
He's traveling alone.

878
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,446
Don't worry about it, Madam.

879
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:40,546
I'll take good care of him.

880
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,512
We leave in about a minute.

881
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:45,050
Better hurry and get your seat.

882
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:47,347
You'll see better if you sit over here.

883
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,353
And if you get chilly,
you can put up the window.

884
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:52,493
Yes, mother.

885
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:57,758
Stephan. You know how I've
longed for you to being home.

886
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,034
And now I can't even explain.

887
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:03,660
I hope some day, very soon...
I'll be able to give you a reason.

888
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:08,305
But now, you just have to believe
that it's for your own goo

889
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:10,206
I don't mind going back so much.

890
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:12,573
Especially when you're coming so soon.

891
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:14,142
It'd be like two vocations.

892
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,578
Alright, darling.

893
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:19,045
I'll show you the new walk
we found since you're there last

894
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:23,191
Better get out, lady.

895
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,360
You'll write me often, won't you?

896
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:36,164
Yes mother But I can't write very often.
We've only two weeks.

897
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:42,311
Good-bye, mother. Two weeks.

898
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:19,347
Make way, please.

899
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,981
Make way, please.

900
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:24,118
What happened?

901
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,978
Someone hurt?

902
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:27,485
No reason to get alarmed.

903
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:28,987
They said that it's typhus.

904
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:29,714
Typhus?

905
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:35,062
Yes. Typhus on the train.

906
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:50,268
Yes. Madam.

907
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:52,674
Yes. Mr. Brown. Stephan Brown.

908
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:58,008
Brown? One moment, please.

909
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,721
Fritz!

910
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:02,751
Um?

911
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,631
Could you tell me has Mr. Brown
been here this evening?

912
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:12,968
Oh, Mr. Brown is no longer
a customer of ours.

913
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:14,692
Not for sometime.

914
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:18,130
Mr. Brown these days
is more likely to be found in the Ritz.

915
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,309
Thank you.

916
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:52,606
Good evening, Madam.

917
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,641
I still have nice flowers left.
I'm closing up.

918
01:11:55,844 --> 01:12:01,646
And I've saved you
a nice bouquet. Very cheap.

919
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:09,656
I'll take those, the white ones.

920
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:11,185
Don't bother wrapping them up.

921
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:15,329
Doesn't matter.

922
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:05,237
Now, drive.
Drive on!

923
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:34,608
Stephan Brown. Is he in?

924
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:46,754
Thank you.

925
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:35,761
This is a surprise.

926
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:38,766
But I assure you're a very happy one.

927
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:44,636
John didn't prepare me
for such pleasant occassion.

928
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:46,981
I thought last night...

929
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:50,777
The darkness might've
been tricks with my eyes.

930
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,781
You're even more
beautiful than I imagined.

931
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:55,521
Very kind of you.

932
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:58,988
This is just the hour
for a bit late supper.

933
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:00,161
Or is it too late?

934
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:02,159
Oh, it makes no different.
You're here.

935
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:05,492
As far as I'm concerned,
all the clocks in the world will st

936
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,498
Exuse me a moment.

937
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:09,568
John!

938
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:11,564
John, I'm sorry to send you out so late.

939
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:14,067
Would you go out to the coners,
and get a few things.

940
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:20,215
We're going to have supper.
The usual things.

941
01:15:25,153 --> 01:15:29,351
John makes life possible for
a hopelessly single man.

942
01:15:29,558 --> 01:15:32,186
She fascinates you, too!

943
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:33,223
Do you remember...

944
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:36,261
The Greek built the
Statue of God they didn't know.

945
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:38,763
But hope someday would come to them.

946
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:41,125
But mine happened to be a Goddess.

947
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:43,736
And you've never found her?

948
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,597
For years, I never woke in the morning,

949
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:49,204
But I said to myself,

950
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:54,348
"Perhaps today she will come.
My life will be really to begin."

951
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:58,041
Sometimes it seemed very near.

952
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:04,089
But now I'm older, I know better.

953
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,092
Even for yourself,
you don't play anymore?

954
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:11,130
Oh, I remember last night,
you're kind of being interested...

955
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,301
I forgot John locked
it when I went away.

956
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:16,369
Nowadays, I'm away quite a lot of time.

957
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:20,975
I'll ask him for the key
when he comes back.

958
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:22,973
You wear very lovely.

959
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:24,509
It's a beautiful dress.

960
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:26,374
Thank you.

961
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,608
How could you do that?
Give it up altogether.

962
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:32,681
Well, if you're so curious,
I'll tell you.

963
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:35,580
One night I came back to this room.

964
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:38,316
I had given a concert like
all the others.

965
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,290
Not bad, and not worse.

966
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:44,590
Afterwards,
they said all the usual things.

967
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,099
The things you say
when you are not really convinced.

968
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:49,429
So, I happened to look into the mirror.

969
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:52,300
This one here.

970
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:55,032
The young protege was no longer young.

971
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:58,508
Certainly wasn't perpetual.

972
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:01,444
Since then, I found out a thing to do.

973
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:05,586
More amuzing things.

974
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:16,498
I knew last night. Didn't you?

975
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:37,111
I haven't even
offered to fix you a drink.

976
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:37,717
Stephan.

977
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:40,145
Yes.

978
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:43,085
I came here...
I have something to tell you.

979
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,656
If it's something to do with you,
l"m very interested.

980
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:46,688
It has to do with us.

981
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:50,031
We can't possibily
be serious this early in the morning.

982
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,664
At least not without
a glass of champagne.

983
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:55,492
Won't be a minute.

984
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:59,333
Champagne tastes much better
after midnight, don't you think

985
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:00,701
Much better.

986
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:02,202
I've just came back from America.

987
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,003
It's a fascinating country.

988
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:05,577
The men are fond of money.

989
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:08,347
And their wives... are fond of Europeans.

990
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,279
Must have been a wonderful trip?

991
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:15,218
Have you travelled a great deal?

992
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:21,363
I couldn't get
you out of my mind all day.

993
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:23,324
No, I don't believe you.

994
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:25,363
If I only knew you're coming...

995
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:26,659
To tell you the truth,

996
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:29,560
I never dared to hope
that you could've managed so soon.

997
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,997
But you're so cleaver,
you've arranged it so beautifully.

998
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:36,439
You know, you're a very strange woman.

999
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:37,667
Am I?

1000
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:43,348
Something you've said last night,
it keeps running through my

1001
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,144
What was that?

1002
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:49,983
I'll tell you in just a moment
as soon as I get the ice.

1003
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:53,059
Are you getting lonely out there.

1004
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:56,230
Very lonely.

1005
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:03,368
"I come to tell you about us."

1006
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:06,540
"To offer you my whole life."

1007
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:12,681
"But you didn't even remember me."

1008
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:52,979
Can I take you somewhere, young lady?

1009
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:55,985
Anywhere at all?

1010
01:19:56,191 --> 01:20:01,128
It makes no difference.

1011
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:24,210
"I don't remember where I went."

1012
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:26,478
"Time will pass me."

1013
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:28,781
"Not in days, or in hours."

1014
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:33,025
"But in the distance
that put between us."

1015
01:20:33,228 --> 01:20:36,664
"Now I think again.
I went to my son."

1016
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:39,432
"But is was too late."

1017
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:43,092
"He died last night from typhus."

1018
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:46,604
"Without even knowing I was there."

1019
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:49,333
"Now I'm alone."

1020
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:53,537
"My head throbs,
and my temple are burning."

1021
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:59,243
"Perhaps God had been kind.
I, too, have caught the fever."

1022
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:03,584
"If this letter reaches you,
believe this..."

1023
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:07,728
"That I love you now as
I've always loved you."

1024
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,085
"My life can be measured...

1025
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:13,427
"By the moments
that I've with you and our child."

1026
01:21:13,635 --> 01:21:17,264
"If only you could've shared
those moments."

1027
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:21,568
"If only you could've recognized
what was always yours."

1028
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:25,075
"Could've found whar was never lost."

1029
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,215
"If only..."

1030
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:16,556
You remembered her?

1031
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:38,612
Lisa...

1032
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,781
Lisa...

1033
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:24,358
Bring my things.

1034
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:56,690
Ready, gentleman?

1035
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:03,627
"If only you could've recognized
what was always yours."

1036
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:09,937
"Could've found what was never lost..."

1037
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:41,701
The End.
