1
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,300
Then... You've made up your mind?

2
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
You are going through with it?

3
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,100
Why not?

4
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,500
For one thing, he's an excellent chap.

5
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,200
At least try to get some sleep.

6
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,900
And if I were you, no more cognac.

7
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,100
We'll come for you at five.
It'd give you three hours.

8
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,900
You will be here.

9
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,400
I don't mind so much being killed.

10
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,500
But you know how hard it is for
me to get up in the morning.

11
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,200
Good night.

12
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,300
Good night.

13
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,700
I'm afraid this time, Stefan has picked
a fight with the wrong man

14
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,000
I wonder if he'll be here
when we come back?

15
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,100
Who is it?

16
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,000
Brand.

17
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Good morning, Mr. Brand.

18
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,800
Cheer up, John.

19
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,300
This is one engagement
that I have no intention of keeping.

20
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,900
Honor is a luxury,
only gentlemen can afford.

21
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,900
Pack my things...

22
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,600
Whatever you think
that I'll need for an indefinite stay.

23
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
I have a cab downstairs...

24
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,700
In about an hour,
I'll go out the back way.

25
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,900
I'm sorry.
I won't be here to see their faces.

26
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,000
Did this come during the night?

27
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,000
Would you bring me
some coffee... with cognac?

28
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,300
"By the time you read this letter,
I may be dead."

29
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,100
"I have so much to tell you,
perhaps very little time."

30
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,900
"Will I ever send it?"

31
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,200
"I don't know."

32
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,200
"I must find the strength to write, now
before it's too late."

33
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,100
"And as I write, it may become clear
that what happened to us"

34
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,800
"...had its own reason beyond
our poor understanding."

35
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,600
"If this reaches you..."

36
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,700
"You'll know how I became yours..."

37
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,800
"When you didn't know who I was,
or even that I existed."

38
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,900
"I think everyone has two birthdays.
The day of his physical birth..."

39
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,500
"... and the beginning
of his conscious life."

40
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,000
"Nothing is vivid...
or really my memory."

41
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,100
"Before that day in spring..."

42
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,300
"When I came home from school,"

43
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,600
"And found a moving
van in front of our building."

44
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,700
"I wondered about our new neighbour..."

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,200
"Who owned such beautiful things."

46
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,300
Lisa! Come in, Lisa!

47
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,100
Come in this minute, did you hear?

48
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,800
Lisa!

49
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,100
Yes, mother.

50
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,800
Who is going to clean that up?

51
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,100
Me. I suppose.

52
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,500
I haven't enough to do.

53
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,600
You better get another rope.

54
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,200
Uh?

55
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
You better get another rope.

56
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
Alright!

57
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,500
Get another rope!

58
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
This is the last time I move a musician.

59
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:56,600
Why does he have to play the piano?

60
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,300
Where do these go?

61
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,600
What?

62
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,100
In the study.

63
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Thank you.

64
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,000
Lisa, what are you doing out there?

65
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Come inside.

66
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,600
"I didn't see you that day,
or from many days there after."

67
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,500
"But I could listen to your playing."

68
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,400
I wish he'd stop that noise.

69
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
It's not noise.

70
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,100
Don't bite my head off.
Mr. Brand is playing.

71
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:26,800
You called that playing?

72
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,900
Shh...

73
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,600
How old is he?

74
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,200
Who?

75
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,200
Him!

76
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,300
Quite old, I guess.

77
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,700
Oh.

78
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,200
You know the boy
I was talking to outside the school?

79
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,100
The bony one with the yellow
hair and the long nose.

80
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,600
One who lives next to the grocery.

81
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,100
I'm gonna do something about it...

82
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,300
If he doesn’t keep his hands to himself.

83
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,000
These things he does,
right out in the street.

84
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,400
Thank you, John.
I'll be home later.

85
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,700
Thank you.

86
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,200
Good morning.

87
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,800
Why, Lisa! You're all red in the face.

88
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,100
You're blushing!

89
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,700
I'll get you for that!

90
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,000
"Yes, I was blushing."

91
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,800
"And hard as it
may be for you to realize..."

92
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,600
"From that moment on,
I was in love with you."

93
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,200
"Quite consciously,
I was preparing myself for you."

94
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,200
"I kept my clothes neater,
so you wouldn't be ashamed of me."

95
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,700
Bow, two three four...

96
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,200
"I went to dancing school."

97
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,200
"I wanted to become more graceful,
and learn good manners for you."

98
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,000
Bow... two three, and one two three...

99
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,000
And one two three...

100
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,300
"So I would know more about you,
and your world..."

101
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,900
"I went to the library..."

102
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,100
"And study the lifes
of great musicians of the past."

103
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,100
"Though I was not able to
go to your concerts,"

104
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,500
"I found ways of sharing in
your success."

105
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,700
"As months went by,
I began to know your friends."

106
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,800
"Many of them are women. Most of them."

107
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,900
Lisa!

108
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Lisa!

109
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,000
Where are you, Lisa?

110
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,700
Aren't you going to finish your dinner?

111
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Sorry, mother.

112
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,900
"But I really lived for
those evenings when you're alone."

113
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
"And I pretended
that you're playing just for me."

114
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,100
"I know you didn't know it..."

115
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,500
"You're giving me some
of the happiest hours of my life."

116
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,400
"Then came a great day for me."

117
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,400
"In the building where we lived..."

118
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,500
"... Thursday was rug-beating day."

119
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,100
Come on, let's help him!

120
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,900
Oh! I've got to do my own.

121
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:53,600
I'll do it for you afterwards.
Come on!

122
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,700
Remember what you've promised!

123
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,800
I will.

124
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,300
Beautiful rug.

125
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,600
It's a beautiful rug, isn't it?

126
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh, it's just a rug.

127
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,000
Oh, you wouldn't know.

128
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,300
Say, what are we doing this for?

129
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,000
Shh! He will hear you.

130
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
Oh, he can't talk.

131
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,500
Well, he can hear, can't he?

132
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,700
You're welcome.

133
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,000
Come on, Lisa.

134
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
I'll be right down.

135
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
What are you going to do?

136
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Go away, I'll be right down.

137
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,300
What are you going to do?

138
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,100
Go away, or I'll throw you downstairs.

139
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,300
Are you crazy?

140
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,600
Lisa!

141
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,500
What are you doing up there?

142
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,800
Come dear, I've something to tell you.

143
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,500
It's really good news.

144
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:18,900
If you think about it sensibly,
you'll be very very happy.

145
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,200
Sit down.

146
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,600
I can understand
that you must've been startled...

147
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,400
When you saw
Herr Kastner and me in the hall.

148
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,500
Perhaps it's my fault for not telling
you something about it before...

149
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,600
You see, dear,
your mother is not really old.

150
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
She can have admirers, too.

151
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,200
She can even... well, be in love with a man.

152
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,200
Someday you'll understand
better what that means.

153
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,700
Besides...

154
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,300
You know how hard it is for us to
get along on my small pension.

155
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Herr Kastner has a comfortable business in Linz.

156
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,800
A military tailor.

157
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,100
And he's done me the honor
of asking to marry him.

158
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,800
Besides, he is a kind man,
and he likes you very much.

159
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,400
I'm sure with his help,
it'll be much easier for you to...

160
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,200
Mother!

161
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,300
What is it?

162
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,700
Would we have to go to Linz?

163
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,800
Would we have to live there?

164
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,300
But why not?

165
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,700
What is there to keep us here?

166
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,300
I won't go!

167
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,000
I won't go!

168
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,600
Lisa!

169
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,400
What's the matter?

170
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,200
But... what is it?

171
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,300
Lisa!

172
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,300
I won't go.

173
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:43,800
I won't go.

174
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Now Lisa!
Do be reasonable and tell your mother.

175
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
I won't! I won't!

176
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,500
Lisa!

177
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,400
Let see...
We've eleven altogether.

178
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,800
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.
Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven.

179
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,100
It comes, Dear.

180
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,700
Don't worry, dear.
I'll take care of everything.

181
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,100
The adjustment promised the trunk
said that...

182
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,000
Oh, either I'd lost half a minute...
or the station parts ahead.

183
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,700
How much would that be, please?

184
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:16,400
It's up to you, sir.

185
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,300
Up to me?

186
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
One dollar should be enough.

187
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,700
The guy promised the trunk
would be here on time.

188
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,800
With all the boxes...

189
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,200
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.

190
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,200
Uh... how long will it take
if we send them through Linz third class?

191
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:32,900
Two weeks, maybe.

192
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,800
Two weeks... very good.

193
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,500
Now each of these... second class.

194
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Third class...

195
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,700
Each of these... third class.

196
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,600
Yes...

197
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,500
Ah... what did I tell you.

198
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,400
When you're going to a thing,
do it one time.

199
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,900
That is always nice.

200
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Hello. Thank you.

201
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,100
You can unload it here.

202
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,700
Our train doesn't leave until 12:00.

203
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,000
Yes, 12:00, darling.

204
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,100
The twelve!

205
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
Please don't get excited, dear.

206
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,600
I'd be calm.

207
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,400
"Suddenly I knew
I couldn't live without you."

208
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,500
"I didn't know what I had in mind, or..."

209
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,700
"...what my parents would do
when they found me missing."

210
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,300
"All I wanted was to see you once more."

211
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:22,500
"To be near you again."

212
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,800
"To throw myself at your feet,
cling to you, and never leave you."

213
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,700
"Nothing else. Nothing else mattered."

214
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,500
Alright, alright.

215
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Oh, it's you, Lisa.

216
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,600
I thought by now
that you're half way to Linz?

217
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Didn't your train leave in about...

218
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,200
I forgot something.

219
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,500
"These rooms where I'd lived,
have been filled with your music."

220
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,100
"Now they were empty."

221
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,700
"Would they ever come to life again?"

222
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,200
"Would I?"

223
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,500
"Only you could answer."

224
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,200
"So, I waited."

225
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,300
"Waited..."

226
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,200
"For what seemed endless hours
I sat outside your door..."

227
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
"Try to keep myself awake."

228
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
"...afraid that
I might fall asleep and miss you."

229
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,300
"Then..."

230
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,400
Who is it?

231
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,100
Brand!

232
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,300
Good morning, Mr. Brand.

233
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,900
"And so, there was nothing left for me."

234
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,100
"I went to Linz."

235
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,600
"You who have always lived so freely..."

236
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:01,100
"Have you any idea
what life's like in a little garrison town?"

237
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,800
"I was eighteen now..."

238
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,000
"And was expected to take
my place in society."

239
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,800
Come now, Lisa.
Don't look down at your feet.

240
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,100
Please be tactful and
let him do the talking.

241
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,200
But not all the talking.
Do you hear me, Lisa?

242
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Good morning, Colonel.

243
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,300
Good morning, Colonel.

244
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Good morning.

245
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,100
Mrs. Kastner, Miss Kastner.
Mr. Kastner.

246
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,900
May I have the honor to
present you my nephew...

247
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,900
Lt. Leopold von Kaltnegger.

248
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,100
I have the honor to kiss your hand.

249
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,600
Very pleased to make your acquaintance.

250
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,500
Thank you, Lieutenant.

251
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,300
Mr. Kastner, I have the honor, Sir.

252
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,800
I'm very pleased to make
your acquaintance.

253
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,500
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

254
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,900
Allow me to present our daughter, Lisa.

255
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,000
Lt. Leopold von Kaltnegger.

256
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Good morning...

257
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,300
Excuse me.

258
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,500
Do you like it here in Linz?

259
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,600
Quiet well.

260
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,600
It must seemed
very restfull after living in Vienna?

261
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,400
I liked Vienna.

262
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,900
Indeed.

263
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,500
What did you like about it?

264
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,100
Perhaps you were fond of the music?

265
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,300
Yes.

266
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,900
We also have good music here.

267
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,700
Every other Saturday afternoon
they gave a concert on the Kursalon.

268
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,500
Oh, really?

269
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,300
Perhaps someday you'll allow
me the honor to escorting you?

270
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,300
Very nice of you.

271
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,000
When I was a cadet,
I took part of myself.

272
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,100
I played second trumpet.

273
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,400
Oh, how nice.

274
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,300
I must say I'm glad we both like music.

275
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:59,200
You see there's nothing wrong
with a child if she only meets the right people

276
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Up! Up! Up! Up!

277
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,900
Up! Up! Up!

278
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,300
"The Lieutenant was right."

279
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
"Linz was a musical town."

280
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,100
"So twice a month
that summer we listened..."

281
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,100
"The Lieutenant and I."

282
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,900
Before the afternoon is over,
I'm sure we'll hear an announcement

283
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,100
Nothing could please us more, Colonel.

284
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,200
Is that right, my dear?

285
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,100
Miss Lisa, this is a subject
which I wish to bring up for some time

286
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,300
I trust you'd forgive me to
presume the action that I allow myself...

287
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,700
It maybe unnecessary to mention that...

288
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,000
Ever since you first came
to my attention,

289
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,900
I've been most favourably impressed.

290
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,800
Thank you.

291
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And I believe
that your parents are not opposed...

292
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,300
...my keeping company
that is dedicated with you.

293
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,200
But, Lieutenant, I...

294
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,300
Oh, please allow me to finish.

295
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,300
As far as my prospects are concerned,
you must be aware that...

296
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,400
It's generally believed
by my uncle and others,

297
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,300
That I have qualifications
for an outstanding military career.

298
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,700
It's no doubt of that.

299
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,200
Naturally, it's too soon to
discuss any definite steps.

300
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
We should know each other
for a reasonable time...

301
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,300
But, Lieutenant...

302
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

303
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,700
It's impossible?

304
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,000
Please allow me to explain.

305
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,700
I must insist.
Is there someone else?

306
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,000
Yes.

307
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,400
I'm engaged to be married.

308
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,100
Engaged to be married?

309
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,300
I should've told you before,
but I didn't realize how...

310
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,200
But all the time you've been in Linz,

311
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,700
I haven't seen anyone's company.

312
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,400
He doesn't live in Linz.
He lives in Vienna.

313
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,600
In Vienna?

314
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,000
He... he writes music, he's a musician.

315
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,300
But how can that be?

316
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,700
Your mother and father,
they gave my uncle the encouragement...

317
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,400
They don't know yet!

318
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,600
You're engaged to a man,
and your parents don't even know him?

319
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:21,900
Um...

320
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,500
I'm sorry, I...

321
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,500
Then, please.

322
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Waiter, the wine. The wine.

323
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Up! Up!

324
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,400
But I don't understand.

325
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,900
Lisa, sit down. What happened?

326
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,500
Nothing.

327
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:19,500
But after all...

328
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,700
But you must've said something.

329
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,600
What did you say to him?

330
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,500
I only told him the truth.

331
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,900
The truth! What do you mean the truth?

332
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,600
What did you say to him?

333
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,000
I told him, I wasn't free.

334
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,100
What...?

335
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,600
"My poor parents,
for them this was the end."

336
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,700
"For me, it was a new beginning."

337
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,600
"Vienna, when I saw it again,"

338
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,500
"seemed to have taken
on a new splendour."

339
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,700
"All the time I've been away,"

340
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,600
"I thought longingly, it's your city."

341
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,800
"Now, it was our city."

342
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,400
"Madam Spitzer's where I found work."

343
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,100
"It's the kind of establishment
where one learns many things."

344
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,800
Miss Lisa, please.

345
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Coming.

346
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,800
Hold your breath.

347
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:24,200
Miss Lisa, we're waiting.

348
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,500
Very pretty.

349
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,200
Yes.

350
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,200
Very.

351
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,300
Very charming. Very charming, indeed.

352
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,200
Do you think...

353
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,300
She is not like the others,
I don't understand that girl...

354
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
But every evening,

355
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,500
As soon as these shutters are closed,
off she goes straight home.

356
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,700
Really?

357
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,400
"Madam Spitzer spoke the truth."

358
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,800
"I was not like the others."

359
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,900
"Nobody waited for me."

360
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,900
"Off I went, not home..."

361
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,700
"But to the only place
that it ever seemed home to me."

362
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,800
"Night after night,
I returned to the same spot."

363
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,700
"But you never noticed me...
until one evening."

364
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,000
I've seen you before, few nights ago.

365
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,700
Right here. Or... you live near here?

366
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,100
No.

367
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,700
You like to listen to the street singers?

368
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,300
Um... yes.

369
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,400
Neither do I.

370
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
I should introduce myself.

371
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,800
No. I know who you are.

372
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,600
I suppose sooner or later,
we have to decide where we're walk

373
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,200
I have something I should call off.

374
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:53,400
I'd never get to the place
where I start out for, anyway.

375
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,000
Pardon.

376
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,500
Excuse me.

377
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,000
Very charming.

378
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,600
Thank you.

379
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,800
Anything else I can do for you,
Mr. Brand?

380
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,900
Will you please tell Bowlish,

381
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,000
I won't be at the rehearsal this evening.

382
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,000
Congratulations.

383
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,400
Fritz, is that gentleman free now?

384
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,300
Just moment, sir.

385
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Don't you see I'm busy with Mr. Brand?

386
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:57,000
Now... how about Lily?

387
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,800
If she comes,
how am I going to tell her?

388
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,300
Well, tell her...

389
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,200
I'll tell her... It was most important
and you had to work.

390
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,300
Yes, that's it. That's fine.

391
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,300
I'm sure she will understand.

392
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,000
I'm sure.

393
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,500
Thank you.

394
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,300
Bye.

395
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,100
Stefan, I missed you yesterday.
I have to talk with you.

396
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,300
Later.

397
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,600
I saw the ? group at the conerto.
It's a young man I met...

398
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,700
His father owns half of the...

399
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,600
I thought it was something
for one of your concerts.

400
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,500
If you just go outside...

401
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,900
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

402
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,000
Tomorrow...

403
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,600
Now, don't be frightened.

404
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,900
If it's not to becoming,
the lobster would have no intention.

405
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,100
I was wrong. It is becoming.

406
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,400
Let's see,
when do they have lobster again?

407
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,300
Friday. How about Friday?

408
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,300
A week is a long time.

409
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,900
How about Wednesday.
That's pheasant.

410
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,600
They have pheasant on Monday.

411
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,400
Could you possibly make it on Monday?

412
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,200
I've no engagement at all.

413
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,600
I've none, either.
We'll have dinner tomorrow night.

414
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,100
Wiener Schnitzel.

415
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,000
Excuse me, Mr. Brand.
The lady in the next room,

416
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,900
If I'm not mistaken,
it's The Countess Newesky.

417
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,700
Would you sign her the program
of this afternoon's concert?

418
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,000
Certainly.

419
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:29,300
She said, Mozart
himself could not have done better.

420
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
How nice of her.

421
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,900
There you are.

422
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,200
Thank the Countess for the compliment.

423
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Thank you, Mr. Braun.

424
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,300
The note is not the least she deserves.

425
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,800
Four years ago
when you played the D Minor.

426
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
You remember that?

427
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,100
The morning review, also.

428
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,300
Compare too young Mozart.

429
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,500
I was very young.

430
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,800
You like it?

431
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,100
Valpolicelli, it's called.

432
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,000
First thing you see
when you come down the other side of the Alps.

433
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
The Italians say,
it is such a good wine,

434
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,500
Because the grapes have
their roots in the valley,

435
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,100
And their eyes on the mountains.

436
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,000
Please...

437
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Please what?

438
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,400
Please talk about yourself.

439
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,000
I believe you really want to hear about me.
Why?

440
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,300
Uh, never mind why.

441
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,400
The truth is,
I've had rather an easy time of it.

442
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,800
People accepted my music very quickly.

443
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
Perhaps too quickly.

444
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,100
Sometimes it's easier
to please others than oneself.

445
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,100
What're you going to say?

446
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,000
You know you don't talk very much.

447
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,300
Well... I can't say it very well. But...

448
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,100
Yes.

449
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,900
Sometimes,
I felt when you're playing that...

450
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,000
Go on.

451
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,100
That... you haven't quite found
what you're looking for.

452
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
How long have you
been hiding in my piano?

453
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,200
Uh, never mind explaining.

454
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,000
I just assume you're a sorceress,

455
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,100
And that
you can make yourself very tiny.

456
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,600
It might be a good thing
to have a sorceress for a friend.

457
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,800
Who knows?

458
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,900
You maybe able to help me someday.

459
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,200
How could I help you?

460
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,500
So, that's what you've been thinking?

461
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,200
You're a very strange girl.

462
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,700
Who ever you are,
where ever you came from...

463
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,000
Don't you have any problems?

464
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,100
Not... important ones.

465
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,700
It's been a long
while since anyone did that for me?

466
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,700
Stop here, please.

467
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,300
Woo... Ah.

468
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,300
Good evening, Mr. Brand.

469
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,100
Good evening.

470
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:05,800
Roses?

471
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,900
Yes. Please.

472
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,800
Nice red ones?

473
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,900
No. Red is the wrong color.
I think a single white rose would be perfect.

474
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,400
This is a special occasion.

475
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,400
Here you are. Good night.

476
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,200
Good night, Mr. Brand.

477
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,300
Enjoy yourself.

478
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,800
Did I guess right?

479
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,400
Is it your flower?

480
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,400
From now on it will be.

481
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,200
Would you like me to close it?

482
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,200
No.

483
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,300
Hah... and now to the park.

484
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,200
Do you think it would all be close?

485
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,300
I hope not.

486
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,400
I never come here in the season.

487
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,000
It's more pleasant in the winter.
I don't know why.

488
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,200
It's perhaps...

489
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,200
Because you prefer to imagine
how it will be in the spring.

490
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,000
Because if it's spring,
then it's nothing to imagine and to wish for.

491
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,500
Is there anything about
me you don't know?

492
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,400
A few things.

493
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,400
For instance, one thing I don't know,

494
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,300
If one day they would
make a wax figure of you and put you in there.

495
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,900
Because you'll be so famous.

496
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,100
Well, if they do, will you pay your
penny to come in and see me?

497
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,300
If you come alive.

498
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,100
Now I see you as a little girl.

499
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,300
You do?

500
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,000
When my father was alive,
we travelled a lot.

501
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,800
He went nearly everywhere.

502
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,100
We've had a wonderful time.

503
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,900
I didn't know you travelled so much.

504
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,200
Oh, yes.

505
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,100
Perhaps we've been in some
of the same places.

506
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
No, I don't think so.

507
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Where did you go?

508
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,200
Well, it was a long time. But...

509
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,300
For instance, there was Rio de Janeiro.

510
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,500
Beautiful, exotic,
real with its botanical garden.

511
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,100
Its Avenue palms, Sugarloaf fountain,

512
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,900
And the harbour where you can
look down and see the flying fishes...

513
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,800
We're in Venice.

514
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,900
Yes, we've arrived.

515
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,300
Where would you like to go next?
France? England? Russia?

516
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,100
Switzerland.

517
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:25,700
Switzerland.

518
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,800
Excuse me a moment
while I talk with the engineer.

519
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,100
You and the lady,
are you enjoying the trip?

520
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,100
Very much.
We're off to Switzerland.

521
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,200
There you go. Thank you.

522
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,100
Oh... thank you.

523
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,700
Switzerland.

524
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,000
Switzerland.

525
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Switzerland.

526
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,900
So, you're looking
down at the flying fish. Then what?

527
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,100
Aren't you going to finish the trip?

528
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,400
Well, there weren't any trips,
do you mind?

529
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,200
You see, my father
had a friend in the travel bureau.

530
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,600
My father worked across the street.

531
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,700
He was an assistant super
attendant of the municipal water?

532
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:32,700
And he used to bring photos home
with pictures in them.

533
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,300
And in the evening,
he'd put on his travelling coat.

534
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
That's what he called it,
'Cause I was very young.

535
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,800
And he'd say:
where should we go this evening?

536
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,300
And I would say: Vera Cruz.
Because it's a beautiful name.

537
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,000
And then he would say: um...
it's summer there,

538
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,800
You don't want to roast
like a coffee bean, do you?

539
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,100
So, you never did get there?

540
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,200
No. It's just like I tripped the land
with the midnight sun.

541
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,600
What stopped you this time?

542
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,500
The weather.

543
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,600
I thought of India.

544
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,100
But then father remembered
it was the raining season.

545
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,100
Your father was an expert on climates.

546
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,100
My mother used to say that...

547
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,300
He knew what the weather
was everywhere except home.

548
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,200
What mountain was that?

549
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,500
That's the Matterhorn.

550
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,900
You've climbed it?

551
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,000
Um hum.

552
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,100
Tell me when you've climbed up
the mountain,
what then?

553
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:21,900
Well, you come down again.

554
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,000
Tell me more about your father.

555
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,500
Well, then he finally did go away.

556
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,200
He had the nicest eyes.

557
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,700
Yes, I can see them.

558
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,200
Why do you like to climb mountains?

559
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,000
Well, I suppose because,

560
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,800
No matter how high you climb,
there's always a higher one.

561
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,300
And you like to imagine
that the other one is even more wonderful.

562
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,000
Like the spring in the park.

563
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,600
You know far too much about me already,

564
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,800
And I know almost nothing about you

565
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,800
Except you have travelled a great deal.

566
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,800
End of the line.
All change.

567
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,900
All change.

568
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,100
What now?

569
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,300
Where haven't we been?

570
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,600
We have no more countries left.

571
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,000
Then we'll begin all over again.

572
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,000
There you are.
Thank you.

573
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,100
We'll revisit the scenes of your youth.

574
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,700
I don't know about them
but I'm going home.

575
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,700
Right after this number.

576
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,000
Me too, if he is not paying
me 50 quarters.

577
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:14,700
I'd like to play for married people.
They've got homes.

578
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,900
You're sorceress.

579
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:31,700
Now I'm sure,
how else could we dance this way.

580
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,400
Unless we've danced together before.

581
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:41,500
And yet if we had,
should I remember it.

582
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,900
Please.

583
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,900
Promise me something.

584
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,700
Anything.

585
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,400
But I don't even know where you live.

586
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,000
Promise me you won't vanish.

587
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:41,100
I won't be the one who vanishes.

588
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:05,600
We're here.

589
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,900
Thank you.

590
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,900
Thank you.

591
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,700
Who is it?

592
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:33,900
Brand.

593
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Good morning, Mr. Brand.

594
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,600
Please be seated.

595
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,000
Lisa, leave it on.
Someone wants to see it.

596
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,800
Oh.

597
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,900
Real customer. Looks like a good one.

598
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,400
One moment.

599
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:49,300
You'll like this one, I'm sure.
I'm sure.

600
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,900
I like it very much.
Very much.

601
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,600
How did you find me?

602
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,400
I'm a good detective, what you think?

603
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:03,600
You are.

604
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,300
I'm afraid we have to put off
our play for tonight.

605
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,000
I couldn't go away without seeing you.

606
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,200
Where are you going?

607
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,700
Milano.

608
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,500
The whole orchestra is going.
We go to play at L'escala.

609
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,200
It's wonderful.

610
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,300
I've forgotten all about it.

611
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,200
It won't be long.
Just two weeks.

612
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,700
The train leaves at 5:30.

613
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,100
Do you suppose you could see me off?

614
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,300
I'll try.

615
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:45,000
I'll look for you then.
Good bye. Thank you.

616
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:52,200
Good-bye. You will be there.

617
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,900
How did it go?

618
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,300
He wasn't interested in the suit.

619
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,900
But... Madam,
could I leave a bit earlier today?

620
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,800
How early?
About 5:00.

621
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,700
Yes.
Sure.

622
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,200
Thank you, Madam.

623
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,300
Congratulations, my dear.

624
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:37,700
Stefan, the train is leaving.
Just a minute.

625
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,800
How long have you been standing here?

626
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,700
I don't want to go. Do you believe that?

627
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,300
I'll be here when you get back.

628
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,200
Come on.

629
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,600
Yes.
Stefan, hurry, please.

630
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,800
I still know so little about you.

631
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,900
You like mystery.

632
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:02,600
That a woman like you exist,
and I found you.

633
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,800
That's mystery to me.

634
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,000
Say "Stefan",
the way you said it last night.

635
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,000
Stefan.

636
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,600
As if you've said it all your life.

637
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,200
Better hurry, sir.

638
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,400
Yes.

639
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,300
Good-bye.

640
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,800
Stefan.
Good-bye.

641
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:27,800
Won't be long.
I'll be back in two weeks.

642
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,700
Good-bye. Two weeks.

643
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:55,000
"Two weeks... Stefan,
how little you knew of yourself."

644
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:01,700
"That train was taking
you out of my life."

645
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,000
"He was a married man."

646
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,200
"Does he live here in Vienna?"

647
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,000
"If we knew who he was,"

648
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:54,100
"He might be willing
to accept his responsibility."

649
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:01,500
You won't tell us his name?

650
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,500
But you haven't the means
to take care of the child.

651
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,500
We'll get along.

652
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,000
It's your duty to tell us.

653
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,900
When a man does...

654
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:21,700
I'm feeling tired.
Would you go?

655
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,100
"You may wonder
why I never came to you for help."

656
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,700
"I wanted to be one woman
you've had known,"

657
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,100
"Who had asked you for nothing."

658
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,500
"My deep regret is
that you never saw your son."

659
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:42,600
"There were times during those years,
I prefer not to remember."

660
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,900
"But this I can assure you,"

661
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:50,100
"Whatever the cost,
he'd repaid me a thousand times."

662
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,600
"You'd have been proud of him, too."

663
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,700
"When he was almost nine."

664
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,800
"As much for his sake as mine,
I married."

665
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,900
"You know who my husband is."

666
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,100
"Johann Stauffer asked to marry me."

667
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,400
"Knowing the truth about us,
and about our child."

668
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,700
Oh. How lovely.

669
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,500
Thank you, Johann.

670
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,500
What a nice birthday!

671
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,800
This..., and Stefan home.

672
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,500
You know,
I'm not good at saying such things.

673
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,900
But... Lisa, I want you to be
as happy as you've made be.

674
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:29,700
If I were really deserving why,
I'll be ready on time.

675
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,100
You are happy?

676
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,700
You are?

677
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,900
"Why shouldn't I be?"

678
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,400
Let's say good night.

679
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,600
Is he another talent?

680
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:00,700
He has a lot of talents,
but not for finishing his milk.

681
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,700
Or for brushing his teeth.

682
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,000
Made in Switzerland.

683
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,600
Switzerland must be a very nice place,
don't you think?

684
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,800
Who gave it to you, darling?

685
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,900
Herr Frank.

686
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,000
Who's Herr Frank?

687
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,100
His music teacher.

688
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,500
He said that he thinks
that I've a natural talent.

689
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,800
For harmonica?

690
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,300
No. For music.

691
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,400
Oh.

692
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,600
Good night, Stefan.

693
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,800
Good night, Sir.

694
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Good night, darling.

695
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,700
Good night, mother.

696
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:36,600
Mother!

697
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,800
Yes!

698
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I'll be right back.

699
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,000
You remember the last time,
first night I was home from school.

700
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,300
Um-hum, what about it?

701
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,500
When you went out,
you let me sleep in your room.

702
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:50,800
Alright.

703
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,400
It's a special concession
because it's your first night home.

704
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,600
But hurry. I'm late.

705
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,900
In just a minute.
There's no hurry.

706
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,400
Good night, Sir.

707
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,500
Good night.

708
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,500
You know, Stefan, it might be nicer...

709
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:18,000
If you could say "Good night,
father!"instead of „Good night, Sir"

710
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,700
But I've always said it that way.

711
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,600
I think he'd like it
if you could manage to change it.

712
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,700
Suppose you said to me
"Good night, Madam."

713
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,500
It would sound pretty silly, wouldn't it?

714
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,400
Now, promise me you'd go to sleep,
and not wait up for me.

715
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,500
I promise.

716
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,400
Would you bring me
the program of the opera?

717
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,600
I promise.

718
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,600
Good night, Madam.

719
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,600
Good night, Sir.

720
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,900
After all when a person treats
you so much like his son,

721
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,800
he is in a sense your father.

722
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,100
Alright, mother, if you say so.

723
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,400
Good night.

724
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,500
"The course of our lives can
be changed by such little things"

725
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,500
"So many passing by,
each intent on his own problems."

726
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:16,400
"So many faces,
that one might be easily lost."

727
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,100
"I know now. Nothing happens by chance."

728
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:28,200
"Every moment is measured.
Every step is counted."

729
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,100
Curtain. Curtain going up.

730
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,200
Second act.

731
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,600
Curtain going up. Second act.

732
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,200
Look! Isn't that Stefan Brand?

733
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,700
He played last week.
Is that a concert tour?

734
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,800
Pleasure trip, most likely.

735
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:50,500
The way he's burning himself up,
it's a wonder he's still alive.

736
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,600
Ten years ago, he showed great promise.

737
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,900
Too bad.

738
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,300
With that talent,
he could've been a great pianist.

739
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,400
Perhaps talent is not enough.

740
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,000
Perhaps he's have too many talents.

741
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,300
Second act!

742
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,300
Curtain going up!

743
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,700
Sorry.

744
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,800
We're late.

745
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,900
You know the colonel Kohner...

746
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,700
Everyone is asking for you.

747
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,800
You've made a conquest.

748
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,900
My dear, you should have joined us.

749
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,300
"Suddenly, in that one moment."

750
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,500
"Everything was in danger."

751
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,400
"Everything I thought was safe."

752
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:08,100
"Somewhere out there were your eyes.
And I knew I couldn't escape them."

753
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,000
"It's like the first time I saw you."

754
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:17,000
"The years between were melting away."

755
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:17,700
I have a headache.

756
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:18,300
I'll take you home.

757
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,400
No. Please don't worry.

758
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:25,200
I'll be alright.
Please stay here.

759
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,000
Would you be kind enough
to give my husband a message.

760
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,000
He's in 17. Not now.

761
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,000
But after the show.

762
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,400
Tell him, I've decided to go home.
Tell him not to worry.

763
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:48,700
Thank you.

764
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,700
Call my carriage, please.

765
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,400
Yes, Madam.

766
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,200
Sergeant!

767
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,400
Yes, Madam.

768
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,700
Excuse me.

769
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,100
You must realized
that where there's a pursuit.

770
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,700
And there'd also be a pursuer.

771
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,300
I've seen you somewhere, I know.

772
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,900
I followed you upstairs.

773
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,700
And watched you in your box.

774
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,300
But I couldn't place you.

775
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:56,000
And I had to speak with you.

776
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:00,800
I know how it sounds.
I assure you in this case that it's true.

777
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,400
Believe that, don't you?

778
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,400
Yes.
Thank you.

779
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,300
Now please, just a moment.

780
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,000
Is there any place we could have met,
that I might have seen you?

781
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,900
At one of my concerts?

782
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
There must have been sometime ago.

783
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,100
I haven't given any concerts
in Vienna lately.

784
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:22,100
Or anywhere else in that matter.

785
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,800
You don't play anymore?

786
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,900
Oh, it's not quite as final as that.

787
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,000
I always tell myself that,
"Beginning next week."

788
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,200
And when next week comes,
it's this week.

789
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,300
So, I wait for next week again.

790
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,100
What are you waiting for?

791
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,900
It's a very disturbing question.

792
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:39,800
My carriage...

793
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,500
You can't ask such a question,
and just walk away.

794
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,100
I have a feeling...
please don't think I'm mad.

795
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,700
I know it sounds strange.
I can't explain it.

796
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:56,200
But I feel that you understand
what I can't even say.

797
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,900
And that you can help me.

798
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:06,000
Have you ever shopped
for places like cards,

799
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:07,900
Hoping to find the one...

800
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,800
Lies somewhere at the edge
of your memory.

801
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,200
The one you've been waiting for.

802
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,700
But tonight, when I first saw you.

803
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,600
And later
when I watched you in the darkness.

804
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:25,600
It looked like one face amongst others.

805
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,800
Who are you?

806
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:32,900
Promise me, I'll see you again.
I must see you.

807
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,100
I don't know.

808
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:04,800
Johann,
you don't think I want this to happen?

809
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,800
What are you going to do?

810
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,900
I don't know.

811
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,600
Lisa. We have a marriage.

812
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,800
Perhaps it's not all you once
hoped for. But...

813
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,200
You've a home, and your son.
People who care for you.

814
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,600
I know that, Johann.

815
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:27,600
I'll do anything to avoid hurting you.

816
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:31,500
But I can't help it.

817
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,800
And your son?

818
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:35,600
Can you avoid hurting him?

819
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,800
He won't be harmed I'll see to that.

820
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,500
There're such things as honor,
and decency.

821
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,100
I told myself that hundred times
this one evening.

822
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,100
You talk like it is out of your hands.

823
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,800
It's not, Lisa.
You have a will.

824
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,100
You can do what's right,
what's best for you.

825
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,700
Or you can throw away your life.

826
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,600
I've had no hope but his ever.

827
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,700
That's romantic nonsense.

828
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,100
Is it?

829
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:09,800
Johann, I can't help it.

830
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,000
I can't dispute that.

831
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:17,700
What about him?
Can't he help himself, either?

832
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,700
I know now that he needs me
as much as I've always needed him.

833
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:26,400
Isn't it a bit late for him
to find that out?

834
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:31,200
We're home, Sir.

835
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,100
Good night.

836
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,200
Good night, Sir.

837
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:05,000
Lisa. If you do this,
you can never turn back.

838
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,500
You know that, don't you?

839
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,700
Yes.

840
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:18,100
I warn you. I shall do everything in
my power to prevent it.

841
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,100
Hello, darling. Wake up.

842
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:59,300
It's time to go to your own room.

843
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:03,400
Did you have a nice time?

844
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,500
Yes, darling.

845
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,000
Good night, father.

846
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,400
Good night.

847
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,400
Did you hear? I just said it.

848
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,500
Yes, darling.

849
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:21,600
Tell me about the opera...
was it exciting?

850
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:28,500
How's that?

851
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,500
You're wonderful.

852
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:35,700
You're wonderful.

853
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,900
You've always been a wonderful boy.

854
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
You know how much that it's meant to me?

855
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,400
Be so proud of you, always.

856
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:48,600
I know it.

857
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,400
Don't worry, mother.

858
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,300
Two weeks will go like an express train.

859
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,700
You sure you're coming?

860
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:23,900
Of course. I promise.

861
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,000
You can even get
my room in the village for me.

862
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,000
I'll get you the same
one you're there last time.

863
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,300
The one with the balcony.

864
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:36,500
Didn't I tell you
that compartment was quarantined?

865
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:37,800
I'm sorry, Madam.

866
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,600
This compartment had to be closed up.

867
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,400
I'll take you to the next cart forwards.

868
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,600
That's good.
I'll be near the locomotive.

869
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,500
I'll take the box.

870
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,800
Do we have two locomotives
on our train?

871
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,600
We usually get along with one.

872
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,800
But I will talk to the engineer.

873
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,300
How about that one over there?
You can have two seats in there.

874
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,800
He's travelling alone.

875
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,700
Don't worry about it, Madam.

876
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:04,800
I'll take good care of him.

877
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,700
We leave in about a minute.

878
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,400
Better hurry and get your seat.

879
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,500
You'll see better if you sit over here.

880
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,600
And if you get chilly,
you can put up the window.

881
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:16,700
Yes, mother.

882
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:22,000
Stefan. You know how I've
longed for you to being home.

883
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,200
And now I can't even explain.

884
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,900
I hope some day, very soon...
I'll be able to give you a reason.

885
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:32,500
But now, you just have to believe
that it's for your own good.

886
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,500
I don't mind going back so much.

887
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,800
Especially when you're coming so soon.

888
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,300
It'd be like two vocations.

889
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,800
Alright, darling.

890
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,200
I'll show you the new walk
we found since you're there last time.

891
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,400
Better get out, lady.

892
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,600
You'll write me often, won't you?

893
01:09:53,800 --> 01:10:00,400
Yes mother. But I can't write very often.
We've only two weeks.

894
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:06,900
Good-bye, mother. Two weeks.

895
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,600
Make way, please.

896
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,400
Make way, please.

897
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:48,600
What happened?

898
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,100
Someone hurt?

899
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:51,700
No reason to get alarmed.

900
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,100
They said that it's typhus.

901
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:53,800
Typhus?

902
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:59,200
Yes. Typhus on the train.

903
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,400
Yes. Madam.

904
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,800
Yes. Is Mr. Brand here? Stefan Brand.

905
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:22,100
Brand? One moment, please.

906
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:23,800
Fritz!

907
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,900
Um?

908
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,800
Could you tell me has Mr. Brand
been here this evening?

909
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,100
Oh, Mr. Brand is no longer
a customer of ours.

910
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,900
Not for sometime.

911
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:42,200
Mr. Brand these days
is more likely to be found at the Ritz.

912
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,500
Thank you.

913
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:16,700
Good evening, Madam.

914
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,700
I still have nice flowers left.
I'm closing up.

915
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:25,800
And I've saved you
a nice bouquet. Very cheap.

916
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:33,800
I'll take those, the white ones.

917
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,300
Don't bother wrapping them up.

918
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:39,500
Doesn't matter.

919
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:29,300
Now, drive.
Drive on!

920
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:58,600
Stefan Brand. Is he in?

921
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,800
Thank you.

922
01:14:58,200 --> 01:14:59,700
This is a surprise.

923
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,700
But I assure you're a very happy one.

924
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:08,600
John didn't prepare me
for such pleasant occasion.

925
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,900
I thought last night...

926
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:14,700
The darkness might've
played tricks with my eyes.

927
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,800
You're even more
beautiful than I imagined.

928
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:19,400
Very kind of you.

929
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:23,000
This is just the hour
for a bit late supper.

930
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,100
Or is it too late?

931
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,100
Oh, it makes no difference.
You're here.

932
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:29,400
As far as I'm concerned,
all the clocks in the world have stopped.

933
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,400
Excuse me a moment.

934
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,500
John!

935
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,500
John, I'm sorry to send you out so late.

936
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,000
Would you go out to the corner,
and get a few things.

937
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:44,700
We're going to have supper.
The usual things.

938
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:53,300
John makes life possible for
a hopelessly single man.

939
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,100
She fascinates you, too!

940
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:57,200
Do you remember...

941
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,200
The Greeks built a
statue to a God they didn't know.

942
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,700
But hoped someday would come to them.

943
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,100
But mine happened to be a Goddess.

944
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,700
And you've never found her?

945
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,500
For years, I never woke in the morning,

946
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,100
but I said to myself,

947
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:18,300
"Perhaps today she will come.
My life will really begin."

948
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:22,000
Sometimes it seemed very near.

949
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:28,000
But now I'm older, and I know better.

950
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,200
Even for yourself,
you don't play anymore?

951
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:35,000
Oh, I remember last night,
you're kind enough to be interested...

952
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:37,200
I forgot John locked
it when I went away.

953
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:40,300
Nowadays, I'm away quite a lot of time.

954
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:44,900
I'll ask him for the key
when he comes back.

955
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,900
You are very lovely.

956
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,500
It's a beautiful dress.

957
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,400
Thank you.

958
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,600
How could you do that?
Give it up altogether.

959
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,600
Well, if you're so curious,
I'll tell you.

960
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,500
One night I came back to this room.

961
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,200
I had given a concert like
all the others.

962
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,000
Not bad, and not worse.

963
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,900
Afterwards,
they said all the usual things.

964
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:11,400
The things you say
when you are not really convinced.

965
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,800
So, I happened to look into the mirror.

966
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:16,100
This one here.

967
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:18,800
The young protégée was no longer young.

968
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:22,400
Certainly wasn't perpetual.

969
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,300
Since then, I found other things to do.

970
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:29,500
More amusing things.

971
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:40,300
I knew last night. Didn't you?

972
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,900
I haven't even
offered to fix you a drink.

973
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:01,600
Stefan?

974
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:03,900
Yes.

975
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,100
I came here...
I have something to tell you.

976
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:08,500
If it has something to do with you,
l'm very interested.

977
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,500
It has to do with us.

978
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,900
We can't possible
be serious this early in the morning.

979
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,500
At least not without
a glass of champagne.

980
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:19,300
Won't take a minute.

981
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:23,100
Champagne tastes much better
after midnight, don't you think?

982
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,100
Much better.

983
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,700
I've just came back from America.

984
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,500
It's a fascinating country.

985
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:30,000
The men are fond of money.

986
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,900
And their wives... are fond of Europeans.

987
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,700
Must have been a wonderful trip?

988
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:39,700
Have you travelled a great deal?

989
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:45,200
I couldn't get
you out of my mind all day.

990
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,200
No, I don't believe you.

991
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,300
If I only knew you're coming...

992
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,600
To tell you the truth,

993
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,500
I never dared to hope
that you could arranged it so soon.

994
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,900
But you're so clever,
you managed so beautifully.

995
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:00,400
You know, you're a very strange woman.

996
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,600
Am I?

997
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:07,300
Something you've said last night,
it keeps running through my mind.

998
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:09,000
What was that?

999
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:13,800
I'll tell you in just a moment
as soon as I get the ice.

1000
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,800
Are you getting lonely out there?

1001
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:20,100
Very lonely.

1002
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,500
"I come to tell you about us."

1003
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,400
"To offer you my whole life."

1004
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:36,700
"But you didn't even remember me."

1005
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,800
Can I take you somewhere, young lady?

1006
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,800
Anywhere at all?

1007
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,900
It makes no difference.

1008
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:48,100
"I don't remember where I went."

1009
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,300
"Time will pass me."

1010
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,600
"Not in days, or in hours."

1011
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,100
"But in the distance
that put between us."

1012
01:20:57,100 --> 01:21:00,500
"Now I think again.
I went to my son."

1013
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:03,300
"But it was too late."

1014
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:06,900
"He died last night of typhus."

1015
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,600
"Without even knowing I was there."

1016
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,200
"Now I'm all alone."

1017
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:17,300
"My head throbs,
and my temples are burning."

1018
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:23,000
"Perhaps God has been kind.
and I too have caught the fever."

1019
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,300
"If this letter reaches you,
believe this..."

1020
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:31,500
"That I love you now as
I've always loved you."

1021
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,800
"My life can be measured...

1022
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,200
"By the moments
that I've had with you and our child."

1023
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:41,000
"If only you could've shared
those moments."

1024
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:45,300
"If only you could've recognized
what was always yours."

1025
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,800
"Could've found what was never lost."

1026
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,900
"If only..."

1027
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:40,200
You remembered her?

1028
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:02,700
Lisa...

1029
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:08,400
Lisa...

1030
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:48,000
Bring my things.

1031
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:20,300
Ready, gentleman?

1032
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,200
"If only you could've recognized
what was always yours."

1033
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:33,500
"Could've found what was never lost..."
