1
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:47,522
Then... You've
made up your mind?

2
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:49,692
You are going through with it?

3
00:01:50,683 --> 00:01:51,325
Why not?

4
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,727
For one thing, he's
an excellent chap.

5
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:56,430
At least try to get some sleep.

6
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:59,158
And if I were you,
no more cognac.

7
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,361
We'll come for you at five.
It'd give you three hours.

8
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:03,062
You will be here.

9
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:05,639
I don't mind so
much being killed.

10
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,674
But you know how hard it is for
me to get up in the morning.

11
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:11,414
Good night.

12
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:14,585
Good night.

13
00:02:18,525 --> 00:02:22,927
I'm afraid this time, Stefan has
picked a fight with the wrong man

14
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:28,259
I wonder if he'll be
here when we come back?

15
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:29,263
Who is it?

16
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:30,230
Brand.

17
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:35,406
Good morning, Mr. Brand.

18
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:51,118
Cheer up, John.

19
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:54,522
This is one engagement that I
have no intention of keeping.

20
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:58,220
Honor is a luxury, only
gentlemen can afford.

21
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,167
Pack my things...

22
00:03:00,202 --> 00:03:05,936
Whatever you think that I'll
need for an indefinite stay.

23
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:08,109
I have a cab downstairs...

24
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:12,974
In about an hour, I'll
go out the back way.

25
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:19,121
I'm sorry. I won't be
here to see their faces.

26
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:27,229
Did this come during the night?

27
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:33,204
Would you bring me some coffee...
with cognac?

28
00:04:37,705 --> 00:04:42,643
"By the time you read this
letter, I may be dead."

29
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:47,471
"I have so much to tell you,
perhaps very little time."

30
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:49,275
"Will I ever send it?"

31
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:53,455
"I don't know."

32
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:59,588
"I must find the strength to
write, now before it's too late."

33
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:04,491
"And as I write, it may become
clear that what happened to us"

34
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:09,197
"...had its own reason beyond
our poor understanding."

35
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,964
"If this reaches you..."

36
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,039
"You'll know how I
became yours..."

37
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:18,080
"When you didn't know who I
was, or even that I existed."

38
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:23,221
"I think everyone has two birthdays.
The day of his physical birth..."

39
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,892
"... and the beginning
of his conscious life."

40
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:29,426
"Nothing is vivid...
or really my memory."

41
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,461
"Before that day in spring..."

42
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:32,629
"When I came home from school,"

43
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:38,971
"And found a moving van in
front of our building."

44
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,186
"I wondered about our
new neighbour..."

45
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,659
"Who owned such
beautiful things."

46
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,732
Lisa! Come in, Lisa!

47
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:08,600
Come in this minute,
did you hear?

48
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:10,267
Lisa!

49
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:13,441
Yes, mother.

50
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:17,272
Who is going to clean that up?

51
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:18,639
Me. I suppose.

52
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:22,951
I haven't enough to do.

53
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:25,019
You better get another rope.

54
00:06:25,254 --> 00:06:25,688
Uh?

55
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:27,250
You better get another rope.

56
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:29,652
Alright!

57
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:31,928
Get another rope!

58
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:33,930
This is the last time
I move a musician.

59
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:40,105
Why does he have
to play the piano?

60
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,679
Where do these go?

61
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:51,014
What?

62
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:57,621
In the study.

63
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:04,121
Thank you.

64
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:06,457
Lisa, what are you
doing out there?

65
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:09,635
Come inside.

66
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,053
"I didn't see you that day, or
from many days there after."

67
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:34,959
"But I could listen
to your playing."

68
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,926
I wish he'd stop that noise.

69
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:05,236
It's not noise.

70
00:08:05,438 --> 00:08:09,636
Don't bite my head off.
Mr. Brand is playing.

71
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:10,400
You called that playing?

72
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:13,545
Shh...

73
00:08:22,522 --> 00:08:24,115
How old is he?

74
00:08:24,324 --> 00:08:27,043
Who?

75
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:29,763
Him!

76
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:31,856
Quite old, I guess.

77
00:08:32,233 --> 00:08:34,224
Oh.

78
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:36,800
You know the boy I was talking
to outside the school?

79
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:40,629
The bony one with the yellow
hair and the long nose.

80
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,141
One who lives next
to the grocery.

81
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:44,711
I'm gonna do something
about it...

82
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:48,849
If he doesn稚 keep his
hands to himself.

83
00:08:49,217 --> 00:08:54,554
These things he does,
right out in the street.

84
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:38,903
Thank you, John.
I'll be home later.

85
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:51,251
Thank you.

86
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:54,755
Good morning.

87
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:11,304
Why, Lisa! You're all
red in the face.

88
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:13,737
You're blushing!

89
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,377
I'll get you for that!

90
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:18,604
"Yes, I was blushing."

91
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:21,511
"And hard as it may be
for you to realize..."

92
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:26,247
"From that moment on, I
was in love with you."

93
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:29,891
"Quite consciously, I was
preparing myself for you."

94
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,891
"I kept my clothes neater, so
you wouldn't be ashamed of me."

95
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:37,266
Bow, two three four...

96
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:38,928
"I went to dancing school."

97
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:44,901
"I wanted to become more graceful,
and learn good manners for you."

98
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:49,577
Bow... two three, and
one two three...

99
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:53,718
And one two three...

100
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,983
"So I would know more about
you, and your world..."

101
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,586
"I went to the library..."

102
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:06,766
"And study the lifes of great
musicians of the past."

103
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,846
"Though I was not able
to go to your concerts,"

104
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:27,155
"I found ways of sharing
in your success."

105
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:41,330
"As months went by, I began
to know your friends."

106
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:47,477
"Many of them are women.
Most of them."

107
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:51,528
Lisa!

108
00:11:54,584 --> 00:11:55,517
Lisa!

109
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:59,655
Where are you, Lisa?

110
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:08,399
Aren't you going to
finish your dinner?

111
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:12,008
Sorry, mother.

112
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:21,645
"But I really lived for those
evenings when you're alone."

113
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:27,787
"And I pretended that you're
playing just for me."

114
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:43,934
"I know you didn't know it..."

115
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:50,244
"You're giving me some of the
happiest hours of my life."

116
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:13,192
"Then came a great day for me."

117
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,164
"In the building
where we lived..."

118
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:21,342
"... Thursday was
rug-beating day."

119
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:27,943
Come on, let's help him!

120
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:29,715
Oh! I've got to do my own.

121
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:37,450
I'll do it for you afterwards.
Come on!

122
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:40,629
Remember what you've promised!

123
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,764
I will.

124
00:14:48,337 --> 00:14:51,238
Beautiful rug.

125
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,465
It's a beautiful rug, isn't it?

126
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:53,801
Oh, it's just a rug.

127
00:14:54,011 --> 00:14:57,947
Oh, you wouldn't know.

128
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,245
Say, what are we doing this for?

129
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,816
Shh! He will hear you.

130
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,353
Oh, he can't talk.

131
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:10,392
Well, he can hear, can't he?

132
00:15:16,301 --> 00:15:18,565
You're welcome.

133
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:19,897
Come on, Lisa.

134
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:21,170
I'll be right down.

135
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:22,396
What are you going to do?

136
00:15:22,974 --> 00:15:23,870
Go away, I'll be right down.

137
00:15:24,243 --> 00:15:25,174
What are you going to do?

138
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:28,938
Go away, or I'll throw
you downstairs.

139
00:15:29,315 --> 00:15:32,250
Are you crazy?

140
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:42,590
Lisa!

141
00:17:45,761 --> 00:17:48,458
What are you doing up there?

142
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:51,792
Come dear, I've
something to tell you.

143
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:55,467
It's really good news.

144
00:17:55,672 --> 00:18:02,875
If you think about it sensibly,
you'll be very very happy.

145
00:18:04,052 --> 00:18:06,216
Sit down.

146
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:19,553
I can understand that you
must've been startled...

147
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,426
When you saw Herr Kastner
and me in the hall.

148
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:27,469
Perhaps it's my fault for not telling
you something about it before...

149
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:31,665
You see, dear, your
mother is not really old.

150
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:32,936
She can have admirers, too.

151
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:38,377
She can even... well,
be in love with a man.

152
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:43,805
Someday you'll understand
better what that means.

153
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:47,393
You know how hard it is for us to
get along on my small pension.

154
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,619
Herr Kastner has a comfortable
business in Linz.

155
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,925
A military tailor.

156
00:18:54,106 --> 00:18:59,239
And he's done me the honor
of asking to marry him.

157
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:03,623
Besides, he is a kind man,
and he likes you very much.

158
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:06,538
I'm sure with his help, it'll
be much easier for you to...

159
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:09,274
Mother!

160
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:10,314
What is it?

161
00:19:10,553 --> 00:19:11,814
Would we have to go to Linz?

162
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:13,917
Would we have to live there?

163
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,381
But why not?

164
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:16,854
What is there to keep us here?

165
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:18,351
I won't go!

166
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:19,151
I won't go!

167
00:19:19,396 --> 00:19:20,726
Lisa!

168
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:22,533
What's the matter?

169
00:19:22,631 --> 00:19:24,293
But... what is it?

170
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:25,365
Lisa!

171
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:26,467
I won't go.

172
00:19:27,486 --> 00:19:27,932
I won't go.

173
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:31,364
Now Lisa! Do be reasonable
and tell your mother.

174
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:32,438
I won't! I won't!

175
00:19:32,677 --> 00:19:35,611
Lisa!

176
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:42,512
Let see... We've
eleven altogether.

177
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,954
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven.
Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven.

178
00:19:48,327 --> 00:19:49,258
It comes, Dear.

179
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:50,792
Don't worry, dear. I'll
take care of everything.

180
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:54,226
The adjustment promised
the trunk said that...

181
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:58,164
Oh, either I'd lost half a minute...
or the station parts ahead.

182
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,770
How much would that be, please?

183
00:20:00,512 --> 00:20:00,529
It's up to you, sir.

184
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:02,435
Up to me?

185
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:04,664
One dollar should be enough.

186
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:06,743
The guy promised the trunk
would be here on time.

187
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:07,936
With all the boxes...

188
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:11,375
One. Two. Three. Four.
Five. Six.

189
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:16,249
Uh... how long will it take if we
send them through Linz third class?

190
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:16,980
Two weeks, maybe.

191
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:18,824
Two weeks... very good.

192
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:21,550
Now each of these...
second class.

193
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:22,853
Third class...

194
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,787
Each of these... third class.

195
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:25,728
Yes...

196
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:28,595
Ah... what did I tell you.

197
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:30,464
When you're going to a
thing, do it one time.

198
00:20:30,704 --> 00:20:31,966
That is always nice.

199
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:32,965
Hello. Thank you.

200
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:34,330
You can unload it here.

201
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:35,907
Our train doesn't
leave until 12:00.

202
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,210
Yes, 12:00, darling.

203
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:40,381
The twelve!

204
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,612
Please don't get excited, dear.

205
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:48,758
I'd be calm.

206
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:56,590
"Suddenly I knew I couldn't
live without you."

207
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,697
"I didn't know what I
had in mind, or..."

208
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:01,927
"...what my parents would do
when they found me missing."

209
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:05,536
"All I wanted was to
see you once more."

210
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:11,025
"To throw myself at your feet, cling
to you, and never leave you."

211
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:17,845
"Nothing else. Nothing
else mattered."

212
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:23,755
Alright, alright.

213
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:25,930
Oh, it's you, Lisa.

214
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:29,790
I thought by now that
you're half way to Linz?

215
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:32,568
Didn't your train
leave in about...

216
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:36,438
I forgot something.

217
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:04,733
"These rooms where I'd lived, have
been filled with your music."

218
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:07,429
"Now they were empty."

219
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,049
"Would they ever
come to life again?"

220
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:11,603
"Would I?"

221
00:23:11,811 --> 00:23:13,803
"Only you could answer."

222
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:16,448
"So, I waited."

223
00:23:16,683 --> 00:23:19,619
"Waited..."

224
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,907
"For what seemed endless hours
I sat outside your door..."

225
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:25,617
"Try to keep myself awake."

226
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:29,017
"...afraid that I might
fall asleep and miss you."

227
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:32,615
"Then..."

228
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:36,694
Who is it?

229
00:23:37,412 --> 00:23:37,462
Brand!

230
00:23:37,673 --> 00:23:42,610
Good morning, Mr. Brand.

231
00:24:24,424 --> 00:24:27,255
"And so, there was
nothing left for me."

232
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:31,396
"I went to Linz."

233
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,864
"You who have always
lived so freely..."

234
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,439
"Have you any idea what life's
like in a little garrison town?"

235
00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:47,340
"I was eighteen now..."

236
00:24:47,548 --> 00:24:52,382
"And was expected to take
my place in society."

237
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:55,249
Come now, Lisa. Don't
look down at your feet.

238
00:24:55,457 --> 00:24:57,550
Please be tactful and
let him do the talking.

239
00:24:57,758 --> 00:25:01,836
But not all the talking.
Do you hear me, Lisa?

240
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:02,587
Good morning, Colonel.

241
00:25:02,797 --> 00:25:05,733
Good morning, Colonel.

242
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:08,869
Good morning.

243
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:13,567
Mrs. Kastner, Miss Kastner.
Mr. Kastner.

244
00:25:13,776 --> 00:25:15,861
May I have the honor to
present you my nephew...

245
00:25:15,896 --> 00:25:18,312
Lt. Leopold von Kaltnegger.

246
00:25:18,513 --> 00:25:20,538
I have the honor
to kiss your hand.

247
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,978
Very pleased to make
your acquaintance.

248
00:25:22,352 --> 00:25:22,975
Thank you, Lieutenant.

249
00:25:23,353 --> 00:25:25,787
Mr. Kastner, I have
the honor, Sir.

250
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:27,183
I'm very pleased to
make your acquaintance.

251
00:25:27,906 --> 00:25:28,880
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

252
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:31,318
Allow me to present
our daughter, Lisa.

253
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:35,465
Lt. Leopold von Kaltnegger.

254
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,377
Good morning...

255
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,781
Excuse me.

256
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,920
Do you like it here in Linz?

257
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,990
Quiet well.

258
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,993
It must seemed very restfull
after living in Vienna?

259
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,920
I liked Vienna.

260
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,323
Indeed.

261
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:11,935
What did you like about it?

262
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:13,534
Perhaps you were
fond of the music?

263
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,709
Yes.

264
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,275
We also have good music here.

265
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:22,177
Every other Saturday afternoon they
gave a concert on the Kursalon.

266
00:26:22,383 --> 00:26:23,950
Oh, really?

267
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:26,817
Perhaps someday you'll allow
me the honor to escorting you?

268
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:28,785
Very nice of you.

269
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,515
When I was a cadet, I
took part of myself.

270
00:26:31,726 --> 00:26:32,488
I played second trumpet.

271
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:33,888
Oh, how nice.

272
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:36,787
I must say I'm glad
we both like music.

273
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:43,639
You see there's nothing wrong with a
child if she only meets the right people

274
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:54,270
Up! Up! Up! Up!

275
00:26:54,484 --> 00:26:57,453
Up! Up! Up!

276
00:27:00,656 --> 00:27:01,850
"The Lieutenant was right."

277
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:04,028
"Linz was a musical town."

278
00:27:04,676 --> 00:27:06,555
"So twice a month that
summer we listened..."

279
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:11,598
"The Lieutenant and I."

280
00:27:40,232 --> 00:27:43,429
Before the afternoon is over, I'm
sure we'll hear an announcement

281
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:45,606
Nothing could please
us more, Colonel.

282
00:27:45,805 --> 00:27:50,743
Is that right, my dear?

283
00:27:53,145 --> 00:27:57,679
Miss Lisa, this is a subject which
I wish to bring up for some time

284
00:27:57,886 --> 00:28:02,030
I trust you'd forgive me to presume
the action that I allow myself...

285
00:28:02,065 --> 00:28:03,792
It maybe unnecessary
to mention that...

286
00:28:03,827 --> 00:28:05,520
Ever since you first
came to my attention,

287
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,422
I've been most
favourably impressed.

288
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:08,287
Thank you.

289
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,556
And I believe that your
parents are not opposed...

290
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:13,827
...my keeping company that
is dedicated with you.

291
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:14,725
But, Lieutenant, I...

292
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:17,839
Oh, please allow me to finish.

293
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:20,800
As far as my prospects are
concerned, you must be aware that...

294
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:22,944
It's generally believed
by my uncle and others,

295
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:25,905
That I have qualifications for
an outstanding military career.

296
00:28:26,283 --> 00:28:27,181
It's no doubt of that.

297
00:28:27,384 --> 00:28:29,715
Naturally, it's too soon to
discuss any definite steps.

298
00:28:30,352 --> 00:28:31,409
We should know each other
for a reasonable time...

299
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:31,917
But, Lieutenant...

300
00:28:32,289 --> 00:28:33,755
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

301
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:36,256
It's impossible?

302
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,552
Please allow me to explain.

303
00:28:37,795 --> 00:28:41,196
I must insist. Is
there someone else?

304
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:42,558
Yes.

305
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:43,891
I'm engaged to be married.

306
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:45,634
Engaged to be married?

307
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:47,943
I should've told you before,
but I didn't realize how...

308
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:48,828
But all the time
you've been in Linz,

309
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,235
I haven't seen anyone's company.

310
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:51,876
He doesn't live in Linz.
He lives in Vienna.

311
00:28:52,243 --> 00:28:53,211
In Vienna?

312
00:28:53,412 --> 00:28:55,709
He... he writes music,
he's a musician.

313
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:56,973
But how can that be?

314
00:28:57,349 --> 00:28:59,374
Your mother and father, they gave
my uncle the encouragement...

315
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:00,950
They don't know yet!

316
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:05,223
You're engaged to a man, and your
parents don't even know him?

317
00:29:06,307 --> 00:29:06,517
Um...

318
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:10,162
I'm sorry, I...

319
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:13,230
Then, please.

320
00:29:15,736 --> 00:29:21,676
Waiter, the wine. The wine.

321
00:29:30,843 --> 00:29:33,814
Up! Up!

322
00:29:58,506 --> 00:29:59,097
But I don't understand.

323
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:02,504
Lisa, sit down. What happened?

324
00:30:02,877 --> 00:30:03,138
Nothing.

325
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:05,340
But you must've said something.

326
00:30:05,548 --> 00:30:06,276
What did you say to him?

327
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:08,177
I only told him the truth.

328
00:30:08,418 --> 00:30:10,511
The truth! What do
you mean the truth?

329
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:12,219
What did you say to him?

330
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:15,653
I told him, I wasn't free.

331
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:16,855
What...?

332
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,257
"My poor parents, for
them this was the end."

333
00:30:20,463 --> 00:30:26,404
"For me, it was a
new beginning."

334
00:30:26,938 --> 00:30:29,268
"Vienna, when I saw it again,"

335
00:30:30,356 --> 00:30:32,135
"seemed to have taken
on a new splendour."

336
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:34,344
"All the time I've been away,"

337
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:37,207
"I thought longingly,
it's your city."

338
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:40,508
"Now, it was our city."

339
00:30:40,718 --> 00:30:43,052
"Madam Spitzer's
where I found work."

340
00:30:43,254 --> 00:30:46,691
"It's the kind of establishment
where one learns many things."

341
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:48,458
Miss Lisa, please.

342
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,629
Coming.

343
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,607
Hold your breath.

344
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:08,914
Miss Lisa, we're waiting.

345
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:19,224
Very pretty.

346
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:22,179
Yes.

347
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,932
Very.

348
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:52,059
Very charming. Very
charming, indeed.

349
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:52,989
Do you think...

350
00:31:53,197 --> 00:31:56,064
She is not like the others, I
don't understand that girl...

351
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:57,233
But every evening,

352
00:31:57,433 --> 00:32:01,303
As soon as these shutters are
closed, off she goes straight home.

353
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:04,440
Really?

354
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:10,179
"Madam Spitzer spoke the truth."

355
00:32:10,415 --> 00:32:12,611
"I was not like the others."

356
00:32:12,984 --> 00:32:16,579
"Nobody waited for me."

357
00:32:16,955 --> 00:32:19,651
"Off I went, not home..."

358
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:24,463
"But to the only place that
it ever seemed home to me."

359
00:32:24,664 --> 00:32:30,069
"Night after night, I
returned to the same spot."

360
00:32:30,104 --> 00:32:35,475
"But you never noticed me...
until one evening."

361
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:52,921
I've seen you before,
few nights ago.

362
00:33:53,126 --> 00:33:56,583
Right here. Or...
you live near here?

363
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,931
No.

364
00:34:00,132 --> 00:34:02,602
You like to listen to
the street singers?

365
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:04,163
Um... yes.

366
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,306
Neither do I.

367
00:34:10,678 --> 00:34:11,677
I should introduce myself.

368
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:16,646
No. I know who you are.

369
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:29,738
I suppose sooner or later, we
have to decide where we're walk

370
00:34:29,773 --> 00:34:32,059
I have something I
should call off.

371
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:38,208
I'd never get to the place
where I start out for, anyway.

372
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:18,982
Pardon.

373
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,482
Excuse me.

374
00:35:21,688 --> 00:35:22,950
Very charming.

375
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:23,621
Thank you.

376
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,736
Anything else I can do
for you, Mr. Brand?

377
00:35:25,925 --> 00:35:26,913
Will you please tell Bowlish,

378
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,993
I won't be at the
rehearsal this evening.

379
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:31,925
Congratulations.

380
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:34,292
Fritz, is that
gentleman free now?

381
00:35:34,502 --> 00:35:35,264
Just moment, sir.

382
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,437
Don't you see I'm
busy with Mr. Brand?

383
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:41,903
Now... how about Lily?

384
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:43,871
If she comes, how am
I going to tell her?

385
00:35:44,077 --> 00:35:45,305
Well, tell her...

386
00:35:45,512 --> 00:35:49,142
I'll tell her... It was most
important and you had to work.

387
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,282
Yes, that's it. That's fine.

388
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:51,280
I'm sure she will understand.

389
00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:51,951
I'm sure.

390
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:52,481
Thank you.

391
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:54,278
Bye.

392
00:35:54,522 --> 00:35:58,151
Stefan, I missed you yesterday.
I have to talk with you.

393
00:35:58,359 --> 00:35:59,191
Later.

394
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:02,628
I saw the ? group at the conerto.
It's a young man I met...

395
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:05,693
His father owns half of the...

396
00:36:06,068 --> 00:36:10,095
I thought it was something
for one of your concerts.

397
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:10,536
If you just go outside...

398
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:11,866
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

399
00:36:12,074 --> 00:36:15,043
Tomorrow...

400
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:32,619
Now, don't be frightened.

401
00:36:32,996 --> 00:36:36,864
If it's not to becoming, the
lobster would have no intention.

402
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,092
I was wrong. It is becoming.

403
00:36:39,303 --> 00:36:42,466
Let's see, when do they
have lobster again?

404
00:36:42,674 --> 00:36:44,335
Friday. How about Friday?

405
00:36:44,541 --> 00:36:46,305
A week is a long time.

406
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,877
How about Wednesday.
That's pheasant.

407
00:36:49,114 --> 00:36:50,547
They have pheasant on Monday.

408
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:52,441
Could you possibly
make it on Monday?

409
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,176
I've no engagement at all.

410
00:36:55,386 --> 00:36:58,618
I've none, either. We'll
have dinner tomorrow night.

411
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,050
Wiener Schnitzel.

412
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:03,594
Excuse me, Mr. Brand. The
lady in the next room,

413
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,929
If I'm not mistaken, it's
The Countess Newesky.

414
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:09,659
Would you sign her the program
of this afternoon's concert?

415
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:11,002
Certainly.

416
00:37:11,037 --> 00:37:14,269
She said, Mozart himself
could not have done better.

417
00:37:14,304 --> 00:37:16,166
How nice of her.

418
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:16,970
There you are.

419
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:18,270
Thank the Countess
for the compliment.

420
00:37:18,478 --> 00:37:19,444
Thank you, Mr. Braun.

421
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:21,448
The note is not the
least she deserves.

422
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:23,845
Four years ago when you
played the D Minor.

423
00:37:24,051 --> 00:37:25,039
You remember that?

424
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,185
The morning review, also.

425
00:37:27,387 --> 00:37:28,411
Compare too young Mozart.

426
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:32,559
I was very young.

427
00:37:34,997 --> 00:37:37,932
You like it?

428
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:40,162
Valpolicelli, it's called.

429
00:37:40,369 --> 00:37:44,032
First thing you see when you come
down the other side of the Alps.

430
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,503
The Italians say, it
is such a good wine,

431
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,605
Because the grapes have
their roots in the valley,

432
00:37:49,978 --> 00:37:52,242
And their eyes on the mountains.

433
00:37:52,448 --> 00:37:53,176
Please...

434
00:37:53,383 --> 00:37:55,374
Please what?

435
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:58,488
Please talk about yourself.

436
00:37:58,688 --> 00:38:03,091
I believe you really want
to hear about me. Why?

437
00:38:03,294 --> 00:38:05,454
Uh, never mind why.

438
00:38:05,696 --> 00:38:09,530
The truth is, I've had
rather an easy time of it.

439
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:12,896
People accepted my
music very quickly.

440
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:15,264
Perhaps too quickly.

441
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:20,137
Sometimes it's easier to
please others than oneself.

442
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:22,245
What're you going to say?

443
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:24,108
You know you don't
talk very much.

444
00:38:24,316 --> 00:38:26,444
Well... I can't say it very well.
But...

445
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:28,177
Yes.

446
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:30,981
Sometimes, I felt when
you're playing that...

447
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:33,090
Go on.

448
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:39,231
That... you haven't quite found
what you're looking for.

449
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,162
How long have you been
hiding in my piano?

450
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,339
Uh, never mind explaining.

451
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:49,100
I just assume
you're a sorceress,

452
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:53,211
And that you can make
yourself very tiny.

453
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:56,678
It might be a good thing to
have a sorceress for a friend.

454
00:38:57,051 --> 00:38:59,917
Who knows?

455
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:06,060
You maybe able to
help me someday.

456
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:14,230
How could I help you?

457
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:17,600
So, that's what
you've been thinking?

458
00:39:17,973 --> 00:39:20,307
You're a very strange girl.

459
00:39:20,509 --> 00:39:23,876
Who ever you are, where
ever you came from...

460
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,171
Don't you have any problems?

461
00:39:25,503 --> 00:39:29,318
Not... important ones.

462
00:39:33,256 --> 00:39:38,854
It's been a long while since
anyone did that for me?

463
00:39:39,096 --> 00:39:39,960
Stop here, please.

464
00:39:40,164 --> 00:39:43,512
Woo... Ah.

465
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:48,468
Good evening, Mr. Brand.

466
00:39:48,674 --> 00:39:50,336
Good evening.

467
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:50,973
Roses?

468
00:39:51,175 --> 00:39:52,143
Yes. Please.

469
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:52,934
Nice red ones?

470
00:39:53,144 --> 00:40:00,791
No. Red is the wrong color. I think a
single white rose would be perfect.

471
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:02,553
This is a special occasion.

472
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:03,547
Here you are. Good night.

473
00:40:03,922 --> 00:40:05,356
Good night, Mr. Brand.

474
00:40:05,558 --> 00:40:09,494
Enjoy yourself.

475
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:10,957
Did I guess right?

476
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:12,597
Is it your flower?

477
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:15,593
From now on it will be.

478
00:40:15,969 --> 00:40:17,459
Would you like me to close it?

479
00:40:17,705 --> 00:40:18,433
No.

480
00:40:19,436 --> 00:40:24,578
Hah... and now to the park.

481
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:42,355
Do you think it
would all be close?

482
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:45,499
I hope not.

483
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:48,663
I never come here in the season.

484
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:51,234
It's more pleasant in the winter.
I don't know why.

485
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,429
It's perhaps...

486
00:40:52,643 --> 00:40:55,440
Because you prefer to imagine
how it will be in the spring.

487
00:40:55,645 --> 00:40:59,206
Because if it's spring, then it's
nothing to imagine and to wish for.

488
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:02,097
Is there anything about
me you don't know?

489
00:41:02,132 --> 00:41:02,607
A few things.

490
00:41:02,986 --> 00:41:04,544
For instance, one
thing I don't know,

491
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:07,553
If one day they would make a wax
figure of you and put you in there.

492
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:10,158
Because you'll be so famous.

493
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:14,320
Well, if they do, will you pay
your penny to come in and see me?

494
00:41:14,532 --> 00:41:18,468
If you come alive.

495
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:30,408
Now I see you as a little girl.

496
00:41:30,616 --> 00:41:33,551
You do?

497
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:37,318
When my father was alive,
we travelled a lot.

498
00:41:37,523 --> 00:41:38,989
He went nearly everywhere.

499
00:41:39,024 --> 00:41:40,455
We've had a wonderful time.

500
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,184
I didn't know you
travelled so much.

501
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:43,488
Oh, yes.

502
00:41:43,696 --> 00:41:46,582
Perhaps we've been in
some of the same places.

503
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:48,075
No, I don't think so.

504
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,468
Where did you go?

505
00:41:49,503 --> 00:41:51,470
Well, it was a long time. But...

506
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:53,606
For instance, there
was Rio de Janeiro.

507
00:41:53,974 --> 00:41:56,874
Beautiful, exotic, real
with its botanical garden.

508
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:59,469
Its Avenue palms,
Sugarloaf fountain,

509
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:04,243
And the harbour where you can look
down and see the flying fishes...

510
00:42:04,453 --> 00:42:05,078
We're in Venice.

511
00:42:05,286 --> 00:42:06,220
Yes, we've arrived.

512
00:42:06,421 --> 00:42:09,686
Where would you like to go next?
France? England? Russia?

513
00:42:10,058 --> 00:42:10,353
Switzerland.

514
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,048
Switzerland.

515
00:42:11,724 --> 00:42:17,166
Excuse me a moment while I
talk with the engineer.

516
00:42:19,636 --> 00:42:21,432
You and the lady, are
you enjoying the trip?

517
00:42:21,984 --> 00:42:25,437
Very much. We're off
to Switzerland.

518
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:26,437
There you go. Thank you.

519
00:42:26,676 --> 00:42:29,406
Oh... thank you.

520
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:31,945
Switzerland.

521
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,309
Switzerland.

522
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,452
Switzerland.

523
00:42:57,042 --> 00:43:01,138
So, you're looking down at
the flying fish. Then what?

524
00:43:01,348 --> 00:43:03,482
Aren't you going to
finish the trip?

525
00:43:03,517 --> 00:43:05,684
Well, there weren't any
trips, do you mind?

526
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:08,482
You see, my father had a
friend in the travel bureau.

527
00:43:08,688 --> 00:43:09,951
My father worked
across the street.

528
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:13,023
He was an assistant super
attendant of the municipal water?

529
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:18,027
And he used to bring photos
home with pictures in them.

530
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:19,664
And in the evening, he'd put
on his travelling coat.

531
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:22,332
That's what he called it,
'Cause I was very young.

532
00:43:22,537 --> 00:43:24,128
And he'd say: where should
we go this evening?

533
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:27,671
And I would say: Vera Cruz.
Because it's a beautiful name.

534
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:30,408
And then he would say: um...
it's summer there,

535
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:33,136
You don't want to roast
like a coffee bean, do you?

536
00:43:33,348 --> 00:43:34,575
So, you never did get there?

537
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:37,646
No. It's just like I tripped the
land with the midnight sun.

538
00:43:38,053 --> 00:43:39,019
What stopped you this time?

539
00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:39,983
The weather.

540
00:43:40,222 --> 00:43:40,984
I thought of India.

541
00:43:41,188 --> 00:43:43,521
But then father remembered
it was the raining season.

542
00:43:43,725 --> 00:43:45,454
Your father was an
expert on climates.

543
00:43:45,661 --> 00:43:46,525
My mother used to say that...

544
00:43:46,729 --> 00:43:50,689
He knew what the weather was
everywhere except home.

545
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:51,692
What mountain was that?

546
00:43:52,068 --> 00:43:53,968
That's the Matterhorn.

547
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,262
You've climbed it?

548
00:43:56,003 --> 00:43:56,437
Um hum.

549
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:59,608
Tell me when you've climbed
up the mountain, what then?

550
00:44:01,311 --> 00:44:07,251
Well, you come down again.

551
00:44:10,955 --> 00:44:14,436
Tell me more about your father.

552
00:44:14,471 --> 00:44:17,918
Well, then he finally
did go away.

553
00:44:18,129 --> 00:44:19,562
He had the nicest eyes.

554
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:23,162
Yes, I can see them.

555
00:44:23,368 --> 00:44:25,599
Why do you like to
climb mountains?

556
00:44:25,972 --> 00:44:27,405
Well, I suppose because,

557
00:44:27,606 --> 00:44:31,141
No matter how high you climb,
there's always a higher one.

558
00:44:31,176 --> 00:44:33,645
And you like to imagine that the
other one is even more wonderful.

559
00:44:34,014 --> 00:44:34,411
Like the spring in the park.

560
00:44:34,647 --> 00:44:36,046
You know far too much
about me already,

561
00:44:36,249 --> 00:44:39,150
And I know almost
nothing about you

562
00:44:39,352 --> 00:44:44,154
Except you have
travelled a great deal.

563
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:49,192
End of the line. All change.

564
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:52,331
All change.

565
00:45:03,064 --> 00:45:03,469
What now?

566
00:45:03,678 --> 00:45:04,736
Where haven't we been?

567
00:45:05,113 --> 00:45:07,047
We have no more countries left.

568
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:09,478
Then we'll begin all over again.

569
00:45:09,718 --> 00:45:13,449
There you are. Thank you.

570
00:45:13,655 --> 00:45:17,615
We'll revisit the
scenes of your youth.

571
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:48,191
I don't know about them
but I'm going home.

572
00:45:48,394 --> 00:45:49,256
Right after this number.

573
00:45:49,461 --> 00:45:52,487
Me too, if he is not
paying me 50 quarters.

574
00:45:52,731 --> 00:46:00,228
I'd like to play for married people.
They've got homes.

575
00:46:10,515 --> 00:46:12,450
You're sorceress.

576
00:46:12,652 --> 00:46:17,181
Now I'm sure, how else
could we dance this way.

577
00:46:17,658 --> 00:46:20,923
Unless we've danced
together before.

578
00:46:21,128 --> 00:46:27,068
And yet if we had,
should I remember it.

579
00:46:33,074 --> 00:46:36,456
Please.

580
00:47:11,248 --> 00:47:12,409
Promise me something.

581
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:15,211
Anything.

582
00:47:15,453 --> 00:47:17,922
But I don't even
know where you live.

583
00:47:18,123 --> 00:47:20,522
Promise me you won't vanish.

584
00:47:20,725 --> 00:47:26,665
I won't be the one who vanishes.

585
00:47:50,623 --> 00:47:51,282
We're here.

586
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:54,461
Thank you.

587
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:08,442
Thank you.

588
00:48:17,452 --> 00:48:18,351
Who is it?

589
00:48:18,555 --> 00:48:19,486
Brand.

590
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:24,626
Good morning, Mr. Brand.

591
00:49:07,814 --> 00:49:11,273
Please be seated.

592
00:49:11,486 --> 00:49:14,580
Lisa, leave it on.
Someone wants to see it.

593
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,380
Oh.

594
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:21,530
Real customer. Looks
like a good one.

595
00:49:22,645 --> 00:49:25,062
One moment.

596
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:34,942
You'll like this one, I'm sure.
I'm sure.

597
00:49:36,546 --> 00:49:41,540
I like it very much.
Very much.

598
00:49:41,751 --> 00:49:43,310
How did you find me?

599
00:49:43,553 --> 00:49:45,077
I'm a good detective,
what you think?

600
00:49:45,456 --> 00:49:49,288
You are.

601
00:49:54,711 --> 00:49:59,382
I'm afraid we have to put
off our play for tonight.

602
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:01,734
I couldn't go away
without seeing you.

603
00:50:02,427 --> 00:50:03,032
Where are you going?

604
00:50:03,141 --> 00:50:04,438
Milano.

605
00:50:04,643 --> 00:50:08,340
The whole orchestra is going.
We go to play at L'escala.

606
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,879
It's wonderful.

607
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:14,052
I've forgotten all about it.

608
00:50:14,952 --> 00:50:16,979
It won't be long.
Just two weeks.

609
00:50:17,357 --> 00:50:19,416
The train leaves at 5:30.

610
00:50:19,738 --> 00:50:22,924
Do you suppose you
could see me off?

611
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,062
I'll try.

612
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:30,768
I'll look for you then.
Good bye. Thank you.

613
00:50:32,005 --> 00:50:37,945
Good-bye. You will be there.

614
00:50:38,513 --> 00:50:40,593
How did it go?

615
00:50:40,682 --> 00:50:42,047
He wasn't interested
in the suit.

616
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:45,580
But... Madam, could I leave
a bit earlier today?

617
00:50:45,787 --> 00:50:48,585
How early? About 5:00.

618
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:51,521
Yes. Sure.

619
00:50:51,726 --> 00:50:52,887
Thank you, Madam.

620
00:50:53,094 --> 00:50:58,032
Congratulations, my dear.

621
00:51:18,656 --> 00:51:23,457
Stefan, the train is leaving.
Just a minute.

622
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,564
How long have you
been standing here?

623
00:51:27,766 --> 00:51:31,360
I don't want to go.
Do you believe that?

624
00:51:31,982 --> 00:51:33,128
I'll be here when you get back.

625
00:51:33,504 --> 00:51:33,904
Come on.

626
00:51:34,106 --> 00:51:37,404
Yes. Stefan, hurry, please.

627
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:40,602
I still know so
little about you.

628
00:51:40,813 --> 00:51:44,682
You like mystery.

629
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:48,376
That a woman like you
exist, and I found you.

630
00:51:48,587 --> 00:51:51,523
That's mystery to me.

631
00:51:51,724 --> 00:51:55,854
Say "Stefan", the way
you said it last night.

632
00:51:56,063 --> 00:51:58,813
Stefan.

633
00:51:58,898 --> 00:52:00,423
As if you've said
it all your life.

634
00:52:00,635 --> 00:52:01,032
Better hurry, sir.

635
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:03,164
Yes.

636
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,103
Good-bye.

637
00:52:04,138 --> 00:52:08,633
Stefan. Good-bye.

638
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:13,641
Won't be long. I'll
be back in two weeks.

639
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:20,487
Good-bye. Two weeks.

640
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:40,807
"Two weeks... Stefan, how
little you knew of yourself."

641
00:52:41,612 --> 00:52:47,552
"That train was taking
you out of my life."

642
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:27,893
"He was a married man."

643
00:53:28,094 --> 00:53:32,031
"Does he live here in Vienna?"

644
00:53:32,432 --> 00:53:33,832
"If we knew who he was,"

645
00:53:34,035 --> 00:53:39,974
"He might be willing to
accept his responsibility."

646
00:53:41,442 --> 00:53:47,382
You won't tell us his name?

647
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:54,352
But you haven't the means
to take care of the child.

648
00:53:54,556 --> 00:53:58,493
We'll get along.

649
00:53:59,095 --> 00:54:00,997
It's your duty to tell us.

650
00:54:01,032 --> 00:54:01,886
When a man does...

651
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:07,594
I'm feeling tired.
Would you go?

652
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,066
"You may wonder why I never
came to you for help."

653
00:54:13,476 --> 00:54:17,191
"I wanted to be one woman
you've had known,"

654
00:54:17,226 --> 00:54:19,081
"Who had asked you for nothing."

655
00:54:19,747 --> 00:54:23,442
"My deep regret is that
you never saw your son."

656
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:28,615
"There were times during those
years, I prefer not to remember."

657
00:54:28,827 --> 00:54:30,852
"But this I can assure you,"

658
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:36,126
"Whatever the cost, he'd
repaid me a thousand times."

659
00:54:36,501 --> 00:54:39,527
"You'd have been
proud of him, too."

660
00:54:39,771 --> 00:54:41,706
"When he was almost nine."

661
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:45,777
"As much for his sake
as mine, I married."

662
00:54:46,012 --> 00:54:47,912
"You know who my husband is."

663
00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:50,082
"Johann Stauffer
asked to marry me."

664
00:54:50,449 --> 00:54:53,350
"Knowing the truth about
us, and about our child."

665
00:54:53,553 --> 00:54:54,645
Oh. How lovely.

666
00:54:54,888 --> 00:54:57,482
Thank you, Johann.

667
00:54:57,691 --> 00:54:59,724
What a nice birthday!

668
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:01,758
This..., and Stefan home.

669
00:55:01,962 --> 00:55:04,430
You know, I'm not good
at saying such things.

670
00:55:04,631 --> 00:55:08,864
But... Lisa, I want you to be
as happy as you've made be.

671
00:55:09,071 --> 00:55:15,737
If I were really deserving
why, I'll be ready on time.

672
00:55:15,944 --> 00:55:19,091
You are happy?

673
00:55:23,018 --> 00:55:24,713
You are?

674
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:28,856
"Why shouldn't I be?"

675
00:55:30,029 --> 00:55:33,328
Let's say good night.

676
00:55:37,067 --> 00:55:40,525
Is he another talent?

677
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:46,710
He has a lot of talents, but
not for finishing his milk.

678
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,606
Or for brushing his teeth.

679
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:52,043
Made in Switzerland.

680
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:55,578
Switzerland must be a very
nice place, don't you think?

681
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,847
Who gave it to you, darling?

682
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:57,818
Herr Frank.

683
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:58,954
Who's Herr Frank?

684
00:55:59,157 --> 00:56:00,124
His music teacher.

685
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:02,483
He said that he thinks that
I've a natural talent.

686
00:56:03,075 --> 00:56:03,855
For harmonica?

687
00:56:04,062 --> 00:56:06,428
No. For music.

688
00:56:06,632 --> 00:56:09,430
Oh.

689
00:56:09,635 --> 00:56:10,623
Good night, Stefan.

690
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:13,932
Good night, Sir.

691
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:15,072
Good night, darling.

692
00:56:15,441 --> 00:56:19,688
Good night, mother.

693
00:56:22,116 --> 00:56:22,706
Mother!

694
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:23,881
Yes!

695
00:56:24,118 --> 00:56:28,053
I'll be right back.

696
00:56:29,423 --> 00:56:32,017
You remember the last time, first
night I was home from school.

697
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:33,416
Um-hum, what about it?

698
00:56:33,627 --> 00:56:36,653
When you went out, you let
me sleep in your room.

699
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:36,826
Alright.

700
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:39,465
It's a special concession because
it's your first night home.

701
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:43,603
But hurry. I'm late.

702
00:56:47,075 --> 00:56:49,942
In just a minute.
There's no hurry.

703
00:56:50,146 --> 00:56:51,408
Good night, Sir.

704
00:56:51,646 --> 00:56:54,582
Good night.

705
00:56:58,788 --> 00:57:00,620
You know, Stefan, it
might be nicer...

706
00:57:00,823 --> 00:57:04,020
If you could say "Good night,
father!"instead of Жood night, Sir"

707
00:57:04,393 --> 00:57:05,827
But I've always
said it that way.

708
00:57:06,062 --> 00:57:09,221
I think he'd like it if you
could manage to change it.

709
00:57:09,256 --> 00:57:10,759
Suppose you said to me
"Good night, Madam."

710
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:13,527
It would sound pretty
silly, wouldn't it?

711
00:57:13,737 --> 00:57:16,433
Now, promise me you'd go to
sleep, and not wait up for me.

712
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:17,608
I promise.

713
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:19,470
Would you bring me the
program of the opera?

714
00:57:19,677 --> 00:57:22,612
I promise.

715
00:57:23,848 --> 00:57:25,679
Good night, Madam.

716
00:57:25,884 --> 00:57:27,579
Good night, Sir.

717
00:57:27,785 --> 00:57:30,914
After all when a person treats
you so much like his son,

718
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,851
he is in a sense your father.

719
00:57:33,058 --> 00:57:35,118
Alright, mother, if you say so.

720
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:38,463
Good night.

721
00:57:47,344 --> 00:57:51,636
"The course of our lives can be
changed by such little things"

722
00:57:51,846 --> 00:57:57,229
"So many passing by, each
intent on his own problems."

723
00:57:57,264 --> 00:58:02,452
"So many faces, that one
might be easily lost."

724
00:58:03,069 --> 00:58:07,116
"I know now. Nothing
happens by chance."

725
00:58:07,528 --> 00:58:14,298
"Every moment is measured.
Every step is counted."

726
00:58:14,502 --> 00:58:16,367
Curtain. Curtain going up.

727
00:58:16,571 --> 00:58:17,367
Second act.

728
00:58:17,572 --> 00:58:22,807
Curtain going up. Second act.

729
00:58:23,011 --> 00:58:25,344
Look! Isn't that Stefan Brand?

730
00:58:25,845 --> 00:58:27,912
He played last week. Is
that a concert tour?

731
00:58:28,117 --> 00:58:29,984
Pleasure trip, most likely.

732
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:36,686
The way he's burning himself up,
it's a wonder he's still alive.

733
00:58:36,894 --> 00:58:39,795
Ten years ago, he
showed great promise.

734
00:58:39,997 --> 00:58:41,089
Too bad.

735
00:58:41,498 --> 00:58:44,524
With that talent, he could've
been a great pianist.

736
00:58:44,736 --> 00:58:46,567
Perhaps talent is not enough.

737
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:49,137
Perhaps he's have
too many talents.

738
00:58:49,507 --> 00:58:50,371
Second act!

739
00:58:50,574 --> 00:58:54,512
Curtain going up!

740
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,902
Sorry.

741
00:59:06,113 --> 00:59:07,010
We're late.

742
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:10,012
You know the colonel Kohner...

743
00:59:10,216 --> 00:59:11,912
Everyone is asking for you.

744
00:59:12,118 --> 00:59:12,983
You've made a conquest.

745
00:59:13,186 --> 00:59:19,127
My dear, you should
have joined us.

746
00:59:39,193 --> 00:59:42,413
"Suddenly, in that one moment."

747
00:59:42,618 --> 00:59:44,608
"Everything was in danger."

748
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,615
"Everything I thought was safe."

749
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:54,396
"Somewhere out there were your eyes.
And I knew I couldn't escape them."

750
00:59:54,597 --> 00:59:57,192
"It's like the first
time I saw you."

751
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:03,188
"The years between
were melting away."

752
01:00:03,273 --> 01:00:03,968
I have a headache.

753
01:00:04,675 --> 01:00:05,641
No. Please don't worry.

754
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:11,380
I'll be alright.
Please stay here.

755
01:00:24,496 --> 01:00:26,293
Would you be kind enough to
give my husband a message.

756
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:27,910
He's in 17. Not now.

757
01:00:27,945 --> 01:00:29,322
But after the show.

758
01:00:29,536 --> 01:00:31,662
Tell him, I've decided to go home.
Tell him not to worry.

759
01:00:32,038 --> 01:00:34,973
Thank you.

760
01:00:44,985 --> 01:00:46,009
Call my carriage, please.

761
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,688
Yes, Madam.

762
01:00:49,056 --> 01:00:49,489
Sergeant!

763
01:00:49,723 --> 01:00:52,659
Yes, Madam.

764
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:23,991
Excuse me.

765
01:01:24,227 --> 01:01:26,388
You must realized that
where there's a pursuit.

766
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:29,031
And there'd also be a pursuer.

767
01:01:29,232 --> 01:01:32,531
I've seen you somewhere, I know.

768
01:01:33,149 --> 01:01:34,136
I followed you upstairs.

769
01:01:34,338 --> 01:01:35,966
And watched you in your box.

770
01:01:36,174 --> 01:01:38,641
But I couldn't place you.

771
01:01:39,197 --> 01:01:42,274
And I had to speak with you.

772
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,110
I know how it sounds. I assure
you in this case that it's true.

773
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:50,386
Believe that, don't you?

774
01:01:50,421 --> 01:01:51,622
Yes. Thank you.

775
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,550
Now please, just a moment.

776
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,285
Is there any place we could have
met, that I might have seen you?

777
01:01:57,496 --> 01:02:00,158
At one of my concerts?

778
01:02:00,366 --> 01:02:02,232
There must have
been sometime ago.

779
01:02:02,267 --> 01:02:05,431
I haven't given any
concerts in Vienna lately.

780
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:08,335
Or anywhere else in that matter.

781
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:11,066
You don't play anymore?

782
01:02:11,278 --> 01:02:13,245
Oh, it's not quite
as final as that.

783
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:16,244
I always tell myself that,
"Beginning next week."

784
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:18,577
And when next week
comes, it's this week.

785
01:02:18,952 --> 01:02:20,614
So, I wait for next week again.

786
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:23,479
What are you waiting for?

787
01:02:23,691 --> 01:02:25,318
It's a very disturbing question.

788
01:02:25,526 --> 01:02:26,151
My carriage...

789
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,922
You can't ask such a question,
and just walk away.

790
01:02:30,544 --> 01:02:33,855
I have a feeling... please
don't think I'm mad.

791
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:37,166
I know it sounds strange.
I can't explain it.

792
01:02:37,372 --> 01:02:42,503
But I feel that you understand
what I can't even say.

793
01:02:42,711 --> 01:02:46,307
And that you can help me.

794
01:02:46,515 --> 01:02:52,456
Have you ever shopped
for places like cards,

795
01:02:53,022 --> 01:02:54,320
Hoping to find the one...

796
01:02:54,524 --> 01:02:58,222
Lies somewhere at the
edge of your memory.

797
01:02:58,428 --> 01:03:01,592
The one you've been waiting for.

798
01:03:01,965 --> 01:03:04,160
But tonight, when
I first saw you.

799
01:03:04,369 --> 01:03:07,030
And later when I watched
you in the darkness.

800
01:03:07,237 --> 01:03:12,004
It looked like one
face amongst others.

801
01:03:12,242 --> 01:03:15,179
Who are you?

802
01:03:16,613 --> 01:03:19,932
Promise me, I'll see you again.
I must see you.

803
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:22,506
I don't know.

804
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:51,117
Johann, you don't think
I want this to happen?

805
01:03:52,186 --> 01:03:54,211
What are you going to do?

806
01:03:54,423 --> 01:03:57,357
I don't know.

807
01:03:57,993 --> 01:04:01,985
Lisa. We have a marriage.

808
01:04:02,197 --> 01:04:05,223
Perhaps it's not all you
once hoped for. But...

809
01:04:05,434 --> 01:04:09,632
You've a home, and your son.
People who care for you.

810
01:04:10,005 --> 01:04:11,996
I know that, Johann.

811
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:13,970
I'll do anything to
avoid hurting you.

812
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:17,993
But I can't help it.

813
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:20,109
And your son?

814
01:04:20,316 --> 01:04:22,147
Can you avoid hurting him?

815
01:04:22,352 --> 01:04:27,312
He won't be harmed
I'll see to that.

816
01:04:27,524 --> 01:04:32,962
There're such things
as honor, and decency.

817
01:04:33,427 --> 01:04:35,598
I told myself that hundred
times this one evening.

818
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,594
You talk like it is
out of your hands.

819
01:04:38,969 --> 01:04:42,336
It's not, Lisa.
You have a will.

820
01:04:43,062 --> 01:04:45,634
You can do what's right,
what's best for you.

821
01:04:46,011 --> 01:04:48,206
Or you can throw away your life.

822
01:04:48,413 --> 01:04:51,623
I've had no hope but his ever.

823
01:04:51,658 --> 01:04:53,615
That's romantic nonsense.

824
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:54,708
Is it?

825
01:04:55,566 --> 01:04:57,059
Johann, I can't help it.

826
01:04:57,094 --> 01:04:58,552
I can't dispute that.

827
01:04:58,758 --> 01:05:04,253
What about him? Can't he
help himself, either?

828
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:09,300
I know now that he needs me as
much as I've always needed him.

829
01:05:09,535 --> 01:05:12,869
Isn't it a bit late for
him to find that out?

830
01:05:13,074 --> 01:05:17,703
We're home, Sir.

831
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:28,620
Good night.

832
01:05:28,655 --> 01:05:32,761
Good night, Sir.

833
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:51,480
Lisa. If you do this, you
can never turn back.

834
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,012
You know that, don't you?

835
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:56,151
Yes.

836
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:04,592
I warn you. I shall do everything
in my power to prevent it.

837
01:06:37,935 --> 01:06:38,696
Hello, darling. Wake up.

838
01:06:39,966 --> 01:06:45,905
It's time to go
to your own room.

839
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:50,040
Did you have a nice time?

840
01:06:50,244 --> 01:06:53,180
Yes, darling.

841
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:55,639
Good night, father.

842
01:06:56,205 --> 01:06:57,985
Good night.

843
01:06:58,186 --> 01:06:59,983
Did you hear? I just said it.

844
01:07:00,376 --> 01:07:02,121
Yes, darling.

845
01:07:02,962 --> 01:07:08,263
Tell me about the opera...
was it exciting?

846
01:07:14,438 --> 01:07:15,096
How's that?

847
01:07:15,303 --> 01:07:18,137
You're wonderful.

848
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:22,277
You're wonderful.

849
01:07:22,578 --> 01:07:25,513
You've always been
a wonderful boy.

850
01:07:25,716 --> 01:07:29,219
You know how much that
it's meant to me?

851
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:32,054
Be so proud of you, always.

852
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:35,225
I know it.

853
01:08:02,355 --> 01:08:04,983
Don't worry, mother.

854
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:07,920
Two weeks will go like
an express train.

855
01:08:08,128 --> 01:08:09,322
You sure you're coming?

856
01:08:09,529 --> 01:08:10,518
Of course. I promise.

857
01:08:10,764 --> 01:08:12,630
You can even get my room
in the village for me.

858
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,559
I'll get you the same one
you're there last time.

859
01:08:14,934 --> 01:08:16,926
The one with the balcony.

860
01:08:17,138 --> 01:08:23,077
Didn't I tell you that
compartment was quarantined?

861
01:08:23,544 --> 01:08:24,476
I'm sorry, Madam.

862
01:08:25,081 --> 01:08:27,238
This compartment had
to be closed up.

863
01:08:27,449 --> 01:08:29,040
I'll take you to the
next cart forwards.

864
01:08:29,251 --> 01:08:32,152
That's good. I'll be
near the locomotive.

865
01:08:32,354 --> 01:08:36,289
I'll take the box.

866
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:39,807
Do we have two locomotives
on our train?

867
01:08:39,842 --> 01:08:41,223
We usually get along with one.

868
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:43,581
But I will talk to the engineer.

869
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:46,101
How about that one over there?
You can have two seats in there.

870
01:08:46,303 --> 01:08:48,599
He's travelling alone.

871
01:08:48,971 --> 01:08:50,405
Don't worry about it, Madam.

872
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,504
I'll take good care of him.

873
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:53,470
We leave in about a minute.

874
01:08:53,676 --> 01:08:56,177
Better hurry and get your seat.

875
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:58,306
You'll see better if
you sit over here.

876
01:08:58,514 --> 01:09:00,312
And if you get chilly, you
can put up the window.

877
01:09:00,551 --> 01:09:03,452
Yes, mother.

878
01:09:03,654 --> 01:09:08,717
Stefan. You know how I've
longed for you to being home.

879
01:09:09,093 --> 01:09:10,993
And now I can't even explain.

880
01:09:11,161 --> 01:09:14,620
I hope some day, very soon... I'll
be able to give you a reason.

881
01:09:14,999 --> 01:09:19,265
But now, you just have to believe
that it's for your own good.

882
01:09:19,472 --> 01:09:21,167
I don't mind going back so much.

883
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,534
Especially when you're
coming so soon.

884
01:09:23,908 --> 01:09:25,102
It'd be like two vocations.

885
01:09:25,311 --> 01:09:26,538
Alright, darling.

886
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:30,005
I'll show you the new walk we found
since you're there last time.

887
01:09:30,216 --> 01:09:34,153
Better get out, lady.

888
01:09:38,525 --> 01:09:40,322
You'll write me
often, won't you?

889
01:09:40,528 --> 01:09:47,126
Yes mother. But I can't write very often.
We've only two weeks.

890
01:09:47,334 --> 01:09:53,584
Good-bye, mother. Two weeks.

891
01:10:27,344 --> 01:10:30,312
Make way, please.

892
01:10:30,513 --> 01:10:33,258
Make way, please.

893
01:10:33,293 --> 01:10:35,118
What happened?

894
01:10:35,153 --> 01:10:36,944
Someone hurt?

895
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:38,452
No reason to get alarmed.

896
01:10:38,656 --> 01:10:39,954
They said that it's typhus.

897
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:40,680
Typhus?

898
01:10:41,091 --> 01:10:46,029
Yes. Typhus on the train.

899
01:11:00,713 --> 01:11:01,236
Yes. Madam.

900
01:11:01,446 --> 01:11:03,642
Yes. Is Mr. Brand here?
Stefan Brand.

901
01:11:04,016 --> 01:11:08,976
Brand? One moment, please.

902
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:10,690
Fritz!

903
01:11:11,023 --> 01:11:13,720
Um?

904
01:11:17,631 --> 01:11:20,601
Could you tell me has Mr. Brand
been here this evening?

905
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:23,937
Oh, Mr. Brand is no longer
a customer of ours.

906
01:11:24,138 --> 01:11:25,662
Not for sometime.

907
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,100
Mr. Brand these days is more
likely to be found at the Ritz.

908
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,280
Thank you.

909
01:12:03,286 --> 01:12:03,579
Good evening, Madam.

910
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:06,614
I still have nice flowers left.
I'm closing up.

911
01:12:07,446 --> 01:12:12,620
And I've saved you a nice bouquet.
Very cheap.

912
01:12:16,727 --> 01:12:20,629
I'll take those, the white ones.

913
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,159
Don't bother wrapping them up.

914
01:12:22,368 --> 01:12:26,303
Doesn't matter.

915
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:16,216
Now, drive. Drive on!

916
01:13:41,131 --> 01:13:45,589
Stefan Brand. Is he in?

917
01:13:54,799 --> 01:13:57,736
Thank you.

918
01:14:45,188 --> 01:14:46,747
This is a surprise.

919
01:14:47,122 --> 01:14:49,751
But I assure you're
a very happy one.

920
01:14:50,127 --> 01:14:55,621
John didn't prepare me for
such pleasant occasion.

921
01:14:55,999 --> 01:14:57,967
I thought last night...

922
01:14:58,168 --> 01:15:01,762
The darkness might've
played tricks with my eyes.

923
01:15:02,139 --> 01:15:04,768
You're even more beautiful
than I imagined.

924
01:15:05,846 --> 01:15:06,507
Very kind of you.

925
01:15:06,743 --> 01:15:09,974
This is just the hour
for a bit late supper.

926
01:15:10,181 --> 01:15:11,147
Or is it too late?

927
01:15:11,603 --> 01:15:13,145
Oh, it makes no difference.
You're here.

928
01:15:13,351 --> 01:15:16,479
As far as I'm concerned, all the
clocks in the world have stopped.

929
01:15:16,688 --> 01:15:18,485
Excuse me a moment.

930
01:15:19,318 --> 01:15:20,555
John!

931
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,552
John, I'm sorry to
send you out so late.

932
01:15:22,962 --> 01:15:25,056
Would you go out to the
corner, and get a few things.

933
01:15:25,263 --> 01:15:31,832
We're going to have supper.
The usual things.

934
01:15:36,142 --> 01:15:40,340
John makes life possible for
a hopelessly single man.

935
01:15:40,801 --> 01:15:43,174
She fascinates you, too!

936
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:44,213
Do you remember...

937
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:47,251
The Greeks built a statue
to a God they didn't know.

938
01:15:47,454 --> 01:15:49,752
But hoped someday
would come to them.

939
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:52,115
But mine happened
to be a Goddess.

940
01:15:52,327 --> 01:15:54,726
And you've never found her?

941
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:57,588
For years, I never
woke in the morning,

942
01:15:57,999 --> 01:16:00,195
but I said to myself,

943
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:05,339
"Perhaps today she will come.
My life will really begin."

944
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:09,032
Sometimes it seemed very near.

945
01:16:09,244 --> 01:16:15,082
But now I'm older,
and I know better.

946
01:16:15,752 --> 01:16:18,254
Even for yourself, you
don't play anymore?

947
01:16:18,289 --> 01:16:22,121
Oh, I remember last night, you're
kind enough to be interested...

948
01:16:23,179 --> 01:16:24,295
I forgot John locked
it when I went away.

949
01:16:24,495 --> 01:16:27,362
Nowadays, I'm away
quite a lot of time.

950
01:16:27,565 --> 01:16:31,967
I'll ask him for the key
when he comes back.

951
01:16:32,169 --> 01:16:33,965
You are very lovely.

952
01:16:34,171 --> 01:16:35,502
It's a beautiful dress.

953
01:16:35,706 --> 01:16:37,367
Thank you.

954
01:16:37,574 --> 01:16:40,603
How could you do that?
Give it up altogether.

955
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:43,675
Well, if you're so
curious, I'll tell you.

956
01:16:44,048 --> 01:16:46,575
One night I came
back to this room.

957
01:16:46,784 --> 01:16:49,310
I had given a concert
like all the others.

958
01:16:49,555 --> 01:16:52,112
Not bad, and not worse.

959
01:16:52,147 --> 01:16:55,063
Afterwards, they said
all the usual things.

960
01:16:55,274 --> 01:16:58,572
The things you say when you
are not really convinced.

961
01:16:58,776 --> 01:16:59,904
So, I happened to
look into the mirror.

962
01:17:00,634 --> 01:17:03,295
This one here.

963
01:17:03,502 --> 01:17:06,027
The young prot馮馥 was
no longer young.

964
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,504
Certainly wasn't perpetual.

965
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:12,440
Since then, I found
other things to do.

966
01:17:12,646 --> 01:17:16,583
More amusing things.

967
01:17:21,555 --> 01:17:27,496
I knew last night. Didn't you?

968
01:17:43,479 --> 01:17:48,109
I haven't even offered
to fix you a drink.

969
01:17:48,318 --> 01:17:48,716
Stefan?

970
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:51,144
Yes.

971
01:17:51,354 --> 01:17:54,256
I came here... I have
something to tell you.

972
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:55,655
If it has something to do with
you, l'm very interested.

973
01:17:56,025 --> 01:17:57,688
It has to do with us.

974
01:17:58,062 --> 01:18:01,032
We can't possible be serious
this early in the morning.

975
01:18:01,264 --> 01:18:02,664
At least not without a
glass of champagne.

976
01:18:03,034 --> 01:18:06,493
Won't take a minute.

977
01:18:06,704 --> 01:18:10,334
Champagne tastes much better
after midnight, don't you think?

978
01:18:11,168 --> 01:18:12,327
Much better.

979
01:18:12,702 --> 01:18:13,828
I've just came
back from America.

980
01:18:14,038 --> 01:18:15,629
It's a fascinating country.

981
01:18:15,838 --> 01:18:17,203
The men are fond of money.

982
01:18:17,677 --> 01:18:19,974
And their wives... are
fond of Europeans.

983
01:18:20,176 --> 01:18:21,905
Must have been a wonderful trip?

984
01:18:22,113 --> 01:18:26,845
Have you travelled a great deal?

985
01:18:27,458 --> 01:18:32,469
I couldn't get you out
of my mind all day.

986
01:18:33,548 --> 01:18:34,431
No, I don't believe you.

987
01:18:34,638 --> 01:18:36,470
If I only knew you're coming...

988
01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:37,765
To tell you the truth,

989
01:18:38,142 --> 01:18:40,666
I never dared to hope that you
could arranged it so soon.

990
01:18:41,546 --> 01:18:44,105
But you're so clever, you
managed so beautifully.

991
01:18:44,315 --> 01:18:47,545
You know, you're a
very strange woman.

992
01:18:47,785 --> 01:18:48,774
Am I?

993
01:18:49,153 --> 01:18:54,455
Something you've said last night,
it keeps running through my mind.

994
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:56,252
What was that?

995
01:18:56,461 --> 01:19:01,092
I'll tell you in just a moment
as soon as I get the ice.

996
01:19:01,301 --> 01:19:04,169
Are you getting
lonely out there?

997
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:07,340
Very lonely.

998
01:19:12,111 --> 01:19:14,881
"I come to tell you about us."

999
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,651
"To offer you my whole life."

1000
01:19:17,851 --> 01:19:23,894
"But you didn't
even remember me."

1001
01:20:01,499 --> 01:20:04,092
Can I take you
somewhere, young lady?

1002
01:20:04,334 --> 01:20:07,100
Anywhere at all?

1003
01:20:07,304 --> 01:20:12,242
It makes no difference.

1004
01:20:32,765 --> 01:20:35,325
"I don't remember where I went."

1005
01:20:35,534 --> 01:20:37,594
"Time will pass me."

1006
01:20:37,804 --> 01:20:39,896
"Not in days, or in hours."

1007
01:20:40,273 --> 01:20:44,026
"But in the distance
that put between us."

1008
01:20:44,061 --> 01:20:47,780
"Now I think again.
I went to my son."

1009
01:20:48,148 --> 01:20:50,549
"But it was too late."

1010
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:54,209
"He died last night of typhus."

1011
01:20:54,421 --> 01:20:58,537
"Without even knowing
I was there."

1012
01:20:58,572 --> 01:21:00,450
"Now I'm all alone."

1013
01:21:00,696 --> 01:21:04,654
"My head throbs, and my
temples are burning."

1014
01:21:04,899 --> 01:21:10,360
"Perhaps God has been kind. and
I too have caught the fever."

1015
01:21:10,572 --> 01:21:14,704
"If this letter reaches
you, believe this..."

1016
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:18,847
"That I love you now as
I've always loved you."

1017
01:21:19,215 --> 01:21:20,203
"My life can be measured...

1018
01:21:20,416 --> 01:21:24,547
"By the moments that I've had
with you and our child."

1019
01:21:24,857 --> 01:21:28,383
"If only you could've
shared those moments."

1020
01:21:28,591 --> 01:21:32,688
"If only you could've recognized
what was always yours."

1021
01:21:32,896 --> 01:21:36,194
"Could've found what
was never lost."

1022
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,335
"If only..."

1023
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:27,684
You remembered her?

1024
01:23:46,807 --> 01:23:50,211
Lisa...

1025
01:23:53,147 --> 01:23:55,912
Lisa...

1026
01:24:31,555 --> 01:24:35,491
Bring my things.

1027
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:07,827
Ready, gentleman?

1028
01:25:10,462 --> 01:25:14,764
"If only you could've recognized
what was always yours."

1029
01:25:15,134 --> 01:25:21,074
"Could've found what
was never lost..."
