1
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,138
Then... You've made up your mind?

2
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,220
You are going through with it?

3
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:41,620
Why not?

4
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:44,091
For one thing, he's an excellent champ.

5
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:46,683
At least try to get some sleep.

6
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,300
If I were you, no more Congnac.

7
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:51,414
We'll come for you at five.
It'd give you three hours.

8
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,045
You will be here.

9
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:55,519
I don't mind so much to being killed.

10
00:01:55,874 --> 00:02:00,348
But you know how it is for
me to get up in the morning.

11
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:01,057
Good night.

12
00:02:01,283 --> 00:02:04,099
Good night.

13
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:12,102
I'm afraid this time, Stephan has picked
a fight with the wrong man

14
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:17,217
I wonder if he'll be here
when we come back?

15
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:18,180
Who is it?

16
00:02:18,377 --> 00:02:19,108
Brown.

17
00:02:19,337 --> 00:02:24,074
Good morning, Mr. Brown.

18
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,145
Cheer up, John.

19
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:42,410
This is one engagement
that I have no intention of keeping.

20
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:45,958
Honor is a luxury.
Only gentleman can afford.

21
00:02:46,194 --> 00:02:47,656
Pack my things...

22
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:53,359
Whatever you think
that I'll need for a indefinite stay.

23
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:55,444
I have a cab downstairs...

24
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:00,110
In about an hour,
I'll go out the back way.

25
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,007
I'm sorry.
I won't be here to see their faces.

26
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:13,623
Has this come during the night?

27
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:19,516
Would you bring me
some coffee... with Congnac?

28
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:26,128
By the time you read this letter,
I may be dead.

29
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:30,760
I have so much to tell you,
perhaps very little time.

30
00:04:30,963 --> 00:04:32,491
Will I ever send it?

31
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:36,500
I don't know.

32
00:04:37,973 --> 00:04:42,382
I must find strength to write
before it's too late.

33
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:47,087
And as I write, it became clear
that what happened to us

34
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:51,600
...had its own reason beyond
our poor understanding.

35
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,296
If this reaches you...

36
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,286
You'll know how I became yours...

37
00:04:55,483 --> 00:05:00,122
When you didn't know who I was,
or even that I existed.

38
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:05,053
I think everyone has two birthdays.
Day of his physical bir

39
00:05:05,278 --> 00:05:08,574
And the beginning
of his conscious life.

40
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,004
Nothing is vivid...
or really my name.

41
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,957
Before that day in Spring...

42
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:14,078
When I came home from school,

43
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:20,162
And found a moving
van in front of our building.

44
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,554
I wander about in our new neighbor...

45
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,925
Who owned such beautiful things.

46
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:44,704
Lisa! Come in, Lisa!

47
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:48,585
Come in this minute, did you hear?

48
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,184
Lisa!

49
00:05:50,412 --> 00:05:53,228
Yes, mother.

50
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:56,903
Who is going to play that dock?

51
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,215
Me. I suppose.

52
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:02,350
I have nothing to do.

53
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,334
You better get another rope.

54
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:04,975
Uh?

55
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:06,475
You better get another rope.

56
00:06:06,673 --> 00:06:08,779
Alright!

57
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:10,633
Get another rope!

58
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:12,882
This is the last time I move a musician.

59
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:18,805
Why does he have to play the paino?

60
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:26,071
Where do these go?

61
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:29,272
What?

62
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,609
In the study.

63
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:41,843
Thank you.

64
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:44,085
Lisa, what are you doing out there?

65
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:47,133
Come inside.

66
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:04,802
I didn't see you that day,
or from many days that day after

67
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:10,725
But I could listen to your playing.

68
00:07:36,013 --> 00:07:38,054
I wish he stop that noise.

69
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:40,270
What noise?

70
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:44,490
Don't bite my head off.
Mr. Brown is playing.

71
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:45,223
You called that playing?

72
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:48,240
Shh...

73
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:58,379
How old is he?

74
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,753
Who?

75
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,798
Him!

76
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,806
Quite old, I guess.

77
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,078
Oh.

78
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:10,549
You know the boy
I was talking to outside the school?

79
00:08:10,905 --> 00:08:14,222
The bony one with the yellow
hair and a long nose.

80
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,630
One who lives next to the grocery.

81
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:18,136
I'm gonna do something about it...

82
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,107
If he dosen't keep his hands to himself.

83
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,579
The things he does,
Right out in the street

84
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:10,121
Thank you, John.
I'll be home later.

85
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:21,966
Thank you.

86
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:25,327
Good morning.

87
00:09:35,603 --> 00:09:41,202
Why, Lisa! You're all red in the face.

88
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:43,537
You're bulshing!

89
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:46,069
I'll get you for that!

90
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:48,205
Yes, I was blushing.

91
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:50,994
And hard as it
may be for you to realize...

92
00:09:51,193 --> 00:09:55,537
From that moment on,
I was in love with you.

93
00:09:55,738 --> 00:09:59,034
Quite consciously,
I was preparing myself for you.

94
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:03,829
I kept my clothes neater,
so you wouldn't be ashamed of me.

95
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:05,782
Bow, two three four...

96
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:07,702
I went to dancing school.

97
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:13,431
I wanted to become more graceful,
and learn good manners for

98
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:17,917
Bow... two three, and one two three...

99
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:21,889
And one two three...

100
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:26,940
So I would know more about you,
and your world...

101
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,478
I went to the library...

102
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:34,406
And study the lives
of great musicians of the past.

103
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,913
Though I was not able to
go to your concerts,

104
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:53,965
I found ways of sharing in
your success.

105
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:07,561
As months went by,
I began to know your friends.

106
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:13,459
Many of them are women. Most of them.

107
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:16,787
Lisa!

108
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:21,171
Lisa!

109
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:25,141
Where are you, Lisa?

110
00:11:27,831 --> 00:11:33,529
Aren't you going to finish your dinner?

111
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:36,757
Sorry, mother.

112
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:46,236
But I really lived for
those evenings when you're alone.

113
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:52,127
And I pretended
that you're playing just for me.

114
00:12:05,763 --> 00:12:07,618
I know you didn't know it...

115
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:13,670
You're giving me some
of the happiest hours of my life.

116
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,239
Then came a great day for me.

117
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,131
In the building where we lived.

118
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,058
Thursday was rug-beating day.

119
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:47,389
Come on, let's help him!

120
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:49,089
Oh! I've got to do my own.

121
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:56,510
I'll do it for you afterwards.
Come on!

122
00:13:58,631 --> 00:13:59,559
Remember what you've promised!

123
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:02,567
I will.

124
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:09,736
Beautiful rug.

125
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:10,913
It's a beautiful rug, isn't it?

126
00:14:11,115 --> 00:14:12,195
Oh, it's just a rug.

127
00:14:12,396 --> 00:14:16,172
Oh, you wouldn't know.

128
00:14:16,685 --> 00:14:18,376
Say, what are we doing this for?

129
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:19,785
Shh! He will hear you.

130
00:14:19,982 --> 00:14:22,317
Oh, he can't talk.

131
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:28,110
Well, he can hear, can't he?

132
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,950
You're welcome.

133
00:14:36,147 --> 00:14:37,227
Come on, Lisa.

134
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:38,449
I'll be right down.

135
00:14:38,643 --> 00:14:39,626
What are you going to do?

136
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:41,039
Go away, I'll be right down.

137
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:42,291
What are you going to do?

138
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:45,901
Go away, or I'll throw you downstairs.

139
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:49,078
Are you crazy?

140
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:54,110
Lisa!

141
00:16:57,152 --> 00:16:59,738
What are you doing up there?

142
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:02,938
Come dear, I've something to tell you.

143
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,462
It's really good news.

144
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:13,568
If you think about it sensibly,
you'll be very happy.

145
00:17:13,925 --> 00:17:16,773
Sit down.

146
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:29,569
I can understand
that you must've been startled...

147
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:32,323
When you saw
her customer and me in the hall.

148
00:17:32,523 --> 00:17:37,161
Perhaps it's my fault for not telling
you something about it

149
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:41,188
You see, dear,
your mother is not really old.

150
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,405
She can have admirers, too.

151
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:47,624
She can even be in love with a man.

152
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:51,949
Someday you'll understand
better what I means.

153
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:52,775
Besides...

154
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:56,273
You know how hard it is for us to
get along on that small pe

155
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,409
That guy has a comfortable business.

156
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,579
It links... a military tailor.

157
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,638
And he's down here
to ask me to marry him.

158
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,950
Besides, he is a kind man,
and he likes you very much.

159
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:14,640
I'm sure with his help,
it'll be much easier for you to...

160
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,263
Mother!

161
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:18,262
What is it?

162
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,701
But we have to go to Lance?

163
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,717
We have to live there?

164
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:23,123
But why not?

165
00:18:23,323 --> 00:18:24,534
What is there to keep us here?

166
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:25,972
I won't go!

167
00:18:26,204 --> 00:18:26,738
I won't go!

168
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,249
Lisa!

169
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:29,874
What's the matter?

170
00:18:30,077 --> 00:18:31,670
But... what is it?

171
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,699
Lisa!

172
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:33,756
I won't go.

173
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:35,161
I won't go.

174
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,455
Now Lisa!
Do be reasonable and tell your mother.

175
00:18:38,656 --> 00:18:39,485
I won't! I won't!

176
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:42,528
Lisa!

177
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,390
That will do with our ocean part liner.

178
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:49,148
Let see...
We've eleven altogether.

179
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:54,367
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.
Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven.

180
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:55,619
It comes, Dear.

181
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:57,090
Don't worry, dear.
I'll take care of everything.

182
00:18:57,286 --> 00:19:00,385
The adjustment promised the trunk
said that...

183
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:04,161
Oh, either I'd lost half a minute...
or the station parted ear

184
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,702
How much would that be, please?

185
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:06,430
It's up to you, sir.

186
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:08,259
Up to me?

187
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:10,399
One dollar should be enough.

188
00:19:10,602 --> 00:19:12,392
The guy promised the trunk
would be here on time.

189
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:13,535
With all the boxes...

190
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:16,834
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.

191
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:21,510
Uh... how long will it take
if we send them through the third

192
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,211
Two weeks, maybe.

193
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:23,981
Two weeks... very good.

194
00:19:24,174 --> 00:19:26,597
Now each of these... second class.

195
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,847
Third class...

196
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:29,702
Each of these... third class.

197
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:30,603
Yes...

198
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:33,354
Ah... what did I tell you.

199
00:19:33,554 --> 00:19:35,147
When you're going to a thing,
do it one time

200
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:36,588
That is always nice.

201
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:37,546
Hello. Thank you.

202
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:38,855
You can unloaded it here.

203
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,369
Our train doesn't leave until 12:00.

204
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:41,618
Yes,12:00,darling.

205
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:44,660
The twelve!

206
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,678
Please don't get excited, dear

207
00:19:49,879 --> 00:19:52,695
I'd be calm.

208
00:19:56,345 --> 00:20:00,208
Suddenly I knew
I couldn't live without you.

209
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:02,232
I didn't know what I had in mind, or...

210
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:05,329
...what my parents would do
when they found me missing.

211
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:08,792
All I wanted was to see you once more.

212
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:09,719
To be near you again.

213
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,912
To throw myself at your feet,
cling to you, and never leave you.

214
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,968
Nothing else. Nothing else matters.

215
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:26,268
Alright, alright.

216
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:28,355
Oh, it's you, Lisa.

217
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:32,057
I thought now
that you're half way to Linze?

218
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,984
Didn't your train leave in about...

219
00:20:34,181 --> 00:20:37,957
I forgot something.

220
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:03,133
These rooms where I've lived,
have been filled with your music.

221
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:05,718
Now they were empty.

222
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:07,962
Would they ever come to life again?

223
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:09,724
Would I?

224
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:11,833
Only you could answer.

225
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:14,371
So, I waited.

226
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:17,412
Waited...

227
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:20,995
For what seemed endless hours
I set outside your door...

228
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:23,166
Try to keep myself awake.

229
00:22:23,368 --> 00:22:25,987
...afraid that
I might fall asleep and miss you.

230
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:29,033
Then...

231
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,793
Who is it?

232
00:22:33,994 --> 00:22:34,529
Brown!

233
00:22:34,731 --> 00:22:39,467
Good morning, Mr. Brown.

234
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:22,295
And so, there was nothing left for me.

235
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,266
I went to Linze.

236
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:34,390
You who have always lived so freely...

237
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,737
Have you any idea
what life's like as a little garrison in

238
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:41,562
I was eighteen now...

239
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,399
And was expected to take
my place in society.

240
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:49,147
Come now, Lisa.
Don't look down at your feet.

241
00:23:49,347 --> 00:23:51,355
Please be tactful and
let him do the talking.

242
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,972
But not all the talking.
Do you hear me, Lisa?

243
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:56,187
Good morning, Colonel.

244
00:23:56,389 --> 00:23:59,204
Good morning, Colonel.

245
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:02,214
Good morning.

246
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:06,720
Mrs. Castler, Miss Castler.
Mr. Castler.

247
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,066
May I have the honor to
present you my nephew...

248
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:11,273
Leitenent Leonard Oncathelic...

249
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:13,408
I have the honor to kiss your hand.

250
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:14,789
Very pleased to make your acquaintance.

251
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:15,746
Thank you, Lieutenant.

252
00:24:16,107 --> 00:24:18,442
Mr. Castler, I have the honor, sir.

253
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:19,781
I'm very pleased to make
your acquaintance.

254
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,409
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

255
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:23,748
Allow me to present our daughter, Lisa.

256
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,726
Lieutenant Leonard.

257
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:38,193
Good morning...

258
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:43,378
Excuse me.

259
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,307
Do you like it here in Lance?

260
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:51,084
Quiet well.

261
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:54,134
It must seemed
very restfull living in Vienna?

262
00:24:54,488 --> 00:24:55,982
I like Vienna.

263
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:58,287
Indeed.

264
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:02,712
What did you like about it?

265
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:04,244
Perhaps you were found of the music?

266
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:06,331
Yes.

267
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:08,793
We also have good music here.

268
00:25:08,988 --> 00:25:12,535
Every other Saturday afternoon
they gave a concert on the co

269
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:14,075
Oh, really?

270
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:16,987
Perhaps someday you'll allow
me the honor to escorting you?

271
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,874
Very nice of you.

272
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:21,493
When there was a good chance,
I'd take part of it myself.

273
00:25:21,695 --> 00:25:22,427
I played second trumpet.

274
00:25:22,624 --> 00:25:23,770
Oh, how nice.

275
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:26,551
I must say I'm glad that you like music.

276
00:25:26,753 --> 00:25:27,222
You see...

277
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:33,123
There's nothing wrong
with her if she meets the right people

278
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:43,323
Up! Up! Up! Up!

279
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:46,375
Up! Up! Up!

280
00:25:49,448 --> 00:25:50,594
The Lieutenant was right.

281
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:52,681
Linze was a musical town.

282
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:55,107
So twice a month
that's what I listened...

283
00:25:55,306 --> 00:25:59,945
The Lieutenant and I.

284
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:30,480
Before the afternoon is over,
I'm sure we'll hear an announc

285
00:26:30,678 --> 00:26:32,566
Nothing could please us more, Colonel.

286
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:37,494
Is that right, my dear?

287
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:44,149
Miss Lisa, this is a subject
which I wish to bring up for so

288
00:26:44,346 --> 00:26:48,024
I trust you'd forgive me to
presume the action that I allow

289
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,108
It maybe unnecessary to mention that...

290
00:26:50,493 --> 00:26:51,671
Eversince you first came
to my attention,

291
00:26:51,868 --> 00:26:53,494
I've been most favorably impressed.

292
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:54,325
Thank you.

293
00:26:54,557 --> 00:26:56,500
And I believe
that your parents are not opposed...

294
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:59,638
...my keeping company
that is dedicate with you.

295
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:00,500
But, Lieutenant, I...

296
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:03,487
Oh, please allow me to finish.

297
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,328
As far as my prospects are concerned,
You must be aware that...

298
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,384
It's generally pleased
by my uncle and others,

299
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:11,226
That I have a qualifications
for an ourstanding military car

300
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:12,448
It's no doubt of that.

301
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:14,880
Naturally, it's too soon to
discuss a definite step.

302
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:16,505
We should know each other
for a reasonable time...

303
00:27:16,709 --> 00:27:16,992
But, Lieutenant...

304
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:18,756
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

305
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,154
It's impossible?

306
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,397
Please allow me to explain.

307
00:27:22,631 --> 00:27:25,893
I must insist.
Is there someone else?

308
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:27,200
Yes.

309
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:28,480
I'm engaged to be married.

310
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,150
Engaged to be married?

311
00:27:30,345 --> 00:27:32,069
I should've told you before,
But I didn't realize that how...

312
00:27:32,265 --> 00:27:33,214
But all the time you've been in Linze,

313
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:34,563
I haven't seen anyone's company.

314
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:36,137
He doesn't live in Linza.
He lives in Vienna.

315
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,418
In Vienna?

316
00:27:37,611 --> 00:27:39,815
He... he likes music, he's a musician.

317
00:27:40,012 --> 00:27:41,027
But how can that be?

318
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:43,331
Your mother and father,
they gave my uncle the encouragement...

319
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:44,842
They don't know yet!

320
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:48,941
You're engaged to a man,
and your parents don't even know it?

321
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,182
Um...

322
00:27:50,383 --> 00:27:53,680
I'm sorry, I...

323
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:56,623
Then, please.

324
00:27:59,026 --> 00:28:04,724
Waiter, the wine. The wine.

325
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:15,767
Up! Up!

326
00:28:39,455 --> 00:28:40,022
But I don't understand.

327
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:43,289
Lisa, sit down. What happened?

328
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:43,899
Nothing.

329
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:44,662
But after all...

330
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:46,010
But you must've said something.

331
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:46,907
What did you say to him?

332
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:48,731
I only told him the truth.

333
00:28:48,962 --> 00:28:50,970
The truth! What do you mean the truth?

334
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:52,608
What did you say to him?

335
00:28:52,803 --> 00:28:55,903
I told him, I wasn't free.

336
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,056
What...?

337
00:28:57,253 --> 00:29:00,320
My poor parents,
for them this was the end.

338
00:29:00,517 --> 00:29:06,215
For me, it was a new beginning.

339
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:08,964
Vienna, when I saw her again,

340
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,714
Seemed to have taken
on a new splendor.

341
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:13,833
All the time I've been away,

342
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:16,579
I thought longingly, it's your city.

343
00:29:16,778 --> 00:29:19,747
Now, it's our city.

344
00:29:19,948 --> 00:29:22,185
Madam Spitt's where I found work.

345
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,676
It's the kind of establishment
where one learns many things

346
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:27,371
Miss Lisa, please.

347
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:30,414
Coming.

348
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:40,945
Hold your breath.

349
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:46,996
Miss Lisa, we're waithing.

350
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:56,885
Very pretty.

351
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:59,153
Yes.

352
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:02,361
Very.

353
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:28,384
Very charming. Very charming, indeed.

354
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:29,275
Do you think...

355
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:32,224
She is not like the others,
I don't understand that girl...

356
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:33,347
But every evening,

357
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:37,249
As soon as this shop are closes,
off she goes straight home.

358
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:40,260
Really?

359
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,765
Madam Spitt spoke the truth.

360
00:30:45,991 --> 00:30:48,096
I was not like the others.

361
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:51,904
Nobody waited for me.

362
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:54,851
Off I went, not home...

363
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,467
But to the only place
that it ever seemed home to me.

364
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:04,134
Night after night,
I returned to the same spot.

365
00:31:04,332 --> 00:31:10,030
You never noticed me...
until one evening.

366
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:24,324
I've seen you before, few nights ago.

367
00:32:24,518 --> 00:32:27,836
Right here. Or... your live near here?

368
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:31,048
No.

369
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,608
You like to listen to the street singers?

370
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:35,107
Um... yes.

371
00:32:35,305 --> 00:32:38,121
Neither do I.

372
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:42,152
I should introduce myself.

373
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:47,081
No. I know who you are.

374
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,144
I suppose sooner or later,
we have to decide where we're walk

375
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:01,867
I have something I should call off.

376
00:33:02,066 --> 00:33:07,764
I'd never get to the place
where I start out for, anyway.

377
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,878
Pardon.

378
00:33:47,072 --> 00:33:49,277
Excuse me.

379
00:33:49,473 --> 00:33:50,684
Very charming.

380
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:51,329
Thank you.

381
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:53,176
Anything else I can do for you,
Mr. Brwon?

382
00:33:53,538 --> 00:33:54,487
Will you please tell Mr. Bowlish,

383
00:33:54,691 --> 00:33:57,442
I won't be at the rehearsal this evening.

384
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,294
Congratulations.

385
00:33:59,493 --> 00:34:01,566
Bruce, is that gentleman free now?

386
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:02,496
Just moment, sir.

387
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:04,581
Don't you see I'm busy with Mr. Brown?

388
00:34:04,774 --> 00:34:08,866
Now... how about Lady Lilian?

389
00:34:09,063 --> 00:34:10,754
If she comes,
how am I going to tell her?

390
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:12,130
Well, tell her...

391
00:34:12,329 --> 00:34:15,810
I'll tell her... It was most important
and you had to work.

392
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:16,904
Yes, that's it. That's fine.

393
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:17,861
I'm sure she will understand.

394
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:18,505
I'm sure.

395
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:19,014
Thank you.

396
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,737
Bye.

397
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:24,453
Stephen, I missed you yesterday.
I have to talk to you.

398
00:34:24,652 --> 00:34:25,252
Later.

399
00:34:25,484 --> 00:34:28,747
I saw the manager group at the conchter.
It's a young man I met...

400
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:31,688
His father owns half the colege to

401
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:35,245
I thought it was something
for one of your concerts.

402
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,333
If you just go outside...

403
00:34:36,528 --> 00:34:37,608
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

404
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,657
Tomorrow...

405
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,518
Now, don't be frighten.

406
00:34:57,878 --> 00:35:01,589
If it's not to becoming,
the lobster would have no intention.

407
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:03,727
I was wrong. It is becoming.

408
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:06,963
Let see,
when do they have lobster again?

409
00:35:07,162 --> 00:35:08,755
Friday. How about Friday?

410
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:10,645
A week is a long time.

411
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:13,113
How about Wednesday.
That's pheasant.

412
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,715
They have pheasant on Monday.

413
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:16,530
Could you possibly make it on Monday?

414
00:35:16,732 --> 00:35:19,155
I've no engagement at all.

415
00:35:19,357 --> 00:35:22,457
I've none, either.
We'll have dinner tomorrow night.

416
00:35:22,815 --> 00:35:24,790
Dinner, that's all

417
00:35:24,991 --> 00:35:27,261
Excuse me, Mr. Brown.
The lady in the next room,

418
00:35:27,648 --> 00:35:29,471
If I'm not mistaken,
is The Countess Newesky.

419
00:35:29,665 --> 00:35:33,049
Would you sign her the program
of this afternoon's concert?

420
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,239
Certainly.

421
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,218
She said, Mozart
himself could not have done better.

422
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:39,200
How nice of her.

423
00:35:39,396 --> 00:35:40,062
There you are.

424
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,308
Thank the Countess for the compliment.

425
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:42,272
Thank you. Haybra.

426
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:44,357
The note is not the least she deserves.

427
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,655
Four years ago
when you played the D Minor.

428
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:47,803
You remember that?

429
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:49,861
The morning review, also.

430
00:35:50,055 --> 00:35:51,038
Compare too young Mozart.

431
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,016
I was very young.

432
00:35:57,354 --> 00:36:00,170
You like it?

433
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,309
Mar Poly Charli, it's called.

434
00:36:02,508 --> 00:36:06,022
First thing you see
when you come down the other side of the

435
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,392
The Italians say,
it is such a good wine,

436
00:36:08,782 --> 00:36:11,368
Because the grapes have
their roots in the vine,

437
00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:13,898
And the eyes on the mountains.

438
00:36:14,095 --> 00:36:14,793
Please...

439
00:36:14,992 --> 00:36:16,902
Please what?

440
00:36:17,104 --> 00:36:19,887
Please talk about yourself.

441
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:24,305
I believe you really want to hear about it.
Why?

442
00:36:24,499 --> 00:36:26,572
Uh, never mind why.

443
00:36:26,803 --> 00:36:30,481
The truth is,
I had rather an easy time of it.

444
00:36:30,676 --> 00:36:33,710
People accepted my music very quickly.

445
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,982
Perhaps too quickly.

446
00:36:36,214 --> 00:36:40,656
Sometimes it seemed easier
to please others than oneself.

447
00:36:40,855 --> 00:36:42,678
What're you going to say?

448
00:36:42,872 --> 00:36:44,465
You know you don't talk very much.

449
00:36:44,665 --> 00:36:46,706
Well... I can't say very well. But...

450
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,367
Yes.

451
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:51,058
Sometimes,
I felt when you're playing that...

452
00:36:51,259 --> 00:36:53,081
Go on.

453
00:36:53,275 --> 00:36:58,973
That... your haven't quite found
what you're looking for.

454
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:03,702
How long have you
been hiding in my paino?

455
00:37:03,903 --> 00:37:05,791
Uh, never mind explaining.

456
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:08,440
I just assume you're a sorcerous,

457
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,383
And that
you can make yourself very tiny.

458
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:15,709
It might be a good thing
to have a sorcerous friend.

459
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:18,817
Who knows?

460
00:37:19,012 --> 00:37:24,709
You maybe able to help me someday.

461
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,547
How could I help you?

462
00:37:32,744 --> 00:37:35,778
So, that's what you've been thinking?

463
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:38,374
You're a very stange girl.

464
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,800
Who ever you are,
where ever you came from...

465
00:37:41,995 --> 00:37:43,042
Don't you have any problem?

466
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:47,020
Not... important ones.

467
00:37:50,798 --> 00:37:56,167
It's been a long
while since anyone did that for me?

468
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,228
Stop here, please.

469
00:37:57,424 --> 00:38:00,239
Woo... Ah.

470
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:05,390
Good evening, Mr. Brown.

471
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:07,180
Good evening.

472
00:38:07,379 --> 00:38:07,793
Roses?

473
00:38:07,987 --> 00:38:08,915
Yes. Please.

474
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:09,674
Nice red ones?

475
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:16,337
No. Red is the wrong color.
I think the white one would be perfect

476
00:38:16,534 --> 00:38:18,902
This is a special occassion.

477
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:19,854
Here you are. Good night.

478
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,590
Good night, Mr. Brown.

479
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:25,559
Enjoy yourself.

480
00:38:25,785 --> 00:38:26,963
Did I guess wright?

481
00:38:27,162 --> 00:38:28,536
Is it your flower?

482
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:31,410
From now on it will be.

483
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,200
Would you like me to close it?

484
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,134
No.

485
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:40,029
Hah... and now to the park.

486
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:57,083
Do you think it would all be close?

487
00:38:57,283 --> 00:39:00,099
I hope not.

488
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,133
I never come here in the season.

489
00:39:03,493 --> 00:39:05,599
It's more pleasant in the winter.
I don't know why.

490
00:39:05,797 --> 00:39:06,746
It's perhaps...

491
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:09,634
Because you prefer to imagine
how it will be in the spring.

492
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:13,247
Because if it's spring,
then it's nothing to imagine and to w

493
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,335
Is there anything about
me you don't know?

494
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,509
A few things.

495
00:39:16,873 --> 00:39:18,368
For instance, one thing I don't know,

496
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:21,254
If one day they would
make a wax figure of you and put it th

497
00:39:21,451 --> 00:39:23,753
Because you'll be so famous.

498
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:27,745
Well, if they do, will you pay your
penny to come in and see me?

499
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,725
If you come alive.

500
00:39:41,072 --> 00:39:43,178
Now I see you as a little girl.

501
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:46,193
You do?

502
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:49,806
When my father was alive,
we traveled a lot.

503
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:51,346
He went nearly everywhere.

504
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,817
We've had a wonderful time.

505
00:39:53,012 --> 00:39:54,474
I didn't know you traveled so much.

506
00:39:54,677 --> 00:39:55,724
Oh, yes.

507
00:39:55,925 --> 00:39:58,315
Perhaps we've been in some
of the same places.

508
00:39:58,518 --> 00:40:00,307
No, I don't think so.

509
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:01,299
Where did you go?

510
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:03,383
Well, it was a long time. But...

511
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:05,430
For instance, there was Rio de Janeiro.

512
00:40:05,784 --> 00:40:08,305
Beautiful, exotic,
real with its botanical garden.

513
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:11,055
Its Avenue palms, Sugarloaf fountain,

514
00:40:11,258 --> 00:40:15,635
And the harbor where you can
look down and see the flying fi

515
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:16,436
We're in Venice.

516
00:40:16,636 --> 00:40:17,530
Yes, we've arrived.

517
00:40:17,724 --> 00:40:20,856
Where would you like to go next?
France? England? Russia?

518
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:21,496
Switzerland.

519
00:40:21,694 --> 00:40:22,163
Switzerland.

520
00:40:22,334 --> 00:40:28,031
Excuse me a moment
while I talked to the engineer.

521
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,124
You and the lady,
are you enjoying the trip?

522
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:35,966
Very much.?
We're off to Switzerland.

523
00:40:36,162 --> 00:40:36,925
There you go. Thank you.

524
00:40:37,155 --> 00:40:39,774
Oh... thank you.

525
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:42,209
Switzerland.

526
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:43,517
Switzerland.

527
00:40:43,717 --> 00:40:46,532
Switzerland.

528
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:10,213
So, you're looking
down at the flying fish. Then what?

529
00:41:10,413 --> 00:41:12,301
Aren't you going to finish the trip?

530
00:41:12,494 --> 00:41:14,382
Well, there weren't any trip,
do you mind?

531
00:41:14,607 --> 00:41:17,258
You see, my father
had a friend in the Travel Bureau.

532
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:18,666
My father worked across the street.

533
00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:21,614
He was an assistant super
attendant of the Municipal water?

534
00:41:21,808 --> 00:41:26,414
And he used to bring photos home
with pictures in them.

535
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:27,985
And in the evening,
he'd put on his traveling coat.

536
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:30,543
That's what he called it,
'Cause I was very young.

537
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,267
And he'd say:
where should we go this evening?

538
00:41:32,468 --> 00:41:35,665
And I would say: Verra Cruse.
Because it's a beautiful name.

539
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:38,291
And then he would say: um...
it's summer there,

540
00:41:38,486 --> 00:41:40,908
You don't want to be roasted
like a coffee bean, do you?

541
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,289
So, you never did get there?

542
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:45,234
No. It's just like I tripped the land
with the midnight sun.

543
00:41:45,624 --> 00:41:46,552
What stop are you in time?

544
00:41:46,745 --> 00:41:47,476
The weather.

545
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:48,436
I thought of India.

546
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:50,870
But then father remembered
it was the raining season.

547
00:41:51,066 --> 00:41:52,724
Your father was an expert on climates.

548
00:41:52,923 --> 00:41:53,752
My mother used to say that...

549
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:57,745
He knew what the weather
was everywhere except home.

550
00:41:58,108 --> 00:41:58,708
What mountain was that?

551
00:41:59,068 --> 00:42:00,891
That's the Mt. MataHorn.

552
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,133
You've climbed it?

553
00:42:02,366 --> 00:42:03,260
Um hum.

554
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,302
Tell me when you've climbed up
the mountain,
what then?

555
00:42:07,936 --> 00:42:13,633
Well, you come down again.

556
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:19,359
Tell me more about your father.

557
00:42:19,555 --> 00:42:23,867
Well, then he finally did go away.

558
00:42:24,068 --> 00:42:25,443
He had the nicest eyes.

559
00:42:25,797 --> 00:42:28,896
Yes, I can see them.

560
00:42:29,094 --> 00:42:31,233
Why do you like to climb mountains?

561
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,966
Well, I suppose because,

562
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,390
No matter how high you climb,
there's always a higher one.

563
00:42:36,585 --> 00:42:38,952
And you like to imagine
that the other one is even more wond

564
00:42:39,305 --> 00:42:39,687
Like the spring in the park.

565
00:42:39,914 --> 00:42:41,256
You know far too much about me already,

566
00:42:41,449 --> 00:42:44,233
And I know almost nothing about you

567
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:49,033
Except you traveled a great deal.

568
00:42:54,062 --> 00:42:56,878
All change.

569
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,563
What now?

570
00:43:07,762 --> 00:43:08,777
Where haven't we been?

571
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:10,994
We have no countries left.

572
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:13,327
Then we'll begin all over again.

573
00:43:13,556 --> 00:43:17,135
There you are.
Thank you.

574
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:21,132
We'll revisit the scenes of your youth.

575
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,463
I don't know about them
but I'm going home.

576
00:43:50,656 --> 00:43:51,485
Right after this number.

577
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,583
? Me too, if he is not paying
me 50 quarters.

578
00:43:54,817 --> 00:44:02,010
I'd like to playing for married people.
They've got homes.

579
00:44:11,878 --> 00:44:13,734
You're sorcerous.

580
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:18,271
Now I'm sure,
How else could we dance this way

581
00:44:18,729 --> 00:44:21,861
Unless we've danced together before.

582
00:44:22,058 --> 00:44:27,755
And if we had,
we should ever remember it.

583
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:36,366
Please.

584
00:45:10,137 --> 00:45:11,250
Promise me something.

585
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,938
Anything.

586
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:16,538
But I don't even know where you live.

587
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:19,033
Promise me you won't vanish.

588
00:45:19,228 --> 00:45:24,926
I won't be the one who vanishes.

589
00:45:47,909 --> 00:45:48,541
We're here.

590
00:45:48,742 --> 00:45:51,590
Thank you.

591
00:46:02,186 --> 00:46:05,001
Thank you.

592
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:14,507
Who is it?

593
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:15,596
Brown.

594
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:20,527
Good morning, Mr. Brown.

595
00:46:24,017 --> 00:46:27,793
(End of Side A)

596
00:47:02,556 --> 00:47:05,874
Please be seated.

597
00:47:06,078 --> 00:47:09,046
Lisa, leave it on.
Someone wants to see it.

598
00:47:09,247 --> 00:47:09,814
Oh.

599
00:47:10,015 --> 00:47:15,713
Real customer. Looks like a good one.

600
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,101
One moment.

601
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:28,579
You'll like this one, I'm sure.
I'm sure.

602
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:34,908
I like it very much.
Very much.

603
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:36,606
How did you find me?

604
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,302
I'm a good detective, what you think?

605
00:47:38,664 --> 00:47:41,513
You are.

606
00:47:47,435 --> 00:47:51,429
I'm afraid we have to put off
our play for tonight.

607
00:47:51,628 --> 00:47:54,280
I couldn't go away without seeing you.

608
00:47:54,477 --> 00:47:55,426
Where are you going?

609
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:56,874
Milano.

610
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,617
The whole orchestra are going.
We go to play at Chigano.

611
00:48:00,816 --> 00:48:03,053
It's wonderful.

612
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:06,097
I've forgotten all about it.

613
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:08,904
It won't be long.
Just two weeks.

614
00:48:09,266 --> 00:48:11,242
The train leaves at 5:30.

615
00:48:11,442 --> 00:48:14,607
Do you suppose you could see me off?

616
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:15,698
I'll try.

617
00:48:16,052 --> 00:48:22,131
I'll look for you then.
Good bye. Thank you.

618
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:29,016
Good-bye. You will be there.

619
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,448
How did it go?

620
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:32,951
He wasn't interested in the suit.

621
00:48:33,306 --> 00:48:36,340
But... Madam,
could I leave a bit earlier today?

622
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:39,223
How early?
About 5:00.

623
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,039
Yes.
Sure.

624
00:48:42,236 --> 00:48:43,349
Thank you, Madam.

625
00:48:43,549 --> 00:48:48,285
Congratulations, my dear.

626
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:12,674
Stephan, the train is leaving.
Just a minute

627
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:16,613
How long have you been standing here?

628
00:49:16,807 --> 00:49:20,256
I don't want to go. Do you believe that?

629
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,951
I'll be here when you get back.

630
00:49:22,313 --> 00:49:22,695
Come on.

631
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:26,054
Yes.
Stephan, hurry, please.

632
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,120
I still know so little about you.

633
00:49:29,324 --> 00:49:33,035
You like mistery.

634
00:49:33,228 --> 00:49:36,578
That a woman like you exist,
and I found you.

635
00:49:36,782 --> 00:49:39,597
That's mistery to me.

636
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,752
SayStephan,
the way you said it last night.

637
00:49:43,952 --> 00:49:46,473
Stephan.

638
00:49:46,673 --> 00:49:48,135
As if you've said it all your life.

639
00:49:48,337 --> 00:49:48,719
Better hurry, sir.

640
00:49:49,074 --> 00:49:50,765
Yes.

641
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:51,504
Good-bye.

642
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:56,010
Stephan.
Good-bye.

643
00:49:56,276 --> 00:50:00,500
Won't be long.
I'll be back in two weeks.

644
00:50:03,606 --> 00:50:07,382
Good-bye. Two weeks.

645
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:26,874
Two weeks... Stehpan,
how little you knew of yourself.

646
00:50:27,646 --> 00:50:33,344
That train was taking
you out of my life.

647
00:51:08,747 --> 00:51:12,043
He was a married man.

648
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:16,012
Does he live here in Vienna?

649
00:51:16,397 --> 00:51:17,739
If we knew who he was,

650
00:51:17,934 --> 00:51:23,632
He might be willing
to accept his responsibility.

651
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,738
You won't tell us his name?

652
00:51:34,227 --> 00:51:37,424
But you haven't the means
to take care of the child.

653
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:41,396
We'll get along.

654
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,501
It's your duty to tell us.

655
00:51:43,702 --> 00:51:44,651
When a man does...

656
00:51:44,854 --> 00:51:50,126
I'm feeling tired.
Would you go?

657
00:51:52,473 --> 00:51:55,376
You may wonder
why I never came to you for help.

658
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:58,585
I wanted to be one woman
you've had known,

659
00:51:58,811 --> 00:52:01,146
Who had asked you for nothing.

660
00:52:01,532 --> 00:52:05,330
My deep regret is
that you never saw your son.

661
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:10,291
There were times during those years,
I prefer not to remember.

662
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:12,437
But this I can assure you,

663
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:17,496
Whatever the cost,
he'd repayed me a thousand times.

664
00:52:17,857 --> 00:52:20,760
You'd have been proud of him, too.

665
00:52:20,994 --> 00:52:22,849
When he was almost nine.

666
00:52:23,075 --> 00:52:26,753
As much for his sake as mine,
I married.

667
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,803
You know who my husband is.

668
00:52:28,997 --> 00:52:30,885
Yohan Stafe asked to marry me.

669
00:52:31,237 --> 00:52:34,020
Knowing the truth about us,
and about our child.

670
00:52:34,214 --> 00:52:35,261
Oh. How lovely.

671
00:52:35,494 --> 00:52:37,983
Thank you, Yohan.

672
00:52:38,183 --> 00:52:39,558
What a nice birthday!

673
00:52:39,912 --> 00:52:42,084
This..., and Stephan home.

674
00:52:42,281 --> 00:52:44,648
You know,
I'm not good at saying such things.

675
00:52:44,841 --> 00:52:48,901
But... Lisa, I want you to be
as happy as you may be.

676
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:55,495
If I were really deserving why,
I'll be ready on time.

677
00:52:55,692 --> 00:52:58,541
You are happy?

678
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,105
You are?

679
00:53:04,304 --> 00:53:08,080
Why shouldn't I be?

680
00:53:08,593 --> 00:53:12,369
Let's say Good-night.

681
00:53:15,956 --> 00:53:19,273
Is that your another talent?

682
00:53:19,508 --> 00:53:25,206
He has a lot of talents,
but not until he finishes his milk.

683
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,943
Or for brushing his teeth.

684
00:53:29,144 --> 00:53:30,322
Made in Switzerland.

685
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,550
Switzerland must be a very nice place,
don't you think?

686
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:34,931
Who gave it to you, darling?

687
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:35,860
Her Frank.

688
00:53:36,058 --> 00:53:36,952
Who's Her Frank?

689
00:53:37,146 --> 00:53:38,073
His music teacher.

690
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:40,337
He said that he thinks
that I'm nature talented.

691
00:53:40,572 --> 00:53:41,652
For harmonica?

692
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,121
No. For music.

693
00:53:44,316 --> 00:53:47,000
Oh.

694
00:53:47,197 --> 00:53:48,146
Good night, Stephan.

695
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,318
Good night, sir.

696
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,413
Good night, darling.

697
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,543
Good night, mother.

698
00:53:59,169 --> 00:53:59,736
Mother!

699
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:00,864
Yes!

700
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:04,866
I'll be right back.

701
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:08,668
You remember the last time,
first night I was home from school.

702
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:10,010
Um-hum, what about it?

703
00:54:10,212 --> 00:54:12,602
When you went out,
you let me sleep in your room.

704
00:54:12,966 --> 00:54:13,281
Alright.

705
00:54:13,477 --> 00:54:15,812
It's a special concession
because it's your first night home

706
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:19,782
But hurry. I'm late.

707
00:54:23,113 --> 00:54:25,863
In just a minute.
There's no hurry.

708
00:54:26,058 --> 00:54:27,269
Good night, sir.

709
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:30,314
Good night.

710
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:36,105
You know, Stephan, it might be nicer...

711
00:54:36,301 --> 00:54:39,368
If you could say Good night,
father!instead ofGood nigh

712
00:54:39,726 --> 00:54:41,101
But I've always said it that way.

713
00:54:41,326 --> 00:54:43,563
I think he'd like it
if you could manage to change it.

714
00:54:43,759 --> 00:54:45,832
Suppose you said to me
Good night, Madam.

715
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,487
It would sound very silly, wouldn't it?

716
00:54:48,689 --> 00:54:51,275
Now, promise me you'd go to sleep,
and not wait up for me.

717
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:52,402
I promise.

718
00:54:52,594 --> 00:54:54,188
Would you bring me
the program of the opera?

719
00:54:54,387 --> 00:54:57,202
I promise.

720
00:54:58,388 --> 00:55:00,144
Good night, Madam.

721
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,966
Good night, Sir.

722
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:05,166
After all when a person treats
you so much like his son,

723
00:55:05,398 --> 00:55:07,024
He is make sense of your father.

724
00:55:07,223 --> 00:55:09,198
Alright, mother, if you say so.

725
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,408
Good night.

726
00:55:20,603 --> 00:55:25,044
The course of our lives can
be changed by such little thing

727
00:55:25,245 --> 00:55:29,654
So many passing by,
each intent on his own problems.

728
00:55:29,854 --> 00:55:35,420
So many faces,
that one might be easily lost.

729
00:55:35,615 --> 00:55:39,894
I know now. Nothing happens by chance.

730
00:55:40,289 --> 00:55:46,783
Every moment is measured.
Every step is counted.

731
00:55:46,979 --> 00:55:48,768
Curtain. Curtain going up.

732
00:55:48,964 --> 00:55:49,727
Second act.

733
00:55:49,924 --> 00:55:54,944
Curtain going up. Second act.

734
00:55:55,142 --> 00:55:57,379
Look! Isn't that Stephan Brown?

735
00:55:57,606 --> 00:55:59,844
He played last week.
Is that a concert tour?

736
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:01,665
Pleasure trip, most likely.

737
00:56:01,864 --> 00:56:08,260
The way he's burning himself up,
it's a wonder he's still alive.

738
00:56:08,459 --> 00:56:11,242
Ten years ago, he showed great promise.

739
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:12,483
Too bad.

740
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:15,778
With that talent,
he could've been a great pianist.

741
00:56:15,981 --> 00:56:17,737
Perhaps talent is not enough.

742
00:56:17,933 --> 00:56:20,203
Perhaps he's have too many talents.

743
00:56:20,558 --> 00:56:21,387
Second act!

744
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:25,358
Curtain going up!

745
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:35,785
Sorry.

746
00:56:35,987 --> 00:56:36,848
We're late.

747
00:56:37,043 --> 00:56:39,727
You know the colonel is going...

748
00:56:39,924 --> 00:56:41,550
Everyone is asking for you.

749
00:56:41,749 --> 00:56:42,578
You've made a conquest.

750
00:56:42,773 --> 00:56:48,471
My dear, you should have joined this.

751
00:57:07,613 --> 00:57:10,810
Suddenly, in that one moment.

752
00:57:11,006 --> 00:57:12,916
Every thing was in danger.

753
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,799
Every thing I thought was safe.

754
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:22,304
Somewhere out there were your eyes.
couldn't escape them.Somewhere out there were yo

755
00:57:22,498 --> 00:57:24,986
It's like the first time I saw you.

756
00:57:25,186 --> 00:57:30,622
The years between were melting away.

757
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:31,486
I have a headache.

758
00:57:31,685 --> 00:57:31,968
I'll take you home.

759
00:57:32,164 --> 00:57:33,092
No. Please don't worry.

760
00:57:33,445 --> 00:57:38,597
I'll be alright.
Please stay here.

761
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:52,902
Would you be kind enough
to give my husband a message.

762
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:54,660
He's in 17. Not now.

763
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,808
But after the show.

764
00:57:56,013 --> 00:57:58,053
Tell him, I've decided to go home.
Tell him not to worry.

765
00:57:58,413 --> 00:58:01,229
Thank you.

766
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:11,815
Call my carriage, please.

767
00:58:12,017 --> 00:58:14,385
Yes, Madam.

768
00:58:14,738 --> 00:58:15,153
Sergeant!

769
00:58:15,378 --> 00:58:18,194
Yes, Madam.

770
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,250
Excuse me.

771
00:58:48,476 --> 00:58:50,550
You must realized
that where there's a pursuit.

772
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:53,085
And there'd also be a pursuer.

773
00:58:53,278 --> 00:58:56,443
I've seen you somewhere, I know.

774
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,982
I followed you upstairs.

775
00:58:58,176 --> 00:58:59,737
And watched you in your box.

776
00:58:59,937 --> 00:59:02,304
But I couldn't place you.

777
00:59:02,657 --> 00:59:05,790
And I had to speak with you.

778
00:59:05,986 --> 00:59:10,428
I know how it sounds.
I assure you in this case that it's true.

779
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,733
Believe that, don't you?

780
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:14,756
Yes.
Thank you.

781
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:16,604
Now please, just a moment.

782
00:59:16,806 --> 00:59:20,189
Is that any place we could have met,
that I might have seen

783
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,945
At one of my concerts?

784
00:59:23,144 --> 00:59:24,738
There must have been sometime ago.

785
00:59:24,968 --> 00:59:28,002
I haven't given any concerts
in Vienna lately.

786
00:59:28,202 --> 00:59:30,788
Or anywhere else in that matter.

787
00:59:30,986 --> 00:59:33,408
You don't play anymore?

788
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,499
Oh, it's not quite as final as that.

789
00:59:35,692 --> 00:59:38,376
I always tell myself that,
Beginning next week.

790
00:59:38,572 --> 00:59:40,613
And when next week comes,
it's this week.

791
00:59:40,974 --> 00:59:42,567
So, I wait for next week again.

792
00:59:42,926 --> 00:59:45,316
What are you waiting for?

793
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:47,080
It's a very disturbing question.

794
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:47,879
My carriage...

795
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,496
You can't ask such a question,
and just walk away.

796
00:59:51,697 --> 00:59:54,698
I have a feeling...
please don't think I'm mad.

797
00:59:54,898 --> 00:59:58,444
I know it sounds strange.
I can't explain it.

798
00:59:58,643 --> 01:00:03,565
But I feel that you understand
what I can't even say.

799
01:00:03,765 --> 01:00:07,214
And that you can help me.

800
01:00:07,414 --> 01:00:13,112
Have you ever shopped
for places like cards,

801
01:00:13,656 --> 01:00:14,900
Hoping to find the one...

802
01:00:15,097 --> 01:00:18,643
Lies somewhere at the edge
of your memory.

803
01:00:18,842 --> 01:00:21,876
The one you've been waiting for.

804
01:00:22,234 --> 01:00:24,340
But tonight, when I first saw you.

805
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:27,093
And later
when I watched you in the darkness.

806
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:31,865
It looked like one face amongst others.

807
01:00:32,093 --> 01:00:34,909
Who are you?

808
01:00:36,287 --> 01:00:38,676
Promise me, I'll see you again.
I must see you.

809
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,695
I don't know.

810
01:01:03,688 --> 01:01:09,385
Yohan,
you don't think I want this to happen?

811
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,352
What are you going to do?

812
01:01:12,555 --> 01:01:15,370
I don't know.

813
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:19,810
Lisa. We have a marriage.

814
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:22,916
Perhaps it's not all you once
hoped for. But...

815
01:01:23,118 --> 01:01:27,145
You've a home, and your son.
People who care for you.

816
01:01:27,503 --> 01:01:29,413
I know that, Yohan.

817
01:01:29,616 --> 01:01:31,307
I'll do anything to avoid hurting you.

818
01:01:31,536 --> 01:01:34,734
But I can't help it.

819
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,196
And your son?

820
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:39,151
Can you avoid hurting him?

821
01:01:39,347 --> 01:01:44,106
I have to calm down and see that.

822
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:49,526
There're such things as honor,
and decency.

823
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:52,054
I told myself that hundred times
this one evening.

824
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,928
You talk like it is out of your hands.

825
01:01:55,288 --> 01:01:58,518
It's not, Lisa.
You have a will.

826
01:01:58,745 --> 01:02:01,681
You can do what's right,
what's best for you.

827
01:02:02,043 --> 01:02:04,148
Or you can throw away your life.

828
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:06,769
I have no hopes whatsoever.

829
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:08,761
That's romantic nonsense.

830
01:02:08,957 --> 01:02:10,386
Is it?

831
01:02:10,749 --> 01:02:11,731
Yohan, I can't help it.

832
01:02:11,933 --> 01:02:14,073
I can't dispute that.

833
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:19,542
What about him?
Can him help himself, either?

834
01:02:20,608 --> 01:02:24,384
I know now that he needs me
as much as I always needed him.

835
01:02:24,609 --> 01:02:27,807
Isn't it a bit late for him
to find that out?

836
01:02:28,002 --> 01:02:31,778
We're home, sir.

837
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:42,751
Good night.

838
01:02:42,951 --> 01:02:46,727
Good night, sir.

839
01:02:59,628 --> 01:03:04,845
Lisa. If you do this,
you can never turn back.

840
01:03:05,038 --> 01:03:06,315
You know that, don't you?

841
01:03:06,511 --> 01:03:09,326
Yes.

842
01:03:13,265 --> 01:03:17,423
I warn you. I shall do everything in
my power to prevent it.

843
01:03:48,797 --> 01:03:50,139
Hello, darling. Wake up.

844
01:03:51,357 --> 01:03:57,055
It's time to go to your own room.

845
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,021
Did you have a nice time?

846
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:04,032
Yes, darling.

847
01:04:04,897 --> 01:04:06,392
Good night, father.

848
01:04:06,754 --> 01:04:08,642
Good night.

849
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:10,558
Did you hear? I just said it.

850
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:12,610
Yes, darling.

851
01:04:12,804 --> 01:04:18,502
Tell me about the opera...
was it exciting?

852
01:04:24,424 --> 01:04:25,056
How's that?

853
01:04:25,256 --> 01:04:27,973
You're wonderful.

854
01:04:28,169 --> 01:04:31,945
You're wonderful.

855
01:04:32,234 --> 01:04:35,050
You've always been a wonderful boy.

856
01:04:35,243 --> 01:04:37,830
You know how much that it's meant to me?

857
01:04:38,027 --> 01:04:41,324
Be so proud of you, always.

858
01:04:41,516 --> 01:04:44,365
I know it.

859
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:12,911
Don't worry, mother.

860
01:05:13,111 --> 01:05:15,730
Two weeks will go like an express train.

861
01:05:15,928 --> 01:05:17,074
You sure you're coming?

862
01:05:17,272 --> 01:05:18,221
Of course. I promise.

863
01:05:18,457 --> 01:05:20,246
You can even get
my room in the village for me.

864
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:22,096
I'll get you the same
one you're there last time.

865
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:24,368
The one with the balcony.

866
01:05:24,571 --> 01:05:30,268
Didn't I tell you
that compartment was quaranteened?

867
01:05:30,717 --> 01:05:31,611
I'm sorry, Madam.

868
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:34,260
This compartment had to be closed up.

869
01:05:34,462 --> 01:05:35,989
I'll take you to the next cart forwards.

870
01:05:36,191 --> 01:05:38,974
That's good.
I'll be near the local motive.

871
01:05:39,167 --> 01:05:42,943
I'll take the box.

872
01:05:44,097 --> 01:05:45,820
Do we have two local motives
on our train?

873
01:05:46,017 --> 01:05:47,676
We usually get along with one.

874
01:05:47,874 --> 01:05:49,784
But I talked to the engineer.

875
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:52,355
How about that one over there?
You can have two seats in there.

876
01:05:52,547 --> 01:05:54,752
He's traveling alone.

877
01:05:55,108 --> 01:05:56,483
Don't worry about it, Madam.

878
01:05:56,709 --> 01:05:57,538
I'll take good care of him.

879
01:05:57,733 --> 01:05:59,424
We leave in about a minute.

880
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,859
Better hurry and get your seat.

881
01:06:02,054 --> 01:06:04,062
You'll see better if you sit over here.

882
01:06:04,263 --> 01:06:05,987
And if you get chilly,
you can put up the window.

883
01:06:06,216 --> 01:06:08,999
Yes, mother.

884
01:06:09,193 --> 01:06:14,050
Stephan. You know how I've
longed for you to being home.

885
01:06:14,411 --> 01:06:16,234
And now I can't even explain.

886
01:06:16,395 --> 01:06:19,712
I hope some day, very soon...
I'll be able to give you a reason.

887
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:24,168
But now, you just have to believe
that it's for your own goo

888
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:25,992
I don't mind going back so much.

889
01:06:26,222 --> 01:06:28,263
Especially when you're coming so soon.

890
01:06:28,623 --> 01:06:29,768
It'd be like two vocations.

891
01:06:29,968 --> 01:06:31,146
Alright, darling.

892
01:06:31,504 --> 01:06:34,472
I'll show you the new walk
we found since you're there last

893
01:06:34,673 --> 01:06:38,449
Better get out, lady.

894
01:06:42,643 --> 01:06:44,367
You'll write me often, won't you?

895
01:06:44,564 --> 01:06:50,895
Yes mother But I can't write very often.
We've only two weeks.

896
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:56,792
Good-bye, mother. Two weeks.

897
01:07:29,474 --> 01:07:32,322
Make way, please.

898
01:07:32,515 --> 01:07:33,890
Make way, please.

899
01:07:34,084 --> 01:07:36,899
What happened?

900
01:07:37,189 --> 01:07:38,684
Someone hurt?

901
01:07:38,885 --> 01:07:40,129
No reason to get alarmed.

902
01:07:40,326 --> 01:07:41,570
They said that it's typhus.

903
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,268
Typhus?

904
01:07:42,662 --> 01:07:47,398
Yes. Typhus on the train.

905
01:08:01,484 --> 01:08:01,986
Yes. Madam.

906
01:08:02,189 --> 01:08:04,294
Yes. Mr. Brown. Stephan Brown.

907
01:08:04,653 --> 01:08:09,411
Brown? One moment, please.

908
01:08:09,647 --> 01:08:11,055
Fritz!

909
01:08:11,375 --> 01:08:13,962
Um?

910
01:08:17,714 --> 01:08:20,562
Could you tell me has Mr. Brown
been here this evening?

911
01:08:20,915 --> 01:08:23,763
Oh, Mr. Brown is no longer
a customer of ours.

912
01:08:23,955 --> 01:08:25,417
Not for sometime.

913
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:28,715
Mr. Brown these days
is more likely to be found in the Ritz.

914
01:08:28,917 --> 01:08:31,765
Thank you.

915
01:09:00,896 --> 01:09:01,790
Good evening, Madam.

916
01:09:01,984 --> 01:09:04,701
I still have nice flowers left.
I'm closing up.

917
01:09:04,896 --> 01:09:10,462
And I've saved you
a nice bouquet. Very cheap.

918
01:09:14,403 --> 01:09:18,147
I'll take those, the white ones.

919
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:19,613
Don't bother wrapping them up.

920
01:09:19,813 --> 01:09:23,589
Doesn't matter.

921
01:10:07,157 --> 01:10:11,468
Now, drive.
Drive on!

922
01:10:34,909 --> 01:10:39,645
Stephan Brown. Is he in?

923
01:10:48,481 --> 01:10:51,297
Thank you.

924
01:11:36,817 --> 01:11:38,312
This is a surprise.

925
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:41,195
But I assure you're a very happy one.

926
01:11:41,554 --> 01:11:46,826
John didn't prepare me
for such pleasant occassion.

927
01:11:47,188 --> 01:11:49,076
I thought last night...

928
01:11:49,268 --> 01:11:52,717
The darkness might've
been tricks with my eyes.

929
01:11:53,078 --> 01:11:55,599
You're even more
beautiful than I imagined.

930
01:11:55,959 --> 01:11:57,268
Very kind of you.

931
01:11:57,495 --> 01:12:00,595
This is just the hour
for a bit late supper.

932
01:12:00,792 --> 01:12:01,720
Or is it too late?

933
01:12:01,913 --> 01:12:03,637
Oh, it makes no different.
You're here.

934
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:06,834
As far as I'm concerned,
all the clocks in the world will st

935
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:08,759
Exuse me a moment.

936
01:12:08,955 --> 01:12:10,744
John!

937
01:12:11,132 --> 01:12:12,659
John, I'm sorry to send you out so late.

938
01:12:13,053 --> 01:12:15,060
Would you go out to the coners,
and get a few things.

939
01:12:15,261 --> 01:12:20,959
We're going to have supper.
The usual things.

940
01:12:25,696 --> 01:12:29,723
John makes life possible for
a hopelessly single man.

941
01:12:29,922 --> 01:12:32,443
She fascinates you, too!

942
01:12:32,674 --> 01:12:33,438
Do you remember...

943
01:12:33,634 --> 01:12:36,352
The Greek built the
Statue of God they didn't know.

944
01:12:36,548 --> 01:12:38,752
But hope someday would come to them.

945
01:12:39,108 --> 01:12:41,018
But mine happened to be a Goddess.

946
01:12:41,221 --> 01:12:43,523
And you've never found her?

947
01:12:43,878 --> 01:12:46,268
For years, I never woke in the morning,

948
01:12:46,663 --> 01:12:48,769
But I said to myself,

949
01:12:48,968 --> 01:12:53,704
Perhaps today she will come.
My life will be really to begin.

950
01:12:53,929 --> 01:12:57,247
Sometimes it seemed very near.

951
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:03,049
But now I'm older, I know better.

952
01:13:03,693 --> 01:13:05,930
Even for yourself,
you don't play anymore?

953
01:13:06,125 --> 01:13:09,804
Oh, I remember last night,
you're kind of being interested...

954
01:13:09,998 --> 01:13:11,886
I forgot John locked
it when I went away.

955
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:14,830
Nowadays, I'm away quite a lot of time.

956
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:19,248
I'll ask him for the key
when he comes back.

957
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:21,165
You wear very lovely.

958
01:13:21,362 --> 01:13:22,639
It's a beautiful dress.

959
01:13:22,834 --> 01:13:24,428
Thank you.

960
01:13:24,627 --> 01:13:27,530
How could you do that?
Give it up altogether.

961
01:13:27,892 --> 01:13:30,478
Well, if you're so curious,
I'll tell you.

962
01:13:30,837 --> 01:13:33,260
One night I came back to this room.

963
01:13:33,462 --> 01:13:35,884
I had given a concert like
all the others.

964
01:13:36,118 --> 01:13:38,737
Not bad, and not worse.

965
01:13:38,935 --> 01:13:41,903
Afterwards,
they said all the usual things.

966
01:13:42,105 --> 01:13:45,270
The things you say
when you are not really convinced.

967
01:13:45,465 --> 01:13:46,546
So, I happened to look into the mirror.

968
01:13:46,746 --> 01:13:49,300
This one here.

969
01:13:49,498 --> 01:13:51,921
The young protege was no longer young.

970
01:13:52,123 --> 01:13:55,255
Certainly wasn't perpetual.

971
01:13:55,453 --> 01:13:58,072
Since then, I found out a thing to do.

972
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:02,046
More amuzing things.

973
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:12,514
I knew last night. Didn't you?

974
01:14:27,847 --> 01:14:32,289
I haven't even
offered to fix you a drink.

975
01:14:32,489 --> 01:14:32,870
Stephan.

976
01:14:33,224 --> 01:14:35,200
Yes.

977
01:14:35,401 --> 01:14:38,020
I came here...
I have something to tell you.

978
01:14:38,218 --> 01:14:39,527
If it's something to do with you,
lm very interested.

979
01:14:39,883 --> 01:14:41,477
It has to do with us.

980
01:14:41,836 --> 01:14:44,684
We can't possibily
be serious this early in the morning.

981
01:14:44,908 --> 01:14:46,250
At least not without
a glass of champagne.

982
01:14:46,605 --> 01:14:49,923
Won't be a minute.

983
01:14:50,126 --> 01:14:53,608
Champagne tastes much better
after midnight, don't you think

984
01:14:53,807 --> 01:14:54,920
Much better.

985
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,360
I've just came back from America.

986
01:14:56,561 --> 01:14:58,088
It's a fascinating country.

987
01:14:58,288 --> 01:14:59,598
The men are fond of money.

988
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:02,255
And their wives... are fond of Europeans.

989
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:04,109
Must have been a wonderful trip?

990
01:15:04,306 --> 01:15:08,847
Have you travelled a great deal?

991
01:15:09,044 --> 01:15:14,742
I couldn't get
you out of my mind all day.

992
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:16,623
No, I don't believe you.

993
01:15:16,823 --> 01:15:18,579
If I only knew you're coming...

994
01:15:18,775 --> 01:15:19,823
To tell you the truth,

995
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:22,606
I never dared to hope
that you could've managed so soon.

996
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,903
But you're so cleaver,
you've arranged it so beautifully.

997
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:29,205
You know, you're a very strange woman.

998
01:15:29,434 --> 01:15:30,383
Am I?

999
01:15:30,747 --> 01:15:35,833
Something you've said last night,
it keeps running through my

1000
01:15:36,029 --> 01:15:37,556
What was that?

1001
01:15:37,757 --> 01:15:42,199
I'll tell you in just a moment
as soon as I get the ice.

1002
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:45,149
Are you getting lonely out there.

1003
01:15:45,343 --> 01:15:48,192
Very lonely.

1004
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:55,039
I come to tell you about us.

1005
01:15:55,267 --> 01:15:58,082
To offer you my whole life.

1006
01:15:58,276 --> 01:16:03,974
But you didn't even remember me.

1007
01:16:40,145 --> 01:16:42,633
Can I take you somewhere, young lady?

1008
01:16:42,866 --> 01:16:45,517
Anywhere at all?

1009
01:16:45,715 --> 01:16:50,451
It makes no difference.

1010
01:17:10,139 --> 01:17:12,595
I don't remember where I went.

1011
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,771
Time will pass me.

1012
01:17:14,972 --> 01:17:16,980
Not in days, or in hours.

1013
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:21,051
But in the distance
that put between us.

1014
01:17:21,246 --> 01:17:24,542
Now I think again.
I went to my son.

1015
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:27,198
But is was too late.

1016
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:30,709
He died last night from typhus.

1017
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:34,078
Without even knowing I was there.

1018
01:17:34,274 --> 01:17:36,696
Now I'm alone.

1019
01:17:36,931 --> 01:17:40,729
My head throbs,
and my temple are burning.

1020
01:17:40,965 --> 01:17:46,204
Perhaps God had been kind.
I, too, have caught the fever.

1021
01:17:46,406 --> 01:17:50,368
If this letter reaches you,
believe this...

1022
01:17:50,568 --> 01:17:54,344
That I love you now as
I've always loved you.

1023
01:17:54,697 --> 01:17:55,645
My life can be measured...

1024
01:17:55,849 --> 01:17:59,811
By the moments
that I've with you and our child.

1025
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:03,492
If only you could've shared
those moments.

1026
01:18:03,691 --> 01:18:07,621
If only you could've recognized
what was always yours.

1027
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:10,985
Could've found whar was never lost.

1028
01:18:11,182 --> 01:18:13,998
If only...

1029
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:57,934
You remembered her?

1030
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:19,093
Lisa...

1031
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:25,012
Lisa...

1032
01:20:59,204 --> 01:21:02,980
Bring my things.

1033
01:21:30,221 --> 01:21:33,997
Ready, gentleman?

1034
01:21:36,527 --> 01:21:40,652
If only you could've recognized
what was always yours.

1035
01:21:40,944 --> 01:21:44,044
Could've found what was never lost...
