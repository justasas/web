1
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:39,533
Dr. Blood!

2
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,910
Who is it?

3
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:47,078
That we'll know better
when you've opened the door.

4
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,515
Me?

5
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,616
My mistake. After I've opened the door.

6
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,785
Open it, quick!

7
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:00,594
Why, Jeremy Pitt, isn't it?

8
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:04,463
It's your friend, Lord Gildoy, wounded
at Andrew Baynes' farm by the river.

9
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,092
-The rash fool.
-He sent me for you. No time to lose.

10
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,264
Why, to be sure, I'll lose none,
nor my head either.

11
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,399
Come in and regain yours
while I get my things.

12
00:03:12,475 --> 00:03:14,466
-I'll wait here.
-As you please.

13
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:16,637
Come, Mrs. Barlow, help me dress.

14
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,045
Jeremy, how was the battle?

15
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,211
Battle? Slaughter, rather!

16
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,312
What can clubs do against cannon?

17
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:31,156
In case this business keeps me overlong,
take care you water my geraniums...

18
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:33,252
especially those
under the bedroom window.

19
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:35,263
Geraniums. Won't you ever grow up?

20
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:38,129
One would think you were still
at medical school.

21
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,935
Geraniums!

22
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:41,834
You would think of geraniums...

23
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,465
when every other able-bodied man
is out fighting.

24
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,839
It's out of favor I seem to be with you,
my vinegary virgin.

25
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,669
-Half the town is saying you're a papist.
-Why?

26
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:54,239
Because I have the sense to sleep tonight
instead of rushing to my ruin...

27
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,911
in an attempt to put
this Duke of Monmouth on the throne?

28
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,783
He'd be even worse than King James.

29
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:01,187
Make haste with that cloak there,
my pretty one.

30
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:03,452
And the other half of the town
that defends you...

31
00:04:03,526 --> 00:04:05,892
claims that you're just a coward.

32
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,530
Mrs. Barlow, my darling,
you can tell them, if you like...

33
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,397
that I've been most anywhere
that fighting was in evidence.

34
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:16,302
Fought for the French against the Spanish,
and the Spanish against the French...

35
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:19,034
and I learned my seamanship
in the Dutch Navy.

36
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:23,170
But having had adventure enough
in six years to last me six lives...

37
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:26,807
I came here, hung up the sword,
and picked up the lancet.

38
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,410
Became a man of peace and not of war.
A healer, not a slayer...

39
00:04:31,487 --> 00:04:35,446
and that I am going to be as long as
I'm on top of the sod and not under it.

40
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:46,460
-Will you be back for breakfast?
-Who knows, my pretty one?

41
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:01,542
The worst is done, my friend.
Give your mind peace.

42
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:26,839
The King's men!

43
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:31,447
There's nothing to fear.
This is a Christian country.

44
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:34,449
Christian men don't make war
on the wounded...

45
00:05:34,517 --> 00:05:36,246
or those who shelter them.

46
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,323
I'm Capt. Hobart of Col. Kirke's dragoons.

47
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,023
What rebels do you harbor?

48
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,260
No rebels. This wounded gentleman--

49
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:53,234
No need to ask
how he came by his wounds.

50
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:55,270
A rebel. Out with him.

51
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:00,976
This man can't be moved
without peril to his life.

52
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:04,536
Who the devil may you be?

53
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:06,943
Peter Blood, Medicinae Baccalaureus.

54
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,643
Don't fling your French at me.

55
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:10,879
Latin, my dull friend.
lt means I'm a doctor.

56
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,648
Or a liar.

57
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:16,624
lf your wit were as big as your voice,
it's the great man you'd be for this.

58
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:19,422
You may find me great enough
to hang you!

59
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,196
Yes, I don't doubt it.

60
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:24,995
You've the looks and manners
of a hangman.

61
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:27,195
Take him away, and the others, too!

62
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:01,370
''ln the name of His Majesty,
Our Sovereign Lord...

63
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:05,032
''prisoners of the Crown,
you stand indicted...

64
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:07,201

00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:11,007

66
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,139
''of this Kingdom of England.

00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:15,514
''Therefore, you are charged

68
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:18,110
''against the most illustrious

69
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:21,179
''Prince James II by the grace of God...

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,958
''Having no fear of God in your hearts...

00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,520
''and being moved

''you have failed in the love

74
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:35,965
''and have moved to disturb

75

77
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,974
''Therefore, you are here to be tried

79
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:54,586
''and by a jury of 12 good men and true.''

80
00:07:58,261 --> 00:08:00,923
James Haynsworth, hold up your hand.

81
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:03,696
-Guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

82
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:07,395
-Harold Carron, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

83
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,964
-Andrew Baynes, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

84
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:16,477
-Jeremy Pitt, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

85
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:21,483
-John Wolverstone, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

86
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:25,644
Uriah Ogle, guilty or not guilty?

87
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:27,814
Guilty. Praise the Lord.

88
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,690
Henry Hagthorpe, guilty or not guilty?

89
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:33,384
Guilty.

90
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:38,422
-Lord Chester Dyke, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

91
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:42,567
Peter Blood, guilty or not guilty?

92
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:45,004
lt's entirely innocent, I am.

93
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,837
Take the stand and face His Lordship.

94
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:55,082
Are you guilty or not guilty?
You must use the right words.

95
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:58,950
Words, is it? Not guilty.

96
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:03,319
And speaking of words,
I'd like to say a few about the injustice...

97
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:06,293
of keeping an innocent man
locked up for three months...

98
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:10,958
in such filth and heat and ill-feeding
that my chief regret is I didn't try...

99
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:13,627
to pull down the filthy fellow
that sits on the throne.

100
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:15,000
Silence!

101
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:18,700
Are you entirely ignorant
of the proper procedure of the court?

102
00:09:18,774 --> 00:09:20,742
Most happily ignorant up to now.

103
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,108
I could gladly have done
without this acquaintance.

104
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,044
Enough of this.

105
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:29,581
There is nothing more to be said,
except the passing of sentence.

106
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:32,711
May it please Your Lordship,
but there's a deal more to be said!

107
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,278
Silence!

108
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:38,088
-How now, fellow?
-There is the little matter of my defense.

109
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,390
Very well, then...

110
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:43,323
but in heaven's name, be brief, man.

111
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,562
We have much to do.

112
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,329
I am guilty of nothing, my lord...

113
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:52,473
unless it be adjudged a crime
that a man try to live peaceably.

114
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:55,271
Living peaceably
with the army of Monmouth?

115
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:57,539
I was not with Monmouth's army, my lord.

116
00:09:57,613 --> 00:10:00,343
I was arrested while engaging
in my profession as physician.

117
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:04,045
What's this?
You tell us you're a doctor, you rogue?

118
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,387
And as such was summoned
to the aid of Lord Gildoy...

119
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:10,619
by Jeremy Pitt, who can so testify.

120
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,628
Master Pitt will testify.

121
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,130
He that is himself a confessed traitor.

122
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,729
-ls that your witness?
-There is also Andrew Baynes.

123
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:22,669
Master Baynes
will have enough testifying...

124
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:26,071
in a useless effort
to keep his own neck from the halter.

125
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:29,009
I can bring a hundred from Bridgwater,
the town where I live.

126
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,171
We've no time for all this.

127
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:34,512
lf these other traitors
are as stubborn as you...

128
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,211
I may sit here till the next assizes.

129
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:39,586
Very well, then.

130
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:42,488
There's a witness I'll give you
that you can't deny:

131
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,116
yourself, sir.

132
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:48,027
For if I'm not physician,
how is it I know that you're a dying man?

133
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:56,837
The death to which you're dooming
hundreds of poor men daily...

134
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:01,002
in a frantic effort to send their souls
to perdition before your own...

135
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,977
is a light pleasantry...

136
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:05,275
compared to the bleeding death
in the lungs...

137
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:08,044
to which the great Judge
has condemned you.

138
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,177
Now, fellow,
we'll be done with the witnesses...

139
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,485
and I will convict you
out of your own rascally mouth.

140
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:20,620
When this Pitt came to summon you,
as you claim...

141
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,563
did you know you were called
to attend another rebel?

142
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:26,328
My business was with his wounds,
not his politics.

143
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:28,302
Did you know the law...

144
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,237
that any person who does
knowingly receive, harbor, comfort...

145
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:37,211
or succor a rebel
is as guilty as if he himself bore arms?

146
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,112
I only knew my sacred duty as a physician.

147
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:44,149
Your sacred duty, rogue, is to your king!

148
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,925
I thought it was to my fellow man.

149
00:11:57,566 --> 00:12:01,297
lt's a fearful thing
to send a man's soul to perdition...

150
00:12:02,705 --> 00:12:04,639
but I am bound by my conscience...

151
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:08,040
and my love of my king to deal out justice.

152
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:17,975
Therefore, I instruct you,
gentlemen of the jury...

153
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:21,617
that inasmuch as Peter Blood
has admitted...

154
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,124
aiding a traitor to your king...

155
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:26,991
you do bring in a verdict of guilty...

156
00:12:27,062 --> 00:12:29,257
that he may be hanged...

157
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,993
for the high treason he has committed.

158
00:12:38,073 --> 00:12:41,065
What a creature must sit on the throne...

159
00:12:41,143 --> 00:12:44,135
who lets a man like you
deal out his justice.

160
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:53,387
-Your Majesty.
-Sunderland, what brings you here?

161
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:55,356
These numerous hangings.

162
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:58,825
Splendid, aren't they?
We kill the rebels, we kill the rebellion.

163
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:00,521
Very true, Your Majesty...

164
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:02,928
but a foolish waste
of valuable human flesh.

165
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:04,022
How so?

166
00:13:04,433 --> 00:13:08,927
Your Majesty's colonies in the West Indies
are urgently in need of slaves.

167
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:13,971
A healthy, vigorous man
can be reckoned worth from £10 to £20.

168
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,534
Splendid, Sunderland.

169
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,808
Send out word immediately that the King
is graciously pleased to command...

170
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,943
that all rebels convicted
but not yet hanged...

171
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:25,350
be gathered together...

172
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:28,982
and shipped by the first available boats
to the Americas.

173
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,750
Give us water!
There are men dying down here.

174
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:19,435
You'd think they'd take better care
of a valuable cargo like us.

175
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:42,054
Ahoy, the deck! Land sighted, Port Royal!

176
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:54,734
lt's a truly royal clemency we're granted,
my friends...

177
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:57,975
one well worthy of King James.

178
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:04,111
He spares us the mercifully quick
extinction of the hangman's rope...

179
00:15:04,219 --> 00:15:06,483
and gives the slow death of slavery.

180
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:11,283
He grants us our lives
in exchange for a living death.

181
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,058
lt's an uncertain world entirely.

182
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:36,480
''Be it known, men, that these prisoners
who stand before you...

183
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:39,385
''are now to be sold at a right
and fitting price.

184
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:41,923
''They may be put to labor
in the sulfur mines...

185
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:44,391
''or on the plantations
for a period of 10 years.

186
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,394
''And the parties
to whom they are assigned...

187
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:48,828
''must enter into security
for the proper punishment...

188
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:49,921
''of their offense.''

189
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,899
His Excellency, the Governor of Port Royal.

190
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:54,993
Guards, attention! Present muskets.

191
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,704
Good day, Captain. Lovely day, isn't it?
Or is it?

192
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:02,570
-Good day, Dixon.
-Good day, Governor.

193
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:05,512
I suppose we can begin this sale now,
Governor.

194
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:07,515
No, better wait for Col. Bishop.

195
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,552
He has the privilege
of being late for everything.

196
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,382
Yes, I know.

197
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:13,853
There he is.

198
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:28,831
-Good afternoon, Col. Bishop.
-Good afternoon, Governor.

199
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,394
Good afternoon, Miss Arabella.

200
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:32,497
How is my darling, the Governor,
and his foot?

201
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,270
Every day I think my gout
can't get any worse...

202
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:37,369
and every day it does.

203
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:40,607
My dear Colonel,
according to the King's request...

204
00:16:40,683 --> 00:16:44,449
it is for you to take first choice
of this dainty nosegay...

205
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:48,018
and at your own price.

206
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:50,357
Egad, they're an appalling lot...

207
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,587
not likely to be of much value
on the plantation.

208
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:54,390
The less you want, the more for Dixon.

209
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:57,398
-Dixon? Uncle, I wish you'd buy them all.
-Buy them all?

210
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:59,263
To keep them out of Dixon's hands.

211
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:02,326
I perceive somebody's been talking
behind my back...

212
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:03,837
telling the truth.

213
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:06,898
-And you can joke.
-Arabella dear, don't be childish.

214
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,273
These men are rebels against their king.

215
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:11,244
They should be hanged, drawn,
and quartered.

216
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:14,214
-Any fate they meet is too good for them.
-Your uncle is right.

217
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,774
-Let the sale commence.
-My foot!

218
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:20,788
My dear, the law is the law,
and it's His Majesty's law...

219
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:22,618
and must be obeyed.

220
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:25,989
The best of the lot.

221
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:29,230
Open your mouth.

222
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:34,468
-£20.
-Sold!

223
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:37,004
Sold to Col. Bishop for £20.

224
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:43,442
-As if he were buying horses.
-Yes, quite.

225
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:57,650
-Same price.
-This is Jeremy Pitt, ship's pilot...

226
00:17:57,726 --> 00:17:59,387
young and sturdy.

227
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:04,860
-Same price.
-Sold!

228
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:07,094
Sold to Col. Bishop for £20.

229
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:18,272
Quiet!

230
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:22,814
Open your mouth.

231
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:44,037
His pride has bought him a ticket
to Dixon's mines.

232
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,203
He isn't there yet.

233
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:52,211
-My dear, consider your social position!
-Uncle!

234
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:00,187
-Which one?
-That one.

235
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:03,415
-Him? I will not.
-But I want you to.

236
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:07,087
No. Let him cool his head
in Dixon's mines. I'll have none of him.

237
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:13,191
-£5.
-£5? That's an insulting sum to offer.

238
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:16,704
-Does anyone offer more?
-£6.

239
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:21,499
£7.

240
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,442
You're making an exhibition of yourself...

241
00:19:23,512 --> 00:19:26,208
a girl like you,
bidding for a slave before these people.

242
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:27,680
-Will you buy him?
-Certainly not.

243
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,909
£8.

244
00:19:33,322 --> 00:19:35,256
When a lady's interested in a man....

245
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:37,815
Calm down, Dixon,
£8 is nothing for such a man...

246
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,187
a skilled physician,
a gentleman, and a scholar.

247
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:45,096
-All right, £9.
-£10!

248
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:49,470
lt's apparent Miss Bishop wants him
more than I do.

249
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:51,802
Sold to Miss Arabella Bishop for £10.

250
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:56,103
Sold!

251
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,477
£10, sold.

252
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:02,008
What would you like done with him,
Miss Bishop?

253
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:04,746
Why, I don't know.

254
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,517
You're extremely foolish.
lt might have cost you your life.

255
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:14,662
lt was fortunate for you
that I was here to save you.

256
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:19,096
I hardly consider it fortunate to be bought
by anyone by the name of Bishop.

257
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:22,329
You could learn a lesson in gratitude.

258
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:24,564
I could thank for not interfering.

259
00:20:24,907 --> 00:20:28,741
As it happens, you are hardly in a position
to have anything to say about it.

260
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,040
You may join the others belonging
to my uncle...

261
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:34,276
and henceforth you may take your orders
from him.

262
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:38,342
Your very humble slave, Miss Bishop.

263
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,073
Come on. Move on, there.

264
00:22:00,302 --> 00:22:02,770
Last night, this dog attempted to escape.

265
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:05,838
Today you'll see what happens
to those who forget...

266
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:09,206
that my friend King James
did you all a favor...

267
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:12,075
in saving you from your just fate
on the gallows.

268
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:14,138
Show them the iron, Kent.

269
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:24,420
F-T.

270
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,753
Whoever wears that brand
is known as a fugitive traitor...

271
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,627
and will be treated as such.

272
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,294
Burn those letters in your brain...

273
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,135
lest they be burned on your hides, too.

274
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:41,138
There speaks a fit friend for King James
if ever I heard one.

275
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:45,774
Would I had him and his friend James
roasting on a spit over that fire.

276
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:51,084
Great would be the burning thereof
and loud the rejoicing in Heaven.

277
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,921
Do your duty!

278
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:11,970
What a cruel shame
that any man is made to suffer so.

279
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:18,006
-This beastly gout!
-Perhaps a new dressing will help.

280
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:19,102
Perhaps.

281
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:20,910
-I have it here.
-Put it down.

282
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,313
So sorry, Doctor.

283
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,249
Easy, you clumsy louts!

284
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,811
-We won't hurt you, Governor.
-You thick-fingered jackasses!

285
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,156
His Excellency will have his little joke.

286
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:32,489
lll-begotten bunglers!

287
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:35,086
-Blundering pill peddlers!
-Your Excellency--

288
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,721
That is the final straw.

289
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:43,030
Out of this house...

290
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:45,198
and never let me see your faces again.

291
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:47,707
-But think of our reputations.
-Hang your reputations!

292
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:50,267
Leave me! I don't want to see you again!

293
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,540
Away! Out!

294
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:54,980
I don't want to see you!
Out into the streets!

295
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:59,110
Stop shouting.
You brought on my headache again.

296
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,451
Good! Hannibal, come take my crutch.

297
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,557
Easy, now. Help me up with my foot.

298
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:06,389
No remedy. Why, thank you, dear.

299
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,499
Why doesn't His Excellency
try another doctor?

300
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:15,763
Another doctor?

301
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:18,237
There are only those two
on this wretched island...

302
00:24:18,306 --> 00:24:21,036
-and each one is worse than his partner.
-There is another.

303
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:24,476
And according to what I've heard,
he became a slave by being a doctor.

304
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,945
A slave?

305
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:29,711
Would you elevate a slave
to the position of doctor to the Governor?

306
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,548
-ls he a good doctor?
-I don't know.

307
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:39,950
Why are you laughing?

308
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:43,264
I'm just thinking how annoyed
Peter Blood would be...

309
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:45,265
if I did him another favor.

310
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:51,537
Your Excellency, there are diverse citizens
of this sovereign island...

311
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:53,540
who come before you with complaints.

312
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:55,599
Complaints, complaints.

313
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:59,447
Can none of my citizens
follow the example of their governor...

314
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:02,946
who endures the utmost agony
without a murmur?

315
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,248
-Easy there, fellow.
-Did I hurt you, sir?

316
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:09,950
No, but I thought you were going to.

317
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:13,886
Your Excellency,
this vagrant hides his sins...

318
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:16,055
behind the name of Honesty Nuttall.

319
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:20,067
-He's charged with being in debt.
-State your case, fellow, and no lies.

320
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:22,467
I was on the way to pay the butcher
on Tuesday...

321
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:26,268
as Honesty Nuttall is my name,
when I chanced on a poor old beggar.

322
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:27,831
lt was Jones from the grog shop...

323
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,968
who begged me to have a drink with him.

324
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:32,036
Try standing on it, Your Honor.

325
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:36,113
Stand on that bundle of pain? Impossible.

326
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:40,013
I remembered in time my poor
starving wife in need of the five bob.

327
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:43,854
What is this all about? Silence!

328
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,684
-Sit down.
-What's he here for?

329
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:49,161
For debt, Your Excellency,
and the prevaricator--

330
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:52,826
lf it's for debt,
don't annoy me with such petty things.

331
00:25:52,901 --> 00:25:54,801
Order him to work it off.

332
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:58,032
Work? Not that, anything but work.

333
00:25:58,106 --> 00:25:59,403
What's your trade?

334
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,773
I'm a ship's carpenter
when the painful necessity arises.

335
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,309
Take him to work on the docks...

336
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:07,246
and don't you attempt to escape
till every farthing's paid...

337
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,306
or I'll stretch your hide on the rack!

338
00:26:09,384 --> 00:26:11,784
Escape? How could a debtor escape
from this island...

339
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:14,219
even if he had a boat to do it with?

340
00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:17,258
I couldn't escape any more
than a slave could escape.

341
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,458
I can walk.

342
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,459
Wonderful, my dear fellow.

343
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:26,500
Only two months' treatment,
and I'm a well man.

344
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:28,126
lt's a miracle.

345
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,999
-The next complaint--
-Drat the next complaint. I can walk.

346
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:33,597
Come, Doctor.

347
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:36,838
You'll get your reward for this,
Peter Blood.

348
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:40,711
-From now on, you're my physician.
-Your Excellency is too kind.

349
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:43,945
Come back early tomorrow.
You're always welcome, Dr. Blood.

350
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:07,430
Hello.

351
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:22,013
Don't I know you?

352
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,919
A lady should know her own property.

353
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:28,692
-My property?
-Let me refresh your memory.

354
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:32,196
My name is Peter Blood,
and I'm worth precisely £10.

355
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:36,698
Forgive me for not recognizing you,
Dr. Blood.

356
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:38,534
You're so changed...

357
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,234
for the better.

358
00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:43,573
The Governor tells me
I have you to thank for that.

359
00:27:43,645 --> 00:27:45,909
You don't sound very grateful, Dr. Blood.

360
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,178
Do you think I'd be grateful for an easy life
when my friends are treated like animals?

361
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,812
lt's they deserve your favors, not I.
They're all honest rebels.

362
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:56,948
I was snoring in my bed
while they were trying to free England...

363
00:27:57,025 --> 00:27:58,652
from an unclean tyrant.

364
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:01,023
I believe you're talking treason.

365
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,127
I hope I'm not obscure.

366
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:05,359
-You could be flogged for that.
-No.

367
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:09,068
The Governor would never allow it.
He has the gout.

368
00:28:09,237 --> 00:28:10,761
You depend upon that?

369
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:15,000
I intend to, for all it's worth,
and that promises to be considerable.

370
00:28:17,412 --> 00:28:21,178
But you'd hardly know about that.
You've probably never had the gout.

371
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:27,114
-Good afternoon, Miss Bishop.
-Good afternoon.

372
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,579
15-2, 15-4, and a pair are six.

373
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:05,351
-Another?
-What else is there to do...

374
00:29:05,427 --> 00:29:08,692
ever since you ruined the Governor's foot
and our reputations with it?

375
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:12,426
-I ruined the Governor's foot?
-I tell you, Doctor, you're methods are--

376
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,229
-Someone coming.
-A patient?

377
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:15,496
A patient!

378
00:29:18,807 --> 00:29:21,708
-I beg your pardon, Doctor. I'm so sorry.
-lt's all right.

379
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,746
Come in.

380
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,317
Good afternoon, colleagues. Dr. Bronson.

381
00:29:33,621 --> 00:29:36,385
-Dr. Whacker.
-Good afternoon.

382
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,856
How's business, my friends?

383
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:39,951
-Terrible.
-Good.

384
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,496
-Terribly good.
-That relieves me.

385
00:29:42,664 --> 00:29:45,030
I had heard that things
were not altogether....

386
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:47,601
ldle gossip, obviously.

387
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,132
You intend to remain here?

388
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:54,070
Remain here? Why not?

389
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,344
lt's queer.

390
00:29:57,512 --> 00:30:01,278
There are you, free to come and go as
you please, and you choose to stay here.

391
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:05,809
While I, who hate this pestilential island....
Such are the quirks of circumstance.

392
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:09,112
I must be running along, gentlemen.

393
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,521
Good day, gentlemen.

394
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:17,292
lt's pleasant to see
everything so prosperous with you here.

395
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,264
-Not so hasty.
-Just a moment.

396
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:23,099
There's something I'd like to ask you.

397
00:30:23,271 --> 00:30:24,795
Well, gentlemen?

398
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,534
Have you been thinking of leaving us,
Doctor?

399
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:31,143
Leaving? Now, Doctor.

400
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:33,380
How could a slave think of leaving?

401
00:30:33,448 --> 00:30:37,908
Or even if he were fool enough to try,
by what means could he hope to escape?

402
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:41,451
And where, for example,
could he raise the few pounds necessary...

403
00:30:41,523 --> 00:30:44,185
to purchase even a small boat?

404
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,319
-We might supply it.
-You?

405
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:51,659
-Now, gentlemen.
-Now, let's talk this thing over.

406
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:55,067
Now, if you'll just sit down here.

407
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:57,967
Now then, how much will you need?

408
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,805
£20 might buy a small wherry,
£10 more might equip it.

409
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:03,343
He's right.

410
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:06,242
-He means--
-You needn't tell me what he means.

411
00:31:06,314 --> 00:31:09,408
I know two Christian gentlemen
when I see them.

412
00:31:09,884 --> 00:31:14,048
Two men whose hearts are bleeding
for a brother doctor in distress.

413
00:31:16,024 --> 00:31:19,152
But it's too much to ask,
too noble a gesture to hope for.

414
00:31:19,227 --> 00:31:21,752
No, my good man, not at all.

415
00:31:21,896 --> 00:31:23,488
But who would buy the boat?

416
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:27,057
We would not dare,
and you, a slave, you could not.

417
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:28,157
True.

418
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:32,837
That would be my part. To find someone.
A man as eager to escape as I.

419
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:36,844
-A man held here for debt, say.
-Then it's a bargain?

420
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:41,780
Gentlemen,
you've opened for me the gates of hope.

421
00:31:43,885 --> 00:31:44,874
Doctor.

422
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:52,288
-My dear colleague.
-Gentlemen.

423
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:58,659
Now we have him.

424
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:01,759
We've only to get him involved
and reveal his plan.

425
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:05,101
He'll steal very little of our business
when he's in irons.

426
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:07,973
Gentlemen.

427
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:13,241
There's one thing slipped
my mind entirely.

428
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:18,108
Simple-minded men might think this
an opportunity for trickery...

429
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:22,289
but brilliant men like yourselves
will remember in what favor I stand...

430
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,326
with the Governor
in contrast to some others...

431
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:28,692
and how little their words
would weigh against mine.

432
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:31,857
Heigh-ho for the Governor's foot!

433
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,594
Good day, gentlemen.

434
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:08,460
-Are you all with me?
-Yes.

435
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:09,594
Listen.

436
00:33:09,671 --> 00:33:12,868
There's a man named Nuttall
who's in trouble with the Governor.

437
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,534
He's looking for a small boat
which he'll purchase...

438
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,077
on the night chosen for our escape.

439
00:33:17,145 --> 00:33:18,703
-Escape?
-Quiet!

440
00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:24,581
While he gathers stores and equipment,
we must be ready on the inside.

441
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:28,552
We might steal some sugarcane knives
and hack through the stockade walls.

442
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:30,090
Or dig our way under.

443
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:34,151
Once at sea, if we get there,
our troubles will have just begun.

444
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:36,287
lf any of you want to withdraw,
now's the time.

445
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:37,797
-No.
-Not me.

446
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:41,768
You'll be a lubber crew, but I'll match
your hearts against any other.

447
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:44,999
We can thank our stars for Jeremy Pitt.
He was a ship's pilot.

448
00:33:45,073 --> 00:33:49,009
Here's one you won't have to teach.
Six years in King James' Navy.

449
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:53,240
-What?
-That's nothing. I was a blooming gunner.

450
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:55,838
-A gunner?
-ln the King's Navy, too.

451
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,976
I was always ashamed of it up to now.

452
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,946
We'll have a crew yet!

453
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:02,990
Any of you others
been keeping such secrets?

454
00:34:04,058 --> 00:34:05,616
Where's Baynes?

455
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:09,694
-Where is he?
-He tried to escape today.

456
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:12,025
No! Caught?

457
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:15,502
-Branded?
-Yeah.

458
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,406
No!

459
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,714
Why did you do it, Andy?

460
00:34:36,924 --> 00:34:39,324
I told you I'd try to get you out.

461
00:34:39,393 --> 00:34:42,658
I couldn't stand it any longer.
I couldn't stand it.

462
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,461
I was going mad.
What do you think a man is made of?

463
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:48,695
How much do you think he can stand?

464
00:34:55,877 --> 00:35:00,246
''Watchman, what of the night?''
lsaiah 21 :1 1 .

465
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:23,701
Don't make the purchase
until well on in the evening.

466
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:25,329
That way there'll be less risk...

467
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:27,533
of anyone wondering where you came by
the money.

468
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:31,066
Lumme, Captain.
lt ain't too late for us to change our minds.

469
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:33,636
Stow the provisions away on board
as soon as it's dark.

470
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,512
Then all you've got to do is sit down here
and wait for us.

471
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:39,178
ls that all?
Wait all alone in the blooming dark...

472
00:35:39,253 --> 00:35:41,813
waiting for someone to come along
and nab me.

473
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:45,388
Nuttall, my lad,
there's just one other little thing.

474
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:50,021
Could you find me a good piece of timber
about so thick and so long?

475
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,323
Yes, I think so.

476
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,095
Then do so and lash it to your spine.
lt needs stiffening.

477
00:35:54,168 --> 00:35:56,102
Courage. I'll join you at midnight.

478
00:36:09,817 --> 00:36:11,910
How long does it take to feed
this pack of dogs?

479
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:15,387
lt's a wonder we make a profit at all.
You don't drive them hard enough.

480
00:36:15,456 --> 00:36:17,287
Get them out of here!

481
00:36:29,503 --> 00:36:32,961
I've just been with Nuttall at the boat.
lt's tonight.

482
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:36,234
-At last!
-For heaven's sake, command yourself.

483
00:36:37,378 --> 00:36:40,040
-Tonight, Hagthorpe.
-Caution above everything.

484
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,605
He who goes slowly, goes safely.

485
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:47,852
Remember, Jeremy,
you're the only navigator among us.

486
00:36:47,922 --> 00:36:50,220
Without you, there's no escape.

487
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:56,119
Hello, Uncle!

488
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:59,928
Riding again? What do you plan to see
riding always the same road?

489
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:03,869
You'd be surprised what interesting things
there are to see on this island...

490
00:37:03,938 --> 00:37:05,496
if you only keep your eyes open.

491
00:37:05,573 --> 00:37:09,805
Today, for instance, I saw something
that you'd give 1,000 ducats to know.

492
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:15,278
Stores and equipment
are all stowed away onboard.

493
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,847
We could use more food,
but there's no money left.

494
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:23,516
I'm not taking any chances
by asking our medical friends for more.

495
00:37:23,925 --> 00:37:26,359
I told Nuttall we'd get to the boat
by midnight.

496
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:30,353
Jeremy, we must not fail tonight.

497
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:33,594
What the devil have you been up to?

498
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,831
Tonight will be a fine night,
judging by the sky.

499
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:41,305
There you are, Pitt. Keep it covered up
and it should heal in a day or so.

500
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:46,372
Miss Bishop. You looking for me, sir?

501
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:48,745
Yes. You, stop!

502
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:53,348
What's the matter? Why are you shaking?

503
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:56,112
Nothing. l....

504
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,859
What's going on between you two?

505
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:05,323
Why, nothing. The man has a bad leg.

506
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:11,528
I'll tend to you later.
Where have you been?

507
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,299
I've been at my work,
attending to the Governor.

508
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,637
You lie.

509
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:17,001
Do I?

510
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:18,909
The Governor's had another attack of gout.

511
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,541
He's been screaming for you
like a wounded horse all the afternoon.

512
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,641
Then it appears
I was not with the Governor.

513
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,550
Then where have you been?

514
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:29,783
-Why, I've been at....
-He was with me, Uncle.

515
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:30,846
What?

516
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:34,793
Thank you for protecting my reputation,
Dr. Blood, but it was a useless gallantry.

517
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:37,592
My uncle knows that I spend my time
with whomever I please.

518
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:40,566
You might choose your company
with better taste.

519
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:43,762
His Excellency's waiting for you!
Here, Kent, lend him your horse.

520
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:44,964
Yes, sir.

521
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:48,236
Otherwise, the lout will be all night
getting there.

522
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:50,106
Will I be required there long, sir?

523
00:38:50,177 --> 00:38:53,203
You're afraid your work will interfere
with your social affairs?

524
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,148
lf I get back late, before midnight,
could I get back into the stockade?

525
00:38:57,218 --> 00:39:00,312
Will you stay here talking all night?
Be off with you!

526
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,918
Take him to the stockade!

527
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:11,160
Go on, get along in there.

528
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:20,668
lf he talks, we're lost.

529
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,447
Well?

530
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:38,821
lt seems that you're continually
doing me favors.

531
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:41,020
-I don't know why.
-Neither do I.

532
00:39:41,095 --> 00:39:42,221
Yes, I do.

533
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:45,697
lt's because you're so very grateful
and always thank me so prettily.

534
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,026
Sure now, you don't blame me
for resenting you and your favors.

535
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:52,971
This is interesting. I've had men tell me
they had reasons for admiring me...

536
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,736
and some have even laid claims
to reasons for loving me...

537
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:00,213
but for a man to store up reasons
for resenting me, how refreshing.

538
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:02,306
You must tell me a few of them.

539
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:04,874
The first is reason enough.
You bought me.

540
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:10,289
I've had no lack of experiences in my time,
but to be bought and sold was a new one.

541
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:12,450
I was in no mood to thank my purchaser.

542
00:40:12,526 --> 00:40:15,188
That I can understand. Go on.

543
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:17,688
I've resented you because your name
is Bishop.

544
00:40:17,765 --> 00:40:20,290
My thoughts have lumped you
with your uncle.

545
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:23,461
How was I to know
that a devil could have....

546
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:26,835
That a devil could have an angel
for a niece?

547
00:40:27,775 --> 00:40:30,835
From a resentful man,
that is a pretty fair compliment.

548
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:34,942
Have you any more reasons
for resenting me like that one?

549
00:40:35,149 --> 00:40:37,344
lndeed, I have. And the strongest of all...

550
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:42,216
I've resented you
because you're beautiful, and I'm a slave.

551
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,217
Do you understand that?

552
00:40:47,394 --> 00:40:48,861
I don't know.

553
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,958
Perhaps if you were to explain further, I....

554
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:55,401
I've already talked too much.

555
00:40:57,771 --> 00:40:59,432
I'll open your mouth!

556
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:10,174
You'll stay here
without food or water until you talk.

557
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:17,818
-Why did you lie to your uncle?
-Because....

558
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,854
Dr. Blood,
you're a physician and should know.

559
00:41:22,129 --> 00:41:25,997
ls it not considered unhealthy
for a slave to be seen at a boat?

560
00:41:26,934 --> 00:41:30,028
-Why should it be?
-Boats put out to sea.

561
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,829
Slaves may not.

562
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,668
You're jumping to conclusions, aren't you?

563
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,903
Am I?

564
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:39,903
The Governor will be waiting for you.

565
00:41:40,948 --> 00:41:41,972
Yes.

566
00:41:43,284 --> 00:41:46,685
Miss Bishop,
it's difficult for an Irishman to apologize.

567
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:50,015
But I hope you can forgive me
for having thought badly of you.

568
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,581
I will, if you tell me
how you think of me now.

569
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,027
How I think of you now? I think of you....

570
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:01,399
I think of you as the woman who owns me.
Her slave.

571
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:05,797
But I think the man is lucky
who can count you his friend.

572
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:07,773
I think you know you can.

573
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:19,414
Your slave is grateful
for all marks of favor.

574
00:42:19,486 --> 00:42:21,647
When you forget your slavery
and go so far--

575
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:23,189
Now there, you're mistaken.

576
00:42:23,257 --> 00:42:25,953
However far this slave may go,
he won't forget.

577
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:30,925
lt's a characteristic we Irish
have in common with the elephants.

578
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:27,647
Hello. Where are you going?

579
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:31,349
You're so much improved,
I was returning to the stockade.

580
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:34,485
Don't leave me tonight. I'm a sick man.

581
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:37,657
I assure you, sir,
there's nothing more I can do.

582
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:39,426
There must be something.

583
00:43:39,933 --> 00:43:42,128
Perhaps you ought to bleed me again.

584
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:46,797
Very well, then, if you wish it.

585
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,175
But mind, no more softness about this.

586
00:43:52,446 --> 00:43:56,143
I'm gonna have you well by midnight
if I have to bleed you to death.

587
00:44:11,165 --> 00:44:13,099
-Who goes there?
-Peter Blood.

588
00:44:25,713 --> 00:44:28,477
-Jeremy, what's happened?
-Water.

589
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,585
Easy, lad.

590
00:44:40,894 --> 00:44:43,021
I didn't tell him. I didn't.

591
00:44:43,664 --> 00:44:47,498
-Tell him what, Jeremy?
-About our plans.

592
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,994
My back.

593
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:56,403
Help me.

594
00:44:58,712 --> 00:45:00,873
-Who did this?
-Bishop.

595
00:45:01,749 --> 00:45:04,217
Bishop. Swine!

596
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,616
I didn't tell him. I didn't.

597
00:45:16,897 --> 00:45:20,731
-ls our boat still standing in at the bay?
-Yes, Jeremy.

598
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:23,968
I wondered if I was still out of my mind.

599
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:29,139
I've been seeing boats sailing in and out...

600
00:45:29,877 --> 00:45:34,109
in and out, but ours will never sail.

601
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:36,377
Not now.

602
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:40,178
Or if it does, you'll sail without me.

603
00:45:41,288 --> 00:45:45,122
What?
And get lost at sea without our navigator?

604
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:48,992
-Nonsense, lad.
-We are not going this time.

605
00:45:49,763 --> 00:45:51,594
lt's hopeless for all of us.

606
00:45:53,934 --> 00:45:55,595
We'll manage somehow.

607
00:46:04,311 --> 00:46:06,677
-What are you doing here?
-Doing?

608
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,205
Why, the duties of my office.

609
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:11,877
I said he was to have
no food nor drink till I ordered.

610
00:46:11,952 --> 00:46:14,182
Sure now, I never heard you.

611
00:46:14,254 --> 00:46:15,846
How could you? You weren't here.

612
00:46:15,923 --> 00:46:18,790
Then how do you expect me
to know what orders you've given?

613
00:46:21,395 --> 00:46:24,887
ln the name of humanity!
lf you know the word.

614
00:46:25,165 --> 00:46:28,134
-You dare take that tone with me?
-Yes, I do!

615
00:46:29,803 --> 00:46:31,737
I've been too soft with you...

616
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:34,068
but that shall be mended.

617
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,773
Kent, tie him up!

618
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,511
Had it easy here up to now. Get up there.

619
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,559
Now I'll take this rod to you...

620
00:46:56,663 --> 00:46:59,723
until there's not an inch of hide left
on your dirty carcass.

621
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:01,229
Another beating?

622
00:47:01,301 --> 00:47:04,566
This will be a good half-dozen of them
you've given me in promise.

623
00:47:04,638 --> 00:47:06,936
This will be as real as it is overdue.

624
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:10,773
And what becomes of His Excellency
the Governor's gouty foot?

625
00:47:10,844 --> 00:47:14,905
You'll not save yourself with that device
this time. Nothing will save you.

626
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:22,220
Pirates! Spanish pirates!

627
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,418
This is what I call a timely interruption.

628
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:33,032
Though what will come of it,
the devil himself only knows.

629
00:50:01,615 --> 00:50:04,584
We've got to get through the town
to get to the boat.

630
00:50:04,851 --> 00:50:06,341
Wait here, lads.

631
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,332
lt's me. Mr. Nuttall.

632
00:50:58,405 --> 00:51:00,373
You came close to being
the ex-Mr. Nuttall.

633
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,908
Wouldn't be the first death I died today.

634
00:51:03,677 --> 00:51:06,271
We can't stay here waiting for them
to catch sight of us.

635
00:51:06,346 --> 00:51:07,904
Let's get to the boat down this way.

636
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:34,866
Sunk to the bottom of the briny.

637
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,843
And it sunk our hopes with it.

638
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:41,972
-Perhaps not.
-What do you mean, Peter?

639
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:47,580
-He's gonna take a bath?
-Yes, but not for cleanliness.

640
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:51,152
Since the Spaniards have been
thoughtless enough to sink our craft...

641
00:51:51,224 --> 00:51:54,387
I'll see if I can't persuade them
to lend us one of theirs.

642
00:53:56,883 --> 00:54:01,343
Your Excellency,
facts are so often dull and deplorable.

643
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:04,088
Nevertheless, at the risk of boring you...

644
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:08,253
it is my painful duty to inform you
that 250 of my men...

645
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,729
are now complete masters
of the town of Port Royal.

646
00:54:12,098 --> 00:54:14,999
Your most worthy islanders
have been disarmed...

647
00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:18,169
and your city is now
absolutely in the hands...

648
00:54:18,238 --> 00:54:21,935
of the forces of His Majesty
King Philip of Spain.

649
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:25,411
Now that you have our city,
what do you want with it?

650
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:28,638
For a price,
I could forebear reducing it to ashes.

651
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:33,543
-What price?
-200,000 pieces of eight.

652
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,345
200,000 pieces of eight?

653
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,439
That's why we waited till this morning
to put to sea.

654
00:55:37,517 --> 00:55:41,180
We've a message for those Spaniards.
They are on their way now to receive it.

655
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,882
-Hagthorpe, man the guns!
-Clear deck!

656
00:55:51,197 --> 00:55:54,462
-All ready, Hagthorpe?
-Aye, Peter, ready.

657
00:55:54,534 --> 00:55:57,094
Give them a taste of their own iron!

658
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,805
You've done it, Hagthorpe!

659
00:56:43,383 --> 00:56:44,782
Hurrah!

660
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,884
Didn't I tell you I was a gunner, sir?

661
00:56:50,957 --> 00:56:53,755
You did that,
you son of a Yorkshire steer...

662
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,728
and bless your rusty heart,
it's a gunner you are!

663
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,858
lt's the Governor.

664
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,139
lt must be that some brave party
of citizens captured the ship.

665
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:08,731
I think you're right.

666
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,445
Someone should go aboard
and congratulate them.

667
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,715
Yes. My foot.

668
00:57:22,956 --> 00:57:26,517
Since your gout so unhappily
prevents you, allow me to be the one.

669
00:57:26,593 --> 00:57:29,562
Go ahead. You've always wanted
to be governor anyway.

670
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:31,189
Don't be nervous.

671
00:57:31,264 --> 00:57:33,061
-Man those sweeps.
-Aye, sir.

672
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:41,571
-Shall we hoist anchor, Peter?
-Aye. Get under way.

673
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:45,402
There's another boat approaching.

674
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,115
lt looks like Col. Bishop.

675
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,245
-Who?
-Bishop.

676
00:57:56,322 --> 00:57:58,654
The fool would come blundering
in just now.

677
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:02,491
-I'll make short work of him.
-No, Hagthorpe, none of that.

678
00:58:25,518 --> 00:58:28,510
But.... Who....

679
00:58:42,569 --> 00:58:45,697
Welcome aboard the <i>Cinco Lagos,</i>
Colonel darling.

680
00:58:46,306 --> 00:58:47,796
You? Was it....

681
00:58:48,408 --> 00:58:53,038
Peter Blood, was it you, then, who took
this ship and turned defeat into victory?

682
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:57,208
Myself it was. Myself and these,
my friends. And your friends.

683
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:01,645
And you saved my money, too!

684
00:59:07,994 --> 00:59:11,225
-Yes, it was heroic.
-Heroic, is it?

685
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,265
lt was epic.

686
00:59:13,666 --> 00:59:14,792
You amaze me.

687
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:17,927
On my soul, you deserve well.
You all deserve well.

688
00:59:18,104 --> 00:59:21,096
-You shall find me grateful.
-How grateful?

689
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:25,509
I shall ask His Excellency to write home
to the King an account of your exploit.

690
00:59:25,578 --> 00:59:27,910
Perhaps some of your sentencing
shall be remitted.

691
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,176
That's just about
what we expected from you.

692
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:33,378
Now, Wolf, Col. Bishop has a kind heart.

693
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,713
-But what kind, I'd hate to say.
-What is this?

694
00:59:35,788 --> 00:59:39,690
Why, Colonel darling,
such unusual generosity from you...

695
00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:41,920
must be making you feel unwell.

696
00:59:42,061 --> 00:59:45,462
-As your physician, I'd prescribe--
-A bit of neck-stretching.

697
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,996
Lads, we shouldn't hang this man.

698
00:59:54,073 --> 00:59:55,870
-No?
-No.

699
01:00:05,918 --> 01:00:07,283
Tie him over the end of a gun!

700
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,821
I'll scatter his innards
all over the sugarcane field.

701
01:00:09,889 --> 01:00:12,119
You're wasting words, I say. Hang him !

702
01:00:18,731 --> 01:00:23,134
Wait, lads. Hanging's too dignified for him.

703
01:00:23,336 --> 01:00:24,894
Can you swim, Colonel darling?

704
01:00:24,971 --> 01:00:28,668
We're giving you the chance to cool off
some of that excessive heat of yours.

705
01:00:28,741 --> 01:00:30,868
Over the side with him, men!

706
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,579
One, two...

707
01:00:43,189 --> 01:00:44,679
three!

708
01:00:51,631 --> 01:00:54,031
Peter Blood, I'll make you pay for this...

709
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,728
if I spend the rest of my life doing it!

710
01:00:57,070 --> 01:01:01,131
And then the whale came,
and the whale swallowed Jonah. I hope.

711
01:01:02,275 --> 01:01:04,641
Goodbye, Jonah. Don't forget to write.

712
01:01:09,215 --> 01:01:11,115
What's the next move, Peter?

713
01:01:11,284 --> 01:01:14,651
Up anchor! Wolf, man the capstan bar.

714
01:01:14,854 --> 01:01:20,224
Hagthorpe, get the sails aloft.
Thomas, get those men over here.

715
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:29,564
Round you go, men!
That's no water wheel you're working.

716
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:40,069
-Can you handle it, Jeremy?
-Aye, aye, Peter.

717
01:01:40,146 --> 01:01:42,011
We sail. Hard to starboard.

718
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:48,514
Up that rigging, you monkeys, aloft!
There's no chains to hold you now!

719
01:01:51,424 --> 01:01:52,823
Break out those sails...

720
01:01:52,892 --> 01:01:56,419
and watch them fill with the wind
that's carrying us all to freedom.

721
01:02:52,618 --> 01:02:54,210
We, the undersigned...

722
01:02:56,956 --> 01:02:58,787
are men without a country...

723
01:03:00,293 --> 01:03:03,592
outlaws in our own land,
and homeless outcasts in any other.

724
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,328
Desperate men,
we go to seek a desperate fortune.

725
01:03:12,405 --> 01:03:15,067
Therefore, we do here and now
band ourselves...

726
01:03:15,141 --> 01:03:17,006
into a brotherhood of buccaneers...

727
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:20,208
to practice the trade of piracy
on the high seas.

728
01:03:20,513 --> 01:03:23,243
We, the hunted, will now hunt!

729
01:03:25,418 --> 01:03:28,512
To that end, we enter into
the following articles of agreement.

730
01:03:28,588 --> 01:03:29,680
First...

731
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,319
we pledge ourselves
to be bound together as brothers...

732
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,988
in a life-and-death friendship...

733
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:41,124
sharing alike in fortune and in trouble.

734
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,997
Second article.

735
01:03:46,503 --> 01:03:49,904
All moneys and valuables
which may come into our possession...

736
01:03:50,473 --> 01:03:53,101
shall be lumped together
into a common fund...

737
01:03:53,576 --> 01:03:56,010
and from this fund
shall first be taken the money...

738
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,274
to fit, rig, and provision the ship.

739
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:03,713
After that, the recompense each
will receive who is wounded as follows:

740
01:04:05,055 --> 01:04:08,855
For the loss of a right arm,
600 pieces of eight.

741
01:04:09,893 --> 01:04:12,259
Left arm, 500.

742
01:04:13,063 --> 01:04:15,827
For the loss of a right leg, 500.

743
01:04:16,232 --> 01:04:18,564
Left leg, 400.

744
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:21,227
A fellow can get rich if he's lucky.

745
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:22,599
Greedy.

746
01:04:24,441 --> 01:04:26,568
lf a man conceal any treasure captured...

747
01:04:26,643 --> 01:04:30,079
or fail to place it in the general fund,
he shall be marooned.

748
01:04:30,714 --> 01:04:32,375
Set ashore on a deserted isle...

749
01:04:32,449 --> 01:04:35,247
and there left with a bottle of water,
a loaf of bread...

750
01:04:35,518 --> 01:04:37,315
and a pistol with one load.

751
01:04:38,455 --> 01:04:41,754
lf a man shall be drunk on duty,
he shall receive the same fate.

752
01:04:43,193 --> 01:04:46,458
And if a man shall molest
a woman captive against her will...

753
01:04:46,896 --> 01:04:49,592
he, too,
shall receive the same punishment.

754
01:04:51,334 --> 01:04:55,964
These articles entered into,
this 20th day of June, in the year 1687.

755
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:02,043
Now, men, you've heard the agreement.

756
01:05:02,445 --> 01:05:05,505
lt's the world against us
and us against the world.

757
01:05:05,982 --> 01:05:10,385
''His hand will be against every man,
and every man's hand against him.''

758
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,018
Genesis 16:12.

759
01:05:14,057 --> 01:05:18,687
Those of you in favor of these articles,
raise your right hands and say aye!

760
01:05:19,162 --> 01:05:20,459
Aye!

761
01:06:26,529 --> 01:06:28,292
Blood!

762
01:06:28,965 --> 01:06:32,196
This impertinent,
ungoverned rascal must be eradicated.

763
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:33,832
Yes, Your Majesty.

764
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:36,804
Sinking Spanish ships
causes me enough embarrassment...

765
01:06:36,873 --> 01:06:39,933
-but he sinks English ships as well.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

766
01:06:40,009 --> 01:06:41,806
Cannot Gov. Steed do something about it?

767
01:06:41,878 --> 01:06:44,574
He does his best,
but conditions on the island--

768
01:06:44,647 --> 01:06:48,583
Silence, Willoughby! I'm not interested
in anything you have to say.

769
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:51,512
I know your feelings towards me.

770
01:06:53,256 --> 01:06:56,919
Sunderland, what are you Secretary
of State for? Have you no solution?

771
01:06:56,993 --> 01:07:00,588
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Get your head off that hinge. Speak up.

772
01:07:00,663 --> 01:07:04,497
Since Gov. Steed is incapable,
you should appoint a stronger man.

773
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:05,693
Who?

774
01:07:05,768 --> 01:07:08,828
Col. Bishop assures me
that if he were in power...

775
01:07:08,972 --> 01:07:10,769
he would not rest day or night...

776
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:14,742
until this Capt. Blood
was swinging on execution dock.

777
01:07:15,178 --> 01:07:17,169
Angling for the office, is he?

778
01:07:17,313 --> 01:07:20,578
What difference
if he's the iron man we need?

779
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:24,214
Draw up the appointment.

780
01:07:24,854 --> 01:07:28,017
I've already taken the liberty of doing so,
Your Majesty.

781
01:07:48,444 --> 01:07:51,470
Mrs. Steed, Mr. Steed,
I wish you both a pleasant journey.

782
01:07:51,548 --> 01:07:55,575
I thank you, Governor.
Again, congratulations, Gov. Bishop.

783
01:07:55,952 --> 01:07:59,683
-May your term of office be successful.
-Thank you, my friend.

784
01:07:59,889 --> 01:08:02,187
Arabella dear,
have a nice holiday in England.

785
01:08:02,258 --> 01:08:03,589
I'm sure I shall.

786
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:04,649
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

787
01:08:04,727 --> 01:08:07,195
-Keep a weather eye open for pirates.
-Very well, sir.

788
01:08:07,263 --> 01:08:10,755
Before you return, Arabella,
I shall have the sea swept clean of them.

789
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:13,825
Particularly one.
I think you know whom I mean.

790
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:20,772
I hope he gets the gout
the infernal office gave me.

791
01:08:21,177 --> 01:08:24,442
Come along. Goodbye.

792
01:08:33,356 --> 01:08:36,325
Thomas Fulton. One share, no injuries.

793
01:08:37,694 --> 01:08:42,063
James Graham. One share,
plus 100 pieces of eight for a pike wound.

794
01:08:43,066 --> 01:08:47,162
Zachary Stevens.
For bravery at the battle of Maracaibo...

795
01:08:47,237 --> 01:08:49,432
one share, plus £10 of silver.

796
01:08:51,841 --> 01:08:56,744
Oliver Clark. One share, plus 400 pieces
of eight for the loss of his left leg.

797
01:08:56,813 --> 01:08:58,747
There you are, Oliver, I'm proud of you.

798
01:08:58,982 --> 01:09:03,681
Lord Chester Dyke.
No injury, one share and £5 of silver.

799
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,747
Anton Brazilimo.

800
01:09:07,991 --> 01:09:09,219
Andrew Fell.

801
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:13,888
One share, plus 500 pieces of eight
for the loss of his left arm.

802
01:09:14,364 --> 01:09:16,559
There you are, Andrew, and good luck.

803
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:19,900
David Sampson. One share, no injuries.

804
01:09:22,872 --> 01:09:27,036
Honesty Nuttall. No injuries, one share.

805
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:29,976
Hold on, Captain.

806
01:09:30,046 --> 01:09:33,573
How about me little toe,
heroically sacrificed in battle?

807
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:37,586
Honesty Nuttall. One share, and nothing
for the toe he just shot off himself.

808
01:09:41,057 --> 01:09:42,547
You stupid numskull.

809
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:46,618
You should have shot out your brains
and left your toe for thinking with.

810
01:09:56,739 --> 01:09:58,468
Ahoy, the deck!

811
01:09:58,775 --> 01:10:01,437
An English ship on the port bow!

812
01:10:13,222 --> 01:10:14,519
So it is.

813
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:18,151
A fine big ship, too,
as far as I can judge from this distance.

814
01:10:18,828 --> 01:10:20,762
Shall we sail over
and give them a surprise?

815
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:21,854
No, Peter.

816
01:10:21,931 --> 01:10:23,796
The men are set on putting in at Tortuga.

817
01:10:23,866 --> 01:10:25,834
Their gold's burning holes in their pockets.

818
01:10:25,902 --> 01:10:28,268
What's one ship more or less to us now?

819
01:10:28,471 --> 01:10:30,871
lt appears I have a mutiny on my hands.

820
01:10:45,788 --> 01:10:49,656
What ho, the deck! A ship to starboard!

821
01:10:53,029 --> 01:10:54,792
lt may be a pirate!

822
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:10,968
Very well, then.
Sail on, little ship, back to England...

823
01:11:12,215 --> 01:11:13,944
where we may never go.

824
01:11:15,284 --> 01:11:18,515
You'll never know
how close you came to not getting there.

825
01:12:30,460 --> 01:12:32,428
Your turn, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

826
01:12:32,495 --> 01:12:33,484
Up!

827
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:37,791
<i>It's your turn now.</i>

828
01:12:42,405 --> 01:12:43,997
<i>Again, my captain.</i>

829
01:12:45,575 --> 01:12:47,042
<i>-Are you ready?</i>
-Right.

830
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,600
<i>It's good.</i>

831
01:12:49,846 --> 01:12:51,575
This time, my friend, huh?

832
01:12:54,517 --> 01:12:56,382
<i>-You missed.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

833
01:12:56,786 --> 01:12:59,653
I am defeated.
You win the prize, Capt. Blood.

834
01:13:00,022 --> 01:13:02,354
<i>-Goodbye, my dear.</i>
<i>-Goodbye.</i>

835
01:13:03,793 --> 01:13:05,488
<i>What a charming captain.</i>

836
01:13:06,162 --> 01:13:08,096
Some other time, perhaps.

837
01:13:08,164 --> 01:13:09,631
<i>Why?</i>

838
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:11,826
What sort of a man are you?

839
01:13:12,301 --> 01:13:15,896
I'm the sort of man you like, my dear.
A man with money.

840
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:18,837
<i>The money!</i>

841
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:34,047
<i>Mon capitaine,</i>
what a pair we would make.

842
01:13:34,123 --> 01:13:37,820
ln all the Caribbean,
there is no buccaneer so strong as me.

843
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,052
Except you.

844
01:13:39,161 --> 01:13:41,288
You almost flatter me, Levasseur.

845
01:13:41,364 --> 01:13:45,164
Why do you hold off your consent so long?
We become partners.

846
01:13:45,234 --> 01:13:47,794
You've been in Tortuga
these three, four months.

847
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:50,564
You must be even so much
in need of gold as I.

848
01:13:51,474 --> 01:13:53,908
Such a partnership requires sober thought.

849
01:13:53,976 --> 01:13:57,241
My poor head has been dancing with rum
this whole week past.

850
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,540
Even so drunk, your brain is the greatest
this side the Caribbean.

851
01:14:00,616 --> 01:14:04,052
With your brain and my strength,
there is nothing we cannot do.

852
01:14:05,021 --> 01:14:07,649
There's very little I can't do all by myself.

853
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,725
<i>Long Iive Capt. Levasseur!</i>

854
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:23,336
And here's to Capt. Blood!

855
01:14:23,406 --> 01:14:24,395
Hurrah!

856
01:14:32,048 --> 01:14:35,279
<i>Then, it's a good dinner guest, my friend.</i>

857
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:37,917
-You're next, Peter.
<i>-Mon capitaine.</i>

858
01:14:39,388 --> 01:14:42,551
lt's clearly understood, then,
that we sail under my articles.

859
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:45,321
Those very severe articles of yours?

860
01:14:45,394 --> 01:14:48,192
<i>Mais oui,</i> I sail under the articles
of a girls' <i>séminaire...</i>

861
01:14:48,264 --> 01:14:51,358
to have you as my partner, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

862
01:14:57,006 --> 01:14:59,634
Women will be the death of you yet,
Levasseur.

863
01:15:00,509 --> 01:15:03,945
lt is a very pleasant way to die,
even if it is expensive.

864
01:15:05,648 --> 01:15:08,481
What is the first order,
<i>mon capitaine</i> partner?

865
01:15:08,684 --> 01:15:11,448
We sail on the tide.
Outside the harbor, we'll scatter.

866
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,616
Each ship will proceed singly to pick up
any stray ships we'll find on the journey.

867
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:17,716
We'll meet at the island of Virgen Magra.

868
01:15:17,793 --> 01:15:19,021
<i>Magnifique!</i>

869
01:15:19,095 --> 01:15:21,825
I give you the toast. To our great success!

870
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:25,128
Let me give one.
To the greatest captain on the Caribbean!

871
01:15:25,201 --> 01:15:28,534
<i>-Oui!</i> To <i>Capitaine Levasseur!</i>
-Capt. Blood.

872
01:15:29,005 --> 01:15:30,529
Bravo!

873
01:15:30,606 --> 01:15:33,837
The articles aside,
let's give a toast to Capt. Blood.

874
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:36,835
<i>Capitaine Levasseur.</i>

875
01:15:36,912 --> 01:15:39,176
To the greatest captain on the coast.

876
01:15:44,153 --> 01:15:46,621
The greatest captain on the coast, is it?

877
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:51,418
Methinks the greatest captain
on the coast...

878
01:15:51,827 --> 01:15:53,590
has just made the greatest mistake...

879
01:15:53,663 --> 01:15:56,325
the most ordinary common fool
could make.

880
01:16:11,814 --> 01:16:15,682
lt's been so lovely. I'd like to stay forever.
You've all been so kind.

881
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:18,344
Come again and visit us soon, dear.

882
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:21,846
England is so much more beautiful
when you're here.

883
01:16:22,024 --> 01:16:24,549
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

884
01:16:25,027 --> 01:16:28,190
-Thank you for everything.
-Goodbye, dear.

885
01:16:28,264 --> 01:16:30,391
-Goodbye, Amelia.
-Goodbye, Mary.

886
01:16:45,614 --> 01:16:49,846
However else the court may have changed,
the art of flattery still flourishes.

887
01:16:49,919 --> 01:16:51,546
Stab me if it's flattery.

888
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:55,647
When the King ordered me on this journey
as a special emissary to the West Indies...

889
01:16:55,725 --> 01:16:58,922
I looked forward with some trepidation
to a life among the savages.

890
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:01,394
But when I found
you were one of those savages...

891
01:17:01,464 --> 01:17:05,400
returning to your native heath,
my grateful eyes could hardly believe it.

892
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:10,896
You pictured us running around
in animal skins, eating raw meat?

893
01:17:10,973 --> 01:17:13,669
Why not, in a country filled
with Indians and pirates?

894
01:17:13,743 --> 01:17:18,544
Speaking of pirates, did you ever happen
to hear of a wild rogue named Blood?

895
01:17:18,748 --> 01:17:20,181
-Peter Blood?
-Yes.

896
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:23,578
No. I don't know him.

897
01:17:24,153 --> 01:17:26,644
I hardly number pirates
among my acquaintances.

898
01:17:26,722 --> 01:17:29,589
Of course not. Stupid of me.
I merely mention him in passing.

899
01:17:29,658 --> 01:17:31,990
Because he's one of the objects
of my mission.

900
01:17:32,061 --> 01:17:33,085
-Your mission?
-Yes.

901
01:17:33,162 --> 01:17:36,325
I've been sent to try to blot out
all this piracy, my dear.

902
01:17:36,398 --> 01:17:40,095
And in a manner
I must keep secret till I find Capt. Blood.

903
01:17:43,405 --> 01:17:45,896
Ship on the port side, sir!

904
01:17:49,411 --> 01:17:51,845
Yes, that's a fine ship.

905
01:17:55,317 --> 01:17:59,048
-Captain, what ship is that?
-I don't know, Lord Willoughby.

906
01:17:59,455 --> 01:18:03,152
She flies the French flag.
She could be anything in these waters.

907
01:18:03,893 --> 01:18:07,124
-We're in pirate waters now, aren't we?
-Yes, we are.

908
01:18:07,463 --> 01:18:11,729
Yonder bank of low clouds
is the island of Virgen Magra.

909
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:14,066
-Exciting, isn't it?
-Very.

910
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:17,103
Could she be a pirate ship, by any chance?

911
01:18:17,173 --> 01:18:20,336
Any ship we meet in the Caribbean
could be a pirate ship.

912
01:18:26,649 --> 01:18:30,676
Ahoy, English ship off port side!

913
01:18:30,753 --> 01:18:33,153
Prepare to come onto starboard tack!

914
01:18:33,222 --> 01:18:34,917
Starboard tack it is!

915
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:36,184
Steady at the helm !

916
01:18:37,927 --> 01:18:39,224
Ready?

917
01:18:39,295 --> 01:18:40,785
Stand by your guns.

918
01:18:46,902 --> 01:18:48,563
<i>What Iuck.</i>

919
01:18:48,737 --> 01:18:52,673
Just as I'm about to give up and anchor
to wait for my partner, Capt. Blood...

920
01:18:52,741 --> 01:18:55,437
this fine English prize
walks into my parlor and says:

921
01:18:55,511 --> 01:18:57,775
<i>''HeIIo, Capt. Levasseur. ''</i>

922
01:18:57,847 --> 01:19:01,476
-We've got to give welcome, Cahusac.
<i>-Yes, and how.</i> Light it!

923
01:19:30,546 --> 01:19:33,879
The ransom for you two is fixed at
20,000 pieces of eight.

924
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:35,416
I shall provide a boat for you...

925
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:38,419
to go to Gov. Bishop at Jamaica
to collect it.

926
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:43,357
Meanwhile, <i>mademoiseIIe</i> remains
with me as hostage.

927
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:46,492
I find it very lonely on this island.

928
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:50,526
I refuse absolutely and utterly!

929
01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:54,035
You know this? It is the rosary of pain.

930
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:58,199
lt is possible to screw a man's eyes
out of his head.

931
01:19:59,074 --> 01:20:01,508
Very well. Do your worst.

932
01:20:02,077 --> 01:20:03,066
<i>AIors!</i>

933
01:20:04,213 --> 01:20:05,373
No, stop!

934
01:20:05,447 --> 01:20:08,245
Lord Willoughby, thank you,
but don't be foolish.

935
01:20:08,617 --> 01:20:10,312
<i>MademoiseIIe</i> is right.

936
01:20:10,419 --> 01:20:12,387
<i>Thank you, miss.</i>

937
01:20:12,621 --> 01:20:15,784
I beg you to spare yourself
and the young lady.

938
01:20:15,858 --> 01:20:17,826
You know,
I've been too modest with you...

939
01:20:17,893 --> 01:20:20,794
but since I have said
20,000 pieces of eight...

940
01:20:20,863 --> 01:20:24,094
<i>eh bien,</i> I have said 20,000 pieces of eight.

941
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:27,499
For what, if you please,
have you said 20,000 pieces of eight?

942
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,134
lf it ain't the niece
of our old friend Col. Bishop.

943
01:20:34,677 --> 01:20:36,838
You don't recognize her. Mind that.

944
01:20:38,681 --> 01:20:39,978
What does he mean?

945
01:20:40,049 --> 01:20:41,983
Your guess is as good as mine.

946
01:20:52,194 --> 01:20:55,129
-Good morning, Levasseur.
<i>-HeIIo, Captain.</i>

947
01:20:55,197 --> 01:20:56,721
-Cahusac.
<i>-Capitaine.</i>

948
01:20:57,132 --> 01:21:00,727
I arrived late last night and put into a cove
a few miles to the west.

949
01:21:00,803 --> 01:21:03,863
We've walked across
to give you good morning, but, faith...

950
01:21:03,939 --> 01:21:07,102
it seems we've interrupted
some business of yours.

951
01:21:07,176 --> 01:21:09,337
-Who are these people?
<i>-Oh, yes, here.</i>

952
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:12,312
As you see, two prisoners.
I captured an English ship.

953
01:21:12,381 --> 01:21:14,713
Yes. We saw her coming across the spit.

954
01:21:14,783 --> 01:21:18,310
I must congratulate you, Levasseur.
I didn't so much as sight a sail.

955
01:21:18,454 --> 01:21:20,888
The fortunes of war, my partner.

956
01:21:21,023 --> 01:21:23,321
And these are also the fortunes of war?

957
01:21:23,392 --> 01:21:26,486
Big fortunes. A nobleman and the niece
of the Governor of Jamaica.

958
01:21:26,562 --> 01:21:27,586
Really?

959
01:21:27,663 --> 01:21:29,858
I suppose congratulations
are again in order...

960
01:21:29,932 --> 01:21:32,765
but have you forgotten there's an article
in our agreement...

961
01:21:32,835 --> 01:21:34,700
forbidding the taking of women prisoners?

962
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:37,500
That's a foolish article of yours.

963
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:40,971
I was not aware you regarded it so
when we signed.

964
01:21:41,043 --> 01:21:44,570
Would you care to dispute
my opinion now, your men against mine?

965
01:21:47,049 --> 01:21:50,849
Not this morning, thank you.
As you say, a foolish article.

966
01:21:50,919 --> 01:21:52,352
<i>Heard, my friend.</i>

967
01:21:52,421 --> 01:21:55,948
That is why these are prisoners
of my own, a matter personal.

968
01:21:56,225 --> 01:21:58,489
-And the 20,000 pieces of eight?
-Their ransom.

969
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,324
-That is also a personal matter?
-lt is.

970
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:04,988
Obviously, these two prisoners,
and particularly the young lady...

971
01:22:05,067 --> 01:22:09,128
must be kept in someone's hands for,
shall we say, safekeeping...

972
01:22:09,204 --> 01:22:10,899
but why your hands?

973
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,831
Why shouldn't Pierre have her,
or Roch, or Jacob...

974
01:22:14,143 --> 01:22:16,668
since she's as much their property
as yours?

975
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:20,947
Or doesn't that please you?
You'd like to keep her for yourself.

976
01:22:22,918 --> 01:22:25,011
And who might that be, do you suppose?

977
01:22:25,087 --> 01:22:28,523
-That is your Capt. Blood.
-Capt. Blood?

978
01:22:29,725 --> 01:22:30,749
Now, my captain...

979
01:22:30,826 --> 01:22:34,023
since you covet our joint property
of war, you may have her...

980
01:22:34,096 --> 01:22:36,257
providing you're willing to buy her.

981
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:38,993
-Buy her?
-At the price you yourself have put on her.

982
01:22:39,068 --> 01:22:40,763
20,000 pieces of eight.

983
01:22:40,836 --> 01:22:43,270
The ransom is to be paid by Gov. Bishop.

984
01:22:43,338 --> 01:22:45,203
lt is for division when it comes.

985
01:22:45,274 --> 01:22:48,243
But if the Governor should refuse to pay
the ransom, what then?

986
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:51,768
No. If you're to keep the girl meanwhile,
pay the ransom.

987
01:22:52,047 --> 01:22:54,515
Let it be your risk to collect it
from the Governor.

988
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:56,244
Capt. Blood is right.

989
01:22:56,318 --> 01:22:59,947
-lt's in the articles.
-What's in the articles, you fools?

990
01:23:00,022 --> 01:23:03,253
Where do you suppose
I have 20,000 pieces of eight?

991
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:05,259
-Let someone buy her who has.
-Who?

992
01:23:05,327 --> 01:23:06,624
-l.
-You?

993
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:10,921
Jeremy, Wolf, bring the prisoners forward.

994
01:23:17,106 --> 01:23:18,630
Here they are, Peter.

995
01:23:20,175 --> 01:23:23,110
I bid 20,000 pieces of eight.

996
01:23:23,412 --> 01:23:25,573
Can you improve on that, Levasseur?

997
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:28,440
I don't wish to be bought by you.

998
01:23:32,855 --> 01:23:35,289
As a lady once said to a slave...

999
01:23:35,357 --> 01:23:38,758
you are hardly in a position
to have anything to say about it.

1000
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:45,225
-You want the girl?
-Why not?

1001
01:23:45,634 --> 01:23:48,000
And I'm willing to pay for what I want.

1002
01:23:49,037 --> 01:23:52,029
Cahusac, you boast a knowledge of pearls.

1003
01:23:54,076 --> 01:23:56,237
At what do you value each of those?

1004
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:02,576
1,000 pieces each.

1005
01:24:02,651 --> 01:24:06,451
They're worth rather more, but very well.
Here are 12.

1006
01:24:06,522 --> 01:24:10,515
The three-fifths the value of the prize
due your ship for having made the capture.

1007
01:24:10,592 --> 01:24:13,925
For the share due my men,
I make myself responsible.

1008
01:24:26,775 --> 01:24:30,370
Now, Wolf, will you be so kind
as to take my property aboard ship?

1009
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,410
And that settles that, my captain partner.

1010
01:24:36,084 --> 01:24:38,814
-No, you don't!
-Stop, <i>Capitaine!</i>

1011
01:24:40,322 --> 01:24:43,052
Wait! You'll not take her while I live!

1012
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:45,320
Then I'll take her when you're dead!

1013
01:24:47,095 --> 01:24:50,758
<i>-Capitaine,</i> it has been honorably settled.
-lt has not been settled for me!

1014
01:24:50,832 --> 01:24:54,063
What is a girl, more or less?
Do not be a fool, <i>Capitaine!</i>

1015
01:24:54,136 --> 01:24:55,603
<i>It's my business.</i>

1016
01:25:01,543 --> 01:25:05,343
Two breaches in our articles committed
by you. You should be marooned.

1017
01:25:06,215 --> 01:25:08,911
lt's what I intended for you in the end...

1018
01:25:08,984 --> 01:25:13,353
but since you prefer it this way,
you muckrake, I'll be humoring you.

1019
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:23,949
Up!

1020
01:27:23,552 --> 01:27:27,318
And that, my friend, ends a partnership
that should never have begun.

1021
01:27:54,616 --> 01:27:57,244
All these things I've gathered
in my journeys.

1022
01:27:59,154 --> 01:28:02,612
I've gone far since I was a slave
on your uncle's plantation...

1023
01:28:03,325 --> 01:28:05,793
thousands of restless, hectic miles.

1024
01:28:06,361 --> 01:28:09,228
But somehow tonight,
I've got a strange feeling...

1025
01:28:09,297 --> 01:28:11,288
that my journey's almost over.

1026
01:28:13,769 --> 01:28:15,361
You see these ankle rings?

1027
01:28:15,437 --> 01:28:18,133
They came from a ship
that was out from Persia.

1028
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,571
And these pearls...

1029
01:28:20,876 --> 01:28:23,936
they're the choice from a fleet
we captured off the Azores.

1030
01:28:24,045 --> 01:28:27,105
-Have you ever seen such pearls?
-Yes, I have.

1031
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:31,580
They're like the pearls you sometimes
use for making purchases, are they not?

1032
01:28:34,623 --> 01:28:37,615
-Yes, they are.
-How many lives did they cost?

1033
01:28:38,927 --> 01:28:41,521
As few as possible.
lt wasn't lives I was after.

1034
01:28:41,596 --> 01:28:43,962
-What, then?
-I never quite knew.

1035
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:48,359
Some urge that drove me on.
Revenge, I suppose.

1036
01:28:49,304 --> 01:28:51,363
But I've had my fill of revenge.

1037
01:28:52,441 --> 01:28:55,604
I often wondered
why I bothered to save all these things.

1038
01:28:56,011 --> 01:28:57,945
Tonight I know it's because...

1039
01:28:58,814 --> 01:29:01,248
one day you'd be here in this cabin
to wear them.

1040
01:29:01,316 --> 01:29:02,715
I'll never wear them, never!

1041
01:29:02,784 --> 01:29:05,753
Those nor any other plunder gotten
by a thief and pirate.

1042
01:29:06,855 --> 01:29:08,322
Thief and pirate.

1043
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:10,189
I've seen your pirate ways.

1044
01:29:10,258 --> 01:29:12,351
I've seen myself bargained for
and fought over.

1045
01:29:12,427 --> 01:29:14,156
A combat between jackals.

1046
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:16,995
But I thought you understood.

1047
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:18,760
You mean you thought you'd bought me.

1048
01:29:18,834 --> 01:29:21,394
I suppose I should have regarded that
as a compliment.

1049
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:24,769
You pirates are used to taking
without the formality of purchase.

1050
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:27,240
I advise you to go back to your ladies
at Tortuga...

1051
01:29:27,309 --> 01:29:29,436
who are thrilled by your bold,
lawless ways.

1052
01:29:29,511 --> 01:29:31,945
I only hate you and despise you.

1053
01:29:32,914 --> 01:29:36,213
I might have expected your thanks
for what I've done this day...

1054
01:29:36,284 --> 01:29:38,115
but very well, let it be so.

1055
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,513
I'm a thief and pirate and I'll show you
how a thief and a pirate can deal.

1056
01:29:42,657 --> 01:29:44,921
Once, you bought me for a miserable £10.

1057
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:48,391
Now I've bought you for considerably
more. The amount's of no matter.

1058
01:29:48,463 --> 01:29:50,897
What matters is
now I own you as you once owned me.

1059
01:29:50,966 --> 01:29:54,094
You're mine, do you understand?
Mine to do with as I please!

1060
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:03,968
Capt. Blood,
Lord Willoughby sends his compliments...

1061
01:30:04,045 --> 01:30:06,741
and requests you to talk with him
at your convenience.

1062
01:30:06,815 --> 01:30:08,339
He's been sent by the King himself.

1063
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:11,214
Tell him I'm not convenient
to any friend of the King's.

1064
01:30:11,286 --> 01:30:13,049
All I've got to say is good riddance...

1065
01:30:13,121 --> 01:30:15,214
as soon as I can get him to his destination.

1066
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:16,279
I shall.

1067
01:30:17,826 --> 01:30:20,420
Jeremy. Wolverstone.

1068
01:30:22,097 --> 01:30:25,225
-Wolverstone!
-What is it, Peter?

1069
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:27,190
We're changing course.

1070
01:30:27,269 --> 01:30:29,635
Draw down every rag of canvas
the yards will hold.

1071
01:30:29,704 --> 01:30:32,639
-Aye, aye, Peter, but....
-Jeremy!

1072
01:30:33,642 --> 01:30:35,735
All hands on deck!

1073
01:30:42,851 --> 01:30:45,012
-Jeremy!
-Coming, Peter!

1074
01:30:47,956 --> 01:30:49,719
Forever sleeping when I need you?

1075
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:52,783
-I wasn't sleeping. I was--
-Never mind! Get ready to go about.

1076
01:30:52,861 --> 01:30:55,159
-Set the course for Port Royal.
-Port Royal?

1077
01:30:57,198 --> 01:30:59,792
But the English fleet is at Port Royal.
Col. Bishop--

1078
01:30:59,868 --> 01:31:02,462
Sweet, merciful heaven! Haven't you ears?

1079
01:31:02,537 --> 01:31:04,471
Set the course for Port Royal!

1080
01:31:09,678 --> 01:31:12,670
-Make speed there, Wolverstone.
-Speed it is, Peter.

1081
01:31:13,815 --> 01:31:16,978
-Follow we a helm, west by north.
-West by north, sir.

1082
01:31:24,859 --> 01:31:27,987
Make speed there! To your halyards!

1083
01:31:28,463 --> 01:31:32,593
Tacks and braces. We head for Port Royal.

1084
01:31:39,307 --> 01:31:41,867
Make speed there! That's the order!

1085
01:31:42,477 --> 01:31:44,001
Make speed there.

1086
01:31:45,947 --> 01:31:48,780
There's a gallows waiting
for each of us at Port Royal...

1087
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:51,318
and no man should be late
to his own hanging.

1088
01:31:53,188 --> 01:31:54,985
How you hate the villain.

1089
01:31:55,056 --> 01:31:58,355
lf I were a young man,
I'm dashed if I wouldn't be jealous.

1090
01:31:59,728 --> 01:32:01,787
But you said you didn't even know him.

1091
01:32:01,896 --> 01:32:03,557
He was once my slave.

1092
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:06,289
Slave?

1093
01:32:07,736 --> 01:32:09,328
Did you know him well?

1094
01:32:10,071 --> 01:32:11,129
I did.

1095
01:32:12,874 --> 01:32:15,604
He's not such a bad fellow for a pirate.

1096
01:32:16,878 --> 01:32:19,779
When he made his escape,
I was thrilled and happy.

1097
01:32:20,215 --> 01:32:23,048
That was before I knew how he would use
his freedom.

1098
01:32:23,151 --> 01:32:24,379
But aren't you forgetting...

1099
01:32:24,452 --> 01:32:27,615
that a man's bitter heart
may demand revenge?

1100
01:32:28,223 --> 01:32:29,952
That is the unforgivable thing:

1101
01:32:30,191 --> 01:32:32,386
to have put his revenge above
everything else...

1102
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,894
and to have destroyed himself.
That's what he's done.

1103
01:32:34,963 --> 01:32:37,227
I've seen pirates. I know their ways.

1104
01:32:37,365 --> 01:32:40,664
Cruel, evil, greedy,
plundering peaceful cities...

1105
01:32:40,735 --> 01:32:43,431
torturing their captives. Beasts.

1106
01:33:00,889 --> 01:33:03,221
Are you so much in love with him?

1107
01:33:03,358 --> 01:33:04,518
ln love with him?

1108
01:33:04,726 --> 01:33:06,751
That you care so much what he does?

1109
01:33:06,828 --> 01:33:08,591
I don't care in the least what he does.

1110
01:33:08,663 --> 01:33:11,393
Someone should,
in view of what he's doing now.

1111
01:33:11,866 --> 01:33:15,131
But your uncle's with the fleet
at Port Royal. That much is fortunate.

1112
01:33:15,203 --> 01:33:18,036
Why? What's this about my uncle
in Port Royal?

1113
01:33:18,106 --> 01:33:21,405
He amazes me, this fellow.
That's where he means to take us.

1114
01:33:21,476 --> 01:33:24,001
-No, he can't.
-They won't let me near him.

1115
01:33:24,079 --> 01:33:28,311
He's alone on his quarterdeck
in a fine Irish temper, I suspect.

1116
01:33:29,184 --> 01:33:32,745
-But I learned of it from one of the crew.
-Lord Willoughby, he mustn't.

1117
01:33:33,455 --> 01:33:35,252
My uncle is a hard, unforgiving man.

1118
01:33:35,323 --> 01:33:38,884
He lives in the hope of one day
taking and hanging Capt. Blood.

1119
01:33:39,194 --> 01:33:41,526
Capt. Blood probably doesn't know that,
of course.

1120
01:33:41,596 --> 01:33:43,791
I doubt if it'd make any difference if he did.

1121
01:33:43,865 --> 01:33:46,561
He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.

1122
01:33:47,202 --> 01:33:48,396
Chivalrous?

1123
01:33:49,304 --> 01:33:52,535
And yet he's been what he's been
these last three years...

1124
01:33:52,707 --> 01:33:54,732
and done what he's done.

1125
01:33:55,844 --> 01:33:57,778
Lord Willoughby, help me.

1126
01:33:58,613 --> 01:34:00,672
I see your point, my child...

1127
01:34:00,749 --> 01:34:03,582
but that's something
you must decide for yourself.

1128
01:34:04,252 --> 01:34:06,914
Life can be infernally complex.

1129
01:34:30,812 --> 01:34:32,939
lt's hard to lay tongue to the right words.

1130
01:34:33,014 --> 01:34:34,504
I'll lay tongue to them.

1131
01:34:34,582 --> 01:34:36,379
We won't sail to Jamaica.
Them's the words.

1132
01:34:36,451 --> 01:34:39,147
Aye, Bishop's entire fleet's at Jamaica.

1133
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:42,084
When you risked your neck in a duel
over that petticoat...

1134
01:34:42,157 --> 01:34:43,590
that was your business.

1135
01:34:43,658 --> 01:34:46,889
But it's our necks you're risking now,
and I say no.

1136
01:34:46,961 --> 01:34:48,861
Not for her, nor a dozen like her.

1137
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:50,921
I got a great affection for my neck.

1138
01:34:50,999 --> 01:34:54,298
I have no wish to hear it cracked
by a hangman's knot.

1139
01:34:54,502 --> 01:34:58,029
This is what comes from sailing the seas
with a lovesick madman.

1140
01:35:00,775 --> 01:35:02,800
We've been with you since the first, Peter.

1141
01:35:02,877 --> 01:35:04,208
We have a right.

1142
01:35:07,916 --> 01:35:09,543
You, too, Jeremy?

1143
01:35:13,288 --> 01:35:14,653
All right, lads.

1144
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:16,885
What do you mean, Peter?

1145
01:35:17,492 --> 01:35:21,360
You told me we're not sailing to Jamaica.
There's nothing more to be said.

1146
01:35:21,896 --> 01:35:25,354
-Hurrah for our side!
-Quiet. You sound like a rooster.

1147
01:35:25,733 --> 01:35:27,132
Good night, lads.

1148
01:35:27,202 --> 01:35:30,433
Wait a minute, Peter.
Where are we sailing for?

1149
01:35:33,208 --> 01:35:34,800
That's for you to tell me...

1150
01:35:34,876 --> 01:35:36,605
since I'm no longer running this ship.

1151
01:35:36,678 --> 01:35:38,942
We didn't say that, Peter.

1152
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:41,171
As Jeremy says, you've got the right.

1153
01:35:41,249 --> 01:35:44,707
You've been with me from the first,
and you've been loyal and true...

1154
01:35:44,819 --> 01:35:48,152
followed me into every tight corner
men could follow another.

1155
01:35:48,223 --> 01:35:51,522
-But you always got us out.
-And none the poorer for it.

1156
01:35:51,659 --> 01:35:54,287
Yes, but on this occasion,
there's no gold to be got.

1157
01:35:54,362 --> 01:35:56,922
Do you think it was
for gold we followed you?

1158
01:35:57,265 --> 01:36:00,826
No, but I can see now I've not got
the right to ask you to follow me.

1159
01:36:00,902 --> 01:36:03,166
The girl is my concern, not yours.

1160
01:36:03,671 --> 01:36:07,732
Are we gonna stand by and see
this little snip laugh at our captain?

1161
01:36:07,842 --> 01:36:09,275
There's Bishop's fleet.

1162
01:36:09,344 --> 01:36:12,370
That might be paying a high price
to keep from being laughed at.

1163
01:36:12,447 --> 01:36:16,008
We're not yet such lily-livered scum
as to be afraid of Col. Bishop.

1164
01:36:16,317 --> 01:36:19,150
No. That is, not very afraid.

1165
01:36:20,688 --> 01:36:23,122
Fie on you deserting our captain
in this way...

1166
01:36:23,191 --> 01:36:26,957
you scurvy traitors, you Judas Iscariots,
you snakes in the grass...

1167
01:36:27,028 --> 01:36:28,928
you wolves in sheep's clothing!

1168
01:36:28,997 --> 01:36:31,192
I was only with them to spy on them.

1169
01:36:33,668 --> 01:36:35,727
You'd better think carefully, lads.

1170
01:36:35,803 --> 01:36:38,601
Yonder lies Jamaica,
and straight we sail for it.

1171
01:36:38,773 --> 01:36:42,766
-Aye. And straight we sail for it.
-Aye!

1172
01:36:56,824 --> 01:37:00,191
-Ahoy, the deck!
-Ahoy!

1173
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:02,559
I have sighted Port Royal!

1174
01:37:02,864 --> 01:37:05,332
Aye! Port Royal, you say?

1175
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:06,833
Aye, sir!

1176
01:37:14,142 --> 01:37:16,007
There's something amiss!

1177
01:37:16,744 --> 01:37:20,976
I see flashes of gunfire
from ships in the harbor!

1178
01:37:21,249 --> 01:37:22,944
-Fetch the Captain.
-Aye, sir.

1179
01:37:23,017 --> 01:37:26,214
Bugler, all hands on deck!

1180
01:37:56,050 --> 01:37:58,484
lt's terrible to wake up at dawn
dreaming of thunder.

1181
01:37:58,553 --> 01:38:00,714
That's gunfire if I ever heard any.

1182
01:38:02,123 --> 01:38:05,786
-There's a battle in Port Royal harbor.
-How many ships do you make out?

1183
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:09,921
lt's hard to see clearly in the early
morning light. I think there are two.

1184
01:38:10,231 --> 01:38:12,529
lt's an attack on Port Royal, but who?

1185
01:38:13,634 --> 01:38:15,226
Pirate craft, perhaps.

1186
01:38:15,870 --> 01:38:17,997
Wish I could make out their flags.

1187
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,671
-Perhaps I can supply you the answer.
-You can?

1188
01:38:22,744 --> 01:38:26,009
Yes, if I may speak to
so inaccessible a person.

1189
01:38:26,114 --> 01:38:29,277
lf Port Royal is being attacked,
they are likely French ships.

1190
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:30,339
French?

1191
01:38:38,092 --> 01:38:40,526
You say Port RoyaI's attacked
by the French? Why?

1192
01:38:40,595 --> 01:38:43,086
When two countries are at war
and one is attacked...

1193
01:38:43,164 --> 01:38:45,029
who would it be but the enemy?

1194
01:38:45,099 --> 01:38:47,590
What's this? France and England at war?

1195
01:38:47,668 --> 01:38:50,967
You mean you don't know? Where have
you been the past few months?

1196
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:52,870
At sea, out of touch with the world.

1197
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:56,068
The fire from the fortress is weakening!

1198
01:38:56,444 --> 01:38:59,880
One ship is already firing on the town!

1199
01:39:00,348 --> 01:39:01,440
That's strange.

1200
01:39:01,516 --> 01:39:04,485
Where is the English fleet
that's supposed to protect the town?

1201
01:39:04,552 --> 01:39:07,350
lt's my turn to supply the answer.
lt's out chasing pirates.

1202
01:39:07,422 --> 01:39:11,518
Bishop would never let his fleet leave its
post in time of war. He wouldn't dare.

1203
01:39:11,592 --> 01:39:15,255
Col. Bishop, if I may say,
is a very old and dear friend of mine.

1204
01:39:15,329 --> 01:39:18,230
-lt's probably me he's after.
-That fool! Blunder!

1205
01:39:18,299 --> 01:39:20,199
And me in his own front yard.

1206
01:39:22,203 --> 01:39:24,728
Shorten sail there, Wolf.
Lend a hand forward, Andy.

1207
01:39:24,806 --> 01:39:28,071
Stand by helm and keep her headed
two points to larboard of the fort.

1208
01:39:28,142 --> 01:39:29,131
Aye, aye, sir.

1209
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:30,973
Get your men to their stations, Chester.

1210
01:39:31,045 --> 01:39:32,239
Port watch to stations!

1211
01:39:32,313 --> 01:39:33,803
Speed there, lads!

1212
01:39:34,382 --> 01:39:36,907
-Reef the fore topsail!
-Aye, aye, sir!

1213
01:39:36,984 --> 01:39:38,975
Take in the topgallant sail.

1214
01:39:40,455 --> 01:39:43,083
May I ask, Captain,
what are your intentions?

1215
01:39:43,157 --> 01:39:46,615
Lord Willoughby, I set out to land you
at Port Royal, but now....

1216
01:39:52,333 --> 01:39:54,699
Miss Bishop,
an unlooked-for circumstance...

1217
01:39:54,769 --> 01:39:57,067
prevents my landing you
on your own dock.

1218
01:39:57,138 --> 01:40:00,005
But I trust that if I put you ashore
on the beach nearby...

1219
01:40:00,074 --> 01:40:02,099
that would be equally satisfactory?

1220
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:03,609
-l--
-Thank you.

1221
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:08,678
Only please understand, this is a bargain...

1222
01:40:08,749 --> 01:40:10,216
your freedom for my freedom.

1223
01:40:10,284 --> 01:40:13,117
From now on,
I no longer regard myself as a slave.

1224
01:40:14,255 --> 01:40:15,813
My life's my own...

1225
01:40:16,491 --> 01:40:19,051
even though I'm a thief and pirate.

1226
01:40:22,130 --> 01:40:24,598
Capt. Blood, are you,
an Englishman, thinking of leaving...

1227
01:40:24,665 --> 01:40:27,065
when yonder,
an English town is being taken?

1228
01:40:27,135 --> 01:40:29,569
Hagthorpe,
clear my deck and keep it cleared.

1229
01:40:29,637 --> 01:40:33,095
-Aye, Peter, we'll take care of him.
-Take your hands off!

1230
01:40:33,207 --> 01:40:36,335
-Wait, lads.
-Capt. Blood, I must talk to you.

1231
01:40:36,911 --> 01:40:38,674
Very well then, Lord Willoughby.

1232
01:40:38,746 --> 01:40:41,909
Myself, I've the honor to be Irish,
but part of my crew's English.

1233
01:40:41,983 --> 01:40:44,178
I was myself once, too, in loyalty.

1234
01:40:44,352 --> 01:40:45,580
Of what should we be thinking?

1235
01:40:45,653 --> 01:40:47,917
Of the chance to fight for your king.

1236
01:40:47,989 --> 01:40:49,513
To fight for my king?

1237
01:40:49,957 --> 01:40:53,017
Yes. He was loyal enough
to send me to seek you out...

1238
01:40:53,127 --> 01:40:55,652
to offer you pardon for your past crimes...

1239
01:40:55,730 --> 01:40:58,096
freedom from your slavery
and more than that...

1240
01:40:58,166 --> 01:41:01,192
a commission in his own navy
for you and your men.

1241
01:41:01,602 --> 01:41:05,163
You hear that, Chester?
The King wants us to join his navy!

1242
01:41:08,643 --> 01:41:10,406
Read it for yourself.

1243
01:41:10,478 --> 01:41:12,673
Lord Willoughby,
you're a guest aboard my ship...

1244
01:41:12,747 --> 01:41:16,183
and I've still some notion left me
from better days of decent behavior...

1245
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:18,741
so I'll not be telling you
what I think of this offer.

1246
01:41:18,819 --> 01:41:21,686
All I'll say is,
I wouldn't soil my hands with it...

1247
01:41:21,756 --> 01:41:24,623
even though they're the hands
of a thief and a pirate.

1248
01:41:24,992 --> 01:41:27,517
But this concerns you, too, my lads.

1249
01:41:28,129 --> 01:41:30,063
What do you say to serving the King?

1250
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:31,393
No!

1251
01:41:35,369 --> 01:41:37,860
I'd like to serve him with a rope necktie.

1252
01:41:38,739 --> 01:41:40,730
I'd rot before I'd serve him.

1253
01:41:41,642 --> 01:41:44,770
I'd sink this ship with all hands
before I'd serve him.

1254
01:41:44,845 --> 01:41:47,939
lt would appear then
that my crew is still a little dubious...

1255
01:41:48,015 --> 01:41:50,415
as to the merits of His Majesty's offer.

1256
01:41:50,618 --> 01:41:53,712
However you hate the King,
England is still England.

1257
01:41:53,854 --> 01:41:57,085
And a bad king is bad king,
and worse one if he's James.

1258
01:41:57,358 --> 01:42:00,521
James?
This commission is sent by King William.

1259
01:42:01,529 --> 01:42:05,021
King William? Who may King William be
and what's he king of?

1260
01:42:05,099 --> 01:42:08,364
I'm alluding to His Majesty,
King William III, William of Orange...

1261
01:42:08,436 --> 01:42:11,234
who, with Queen Mary,
has come over from the Netherlands...

1262
01:42:11,305 --> 01:42:14,536
and has been ruling England
the past two months or more.

1263
01:42:16,978 --> 01:42:20,243
They've roused themselves at home
and kicked out that pimple James?

1264
01:42:20,314 --> 01:42:23,044
Yes, and he's fled to France
and he's in hiding there...

1265
01:42:23,117 --> 01:42:25,176
and England and France are at war.

1266
01:42:25,286 --> 01:42:28,187
The English people will go so far,
Capt. Blood...

1267
01:42:28,256 --> 01:42:31,191
and then they get up
on their stubborn hind legs.

1268
01:42:31,259 --> 01:42:33,557
-And William sent us this commission?
-Yes.

1269
01:42:34,095 --> 01:42:37,997
He knows you're good men,
wrongfully sold into slavery.

1270
01:42:38,065 --> 01:42:41,364
He can use good men in his navy.

1271
01:42:41,435 --> 01:42:43,528
lt's the long-winded fellow you are.

1272
01:42:43,604 --> 01:42:46,300
Why didn't you tell us this
in the first place?

1273
01:42:47,708 --> 01:42:50,268
Bugler, summon the men amidships!

1274
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:03,217
Men!
I've just heard a startling piece of news.

1275
01:43:03,357 --> 01:43:07,589
King James is kicked out of England
and good King William reigns in his stead.

1276
01:43:11,532 --> 01:43:14,831
For me,
this changes the shape of the world.

1277
01:43:15,136 --> 01:43:17,229
For you who were slaves with me...

1278
01:43:17,305 --> 01:43:19,569
it means that we're no longer slaves.

1279
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,666
That we once more have
a home and a country.

1280
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:24,568
For you who are English...

1281
01:43:24,645 --> 01:43:27,478
it means a chance to fight
for your native land...

1282
01:43:27,548 --> 01:43:31,143
for I now propose to sail into Port Royal
and take it from the French!

1283
01:43:31,218 --> 01:43:33,209
Those of you who are not English...

1284
01:43:33,421 --> 01:43:36,390
will have to be content
with fighting for Capt. Blood...

1285
01:43:38,359 --> 01:43:41,294
and the loot you'll find
on the French ships.

1286
01:43:42,663 --> 01:43:45,689
-Are you willing to fight, men?
-Aye!

1287
01:43:46,701 --> 01:43:49,033
Have we an English battle flag on board,
Hagthorpe?

1288
01:43:49,103 --> 01:43:53,062
We have every manner of battle flag,
including a lady's purple petticoat.

1289
01:43:53,374 --> 01:43:55,137
Wait, I've a better idea.

1290
01:43:55,209 --> 01:43:58,042
When an English lion creeps up
on a nest of French foxes...

1291
01:43:58,112 --> 01:43:59,374
he wears a bushy tail.

1292
01:43:59,447 --> 01:44:02,780
Hoist the French flag, Hagthorpe.
Keep her trimmed by the head, Wolf.

1293
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:04,044
Stand by the helm, Jeremy.

1294
01:44:04,118 --> 01:44:06,109
Forward, men, to your stations.

1295
01:44:07,088 --> 01:44:09,579
-ls that satisfactory to you?
-Perfectly.

1296
01:44:19,667 --> 01:44:21,362
Clear decks for action!

1297
01:44:26,207 --> 01:44:29,370
Capt. Blood's orders.
You'll be put ashore with these men.

1298
01:44:29,443 --> 01:44:31,707
A ship is no place for a woman
in time of battle.

1299
01:44:31,779 --> 01:44:34,247
-I want to talk to him.
-I'm sorry. The Captain's busy.

1300
01:44:34,315 --> 01:44:35,714
-lnto the boat.
-Aye, sir.

1301
01:44:35,783 --> 01:44:37,410
Follow me, Miss Bishop.

1302
01:45:24,799 --> 01:45:27,097
Musketeers, to your stations!

1303
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:51,018
A French ship.

1304
01:45:54,328 --> 01:45:57,195
Hope we get on them
before they discover the trick.

1305
01:46:10,711 --> 01:46:11,837
-Andy.
-Aye, Peter.

1306
01:46:11,912 --> 01:46:14,904
Run to Hagthorpe.
Tell him to fetch all the hot coals.

1307
01:46:14,982 --> 01:46:16,950
-Put them by the guns.
-Hot coals, sir?

1308
01:46:17,017 --> 01:46:19,815
-No questions. Run.
-Aye, aye, sir!

1309
01:46:27,761 --> 01:46:30,662
Stand by ready to fire as soon as
we come amidships.

1310
01:46:30,898 --> 01:46:34,425
Stand ready to fire
as soon as we've come amidships!

1311
01:46:34,902 --> 01:46:36,563
Open your ports!

1312
01:47:10,771 --> 01:47:13,569
Strike that French flag
and hoist our own colors.

1313
01:47:17,211 --> 01:47:18,838
Man your port guns!

1314
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:24,977
Ready, Hagthorpe?

1315
01:47:27,354 --> 01:47:28,685
Fire!

1316
01:47:42,436 --> 01:47:45,405
Hagthorpe,
give them the hot galley broadside!

1317
01:47:45,472 --> 01:47:48,032
Aye, Peter! Load them, lads!

1318
01:48:32,987 --> 01:48:35,888
Hagthorpe, keep pounding that water line!

1319
01:48:45,532 --> 01:48:47,500
We never miss.

1320
01:49:04,118 --> 01:49:07,485
-That's one ship neatly disposed off.
-Now for the other one.

1321
01:49:07,955 --> 01:49:10,788
-Jeremy, helm quarter to port.
-Aye, aye, Peter.

1322
01:49:10,858 --> 01:49:12,485
Clear away that burning wreckage!

1323
01:49:15,696 --> 01:49:18,597
-Port guns, Wolf. Hurry.
-Aye, Peter.

1324
01:49:18,899 --> 01:49:21,129
Man your port guns!

1325
01:49:45,959 --> 01:49:48,723
Those French gunners
must've learnt their trade in England.

1326
01:49:48,796 --> 01:49:50,730
That's their third direct hit.

1327
01:50:00,607 --> 01:50:02,871
Two guns out of order.
Ship's taking water below.

1328
01:50:02,943 --> 01:50:04,968
Replace them with two
from the starboard side.

1329
01:50:05,045 --> 01:50:07,741
-Keep hammering that waterline.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1330
01:50:20,661 --> 01:50:22,925
Lower gun deck's awash, we're sinking.
What should we do?

1331
01:50:22,996 --> 01:50:26,261
Do? We'll board a ship that's not sinking.
Get your men forward.

1332
01:50:26,333 --> 01:50:27,322
Aye, aye, sir.

1333
01:50:29,903 --> 01:50:32,235
-What now, Peter?
-Take the helm yourself, lad.

1334
01:50:32,306 --> 01:50:33,773
Straight into them !

1335
01:50:36,643 --> 01:50:39,703
-We'll never do it, Peter!
-Musketeers to the prow!

1336
01:50:39,780 --> 01:50:43,716
Grappling hooks to larboard. Forward
gunners, fire as hard as they can load!

1337
01:50:47,654 --> 01:50:49,349
Rapid fire, men!

1338
01:50:49,423 --> 01:50:51,516
Hagthorpe, double them up!

1339
01:50:51,859 --> 01:50:54,726
They won't take it, Peter!
They're blazing hot!

1340
01:51:03,771 --> 01:51:06,001
Up into the shrouds, men!

1341
01:51:13,680 --> 01:51:15,511
We're going to swing across on ropes.

1342
01:51:15,582 --> 01:51:17,482
When we clear the rail,
come over the side!

1343
01:51:17,551 --> 01:51:18,643
Aye, aye, Peter!

1344
01:51:23,524 --> 01:51:25,788
You and your men swing across
into their rigging.

1345
01:51:25,859 --> 01:51:28,828
When you see me cut down
that French flag, drop down.

1346
01:51:31,865 --> 01:51:33,924
Up, men, into the shrouds!

1347
01:51:36,737 --> 01:51:39,297
Strong and sure! Grapnels over!

1348
01:52:19,079 --> 01:52:21,604
All right, my hearties, follow me!

1349
01:52:45,038 --> 01:52:46,266
Follow on, men!

1350
01:53:06,059 --> 01:53:08,892
''Dust thou art,
and unto dust thou shalt return.''

1351
01:53:37,391 --> 01:53:39,086
''Love thy neighbor as thyself.''

1352
01:53:39,159 --> 01:53:41,252
Leviticus 19:18.

1353
01:55:22,662 --> 01:55:26,223
-Hurry, Cato. We'll be late.
-Yes. The fleet's in already.

1354
01:55:34,941 --> 01:55:37,000
-Stop!
-Yes.

1355
01:55:41,181 --> 01:55:42,808
Capt. Blood!

1356
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:48,080
Miss Bishop.

1357
01:55:49,689 --> 01:55:51,657
I'll be on the veranda.

1358
01:55:54,428 --> 01:55:55,827
I thought you'd gone.

1359
01:55:55,896 --> 01:55:57,887
You can't be here.
My uncle's just returned.

1360
01:55:57,964 --> 01:55:59,659
-Yes, I know.
-You know?

1361
01:55:59,733 --> 01:56:01,598
-What are you going to do?
-Just stay here.

1362
01:56:01,668 --> 01:56:03,829
No, it's impossible. You mustn't stay here.

1363
01:56:03,904 --> 01:56:06,031
-He's sworn he'll hang you.
-I doubt he will.

1364
01:56:06,106 --> 01:56:07,903
I've always been bad luck for your uncle.

1365
01:56:07,974 --> 01:56:11,205
You can't know the threats he's made.
The dreadful threats he's made.

1366
01:56:11,278 --> 01:56:13,269
His whole life is spent
in searching for you.

1367
01:56:13,346 --> 01:56:16,179
-Now he's found me.
-But you can still save yourself.

1368
01:56:16,249 --> 01:56:18,149
Please, for my sake.

1369
01:56:18,218 --> 01:56:21,984
For your sake? What do you mean for your
sake? Isn't it true that you hate me?

1370
01:56:23,056 --> 01:56:25,320
-Hate you?
-Or is it that you love me?

1371
01:56:25,892 --> 01:56:28,793
I'll hide you.
And tonight after dark, I'll find some way--

1372
01:56:28,862 --> 01:56:30,762
You love me, don't you?

1373
01:56:31,932 --> 01:56:34,992
Whom else would I love? Now will you?

1374
01:56:35,068 --> 01:56:36,660
You love me!

1375
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:39,204
Lord Willoughby, she loves me!

1376
01:56:41,041 --> 01:56:43,441
He'll be here any minute.
I'll hide you somewhere.

1377
01:56:43,510 --> 01:56:46,035
We'll hide together. I know just the place.

1378
01:56:58,191 --> 01:56:59,419
How's this?

1379
01:56:59,493 --> 01:57:01,654
You must be mad. He'll come here first.

1380
01:57:01,728 --> 01:57:03,525
Good. I forgot to tell you.

1381
01:57:03,697 --> 01:57:05,688
The Governor and I are
on the best of terms.

1382
01:57:05,765 --> 01:57:08,256
He lets me come and go here
as I please. Look.

1383
01:57:13,974 --> 01:57:17,171
-You can't arrest me!
-I have, by order of the Governor.

1384
01:57:17,244 --> 01:57:19,804
The Governor? You are mad.
I am the governor.

1385
01:57:19,880 --> 01:57:22,007
You mean, you were the governor.

1386
01:57:22,282 --> 01:57:24,978
But we've changed that in your absence.

1387
01:57:25,085 --> 01:57:26,279
What?

1388
01:57:26,353 --> 01:57:29,880
You're broken for abandoning your post
in time of war.

1389
01:57:30,157 --> 01:57:31,146
Who are you?

1390
01:57:31,224 --> 01:57:34,557
My name is Willoughby. I'm a special
emissary of His Majesty the King.

1391
01:57:34,661 --> 01:57:35,821
Lord Willoughby?

1392
01:57:35,896 --> 01:57:38,330
-You were informed, I think, of my coming.
-Yes.

1393
01:57:38,398 --> 01:57:41,561
Yet you went off
on some wild goose chase after a pirate...

1394
01:57:41,635 --> 01:57:44,103
leaving your capital at the mercy
of the enemy.

1395
01:57:44,171 --> 01:57:47,334
Col. Bishop, this is a serious matter,
as you may well find.

1396
01:57:47,407 --> 01:57:49,500
Seeing that you hold your office
from James...

1397
01:57:49,676 --> 01:57:52,702
it's even possible the charge of treason
lies against you.

1398
01:57:52,779 --> 01:57:53,768
But, my lord--

1399
01:57:53,847 --> 01:57:56,714
I'm not concerned to hear
your reasons, man.

1400
01:57:56,850 --> 01:57:59,444
-His Excellency the Governor will.
-The Governor?

1401
01:57:59,519 --> 01:58:01,146
You'll find him inside.

1402
01:58:01,288 --> 01:58:04,189
lt rests entirely with him
whether you're hanged or not.

1403
01:58:06,259 --> 01:58:08,420
This is the fault of that scoundrel Blood.

1404
01:58:08,495 --> 01:58:10,963
What a reckoning
there'll be when we meet.

1405
01:58:12,699 --> 01:58:16,465
Have mercy, Your Excellency!

1406
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:19,138
-Arabella, why are you here?
-Uncle!

1407
01:58:20,707 --> 01:58:23,301
I have been pleading
with the Governor on your behalf...

1408
01:58:23,376 --> 01:58:26,777
asking him to be as merciful
as you would be cruel.

1409
01:58:29,049 --> 01:58:32,246
Uncle, this is the Governor.

1410
01:58:38,725 --> 01:58:40,852
Good morning, Uncle.

1411
01:59:03,683 --> 01:59:04,672
English
