1
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:17,607
CAPTAIN PANTOJA AND
THE SPECIAL SERVICE...

2
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:52,073
You're sure this is our man?

3
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:55,304
Intelligence investigated his life...

4
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,709
private and professional.

5
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,646
Entered the Academy...

6
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:00,875
first place.

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,816
Chose administration.

8
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:03,750
He was...

9
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,049
class valedictorian.

10
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,283
He hoisted the flag...

11
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:11,053
in every yearly closing ceremony.

12
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,393
And even to date...

13
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,261
no cadet has matched his average.

14
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,661
He prefers sports and studying...

15
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,833
but also socializes.

16
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,935
Here he is with Alfonsina Reaño...

17
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,510
they married three years later.

18
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,512
She's a decent girl...

19
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,614
down to earth, good housewife.

20
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,645
This looks nice!

21
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,550
I wonder where they'll send us.
Don't you?

22
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,486
Anywhere they say is good for me.

23
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,557
Right.

24
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,228
You married the army before me.

25
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,160
Where would you like them
to send us?

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,834
Chiclayo, again. Maybe Tacna.

27
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,536
What about the mountains
or the jungle?

28
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,231
I hate the mountains.

29
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,240
The jungle... Maybe Iquitos.

30
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,877
As long as it's a city...

31
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:00,980
and not some camp.

32
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,806
Think of our little cadet.

33
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,711
Now we can send for him, right?

34
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,750
Now?

35
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,581
Maybe.

36
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,246
Or tonight.
Who cares if it's not Saturday?

37
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,459
I'm late, Pochita.

38
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,719
It's half an hour to the ministry...

39
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,353
disregarding traffic.

40
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,261
All right. Let's eat breakfast,
Captain, sir.

41
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,972
I have an appointment
with the General.

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,974
Yes, Captain. He's waiting for you.

43
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,682
Congratulations,
on your brilliant promotion.

44
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:42,478
Thanks, sir.

45
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,314
I heard of your promotion.

46
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,357
First place by unanimous decision!

47
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,789
Congratulations.

48
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,726
Thank you, General, sir.

49
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,660
Sit down.

50
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,437
Cigarette?

51
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,230
No, thanks.

52
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,397
You see?

53
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,133
He doesn't smoke or drink.

54
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,107
No bad habits.

55
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,839
He can represent our army
in paradise...

56
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,016
next to Saint Martin and Saint Rose.

57
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,149
I must have some habits
you don't know about.

58
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,322
We know everything about you.

59
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:21,450
You wouldn't believe how much.

60
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,186
Well...

61
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,320
let's cut to the chase.

62
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:29,424
The mission
we are about to give you...

63
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,697
is of the utmost secrecy.

64
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,075
Here's the thing, Pantoja:

65
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,075
Recently,
our troops in the jungle have been...

66
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:41,937
riled up.

67
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,879
At first, we thought...

68
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,111
there were only isolated occurrences...

69
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:51,016
maybe caused by the climate
or their diet.

70
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,057
But things...

71
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,387
have gotten worse.

72
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,290
General Scavino
and especially Father Beltran...

73
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:03,266
whose daily memos
I'm up to here with...

74
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,303
have taken some action.

75
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,837
But no type of punishment...

76
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,873
has solved the problem.

77
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:13,035
So, more drastic measures
are in order.

78
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,443
That's where you come in.

79
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,217
I don't understand, General, sir...

80
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,421
This is a very important mission.

81
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:27,083
General Scavino will brief you
upon your arrival.

82
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,295
You will leave on Monday.

83
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,258
I hope you like the jungle.

84
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,160
From now on,
you have all my support...

85
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,563
on this difficult task.

86
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,903
I wish you luck.

87
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,374
The army's prestige...

88
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,604
is in your hands.

89
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,512
<i>And as paladin of the Amazon...</i>

90
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,447
<i>I feel compelled to raise my voice...</i>

91
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,815
<i>to defend the women of our land!</i>

92
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,292
<i>I am not unpatriotic.</i>

93
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,352
<i>But my love for the army...</i>

94
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,258
<i>can't make me hide the truth.</i>

95
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,563
<i>The raping wave that is</i>
<i>sweeping our region...</i>

96
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:14,469
<i>tarnishing the honor</i>
<i>of our beautiful women...</i>

97
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,698
<i>has a guilty party!</i>

98
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,912
<i>The rapists are the soldiers</i>
<i>of our army!</i>

99
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,642
Yes, ladies and gentlemen...

100
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,546
our very own soldiers.

101
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,552
It's hard to admit it...

102
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,983
but I have irrefutable evidence!

103
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,394
What is happening to our army?

104
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,064
What do...

105
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,699
the authorities have to say about it?

106
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:49,298
Captain Pantaleon Pantoja
is entrusted with...

107
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,669
the mission of implementing...

108
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:56,908
a "Visitors' Service for Garrisons,
Border Posts...

109
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,482
and Related Quarters"
to fulfill the needs of...

110
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,487
Excuse me, sir.

111
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:07,192
What do you mean by "visitors"?

112
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,622
Do you mean?

113
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,659
Whores!

114
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,894
Yes, whores!

115
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,162
General Collazos
and his strategists from Lima...

116
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,564
have concocted the idea
of taking women...

117
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:22,332
from camp to camp,
so the troops may fornicate.

118
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,702
And you, a Peruvian army Captain...

119
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,043
will be acting as pimp...

120
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,778
or whatever sex merchants
are called.

121
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,584
Excuse me, sir.

122
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,627
I don't consider myself fit
for this mission.

123
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,188
Please reconsider...

124
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:47,026
It's too late.
It's an order to be obeyed.

125
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,066
I will do my best.

126
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:54,037
I don't want you in these headquarters
or in any other.

127
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:59,968
You are excused from attending
official ceremonies, parades, etc.

128
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,977
And I forbid you to dress in uniform.

129
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,917
Even at my workplace?

130
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,146
Your work will be done far away
from headquarters.

131
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,688
What kind of support will I have
for my mission?

132
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,054
An officer has been appointed.

133
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,765
Lieutenant Bacacorzo...

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,663
will serve as liaison between you
and your superiors.

135
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,202
Any other questions, Captain?

136
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,574
We won't live in the villa
with the other officers.

137
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,510
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

138
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,274
We will be civilians.

139
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,352
I will pose as a merchant
on business.

140
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:46,422
I don't understand your job.
Why do we have to hide?

141
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,326
I'm talking to you.

142
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,861
I'm listening Pantaleon Pantoja,
tell me what this is about.

143
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:57,660
There would never be lies between us,
remember?

144
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,337
Why won't you tell me?

145
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,173
I'll be working in the...

146
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,137
Intelligence Service.

147
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,637
Intelligence Service?

148
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,545
Now I understand the mystery!

149
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,720
What must you find out?

150
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,116
I can't tell you.
Orders.

151
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,621
Come on.
Who do you have to spy?

152
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,322
Is it war with Ecuador?

153
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,297
Does it have to do
with the Rio Protocol?

154
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:38,176
You can't imagine what keeping
my mission from my wife is like.

155
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,474
I've never lied to her, Lieutenant.

156
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,509
Ever.

157
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,475
Many would want to be in your shoes,
Captain.

158
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,584
Not me.

159
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,449
I'm in a jam.

160
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,188
How can I organize this service?

161
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,555
I've had no contact with prostitutes!

162
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,396
Where do I start?

163
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,656
At the beginning.

164
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,269
Go to a brothel and look.

165
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,698
I recommend Madam Leonor's...

166
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,040
better known as Chuchupe.

167
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,605
She's closing, and her girls
will be out of a job.

168
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,544
They're the best around.

169
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,449
I would come with you...

170
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:24,087
but you know
Scavino's orders.

171
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,599
- Hello, cutie.
- Hello.

172
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,209
- Do you dance?
- Sorry.

173
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,545
I don't dance.

174
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,809
You like cutting to the chase, huh?

175
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,679
Me too.

176
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,781
But you have to buy a ticket first.

177
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,321
You don't understand.

178
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,995
I'm not here to... satisfy my needs.

179
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,790
I'm here to talk with Mrs. Leonor.

180
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,828
Could you tell her, please?

181
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,530
I'd be glad to.

182
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,530
We can still do it.

183
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,300
Listen.

184
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,543
Look for me when you are through.

185
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,410
I just love
clean-cut boys like you.

186
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,015
Good evening.

187
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,380
My name is Pantaleon Pantoja.

188
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,050
Welcome to Chuchupe's.

189
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,085
Here, we're nice to everyone...

190
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,529
except soldiers
who want to fuck for free.

191
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,730
What can I do for you?

192
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,367
I would like to talk business.

193
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:25,863
In private.

194
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,236
Are you telling me to go?

195
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,375
A drink?

196
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,643
A beer and two glasses.

197
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,282
On the house.

198
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,575
Or do you prefer
something stronger?

199
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,309
No. I don't drink.

200
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:48,218
I am a businessman,
and I have come to Iquitos to...

201
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,061
to invest.

202
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,433
I heard you are closing down...

203
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,727
and I thought I could...

204
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,096
Open a brothel?

205
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,830
Here's some advice.

206
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,134
You seem like a nice man,
and I like you.

207
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,811
This is a rotten business.

208
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,471
If you want money,
open a restaurant.

209
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,149
That's strange.

210
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,082
I was told that because of the heat...

211
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,781
demand was high.

212
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,082
And it is.

213
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,022
But, with the soldiers
that won't pay...

214
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:26,256
the bribes, and the rent...

215
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,662
I'm losing money.

216
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,435
So I'm closing and keeping
my meager savings...

217
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,437
for my golden years.

218
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,708
I feel sorry for my girls...

219
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,304
I am fond of them.

220
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,607
They're good, hardworking girls.

221
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,712
Maybe we can reach an agreement...

222
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,978
that will benefit us both.

223
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:55,891
Your knowledge is very valuable
for my plans.

224
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,187
If you do close down...

225
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,990
I'd be interested in hiring you...

226
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,128
and some of your girls.

227
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,233
I'm listening.

228
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,915
Taking hookers to the military posts!

229
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,993
It would be great business!

230
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,897
But they would never let us in,
Mister Pantoja.

231
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,399
I already have permission.

232
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,765
And don't call them hookers
or whores.

233
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,667
The correct term is "visitors."

234
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,170
You have permission?

235
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,275
Don't tell me you are a soldier.

236
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,243
Of course not.

237
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:59,088
I want you to think it over.

238
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,952
I'll be back in a few days
with a work plan...

239
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,121
I accept now! This is heaven sent.

240
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,965
"Colombiana" wants to speak to you.

241
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,161
Colombiana?

242
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,275
- What does she want?
- Should she wait?

243
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,208
No. I'll see her now.

244
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,142
If she wants a job, there's none.

245
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,145
I'll be right back.

246
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,715
Go ahead.

247
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,913
- Is she really Colombian?
- Nobody knows.

248
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,684
She says she is.

249
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,318
She's been working abroad...

250
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:39,758
and probably got into trouble.

251
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,160
Very attractive.

252
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,563
The best this land has to offer.

253
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:50,007
But I don't recommend her.
She's rotten goods.

254
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,974
Two men have already
killed themselves over her.

255
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:18,760
It's about time!
It's past eleven.

256
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,495
I have a splitting headache.

257
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,937
It figures. You know what?

258
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,236
I'm glad you feel sick.

259
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,346
You came tumbling in at sunrise.
Don't you remember?

260
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,516
Lower your voice, please.

261
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,117
I've never felt so bad.

262
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,243
Come pet me.

263
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,525
You're going to tell me
what this is about.

264
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,794
Where were you?

265
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,293
It's this damn job.

266
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,957
You know I hate these things.

267
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,568
You've been with women,
haven't you?

268
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:56,803
I'm sure you have been with women.

269
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,669
Never, Pochita.

270
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:03,379
Don't cry. You make me feel
like a criminal.

271
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,379
You know I don't have eyes
for another.

272
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,848
Then tell me where you were.

273
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:18,019
<i>The undersigned,</i>
<i>Captain Pantaleon Pantoja...</i>

274
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,998
<i>a Visitors' Service for Garrisons...</i>

275
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,126
<i>Border Posts</i>
<i>and Related Quarters...</i>

276
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,830
<i>respectfully informs:</i>

277
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,668
<i>That he has taken possession</i>
<i>of the site located on the Itaya River...</i>

278
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,005
<i>as Command Quarters...</i>

279
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,343
<i>and Logistical Center.</i>

280
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:42,414
<i>That he has under his command</i>
<i>the two soldiers...</i>

281
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,613
<i>named Sinforoso Caiguas</i>
<i>and Palomino Rioalto...</i>

282
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,490
<i>whom the superiority</i>
<i>has adequately chosen...</i>

283
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,690
<i>due to their fine conduct records</i>
<i>and their indifference...</i>

284
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:55,925
<i>toward the opposite sex.</i>

285
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:00,537
<i>That, during the first week,</i>
<i>the undersigned...</i>

286
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:04,731
<i>employed most of his time</i>
<i>in cleaning.</i>

287
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:08,711
<i>That a week might seem</i>
<i>an excessive time...</i>

288
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,543
<i>to carry out this task...</i>

289
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,987
<i>but the facility's condition...</i>

290
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,579
<i>can only be described...</i>

291
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,057
<i>as disgusting.</i>

292
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,287
<i>Since the army had abandoned</i>
<i>this facility...</i>

293
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,432
<i>it had been used illegally.</i>

294
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:32,230
<i>The undersigned provided</i>
<i>Caiguas and Rioalto...</i>

295
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:36,330
<i>the necessary equipment...</i>

296
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,543
<i>to burn the debris, clean...</i>

297
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,738
<i>and disinfect the facility.</i>

298
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:49,114
<i>The walls have been repaired...</i>

299
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:52,519
<i>the grounds have been cleaned...</i>

300
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,855
<i>and the small dock</i>
<i>has been repaired.</i>

301
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,393
<i>The undersigned</i>
<i>is proud to inform that...</i>

302
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:00,962
<i>using ten...</i>

303
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,124
<i>and twelve-hour shifts...</i>

304
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:07,967
<i>and disregarding his wife,</i>
<i>who has conditioned a house alone...</i>

305
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,870
<i>has turned the dump he received...</i>

306
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,877
<i>into an inhabitable, orderly...</i>

307
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,913
<i>and clean place...</i>

308
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,943
<i>as is expected of every army facility...</i>

309
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,713
<i>even if it is clandestine...</i>

310
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,771
What do you think of my new outfit?

311
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:52,877
Horrible.

312
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,177
I prefer you in uniform.

313
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,618
You're going out again?

314
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,224
I'd rather stay here with you...

315
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,593
and make our little cadet...

316
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,457
We could do it right now.
Don't you want to?

317
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,634
I can't. I'm going to
the movies with Alicia.

318
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,168
I'm starting to get jealous of her.

319
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,636
What do you expect me to do?

320
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,139
It's your job's fault.

321
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,514
It's hard for me too.
We have to be patient.

322
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:28,152
Leave it. Don't get dressed.

323
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,989
I like you more every day.

324
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,929
I don't know you anymore.

325
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,167
And, with those clothes...

326
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,997
it's as if I was cheating on you.

327
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,141
The voice of Sinchi!

328
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,977
Good afternoon, dear listeners.

329
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,452
Continuing
with our moralizing campaign...

330
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:06,647
in defense of our women's
physical and moral integrity...

331
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,690
your servant, The Sinchi...

332
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,797
<i>invites you to join our cause...</i>

333
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,966
<i>in demanding</i>
<i>a clear and forceful answer...</i>

334
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:19,398
<i>from the authorities...</i>

335
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,198
<i>to the abuse carried out...</i>

336
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,071
by depraved members of our army.

337
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,178
Yes, ladies and gentlemen.

338
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:32,147
<i>We demand</i>
<i>punishment for the rapists...</i>

339
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:42,858
Good afternoon.

340
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,423
You are seven minutes late.

341
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,669
If you were in the service,
you'd be fined.

342
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,130
I'd pay happily to work...

343
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,503
with you in the service.

344
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:03,477
You'd work fourteen-hour days,
and on holidays.

345
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,243
And that's not enough.

346
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,110
The results of the quarter polls...

347
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,949
are alarming.

348
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,986
Look at that!

349
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,926
Now that's a babe!

350
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,796
You know the Colombiana?

351
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:30,134
You sure move quickly!

352
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:33,267
I saw her at Chuchupe's.

353
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:37,843
If she were in the service...

354
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,474
we'd be famous.

355
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:42,209
Maybe later on.

356
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:46,049
For now, Chuchupe
and Chupito are recruiting.

357
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,825
Well, here are the poll results.

358
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,123
They're alarming.

359
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:59,403
Potential number of users
of the Visitors' Service: 8,726.

360
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,072
Number of renderings...

361
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,102
"Renderings"?

362
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:10,481
Monthly service renderings,
desired: 12.

363
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:14,310
So, if the service
is to satisfy the demand...

364
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:18,421
it should administer
a monthly average...

365
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:21,117
of 104,712 renderings.

366
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,456
104,000?

367
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,792
That's a lot of hookers...

368
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,527
I mean... visitors.

369
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,967
Averaging 20 renderings a day...

370
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,299
for each high quality visitor...

371
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,772
working full-time, we would need...

372
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,711
2,271 prostitutes?

373
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,878
That man has gone mad!

374
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:50,451
He'll turn our whole army
into a brothel!

375
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,123
Calm down. Let me continue.

376
00:24:54,426 --> 00:25:00,331
...2,271 visitors, which is surely
impossible at this time.

377
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:03,332
<i>I suggest beginning with five...</i>

378
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:07,629
<i>who would administer</i>
<i>4,800 monthly renderings...</i>

379
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:11,274
<i>in six-day weeks, working full-time.</i>

380
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:16,472
<i>He requests permission to recruit</i>
<i>"Chuchupe"...</i>

381
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,809
<i>a woman with experience</i>
<i>in the matter...</i>

382
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:23,145
<i>who would act as chief of staff...</i>

383
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,879
<i>and would supervise</i>
<i>the feminine element.</i>

384
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,754
This is an insult to the uniform!

385
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,689
That man should
be put in jail!

386
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,263
The undersigned requests authorization
to carry out a trial experiment...

387
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,168
and awaits the go ahead
to enlist...

388
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,372
the first five visitors,
who would be earning...

389
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,666
A salary extracted
from our institution's funds!

390
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,876
General Collazos
will never allow this!

391
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:49,608
ACCEPTED

392
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,306
<i>You will arrive first...</i>

393
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:54,009
in order to talk with the users...

394
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,914
and install sites for the renderings.

395
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:58,383
Sites? Renderings?

396
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,592
You have to get used to the terms.

397
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:05,387
Users are clients, sites are the beds...

398
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,359
renderings are screwings...

399
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,227
and visitors are the girls. Right?

400
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,800
- The candidates?
- Tomorrow morning.

401
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,131
I've called ten top-notch girls...

402
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,933
so you can choose five.

403
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,143
Chuchupe!

404
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:20,569
Chupito!

405
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,309
I heard you closed down.

406
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:28,082
A great loss for the city's nightlife.

407
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,782
What will you do now?

408
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,721
- A new business?
- Something like that.

409
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,291
German Laudano Rosales...

410
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,990
at your service.
I see you aren't a local.

411
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,360
The Capital?

412
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,161
Pantaleon Pantoja.

413
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:49,137
Welcome to this land of
friendship and beauty.

414
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,108
Have you been here long?

415
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:56,280
He has a popular radio show,
"The Voice of Sinchi."

416
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,805
My wife listens to it.

417
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,745
I hope she likes it.

418
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,351
What brings you here?

419
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:03,954
Are you "hunting"?

420
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,690
I'm happily married.

421
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:08,554
No, on business.

422
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,387
Well...

423
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,829
good luck in your...

424
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,332
"business."

425
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,800
It's been a pleasure.
See you around.

426
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,672
He asks too many questions.

427
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,642
He's a professional busybody.
Don't mind him.

428
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:34,314
<i>In order to gather information...</i>

429
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:38,147
<i>the undersigned</i>
<i>investigated products...</i>

430
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,486
<i>with alleged aphrodisiac properties...</i>

431
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,158
<i>to personally verify...</i>

432
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:51,098
<i>over a four-day period,</i>
<i>in what way...</i>

433
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,898
<i>these products</i>
<i>could enhance the problem...</i>

434
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:55,834
<i>of the troops.</i>

435
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,904
<i>Some of these products...</i>

436
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,844
<i>brought on an increase...</i>

437
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,008
<i>of sexual behavior,</i>
<i>to the point where...</i>

438
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:10,849
<i>only self-fondling</i>
<i>and the virile act occupied him...</i>

439
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,184
<i>affecting concentration...</i>

440
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:15,393
<i>his nervous system...</i>

441
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,121
<i>and his working efficiency.</i>

442
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,891
<i>He requested intercourse with his wife...</i>

443
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:24,192
<i>an average of three times a day...</i>

444
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,269
<i>which logically made her uneasy...</i>

445
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,836
<i>as she was not accustomed to this.</i>

446
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:31,804
<i>Because of this, I recommend...</i>

447
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:35,879
<i>to my superiors that the intake</i>
<i>of these products...</i>

448
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:40,050
<i>be prohibited</i>
<i>at jungle posts and quarters.</i>

449
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,546
<i>I inform I have enlisted</i>
<i>the first visitors.</i>

450
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,322
<i>A difficult task since...</i>

451
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,792
<i>I was still under the influence...</i>

452
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,897
<i>of long acting aphrodisiacs.</i>

453
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,469
Thank you. Call the next one.

454
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:07,809
What do you think?

455
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,979
It's harder than I thought.

456
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:13,812
You must like one over the rest.

457
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,520
- May I?
- Come in, girl.

458
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,765
Here I am, Mister Panta.

459
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:30,968
Good morning.

460
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,297
Name, please.

461
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,336
Pechuga.

462
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:42,137
Luisa Canepa,
not taken or involved.

463
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,538
Ok, miss.

464
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,148
Show me.

465
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:01,964
Accepted!

466
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,527
They're coming, Captain!

467
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:12,372
<i>The undersigned,</i>
<i>Captain Pantaleon Pantoja...</i>

468
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,943
<i>respectfully informs:</i>

469
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,841
<i>That the expected vessel...</i>

470
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,952
<i>arrived at our logistic center</i>
<i>of the Itaya River.</i>

471
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:26,351
<i>It was piloted by petty officer</i>
<i>Carlos Rodriguez...</i>

472
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:30,493
<i>who was quickly told</i>
<i>of the mission's secrecy.</i>

473
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:37,893
There are only six days until
we carry out the trial mission...

474
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,398
at the post of Horcones.

475
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,367
Mrs. Chuchupe, please.

476
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,466
Rules are rules.

477
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,206
I need not tell you...

478
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,573
that here lies
the future of the service.

479
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,646
The girls are ready, sir.

480
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,514
Bring them in, please.

481
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,187
Caiguas and Rioalto
have designed uniforms.

482
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,894
What do you think, sir?

483
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,492
With a zipper for quick removal.

484
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,599
What do you think?

485
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,169
Lalita's clothes could be tighter...

486
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,497
to show her titties.

487
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,267
It's as tight as can be.
Lalita is slim.

488
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,943
Not an ounce of fat.

489
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,910
You must fatten up.
The troops like meaty girls.

490
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,743
Double rations, starting today.

491
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,217
The uniforms. Do you like them?

492
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,223
Why is everything red and green?

493
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,188
The screwing, sorry...

494
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,294
the rendering cards too.

495
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,729
They're the service's colors:

496
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:43,526
Green...

497
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,264
for the beauty of the region.

498
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:49,166
Red for the ardent army men...

499
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:50,672
we help soothe.

500
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:54,835
I suggest we paint our nails green.

501
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,412
It's lovely!

502
00:31:56,547 --> 00:32:00,005
Is the lingerie red and green too?

503
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,448
Want to see?

504
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,415
There's no need.

505
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,991
Well done.

506
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,114
Dismissed.

507
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:18,429
Mr. Rodriguez!

508
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,633
I won't tolerate that.

509
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,799
Control your urges...

510
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:30,276
or I will remove you
from the service.

511
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,375
- Is that clear?
- Crystal clear, sir.

512
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,464
Don't worry. I know Chuchupe.

513
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:51,692
I assure you everything is ready
for our arrival.

514
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:53,435
It'll be fine.

515
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,764
This is the hour of truth.

516
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,875
All right, ladies.

517
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,813
We're almost there.

518
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:14,482
We're ready
for "body to body combat."

519
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,423
- How do I look?
- You are all fine.

520
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,197
In Horcones...

521
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:25,700
some twenty brave soldiers
await you.

522
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:30,067
They endure many sacrifices
for our country.

523
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,735
Some of them
haven't seen a woman for months.

524
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:35,846
This is only a trial mission...

525
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:41,316
but if it's carried out
with patriotism and resolve...

526
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:45,181
the service will cover
the whole Amazon region...

527
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:48,483
bringing happiness to our soldiers.

528
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,228
Let's hear it...

529
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,062
for the Visitors' Service...

530
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,698
and for our glorious armed forces.

531
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,441
There it is! Get ready!

532
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,809
Show those men what you can do!

533
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,108
Let's do it!

534
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,477
Until they beg for mercy!

535
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,464
Silence!

536
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,045
Come, Sandra, hurry up.

537
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,885
Iris... Iris, hurry.

538
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,920
<i>Five minutes before 1600...</i>

539
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,327
<i>the visitors occupied their sites.</i>

540
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,660
<i>Lalita and Pechuga at the depot...</i>

541
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:09,339
<i>others at the infirmary</i>
<i>and the mess hall.</i>

542
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,902
Stay back!

543
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,143
I need not remind you...

544
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,008
that these ladies must know...

545
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,584
that our country's soldiers
know how to behave as men.

546
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,420
They're all yours, sir.

547
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,085
The instructions are:

548
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:31,819
First...

549
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:36,099
each user can stay up to
twenty minutes in a site.

550
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,064
This is the maximum time allowed.

551
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:40,734
Second...

552
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:44,939
the user is entitled to
one normal rendering...

553
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:49,769
so you will leave the site
as soon as it's over.

554
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:55,118
It is forbidden, and punishable
by definitive exclusion...

555
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,851
to request of the visitor such
aberrations as:

556
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:02,582
Manual or oral masturbation,
sodomy...

557
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,091
the "black kiss"...

558
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,298
and other extravagances.

559
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,603
Finally,
those awaiting their turn...

560
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,537
will do so in complete silence
and order...

561
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,641
and not disturb the fellow in action.

562
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,145
- Understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!

563
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,246
Give the order.

564
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,977
First line, forward!

565
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,088
4 minutes, 46.

566
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,761
Next.

567
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,234
6 minutes, 11.

568
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,803
Nobody has reached
the maximum time yet.

569
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,238
These variations
are only a symptom.

570
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,844
This post is isolated, so the users...

571
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,776
have contained virility.

572
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,745
Some for months.

573
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,476
That's why they're so quick.

574
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:10,418
A record! 2 minutes, 22.
How about that?

575
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:14,024
We'll have to include abstinence...

576
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,859
in our future estimates. Yes.

577
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,259
A resounding success!

578
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:24,941
And everything went along
with order and on time.

579
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,876
Pantoja was able to save
18% of the budget...

580
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,172
allotted for the trial.

581
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,111
Post commander, Lieutenant Santana...

582
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,879
congratulates the Visitors' Service...

583
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:41,489
and requests its regular functioning.

584
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,292
Enough, Lopez. It's very clear.

585
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,356
Write:

586
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:50,656
To General Roger Scavino.
We inform you...

587
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:54,293
that the Visitors' Service
for Garrisons, Border Posts...

588
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:59,137
and Related Quarters,
is now functioning.

589
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,812
Ten thousand a week?

590
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,008
But this is a delirious
exaggeration, Pantoja!

591
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,879
No, sir. It's a proven statistic.

592
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:14,488
Look at these charts.
It's a careful...

593
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,223
if not conservative, estimate.

594
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,353
10,000 renderings...

595
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,399
cover primary
psychobiological needs.

596
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,831
To fulfill virile plenitude...

597
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,006
53,200 renderings are needed.

598
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,542
Who the hell has told you...

599
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:37,646
that virile plenitude can only
be reached by fornicating?

600
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,512
The specialists...

601
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,913
Father.

602
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,745
Call me Commander!

603
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:46,118
Excuse me, Commander.

604
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,218
I brought some documents.

605
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:53,920
They're excerpts from the works of
Sigmund Freud, Austrian.

606
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,689
Of William Steckel...

607
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,492
whose nationality was not stated...

608
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,162
of the Reader's Digest...

609
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,707
and of Carlos Seguin, our compatriot.

610
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,001
If you...

611
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:11,444
prefer books, I have them
at the Logistic Center.

612
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,443
I have been informed...

613
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,812
you give out pornography
at the camps.

614
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:20,888
At Borja garrison,
your midget assistant...

615
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,788
gave out this filth:
"Two Nights of Pleasure"...

616
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:28,695
"Maria the Tarantula,"
"Julia and the Horse"...

617
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,802
"I'm Going in There,"
"Super Ass."

618
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:32,798
True.

619
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:36,065
My assistant suggested it.

620
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:40,437
The result was a faster erection.

621
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,077
Now it's regular practice.

622
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,649
So it wasn't just once!

623
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,546
The service is giving out
pornography!

624
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:53,350
We lend it,
we can't afford to give it.

625
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,821
The result is positive.

626
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,657
A soldier that reads in line...

627
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,798
finishes three minutes earlier.

628
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,458
This allows us to reach...

629
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,729
500 weekly renderings
with five visitors.

630
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:12,240
Now I've heard everything!

631
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,469
I wish to leave, General.

632
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,646
I understand, Father.

633
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:39,896
Well-assorted for
you to pick, sir.

634
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:43,662
I only wanted ten!
I can't examine all day.

635
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:46,800
The word spread, and women...

636
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,812
sprang out of every
neighborhood.

637
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,240
It's not my fault.

638
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,815
Let's pick the five we need.

639
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:09,222
Send them in, one by one,
with their cards.

640
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,731
The Colombiana first.

641
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,237
Ok, hurry up!

642
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,569
Let's make a line.

643
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,336
Have you filled in your cards?

644
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,466
Good morning.

645
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,666
The famous "Pantyland"!

646
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,272
I couldn't picture it.

647
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,736
- The famous what?
- Pantyland.

648
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,681
That's what they call this place.

649
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,446
You will please refer to it...

650
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,781
as Logistic Center, not Pantyland.

651
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,584
Do you know why you are here?

652
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,589
Chupito told me a little.
He said...

653
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,692
you would tell me about salary...

654
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,529
and obligations.

655
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:23,299
Right. There'll be three
convoys a week...

656
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,839
and ten renderings per convoy.

657
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,736
Convoys are the trips?

658
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,210
Correct.

659
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,943
So renderings must be...

660
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:49,256
The salary is 50% of what is
discounted from soldiers...

661
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,128
the other 50% is for upkeep.

662
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:53,668
It's explained here.

663
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,068
Now...

664
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:02,110
if you don't mind,
though it may not be necessary...

665
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,246
I must follow the rules.

666
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:06,641
This way.

667
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:18,960
Here?

668
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,193
Yes.

669
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,031
Please undress.

670
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,801
I've got my period.

671
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,838
But, if you don't mind...

672
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,174
What's wrong?

673
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,681
It's only an exam of presence.

674
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:44,612
That's a steamy imagination, miss.

675
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:51,452
It did seem strange,
there isn't even a rug.

676
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,958
So...

677
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,398
do you think I'm ok?

678
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,964
I'm skinny,
but I promise to fatten up.

679
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:05,737
You're fine.

680
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,667
So you like me?

681
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,542
You passed. Get dressed.

682
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:14,541
Thank you.

683
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,385
When do I start?

684
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:19,919
Tomorrow.

685
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:24,587
Report to the dress department
for a uniform.

686
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,190
Dress department?

687
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,889
On the lower level.

688
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,527
Could you help me with
the zipper?

689
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,264
It's stuck.

690
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,722
There you go.

691
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:56,724
What? Let go!

692
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,984
What's wrong?

693
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,890
I must warn you about two things.

694
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,395
First:
You will call me "sir"...

695
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,898
as the other visitors do.

696
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:09,537
Second:
Don't ever do that again.

697
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,605
Well, you had a bulgy fly.

698
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,511
I didn't mean to offend you.

699
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:23,617
So forgive me.

700
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,049
Do you?

701
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,156
Don't let it happen again.

702
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,295
Now, please leave. I'm busy.

703
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,164
Whatever you say, sir.

704
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,315
See you tomorrow.

705
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,036
Look over there.

706
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:44,563
We're men too!

707
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,065
You keep everything!

708
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,639
We're men too!

709
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:58,373
They're locals.
They probably found out we'd pass by.

710
00:46:58,615 --> 00:47:00,378
I don't like this.

711
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:05,350
If the service goes public,
it would be our end.

712
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,989
Nobody will know.

713
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:16,729
<i>Sinchi's voice.</i>

714
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:21,402
<i>Program produced and directed</i>
<i>by yours truly...</i>

715
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:25,901
<i>German Laudano Rosales,</i>
<i>The Sinchi.</i>

716
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:31,080
Good afternoon, dear listeners.

717
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:36,914
I beg you to take your young children
away from your radio...

718
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:40,282
since my known frankness...

719
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:44,654
leaves me no choice
but to refer to the crudest facts...

720
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,887
and terms:

721
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,432
Prostitution, my dear listeners!

722
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:58,769
<i>A new system of flesh commerce...</i>

723
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:02,775
<i>through our sacred jungle rivers.</i>

724
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:06,474
<i>A mobile, motorized brothel...</i>

725
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,448
<i>called Pantyland is known to be...</i>

726
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:13,488
<i>clandestinely sending...</i>

727
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,751
<i>its sinful services</i>
<i>to our army's quarters.</i>

728
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,092
<i>So it has been informed...</i>

729
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:24,198
<i>to the office of Amazon Radio...</i>

730
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,301
<i>through letters and phone calls.</i>

731
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,938
I'm listening, Father.
We'll talk later.

732
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,905
<i>These shameless odalisques</i>
<i>have been seen...</i>

733
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:39,345
<i>navigating down</i>
<i>the region's main rivers...</i>

734
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:45,246
<i>towards the military quarters</i>
<i>and posts of the jungle.</i>

735
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,152
So, I ask:

736
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,325
Who is behind...

737
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:54,292
this industry of sin,
flourishing before the very eyes...

738
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,592
of the authorities?

739
00:48:56,733 --> 00:49:01,227
Nothing will stop our crusade
for progress...

740
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,505
morality, culture...

741
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,837
<i>and patriotism</i>
<i>of the Peruvian jungle.</i>

742
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,477
<i>The time has come...</i>

743
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,308
<i>to unmask the monster and...</i>

744
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:14,178
<i>as the apostle did</i>
<i>unto the dragon...</i>

745
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:17,719
behead it with a single stroke!

746
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,525
How was I?

747
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:28,188
Telluric, Maestro. Telluric!

748
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,142
Good morning.

749
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:49,780
Here so early?
The summon was for 9:00 a.m.

750
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,450
Excuse me, Mister Panta...

751
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:54,881
I needed to talk to you...

752
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,617
alone.

753
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,259
What about?

754
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,130
Please, don't smoke in this office.

755
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,500
Tell me.

756
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:15,702
Is there a problem?

757
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:19,881
It's you, Mister Panta.

758
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:20,842
Me?

759
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:25,186
I feel you have something
against me.

760
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:26,687
What?

761
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,983
You don't talk to me or look at me.

762
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:33,920
As if I offended you.

763
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,592
You're mistaken, miss.

764
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,062
I treat you as the other visitors.

765
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,864
I'll be blunt.

766
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,946
I think you want me
to fall for you.

767
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:56,413
What?

768
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,748
I am married, miss.

769
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,950
Like most of the men
I go to bed with.

770
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,360
It's no reason for...

771
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:09,190
It's a reason for me.
It should be for you.

772
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:12,064
You see?

773
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,096
I speak and you get skittish.

774
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,767
But, you know what?

775
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,443
I like that.

776
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,248
I'm like a crab.

777
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:31,409
I go against the flow.
So keep at it...

778
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,147
and I'll fall for you.

779
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,623
I don't advise it.

780
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:44,595
"Mixing work with pleasure is a sign
of ill proceedings."

781
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:51,068
That's kind of hard
in our line of business.

782
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,938
You know what I mean.

783
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:58,170
Don't you feel anything
when you see us naked?

784
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,279
That would be horrible.

785
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:05,477
Being clean-cut does not
mean being a fool.

786
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,819
I love it when you get angry...

787
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,486
you're so cute.

788
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,833
Here, dry off.

789
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:21,662
Thank you.

790
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,633
I don't think you are a fool.

791
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,314
But you like me
and won't accept it.

792
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:47,024
You are a very attractive woman.

793
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,666
I'm not indifferent to your charms...

794
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,663
but it's impossible.

795
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:57,135
Not even once?

796
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,501
Out of curiosity?

797
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,412
- You could order me...
- No I can't.

798
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:07,116
It would be an abuse of authority.

799
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,210
It's perfectly ok.

800
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:15,583
You should try your goods.

801
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,626
It would be like...

802
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:22,095
a quality test.

803
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:27,527
Please...

804
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,000
leave.

805
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,574
We won't discuss this again.

806
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,257
They've told you bad things
about me...

807
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,018
and you're scared.

808
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,021
But I'm not like you think.

809
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:10,743
I'd love to spend more time with you!

810
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:14,940
To send for our little cadet!
All day, every day!

811
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,777
Don't you like it?

812
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,578
Panta, please!

813
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:21,416
Forgive me.
I love your neck!

814
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:26,591
I know what's in store for me.

815
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:29,596
What is it?

816
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:38,067
Don't tell me you're
a Peeping Tom now. Pervert!

817
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:39,900
Keep walking.

818
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,737
How can they do that in public?

819
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:48,909
Come in.

820
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,621
You sent for me?

821
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:56,982
Take a seat, miss.

822
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:11,967
I sent for you to refresh
your memory about regulations.

823
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:15,874
Here is a copy.
Clarify your doubts...

824
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,370
and feel free to ask.

825
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,484
Are you angry?

826
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:26,521
You dare to ask me that,
after the show...

827
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,453
you put on in public?

828
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:31,688
Now I get it.

829
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:36,054
This is about yesterday.

830
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,000
Are you jealous?

831
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,603
A visitor is not a whore...

832
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:44,571
but yesterday,
you behaved like a whore.

833
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:48,075
Regulations don't prohibit friends.

834
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,839
That's quite an obscene friend.

835
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:54,312
You are to stop seeing that man.

836
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:55,881
Thank you.

837
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:58,152
He's not just a man.

838
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,515
His name is Nicolas.

839
00:56:01,925 --> 00:56:04,052
And he wants to marry me.

840
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,200
If that is what you wish...

841
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:20,409
But please, think it over.

842
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,714
I remind you that, if you marry...

843
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:26,748
you'll have to leave the service.

844
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,575
We don't admit married women.

845
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,581
He wants to get married.

846
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:41,123
I just want a little
care and protection.

847
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:46,235
Don't I have that right?

848
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:48,200
I guess so...

849
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:50,967
Forgive me.

850
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,640
I have been unjust.

851
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:56,878
Don't worry...
I'm used to it.

852
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:58,171
Olga...

853
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:05,279
You are a strange person.
I don't understand you.

854
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,483
You should do something else.

855
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,252
You too.

856
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,987
This job doesn't become you.

857
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:19,529
You don't even try your own visitors.

858
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:24,303
Excuse me.

859
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,777
Miss... Wait.

860
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:31,736
Yes?

861
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:32,980
Are you...

862
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,676
still willing to volunteer...

863
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,888
to carry out a quality test?

864
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:42,815
Yes. Of course.

865
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,996
I must inform you that this test...

866
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,123
will only be done once...

867
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:54,859
will be secret,
and is strictly work-related.

868
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,272
Make no mistake, Olga...

869
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:03,010
the only motive that moves me
to perform this test...

870
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,647
is to verify
and perfect the service...

871
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:29,467
- One, Pechuga.
- Two, Sandra.

872
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,799
- Three, Iris.
- Four, Lalita.

873
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:33,838
- Five, Vanessa.
- Six, Colombiana.

874
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,977
- Seven, Coca.
- Eight, Salome.

875
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,407
- Nine, Pichuza.
- Ten, Peludita.

876
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,479
In flesh and blood.
