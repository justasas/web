1
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:13,343
When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight

2
00:00:13,343 --> 00:00:19,261
If you need help, if you need help.
I'll shut down the city lights,

3
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:25,465
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe
To make you well, to make you well.

4
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:29,546
When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war

5
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:35,422
If you need help, if you need help.
Your hope dangling by a string

6
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:41,433
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well.

7
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:50,153
Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me.

8
00:00:50,153 --> 00:00:57,600
And I would do it for you, for you.
Baby, I'm not moving on

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,511
I love you long after you're gone.
For you, for you.

10
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:07,783
You would never sleep alone.
I love you long after you're gone

11
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:11,589
And long after you're gone, gone, gone.

12
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:17,926
When you fall like a statue
I'm gon' be there to catch you

13
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:23,929
Put you on your feet, you on your feet.
And if your well is empty

14
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:30,213
Not a thing will prevent me.
Tell me what you need, what do you need?

15
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:39,079
I surrender honestly.
You've always done the same for me.

16
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:46,382
So I would do it for you, for you.
Baby, I'm not moving on,

17
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:52,374
I love you long after you're gone.
For you, for you.

18
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:56,968
You would never sleep alone.
I love you long after you're gone

19
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,240
And long after you're gone, gone, gone.

20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,594
You're my back bone.
You're my cornerstone.

21
00:02:03,594 --> 00:02:09,649
You're my crutch when my legs stop moving.
You're my head start.

22
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:15,728
You're my rugged heart.
You're the pulse that I've always needed.

23
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:23,866
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.

24
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:31,249
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.
Like a drum my heart never stops beating...

25
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:37,145
For you, for you.
Baby, I'm not moving on.

26
00:02:37,145 --> 00:02:43,081
I love you long after you're gone.
For you, for you.

27
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:47,633
You would never sleep alone.
I love you long after you're gone.

28
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:53,422
For you, for you.
Baby, I'm not moving on,

29
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:59,400
I love you long after you're gone.
For you, for you.

30
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,915
You would never sleep alone.
I love you long, long after you're gone.

31
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:12,646
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.

32
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:22,431
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating.
Like a drum my heart never stops beating for you.

33
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:31,885
And long after you're gone, gone, gone.
I love you long after you're gone, gone, gone.
