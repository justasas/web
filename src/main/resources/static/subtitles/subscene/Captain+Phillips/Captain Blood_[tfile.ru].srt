 

1
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:32,999
Dr. Blood!

2
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,196
Who is it?

3
00:02:37,584 --> 00:02:40,234
That we'll know better
when you've opened the door.

4
00:02:40,304 --> 00:02:41,613
Me?

5
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,546
My mistake. After I've opened the door.

6
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,585
Open it, quick!

7
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:53,197
Why, Jeremy Pitt, isn't it?

8
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:56,907
It's your friend, Lord Gildoy, wounded
at Andrew Baynes' farm by the river.

9
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,429
-The rash fool.
-He sent me for you. No time to lose.

10
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:02,471
Why, to be sure, I'll lose none,
nor my head either.

11
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,518
Come in and regain yours
while I get my things.

12
00:03:04,591 --> 00:03:06,501
-I'll wait here.
-As you please.

13
00:03:06,575 --> 00:03:08,583
Come, Mrs. Barlow, help me dress.

14
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:13,769
Jeremy, how was the battle?

15
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,847
Battle? Slaughter, rather!

16
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,861
What can clubs do against cannon?

17
00:03:17,935 --> 00:03:22,507
In case this business keeps me overlong,
take care you water my geraniums...

18
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:24,517
especially those
under the bedroom window.

19
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:26,446
Geraniums. Won't you ever grow up?

20
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:29,194
One would think you were still
at medical school.

21
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,926
Geraniums!

22
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:32,748
You would think of geraniums...

23
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:35,271
when every other able-bodied man
is out fighting.

24
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:38,507
It's out of favor I seem to be with you,
my vinegary virgin.

25
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,221
-Half the town is saying you're a papist.
-Why?

26
00:03:41,296 --> 00:03:44,645
Because I have the sense to sleep tonight
instead of rushing to my ruin...

27
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,207
in an attempt to put
this Duke of Monmouth on the throne?

28
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,200
He'd be even worse than King James.

29
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,308
Make haste with that cloak there,
my pretty one.

30
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,480
And the other half of the town
that defends you...

31
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:55,820
claims that you're just a coward.

32
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,309
Mrs. Barlow, my darling,
you can tell them, if you like...

33
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,590
that I've been most anywhere
that fighting was in evidence.

34
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:05,804
Fought for the French against the Spanish,
and the Spanish against the French...

35
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,424
and I learned my seamanship
in the Dutch Navy.

36
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:12,391
But having had adventure enough
in six years to last me six lives...

37
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:15,879
I came here, hung up the sword,
and picked up the lancet.

38
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,293
Became a man of peace and not of war.
A healer, not a slayer...

39
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:24,164
and that I am going to be as long as
I'm on top of the sod and not under it.

40
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:34,727
-Will you be back for breakfast?
-Who knows, my pretty one?

41
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:49,191
The worst is done, my friend.
Give your mind peace.

42
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:13,452
The King's men!

43
00:05:14,576 --> 00:05:17,871
There's nothing to fear.
This is a Christian country.

44
00:05:17,935 --> 00:05:20,750
Christian men don't make war
on the wounded...

45
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:22,473
or those who shelter them.

46
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:32,138
I'm Capt. Hobart of Col. Kirke's dragoons.

47
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,768
What rebels do you harbor?

48
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,872
No rebels. This wounded gentleman--

49
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:38,766
No need to ask
how he came by his wounds.

50
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:40,718
A rebel. Out with him.

51
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:46,190
This man can't be moved
without peril to his life.

52
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:49,605
Who the devil may you be?

53
00:05:50,287 --> 00:05:51,913
Peter Blood, Medicinae Baccalaureus.

54
00:05:51,983 --> 00:05:53,543
Don't fling your French at me.

55
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:55,688
Latin, my dull friend.
lt means I'm a doctor.

56
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,384
Or a liar.

57
00:05:57,455 --> 00:06:01,197
lf your wit were as big as your voice,
it's the great man you'd be for this.

58
00:06:01,263 --> 00:06:03,881
You may find me great enough
to hang you!

59
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,541
Yes, I don't doubt it.

60
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:09,226
You've the looks and manners
of a hangman.

61
00:06:09,296 --> 00:06:11,335
Take him away, and the others, too!

62
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:44,111
''ln the name of His Majesty,
Our Sovereign Lord...

63
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:47,623
''prisoners of the Crown,
you stand indicted...

64
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:49,703
''for having maliciously
and traitorously conspired...

00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:53,353

66
00:06:53,423 --> 00:06:55,398
''of this Kingdom of England.

67
00:06:55,471 --> 00:06:57,675
''Therefore, you are charged

68
00:06:57,743 --> 00:07:00,165
''against the most illustrious

00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:03,108
''Prince James II by the grace of God...

00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:08,651
''Having no fear of God in your hearts...

00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,108
''and being moved

''you have failed in the love

74
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:17,289
''and have moved to disturb

75

77
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,847
''Therefore, you are here to be tried

79
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:35,147
''and by a jury of 12 good men and true.''

80
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:41,224
James Haynsworth, hold up your hand.

81
00:07:41,647 --> 00:07:43,884
-Guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

82
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:47,431
-Harold Carron, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

83
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:51,813
-Andrew Baynes, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

84
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,141
-Jeremy Pitt, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

85
00:07:56,207 --> 00:08:00,942
-John Wolverstone, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

86
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,933
Uriah Ogle, guilty or not guilty?

87
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,140
Guilty. Praise the Lord.

88
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,731
Henry Hagthorpe, guilty or not guilty?

89
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,356
Guilty.

90
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:17,187
-Lord Chester Dyke, guilty or not guilty?
-Guilty.

91
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:21,163
Peter Blood, guilty or not guilty?

92
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,500
lt's entirely innocent, I am.

93
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:27,176
Take the stand and face His Lordship.

94
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:33,165
Are you guilty or not guilty?
You must use the right words.

95
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,875
Words, is it? Not guilty.

96
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,650
And speaking of words,
I'd like to say a few about the injustice...

97
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:43,917
of keeping an innocent man
locked up for three months...

98
00:08:43,983 --> 00:08:48,391
in such filth and heat and ill-feeding
that my chief regret is I didn't try...

99
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:50,950
to pull down the filthy fellow
that sits on the throne.

100
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,267
Silence!

101
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:55,816
Are you entirely ignorant
of the proper procedure of the court?

102
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:57,774
Most happily ignorant up to now.

103
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,430
I could gladly have done
without this acquaintance.

104
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:01,900
Enough of this.

105
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:06,251
There is nothing more to be said,
except the passing of sentence.

106
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:09,253
May it please Your Lordship,
but there's a deal more to be said!

107
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:10,756
Silence!

108
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:14,410
-How now, fellow?
-There is the little matter of my defense.

109
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:16,617
Very well, then...

110
00:09:16,975 --> 00:09:19,430
but in heaven's name, be brief, man.

111
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:21,577
We have much to do.

112
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:25,190
I am guilty of nothing, my lord...

113
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:28,205
unless it be adjudged a crime
that a man try to live peaceably.

114
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:30,889
Living peaceably
with the army of Monmouth?

115
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,640
I was not with Monmouth's army, my lord.

116
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,753
I was arrested while engaging
in my profession as physician.

117
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:39,303
What's this?
You tell us you're a doctor, you rogue?

118
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:42,508
And as such was summoned
to the aid of Lord Gildoy...

119
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:45,608
by Jeremy Pitt, who can so testify.

120
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,494
Master Pitt will testify.

121
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,893
He that is himself a confessed traitor.

122
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,345
-ls that your witness?
-There is also Andrew Baynes.

123
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:57,164
Master Baynes
will have enough testifying...

124
00:09:57,231 --> 00:10:00,427
in a useless effort
to keep his own neck from the halter.

125
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:03,245
I can bring a hundred from Bridgwater,
the town where I live.

126
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,318
We've no time for all this.

127
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:08,522
lf these other traitors
are as stubborn as you...

128
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,111
I may sit here till the next assizes.

129
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,389
Very well, then.

130
00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:16,172
There's a witness I'll give you
that you can't deny:

131
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:17,733
yourself, sir.

132
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:21,484
For if I'm not physician,
how is it I know that you're a dying man?

133
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:29,933
The death to which you're dooming
hundreds of poor men daily...

134
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:33,927
in a frantic effort to send their souls
to perdition before your own...

135
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,821
is a light pleasantry...

136
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:38,250
compared to the bleeding death
in the lungs...

137
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,681
to which the great Judge
has condemned you.

138
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:44,645
Now, fellow,
we'll be done with the witnesses...

139
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:47,817
and I will convict you
out of your own rascally mouth.

140
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:52,742
When this Pitt came to summon you,
as you claim...

141
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:55,564
did you know you were called
to attend another rebel?

142
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,216
My business was with his wounds,
not his politics.

143
00:10:58,287 --> 00:11:00,109
Did you know the law...

144
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:03,883
that any person who does
knowingly receive, harbor, comfort...

145
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:08,653
or succor a rebel
is as guilty as if he himself bore arms?

146
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:11,435
I only knew my sacred duty as a physician.

147
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:15,307
Your sacred duty, rogue, is to your king!

148
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:21,805
I thought it was to my fellow man.

149
00:11:28,174 --> 00:11:31,753
lt's a fearful thing
to send a man's soul to perdition...

150
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:34,958
but I am bound by my conscience...

151
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,219
and my love of my king to deal out justice.

152
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:47,747
Therefore, I instruct you,
gentlemen of the jury...

153
00:11:48,655 --> 00:11:51,240
that inasmuch as Peter Blood
has admitted...

154
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,645
aiding a traitor to your king...

155
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:56,394
you do bring in a verdict of guilty...

156
00:11:56,462 --> 00:11:58,567
that he may be hanged...

157
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:01,191
for the high treason he has committed.

158
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,892
What a creature must sit on the throne...

159
00:12:09,967 --> 00:12:12,836
who lets a man like you
deal out his justice.

160
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:21,709
-Your Majesty.
-Sunderland, what brings you here?

161
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,597
These numerous hangings.

162
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:26,924
Splendid, aren't they?
We kill the rebels, we kill the rebellion.

163
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,551
Very true, Your Majesty...

164
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,859
but a foolish waste
of valuable human flesh.

165
00:12:30,926 --> 00:12:31,908
How so?

166
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:36,613
Your Majesty's colonies in the West Indies
are urgently in need of slaves.

167
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:41,450
A healthy, vigorous man
can be reckoned worth from £10 to £20.

168
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,908
Splendid, Sunderland.

169
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,700
Send out word immediately that the King
is graciously pleased to command...

170
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,130
that all rebels convicted
but not yet hanged...

171
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,363
be gathered together...

172
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:55,846
and shipped by the first available boats
to the Americas.

173
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:23,436
Give us water!
There are men dying down here.

174
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:44,233
You'd think they'd take better care
of a valuable cargo like us.

175
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,925
Ahoy, the deck! Land sighted, Port Royal!

176
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:18,860
lt's a truly royal clemency we're granted,
my friends...

177
00:14:18,511 --> 00:14:21,194
one well worthy of King James.

178
00:14:22,638 --> 00:14:27,790
He spares us the mercifully quick
extinction of the hangman's rope...

179
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:29,353
and gives the slow death of slavery.

180
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,957
He grants us our lives
in exchange for a living death.

181
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:40,454
lt's an uncertain world entirely.

182
00:14:54,991 --> 00:14:58,122
''Be it known, men, that these prisoners
who stand before you...

183
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,908
''are now to be sold at a right
and fitting price.

184
00:15:00,975 --> 00:15:03,342
''They may be put to labor
in the sulfur mines...

185
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:05,709
''or on the plantations
for a period of 10 years.

186
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,630
''And the parties
to whom they are assigned...

187
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:09,964
''must enter into security
for the proper punishment...

188
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,120
''of their offense.''

189
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,909
His Excellency, the Governor of Port Royal.

190
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:15,876
Guards, attention! Present muskets.

191
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:19,435
Good day, Captain. Lovely day, isn't it?
Or is it?

192
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:23,143
-Good day, Dixon.
-Good day, Governor.

193
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,965
I suppose we can begin this sale now,
Governor.

194
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,886
No, better wait for Col. Bishop.

195
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:30,798
He has the privilege
of being late for everything.

196
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:32,553
Yes, I know.

197
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:33,964
There he is.

198
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,328
-Good afternoon, Col. Bishop.
-Good afternoon, Governor.

199
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:49,827
Good afternoon, Miss Arabella.

200
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:51,844
How is my darling, the Governor,
and his foot?

201
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,504
Every day I think my gout
can't get any worse...

202
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:56,517
and every day it does.

203
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,622
My dear Colonel,
according to the King's request...

204
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:03,307
it is for you to take first choice
of this dainty nosegay...

205
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:06,730
and at your own price.

206
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:08,973
Egad, they're an appalling lot...

207
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,111
not likely to be of much value
on the plantation.

208
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:12,841
The less you want, the more for Dixon.

209
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:15,725
-Dixon? Uncle, I wish you'd buy them all.
-Buy them all?

210
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,514
To keep them out of Dixon's hands.

211
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:20,451
I perceive somebody's been talking
behind my back...

212
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:21,901
telling the truth.

213
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:24,836
-And you can joke.
-Arabella dear, don't be childish.

214
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,114
These men are rebels against their king.

215
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:29,400
They should be hanged, drawn,
and quartered.

216
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,853
-Any fate they meet is too good for them.
-Your uncle is right.

217
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,308
-Let the sale commence.
-My foot!

218
00:16:34,383 --> 00:16:38,157
My dear, the law is the law,
and it's His Majesty's law...

219
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:39,912
and must be obeyed.

220
00:16:41,454 --> 00:16:43,145
The best of the lot.

221
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:46,253
Open your mouth.

222
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,277
-£20.
-Sold!

223
00:16:51,342 --> 00:16:53,709
Sold to Col. Bishop for £20.

224
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,883
-As if he were buying horses.
-Yes, quite.

225
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:13,510
-Same price.
-This is Jeremy Pitt, ship's pilot...

226
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:15,175
young and sturdy.

227
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,424
-Same price.
-Sold!

228
00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:22,567
Sold to Col. Bishop for £20.

229
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:33,287
Quiet!

230
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:37,643
Open your mouth.

231
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:57,996
His pride has bought him a ticket
to Dixon's mines.

232
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:01,330
He isn't there yet.

233
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:05,836
-My dear, consider your social position!
-Uncle!

234
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,485
-Which one?
-That one.

235
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:16,581
-Him? I will not.
-But I want you to.

236
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:20,102
No. Let him cool his head
in Dixon's mines. I'll have none of him.

237
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,956
-£5.
-£5? That's an insulting sum to offer.

238
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,325
-Does anyone offer more?
-£6.

239
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:33,924
£7.

240
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:35,787
You're making an exhibition of yourself...

241
00:18:35,854 --> 00:18:38,440
a girl like you,
bidding for a slave before these people.

242
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,852
-Will you buy him?
-Certainly not.

243
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,310
£8.

244
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:47,117
When a lady's interested in a man....

245
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:49,572
Calm down, Dixon,
£8 is nothing for such a man...

246
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,806
a skilled physician,
a gentleman, and a scholar.

247
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:56,554
-All right, £9.
-£10!

248
00:18:58,382 --> 00:19:00,749
lt's apparent Miss Bishop wants him
more than I do.

249
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:02,986
Sold to Miss Arabella Bishop for £10.

250
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,111
Sold!

251
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,387
£10, sold.

252
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:12,774
What would you like done with him,
Miss Bishop?

253
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:15,400
Why, I don't know.

254
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:21,893
You're extremely foolish.
lt might have cost you your life.

255
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,909
lt was fortunate for you
that I was here to save you.

256
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,162
I hardly consider it fortunate to be bought
by anyone by the name of Bishop.

257
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,262
You could learn a lesson in gratitude.

258
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,406
I could thank for not interfering.

259
00:19:34,735 --> 00:19:38,412
As it happens, you are hardly in a position
to have anything to say about it.

260
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,617
You may join the others belonging
to my uncle...

261
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:43,720
and henceforth you may take your orders
from him.

262
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,620
Your very humble slave, Miss Bishop.

263
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:11,338
Come on. Move on, there.

264
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:08,589
Last night, this dog attempted to escape.

265
00:21:09,263 --> 00:21:11,532
Today you'll see what happens
to those who forget...

266
00:21:11,598 --> 00:21:14,762
that my friend King James
did you all a favor...

267
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,513
in saving you from your just fate
on the gallows.

268
00:21:17,582 --> 00:21:19,492
Show them the iron, Kent.

269
00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:29,353
F-T.

270
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,508
Whoever wears that brand
is known as a fugitive traitor...

271
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:35,305
and will be treated as such.

272
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,863
Burn those letters in your brain...

273
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,588
lest they be burned on your hides, too.

274
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:45,386
There speaks a fit friend for King James
if ever I heard one.

275
00:21:46,286 --> 00:21:49,832
Would I had him and his friend James
roasting on a spit over that fire.

276
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:54,924
Great would be the burning thereof
and loud the rejoicing in Heaven.

277
00:21:56,238 --> 00:21:57,645
Do your duty!

278
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,955
What a cruel shame
that any man is made to suffer so.

279
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,744
-This beastly gout!
-Perhaps a new dressing will help.

280
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:21,795
Perhaps.

281
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:23,529
-I have it here.
-Put it down.

282
00:22:23,598 --> 00:22:24,874
So sorry, Doctor.

283
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:26,731
Easy, you clumsy louts!

284
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,147
-We won't hurt you, Governor.
-You thick-fingered jackasses!

285
00:22:30,574 --> 00:22:32,396
His Excellency will have his little joke.

286
00:22:32,462 --> 00:22:34,633
lll-begotten bunglers!

287
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:37,124
-Blundering pill peddlers!
-Your Excellency--

288
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:39,651
That is the final straw.

289
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:44,743
Out of this house...

290
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:46,822
and never let me see your faces again.

291
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:49,228
-But think of our reputations.
-Hang your reputations!

292
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:51,683
Leave me! I don't want to see you again!

293
00:22:51,758 --> 00:22:53,863
Away! Out!

294
00:22:53,934 --> 00:22:56,203
I don't want to see you!
Out into the streets!

295
00:22:57,295 --> 00:23:00,164
Stop shouting.
You brought on my headache again.

296
00:23:00,238 --> 00:23:02,409
Good! Hannibal, come take my crutch.

297
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:05,388
Easy, now. Help me up with my foot.

298
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:07,145
No remedy. Why, thank you, dear.

299
00:23:12,686 --> 00:23:14,923
Why doesn't His Excellency
try another doctor?

300
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,135
Another doctor?

301
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:18,508
There are only those two
on this wretched island...

302
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:21,192
-and each one is worse than his partner.
-There is another.

303
00:23:21,262 --> 00:23:24,491
And according to what I've heard,
he became a slave by being a doctor.

304
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:25,900
A slave?

305
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:29,512
Would you elevate a slave
to the position of doctor to the Governor?

306
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:33,191
-ls he a good doctor?
-I don't know.

307
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,331
Why are you laughing?

308
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:42,510
I'm just thinking how annoyed
Peter Blood would be...

309
00:23:42,574 --> 00:23:44,429
if I did him another favor.

310
00:23:47,182 --> 00:23:50,444
Your Excellency, there are diverse citizens
of this sovereign island...

311
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,365
who come before you with complaints.

312
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,339
Complaints, complaints.

313
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:58,300
Can none of my citizens
follow the example of their governor...

314
00:23:58,254 --> 00:24:01,385
who endures the utmost agony
without a murmur?

315
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,511
-Easy there, fellow.
-Did I hurt you, sir?

316
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:08,102
No, but I thought you were going to.

317
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,877
Your Excellency,
this vagrant hides his sins...

318
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,957
behind the name of Honesty Nuttall.

319
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,805
-He's charged with being in debt.
-State your case, fellow, and no lies.

320
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,107
I was on the way to pay the butcher
on Tuesday...

321
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:23,752
as Honesty Nuttall is my name,
when I chanced on a poor old beggar.

322
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:25,251
lt was Jones from the grog shop...

323
00:24:25,326 --> 00:24:27,301
who begged me to have a drink with him.

324
00:24:27,374 --> 00:24:29,284
Try standing on it, Your Honor.

325
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,194
Stand on that bundle of pain? Impossible.

326
00:24:33,454 --> 00:24:36,934
I remembered in time my poor
starving wife in need of the five bob.

327
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,618
What is this all about? Silence!

328
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,332
-Sit down.
-What's he here for?

329
00:24:43,406 --> 00:24:45,707
For debt, Your Excellency,
and the prevaricator--

330
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:49,222
lf it's for debt,
don't annoy me with such petty things.

331
00:24:49,294 --> 00:24:51,116
Order him to work it off.

332
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:54,215
Work? Not that, anything but work.

333
00:24:54,286 --> 00:24:55,530
What's your trade?

334
00:24:55,598 --> 00:24:58,762
I'm a ship's carpenter
when the painful necessity arises.

335
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,235
Take him to work on the docks...

336
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:03,520
and don't you attempt to escape
till every farthing's paid...

337
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:05,270
or I'll stretch your hide on the rack!

338
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:07,404
Escape? How could a debtor escape
from this island...

339
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,739
even if he had a boat to do it with?

340
00:25:09,806 --> 00:25:12,654
I couldn't escape any more
than a slave could escape.

341
00:25:14,478 --> 00:25:16,682
I can walk.

342
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:18,600
Wonderful, my dear fellow.

343
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:21,517
Only two months' treatment,
and I'm a well man.

344
00:25:21,582 --> 00:25:23,760
lt's a miracle.

345
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,791
-The next complaint--
-Drat the next complaint. I can walk.

346
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:28,323
Come, Doctor.

347
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:31,432
You'll get your reward for this,
Peter Blood.

348
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:35,146
-From now on, you're my physician.
-Your Excellency is too kind.

349
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:38,247
Come back early tomorrow.
You're always welcome, Dr. Blood.

350
00:25:59,822 --> 00:26:00,771
Hello.

351
00:26:13,262 --> 00:26:14,756
Don't I know you?

352
00:26:15,438 --> 00:26:17,543
A lady should know her own property.

353
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,162
-My property?
-Let me refresh your memory.

354
00:26:21,358 --> 00:26:24,522
My name is Peter Blood,
and I'm worth precisely £10.

355
00:26:25,774 --> 00:26:28,840
Forgive me for not recognizing you,
Dr. Blood.

356
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,600
You're so changed...

357
00:26:31,118 --> 00:26:32,231
for the better.

358
00:26:33,262 --> 00:26:35,433
The Governor tells me
I have you to thank for that.

359
00:26:35,502 --> 00:26:37,673
You don't sound very grateful, Dr. Blood.

360
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:41,767
Do you think I'd be grateful for an easy life
when my friends are treated like animals?

361
00:26:41,838 --> 00:26:45,253
lt's they deserve your favors, not I.
They're all honest rebels.

362
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:48,260
I was snoring in my bed
while they were trying to free England...

363
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:49,894
from an unclean tyrant.

364
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,168
I believe you're talking treason.

365
00:26:52,397 --> 00:26:54,186
I hope I'm not obscure.

366
00:26:54,254 --> 00:26:56,327
-You could be flogged for that.
-No.

367
00:26:57,134 --> 00:26:59,884
The Governor would never allow it.
He has the gout.

368
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,507
You depend upon that?

369
00:27:01,678 --> 00:27:05,573
I intend to, for all it's worth,
and that promises to be considerable.

370
00:27:07,886 --> 00:27:11,498
But you'd hardly know about that.
You've probably never had the gout.

371
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,191
-Good afternoon, Miss Bishop.
-Good afternoon.

372
00:27:46,926 --> 00:27:51,203
15-2, 15-4, and a pair are six.

373
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:53,861
-Another?
-What else is there to do...

374
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:57,660
ever since you ruined the Governor's foot
and our reputations with it?

375
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,647
-I ruined the Governor's foot?
-I tell you, Doctor, you're methods are--

376
00:28:00,718 --> 00:28:02,376
-Someone coming.
-A patient?

377
00:28:02,446 --> 00:28:03,591
A patient!

378
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:09,548
-I beg your pardon, Doctor. I'm so sorry.
-lt's all right.

379
00:28:13,997 --> 00:28:15,339
Come in.

380
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,764
Good afternoon, colleagues. Dr. Bronson.

381
00:28:20,973 --> 00:28:23,624
-Dr. Whacker.
-Good afternoon.

382
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:25,994
How's business, my friends?

383
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,440
-Terrible.
-Good.

384
00:28:27,118 --> 00:28:29,485
-Terribly good.
-That relieves me.

385
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:31,915
I had heard that things
were not altogether....

386
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:34,381
ldle gossip, obviously.

387
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:36,808
You intend to remain here?

388
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:40,585
Remain here? Why not?

389
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:43,725
lt's queer.

390
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:47,498
There are you, free to come and go as
you please, and you choose to stay here.

391
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:51,843
While I, who hate this pestilential island....
Such are the quirks of circumstance.

392
00:28:52,622 --> 00:28:55,110
I must be running along, gentlemen.

393
00:28:55,598 --> 00:28:57,321
Good day, gentlemen.

394
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,856
lt's pleasant to see
everything so prosperous with you here.

395
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:05,706
-Not so hasty.
-Just a moment.

396
00:29:05,774 --> 00:29:08,425
There's something I'd like to ask you.

397
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,510
Well, gentlemen?

398
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:12,678
Have you been thinking of leaving us,
Doctor?

399
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:16,139
Leaving? Now, Doctor.

400
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,285
How could a slave think of leaving?

401
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:22,627
Or even if he were fool enough to try,
by what means could he hope to escape?

402
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:26,250
And where, for example,
could he raise the few pounds necessary...

403
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,647
to purchase even a small boat?

404
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:31,653
-We might supply it.
-You?

405
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,815
-Now, gentlemen.
-Now, let's talk this thing over.

406
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:39,830
Now, if you'll just sit down here.

407
00:29:39,214 --> 00:29:41,865
Now then, how much will you need?

408
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:45,546
£20 might buy a small wherry,
£10 more might equip it.

409
00:29:45,614 --> 00:29:47,210
He's right.

410
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,801
-He means--
-You needn't tell me what he means.

411
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,837
I know two Christian gentlemen
when I see them.

412
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:57,287
Two men whose hearts are bleeding
for a brother doctor in distress.

413
00:29:59,182 --> 00:30:02,182
But it's too much to ask,
too noble a gesture to hope for.

414
00:30:02,254 --> 00:30:04,675
No, my good man, not at all.

415
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:06,340
But who would buy the boat?

416
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:09,763
We would not dare,
and you, a slave, you could not.

417
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,818
True.

418
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,306
That would be my part. To find someone.
A man as eager to escape as I.

419
00:30:15,854 --> 00:30:19,149
-A man held here for debt, say.
-Then it's a bargain?

420
00:30:20,173 --> 00:30:23,883
Gentlemen,
you've opened for me the gates of hope.

421
00:30:25,902 --> 00:30:26,850
Doctor.

422
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:33,961
-My dear colleague.
-Gentlemen.

423
00:30:38,926 --> 00:30:40,710
Now we have him.

424
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:43,440
We've only to get him involved
and reveal his plan.

425
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:46,249
He'll steal very little of our business
when he's in irons.

426
00:30:47,694 --> 00:30:49,300
Gentlemen.

427
00:30:50,989 --> 00:30:54,550
There's one thing slipped
my mind entirely.

428
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,723
Simple-minded men might think this
an opportunity for trickery...

429
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:02,733
but brilliant men like yourselves
will remember in what favor I stand...

430
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,646
with the Governor
in contrast to some others...

431
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,874
and how little their words
would weigh against mine.

432
00:31:08,942 --> 00:31:11,909
Heigh-ho for the Governor's foot!

433
00:31:11,982 --> 00:31:13,575
Good day, gentlemen.

434
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,130
-Are you all with me?
-Yes.

435
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,100
Listen.

436
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:51,240
There's a man named Nuttall
who's in trouble with the Governor.

437
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,797
He's looking for a small boat
which he'll purchase...

438
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,277
on the night chosen for our escape.

439
00:31:55,342 --> 00:31:56,836
-Escape?
-Quiet!

440
00:31:58,862 --> 00:32:02,473
While he gathers stores and equipment,
we must be ready on the inside.

441
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,282
We might steal some sugarcane knives
and hack through the stockade walls.

442
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,757
Or dig our way under.

443
00:32:07,822 --> 00:32:11,651
Once at sea, if we get there,
our troubles will have just begun.

444
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:13,700
lf any of you want to withdraw,
now's the time.

445
00:32:13,774 --> 00:32:15,148
-No.
-Not me.

446
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:18,956
You'll be a lubber crew, but I'll match
your hearts against any other.

447
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:22,550
We can thank our stars for Jeremy Pitt.
He was a ship's pilot.

448
00:32:22,126 --> 00:32:25,901
Here's one you won't have to teach.
Six years in King James' Navy.

449
00:32:25,998 --> 00:32:29,958
-What?
-That's nothing. I was a blooming gunner.

450
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,450
-A gunner?
-ln the King's Navy, too.

451
00:32:32,526 --> 00:32:34,500
I was always ashamed of it up to now.

452
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:36,390
We'll have a crew yet!

453
00:32:36,462 --> 00:32:39,309
Any of you others
been keeping such secrets?

454
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,828
Where's Baynes?

455
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:45,739
-Where is he?
-He tried to escape today.

456
00:32:45,902 --> 00:32:47,974
No! Caught?

457
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:51,309
-Branded?
-Yeah.

458
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:05,602
No!

459
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,652
Why did you do it, Andy?

460
00:33:11,853 --> 00:33:14,155
I told you I'd try to get you out.

461
00:33:14,221 --> 00:33:17,352
I couldn't stand it any longer.
I couldn't stand it.

462
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:20,100
I was going mad.
What do you think a man is made of?

463
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,142
How much do you think he can stand?

464
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,220
''Watchman, what of the night?''
lsaiah 21 :1 1 .

465
00:33:54,445 --> 00:33:56,714
Don't make the purchase
until well on in the evening.

466
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:58,276
That way there'll be less risk...

467
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:00,389
of anyone wondering where you came by
the money.

468
00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:03,777
Lumme, Captain.
lt ain't too late for us to change our minds.

469
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:06,242
Stow the provisions away on board
as soon as it's dark.

470
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:09,000
Then all you've got to do is sit down here
and wait for us.

471
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,557
ls that all?
Wait all alone in the blooming dark...

472
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:14,840
waiting for someone to come along
and nab me.

473
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:17,513
Nuttall, my lad,
there's just one other little thing.

474
00:34:17,581 --> 00:34:21,956
Could you find me a good piece of timber
about so thick and so long?

475
00:34:22,157 --> 00:34:23,205
Yes, I think so.

476
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:25,863
Then do so and lash it to your spine.
lt needs stiffening.

477
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,788
Courage. I'll join you at midnight.

478
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:42,948
How long does it take to feed
this pack of dogs?

479
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:46,283
lt's a wonder we make a profit at all.
You don't drive them hard enough.

480
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:48,105
Get them out of here!

481
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:03,137
I've just been with Nuttall at the boat.
lt's tonight.

482
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,276
-At last!
-For heaven's sake, command yourself.

483
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:09,926
-Tonight, Hagthorpe.
-Caution above everything.

484
00:35:09,997 --> 00:35:12,386
He who goes slowly, goes safely.

485
00:35:14,189 --> 00:35:17,418
Remember, Jeremy,
you're the only navigator among us.

486
00:35:17,486 --> 00:35:19,689
Without you, there's no escape.

487
00:35:23,885 --> 00:35:25,347
Hello, Uncle!

488
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:28,100
Riding again? What do you plan to see
riding always the same road?

489
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,779
You'd be surprised what interesting things
there are to see on this island...

490
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:34,340
if you only keep your eyes open.

491
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:38,472
Today, for instance, I saw something
that you'd give 1,000 ducats to know.

492
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,721
Stores and equipment
are all stowed away onboard.

493
00:35:45,998 --> 00:35:48,103
We could use more food,
but there's no money left.

494
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:51,622
I'm not taking any chances
by asking our medical friends for more.

495
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,348
I told Nuttall we'd get to the boat
by midnight.

496
00:35:55,309 --> 00:35:58,178
Jeremy, we must not fail tonight.

497
00:35:58,253 --> 00:36:01,287
What the devil have you been up to?

498
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:04,391
Tonight will be a fine night,
judging by the sky.

499
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,682
There you are, Pitt. Keep it covered up
and it should heal in a day or so.

500
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,542
Miss Bishop. You looking for me, sir?

501
00:36:13,613 --> 00:36:15,817
Yes. You, stop!

502
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:20,231
What's the matter? Why are you shaking?

503
00:36:20,973 --> 00:36:22,883
Nothing. l....

504
00:36:26,158 --> 00:36:28,394
What's going on between you two?

505
00:36:29,261 --> 00:36:31,716
Why, nothing. The man has a bad leg.

506
00:36:35,245 --> 00:36:37,667
I'll tend to you later.
Where have you been?

507
00:36:38,317 --> 00:36:40,324
I've been at my work,
attending to the Governor.

508
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:41,608
You lie.

509
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:42,916
Do I?

510
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,746
The Governor's had another attack of gout.

511
00:36:44,814 --> 00:36:48,229
He's been screaming for you
like a wounded horse all the afternoon.

512
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,243
Then it appears
I was not with the Governor.

513
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:52,740
Then where have you been?

514
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:55,174
-Why, I've been at....
-He was with me, Uncle.

515
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:56,194
What?

516
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,979
Thank you for protecting my reputation,
Dr. Blood, but it was a useless gallantry.

517
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,663
My uncle knows that I spend my time
with whomever I please.

518
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:05,516
You might choose your company
with better taste.

519
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:08,581
His Excellency's waiting for you!
Here, Kent, lend him your horse.

520
00:37:08,654 --> 00:37:09,734
Yes, sir.

521
00:37:10,253 --> 00:37:12,872
Otherwise, the lout will be all night
getting there.

522
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,665
Will I be required there long, sir?

523
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,635
You're afraid your work will interfere
with your social affairs?

524
00:37:17,709 --> 00:37:21,418
lf I get back late, before midnight,
could I get back into the stockade?

525
00:37:21,486 --> 00:37:24,453
Will you stay here talking all night?
Be off with you!

526
00:37:30,797 --> 00:37:32,706
Take him to the stockade!

527
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,856
Go on, get along in there.

528
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:43,975
lf he talks, we're lost.

529
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,190
Well?

530
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,385
lt seems that you're continually
doing me favors.

531
00:38:01,454 --> 00:38:03,493
-I don't know why.
-Neither do I.

532
00:38:03,565 --> 00:38:04,645
Yes, I do.

533
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:07,979
lt's because you're so very grateful
and always thank me so prettily.

534
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:11,171
Sure now, you don't blame me
for resenting you and your favors.

535
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:14,955
This is interesting. I've had men tell me
they had reasons for admiring me...

536
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,607
and some have even laid claims
to reasons for loving me...

537
00:38:17,678 --> 00:38:21,900
but for a man to store up reasons
for resenting me, how refreshing.

538
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:23,907
You must tell me a few of them.

539
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:26,370
The first is reason enough.
You bought me.

540
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:31,563
I've had no lack of experiences in my time,
but to be bought and sold was a new one.

541
00:38:31,629 --> 00:38:33,636
I was in no mood to thank my purchaser.

542
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:36,262
That I can understand. Go on.

543
00:38:36,685 --> 00:38:38,659
I've resented you because your name
is Bishop.

544
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,155
My thoughts have lumped you
with your uncle.

545
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:44,196
How was I to know
that a devil could have....

546
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:47,432
That a devil could have an angel
for a niece?

547
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:51,268
From a resentful man,
that is a pretty fair compliment.

548
00:38:52,173 --> 00:38:55,207
Have you any more reasons
for resenting me like that one?

549
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:57,510
lndeed, I have. And the strongest of all...

550
00:38:58,189 --> 00:39:02,183
I've resented you
because you're beautiful, and I'm a slave.

551
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:04,102
Do you understand that?

552
00:39:07,149 --> 00:39:08,556
I don't know.

553
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,526
Perhaps if you were to explain further, I....

554
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,828
I've already talked too much.

555
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:18,694
I'll open your mouth!

556
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,996
You'll stay here
without food or water until you talk.

557
00:39:33,293 --> 00:39:36,327
-Why did you lie to your uncle?
-Because....

558
00:39:37,677 --> 00:39:40,197
Dr. Blood,
you're a physician and should know.

559
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:44,171
ls it not considered unhealthy
for a slave to be seen at a boat?

560
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:48,360
-Why should it be?
-Boats put out to sea.

561
00:39:48,237 --> 00:39:49,764
Slaves may not.

562
00:39:51,406 --> 00:39:53,445
You're jumping to conclusions, aren't you?

563
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:54,630
Am I?

564
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,507
The Governor will be waiting for you.

565
00:39:58,509 --> 00:39:59,491
Yes.

566
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,110
Miss Bishop,
it's difficult for an Irishman to apologize.

567
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:07,205
But I hope you can forgive me
for having thought badly of you.

568
00:40:07,277 --> 00:40:09,666
I will, if you tell me
how you think of me now.

569
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,971
How I think of you now? I think of you....

570
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:18,122
I think of you as the woman who owns me.
Her slave.

571
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:22,340
But I think the man is lucky
who can count you his friend.

572
00:40:22,413 --> 00:40:24,235
I think you know you can.

573
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:35,400
Your slave is grateful
for all marks of favor.

574
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:37,541
When you forget your slavery
and go so far--

575
00:40:37,613 --> 00:40:39,200
Now there, you're mistaken.

576
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,671
However far this slave may go,
he won't forget.

577
00:40:43,373 --> 00:40:46,439
lt's a characteristic we Irish
have in common with the elephants.

578
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:40,838
Hello. Where are you going?

579
00:41:41,454 --> 00:41:44,388
You're so much improved,
I was returning to the stockade.

580
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:47,396
Don't leave me tonight. I'm a sick man.

581
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:50,438
I assure you, sir,
there's nothing more I can do.

582
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,134
There must be something.

583
00:41:52,621 --> 00:41:54,726
Perhaps you ought to bleed me again.

584
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:59,203
Very well, then, if you wish it.

585
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:04,361
But mind, no more softness about this.

586
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:08,167
I'm gonna have you well by midnight
if I have to bleed you to death.

587
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,428
-Who goes there?
-Peter Blood.

588
00:42:36,525 --> 00:42:39,176
-Jeremy, what's happened?
-Water.

589
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:45,340
Easy, lad.

590
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,125
I didn't tell him. I didn't.

591
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:57,418
-Tell him what, Jeremy?
-About our plans.

592
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:00,771
My back.

593
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,958
Help me.

594
00:43:08,173 --> 00:43:10,245
-Who did this?
-Bishop.

595
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,452
Bishop. Swine!

596
00:43:13,516 --> 00:43:15,753
I didn't tell him. I didn't.

597
00:43:25,613 --> 00:43:29,290
-ls our boat still standing in at the bay?
-Yes, Jeremy.

598
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,394
I wondered if I was still out of my mind.

599
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:37,353
I've been seeing boats sailing in and out...

600
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:42,120
in and out, but ours will never sail.

601
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:44,295
Not now.

602
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,940
Or if it does, you'll sail without me.

603
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,682
What?
And get lost at sea without our navigator?

604
00:43:52,749 --> 00:43:56,393
-Nonsense, lad.
-We are not going this time.

605
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:58,889
lt's hopeless for all of us.

606
00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:02,726
We'll manage somehow.

607
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,354
-What are you doing here?
-Doing?

608
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:15,778
Why, the duties of my office.

609
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:18,341
I said he was to have
no food nor drink till I ordered.

610
00:44:18,413 --> 00:44:20,551
Sure now, I never heard you.

611
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,147
How could you? You weren't here.

612
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:24,971
Then how do you expect me
to know what orders you've given?

613
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:30,818
ln the name of humanity!
lf you know the word.

614
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,932
-You dare take that tone with me?
-Yes, I do!

615
00:44:35,533 --> 00:44:37,387
I've been too soft with you...

616
00:44:37,965 --> 00:44:39,623
but that shall be mended.

617
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:41,258
Kent, tie him up!

618
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:47,720
Had it easy here up to now. Get up there.

619
00:44:59,437 --> 00:45:01,193
Now I'll take this rod to you...

620
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:04,227
until there's not an inch of hide left
on your dirty carcass.

621
00:45:04,461 --> 00:45:05,671
Another beating?

622
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,872
This will be a good half-dozen of them
you've given me in promise.

623
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:11,145
This will be as real as it is overdue.

624
00:45:11,693 --> 00:45:14,824
And what becomes of His Excellency
the Governor's gouty foot?

625
00:45:14,893 --> 00:45:18,787
You'll not save yourself with that device
this time. Nothing will save you.

626
00:45:23,468 --> 00:45:25,802
Pirates! Spanish pirates!

627
00:45:30,317 --> 00:45:32,706
This is what I call a timely interruption.

628
00:45:33,324 --> 00:45:36,172
Though what will come of it,
the devil himself only knows.

629
00:47:58,669 --> 00:48:01,516
We've got to get through the town
to get to the boat.

630
00:48:01,772 --> 00:48:03,201
Wait here, lads.

631
00:48:51,853 --> 00:48:53,630
lt's me. Mr. Nuttall.

632
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:55,200
You came close to being
the ex-Mr. Nuttall.

633
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,451
Wouldn't be the first death I died today.

634
00:48:58,189 --> 00:49:00,677
We can't stay here waiting for them
to catch sight of us.

635
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:02,243
Let's get to the boat down this way.

636
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,100
Sunk to the bottom of the briny.

637
00:49:28,588 --> 00:49:30,955
And it sunk our hopes with it.

638
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,915
-Perhaps not.
-What do you mean, Peter?

639
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:40,293
-He's gonna take a bath?
-Yes, but not for cleanliness.

640
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,719
Since the Spaniards have been
thoughtless enough to sink our craft...

641
00:49:43,788 --> 00:49:46,822
I'll see if I can't persuade them
to lend us one of theirs.

642
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,578
Your Excellency,
facts are so often dull and deplorable.

643
00:51:48,908 --> 00:51:51,210
Nevertheless, at the risk of boring you...

644
00:51:51,276 --> 00:51:55,204
it is my painful duty to inform you
that 250 of my men...

645
00:51:55,276 --> 00:51:58,538
are now complete masters
of the town of Port Royal.

646
00:51:58,892 --> 00:52:01,674
Your most worthy islanders
have been disarmed...

647
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:04,714
and your city is now
absolutely in the hands...

648
00:52:04,781 --> 00:52:08,326
of the forces of His Majesty
King Philip of Spain.

649
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:11,660
Now that you have our city,
what do you want with it?

650
00:52:11,853 --> 00:52:14,754
For a price,
I could forebear reducing it to ashes.

651
00:52:15,564 --> 00:52:19,458
-What price?
-200,000 pieces of eight.

652
00:52:20,716 --> 00:52:23,105
200,000 pieces of eight?

653
00:53:18,316 --> 00:53:20,737
That's why we waited till this morning
to put to sea.

654
00:53:20,812 --> 00:53:24,325
We've a message for those Spaniards.
They are on their way now to receive it.

655
00:53:24,396 --> 00:53:26,917
-Hagthorpe, man the guns!
-Clear deck!

656
00:53:33,932 --> 00:53:37,630
-All ready, Hagthorpe?
-Aye, Peter, ready.

657
00:53:37,132 --> 00:53:39,587
Give them a taste of their own iron!

658
00:54:21,484 --> 00:54:23,426
You've done it, Hagthorpe!

659
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,322
Hurrah!

660
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,174
Didn't I tell you I was a gunner, sir?

661
00:54:31,244 --> 00:54:33,927
You did that,
you son of a Yorkshire steer...

662
00:54:33,997 --> 00:54:36,779
and bless your rusty heart,
it's a gunner you are!

663
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:41,698
lt's the Governor.

664
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:46,763
lt must be that some brave party
of citizens captured the ship.

665
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:48,290
I think you're right.

666
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,524
Someone should go aboard
and congratulate them.

667
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:01,701
Yes. My foot.

668
00:55:01,933 --> 00:55:05,348
Since your gout so unhappily
prevents you, allow me to be the one.

669
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:08,268
Go ahead. You've always wanted
to be governor anyway.

670
00:55:08,748 --> 00:55:09,828
Don't be nervous.

671
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,624
-Man those sweeps.
-Aye, sir.

672
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,785
-Shall we hoist anchor, Peter?
-Aye. Get under way.

673
00:55:21,452 --> 00:55:23,459
There's another boat approaching.

674
00:55:29,677 --> 00:55:31,815
lt looks like Col. Bishop.

675
00:55:32,364 --> 00:55:33,858
-Who?
-Bishop.

676
00:55:33,932 --> 00:55:36,168
The fool would come blundering
in just now.

677
00:55:36,237 --> 00:55:39,848
-I'll make short work of him.
-No, Hagthorpe, none of that.

678
00:56:01,932 --> 00:56:04,801
But.... Who....

679
00:56:18,285 --> 00:56:21,284
Welcome aboard the <i>Cinco Lagos,</i>
Colonel darling.

680
00:56:21,868 --> 00:56:23,297
You? Was it....

681
00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:28,325
Peter Blood, was it you, then, who took
this ship and turned defeat into victory?

682
00:56:28,396 --> 00:56:32,324
Myself it was. Myself and these,
my friends. And your friends.

683
00:56:34,604 --> 00:56:36,579
And you saved my money, too!

684
00:56:42,668 --> 00:56:45,767
-Yes, it was heroic.
-Heroic, is it?

685
00:56:45,836 --> 00:56:47,723
lt was epic.

686
00:56:48,108 --> 00:56:49,188
You amaze me.

687
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,194
On my soul, you deserve well.
You all deserve well.

688
00:56:52,364 --> 00:56:55,233
-You shall find me grateful.
-How grateful?

689
00:56:55,756 --> 00:56:59,466
I shall ask His Excellency to write home
to the King an account of your exploit.

690
00:56:59,532 --> 00:57:01,768
Perhaps some of your sentencing
shall be remitted.

691
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:03,942
That's just about
what we expected from you.

692
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,120
Now, Wolf, Col. Bishop has a kind heart.

693
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:09,252
-But what kind, I'd hate to say.
-What is this?

694
00:57:09,324 --> 00:57:13,660
Why, Colonel darling,
such unusual generosity from you...

695
00:57:13,132 --> 00:57:15,204
must be making you feel unwell.

696
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,601
-As your physician, I'd prescribe--
-A bit of neck-stretching.

697
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:26,786
Lads, we shouldn't hang this man.

698
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,583
-No?
-No.

699
00:57:38,219 --> 00:57:39,529
Tie him over the end of a gun!

700
00:57:39,596 --> 00:57:41,963
I'll scatter his innards
all over the sugarcane field.

701
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,167
You're wasting words, I say. Hang him !

702
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:54,730
Wait, lads. Hanging's too dignified for him.

703
00:57:54,924 --> 00:57:56,418
Can you swim, Colonel darling?

704
00:57:56,492 --> 00:58:00,380
We're giving you the chance to cool off
some of that excessive heat of yours.

705
00:58:00,108 --> 00:58:02,148
Over the side with him, men!

706
00:58:09,996 --> 00:58:13,379
One, two...

707
00:58:13,964 --> 00:58:15,393
three!

708
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,362
Peter Blood, I'll make you pay for this...

709
00:58:24,428 --> 00:58:26,948
if I spend the rest of my life doing it!

710
00:58:27,276 --> 00:58:31,171
And then the whale came,
and the whale swallowed Jonah. I hope.

711
00:58:32,268 --> 00:58:34,537
Goodbye, Jonah. Don't forget to write.

712
00:58:38,924 --> 00:58:40,746
What's the next move, Peter?

713
00:58:40,908 --> 00:58:44,137
Up anchor! Wolf, man the capstan bar.

714
00:58:44,332 --> 00:58:49,482
Hagthorpe, get the sails aloft.
Thomas, get those men over here.

715
00:58:54,828 --> 00:58:58,439
Round you go, men!
That's no water wheel you're working.

716
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,514
-Can you handle it, Jeremy?
-Aye, aye, Peter.

717
00:59:08,588 --> 00:59:10,376
We sail. Hard to starboard.

718
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:16,613
Up that rigging, you monkeys, aloft!
There's no chains to hold you now!

719
00:59:19,404 --> 00:59:20,746
Break out those sails...

720
00:59:20,812 --> 00:59:24,194
and watch them fill with the wind
that's carrying us all to freedom.

721
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,618
We, the undersigned...

722
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:24,800
are men without a country...

723
01:00:25,452 --> 01:00:28,616
outlaws in our own land,
and homeless outcasts in any other.

724
01:00:29,516 --> 01:00:32,199
Desperate men,
we go to seek a desperate fortune.

725
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,621
Therefore, we do here and now
band ourselves...

726
01:00:39,692 --> 01:00:41,480
into a brotherhood of buccaneers...

727
01:00:41,868 --> 01:00:44,552
to practice the trade of piracy
on the high seas.

728
01:00:44,844 --> 01:00:47,462
We, the hunted, will now hunt!

729
01:00:49,548 --> 01:00:52,515
To that end, we enter into
the following articles of agreement.

730
01:00:52,588 --> 01:00:53,635
First...

731
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:59,430
we pledge ourselves
to be bound together as brothers...

732
01:00:59,596 --> 01:01:01,603
in a life-and-death friendship...

733
01:01:02,156 --> 01:01:04,611
sharing alike in fortune and in trouble.

734
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:08,325
Second article.

735
01:01:09,769 --> 01:01:13,310
All moneys and valuables
which may come into our possession...

736
01:01:13,577 --> 01:01:16,970
shall be lumped together
into a common fund...

737
01:01:16,553 --> 01:01:18,887
and from this fund
shall first be taken the money...

738
01:01:18,953 --> 01:01:21,580
to fit, rig, and provision the ship.

739
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:26,274
After that, the recompense each
will receive who is wounded as follows:

740
01:01:27,562 --> 01:01:31,206
For the loss of a right arm,
600 pieces of eight.

741
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:34,470
Left arm, 500.

742
01:01:35,241 --> 01:01:37,892
For the loss of a right leg, 500.

743
01:01:38,281 --> 01:01:40,517
Left leg, 400.

744
01:01:41,129 --> 01:01:43,710
A fellow can get rich if he's lucky.

745
01:01:43,209 --> 01:01:44,387
Greedy.

746
01:01:46,154 --> 01:01:48,193
lf a man conceal any treasure captured...

747
01:01:48,265 --> 01:01:51,561
or fail to place it in the general fund,
he shall be marooned.

748
01:01:52,169 --> 01:01:53,762
Set ashore on a deserted isle...

749
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:56,517
and there left with a bottle of water,
a loaf of bread...

750
01:01:56,777 --> 01:01:58,500
and a pistol with one load.

751
01:01:59,594 --> 01:02:02,757
lf a man shall be drunk on duty,
he shall receive the same fate.

752
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:07,269
And if a man shall molest
a woman captive against her will...

753
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:10,274
he, too,
shall receive the same punishment.

754
01:02:11,945 --> 01:02:16,385
These articles entered into,
this 20th day of June, in the year 1687.

755
01:02:19,881 --> 01:02:22,215
Now, men, you've heard the agreement.

756
01:02:22,601 --> 01:02:25,535
lt's the world against us
and us against the world.

757
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:30,216
''His hand will be against every man,
and every man's hand against him.''

758
01:02:30,537 --> 01:02:32,741
Genesis 16:12.

759
01:02:33,737 --> 01:02:38,177
Those of you in favor of these articles,
raise your right hands and say aye!

760
01:02:38,633 --> 01:02:39,877
Aye!

761
01:03:43,241 --> 01:03:44,931
Blood!

762
01:03:45,577 --> 01:03:48,676
This impertinent,
ungoverned rascal must be eradicated.

763
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,245
Yes, Your Majesty.

764
01:03:50,313 --> 01:03:53,950
Sinking Spanish ships
causes me enough embarrassment...

765
01:03:53,161 --> 01:03:56,960
-but he sinks English ships as well.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

766
01:03:56,168 --> 01:03:57,892
Cannot Gov. Steed do something about it?

767
01:03:57,961 --> 01:04:00,547
He does his best,
but conditions on the island--

768
01:04:00,617 --> 01:04:04,391
Silence, Willoughby! I'm not interested
in anything you have to say.

769
01:04:05,161 --> 01:04:07,200
I know your feelings towards me.

770
01:04:08,873 --> 01:04:12,386
Sunderland, what are you Secretary
of State for? Have you no solution?

771
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:15,905
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Get your head off that hinge. Speak up.

772
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:19,654
Since Gov. Steed is incapable,
you should appoint a stronger man.

773
01:04:19,753 --> 01:04:20,801
Who?

774
01:04:20,873 --> 01:04:23,807
Col. Bishop assures me
that if he were in power...

775
01:04:23,945 --> 01:04:25,669
he would not rest day or night...

776
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:29,479
until this Capt. Blood
was swinging on execution dock.

777
01:04:29,897 --> 01:04:31,806
Angling for the office, is he?

778
01:04:31,945 --> 01:04:35,760
What difference
if he's the iron man we need?

779
01:04:36,937 --> 01:04:38,563
Draw up the appointment.

780
01:04:39,177 --> 01:04:42,210
I've already taken the liberty of doing so,
Your Majesty.

781
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:04,703
Mrs. Steed, Mr. Steed,
I wish you both a pleasant journey.

782
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:08,639
I thank you, Governor.
Again, congratulations, Gov. Bishop.

783
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:12,579
-May your term of office be successful.
-Thank you, my friend.

784
01:05:12,777 --> 01:05:14,980
Arabella dear,
have a nice holiday in England.

785
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:16,325
I'm sure I shall.

786
01:05:16,393 --> 01:05:17,342
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.

787
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:19,783
-Keep a weather eye open for pirates.
-Very well, sir.

788
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:23,198
Before you return, Arabella,
I shall have the sea swept clean of them.

789
01:05:23,272 --> 01:05:26,142
Particularly one.
I think you know whom I mean.

790
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:32,804
I hope he gets the gout
the infernal office gave me.

791
01:05:33,193 --> 01:05:36,324
Come along. Goodbye.

792
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:47,720
Thomas Fulton. One share, no injuries.

793
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:53,223
James Graham. One share,
plus 100 pieces of eight for a pike wound.

794
01:05:54,185 --> 01:05:58,113
Zachary Stevens.
For bravery at the battle of Maracaibo...

795
01:05:58,185 --> 01:06:00,291
one share, plus £10 of silver.

796
01:06:02,601 --> 01:06:07,303
Oliver Clark. One share, plus 400 pieces
of eight for the loss of his left leg.

797
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:09,224
There you are, Oliver, I'm proud of you.

798
01:06:09,449 --> 01:06:13,956
Lord Chester Dyke.
No injury, one share and £5 of silver.

799
01:06:14,377 --> 01:06:15,937
Anton Brazilimo.

800
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:19,267
Andrew Fell.

801
01:06:20,297 --> 01:06:23,745
One share, plus 500 pieces of eight
for the loss of his left arm.

802
01:06:24,201 --> 01:06:26,306
There you are, Andrew, and good luck.

803
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:29,510
David Sampson. One share, no injuries.

804
01:06:32,361 --> 01:06:36,354
Honesty Nuttall. No injuries, one share.

805
01:06:37,865 --> 01:06:39,174
Hold on, Captain.

806
01:06:39,241 --> 01:06:42,623
How about me little toe,
heroically sacrificed in battle?

807
01:06:42,697 --> 01:06:46,472
Honesty Nuttall. One share, and nothing
for the toe he just shot off himself.

808
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,230
You stupid numskull.

809
01:06:51,305 --> 01:06:55,134
You should have shot out your brains
and left your toe for thinking with.

810
01:07:04,841 --> 01:07:06,499
Ahoy, the deck!

811
01:07:06,793 --> 01:07:09,346
An English ship on the port bow!

812
01:07:20,648 --> 01:07:21,892
So it is.

813
01:07:21,993 --> 01:07:25,375
A fine big ship, too,
as far as I can judge from this distance.

814
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,880
Shall we sail over
and give them a surprise?

815
01:07:27,945 --> 01:07:28,927
No, Peter.

816
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,789
The men are set on putting in at Tortuga.

817
01:07:30,856 --> 01:07:32,744
Their gold's burning holes in their pockets.

818
01:07:32,809 --> 01:07:35,780
What's one ship more or less to us now?

819
01:07:35,273 --> 01:07:37,574
lt appears I have a mutiny on my hands.

820
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,590
What ho, the deck! A ship to starboard!

821
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,516
lt may be a pirate!

822
01:08:12,232 --> 01:08:16,290
Very well, then.
Sail on, little ship, back to England...

823
01:08:17,225 --> 01:08:18,883
where we may never go.

824
01:08:20,168 --> 01:08:23,267
You'll never know
how close you came to not getting there.

825
01:09:32,265 --> 01:09:34,152
Your turn, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

826
01:09:34,217 --> 01:09:35,165
Up!

827
01:09:37,769 --> 01:09:39,296
<i>It's your turn now.</i>

828
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,248
<i>Again, my captain.</i>

829
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:48,168
<i>-Are you ready?</i>
-Right.

830
01:09:49,192 --> 01:09:50,621
<i>It's good.</i>

831
01:09:50,857 --> 01:09:52,515
This time, my friend, huh?

832
01:09:55,337 --> 01:09:57,125
<i>-You missed.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

833
01:09:57,513 --> 01:10:00,262
I am defeated.
You win the prize, Capt. Blood.

834
01:10:00,616 --> 01:10:02,853
<i>-Goodbye, my dear.</i>
<i>-Goodbye.</i>

835
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:05,858
<i>What a charming captain.</i>

836
01:10:06,505 --> 01:10:08,359
Some other time, perhaps.

837
01:10:08,425 --> 01:10:09,832
<i>Why?</i>

838
01:10:09,897 --> 01:10:11,937
What sort of a man are you?

839
01:10:12,392 --> 01:10:15,840
I'm the sort of man you like, my dear.
A man with money.

840
01:10:17,417 --> 01:10:18,661
<i>The money!</i>

841
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,248
<i>Mon capitaine,</i>
what a pair we would make.

842
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,866
ln all the Caribbean,
there is no buccaneer so strong as me.

843
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,470
Except you.

844
01:10:38,152 --> 01:10:40,192
You almost flatter me, Levasseur.

845
01:10:40,265 --> 01:10:43,909
Why do you hold off your consent so long?
We become partners.

846
01:10:43,977 --> 01:10:46,432
You've been in Tortuga
these three, four months.

847
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,880
You must be even so much
in need of gold as I.

848
01:10:49,961 --> 01:10:52,295
Such a partnership requires sober thought.

849
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:55,492
My poor head has been dancing with rum
this whole week past.

850
01:10:55,721 --> 01:10:58,655
Even so drunk, your brain is the greatest
this side the Caribbean.

851
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:02,230
With your brain and my strength,
there is nothing we cannot do.

852
01:11:02,953 --> 01:11:05,473
There's very little I can't do all by myself.

853
01:11:15,113 --> 01:11:17,550
<i>Long Iive Capt. Levasseur!</i>

854
01:11:18,249 --> 01:11:20,518
And here's to Capt. Blood!

855
01:11:20,585 --> 01:11:21,533
Hurrah!

856
01:11:28,873 --> 01:11:31,972
<i>Then, it's a good dinner guest, my friend.</i>

857
01:11:32,232 --> 01:11:34,501
-You're next, Peter.
<i>-Mon capitaine.</i>

858
01:11:35,912 --> 01:11:38,946
lt's clearly understood, then,
that we sail under my articles.

859
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,602
Those very severe articles of yours?

860
01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:44,355
<i>Mais oui,</i> I sail under the articles
of a girls' <i>séminaire...</i>

861
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:47,392
to have you as my partner, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

862
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,329
Women will be the death of you yet,
Levasseur.

863
01:11:56,168 --> 01:11:59,463
lt is a very pleasant way to die,
even if it is expensive.

864
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:03,813
What is the first order,
<i>mon capitaine</i> partner?

865
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,659
We sail on the tide.
Outside the harbor, we'll scatter.

866
01:12:06,728 --> 01:12:10,656
Each ship will proceed singly to pick up
any stray ships we'll find on the journey.

867
01:12:10,728 --> 01:12:12,670
We'll meet at the island of Virgen Magra.

868
01:12:12,744 --> 01:12:13,922
<i>Magnifique!</i>

869
01:12:13,993 --> 01:12:16,611
I give you the toast. To our great success!

870
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,779
Let me give one.
To the greatest captain on the Caribbean!

871
01:12:19,849 --> 01:12:23,450
<i>-Oui!</i> To <i>Capitaine Levasseur!</i>
-Capt. Blood.

872
01:12:23,497 --> 01:12:24,958
Bravo!

873
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,131
The articles aside,
let's give a toast to Capt. Blood.

874
01:12:29,544 --> 01:12:31,600
<i>Capitaine Levasseur.</i>

875
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,251
To the greatest captain on the coast.

876
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,391
The greatest captain on the coast, is it?

877
01:12:41,992 --> 01:12:44,992
Methinks the greatest captain
on the coast...

878
01:12:45,384 --> 01:12:47,750
has just made the greatest mistake...

879
01:12:47,145 --> 01:12:49,698
the most ordinary common fool
could make.

880
01:13:04,552 --> 01:13:08,262
lt's been so lovely. I'd like to stay forever.
You've all been so kind.

881
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,815
Come again and visit us soon, dear.

882
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:14,173
England is so much more beautiful
when you're here.

883
01:13:14,344 --> 01:13:16,766
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

884
01:13:17,224 --> 01:13:20,258
-Thank you for everything.
-Goodbye, dear.

885
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:22,369
-Goodbye, Amelia.
-Goodbye, Mary.

886
01:13:36,968 --> 01:13:41,270
However else the court may have changed,
the art of flattery still flourishes.

887
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:42,657
Stab me if it's flattery.

888
01:13:42,728 --> 01:13:46,590
When the King ordered me on this journey
as a special emissary to the West Indies...

889
01:13:46,665 --> 01:13:49,731
I looked forward with some trepidation
to a life among the savages.

890
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,102
But when I found
you were one of those savages...

891
01:13:52,169 --> 01:13:55,943
returning to your native heath,
my grateful eyes could hardly believe it.

892
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:01,214
You pictured us running around
in animal skins, eating raw meat?

893
01:14:01,288 --> 01:14:03,874
Why not, in a country filled
with Indians and pirates?

894
01:14:03,945 --> 01:14:08,549
Speaking of pirates, did you ever happen
to hear of a wild rogue named Blood?

895
01:14:08,745 --> 01:14:10,119
-Peter Blood?
-Yes.

896
01:14:11,305 --> 01:14:13,377
No. I don't know him.

897
01:14:13,928 --> 01:14:16,317
I hardly number pirates
among my acquaintances.

898
01:14:16,392 --> 01:14:19,142
Of course not. Stupid of me.
I merely mention him in passing.

899
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:21,444
Because he's one of the objects
of my mission.

900
01:14:21,513 --> 01:14:22,495
-Your mission?
-Yes.

901
01:14:22,568 --> 01:14:25,602
I've been sent to try to blot out
all this piracy, my dear.

902
01:14:25,672 --> 01:14:29,217
And in a manner
I must keep secret till I find Capt. Blood.

903
01:14:32,392 --> 01:14:34,781
Ship on the port side, sir!

904
01:14:38,152 --> 01:14:40,486
Yes, that's a fine ship.

905
01:14:43,816 --> 01:14:47,394
-Captain, what ship is that?
-I don't know, Lord Willoughby.

906
01:14:47,784 --> 01:14:51,330
She flies the French flag.
She could be anything in these waters.

907
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:55,139
-We're in pirate waters now, aren't we?
-Yes, we are.

908
01:14:55,464 --> 01:14:59,556
Yonder bank of low clouds
is the island of Virgen Magra.

909
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,797
-Exciting, isn't it?
-Very.

910
01:15:01,993 --> 01:15:04,709
Could she be a pirate ship, by any chance?

911
01:15:04,777 --> 01:15:07,810
Any ship we meet in the Caribbean
could be a pirate ship.

912
01:15:13,865 --> 01:15:17,727
Ahoy, English ship off port side!

913
01:15:17,801 --> 01:15:20,102
Prepare to come onto starboard tack!

914
01:15:20,168 --> 01:15:21,794
Starboard tack it is!

915
01:15:21,864 --> 01:15:23,900
Steady at the helm !

916
01:15:24,681 --> 01:15:25,924
Ready?

917
01:15:25,993 --> 01:15:27,421
Stand by your guns.

918
01:15:33,288 --> 01:15:34,881
<i>What Iuck.</i>

919
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:38,823
Just as I'm about to give up and anchor
to wait for my partner, Capt. Blood...

920
01:15:38,888 --> 01:15:41,474
this fine English prize
walks into my parlor and says:

921
01:15:41,544 --> 01:15:43,716
<i>''HeIIo, Capt. Levasseur. ''</i>

922
01:15:43,785 --> 01:15:47,265
-We've got to give welcome, Cahusac.
<i>-Yes, and how.</i> Light it!

923
01:16:15,145 --> 01:16:18,341
The ransom for you two is fixed at
20,000 pieces of eight.

924
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:19,815
I shall provide a boat for you...

925
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,695
to go to Gov. Bishop at Jamaica
to collect it.

926
01:16:23,688 --> 01:16:27,431
Meanwhile, <i>mademoiseIIe</i> remains
with me as hostage.

927
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,437
I find it very lonely on this island.

928
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:34,306
I refuse absolutely and utterly!

929
01:16:34,376 --> 01:16:37,671
You know this? It is the rosary of pain.

930
01:16:38,184 --> 01:16:41,665
lt is possible to screw a man's eyes
out of his head.

931
01:16:42,504 --> 01:16:44,838
Very well. Do your worst.

932
01:16:45,384 --> 01:16:46,333
<i>AIors!</i>

933
01:16:47,433 --> 01:16:48,545
No, stop!

934
01:16:48,616 --> 01:16:51,299
Lord Willoughby, thank you,
but don't be foolish.

935
01:16:51,656 --> 01:16:53,282
<i>MademoiseIIe</i> is right.

936
01:16:53,384 --> 01:16:55,271
<i>Thank you, miss.</i>

937
01:16:55,496 --> 01:16:58,529
I beg you to spare yourself
and the young lady.

938
01:16:58,601 --> 01:17:00,488
You know,
I've been too modest with you...

939
01:17:00,552 --> 01:17:03,334
but since I have said
20,000 pieces of eight...

940
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:06,499
<i>eh bien,</i> I have said 20,000 pieces of eight.

941
01:17:06,568 --> 01:17:09,765
For what, if you please,
have you said 20,000 pieces of eight?

942
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:16,128
lf it ain't the niece
of our old friend Col. Bishop.

943
01:17:16,648 --> 01:17:18,721
You don't recognize her. Mind that.

944
01:17:20,489 --> 01:17:21,732
What does he mean?

945
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,655
Your guess is as good as mine.

946
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:36,263
-Good morning, Levasseur.
<i>-HeIIo, Captain.</i>

947
01:17:36,328 --> 01:17:37,790
-Cahusac.
<i>-Capitaine.</i>

948
01:17:38,184 --> 01:17:41,632
I arrived late last night and put into a cove
a few miles to the west.

949
01:17:41,705 --> 01:17:44,639
We've walked across
to give you good morning, but, faith...

950
01:17:44,712 --> 01:17:47,746
it seems we've interrupted
some business of yours.

951
01:17:47,816 --> 01:17:49,889
-Who are these people?
<i>-Oh, yes, here.</i>

952
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,742
As you see, two prisoners.
I captured an English ship.

953
01:17:52,808 --> 01:17:55,450
Yes. We saw her coming across the spit.

954
01:17:55,112 --> 01:17:58,495
I must congratulate you, Levasseur.
I didn't so much as sight a sail.

955
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,967
The fortunes of war, my partner.

956
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,300
And these are also the fortunes of war?

957
01:18:03,368 --> 01:18:06,335
Big fortunes. A nobleman and the niece
of the Governor of Jamaica.

958
01:18:06,408 --> 01:18:07,391
Really?

959
01:18:07,464 --> 01:18:09,569
I suppose congratulations
are again in order...

960
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,357
but have you forgotten there's an article
in our agreement...

961
01:18:12,424 --> 01:18:14,213
forbidding the taking of women prisoners?

962
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,898
That's a foolish article of yours.

963
01:18:17,128 --> 01:18:20,227
I was not aware you regarded it so
when we signed.

964
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:23,679
Would you care to dispute
my opinion now, your men against mine?

965
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,701
Not this morning, thank you.
As you say, a foolish article.

966
01:18:29,768 --> 01:18:31,142
<i>Heard, my friend.</i>

967
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:34,591
That is why these are prisoners
of my own, a matter personal.

968
01:18:34,856 --> 01:18:37,280
-And the 20,000 pieces of eight?
-Their ransom.

969
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,747
-That is also a personal matter?
-lt is.

970
01:18:39,944 --> 01:18:43,260
Obviously, these two prisoners,
and particularly the young lady...

971
01:18:43,336 --> 01:18:47,231
must be kept in someone's hands for,
shall we say, safekeeping...

972
01:18:47,304 --> 01:18:48,929
but why your hands?

973
01:18:49,352 --> 01:18:51,741
Why shouldn't Pierre have her,
or Roch, or Jacob...

974
01:18:52,410 --> 01:18:54,462
since she's as much their property
as yours?

975
01:18:54,856 --> 01:18:58,566
Or doesn't that please you?
You'd like to keep her for yourself.

976
01:19:00,456 --> 01:19:02,463
And who might that be, do you suppose?

977
01:19:02,536 --> 01:19:05,832
-That is your Capt. Blood.
-Capt. Blood?

978
01:19:06,984 --> 01:19:07,966
Now, my captain...

979
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,106
since you covet our joint property
of war, you may have her...

980
01:19:11,176 --> 01:19:13,249
providing you're willing to buy her.

981
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,873
-Buy her?
-At the price you yourself have put on her.

982
01:19:15,944 --> 01:19:17,570
20,000 pieces of eight.

983
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:19,975
The ransom is to be paid by Gov. Bishop.

984
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,828
lt is for division when it comes.

985
01:19:21,896 --> 01:19:24,744
But if the Governor should refuse to pay
the ransom, what then?

986
01:19:24,808 --> 01:19:28,124
No. If you're to keep the girl meanwhile,
pay the ransom.

987
01:19:28,392 --> 01:19:30,759
Let it be your risk to collect it
from the Governor.

988
01:19:30,824 --> 01:19:32,417
Capt. Blood is right.

989
01:19:32,488 --> 01:19:35,968
-lt's in the articles.
-What's in the articles, you fools?

990
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,139
Where do you suppose
I have 20,000 pieces of eight?

991
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:41,630
-Let someone buy her who has.
-Who?

992
01:19:41,128 --> 01:19:42,372
-l.
-You?

993
01:19:44,104 --> 01:19:46,493
Jeremy, Wolf, bring the prisoners forward.

994
01:19:52,424 --> 01:19:53,886
Here they are, Peter.

995
01:19:55,368 --> 01:19:58,183
I bid 20,000 pieces of eight.

996
01:19:58,472 --> 01:20:00,544
Can you improve on that, Levasseur?

997
01:20:01,319 --> 01:20:03,294
I don't wish to be bought by you.

998
01:20:07,528 --> 01:20:09,863
As a lady once said to a slave...

999
01:20:09,928 --> 01:20:13,189
you are hardly in a position
to have anything to say about it.

1000
01:20:16,424 --> 01:20:19,392
-You want the girl?
-Why not?

1001
01:20:19,784 --> 01:20:22,530
And I'm willing to pay for what I want.

1002
01:20:23,470 --> 01:20:25,917
Cahusac, you boast a knowledge of pearls.

1003
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,953
At what do you value each of those?

1004
01:20:33,992 --> 01:20:36,320
1,000 pieces each.

1005
01:20:36,104 --> 01:20:39,749
They're worth rather more, but very well.
Here are 12.

1006
01:20:39,816 --> 01:20:43,646
The three-fifths the value of the prize
due your ship for having made the capture.

1007
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:46,916
For the share due my men,
I make myself responsible.

1008
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:02,688
Now, Wolf, will you be so kind
as to take my property aboard ship?

1009
01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:06,562
And that settles that, my captain partner.

1010
01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:10,786
-No, you don't!
-Stop, <i>Capitaine!</i>

1011
01:21:12,232 --> 01:21:14,850
Wait! You'll not take her while I live!

1012
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,250
Then I'll take her when you're dead!

1013
01:21:18,728 --> 01:21:22,241
<i>-Capitaine,</i> it has been honorably settled.
-lt has not been settled for me!

1014
01:21:22,312 --> 01:21:25,410
What is a girl, more or less?
Do not be a fool, <i>Capitaine!</i>

1015
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,887
<i>It's my business.</i>

1016
01:21:32,583 --> 01:21:36,228
Two breaches in our articles committed
by you. You should be marooned.

1017
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,650
lt's what I intended for you in the end...

1018
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:43,910
but since you prefer it this way,
you muckrake, I'll be humoring you.

1019
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:51,614
Up!

1020
01:23:48,776 --> 01:23:52,388
And that, my friend, ends a partnership
that should never have begun.

1021
01:24:18,567 --> 01:24:21,880
All these things I've gathered
in my journeys.

1022
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,236
I've gone far since I was a slave
on your uncle's plantation...

1023
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,287
thousands of restless, hectic miles.

1024
01:24:29,832 --> 01:24:32,581
But somehow tonight,
I've got a strange feeling...

1025
01:24:32,647 --> 01:24:34,557
that my journey's almost over.

1026
01:24:36,936 --> 01:24:38,463
You see these ankle rings?

1027
01:24:38,536 --> 01:24:41,122
They came from a ship
that was out from Persia.

1028
01:24:41,704 --> 01:24:43,459
And these pearls...

1029
01:24:43,752 --> 01:24:46,687
they're the choice from a fleet
we captured off the Azores.

1030
01:24:46,792 --> 01:24:49,726
-Have you ever seen such pearls?
-Yes, I have.

1031
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:54,180
They're like the pearls you sometimes
use for making purchases, are they not?

1032
01:24:56,936 --> 01:24:59,805
-Yes, they are.
-How many lives did they cost?

1033
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:03,551
As few as possible.
lt wasn't lives I was after.

1034
01:25:03,624 --> 01:25:05,893
-What, then?
-I never quite knew.

1035
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,109
Some urge that drove me on.
Revenge, I suppose.

1036
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:12,990
But I've had my fill of revenge.

1037
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:17,580
I often wondered
why I bothered to save all these things.

1038
01:25:17,448 --> 01:25:19,303
Tonight I know it's because...

1039
01:25:20,136 --> 01:25:22,470
one day you'd be here in this cabin
to wear them.

1040
01:25:22,536 --> 01:25:23,877
I'll never wear them, never!

1041
01:25:23,943 --> 01:25:26,791
Those nor any other plunder gotten
by a thief and pirate.

1042
01:25:27,848 --> 01:25:29,255
Thief and pirate.

1043
01:25:29,704 --> 01:25:31,450
I've seen your pirate ways.

1044
01:25:31,111 --> 01:25:33,119
I've seen myself bargained for
and fought over.

1045
01:25:33,191 --> 01:25:34,850
A combat between jackals.

1046
01:25:36,263 --> 01:25:37,572
But I thought you understood.

1047
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,265
You mean you thought you'd bought me.

1048
01:25:39,336 --> 01:25:41,792
I suppose I should have regarded that
as a compliment.

1049
01:25:41,864 --> 01:25:45,280
You pirates are used to taking
without the formality of purchase.

1050
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,398
I advise you to go back to your ladies
at Tortuga...

1051
01:25:47,464 --> 01:25:49,504
who are thrilled by your bold,
lawless ways.

1052
01:25:49,576 --> 01:25:51,910
I only hate you and despise you.

1053
01:25:52,839 --> 01:25:56,300
I might have expected your thanks
for what I've done this day...

1054
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:57,827
but very well, let it be so.

1055
01:25:58,216 --> 01:26:02,450
I'm a thief and pirate and I'll show you
how a thief and a pirate can deal.

1056
01:26:02,183 --> 01:26:04,354
Once, you bought me for a miserable £10.

1057
01:26:04,584 --> 01:26:07,683
Now I've bought you for considerably
more. The amount's of no matter.

1058
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:10,860
What matters is
now I own you as you once owned me.

1059
01:26:10,152 --> 01:26:13,152
You're mine, do you understand?
Mine to do with as I please!

1060
01:26:19,719 --> 01:26:22,622
Capt. Blood,
Lord Willoughby sends his compliments...

1061
01:26:22,695 --> 01:26:25,281
and requests you to talk with him
at your convenience.

1062
01:26:25,352 --> 01:26:26,813
He's been sent by the King himself.

1063
01:26:26,887 --> 01:26:29,571
Tell him I'm not convenient
to any friend of the King's.

1064
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,331
All I've got to say is good riddance...

1065
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:33,407
as soon as I can get him to his destination.

1066
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:34,428
I shall.

1067
01:26:35,912 --> 01:26:38,399
Jeremy. Wolverstone.

1068
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:43,800
-Wolverstone!
-What is it, Peter?

1069
01:26:43,463 --> 01:26:44,892
We're changing course.

1070
01:26:44,968 --> 01:26:47,237
Draw down every rag of canvas
the yards will hold.

1071
01:26:47,303 --> 01:26:50,118
-Aye, aye, Peter, but....
-Jeremy!

1072
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,870
All hands on deck!

1073
01:26:59,912 --> 01:27:01,984
-Jeremy!
-Coming, Peter!

1074
01:27:04,808 --> 01:27:06,499
Forever sleeping when I need you?

1075
01:27:06,567 --> 01:27:09,437
-I wasn't sleeping. I was--
-Never mind! Get ready to go about.

1076
01:27:09,512 --> 01:27:11,716
-Set the course for Port Royal.
-Port Royal?

1077
01:27:13,671 --> 01:27:16,159
But the English fleet is at Port Royal.
Col. Bishop--

1078
01:27:16,232 --> 01:27:18,720
Sweet, merciful heaven! Haven't you ears?

1079
01:27:18,792 --> 01:27:20,646
Set the course for Port Royal!

1080
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,509
-Make speed there, Wolverstone.
-Speed it is, Peter.

1081
01:27:29,607 --> 01:27:32,641
-Follow we a helm, west by north.
-West by north, sir.

1082
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:43,199
Make speed there! To your halyards!

1083
01:27:43,655 --> 01:27:47,616
Tacks and braces. We head for Port Royal.

1084
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:56,510
Make speed there! That's the order!

1085
01:27:57,960 --> 01:27:58,557
Make speed there.

1086
01:28:00,423 --> 01:28:03,140
There's a gallows waiting
for each of us at Port Royal...

1087
01:28:03,208 --> 01:28:05,574
and no man should be late
to his own hanging.

1088
01:28:07,368 --> 01:28:09,910
How you hate the villain.

1089
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:12,323
lf I were a young man,
I'm dashed if I wouldn't be jealous.

1090
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:15,615
But you said you didn't even know him.

1091
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:17,312
He was once my slave.

1092
01:28:18,984 --> 01:28:19,932
Slave?

1093
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,847
Did you know him well?

1094
01:28:23,559 --> 01:28:24,574
I did.

1095
01:28:26,248 --> 01:28:28,866
He's not such a bad fellow for a pirate.

1096
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:32,870
When he made his escape,
I was thrilled and happy.

1097
01:28:33,288 --> 01:28:36,500
That was before I knew how he would use
his freedom.

1098
01:28:36,104 --> 01:28:37,281
But aren't you forgetting...

1099
01:28:37,351 --> 01:28:40,385
that a man's bitter heart
may demand revenge?

1100
01:28:40,968 --> 01:28:42,626
That is the unforgivable thing:

1101
01:28:42,855 --> 01:28:44,960
to have put his revenge above
everything else...

1102
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:47,366
and to have destroyed himself.
That's what he's done.

1103
01:28:47,432 --> 01:28:49,603
I've seen pirates. I know their ways.

1104
01:28:49,735 --> 01:28:52,899
Cruel, evil, greedy,
plundering peaceful cities...

1105
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:55,553
torturing their captives. Beasts.

1106
01:29:12,296 --> 01:29:14,532
Are you so much in love with him?

1107
01:29:14,664 --> 01:29:15,776
ln love with him?

1108
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:17,917
That you care so much what he does?

1109
01:29:17,991 --> 01:29:19,682
I don't care in the least what he does.

1110
01:29:19,751 --> 01:29:22,370
Someone should,
in view of what he's doing now.

1111
01:29:22,823 --> 01:29:25,954
But your uncle's with the fleet
at Port Royal. That much is fortunate.

1112
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:28,740
Why? What's this about my uncle
in Port Royal?

1113
01:29:28,808 --> 01:29:31,971
He amazes me, this fellow.
That's where he means to take us.

1114
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,461
-No, he can't.
-They won't let me near him.

1115
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:38,595
He's alone on his quarterdeck
in a fine Irish temper, I suspect.

1116
01:29:39,432 --> 01:29:42,847
-But I learned of it from one of the crew.
-Lord Willoughby, he mustn't.

1117
01:29:43,528 --> 01:29:45,251
My uncle is a hard, unforgiving man.

1118
01:29:45,319 --> 01:29:48,734
He lives in the hope of one day
taking and hanging Capt. Blood.

1119
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,268
Capt. Blood probably doesn't know that,
of course.

1120
01:29:51,335 --> 01:29:53,440
I doubt if it'd make any difference if he did.

1121
01:29:53,511 --> 01:29:56,970
He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.

1122
01:29:56,712 --> 01:29:57,857
Chivalrous?

1123
01:29:58,728 --> 01:30:01,826
And yet he's been what he's been
these last three years...

1124
01:30:01,991 --> 01:30:03,934
and done what he's done.

1125
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,854
Lord Willoughby, help me.

1126
01:30:07,655 --> 01:30:09,630
I see your point, my child...

1127
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:12,421
but that's something
you must decide for yourself.

1128
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:15,616
Life can be infernally complex.

1129
01:30:38,536 --> 01:30:40,575
lt's hard to lay tongue to the right words.

1130
01:30:40,647 --> 01:30:42,760
I'll lay tongue to them.

1131
01:30:42,151 --> 01:30:43,875
We won't sail to Jamaica.
Them's the words.

1132
01:30:43,943 --> 01:30:46,529
Aye, Bishop's entire fleet's at Jamaica.

1133
01:30:46,695 --> 01:30:49,346
When you risked your neck in a duel
over that petticoat...

1134
01:30:49,416 --> 01:30:50,790
that was your business.

1135
01:30:50,855 --> 01:30:53,954
But it's our necks you're risking now,
and I say no.

1136
01:30:54,230 --> 01:30:55,845
Not for her, nor a dozen like her.

1137
01:30:55,911 --> 01:30:57,821
I got a great affection for my neck.

1138
01:30:57,896 --> 01:31:01,600
I have no wish to hear it cracked
by a hangman's knot.

1139
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:04,638
This is what comes from sailing the seas
with a lovesick madman.

1140
01:31:07,271 --> 01:31:09,213
We've been with you since the first, Peter.

1141
01:31:09,287 --> 01:31:10,563
We have a right.

1142
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:15,680
You, too, Jeremy?

1143
01:31:19,271 --> 01:31:20,581
All right, lads.

1144
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:22,721
What do you mean, Peter?

1145
01:31:23,303 --> 01:31:27,130
You told me we're not sailing to Jamaica.
There's nothing more to be said.

1146
01:31:27,527 --> 01:31:30,843
-Hurrah for our side!
-Quiet. You sound like a rooster.

1147
01:31:31,207 --> 01:31:32,549
Good night, lads.

1148
01:31:32,616 --> 01:31:35,714
Wait a minute, Peter.
Where are we sailing for?

1149
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:39,902
That's for you to tell me...

1150
01:31:39,976 --> 01:31:41,634
since I'm no longer running this ship.

1151
01:31:41,704 --> 01:31:43,875
We didn't say that, Peter.

1152
01:31:44,103 --> 01:31:46,130
As Jeremy says, you've got the right.

1153
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:49,404
You've been with me from the first,
and you've been loyal and true...

1154
01:31:49,511 --> 01:31:52,708
followed me into every tight corner
men could follow another.

1155
01:31:52,775 --> 01:31:55,939
-But you always got us out.
-And none the poorer for it.

1156
01:31:56,710 --> 01:31:58,591
Yes, but on this occasion,
there's no gold to be got.

1157
01:31:58,663 --> 01:32:01,119
Do you think it was
for gold we followed you?

1158
01:32:01,447 --> 01:32:04,862
No, but I can see now I've not got
the right to ask you to follow me.

1159
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:07,106
The girl is my concern, not yours.

1160
01:32:07,591 --> 01:32:11,485
Are we gonna stand by and see
this little snip laugh at our captain?

1161
01:32:11,591 --> 01:32:12,965
There's Bishop's fleet.

1162
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,934
That might be paying a high price
to keep from being laughed at.

1163
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:19,423
We're not yet such lily-livered scum
as to be afraid of Col. Bishop.

1164
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:22,436
No. That is, not very afraid.

1165
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:26,245
Fie on you deserting our captain
in this way...

1166
01:32:26,312 --> 01:32:29,923
you scurvy traitors, you Judas Iscariots,
you snakes in the grass...

1167
01:32:29,991 --> 01:32:31,813
you wolves in sheep's clothing!

1168
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,984
I was only with them to spy on them.

1169
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:38,334
You'd better think carefully, lads.

1170
01:32:38,407 --> 01:32:41,900
Yonder lies Jamaica,
and straight we sail for it.

1171
01:32:41,255 --> 01:32:45,850
-Aye. And straight we sail for it.
-Aye!

1172
01:32:58,567 --> 01:33:01,796
-Ahoy, the deck!
-Ahoy!

1173
01:33:01,863 --> 01:33:04,670
I have sighted Port Royal!

1174
01:33:04,359 --> 01:33:06,727
Aye! Port Royal, you say?

1175
01:33:06,792 --> 01:33:08,166
Aye, sir!

1176
01:33:15,176 --> 01:33:16,964
There's something amiss!

1177
01:33:17,671 --> 01:33:21,729
I see flashes of gunfire
from ships in the harbor!

1178
01:33:21,991 --> 01:33:23,617
-Fetch the Captain.
-Aye, sir.

1179
01:33:23,687 --> 01:33:26,753
Bugler, all hands on deck!

1180
01:33:55,367 --> 01:33:57,701
lt's terrible to wake up at dawn
dreaming of thunder.

1181
01:33:57,768 --> 01:33:59,840
That's gunfire if I ever heard any.

1182
01:34:01,191 --> 01:34:04,704
-There's a battle in Port Royal harbor.
-How many ships do you make out?

1183
01:34:04,775 --> 01:34:08,669
lt's hard to see clearly in the early
morning light. I think there are two.

1184
01:34:08,967 --> 01:34:11,171
lt's an attack on Port Royal, but who?

1185
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:13,757
Pirate craft, perhaps.

1186
01:34:14,375 --> 01:34:16,415
Wish I could make out their flags.

1187
01:34:17,799 --> 01:34:20,897
-Perhaps I can supply you the answer.
-You can?

1188
01:34:20,967 --> 01:34:24,990
Yes, if I may speak to
so inaccessible a person.

1189
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:27,233
lf Port Royal is being attacked,
they are likely French ships.

1190
01:34:27,303 --> 01:34:28,251
French?

1191
01:34:35,687 --> 01:34:38,210
You say Port RoyaI's attacked
by the French? Why?

1192
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:40,476
When two countries are at war
and one is attacked...

1193
01:34:40,551 --> 01:34:42,340
who would it be but the enemy?

1194
01:34:42,407 --> 01:34:44,796
What's this? France and England at war?

1195
01:34:44,871 --> 01:34:48,350
You mean you don't know? Where have
you been the past few months?

1196
01:34:48,104 --> 01:34:49,860
At sea, out of touch with the world.

1197
01:34:49,927 --> 01:34:52,927
The fire from the fortress is weakening!

1198
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:56,583
One ship is already firing on the town!

1199
01:34:57,310 --> 01:34:58,790
That's strange.

1200
01:34:58,151 --> 01:35:00,999
Where is the English fleet
that's supposed to protect the town?

1201
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:03,747
lt's my turn to supply the answer.
lt's out chasing pirates.

1202
01:35:03,815 --> 01:35:07,744
Bishop would never let his fleet leave its
post in time of war. He wouldn't dare.

1203
01:35:07,815 --> 01:35:11,328
Col. Bishop, if I may say,
is a very old and dear friend of mine.

1204
01:35:11,399 --> 01:35:14,181
-lt's probably me he's after.
-That fool! Blunder!

1205
01:35:14,247 --> 01:35:16,690
And me in his own front yard.

1206
01:35:17,991 --> 01:35:20,413
Shorten sail there, Wolf.
Lend a hand forward, Andy.

1207
01:35:20,487 --> 01:35:23,619
Stand by helm and keep her headed
two points to larboard of the fort.

1208
01:35:23,687 --> 01:35:24,635
Aye, aye, sir.

1209
01:35:24,711 --> 01:35:26,402
Get your men to their stations, Chester.

1210
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:27,616
Port watch to stations!

1211
01:35:27,687 --> 01:35:29,116
Speed there, lads!

1212
01:35:29,671 --> 01:35:32,930
-Reef the fore topsail!
-Aye, aye, sir!

1213
01:35:32,167 --> 01:35:34,760
Take in the topgallant sail.

1214
01:35:35,496 --> 01:35:38,160
May I ask, Captain,
what are your intentions?

1215
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:41,403
Lord Willoughby, I set out to land you
at Port Royal, but now....

1216
01:35:46,887 --> 01:35:49,156
Miss Bishop,
an unlooked-for circumstance...

1217
01:35:49,223 --> 01:35:51,427
prevents my landing you
on your own dock.

1218
01:35:51,495 --> 01:35:54,245
But I trust that if I put you ashore
on the beach nearby...

1219
01:35:54,311 --> 01:35:56,253
that would be equally satisfactory?

1220
01:35:56,327 --> 01:35:57,701
-l--
-Thank you.

1221
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:02,563
Only please understand, this is a bargain...

1222
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:04,380
your freedom for my freedom.

1223
01:36:04,103 --> 01:36:06,820
From now on,
I no longer regard myself as a slave.

1224
01:36:07,911 --> 01:36:09,405
My life's my own...

1225
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:12,511
even though I'm a thief and pirate.

1226
01:36:15,463 --> 01:36:17,830
Capt. Blood, are you,
an Englishman, thinking of leaving...

1227
01:36:17,895 --> 01:36:20,196
when yonder,
an English town is being taken?

1228
01:36:20,264 --> 01:36:22,598
Hagthorpe,
clear my deck and keep it cleared.

1229
01:36:22,663 --> 01:36:25,979
-Aye, Peter, we'll take care of him.
-Take your hands off!

1230
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:29,860
-Wait, lads.
-Capt. Blood, I must talk to you.

1231
01:36:29,639 --> 01:36:31,330
Very well then, Lord Willoughby.

1232
01:36:31,399 --> 01:36:34,432
Myself, I've the honor to be Irish,
but part of my crew's English.

1233
01:36:34,503 --> 01:36:36,608
I was myself once, too, in loyalty.

1234
01:36:36,775 --> 01:36:37,953
Of what should we be thinking?

1235
01:36:38,230 --> 01:36:40,194
Of the chance to fight for your king.

1236
01:36:40,263 --> 01:36:41,725
To fight for my king?

1237
01:36:42,151 --> 01:36:45,850
Yes. He was loyal enough
to send me to seek you out...

1238
01:36:45,191 --> 01:36:47,612
to offer you pardon for your past crimes...

1239
01:36:47,687 --> 01:36:49,956
freedom from your slavery
and more than that...

1240
01:36:50,230 --> 01:36:52,925
a commission in his own navy
for you and your men.

1241
01:36:53,319 --> 01:36:56,734
You hear that, Chester?
The King wants us to join his navy!

1242
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:01,762
Read it for yourself.

1243
01:37:01,831 --> 01:37:03,937
Lord Willoughby,
you're a guest aboard my ship...

1244
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:07,303
and I've still some notion left me
from better days of decent behavior...

1245
01:37:07,367 --> 01:37:09,756
so I'll not be telling you
what I think of this offer.

1246
01:37:09,831 --> 01:37:12,580
All I'll say is,
I wouldn't soil my hands with it...

1247
01:37:12,647 --> 01:37:15,397
even though they're the hands
of a thief and a pirate.

1248
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:18,172
But this concerns you, too, my lads.

1249
01:37:18,759 --> 01:37:20,614
What do you say to serving the King?

1250
01:37:20,679 --> 01:37:21,890
No!

1251
01:37:25,703 --> 01:37:28,920
I'd like to serve him with a rope necktie.

1252
01:37:28,935 --> 01:37:30,844
I'd rot before I'd serve him.

1253
01:37:31,719 --> 01:37:34,719
I'd sink this ship with all hands
before I'd serve him.

1254
01:37:34,791 --> 01:37:37,758
lt would appear then
that my crew is still a little dubious...

1255
01:37:37,831 --> 01:37:40,132
as to the merits of His Majesty's offer.

1256
01:37:40,327 --> 01:37:43,294
However you hate the King,
England is still England.

1257
01:37:43,431 --> 01:37:46,529
And a bad king is bad king,
and worse one if he's James.

1258
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:49,824
James?
This commission is sent by King William.

1259
01:37:50,791 --> 01:37:54,140
King William? Who may King William be
and what's he king of?

1260
01:37:54,215 --> 01:37:57,346
I'm alluding to His Majesty,
King William III, William of Orange...

1261
01:37:57,415 --> 01:38:00,990
who, with Queen Mary,
has come over from the Netherlands...

1262
01:38:00,167 --> 01:38:03,265
and has been ruling England
the past two months or more.

1263
01:38:05,607 --> 01:38:08,738
They've roused themselves at home
and kicked out that pimple James?

1264
01:38:08,807 --> 01:38:11,425
Yes, and he's fled to France
and he's in hiding there...

1265
01:38:11,495 --> 01:38:13,470
and England and France are at war.

1266
01:38:13,575 --> 01:38:16,357
The English people will go so far,
Capt. Blood...

1267
01:38:16,423 --> 01:38:19,238
and then they get up
on their stubborn hind legs.

1268
01:38:19,303 --> 01:38:21,507
-And William sent us this commission?
-Yes.

1269
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:25,766
He knows you're good men,
wrongfully sold into slavery.

1270
01:38:25,831 --> 01:38:28,995
He can use good men in his navy.

1271
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:31,700
lt's the long-winded fellow you are.

1272
01:38:31,143 --> 01:38:33,729
Why didn't you tell us this
in the first place?

1273
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:37,534
Bugler, summon the men amidships!

1274
01:38:46,407 --> 01:38:49,952
Men!
I've just heard a startling piece of news.

1275
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:54,146
King James is kicked out of England
and good King William reigns in his stead.

1276
01:38:57,927 --> 01:39:01,910
For me,
this changes the shape of the world.

1277
01:39:01,383 --> 01:39:03,391
For you who were slaves with me...

1278
01:39:03,463 --> 01:39:05,635
it means that we're no longer slaves.

1279
01:39:05,703 --> 01:39:08,604
That we once more have
a home and a country.

1280
01:39:08,935 --> 01:39:10,429
For you who are English...

1281
01:39:10,502 --> 01:39:13,220
it means a chance to fight
for your native land...

1282
01:39:13,287 --> 01:39:16,734
for I now propose to sail into Port Royal
and take it from the French!

1283
01:39:16,807 --> 01:39:18,716
Those of you who are not English...

1284
01:39:18,919 --> 01:39:21,767
will have to be content
with fighting for Capt. Blood...

1285
01:39:23,655 --> 01:39:26,470
and the loot you'll find
on the French ships.

1286
01:39:27,783 --> 01:39:30,685
-Are you willing to fight, men?
-Aye!

1287
01:39:31,655 --> 01:39:33,892
Have we an English battle flag on board,
Hagthorpe?

1288
01:39:33,959 --> 01:39:37,756
We have every manner of battle flag,
including a lady's purple petticoat.

1289
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:39,746
Wait, I've a better idea.

1290
01:39:39,815 --> 01:39:42,532
When an English lion creeps up
on a nest of French foxes...

1291
01:39:42,599 --> 01:39:43,809
he wears a bushy tail.

1292
01:39:43,879 --> 01:39:47,760
Hoist the French flag, Hagthorpe.
Keep her trimmed by the head, Wolf.

1293
01:39:47,143 --> 01:39:48,288
Stand by the helm, Jeremy.

1294
01:39:48,359 --> 01:39:50,268
Forward, men, to your stations.

1295
01:39:51,207 --> 01:39:53,596
-ls that satisfactory to you?
-Perfectly.

1296
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:04,896
Clear decks for action!

1297
01:40:09,543 --> 01:40:12,577
Capt. Blood's orders.
You'll be put ashore with these men.

1298
01:40:12,646 --> 01:40:14,818
A ship is no place for a woman
in time of battle.

1299
01:40:14,887 --> 01:40:17,254
-I want to talk to him.
-I'm sorry. The Captain's busy.

1300
01:40:17,319 --> 01:40:18,661
-lnto the boat.
-Aye, sir.

1301
01:40:18,727 --> 01:40:20,287
Follow me, Miss Bishop.

1302
01:41:05,735 --> 01:41:07,939
Musketeers, to your stations!

1303
01:41:29,703 --> 01:41:30,880
A French ship.

1304
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:36,804
Hope we get on them
before they discover the trick.

1305
01:41:49,767 --> 01:41:50,846
-Andy.
-Aye, Peter.

1306
01:41:50,918 --> 01:41:53,788
Run to Hagthorpe.
Tell him to fetch all the hot coals.

1307
01:41:53,863 --> 01:41:55,750
-Put them by the guns.
-Hot coals, sir?

1308
01:41:55,814 --> 01:41:58,498
-No questions. Run.
-Aye, aye, sir!

1309
01:42:06,118 --> 01:42:08,900
Stand by ready to fire as soon as
we come amidships.

1310
01:42:09,126 --> 01:42:12,509
Stand ready to fire
as soon as we've come amidships!

1311
01:42:12,967 --> 01:42:14,560
Open your ports!

1312
01:42:47,367 --> 01:42:50,500
Strike that French flag
and hoist our own colors.

1313
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,103
Man your port guns!

1314
01:42:59,430 --> 01:43:00,991
Ready, Hagthorpe?

1315
01:43:03,271 --> 01:43:04,547
Fire!

1316
01:43:17,734 --> 01:43:20,582
Hagthorpe,
give them the hot galley broadside!

1317
01:43:20,646 --> 01:43:23,101
Aye, Peter! Load them, lads!

1318
01:44:06,215 --> 01:44:08,997
Hagthorpe, keep pounding that water line!

1319
01:44:18,246 --> 01:44:20,133
We never miss.

1320
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:39,300
-That's one ship neatly disposed off.
-Now for the other one.

1321
01:44:39,751 --> 01:44:42,468
-Jeremy, helm quarter to port.
-Aye, aye, Peter.

1322
01:44:42,535 --> 01:44:44,950
Clear away that burning wreckage!

1323
01:44:47,175 --> 01:44:49,957
-Port guns, Wolf. Hurry.
-Aye, Peter.

1324
01:44:50,246 --> 01:44:52,385
Man your port guns!

1325
01:45:16,198 --> 01:45:18,849
Those French gunners
must've learnt their trade in England.

1326
01:45:18,919 --> 01:45:20,773
That's their third direct hit.

1327
01:45:30,246 --> 01:45:32,417
Two guns out of order.
Ship's taking water below.

1328
01:45:32,486 --> 01:45:34,428
Replace them with two
from the starboard side.

1329
01:45:34,502 --> 01:45:37,880
-Keep hammering that waterline.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1330
01:45:49,479 --> 01:45:51,650
Lower gun deck's awash, we're sinking.
What should we do?

1331
01:45:51,718 --> 01:45:54,849
Do? We'll board a ship that's not sinking.
Get your men forward.

1332
01:45:54,918 --> 01:45:55,867
Aye, aye, sir.

1333
01:45:58,342 --> 01:46:00,579
-What now, Peter?
-Take the helm yourself, lad.

1334
01:46:00,646 --> 01:46:02,540
Straight into them !

1335
01:46:04,806 --> 01:46:07,741
-We'll never do it, Peter!
-Musketeers to the prow!

1336
01:46:07,814 --> 01:46:11,589
Grappling hooks to larboard. Forward
gunners, fire as hard as they can load!

1337
01:46:15,366 --> 01:46:16,992
Rapid fire, men!

1338
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:19,700
Hagthorpe, double them up!

1339
01:46:19,398 --> 01:46:22,148
They won't take it, Peter!
They're blazing hot!

1340
01:46:30,823 --> 01:46:32,961
Up into the shrouds, men!

1341
01:46:40,326 --> 01:46:42,820
We're going to swing across on ropes.

1342
01:46:42,150 --> 01:46:43,972
When we clear the rail,
come over the side!

1343
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:45,860
Aye, aye, Peter!

1344
01:46:49,767 --> 01:46:51,938
You and your men swing across
into their rigging.

1345
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:54,854
When you see me cut down
that French flag, drop down.

1346
01:46:57,766 --> 01:46:59,741
Up, men, into the shrouds!

1347
01:47:02,438 --> 01:47:04,894
Strong and sure! Grapnels over!

1348
01:47:43,460 --> 01:47:45,468
All right, my hearties, follow me!

1349
01:48:07,942 --> 01:48:09,120
Follow on, men!

1350
01:48:28,102 --> 01:48:30,819
''Dust thou art,
and unto dust thou shalt return.''

1351
01:48:58,151 --> 01:48:59,776
''Love thy neighbor as thyself.''

1352
01:48:59,846 --> 01:49:01,854
Leviticus 19:18.

1353
01:50:39,110 --> 01:50:42,525
-Hurry, Cato. We'll be late.
-Yes. The fleet's in already.

1354
01:50:50,886 --> 01:50:52,860
-Stop!
-Yes.

1355
01:50:56,870 --> 01:50:58,431
Capt. Blood!

1356
01:51:02,374 --> 01:51:03,487
Miss Bishop.

1357
01:51:05,300 --> 01:51:06,917
I'll be on the veranda.

1358
01:51:09,575 --> 01:51:10,916
I thought you'd gone.

1359
01:51:10,982 --> 01:51:12,892
You can't be here.
My uncle's just returned.

1360
01:51:12,966 --> 01:51:14,591
-Yes, I know.
-You know?

1361
01:51:14,662 --> 01:51:16,451
-What are you going to do?
-Just stay here.

1362
01:51:16,518 --> 01:51:18,590
No, it's impossible. You mustn't stay here.

1363
01:51:18,663 --> 01:51:20,702
-He's sworn he'll hang you.
-I doubt he will.

1364
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:22,498
I've always been bad luck for your uncle.

1365
01:51:22,566 --> 01:51:25,665
You can't know the threats he's made.
The dreadful threats he's made.

1366
01:51:25,734 --> 01:51:27,644
His whole life is spent
in searching for you.

1367
01:51:27,718 --> 01:51:30,435
-Now he's found me.
-But you can still save yourself.

1368
01:51:30,502 --> 01:51:32,324
Please, for my sake.

1369
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:36,200
For your sake? What do you mean for your
sake? Isn't it true that you hate me?

1370
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:39,201
-Hate you?
-Or is it that you love me?

1371
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:42,532
I'll hide you.
And tonight after dark, I'll find some way--

1372
01:51:42,598 --> 01:51:44,420
You love me, don't you?

1373
01:51:45,542 --> 01:51:48,477
Whom else would I love? Now will you?

1374
01:51:48,550 --> 01:51:50,770
You love me!

1375
01:51:50,150 --> 01:51:52,517
Lord Willoughby, she loves me!

1376
01:51:54,278 --> 01:51:56,580
He'll be here any minute.
I'll hide you somewhere.

1377
01:51:56,646 --> 01:51:59,670
We'll hide together. I know just the place.

1378
01:52:10,726 --> 01:52:11,903
How's this?

1379
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:14,470
You must be mad. He'll come here first.

1380
01:52:14,118 --> 01:52:15,841
Good. I forgot to tell you.

1381
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:17,916
The Governor and I are
on the best of terms.

1382
01:52:17,989 --> 01:52:20,378
He lets me come and go here
as I please. Look.

1383
01:52:25,862 --> 01:52:28,928
-You can't arrest me!
-I have, by order of the Governor.

1384
01:52:28,998 --> 01:52:31,454
The Governor? You are mad.
I am the governor.

1385
01:52:31,526 --> 01:52:33,566
You mean, you were the governor.

1386
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:36,416
But we've changed that in your absence.

1387
01:52:36,518 --> 01:52:37,664
What?

1388
01:52:37,734 --> 01:52:41,117
You're broken for abandoning your post
in time of war.

1389
01:52:41,382 --> 01:52:42,331
Who are you?

1390
01:52:42,406 --> 01:52:45,602
My name is Willoughby. I'm a special
emissary of His Majesty the King.

1391
01:52:45,702 --> 01:52:46,814
Lord Willoughby?

1392
01:52:46,886 --> 01:52:49,221
-You were informed, I think, of my coming.
-Yes.

1393
01:52:49,286 --> 01:52:52,319
Yet you went off
on some wild goose chase after a pirate...

1394
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:54,757
leaving your capital at the mercy
of the enemy.

1395
01:52:54,822 --> 01:52:57,856
Col. Bishop, this is a serious matter,
as you may well find.

1396
01:52:57,926 --> 01:52:59,933
Seeing that you hold your office
from James...

1397
01:53:00,102 --> 01:53:03,400
it's even possible the charge of treason
lies against you.

1398
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:04,260
But, my lord--

1399
01:53:04,102 --> 01:53:06,852
I'm not concerned to hear
your reasons, man.

1400
01:53:06,982 --> 01:53:09,470
-His Excellency the Governor will.
-The Governor?

1401
01:53:09,542 --> 01:53:11,102
You'll find him inside.

1402
01:53:11,238 --> 01:53:14,210
lt rests entirely with him
whether you're hanged or not.

1403
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:18,780
This is the fault of that scoundrel Blood.

1404
01:53:18,150 --> 01:53:20,517
What a reckoning
there'll be when we meet.

1405
01:53:22,182 --> 01:53:25,794
Have mercy, Your Excellency!

1406
01:53:25,990 --> 01:53:28,357
-Arabella, why are you here?
-Uncle!

1407
01:53:29,862 --> 01:53:32,350
I have been pleading
with the Governor on your behalf...

1408
01:53:32,421 --> 01:53:35,684
asking him to be as merciful
as you would be cruel.

1409
01:53:37,862 --> 01:53:40,928
Uncle, this is the Governor.

1410
01:53:47,142 --> 01:53:49,182
Good morning, Uncle.

1411
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:12,260
English
