1
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:14,990
Pantaleon and the special service

2
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:45,400
Are you sure this is the
man we are looking for?

3
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:50,190
Intelligence investigated his
professional and private life.

4
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,767
He got into the Chorrillos military
school with the best grade.

5
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:55,953
He chose the service corps.

6
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:59,570
Best grades in math, economy
and administration.

7
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:04,375
That's why during his whole carrier he got to
raise the flag every final day of the year.

8
00:02:04,473 --> 00:02:08,434
Since he graduated, 8 years ago,
nobody has equalled his grades.

9
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:14,190
He prefers sports and study to
parties, but he has a social life.

10
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:18,990
After three years of going out,
he married Alfonsina Rea.

11
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,789
She is a decent girl, serious and
a good wife that takes care of her house

12
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:28,600
We have confirmed that
Cpt. Pantoja is no womanizer.

13
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:32,440
Not one escapade in 5 years of marriage.
He doesn't drink nor party

14
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:36,280
Sounds as if you were talking
about a saint, not a soldier.

15
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:38,995
Listen to what cpt. Montes wrote about him.

16
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:43,950
"Born organizer, mathematical sense
of order, executive capacity..."

17
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:50,670
"He leaves fond memories in Chiclayo and I request
for him to be comissioned for one more year..."

18
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:56,276
" to this station, as he conducted the
regiment with inspired efficiency."

19
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,036
This captain is our man, Lez.

20
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:05,073
- Panta, breakfast is ready.
- Coming!

21
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:07,959
- Pocha, Did you sew my galon?
- Yes, my lieutenant!

22
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:10,839
- Did I hear wrong or you said lieutenant?
- Excuse me, my captain.

23
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:15,640
Util I get used to it, you'll be
my little lieutenant, darling.

24
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,559
How beautiful this is!

25
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:21,399
Where do you think they'll send us this time?
I hope they leave us in Lima. And you?

26
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:24,279
I don't care. As long as there is
a quarter is good enough for me.

27
00:03:24,377 --> 00:03:27,890
You and your vocation. You are married
first to the army and then to me.

28
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:30,742
Where would you like to be?
Other than Lima, of course.

29
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:32,108
Chiclayo again. Or Tacna or Piura

30
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:35,800
And the mountains? Or the jungle?
It's a possibility.

31
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:39,640
I hate the mountains. The jungle...
Iquitos could be.

32
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:44,211
It has to be a city, not a camping
ground or some garrison because...

33
00:03:44,313 --> 00:03:46,231
you have to start thinking
about the little cadet.

34
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,273
- I can start dreaming about ordering him, or?
- Now?

35
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:53,070
May be... Or at night
It doesn't matter that it's not saturday.

36
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:57,870
I'm 5 minutes late. And it takes
me about 30 to get to the ministry

37
00:03:57,977 --> 00:04:00,759
that is, if there is no traffic.
- Ok.

38
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:03,640
Let's have breakfast my captain.

39
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:11,320
Good morning ma'am, I am Cpt. Pantoja.
I have an appointment with Gral. Collazos.

40
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,335
He is waiting for you,
together with colonel Lez.

41
00:04:18,552 --> 00:04:20,931
- Congratulations on the new spaghetti.
- Thank you my colonel.

42
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:23,799
- And by the brilliant way you got it.
- Thank you colonel.

43
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:28,599
I was informed about your promotion. You got the
first place by unanimous decision of the jury.

44
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:31,480
- Congratulation Cpt.
- Thank you my general.

45
00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:36,116
Sit down.
Sit down.

46
00:04:38,073 --> 00:04:39,895
- A cigarrette?
- No thanks.

47
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:43,735
You see my general neither a smoker
nor a drunk nor a man of the ladies.

48
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,873
An officer without vices. We already
have somebody to represent

49
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:49,719
our army in paradise, together
with San Mart匤 and St. Rose of Lima.

50
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:55,251
Let's not exagerate. I must have
some vices you don't know about.

51
00:04:55,353 --> 00:04:56,465
We know everything about you.

52
00:04:57,433 --> 00:05:00,280
You would flip if you knew
how much we have investigated you.

53
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,960
Well, let's take the
bull by the horns, then.

54
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:07,960
This matter requires absolute discretion!

55
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:11,636
I am talking about the
mission we will entrust you.

56
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,680
And it's the following, Pantoja:

57
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:18,520
From some time now the
troop in the jungle has been

58
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:23,091
- ... rioutous, excited.
- When we were informed about the problem...

59
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:25,975
we thought they were
isolated cases, manageable.

60
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:28,920
Caused by the climate or
the food in the area.

61
00:05:30,073 --> 00:05:32,920
But it wasn't so.
Things have gone from bad to worse.

62
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:37,710
Gral. Scavino and father Beltr疣,
who has been busting my balls...

63
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:43,000
asking us to do something,
have taken some measures.

64
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:46,839
But up to now, neither punishments
nor lessons have solved the problem

65
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:50,198
That's why we have decided to take more...
radical measures

66
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:52,119
and it's here where you come to work!

67
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:56,691
I am a bit confused. The truth is that...

68
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:58,832
You'll be in charge of
something very important.

69
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:03,630
Gral. scavino will give you all the details
as soon as you reach your destination.

70
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:08,211
You are leaving next monday, Pantoja.
I hope you like the jungle.

71
00:06:08,313 --> 00:06:12,273
You have all my confidence and support
for this dificult and delicate mission.

72
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:16,120
I wish you the best of lucks, Pantoja.

73
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:22,677
And remember, the reputation
of this institution is in your hands.

74
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:39,160
Well, the thing started to work.

75
00:06:41,113 --> 00:06:42,836
But this is useless!

76
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,556
You'll identify these bandits, ladies.

77
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:53,560
- Stop crying.
- Do we have to go out in front of these soldiers?

78
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:59,310
They'll form outside, you peek through the
window and tell when you recognize the one.

79
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:03,160
Take a good look, ladies, take a good look.
Chose.

80
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,213
Which one do you prefer as
father of your children?

81
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,069
Gral. Collazos, my general.

82
00:07:09,913 --> 00:07:11,800
Hello? Tiger, How is it going?

83
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:17,550
OK, OK. I'm going to receive this cpt.

84
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:21,236
But I warn you, I wash my hands
from this whole business!

85
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:27,150
- These strategists at Lima!
- Do they still have this special service in mind?

86
00:07:30,073 --> 00:07:31,960
May god have mercy!

87
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:34,832
Something doesn't smell right.
What does the reputation of the army...

88
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:37,719
have to do with climate,
food and health of the troop.

89
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:40,599
- I don't get it.
- Darling, stop thinking about it.

90
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:44,439
- As soon as you talk to Scavino you'll know.
- Maybe something happened in the jungle.

91
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:47,090
- I'll check the internet.
- Just a little bit, my captain.

92
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:49,975
Now you mission is to
take your wife to the movies...

93
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:52,112
and to buy her sommer clothes
so that she doesn't fry in the jungle.

94
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:54,039
- It's an order.
- Whatever you say my general.

95
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:56,919
Afterwards I'll let you get under
my sheets as a price...

96
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:58,839
and I'll allow you to
caress me at discretion!

97
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,720
Pochita, you are wrinkling
my uniform, honey.

98
00:08:05,593 --> 00:08:07,480
As the guide of the Amazon region, ,,

99
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:13,229
I feel obliged to speak in defence
of all the women of the region.

100
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,120
I am not an antipatriotic, no!

101
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:20,909
But my love for the army doesn't
prevent me from saying the truth:

102
00:08:21,913 --> 00:08:25,491
This wave of rapes that
plagues our region,...

103
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:29,553
terrorizing and dishonoring
our beautiful women,...

104
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:31,479
has a culprit.

105
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:37,069
The rapists are soldiers of our army.

106
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:42,029
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
our own soldiers.

107
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,920
It's painful to admit...

108
00:08:45,913 --> 00:08:48,596
but I have undeniable proof.

109
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:52,600
What is happening with our army?

110
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:56,440
I ask myself: What do the
authorities have to say about this?

111
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:59,320
What does Gral. Scavino have to say...

112
00:09:00,313 --> 00:09:03,891
and what does father Betr疣,
the army chaplain, have to say?

113
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:06,992
They should be lock in a prison for life...

114
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:10,839
for abusive and perverts but
the mercy of our lord is infinite...

115
00:09:10,937 --> 00:09:13,719
and he opens them a door for
their repent and salvation.

116
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:18,520
Soldiers, Do you swear
by God and fatherland...

117
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:22,360
to take these womes as wives,
to honor them...

118
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:26,199
and be faithful until death do you part?

119
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:27,158
Yes, I swear!

120
00:10:07,032 --> 00:10:10,348
Don't worry ma'am, after a couple of
days the mosquitoes don't bite anymore.

121
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:12,279
- They won't even look at you.
- Thanks.

122
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:16,120
Don't stop eating "cecina"
with "tacacho", it's very soft.

123
00:10:18,073 --> 00:10:19,796
Uf! It's so hot!

124
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,611
I can't stand these clothes anymore.

125
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:27,412
You have to get used to this, baby.
This is the coolest season of the year.

126
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:30,512
I hope that in the army compounds they
have air contioned. If not, I die!

127
00:10:30,617 --> 00:10:34,359
It's the first thing I am gonna
ask Scavino. And if not...

128
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:35,951
I'll get one installed for you.

129
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:39,160
Uf! You are all wet. Really wet.

130
00:10:40,152 --> 00:10:42,040
Us human beings sweat when we're hot.

131
00:10:43,992 --> 00:10:46,840
- I'm going to get dry.
- No! It doesn't bother me at all. On the contrary.

132
00:10:50,712 --> 00:10:54,509
- Ok, now we have to unpack.
- Wait, wait, there's no hurry.

133
00:10:56,472 --> 00:10:59,091
- Panta! What are you doing!?
- Take it all off.

134
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,232
- I don't know you anymore!
- Take it all off.

135
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:04,119
You! Always so serious.
Wait, I take it off.

136
00:11:10,872 --> 00:11:12,760
Remember you have a meeting with Scavino

137
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:18,509
You'll fall asleep. You
always fall asleep after...

138
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:26,932
- I want you to know that I disagree
with the service you've come to organize.

139
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:30,993
I don't know what my mission is going to be. Gral.
Collazos told me you would inform me.

140
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:35,800
In a few words: The troop
is fucking the "cholas".

141
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:38,774
Officers don't know what to do anymore
with all the lawsuits for violations.

142
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:42,520
He have asked doctors,
sociologists, sexologists.

143
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:47,091
And after much bla bla bla,
we came to the simple truth.

144
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:50,192
Any soldier that comes to the
jungle becomes a... dick head

145
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:54,989
- I still don't get it. I am not an expert
, but I can't see how...
- Just a second.

146
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:03,640
Cpt. Pantale Pantoja
(Peruvian Army) is entrusted with...

147
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:07,480
the mission of organizing,
implementing and managing

148
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:10,359
a special services of hostesses
for garrisons, border posts...

149
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:13,239
and similars", with the duty of
fulfilling the natural needs of

150
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:15,159
Etc, etc, etc...

151
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:19,960
- Excuse me Gral.
What do you mean with these...

152
00:12:20,952 --> 00:12:23,800
- ... hostesses? Do you mean...?
- Whores.

153
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:25,720
Yes, whores.

154
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:29,560
Gral. Collazos and his Lima strategists...

155
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:32,439
had the great idea of giving
women to the troops.

156
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:35,319
Moving the from one camp to the next
and letting the soldiers fornicate

157
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:41,069
And you, a Captain of the Peruvian Army,...

158
00:12:42,072 --> 00:12:43,960
will serve as the macquereau, a pimp...

159
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:46,839
or however those individuals
that commerce with sex are called.

160
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,680
Excuse me, my general.

161
00:12:51,672 --> 00:12:54,520
But I don't think I'm capable
of carring out this mission.

162
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:58,428
- I beg you to reconsider...
- It's already too late for that. It's an order.

163
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:02,035
- And orders are to be fulfilled.
- I'll try to do the best I can.

164
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,993
- I don't want you to come close to the
headquarters, nor any other dependency in Iquitos.

165
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:10,610
You are excused of attending
any official act,...

166
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:12,534
parades, tedeums, etc.

167
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,640
- And I forbid you to use the uniform.
You'll dress as a civilian.

168
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:18,520
Do I even have to come
to work as a civilian?

169
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:23,157
Your work will be very, very far
away from the headquarters.

170
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:27,156
What logist and material
support can I count on?

171
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:31,960
Lieutenant Bacacorzo has
been designated for that.

172
00:13:32,952 --> 00:13:35,800
He'll be the link between
you and your superiors.

173
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,680
Any other question, Captain?

174
00:13:42,552 --> 00:13:46,349
We won't live in the military compounds nor
will you mingle with the wives of the officers.

175
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:48,279
- Why?
- I'm sorry, chola.

176
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:52,119
We'll pretend we are civilians, I'll be
a trader that's starting a new business

177
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:55,960
What kind of job did they give you?
Why do we have to hide like this?

178
00:13:56,952 --> 00:14:00,749
- I'm talking to you.
- I'm listening, Pantale Pantoja.

179
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,679
Can you explain what all this is about?

180
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:07,469
You promissed we would never
lie to eachother. You promissed.

181
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:09,399
Why don't you want to tell me?

182
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,240
The thing is that I'm going to work...
in intelligence.

183
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:18,040
The intelligence service?

184
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:24,749
Well, then I get all the mistery.
What do you have to find out?

185
00:14:24,857 --> 00:14:27,639
- I can't say anything, those are my orders.
- Pantita, tell me.

186
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:31,479
What do you have to spy? Is there going
to be a war with Brazil or Ecuador?

187
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,360
Does it have to do with the Rio protocol?

188
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:43,960
You have no idea, lieutenant, what it means
to have to hide from my wife...

189
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:45,879
this thing of the mission.

190
00:14:46,872 --> 00:14:50,669
I had never before lied or hidden
anything from her. Never.

191
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:55,480
Many officer would give
anything to be in your shoes.

192
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:59,320
Not me. They up screwed me with this job.

193
00:15:00,312 --> 00:15:04,109
How am I supposed to organize this service
if I had never had contact with prostitutes?

194
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:07,952
- I don't even know where to begin.
- From the beginning captain.

195
00:15:09,752 --> 00:15:13,713
Go to a cathouse, to see how are things.
I recommend you Do Leonor.

196
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:17,560
A.K.A "La Chuchupe"

197
00:15:20,472 --> 00:15:24,269
She wants to give up her business and
her girls will be out of job.

198
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:30,029
I would love to go with you,
but my instructions are very specific.

199
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:52,600
- Hi honey.
- Good evening.

200
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:54,667
- Do you want to dance?
- No.

201
00:16:55,512 --> 00:16:57,400
I'm sorrry... I don't dance.

202
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,199
You like to go to the point, don't you?

203
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:04,119
Me too.

204
00:17:05,112 --> 00:17:07,959
- First get a token by the cashier.
- No, you don't understand.

205
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:11,799
I'm not here to satisfy my instincts.

206
00:17:11,896 --> 00:17:14,679
I come to talk business
with the owner, Mrs. Leonor.

207
00:17:15,672 --> 00:17:18,355
Could you tell her that
I want to speak to her?

208
00:17:19,512 --> 00:17:20,439
Delighted

209
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:24,279
But one thing doesn't prevent the other.

210
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:28,119
Listen. When you're finished talking...

211
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:30,039
look for me.

212
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:33,879
I love serious guys like you.

213
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:08,439
Good evening ma'am.
My name is Pantale Pantoja.

214
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:11,155
Welcome to "Casa Chuchupe".

215
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:14,199
Here we treat good everybody...

216
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:17,879
except those dickheads,
the soldiers, that want to fuck for free.

217
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,919
Tell me, what can I do for you sir?

218
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,798
I would like to talk about
business with you, but in private

219
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:27,639
Does it mean you are kicking me out?

220
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:32,439
- Would you like something to drink?
- A bier and two glasses.

221
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:37,970
The first round is on the house
Or would you prefer something stronger?

222
00:18:38,072 --> 00:18:39,959
No thank you.
I don't drink.

223
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:42,999
Look, I am an entrepreneur...

224
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,879
and I have come to
live here, in Iquitos,...

225
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:48,758
with the idea of
investing in some business.

226
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:52,599
I heard that you want to close yours...

227
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:56,439
and I was thinking...
- To set up a whorehouse?

228
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:02,189
I'll give you some advice.
You look like a decent guy and I like you.

229
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:07,949
Don't get into this, it's a bad thing.
If you want money set up a dinner.

230
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,799
Strange. I had been told that here...

231
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:15,094
there is a lot of demand,
because of the heat and everything.

232
00:19:15,672 --> 00:19:19,469
Yes, but between soldiers and politicians
that get the service and don't pay...

233
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:23,318
the bribes you have to give and
the rent that is higher every month,...

234
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,929
I'm loosing money. The best
is to cut from the root...

235
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,032
and keep the few savings I still
have left for my retirement.

236
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:37,709
The only thing I regret are my girls.
I like some of them a lot.

237
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:40,369
They are good girls, healthy, hard working.

238
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:43,472
Perhaps we can reach a good
agreement for both of us.

239
00:19:43,576 --> 00:19:45,398
If you are interested.

240
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:50,189
Your knowledge, your experience,
that's all very valuable for my plans.

241
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:55,949
If you close your place
I would like to hire you.

242
00:19:56,056 --> 00:19:58,838
- You and some of your girls.
- I'm interested.

243
00:20:18,072 --> 00:20:20,919
Take hookers to the military
posts in the jungle.

244
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:24,758
I would have never thought about something
like that, it's a wonderful idea.

245
00:20:25,752 --> 00:20:29,549
But don't dream Mr. Pantoja. They'll
never let us into the bases.

246
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:31,478
I already have the permission to go in.

247
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:35,319
And don't call them hookers,
nor whores, please.

248
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,192
The appropriate name is "hostesses"

249
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:42,039
You have permission to
go into the barracks?

250
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:44,919
Don't tell me you are a military man!

251
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,799
Of course not.

252
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:51,639
I want you to think very
well about what we talked.

253
00:20:51,736 --> 00:20:54,518
In a couple of days I'll
come with a work proposal.

254
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:58,358
- First...
- I can tell you now. I'll do it! You were sent by heaven.

255
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:03,159
- Sorry, the colombian
wants to speak to you.

256
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:07,959
The colombian? I thought she was out of Iquitos...
What does she want?

257
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:11,799
- Should I tell her to wait?
- No, let me talk to her now.

258
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:14,678
If she is looking for a job,
she came to the wrong place

259
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:17,558
- Would you wait a minute, Don Panta?
- Sure, go ahead.

260
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:24,269
- Is she really colombian?
- Nobody knows. She says so.

261
00:21:25,272 --> 00:21:30,029
She was working outside. Probably came
back because she got into trouble.

262
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:34,829
- She's very atractive.
- Yes, one of the best things you can see around here.

263
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:40,589
But I wouldn't recommend her to you.
She is marked, cursed.

264
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:45,389
Two men already died for her.
A bad thing sir.

265
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:06,519
Well, it was about time.

266
00:22:07,512 --> 00:22:10,359
- It's more the 11.
- Pochita, my head is killing me.

267
00:22:11,352 --> 00:22:14,199
How would it NOT hurt you?
And do you know what?

268
00:22:14,296 --> 00:22:16,118
I'm glad you feel so bad.

269
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:18,998
You came here in broad day light falling stupid!
Don't you remember?

270
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:20,918
Can you lower your voice a bit?

271
00:22:21,912 --> 00:22:24,759
I had never felt so bad. Come to cuddle me.

272
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:28,599
You are going to explain me what
all this is about Pantale. Right Now.

273
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:32,439
- Where were you last night?
- It's a thing of this damned job

274
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:35,318
- It's part of the mission,
you know I hate these things

275
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,119
- You were with women, weren't you!?
- No!

276
00:22:40,216 --> 00:22:42,998
Men only get drunk until
dawn if they are with women.

277
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:46,838
- I am sure you have been!
- That never, Pochita, no!

278
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:50,679
Don't cry, you make me feel
like a criminal and I am not!

279
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:53,558
I never had nor will have eyes
for another woman, you know it.

280
00:22:53,656 --> 00:22:55,478
Then tell me where you were last night.

281
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:05,069
" The undersigning, Cpt. Peruvian
Army, Services, Pantale Pantoja,...

282
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,958
responsibe of organizing
a special service...

283
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:11,798
for garrisons and frontier
posts of the Amazon region

284
00:23:11,896 --> 00:23:14,678
respectfully writes,
greets and informs:...

285
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:20,439
That he took posesion of the location
on the shores of the Itaya river,...

286
00:23:20,536 --> 00:23:23,318
designated by the V region as
headquartes and logistic center.

287
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:28,119
That the two soldiers sent to the service
are already under his command,...

288
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:31,958
Soldiers Sinforoso Caiguas
and Palomino Rioalto,

289
00:23:32,952 --> 00:23:35,799
which were chosen correctly
by the authorities...

290
00:23:35,896 --> 00:23:38,678
by their good behaviour, docility,...

291
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:41,558
and aparent indiference
to the opposite sex,...

292
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:45,398
because, otherwise, the kind or work
and the idiosincrasy of this place...

293
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:49,238
could give way to temptations
and problems for the service.

294
00:23:50,232 --> 00:23:54,029
That the first week, the undersigning
concentrated his time and effort...

295
00:23:54,136 --> 00:23:56,918
in the cleaning and
ordering of the location.

296
00:23:57,016 --> 00:23:59,798
That a week to clean could
be considered excesive...

297
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,638
but the ground was in
unsuitable conditions for use...

298
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:06,518
and, if you allow the
expresion, disgusting:...

299
00:24:06,616 --> 00:24:09,398
As the army had it
abandonned, this deposit...

300
00:24:09,496 --> 00:24:12,278
was used for heterogeneous
and ilegal practices.

301
00:24:13,272 --> 00:24:16,119
The undersigning had to equip
Sinforoso Caiguas and Palomino Rioalto

302
00:24:16,216 --> 00:24:19,958
with the necessary equipment
(attached are receipts Nr. 1, 2 & 3),...

303
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:23,798
so that they, working diligently,
would burn the trash,...

304
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,678
mop the floors and walls,
and desinfect everything with creoline.

305
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:32,439
We have proceeded to
whitewash and paint the walls....

306
00:24:32,536 --> 00:24:34,358
and to clean the external terrain...

307
00:24:34,456 --> 00:24:38,198
and the small dock, that had
severe damage, was repaired.

308
00:24:39,192 --> 00:24:42,039
After all that, I have the
honor to inform, that in 7 days

309
00:24:42,136 --> 00:24:44,918
imposing, in any case, with
work sessions of 10 and 12 hours,...

310
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,798
and neglecting his wife, that
without his help had to deal with...

311
00:24:47,896 --> 00:24:50,514
looking for and setting up a house,...

312
00:24:51,672 --> 00:24:55,468
the undersigning managed to turn the pigpen
he received into an inhabitable place,...

313
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:58,358
simple but ordered, clean
and even pleasant,..

314
00:24:59,352 --> 00:25:02,199
as corresponds to any dependency
of our army, even if clandestine,

315
00:25:02,296 --> 00:25:04,118
as is the one at hand."

316
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:30,039
- Hi, What a miracle, you so early!
- Let me introduce you to Alicia...

317
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:32,918
the neighbour that helped me
to clean this pigpen. Alicita...

318
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:35,798
mi husband, so you see I am not a widow.

319
00:25:35,896 --> 00:25:38,678
Nice to meet you, and thanks for everything.
Excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

320
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:44,439
Well, Pochita, I go.
Let's leave the movies for tomorrow.

321
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:46,358
No, he'll go out again in a while.

322
00:25:47,352 --> 00:25:51,148
- I'll come for you, for the 8'movie, ok?
- Yes.

323
00:25:59,832 --> 00:26:02,679
What do you think? This
will be my new attire.

324
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:06,519
Horrible. I prefer you
with your uniform, Panta.

325
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:11,308
- Are you going out?
- I'd prefer a thousand times to stay here with you...

326
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:16,108
and order the little cadet. Although,
if you want, we can do it now...

327
00:26:16,216 --> 00:26:18,998
- A quicky, don't you want?
- I don't want and I can't

328
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:21,878
I am also going out, I'm going
to the movies with Alicia.

329
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,719
I'm getting jelous of your friend.
You are all the time together.

330
00:26:25,816 --> 00:26:30,518
You disapear every night.
It's you secret job's fault

331
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:34,358
It's as difficult for you as it is for me.
We have to be pacient darling.

332
00:26:36,312 --> 00:26:38,199
Stop that.
Don't change, stay like this.

333
00:26:41,112 --> 00:26:42,999
I like you more everyday.

334
00:26:45,912 --> 00:26:47,799
Panta, I don't know you anymore.

335
00:26:51,672 --> 00:26:55,468
And with those clothes... I feel as if I
was cheating on you with another man.

336
00:26:58,392 --> 00:27:02,188
The voice of "Sinchi".

337
00:27:03,192 --> 00:27:06,988
Good afternoon dear listeners.

338
00:27:07,991 --> 00:27:10,839
Continuing with our moralizing campaign...

339
00:27:10,936 --> 00:27:15,638
and defending the physical
and moral integrity of our women...

340
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:19,249
your server, Sinchi,...

341
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:22,134
invites you to join our crusade...

342
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:25,231
and finally demand to the
authorities an answer,...

343
00:27:25,336 --> 00:27:27,889
clear and strong...

344
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:30,773
about the abuses commited...

345
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:32,911
by unsocial elements of the army.

346
00:27:33,911 --> 00:27:35,799
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,...

347
00:27:35,896 --> 00:27:39,638
we demand exemplary
punishments for the rapists...

348
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:50,039
Good afternoon.

349
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:57,868
You are 7 minutes late.
If you were a member of the service...

350
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,758
I'd fine you with 20 soles.
- I'd pay delighted cpt.

351
00:28:00,856 --> 00:28:03,638
I'd give half of my salary away to
be able to work with the service.

352
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:08,428
I don't recommend it, you'd
have to work 14 hours per day,...

353
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:12,278
including holydays. And even so
we wouldn't be able to satisfy the demand.

354
00:28:13,271 --> 00:28:17,068
The results of the polls in
the barracks are alarming.

355
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:18,999
Uyuyuyuyuy...

356
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:20,919
Look at that captain.

357
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:24,759
The best body in the Amazon

358
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:32,439
Don't tell me you don't
know "the colombian".

359
00:28:33,431 --> 00:28:36,279
Evidently you are getting to
know you ground very fast.

360
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:38,198
I saw her one night at Chuchupe's.

361
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:42,999
Wouldn't you like to have
her under your command?

362
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,918
That monument would make us famous.

363
00:28:45,911 --> 00:28:49,708
Later, maybe. Chuchupe and
Chupito are the one recruting....

364
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:50,852
I don't mess with that.

365
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:55,479
Well, here are the results of the survey.

366
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:57,399
It's alarming.

367
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:03,148
Potential number of users
of the service: 8726?

368
00:29:04,151 --> 00:29:06,039
Number of dispensations...

369
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:07,959
Dispensations?

370
00:29:10,871 --> 00:29:13,719
Monthly dispensation
(average wished per user): 12

371
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:18,508
Which means that to cope with demand,..

372
00:29:18,616 --> 00:29:21,398
We would have to ensure a
monthy average of 104 thousand...

373
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:26,199
712 dispensations.
- 104 000?

374
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:30,039
You're going to need a
battalion of hookers.

375
00:29:31,991 --> 00:29:35,788
- I mean, hostesses.
- With a mean of 20 daily dispensations...

376
00:29:35,896 --> 00:29:38,678
for a hostess of great
quality and output,...

377
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:42,518
working full time and
without delays, we would need

378
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:47,319
2271 prostitutes!?

379
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:49,238
This guy is crazy, nuts.

380
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:52,118
He wants to turn our army into
the biggest brothel of the world.

381
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:54,999
Please, calm down, father.
Let me continue.

382
00:29:56,951 --> 00:30:01,708
221 hostesses. Naturally
imposible at the moment.

383
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:05,559
That's why I propose to start
with a convoy of 5 hostesses...

384
00:30:05,656 --> 00:30:09,398
.. that could carry out 4800
simple dispensations per month,...

385
00:30:09,496 --> 00:30:12,278
in weeks of 6 days, working
full time and no delays.

386
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:17,068
I ask for permission to recruit
Leonor Curilincha, a.k.a Chuchupe,...

387
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:20,918
european woman with huge
experience in the matter,...

388
00:30:21,016 --> 00:30:24,758
and who would act as chief of
staff and responsible for enrolling...

389
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,678
and guarding the female element.

390
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:29,558
This is too much! An insult to our uniform!

391
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:31,478
We should put this guy in jail!

392
00:30:31,576 --> 00:30:35,318
The undesigning requests
authorization to carry out a pilot test

393
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,198
and asks for the permission
from the command to enroll..

394
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:42,038
the first 5 hostesses, that
would earn a salary of...

395
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:44,918
A salary taken from our institution!

396
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:47,799
Gral. Collazos willl never allow it!

397
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:53,548
Caiguas, Rioalto and you will go
to the post to talk to the users...

398
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:56,438
and prepare the locations
for the dispensations.

399
00:30:56,536 --> 00:31:00,278
- Locations, dispensations?
- You have to get used to the new language.

400
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:04,119
Users, are the clients,
locations are the beds,...

401
00:31:04,216 --> 00:31:06,998
dispensations are the fucks
and hostesses are the girls.

402
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:08,918
Isn't it true, Don Panta?

403
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:13,708
- And the candidates?
- Tomorrow, I called 10 girls, you can choose those 5.

404
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:16,598
They are all first quality and trustworthy.

405
00:31:16,696 --> 00:31:18,518
Chuchupe, chupito.

406
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:22,359
I heard you closed your
place. What a pitty.

407
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:27,148
A great loss for the bohemian
night life of our city.

408
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:30,998
What are you going to do now?
Are you thinking about a new business?

409
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:34,839
- Yes, something like that.
- Allow me to introduce myself.

410
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,758
Germ疣 L疼dano Rosales, at your service.

411
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:39,639
I see you are a foreigner.
From the capital?

412
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:43,479
- Pantale Pantoja, good afternoon.
- Welcome to this beautiful land...

413
00:31:43,575 --> 00:31:46,358
where we worship friendship and beauty.

414
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:49,239
Have you been long around here?

415
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:53,079
The friend is a journalist.
He has a radio show: The voice of Sinchi.

416
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:55,959
Yes, my wife listen to it all the time.

417
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:58,838
I hope she likes it.
What brings you here my friend?

418
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:00,759
Big hunt?

419
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:04,599
I am a happily married man.
I came to set up a business.

420
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:10,129
Well, good luck.

421
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:13,239
I wish you lots of
luck in your "businesses".

422
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:16,119
It has been a pleasure.
Until the next occasion.

423
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:22,839
I don't like this guy.
He makes too many questions.

424
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:26,678
He a professional busybody.
Don't worry, he's like that with everybody.

425
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:30,519
- Problems?
- No, excuse my distraction, the thing is...

426
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:34,359
Do you know that guy?
He's from Lima, Pantale Pantoja.

427
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:38,199
- Not at all. Why?
- Don't know, forget about it.

428
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:43,948
Weird character.
What is he doing with Chuchupe?

429
00:32:44,951 --> 00:32:47,799
With the objective of collecting
information for the special service,...

430
00:32:47,895 --> 00:32:51,638
the undersigning carried out and
investigation with some products...

431
00:32:51,735 --> 00:32:54,518
that have, following the local
lore, aphrodisiac properties.

432
00:32:58,391 --> 00:33:02,188
The undersigning decided to
investigate personally during 4 days,...

433
00:33:02,295 --> 00:33:05,078
how can these products affect...

434
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:07,958
the problem that caused and has
maintained the special service.

435
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:14,679
That the consumption of some of
these products had the effect...

436
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:17,558
of an increaseof the sexual appetite and
seminal impulses of the undersigning,...

437
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:20,438
to the point where the bad
touchings and the virile act...

438
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:22,358
took hold of his mind,...

439
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:26,198
with detriment of his power of
concentration, general nervous system,...

440
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,078
and efectivity at the job.
In consequence...

441
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,958
he was forced to request
and obtain from his wife...

442
00:33:32,055 --> 00:33:34,838
an average of 3 intimate
encounters per day,...

443
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:37,718
with her consequent
annoyance and surprise,...

444
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:41,558
as she is not used to this rythm of requirements.
For all the expressed above,...

445
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:44,438
the undersigning requests
that instructions be given out...

446
00:33:44,535 --> 00:33:47,318
prohibit the use of such products...

447
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:50,198
in the frontier posts,
garrisons and similar.

448
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:54,038
The undersigning also
informs that he enrolled...

449
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:55,958
the first group of hostesses,...

450
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,798
a very difficult job as he is still
under the effects...

451
00:33:59,895 --> 00:34:02,678
of long term aphrodisiacs.

452
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:10,194
Thanks cutie. Tell the next one.

453
00:34:15,191 --> 00:34:17,078
And? What did you think?

454
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:19,958
It's more difficul than what I thought.

455
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:22,838
You have to like one more than the rest.

456
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:29,558
- May I?
- Come in darling.

457
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:36,114
Hi.

458
00:34:37,271 --> 00:34:39,158
- Here I am, Don Panta.
- Good morning.

459
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:42,998
- Your name please.
- "Pechuga" (Breast).

460
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:49,718
Luisa C疣epa, single and
with no serious relation.

461
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:52,598
Very well lady.
Show me what you've got.

462
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:08,918
Accepted... Accepted!

463
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,678
Cpt. they are coming.

464
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:19,468
The undersigning, Cpt. Pantale Pantoja,...

465
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,357
salutes and informs as follows:...

466
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:26,198
That the ship lent by the fluvial forces...

467
00:35:26,295 --> 00:35:28,117
arrived to our center in Itaya river.

468
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:32,908
The ship was brought by
subofficer Rodr刕uez Saravia,

469
00:35:33,015 --> 00:35:35,797
who understood the
secret character of the mission.

470
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,518
The pilot test in Horcones...

471
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:45,398
will be carried out in
only 6 days form now.

472
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:49,074
Do Chuchupe, if you please.

473
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,954
The rules are the rules.

474
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:56,908
Gentlemen, the future of the service
depends on the succes of this operation.

475
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:00,758
The girls are ready.
Do you want to see them?

476
00:36:00,855 --> 00:36:02,513
Yes, let them in.

477
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:06,511
Caiguas and Rioalto designed
the clothes of the hostesses.

478
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:09,168
This one is with straps, sir.
What do you think?

479
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:13,232
- And with a zipper, for a quick skining.
- What do you think?

480
00:36:15,191 --> 00:36:18,038
Lalita could have the
clothes a bit tighter,...

481
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,917
to mark her thingies.
- It fits like a glove.

482
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:25,488
The thing is that Lalita has a
streamed body, just fiber, no grease.

483
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:28,591
Start getting fat, then. You know how
the troops like them, big as a house!

484
00:36:28,695 --> 00:36:32,208
Chupito, from today on, doble food rations.

485
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:35,093
Coming back to the uniforms,
do you like them or not?

486
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:36,271
They are very pretty.

487
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:39,252
But is everything going to be green and red?
Even the cards for the fucks...

488
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:42,998
I mean, dispensations,
are made in those colors.

489
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:45,648
Those are the colors of
the special service.

490
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:48,758
Green for the exuberant
beauty of the region.

491
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:52,598
And red for the manly fire
our service will help to placate.

492
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:57,388
I propose that we paint our
finger and toe nails in green.

493
00:36:57,495 --> 00:37:01,968
- Look how pretty!
- And the underwear, also red and green?

494
00:37:02,231 --> 00:37:05,078
- Do you want to see?
- It's not necessary, Pechuga.

495
00:37:06,071 --> 00:37:09,868
Congratulations, you've done
a great job, you can go now

496
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:20,438
Mr. Rodriguez.

497
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:24,278
We won't tolerate any kind of disrespect.

498
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:28,118
If you are not able of controlling your
lower instincts and carry the mission...

499
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:30,997
according to the norms, I'll have
you removed from the service.

500
00:37:33,911 --> 00:37:36,594
- Is that clear?
- Yes sir, clear.

501
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:48,278
Don't worry, Don Panta.
I know Chuchupe..

502
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:52,117
She has the locations and
everything else ready for our arrival.

503
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:54,997
- Everything is going to be fine.
- This is our hour of truth, Chupito.

504
00:38:04,631 --> 00:38:06,354
Very well ladies.

505
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:09,398
We're about to get there.

506
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:13,238
Whenever you want, Don Panta.
We are ready for the... hand-to-hand.

507
00:38:14,231 --> 00:38:16,118
- How do I look?
- You all look fine.

508
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:20,689
There in Horcones,...

509
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:23,798
20 brave soldiers wait for you.
They sacrifice...

510
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:26,677
day after day for their fatherland,
giving away all the conforts...

511
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:28,597
and basic needs one is used to.

512
00:38:28,695 --> 00:38:31,477
Some of them have months
without looking at a woman.

513
00:38:32,471 --> 00:38:36,268
This is only a pilot test
but we'll carry it out with patriotism

514
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:40,117
and lots of commitment
and sacrifice. I assure you...

515
00:38:40,215 --> 00:38:42,997
that the special service will grow
through the whole region of the Amazon

516
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:45,877
bringing joy and consolation
to our hardworking soldiers.

517
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:49,718
Let's do three hurrays.

518
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:52,598
For the special service...

519
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:56,437
and for our glorious armed forces.

520
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,357
Hip, hip, ra!
Hip, hip, ra!

521
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:05,078
We are there, Don Panta.
Get ready for the landing.

522
00:39:05,175 --> 00:39:08,274
Go ahead, ladies, show these
soldiers what you are capable of!

523
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:12,748
- Let's go, damn, squeeze them
until they beg for mercy!

524
00:39:31,031 --> 00:39:32,918
Silence!

525
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:47,318
Come on, Sandra, hurry up, hurry up.

526
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:51,158
Iris, Iris.

527
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:55,957
At 16:05 our hostesses occupied their...

528
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:59,797
posts. Lalita and Pechuga
stayed at the groceries deposit.

529
00:39:59,895 --> 00:40:02,677
Iris at the nursery, Sandra
in the radio station...

530
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,597
and Vanesa in the dinning room.

531
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:06,517
Back! Back, back, back!

532
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:13,228
I don't need to remind you that
is you job to show these ladies...

533
00:40:13,335 --> 00:40:17,077
that the soldiers that serve our fatherland,
also know how to behave like men!

534
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:20,918
They are all yours, sir.

535
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:22,957
The instructions are the following!

536
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:28,588
1. Each user can stay a
maximum of 20 minutes...

537
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:32,437
That's the longest time
according to the rules.

538
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:38,188
2. The users have the right to one
dispensation, normal and simple,

539
00:40:38,295 --> 00:40:41,077
which means that soldiers
must leave the location as soon...

540
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:44,917
as the dispensation is over.
It is strictly forbiden...

541
00:40:45,015 --> 00:40:47,797
under punishment of expulsion,

542
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:51,637
to request sexual perversions like...

543
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:54,517
manual or oral masturbation, sodomy...

544
00:40:55,511 --> 00:40:57,398
the so called black kiss...

545
00:40:57,495 --> 00:41:00,277
and other extravagances
not worth mentioning.

546
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:04,118
Finally, the users that wait,...

547
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:07,958
must keep absolute silence and order...

548
00:41:08,055 --> 00:41:10,837
so as to not disturb the fellows in action.

549
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:13,718
- Understood!?
- Understood!

550
00:41:14,711 --> 00:41:19,467
- Give the order to start.
- First row, go ahead!

551
00:41:27,191 --> 00:41:29,078
- 4 minutes, 46 seconds.
- Next!

552
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:32,918
Hey! Hey!

553
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:36,758
6 minutes 11 seconds.

554
00:41:36,855 --> 00:41:40,597
So far no one has reached the maximum.

555
00:41:40,695 --> 00:41:43,477
These marks are only a general indicator.

556
00:41:43,575 --> 00:41:47,317
Due to the isolation of the posts,
the users have virile impatience...

557
00:41:47,415 --> 00:41:51,157
kept during a long time.
- Some have been here for months.

558
00:41:51,255 --> 00:41:54,037
You see? That's why they
are so abnormaly fast.

559
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:59,787
This one has the record.
2 minutes 22 seconds.

560
00:42:00,791 --> 00:42:03,638
- What do you think?
- Whe are going to have to consider the prolonged

561
00:42:03,735 --> 00:42:06,517
abstinence variable in our
future calculations. Yes.

562
00:42:06,615 --> 00:42:10,357
A success. A complete success.
Everything worked...

563
00:42:10,455 --> 00:42:14,197
with the greatest order and
in the times assigned.

564
00:42:14,295 --> 00:42:17,077
Besides, Pantoja managed to save 18%...

565
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:19,957
of the amount we gave for the test.

566
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:23,797
The commander, Santana, sent
a very complimentary report...

567
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:26,677
congratulating the special service.

568
00:42:26,775 --> 00:42:29,557
He wants it to start working
as soon as posible.

569
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,398
Enough, Lez. Everything is clear.
Well, write then,

570
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:39,147
Let it be know to the chief commander
of the V region, Gral. Roque de Scavino,

571
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:42,037
that the special service

572
00:42:42,135 --> 00:42:46,837
is authorized to carry out the
mission for which it was created.

573
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:50,671
10 000? 10 000 weekly?

574
00:42:51,671 --> 00:42:54,518
You are mad!

575
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:58,357
No my Gral. it's a scientific statistic.
Look at these graphs.

576
00:42:58,711 --> 00:43:01,231
It's a very careful calculation...

577
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:06,987
and actually conservative.
Look, the 10000 weekly dispensations...

578
00:43:07,095 --> 00:43:09,877
correspond to the primary
psycobiological needs.

579
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:13,718
If we were to completely
satisfy the needs of the soldiers...

580
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:16,597
the amount would be 53200
weekly dispensations.

581
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:19,477
Who put this aberration into your head?

582
00:43:19,575 --> 00:43:24,277
Who told you you can only
be satisfied as a man fornicating!

583
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:27,157
The best sexologists, biologists
and psycologists, father.

584
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:31,947
I've told you to call me major, damn!
- Excuse me major.

585
00:43:32,055 --> 00:43:34,837
You'll allow me to show
you some material...

586
00:43:34,935 --> 00:43:39,637
with excerpts from
the austrian Freud,...

587
00:43:39,735 --> 00:43:42,517
Virgil Stekem, whose nationality was not...

588
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:46,357
in the consulted enciclopedia,
the popular magazine

589
00:43:46,455 --> 00:43:50,197
"Selections", and Dr. C.A.
Segu・ our countryman.

590
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:54,038
Nevertheless, if you prefer to see
the book directly, I have some...

591
00:43:54,135 --> 00:43:57,877
of them in the small library of the center.
- There I wanted to get!

592
00:43:57,975 --> 00:44:01,717
I have been informed that you
distribute pornography to the soldiers.

593
00:44:01,815 --> 00:44:05,557
I know it well. In Borja,
you helper, this dwarf...

594
00:44:05,655 --> 00:44:07,477
gave away that filth.

595
00:44:07,575 --> 00:44:11,317
" Two nights of pleasure", "Life, passion
and death of Maria the Tarantula",...

596
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,197
" Julia and the horse", "Sit
here, I'll go in there",...

597
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:17,071
"Superass".
- Yes, sir.

598
00:44:17,175 --> 00:44:19,957
It was an idea from my
helper that I decided to try.

599
00:44:20,055 --> 00:44:22,837
And as a result we accelerated
the erection of the soldiers.

600
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:25,717
And thus we where able to save time.
Now we do it regularly.

601
00:44:25,815 --> 00:44:28,597
So it wasn't once, nor the
idea of this satanic dwarf!

602
00:44:28,695 --> 00:44:32,437
The special service gives
pornography to the soldiers.

603
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:36,278
We just lend the magazines.
We have no budget to give them away.

604
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:39,157
But I assure you, Gral. that
the result has been positive.

605
00:44:39,255 --> 00:44:42,997
The soldiers that reads while waiting...

606
00:44:43,095 --> 00:44:45,877
finishes betwen 2 and 3
minutes before one that doesn't read.

607
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:49,717
These saving have allowed us
to reach the 500 weekly dispensations

608
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:53,557
with only 5 hostesses.
- I'll have to listen to everything before I die! God!

609
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,438
Allow me to leave Gral.

610
00:44:56,535 --> 00:44:58,357
I understand you father.

611
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:04,107
- Finish you report at once!
- The situation of the service is dramatic.

612
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:07,957
We a lot of effort we have
reached the 500 dispensations

613
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:11,797
But we are over-requested.
They call us by phone, radio...

614
00:45:11,895 --> 00:45:14,677
Pantoja, I am going to complain
to the command of the V region!

615
00:45:14,775 --> 00:45:18,517
You are discriminating us!
The garrison of Santiago river...

616
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:21,397
receives a convoy each week
and us only once per month.

617
00:45:21,495 --> 00:45:26,197
Do you think 2 hostesses can
serve 130 soldiers and 18 officers?

618
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,987
What the fuck is going on!
My people has been since 3 weeks...

619
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,877
waiting for the convoy! The days go by!

620
00:45:33,975 --> 00:45:36,757
We need to grow.

621
00:45:36,855 --> 00:45:39,637
I am waiting for the
authorization of Gral. Collazos...

622
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:42,517
to increase the unit to 10 hostesses.

623
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:45,397
Collazos has informed me about
your request and he ordered me...

624
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:48,277
to make you come to
listen personally to your report.

625
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:53,067
- But you know very well that...
- I know what you think about me, Gral.

626
00:45:53,175 --> 00:45:55,957
but... Do you have an answer?

627
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,798
The army wants us to
continue with our service.

628
00:45:59,895 --> 00:46:03,637
- Do you mean we can count on more girls?
- Only 5 for now.

629
00:46:03,735 --> 00:46:06,517
Tomorrow I want you to bring
10 girls to choose 5.

630
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:09,397
Actually 4, because I already
have thought of one.

631
00:46:10,711 --> 00:46:12,598
The colombian.

632
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,078
I respect whatever you say,
but I don't think it 's a good idea.

633
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:20,917
- That woman is very difficult.
- And dangerous.

634
00:46:21,015 --> 00:46:24,757
I have thought very well about it.
I am ready to run the risk.

635
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:29,547
The gains she could bring to
the service justify the decision.

636
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:35,307
In any case, if she fits into the
system, fine, if not, we take her off.

637
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:37,237
We don't lose anything.

638
00:46:37,335 --> 00:46:42,037
You are shameless!- They are low lifes, I know.
But what can I do?

639
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:45,877
- You even accept it as something normal!
- How can I deny it if you saw me?

640
00:46:45,975 --> 00:46:49,717
- This has to do with my job. My mission...
- I am sick and tired of that mission!

641
00:46:49,815 --> 00:46:53,557
Just let me know that
you have gone with that wh...

642
00:46:53,655 --> 00:46:56,437
Calm down, darling. I swear
nothing is going to happen.

643
00:46:56,535 --> 00:46:59,317
- That woman...
- I could have thought anything,...

644
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:06,987
but that you, always so decent,
serious, hard working...

645
00:47:07,095 --> 00:47:10,837
would go with that parrot
and that horrible dwarf...

646
00:47:10,935 --> 00:47:12,822
That you would become a...!

647
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,598
The only thing I can promise is to
be seen as little as I can around them

648
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:21,387
I am very sorry but that is part of my job.

649
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:25,238
The letters are too little for my taste.

650
00:47:25,335 --> 00:47:29,077
Why don't you paint the
background yellow, like the Eva

651
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,867
Don Panta likes it that way,
like the uniforms of the girls.

652
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,718
Did you see? He loved it!
And what do you think about the name?

653
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:42,507
I don't know I would
have preferd Geraldine.

654
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,318
- it's more poetic.
- Geraldine?

655
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:52,118
Hey, look. There they are.
The new girls.

656
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:13,227
Assorted, Don P., a show of bone and meat.
You can eat at your pleasure!

657
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:17,077
I asked you for 10, you brought 20.
I can't be the whole day examining.

658
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:19,957
The voice spread out
and women came like flies!

659
00:48:20,054 --> 00:48:22,837
From all neighbourhoods.
They even came from San Juan de Munich!

660
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:26,677
- It's not my fault, Don Panta.
- Well, let's get those 5.

661
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,558
Didn't the colombian come?

662
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,307
She must be in the toilet, sir.
There she is Don Juan.

663
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,747
Make them form in a line and
send them in with their cards.

664
00:48:48,854 --> 00:48:51,637
Let's start with the colombian.
- Aha.

665
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,438
Hurry up! We don't have all day.

666
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,357
Fast! Everybody forms a line!
There you go!

667
00:48:58,454 --> 00:49:02,197
Did you finish filling out your cards?

668
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,238
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

669
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,078
So this is the famous "Pantiland".

670
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,062
I couldn't imagine how it would be like.

671
00:49:31,158 --> 00:49:35,795
- The famous what?
- "Pantiland" That's how everybody calls this place.

672
00:49:35,894 --> 00:49:39,637
- Funny name, isn't it?
- If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you to...

673
00:49:39,734 --> 00:49:43,477
refer to this place as the
logistic center. No Pantiland.

674
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,318
- Did Chupito explained you
why I made you come? - Yes.

675
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:52,107
She told me you would inform me...

676
00:49:52,214 --> 00:49:54,997
about the pay and the obligations.

677
00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:01,707
Yes, it would be 3 weekly convoys and a
minimum of 10 dispensations per convoy.

678
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,518
A convoy is a trip to the barracks?
- Genau.

679
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:11,318
So... the dispensations must be...

680
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,877
You'll get 50%...

681
00:50:21,974 --> 00:50:24,757
of what the soldiers pay.

682
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:28,597
The rest is invested in maintenance.
It's all explained here.

683
00:50:31,574 --> 00:50:36,277
Now If you don't mind, and
maybe it's not necesary in your case,...

684
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:39,157
I have to follow the rules.

685
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:42,037
Here.

686
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:57,387
- Here? -Yes.
- Could you take your dress of, please.

687
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:04,107
What a pitty, I have my "visit",
but if you don't mind...

688
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,797
What is wrong?
Would you prefer to do it somewhere else?

689
00:51:11,894 --> 00:51:14,033
It's just a physical exam.

690
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:17,557
You have a hot imagination, lady.

691
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:22,357
Ah. I was thinking where
everything was going to be...

692
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,236
if there isn't even a carpet. Or?

693
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:30,037
And? Do you like me?

694
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,747
I'm a bit skinny, but in one
week I gain back my weight

695
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,597
- You are very fine.
- So, You like me?

696
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:44,437
You are approved, you can get dressed.

697
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:46,357
Thanks

698
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:52,107
- When do you want me to start working?
- Tomorrow, report...

699
00:51:52,214 --> 00:51:55,956
a t 8:00 in the Clothing
Department to get your uniform.

700
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:00,747
- Clothing department?
- Ground floor, Chupito will show you.

701
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,597
Could you help me with the zipper, please?

702
00:52:04,694 --> 00:52:06,516
It's stuck.

703
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:22,837
Fine.

704
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,677
What are you doing? Leave me!

705
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:31,467
- What is going on?
- I have to tell you two things.

706
00:52:31,574 --> 00:52:34,356
You can't use first names.
You have to refer to me as Mr. Pantoja...

707
00:52:34,454 --> 00:52:37,236
as the rest of the hostesses. Second,...

708
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:40,116
never again have this
type of behavior with me.

709
00:52:40,214 --> 00:52:42,996
Ok, but your pants were
swollen up, Don Panta.

710
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:47,797
I didn't want to offend you,
I just wanted to do you a favor.

711
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,597
Forgive me.

712
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:56,437
Do you forgive me?

713
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,277
Ok, never do it again.

714
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:04,117
And now, please leave, I
have other things to do.

715
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,877
Yes, sir.

716
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,197
See you tomorrow.

717
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:46,347
- Do you still have a lot to do?
- No, this is the last one.

718
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:53,067
Pechuga, 1 528 dispensations,
first trimester.

719
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:57,867
Panta, Does you work have anything
to do with food provisions?

720
00:53:57,974 --> 00:54:00,756
- Pochita, please...

721
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:03,636
This are secret documents.
You know I can't tell you.

722
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:06,516
But you are working so
much lately, darling.

723
00:54:06,614 --> 00:54:09,396
You are out the whole day and
you bring your work to bed.

724
00:54:09,494 --> 00:54:13,236
Things are moving faster than we espected.
I'll be ready in a minute.

725
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:16,116
I have to send this report to
Lima before I leave on mission.

726
00:54:16,214 --> 00:54:19,956
This months you have been more
than 10 times away from Iquitos. - 12 times

727
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,157
Hey! Look there.

728
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:02,197
We want women!!

729
00:55:02,294 --> 00:55:05,076
We are also machos, damn!

730
00:55:05,174 --> 00:55:08,916
You want them all for you!
We also want them!

731
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:17,547
They are just the natives.
But they found out we were coming.

732
00:55:17,654 --> 00:55:21,396
I don't like this Chuchupe.
If it becomes public...

733
00:55:21,494 --> 00:55:24,276
the kind of service we give,
it would be the end.

734
00:55:24,374 --> 00:55:27,156
Don't worry, Don Panta.
Nobody is going to find out.

735
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:34,837
"The voice of Sinchi"

736
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:39,627
Program produced and
directed by your friend,...

737
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:43,476
Don German Laucha Dorsales, "El Sinchi".

738
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:48,267
Good evening, dear listeners.

739
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:54,036
I beg you to send your
children away from the radio...

740
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:57,876
because,

741
00:55:57,974 --> 00:56:01,716
I will have to talk crude facts...

742
00:56:01,814 --> 00:56:04,596
and call things by their name.

743
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:11,307
PROSTITUTION! My dear listeners.

744
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:15,157
An ingenious system of carnal traffic...

745
00:56:15,254 --> 00:56:18,996
through the sacred rivers of our Amazon.

746
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:24,747
A movile and motorized
whorehouse, called "Pantiland",...

747
00:56:24,854 --> 00:56:27,636
is hiddenly sending...

748
00:56:27,734 --> 00:56:33,397
its sinful and inmoral services
to the quarters of our fatherland.

749
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:38,187
We have been informed by
many letters and telephone calls.

750
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:42,036
- Hello?

751
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:45,877
- Yes, father, I am listening.
We talk later.

752
00:56:45,974 --> 00:56:49,716
they have seen many times
this group of shameless mermaids...

753
00:56:49,814 --> 00:56:54,516
navigating through the
main rivers in the area...

754
00:56:54,614 --> 00:56:59,316
in direction to the garrisons
and posts of the Amazon.

755
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:06,027
And I ask: Who is behind
this industry of sin...

756
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:09,876
that flourishes under the
very eye and pacience of the authorities?

757
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:14,677
Nothing will stop our
cruzade for the progress...

758
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:20,427
moral, culture and
peruvian patriotism of the Amazon.

759
00:57:20,534 --> 00:57:24,276
The moment has arrived
when whe have to unmask the world

760
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,156
And just like the apostle
with the dragon,...

761
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,997
cut its head by one stroke!

762
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,797
We still don't know who presides...

763
00:57:35,894 --> 00:57:39,636
this industrial complex of
hustlers of "Pantiland".

764
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,477
But your faithful servant
sets himself to investigate...

765
00:57:43,574 --> 00:57:46,356
and reveal the identities
of the responsible...

766
00:57:46,454 --> 00:57:49,236
Fall who may!

767
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:59,786
- How did I do, Paquito?
- And earthquake, master, an earthquake!

768
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,597
Gral. Scavino is really pissed off
because of those declarations...

769
00:58:04,694 --> 00:58:07,476
of Sinchi in the radio.
You can imagine how is Father Beltr疣.

770
00:58:07,574 --> 00:58:10,356
He has all the reason to be worried.

771
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:13,236
People are starting to
talk about the service.

772
00:58:13,334 --> 00:58:16,173
As long as we grow it will be more
and more difficult to keep the secret...

773
00:58:16,214 --> 00:58:19,956
of this mission. And now this...
journalist that...

774
00:58:20,054 --> 00:58:23,796
meanaces with investigating.
This guy wants a bite of the cake, Cpt.

775
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:27,637
If he bothers too much, just give
him a bit of money and matter solved.

776
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,426
Pay him? No, I don't
deal with blackmailers.

777
00:58:32,534 --> 00:58:34,421
I've never done it and never will.

778
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,717
Good morning.

779
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:53,557
What are you doing here so early.
The appointment was at 9.

780
00:58:53,654 --> 00:58:56,436
Excuse me, Don Panta, but...

781
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:59,316
I needed to talk a minute with you.

782
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:01,301
- Please.
- What is it about?

783
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:06,030
I ask you not to smoke here.

784
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,517
Well, tell me. Any problem?

785
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,277
- It's about you, Don Panta.
- About me?

786
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:28,117
I think you have something
against me and I don't know why.

787
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:31,950
- What do you mean?
- That you won't see me nor talk to me.

788
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,757
I would even say that my
presence bothers you.

789
00:59:36,854 --> 00:59:39,636
You are mistaken.

790
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:43,477
I treat you in the same way
I treat the rest of the hostesses.

791
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:46,357
Can I be honest with you, Don Panta?

792
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:57,866
- I think you treat me that way to make
me fall in love with you. - What!?

793
00:59:57,974 --> 01:00:00,756
I remind you I am a married man.

794
01:00:00,854 --> 01:00:03,636
Just as most of the guys
I sleep with, Don Panta.

795
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:07,477
- Being married is no reason for a man to...
- Well, for me is a reason...

796
01:00:07,574 --> 01:00:10,356
more than enough and it should be for you too.
- You see?

797
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:13,237
You see how I was right?

798
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:16,117
I just talk to you and you start to boil.

799
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:21,877
But you know what? I like that.

800
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:27,637
The thing is that I am like the crabs.

801
01:00:27,734 --> 01:00:30,516
I like to go against the current, so...

802
01:00:30,614 --> 01:00:35,316
if you trash me around I am going to fall in love with you.
- I don't recomend it.

803
01:00:40,149 --> 01:00:43,946
" To mix work with pleasure,
is the worst measure"

804
01:00:46,869 --> 01:00:50,666
That is something very difficult
to do in our profession, Don Panta.

805
01:00:50,774 --> 01:00:52,661
You know very well what I'm talking about.

806
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:56,437
Do you feel anything when
you see us in the sun?

807
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:00,277
That would be horrible.

808
01:01:00,374 --> 01:01:03,156
I warn you, I am a decent man, not a moron.

809
01:01:03,254 --> 01:01:05,076
Don't make a mistake.

810
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:08,917
I love it when you take
out your agresive side.

811
01:01:09,909 --> 01:01:11,797
You look cute.

812
01:01:14,709 --> 01:01:16,597
Here, get dry.

813
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:19,477
Thanks

814
01:01:22,389 --> 01:01:25,237
I don't think you are a moron.

815
01:01:27,189 --> 01:01:30,037
But I do think you are just
holding back you desire.

816
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:43,477
I can't deny that you are a very...
attractive woman.

817
01:01:44,469 --> 01:01:47,317
And don't think I am indiferent
to your charm, but...

818
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:50,197
it is not possible.

819
01:01:51,189 --> 01:01:53,077
Not even once?

820
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:56,917
Not even a little bit curious?

821
01:01:58,869 --> 01:02:01,717
If you order me...
- I can't give you that type of orders. I would be...

822
01:02:01,814 --> 01:02:03,636
abusing my authority.

823
01:02:04,629 --> 01:02:06,517
There wouldn't be anything wrong with that.

824
01:02:08,469 --> 01:02:11,317
You have the right to
check the goods you offer.

825
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:18,026
It would be something like...
certifying quality.

826
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:24,757
Please, go away.

827
01:02:25,749 --> 01:02:28,597
And I don't want you to
mention this matter again.

828
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:42,037
The thing is that they've
told you bad things about me...

829
01:02:43,029 --> 01:02:44,917
and you are afraid of me.

830
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:48,757
But I am not the way you think.

831
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:02,197
No, don't be unfair.

832
01:03:02,294 --> 01:03:05,076
You know very well I would
love to spend more time with you.

833
01:03:05,174 --> 01:03:08,916
Yes, to order the little cadet.
Can't you think about something else?

834
01:03:09,014 --> 01:03:11,796
- Don't you like to do things?
- Let go, please!

835
01:03:11,894 --> 01:03:14,676
Sorry, darling, but your neck!

836
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:19,477
I know what is waiting for me at home.

837
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:22,357
What is going on?

838
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:24,277
Hey!

839
01:03:26,229 --> 01:03:30,026
Oh God gratious.
Don't look, you like to look.

840
01:03:30,134 --> 01:03:32,916
- You are such a pervert!
- Come on, walk.

841
01:03:33,014 --> 01:03:35,796
Doing these things in
public is too much, Panta.

842
01:03:39,669 --> 01:03:40,597
Go ahead.

843
01:03:43,509 --> 01:03:48,266
- Good morning. Did you call me?
- Sit down.

844
01:03:57,909 --> 01:04:00,757
I have called you to
remind you the rules...

845
01:04:00,854 --> 01:04:04,596
and your obligation to
respect it. Here is a copy.

846
01:04:04,694 --> 01:04:08,436
Study it again and if you
have questions, ask.

847
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:16,106
Are you angry with me?
- You even dare to ask!?

848
01:04:16,214 --> 01:04:18,996
After the vulgar show you
offered in the street?

849
01:04:19,094 --> 01:04:21,876
Now I get it. Yes.

850
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:25,717
It's about yesterday at the pier.

851
01:04:27,669 --> 01:04:30,517
- Don't tell me you're jelous.
- The rules clearly state that...

852
01:04:30,614 --> 01:04:33,396
a hostess is no whore.
And last night you were...

853
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:36,276
behaving like a comon prostitute.
- The rules...

854
01:04:36,374 --> 01:04:39,156
don't ban going out with a friend, Don Panta.
- One doesn't behave...

855
01:04:39,254 --> 01:04:42,036
like that with a friend. So,
for the good name of the service,...

856
01:04:42,134 --> 01:04:44,916
i would prefer that you don't see
this subject any more. Thank you.

857
01:04:45,013 --> 01:04:46,836
He's not a subject.

858
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:52,586
His name is Nicol疽 Lobat.
And he wants to marry me.

859
01:05:00,309 --> 01:05:02,197
If that is what you want...

860
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,037
But...

861
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:08,917
Think very well about it, please.

862
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:12,757
I have to remind you, that if you mary...

863
01:05:13,749 --> 01:05:17,546
you'll have to go. We can't
take married women here.

864
01:05:21,429 --> 01:05:23,317
He's the one that wants to get married.

865
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:29,066
I just want a bit of affection...
and protection.

866
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:32,917
I have that right, don't I?

867
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:34,836
I suppose so.

868
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:40,586
Excuse me. I think I've been unfair to you.

869
01:05:40,693 --> 01:05:43,476
Don't worry, I am used to that.

870
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:44,501
Olga.

871
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:48,277
You are a very strange person...

872
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:52,117
I don't understand you.

873
01:05:53,109 --> 01:05:55,957
- You should do something else.
- You too.

874
01:05:58,229 --> 01:06:00,750
This work is not for you, Don Panta.

875
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:06,506
You don't even dare to taste your
hostesses like any other would do.

876
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:09,397
Excuse me.

877
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:13,237
Miss,...

878
01:06:15,189 --> 01:06:17,077
wait.
- Yes?

879
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,956
Do you still want to volunteer...

880
01:06:20,949 --> 01:06:24,746
to do a quality control?

881
01:06:24,853 --> 01:06:27,636
Yes, of course.

882
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:35,306
I have to inform you that
this test will only be done once.

883
01:06:36,309 --> 01:06:39,157
It's strictly secret and laboral.

884
01:06:41,109 --> 01:06:43,629
I don't want you to get
confused, Miss Olga.

885
01:06:43,989 --> 01:06:46,837
The only motivation for these controls...

886
01:07:11,089 --> 01:07:13,937
- One, Pechuga. -Two, Sandra.
- Three, Iris.

887
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:16,816
- Four, Lalita.
- Five, Vanesa. -Six, Colombiana.

888
01:07:16,914 --> 01:07:18,801
- Seven, Coca
- Eight, Salom・

889
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:21,610
- Nine, Pichuza.
- Ten, Peludita.

890
01:07:21,714 --> 01:07:25,456
- Entire and complete, Mr. Pantoja.
- Working day plan?

891
01:07:25,554 --> 01:07:29,296
Three convoys. Two 48-hours-long and
another one coming back tonight.

892
01:07:29,394 --> 01:07:32,176
I did the draw with the sticks,
don Panta.

893
01:07:32,274 --> 01:07:35,056
The first convoy of 3 girls to Puerto
America camp by Morona river.

894
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:36,673
Rioalto is feeding Dalila so
we can depart immediately

895
01:07:36,674 --> 01:07:39,456
Don't let Chupito
drive.

896
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:42,336
- She's always screwing up, don Panta.
- 20 soles fine...

897
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:45,216
to Peludita for talking
without permision.

898
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:50,006
- What else do we have?
- Convoys 2 and 3 leave at "El Eva".

899
01:07:50,114 --> 01:07:53,856
In number two: Lalita, Vanesa
and La colombiana.

900
01:07:53,954 --> 01:07:56,736
I lead the harness Bolognetti
at Masane river.

901
01:07:56,834 --> 01:08:00,576
The way back journey planned for
thrusday noon, Mr. Pantoja.

902
01:08:00,674 --> 01:08:04,416
Good. Start boarding.
And be good...

903
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:07,296
like it should be,
and remember...

904
01:08:07,394 --> 01:08:10,176
- Work...
- Ennobles and dignifies.

905
01:08:10,274 --> 01:08:12,729
- And now to work.
- Excuse me, don Panta.

906
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,957
Is there a problem?

907
01:08:28,949 --> 01:08:29,877
No.

908
01:08:30,869 --> 01:08:32,757
No. None at all.

909
01:08:32,854 --> 01:08:35,636
It's just that I got
a little stone in my shoe.

910
01:08:36,629 --> 01:08:37,557
Thanks.

911
01:08:39,509 --> 01:08:42,357
Aren't you coming this time,
don Panta?

912
01:08:42,454 --> 01:08:46,196
- No, I've got things to do here.
- What a shame.

913
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:50,037
I had thought we could repeat
the quality control test.

914
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:52,910
Wouldn't you like
to spend the night with me?

915
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:57,706
We got top results from this test
and they allowed us to collect valuable...

916
01:08:57,814 --> 01:09:01,556
information and first hand. I
thank you for carrying out the test

917
01:09:01,654 --> 01:09:04,436
but it think it's neither necessary
nor convenient to repeat it.

918
01:09:05,429 --> 01:09:08,277
Is there a problem, don Panta?
We're five minutes late.

919
01:09:08,374 --> 01:09:10,196
No, none at all, Chuchupe.

920
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:14,037
This should never happen again. Your lack
of discretion sets me in a difficult and

921
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:16,916
akward situation with the rest of the
personnell, which capacity, besides, can...

922
01:09:17,013 --> 01:09:18,295
disminish because they'll
spend the time doing

923
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:19,821
comments that will take their
mind off their business.

924
01:09:19,893 --> 01:09:22,676
If that's what worries you,
we can go to a hotel...

925
01:09:22,773 --> 01:09:25,556
or to another place
where nobody can see us.

926
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:33,237
Hello.

927
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:35,157
Yes.

928
01:09:35,253 --> 01:09:38,352
Pocha, I've told you not to call me
when I'm at work unless...

929
01:09:39,029 --> 01:09:41,877
What? I'm coming right away.

930
01:09:42,869 --> 01:09:45,717
Here are the results
of the analysis.

931
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:55,310
- Are you sure, Dr.? -Yes, Mr. Pantoja.
Your wife is pregnant.

932
01:10:00,149 --> 01:10:02,997
I didn't want to tell you anything
until being complety possitive.

933
01:10:03,989 --> 01:10:05,877
Finally a Pantita! Finally!

934
01:10:09,749 --> 01:10:11,637
I'm going to be a father!

935
01:10:29,909 --> 01:10:31,797
You're very pensive today, don Panta.

936
01:10:33,749 --> 01:10:35,637
What are you still doing here?

937
01:10:37,589 --> 01:10:40,437
I was the last one taking a shower.
They left without me.

938
01:10:45,269 --> 01:10:47,790
It's weird to see you
without your machine.

939
01:10:50,069 --> 01:10:52,917
- I thought you never stopped
working. - "El Dalila" comes back at 7.

940
01:10:54,869 --> 01:10:57,717
- That means you really are working.
- Mhm.

941
01:10:58,069 --> 01:10:59,630
A cigarette?

942
01:11:00,629 --> 01:11:02,517
No, thanks.

943
01:11:12,149 --> 01:11:14,997
Since the day of the test
we haven't been completely alone, have we?

944
01:11:17,269 --> 01:11:18,830
Are you nervous?

945
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:23,637
What do you want, Olga?

946
01:11:24,629 --> 01:11:26,517
Nothing special, don Panta.

947
01:11:28,469 --> 01:11:31,316
- I thought you and me...
- You and me... nothing!

948
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:34,196
I thought it was clear
enough since the beginning.

949
01:11:34,293 --> 01:11:37,076
- Because of work...
- Can't you think of anything else...

950
01:11:37,173 --> 01:11:40,916
- ... besides work?
- No. And even less when I talk to you.

951
01:11:52,469 --> 01:11:56,266
- And now excuse me, I'm
going to work. -No, you stay.

952
01:11:57,269 --> 01:11:59,156
I'm the one who's leaving.

953
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:04,906
But you know what? It can be
that you as a boss and as a lover...

954
01:12:05,013 --> 01:12:08,756
are just excellent, but as a person
you are unbearable.

955
01:12:08,853 --> 01:12:11,635
I'm not your lover, Miss.

956
01:12:13,589 --> 01:12:15,476
But don't you wish to be, don Panta.

957
01:12:24,509 --> 01:12:27,356
Today we've allowed ourselves
to stop on the way...

958
01:12:27,453 --> 01:12:30,235
to celebrate the perk
number 20 thousand...

959
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:33,115
and it's lucky Pechuga's turn.

960
01:12:35,069 --> 01:12:36,956
Woo! Woo!

961
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:44,626
20 thousand perks
for two classes and soldiers...

962
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:48,476
in our border units...

963
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:51,355
that all constitutes a humble success
to our service.

964
01:12:52,349 --> 01:12:55,196
Prove that the escort
service has fully made use...

965
01:12:55,293 --> 01:12:59,035
of its operative potential,
as it comes off...

966
01:12:59,133 --> 01:13:03,835
from the descomposition of the total
20 thousand in its constituend humans.

967
01:13:05,789 --> 01:13:08,636
Our goal
for what's left of this year...

968
01:13:08,989 --> 01:13:11,510
is to reach 200
thousand perks,...

969
01:13:13,469 --> 01:13:16,316
an ambitious figure,
but not impossible,...

970
01:13:16,413 --> 01:13:19,195
if the personnel keeps it up
as it has up to now...

971
01:13:19,293 --> 01:13:22,075
mantaining its high
output average and...

972
01:13:22,173 --> 01:13:25,915
with the backups we've
planned to hire soon.

973
01:13:26,013 --> 01:13:27,835
Long live our service!

974
01:13:39,389 --> 01:13:42,236
The boat! Look!

975
01:13:45,149 --> 01:13:49,906
Let don Panta cut the tart!
Let don Panta cut the tart!

976
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:04,316
Oh, beautiful!

977
01:14:28,349 --> 01:14:30,236
Want to dance, don Panta?

978
01:14:39,869 --> 01:14:41,756
Come on!

979
01:14:46,909 --> 01:14:49,430
Are you ok, don Pantita?

980
01:14:49,533 --> 01:14:52,315
I'm not very used to
this kind of reunions.

981
01:14:52,413 --> 01:14:55,195
I think I've drunk too much.
I'm a bit tipsy.

982
01:14:57,149 --> 01:14:59,996
Easy. Just close your eyes. Like this.

983
01:15:00,093 --> 01:15:01,915
Lean.

984
01:15:17,373 --> 01:15:19,195
Everybody changes dancing partners!

985
01:15:43,229 --> 01:15:47,026
- You didn't want to dance with me, Olga.
- Why didn't you ask me to?

986
01:15:48,029 --> 01:15:50,876
All this time you've treated me
as if I was invisible.

987
01:15:52,829 --> 01:15:54,716
Everything's so complicated, Olga.

988
01:15:56,669 --> 01:15:58,556
I don't understand
what's so complicated.

989
01:15:58,909 --> 01:16:01,430
A man likes or not a woman.

990
01:16:03,389 --> 01:16:05,276
And you've demonstrated
you don't like me.

991
01:16:06,269 --> 01:16:07,196
I like you.

992
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:10,076
I like you very much.

993
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:15,069
And the truth is I haven't been able to
stop thinking about you ever since...

994
01:16:15,869 --> 01:16:16,796
Well...

995
01:16:19,709 --> 01:16:21,596
Eversince we slept together.

996
01:16:24,509 --> 01:16:25,436
Olga,...

997
01:16:27,389 --> 01:16:28,316
if I could...

998
01:16:30,269 --> 01:16:32,156
Of course you can.

999
01:16:33,149 --> 01:16:35,036
It's just a matter of wanting to.

1000
01:16:45,629 --> 01:16:46,556
But not here.

1001
01:16:47,549 --> 01:16:49,436
I mean it for you.

1002
01:16:49,565 --> 01:16:52,314
I think we are making a scene.

1003
01:17:17,309 --> 01:17:20,156
I like you. I like you very much.

1004
01:17:26,909 --> 01:17:29,756
- So this is the famous colombian?
- What?

1005
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:32,635
They all got the hots for her.
Look how many stand in her row.

1006
01:17:44,189 --> 01:17:47,036
Hey, hey, hey! Where do you think
you're going, you fatso?

1007
01:17:47,133 --> 01:17:50,875
- Don't you like this saddle anymore?
- Yes, I like it, Pechuga, but...

1008
01:17:50,973 --> 01:17:53,755
I think this one time I'm
riding another mare.

1009
01:17:53,853 --> 01:17:56,635
Private, go immediately
back to your row.

1010
01:17:56,733 --> 01:17:59,515
My record of service allows me
to fuck the escort I want,...

1011
01:17:59,613 --> 01:18:01,069
and I've decided to try
the colombian to see

1012
01:18:01,095 --> 01:18:02,420
if she's as good as
they say she is, Sr.

1013
01:18:02,493 --> 01:18:05,275
You go in this moment back
to Pechuga's row!

1014
01:18:05,373 --> 01:18:09,115
- Miss Colombiana already has
enough users. -Each escort can...

1015
01:18:09,213 --> 01:18:11,995
have a maximum of 20 perks.
That's stated in the regulations, Sr.

1016
01:18:12,349 --> 01:18:13,909
And with me it'd be...

1017
01:18:14,909 --> 01:18:15,836
19.

1018
01:18:17,789 --> 01:18:19,676
19 users, Sr.

1019
01:18:24,509 --> 01:18:27,356
- Where do you think you're going private?!
- I'm number 20, Sr.

1020
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:31,195
My record of service
allows me this choice. -Sres.

1021
01:18:32,189 --> 01:18:35,986
Don't you realize that the
escort has an overload of work?

1022
01:18:36,093 --> 01:18:38,875
When your turn comes, she'll
be so tired that her performance...

1023
01:18:38,973 --> 01:18:41,755
won't even be 25% as good
as her regular performance.

1024
01:18:41,853 --> 01:18:44,635
- I recommend you to go
back to your row. -No.

1025
01:18:44,733 --> 01:18:47,515
I don't get tired that easily, don Panta.

1026
01:18:47,613 --> 01:18:52,315
Quite the opposite. Every soldier
leaves me more... ardent.

1027
01:18:52,413 --> 01:18:56,155
I assure you, the last ones in my row will
be looked after just as the first ones.

1028
01:18:56,476 --> 01:18:59,029
If you don't believe me,
stand on my line.

1029
01:19:08,669 --> 01:19:11,516
10 perks is what the
regulations order. You don't have...

1030
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:14,395
any obligation to look
after more soldiers. Only 10.

1031
01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:20,629
I'm sorry, Olga.

1032
01:20:22,589 --> 01:20:26,385
I'm just going crazy.
No... I don't know what's wrong with me.

1033
01:20:30,269 --> 01:20:35,025
Your flirting with the troop, I just
can't stand it. It makes my blood boil!

1034
01:20:35,133 --> 01:20:38,013
It makes me want to imprison all those
soldiers that look at you as if...

1035
01:20:38,909 --> 01:20:41,756
- I don't know, as if you were an escort...
- An escort?

1036
01:20:42,749 --> 01:20:44,636
That's what I am.

1037
01:20:45,629 --> 01:20:49,425
But it's not your duty to flirt with them.
It's not stated in the regulations.

1038
01:20:49,533 --> 01:20:51,355
I just do it to attrack them,
Don Panta.

1039
01:20:52,349 --> 01:20:55,196
It's not only a matter of having
good looks. You have to...

1040
01:20:55,293 --> 01:20:59,035
You have to know how to sell yourself
and show it to the client with...

1041
01:20:59,133 --> 01:21:02,875
smiles and those things
so that he comes to my row.

1042
01:21:02,973 --> 01:21:05,755
I don't want to you to do that!
There's no need on doing that.

1043
01:21:05,853 --> 01:21:08,635
The system is organized in such a way
that you all have 10 perks guaranteed...

1044
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:11,515
- ... for the basic payment.
- Well, but our profit

1045
01:21:11,613 --> 01:21:13,435
is in the special perks.

1046
01:21:14,429 --> 01:21:17,276
If I just set for serving you well,
my profit reduces by the half.

1047
01:21:28,829 --> 01:21:31,676
What I can accept
is to be relieved from my job.

1048
01:21:32,669 --> 01:21:35,516
I don't ask you to retire
because there is a work contract

1049
01:21:35,613 --> 01:21:38,413
that you've signed and you have to keep.
Besides, the service estimates

1050
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:41,275
don't suppose that your
performance can be so high.

1051
01:21:42,268 --> 01:21:44,156
Is it so hard to understand?

1052
01:21:44,253 --> 01:21:47,995
Look, I can explain it to you in
another way. My

1053
01:21:48,093 --> 01:21:49,915
it's not supposed that any esc...

1054
01:22:13,948 --> 01:22:16,796
We consider it an abusive privilege
that the escort service...

1055
01:22:16,893 --> 01:22:20,635
is for your exclusive use.
We demand that citizens...

1056
01:22:20,733 --> 01:22:23,533
of age and with a record of service
have the right to use this service.

1057
01:22:23,613 --> 01:22:26,395
And the same low fares
soldiers have.

1058
01:22:26,493 --> 01:22:29,275
But this service only exists
in your perverted minds, Sres.

1059
01:22:30,268 --> 01:22:33,116
How does it occur to you to
go to court for such nonsense?

1060
01:22:33,213 --> 01:22:35,995
We've seen it with our
own eyes, Sr.

1061
01:22:36,093 --> 01:22:38,875
Your boats come full of women.

1062
01:22:38,973 --> 01:22:42,715
We also want women, Sr.
Not only soldiers have necessities.

1063
01:22:42,813 --> 01:22:46,555
I haven't got any information
of what you're telling me.

1064
01:22:46,653 --> 01:22:50,395
I think you're drinking way too
much "chuchuaye" my friends, uh?

1065
01:22:50,493 --> 01:22:53,275
- But General! -Do you think
I'm stupid, mayor Paiva?

1066
01:22:55,228 --> 01:22:59,985
- No, General. -If the press knew
about this stupid petition...

1067
01:23:00,988 --> 01:23:03,836
your mayoralty wouldn't last long,
Mr. Paiva Rumbu・

1068
01:23:05,788 --> 01:23:09,585
And now, out of my face, damn it.
What are you waiting for?!

1069
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,515
Damn it, out of here!

1070
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:20,156
What's going on?

1071
01:23:23,068 --> 01:23:25,916
Mhm? Do you regret it now?

1072
01:23:26,908 --> 01:23:29,756
I feel like a piece of crap
doing this to my wife.

1073
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:32,636
I know.

1074
01:23:33,628 --> 01:23:37,425
I had never cheated on her.
They only did it once every two weeks,...

1075
01:23:37,533 --> 01:23:41,275
saturdays at 10 pm.
I already know it by heart, Panta.

1076
01:23:41,373 --> 01:23:43,260
You've told me a thousand times.

1077
01:24:01,468 --> 01:24:02,396
And?

1078
01:24:12,028 --> 01:24:14,876
Come on, don't exaggerate
nobody is watching.

1079
01:24:14,973 --> 01:24:17,755
Its never unecessary to be
extra careful. You never know.

1080
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:23,505
- Anyone could say you're ashamed
to be seen with me. -You would have to

1081
01:24:23,613 --> 01:24:26,395
be nuts to feel ashamed
to be seen with a woman like you.

1082
01:24:29,308 --> 01:24:32,156
There is a party on
friday at "La Colcha Verde".

1083
01:24:33,148 --> 01:24:36,945
On that very same day I have
a day off. I want to go.

1084
01:24:37,053 --> 01:24:39,835
- You could go with Sandra.
She's algo got the day off. -No.

1085
01:24:39,933 --> 01:24:41,755
I want to go with you.

1086
01:24:42,748 --> 01:24:45,596
I refuse.
You know it's impossible.

1087
01:24:45,693 --> 01:24:48,475
I've told you a thousand times
they can't see us together.

1088
01:25:29,788 --> 01:25:32,636
You can't deny that some of the
girls are as good as it gets.

1089
01:25:32,733 --> 01:25:36,475
You've said it, girls,
only snotted little brats.

1090
01:25:37,468 --> 01:25:40,316
No real female that's
worth the shame.

1091
01:25:40,413 --> 01:25:45,115
Show me a real woman.
One that leaves you breathless.

1092
01:25:45,213 --> 01:25:48,955
- ... that gives you the goose bumps just
by looking at her and that... -That one!

1093
01:25:50,908 --> 01:25:52,796
That woman is a big female.

1094
01:26:00,508 --> 01:26:05,265
Gotcha, Pantale Pantoja!
You're an idiot!

1095
01:26:06,268 --> 01:26:08,156
Come here. You've got to work.

1096
01:26:22,588 --> 01:26:23,516
What are you doing?

1097
01:26:25,468 --> 01:26:28,316
I'm covering up the "social events" part
from the local newspaper, Mr. Pantoja.

1098
01:26:28,412 --> 01:26:30,235
I think we've got enough,
haven't we, Mario?

1099
01:26:51,388 --> 01:26:55,185
Mr. Sinche is here to see you, don Panta.
He says he's got a present for you.

1100
01:27:00,988 --> 01:27:03,836
Very good, Mr. L疼dano,
what do you want?

1101
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:07,675
I can take care of them, because
I suppose you wouldn't want...

1102
01:27:07,772 --> 01:27:09,595
your wife to see it.

1103
01:27:09,692 --> 01:27:12,475
It's natural, I understand,
and that's what friends are for.

1104
01:27:12,572 --> 01:27:15,355
You know we are no
friends, Mr. L疼dano.

1105
01:27:15,452 --> 01:27:17,275
You're wrong, Mr. Pantoja.

1106
01:27:17,372 --> 01:27:20,155
If I wasn't your friend your
business would be ruined.

1107
01:27:21,148 --> 01:27:24,945
I'm not talking about those pictures
and the negatives I have.

1108
01:27:26,108 --> 01:27:28,956
I'm talking about
something bigger, Sr.

1109
01:27:29,372 --> 01:27:31,194
I'm talking about Pantiland.

1110
01:27:33,788 --> 01:27:35,610
Don't take me wrong, Mr. Pantoja.

1111
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:38,268
You know I'm talking about the
prosperous clandestine business...

1112
01:27:38,332 --> 01:27:41,114
you've patiently put together.

1113
01:27:42,268 --> 01:27:43,577
I don't know what you're
talking about.

1114
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:46,545
After meticulous research,...

1115
01:27:47,036 --> 01:27:50,070
I've got proves that
can make you go under...

1116
01:27:50,173 --> 01:27:51,995
and even ruin you.

1117
01:27:53,788 --> 01:27:56,472
If I said all I know...

1118
01:27:56,604 --> 01:27:59,670
- And why don't you do it? -Because
I'm progressive, Mr. Pantoja.

1119
01:27:59,773 --> 01:28:03,515
I'm a 21st century man,
too advanced for my times.

1120
01:28:03,868 --> 01:28:07,097
But the whole city makes
pressure on me.

1121
01:28:07,388 --> 01:28:10,552
And I think my silence
deserves a little reward.

1122
01:28:12,828 --> 01:28:14,072
You are here to blackmail me.

1123
01:28:16,668 --> 01:28:19,832
To help you, man. For
some dollars,...

1124
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:22,388
I'm willing to defend
the escort service...

1125
01:28:22,492 --> 01:28:25,055
and the brains of the team.
They'll make such a

1126
01:28:25,081 --> 01:28:27,536
fuzz about you, Mr. Pantoja.
What do you say?

1127
01:28:28,892 --> 01:28:32,307
You don't have to answer right away.
You first sleep on it,...

1128
01:28:32,412 --> 01:28:36,471
ask your wife, your lover. Don't
get nervous, man. Calm down.

1129
01:28:36,572 --> 01:28:37,253
Caiguas, Rioalto.

1130
01:28:37,788 --> 01:28:40,406
What's going on? Arrest them, Pantoja.
Let go of me, damn it!

1131
01:28:40,668 --> 01:28:43,515
Throw him into the river.
Nobody blackmails me. ,...

1132
01:28:43,612 --> 01:28:46,711
 -And if you ever come back...Don't
suicide, don't be stupid!

1133
01:28:46,812 --> 01:28:49,595
I'm a superman in Iquitos!
I don't know how to swim!

1134
01:29:02,812 --> 01:29:05,267
You'll regreat for this, Pantoja!

1135
01:29:05,372 --> 01:29:07,827
There is nothing strong
enough in Iquitos...

1136
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:11,348
that Sinchi's
voice can't tear down!

1137
01:29:11,452 --> 01:29:14,551
You've asked for it! This
is war! War!

1138
01:29:34,908 --> 01:29:37,908
At 16.00 sharp...

1139
01:29:38,012 --> 01:29:40,467
on the clock hanging from the wall
in our studio,...

1140
01:29:40,572 --> 01:29:43,671
Radio Amazonas brings
to you proudly...

1141
01:29:43,772 --> 01:29:45,746
our dear listeners,...

1142
01:29:46,012 --> 01:29:49,525
the most famous program
from our station:...

1143
01:29:49,628 --> 01:29:52,944
"Sinchi's voice".

1144
01:29:53,756 --> 01:29:59,026
I promised to unmask
this individual with no principles...

1145
01:29:59,132 --> 01:30:03,026
who runs this
den of inquity and...

1146
01:30:03,292 --> 01:30:06,391
perdition, the so called
"escort service",...

1147
01:30:07,292 --> 01:30:12,148
more commonly known
as "Pantiland".

1148
01:30:12,252 --> 01:30:14,075
"El Sinchi"...

1149
01:30:14,172 --> 01:30:18,875
keeps his promises,
my dear listeners.

1150
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:21,747
We've been doing research,...

1151
01:30:21,852 --> 01:30:25,976
auscultated, verified
everything.

1152
01:30:26,268 --> 01:30:30,708
And now we're in the position
to reveal the identity...

1153
01:30:30,812 --> 01:30:32,699
of this sort of...

1154
01:30:32,828 --> 01:30:34,715
sub-human being.

1155
01:30:35,228 --> 01:30:40,313
In a short time, he's made possible
to raise right at the doors of our city,...

1156
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:45,883
that source of moral devatio that
has to be kicked out of Iquitos and...

1157
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:50,071
out of the Amazonia together
with his caravan of sluts in auction.

1158
01:30:50,907 --> 01:30:53,274
Pantale Pantoja...

1159
01:30:53,372 --> 01:30:55,990
that's the name
of this dark character.

1160
01:30:56,667 --> 01:31:00,791
Pantale Pantoja, come...

1161
01:31:00,892 --> 01:31:06,227
from hell and supported
by powerful and invisible interests...

1162
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:10,388
to fill with embarrasment
your names, ladies and gentlemen.

1163
01:31:15,867 --> 01:31:16,467
Hello?

1164
01:31:19,068 --> 01:31:20,955
Yes... Yes, my General.

1165
01:31:22,908 --> 01:31:24,795
No. No, I haven't heard anything.

1166
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:28,471
What?

1167
01:31:29,628 --> 01:31:30,555
Hello? Hello?

1168
01:31:35,388 --> 01:31:36,151
Damn it!

1169
01:31:39,228 --> 01:31:43,985
Because, indeed, it's
true that Pantale Pantoja...

1170
01:31:44,092 --> 01:31:47,834
has a wife and has been
leading a double life...

1171
01:31:47,932 --> 01:31:51,674
sank, in one side,
in a foul swamp...

1172
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:53,594
of his affair with Olga Arellano,...

1173
01:31:53,692 --> 01:31:59,355
the colombian, as remembered as
beautiful and popular eastern prostitute.

1174
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:05,105
In the other hand, pretending to have
a decent and respectful life...

1175
01:32:05,212 --> 01:32:10,875
and that deep ignorance hole
his wife was sank in,...

1176
01:32:12,828 --> 01:32:16,406
to whom through this station
we offer...

1177
01:32:16,508 --> 01:32:19,507
all our moral support.
And we remind her...

1178
01:32:20,508 --> 01:32:23,355
that's it's better to live
enlighted by truth...

1179
01:32:24,348 --> 01:32:26,235
than in the darkness
of ignorance.

1180
01:32:29,628 --> 01:32:32,945
What does the army have
to do with Pantiland?

1181
01:32:33,948 --> 01:32:37,745
Does Pantaleon have the
consent of authorities...

1182
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:40,634
to introduce prostitutes
in the barracks?

1183
01:32:41,628 --> 01:32:46,385
Are General Scavino, father Beltr疣,
the mayor, the prefect,...

1184
01:32:47,388 --> 01:32:52,145
aware of this lust traffic
and just turn a blind eye?

1185
01:32:54,108 --> 01:32:58,865
We, Loreto's people, will
keep investigating...

1186
01:32:59,868 --> 01:33:03,664
with the bravery, love
and truth characteristic of us.

1187
01:33:04,668 --> 01:33:07,515
You've heard "Sinchi's...

1188
01:33:08,508 --> 01:33:10,395
voice".

1189
01:33:12,348 --> 01:33:15,992
Devastating, master.
Devastating!

1190
01:33:21,787 --> 01:33:22,715
Pocha?

1191
01:33:28,188 --> 01:33:30,555
- Pocha, let me explain you.
- There's nothing to explain.

1192
01:33:30,652 --> 01:33:33,434
- It's all clear. Out of my way!
- Pochita,...

1193
01:33:33,532 --> 01:33:36,372
- ...you can't leave like that.
- Let me go! -Think of the little cadet.

1194
01:33:37,308 --> 01:33:40,155
- You are my wife and...
- Forget about me and the little cadet.

1195
01:33:40,252 --> 01:33:43,994
- You are a liar, hypocrit! -It's all fault
of that damned work of yours.

1196
01:33:44,988 --> 01:33:46,875
Pocha. Pocha, you know
how I am.

1197
01:33:46,972 --> 01:33:49,754
Remember when I got in charge
of this regiment's ranch...

1198
01:33:49,852 --> 01:33:53,114
that I got very hungry, that
I put on 11 kilos, I learnt how to cook.

1199
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:56,245
Or when I was responsible for
the garrison's uniforms. Remember?

1200
01:33:56,347 --> 01:33:59,347
Remember that I got into,
fashion? That I even designed...

1201
01:33:59,452 --> 01:34:02,234
new battle pants myself? That the
General thought I was gay?

1202
01:34:03,228 --> 01:34:08,944
That's me. Work takes up on me,
it transforms me, I can't help it.

1203
01:34:09,052 --> 01:34:12,794
Then keep your whores,
your colombian...

1204
01:34:12,892 --> 01:34:15,674
- ...and all that crap!
- Pochita... -Don't touch me!

1205
01:34:16,668 --> 01:34:18,555
You disgust me!

1206
01:34:22,267 --> 01:34:23,195
Leave me alone!

1207
01:34:31,068 --> 01:34:31,995
And I've also been unfaithful...

1208
01:34:32,092 --> 01:34:34,874
by word and by thought to
my superior for punishing me.

1209
01:34:35,868 --> 01:34:38,715
- I know it's a big mistake...
- 3 Holy Fathers y 10 Ave Mar僘.

1210
01:34:43,548 --> 01:34:45,435
Hello?
His Excellency...

1211
01:34:47,388 --> 01:34:48,315
No, not me, but...

1212
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:51,195
No, His Excellency.

1213
01:34:55,068 --> 01:34:55,995
Yes, His Excellency.

1214
01:34:57,787 --> 01:34:58,715
Yes.

1215
01:35:08,508 --> 01:35:11,355
Pocha? Please, listen to me.
Let me speak.

1216
01:35:14,268 --> 01:35:16,886
I've quitted, Pochita.

1217
01:35:16,987 --> 01:35:19,067
I've asked the General.
To relieve me from my charge.

1218
01:35:19,867 --> 01:35:24,570
- And what did he say? -Nothing. But
I'm confident he'll let me go.

1219
01:35:24,667 --> 01:35:28,628
Secret mission, Intelligence service.
You're a liar, Pantale Pantoja!

1220
01:35:28,732 --> 01:35:31,514
Don't you ever call me until
you're completely out of this...

1221
01:35:31,612 --> 01:35:34,394
disgusting world you've
got yourself into! Idiot!

1222
01:35:36,347 --> 01:35:37,275
Pocha... Pochita...?

1223
01:35:50,747 --> 01:35:51,707
What are you doing here?

1224
01:35:58,267 --> 01:35:59,195
I wanted to see you.

1225
01:36:03,067 --> 01:36:03,995
How are you?

1226
01:36:08,027 --> 01:36:08,627
Bad.

1227
01:36:24,347 --> 01:36:25,428
What's going to happen now?

1228
01:36:35,867 --> 01:36:36,566
Hello, Yes?

1229
01:36:36,827 --> 01:36:38,747
Good morning, Pantoja.
General Collazos speaking.

1230
01:36:39,707 --> 01:36:40,707
Good morning, my General.

1231
01:36:40,732 --> 01:36:43,514
- I read your application
for relocation carefully. -Yes, my General.

1232
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:46,395
I'm surprised by your
less competitive attitude.

1233
01:36:47,387 --> 01:36:49,275
You were selected
because of your good qualities...

1234
01:36:49,372 --> 01:36:52,154
not only in the administrative
but in the patriotic field.

1235
01:36:53,147 --> 01:36:57,904
Remember our glorious
ancestors. Mollesi, Darte, C當eres.

1236
01:36:58,907 --> 01:37:02,704
Do you thinik they thought
of giving up right away?

1237
01:37:04,667 --> 01:37:08,464
No, sir. The militar who's got the
service feeling in the blood...

1238
01:37:08,572 --> 01:37:11,354
turns stronger
at difficult times.

1239
01:37:11,452 --> 01:37:14,234
You're a soldier, you can't
give up, Pantoja.

1240
01:37:14,332 --> 01:37:17,114
And the way you're serving your country
in these moments is making...

1241
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:19,994
- ...the service work. Do you understand?
- Good morning.

1242
01:37:21,947 --> 01:37:22,907
As you wish, my general.

1243
01:37:24,827 --> 01:37:27,675
He even authorized to enroll
the 10 escorts that I had requested...

1244
01:37:27,772 --> 01:37:31,514
- ...as backups. -See how everyone
is against you?

1245
01:37:31,612 --> 01:37:33,434
You should be glad, captain.

1246
01:37:34,427 --> 01:37:36,708
And whit this recognition
nobody will be able to stop you.

1247
01:37:39,227 --> 01:37:41,115
40 escorts.

1248
01:37:41,212 --> 01:37:43,034
Not bad, captain.

1249
01:37:44,027 --> 01:37:47,824
I have plenty of enemies, Bacacorzo.
And my wife doesn't want to know about me.

1250
01:37:48,827 --> 01:37:50,658
Your wife will understand,
give her some time.

1251
01:37:50,684 --> 01:37:51,852
And don't worry about Beltr疣.

1252
01:37:54,587 --> 01:37:58,384
You're fucked. From commandant
chaplain you came to be...

1253
01:37:58,492 --> 01:38:02,070
the humble parish priest
of Iquitos' cementery.

1254
01:38:04,187 --> 01:38:07,067
With your persistence and patience
you'll get rid of all of your enemies.

1255
01:38:08,987 --> 01:38:11,835
I'm only worried about
the queer of Sinchi.

1256
01:38:12,827 --> 01:38:15,675
- If I were you...
- General Collazos ordered me...

1257
01:38:15,772 --> 01:38:18,554
- ...to do him.
- Excellent.

1258
01:38:18,652 --> 01:38:21,434
I have a pair of assitants
that will leave him mute forerver.

1259
01:38:21,532 --> 01:38:24,314
They really know how to beat up, Capt'n.
Without leaving any traces.

1260
01:38:24,412 --> 01:38:27,030
No, Bacacorzo, it's not
about that. It's something worse.

1261
01:38:29,884 --> 01:38:31,989
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight!

1262
01:38:32,092 --> 01:38:35,834
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight!

1263
01:38:36,827 --> 01:38:39,675
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight!

1264
01:38:39,772 --> 01:38:42,554
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight!

1265
01:38:42,652 --> 01:38:44,474
One, two, three, four...

1266
01:38:44,572 --> 01:38:46,394
five, six, seven, eight!

1267
01:38:46,492 --> 01:38:49,274
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight!

1268
01:38:53,147 --> 01:38:55,035
Dear Pantale, how are you?

1269
01:38:57,947 --> 01:38:58,987
Just a moment, Mr. L疼dano.

1270
01:39:12,347 --> 01:39:16,144
Nice sight. Congratulations.

1271
01:39:18,107 --> 01:39:21,904
- Beg your pardon? -They told me you
wanted to talk to me, Mr. Pantoja.

1272
01:39:23,867 --> 01:39:28,624
Wise choise. People of our rank
can't hurt or confront each other.

1273
01:39:29,627 --> 01:39:35,344
- It's a waste of time. -I didn't
bring you here to chat, Mr. L疼dano.

1274
01:39:41,147 --> 01:39:42,871
I wanted to give you this.

1275
01:39:47,867 --> 01:39:51,664
Please open it and tell
me if it's enough.

1276
01:40:03,227 --> 01:40:07,984
Mr. Pantoja, are you trying to
bribe me?

1277
01:40:08,987 --> 01:40:12,784
You threw me into the river
because I was trying to blackmail you...

1278
01:40:12,891 --> 01:40:15,674
and now you want to pay me
to advertise your brothel?

1279
01:40:17,467 --> 01:40:20,467
Not to advertise it.
I don't want you to ever mention...

1280
01:40:20,571 --> 01:40:24,314
- ...the escort service. -To tell you
the truth, I don't know, Mr. Pantoja.

1281
01:40:25,307 --> 01:40:28,155
"Pantiland" is one of the
most important events...

1282
01:40:28,251 --> 01:40:31,994
of the end of the millenium in Iquitos
and in the rest of the world.

1283
01:40:32,091 --> 01:40:35,834
I wouldn't be surprised if CNN or
the Time ask for a cronique.

1284
01:40:35,931 --> 01:40:38,714
- That'd give me a rating... -Every
first day of the month...

1285
01:40:38,811 --> 01:40:41,594
you'll receive the same
amount of money.

1286
01:40:47,387 --> 01:40:49,588
We're understanding each other now,
dear friend Pantoja.

1287
01:40:53,147 --> 01:40:55,995
But I'm not taking any more
of your time, illustrious friend.

1288
01:40:56,091 --> 01:40:57,914
Next month if...

1289
01:40:58,907 --> 01:41:01,755
If you want, for free,...

1290
01:41:01,851 --> 01:41:04,634
you could do
a special report...

1291
01:41:04,731 --> 01:41:06,554
to refute some data...

1292
01:41:07,547 --> 01:41:09,435
that I once said about you...

1293
01:41:09,531 --> 01:41:12,314
- ...and that surely...
- See you next month.

1294
01:41:29,627 --> 01:41:30,827
Don't you want to eat, capt'n?

1295
01:41:32,507 --> 01:41:34,395
I'm not hungry.

1296
01:41:36,347 --> 01:41:40,144
You have to eat. You've been putting off a
lot of weight eversince your wife left.

1297
01:41:41,147 --> 01:41:42,871
Yeah, I've been told so before.

1298
01:41:44,987 --> 01:41:46,875
Is there a response
to my last report?

1299
01:41:48,667 --> 01:41:51,667
Seen what's been happening
to civilians in rivers, waiting...

1300
01:41:51,771 --> 01:41:54,554
for the service's convoys,
I propose we create a system...

1301
01:41:54,651 --> 01:41:57,270
of extraordinary regular
rotation.

1302
01:41:57,948 --> 01:42:00,315
This system will keep the civilians
from forseeing out arrival,...

1303
01:42:00,411 --> 01:42:03,371
which will eliminate their presence
and the difficulties they represent.

1304
01:42:04,187 --> 01:42:07,984
In order for it to work out,
100 escorts are necessary...

1305
01:42:08,091 --> 01:42:10,874
and 5 ships, to be permanently
navigating...

1306
01:42:10,971 --> 01:42:13,754
- ...in amazonian rivers.
- 100 escorts?

1307
01:42:14,747 --> 01:42:16,634
- 5 ships?
- That's nothing, Tiger.

1308
01:42:16,731 --> 01:42:18,554
Listen to this.

1309
01:42:19,547 --> 01:42:22,394
I beg you study the possibility
of giving a risk bonus...

1310
01:42:22,491 --> 01:42:25,274
to all those escorts
who depart with the convoy, given that...

1311
01:42:25,371 --> 01:42:28,154
by accomplishing their mission,
they risk their lives. Likewise,...

1312
01:42:28,251 --> 01:42:31,034
attached to the project,
find pages 25 and 26,...

1313
01:42:31,131 --> 01:42:33,914
a social benefits plan
including health insurance,...

1314
01:42:34,907 --> 01:42:37,754
compensation for long term
services, and simmilar...

1315
01:42:37,851 --> 01:42:40,634
all workers have rights
according to the law.

1316
01:42:40,731 --> 01:42:44,474
This is not funny. This Pantoja
affair is starting to worry me.

1317
01:42:45,467 --> 01:42:48,314
And now the army has to stop buying
weapons in order to hire whores...

1318
01:42:48,411 --> 01:42:50,964
and pay for their social
security.

1319
01:42:51,227 --> 01:42:53,114
You're authorized
to carry out your new plan,...

1320
01:42:54,107 --> 01:42:56,954
as well as you're not authorized
to hire new escorts.

1321
01:43:00,827 --> 01:43:03,445
I don't understand, everything
was perfectly explained.

1322
01:43:03,547 --> 01:43:05,587
Do you know what your sin is? Having
made the service the mos efficient...

1323
01:43:05,691 --> 01:43:08,473
organ in the army.
That can scare anyone.

1324
01:43:08,571 --> 01:43:11,353
It's a long wat to go. Deman
overlaps the offer.

1325
01:43:12,347 --> 01:43:15,194
Maybe it's convenient
not to do more request by now.

1326
01:43:16,187 --> 01:43:18,074
Let some time pass by.
Take a break.

1327
01:43:19,867 --> 01:43:22,867
This is an emergency, tenent.
I'll prepare a more convincing report.

1328
01:43:23,867 --> 01:43:27,347
I got the polls, and 172 requests
signed by the subofficials...

1329
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,590
asking to be allowed to
use the escort service.

1330
01:43:31,547 --> 01:43:34,394
95% of the officers,
claims to have escorts.

1331
01:43:34,491 --> 01:43:36,313
And 55% of the higher
rank officers.

1332
01:43:36,411 --> 01:43:39,193
In order to be able to give this service,
the regular prestations plan,...

1333
01:43:39,291 --> 01:43:42,073
under the minimum limit
of sexual vitality, demands...

1334
01:43:42,171 --> 01:43:43,993
4 boats and 271 escorts.

1335
01:43:44,987 --> 01:43:47,834
- Sounds reasonable, but... -Would
we have to create a special sector?

1336
01:43:47,931 --> 01:43:50,731
Exclusive escorts for officials,
brought from Lima or even from abroad.

1337
01:43:50,811 --> 01:43:52,633
Do you like what OS stands for?

1338
01:43:52,731 --> 01:43:55,513
Officer Sector.
Sounds good, doesn't it?

1339
01:43:56,507 --> 01:43:59,354
- Captain... -Or Officially
Exclusive Service.

1340
01:43:59,451 --> 01:44:00,149
Captain.

1341
01:44:04,187 --> 01:44:07,034
You're working too much. If you
keep it going like that you'll get sick,...

1342
01:44:07,131 --> 01:44:09,913
smoking like a chinese and not eating.
No job deserves...

1343
01:44:10,011 --> 01:44:11,833
the sacrifice you're doing.

1344
01:44:12,827 --> 01:44:14,785
A couple of days ago all
you thought was quiting,

1345
01:44:14,811 --> 01:44:16,572
and now you're almost
dying for the service.

1346
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:19,514
It's my sense of responsibility.
I quited and they made me keep working.

1347
01:44:19,611 --> 01:44:23,353
And now I'll do, no matter what, because
of my odd habit of doing everything right.

1348
01:44:23,451 --> 01:44:26,069
Because...
Because it's the only way I know.

1349
01:44:28,987 --> 01:44:32,267
If everyone thought the way you do, this
country would be the American Switzerland.

1350
01:44:33,947 --> 01:44:36,794
I got a 4x4. Let's go for a ride,
you'll calm down.

1351
01:44:39,707 --> 01:44:42,554
Thanks for the invitation...
but I have a lot of work to do.

1352
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:44,473
I'm handing my new
project in on monday.

1353
01:45:08,507 --> 01:45:10,394
You left almos all
of your clothes, huh?

1354
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:16,154
Or you left too soon,
or you think of going back.

1355
01:45:19,867 --> 01:45:20,794
What do you think?

1356
01:45:21,947 --> 01:45:22,710
I don't know.

1357
01:45:30,587 --> 01:45:33,270
I would have never thought
about buying anything like that.

1358
01:45:46,907 --> 01:45:48,794
Is that how decent women sleep?

1359
01:45:59,387 --> 01:46:01,110
Looks like a nun's nightie.

1360
01:46:03,227 --> 01:46:04,950
Or you like them more like that?

1361
01:46:08,027 --> 01:46:11,507
- What's up with you now?
- Don't you know?

1362
01:46:12,827 --> 01:46:16,405
- Don't you realize? -Just because I'm
allowing you not to work tomorrow?

1363
01:46:16,507 --> 01:46:19,507
It's not only because tomorrow.
I don't want to work.

1364
01:46:22,427 --> 01:46:24,150
I want to be with you.

1365
01:46:25,307 --> 01:46:28,154
They just rejected my project.
The service is in such an emergency.

1366
01:46:28,251 --> 01:46:31,033
I have to finish this report
to convince my bosses,...

1367
01:46:31,131 --> 01:46:33,749
and all you do is problems
because you don't want to work.

1368
01:46:34,907 --> 01:46:39,664
All I'm saying is the boss's wife
receives special treatment. Always.

1369
01:46:41,627 --> 01:46:43,514
But for me,
it's all disadvantages.

1370
01:46:44,507 --> 01:46:46,394
You treat me as if I were
one of your whores.

1371
01:46:50,267 --> 01:46:53,114
Is that why you are with me?
Because I'm the boss?

1372
01:46:55,067 --> 01:46:55,994
What do you think?

1373
01:47:02,587 --> 01:47:03,514
I rather don't know.

1374
01:47:07,547 --> 01:47:08,474
Fire me, Panta.

1375
01:47:10,427 --> 01:47:12,314
Let's this all end
for once and all.

1376
01:47:14,107 --> 01:47:15,034
Yes?

1377
01:47:16,987 --> 01:47:17,914
Is that what you want?

1378
01:47:38,267 --> 01:47:41,845
Good morning,
ladies and gentelmen...

1379
01:47:41,947 --> 01:47:44,729
listening this program
sent out of Iquitos...

1380
01:47:44,827 --> 01:47:47,826
reaching the most hidden
places...

1381
01:47:47,931 --> 01:47:49,753
in our jungle.

1382
01:47:50,747 --> 01:47:55,286
Today I want to talk about
don Pantale Pantoja.

1383
01:47:55,387 --> 01:47:57,426
- Shut him up.
- No, leave it, I want to hear.

1384
01:47:58,427 --> 01:48:02,966
It's normal to correct one's mistakes,
and I'm telling you,...

1385
01:48:03,067 --> 01:48:04,954
with my hand on my heart,...

1386
01:48:06,107 --> 01:48:07,994
that I misjudged you,
don Panta.

1387
01:48:09,787 --> 01:48:10,648
Heck!

1388
01:48:10,907 --> 01:48:14,485
Letters never stop coming...

1389
01:48:14,587 --> 01:48:17,586
from soldiers and sargents
in our borders...

1390
01:48:17,691 --> 01:48:20,473
en cuarteles y
guarniciones inhpitas.

1391
01:48:21,467 --> 01:48:24,314
And they say:
"Mister Sinchi,...

1392
01:48:24,411 --> 01:48:27,193
why do you insult don Pantale?

1393
01:48:28,187 --> 01:48:29,114
We're coming.
Be aware.

1394
01:48:30,107 --> 01:48:31,994
Nobody's ever done that.

1395
01:48:32,091 --> 01:48:35,833
We're all human, Mr. Sinchi.
We all have necessities.

1396
01:48:35,931 --> 01:48:39,673
And thanks to don Panta
we serve our country better".

1397
01:48:40,667 --> 01:48:43,514
All that sincerity
made me reflect.

1398
01:48:44,507 --> 01:48:49,046
And by exposing Pantale Pantoja,
I didn't take the soldiers into account.

1399
01:48:49,147 --> 01:48:52,146
I didn't take into account
don Pantale's mission...

1400
01:48:52,251 --> 01:48:55,993
to satisfy...

1401
01:48:56,091 --> 01:48:59,833
the most intimate necessities
our Peru's heroes.

1402
01:49:00,827 --> 01:49:03,674
Attention, Horcones post.
Escort service approaching.

1403
01:49:04,667 --> 01:49:08,464
It'll be 10 minutes by boat.
I repeat. Escort service...

1404
01:49:20,987 --> 01:49:23,834
Horcones, we've been robbed!
Pirates, I believe!

1405
01:49:23,931 --> 01:49:27,673
Waiting for confirmation! Horcones post,
waiting for confirmation, heck!

1406
01:49:28,667 --> 01:49:31,514
Eva is trying to establish communication!
S.O.S.! S.O.S!

1407
01:49:31,611 --> 01:49:35,353
Don Panta, that lovely nickname
that's made him famous...

1408
01:49:35,451 --> 01:49:37,273
in our wild jungle,...

1409
01:49:37,371 --> 01:49:39,989
is an enemy of fame
and recognition.

1410
01:49:50,747 --> 01:49:51,707
Open your legs, damn it!

1411
01:49:52,667 --> 01:49:54,554
Dear friends,
I have in my hands...

1412
01:49:54,651 --> 01:49:57,433
a report from
the National Police.

1413
01:49:58,427 --> 01:50:03,183
Do you know how many rapes
take place monthly?

1414
01:50:04,187 --> 01:50:07,983
It's worth mentioning, that eversince
don Panta introduced this program...

1415
01:50:08,091 --> 01:50:09,913
the escort service.

1416
01:50:10,907 --> 01:50:13,754
Zero.
Just as you've heard.

1417
01:50:14,586 --> 01:50:15,186
Zero.

1418
01:50:21,467 --> 01:50:22,394
Pucha! The militants!

1419
01:50:23,387 --> 01:50:24,314
They're all gay!

1420
01:50:28,187 --> 01:50:30,074
Don't leave me!
Fuckers!

1421
01:50:31,866 --> 01:50:32,794
Shit!

1422
01:50:36,666 --> 01:50:37,594
Shit!

1423
01:50:43,386 --> 01:50:44,314
Don't!

1424
01:50:48,827 --> 01:50:51,194
Our Amazona is in peace.

1425
01:50:53,147 --> 01:50:55,765
Our mothers, sisters
and girlfriends...

1426
01:50:55,866 --> 01:50:57,906
can now go on the street...

1427
01:50:58,011 --> 01:50:59,669
fearless.

1428
01:51:01,787 --> 01:51:06,326
We Loreto people can be proud
of living in a place,...

1429
01:51:06,426 --> 01:51:09,209
..the only place in the
whole world,...

1430
01:51:09,306 --> 01:51:13,267
where sexual crimes have
been abolished.

1431
01:51:14,267 --> 01:51:16,154
Excitement carries me away.

1432
01:51:17,147 --> 01:51:19,034
And all it's left to say,...

1433
01:51:19,131 --> 01:51:21,913
in the name of the whole Amazona
and my self,...

1434
01:51:22,907 --> 01:51:25,754
thank you, don Panta.
Thank you,...

1435
01:51:26,747 --> 01:51:28,634
and your sacrified escort.

1436
01:51:50,747 --> 01:51:51,247
Where?

1437
01:52:13,787 --> 01:52:15,674
Could you leave for a moment
please?

1438
01:53:16,986 --> 01:53:19,986
After being kept vigil over night...

1439
01:53:20,091 --> 01:53:23,833
the precious body of Olga
Arellano, a.k.a. Colombiana,...

1440
01:53:23,931 --> 01:53:26,713
has arrived to its final
destiny, my friends.

1441
01:53:27,706 --> 01:53:29,594
This is your friend Sinchi.

1442
01:53:30,586 --> 01:53:33,205
We're now in the cementery...

1443
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:35,346
where a lot of people
have gathered.

1444
01:53:36,346 --> 01:53:39,925
Approaches her coffin...

1445
01:53:40,026 --> 01:53:42,066
accompanied by a troop...

1446
01:54:06,106 --> 01:54:07,994
Rest!
Weapons!

1447
01:54:22,426 --> 01:54:24,085
I am resurection and life.

1448
01:54:24,186 --> 01:54:26,008
Whoever believes in me,
even when he's dead, will live.

1449
01:54:26,106 --> 01:54:28,146
And whoever believes in me
won't die eternally.

1450
01:54:29,146 --> 01:54:31,034
Receive, Lord, this sinful woman,
forgive her offenses...

1451
01:54:31,131 --> 01:54:33,913
and allow her, Lord,
to rest in peace.

1452
01:54:34,011 --> 01:54:36,793
- Let's pray to the Lord.
- We beg you, Lord.

1453
01:54:38,586 --> 01:54:39,514
Amen.

1454
01:55:08,506 --> 01:55:09,434
Olga Arellano!

1455
01:55:11,386 --> 01:55:14,234
We've put on our glorious
uniform from the Peruvian army...

1456
01:55:16,186 --> 01:55:18,074
to bring you to your
last resting place.

1457
01:55:20,026 --> 01:55:22,874
It's our duty to claim
besides everyone's eyes,...

1458
01:55:22,971 --> 01:55:25,753
with a plane sense of responsibility,...

1459
01:55:27,706 --> 01:55:30,554
that you fell as every soldier does
when serving his country.

1460
01:55:33,466 --> 01:55:34,394
You're a martyr.

1461
01:55:36,346 --> 01:55:40,143
A victim of all those who didn't
know you were consagrated to our soldiers.

1462
01:55:44,986 --> 01:55:46,710
Loved Olga Arellano,...

1463
01:55:47,866 --> 01:55:48,794
the soldiers,...

1464
01:55:50,746 --> 01:55:52,634
your soldiers from
the whole Amazona,...

1465
01:55:53,626 --> 01:55:56,474
whom you served,...

1466
01:55:58,266 --> 01:55:59,194
cry for you.

1467
01:56:01,306 --> 01:56:03,194
Your coworkers are also crying.

1468
01:56:05,146 --> 01:56:06,074
In their name...

1469
01:56:08,026 --> 01:56:10,267
I let you know that
your sacrifice was not in vain,...

1470
01:56:11,866 --> 01:56:14,714
and that your blood will
be the engine to keep working...

1471
01:56:14,811 --> 01:56:16,633
in the mission the
army entrusted us.

1472
01:56:21,306 --> 01:56:22,233
And in my name...

1473
01:56:25,306 --> 01:56:28,154
allow me to thank you...

1474
01:56:30,106 --> 01:56:32,954
for your affection and understanding,...

1475
01:56:35,866 --> 01:56:37,754
for those intimate lessons...

1476
01:56:39,706 --> 01:56:41,430
I'll never forget.

1477
01:56:43,546 --> 01:56:44,474
Olga Arellano,...

1478
01:56:46,426 --> 01:56:47,354
rest in peace.

1479
01:56:49,306 --> 01:56:50,234
Attention battalion!

1480
01:56:52,186 --> 01:56:54,074
Weapons!

1481
01:57:15,226 --> 01:57:16,154
March.

1482
01:57:26,746 --> 01:57:27,746
Good morning, my general.

1483
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:30,324
I beg you read this letter.

1484
01:57:30,426 --> 01:57:33,208
And after reading it, do the
honours.

1485
01:57:33,466 --> 01:57:36,587
In this letter I declare myself responsible
for what happened at the cementery.

1486
01:57:36,986 --> 01:57:39,190
And how do you justify yourself, Pantoja?

1487
01:57:40,186 --> 01:57:43,764
Thanks to you everybody
is speaking about the escort service.

1488
01:57:43,866 --> 01:57:46,648
They were before, Sr. Long
time before Horcones,...

1489
01:57:46,746 --> 01:57:48,568
it was of the public domain.

1490
01:57:48,666 --> 01:57:50,706
In order to appear
dressed as an official...

1491
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:53,363
to honour a whore
as if it was...

1492
01:57:53,466 --> 01:57:57,427
a soldier. Olga
Arellano died serving her country.

1493
01:57:57,530 --> 01:57:59,353
Don't be cinical, Pantoja.

1494
01:57:59,450 --> 01:58:02,233
I know that whore
was your lover.

1495
01:58:02,330 --> 01:58:06,073
You would have done the same
if it had been another escort.

1496
01:58:07,066 --> 01:58:10,863
I did so because the army
has to honour their labour.

1497
01:58:11,866 --> 01:58:14,714
Which labourr, Pantoja?
Do the soldiers?

1498
01:58:15,227 --> 01:58:18,543
Do you really think the army
has to thank those sluts?

1499
01:58:18,650 --> 01:58:21,433
It's a hard job.
A rather risky one.

1500
01:58:25,306 --> 01:58:29,103
After Olga Arellano's death,
all the others wanted to leave the service.

1501
01:58:30,106 --> 01:58:32,954
And I understood we had
to rise their spirits.

1502
01:58:33,050 --> 01:58:35,833
Inject them some energy.

1503
01:58:36,826 --> 01:58:39,674
And that's why I did the memorial.
So that they'd feel supported...

1504
01:58:39,770 --> 01:58:41,593
by this institution and
kept working.

1505
01:58:41,690 --> 01:58:43,513
You should have let her go.

1506
01:58:43,610 --> 01:58:48,150
Because, happily, the escort
service was cancelled, Pantoja.

1507
01:58:51,066 --> 01:58:51,993
Cancelled?

1508
01:58:54,106 --> 01:58:55,993
I know I deserve a punishment...

1509
01:58:56,090 --> 01:58:58,010
for proceeding without
your permission, but...

1510
01:58:59,866 --> 01:59:01,524
cancelling the service?

1511
01:59:01,786 --> 01:59:03,673
I don't understand, it's never
been this good.

1512
01:59:04,666 --> 01:59:06,553
The soldiers' health reports...

1513
01:59:06,650 --> 01:59:09,433
0% of rape crimes prove it.

1514
01:59:10,426 --> 01:59:12,313
Forget about the service.
Gone, dead.

1515
01:59:13,306 --> 01:59:16,153
That's the good part of
the murdering of that whore.

1516
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:19,993
Well, you have to close the
service today,...

1517
01:59:20,090 --> 01:59:23,833
fire the personnel and leave
Iquitos first thing tomorrow morning.

1518
01:59:31,546 --> 01:59:35,343
Leave the army, Mr. Pantoja.
Leave the army and stay with us.

1519
01:59:36,346 --> 01:59:38,233
We have some capital to invest.

1520
01:59:39,226 --> 01:59:42,073
We could even ask the bank for
a loan, if you wish.

1521
01:59:43,066 --> 01:59:45,913
And with you being good at this,
we'd turn millionaire right away.

1522
01:59:46,906 --> 01:59:50,703
I organized the service following
orders. As a business,...

1523
01:59:51,706 --> 01:59:55,503
I'm not interested. You
create a company.

1524
01:59:55,610 --> 01:59:58,392
We don't want to set
a leathal bachelor pad.

1525
01:59:59,386 --> 02:00:03,183
We want a escort service company.
Big, modern and efficient.

1526
02:00:04,186 --> 02:00:05,909
And you'd be our boss.

1527
02:00:09,946 --> 02:00:12,793
I need to have a boss.
If I didn't have one,...

1528
02:00:15,706 --> 02:00:19,503
I wouldn't know what to do. I'm
made to obey orders.

1529
02:00:21,466 --> 02:00:25,263
The militia is my life. And
I want to dye serving the army.

1530
02:00:27,066 --> 02:00:28,953
That's something you have
to understand.

1531
02:00:30,106 --> 02:00:32,953
What's wrong, Chuchupe?
I've told you not to cry.

1532
02:00:33,946 --> 02:00:36,793
Sorry, don Panta, but
I can't help it.

1533
02:00:36,890 --> 02:00:38,712
It's the best job
I've ever had.

1534
02:00:39,706 --> 02:00:41,593
Why did they close the service?

1535
02:00:41,690 --> 02:00:44,472
Soldiers used to get so
happy just by seeing us.

1536
02:00:46,426 --> 02:00:49,273
This year's objectives are
being accomplished.

1537
02:00:52,186 --> 02:00:55,033
But that's the army.
Bosses know better...

1538
02:00:55,130 --> 02:00:57,250
and they consider it wise
to shut down the service.

1539
02:01:00,826 --> 02:01:02,549
Change that face, Chuchupe.

1540
02:01:36,186 --> 02:01:39,033
Don Pantita, we want you to
keep a good memory of us all.

1541
02:01:43,066 --> 02:01:44,789
To the best boss in the world.

1542
02:01:51,706 --> 02:01:52,633
Ladies.

1543
02:01:54,586 --> 02:01:55,513
Thank you.

1544
02:01:58,426 --> 02:02:00,149
I will never forget you.

1545
02:02:22,426 --> 02:02:25,273
Sorry to bother you again, but...
Isn't there a confusion?

1546
02:02:25,370 --> 02:02:29,112
- I was booked for 6. Are you sure
I have to wait? -Very sure.

1547
02:02:31,066 --> 02:02:33,913
The general is being interviewed
but he'll be right with you.

1548
02:02:35,866 --> 02:02:38,713
Look, look, it started.
The general is speaking.

1549
02:02:39,706 --> 02:02:43,503
Miss, the army has never
organized nor sponsored...

1550
02:02:43,610 --> 02:02:45,432
such a company.

1551
02:02:46,426 --> 02:02:50,223
- How about the service?
- Of course, Miss.

1552
02:02:50,330 --> 02:02:53,112
- Explicitly.
- But we've all seen...

1553
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:56,952
captain Pantoja honouring
a whore.

1554
02:02:57,050 --> 02:02:59,832
Moreover, Pantoja himself
has pointed out...

1555
02:02:59,930 --> 02:03:03,443
that assasins should
be processed in a military court.

1556
02:03:03,546 --> 02:03:06,546
Miss, that's nonsense.

1557
02:03:06,650 --> 02:03:09,432
The State ordered meticupous
research...

1558
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:13,043
which will be taken to extreme
consequences if necessary.

1559
02:03:13,146 --> 02:03:18,067
So I assure whoever is responsible
for this will get what he deserves.

1560
02:03:19,066 --> 02:03:20,953
Well, thanks, general.
Carry on!

1561
02:03:21,946 --> 02:03:25,743
You've turned famous.
Could you give me your autograph?

1562
02:03:38,266 --> 02:03:41,113
- Do you know who just left?
- The reporter, my general.

1563
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:43,992
I listened to your declarations
in the lobby's TV.

1564
02:03:44,090 --> 02:03:45,912
I won't ask you to explain.

1565
02:03:46,906 --> 02:03:49,753
I read your letter, I saw you saying
that pathetic speech...

1566
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:53,592
Anyways, you went nuts.
Do you want me to tell you the truth?

1567
02:03:54,586 --> 02:03:58,164
There is not punishment severe
enough for what you did.

1568
02:03:58,426 --> 02:04:02,223
- Not even executing you would
pay for what you did.

1569
02:04:03,226 --> 02:04:06,804
- I'll take all charges.
- Given that this is a serious thing,...

1570
02:04:06,906 --> 02:04:09,688
we've thought about
sending you to the discipline council.

1571
02:04:09,946 --> 02:04:12,793
Which means you'll be expelled.

1572
02:04:13,786 --> 02:04:16,633
But considering your record,
we propose a way out...

1573
02:04:16,730 --> 02:04:18,552
a honourable way out.

1574
02:04:20,506 --> 02:04:23,189
Quit today. Full period.

1575
02:04:26,266 --> 02:04:28,153
I refuse to quit, Sir.

1576
02:04:29,146 --> 02:04:31,993
Your carreer is over.
You commited suicide.

1577
02:04:32,090 --> 02:04:34,872
Quit. Get yourself
a job.

1578
02:04:35,866 --> 02:04:38,713
Your talent is admirable.

1579
02:04:38,810 --> 02:04:40,632
Work on the street,
you'll earn more anyways.

1580
02:04:43,546 --> 02:04:46,393
Are you crying, Pantoja?
What's wrong?

1581
02:04:46,490 --> 02:04:48,312
Behave like a man, heck!

1582
02:04:49,306 --> 02:04:52,153
Sorry. I beg you
forgive me, my general.

1583
02:04:54,106 --> 02:04:55,993
But I can only be a militar.

1584
02:04:57,786 --> 02:04:58,713
It's my life.

1585
02:04:59,866 --> 02:05:01,589
And if you make me go...

1586
02:05:04,666 --> 02:05:06,553
Do you want to be
captain forever?

1587
02:05:07,546 --> 02:05:11,343
The event in Iquitos
will stay in your record.

1588
02:05:13,306 --> 02:05:15,029
I'll try to make it up
to you, Sr.

1589
02:05:16,186 --> 02:05:18,869
Are you sure you don't
want to quit?

1590
02:05:19,866 --> 02:05:22,865
We'll make your life impossible.
You know how this is.

1591
02:05:24,826 --> 02:05:27,673
I know, but I'm willing
to take any risk.

1592
02:06:02,266 --> 02:06:06,063
My responsibilities kept me
from answering before.

1593
02:06:10,906 --> 02:06:14,703
My woman, my 3 month
old daughter, she's so pretty...

1594
02:06:14,810 --> 02:06:17,363
and the responsibilities of
my mission,...

1595
02:06:17,465 --> 02:06:19,505
are what distract me.

1596
02:06:20,506 --> 02:06:23,353
- Besides from being far away...
- ...far away...

1597
02:06:23,450 --> 02:06:26,232
I always remember you with
love and respect.

1598
02:06:28,186 --> 02:06:31,033
Say hi to do
Leonor and Chupito,...

1599
02:06:31,865 --> 02:06:34,865
to Pechuga and the rest
of the escorts,...

1600
02:06:34,970 --> 02:06:36,792
I will never forget you.

1601
02:06:37,786 --> 02:06:40,469
Hugs...

1602
02:06:41,626 --> 02:06:45,422
Pantale Pantoja, captain of
the Peruvian army.

1603
02:06:48,346 --> 02:06:51,193
Start again, will you?
She's so pretty.

1604
02:06:58,906 --> 02:06:59,833
My dear tenent:...

1605
02:07:00,826 --> 02:07:04,622
I'm writing at 4.200 m above
the see level and minus 4 degrees.

1606
02:07:05,626 --> 02:07:08,473
General Collazos kept his promise
of sending me to...

1607
02:07:08,570 --> 02:07:10,392
loneliest and furthest post.

1608
02:07:11,386 --> 02:07:14,233
My mission is to keep
the territorial integrity...

1609
02:07:14,330 --> 02:07:16,152
and teaching people to
write and read.

1610
02:07:18,106 --> 02:07:22,862
The 1973 census registred
1.784.281 illiterate people,...

1611
02:07:22,970 --> 02:07:26,712
and this region has the highest
illeteracy level in the country:...

1612
02:07:26,810 --> 02:07:32,473
36,9%. That means,
658.399 illiterate people.

1613
02:07:36,346 --> 02:07:38,233
I... love...

1614
02:07:39,226 --> 02:07:42,073
I love my... Peru.

1615
02:07:43,066 --> 02:07:45,913
According to empiric research, the
individual's lerning process...

1616
02:07:46,010 --> 02:07:48,792
of 15 or older, and with an
IQ no lower than 80,...

1617
02:07:48,890 --> 02:07:51,672
would take between 6 to
9 months with two hours daily.

1618
02:07:51,770 --> 02:07:52,631
See you tomorrow.

1619
02:07:53,626 --> 02:07:55,513
Very good, every day better.

1620
02:07:55,610 --> 02:07:59,352
To respond to this demand,
I made 8 groups of 15 people,...

1621
02:07:59,450 --> 02:08:01,272
which means teaching
120 people.

1622
02:08:03,226 --> 02:08:07,022
It's an optimistic scennario, in 6 years
I could teach the entire region.

1623
02:08:08,026 --> 02:08:11,342
I keep on serving with
determination and honesty...

1624
02:08:11,449 --> 02:08:13,751
our glorious institution.

1625
02:08:14,746 --> 02:08:15,509
Panta.

1626
02:08:18,586 --> 02:08:19,913
Are you done with
the last group?

1627
02:08:19,939 --> 02:08:21,772
No, I'm still wating
for the 6 ・clock one.

1628
02:08:22,426 --> 02:08:24,313
But the absences level
is quite high.

1629
02:08:24,410 --> 02:08:27,192
And this variable can spoil
my expectations.

1630
02:08:27,290 --> 02:08:30,072
I will have to implement a home
visits program.

1631
02:08:30,170 --> 02:08:31,992
If there's no work,
you make it up.

1632
02:08:32,986 --> 02:08:35,833
- Don't you want to eat? Let's go home.
- I'm coming right away.

1633
02:08:39,706 --> 02:08:42,139
- You turned into a human chimeney
after being in the jungle.

1634
02:08:42,140 --> 02:08:43,826
- It's because of the
cold weather, Pocha.

1635
02:08:44,506 --> 02:08:47,786
- Because of the cold weather. -Well, I'll
wait for you at home. Don't be too late.

1636
01:06:47,729 --> 01:06:50,577
Is to try the improve the service.
