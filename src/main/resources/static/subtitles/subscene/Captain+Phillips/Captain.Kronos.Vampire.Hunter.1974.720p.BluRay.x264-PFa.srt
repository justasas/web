1
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,832
It must be terribly sinful.

2
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,232
What?

3
00:00:20,233 --> 00:00:23,165
Well, vanity is a
sin, isn't it, Ann?

4
00:00:23,166 --> 00:00:26,398
Well, if that's the
only one, you'll do.

5
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,398
There.

6
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,232
- Where are you going now?
- I'm going to get some flowers

7
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:33,224
to braid in your hair.

8
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:57,765
That was quick, Ann.

9
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,257
Did you fi...?

10
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,527
Ann?

11
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:50,631
Ann!

12
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,124
Ann?

13
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:05,064
And what crime have you committed?

14
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:08,091
I danced on a Sunday.

15
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:46,264
We're heading east.

16
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:47,765
That'll do.

17
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:49,223
Get on the wagon.

18
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,097
- Happy birthday.
- God bless you, my child.

19
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:23,226
And this to make it
a happier birthday.

20
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:31,997
It belonged to your dear mother. It was
her last wish that you should have it.

21
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:34,664
Happy birthday, dearest sister.

22
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:37,765
It's wonderful...

23
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,930
but I daren't wear it.

24
00:07:39,931 --> 00:07:41,297
What if I were to lose it?

25
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:42,331
No fear of that.

26
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:45,598
That lock's as tight and
cunning as a money lender.

27
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,631
May I go and show it to Petra?

28
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:48,731
May I, Papa?

29
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:49,765
Of course.

30
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:52,231
She'll be so envious.

31
00:07:52,232 --> 00:07:55,921
Mind you, get back
before dark, now.

32
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:37,131
What's your name, girl?

33
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:39,631
Carla.

34
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:41,297
I'm Grost...

35
00:09:41,298 --> 00:09:43,631
Professor Hieronymos Grost.

36
00:09:43,632 --> 00:09:44,964
Professor?

37
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:46,956
I profess to be.

38
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,798
What about him?

39
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,331
What's the "K" stand for?
Is he a king or something?

40
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:57,459
A king?

41
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:03,765
Yes, in a way, I suppose he is.

42
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:06,598
But the "K" stands for Kronos...

43
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:09,631
Captain Kronos, late
of the Imperial Guard.

44
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:13,164
Well, if he's not a king, why does
he leave us to do all the work?

45
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:14,797
He has to conserve his strength.

46
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:18,131
We've ridden far,
and tomorrow we will be...

47
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:20,131
where we must be.

48
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:22,797
And that's when his
work will begin again.

49
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:24,631
Work? What-what work?

50
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:27,691
I'm turning in, Grost.

51
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:41,064
Where do I sleep?

52
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:45,030
We've only blankets enough for two.

53
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:46,863
Suit yourself.

54
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:54,628
Good night.

55
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:20,659
Isabella?

56
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:23,730
Isabella?

57
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:31,194
Isabella?

58
00:11:42,998 --> 00:11:44,557
Isabella?!

59
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:27,964
Marcus?

60
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:29,663
Aye.

61
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,963
Dr. Marcus lives here.

62
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:35,997
Who wants him?

63
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:37,762
Marcus!

64
00:13:03,464 --> 00:13:05,193
Kronos.

65
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:13,063
Marcus.

66
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:16,726
You ol' leech lover.

67
00:13:30,097 --> 00:13:32,430
Who is he?

68
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:34,096
Him in there?

69
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:35,930
Your master.

70
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:38,096
His name's Kronos.

71
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:39,896
Captain Kronos.

72
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:42,263
And he's not my master.

73
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:45,096
I'm merely an old army
friend passing through.

74
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:47,397
As you wish.

75
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:50,397
Your letter urged us
to make all speed,

76
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:53,330
but gave no reason.

77
00:13:53,331 --> 00:13:56,829
Young girls suddenly
become greatly aged.

78
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,163
Is that sufficient reason?

79
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:04,223
And these girls, they died
with blood upon their lips?

80
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:07,556
Yes. Why?

81
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:10,163
Vampires.

82
00:14:10,164 --> 00:14:11,530
What?

83
00:14:11,531 --> 00:14:13,030
No, it can't be.

84
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,596
What he doesn't know
about vampirism

85
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:17,829
wouldn't fill a flea's codpiece.

86
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,128
Vampires.

87
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:27,996
Dr. Marcus, it is commonly
supposed that a vampire attacks

88
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:30,696
in only one way...
by biting the neck

89
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:32,163
and draining the victim of blood.

90
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:33,629
But that's true.

91
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,863
The girls you spoke of,

92
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:39,529
they were not drained
of blood but of youth.

93
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,529
Of life itself.

94
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,497
You see, Doctor, there are
as many species of vampire

95
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:47,529
as there are beasts of prey.

96
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:51,963
Their methods and their motive for attack
can vary in a hundred different ways.

97
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:54,096
And the means of their destruction.

98
00:14:54,097 --> 00:14:59,192
Aye, traditional stake through the heart
does not always hold good, you know.

99
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:05,430
Some can only be destroyed
by hanging or decapitation.

100
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,930
Or fire or water.

101
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:10,297
Or by other means.

102
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:12,430
But these girls were invulnerable.

103
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:13,930
Each one wore a crucifix.

104
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:17,096
The cross can only protect
those who firmly believe.

105
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:20,596
But these were good girls
from God-fearing families.

106
00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:24,987
Perhaps their minds were not their
own at the moment of attack.

107
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,297
I suspect mesmerism in this.

108
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:30,462
Mesmerism?

109
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,462
Hypnotism.

110
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,763
The subjugation of the mind.

111
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:35,430
Oh, you don't believe
in that nonsense.

112
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:37,930
Well, it is highly improbable.

113
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:40,930
What could be more
improbable than God?

114
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:43,763
But I believe in Him.

115
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:45,130
And I, too, but...

116
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:46,963
Thank you.

117
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:48,996
Vampires?

118
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:50,263
Oh, come now, Doctor.

119
00:15:50,264 --> 00:15:53,363
You had already reached
the same conclusion.

120
00:15:53,364 --> 00:15:55,753
Or why else send for us?

121
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:05,729
Vampires...

122
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,823
here in Durward.

123
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,796
I suppose you'll be moving on now?

124
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:48,924
No, I'm staying.

125
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,629
If you'll have me.

126
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,396
Oh...

127
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:56,525
I'll have you.

128
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:14,130
- What is it? What's happening?
- Time for us to start work.

129
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,230
- You want to come along?
- What work?

130
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:17,729
Oh, didn't I mention it?

131
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,491
We're vampire hunters.
Professional vampire hunters.

132
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,496
Paul?

133
00:19:47,497 --> 00:19:49,886
Dr. Marcus.

134
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:54,663
To my shame,
I'd completely forgotten.

135
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:57,863
Seven years. Is it so long?

136
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,230
To the day.

137
00:20:11,164 --> 00:20:14,796
Days and years flit
by like a whisper,

138
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,329
taking its toll of all of us.

139
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,496
- And healing old wounds.
- For some, but not all.

140
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:25,362
Your mother still bears a grudge?

141
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:28,229
My father died in
your hands, remember?

142
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,896
Yes, but of a plague, a virulence.
There was nothing I could do.

143
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:34,162
There was no hope.

144
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:38,463
I understand that, my dear,
Marcus, but my mother...

145
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:40,591
She's there?

146
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,830
You must allow me.

147
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:45,396
My Lady Durward.

148
00:20:45,397 --> 00:20:47,922
She will not acknowledge
you, Doctor.

149
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:51,226
Paul...

150
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:53,930
Her face.

151
00:20:53,931 --> 00:20:55,529
She's become so aged.

152
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,097
Your mother's sick. She's ill.

153
00:20:57,098 --> 00:20:58,296
With grief.

154
00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:00,729
If only she would
let me examine her.

155
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,162
She will see no one.

156
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:04,429
- Least of all you, Dr. Marcus.
- Paul...

157
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,989
Good day, Doctor.

158
00:21:07,263 --> 00:21:08,993
Paul?

159
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,623
Toad in the hole.

160
00:22:16,063 --> 00:22:18,896
Not many more to do.

161
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:20,922
Mark the spot.

162
00:22:58,797 --> 00:23:01,463
It's an old Chinese herb.

163
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:02,796
Herb?

164
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:06,129
I ought to be out
scouring the countryside,

165
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,463
chasing after phantoms.

166
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:10,557
Isn't that what you're thinking?

167
00:23:12,564 --> 00:23:14,995
Never rush into a
battle unprepared.

168
00:23:14,996 --> 00:23:18,463
Remember, the war taught
us that, if nothing else.

169
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:23,663
There's a time to think, a time
to plan and a time to act,

170
00:23:23,664 --> 00:23:27,393
and that time will come
soon enough, don't worry.

171
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:31,796
I see my needlework has held good.

172
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:33,796
Mm-mmm.

173
00:23:33,797 --> 00:23:37,463
I know you've got guts, Kronos.

174
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:39,353
I've seen them.

175
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,855
Evening.

176
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:58,062
I play chess.

177
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:00,129
And I have a bottle
of very good wine

178
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,121
tucked away for a rainy day.

179
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:10,123
It's pouring.

180
00:25:01,896 --> 00:25:06,456
Queen to king, and mate in one.

181
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:10,396
There was blood on the mouth.

182
00:25:10,397 --> 00:25:13,895
In the church.

183
00:25:13,896 --> 00:25:16,463
Blood on the mouth.

184
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:18,895
Just the mouth.

185
00:25:18,896 --> 00:25:21,362
Why?

186
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:23,956
That's how he attacks them.

187
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,396
Through the kiss.

188
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,495
Oh...! Ooh...

189
00:25:39,697 --> 00:25:42,824
Oh...

190
00:26:02,764 --> 00:26:04,262
What's wrong?

191
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,186
I thought I saw someone over there.

192
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:10,362
Ah, you're imagining things.

193
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:11,929
No, there was someone.

194
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,529
Probably a forester.

195
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,563
No, it was someone old.

196
00:26:15,564 --> 00:26:17,262
Someone very old.

197
00:26:17,263 --> 00:26:19,219
I think it was a man...

198
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,196
Oh, really, I ought
to be going now.

199
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:33,463
I'll take you home.

200
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:36,195
And have my father see you?
He'd skin me alive and you, too.

201
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:37,288
Well, look, you can't go alone.

202
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:39,262
Not with everything that's
been happening around here.

203
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:41,962
Now, look, there's the edge of the
forest, and there's my house.

204
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:44,296
Now, what could possibly happen
in that short a distance?

205
00:26:44,297 --> 00:26:47,263
Ah, well, just the same, I'll stay here
and watch till you're out of the woods.

206
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:50,229
Silly. Silly.

207
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,455
See you tomorrow.

208
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,359
Myra?!

209
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,728
Myra...

210
00:27:47,729 --> 00:27:49,561
Myra.

211
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,389
Myra!

212
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:10,454
Another, and this time,
we have an eyewitness!

213
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:32,495
I stood and watched her, and
she was never out of sight.

214
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:35,161
Never completely out of sight.

215
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:37,328
But you saw no one else?

216
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,328
No one at all?

217
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:41,995
No. Oh, Myra thought
she saw someone.

218
00:28:41,996 --> 00:28:43,657
Who did she see?

219
00:28:44,496 --> 00:28:46,995
Just someone very old, she said.

220
00:28:46,996 --> 00:28:50,089
Very old.

221
00:29:33,662 --> 00:29:35,061
You're mystified?

222
00:29:35,062 --> 00:29:36,295
Mm!

223
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:38,961
Well, you've a right to be.

224
00:29:38,962 --> 00:29:42,295
Grost ringed the forest
with dead toads.

225
00:29:42,296 --> 00:29:44,694
"If a vampire should bestrode

226
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:47,595
"close to the grave of a dead toad,

227
00:29:47,596 --> 00:29:50,428
"then the vampire life shall give,

228
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:54,594
and suddenly the toad shall live."

229
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:58,228
It's an old folk rhyme,
and like most of them,

230
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,060
there's a grain of truth in it.

231
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:28,995
"Then the vampire life shall give,

232
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:32,260
and suddenly the toad shall live."

233
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:42,794
A coach or a wagon of some kind.

234
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:48,495
Recent, too.

235
00:30:48,496 --> 00:30:51,128
Four horses.

236
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:53,861
Grost!

237
00:30:53,862 --> 00:30:57,262
We'll ride over that
way, take a look.

238
00:30:57,263 --> 00:31:00,594
Look for what, someone very old?

239
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:02,095
On the contrary.

240
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:06,228
This thing attacks to
sustain life, youth.

241
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:08,794
That's what we'll be seeking.

242
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:11,561
A cheek with a bloom to it.

243
00:31:11,562 --> 00:31:13,961
Someone young and fair.

244
00:31:13,962 --> 00:31:16,692
Fetch the horses!

245
00:31:26,463 --> 00:31:29,351
Hmm... dead end.

246
00:31:30,363 --> 00:31:32,328
What lies down there?

247
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:33,328
Oh, the village.

248
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:34,961
Oh, it's hardly a village.

249
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:36,895
Just a few houses and a tavern.

250
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,694
We'll try it.

251
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:44,861
It'd make better sense

252
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:47,091
if I stayed and had a
look 'round up here.

253
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:08,592
Whoa.

254
00:32:20,528 --> 00:32:21,961
Now, there's a funny thing.

255
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:23,128
What's a funny thing?

256
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:24,461
That soldier fellow.

257
00:32:24,462 --> 00:32:26,195
The chap who's staying
with Dr. Marcus.

258
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,494
And what about him?

259
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:29,328
Going around asking
if anybody's seen

260
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:31,295
ought of a coach or
a wagon 'round here

261
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:32,794
in the past few hours?

262
00:32:32,795 --> 00:32:35,961
Offering a golden guinea to
anybody who can help him.

263
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:37,262
A golden guinea.

264
00:32:37,263 --> 00:32:39,095
A man could buy himself
a deal of pleasure

265
00:32:39,096 --> 00:32:40,628
with that kind of money, eh, Molly?

266
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:41,794
Aye.

267
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:42,794
Is Kerro here?

268
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,295
- He's around.
- Where?

269
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,295
He's upstairs.

270
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,794
With a doxy.

271
00:32:46,795 --> 00:32:48,684
Here he is now.

272
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,728
Here, girl.

273
00:33:44,729 --> 00:33:46,828
And that's double
what you're worth.

274
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:49,752
You promised me more.

275
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:51,761
You promised.

276
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:54,151
And so I did.

277
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:22,084
You're not laughing.

278
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,228
Laugh.

279
00:34:26,229 --> 00:34:28,254
Please, Kerro.

280
00:34:29,263 --> 00:34:31,992
Laugh, I'm telling you.

281
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:36,251
I'll be damned if I will.

282
00:34:46,762 --> 00:34:48,423
Laugh.

283
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:52,526
Louder.

284
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,726
Louder.

285
00:34:59,395 --> 00:35:03,250
Oh, that's much better.

286
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:26,784
There's a good boy.

287
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,462
Bye.

288
00:35:41,262 --> 00:35:43,128
Kerro.

289
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:57,261
When you talk to him, speak soft.

290
00:35:57,262 --> 00:35:58,958
I'll do better than that.

291
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:02,794
I'll speak money.

292
00:36:49,262 --> 00:36:51,961
Dr. Marcus...

293
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,327
this is an unexpected pleasure.

294
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:55,961
Paul.

295
00:36:55,962 --> 00:36:57,995
Good day to you.

296
00:36:57,996 --> 00:36:59,162
I was just passing.

297
00:36:59,163 --> 00:37:00,494
I thought the least I could do

298
00:37:00,495 --> 00:37:02,261
is to offer my respects
to your mother.

299
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:05,361
And I shall be pleased
to convey them to her.

300
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:07,728
But I doubt if she
will even listen.

301
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,895
But a kind thought nonetheless.

302
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:14,895
Paul...

303
00:37:14,896 --> 00:37:17,061
A brandy to warm you
after your ride?

304
00:37:17,062 --> 00:37:19,018
Thank you.

305
00:37:26,929 --> 00:37:29,352
Mmm. It will be most welcome.

306
00:37:30,462 --> 00:37:32,028
How is your mother?

307
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:34,028
No better.

308
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:36,995
But your dear sister,
Sara, she's well?

309
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:38,361
Very.

310
00:37:38,362 --> 00:37:40,660
I'm delighted to hear it.

311
00:37:42,462 --> 00:37:44,061
Your health, Doctor.

312
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,594
Thank you.

313
00:37:46,595 --> 00:37:49,291
Witchcraft and Necromancy.

314
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:52,261
The book.

315
00:37:52,262 --> 00:37:53,961
Oh, it was my father's.

316
00:37:53,962 --> 00:37:56,661
At long last I'm setting
his library to rights.

317
00:37:56,662 --> 00:38:00,194
Witchcraft and Necromancy.

318
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:03,561
That's the rumor in the village.

319
00:38:03,562 --> 00:38:06,461
Yes. A grim business.

320
00:38:06,462 --> 00:38:08,261
What's your opinion of it?

321
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:12,294
My brother does not form opinions
too readily, Dr. Marcus.

322
00:38:12,295 --> 00:38:14,294
Oh, no.

323
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:17,059
He broods upon a
problem a long time.

324
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:23,428
Is that not so, Paul?

325
00:38:23,429 --> 00:38:25,061
You know I would not dare

326
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:27,257
to disagree with you, dear sister.

327
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:36,928
My dear Sara, you look
lovelier than ever.

328
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:38,594
And younger.

329
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:39,761
What's your secret?

330
00:38:39,762 --> 00:38:42,394
Well, she's not exactly
an aged crone, you know.

331
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:44,661
Nor ever will be.

332
00:38:44,662 --> 00:38:48,528
"Crone" is such an ugly
word, don't you think?

333
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:51,728
Such an ugly thing to be.

334
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:55,119
No, I don't think I
shall ever be one.

335
00:38:56,762 --> 00:38:58,684
Am I unwell, Doctor?

336
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,694
You're studying me so closely,

337
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:02,928
I thought, perhaps, you
could detect some malady

338
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,628
in my face.

339
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:07,294
No, your face is perfect...

340
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:08,594
magically perfect.

341
00:39:08,595 --> 00:39:10,188
Magic?

342
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:13,227
Well, I must be on my way.

343
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:14,594
Sara.

344
00:39:14,595 --> 00:39:16,551
Paul, thank you for the brandy.

345
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:19,726
Good day to you both.

346
00:39:50,495 --> 00:39:52,494
Mother, you wanted me?

347
00:39:52,495 --> 00:39:55,094
Yes.

348
00:39:55,095 --> 00:39:58,928
Someone called just now.

349
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,094
It was Dr. Marcus.

350
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:02,594
Marcus?

351
00:40:02,595 --> 00:40:04,227
What did he want?

352
00:40:04,228 --> 00:40:06,461
He said he was just passing by.

353
00:40:06,462 --> 00:40:08,628
Called to pay his respects.

354
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:11,661
Passing by?

355
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:15,256
This road doesn't lead anywhere.

356
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:19,261
I know, Mother.

357
00:40:19,262 --> 00:40:21,560
I know.

358
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:39,194
Red wine.

359
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:40,294
The best you have.

360
00:40:40,295 --> 00:40:41,718
Yes, sir.

361
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:48,795
Tell me, have you seen
anything of a coach or a wagon

362
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:51,127
passing by recently?

363
00:40:51,128 --> 00:40:54,227
Nothing passes by here.

364
00:40:54,228 --> 00:40:59,194
Only... soldiers... deserters,
running away from the war.

365
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:01,428
Come in here with big talk
of the battles they won...

366
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:04,861
or with the look of lost
battles about them.

367
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:06,494
What about you, Captain?

368
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:07,628
'Tis "Captain"?

369
00:41:07,629 --> 00:41:09,426
Perhaps he stole the coat.

370
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:17,086
Tell me, did you lose
your battles or win them?

371
00:41:18,429 --> 00:41:21,761
A little of both.

372
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:24,151
And not enough of either.

373
00:41:29,162 --> 00:41:31,428
You haven't answered my question.

374
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:33,094
Coach or a wagon?

375
00:41:33,095 --> 00:41:37,019
Hey, you... crookback.

376
00:41:41,629 --> 00:41:43,188
Tell me, uh...

377
00:41:44,095 --> 00:41:45,927
how do you sleep at night?

378
00:41:45,928 --> 00:41:48,227
On your belly or...
or in a hammock?

379
00:41:48,228 --> 00:41:50,094
Or do you stick a
hole in the ground

380
00:41:50,095 --> 00:41:51,361
and put your hump in it?

381
00:41:51,362 --> 00:41:55,319
You see, we're
interested, crookback.

382
00:41:58,328 --> 00:42:01,694
His name is Grost.

383
00:42:01,695 --> 00:42:03,428
Crookback will do for me.

384
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:04,594
But not me.

385
00:42:04,595 --> 00:42:05,761
Why?

386
00:42:05,762 --> 00:42:07,628
'Cause I don't like it.

387
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:10,426
Oh...

388
00:42:14,995 --> 00:42:17,327
He doesn't like it.

389
00:42:18,295 --> 00:42:20,694
To make sport of a
physical affliction

390
00:42:20,695 --> 00:42:24,894
is both impolite and cruel.

391
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:28,528
After all, I wouldn't
dream of calling you...

392
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:30,088
rat face...

393
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:34,719
fatty...

394
00:42:38,128 --> 00:42:39,892
or big mouth.

395
00:43:29,662 --> 00:43:33,361
You still haven't
answered my question.

396
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:35,327
Wagons or coaches, sir?

397
00:43:35,328 --> 00:43:36,994
No, we haven't seen
nothing like that.

398
00:43:36,995 --> 00:43:39,528
We haven't seen nothing at all.

399
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:41,258
Pity.

400
00:43:59,295 --> 00:44:02,127
Marcus.

401
00:44:02,128 --> 00:44:04,727
Stand.

402
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,260
Dr. Marcus.

403
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:09,594
Sara?

404
00:44:09,595 --> 00:44:11,961
Marcus.

405
00:45:16,428 --> 00:45:18,394
They made sport of me, Kronos.

406
00:45:18,395 --> 00:45:19,988
They laughed at me.

407
00:45:27,761 --> 00:45:31,719
Am I so terribly ugly to
provoke such mockery?

408
00:45:33,894 --> 00:45:36,522
Am I?

409
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:43,826
Beauty fades, eventually, but
a kind soul remains forever.

410
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:46,760
My mother taught me that.

411
00:45:46,761 --> 00:45:50,594
She was a gifted woman.

412
00:45:50,595 --> 00:45:52,018
Very gifted.

413
00:45:54,694 --> 00:45:58,726
And you, my friend,
my very dear friend,

414
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:01,793
your body was given to you by God.

415
00:46:01,794 --> 00:46:04,456
Just remember that.

416
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:09,420
He also...

417
00:46:10,928 --> 00:46:13,658
gave me a good friend
to protect me.

418
00:46:18,261 --> 00:46:20,092
They were paid to laugh at you.

419
00:46:20,961 --> 00:46:22,294
Those men...

420
00:46:22,295 --> 00:46:25,060
they were paid to provoke
a fight and kill us both.

421
00:46:25,061 --> 00:46:27,227
Is that so?

422
00:46:27,228 --> 00:46:29,227
If what you say is right, then...

423
00:46:29,228 --> 00:46:31,355
It means we are getting close.

424
00:46:35,594 --> 00:46:38,119
Ah. Where did you get to?

425
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:41,927
I rode over to the Durwards.

426
00:46:41,928 --> 00:46:44,157
You saw nothing of a coach?

427
00:46:45,495 --> 00:46:48,053
No. No, nothing.

428
00:46:48,694 --> 00:46:50,593
What was it then?

429
00:46:50,594 --> 00:46:53,460
A physicking or a visiting?

430
00:46:55,428 --> 00:46:58,593
I hear that Sara Durward is
quite a pretty bed-full.

431
00:46:58,594 --> 00:47:01,153
It was just a social visit.

432
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:06,891
And you?

433
00:47:07,727 --> 00:47:13,321
Gained nothing, save a fumed
brain from too much wine.

434
00:47:15,194 --> 00:47:17,127
Still, nothing like
a leech or two...

435
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:21,227
a little blood-letting to
cool a man's veins, eh?

436
00:47:21,228 --> 00:47:24,726
Better remove our little
friends before they turn blue.

437
00:47:24,727 --> 00:47:26,127
Blue?

438
00:47:26,128 --> 00:47:30,527
I'm from very aristocratic stock.

439
00:47:30,528 --> 00:47:33,760
We are casting our net further
afield tonight, Doctor.

440
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:35,427
Do you want to come along?

441
00:47:35,428 --> 00:47:36,427
Yes.

442
00:47:36,428 --> 00:47:39,089
Good.

443
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:44,027
I will be looking for
something like these.

444
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,451
Only a little bigger.

445
00:50:33,394 --> 00:50:37,124
She has touched nothing.

446
00:50:41,561 --> 00:50:45,956
She just lies there, like
a thing already dead.

447
00:50:49,394 --> 00:50:51,993
I never knew such grief.

448
00:50:51,994 --> 00:50:55,160
She must have loved
Father very much.

449
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:57,660
Sara, perhaps if you
were to go to her...

450
00:50:57,661 --> 00:50:59,660
I can't.

451
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:04,160
I'm sorry, Paul, but I can't
bear to look at her anymore.

452
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:07,721
To look at that face that
was once so beautiful.

453
00:51:08,994 --> 00:51:13,927
Age... frightens me.

454
00:51:13,928 --> 00:51:14,960
I'm vain, I know,

455
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:18,660
but to look at Mother is to look into a
mirror of what one day I must become.

456
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:21,118
No.

457
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,660
We are Durwards, remember?

458
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:31,326
Thoroughbreds.

459
00:51:31,327 --> 00:51:35,660
The Durwards have always been
renowned for their usefulness.

460
00:51:35,661 --> 00:51:36,760
Mother is a Durward.

461
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:40,526
By marriage, not by birth.

462
00:51:40,527 --> 00:51:44,626
What has happened to Mother will
not happen to us, dear sister.

463
00:51:44,627 --> 00:51:47,027
I promise you.

464
00:51:47,028 --> 00:51:49,893
It will not happen to us.

465
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:22,320
You're rough with me.

466
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:32,990
So much bitterness.

467
00:52:33,761 --> 00:52:36,826
So much. Why?

468
00:52:36,827 --> 00:52:39,489
Why?

469
00:52:41,393 --> 00:52:45,026
I once went off to fight a war.

470
00:52:45,027 --> 00:52:49,259
I went off and left my mother
and my little sister behind me.

471
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,717
The two people that I love most.

472
00:52:53,327 --> 00:52:54,459
When I returned,

473
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,520
my sweet little sister
welcomed me with a kiss.

474
00:52:59,094 --> 00:53:01,760
Yes, both of them.

475
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:05,993
Mother and sister, fallen to
the scourge of vampirism.

476
00:53:05,994 --> 00:53:08,726
I had to destroy them!

477
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:12,693
I had to bare their breasts,
take a sharpened stake

478
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:16,026
and drive it through their hearts.

479
00:53:40,994 --> 00:53:43,053
Younger.

480
00:53:44,027 --> 00:53:46,756
Oh, no.

481
00:53:49,094 --> 00:53:50,823
Kronos!

482
00:53:52,627 --> 00:53:54,425
Kronos!

483
00:53:55,927 --> 00:53:57,593
Kronos!

484
00:53:57,594 --> 00:53:59,060
What is it? What's wrong?

485
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,290
My face. Look!

486
00:54:03,894 --> 00:54:06,555
Look at my face.

487
00:54:27,727 --> 00:54:29,354
Rope. Strong rope.

488
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:50,893
Well?

489
00:54:50,894 --> 00:54:53,726
Hm... hard to say.

490
00:54:53,727 --> 00:54:54,893
You see?

491
00:54:54,894 --> 00:54:56,392
He's been bitten on the mouth.

492
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:58,893
For God's sake, I survived
a vampire's bite.

493
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:02,226
But he is not the man you are.

494
00:55:02,227 --> 00:55:04,287
Marcus?

495
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:08,589
Marcus...

496
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,359
It was me, wasn't it?

497
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,893
That girl in the forest...

498
00:55:16,894 --> 00:55:19,060
it was I.

499
00:55:19,061 --> 00:55:21,060
Oh...

500
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:23,192
Yes.

501
00:55:23,193 --> 00:55:25,359
I'm doomed.

502
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,392
My soul in never-ending torment.

503
00:55:27,393 --> 00:55:29,226
It's... I...

504
00:55:29,227 --> 00:55:31,559
Oh, God.

505
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,960
Kill me!

506
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:37,893
Kill... kill me!

507
00:55:37,894 --> 00:55:39,760
If the situation were reversed,

508
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:41,926
you would implore
him to do the same.

509
00:55:41,927 --> 00:55:43,359
Kronos, this must be done.

510
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,893
We will not be killing him.

511
00:55:44,894 --> 00:55:45,926
He is dead already.

512
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:47,559
But his death will bring life.

513
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,259
It will give us the
knowledge we need

514
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:51,226
to destroy this thing
that has infected him.

515
00:55:51,227 --> 00:55:53,659
For pity's sake, finish it!

516
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,889
Finish it!

517
00:56:00,494 --> 00:56:03,360
Kill me!

518
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,617
So be it.

519
00:56:38,327 --> 00:56:40,886
Well, come on!

520
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:12,350
A vampire only bleeds at
the moment of its death.

521
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,692
Grost.

522
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:41,090
Myself...

523
00:58:43,026 --> 00:58:44,949
again.

524
00:58:55,926 --> 00:58:58,959
But how did...?

525
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,792
The flame didn't touch him.

526
00:59:20,926 --> 00:59:22,659
This is what killed him.

527
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,287
A simple cross.

528
00:59:30,893 --> 00:59:33,919
Made of steel.

529
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,926
Then we have our answer.

530
00:59:38,293 --> 00:59:40,182
Yes.

531
00:59:45,127 --> 00:59:47,050
And Marcus...

532
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:51,493
dear Marcus...

533
00:59:51,494 --> 00:59:55,293
is at peace at last.

534
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:20,626
Dr. Marcus was a good man,
and a bad one killed him.

535
01:00:20,627 --> 01:00:22,125
Aye.

536
01:00:22,126 --> 01:00:24,158
It was that stranger that did it.

537
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:26,459
Him and that hunchback.

538
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,225
They killed Dr. Marcus.

539
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:31,922
Murdered him in cold blood.

540
01:00:36,893 --> 01:00:39,350
We'll make it a life for a life.

541
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:03,418
Kronos!

542
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:04,724
Kronos.

543
01:04:09,026 --> 01:04:12,256
A sword fit for a king.

544
01:04:14,226 --> 01:04:17,456
Or a Kronos.

545
01:04:44,226 --> 01:04:45,925
Oh, Barton.

546
01:04:45,926 --> 01:04:47,658
You frightened the life out of me.

547
01:04:47,659 --> 01:04:49,524
I couldn't sleep.

548
01:04:49,525 --> 01:04:51,225
This damn storm.

549
01:04:51,226 --> 01:04:52,591
Nor I.

550
01:04:52,592 --> 01:04:54,259
Thought I'd warm a little milk.

551
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,888
We'll both be like
death in the morning.

552
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:14,325
I keep thinking of Vanda...
and Isabella.

553
01:05:14,326 --> 01:05:16,758
Well, don't.

554
01:05:16,759 --> 01:05:19,057
It's best that we don't.

555
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,916
Oh, I wish Father were home.

556
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:01,324
His reputation was formidable.

557
01:08:01,325 --> 01:08:04,192
It is said that few saw his blade,

558
01:08:05,493 --> 01:08:09,292
but only felt it when
it found its mark.

559
01:08:10,293 --> 01:08:12,259
He never met his match.

560
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:15,324
Except in God.

561
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:18,391
He was kin to you?

562
01:08:18,392 --> 01:08:20,892
He was my father.

563
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:23,058
Oh.

564
01:08:23,059 --> 01:08:27,124
Forgive me, I did not know that
I stood with my Lady Durward.

565
01:08:27,525 --> 01:08:31,058
Kronos. Captain Kronos, m'lady.

566
01:08:31,059 --> 01:08:33,924
Sara?

567
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:38,021
M'lady.

568
01:08:56,992 --> 01:08:59,789
Is it possible, Grost?

569
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:06,558
Marcus said he went up
to see the Durwards.

570
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:09,025
But such a creature.

571
01:09:09,026 --> 01:09:14,357
She is beautiful,
young and fair and...

572
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:17,058
Exactly.

573
01:09:17,059 --> 01:09:20,856
Well, we'll know one way
or another soon enough.

574
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,114
Garlic flower.

575
01:10:08,726 --> 01:10:11,648
You're sure you want to
go through with this?

576
01:10:12,358 --> 01:10:14,158
You'll be the bait, you know?

577
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:15,925
I know.

578
01:10:15,926 --> 01:10:17,791
Excuse me.

579
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:58,688
Time to make our move, my friend.

580
01:11:00,926 --> 01:11:03,723
Time to kill a vampire.

581
01:11:04,325 --> 01:11:05,986
Mother?

582
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:13,048
If only you would drink this,
you would feel stronger.

583
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:40,751
Where the devil is Barlow?

584
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:54,581
Thank you, sir.

585
01:12:55,759 --> 01:12:59,023
Now, an explanation, I think.

586
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:01,825
What were you doing out there?

587
01:13:02,826 --> 01:13:07,291
Getting more frightened every
minute. More and more lost.

588
01:13:07,292 --> 01:13:09,858
I ran away, sir, from my father.

589
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:12,458
He would force me into marriage
when it's another I love.

590
01:13:12,459 --> 01:13:17,958
Please, if I could stay here just
for tonight, sir. I beg of you.

591
01:13:17,959 --> 01:13:21,591
- Of course, you may stay.
- I'll prepare a room.

592
01:13:21,592 --> 01:13:23,157
No. No, Your Ladyship.

593
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:26,491
I've already presumed too
much on your kindness.

594
01:13:26,492 --> 01:13:28,491
Nonsense... it'll
take but a moment.

595
01:13:28,492 --> 01:13:32,224
I can stay here... before the fire.
I'd prefer it.

596
01:13:33,225 --> 01:13:36,480
Very well, then. As you wish.

597
01:13:58,759 --> 01:14:00,591
Good night to you, then.

598
01:14:00,592 --> 01:14:02,389
Good night.

599
01:14:12,826 --> 01:14:15,589
Good night, dear sister.

600
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:36,690
Sleep well.

601
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:24,055
Sara, what the devil's going on?

602
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:29,491
Paul...

603
01:18:29,492 --> 01:18:31,653
her face.

604
01:18:32,758 --> 01:18:34,556
Her face!

605
01:18:40,691 --> 01:18:42,489
Mother?

606
01:18:44,259 --> 01:18:47,890
The bloom of youth...

607
01:18:47,891 --> 01:18:51,524
why should that appall you?

608
01:18:51,525 --> 01:18:54,948
Is it wrong to be young
and beautiful again?

609
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:00,191
You forget...
I'm a Costine by birth,

610
01:19:00,192 --> 01:19:04,957
and the Costines are blessed
with many dark secrets.

611
01:19:06,592 --> 01:19:09,591
It has taken me seven years...

612
01:19:09,592 --> 01:19:13,358
seven long years to
bring them into play,

613
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:16,424
to make me what I am now:

614
01:19:16,425 --> 01:19:20,324
never to grow old.

615
01:19:20,325 --> 01:19:23,657
Isn't that as precious
as life itself?

616
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:26,624
It is life itself.

617
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:29,324
And so life begins again.

618
01:19:29,325 --> 01:19:34,324
Begins again for me
and for your father.

619
01:19:34,325 --> 01:19:35,824
Father is dead.

620
01:19:35,825 --> 01:19:37,091
No.

621
01:19:37,092 --> 01:19:38,957
Father is dead.

622
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:40,124
Dead of the plague.

623
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:43,258
No.

624
01:19:43,259 --> 01:19:45,857
Never dead.

625
01:19:45,858 --> 01:19:49,424
Just sleeping...

626
01:19:49,425 --> 01:19:52,791
as you shall see for yourself.

627
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:16,924
I awakened him, brought
him back from the dead.

628
01:20:16,925 --> 01:20:19,391
My husband...

629
01:20:19,392 --> 01:20:22,657
my lover...

630
01:20:22,658 --> 01:20:25,581
back into my arms.

631
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:32,924
But I see you do not understand.

632
01:20:32,925 --> 01:20:35,348
Come here, my children.

633
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:42,753
Come here.

634
01:21:08,958 --> 01:21:12,523
You will remember nothing
of what has passed here.

635
01:21:12,524 --> 01:21:16,482
Do you understand?

636
01:21:19,325 --> 01:21:24,358
Later, you will awaken
and remember nothing.

637
01:21:24,359 --> 01:21:27,657
Come, my darling.

638
01:21:42,425 --> 01:21:44,915
Her life will be yours.

639
01:21:46,058 --> 01:21:48,991
Yours.

640
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:53,757
Her youth will pulse through
your veins, my darling.

641
01:21:55,524 --> 01:21:57,458
Replenishing...

642
01:21:57,459 --> 01:21:59,915
restoring...

643
01:22:02,192 --> 01:22:05,490
Take her.

644
01:22:05,491 --> 01:22:08,255
Take her!

645
01:22:54,359 --> 01:22:56,486
My Lord Durward.

646
01:23:00,558 --> 01:23:03,015
At your service, sir.

647
01:23:06,891 --> 01:23:08,157
To the death.

648
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:10,887
So be it.

649
01:24:04,825 --> 01:24:08,918
Yes, you bleed, my lord.

650
01:24:12,025 --> 01:24:14,288
This is God's blade.

651
01:24:15,325 --> 01:24:18,918
Forged for your black heart.

652
01:24:55,592 --> 01:24:57,686
Die!

653
01:26:18,826 --> 01:26:21,623
You can't hurt me, Kronos.

654
01:26:22,659 --> 01:26:24,358
No.

655
01:26:24,359 --> 01:26:26,020
You can't kill me.

656
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:31,255
Kronos!

657
01:29:02,759 --> 01:29:05,025
Marcus.

658
01:29:05,026 --> 01:29:07,415
Dear Marcus.

659
01:29:17,759 --> 01:29:20,091
You must go now.

660
01:29:21,592 --> 01:29:23,658
Go where?

661
01:29:23,659 --> 01:29:25,158
Anywhere.

662
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:26,725
Everywhere.

663
01:29:26,726 --> 01:29:29,956
Wherever there is
evil to be fought.

664
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:33,825
But on lonely nights,

665
01:29:33,826 --> 01:29:37,249
I shall think of you.
