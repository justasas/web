1
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:17,840
CAPTAIN PANTOJA AND
THE SPECIAL SERVICE...

2
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,307
You're sure this is our man?

3
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,537
Intelligence investigated his life...

4
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,943
private and professional.

5
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,879
Entered the Academy...

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,109
first place.

7
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,049
Chose administration.

8
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:03,983
He was...

9
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,283
class valedictorian.

10
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,517
He hoisted the flag...

11
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,286
in every yearly closing ceremony.

12
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,627
And even to date...

13
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,495
no cadet has matched his average.

14
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:19,895
He prefers sports and studying...

15
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,067
but also socializes.

16
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,169
Here he is with Alfonsina Reano...

17
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,743
they married three years later.

18
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,745
She's a decent girl...

19
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,848
down to earth, good housewife.

20
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,879
This looks nice!

21
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,783
I wonder where they'll send us.
Don't you?

22
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,720
Anywhere they say is good for me.

23
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,790
Right.

24
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:44,462
You married the army before me.

25
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,393
Where would you like them
to send us?

26
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,068
Chiclayo, again. Maybe Tacna.

27
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:53,769
What about the mountains
or the jungle?

28
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,465
I hate the mountains.

29
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,473
The jungle... Maybe Iquitos.

30
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,110
As long as it's a city...

31
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,213
and not some camp.

32
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,039
Think of our little cadet.

33
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,945
Now we can send for him, right?

34
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:06,983
Now?

35
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,815
Maybe.

36
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,480
Or tonight.
Who cares if it's not Saturday?

37
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,692
I'm late, Pochita.

38
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,953
It's half an hour to the ministry...

39
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,586
disregarding traffic.

40
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:22,494
All right. Let's eat breakfast,
Captain, sir.

41
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:30,205
I have an appointment
with the General.

42
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,207
Yes, Captain. He's waiting for you.

43
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:41,916
Congratulations,
on your brilliant promotion.

44
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:42,712
Thanks, sir.

45
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,548
I heard of your promotion.

46
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:48,591
First place by unanimous decision!

47
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,022
Congratulations.

48
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,960
Thank you, General, sir.

49
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,894
Sit down.

50
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,671
Cigarette?

51
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,464
No, thanks.

52
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,631
You see?

53
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,366
He doesn't smoke or drink.

54
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,340
No bad habits.

55
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,072
He can represent our army
in paradise...

56
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,249
next to Saint Martin and Saint Rose.

57
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,383
I must have some habits
you don't know about.

58
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,556
We know everything about you.

59
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,683
You wouldn't believe how much.

60
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,420
Well...

61
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,554
let's cut to the chase.

62
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:29,657
The mission
we are about to give you...

63
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,930
is of the utmost secrecy.

64
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,308
Here's the thing, Pantoja:

65
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,309
Recently,
our troops in the jungle have been...

66
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,171
riled up.

67
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,113
At first, we thought...

68
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,344
there were only isolated occurrences...

69
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:51,250
maybe caused by the climate
or their diet.

70
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,290
But things...

71
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,621
have gotten worse.

72
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,524
General Scavino
and especially Father Beltran...

73
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:03,500
whose daily memos
I'm up to here with...

74
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,536
have taken some action.

75
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,071
But no type of punishment...

76
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,106
has solved the problem.

77
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:13,269
So, more drastic measures
are in order.

78
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,677
That's where you come in.

79
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,450
I don't understand, General, sir...

80
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,655
This is a very important mission.

81
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:27,317
General Scavino will brief you
upon your arrival.

82
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,528
You will leave on Monday.

83
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,491
I hope you like the jungle.

84
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:35,394
From now on,
you have all my support...

85
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,797
on this difficult task.

86
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,137
I wish you luck.

87
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,608
The army's prestige...

88
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,838
is in your hands.

89
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,745
And as paladin of the Amazon...

90
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,680
I feel compelled to raise my voice...

91
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,049
to defend the women of our land!

92
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,525
I am not unpatriotic.

93
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:03,586
But my love for the army...

94
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,492
can't make me hide the truth.

95
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,796
The raping wave that is
sweeping our region...

96
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:14,703
tarnishing the honor
of our beautiful women...

97
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,932
has a guilty party!

98
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:22,146
The rapists are the soldiers
of our army!

99
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,875
Yes, ladies and gentlemen...

100
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,780
our very own soldiers.

101
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,786
It's hard to admit it...

102
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:34,217
but I have irrefutable evidence!

103
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,628
What is happening to our army?

104
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,298
What do...

105
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,933
the authorities have to say about it?

106
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:49,532
Captain Pantaleon Pantoja
is entrusted with...

107
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,903
the mission of implementing...

108
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:57,141
a "Visitors' Service for Garrisons,
Border Posts...

109
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,715
and Related Quarters"
to fulfill the needs of...

110
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,720
Excuse me, sir.

111
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,426
What do you mean by "visitors"?

112
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:08,855
Do you mean...?

113
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:09,893
Whores!

114
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,128
Yes, whores!

115
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,396
General Collazos
and his strategists from Lima...

116
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,798
have concocted the idea
of taking women...

117
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,565
from camp to camp,
so the troops may fornicate.

118
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,936
And you, a Peruvian army Captain...

119
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,276
will be acting as pimp...

120
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,011
or whatever sex merchants
are called.

121
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:37,818
Excuse me, sir.

122
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,860
I don't consider myself fit
for this mission.

123
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,422
Please reconsider...

124
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:47,260
It's too late.
It's an order to be obeyed.

125
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,300
I will do my best.

126
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:54,270
I don't want you in these headquarters
or in any other.

127
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,201
You are excused from attending
official ceremonies, parades, etc.

128
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,210
And I forbid you to dress in uniform.

129
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,150
Even at my workplace?

130
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:11,379
Your work will be done far away
from headquarters.

131
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,922
What kind of support will I have
for my mission?

132
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,287
An officer has been appointed.

133
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,999
Lieutenant Bacacorzo...

134
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,897
will serve as liaison between you
and your superiors.

135
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,435
Any other questions, Captain?

136
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:35,807
We won't live in the villa
with the other officers.

137
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,743
- Why?
- I'm sorry.

138
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,508
We will be civilians.

139
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,585
I will pose as a merchant
on business.

140
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:46,656
I don't understand your job.
Why do we have to hide?

141
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,559
I'm talking to you.

142
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,095
I'm listening Pantaleon Pantoja,
tell me what this is about.

143
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:57,894
There would never be lies between us,
remember?

144
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,570
Why won't you tell me?

145
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,407
I'll be working in the...

146
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,371
Intelligence Service.

147
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,871
Intelligence Service?

148
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,779
Now I understand the mystery!

149
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,954
What must you find out?

150
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,349
I can't tell you.
Orders.

151
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,855
Come on.
Who do you have to spy?

152
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,555
Is it war with Ecuador?

153
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,530
Does it have to do
with the Rio Protocol?

154
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:38,410
You can't imagine what keeping
my mission from my wife is like.

155
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,707
I've never lied to her, Lieutenant.

156
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:42,743
Ever.

157
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:47,708
Many would want to be in your shoes,
Captain.

158
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,818
Not me.

159
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,683
I'm in a jam.

160
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,421
How can I organize this service?

161
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,788
I've had no contact with prostitutes!

162
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,629
Where do I start?

163
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:00,889
At the beginning.

164
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,503
Go to a brothel and look.

165
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,931
I recommend Madam Leonor's...

166
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,274
better known as Chuchupe.

167
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,838
She's closing, and her girls
will be out of a job.

168
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,778
They're the best around.

169
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,682
I would come with you...

170
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,321
but you know
Scavino's orders.

171
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,833
- Hello, cutie.
- Hello.

172
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,443
- Do you dance?
- Sorry.

173
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,779
I don't dance.

174
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,043
You like cutting to the chase, huh?

175
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:01,912
Me too.

176
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,014
But you have to buy a ticket first.

177
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,554
You don't understand.

178
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:10,228
I'm not here to... satisfy my needs.

179
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:14,024
I'm here to talk with Mrs. Leonor.

180
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,062
Could you tell her, please?

181
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,764
I'd be glad to.

182
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,764
We can still do it.

183
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,534
Listen.

184
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,777
Look for me when you are through.

185
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,644
I just love
clean-cut boys like you.

186
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,249
Good evening.

187
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,613
My name is Pantaleon Pantoja.

188
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,283
Welcome to Chuchupe's.

189
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,319
Here, we're nice to everyone...

190
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,763
except soldiers
who want to fuck for free.

191
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,964
What can I do for you?

192
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,601
I would like to talk business.

193
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,097
In private.

194
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,469
Are you telling me to go?

195
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,608
A drink?

196
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,877
A beer and two glasses.

197
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,516
On the house.

198
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,809
Or do you prefer
something stronger?

199
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,542
No. I don't drink.

200
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:48,451
I am a businessman,
and I have come to Iquitos to...

201
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,294
to invest.

202
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,667
I heard you are closing down...

203
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,960
and I thought I could...

204
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,330
Open a brothel?

205
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,063
Here's some advice.

206
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,368
You seem like a nice man,
and I like you.

207
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,045
This is a rotten business.

208
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,705
If you want money,
open a restaurant.

209
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,382
That's strange.

210
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,316
I was told that because of the heat...

211
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,014
demand was high.

212
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,316
And it is.

213
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,255
But, with the soldiers
that won't pay...

214
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,489
the bribes, and the rent...

215
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,896
I'm losing money.

216
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,669
So I'm closing and keeping
my meager savings...

217
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,671
for my golden years.

218
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,942
I feel sorry for my girls...

219
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,537
I am fond of them.

220
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,840
They're good, hardworking girls.

221
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,945
Maybe we can reach an agreement...

222
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,212
that will benefit us both.

223
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,125
Your knowledge is very valuable
for my plans.

224
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,421
If you do close down...

225
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,223
I'd be interested in hiring you...

226
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,362
and some of your girls.

227
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,466
I'm listening.

228
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,149
Taking hookers to the military posts!

229
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:31,227
It would be great business!

230
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:36,130
But they would never let us in,
Mister Pantoja.

231
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,632
I already have permission.

232
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,999
And don't call them hookers
or whores.

233
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,901
The correct term is "visitors."

234
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,404
You have permission?

235
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,509
Don't tell me you are a soldier.

236
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,476
Of course not.

237
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,321
I want you to think it over.

238
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:03,185
I'll be back in a few days
with a work plan...

239
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,355
I accept now! This is heaven sent.

240
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,199
"Colombiana" wants to speak to you.

241
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,394
Colombiana?

242
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,509
- What does she want?
- Should she wait?

243
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,441
No. I'll see her now.

244
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,375
If she wants a job, there's none.

245
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,378
I'll be right back.

246
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,948
Go ahead.

247
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,146
- Is she really Colombian?
- Nobody knows.

248
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,918
She says she is.

249
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,552
She's been working abroad...

250
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,992
and probably got into trouble.

251
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,394
Very attractive.

252
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:44,796
The best this land has to offer.

253
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,241
But I don't recommend her.
She's rotten goods.

254
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,208
Two men have already
killed themselves over her.

255
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,994
It's about time!
It's past eleven.

256
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,729
I have a splitting headache.

257
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,171
It figures. You know what?

258
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,470
I'm glad you feel sick.

259
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,580
You came tumbling in at sunrise.
Don't you remember?

260
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,750
Lower your voice, please.

261
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,351
I've never felt so bad.

262
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,476
Come pet me.

263
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,758
You're going to tell me
what this is about.

264
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,028
Where were you?

265
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,527
It's this damn job.

266
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,190
You know I hate these things.

267
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,801
You've been with women,
haven't you?

268
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:57,036
I'm sure you have been with women.

269
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,903
Never, Pochita.

270
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:03,613
Don't cry. You make me feel
like a criminal.

271
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,613
You know I don't have eyes
for another.

272
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,082
Then tell me where you were.

273
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:18,252
The undersigned,
Captain Pantaleon Pantoja...

274
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,231
a Visitors' Service for Garrisons...

275
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,359
Border Posts
and Related Quarters...

276
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,064
respectfully informs:

277
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,902
That he has taken possession
of the site located on the Itaya River...

278
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,239
as Command Quarters...

279
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,576
and Logistical Center.

280
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,648
That he has under his command
the two soldiers...

281
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:46,847
named Sinforoso Caiguas
and Palomino Rioalto...

282
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,724
whom the superiority
has adequately chosen...

283
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:54,924
due to their fine conduct records
and their indifference...

284
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,159
toward the opposite sex.

285
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,770
That, during the first week,
the undersigned...

286
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,965
employed most of his time
in cleaning.

287
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,944
That a week might seem
an excessive time...

288
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,777
to carry out this task...

289
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:16,220
but the facility's condition...

290
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,813
can only be described...

291
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,290
as disgusting.

292
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,520
Since the army had abandoned
this facility...

293
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:28,665
it had been used illegally.

294
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,463
The undersigned provided
Caiguas and Rioalto...

295
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:36,563
the necessary equipment...

296
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,776
to burn the debris, clean...

297
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,972
and disinfect the facility.

298
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,348
The walls have been repaired...

299
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,753
the grounds have been cleaned...

300
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:56,088
and the small dock
has been repaired.

301
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,627
The undersigned
is proud to inform that...

302
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,196
using ten...

303
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,358
and twelve-hour shifts...

304
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:08,201
and disregarding his wife,
who has conditioned a house alone...

305
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,103
has turned the dump he received...

306
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:15,111
into an inhabitable, orderly...

307
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,147
and clean place...

308
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,176
as is expected of every army facility...

309
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,947
even if it is clandestine...

310
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,005
What do you think of my new outfit?

311
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,110
Horrible.

312
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,411
I prefer you in uniform.

313
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,852
You're going out again?

314
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,458
I'd rather stay here with you...

315
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,826
and make our little cadet...

316
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,690
We could do it right now.
Don't you want to?

317
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,868
I can't. I'm going to
the movies with Alicia.

318
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,401
I'm starting to get jealous of her.

319
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,870
What do you expect me to do?

320
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,373
It's your job's fault.

321
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,747
It's hard for me too.
We have to be patient.

322
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,386
Leave it. Don't get dressed.

323
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,223
I like you more every day.

324
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,162
I don't know you anymore.

325
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,400
And, with those clothes...

326
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:47,230
it's as if I was cheating on you.

327
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,375
The voice of Sinchi!

328
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:58,210
Good afternoon, dear listeners.

329
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,685
Continuing
with our moralizing campaign...

330
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,880
in defense of our women's
physical and moral integrity...

331
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,923
your servant, The Sinchi...

332
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:13,031
invites you to join our cause...

333
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,200
in demanding
a clear and forceful answer...

334
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,632
from the authorities...

335
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,431
to the abuse carried out...

336
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,304
by depraved members of our army.

337
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,411
Yes, ladies and gentlemen.

338
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:32,381
We demand
punishment for the rapists...

339
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,092
Good afternoon.

340
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,656
You are seven minutes late.

341
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,902
If you were in the service,
you'd be fined.

342
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,364
I'd pay happily to work...

343
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,737
with you in the service.

344
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:03,710
You'd work fourteen-hour days,
and on holidays.

345
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:06,477
And that's not enough.

346
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:09,343
The results of the quarter polls...

347
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,183
are alarming.

348
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,219
Look at that!

349
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,160
Now that's a babe!

350
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,030
You know the Colombiana?

351
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,368
You sure move quickly!

352
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,501
I saw her at Chuchupe's.

353
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:38,076
If she were in the service...

354
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,707
we'd be famous.

355
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,442
Maybe later on.

356
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,282
For now, Chuchupe
and Chupito are recruiting.

357
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,058
Well, here are the poll results.

358
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,357
They're alarming.

359
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:59,636
Potential number of users
of the Visitors' Service: 8,726.

360
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,305
Number of renderings...

361
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,336
"Renderings"?

362
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,715
Monthly service renderings,
desired: 12.

363
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,544
So, if the service
is to satisfy the demand...

364
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,654
it should administer
a monthly average...

365
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,350
of 104,712 renderings.

366
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,690
104,000?

367
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,026
That's a lot of hookers...

368
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,760
I mean... visitors.

369
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,200
Averaging 20 renderings a day...

370
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,532
for each high quality visitor...

371
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,006
working full-time, we would need...

372
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,945
2,271 prostitutes?

373
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,112
That man has gone mad!

374
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,685
He'll turn our whole army
into a brothel!

375
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,356
Calm down. Let me continue.

376
00:24:54,659 --> 00:25:00,564
...2,271 visitors, which is surely
impossible at this time.

377
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,566
I suggest beginning with five...

378
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:07,863
who would administer
4,800 monthly renderings...

379
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:11,507
in six-day weeks, working full-time.

380
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:16,706
He requests permission to recruit
"Chuchupe"...

381
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:20,042
a woman with experience
in the matter...

382
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:23,379
who would act as chief of staff...

383
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,113
and would supervise
the feminine element.

384
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,988
This is an insult to the uniform!

385
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,922
That man should
be put in jail!

386
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:35,496
The undersigned requests authorization
to carry out a trial experiment...

387
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,401
and awaits the go ahead
to enlist...

388
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,606
the first five visitors,
who would be earning...

389
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,900
A salary extracted
from our institution's funds!

390
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,110
General Collazos
will never allow this!

391
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,842
ACCEPTED

392
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,539
You will arrive first...

393
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,243
in order to talk with the users...

394
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,148
and install sites for the renderings.

395
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,617
Sites? Renderings?

396
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,826
You have to get used to the terms.

397
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,621
Users are clients, sites are the beds...

398
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,593
renderings are screwings...

399
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:10,460
and visitors are the girls. Right?

400
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,034
- The candidates?
- Tomorrow morning.

401
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,364
I've called ten top-notch girls...

402
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,167
so you can choose five.

403
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,377
Chuchupe!

404
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,802
Chupito!

405
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,542
I heard you closed down.

406
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:28,315
A great loss for the city's nightlife.

407
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,016
What will you do now?

408
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,955
- A new business?
- Something like that.

409
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:38,525
German Laudano Rosales...

410
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,223
at your service.
I see you aren't a local.

411
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:42,594
The Capital?

412
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,395
Pantaleon Pantoja.

413
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:49,371
Welcome to this land of
friendship and beauty.

414
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,341
Have you been here long?

415
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:56,513
He has a popular radio show,
"The Voice of Sinchi."

416
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,039
My wife listens to it.

417
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,979
I hope she likes it.

418
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,584
What brings you here?

419
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:04,188
Are you "hunting"?

420
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,924
I'm happily married.

421
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,787
No, on business.

422
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,621
Well...

423
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:16,063
good luck in your...

424
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,566
"business."

425
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,033
It's been a pleasure.
See you around.

426
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:26,905
He asks too many questions.

427
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,876
He's a professional busybody.
Don't mind him.

428
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,548
In order to gather information...

429
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:38,381
the undersigned
investigated products...

430
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:41,720
with alleged aphrodisiac properties...

431
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,391
to personally verify...

432
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:51,332
over a four-day period,
in what way...

433
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,131
these products
could enhance the problem...

434
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,067
of the troops.

435
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,138
Some of these products...

436
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,077
brought on an increase...

437
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:07,241
of sexual behavior,
to the point where...

438
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:11,082
only self-fondling
and the virile act occupied him...

439
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,417
affecting concentration...

440
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,626
his nervous system...

441
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,354
and his working efficiency.

442
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,124
He requested intercourse with his wife...

443
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,426
an average of three times a day...

444
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,503
which logically made her uneasy...

445
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:29,070
as she was not accustomed to this.

446
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:32,037
Because of this, I recommend...

447
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:36,113
to my superiors that the intake
of these products...

448
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:40,283
be prohibited
at jungle posts and quarters.

449
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:44,779
I inform I have enlisted
the first visitors.

450
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,556
A difficult task since...

451
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,025
I was still under the influence...

452
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,130
of long acting aphrodisiacs.

453
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,703
Thank you. Call the next one.

454
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,043
What do you think?

455
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,213
It's harder than I thought.

456
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,045
You must like one over the rest.

457
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:20,754
- May I?
- Come in, girl.

458
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,999
Here I am, Mister Panta.

459
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,202
Good morning.

460
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,530
Name, please.

461
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:34,569
Pechuga.

462
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,371
Luisa Canepa,
not taken or involved.

463
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,772
OK, Miss.

464
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,382
Show me.

465
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:02,198
Accepted!

466
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,761
They're coming, Captain!

467
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:12,606
The undersigned,
Captain Pantaleon Pantoja...

468
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,177
respectfully informs:

469
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,074
That the expected vessel...

470
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:22,186
arrived at our logistic center
of the Itaya River.

471
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,584
It was piloted by petty officer
Carlos Rodriguez...

472
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,727
who was quickly told
of the mission's secrecy.

473
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:38,127
There are only six days until
we carry out the trial mission...

474
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,632
at the post of Horcones.

475
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:43,600
Mrs. Chuchupe, please.

476
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,700
Rules are rules.

477
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,439
I need not tell you...

478
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,807
that here lies
the future of the service.

479
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:55,880
The girls are ready, sir.

480
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,747
Bring them in, please.

481
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,421
Caiguas and Rioalto
have designed uniforms.

482
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,127
What do you think, sir?

483
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,726
With a zipper for quick removal.

484
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,833
What do you think?

485
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:13,402
Lalita's clothes could be tighter...

486
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,731
to show her titties.

487
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:19,501
It's as tight as can be.
Lalita is slim.

488
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,177
Not an ounce of fat.

489
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:25,143
You must fatten up.
The troops like meaty girls.

490
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,977
Double rations, starting today.

491
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,450
The uniforms. Do you like them?

492
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,456
Why is everything red and green?

493
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,421
The screwing, sorry...

494
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:39,528
the rendering cards too.

495
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,963
They're the service's colors:

496
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:43,760
Green...

497
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,497
for the beauty of the region.

498
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,400
Red for the ardent army men...

499
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,905
we help soothe.

500
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:55,069
I suggest we paint our nails green.

501
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,646
It's lovely!

502
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:00,239
Is the lingerie red and green too?

503
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,682
Want to see?

504
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,649
There's no need.

505
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,224
Well done.

506
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,347
Dismissed.

507
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,663
Mr. Rodriguez!

508
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,866
I won't tolerate that.

509
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,032
Control your urges...

510
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:30,509
or I will remove you
from the service.

511
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,608
- Is that clear?
- Crystal clear, sir.

512
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,697
Don't worry. I know Chuchupe.

513
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:51,925
I assure you everything is ready
for our arrival.

514
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,669
It'll be fine.

515
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,998
This is the hour of truth.

516
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,109
All right, ladies.

517
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,046
We're almost there.

518
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,716
We're ready
for "body to body combat."

519
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,657
- How do I look?
- You are all fine.

520
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,431
In Horcones...

521
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,934
some twenty brave soldiers
await you.

522
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,300
They endure many sacrifices
for our country.

523
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,968
Some of them
haven't seen a woman for months.

524
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,080
This is only a trial mission...

525
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:41,550
but if it's carried out
with patriotism and resolve...

526
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:45,415
the service will cover
the whole Amazon region...

527
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:48,716
bringing happiness to our soldiers.

528
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,462
Let's hear it...

529
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,295
for the Visitors' Service...

530
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,931
and for our glorious armed forces.

531
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,674
There it is! Get ready!

532
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:11,043
Show those men what you can do!

533
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,342
Let's do it!

534
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,710
Until they beg for mercy!

535
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:36,697
Silence!

536
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,279
Come, Sandra, hurry up.

537
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,118
Iris... Iris, hurry.

538
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,154
Five minutes before 1600...

539
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,561
the visitors occupied their sites.

540
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,893
Lalita and Pechuga at the depot...

541
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:09,573
others at the infirmary
and the mess hall.

542
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,136
Stay back!

543
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,376
I need not remind you...

544
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,242
that these ladies must know...

545
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:23,818
that our country's soldiers
know how to behave as men.

546
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,654
They're all yours, sir.

547
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,319
The instructions are:

548
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,053
First...

549
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:36,332
each user can stay up to
twenty minutes in a site.

550
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,297
This is the maximum time allowed.

551
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,967
Second...

552
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:45,173
the user is entitled to
one normal rendering...

553
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:50,003
so you will leave the site
as soon as it's over.

554
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:55,352
It is forbidden, and punishable
by definitive exclusion...

555
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,085
to request of the visitor such
aberrations as:

556
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,815
Manual or oral masturbation,
sodomy...

557
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,325
the "black kiss"...

558
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,532
and other extravagances.

559
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,836
Finally,
those awaiting their turn...

560
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:16,770
will do so in complete silence
and order...

561
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,874
and not disturb the fellow in action.

562
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,378
- Understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!

563
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,479
Give the order.

564
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:28,210
First line, forward!

565
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:37,321
4 minutes, 46.

566
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:38,995
Next.

567
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,468
6 minutes, 11.

568
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:50,037
Nobody has reached
the maximum time yet.

569
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,471
These variations
are only a symptom.

570
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,078
This post is isolated, so the users...

571
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,010
have contained virility.

572
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,979
Some for months.

573
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,710
That's why they're so quick.

574
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:10,652
A record! 2 minutes, 22.
How about that?

575
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,258
We'll have to include abstinence...

576
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,092
in our future estimates. Yes.

577
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,493
A resounding success!

578
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:25,175
And everything went along
with order and on time.

579
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:29,109
Pantoja was able to save
18% of the budget...

580
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,406
allotted for the trial.

581
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:34,345
Post commander, Lieutenant Santana...

582
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,112
congratulates the Visitors' Service...

583
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:41,723
and requests its regular functioning.

584
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,525
Enough, Lopez. It's very clear.

585
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,590
Write:

586
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,889
To General Roger Scavino.
We inform you...

587
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,527
that the Visitors' Service
for Garrisons, Border Posts...

588
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:59,371
and Related Quarters,
is now functioning.

589
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:04,045
Ten thousand a week?

590
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:07,241
But this is a delirious
exaggeration, Pantoja!

591
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,113
No, sir. It's a proven statistic.

592
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,722
Look at these charts.
It's a careful...

593
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,457
if not conservative, estimate.

594
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,587
10,000 renderings...

595
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:23,632
cover primary
psychobiological needs.

596
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,064
To fulfill virile plenitude...

597
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,240
53,200 renderings are needed.

598
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,775
Who the hell has told you...

599
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:37,879
that virile plenitude can only
be reached by fornicating?

600
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,745
The specialists...

601
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,147
Father.

602
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,978
Call me Commander!

603
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,351
Excuse me, Commander.

604
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,451
I brought some documents.

605
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:54,154
They're excerpts from the works of
Sigmund Freud, Austrian.

606
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,922
Of William Steckel...

607
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:59,725
whose nationality was not stated...

608
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,395
of the Reader's Digest...

609
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,941
and of Carlos Seguin, our compatriot.

610
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,235
If you...

611
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:11,678
prefer books, I have them
at the Logistic Center.

612
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,677
I have been informed...

613
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:17,046
you give out pornography
at the camps.

614
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:21,122
At Borja garrison,
your midget assistant...

615
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,022
gave out this filth:
"Two Nights of Pleasure"...

616
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:28,928
"Maria the Tarantula,"
"Julia and the Horse"...

617
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:32,035
"I'm Going in There,"
"Super Ass."

618
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,031
True.

619
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,298
My assistant suggested it.

620
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,670
The result was a faster erection.

621
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,310
Now it's regular practice.

622
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,882
So it wasn't just once!

623
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,780
The service is giving out
pornography!

624
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,583
We lend it,
we can't afford to give it.

625
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,054
The result is positive.

626
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,890
A soldier that reads in line...

627
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,032
finishes three minutes earlier.

628
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,692
This allows us to reach...

629
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,962
500 weekly renderings
with five visitors.

630
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:12,473
Now I've heard everything!

631
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,703
I wish to leave, General.

632
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,879
I understand, Father.

633
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:40,130
Well-assorted for
you to pick, sir.

634
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,896
I only wanted ten!
I can't examine all day.

635
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,033
The word spread, and women...

636
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:51,046
sprang out of every
neighborhood.

637
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:52,474
It's not my fault.

638
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,048
Let's pick the five we need.

639
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:09,455
Send them in, one by one,
with their cards.

640
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,964
The Colombiana first.

641
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,471
OK, hurry up!

642
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:20,802
Let's make a line.

643
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,570
Have you filled in your cards?

644
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,699
Good morning.

645
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,899
The famous "Pantyland"!

646
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,506
I couldn't picture it.

647
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:56,969
- The famous what?
- Pantyland.

648
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,915
That's what they call this place.

649
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,679
You will please refer to it...

650
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:07,015
as Logistic Center, not Pantyland.

651
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,818
Do you know why you are here?

652
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,822
Chupito told me a little.
He said...

653
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,925
you would tell me about salary...

654
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,762
and obligations.

655
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:23,533
Right. There'll be three
convoys a week...

656
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,073
and ten renderings per convoy.

657
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:28,970
Convoys are the trips?

658
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,444
Correct.

659
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:35,176
So renderings must be...

660
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:49,489
The salary is 50% of what is
discounted from soldiers...

661
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,361
the other 50% is for upkeep.

662
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:53,902
It's explained here.

663
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:58,301
Now...

664
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:02,344
if you don't mind,
though it may not be necessary...

665
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,479
I must follow the rules.

666
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:06,874
This way.

667
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:19,193
Here?

668
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,427
Yes.

669
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,265
Please undress.

670
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,035
I've got my period.

671
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,072
But, if you don't mind...

672
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,407
What's wrong?

673
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,915
It's only an exam of presence.

674
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:44,846
That's a steamy imagination, Miss.

675
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,686
It did seem strange,
there isn't even a rug.

676
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,192
So...

677
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,631
do you think I'm OK?

678
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:04,198
I'm skinny,
but I promise to fatten up.

679
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:05,971
You're fine.

680
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,901
So you like me?

681
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,776
You passed. Get dressed.

682
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:14,775
Thank you.

683
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,619
When do I start?

684
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,153
Tomorrow.

685
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:24,821
Report to the dress department
for a uniform.

686
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,424
Dress department?

687
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,122
On the lower level.

688
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:33,761
Could you help me with
the zipper?

689
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,497
It's stuck.

690
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,956
There you go.

691
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,958
What? Let go!

692
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,218
What's wrong?

693
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:01,124
I must warn you about two things.

694
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,629
First:
You will call me "sir"...

695
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,131
as the other visitors do.

696
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,771
Second:
Don't ever do that again.

697
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,839
Well, you had a bulgy fly.

698
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,744
I didn't mean to offend you.

699
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:23,851
So forgive me.

700
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,282
Do you?

701
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,390
Don't let it happen again.

702
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:36,528
Now, please leave. I'm busy.

703
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,397
Whatever you say, sir.

704
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:58,548
See you tomorrow.

705
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,270
Look over there.

706
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,797
We're men too!

707
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,299
You keep everything!

708
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,872
We're men too!

709
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:58,607
They're locals.
They probably found out we'd pass by.

710
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,612
I don't like this.

711
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:05,584
If the service goes public,
it would be our end.

712
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,223
Nobody will know.

713
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,963
Sinchi's voice.

714
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:21,636
Program produced and directed
by yours truly...

715
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,135
German Laudano Rosales,
The Sinchi.

716
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:31,313
Good afternoon, dear listeners.

717
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:37,148
I beg you to take your young children
away from your radio...

718
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:40,515
since my known frankness...

719
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:44,887
leaves me no choice
but to refer to the crudest facts...

720
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:48,120
and terms:

721
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:54,666
Prostitution, my dear listeners!

722
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:59,003
A new system of flesh commerce...

723
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:03,009
through our sacred jungle rivers.

724
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,707
A mobile, motorized brothel...

725
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,681
called Pantyland is known to be...

726
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:13,722
clandestinely sending...

727
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:17,984
its sinful services
to our army's quarters.

728
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:21,325
So it has been informed...

729
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,432
to the office of Amazon Radio...

730
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,535
through letters and phone calls.

731
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:31,171
I'm listening, Father.
We'll talk later.

732
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:35,138
These shameless odalisques
have been seen...

733
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:39,579
navigating down
the region's main rivers...

734
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:45,480
towards the military quarters
and posts of the jungle.

735
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:47,385
So, I ask:

736
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,558
Who is behind...

737
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:54,526
this industry of sin,
flourishing before the very eyes...

738
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,826
of the authorities?

739
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:01,461
Nothing will stop our crusade
for progress...

740
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:03,738
morality, culture...

741
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:07,071
and patriotism
of the Peruvian jungle.

742
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:09,711
The time has come...

743
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:11,541
to unmask the monster and...

744
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,412
as the apostle did
unto the dragon...

745
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,952
behead it with a single stroke!

746
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,758
How was I?

747
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:28,422
Telluric, Maestro. Telluric!

748
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,376
Good morning.

749
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:50,013
Here so early?
The summon was for 9:00 a.m.

750
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,684
Excuse me, Mister Panta...

751
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,115
I needed to talk to you...

752
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:56,850
alone.

753
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,493
What about?

754
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,364
Please, don't smoke in this office.

755
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:13,734
Tell me.

756
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:15,936
Is there a problem?

757
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,115
It's you, Mister Panta.

758
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:21,075
Me?

759
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:25,420
I feel you have something
against me.

760
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:26,920
What?

761
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,216
You don't talk to me or look at me.

762
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,153
As if I offended you.

763
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,826
You're mistaken, Miss.

764
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,295
I treat you as the other visitors.

765
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,098
I'll be blunt.

766
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:55,180
I think you want me
to fall for you.

767
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,647
What?

768
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,981
I am married, Miss.

769
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:03,183
Like most of the men
I go to bed with.

770
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,594
It's no reason for...

771
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:09,424
It's a reason for me.
It should be for you.

772
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,298
You see?

773
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,329
I speak and you get skittish.

774
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,000
But, you know what?

775
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,677
I like that.

776
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:27,481
I'm like a crab.

777
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:31,643
I go against the flow.
So keep at it...

778
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,380
and I'll fall for you.

779
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,857
I don't advise it.

780
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:44,828
"Mixing work with pleasure is a sign
of ill proceedings."

781
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:51,302
That's kind of hard
in our line of business.

782
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,172
You know what I mean.

783
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:58,404
Don't you feel anything
when you see us naked?

784
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,512
That would be horrible.

785
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:05,710
Being clean-cut does not
mean being a fool.

786
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,052
I love it when you get angry...

787
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,719
you're so cute.

788
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,067
Here, dry off.

789
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:21,895
Thank you.

790
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,867
I don't think you are a fool.

791
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,547
But you like me
and won't accept it.

792
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:47,258
You are a very attractive woman.

793
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,900
I'm not indifferent to your charms...

794
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:53,896
but it's impossible.

795
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:57,369
Not even once?

796
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:00,734
Out of curiosity?

797
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,646
- You could order me...
- No I can't.

798
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,349
It would be an abuse of authority.

799
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,443
It's perfectly OK.

800
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:15,817
You should try your goods.

801
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,859
It would be like...

802
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:22,328
a quality test.

803
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:27,761
Please...

804
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:30,233
leave.

805
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:33,808
We won't discuss this again.

806
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,490
They've told you bad things
about me...

807
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:51,251
and you're scared.

808
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,255
But I'm not like you think.

809
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,976
I'd love to spend more time with you!

810
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:15,173
To send for our little cadet!
All day, every day!

811
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,010
Don't you like it?

812
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,812
Panta, please!

813
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:21,649
Forgive me.
I love your neck!

814
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,825
I know what's in store for me.

815
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:29,830
What is it?

816
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:38,301
Don't tell me you're
a Peeping Tom now. Pervert!

817
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,133
Keep walking.

818
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,971
How can they do that in public?

819
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:49,143
Come in.

820
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,855
You sent for me?

821
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,216
Take a seat, Miss.

822
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:12,200
I sent for you to refresh
your memory about regulations.

823
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:16,107
Here is a copy.
Clarify your doubts...

824
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,604
and feel free to ask.

825
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:22,718
Are you angry?

826
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:26,754
You dare to ask me that,
after the show...

827
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,687
you put on in public?

828
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:31,922
Now I get it.

829
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:36,288
This is about yesterday.

830
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,234
Are you jealous?

831
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,837
A visitor is not a whore...

832
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:44,804
but yesterday,
you behaved like a whore.

833
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:48,308
Regulations don't prohibit friends.

834
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:51,073
That's quite an obscene friend.

835
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:54,545
You are to stop seeing that man.

836
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,115
Thank you.

837
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:58,386
He's not just a man.

838
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,748
His name is Nicolas.

839
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:04,285
And he wants to marry me.

840
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,434
If that is what you wish...

841
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,643
But please, think it over.

842
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,947
I remind you that, if you marry...

843
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,981
you'll have to leave the service.

844
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,808
We don't admit married women.

845
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:36,815
He wants to get married.

846
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:41,356
I just want a little
care and protection.

847
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,469
Don't I have that right?

848
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,434
I guess so...

849
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,200
Forgive me.

850
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:53,874
I have been unjust.

851
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:57,112
Don't worry...
I'm used to it.

852
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,405
Olga...

853
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:05,512
You are a strange person.
I don't understand you.

854
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,717
You should do something else.

855
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,485
You too.

856
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,220
This job doesn't become you.

857
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:19,762
You don't even try your own visitors.

858
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,537
Excuse me.

859
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,011
Miss... Wait.

860
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:31,969
Yes?

861
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,214
Are you...

862
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,909
still willing to volunteer...

863
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:39,121
to carry out a quality test?

864
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:43,048
Yes. Of course.

865
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:49,230
I must inform you that this test...

866
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,356
will only be done once...

867
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:55,093
will be secret,
and is strictly work-related.

868
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:59,505
Make no mistake, Olga...

869
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:03,244
the only motive that moves me
to perform this test...

870
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:06,880
is to verify
and perfect the service...

871
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:29,701
- One, Pechuga.
- Two, Sandra.

872
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:32,032
- Three, Iris.
- Four, Lalita.

873
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,072
- Five, Vanessa.
- Six, Colombiana.

874
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,210
- Seven, Coca.
- Eight, Salome.

875
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:38,641
- Nine, Pichuza.
- Ten, Peludita.

876
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,713
In flesh and blood.

877
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,645
Work plan?

878
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:46,982
Three convoys: Two of 48 hours,
and one returns tonight.

879
00:58:47,223 --> 00:58:49,157
I already drew lots.

880
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:50,486
Lalita...

881
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:51,924
Vanessa...

882
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:53,153
and Colombiana.

883
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,921
We go to Bolognesi garrison.

884
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,466
It returns on Thursday at noon.

885
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:03,736
Start boarding.
I want you to work well...

886
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:07,374
and remember:
Work...

887
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:09,740
...ennobles and dignifies!

888
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:12,504
- Let's get to work.
- Excuse me.

889
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,853
Is there a problem?

890
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,593
No, nothing.

891
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:35,762
I just have something in my shoe.

892
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:37,834
Thank you.

893
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:41,571
You are not coming?

894
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,446
No. I have work here.

895
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,240
Too bad.

896
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:50,784
I thought we could repeat the test.

897
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,446
Don't you want to sleep with me?

898
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,448
The test allowed me...

899
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:59,719
to gather important information.

900
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:05,698
I thank you, but I don't consider it
necessary to repeat it.

901
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:07,632
Any trouble?

902
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:10,039
We're five minutes late.

903
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,038
No, Chuchupe.

904
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:17,212
This must not happen.
This situation may affect...

905
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:21,975
the personnel's performance
and concentration.

906
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:25,247
Then we could go to a hotel...

907
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:27,251
so we aren't seen.

908
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:41,400
Pocha, I've told you not to call
me at work, unless...

909
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,739
What?
I'll be right there!

910
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:49,003
Here are the last results.

911
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,011
You're sure, doctor?

912
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:56,980
Yes.

913
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,884
Your wife is pregnant.

914
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:07,125
I wanted to be sure
before I told you.

915
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:10,193
At last, Pantita. At last!

916
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:15,633
I'll be a father!

917
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,084
A penny for your thoughts.

918
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:41,219
What are you doing here?

919
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:45,964
They left without me.

920
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,604
And your machine?

921
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,978
I thought you never stopped working.

922
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:59,809
The Dalila returns at seven.

923
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,982
So you are working.

924
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,511
A cigarette?

925
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:08,981
No thank you.

926
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:22,427
Since the test,
we've never been alone.

927
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,838
Are you nervous?

928
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,476
What is it you want, Olga?

929
01:02:32,448 --> 01:02:35,212
Nothing in particular.

930
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:37,615
- I thought you and I...
- "You and I"?

931
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:41,850
There is no "you and I."
That was very clear.

932
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:43,117
For work...

933
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,556
- Can't you think of anything else?
- No!

934
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,325
Even less when I speak to you.

935
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,845
Excuse me, I have to go.

936
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,012
Stay.

937
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:07,714
I'll leave.

938
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:11,379
You know?

939
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:15,480
You may be an excellent boss
and lover...

940
01:03:15,925 --> 01:03:17,517
but as a person,
you're insufferable.

941
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:18,888
I'm not your lover...

942
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:21,358
Miss.

943
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:24,795
But you want to be.

944
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,943
Today, we have stopped
along the way...

945
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:41,211
to celebrate
the 20,000th rendering...

946
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,247
carried out by Pechuga.

947
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:56,959
20,000 renderings given
to the soldiers and petty officers...

948
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,532
of our border units...

949
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,869
that signify a success.

950
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:06,431
They prove that the service...

951
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,975
has employed its capacity
to the fullest...

952
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:14,274
as can be deduced from
the 20,000 renderings...

953
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,816
and its components.

954
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,312
Our objective, for the year...

955
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:24,255
is to reach 200,000 renderings.

956
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,561
It's an ambitious
but possible figure...

957
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:33,258
if personnel maintain
their high performance...

958
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,029
as they have to date...

959
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:38,106
and with the coming reinforcements.

960
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:41,176
Here's to the 20,000!

961
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:56,116
Look! It's beautiful!

962
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,697
Cut the cake, Mister Panta!

963
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,404
Do you care to dance?

964
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:06,190
Are you OK, Mister Panta?

965
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:09,364
I'm not used to these celebrations.

966
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:12,931
I've had too much to drink.
I'm woozy.

967
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:17,304
Take it easy. Close your eyes.
There you go.

968
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,259
Partner switch!

969
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,278
Why didn't you dance with me, Olga?

970
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,248
Why didn't you ask me to?

971
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,882
You've treated me
as if I was invisible.

972
01:07:11,927 --> 01:07:14,953
It's complicated, Olga.

973
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:17,995
I don't understand.

974
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,933
A man either likes a woman
or he doesn't.

975
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,599
And you don't seem to like me.

976
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,766
I like you.

977
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:30,735
I like you a lot.

978
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:35,348
I haven't stopped thinking
about you since...

979
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:37,847
You know...

980
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:41,953
Since we slept together?

981
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:46,520
Olga...

982
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:49,862
If only I could...

983
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:53,792
You can!

984
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:56,700
You just have to want it!

985
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:09,782
I like you.
I like you so much.

986
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,889
The famous Colombiana!

987
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:19,790
Excuse me?

988
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:22,395
Look how many are in her line.

989
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:39,874
Don't you like this saddle anymore?

990
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:41,573
I like you, but...

991
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:44,515
I'll ride another filly, this time.

992
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,019
Get back in line, soldier!

993
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:50,515
My record allows me to choose...

994
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,826
so I'm trying the Colombiana.

995
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:56,657
Return to your line.

996
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:59,094
Miss Colombiana already
has too many users.

997
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,367
Each visitor can give...

998
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,563
up to twenty renderings.

999
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:06,038
And, with me, there are...

1000
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,472
Nineteen.

1001
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,242
Nineteen users, sir.

1002
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:18,513
Soldier?

1003
01:09:18,754 --> 01:09:21,882
User number twenty, sir.

1004
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,855
Gentlemen.

1005
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:28,658
Can't you see
the lady is overloaded?

1006
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:34,734
By your turn, she'll be too exhausted
to perform well.

1007
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:37,031
I suggest you return to your lines.

1008
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,171
No.

1009
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,434
I don't tire easily.

1010
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:42,901
On the contrary...

1011
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:46,037
I get more aroused
with each soldier.

1012
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:50,751
The last ones will be
just as well tended as the first.

1013
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:53,946
Try it. Fall in at the end.

1014
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:04,960
Regulations demand ten renderings.

1015
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,261
That's it.

1016
01:10:07,403 --> 01:10:08,927
Just ten.

1017
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:18,263
Forgive me, Olga.

1018
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:23,609
I don't know
what is happening to me.

1019
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:29,951
It's your flirting...

1020
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,786
I can't stand it.

1021
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:35,286
The soldiers look at you...

1022
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,788
as if you were a...

1023
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,684
A visitor.

1024
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,354
That's what I am, right?

1025
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:16,558
It's abusive that the visitors
are only for soldiers.

1026
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:20,466
We ask that civilians
in the army reserves...

1027
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:24,969
be able to use this service,
just as the soldiers.

1028
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,404
This service exists only in your minds.

1029
01:12:29,211 --> 01:12:32,578
How can you request such nonsense?

1030
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:35,479
We've seen the boats, sir.

1031
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:38,186
Boats filled with women.

1032
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:39,910
We have needs too.

1033
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:42,387
Not just the soldiers.

1034
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:46,354
I have no information about this.

1035
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:50,187
You've been drinking
too much chuchuhuasi.

1036
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:51,330
But, General...

1037
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:53,492
Do I look like a pimp?

1038
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,503
No, General.

1039
01:12:56,638 --> 01:13:00,096
If the press finds out about this...

1040
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:04,375
you wouldn't last long in office,
mayor.

1041
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:08,516
Now, get the hell out
of my sight!

1042
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:12,147
Out!

1043
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:21,726
What's wrong?

1044
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:27,560
Remorse, again?

1045
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:31,101
I hate doing this to my wife.

1046
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:34,475
I know...

1047
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:40,977
You never cheated. You made love
every other Saturday, at 10:00 p.m.

1048
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:45,716
I know it by heart, Panta.

1049
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:01,729
Come here.

1050
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:18,642
Relax. Nobody's watching.

1051
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:22,089
You can't be too careful.

1052
01:14:23,659 --> 01:14:26,457
Are you ashamed of me?

1053
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:30,456
That would be crazy.

1054
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:36,593
There's a party on Friday.

1055
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:41,435
I'm on leave that day
and I want to go.

1056
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,510
You can go with Sandra.

1057
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:46,813
I want to go with you.

1058
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:50,379
With me?
You know that's impossible.

1059
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:52,519
We can't be seen together.

1060
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:39,691
These little girls are something.

1061
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:44,033
You said it: Little girls.
Dumb babies...

1062
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:47,938
not one of them worth anything.

1063
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:52,672
Show me a woman
that'll take your breath away...

1064
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:55,713
one that'll give you goose bumps.

1065
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:56,883
There!

1066
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:00,917
There is a woman.

1067
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,863
Got you, Pantaleon Pantoja!

1068
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,899
You jerk!

1069
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,402
Come on, you've got work.

1070
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,416
What are you doing?

1071
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,919
Just working, Mister Pantoja.

1072
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:40,158
We have enough.
Right, Mario?

1073
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:03,043
Mr. Sinchi is here.

1074
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:05,278
He has a present for you.

1075
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:14,191
What is it you want?

1076
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:16,795
I can make sure they disappear.

1077
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:20,331
Surely, you don't want your wife
to see them.

1078
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:23,163
That's what friends are for.

1079
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:26,841
You know we are not friends,
Mr. Laudano.

1080
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:32,311
Wrong! If I wasn't your friend,
you would be out of business.

1081
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:37,317
And I am not talking
about the pictures I have.

1082
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:40,320
I'm talking of something bigger.

1083
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:42,218
Pantyland!

1084
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:47,393
Don't get angry, Mr. Pantoja...

1085
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:53,261
I speak of the thriving business
you run before everyone's eyes.

1086
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:55,561
Rubbish.

1087
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,739
After careful investigations...

1088
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:02,674
I now have enough evidence
to sink you...

1089
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,377
into disgrace and ruin.

1090
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:09,273
If I were to speak on my show...

1091
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:12,546
- Why don't you?
- Because I am for progress.

1092
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:16,289
I am ahead of my time.

1093
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:20,259
But the whole city pressures me...

1094
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:23,855
and I think my silence
deserves a reward.

1095
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:27,798
Blackmail then?

1096
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:33,532
I'll help you, man!
For a few dollars...

1097
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:37,973
I'll defend the Visitors' Service
and its mastermind.

1098
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:41,742
Don't answer right away.
Sleep on it...

1099
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:45,885
consult with your wife, your lover...
Don't get nervous!

1100
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:47,418
Caiguas, Rioalto!

1101
01:18:47,856 --> 01:18:50,620
What? Stop them!
Let go, damn it!

1102
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:54,625
Throw him in the river!
Nobody blackmails me!

1103
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:58,731
Don't commit suicide!
I'm superman in Iquitos!

1104
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:00,457
I can't swim!

1105
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:16,250
You'll be sorry about this!

1106
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:19,715
There is nothing in Iquitos...

1107
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:22,423
that The Sinchi's voice
can't knock down.

1108
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:25,990
You asked for it!
This is war! War!

1109
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:53,248
As the clock that adorns
our studio wall strikes 1600 hours...

1110
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:58,118
Amazon Radio is pleased
to bring its listeners...

1111
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:02,356
the most listened to
program on the dial.

1112
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:06,232
The voice of Sinchi!

1113
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:10,303
I promised to unmask that lawless...

1114
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:12,369
unscrupulous individual...

1115
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:16,202
who, unpunished,
runs that depraved den...

1116
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:20,405
known as Visitors' Service...

1117
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:26,112
better known as "Pantyland."

1118
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:33,290
The Sinchi fulfills his promises,
my dear listeners.

1119
01:20:33,428 --> 01:20:35,658
Pantaleon Pantoja...

1120
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:39,324
is the name of this dark character!

1121
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:43,460
Pantaleon Pantoja, who has come...

1122
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:46,403
from the depths of hell, supported...

1123
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:49,769
by powerful and invisible interests...

1124
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:54,075
to fill his name with shame,
ladies and gentlemen!

1125
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:05,651
Yes, General.

1126
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:10,493
I've heard nothing.

1127
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:12,731
What?

1128
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:20,740
Pocha!

1129
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:29,079
...because, as a matter of fact,
Pantaleon Pantoja has a wife...

1130
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:32,878
and has been leading a double life.

1131
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:36,784
On one hand,
neck deep in the swamp...

1132
01:21:37,025 --> 01:21:39,220
of his affair with Olga Arellano...

1133
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,828
the Colombiana...

1134
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:45,760
remembered as the beautiful
whore from the north...

1135
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:49,232
while appearing to lead...

1136
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:53,700
a respectable life.
Hiding under the ignorance...

1137
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:57,503
in which he kept his own wife...

1138
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:02,214
to whom we extend...

1139
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:06,810
all our moral support,
and we remind her...

1140
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:10,254
that life is better under
the light of truth...

1141
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:12,491
than under...

1142
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:14,219
ignorance.

1143
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:20,428
What does the army
have to do with Pantyland?

1144
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:25,171
Does Pantoja have
the authorities' consent...

1145
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:28,934
to enter quarters with prostitutes?

1146
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:32,403
General Scavino, Father Beltran...

1147
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:34,512
the mayor, the prefect.

1148
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:38,048
Are they aware of these dealings...

1149
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:41,053
and are looking away?

1150
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:47,617
We will continue to investigate,
no matter who may fall!

1151
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:52,426
With the courage
that has been our trademark.

1152
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:57,066
You have heard: The Voice...

1153
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:59,366
of Sinchi!

1154
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:04,907
Devastating, Maestro!
Devastating!

1155
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:18,859
Let me explain!

1156
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:23,393
There's nothing to explain.
Get out of the way.

1157
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:25,522
- You can't go!
- Let go!

1158
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:27,792
Think of our little cadet!

1159
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:30,368
You can forget about him and me.

1160
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:32,698
You liar!
You hypocrite!

1161
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:34,704
It's this job's fault!

1162
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:37,410
You know me!

1163
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:40,011
When I had to feed a regiment...

1164
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:43,376
I gained weight!
I learned how to cook!

1165
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:46,883
When I was in charge of uniforms...

1166
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:51,251
I designed combat fatigues myself!
Remember?

1167
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,688
They thought I was a fag!

1168
01:23:55,497 --> 01:24:00,025
Work absorbs me.
It transforms me. I can't control it.

1169
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:04,534
Then stay with your whores,
your Colombiana...

1170
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:06,206
and all that filth!

1171
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:10,103
Don't touch me!
You're disgusting!

1172
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:15,414
Let go of me!

1173
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:24,325
I have offended an officer.

1174
01:24:24,492 --> 01:24:30,124
I know this is grave, but...

1175
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:32,230
Three Our Fathers.

1176
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:38,604
- Shame on you!
- Excellence!

1177
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,736
What do you know?

1178
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:41,967
Nothing, but...

1179
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,543
Don't lie!

1180
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:45,211
No, your Excellence.

1181
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,611
You are a soldier of God!

1182
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,248
Yes, Excellence.

1183
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:51,611
You must fight Satan!

1184
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:05,127
Please listen to me.

1185
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:06,890
What can you say?

1186
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:10,403
I've presented my resignation.

1187
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:13,672
I've asked to be relieved of duty.

1188
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:15,139
What did he say?

1189
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:18,436
Nothing, yet.
I hope they relieve...

1190
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,444
Secret mission!
Intelligence!

1191
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:23,810
You are a liar!

1192
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:28,352
Don't call, until you are
out of that filthy world!

1193
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:30,182
Idiot!

1194
01:25:46,608 --> 01:25:48,200
Why are you here?

1195
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:55,780
I wanted to see you.

1196
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:00,246
How are you?

1197
01:26:04,559 --> 01:26:05,491
Not well.

1198
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:23,134
What will happen now?

1199
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:36,656
Good morning.
It's General Collazos.

1200
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,315
General, sir.

1201
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:40,450
I read your request.

1202
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:41,892
Yes, General.

1203
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:44,860
I'm surprised at you.

1204
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:50,665
You were selected for your managing
and military qualifications.

1205
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:53,669
Remember our glorious predecessors...

1206
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:56,843
Bolognesi, Ugarte, Caceres.

1207
01:26:56,978 --> 01:27:02,507
Did they surrender
when they faced adversity?

1208
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:07,678
No, sir. The true army man,
musters up his strength...

1209
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:10,283
in the face of adversity.

1210
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:14,020
You are a soldier.
You must not surrender.

1211
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:19,165
You are to keep the service running.
Do I make myself clear?

1212
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:20,696
Good morning.

1213
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:23,236
As you command, General.

1214
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:29,234
He even approved the ten
new visitors I had requested.

1215
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:31,976
You see?

1216
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:33,808
You should be happy.

1217
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:37,008
There'll be no stopping you.

1218
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:43,882
Forty visitors.
Not bad at all, Captain.

1219
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,958
I have many enemies.

1220
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:49,491
My wife won't talk to me.

1221
01:27:49,631 --> 01:27:52,122
She'll come around, Captain.

1222
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:55,666
And don't worry about Father Beltran.

1223
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:57,794
They've screwed him.

1224
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:03,568
From head chaplain, he has gone
to parishioner at Iquitos cemetery.

1225
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:09,608
With your tenacity,
you'll be rid of your enemies...

1226
01:28:10,518 --> 01:28:13,954
I'm only worried
about that damned Sinchi...

1227
01:28:15,223 --> 01:28:17,191
If I were you, Captain...

1228
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:20,086
I've been ordered
to silence him.

1229
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:23,789
Great! My assistants
will silence him.

1230
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:26,262
They know where to hit.

1231
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:30,030
Not like that. It's worse.

1232
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:58,965
How's it going, dear Pantaleon?

1233
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:04,135
One moment.

1234
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:21,051
Wonderful view.
Congratulations.

1235
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:23,489
What?

1236
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:27,552
You wanted to speak to me,
Mister Pantoja?

1237
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:30,056
A wise decision.

1238
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:34,200
People like us should not harm
each other.

1239
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:37,896
It's a waste of time.

1240
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,470
I have not called you to talk...

1241
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:49,044
but to give you this.

1242
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:55,416
You will open it...

1243
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:59,155
and tell me if it's enough.

1244
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:15,307
Are you trying to bribe me?

1245
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,908
You threw me in the river.

1246
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:23,015
And now you pay me
to speak well of your brothel?

1247
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:26,477
To not speak at all.

1248
01:30:26,621 --> 01:30:29,715
To never again mention the service.

1249
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:32,391
I don't know, Mister Pantoja.

1250
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:36,759
Pantyland is a very important
occurrence...

1251
01:30:36,898 --> 01:30:39,765
of the end of the millennium.

1252
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:45,305
CNN will want a chronicle.
That would get a great audience...

1253
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:50,410
Every month
you will receive an equal sum.

1254
01:30:55,683 --> 01:30:58,709
Now, you're talking, my friend!

1255
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:05,121
I won't waste your time.

1256
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:07,293
See you next month and...

1257
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:10,926
If you wish,
and for no extra cost...

1258
01:31:11,165 --> 01:31:14,100
I could make a special broadcast...

1259
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:16,496
to disprove some facts...

1260
01:31:16,737 --> 01:31:20,503
I made public against you
and could surely...

1261
01:31:20,741 --> 01:31:22,504
See you next month.

1262
01:31:39,594 --> 01:31:41,152
You're not eating?

1263
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:45,131
I'm not that hungry.

1264
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:51,264
You've lost a lot of weight,
since your wife left.

1265
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:53,699
So I've been told.

1266
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:58,542
Did they answer my report?

1267
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:04,310
Due to the alarming presence
of civilians on the riverbanks...

1268
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:08,488
I propose the
"Ordinary Rotation System."

1269
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:13,986
This will impede civilians
of estimating our arrival.

1270
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,420
To function adequately...

1271
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:21,828
the plan requires
100 visitors and 5 ships...

1272
01:32:22,069 --> 01:32:25,004
that would permanently
navigate the rivers.

1273
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:27,503
100 visitors? 5 ships?

1274
01:32:27,642 --> 01:32:30,941
That's nothing, tiger.
Listen to this.

1275
01:32:31,078 --> 01:32:35,811
I propose a bonus for
the visitors on convoy...

1276
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:39,816
considering they are
risking their lives.

1277
01:32:39,954 --> 01:32:44,254
I attach to the project,
a social security plan...

1278
01:32:44,492 --> 01:32:50,021
compensation for time served,
and other benefits...

1279
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:54,166
a worker is entitled to by law.

1280
01:32:54,302 --> 01:32:58,705
This isn't funny, Lopez.
This is starting to worry me.

1281
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:04,742
Are we supposed to pay whores'
benefits and stop buying weapons?

1282
01:33:04,879 --> 01:33:07,905
Your new plan is not authorized...

1283
01:33:08,282 --> 01:33:11,945
nor may you hire more visitors.

1284
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:17,116
I don't understand.

1285
01:33:17,358 --> 01:33:21,852
You made the service too efficient.

1286
01:33:21,996 --> 01:33:24,430
- They're scared.
- But, our goals!

1287
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:27,259
Demand is way ahead of supply.

1288
01:33:27,635 --> 01:33:29,728
Let things be.

1289
01:33:31,005 --> 01:33:34,270
Relax and take a break.

1290
01:33:34,642 --> 01:33:38,169
I will prepare
a more convincing report.

1291
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:40,746
I have the results
of the polls.

1292
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:44,078
Now officers are asking
for the service.

1293
01:33:46,387 --> 01:33:50,323
95% of Captains and below
request visitors...

1294
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:52,322
and 55% of the higher ranks.

1295
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:57,054
This service requires,
and that's still under the minimum...

1296
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:59,732
four vessels and 272 visitors.

1297
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:02,865
Yes, but...

1298
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:07,737
It would be a special group
of visitors, from Lima or overseas.

1299
01:34:08,075 --> 01:34:11,203
The OS! That's Officers' Section.

1300
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:13,074
It sounds nice.

1301
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:16,041
Exclusive Officers' service...

1302
01:34:21,188 --> 01:34:24,055
You're working too much.

1303
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:26,421
You're going to be sick.

1304
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:29,796
No task is worth your health.

1305
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:33,960
First, you wanted to quit.
Now you're working to death.

1306
01:34:34,435 --> 01:34:37,962
I resigned and was ordered
to continue.

1307
01:34:38,205 --> 01:34:41,641
And I shall do so
against all odds because...

1308
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:44,135
it's all I know.

1309
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:49,148
If only everybody was like you!

1310
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:56,046
What do you say we go
to Nauta and relax?

1311
01:34:57,625 --> 01:35:01,789
Thanks, but I have a lot
of work backed up.

1312
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:05,623
I'll turn in my project on Monday.
Don't get up.

1313
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:30,957
She left most of her clothes.

1314
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:36,561
Maybe she'll return.

1315
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:41,066
What do you think?

1316
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:43,195
I don't know.

1317
01:35:51,112 --> 01:35:53,910
I would never buy this.

1318
01:36:08,162 --> 01:36:10,790
Is this how decent ladies sleep?

1319
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:23,407
I look like a nun.

1320
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:27,305
Do you like me better this way?

1321
01:36:30,384 --> 01:36:31,942
What's the matter?

1322
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:36,455
Don't you know?
Can't you tell?

1323
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:38,820
Is this about tomorrow?

1324
01:36:39,059 --> 01:36:40,856
Not just tomorrow.

1325
01:36:40,995 --> 01:36:42,929
I don't want to work.

1326
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:46,793
I want to be with you.

1327
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:51,127
We are facing a crisis.

1328
01:36:51,272 --> 01:36:54,139
I have to convince my boss.

1329
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:57,173
And you are fussing about work!

1330
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:03,612
I'm just saying the boss's woman
always gets treated better.

1331
01:37:04,618 --> 01:37:07,246
But not me.

1332
01:37:07,388 --> 01:37:10,152
You treat me like a whore.

1333
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:17,597
Are you with me,
because I'm the boss?

1334
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:21,300
What do you think?

1335
01:37:26,774 --> 01:37:28,605
I'd rather not know.

1336
01:37:31,946 --> 01:37:33,880
Fire me, Panta.

1337
01:37:35,683 --> 01:37:37,913
End this.

1338
01:37:42,122 --> 01:37:43,419
You want that?

1339
01:38:04,478 --> 01:38:07,504
Good morning,
to all my Amazon friends...

1340
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:10,342
listening to this program...

1341
01:38:10,484 --> 01:38:16,514
throughout the farthest corners
of our jungle.

1342
01:38:17,591 --> 01:38:21,721
Today I wish to speak about
Mister Pantaleon Pantoja.

1343
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:25,193
- Turn it off!
- No, I want to hear.

1344
01:38:25,432 --> 01:38:28,026
Gentlemen admit their mistakes...

1345
01:38:28,269 --> 01:38:32,103
so I say this from
the bottom of my heart:

1346
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,541
I misjudged you, Mister Panta.

1347
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:43,548
Letters signed by
the very soldiers and Sergeants...

1348
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:49,218
that patrol our borders
keep pouring in...

1349
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:52,893
and in them they tell me:
Mister Sinchi...

1350
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:56,061
why do you insult Mister Pantaleon?

1351
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:58,061
Get ready, girls.

1352
01:38:58,299 --> 01:39:02,702
Nobody has ever done for us
what he is doing.

1353
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:05,461
We have needs. And thanks...

1354
01:39:05,639 --> 01:39:09,040
to Mister Panta
we serve our country better.

1355
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:12,871
These sincere comments
made me think.

1356
01:39:13,113 --> 01:39:17,516
When I denounced Pantoja,
I forgot about the soldiers...

1357
01:39:17,685 --> 01:39:20,620
and about the commendable mission...

1358
01:39:20,888 --> 01:39:26,224
that Mister Pantaleon
has been carrying out to satisfy...

1359
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:30,362
the needs of Peru's sentinels.

1360
01:39:30,531 --> 01:39:34,092
Attention Horcones post.
We're approaching.

1361
01:39:34,335 --> 01:39:37,429
Arrival in ten minutes.
I repeat...

1362
01:39:51,051 --> 01:39:54,578
Horcones!
We are being hijacked!

1363
01:39:54,822 --> 01:39:59,020
Horcones, do you copy, damn it?

1364
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:02,421
This is the Eva!
May day!

1365
01:40:02,563 --> 01:40:08,627
Mister Panta, as he has fondly
come to be known in our jungle...

1366
01:40:08,869 --> 01:40:11,565
does not look for fame
or recognition...

1367
01:40:21,915 --> 01:40:23,815
Spread your legs!

1368
01:40:23,951 --> 01:40:29,617
Dear friends, I have in my hands
a report from the police.

1369
01:40:31,392 --> 01:40:35,954
Do you know how many rapes
have been reported...

1370
01:40:36,296 --> 01:40:38,821
since Mister Panta...

1371
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:42,968
started the Visitors' Service?

1372
01:40:43,103 --> 01:40:48,131
Zero!
You heard right, zero!

1373
01:40:54,448 --> 01:40:56,279
Shit! Soldiers!

1374
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:05,049
Damned soldiers!

1375
01:41:22,609 --> 01:41:26,409
Our jungle is calm.

1376
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:30,415
Our mothers, sisters and girlfriends...

1377
01:41:30,651 --> 01:41:34,382
can now walk the streets
without fear.

1378
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:41,523
The people of Loreto
can take pride in living...

1379
01:41:41,762 --> 01:41:44,458
in the only place in the world...

1380
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:49,431
where sexual crimes
are no more.

1381
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:54,234
Emotion overwhelms me
and I speak for myself...

1382
01:41:54,475 --> 01:41:58,206
as for the whole Amazon region
when I say:

1383
01:41:58,545 --> 01:42:00,570
Thank you, Mister Panta.

1384
01:42:00,814 --> 01:42:05,410
Thanks to you
and to your valiant ladies.

1385
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:15,920
Could you please leave me alone?

1386
01:43:18,725 --> 01:43:21,125
Mourned through the night...

1387
01:43:21,295 --> 01:43:26,665
the mauled body of Olga Arellano,
also known as Colombiana...

1388
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:30,160
reaches its final resting place.

1389
01:43:30,404 --> 01:43:32,599
This is The Sinchi...

1390
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:35,872
we are at the Cemetery...

1391
01:43:36,109 --> 01:43:38,805
and many people have attended.

1392
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:42,815
The coffin is approaching
its final place...

1393
01:43:43,083 --> 01:43:47,019
accompanied by a military escort.

1394
01:43:47,287 --> 01:43:51,018
Yes indeed,
a military escort and an officer.

1395
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:12,769
At ease!

1396
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:28,690
I am resurrection and life.

1397
01:44:28,929 --> 01:44:33,423
Those that live in me
shall not die eternally.

1398
01:44:34,768 --> 01:44:38,499
Lord, receive this sinner
and grant her...

1399
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:41,073
eternal rest.

1400
01:44:41,341 --> 01:44:43,036
Lord, hear our prayer.

1401
01:45:15,242 --> 01:45:16,675
Olga Arellano...

1402
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:21,941
we wear our glorious Peruvian uniform...

1403
01:45:23,216 --> 01:45:25,810
to mourn you.

1404
01:45:27,554 --> 01:45:30,955
It is our duty
to make known to the world...

1405
01:45:31,191 --> 01:45:34,422
with a full sense of responsibility...

1406
01:45:35,696 --> 01:45:39,097
that you have fallen
in the line of duty.

1407
01:45:41,268 --> 01:45:42,929
You are a martyr...

1408
01:45:44,404 --> 01:45:48,932
consecrated to serving
the soldiers of Peru.

1409
01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:55,748
Beloved Olga Arellano.

1410
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:58,016
Your soldiers...

1411
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:02,384
spread through the Amazon region...

1412
01:46:02,889 --> 01:46:05,653
whose lives you enlightened...

1413
01:46:07,227 --> 01:46:08,694
weep for you.

1414
01:46:10,230 --> 01:46:12,994
Your coworkers weep for you too.

1415
01:46:14,601 --> 01:46:16,660
In their name I tell you...

1416
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:20,301
your sacrifice was not in vain.

1417
01:46:21,475 --> 01:46:26,310
It will motivate us
in our army-given mission.

1418
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:32,746
Personally...

1419
01:46:35,088 --> 01:46:38,888
allow me to thank you deeply...

1420
01:46:41,294 --> 01:46:43,728
for so many tokens of affection...

1421
01:46:46,500 --> 01:46:48,866
for so many intimate lessons...

1422
01:46:50,337 --> 01:46:52,100
that I shall never forget.

1423
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:56,103
Olga Arellano...

1424
01:46:57,344 --> 01:46:59,471
rest in peace.

1425
01:47:00,347 --> 01:47:02,577
Attention!

1426
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:05,884
Present arms!

1427
01:47:32,813 --> 01:47:34,576
Get out of the army...

1428
01:47:34,714 --> 01:47:37,444
and stay with us.

1429
01:47:37,684 --> 01:47:40,653
We have a small sum
we wish to invest.

1430
01:47:40,821 --> 01:47:43,551
We could even apply for a loan.

1431
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:46,386
With your brains, we'd be...

1432
01:47:46,526 --> 01:47:48,323
rich in no time.

1433
01:47:48,728 --> 01:47:51,288
I was ordered
to organize the service.

1434
01:47:52,032 --> 01:47:55,195
It's not a business interest.

1435
01:47:56,236 --> 01:47:58,101
Start your own business.

1436
01:47:58,338 --> 01:48:00,738
We don't want another brothel.

1437
01:48:00,874 --> 01:48:03,672
We want a company of visitors.

1438
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:06,310
A modern, efficient company.

1439
01:48:06,746 --> 01:48:08,111
You'd be the boss.

1440
01:48:12,285 --> 01:48:14,219
I need to have bosses.

1441
01:48:14,855 --> 01:48:16,516
If I don't have them...

1442
01:48:18,792 --> 01:48:20,555
I don't know what to do.

1443
01:48:20,794 --> 01:48:23,262
I'm made to obey orders.

1444
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:26,793
My calling is the army...

1445
01:48:26,933 --> 01:48:29,401
and I wish to die a soldier.

1446
01:48:30,403 --> 01:48:32,371
You must understand that.

1447
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:37,305
What is it, Chuchupe?
I said no crying.

1448
01:48:37,744 --> 01:48:41,077
Forgive me, but I can't help myself.

1449
01:48:41,314 --> 01:48:45,683
It's the best job I've had.
Why do they shut it down?

1450
01:48:45,819 --> 01:48:49,414
The soldiers were so happy.

1451
01:48:50,757 --> 01:48:54,193
The goals were being reached
perfectly...

1452
01:48:56,897 --> 01:48:58,762
but that's the army.

1453
01:48:58,999 --> 01:49:01,866
The bosses know best.

1454
01:49:05,906 --> 01:49:08,500
Lighten up, Chuchupe.

1455
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:38,202
Excuse me, Miss.
Maybe there's a mix-up.

1456
01:49:38,438 --> 01:49:41,498
My appointment was at six.
Must I still wait?

1457
01:49:41,775 --> 01:49:43,402
Yes.

1458
01:49:43,643 --> 01:49:47,272
They're interviewing the General.

1459
01:49:49,382 --> 01:49:52,977
Look, it's starting!

1460
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:55,883
Miss, the army has never sponsored...

1461
01:49:56,122 --> 01:49:59,250
or financed such an enterprise.

1462
01:49:59,392 --> 01:50:03,089
You deny the existence
of the service?

1463
01:50:03,229 --> 01:50:06,824
Of course I do, Miss.
Categorically.

1464
01:50:06,967 --> 01:50:09,367
We've seen Captain Pantoja...

1465
01:50:09,502 --> 01:50:11,197
giving military honors...

1466
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:15,741
to a prostitute.
He stated that the murderers...

1467
01:50:15,909 --> 01:50:18,002
should be court-martialed.

1468
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:19,736
Miss, those ideas...

1469
01:50:19,879 --> 01:50:21,779
don't hold water.

1470
01:50:21,915 --> 01:50:24,383
High Command
has ordered an investigation...

1471
01:50:24,651 --> 01:50:26,744
to the last consequences.

1472
01:50:27,687 --> 01:50:28,847
And I assure you...

1473
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:33,449
that those responsible
will be punished.

1474
01:50:33,727 --> 01:50:35,957
Thank you.
Studios.

1475
01:50:36,896 --> 01:50:38,557
You're famous.

1476
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,366
Could I have your autograph?

1477
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:55,645
You know who just left?

1478
01:50:55,782 --> 01:51:00,151
Yes, General, sir.
I saw the interview.

1479
01:51:00,387 --> 01:51:02,480
I want no explanations.

1480
01:51:02,956 --> 01:51:06,289
I saw you giving
your pathetic address.

1481
01:51:06,526 --> 01:51:08,824
Whatever!
You went mad and...

1482
01:51:09,062 --> 01:51:13,556
honestly, there is
no punishment severe enough...

1483
01:51:13,733 --> 01:51:17,066
for your acts.
Not even a firing squad.

1484
01:51:17,303 --> 01:51:21,171
I alone am responsible.
I accept any punishment.

1485
01:51:21,975 --> 01:51:26,241
You will go before
a disciplinary council, Pantoja.

1486
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:30,716
That means you will be expelled.

1487
01:51:31,217 --> 01:51:33,151
Because of your record...

1488
01:51:34,087 --> 01:51:37,056
we offer you a more dignified exit:

1489
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:40,922
Ask to be discharged tomorrow.

1490
01:51:44,297 --> 01:51:46,424
I will not, sir.

1491
01:51:46,566 --> 01:51:51,003
Your career is over.
You committed professional suicide.

1492
01:51:51,438 --> 01:51:53,429
Work as a civilian.

1493
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:57,275
Your managing talent
can't be denied.

1494
01:51:57,510 --> 01:52:00,206
You'll make more money.

1495
01:52:02,782 --> 01:52:05,774
Are you crying, Pantoja?

1496
01:52:05,952 --> 01:52:07,886
Be a man, damn it!

1497
01:52:08,121 --> 01:52:12,217
I beg you excuse
my weakness, General, sir.

1498
01:52:13,593 --> 01:52:16,027
But I can only be a soldier...

1499
01:52:16,629 --> 01:52:20,725
it's my life.
If you make me leave...

1500
01:52:24,104 --> 01:52:27,039
Do you wish to remain
a Captain forever?

1501
01:52:27,173 --> 01:52:31,473
This will stain your record for life.

1502
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:35,577
I will try to redeem myself.

1503
01:52:35,715 --> 01:52:38,548
You don't wish to be discharged?

1504
01:52:39,719 --> 01:52:41,687
We'll make it tough on you.

1505
01:52:41,855 --> 01:52:44,722
You know how that is.

1506
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:48,624
I know.
I'll withstand anything.

1507
01:53:24,197 --> 01:53:28,827
My responsibilities impeded me
from answering earlier.

1508
01:53:33,106 --> 01:53:37,600
My wife, my daughter, Marina,
who is a beauty...

1509
01:53:37,877 --> 01:53:42,678
and my mission are my main
distractions and companions.

1510
01:53:43,249 --> 01:53:45,183
Regardless of distance...

1511
01:53:46,519 --> 01:53:50,046
I remember you with affection.

1512
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:54,487
Give my regards to Mrs. Leonor
and Chupito...

1513
01:53:55,028 --> 01:53:58,361
to Pechuga and the rest
of my ex-visitors...

1514
01:53:58,598 --> 01:54:00,998
whom I never will forget.

1515
01:54:01,634 --> 01:54:06,571
Receive a warm hug from
your friend, Pantaleon Pantoja...

1516
01:54:06,739 --> 01:54:09,674
Peruvian Army Captain.

1517
01:54:11,978 --> 01:54:15,470
Read it again, please.
It's so beautiful.

1518
01:54:22,989 --> 01:54:24,320
Lieutenant.

1519
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:27,593
I write this letter...

1520
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:30,024
at four degrees below zero.

1521
01:54:30,163 --> 01:54:32,427
Collazos sent me...

1522
01:54:32,565 --> 01:54:36,092
to an isolated post.

1523
01:54:36,236 --> 01:54:38,227
My mission is to carry out...

1524
01:54:38,504 --> 01:54:41,905
social labor
in the area of literacy.

1525
01:54:43,176 --> 01:54:47,010
The 1973 census
recorded 1,784,281...

1526
01:54:47,146 --> 01:54:48,738
illiterate individuals...

1527
01:54:48,982 --> 01:54:53,248
and this region had the lowest
literacy rate in the country:

1528
01:54:53,653 --> 01:54:55,211
36.9%.

1529
01:54:55,488 --> 01:54:59,424
Which means 658,399 illiterate.

1530
01:55:02,629 --> 01:55:05,655
I... love...

1531
01:55:05,932 --> 01:55:09,026
my... Peru.

1532
01:55:09,168 --> 01:55:13,730
According to estimates,
an adult with an IQ...

1533
01:55:13,873 --> 01:55:18,037
not under 80 learns to read
in 6 to 9 months.

1534
01:55:18,177 --> 01:55:20,372
See you tomorrow.

1535
01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:21,844
Very good.

1536
01:55:21,981 --> 01:55:26,213
I've formed eight groups of fifteen...

1537
01:55:26,452 --> 01:55:29,046
which comes to 120 students.

1538
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:31,880
Being optimistic...

1539
01:55:32,058 --> 01:55:35,425
illiteracy will be eradicated
in 6 years.

1540
01:55:36,129 --> 01:55:40,225
I continue to serve
our glorious institution...

1541
01:55:40,366 --> 01:55:42,493
with dedication.

1542
01:55:45,872 --> 01:55:47,840
Are you finished?

1543
01:55:48,007 --> 01:55:50,271
There's a group at six.

1544
01:55:50,510 --> 01:55:52,444
Absenteeism is high...

1545
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:55,773
that could invalidate my estimates.

1546
01:55:56,015 --> 01:55:58,142
I'll make house calls.

1547
01:55:58,384 --> 01:56:01,182
You can't stop working!

1548
01:56:01,421 --> 01:56:02,615
Let's go home.

1549
01:56:02,755 --> 01:56:05,019
I'll be right with you.

1550
01:56:07,894 --> 01:56:10,419
I hate your smoking habit.

1551
01:56:10,697 --> 01:56:14,098
It's because of the cold, Pocha.

1552
01:56:14,334 --> 01:56:17,132
I'll be in the house.
Don't be long...
