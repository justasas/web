1
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:40,303
Dr. Blood!

2
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:44,680
Who is it?

3
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:47,848
That we'll know better
when you've opened the door.

4
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,285
Me?

5
00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:53,386
My mistake. After I've opened the door.

6
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,555
Open it, quick!

7
00:02:59,965 --> 00:03:01,364
Why, Jeremy Pitt, isn't it?

8
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:05,233
It's your friend, Lord Gildoy, wounded
at Andrew Baynes' farm by the river.

9
00:03:05,371 --> 00:03:07,862
- The rash fool.
- He sent me for you. No time to lose.

10
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,034
Why, to be sure, I'll lose none,
nor my head either.

11
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,169
Come in and regain yours
while I get my things.

12
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:15,236
- I'll wait here.
- As you please.

13
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:17,407
Come, Mrs. Barlow, help me dress.

14
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:22,815
Jeremy, how was the battle?

15
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:24,981
Battle? Slaughter, rather!

16
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:27,082
What can clubs do against cannon?

17
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:31,926
In case this business keeps me overlong,
take care you water my geraniums...

18
00:03:31,997 --> 00:03:34,022
especially those
under the bedroom window.

19
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:36,033
Geraniums. Won't you ever grow up?

20
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:38,899
One would think you were still
at medical school.

21
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:40,705
Geraniums!

22
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:42,604
You would think of geraniums...

23
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:45,235
when every other able-bodied man
is out fighting.

24
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,609
It's out of favor I seem to be with you,
my vinegary virgin.

25
00:03:48,914 --> 00:03:51,439
- Half the town is saying you're a papist.
- Why?

26
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:55,009
Because I have the sense to sleep tonight
instead of rushing to my ruin...

27
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:57,681
in an attempt to put
this Duke of Monmouth on the throne?

28
00:03:57,756 --> 00:03:59,553
He'd be even worse than King James.

29
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,957
Make haste with that cloak there,
my pretty one.

30
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:04,222
And the other half of the town
that defends you...

31
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:06,662
claims that you're just a coward.

32
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:10,300
Mrs. Barlow, my darling,
you can tell them, if you like...

33
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:13,167
that I've been most anywhere
that fighting was in evidence.

34
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:17,072
Fought for the French against the Spanish,
and the Spanish against the French...

35
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:19,804
and I learned my seamanship
in the Dutch Navy.

36
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:23,940
But having had adventure enough
in six years to last me six lives...

37
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:27,577
I came here, hung up the sword,
and picked up the lancet.

38
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,180
Became a man of peace and not of war.
A healer, not a slayer...

39
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:36,216
and that I am going to be as long as
I'm on top of the sod and not under it.

40
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:47,230
- Will you be back for breakfast?
- Who knows, my pretty one?

41
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:02,312
The worst is done, my friend.
Give your mind peace.

42
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:27,609
The King's men!

43
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:32,217
There's nothing to fear.
This is a Christian country.

44
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:35,219
Christian men don't make war
on the wounded...

45
00:05:35,287 --> 00:05:37,016
or those who shelter them.

46
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:47,093
I'm Capt. Hobart of Col. Kirke's dragoons.

47
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,793
What rebels do you harbor?

48
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:52,030
No rebels. This wounded gentleman...

49
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:54,004
No need to ask
how he came by his wounds.

50
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:56,040
A rebel. Out with him.

51
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:01,746
This man can't be moved
without peril to his life.

52
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:05,306
Who the devil may you be?

53
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:07,713
Peter Blood, Medicinae Baccalaureus.

54
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:09,413
Don't fling your French at me.

55
00:06:09,488 --> 00:06:11,649
Latin, my dull friend.
It means I'm a doctor.

56
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:13,418
Or a liar.

57
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:17,394
If your wit were as big as your voice,
it's the great man you'd be for this.

58
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:20,192
You may find me great enough
to hang you!

59
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:22,966
Yes, I don't doubt it.

60
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:25,765
You've the looks and manners
of a hangman.

61
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:27,965
Take him away, and the others, too!

62
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:02,140
"ln the name of His Majesty,
Our Sovereign Lord...

63
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:05,802
"prisoners of the Crown,

00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:07,998

00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:16,284

00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:55,356
"and by a jury of 12 good men and true."

80
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:01,693
James Haynsworth, hold up your hand.

81
00:08:02,134 --> 00:08:04,466
- Guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.

82
00:08:04,536 --> 00:08:08,165
- Harold Carron, guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.

83
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,734
- Andrew Baynes, guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.

84
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:17,247
- Jeremy Pitt, guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.

85
00:08:17,316 --> 00:08:22,253
- John Wolverstone, guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.

86
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:26,414
Uriah Ogle, guilty or not guilty?

87
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:28,584
Guilty. Praise the Lord.

88
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,460
Henry Hagthorpe, guilty or not guilty?

89
00:08:33,165 --> 00:08:34,154
Guilty.

90
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:39,192
- Lord Chester Dyke, guilty or not guilty?
- Guilty.

91
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:43,337
Peter Blood, guilty or not guilty?

92
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:45,774
It's entirely innocent, I am.

93
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,607
Take the stand and face His Lordship.

94
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:55,852
Are you guilty or not guilty?
You must use the right words.

95
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:59,720
Words, is it? Not guilty.

96
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:04,089
And speaking of words, I'd like to
say a few about the injustice...

97
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:07,063
of keeping an innocent man
locked up for three months...

98
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:11,728
in such filth and heat and ill-feeding
that my chief regret is I didn't try...

99
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:14,397
to pull down the filthy fellow
that sits on the throne.

100
00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:15,770
Silence!

101
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:19,470
Are you entirely ignorant
of the proper procedure of the court?

102
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:21,512
Most happily ignorant up to now.

103
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,878
I could gladly have done
without this acquaintance.

104
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:25,814
Enough of this.

105
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:30,351
There is nothing more to be said,
except the passing of sentence.

106
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:33,481
May it please Your Lordship,
but there's a deal more to be said!

107
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:35,048
Silence!

108
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:38,858
- How now, fellow?
- There is the little matter of my defense.

109
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,160
Very well, then...

110
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:44,093
but in heaven's name, be brief, man.

111
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:46,332
We have much to do.

112
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,099
I am guilty of nothing, my lord...

113
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:53,243
unless it be adjudged a crime
that a man try to live peaceably.

114
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:56,041
Living peaceably
with the army of Monmouth?

115
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:58,309
I was not with Monmouth's army, my lord.

116
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:01,113
I was arrested while engaging
in my profession as physician.

117
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:04,815
What's this?
You tell us you're a doctor, you rogue?

118
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,157
And as such was summoned
to the aid of Lord Gildoy...

119
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:11,389
by Jeremy Pitt, who can so testify.

120
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:14,398
Master Pitt will testify.

121
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:16,900
He that is himself a confessed traitor.

122
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:20,499
- ls that your witness?
- There is also Andrew Baynes.

123
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:23,439
Master Baynes
will have enough testifying...

124
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:26,841
in a useless effort
to keep his own neck from the halter.

125
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:29,779
I can bring a hundred from Bridgwater,
the town where I live.

126
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:31,941
We've no time for all this.

127
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:35,282
If these other traitors
are as stubborn as you...

128
00:10:35,353 --> 00:10:37,981
I may sit here till the next assizes.

129
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:40,356
Very well, then.

130
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:43,258
There's a witness I'll give you
that you can't deny:

131
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:44,886
yourself, sir.

132
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:48,797
For if I'm not physician,
how is it I know that you're a dying man?

133
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:57,607
The death to which you're dooming
hundreds of poor men daily...

134
00:10:57,676 --> 00:11:01,772
in a frantic effort to send their souls
to perdition before your own...

135
00:11:01,847 --> 00:11:03,747
is a light pleasantry...

136
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:06,045
compared to the bleeding death
in the lungs...

137
00:11:06,118 --> 00:11:08,814
to which the great Judge
has condemned you.

138
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,947
Now, fellow,
we'll be done with the witnesses...

139
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:16,255
and I will convict you
out of your own rascally mouth.

140
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:21,390
When this Pitt came to summon you,
as you claim...

141
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,333
did you know you were called
to attend another rebel?

142
00:11:24,402 --> 00:11:27,098
My business was with his wounds,
not his politics.

143
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:29,072
Did you know the law...

144
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:33,007
that any person who does
knowingly receive, harbor, comfort...

145
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:37,981
or succor a rebel
is as guilty as if he himself bore arms?

146
00:11:38,049 --> 00:11:40,882
I only knew my sacred duty as a physician.

147
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:44,919
Your sacred duty, rogue, is to your king!

148
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:51,695
I thought it was to my fellow man.

149
00:11:58,336 --> 00:12:02,067
It's a fearful thing
to send a man's soul to perdition...

150
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:05,409
but I am bound by my conscience...

151
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:08,810
and my love of my king to deal out justice.

152
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:18,745
Therefore, I instruct you,
gentlemen of the jury...

153
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:22,387
that inasmuch as Peter Blood
has admitted...

154
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,894
aiding a traitor to your king...

155
00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:27,761
you do bring in a verdict of guilty...

156
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,027
that he may be hanged...

157
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:32,763
for the high treason he has committed.

158
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:41,835
What a creature must sit on the throne...

159
00:12:41,913 --> 00:12:44,905
who lets a man like you
deal out his justice.

160
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:54,157
- Your Majesty.
- Sunderland, what brings you here?

161
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:56,126
These numerous hangings.

162
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:59,595
Splendid, aren't they?
We kill the rebels, we kill the rebellion.

163
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:01,291
Very true, Your Majesty...

164
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,698
but a foolish waste
of valuable human flesh.

165
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:04,792
How so?

166
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:09,697
Your Majesty's colonies in the West Indies
are urgently in need of slaves.

167
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:14,741
A healthy, vigorous man
can be reckoned worth from £10 to £20.

168
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:17,304
Splendid, Sunderland.

169
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:21,578
Send out word immediately that the King
is graciously pleased to command...

170
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:24,713
that all rebels convicted
but not yet hanged...

171
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:26,120
be gathered together...

172
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:29,752
and shipped by the first available boats
to the Americas.

173
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:58,520
Give us water!
There are men dying down here.

174
00:14:16,474 --> 00:14:20,205
You'd think they'd take better care
of a valuable cargo like us.

175
00:14:38,797 --> 00:14:42,824
Ahoy, the deck! Land sighted, Port Royal!

176
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:55,504
It's a truly royal clemency we're granted,
my friends...

177
00:14:55,947 --> 00:14:58,745
one well worthy of King James.

178
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:04,881
He spares us the mercifully quick
extinction of the hangman's rope...

179
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,253
and gives the slow death of slavery.

180
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:12,053
He grants us our lives
in exchange for a living death.

181
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,828
It's an uncertain world entirely.

182
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:37,250
"Be it known, men, that these prisoners
who stand before you...

183
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:40,155
"are now to be sold at a right
and fitting price.

184
00:15:40,225 --> 00:15:42,693
"They may be put to labor
in the sulfur mines...

185
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:45,161
"or on the plantations
for a period of 10 years.

186
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,164
"And the parties
to whom they are assigned...

187
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:49,598
"must enter into security
for the proper punishment...

188
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:50,691
"of their offense."

189
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:52,669
His Excellency, the Governor of Port Royal.

190
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:55,763
Guards, attention! Present muskets.

191
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:59,474
Good day, Captain. Lovely day, isn't it?
Or is it?

192
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:03,340
- Good day, Dixon.
- Good day, Governor.

193
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:06,282
I suppose we can begin this sale now,
Governor.

194
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:08,285
No, better wait for Col. Bishop.

195
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:11,322
He has the privilege
of being late for everything.

196
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:13,152
Yes, I know.

197
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:14,623
There he is.

198
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,601
- Good afternoon, Col. Bishop.
- Good afternoon, Governor.

199
00:16:29,674 --> 00:16:31,164
Good afternoon, Miss Arabella.

200
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:33,267
How is my darling, the Governor,
and his foot?

201
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:36,040
Every day I think my gout
can't get any worse...

202
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:38,139
and every day it does.

203
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:41,377
My dear Colonel,
according to the King's request...

204
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:45,219
it is for you to take first choice
of this dainty nosegay...

205
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:48,788
and at your own price.

206
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:51,127
Egad, they're an appalling lot...

207
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:53,357
not likely to be of much value
on the plantation.

208
00:16:53,431 --> 00:16:55,160
The less you want, the more for Dixon.

209
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:58,168
- Dixon? Uncle, I wish you'd buy them all.
- Buy them all?

210
00:16:58,236 --> 00:17:00,033
To keep them out of Dixon's hands.

211
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:03,096
I perceive somebody's been talking
behind my back...

212
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:04,607
telling the truth.

213
00:17:04,676 --> 00:17:07,668
- And you can joke.
- Arabella dear, don't be childish.

214
00:17:07,745 --> 00:17:10,043
These men are rebels against their king.

215
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,014
They should be hanged, drawn,
and quartered.

216
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,984
- Any fate they meet is too good for them.
- Your uncle is right.

217
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:17,544
- Let the sale commence.
- My foot!

218
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:21,558
My dear, the law is the law,
and it's His Majesty's law...

219
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:23,388
and must be obeyed.

220
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:26,759
The best of the lot.

221
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,000
Open your mouth.

222
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:35,238
- £20.
- Sold!

223
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:37,774
Sold to Col. Bishop for £20.

224
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:44,212
- As if he were buying horses.
- Yes, quite.

225
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:58,420
- Same price.
- This is Jeremy Pitt, ship's pilot...

226
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,157
young and sturdy.

227
00:18:04,402 --> 00:18:05,630
- Same price.
- Sold!

228
00:18:05,703 --> 00:18:07,864
Sold to Col. Bishop for £20.

229
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,042
Quiet!

230
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:23,584
Open your mouth.

231
00:18:41,406 --> 00:18:44,807
His pride has bought him a ticket
to Dixon's mines.

232
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,973
He isn't there yet.

233
00:18:49,614 --> 00:18:52,981
- My dear, consider your social position!
- Uncle!

234
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:00,957
- Which one?
- That one.

235
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,185
- Him? I will not.
- But I want you to.

236
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:07,857
No. Let him cool his head
in Dixon's mines. I'll have none of him.

237
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:13,961
- £5.
- £5? That's an insulting sum to offer.

238
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,474
- Does anyone offer more?
- £6.

239
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,269
£7.

240
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:24,212
You're making an exhibition of yourself...

241
00:19:24,282 --> 00:19:26,978
a girl like you,
bidding for a slave before these people.

242
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:28,451
- Will you buy him?
- Certainly not.

243
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,679
£8.

244
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:36,026
When a lady's interested in a man....

245
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:38,585
Calm down, Dixon,
£8 is nothing for such a man...

246
00:19:38,863 --> 00:19:41,957
a skilled physician,
a gentleman, and a scholar.

247
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,866
- All right, £9.
- £10!

248
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:50,240
It's apparent Miss Bishop wants him
more than I do.

249
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:52,572
Sold to Miss Arabella Bishop for £10.

250
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:56,873
Sold!

251
00:19:57,882 --> 00:19:59,247
£10, sold.

252
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:02,778
What would you like done with him,
Miss Bishop?

253
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:05,516
Why, I don't know.

254
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,287
You're extremely foolish.
It might have cost you your life.

255
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:15,432
It was fortunate for you
that I was here to save you.

256
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,866
I hardly consider it fortunate to be bought
by anyone by the name of Bishop.

257
00:20:20,938 --> 00:20:23,099
You could learn a lesson in gratitude.

258
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:25,334
I could thank for not interfering.

259
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:29,511
As it happens, you are hardly in a position
to have anything to say about it.

260
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,810
You may join the others belonging
to my uncle...

261
00:20:31,883 --> 00:20:35,046
and henceforth you may take your orders
from him.

262
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:39,112
Your very humble slave, Miss Bishop.

263
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,843
Come on. Move on, there.

264
00:22:01,072 --> 00:22:03,540
Last night, this dog attempted to escape.

265
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:06,608
Today you'll see what happens
to those who forget...

266
00:22:06,677 --> 00:22:09,976
that my friend King James
did you all a favor...

267
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:12,845
in saving you from your just fate
on the gallows.

268
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:14,908
Show them the iron, Kent.

269
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:25,190
F-T.

270
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:29,523
Whoever wears that brand
is known as a fugitive traitor...

271
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,397
and will be treated as such.

272
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:34,064
Burn those letters in your brain...

273
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:36,905
lest they be burned on your hides, too.

274
00:22:37,175 --> 00:22:41,908
There speaks a fit friend for King James
if ever I heard one.

275
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:46,544
Would I had him and his friend James
roasting on a spit over that fire.

276
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:51,854
Great would be the burning thereof
and loud the rejoicing in Heaven.

277
00:22:53,224 --> 00:22:54,691
Do your duty!

278
00:23:08,406 --> 00:23:12,740
What a cruel shame
that any man is made to suffer so.

279
00:23:14,612 --> 00:23:18,776
- This beastly gout!
- Perhaps a new dressing will help.

280
00:23:18,883 --> 00:23:19,872
Perhaps.

281
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:21,680
- I have it here.
- Put it down.

282
00:23:21,752 --> 00:23:23,083
So sorry, Doctor.

283
00:23:23,154 --> 00:23:25,019
Easy, you clumsy louts!

284
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:28,581
- We won't hurt you, Governor.
- You thick-fingered jackasses!

285
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:30,926
His Excellency will have his little joke.

286
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:33,259
Ill-begotten bunglers!

287
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:35,856
- Blundering pill peddlers!
- Your Excellency...

288
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,491
That is the final straw.

289
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:43,800
Out of this house...

290
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,968
and never let me see your faces again.

291
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:48,477
- But think of our reputations.
- Hang your reputations!

292
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:51,037
Leave me! I don't want to see you again!

293
00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:53,310
Away! Out!

294
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:55,750
I don't want to see you!
Out into the streets!

295
00:23:56,888 --> 00:23:59,880
Stop shouting.
You brought on my headache again.

296
00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:02,221
Good! Hannibal, come take my crutch.

297
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,327
Easy, now. Help me up with my foot.

298
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:07,159
No remedy. Why, thank you, dear.

299
00:24:12,937 --> 00:24:15,269
Why doesn't His Excellency
try another doctor?

300
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:16,533
Another doctor?

301
00:24:16,607 --> 00:24:19,007
There are only those two
on this wretched island...

302
00:24:19,076 --> 00:24:21,806
- and each one is worse than his partner.
- There is another.

303
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:25,246
And according to what I've heard,
he became a slave by being a doctor.

304
00:24:25,316 --> 00:24:26,715
A slave?

305
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:30,481
Would you elevate a slave
to the position of doctor to the Governor?

306
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:34,318
- ls he a good doctor?
- I don't know.

307
00:24:39,196 --> 00:24:40,720
Why are you laughing?

308
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:44,034
I'm just thinking how annoyed
Peter Blood would be...

309
00:24:44,101 --> 00:24:46,035
if I did him another favor.

310
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:52,307
Your Excellency, there are diverse citizens
of this sovereign island...

311
00:24:52,376 --> 00:24:54,310
who come before you with complaints.

312
00:24:54,378 --> 00:24:56,369
Complaints, complaints.

313
00:24:56,781 --> 00:25:00,217
Can none of my citizens
follow the example of their governor...

314
00:25:00,451 --> 00:25:03,716
who endures the utmost agony
without a murmur?

315
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:08,018
- Easy there, fellow.
- Did I hurt you, sir?

316
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:10,720
No, but I thought you were going to.

317
00:25:11,562 --> 00:25:14,656
Your Excellency,
this vagrant hides his sins...

318
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:16,825
behind the name of Honesty Nuttall.

319
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:20,837
- He's charged with being in debt.
- State your case, fellow, and no lies.

320
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:23,237
I was on the way to pay the butcher
on Tuesday...

321
00:25:23,307 --> 00:25:27,038
as Honesty Nuttall is my name,
when I chanced on a poor old beggar.

322
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:28,601
It was Jones from the grog shop...

323
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,738
who begged me to have a drink with him.

324
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:32,806
Try standing on it, Your Honor.

325
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:36,883
Stand on that bundle of pain? Impossible.

326
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:40,783
I remembered in time my poor
starving wife in need of the five bob.

327
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:44,624
What is this all about? Silence!

328
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:47,454
- Sit down.
- What's he here for?

329
00:25:47,531 --> 00:25:49,931
For debt, Your Excellency,
and the prevaricator...

330
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:53,596
lf it's for debt,
don't annoy me with such petty things.

331
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:55,571
Order him to work it off.

332
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:58,802
Work? Not that, anything but work.

333
00:25:58,876 --> 00:26:00,173
What's your trade?

334
00:26:00,244 --> 00:26:03,543
I'm a ship's carpenter
when the painful necessity arises.

335
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:05,079
Take him to work on the docks...

336
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:08,016
and don't you attempt to escape
till every farthing's paid...

337
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:10,076
or I'll stretch your hide on the rack!

338
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:12,554
Escape? How could a debtor escape
from this island...

339
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:14,989
even if he had a boat to do it with?

340
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,028
I couldn't escape any more
than a slave could escape.

341
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:22,228
I can walk.

342
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,229
Wonderful, my dear fellow.

343
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:27,270
Only two months' treatment,
and I'm a well man.

344
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:28,896
It's a miracle.

345
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,769
- The next complaint...
- Drat the next complaint. I can walk.

346
00:26:32,843 --> 00:26:34,367
Come, Doctor.

347
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:37,608
You'll get your reward for this,
Peter Blood.

348
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:41,481
- From now on, you're my physician.
- Your Excellency is too kind.

349
00:26:41,552 --> 00:26:44,715
Come back early tomorrow.
You're always welcome, Dr. Blood.

350
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:08,200
Hello.

351
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:22,783
Don't I know you?

352
00:27:23,494 --> 00:27:25,689
A lady should know her own property.

353
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:29,462
- My property?
- Let me refresh your memory.

354
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:32,966
My name is Peter Blood,
and I'm worth precisely £10.

355
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:37,468
Forgive me for not recognizing you,
Dr. Blood.

356
00:27:37,541 --> 00:27:39,304
You're so changed...

357
00:27:39,844 --> 00:27:41,004
for the better.

358
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,343
The Governor tells me
I have you to thank for that.

359
00:27:44,415 --> 00:27:46,679
You don't sound very grateful, Dr. Blood.

360
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,948
Do you think I'd be grateful for an easy life
when my friends are treated like animals?

361
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:54,582
It's they deserve your favors, not I.
They're all honest rebels.

362
00:27:54,658 --> 00:27:57,718
I was snoring in my bed
while they were trying to free England...

363
00:27:57,795 --> 00:27:59,422
from an unclean tyrant.

364
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:01,793
I believe you're talking treason.

365
00:28:02,032 --> 00:28:03,897
I hope I'm not obscure.

366
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,129
- You could be flogged for that.
- No.

367
00:28:06,971 --> 00:28:09,838
The Governor would never allow it.
He has the gout.

368
00:28:10,007 --> 00:28:11,531
You depend upon that?

369
00:28:11,709 --> 00:28:15,770
I intend to, for all it's worth,
and that promises to be considerable.

370
00:28:18,182 --> 00:28:21,948
But you'd hardly know about that.
You've probably never had the gout.

371
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:27,884
- Good afternoon, Miss Bishop.
- Good afternoon.

372
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:03,349
15-2, 15-4, and a pair are six.

373
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:06,121
- Another?
- What else is there to do...

374
00:29:06,197 --> 00:29:09,462
ever since you ruined the Governor's foot
and our reputations with it?

375
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:13,196
- I ruined the Governor's foot?
- I tell you, Doctor, you're methods are...

376
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,999
- Someone coming.
- A patient?

377
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:16,266
A patient!

378
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:22,478
- I beg your pardon, Doctor. I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.

379
00:29:27,117 --> 00:29:28,516
Come in.

380
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,087
Good afternoon, colleagues. Dr. Bronson.

381
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:37,155
- Dr. Whacker.
- Good afternoon.

382
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:39,626
How's business, my friends?

383
00:29:39,697 --> 00:29:40,721
- Terrible.
- Good.

384
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:43,266
- Terribly good.
- That relieves me.

385
00:29:43,434 --> 00:29:45,800
I had heard that things
were not altogether....

386
00:29:46,437 --> 00:29:48,371
ldle gossip, obviously.

387
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:50,902
You intend to remain here?

388
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:54,840
Remain here? Why not?

389
00:29:56,647 --> 00:29:58,114
It's queer.

390
00:29:58,282 --> 00:30:02,048
There are you, free to come and go as
you please, and you choose to stay here.

391
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:06,579
While I, who hate this pestilential island....
Such are the quirks of circumstance.

392
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:09,882
I must be running along, gentlemen.

393
00:30:10,494 --> 00:30:12,291
Good day, gentlemen.

394
00:30:14,331 --> 00:30:18,062
It's pleasant to see
everything so prosperous with you here.

395
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:21,034
- Not so hasty.
- Just a moment.

396
00:30:21,105 --> 00:30:23,869
There's something I'd like to ask you.

397
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,565
Well, gentlemen?

398
00:30:25,676 --> 00:30:28,304
Have you been thinking of leaving us,
Doctor?

399
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:31,913
Leaving? Now, Doctor.

400
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:34,150
How could a slave think of leaving?

401
00:30:34,218 --> 00:30:38,678
Or even if he were fool enough to try,
by what means could he hope to escape?

402
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:42,221
And where, for example,
could he raise the few pounds necessary...

403
00:30:42,293 --> 00:30:44,955
to purchase even a small boat?

404
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:48,089
- We might supply it.
- You?

405
00:30:48,732 --> 00:30:52,429
- Now, gentlemen.
- Now, let's talk this thing over.

406
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:55,837
Now, if you'll just sit down here.

407
00:30:55,973 --> 00:30:58,737
Now then, how much will you need?

408
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:02,575
£20 might buy a small wherry,
£10 more might equip it.

409
00:31:02,646 --> 00:31:04,113
He's right.

410
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:07,012
- He means...
- You needn't tell me what he means.

411
00:31:07,084 --> 00:31:10,178
I know two Christian gentlemen
when I see them.

412
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:14,818
Two men whose hearts are bleeding
for a brother doctor in distress.

413
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:19,922
But it's too much to ask,
too noble a gesture to hope for.

414
00:31:19,997 --> 00:31:22,522
No, my good man, not at all.

415
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,258
But who would buy the boat?

416
00:31:24,335 --> 00:31:27,827
We would not dare,
and you, a slave, you could not.

417
00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:28,927
True.

418
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:33,607
That would be my part. To find someone.
A man as eager to escape as I.

419
00:31:34,178 --> 00:31:37,614
- A man held here for debt, say.
- Then it's a bargain?

420
00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:42,550
Gentlemen,
you've opened for me the gates of hope.

421
00:31:44,655 --> 00:31:45,644
Doctor.

422
00:31:50,794 --> 00:31:53,058
- My dear colleague.
- Gentlemen.

423
00:31:58,235 --> 00:31:59,429
Now we have him.

424
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:02,529
We've only to get him involved
and reveal his plan.

425
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:05,871
He'll steal very little of our business
when he's in irons.

426
00:32:07,378 --> 00:32:08,743
Gentlemen.

427
00:32:10,814 --> 00:32:14,011
There's one thing slipped
my mind entirely.

428
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:18,878
Simple-minded men might think this
an opportunity for trickery...

429
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:23,059
but brilliant men like yourselves
will remember in what favor I stand...

430
00:32:23,127 --> 00:32:26,096
with the Governor
in contrast to some others...

431
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:29,462
and how little their words
would weigh against mine.

432
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:32,627
Heigh-ho for the Governor's foot!

433
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:34,364
Good day, gentlemen.

434
00:33:07,137 --> 00:33:09,230
- Are you all with me?
- Yes.

435
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:10,364
Listen.

436
00:33:10,441 --> 00:33:13,638
There's a man named Nuttall
who's in trouble with the Governor.

437
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,304
He's looking for a small boat
which he'll purchase...

438
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,847
on the night chosen for our escape.

439
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:19,473
- Escape?
- Quiet!

440
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:25,351
While he gathers stores and equipment,
we must be ready on the inside.

441
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:29,322
We might steal some sugarcane knives
and hack through the stockade walls.

442
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:30,860
Or dig our way under.

443
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:34,921
Once at sea, if we get there,
our troubles will have just begun.

444
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:37,057
If any of you want to withdraw,
now's the time.

445
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:38,567
- No.
- Not me.

446
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:42,538
You'll be a lubber crew, but I'll match
your hearts against any other.

447
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:45,769
We can thank our stars for Jeremy Pitt.
He was a ship's pilot.

448
00:33:45,843 --> 00:33:49,779
Here's one you won't have to teach.
Six years in King James' Navy.

449
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,010
- What?
- That's nothing. I was a blooming gunner.

450
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:56,608
- A gunner?
- In the King's Navy, too.

451
00:33:56,687 --> 00:33:58,746
I was always ashamed of it up to now.

452
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:00,716
We'll have a crew yet!

453
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:03,760
Any of you others
been keeping such secrets?

454
00:34:04,828 --> 00:34:06,386
Where's Baynes?

455
00:34:07,097 --> 00:34:10,464
- Where is he?
- He tried to escape today.

456
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,795
No! Caught?

457
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,272
- Branded?
- Yeah.

458
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:31,176
No!

459
00:34:35,459 --> 00:34:37,484
Why did you do it, Andy?

460
00:34:37,694 --> 00:34:40,094
I told you I'd try to get you out.

461
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:43,428
I couldn't stand it any longer.
I couldn't stand it.

462
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,231
I was going mad.
What do you think a man is made of?

463
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:49,465
How much do you think he can stand?

464
00:34:56,647 --> 00:35:01,016
"Watchman, what of the night?"
lsaiah 21:1 1.

465
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:24,471
Don't make the purchase
until well on in the evening.

466
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,099
That way there'll be less risk...

467
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:28,303
of anyone wondering where you came by
the money.

468
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:31,836
Lumme, Captain. it ain't too
late for us to change our minds.

469
00:35:31,915 --> 00:35:34,406
Stow the provisions away on board
as soon as it's dark.

470
00:35:34,484 --> 00:35:37,282
Then all you've got to do is sit down here
and wait for us.

471
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:39,948
Is that all?
Wait all alone in the blooming dark...

472
00:35:40,023 --> 00:35:42,583
waiting for someone to come along
and nab me.

473
00:35:42,859 --> 00:35:46,158
Nuttall, my lad,
there's just one other little thing.

474
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:50,791
Could you find me a good piece of timber
about so thick and so long?

475
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,093
Yes, I think so.

476
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:54,865
Then do so and lash it to your spine.
It needs stiffening.

477
00:35:54,938 --> 00:35:56,872
Courage. I'll join you at midnight.

478
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,680
How long does it take to feed
this pack of dogs?

479
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:16,157
It's a wonder we make a profit at all.
You don't drive them hard enough.

480
00:36:16,226 --> 00:36:18,057
Get them out of here!

481
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:33,731
I've just been with Nuttall at the boat.
It's tonight.

482
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:37,004
- At last!
- For heaven's sake, command yourself.

483
00:36:38,148 --> 00:36:40,810
- Tonight, Hagthorpe.
- Caution above everything.

484
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:43,375
He who goes slowly, goes safely.

485
00:36:45,255 --> 00:36:48,622
Remember, Jeremy,
you're the only navigator among us.

486
00:36:48,692 --> 00:36:50,990
Without you, there's no escape.

487
00:36:55,365 --> 00:36:56,889
Hello, Uncle!

488
00:36:56,967 --> 00:37:00,698
Riding again? What do you plan to see
riding always the same road?

489
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:04,639
You'd be surprised what interesting things
there are to see on this island...

490
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:06,266
if you only keep your eyes open.

491
00:37:06,343 --> 00:37:10,575
Today, for instance, I saw something
that you'd give 1,000 ducats to know.

492
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:16,048
Stores and equipment
are all stowed away onboard.

493
00:37:18,422 --> 00:37:20,617
We could use more food,
but there's no money left.

494
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:24,286
I'm not taking any chances
by asking our medical friends for more.

495
00:37:24,695 --> 00:37:27,129
I told Nuttall we'd get to the boat
by midnight.

496
00:37:28,131 --> 00:37:31,123
Jeremy, we must not fail tonight.

497
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:34,364
What the devil have you been up to?

498
00:37:34,438 --> 00:37:37,601
Tonight will be a fine night,
judging by the sky.

499
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:42,075
There you are, Pitt. Keep it covered up
and it should heal in a day or so.

500
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:47,142
Miss Bishop. You looking for me, sir?

501
00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:49,515
Yes. You, stop!

502
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:54,118
What's the matter? Why are you shaking?

503
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:56,882
Nothing. l....

504
00:38:00,297 --> 00:38:02,629
What's going on between you two?

505
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:06,093
Why, nothing. The man has a bad leg.

506
00:38:09,773 --> 00:38:12,298
I'll tend to you later.
Where have you been?

507
00:38:12,976 --> 00:38:15,069
I've been at my work,
attending to the Governor.

508
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:16,407
You lie.

509
00:38:16,747 --> 00:38:17,771
Do I?

510
00:38:17,848 --> 00:38:19,679
The Governor's had another attack of gout.

511
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,311
He's been screaming for you
like a wounded horse all the afternoon.

512
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,411
Then it appears
I was not with the Governor.

513
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:27,320
Then where have you been?

514
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,553
- Why, I've been at....
- He was with me, Uncle.

515
00:38:30,627 --> 00:38:31,616
What?

516
00:38:31,695 --> 00:38:35,563
Thank you for protecting my reputation,
Dr. Blood, but it was a useless gallantry.

517
00:38:35,632 --> 00:38:38,362
My uncle knows that I spend my time
with whomever I please.

518
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:41,336
You might choose your company
with better taste.

519
00:38:41,438 --> 00:38:44,532
His Excellency's waiting for you!
Here, Kent, lend him your horse.

520
00:38:44,608 --> 00:38:45,734
Yes, sir.

521
00:38:46,276 --> 00:38:49,006
Otherwise, the lout will be all night
getting there.

522
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,876
Will I be required there long, sir?

523
00:38:50,947 --> 00:38:53,973
You're afraid your work will interfere
with your social affairs?

524
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:57,918
If I get back late, before midnight,
could I get back into the stockade?

525
00:38:57,988 --> 00:39:01,082
Will you stay here talking all night?
Be off with you!

526
00:39:07,697 --> 00:39:09,688
Take him to the stockade!

527
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:11,930
Go on, get along in there.

528
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:21,438
If he talks, we're lost.

529
00:39:34,057 --> 00:39:35,217
Well?

530
00:39:36,827 --> 00:39:39,591
It seems that you're continually
doing me favors.

531
00:39:39,663 --> 00:39:41,790
- I don't know why.
- Neither do I.

532
00:39:41,865 --> 00:39:42,991
Yes, I do.

533
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:46,467
It's because you're so very grateful
and always thank me so prettily.

534
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,796
Sure now, you don't blame me
for resenting you and your favors.

535
00:39:49,873 --> 00:39:53,741
This is interesting. I've had men tell me
they had reasons for admiring me...

536
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,506
and some have even laid claims
to reasons for loving me...

537
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,983
but for a man to store up reasons
for resenting me, how refreshing.

538
00:40:01,484 --> 00:40:03,076
You must tell me a few of them.

539
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,644
The first is reason enough.
You bought me.

540
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:11,059
I've had no lack of experiences in my time,
but to be bought and sold was a new one.

541
00:40:11,127 --> 00:40:13,220
I was in no mood to thank my purchaser.

542
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:15,958
That I can understand. Go on.

543
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:18,458
I've resented you because your name
is Bishop.

544
00:40:18,535 --> 00:40:21,060
My thoughts have lumped you
with your uncle.

545
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:24,231
How was I to know
that a devil could have....

546
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:27,605
That a devil could have an angel
for a niece?

547
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:31,605
From a resentful man,
that is a pretty fair compliment.

548
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:35,712
Have you any more reasons
for resenting me like that one?

549
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:38,114
Indeed, I have. And the strongest of all...

550
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:42,986
I've resented you
because you're beautiful, and I'm a slave.

551
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,987
Do you understand that?

552
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:49,631
I don't know.

553
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,728
Perhaps if you were to
explain further, I....

554
00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:56,171
I've already talked too much.

555
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,202
I'll open your mouth!

556
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:10,944
You'll stay here
without food or water until you talk.

557
00:41:15,425 --> 00:41:18,588
- Why did you lie to your uncle?
- Because....

558
00:41:19,996 --> 00:41:22,624
Dr. Blood,
you're a physician and should know.

559
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:26,767
Is it not considered unhealthy
for a slave to be seen at a boat?

560
00:41:27,704 --> 00:41:30,798
- Why should it be?
- Boats put out to sea.

561
00:41:31,007 --> 00:41:32,599
Slaves may not.

562
00:41:34,311 --> 00:41:36,438
You're jumping to conclusions, aren't you?

563
00:41:36,513 --> 00:41:37,673
Am I?

564
00:41:38,148 --> 00:41:40,673
The Governor will be waiting for you.

565
00:41:41,718 --> 00:41:42,742
Yes.

566
00:41:44,054 --> 00:41:47,455
Miss Bishop, it's difficult
for an Irishman to apologize.

567
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:50,785
But I hope you can forgive me
for having thought badly of you.

568
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,351
I will, if you tell me
how you think of me now.

569
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,797
How I think of you now? I think of you....

570
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:02,169
I think of you as the woman who owns me.
Her slave.

571
00:42:03,473 --> 00:42:06,567
But I think the man is lucky
who can count you his friend.

572
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:08,543
I think you know you can.

573
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,184
Your slave is grateful
for all marks of favor.

574
00:42:20,256 --> 00:42:22,417
When you forget your slavery
and go so far...

575
00:42:22,492 --> 00:42:23,959
Now there, you're mistaken.

576
00:42:24,027 --> 00:42:26,723
However far this slave may go,
he won't forget.

577
00:42:28,498 --> 00:42:31,695
It's a characteristic we Irish
have in common with the elephants.

578
00:43:26,222 --> 00:43:28,417
Hello. Where are you going?

579
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:32,119
You're so much improved,
I was returning to the stockade.

580
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:35,255
Don't leave me tonight. I'm a sick man.

581
00:43:36,232 --> 00:43:38,427
I assure you, sir,
there's nothing more I can do.

582
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:40,196
There must be something.

583
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:42,898
Perhaps you ought to bleed me again.

584
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,567
Very well, then, if you wish it.

585
00:43:50,647 --> 00:43:52,945
But mind, no more softness about this.

586
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:56,913
I'm gonna have you well by midnight
if I have to bleed you to death.

587
00:44:11,935 --> 00:44:13,869
- Who goes there?
- Peter Blood.

588
00:44:26,483 --> 00:44:29,247
- Jeremy, what's happened?
- Water.

589
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,355
Easy, lad.

590
00:44:41,664 --> 00:44:43,791
I didn't tell him. I didn't.

591
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:48,268
- Tell him what, Jeremy?
- About our plans.

592
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,764
My back.

593
00:44:55,478 --> 00:44:57,173
Help me.

594
00:44:59,482 --> 00:45:01,643
- Who did this?
- Bishop.

595
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:04,987
Bishop. Swine!

596
00:45:05,054 --> 00:45:07,386
I didn't tell him. I didn't.

597
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:21,501
- ls our boat still standing in at the bay?
- Yes, Jeremy.

598
00:45:22,338 --> 00:45:24,738
I wondered if I was still out of my mind.

599
00:45:26,109 --> 00:45:29,909
I've been seeing boats
sailing in and out...

600
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:34,879
in and out, but ours will never sail.

601
00:45:35,885 --> 00:45:37,147
Not now.

602
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,948
Or if it does, you'll sail without me.

603
00:45:42,058 --> 00:45:45,892
What?
And get lost at sea without our navigator?

604
00:45:45,962 --> 00:45:49,762
- Nonsense, lad.
- We are not going this time.

605
00:45:50,533 --> 00:45:52,364
It's hopeless for all of us.

606
00:45:54,704 --> 00:45:56,365
We'll manage somehow.

607
00:46:05,081 --> 00:46:07,447
- What are you doing here?
- Doing?

608
00:46:08,451 --> 00:46:09,975
Why, the duties of my office.

609
00:46:10,053 --> 00:46:12,647
I said he was to have
no food nor drink till I ordered.

610
00:46:12,722 --> 00:46:14,952
Sure now, I never heard you.

611
00:46:15,024 --> 00:46:16,616
How could you? You weren't here.

612
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:19,560
Then how do you expect me
to know what orders you've given?

613
00:46:22,165 --> 00:46:25,657
In the name of humanity!
If you know the word.

614
00:46:25,935 --> 00:46:28,904
- You dare take that tone with me?
- Yes, I do!

615
00:46:30,573 --> 00:46:32,507
I've been too soft with you...

616
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:34,838
but that shall be mended.

617
00:46:35,144 --> 00:46:36,543
Kent, tie him up!

618
00:46:40,483 --> 00:46:43,281
Had it easy here up to now. Get up there.

619
00:46:55,498 --> 00:46:57,329
Now I'll take this rod to you...

620
00:46:57,433 --> 00:47:00,493
until there's not an inch of hide left
on your dirty carcass.

621
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:01,999
Another beating?

622
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:05,336
This will be a good half-dozen of them
you've given me in promise.

623
00:47:05,408 --> 00:47:07,706
This will be as real as it is overdue.

624
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:11,543
And what becomes of His Excellency
the Governor's gouty foot?

625
00:47:11,614 --> 00:47:15,675
You'll not save yourself with that device
this time. Nothing will save you.

626
00:47:20,556 --> 00:47:22,990
Pirates! Spanish pirates!

627
00:47:27,697 --> 00:47:30,188
This is what I call a timely interruption.

628
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:33,802
Though what will come of it,
the devil himself only knows.

629
00:50:02,385 --> 00:50:05,354
We've got to get through the town
to get to the boat.

630
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:07,111
Wait here, lads.

631
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,102
It's me. Mr. Nuttall.

632
00:50:59,175 --> 00:51:01,143
You came close to being
the ex-Mr. Nuttall.

633
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:03,678
Wouldn't be the first death I died today.

634
00:51:04,447 --> 00:51:07,041
We can't stay here waiting for them
to catch sight of us.

635
00:51:07,116 --> 00:51:08,674
Let's get to the boat down this way.

636
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:35,636
Sunk to the bottom of the briny.

637
00:51:36,145 --> 00:51:38,613
And it sunk our hopes with it.

638
00:51:40,182 --> 00:51:42,742
- Perhaps not.
- What do you mean, Peter?

639
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:48,350
- He's gonna take a bath?
- Yes, but not for cleanliness.

640
00:51:48,691 --> 00:51:51,922
Since the Spaniards have been
thoughtless enough to sink our craft...

641
00:51:51,994 --> 00:51:55,157
I'll see if I can't persuade them
to lend us one of theirs.

642
00:53:57,653 --> 00:54:02,113
Your Excellency,
facts are so often dull and deplorable.

643
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:04,858
Nevertheless, at the risk of boring you...

644
00:54:04,927 --> 00:54:09,023
it is my painful duty to inform you
that 250 of my men...

645
00:54:09,098 --> 00:54:12,499
are now complete masters
of the town of Port Royal.

646
00:54:12,868 --> 00:54:15,769
Your most worthy islanders
have been disarmed...

647
00:54:16,072 --> 00:54:18,939
and your city is now
absolutely in the hands...

648
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:22,705
of the forces of His Majesty
King Philip of Spain.

649
00:54:23,212 --> 00:54:26,181
Now that you have our city,
what do you want with it?

650
00:54:26,382 --> 00:54:29,408
For a price,
I could forebear reducing it to ashes.

651
00:54:30,252 --> 00:54:34,313
- What price?
- 200,000 pieces of eight.

652
00:54:35,624 --> 00:54:38,115
200,000 pieces of eight?

653
00:55:35,684 --> 00:55:38,209
That's why we waited till this morning
to put to sea.

654
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:41,950
We've a message for those Spaniards.
They are on their way now to receive it.

655
00:55:42,024 --> 00:55:44,652
- Hagthorpe, man the guns!
- Clear deck!

656
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:55,232
- All ready, Hagthorpe?
- Aye, Peter, ready.

657
00:55:55,304 --> 00:55:57,864
Give them a taste of their own iron!

658
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,575
You've done it, Hagthorpe!

659
00:56:44,153 --> 00:56:45,552
Hurrah!

660
00:56:49,925 --> 00:56:51,654
Didn't I tell you I was a gunner, sir?

661
00:56:51,727 --> 00:56:54,525
You did that,
you son of a Yorkshire steer...

662
00:56:54,597 --> 00:56:57,498
and bless your rusty heart,
it's a gunner you are!

663
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,628
It's the Governor.

664
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,909
It must be that some brave party
of citizens captured the ship.

665
00:57:07,977 --> 00:57:09,501
I think you're right.

666
00:57:18,621 --> 00:57:21,215
Someone should go aboard
and congratulate them.

667
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:23,485
Yes. My foot.

668
00:57:23,726 --> 00:57:27,287
Since your gout so unhappily
prevents you, allow me to be the one.

669
00:57:27,363 --> 00:57:30,332
Go ahead. You've always wanted
to be governor anyway.

670
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:31,959
Don't be nervous.

671
00:57:32,034 --> 00:57:33,831
- Man those sweeps.
- Aye, sir.

672
00:57:39,508 --> 00:57:42,341
- Shall we hoist anchor, Peter?
- Aye. Get under way.

673
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,172
There's another boat approaching.

674
00:57:52,655 --> 00:57:54,885
It looks like Col. Bishop.

675
00:57:55,457 --> 00:57:57,015
- Who?
- Bishop.

676
00:57:57,092 --> 00:57:59,424
The fool would come blundering
in just now.

677
00:57:59,495 --> 00:58:03,261
- I'll make short work of him.
- No, Hagthorpe, none of that.

678
00:58:26,288 --> 00:58:29,280
But.... Who....

679
00:58:43,339 --> 00:58:46,467
Welcome aboard the <i>Cinco Lagos,</i>
Colonel darling.

680
00:58:47,076 --> 00:58:48,566
You? Was it....

681
00:58:49,178 --> 00:58:53,808
Peter Blood, was it you, then, who took
this ship and turned defeat into victory?

682
00:58:53,882 --> 00:58:57,978
Myself it was. Myself and these,
my friends. And your friends.

683
00:59:00,356 --> 00:59:02,415
And you saved my money, too!

684
00:59:08,764 --> 00:59:11,995
- Yes, it was heroic.
- Heroic, is it?

685
00:59:12,067 --> 00:59:14,035
It was epic.

686
00:59:14,436 --> 00:59:15,562
You amaze me.

687
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:18,697
On my soul, you deserve well.
You all deserve well.

688
00:59:18,874 --> 00:59:21,866
- You shall find me grateful.
- How grateful?

689
00:59:22,411 --> 00:59:26,279
I shall ask His Excellency to write home
to the King an account of your exploit.

690
00:59:26,348 --> 00:59:28,680
Perhaps some of your sentencing
shall be remitted.

691
00:59:28,751 --> 00:59:30,946
That's just about
what we expected from you.

692
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:34,148
Now, Wolf, Col. Bishop has a kind heart.

693
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:36,483
- But what kind, I'd hate to say.
- What is this?

694
00:59:36,558 --> 00:59:40,460
Why, Colonel darling,
such unusual generosity from you...

695
00:59:40,529 --> 00:59:42,690
must be making you feel unwell.

696
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:46,232
- As your physician, I'd prescribe...
- A bit of neck-stretching.

697
00:59:51,774 --> 00:59:54,766
Lads, we shouldn't hang this man.

698
00:59:54,843 --> 00:59:56,640
- No?
- No.

699
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:08,053
Tie him over the end of a gun!

700
01:00:08,123 --> 01:00:10,591
I'll scatter his innards
all over the sugarcane field.

701
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:12,889
You're wasting words, I say. Hang him!

702
01:00:19,501 --> 01:00:23,904
Wait, lads. Hanging's
too dignified for him.

703
01:00:24,106 --> 01:00:25,664
Can you swim, Colonel darling?

704
01:00:25,741 --> 01:00:29,438
We're giving you the chance to cool off
some of that excessive heat of yours.

705
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:31,638
Over the side with him, men!

706
01:00:39,822 --> 01:00:43,349
One, two...

707
01:00:43,959 --> 01:00:45,449
three!

708
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:54,801
Peter Blood, I'll make you pay for this...

709
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:57,498
if I spend the rest of my life doing it!

710
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,901
And then the whale came,
and the whale swallowed Jonah. I hope.

711
01:01:03,045 --> 01:01:05,411
Goodbye, Jonah. Don't forget to write.

712
01:01:09,985 --> 01:01:11,885
What's the next move, Peter?

713
01:01:12,054 --> 01:01:15,421
Up anchor! Wolf, man the capstan bar.

714
01:01:15,624 --> 01:01:20,994
Hagthorpe, get the sails aloft.
Thomas, get those men over here.

715
01:01:26,568 --> 01:01:30,334
Round you go, men!
That's no water wheel you're working.

716
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,839
- Can you handle it, Jeremy?
- Aye, aye, Peter.

717
01:01:40,916 --> 01:01:42,781
We sail. Hard to starboard.

718
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:49,284
Up that rigging, you monkeys, aloft!
There's no chains to hold you now!

719
01:01:52,194 --> 01:01:53,593
Break out those sails...

720
01:01:53,662 --> 01:01:57,189
and watch them fill with the wind
that's carrying us all to freedom.

721
01:02:53,388 --> 01:02:54,980
We, the undersigned...

722
01:02:57,726 --> 01:02:59,557
are men without a country...

723
01:03:01,063 --> 01:03:04,362
outlaws in our own land,
and homeless outcasts in any other.

724
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,098
Desperate men,
we go to seek a desperate fortune.

725
01:03:13,175 --> 01:03:15,837
Therefore, we do here and now
band ourselves...

726
01:03:15,911 --> 01:03:17,776
into a brotherhood of buccaneers...

727
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,978
to practice the trade of piracy
on the high seas.

728
01:03:21,283 --> 01:03:24,013
We, the hunted, will now hunt!

729
01:03:26,188 --> 01:03:29,282
To that end, we enter into
the following articles of agreement.

730
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:30,450
First...

731
01:03:32,995 --> 01:03:36,089
we pledge ourselves
to be bound together as brothers...

732
01:03:36,665 --> 01:03:38,758
in a life-and-death friendship...

733
01:03:39,334 --> 01:03:41,894
sharing alike in fortune and in trouble.

734
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:45,767
Second article.

735
01:03:47,273 --> 01:03:50,674
All moneys and valuables
which may come into our possession...

736
01:03:51,243 --> 01:03:53,871
shall be lumped together
into a common fund...

737
01:03:54,346 --> 01:03:56,780
and from this fund
shall first be taken the money...

738
01:03:56,849 --> 01:03:59,044
to fit, rig, and provision the ship.

739
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:04,483
After that, the recompense each
will receive who is wounded as follows:

740
01:04:05,825 --> 01:04:09,625
For the loss of a right arm,
600 pieces of eight.

741
01:04:10,663 --> 01:04:13,029
Left arm, 500.

742
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:16,597
For the loss of a right leg, 500.

743
01:04:17,002 --> 01:04:19,334
Left leg, 400.

744
01:04:19,972 --> 01:04:21,997
A fellow can get rich if he's lucky.

745
01:04:22,141 --> 01:04:23,369
Greedy.

746
01:04:25,211 --> 01:04:27,338
If a man conceal any treasure captured...

747
01:04:27,413 --> 01:04:30,849
or fail to place it in the general fund,
he shall be marooned.

748
01:04:31,484 --> 01:04:33,145
Set ashore on a deserted isle...

749
01:04:33,219 --> 01:04:36,017
and there left with a bottle of water,
a loaf of bread...

750
01:04:36,288 --> 01:04:38,085
and a pistol with one load.

751
01:04:39,225 --> 01:04:42,524
If a man shall be drunk on duty,
he shall receive the same fate.

752
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:47,228
And if a man shall molest
a woman captive against her will...

753
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:50,362
he, too,
shall receive the same punishment.

754
01:04:52,104 --> 01:04:56,734
These articles entered into,
this 20th day of June, in the year 1687.

755
01:05:00,379 --> 01:05:02,813
Now, men, you've heard the agreement.

756
01:05:03,215 --> 01:05:06,275
It's the world against us
and us against the world.

757
01:05:06,752 --> 01:05:11,155
"His hand will be against every man,
and every man's hand against him."

758
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,788
Genesis 16:12.

759
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:19,457
Those of you in favor of these articles,
raise your right hands and say aye!

760
01:05:19,932 --> 01:05:21,229
Aye!

761
01:06:27,299 --> 01:06:29,062
Blood!

762
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:32,966
This impertinent,
ungoverned rascal must be eradicated.

763
01:06:33,305 --> 01:06:34,602
Yes, Your Majesty.

764
01:06:34,673 --> 01:06:37,574
Sinking Spanish ships
causes me enough embarrassment...

765
01:06:37,643 --> 01:06:40,703
- but he sinks English ships as well.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

766
01:06:40,779 --> 01:06:42,576
Cannot Gov. Steed do something about it?

767
01:06:42,648 --> 01:06:45,344
He does his best,
but conditions on the island...

768
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:49,353
Silence, Willoughby! I'm not interested
in anything you have to say.

769
01:06:50,155 --> 01:06:52,282
I know your feelings towards me.

770
01:06:54,026 --> 01:06:57,689
Sunderland, what are you Secretary
of State for? Have you no solution?

771
01:06:57,763 --> 01:07:01,358
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Get your head off that hinge. Speak up.

772
01:07:01,433 --> 01:07:05,267
Since Gov. Steed is incapable,
you should appoint a stronger man.

773
01:07:05,371 --> 01:07:06,463
Who?

774
01:07:06,538 --> 01:07:09,598
Col. Bishop assures me
that if he were in power...

775
01:07:09,742 --> 01:07:11,539
he would not rest day or night...

776
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:15,512
until this Capt. Blood
was swinging on execution dock.

777
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:17,939
Angling for the office, is he?

778
01:07:18,083 --> 01:07:21,348
What difference
if he's the iron man we need?

779
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,984
Draw up the appointment.

780
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,787
I've already taken the liberty of doing so,
Your Majesty.

781
01:07:49,214 --> 01:07:52,240
Mrs. Steed, Mr. Steed,
I wish you both a pleasant journey.

782
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,345
I thank you, Governor.
Again, congratulations, Gov. Bishop.

783
01:07:56,722 --> 01:08:00,453
- May your term of office be successful.
- Thank you, my friend.

784
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,957
Arabella dear,
have a nice holiday in England.

785
01:08:03,028 --> 01:08:04,359
I'm sure I shall.

786
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:05,419
- Captain.
- Yes, sir.

787
01:08:05,497 --> 01:08:07,965
- Keep a weather eye open for pirates.
- Very well, sir.

788
01:08:08,033 --> 01:08:11,525
Before you return, Arabella,
I shall have the sea swept clean of them.

789
01:08:11,603 --> 01:08:14,595
Particularly one.
I think you know whom I mean.

790
01:08:18,243 --> 01:08:21,542
I hope he gets the gout
the infernal office gave me.

791
01:08:21,947 --> 01:08:25,212
Come along. Goodbye.

792
01:08:34,126 --> 01:08:37,095
Thomas Fulton. One share, no injuries.

793
01:08:38,464 --> 01:08:42,833
James Graham. One share,
plus 100 pieces of eight for a pike wound.

794
01:08:43,836 --> 01:08:47,932
Zachary Stevens.
For bravery at the battle of Maracaibo...

795
01:08:48,007 --> 01:08:50,202
one share, plus £10 of silver.

796
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:57,514
Oliver Clark. One share, plus 400 pieces
of eight for the loss of his left leg.

797
01:08:57,583 --> 01:08:59,517
There you are, Oliver, I'm proud of you.

798
01:08:59,752 --> 01:09:04,451
Lord Chester Dyke.
No injury, one share and £5 of silver.

799
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,517
Anton Brazilimo.

800
01:09:08,761 --> 01:09:09,989
Andrew Fell.

801
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:14,658
One share, plus 500 pieces of eight
for the loss of his left arm.

802
01:09:15,134 --> 01:09:17,329
There you are, Andrew, and good luck.

803
01:09:17,803 --> 01:09:20,670
David Sampson. One share, no injuries.

804
01:09:23,642 --> 01:09:27,806
Honesty Nuttall. No injuries, one share.

805
01:09:29,381 --> 01:09:30,746
Hold on, Captain.

806
01:09:30,816 --> 01:09:34,343
How about me little toe,
heroically sacrificed in battle?

807
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:38,356
Honesty Nuttall. One share, and nothing
for the toe he just shot off himself.

808
01:09:41,827 --> 01:09:43,317
You stupid numskull.

809
01:09:43,395 --> 01:09:47,388
You should have shot out your brains
and left your toe for thinking with.

810
01:09:57,509 --> 01:09:59,238
Ahoy, the deck!

811
01:09:59,545 --> 01:10:02,207
An English ship on the port bow!

812
01:10:13,992 --> 01:10:15,289
So it is.

813
01:10:15,394 --> 01:10:18,921
A fine big ship, too,
as far as I can judge from this distance.

814
01:10:19,598 --> 01:10:21,532
Shall we sail over
and give them a surprise?

815
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,624
No, Peter.

816
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:24,566
The men are set on putting in at Tortuga.

817
01:10:24,636 --> 01:10:26,604
Their gold's burning
holes in their pockets.

818
01:10:26,672 --> 01:10:29,038
What's one ship more or less to us now?

819
01:10:29,241 --> 01:10:31,641
It appears I have a mutiny on my hands.

820
01:10:46,558 --> 01:10:50,426
What ho, the deck! A ship to starboard!

821
01:10:53,799 --> 01:10:55,562
It may be a pirate!

822
01:11:07,779 --> 01:11:11,738
Very well, then.
Sail on, little ship, back to England...

823
01:11:12,985 --> 01:11:14,714
where we may never go.

824
01:11:16,054 --> 01:11:19,285
You'll never know
how close you came to not getting there.

825
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,198
Your turn, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

826
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:34,254
Up!

827
01:12:36,969 --> 01:12:38,561
<i>It's your turn now.</i>

828
01:12:43,175 --> 01:12:44,767
<i>Again, my captain.</i>

829
01:12:46,345 --> 01:12:47,812
<i>- Are you ready?</i>
- Right.

830
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,370
<i>It's good.</i>

831
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:52,345
This time, my friend, huh?

832
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:57,152
<i>- You missed.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

833
01:12:57,556 --> 01:13:00,423
I am defeated.
You win the prize, Capt. Blood.

834
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:03,124
<i>- Goodbye, my dear.</i>
<i>- Goodbye.</i>

835
01:13:04,563 --> 01:13:06,258
<i>What a charming captain.</i>

836
01:13:06,932 --> 01:13:08,866
Some other time, perhaps.

837
01:13:08,934 --> 01:13:10,401
<i>Why?</i>

838
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,596
What sort of a man are you?

839
01:13:13,071 --> 01:13:16,666
I'm the sort of man you like, my dear.
A man with money.

840
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,607
<i>The money!</i>

841
01:13:31,723 --> 01:13:34,817
<i>Mon capitaine,</i>
what a pair we would make.

842
01:13:34,893 --> 01:13:38,590
In all the Caribbean,
there is no buccaneer so strong as me.

843
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:39,822
Except you.

844
01:13:39,931 --> 01:13:42,058
You almost flatter me, Levasseur.

845
01:13:42,134 --> 01:13:45,934
Why do you hold off your consent so long?
We become partners.

846
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:48,564
You've been in Tortuga
these three, four months.

847
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:51,334
You must be even so much
in need of gold as I.

848
01:13:52,244 --> 01:13:54,678
Such a partnership requires sober thought.

849
01:13:54,746 --> 01:13:58,011
My poor head has been dancing with rum
this whole week past.

850
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:01,310
Even so drunk, your brain is the greatest
this side the Caribbean.

851
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:04,822
With your brain and my strength,
there is nothing we cannot do.

852
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:08,419
There's very little I
can't do all by myself.

853
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:20,495
<i>Long live Capt. Levasseur!</i>

854
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:24,106
And here's to Capt. Blood!

855
01:14:24,176 --> 01:14:25,165
Hurrah!

856
01:14:32,818 --> 01:14:36,049
<i>Then, it's a good dinner guest, my friend.</i>

857
01:14:36,321 --> 01:14:38,687
- You're next, Peter.
<i>- Mon capitaine.</i>

858
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:43,321
It's clearly understood, then,
that we sail under my articles.

859
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:46,091
Those very severe articles of yours?

860
01:14:46,164 --> 01:14:48,962
<i>Mais oui,</i> I sail under the articles
of a girls' <i>séminaire...</i>

861
01:14:49,034 --> 01:14:52,128
to have you as my partner, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

862
01:14:57,776 --> 01:15:00,404
Women will be the death of you yet,
Levasseur.

863
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:04,715
It is a very pleasant way to die,
even if it is expensive.

864
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:09,251
What is the first order,
<i>mon capitaine</i> partner?

865
01:15:09,454 --> 01:15:12,218
We sail on the tide.
Outside the harbor, we'll scatter.

866
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:16,386
Each ship will proceed singly to pick up
any stray ships we'll find on the journey.

867
01:15:16,461 --> 01:15:18,486
We'll meet at the island of Virgen Magra.

868
01:15:18,563 --> 01:15:19,791
<i>Magnifique!</i>

869
01:15:19,865 --> 01:15:22,595
I give you the toast. To our great success!

870
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:25,898
Let me give one.
To the greatest captain on the Caribbean!

871
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:29,304
<i>- Oui!</i> To <i>Capitaine Levasseur!</i>
- Capt. Blood.

872
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,299
Bravo!

873
01:15:31,376 --> 01:15:34,607
The articles aside,
let's give a toast to Capt. Blood.

874
01:15:36,081 --> 01:15:37,605
<i>Capitaine Levasseur.</i>

875
01:15:37,682 --> 01:15:39,946
To the greatest captain on the coast.

876
01:15:44,923 --> 01:15:47,391
The greatest captain on the coast, is it?

877
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:52,188
Methinks the greatest captain
on the coast...

878
01:15:52,597 --> 01:15:54,360
has just made the greatest mistake...

879
01:15:54,433 --> 01:15:57,095
the most ordinary common fool
could make.

880
01:16:12,584 --> 01:16:16,452
It's been so lovely. I'd like to stay forever.
You've all been so kind.

881
01:16:17,055 --> 01:16:19,114
Come again and visit us soon, dear.

882
01:16:19,624 --> 01:16:22,616
England is so much more beautiful
when you're here.

883
01:16:22,794 --> 01:16:25,319
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

884
01:16:25,797 --> 01:16:28,960
- Thank you for everything.
- Goodbye, dear.

885
01:16:29,034 --> 01:16:31,161
- Goodbye, Amelia.
- Goodbye, Mary.

886
01:16:46,384 --> 01:16:50,616
However else the court may have changed,
the art of flattery still flourishes.

887
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,316
Stab me if it's flattery.

888
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:56,417
When the King ordered me on this journey
as a special emissary to the West Indies...

889
01:16:56,495 --> 01:16:59,692
I looked forward with some trepidation
to a life among the savages.

890
01:16:59,764 --> 01:17:02,164
But when I found
you were one of those savages...

891
01:17:02,234 --> 01:17:06,170
returning to your native heath,
my grateful eyes could hardly believe it.

892
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,666
You pictured us running around
in animal skins, eating raw meat?

893
01:17:11,743 --> 01:17:14,439
Why not, in a country filled
with Indians and pirates?

894
01:17:14,513 --> 01:17:19,314
Speaking of pirates, did you ever happen
to hear of a wild rogue named Blood?

895
01:17:19,518 --> 01:17:20,951
- Peter Blood?
- Yes.

896
01:17:22,187 --> 01:17:24,348
No. I don't know him.

897
01:17:24,923 --> 01:17:27,414
I hardly number pirates
among my acquaintances.

898
01:17:27,492 --> 01:17:30,359
Of course not. Stupid of me.
I merely mention him in passing.

899
01:17:30,428 --> 01:17:32,760
Because he's one of the objects
of my mission.

900
01:17:32,831 --> 01:17:33,855
- Your mission?
- Yes.

901
01:17:33,932 --> 01:17:37,095
I've been sent to try to blot out
all this piracy, my dear.

902
01:17:37,168 --> 01:17:40,865
And in a manner
I must keep secret till I find Capt. Blood.

903
01:17:44,175 --> 01:17:46,666
Ship on the port side, sir!

904
01:17:50,181 --> 01:17:52,615
Yes, that's a fine ship.

905
01:17:56,087 --> 01:17:59,818
- Captain, what ship is that?
- I don't know, Lord Willoughby.

906
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:03,922
She flies the French flag.
She could be anything in these waters.

907
01:18:04,663 --> 01:18:07,894
- We're in pirate waters now, aren't we?
- Yes, we are.

908
01:18:08,233 --> 01:18:12,499
Yonder bank of low clouds
is the island of Virgen Magra.

909
01:18:12,971 --> 01:18:14,836
- Exciting, isn't it?
- Very.

910
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,873
Could she be a pirate ship, by any chance?

911
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:21,106
Any ship we meet in the Caribbean
could be a pirate ship.

912
01:18:27,419 --> 01:18:31,446
Ahoy, English ship off port side!

913
01:18:31,523 --> 01:18:33,923
Prepare to come onto starboard tack!

914
01:18:33,992 --> 01:18:35,687
Starboard tack it is!

915
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:36,954
Steady at the helm!

916
01:18:38,697 --> 01:18:39,994
Ready?

917
01:18:40,065 --> 01:18:41,555
Stand by your guns.

918
01:18:47,672 --> 01:18:49,333
<i>What luck.</i>

919
01:18:49,507 --> 01:18:53,443
Just as I'm about to give up and anchor
to wait for my partner, Capt. Blood...

920
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:56,207
this fine English prize
walks into my parlor and says:

921
01:18:56,281 --> 01:18:58,545
<i>"Hello, Capt. Levasseur. "</i>

922
01:18:58,617 --> 01:19:02,246
- We've got to give welcome, Cahusac.
<i>- Yes, and how.</i> Light it!

923
01:19:31,316 --> 01:19:34,649
The ransom for you two is fixed at
20,000 pieces of eight.

924
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:36,186
I shall provide a boat for you...

925
01:19:36,254 --> 01:19:39,189
to go to Gov. Bishop at Jamaica
to collect it.

926
01:19:40,225 --> 01:19:44,127
Meanwhile, <i>mademoiselle</i> remains
with me as hostage.

927
01:19:44,429 --> 01:19:47,262
I find it very lonely on this island.

928
01:19:48,099 --> 01:19:51,296
I refuse absolutely and utterly!

929
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:54,805
You know this? It is the rosary of pain.

930
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:58,969
It is possible to screw a man's eyes
out of his head.

931
01:19:59,844 --> 01:20:02,278
Very well. Do your worst.

932
01:20:02,847 --> 01:20:03,836
<i>Alors!</i>

933
01:20:04,983 --> 01:20:06,143
No, stop!

934
01:20:06,217 --> 01:20:09,015
Lord Willoughby, thank you,
but don't be foolish.

935
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:11,082
<i>Mademoiselle</i> is right.

936
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:13,157
<i>Thank you, miss.</i>

937
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:16,554
I beg you to spare yourself
and the young lady.

938
01:20:16,628 --> 01:20:18,596
You know,
I've been too modest with you...

939
01:20:18,663 --> 01:20:21,564
but since I have said
20,000 pieces of eight...

940
01:20:21,633 --> 01:20:24,864
<i>eh bien,</i> I have said
20,000 pieces of eight.

941
01:20:24,936 --> 01:20:28,269
For what, if you please,
have you said 20,000 pieces of eight?

942
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:34,904
If it ain't the niece
of our old friend Col. Bishop.

943
01:20:35,447 --> 01:20:37,608
You don't recognize her. Mind that.

944
01:20:39,451 --> 01:20:40,748
What does he mean?

945
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:42,753
Your guess is as good as mine.

946
01:20:52,964 --> 01:20:55,899
- Good morning, Levasseur.
<i>- Hello, Captain.</i>

947
01:20:55,967 --> 01:20:57,491
- Cahusac.
<i>- Capitaine.</i>

948
01:20:57,902 --> 01:21:01,497
I arrived late last night and put
into a cove a few miles to the west.

949
01:21:01,573 --> 01:21:04,633
We've walked across
to give you good morning, but, faith...

950
01:21:04,709 --> 01:21:07,872
it seems we've interrupted
some business of yours.

951
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:10,107
- Who are these people?
<i>- Oh, yes, here.</i>

952
01:21:10,181 --> 01:21:13,082
As you see, two prisoners.
I captured an English ship.

953
01:21:13,151 --> 01:21:15,483
Yes. We saw her coming across the spit.

954
01:21:15,553 --> 01:21:19,080
I must congratulate you, Levasseur.
I didn't so much as sight a sail.

955
01:21:19,224 --> 01:21:21,658
The fortunes of war, my partner.

956
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,091
And these are also the fortunes of war?

957
01:21:24,162 --> 01:21:27,256
Big fortunes. A nobleman and the niece
of the Governor of Jamaica.

958
01:21:27,332 --> 01:21:28,356
Really?

959
01:21:28,433 --> 01:21:30,628
I suppose congratulations
are again in order...

960
01:21:30,702 --> 01:21:33,535
but have you forgotten there's an article
in our agreement...

961
01:21:33,605 --> 01:21:35,470
forbidding the taking of women prisoners?

962
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:38,270
That's a foolish article of yours.

963
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:41,741
I was not aware you regarded it so
when we signed.

964
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:45,340
Would you care to dispute
my opinion now, your men against mine?

965
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:51,619
Not this morning, thank you.
As you say, a foolish article.

966
01:21:51,689 --> 01:21:53,122
<i>Heard, my friend.</i>

967
01:21:53,191 --> 01:21:56,718
That is why these are prisoners
of my own, a matter personal.

968
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:59,259
- And the 20,000 pieces of eight?
- Their ransom.

969
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:02,094
- That is also a personal matter?
- It is.

970
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:05,758
Obviously, these two prisoners,
and particularly the young lady...

971
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:09,898
must be kept in someone's hands for,
shall we say, safekeeping...

972
01:22:09,974 --> 01:22:11,669
but why your hands?

973
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:14,601
Why shouldn't Pierre have her,
or Roch, or Jacob...

974
01:22:14,913 --> 01:22:17,438
since she's as much their property
as yours?

975
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:21,717
Or doesn't that please you?
You'd like to keep her for yourself.

976
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:25,781
And who might that be, do you suppose?

977
01:22:25,857 --> 01:22:29,293
- That is your Capt. Blood.
- Capt. Blood?

978
01:22:30,495 --> 01:22:31,519
Now, my captain...

979
01:22:31,596 --> 01:22:34,793
since you covet our joint property
of war, you may have her...

980
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:37,027
providing you're willing to buy her.

981
01:22:37,101 --> 01:22:39,763
- Buy her?
- At the price you yourself have put on her.

982
01:22:39,838 --> 01:22:41,533
20,000 pieces of eight.

983
01:22:41,606 --> 01:22:44,040
The ransom is to be paid by Gov. Bishop.

984
01:22:44,108 --> 01:22:45,973
It is for division when it comes.

985
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:49,013
But if the Governor should refuse to pay
the ransom, what then?

986
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:52,538
No. If you're to keep the girl meanwhile,
pay the ransom.

987
01:22:52,817 --> 01:22:55,285
Let it be your risk to collect it
from the Governor.

988
01:22:55,353 --> 01:22:57,014
Capt. Blood is right.

989
01:22:57,088 --> 01:23:00,717
- lt's in the articles.
- What's in the articles, you fools?

990
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:04,023
Where do you suppose
I have 20,000 pieces of eight?

991
01:23:04,095 --> 01:23:06,029
- Let someone buy her who has.
- Who?

992
01:23:06,097 --> 01:23:07,394
- l.
- You?

993
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,691
Jeremy, Wolf, bring the prisoners forward.

994
01:23:17,876 --> 01:23:19,400
Here they are, Peter.

995
01:23:20,945 --> 01:23:23,880
I bid 20,000 pieces of eight.

996
01:23:24,182 --> 01:23:26,343
Can you improve on that, Levasseur?

997
01:23:27,151 --> 01:23:29,210
I don't wish to be bought by you.

998
01:23:33,625 --> 01:23:36,059
As a lady once said to a slave...

999
01:23:36,127 --> 01:23:39,528
you are hardly in a position
to have anything to say about it.

1000
01:23:42,901 --> 01:23:45,995
- You want the girl?
- Why not?

1001
01:23:46,404 --> 01:23:48,770
And I'm willing to pay for what I want.

1002
01:23:49,807 --> 01:23:52,799
Cahusac, you boast a knowledge of pearls.

1003
01:23:54,846 --> 01:23:57,007
At what do you value each of those?

1004
01:24:01,219 --> 01:24:03,346
1,000 pieces each.

1005
01:24:03,421 --> 01:24:07,221
They're worth rather more, but very well.
Here are 12.

1006
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:11,285
The three-fifths the value of the prize
due your ship for having made the capture.

1007
01:24:11,362 --> 01:24:14,695
For the share due my men,
I make myself responsible.

1008
01:24:27,545 --> 01:24:31,140
Now, Wolf, will you be so kind
as to take my property aboard ship?

1009
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:35,180
And that settles that, my captain partner.

1010
01:24:36,854 --> 01:24:39,584
- No, you don't!
- Stop, <i>Capitaine!</i>

1011
01:24:41,092 --> 01:24:43,822
Wait! You'll not take her while I live!

1012
01:24:43,895 --> 01:24:46,090
Then I'll take her when you're dead!

1013
01:24:47,865 --> 01:24:51,528
<i>- Capitaine,</i> it has been honorably settled.
- It has not been settled for me!

1014
01:24:51,602 --> 01:24:54,833
What is a girl, more or less?
Do not be a fool, <i>Capitaine!</i>

1015
01:24:54,906 --> 01:24:56,373
<i>It's my business.</i>

1016
01:25:02,313 --> 01:25:06,113
Two breaches in our articles committed
by you. You should be marooned.

1017
01:25:06,985 --> 01:25:09,681
It's what I intended for you in the end...

1018
01:25:09,754 --> 01:25:14,123
but since you prefer it this way,
you muckrake, I'll be humoring you.

1019
01:26:23,661 --> 01:26:24,719
Up!

1020
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:28,088
And that, my friend, ends a partnership
that should never have begun.

1021
01:27:55,386 --> 01:27:58,014
All these things I've gathered
in my journeys.

1022
01:27:59,924 --> 01:28:03,382
I've gone far since I was a slave
on your uncle's plantation...

1023
01:28:04,095 --> 01:28:06,563
thousands of restless, hectic miles.

1024
01:28:07,131 --> 01:28:09,998
But somehow tonight,
I've got a strange feeling...

1025
01:28:10,067 --> 01:28:12,058
that my journey's almost over.

1026
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,131
You see these ankle rings?

1027
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:18,903
They came from a ship
that was out from Persia.

1028
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:21,341
And these pearls...

1029
01:28:21,646 --> 01:28:24,706
they're the choice from a fleet
we captured off the Azores.

1030
01:28:24,815 --> 01:28:27,875
- Have you ever seen such pearls?
- Yes, I have.

1031
01:28:28,186 --> 01:28:32,350
They're like the pearls you sometimes
use for making purchases, are they not?

1032
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:38,385
- Yes, they are.
- How many lives did they cost?

1033
01:28:39,697 --> 01:28:42,291
As few as possible.
It wasn't lives I was after.

1034
01:28:42,366 --> 01:28:44,732
- What, then?
- I never quite knew.

1035
01:28:45,136 --> 01:28:49,129
Some urge that drove me on.
Revenge, I suppose.

1036
01:28:50,074 --> 01:28:52,133
But I've had my fill of revenge.

1037
01:28:53,211 --> 01:28:56,374
I often wondered
why I bothered to save all these things.

1038
01:28:56,781 --> 01:28:58,715
Tonight I know it's because...

1039
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:02,018
one day you'd be here in this cabin
to wear them.

1040
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:03,485
I'll never wear them, never!

1041
01:29:03,554 --> 01:29:06,523
Those nor any other plunder gotten
by a thief and pirate.

1042
01:29:07,625 --> 01:29:09,092
Thief and pirate.

1043
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:10,959
I've seen your pirate ways.

1044
01:29:11,028 --> 01:29:13,121
I've seen myself bargained for
and fought over.

1045
01:29:13,197 --> 01:29:14,926
A combat between jackals.

1046
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,765
But I thought you understood.

1047
01:29:17,835 --> 01:29:19,530
You mean you thought you'd bought me.

1048
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:22,164
I suppose I should have regarded that
as a compliment.

1049
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:25,539
You pirates are used to taking
without the formality of purchase.

1050
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:28,010
I advise you to go back to your ladies
at Tortuga...

1051
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:30,206
who are thrilled by your bold,
lawless ways.

1052
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:32,715
I only hate you and despise you.

1053
01:29:33,684 --> 01:29:36,983
I might have expected your thanks
for what I've done this day...

1054
01:29:37,054 --> 01:29:38,885
but very well, let it be so.

1055
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:43,283
I'm a thief and pirate and I'll show you
how a thief and a pirate can deal.

1056
01:29:43,427 --> 01:29:45,691
Once, you bought me for a miserable £10.

1057
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:49,161
Now I've bought you for considerably
more. The amount's of no matter.

1058
01:29:49,233 --> 01:29:51,667
What matters is
now I own you as you once owned me.

1059
01:29:51,736 --> 01:29:54,864
You're mine, do you understand?
Mine to do with as I please!

1060
01:30:01,712 --> 01:30:04,738
Capt. Blood,
Lord Willoughby sends his compliments...

1061
01:30:04,815 --> 01:30:07,511
and requests you to talk with him
at your convenience.

1062
01:30:07,585 --> 01:30:09,109
He's been sent by the King himself.

1063
01:30:09,186 --> 01:30:11,984
Tell him I'm not convenient
to any friend of the King's.

1064
01:30:12,056 --> 01:30:13,819
All I've got to say is good riddance...

1065
01:30:13,891 --> 01:30:15,984
as soon as I can get him
to his destination.

1066
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:17,049
I shall.

1067
01:30:18,596 --> 01:30:21,190
Jeremy. Wolverstone.

1068
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:25,995
- Wolverstone!
- What is it, Peter?

1069
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:27,960
We're changing course.

1070
01:30:28,039 --> 01:30:30,405
Draw down every rag of canvas
the yards will hold.

1071
01:30:30,474 --> 01:30:33,409
- Aye, aye, Peter, but....
- Jeremy!

1072
01:30:34,412 --> 01:30:36,505
All hands on deck!

1073
01:30:43,621 --> 01:30:45,782
- Jeremy!
- Coming, Peter!

1074
01:30:48,726 --> 01:30:50,489
Forever sleeping when I need you?

1075
01:30:50,561 --> 01:30:53,553
- I wasn't sleeping. I was...
- Never mind! Get ready to go about.

1076
01:30:53,631 --> 01:30:55,929
- Set the course for Port Royal.
- Port Royal?

1077
01:30:57,968 --> 01:31:00,562
But the English fleet is at Port Royal.
Col. Bishop...

1078
01:31:00,638 --> 01:31:03,232
Sweet, merciful heaven! Haven't you ears?

1079
01:31:03,307 --> 01:31:05,241
Set the course for Port Royal!

1080
01:31:10,448 --> 01:31:13,440
- Make speed there, Wolverstone.
- Speed it is, Peter.

1081
01:31:14,585 --> 01:31:17,748
- Follow we a helm, west by north.
- West by north, sir.

1082
01:31:25,629 --> 01:31:28,757
Make speed there! To your halyards!

1083
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:33,363
Tacks and braces. We head for Port Royal.

1084
01:31:40,077 --> 01:31:42,637
Make speed there! That's the order!

1085
01:31:43,247 --> 01:31:44,771
Make speed there.

1086
01:31:46,717 --> 01:31:49,550
There's a gallows waiting
for each of us at Port Royal...

1087
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:52,088
and no man should be late
to his own hanging.

1088
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:55,755
How you hate the villain.

1089
01:31:55,826 --> 01:31:59,125
If I were a young man,
I'm dashed if I wouldn't be jealous.

1090
01:32:00,498 --> 01:32:02,557
But you said you didn't even know him.

1091
01:32:02,666 --> 01:32:04,327
He was once my slave.

1092
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:07,059
Slave?

1093
01:32:08,506 --> 01:32:10,098
Did you know him well?

1094
01:32:10,841 --> 01:32:11,899
I did.

1095
01:32:13,644 --> 01:32:16,374
He's not such a bad fellow for a pirate.

1096
01:32:17,648 --> 01:32:20,549
When he made his escape,
I was thrilled and happy.

1097
01:32:20,985 --> 01:32:23,818
That was before I knew how he would use
his freedom.

1098
01:32:23,921 --> 01:32:25,149
But aren't you forgetting...

1099
01:32:25,222 --> 01:32:28,385
that a man's bitter heart
may demand revenge?

1100
01:32:28,993 --> 01:32:30,722
That is the unforgivable thing:

1101
01:32:30,961 --> 01:32:33,156
to have put his revenge above
everything else...

1102
01:32:33,230 --> 01:32:35,664
and to have destroyed himself.
That's what he's done.

1103
01:32:35,733 --> 01:32:37,997
I've seen pirates. I know their ways.

1104
01:32:38,135 --> 01:32:41,434
Cruel, evil, greedy,
plundering peaceful cities...

1105
01:32:41,505 --> 01:32:44,201
torturing their captives. Beasts.

1106
01:33:01,659 --> 01:33:03,991
Are you so much in love with him?

1107
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,288
In love with him?

1108
01:33:05,496 --> 01:33:07,521
That you care so much what he does?

1109
01:33:07,598 --> 01:33:09,361
I don't care in the least what he does.

1110
01:33:09,433 --> 01:33:12,163
Someone should,
in view of what he's doing now.

1111
01:33:12,636 --> 01:33:15,901
But your uncle's with the fleet
at Port Royal. That much is fortunate.

1112
01:33:15,973 --> 01:33:18,806
Why? What's this about my uncle
in Port Royal?

1113
01:33:18,876 --> 01:33:22,175
He amazes me, this fellow.
That's where he means to take us.

1114
01:33:22,246 --> 01:33:24,771
- No, he can't.
- They won't let me near him.

1115
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:29,081
He's alone on his quarterdeck
in a fine Irish temper, I suspect.

1116
01:33:29,954 --> 01:33:33,515
- But I learned of it from one of the crew.
- Lord Willoughby, he mustn't.

1117
01:33:34,225 --> 01:33:36,022
My uncle is a hard, unforgiving man.

1118
01:33:36,093 --> 01:33:39,654
He lives in the hope of one day
taking and hanging Capt. Blood.

1119
01:33:39,964 --> 01:33:42,296
Capt. Blood probably doesn't know that,
of course.

1120
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:44,561
I doubt if it'd make any
difference if he did.

1121
01:33:44,635 --> 01:33:47,331
He's chivalrous to the point of idiocy.

1122
01:33:47,972 --> 01:33:49,166
Chivalrous?

1123
01:33:50,074 --> 01:33:53,305
And yet he's been what he's been
these last three years...

1124
01:33:53,477 --> 01:33:55,502
and done what he's done.

1125
01:33:56,614 --> 01:33:58,548
Lord Willoughby, help me.

1126
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:01,442
I see your point, my child...

1127
01:34:01,519 --> 01:34:04,352
but that's something
you must decide for yourself.

1128
01:34:05,022 --> 01:34:07,684
Life can be infernally complex.

1129
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:33,709
It's hard to lay tongue to the right words.

1130
01:34:33,784 --> 01:34:35,274
I'll lay tongue to them.

1131
01:34:35,352 --> 01:34:37,149
We won't sail to Jamaica.
Them's the words.

1132
01:34:37,221 --> 01:34:39,917
Aye, Bishop's entire fleet's at Jamaica.

1133
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:42,854
When you risked your neck in a duel
over that petticoat...

1134
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:44,360
that was your business.

1135
01:34:44,428 --> 01:34:47,659
But it's our necks you're risking now,
and I say no.

1136
01:34:47,731 --> 01:34:49,631
Not for her, nor a dozen like her.

1137
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:51,691
I got a great affection for my neck.

1138
01:34:51,769 --> 01:34:55,068
I have no wish to hear it cracked
by a hangman's knot.

1139
01:34:55,272 --> 01:34:58,799
This is what comes from sailing the seas
with a lovesick madman.

1140
01:35:01,545 --> 01:35:03,570
We've been with you since the first, Peter.

1141
01:35:03,647 --> 01:35:04,978
We have a right.

1142
01:35:08,686 --> 01:35:10,313
You, too, Jeremy?

1143
01:35:14,058 --> 01:35:15,423
All right, lads.

1144
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,655
What do you mean, Peter?

1145
01:35:18,262 --> 01:35:22,130
You told me we're not sailing to Jamaica.
There's nothing more to be said.

1146
01:35:22,666 --> 01:35:26,124
- Hurrah for our side!
- Quiet. You sound like a rooster.

1147
01:35:26,503 --> 01:35:27,902
Good night, lads.

1148
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:31,203
Wait a minute, Peter.
Where are we sailing for?

1149
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:35,570
That's for you to tell me...

1150
01:35:35,646 --> 01:35:37,375
since I'm no longer running this ship.

1151
01:35:37,448 --> 01:35:39,712
We didn't say that, Peter.

1152
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:41,941
As Jeremy says, you've got the right.

1153
01:35:42,019 --> 01:35:45,477
You've been with me from the first,
and you've been loyal and true...

1154
01:35:45,589 --> 01:35:48,922
followed me into every tight corner
men could follow another.

1155
01:35:48,993 --> 01:35:52,292
- But you always got us out.
- And none the poorer for it.

1156
01:35:52,429 --> 01:35:55,057
Yes, but on this occasion,
there's no gold to be got.

1157
01:35:55,132 --> 01:35:57,692
Do you think it was
for gold we followed you?

1158
01:35:58,035 --> 01:36:01,596
No, but I can see now I've not got
the right to ask you to follow me.

1159
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:03,936
The girl is my concern, not yours.

1160
01:36:04,441 --> 01:36:08,502
Are we gonna stand by and see
this little snip laugh at our captain?

1161
01:36:08,612 --> 01:36:10,045
There's Bishop's fleet.

1162
01:36:10,114 --> 01:36:13,140
That might be paying a high price
to keep from being laughed at.

1163
01:36:13,217 --> 01:36:16,778
We're not yet such lily-livered scum
as to be afraid of Col. Bishop.

1164
01:36:17,087 --> 01:36:19,920
No. That is, not very afraid.

1165
01:36:21,458 --> 01:36:23,892
Fie on you deserting our captain
in this way...

1166
01:36:23,961 --> 01:36:27,727
you scurvy traitors, you Judas Iscariots,
you snakes in the grass...

1167
01:36:27,798 --> 01:36:29,698
you wolves in sheep's clothing!

1168
01:36:29,767 --> 01:36:31,962
I was only with them to spy on them.

1169
01:36:34,438 --> 01:36:36,497
You'd better think carefully, lads.

1170
01:36:36,573 --> 01:36:39,371
Yonder lies Jamaica,
and straight we sail for it.

1171
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:43,536
- Aye. And straight we sail for it.
- Aye!

1172
01:36:57,594 --> 01:37:00,961
- Ahoy, the deck!
- Ahoy!

1173
01:37:01,031 --> 01:37:03,329
I have sighted Port Royal!

1174
01:37:03,634 --> 01:37:06,102
Aye! Port Royal, you say?

1175
01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:07,603
Aye, sir!

1176
01:37:14,912 --> 01:37:16,777
There's something amiss!

1177
01:37:17,514 --> 01:37:21,746
I see flashes of gunfire
from ships in the harbor!

1178
01:37:22,019 --> 01:37:23,714
- Fetch the Captain.
- Aye, sir.

1179
01:37:23,787 --> 01:37:26,984
Bugler, all hands on deck!

1180
01:37:56,820 --> 01:37:59,254
It's terrible to wake up at dawn
dreaming of thunder.

1181
01:37:59,323 --> 01:38:01,484
That's gunfire if I ever heard any.

1182
01:38:02,893 --> 01:38:06,556
- There's a battle in Port Royal harbor.
- How many ships do you make out?

1183
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:10,691
It's hard to see clearly in the early
morning light. I think there are two.

1184
01:38:11,001 --> 01:38:13,299
It's an attack on Port Royal, but who?

1185
01:38:14,404 --> 01:38:15,996
Pirate craft, perhaps.

1186
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,767
Wish I could make out their flags.

1187
01:38:20,210 --> 01:38:23,441
- Perhaps I can supply you the answer.
- You can?

1188
01:38:23,514 --> 01:38:26,779
Yes, if I may speak to
so inaccessible a person.

1189
01:38:26,884 --> 01:38:30,047
If Port Royal is being attacked,
they are likely French ships.

1190
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,109
French?

1191
01:38:38,862 --> 01:38:41,296
You say Port Royal's attacked
by the French? Why?

1192
01:38:41,365 --> 01:38:43,856
When two countries are at war
and one is attacked...

1193
01:38:43,934 --> 01:38:45,799
who would it be but the enemy?

1194
01:38:45,869 --> 01:38:48,360
What's this? France and England at war?

1195
01:38:48,438 --> 01:38:51,737
You mean you don't know? Where have
you been the past few months?

1196
01:38:51,809 --> 01:38:53,640
At sea, out of touch with the world.

1197
01:38:53,710 --> 01:38:56,838
The fire from the fortress is weakening!

1198
01:38:57,214 --> 01:39:00,650
One ship is already firing on the town!

1199
01:39:01,118 --> 01:39:02,210
That's strange.

1200
01:39:02,286 --> 01:39:05,255
Where is the English fleet
that's supposed to protect the town?

1201
01:39:05,322 --> 01:39:08,120
It's my turn to supply the answer.
It's out chasing pirates.

1202
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:12,288
Bishop would never let his fleet leave its
post in time of war. He wouldn't dare.

1203
01:39:12,362 --> 01:39:16,025
Col. Bishop, if I may say,
is a very old and dear friend of mine.

1204
01:39:16,099 --> 01:39:19,000
- lt's probably me he's after.
- That fool! Blunder!

1205
01:39:19,069 --> 01:39:20,969
And me in his own front yard.

1206
01:39:22,973 --> 01:39:25,498
Shorten sail there, Wolf.
Lend a hand forward, Andy.

1207
01:39:25,576 --> 01:39:28,841
Stand by helm and keep her headed
two points to larboard of the fort.

1208
01:39:28,912 --> 01:39:29,901
Aye, aye, sir.

1209
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:31,743
Get your men to their stations, Chester.

1210
01:39:31,815 --> 01:39:33,009
Port watch to stations!

1211
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:34,573
Speed there, lads!

1212
01:39:35,152 --> 01:39:37,677
- Reef the fore topsail!
- Aye, aye, sir!

1213
01:39:37,754 --> 01:39:39,745
Take in the topgallant sail.

1214
01:39:41,225 --> 01:39:43,853
May I ask, Captain,
what are your intentions?

1215
01:39:43,927 --> 01:39:47,385
Lord Willoughby, I set out to land you
at Port Royal, but now....

1216
01:39:53,103 --> 01:39:55,469
Miss Bishop,
an unlooked-for circumstance...

1217
01:39:55,539 --> 01:39:57,837
prevents my landing you
on your own dock.

1218
01:39:57,908 --> 01:40:00,775
But I trust that if I put you ashore
on the beach nearby...

1219
01:40:00,844 --> 01:40:02,869
that would be equally satisfactory?

1220
01:40:02,946 --> 01:40:04,379
- l...
- Thank you.

1221
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:09,448
Only please understand,
this is a bargain...

1222
01:40:09,519 --> 01:40:10,986
your freedom for my freedom.

1223
01:40:11,054 --> 01:40:13,887
From now on,
I no longer regard myself as a slave.

1224
01:40:15,025 --> 01:40:16,583
My life's my own...

1225
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:19,821
even though I'm a thief and pirate.

1226
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:25,368
Capt. Blood, are you,
an Englishman, thinking of leaving...

1227
01:40:25,435 --> 01:40:27,835
when yonder,
an English town is being taken?

1228
01:40:27,905 --> 01:40:30,339
Hagthorpe,
clear my deck and keep it cleared.

1229
01:40:30,407 --> 01:40:33,865
- Aye, Peter, we'll take care of him.
- Take your hands off!

1230
01:40:33,977 --> 01:40:37,105
- Wait, lads.
- Capt. Blood, I must talk to you.

1231
01:40:37,681 --> 01:40:39,444
Very well then, Lord Willoughby.

1232
01:40:39,516 --> 01:40:42,679
Myself, I've the honor to be Irish,
but part of my crew's English.

1233
01:40:42,753 --> 01:40:44,948
I was myself once, too, in loyalty.

1234
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:46,350
Of what should we be thinking?

1235
01:40:46,423 --> 01:40:48,687
Of the chance to fight for your king.

1236
01:40:48,759 --> 01:40:50,283
To fight for my king?

1237
01:40:50,727 --> 01:40:53,787
Yes. He was loyal enough
to send me to seek you out...

1238
01:40:53,897 --> 01:40:56,422
to offer you pardon for your past crimes...

1239
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,866
freedom from your slavery
and more than that...

1240
01:40:58,936 --> 01:41:01,962
a commission in his own navy
for you and your men.

1241
01:41:02,372 --> 01:41:05,933
You hear that, Chester?
The King wants us to join his navy!

1242
01:41:09,413 --> 01:41:11,176
Read it for yourself.

1243
01:41:11,248 --> 01:41:13,443
Lord Willoughby,
you're a guest aboard my ship...

1244
01:41:13,517 --> 01:41:16,953
and I've still some notion left me
from better days of decent behavior...

1245
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:19,511
so I'll not be telling you
what I think of this offer.

1246
01:41:19,589 --> 01:41:22,456
All I'll say is,
I wouldn't soil my hands with it...

1247
01:41:22,526 --> 01:41:25,393
even though they're the hands
of a thief and a pirate.

1248
01:41:25,762 --> 01:41:28,287
But this concerns you, too, my lads.

1249
01:41:28,899 --> 01:41:30,833
What do you say to serving the King?

1250
01:41:30,901 --> 01:41:32,163
No!

1251
01:41:36,139 --> 01:41:38,630
I'd like to serve him with a rope necktie.

1252
01:41:39,509 --> 01:41:41,500
I'd rot before I'd serve him.

1253
01:41:42,412 --> 01:41:45,540
I'd sink this ship with all hands
before I'd serve him.

1254
01:41:45,615 --> 01:41:48,709
It would appear then
that my crew is still a little dubious...

1255
01:41:48,785 --> 01:41:51,185
as to the merits of His Majesty's offer.

1256
01:41:51,388 --> 01:41:54,482
However you hate the King,
England is still England.

1257
01:41:54,624 --> 01:41:57,855
And a bad king is bad king,
and worse one if he's James.

1258
01:41:58,128 --> 01:42:01,291
James?
This commission is sent by King William.

1259
01:42:02,299 --> 01:42:05,791
King William? Who may King William be
and what's he king of?

1260
01:42:05,869 --> 01:42:09,134
I'm alluding to His Majesty,
King William III, William of Orange...

1261
01:42:09,206 --> 01:42:12,004
who, with Queen Mary,
has come over from the Netherlands...

1262
01:42:12,075 --> 01:42:15,306
and has been ruling England
the past two months or more.

1263
01:42:17,748 --> 01:42:21,013
They've roused themselves at home
and kicked out that pimple James?

1264
01:42:21,084 --> 01:42:23,814
Yes, and he's fled to France
and he's in hiding there...

1265
01:42:23,887 --> 01:42:25,946
and England and France are at war.

1266
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:28,957
The English people will go so far,
Capt. Blood...

1267
01:42:29,026 --> 01:42:31,961
and then they get up
on their stubborn hind legs.

1268
01:42:32,029 --> 01:42:34,327
- And William sent us this commission?
- Yes.

1269
01:42:34,865 --> 01:42:38,767
He knows you're good men,
wrongfully sold into slavery.

1270
01:42:38,835 --> 01:42:42,134
He can use good men in his navy.

1271
01:42:42,205 --> 01:42:44,298
It's the long-winded fellow you are.

1272
01:42:44,374 --> 01:42:47,070
Why didn't you tell us this
in the first place?

1273
01:42:48,478 --> 01:42:51,038
Bugler, summon the men amidships!

1274
01:43:00,290 --> 01:43:03,987
Men!
I've just heard a startling piece of news.

1275
01:43:04,127 --> 01:43:08,359
King James is kicked out of England
and good King William reigns in his stead.

1276
01:43:12,302 --> 01:43:15,601
For me,
this changes the shape of the world.

1277
01:43:15,906 --> 01:43:17,999
For you who were slaves with me...

1278
01:43:18,075 --> 01:43:20,339
it means that we're no longer slaves.

1279
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:23,436
That we once more have
a home and a country.

1280
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:25,338
For you who are English...

1281
01:43:25,415 --> 01:43:28,248
it means a chance to fight
for your native land...

1282
01:43:28,318 --> 01:43:31,913
for I now propose to sail into Port Royal
and take it from the French!

1283
01:43:31,988 --> 01:43:33,979
Those of you who are not English...

1284
01:43:34,191 --> 01:43:37,160
will have to be content
with fighting for Capt. Blood...

1285
01:43:39,129 --> 01:43:42,064
and the loot you'll find
on the French ships.

1286
01:43:43,433 --> 01:43:46,459
- Are you willing to fight, men?
- Aye!

1287
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:49,803
Have we an English battle flag on board,
Hagthorpe?

1288
01:43:49,873 --> 01:43:53,832
We have every manner of battle flag,
including a lady's purple petticoat.

1289
01:43:54,144 --> 01:43:55,907
Wait, I've a better idea.

1290
01:43:55,979 --> 01:43:58,812
When an English lion creeps up
on a nest of French foxes...

1291
01:43:58,882 --> 01:44:00,144
he wears a bushy tail.

1292
01:44:00,217 --> 01:44:03,550
Hoist the French flag, Hagthorpe.
Keep her trimmed by the head, Wolf.

1293
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:04,814
Stand by the helm, Jeremy.

1294
01:44:04,888 --> 01:44:06,879
Forward, men, to your stations.

1295
01:44:07,858 --> 01:44:10,349
- ls that satisfactory to you?
- Perfectly.

1296
01:44:20,437 --> 01:44:22,132
Clear decks for action!

1297
01:44:26,977 --> 01:44:30,140
Capt. Blood's orders.
You'll be put ashore with these men.

1298
01:44:30,213 --> 01:44:32,477
A ship is no place for a woman
in time of battle.

1299
01:44:32,549 --> 01:44:35,017
- I want to talk to him.
- I'm sorry. The Captain's busy.

1300
01:44:35,085 --> 01:44:36,484
- lnto the boat.
- Aye, sir.

1301
01:44:36,553 --> 01:44:38,180
Follow me, Miss Bishop.

1302
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:27,867
Musketeers, to your stations!

1303
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:51,788
A French ship.

1304
01:45:55,098 --> 01:45:57,965
Hope we get on them
before they discover the trick.

1305
01:46:11,481 --> 01:46:12,607
- Andy.
- Aye, Peter.

1306
01:46:12,682 --> 01:46:15,674
Run to Hagthorpe.
Tell him to fetch all the hot coals.

1307
01:46:15,752 --> 01:46:17,720
- Put them by the guns.
- Hot coals, sir?

1308
01:46:17,787 --> 01:46:20,585
- No questions. Run.
- Aye, aye, sir!

1309
01:46:28,531 --> 01:46:31,432
Stand by ready to fire as soon as
we come amidships.

1310
01:46:31,668 --> 01:46:35,195
Stand ready to fire
as soon as we've come amidships!

1311
01:46:35,672 --> 01:46:37,333
Open your ports!

1312
01:47:11,541 --> 01:47:14,339
Strike that French flag
and hoist our own colors.

1313
01:47:17,981 --> 01:47:19,608
Man your port guns!

1314
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:25,747
Ready, Hagthorpe?

1315
01:47:28,124 --> 01:47:29,455
Fire!

1316
01:47:43,206 --> 01:47:46,175
Hagthorpe,
give them the hot galley broadside!

1317
01:47:46,242 --> 01:47:48,802
Aye, Peter! Load them, lads!

1318
01:48:33,757 --> 01:48:36,658
Hagthorpe, keep pounding that water line!

1319
01:48:46,302 --> 01:48:48,270
We never miss.

1320
01:49:04,888 --> 01:49:08,255
- That's one ship neatly disposed off.
- Now for the other one.

1321
01:49:08,725 --> 01:49:11,558
- Jeremy, helm quarter to port.
- Aye, aye, Peter.

1322
01:49:11,628 --> 01:49:13,255
Clear away that burning wreckage!

1323
01:49:16,466 --> 01:49:19,367
- Port guns, Wolf. Hurry.
- Aye, Peter.

1324
01:49:19,669 --> 01:49:21,899
Man your port guns!

1325
01:49:46,729 --> 01:49:49,493
Those French gunners
must've learnt their trade in England.

1326
01:49:49,566 --> 01:49:51,500
That's their third direct hit.

1327
01:50:01,377 --> 01:50:03,641
Two guns out of order.
Ship's taking water below.

1328
01:50:03,713 --> 01:50:05,738
Replace them with two
from the starboard side.

1329
01:50:05,815 --> 01:50:08,511
- Keep hammering that waterline.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1330
01:50:21,431 --> 01:50:23,695
Lower gun deck's awash, we're sinking.
What should we do?

1331
01:50:23,766 --> 01:50:27,031
Do? We'll board a ship that's not sinking.
Get your men forward.

1332
01:50:27,103 --> 01:50:28,092
Aye, aye, sir.

1333
01:50:30,673 --> 01:50:33,005
- What now, Peter?
- Take the helm yourself, lad.

1334
01:50:33,076 --> 01:50:34,543
Straight into them!

1335
01:50:37,413 --> 01:50:40,473
- We'll never do it, Peter!
- Musketeers to the prow!

1336
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:44,486
Grappling hooks to larboard. Forward
gunners, fire as hard as they can load!

1337
01:50:48,424 --> 01:50:50,119
Rapid fire, men!

1338
01:50:50,193 --> 01:50:52,286
Hagthorpe, double them up!

1339
01:50:52,629 --> 01:50:55,496
They won't take it, Peter!
They're blazing hot!

1340
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:06,771
Up into the shrouds, men!

1341
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:16,281
We're going to swing across on ropes.

1342
01:51:16,352 --> 01:51:18,252
When we clear the rail,
come over the side!

1343
01:51:18,321 --> 01:51:19,413
Aye, aye, Peter!

1344
01:51:24,294 --> 01:51:26,558
You and your men swing across
into their rigging.

1345
01:51:26,629 --> 01:51:29,598
When you see me cut down
that French flag, drop down.

1346
01:51:32,635 --> 01:51:34,694
Up, men, into the shrouds!

1347
01:51:37,507 --> 01:51:40,067
Strong and sure! Grapnels over!

1348
01:52:19,849 --> 01:52:22,374
All right, my hearties, follow me!

1349
01:52:45,808 --> 01:52:47,036
Follow on, men!

1350
01:53:06,829 --> 01:53:09,662
"Dust thou art,
and unto dust thou shalt return."

1351
01:53:38,161 --> 01:53:39,856
"Love thy neighbor as thyself."

1352
01:53:39,929 --> 01:53:42,022
Leviticus 19:18.

1353
01:55:23,432 --> 01:55:26,993
- Hurry, Cato. We'll be late.
- Yes. The fleet's in already.

1354
01:55:35,711 --> 01:55:37,770
- Stop!
- Yes.

1355
01:55:41,951 --> 01:55:43,578
Capt. Blood!

1356
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:48,850
Miss Bishop.

1357
01:55:50,459 --> 01:55:52,427
I'll be on the veranda.

1358
01:55:55,198 --> 01:55:56,597
I thought you'd gone.

1359
01:55:56,666 --> 01:55:58,657
You can't be here.
My uncle's just returned.

1360
01:55:58,734 --> 01:56:00,429
- Yes, I know.
- You know?

1361
01:56:00,503 --> 01:56:02,368
- What are you going to do?
- Just stay here.

1362
01:56:02,438 --> 01:56:04,599
No, it's impossible. You mustn't stay here.

1363
01:56:04,674 --> 01:56:06,801
- He's sworn he'll hang you.
- I doubt he will.

1364
01:56:06,876 --> 01:56:08,673
I've always been bad luck for your uncle.

1365
01:56:08,744 --> 01:56:11,975
You can't know the threats he's made.
The dreadful threats he's made.

1366
01:56:12,048 --> 01:56:14,039
His whole life is spent
in searching for you.

1367
01:56:14,116 --> 01:56:16,949
- Now he's found me.
- But you can still save yourself.

1368
01:56:17,019 --> 01:56:18,919
Please, for my sake.

1369
01:56:18,988 --> 01:56:22,754
For your sake? What do you mean for your
sake? Isn't it true that you hate me?

1370
01:56:23,826 --> 01:56:26,090
- Hate you?
- Or is it that you love me?

1371
01:56:26,662 --> 01:56:29,563
I'll hide you. And tonight after
dark, I'll find some way...

1372
01:56:29,632 --> 01:56:31,532
You love me, don't you?

1373
01:56:32,702 --> 01:56:35,762
Whom else would I love? Now will you?

1374
01:56:35,838 --> 01:56:37,430
You love me!

1375
01:56:37,506 --> 01:56:39,974
Lord Willoughby, she loves me!

1376
01:56:41,811 --> 01:56:44,211
He'll be here any minute.
I'll hide you somewhere.

1377
01:56:44,280 --> 01:56:46,805
We'll hide together. I know just the place.

1378
01:56:58,961 --> 01:57:00,189
How's this?

1379
01:57:00,263 --> 01:57:02,424
You must be mad. He'll come here first.

1380
01:57:02,498 --> 01:57:04,295
Good. I forgot to tell you.

1381
01:57:04,467 --> 01:57:06,458
The Governor and I are
on the best of terms.

1382
01:57:06,535 --> 01:57:09,026
He lets me come and go here
as I please. Look.

1383
01:57:14,744 --> 01:57:17,941
- You can't arrest me!
- I have, by order of the Governor.

1384
01:57:18,014 --> 01:57:20,574
The Governor? You are mad.
I am the governor.

1385
01:57:20,650 --> 01:57:22,777
You mean, you were the governor.

1386
01:57:23,052 --> 01:57:25,748
But we've changed that in your absence.

1387
01:57:25,855 --> 01:57:27,049
What?

1388
01:57:27,123 --> 01:57:30,650
You're broken for abandoning your post
in time of war.

1389
01:57:30,927 --> 01:57:31,916
Who are you?

1390
01:57:31,994 --> 01:57:35,327
My name is Willoughby. I'm a special
emissary of His Majesty the King.

1391
01:57:35,431 --> 01:57:36,591
Lord Willoughby?

1392
01:57:36,666 --> 01:57:39,100
- You were informed, I think, of my coming.
- Yes.

1393
01:57:39,168 --> 01:57:42,331
Yet you went off
on some wild goose chase after a pirate...

1394
01:57:42,405 --> 01:57:44,873
leaving your capital at the mercy
of the enemy.

1395
01:57:44,941 --> 01:57:48,104
Col. Bishop, this is a serious matter,
as you may well find.

1396
01:57:48,177 --> 01:57:50,270
Seeing that you hold your office
from James...

1397
01:57:50,446 --> 01:57:53,472
it's even possible the charge of treason
lies against you.

1398
01:57:53,549 --> 01:57:54,538
But, my lord...

1399
01:57:54,617 --> 01:57:57,484
I'm not concerned to hear
your reasons, man.

1400
01:57:57,620 --> 01:58:00,214
- His Excellency the Governor will.
- The Governor?

1401
01:58:00,289 --> 01:58:01,916
You'll find him inside.

1402
01:58:02,058 --> 01:58:04,959
It rests entirely with him
whether you're hanged or not.

1403
01:58:07,029 --> 01:58:09,190
This is the fault of that scoundrel Blood.

1404
01:58:09,265 --> 01:58:11,733
What a reckoning
there'll be when we meet.

1405
01:58:13,469 --> 01:58:17,235
Have mercy, Your Excellency!

1406
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:19,908
- Arabella, why are you here?
- Uncle!

1407
01:58:21,477 --> 01:58:24,071
I have been pleading
with the Governor on your behalf...

1408
01:58:24,146 --> 01:58:27,547
asking him to be as merciful
as you would be cruel.

1409
01:58:29,819 --> 01:58:33,016
Uncle, this is the Governor.

1410
01:58:39,495 --> 01:58:41,622
Good morning, Uncle.
