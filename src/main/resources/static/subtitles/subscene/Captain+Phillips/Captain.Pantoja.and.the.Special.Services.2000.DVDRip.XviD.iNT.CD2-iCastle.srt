1
00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:02,976
Work plan?

2
00:00:03,216 --> 00:00:07,312
Three convoys: Two of 48 hours,
and one returns tonight.

3
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:09,488
I already drew lots.

4
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:10,816
Lalita...

5
00:00:10,957 --> 00:00:12,254
Vanessa...

6
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:13,484
and Colombiana.

7
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:16,251
We go to Bolognesi garrison.

8
00:00:16,396 --> 00:00:19,797
It returns on Thursday at noon.

9
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:24,066
Start boarding.
I want you to work well...

10
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:27,705
and remember:
Work...

11
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:30,071
...ennobles and dignifies!

12
00:00:30,343 --> 00:00:32,834
- Let's get to work.
- Excuse me.

13
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:48,183
Is there a problem?

14
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,923
No, nothing.

15
00:00:53,533 --> 00:00:56,093
I just have something in my shoe.

16
00:00:56,936 --> 00:00:58,164
Thank you.

17
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:01,901
You are not coming?

18
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:05,776
No. I have work here.

19
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:07,570
Too bad.

20
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:11,115
I thought we could repeat the test.

21
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:14,777
Don't you want to sleep with me?

22
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:16,779
The test allowed me...

23
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:20,049
to gather important information.

24
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:26,029
I thank you, but I don't consider it
necessary to repeat it.

25
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,963
Any trouble?

26
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:30,369
We're five minutes late.

27
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:32,368
No, Chuchupe.

28
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:37,542
This must not happen.
This situation may affect...

29
00:01:37,777 --> 00:01:42,305
the personnel's performance
and concentration.

30
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:45,578
Then we could go to a hotel...

31
00:01:45,818 --> 00:01:47,581
so we aren't seen.

32
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:01,730
Pocha, I've told you not to call
me at work, unless...

33
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:05,070
What?
I'll be right there!

34
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:09,333
Here are the last results.

35
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:16,341
You're sure, doctor?

36
00:02:16,583 --> 00:02:17,311
Yes.

37
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,214
Your wife is pregnant.

38
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:27,455
I wanted to be sure
before I told you.

39
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:30,524
At last, Pantita. At last!

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,963
I'll be a father!

41
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:57,415
A penny for your thoughts.

42
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:01,550
What are you doing here?

43
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:06,294
They left without me.

44
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,934
And your machine?

45
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:17,308
I thought you never stopped working.

46
00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:20,139
The Dalila returns at seven.

47
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,312
So you are working.

48
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:26,842
A cigarette?

49
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,312
No thank you.

50
00:03:39,265 --> 00:03:42,757
Since the test,
we've never been alone.

51
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,168
Are you nervous?

52
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,807
What is it you want, Olga?

53
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:55,543
Nothing in particular.

54
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,946
- I thought you and I...
- "You and l"?

55
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:02,181
There is no "you and I."
That was very clear.

56
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:03,448
For work...

57
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,887
- Can't you think of anything else?
- No!

58
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,655
Even less when I speak to you.

59
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,176
Excuse me, I have to go.

60
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,342
Stay.

61
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,045
I'll leave.

62
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,710
You know?

63
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:35,810
You may be an excellent boss
and lover...

64
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:37,847
but as a person,
you're insufferable.

65
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,218
I'm not your lover...

66
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:41,688
miss.

67
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:45,125
But you want to be.

68
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:58,274
Today, we have stopped
along the way...

69
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:01,542
to celebrate
the 20,000th rendering...

70
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:03,578
carried out by Pechuga.

71
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:17,290
20,000 renderings given
to the soldiers and petty officers...

72
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,862
of our border units...

73
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,200
that signify a success.

74
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,762
They prove that the service...

75
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:30,305
has employed its capacity
to the fullest...

76
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:34,604
as can be deduced from
the 20,000 renderings...

77
00:05:34,747 --> 00:05:36,146
and its components.

78
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:41,643
Our objective, for the year...

79
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:44,586
is to reach 200,000 renderings.

80
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:48,891
It's an ambitious
but possible figure...

81
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:53,588
if personnel maintain
their high performance...

82
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:55,360
as they have to date...

83
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:58,436
and with the coming reinforcements.

84
00:05:58,571 --> 00:06:01,506
Here's to the 20,000!

85
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:16,446
Look! It's beautiful!

86
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:22,027
Cut the cake, Mister Panta!

87
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:06,735
Do you care to dance?

88
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:26,521
Are you ok, Mister Panta?

89
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,694
I'm not used to these celebrations.

90
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:33,262
I've had too much to drink.
I'm woozy.

91
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:37,635
Take it easy. Close your eyes.
There you go.

92
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:58,589
Partner switch!

93
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:24,608
Why didn't you dance with me, Olga?

94
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:27,579
Why didn't you ask me to?

95
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,212
You've treated me
as if I was invisible.

96
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:35,284
It's complicated, Olga.

97
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:38,326
I don't understand.

98
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:42,263
A man either likes a woman
or he doesn't.

99
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:45,929
And you don't seem to like me.

100
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:48,097
I like you.

101
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,066
I like you a lot.

102
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:55,678
I haven't stopped thinking
about you since...

103
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,178
You know...

104
00:09:00,486 --> 00:09:02,283
Since we slept together?

105
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:06,850
Olga...

106
00:09:08,327 --> 00:09:10,192
If only I could...

107
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:14,122
You can!

108
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:17,030
You just have to want it!

109
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,112
I like you.
I like you so much.

110
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:39,220
The famous Colombiana!

111
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:40,120
Excuse me?

112
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,725
Look how many are in her line.

113
00:09:56,075 --> 00:10:00,205
Don't you like this saddle anymore?

114
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:01,904
I like you, but...

115
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:04,846
I'll ride another filly, this time.

116
00:10:04,984 --> 00:10:07,350
Get back in line, soldier!

117
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:10,845
My record allows me to choose...

118
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:14,156
so I'm trying the Colombiana.

119
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:16,987
Return to your line.

120
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:19,424
Miss Colombiana already
has too many users.

121
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:21,697
Each visitor can give...

122
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,893
up to twenty renderings.

123
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:26,368
And, with me, there are...

124
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:27,802
Nineteen.

125
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:32,572
Nineteen users, sir.

126
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:38,843
Soldier?

127
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:42,213
User number twenty, sir.

128
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:44,185
Gentlemen.

129
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:48,989
Can't you see
the lady is overloaded?

130
00:10:50,196 --> 00:10:55,065
By your turn, she'll be too exhausted
to perform well.

131
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,362
I suggest you return to your lines.

132
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:58,501
No.

133
00:10:59,138 --> 00:11:00,765
I don't tire easily.

134
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:03,231
On the contrary...

135
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,367
I get more aroused
with each soldier.

136
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:11,081
The last ones will be
just as well tended as the first.

137
00:11:11,217 --> 00:11:14,277
Try it. Fall in at the end.

138
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:25,290
Regulations demand ten renderings.

139
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:27,592
That's it.

140
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,257
Just ten.

141
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,593
Forgive me, Olga.

142
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:43,940
I don't know
what is happening to me.

143
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:50,282
It's your flirting...

144
00:12:50,716 --> 00:12:53,116
I can't stand it.

145
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:55,616
The soldiers look at you...

146
00:12:57,389 --> 00:12:59,118
as if you were a...

147
00:12:59,525 --> 00:13:01,015
A visitor.

148
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,685
That's what I am, right?

149
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:36,888
It's abusive that the visitors
are only for soldiers.

150
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:40,796
We ask that civilians
in the army reserves...

151
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:45,299
be able to use this service,
just as the soldiers.

152
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:48,734
This service exists only in your minds.

153
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,908
How can you request such nonsense?

154
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:55,809
We've seen the boats, sir.

155
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,516
Boats filled with women.

156
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,241
We have needs too.

157
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:02,718
Not just the soldiers.

158
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:06,684
I have no information about this.

159
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,517
You've been drinking
too much chuchuhuasi.

160
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:11,661
But, General...

161
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:13,822
Do I look like a pimp?

162
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:16,833
No, General.

163
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:20,427
If the press finds out about this...

164
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,705
you wouldn't last long in office,
mayor.

165
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:28,846
Now, get the hell out
of my sight!

166
00:14:29,815 --> 00:14:32,477
Out!

167
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,056
What's wrong?

168
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:47,891
Remorse, again?

169
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:51,432
I hate doing this to my wife.

170
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:54,806
I know...

171
00:14:56,108 --> 00:15:01,307
You never cheated. You made love
every other Saturday, at 10:00 p.m.

172
00:15:02,281 --> 00:15:06,047
I know it by heart, Panta.

173
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,059
Come here.

174
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:38,973
Relax. Nobody's watching.

175
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,419
You can't be too careful.

176
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:46,787
Are you ashamed of me?

177
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:50,787
That would be crazy.

178
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:56,924
There's a party on Friday.

179
00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:01,765
I'm on leave that day
and I want to go.

180
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:04,841
You can go with Sandra.

181
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:07,144
I want to go with you.

182
00:16:07,513 --> 00:16:10,710
With me?
You know that's impossible.

183
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:12,849
We can't be seen together.

184
00:16:56,495 --> 00:17:00,022
These little girls are something.

185
00:17:00,165 --> 00:17:04,363
You said it: Little girls.
Dumb babies...

186
00:17:05,003 --> 00:17:08,268
not one of them worth anything.

187
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:13,003
Show me a woman
that'll take your breath away...

188
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:16,043
one that'll give you goose bumps.

189
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:17,213
There!

190
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:21,247
There is a woman.

191
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,193
Got you, Pantaleon Pantoja!

192
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:34,230
You jerk!

193
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:36,732
Come on, you've got work.

194
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:53,747
What are you doing?

195
00:17:55,521 --> 00:17:57,250
Just working, Mister Pantoja.

196
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:00,489
We have enough.
Right, Mario?

197
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:23,374
Mr. Sinchi is here.

198
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:25,608
He has a present for you.

199
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,522
What is it you want?

200
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,126
I can make sure they disappear.

201
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:40,661
Surely, you don't want your wife
to see them.

202
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:43,493
That's what friends are for.

203
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:47,171
You know we are not friends,
Mr. Laudano.

204
00:18:47,773 --> 00:18:52,642
Wrong! If I wasn't your friend,
you would be out of business.

205
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:57,647
And I am not talking
about the pictures I have.

206
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:00,651
I'm talking of something bigger.

207
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,549
Pantyland!

208
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:07,723
Don't get angry, Mr. Pantoja...

209
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,592
I speak of the thriving business
you run before everyone's eyes.

210
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,892
Rubbish.

211
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:19,069
After careful investigations...

212
00:19:19,204 --> 00:19:23,004
I now have enough evidence
to sink you...

213
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,707
into disgrace and ruin.

214
00:19:26,612 --> 00:19:29,604
If I were to speak on my show...

215
00:19:29,748 --> 00:19:32,876
- Why don't you?
- Because I am for progress.

216
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:36,619
I am ahead of my time.

217
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:40,589
But the whole city pressures me...

218
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:44,185
and I think my silence
deserves a reward.

219
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:48,129
Blackmail then?

220
00:19:50,802 --> 00:19:53,862
I'll help you, man!
For a few dollars...

221
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:58,304
I'll defend the Visitors' Service
and its mastermind.

222
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:02,072
Don't answer right away.
Sleep on it...

223
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:06,216
consult with your wife, your lover...
Don't get nervous!

224
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:07,748
Caiguas, Rioalto!

225
00:20:08,186 --> 00:20:10,950
What? Stop them!
Let go, damn it!

226
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:14,955
Throw him in the river!
Nobody blackmails me!

227
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:19,061
Don't commit suicide!
I'm superman in Iquitos!

228
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:20,788
I can't swim!

229
00:20:34,112 --> 00:20:36,580
You'll be sorry about this!

230
00:20:36,848 --> 00:20:40,045
There is nothing in Iquitos...

231
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:42,753
that The Sinchi's voice
can't knock down.

232
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:46,320
You asked for it!
This is war! War!

233
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:13,578
As the clock that adorns
our studio wall strikes 1600 hours...

234
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:18,449
Amazon Radio is pleased
to bring its listeners...

235
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,686
<i>the most listened to</i>
<i>program on the dial.</i>

236
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:26,562
<i>The voice of Sinchi!</i>

237
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:30,634
I promised to unmask that lawless...

238
00:21:30,902 --> 00:21:32,699
unscrupulous individual...

239
00:21:32,938 --> 00:21:36,533
who, unpunished,
runs that depraved den...

240
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:40,736
<i>known as Visitors’ Service...</i>

241
00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:46,442
better known as "Pantyland."

242
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:53,621
The Sinchi fulfills his promises,
my dear listeners.

243
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,989
Pantaleon Pantoja...

244
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:59,655
<i>is the name of this dark character!</i>

245
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:03,790
<i>Pantaleon Pantoja, who has come...</i>

246
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:06,733
<i>from the depths of hell, supported...</i>

247
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:10,100
<i>by powerful and invisible interests...</i>

248
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:14,406
<i>to fill his name with shame,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen!</i>

249
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,982
Yes, General.

250
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,823
I've heard nothing.

251
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:33,062
What?

252
00:22:40,138 --> 00:22:41,070
Pocha!

253
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:49,410
...because, as a matter of fact,
Pantaleon Pantoja has a wife...

254
00:22:49,648 --> 00:22:53,209
and has been leading a double life.

255
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:57,115
On one hand,
neck deep in the swamp...

256
00:22:57,355 --> 00:22:59,550
of his affair with Olga Arellano...

257
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:01,158
<i>the Colombiana...</i>

258
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:06,090
<i>remembered as the beautiful</i>
<i>whore from the north...</i>

259
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:09,562
<i>while appearing to lead...</i>

260
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:14,031
a respectable life.
Hiding under the ignorance...

261
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:17,833
in which he kept his own wife...

262
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:22,544
to whom we extend...

263
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:27,141
<i>all our moral support,</i>
<i>and we remind her...</i>

264
00:23:27,285 --> 00:23:30,584
that life is better under
the light of truth...

265
00:23:31,456 --> 00:23:32,821
than under...

266
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:34,550
<i>ignorance.</i>

267
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:40,758
What does the army
have to do with Pantyland?

268
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:45,501
Does Pantoja have
the authorities' consent...

269
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:49,264
to enter quarters with prostitutes?

270
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,734
General Scavino, Father Beltran...

271
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:54,843
the mayor, the prefect.

272
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,379
Are they aware of these dealings...

273
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:01,384
and are looking away?

274
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,948
We will continue to investigate,
no matter who may fall!

275
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:12,757
<i>With the courage</i>
<i>that has been our trademark.</i>

276
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:17,396
<i>You have heard: The Voice...</i>

277
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:19,697
of Sinchi!

278
00:24:21,006 --> 00:24:25,238
Devastating, Maestro!
Devastating!

279
00:24:37,722 --> 00:24:39,189
Let me explain!

280
00:24:39,457 --> 00:24:43,723
There's nothing to explain.
Get out of the way.

281
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:45,853
- You can't go!
- Let go!

282
00:24:46,097 --> 00:24:48,122
Think of our little cadet!

283
00:24:48,366 --> 00:24:50,698
You can forget about him and me.

284
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:53,029
You liar!
You hypocrite!

285
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:55,034
It's this job's fault!

286
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:57,741
You know me!

287
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:00,342
When I had to feed a regiment...

288
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:03,707
I gained weight!
I learned how to cook!

289
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:07,214
When I was in charge of uniforms...

290
00:25:07,485 --> 00:25:11,581
I designed combat fatigues myself!
Remember?

291
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:14,018
They thought I was a fag!

292
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:20,355
Work absorbs me.
It transforms me. I can't control it.

293
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,865
Then stay with your whores,
your Colombiana...

294
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:26,536
and all that filth!

295
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:30,434
Don't touch me!
You're disgusting!

296
00:25:34,346 --> 00:25:35,745
Let go of me!

297
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:44,655
<i>I have offended an officer.</i>

298
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:50,455
I know this is grave, but...

299
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:52,560
Three Our Fathers.

300
00:25:57,035 --> 00:25:58,935
<i>- Shame on you!</i>
- Excellence!

301
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:01,067
<i>What do you know?</i>

302
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:02,298
Nothing, but...

303
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,873
<i>Don't lie!</i>

304
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:05,542
No, your Excellence.

305
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:07,942
<i>You are a soldier of God!</i>

306
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:09,578
Yes, Excellence.

307
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:11,941
<i>You must fight Satan!</i>

308
00:26:23,695 --> 00:26:25,458
Please listen to me.

309
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,221
<i>What can you say?</i>

310
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:30,733
I've presented my resignation.

311
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:34,003
I've asked to be relieved of duty.

312
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:35,470
<i>What did he say?</i>

313
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:38,767
Nothing, yet.
I hope they relieve...

314
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,774
<i>Secret mission!</i>
<i>Intelligence!</i>

315
00:26:42,013 --> 00:26:44,140
<i>You are a liar!</i>

316
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:48,682
<i>Don't call, until you are</i>
<i>out of that filthy world!</i>

317
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:50,513
<i>Idiot!</i>

318
00:27:06,938 --> 00:27:08,530
Why are you here?

319
00:27:14,245 --> 00:27:16,110
I wanted to see you.

320
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:20,577
How are you?

321
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:25,821
Not well.

322
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:43,464
What will happen now?

323
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:56,987
Good morning.
It's General Collazos.

324
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:58,646
General, sir.

325
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,781
I read your request.

326
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:02,222
Yes, General.

327
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,190
I'm surprised at you.

328
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:10,996
You were selected for your managing
and military qualifications.

329
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:14,000
Remember our glorious predecessors...

330
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:17,174
Bolognesi, Ugarte, Caceres.

331
00:28:17,308 --> 00:28:22,837
<i>Did they surrender</i>
<i>when they faced adversity?</i>

332
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:28,009
No, sir. The true army man,
musters up his strength...

333
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:30,614
in the face of adversity.

334
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:34,350
<i>You are a soldier.</i>
<i>You must not surrender.</i>

335
00:28:34,592 --> 00:28:39,495
<i>You are to keep the service running.</i>
<i>Do I make myself clear?</i>

336
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:41,026
Good morning.

337
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:43,566
As you command, General.

338
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:49,565
He even approved the ten
new visitors I had requested.

339
00:28:50,441 --> 00:28:52,306
You see?

340
00:28:52,443 --> 00:28:54,138
You should be happy.

341
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,339
There'll be no stopping you.

342
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:04,213
Forty visitors.
Not bad at all, Captain.

343
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:07,288
I have many enemies.

344
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:09,821
My wife won't talk to me.

345
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:12,452
She'll come around, Captain.

346
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:15,996
And don't worry about Father Beltran.

347
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:18,125
<i>They've screwed him.</i>

348
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:23,898
<i>From head chaplain, he has gone</i>
<i>to parishioner at Iquitos cemetery.</i>

349
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:29,938
With your tenacity,
you'll be rid of your enemies...

350
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:34,285
I'm only worried
about that damned Sinchi...

351
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:37,521
If I were you, Captain...

352
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:40,417
I've been ordered
to silence him.

353
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,119
Great! My assistants
will silence him.

354
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:46,592
They know where to hit.

355
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:50,360
Not like that. It's worse.

356
00:30:16,861 --> 00:30:19,295
How's it going, dear Pantaleon?

357
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,465
One moment.

358
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:41,382
Wonderful view.
Congratulations.

359
00:30:42,887 --> 00:30:43,819
What?

360
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:47,882
You wanted to speak to me,
Mister Pantoja?

361
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,387
A wise decision.

362
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:54,530
People like us should not harm
each other.

363
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:58,227
It's a waste of time.

364
00:30:59,037 --> 00:31:01,801
I have not called you to talk...

365
00:31:07,645 --> 00:31:09,374
but to give you this.

366
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:15,747
You will open it...

367
00:31:17,221 --> 00:31:19,485
and tell me if it's enough.

368
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:35,637
Are you trying to bribe me?

369
00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:39,239
You threw me in the river.

370
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:43,345
And now you pay me
to speak well of your brothel?

371
00:31:45,783 --> 00:31:46,807
To not speak at all.

372
00:31:46,951 --> 00:31:50,045
To never again mention the service.

373
00:31:50,288 --> 00:31:52,722
I don't know, Mister Pantoja.

374
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:57,089
Pantyland is a very important
occurrence...

375
00:31:57,228 --> 00:32:00,095
of the end of the millennium.

376
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:05,635
CNN will want a chronicle.
That would get a great audience...

377
00:32:05,803 --> 00:32:10,740
Every month
you will receive an equal sum.

378
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:19,040
Now, you're talking, my friend!

379
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:25,451
I won't waste your time.

380
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,624
See you next month and...

381
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:31,257
If you wish,
and for no extra cost...

382
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:34,431
I could make a special broadcast...

383
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:36,826
to disprove some facts...

384
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:40,834
I made public against you
and could surely...

385
00:32:41,072 --> 00:32:42,835
See you next month.

386
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:01,482
You're not eating?

387
00:33:03,027 --> 00:33:05,461
I'm not that hungry.

388
00:33:07,498 --> 00:33:11,594
You've lost a lot of weight,
since your wife left.

389
00:33:11,903 --> 00:33:14,030
So I've been told.

390
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:18,872
Did they answer my report?

391
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:24,641
Due to the alarming presence
of civilians on the riverbanks...

392
00:33:24,882 --> 00:33:28,818
I propose the
"Ordinary Rotation System."

393
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,316
This will impede civilians
of estimating our arrival.

394
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,750
To function adequately...

395
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:42,159
the plan requires
100 visitors and 5 ships...

396
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,335
that would permanently
navigate the rivers.

397
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:47,833
100 visitors? 5 ships?

398
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:51,271
That's nothing, tiger.
Listen to this.

399
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:56,142
I propose a bonus for
the visitors on convoy...

400
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:00,146
considering they are
risking their lives.

401
00:34:00,284 --> 00:34:04,584
I attach to the project,
a social security plan...

402
00:34:04,822 --> 00:34:10,351
compensation for time served,
and other benefits...

403
00:34:10,595 --> 00:34:14,497
a worker is entitled to by law.

404
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:19,035
This isn't funny, Lopez.
This is starting to worry me.

405
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:25,072
Are we supposed to pay whores'
benefits and stop buying weapons?

406
00:34:25,209 --> 00:34:28,235
Your new plan is not authorized...

407
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:32,276
nor may you hire more visitors.

408
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:37,446
I don't understand.

409
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:42,182
You made the service too efficient.

410
00:34:42,326 --> 00:34:44,760
- They're scared.
- But, our goals!

411
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:47,589
Demand is way ahead of supply.

412
00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:50,058
Let things be.

413
00:34:51,335 --> 00:34:54,600
Relax and take a break.

414
00:34:54,972 --> 00:34:58,499
I will prepare
a more convincing report.

415
00:34:58,643 --> 00:35:01,077
I have the results
of the polls.

416
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:04,409
Now officers are asking
for the service.

417
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:10,653
95% of Captains and below
request visitors...

418
00:35:10,821 --> 00:35:12,652
and 55% of the higher ranks.

419
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:17,384
This service requires,
and that's still under the minimum...

420
00:35:17,628 --> 00:35:20,062
four vessels and 272 visitors.

421
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:23,196
Yes, but...

422
00:35:23,334 --> 00:35:28,067
It would be a special group
of visitors, from Lima or overseas.

423
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:31,534
The OS! That's Officers' Section.

424
00:35:31,676 --> 00:35:33,405
It sounds nice.

425
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:36,371
Exclusive Officers' service...

426
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:44,386
You're working too much.

427
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:46,752
You're going to be sick.

428
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:50,126
No task is worth your health.

429
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:54,290
First, you wanted to quit.
Now you're working to death.

430
00:35:54,765 --> 00:35:58,292
I resigned and was ordered
to continue.

431
00:35:58,536 --> 00:36:01,972
And I shall do so
against all odds because...

432
00:36:02,873 --> 00:36:04,465
it's all I know.

433
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:09,478
If only everybody was like you!

434
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:16,377
What do you say we go
to Nauta and relax?

435
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:22,119
Thanks, but I have a lot
of work backed up.

436
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:25,953
I'll turn in my project on Monday.
Don't get up.

437
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:51,287
She left most of her clothes.

438
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:56,892
Maybe she'll return.

439
00:36:59,997 --> 00:37:01,396
What do you think?

440
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,526
I don't know.

441
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:14,240
I would never buy this.

442
00:37:28,492 --> 00:37:31,120
Is this how decent ladies sleep?

443
00:37:41,372 --> 00:37:43,738
I look like a nun.

444
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:47,636
Do you like me better this way?

445
00:37:50,715 --> 00:37:52,273
What's the matter?

446
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:56,785
Don't you know?
Can't you tell?

447
00:37:56,921 --> 00:37:59,151
Is this about tomorrow?

448
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,187
Not just tomorrow.

449
00:38:01,325 --> 00:38:03,259
I don't want to work.

450
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:07,123
I want to be with you.

451
00:38:08,466 --> 00:38:11,458
We are facing a crisis.

452
00:38:11,602 --> 00:38:14,469
I have to convince my boss.

453
00:38:14,705 --> 00:38:17,503
And you are fussing about work!

454
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:23,942
I'm just saying the boss's woman
always gets treated better.

455
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:27,577
But not me.

456
00:38:27,718 --> 00:38:30,482
You treat me like a whore.

457
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:37,928
Are you with me,
because I'm the boss?

458
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:41,631
What do you think?

459
00:38:47,104 --> 00:38:48,935
I'd rather not know.

460
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:54,210
Fire me, Panta.

461
00:38:56,013 --> 00:38:58,243
End this.

462
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:03,750
You want that?

463
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:27,835
<i>Good morning,</i>
<i>to all my Amazon friends...</i>

464
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:30,672
<i>listening to this program...</i>

465
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:36,845
<i>throughout the farthest corners</i>
<i>of our jungle.</i>

466
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:42,052
<i>Today I wish to speak about</i>
<i>Mister Pantaleon Pantoja.</i>

467
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:45,524
- Turn it off!
- No, I want to hear.

468
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:48,357
<i>Gentlemen admit their mistakes...</i>

469
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,433
<i>so I say this from</i>
<i>the bottom of my heart:</i>

470
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:56,872
<i>I misjudged you, Mister Panta.</i>

471
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:03,878
Letters signed by
the very soldiers and Sergeants...

472
00:40:04,281 --> 00:40:09,548
that patrol our borders
keep pouring in...

473
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:13,223
and in them they tell me:
Mister Sinchi...

474
00:40:13,491 --> 00:40:16,392
why do you insult Mister Pantaleon?

475
00:40:16,527 --> 00:40:18,392
Get ready, girls.

476
00:40:18,629 --> 00:40:23,032
<i>Nobody has ever done for us</i>
<i>what he is doing.</i>

477
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,791
<i>We have needs. And thanks...</i>

478
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:29,371
<i>to Mister Panta</i>
<i>we serve our country better.</i>

479
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,201
<i>These sincere comments</i>
<i>made me think.</i>

480
00:40:33,444 --> 00:40:37,847
<i>When I denounced Pantoja,</i>
<i>I forgot about the soldiers...</i>

481
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:40,950
and about the commendable mission...

482
00:40:41,218 --> 00:40:46,554
that Mister Pantaleon
has been carrying out to satisfy...

483
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:50,692
the needs of Peru's sentinels.

484
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:54,422
Attention Horcones post.
We're approaching.

485
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:57,759
Arrival in ten minutes.
I repeat...

486
00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:14,909
Horcones!
We are being hijacked!

487
00:41:15,152 --> 00:41:19,350
Horcones, do you copy, damn it?

488
00:41:20,157 --> 00:41:22,751
This is the Eva!
May day!

489
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:28,957
Mister Panta, as he has fondly
come to be known in our jungle...

490
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,895
does not look for fame
or recognition...

491
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:44,146
Spread your legs!

492
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:49,947
Dear friends, I have in my hands
a report from the police.

493
00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:56,284
Do you know how many rapes
have been reported...

494
00:41:56,627 --> 00:41:59,152
since Mister Panta...

495
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:03,298
started the Visitors' Service?

496
00:42:03,434 --> 00:42:08,462
Zero!
You heard right, zero!

497
00:42:14,778 --> 00:42:16,609
Shit! Soldiers!

498
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,379
Damned soldiers!

499
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:46,740
Our jungle is calm.

500
00:42:46,877 --> 00:42:50,745
<i>Our mothers, sisters and girlfriends...</i>

501
00:42:50,981 --> 00:42:54,712
<i>can now walk the streets</i>
<i>without fear.</i>

502
00:42:57,121 --> 00:43:01,854
<i>The people of Loreto</i>
<i>can take pride in living...</i>

503
00:43:02,092 --> 00:43:04,788
<i>in the only place in the world...</i>

504
00:43:05,029 --> 00:43:09,762
<i>where sexual crimes</i>
<i>are no more.</i>

505
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:14,564
Emotion overwhelms me
and I speak for myself...

506
00:43:14,805 --> 00:43:18,536
as for the whole Amazon region
when I say:

507
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:20,901
Thank you, Mister Panta.

508
00:43:21,145 --> 00:43:25,741
Thanks to you
and to your valiant ladies.

509
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:36,251
Could you please leave me alone?

510
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:41,456
<i>Mourned through the night...</i>

511
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:46,995
the mauled body of Olga Arellano,
also known as Colombiana...

512
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:50,491
reaches its final resting place.

513
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:52,929
This is The Sinchi...

514
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:56,203
we are at the Cemetery...

515
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,136
and many people have attended.

516
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:03,146
The coffin is approaching
its final place...

517
00:45:03,413 --> 00:45:07,349
accompanied by a military escort.

518
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:11,349
Yes indeed,
a military escort and an officer.

519
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:33,099
At ease!

520
00:45:47,257 --> 00:45:49,020
I am resurrection and life.

521
00:45:49,259 --> 00:45:53,753
Those that live in me
shall not die eternally.

522
00:45:55,098 --> 00:45:58,829
Lord, receive this sinner
and grant her...

523
00:45:58,969 --> 00:46:01,403
eternal rest.

524
00:46:01,672 --> 00:46:03,367
Lord, hear our prayer.

525
00:46:35,572 --> 00:46:37,005
Olga Arellano...

526
00:46:38,642 --> 00:46:42,271
we wear our glorious Peruvian uniform...

527
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:46,141
to mourn you.

528
00:46:47,885 --> 00:46:51,286
It is our duty
to make known to the world...

529
00:46:51,521 --> 00:46:54,752
with a full sense of responsibility...

530
00:46:56,026 --> 00:46:59,427
that you have fallen
in the line of duty.

531
00:47:01,598 --> 00:47:03,259
You are a martyr...

532
00:47:04,735 --> 00:47:09,263
consecrated to serving
the soldiers of Peru.

533
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:16,079
Beloved Olga Arellano.

534
00:47:16,914 --> 00:47:18,347
Your soldiers...

535
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:22,714
spread through the Amazon region...

536
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,984
whose lives you enlightened...

537
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:29,024
weep for you.

538
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,324
Your coworkers weep for you too.

539
00:47:34,932 --> 00:47:36,991
In their name I tell you...

540
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:40,631
your sacrifice was not in vain.

541
00:47:41,805 --> 00:47:46,640
It will motivate us
in our army-given mission.

542
00:47:51,381 --> 00:47:53,076
Personally...

543
00:47:55,419 --> 00:47:59,219
allow me to thank you deeply...

544
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:04,059
for so many tokens of affection...

545
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:09,196
for so many intimate lessons...

546
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:12,430
that I shall never forget.

547
00:48:14,738 --> 00:48:16,433
Olga Arellano...

548
00:48:17,674 --> 00:48:19,801
rest in peace.

549
00:48:20,677 --> 00:48:22,907
Attention!

550
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,214
Present arms!

551
00:48:53,143 --> 00:48:54,906
Get out of the army...

552
00:48:55,045 --> 00:48:57,775
and stay with us.

553
00:48:58,015 --> 00:49:00,984
We have a small sum
we wish to invest.

554
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:03,881
We could even apply for a loan.

555
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:06,717
With your brains, we'd be...

556
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:08,654
rich in no time.

557
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:11,619
I was ordered
to organize the service.

558
00:49:12,362 --> 00:49:15,525
It's not a business interest.

559
00:49:16,566 --> 00:49:18,431
Start your own business.

560
00:49:18,668 --> 00:49:21,068
We don't want another brothel.

561
00:49:21,204 --> 00:49:24,002
We want a company of visitors.

562
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:26,641
A modern, efficient company.

563
00:49:27,077 --> 00:49:28,442
You'd be the boss.

564
00:49:32,616 --> 00:49:34,550
I need to have bosses.

565
00:49:35,185 --> 00:49:36,846
If I don't have them...

566
00:49:39,122 --> 00:49:40,885
I don't know what to do.

567
00:49:41,124 --> 00:49:43,592
I'm made to obey orders.

568
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:47,123
My calling is the army...

569
00:49:47,264 --> 00:49:49,732
and I wish to die a soldier.

570
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:52,702
You must understand that.

571
00:49:54,371 --> 00:49:57,636
What is it, Chuchupe?
I said no crying.

572
00:49:58,075 --> 00:50:01,408
Forgive me, but I can't help myself.

573
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:06,014
It's the best job I've had.
Why do they shut it down?

574
00:50:06,149 --> 00:50:09,744
The soldiers were so happy.

575
00:50:11,088 --> 00:50:14,524
The goals were being reached
perfectly...

576
00:50:17,227 --> 00:50:19,092
but that's the army.

577
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:22,196
The bosses know best.

578
00:50:26,236 --> 00:50:28,830
Lighten up, Chuchupe.

579
00:50:55,132 --> 00:50:58,533
Excuse me, miss.
Maybe there's a mix-up.

580
00:50:58,768 --> 00:51:01,828
My appointment was at six.
Must I still wait?

581
00:51:02,105 --> 00:51:03,732
Yes.

582
00:51:03,974 --> 00:51:07,603
They're interviewing the General.

583
00:51:09,713 --> 00:51:13,308
Look, it's starting!

584
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,214
<i>Miss, the army has never sponsored...</i>

585
00:51:16,453 --> 00:51:19,581
<i>or financed such an enterprise.</i>

586
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:23,420
<i>You deny the existence</i>
<i>of the service?</i>

587
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:27,155
<i>Of course I do, miss.</i>
<i>Categorically.</i>

588
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:29,697
<i>We've seen Captain Pantoja...</i>

589
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:31,528
<i>giving military honors...</i>

590
00:51:31,668 --> 00:51:36,071
<i>to a prostitute.</i>
<i>He stated that the murderers...</i>

591
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:38,332
<i>should be court-martialed.</i>

592
00:51:38,475 --> 00:51:40,067
<i>Miss, those ideas...</i>

593
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,110
<i>don't hold water.</i>

594
00:51:42,245 --> 00:51:44,713
<i>High Command</i>
<i>has ordered an investigation...</i>

595
00:51:44,981 --> 00:51:47,074
<i>to the last consequences.</i>

596
00:51:48,018 --> 00:51:49,178
<i>And I assure you...</i>

597
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:53,779
<i>that those responsible</i>
<i>will be punished.</i>

598
00:51:54,057 --> 00:51:56,287
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Studios.</i>

599
00:51:57,227 --> 00:51:58,888
You're famous.

600
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,696
Could I have your autograph?

601
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:15,975
You know who just left?

602
00:52:16,112 --> 00:52:20,481
Yes, General, sir.
I saw the interview.

603
00:52:20,717 --> 00:52:22,810
I want no explanations.

604
00:52:23,286 --> 00:52:26,619
I saw you giving
your pathetic address.

605
00:52:26,856 --> 00:52:29,154
Whatever!
You went mad and...

606
00:52:29,392 --> 00:52:33,886
honestly, there is
no punishment severe enough...

607
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:37,397
for your acts.
Not even a firing squad.

608
00:52:37,634 --> 00:52:41,502
I alone am responsible.
I accept any punishment.

609
00:52:42,305 --> 00:52:46,571
You will go before
a disciplinary council, Pantoja.

610
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:51,047
That means you will be expelled.

611
00:52:51,548 --> 00:52:53,482
Because of your record...

612
00:52:54,417 --> 00:52:57,386
we offer you a more dignified exit:

613
00:52:58,488 --> 00:53:01,252
Ask to be discharged tomorrow.

614
00:53:04,628 --> 00:53:06,755
I will not, sir.

615
00:53:06,896 --> 00:53:11,333
Your career is over.
You committed professional suicide.

616
00:53:11,768 --> 00:53:13,759
Work as a civilian.

617
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:17,606
Your managing talent
can't be denied.

618
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:20,537
You'll make more money.

619
00:53:23,113 --> 00:53:26,105
Are you crying, Pantoja?

620
00:53:26,283 --> 00:53:28,217
Be a man, damn it!

621
00:53:28,451 --> 00:53:32,547
I beg you excuse
my weakness, General, sir.

622
00:53:33,923 --> 00:53:36,357
But I can only be a soldier...

623
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,056
it's my life.
If you make me leave...

624
00:53:44,434 --> 00:53:47,369
Do you wish to remain
a Captain forever?

625
00:53:47,504 --> 00:53:51,804
This will stain your record for life.

626
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,908
I will try to redeem myself.

627
00:53:56,046 --> 00:53:58,879
You don't wish to be discharged?

628
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,018
We'll make it tough on you.

629
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:05,052
You know how that is.

630
00:54:05,622 --> 00:54:08,955
I know.
I'll withstand anything.

631
00:54:44,527 --> 00:54:49,157
<i>My responsibilities impeded me</i>
<i>from answering earlier.</i>

632
00:54:53,436 --> 00:54:57,930
<i>My wife, my daughter, Marina,</i>
<i>who is a beauty...</i>

633
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:03,009
<i>and my mission are my main</i>
<i>distractions and companions.</i>

634
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,514
<i>Regardless of distance...</i>

635
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:10,377
<i>I remember you with affection.</i>

636
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:14,818
Give my regards to Mrs. Leonor
and Chupito...

637
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:18,691
to Pechuga and the rest
of my ex-visitors...

638
00:55:18,928 --> 00:55:21,328
whom I never will forget.

639
00:55:21,965 --> 00:55:26,902
Receive a warm hug from
your friend, Pantaleon Pantoja...

640
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:30,005
Peruvian Army Captain.

641
00:55:32,308 --> 00:55:35,800
Read it again, please.
It's so beautiful.

642
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:44,650
Lieutenant.

643
00:55:45,955 --> 00:55:47,923
I write this letter...

644
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:50,355
at four degrees below zero.

645
00:55:50,493 --> 00:55:52,757
Collazos sent me...

646
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:56,423
to an isolated post.

647
00:55:56,566 --> 00:55:58,557
<i>My mission is to carry out...</i>

648
00:55:58,835 --> 00:56:02,236
<i>social labor</i>
<i>in the area of literacy.</i>

649
00:56:03,506 --> 00:56:07,340
<i>The 1973 census</i>
<i>recorded 1'784,281...</i>

650
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:09,069
<i>illiterate individuals...</i>

651
00:56:09,312 --> 00:56:13,578
<i>and this region had the lowest</i>
<i>literacy rate in the country:</i>

652
00:56:13,983 --> 00:56:15,541
<i>36.9%.</i>

653
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:19,755
<i>Which means 658,399 illiterate.</i>

654
00:56:22,959 --> 00:56:25,985
I... love...

655
00:56:26,262 --> 00:56:29,356
my... Peru.

656
00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:34,061
<i>According to estimates,</i>
<i>an adult with an IQ...</i>

657
00:56:34,204 --> 00:56:38,368
<i>not under 80 learns to read</i>
<i>in 6 to 9 months.</i>

658
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:40,703
See you tomorrow.

659
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:42,175
Very good.

660
00:56:42,312 --> 00:56:46,544
<i>I've formed eight groups of fifteen...</i>

661
00:56:46,783 --> 00:56:49,377
<i>which comes to 120 students.</i>

662
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,210
<i>Being optimistic...</i>

663
00:56:52,388 --> 00:56:55,755
<i>illiteracy will be eradicated</i>
<i>in 6 years.</i>

664
00:56:56,459 --> 00:57:00,555
<i>I continue to serve</i>
<i>our glorious institution...</i>

665
00:57:00,697 --> 00:57:02,824
<i>with dedication.</i>

666
00:57:06,202 --> 00:57:08,170
Are you finished?

667
00:57:08,338 --> 00:57:10,602
There's a group at six.

668
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,774
Absenteeism is high...

669
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:16,103
that could invalidate my estimates.

670
00:57:16,346 --> 00:57:18,473
I'll make house calls.

671
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:21,513
You can't stop working!

672
00:57:21,751 --> 00:57:22,945
Let's go home.

673
00:57:23,086 --> 00:57:25,350
I'll be right with you.

674
00:57:28,224 --> 00:57:30,749
I hate your smoking habit.

675
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:34,428
It's because of the cold, Pocha.

676
00:57:34,664 --> 00:57:37,462
I'll be in the house.
Don't be long...
