1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,660
<i>From time immemorial,
the Earth has been bombarded</i>

2
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:17,223
<i>by objects from outer space.</i>

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,493
<i>Bits and pieces
of the universe,</i>

4
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:23,431
<i>piercing our atmosphere in
an invasion that never ends.</i>

5
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:26,391
<i>Meteors, the shooting stars</i>

6
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:29,330
<i>on which so many
earthly wishes have been born.</i>

7
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:32,954
<i>Of the thousands
that plummet toward us,</i>

8
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:36,261
<i>the greater part
are destroyed in a fiery flash</i>

9
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,265
<i>as they strike the layers
of air that encircle us.</i>

10
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:42,596
<i>Only a small percentage
survives.</i>

11
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:47,623
<i>Most of these fall into the water,
which covers two-thirds of our world.</i>

12
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:51,721
<i>But from time to time,
from the beginning of time,</i>

13
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:56,355
<i>a very few meteors have struck the
crust of the Earth and formed craters.</i>

14
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,456
<i>Craters of all sizes,</i>

15
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:02,464
<i>sought after and poured over
by scientists of all nations</i>

16
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:05,327
<i>for the priceless knowledge
buried within them.</i>

17
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:10,627
<i>In every moment of every day,
they come,</i>

18
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:13,187
<i>from planets
belonging to stars</i>

19
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:16,026
<i>whose dying light
is too far away to be seen.</i>

20
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:18,827
<i>From infinity they come.</i>

21
00:01:19,198 --> 00:01:20,391
<i>Meteors.</i>

22
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,863
<i>Another strange calling card from
the limitless reaches of space.</i>

23
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:42,693
<i>Its substance unknown,
its secrets unexplored,</i>

24
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:45,923
<i>the meteor lies dormant
in the night, waiting.</i>

25
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,115
Ben?

26
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,451
Who's that? Mr. Cochrane?

27
00:06:14,523 --> 00:06:16,079
Yeah.
Come on in.

28
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,852
Looking for Dave?
Mmm-hmm.

29
00:06:18,924 --> 00:06:21,411
Haven't seen him around
in a couple of days.

30
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:23,352
Is everything all right? Sure.

31
00:06:23,422 --> 00:06:27,377
He had to go to Bakersfield, that's
all. He'll be back tomorrow sometime.

32
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,978
Weird, isn't it?
What's it called?

33
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:33,613
Beats me. I haven't even
figured out what the stuff is.

34
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:36,153
Where'd it come from?
The old San Angelo Road.

35
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:38,518
There's a whole flock
of it out there.

36
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:48,687
Lava, maybe?
No, it's a solid.

37
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:51,986
You can see strata,
if you look closely.

38
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:56,117
They must've skipped
this one in college.

39
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,484
Well, either that, or you slept
through one class too many.

40
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:02,820
Yeah, it'll probably turn out
to be an ordinary aggregate,

41
00:07:02,888 --> 00:07:05,150
something simple
I'm unfamiliar with.

42
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:08,783
Still, somehow, it just doesn't
seem to belong, you know?

43
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:12,678
The desert's full of
things that don't belong.

44
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:15,653
Take the salt flats out there,
used to be an ocean bed.

45
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,914
Now, that ocean knew
that the middle of the desert

46
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:22,386
was a pretty silly place for it to
be, so it just dried up and went away.

47
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:24,746
But if it hadn't
been there once,

48
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,377
there wouldn't be
a salt mine out there now.

49
00:07:26,454 --> 00:07:29,046
Without that, there probably
wouldn't even be a town.

50
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:30,484
Then there's me.

51
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:32,676
You?

52
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:35,751
I don't belong here either.
I never did.

53
00:07:36,153 --> 00:07:40,210
San Angelo needs a newspaper like that
desert needs another bucket of sand.

54
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,549
Now, I ask you,
what good is a newspaperman

55
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:46,315
in a place like this, when nothing
ever happens worth writing about?

56
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:48,075
Say,

57
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,682
maybe I ought to be a geologist
like you and Dave, huh?

58
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:54,375
I've been stuck here
among rocks so long,

59
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:57,817
all I'd need is a refresher
course and I bet I'd be all right.

60
00:07:57,886 --> 00:07:59,909
No, you stick
to your newspaper.

61
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:02,917
Who knows? Maybe I've just
discovered something new here.

62
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:06,010
And you can write a
world-shattering article about it.

63
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,616
I doubt if there's
even anything new, Ben.

64
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:13,482
A few things we haven't understood
yet, but nothing that's really new.

65
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:00,909
Morning.

66
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,904
Ben.

67
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:27,870
Hey, Ben.

68
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:44,475
Hi, this is Dave Miller. Is
Miss Barrett still at school?

69
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:47,808
She took the kids where?

70
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,207
The desert?

71
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,243
Isn't she afraid they'll roast
out there on a day like this?

72
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:56,303
No, I'll call her at home.
Thanks.

73
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:00,637
Ben!

74
00:11:57,846 --> 00:11:58,835
Ben.

75
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,578
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

76
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:24,678
What is this, a field
trip or a riot? Goodness.

77
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,739
That's better.

78
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,602
Now, I want you all
to remember

79
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,872
not to touch anything
that you don't recognize,

80
00:12:30,946 --> 00:12:33,376
and I don't want anyone
wandering too far from the car.

81
00:12:33,445 --> 00:12:34,843
Do you understand?
Mmm-hmm.

82
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:37,234
Okay, explode.

83
00:12:53,712 --> 00:12:56,075
Find something, Ginny?
Lizards.

84
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:02,233
Do they live there
together, Miss Barrett?

85
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:06,141
Well, why don't you ask them?
Maybe they're husband and wife.

86
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:09,806
Lizards don't get married,
do they?

87
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,842
Well, maybe not the same way
that people do.

88
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:16,708
Maybe they just like to be
together, like you and Mr. Miller.

89
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:20,001
Well, yes, I suppose so.

90
00:13:20,377 --> 00:13:22,935
Why don't you
and Mr. Miller get married?

91
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,476
Why, Ginny!

92
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:27,009
Well, gee, you love him, don't you?

93
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:29,270
Whatever gave you
such an idea?

94
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:33,105
The way you look at him when
he stops for you at school.

95
00:13:33,176 --> 00:13:36,438
Mother looks at Daddy
like that and she loves him.

96
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:41,603
You don't miss much, do you?
I like Mr. Miller.

97
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:45,066
Well, confidentially, so do I.

98
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:46,369
Miss Barrett.

99
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:40,833
Bye.
Bye!

100
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:43,236
Bye, Miss Barrett.
Bye, Ginny.

101
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:44,774
Thanks, Miss Barrett.
Hello, Mrs. Simpson.

102
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,807
Hi.
Hi, yourself. Have fun?

103
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,666
Uh-huh. Miss Barrett taught us
all about the irrigation dam,

104
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:53,263
and the San Angelo Canyon,
and we saw some lizards...

105
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:55,637
Whoa there! What's this?
It's from the desert.

106
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,834
That's where it stays.
Outside.

107
00:14:57,908 --> 00:15:00,304
Mom, it's a souvenir.

108
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:03,535
Well, I can live without dirty old
souvenirs messing up my clean house.

109
00:15:03,608 --> 00:15:04,699
Oh, Mom.

110
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:07,239
And your hands could stand
a good washing off.

111
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:09,568
Hurry up, now.
Supper's almost on the table.

112
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,073
Okay.

113
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:30,536
Ginny, we're waiting.
Just a sec, Mom.

114
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:33,573
Young lady, get in here
right now. Yes, ma'am.

115
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:49,638
I've never known an autopsy
to take this long before.

116
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:55,902
Dan, I've just called the
Medical Research Institute.

117
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:58,201
I'm shipping Ben's body
to them in the morning.

118
00:15:58,273 --> 00:15:59,500
Why, Doc?

119
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:02,869
They might be able to tell us
what happened to him. I can't.

120
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:07,204
At first I thought it
could have been scleroderma,

121
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:09,363
an extreme hardening
of the skin.

122
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:14,096
But his entire body, organs,
skin, muscle tissue, everything,

123
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:16,832
he's been welded
into a solid mass.

124
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:19,695
Doc, you must have
found something.

125
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:21,896
That'd lead me to the cause?
Yes.

126
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:24,530
Not a thing, David.
There's nothing to go on.

127
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:27,799
It's not as if he'd been ill,
shown symptoms...

128
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:34,299
An intern with wet ears could've
told you as much as I been able to.

129
00:16:34,372 --> 00:16:36,996
It'll take a specialist
to tell you any more.

130
00:16:37,338 --> 00:16:38,430
I'm sorry.

131
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:41,901
What am I supposed to print?

132
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:45,263
Well, you can't print
anything. Not about this.

133
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,066
Can't print?

134
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:49,036
Look, I was a friend
of Ben's, too.

135
00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:51,036
I'm just as sorry this
happened to him as anybody.

136
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:52,866
But I'm a newspaperman
and this is news.

137
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:55,801
All right, go ahead. And just what
do you think you can say about it?

138
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,529
"Local geologist
turns to rock.

139
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,467
"Autopsy fails
to turn up reason. "

140
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:00,834
You'd have the whole town
in a panic,

141
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:03,631
thinking some horrible disease
is running loose.

142
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,437
It's a funny thing.

143
00:17:06,304 --> 00:17:10,600
Last time I saw Ben, he was kidding
about making a new discovery,

144
00:17:12,037 --> 00:17:14,025
so I'd have
something to print.

145
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:17,637
Well, he came up with a story,
all right.

146
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,300
But if I print it, I get run
out of town for inciting a riot.

147
00:17:22,402 --> 00:17:26,460
Or maybe for writing a crackpot
yarn nobody'd believe anyway.

148
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:29,060
I think there's more to this than just Ben.

149
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,995
What do you mean? The
condition the lab was in.

150
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,729
Something tore it to pieces,
almost wrecked it.

151
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,268
An explosion, wasn't it?

152
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:38,962
Well, if so, it had nothing
to do with Ben's death.

153
00:17:39,036 --> 00:17:41,126
There weren't any flash burns
on the body,

154
00:17:41,203 --> 00:17:43,828
no signs of exposure
to a blast of any kind.

155
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:47,468
It may have happened before,
Dave, or even afterwards.

156
00:17:47,603 --> 00:17:50,933
I don't think it was an
explosion. What are you getting at?

157
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:54,963
This stuff. It was all over the wreckage.

158
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,635
But I don't know what it is.

159
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,931
Well, that's the rock I told
you Ben brought in yesterday.

160
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:04,067
Or one like it.
You told us one piece.

161
00:18:04,602 --> 00:18:05,626
Yeah.

162
00:18:05,703 --> 00:18:09,601
Wait a minute. The lab's covered with
it. There must be hundreds of pounds.

163
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:12,430
How'd it get there?
May I see that?

164
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:17,798
Today out in the desert,

165
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:21,664
one of my children picked up
some of this on our field trip.

166
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:23,394
Ginny, Ginny Simpson.

167
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:26,424
She had it with her in the car
on the way back.

168
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:28,830
I remember thinking
how strange it looked.

169
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,925
Are you sure
it's the same rock?

170
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:32,958
It looked the same.

171
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:35,859
Then she'd have it at home now,
wouldn't she?

172
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:36,923
Yes.

173
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:39,832
Look, I'm not saying it does,

174
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:43,727
but if Ben's death and the rock
had something to do with each other,

175
00:18:44,134 --> 00:18:45,929
and now the little girl's
got some...

176
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,899
We don't know any such thing.

177
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:50,565
Might not even be
the same rock at all.

178
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:52,332
I hope it isn't.

179
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,995
But we'll never find out
until we go see for ourselves.

180
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,125
"Simpson," you said?

181
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:59,359
Isn't that the family out
past Pour Corners? Yeah.

182
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:01,161
You're going out there
at this time of night?

183
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:02,996
I think we'd better.
Dave.

184
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,831
Dave, I don't like
what you're thinking.

185
00:19:07,368 --> 00:19:09,095
I'm not thinking a thing.

186
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:13,056
Just want an excuse to take you
for a nice, long ride, that's all.

187
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:17,154
Well, that's the first pleasant
idea I've heard this evening.

188
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,688
Come on.

189
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:07,719
Ginny.

190
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:00,819
Ginny.

191
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,255
Ginny. Oh, Ginny, darling.

192
00:21:11,164 --> 00:21:12,220
Ginny?

193
00:21:58,596 --> 00:21:59,857
Just like Ben.

194
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:03,087
Their bodies
have turned to stone.

195
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:37,949
I'd better stay put.

196
00:22:40,728 --> 00:22:43,386
You'll need this.
Thanks. Oh, and Dave...

197
00:23:36,826 --> 00:23:38,849
Pretty deep in shock,
isn't she?

198
00:23:39,092 --> 00:23:42,081
Well, that much is normal,
but... High temperature?

199
00:23:42,825 --> 00:23:46,054
A child her age gets a fever
at the slightest provocation,

200
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,249
but her temperature's
subnormal.

201
00:23:57,226 --> 00:24:00,056
Sometimes shock can
almost be a merciful thing.

202
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:17,082
Martin.

203
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,517
Hmm?

204
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,056
What's the trouble?

205
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,279
This.

206
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,747
There's a negative cleavage
on every mineral in there.

207
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:27,714
Negative cleavage?
Yeah. See for yourself.

208
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:32,490
Not one positive extinction
point in the whole thing.

209
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:34,084
Well, yeah.

210
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,379
I guess.

211
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:41,050
And look at this, I made a breakdown
of the rock we found here in the lab.

212
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,251
With the exception
of a trace of iron phosphate,

213
00:24:44,324 --> 00:24:46,756
not enough to mention,
they're all silicates.

214
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:51,222
Chert, feldspar, pyroxene,
almost all of the olivine group,

215
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,450
flint, almost solid silica.

216
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:57,751
Little bits of it slapped together in
such a way that it shouldn't even exist.

217
00:24:58,891 --> 00:25:00,288
What do you think?

218
00:25:00,924 --> 00:25:02,446
Well, I think it...

219
00:25:05,357 --> 00:25:08,413
I think I better stick
to the newspaper business.

220
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:09,546
What?

221
00:25:09,623 --> 00:25:11,385
I'll need more than just
a refresher course

222
00:25:11,457 --> 00:25:13,548
before I even know
what you're talking about.

223
00:25:13,623 --> 00:25:17,647
Oh, I'm sorry. It doesn't
make much sense to me, either.

224
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:21,683
Let's see how the Simpson
rock compares with it.

225
00:25:27,789 --> 00:25:28,879
Identical.

226
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:32,586
The two specimens
are exactly the same.

227
00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:36,250
I don't know.

228
00:25:36,855 --> 00:25:39,378
Ben brings home
a sample and it multiplies.

229
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:43,212
Ginny Simpson picks up a piece
and there's tons of it.

230
00:25:44,223 --> 00:25:47,780
Ordinary silica, the most
common material you can find,

231
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:50,343
and yet everywhere this
stuff goes, somebody dies.

232
00:25:50,422 --> 00:25:54,116
The trouble is, we don't even know who
else might have picked up a piece of it.

233
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:55,552
Tourists, maybe.

234
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:58,286
Why, they could carry it
to every part of the country.

235
00:25:58,355 --> 00:25:59,343
Yeah.

236
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:01,946
Well, at the rate this stuff
spreads destruction, Martin,

237
00:26:02,022 --> 00:26:06,249
when you write your story, there
may not be anybody around to read it.

238
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:10,310
Probably won't print it,
anyway.

239
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:13,050
Couldn't spell the words.

240
00:26:24,522 --> 00:26:25,510
Yeah?

241
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:26,747
Dave, this is Dr. Reynolds.

242
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:29,116
<i>Yes, Doctor? Dave, I
want you to do something for me.</i>

243
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:31,551
Find someone who can make
a fast trip to Los Angeles

244
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:34,781
I want to get Ginny to the
California Medical Research Institute.

245
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:36,716
Ginny? Is she worse?

246
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:37,844
Yes.

247
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,886
I've made arrangements with a young
specialist there, Dr. Hendricks.

248
00:26:40,954 --> 00:26:41,941
He'll take over.

249
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:43,646
Okay. I'll take her myself.

250
00:26:43,721 --> 00:26:45,017
<i>Good. When can you leave?</i>

251
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:47,018
<i>Right away.
Then get on over here.</i>

252
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:49,610
Wait a minute. How bad is it?

253
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:52,381
<i>Her hand has turned to stone
and it's spreading.</i>

254
00:26:52,454 --> 00:26:55,386
<i>Ginny has to reach that
hospital as quickly as possible.</i>

255
00:26:55,454 --> 00:26:57,579
It's her one chance
to survive.

256
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:17,817
Dr. Hendricks is ready for you
in the examining room.

257
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:27,840
You can see how the pectoral
muscles became paralyzed.

258
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:29,940
The disease merely
followed the main arteries,

259
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:32,574
through the arms
into the upper chest cavity.

260
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:36,542
Well, will it keep spreading
until her whole body's affected?

261
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,212
Unless we can slow it down.

262
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:40,472
Can you?

263
00:28:44,517 --> 00:28:48,506
We're asking you to save her life,
Doctor. That's why we brought her here.

264
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,874
Miss Barrett, I can't cope with
something I don't even understand.

265
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:55,246
Then what are you going to do? Cathy!

266
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:58,515
He won't know himself until he
finds out what he's fighting.

267
00:28:58,584 --> 00:29:01,641
But, Dave, Ginny's dying.
We're trying to avoid that.

268
00:29:01,717 --> 00:29:04,113
Pinpoint the reason
in time to save her.

269
00:29:05,617 --> 00:29:06,980
Is that the rock?

270
00:29:08,116 --> 00:29:11,514
Thought I'd take it across the
way in the morning, to the college.

271
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,378
There's an old professor
of mine there, Flanders.

272
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,404
He might make some sense out
of all this. Get him out of bed.

273
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:20,476
Take it to him, now.

274
00:29:30,482 --> 00:29:31,505
Incredible.

275
00:29:31,582 --> 00:29:35,036
As if someone tossed all the
silicates into a single wastebasket.

276
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:36,478
Some wastebasket.

277
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:39,440
What beats me
is it's completely unknown.

278
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:41,709
Nothing like it's
been recorded in there.

279
00:29:41,783 --> 00:29:43,805
That could be the answer.
What?

280
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,939
What if it's never been recorded
because it hasn't been here to record?

281
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:48,641
What do you mean?
It's a meteorite, I think.

282
00:29:48,716 --> 00:29:50,112
You're kidding!
Why not, Dave?

283
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:53,613
Lts contents tally exactly with the
makeup of an aerolite stony-iron meteorite

284
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:55,341
composed entirely
of silicates.

285
00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:58,869
It couldn't be a meteorite. We
didn't find just this one rock.

286
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:01,279
There's a ton of that stuff
in my lab, hundreds of pieces.

287
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:02,973
And the Simpson ranch
is covered with it.

288
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:05,344
We can't expect to solve
all of its mysteries at once.

289
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:06,506
Professor!

290
00:30:06,782 --> 00:30:09,441
All I want to know is how
to keep it from multiplying.

291
00:30:09,515 --> 00:30:11,775
It's killed or injured everyone
who's come in contact with it,

292
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:13,870
and that kid's gonna die if
we don't give them an answer!

293
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:14,972
Dave.

294
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:16,275
If it is a meteorite,

295
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,473
chances are it's been hurtling around
our universe for a good many centuries.

296
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:22,775
The answer to your question
lies buried in those centuries.

297
00:30:22,846 --> 00:30:24,779
We'll just have to dig it out.

298
00:30:26,248 --> 00:30:27,338
I'm sorry.

299
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:33,572
It'll break Cathy's heart if
anything happens to that little girl.

300
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,068
Where do we start?
The places it happened,

301
00:30:36,146 --> 00:30:37,375
your lab and
the Simpson ranch.

302
00:30:37,448 --> 00:30:39,436
I want to go out there
with you to see them,

303
00:30:39,514 --> 00:30:43,708
then let's try to locate that
parent meteor, if there is one.

304
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:45,245
When can you leave?

305
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:46,944
I'm all packed.

306
00:30:53,012 --> 00:30:54,410
What is it, honey?

307
00:30:55,347 --> 00:30:58,074
Dr. Hendricks says
another eight hours,

308
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:01,840
maybe.
And maybe not?

309
00:31:02,813 --> 00:31:04,540
Maybe not.

310
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:10,442
She's different
from the others, Dave.

311
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:12,509
Kind of special.

312
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:16,707
You want to stay with her?

313
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:21,243
Let me know the minute there's
a change. Any kind of a change.

314
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:24,234
I'll call you
if we come up with anything.

315
00:31:24,579 --> 00:31:28,342
You be careful, Dave, because
you're kind of special, too.

316
00:31:38,078 --> 00:31:39,476
Hi, Dave.
Hi.

317
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,110
How was the trip?
All right.

318
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:45,371
Chief, Professor Flanders.
Chief of Police Corey.

319
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,411
How do you do, Professor?
Chief. Excuse me, please.

320
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:53,069
How's the Simpson kid?
She's alive, that's about all.

321
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,008
Anything new here?
Yeah.

322
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:57,908
We can rule out the explosion
idea. There wasn't any.

323
00:31:57,978 --> 00:32:01,035
The gas tank's in one piece,
smashed, but intact.

324
00:32:01,111 --> 00:32:03,168
And none of the wiring was shorted out,

325
00:32:03,245 --> 00:32:05,642
so that leaves us
right where we started.

326
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,899
Dave.

327
00:32:28,744 --> 00:32:29,800
Over here.

328
00:32:36,477 --> 00:32:37,942
See any difference?

329
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:41,469
Different color.
This looks strange.

330
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:43,172
Now, look here.

331
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,535
You'll see a slight discoloration
around the piles of rock.

332
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,738
Why, yes, you do.

333
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,199
It's funny I didn't notice that before.

334
00:32:54,276 --> 00:32:56,640
Seems to be only around
the points of contact,

335
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,198
always near where
the rock has multiplied.

336
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,298
Yeah.

337
00:33:03,742 --> 00:33:07,697
Now, look at the difference,
Dave. More than just the color.

338
00:33:10,943 --> 00:33:13,432
This... It looks

339
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:16,099
lifeless.

340
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:17,467
Yes.

341
00:33:18,776 --> 00:33:20,332
Yes, it does.

342
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:31,401
It's got the same
look to it as the wreckage.

343
00:33:31,475 --> 00:33:32,532
It should.

344
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:35,933
Both of them were caused by
multiplication of siliceous rock.

345
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:39,531
Granted, but something just out of the
earth looking so much like wrecked furniture?

346
00:33:39,608 --> 00:33:40,938
What could they
have in common?

347
00:33:41,008 --> 00:33:43,236
They lack something
in common. Silica.

348
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:46,070
They lack silica?
Yeah.

349
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,401
The dirt sample is ordinary
earth, but nothing more.

350
00:33:49,942 --> 00:33:53,338
The wreckage is exactly what it
should be, wood, plaster, metal,

351
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,897
but the silica content
in both is missing.

352
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,233
There's not a sign of it.
That could be the answer.

353
00:33:58,308 --> 00:34:00,672
We know the siliceous
rock does multiply.

354
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:03,639
Perhaps a part of the process
is the absorption of silica,

355
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,105
taking it right out of whatever
it comes into contact with,

356
00:34:06,173 --> 00:34:08,003
be it desert, or wood, or...

357
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,866
Human beings?

358
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,268
I didn't know there was such a
thing as silica in the human body.

359
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:20,897
It's called silicon.

360
00:34:20,974 --> 00:34:25,031
It's a trace element, like iron, copper,
aluminum, only there's much less of it.

361
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:26,095
Doctor,

362
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:31,363
if the silicon content in a
person were suddenly to disappear?

363
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:34,599
By contact with a rock?
No matter how, what if it did?

364
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,035
Wait a moment.

365
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,472
Science never has known for sure
just what the function of silicon was,

366
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,302
but there is one theory

367
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:47,338
that silicon is what helps
make the skin flexible.

368
00:34:50,308 --> 00:34:51,398
Flexible.

369
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:54,570
And take it away?

370
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:59,569
Ginny! Doctor, get word
to Hendricks. Come on!

371
00:35:01,472 --> 00:35:04,336
Hey, where you going?
We've got a meteor to find.

372
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:26,197
Is this the old San Angelo
Road that Cathy spoke of?

373
00:35:26,272 --> 00:35:29,136
Yeah. She said it was about
12 miles up the canyon.

374
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:49,335
Hadn't we better slow down a little? Yeah.

375
00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:57,401
There. That must be it.

376
00:36:07,637 --> 00:36:08,625
Look.

377
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:11,800
They're the same fragments,
all right.

378
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,360
Then the meteor
can't be far off.

379
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,058
Think of the knowledge
buried down there.

380
00:37:03,269 --> 00:37:05,996
There's only one thing
I want to know from that,

381
00:37:06,503 --> 00:37:08,128
what makes it multiply?

382
00:37:08,702 --> 00:37:09,963
What starts it?

383
00:37:10,036 --> 00:37:12,468
You've got to remember, David,
when this hit our atmosphere,

384
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:14,660
it burned at such
a fantastic temperature

385
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:17,361
that its metal-bearing compounds
could have been altered,

386
00:37:17,436 --> 00:37:19,560
left ready
to activate, to grow.

387
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:23,032
No telling what went on
inside of it.

388
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:26,864
It's been gathering the
secrets of time and space

389
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:28,526
for billions of years.

390
00:37:30,169 --> 00:37:31,532
Billions of years.

391
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:35,532
And how long have we got to
unlock its most important secret?

392
00:37:35,669 --> 00:37:38,566
Three hours? Or three minutes?

393
00:37:55,267 --> 00:37:57,893
Are you going to
make some tests first, Doctor?

394
00:37:57,968 --> 00:38:00,366
If we took the time to
determine Ginny's silicon level,

395
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:02,696
the whole question
would be academic.

396
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:06,223
I'm sorry, Miss Barrett.
I didn't mean to be so blunt.

397
00:38:06,434 --> 00:38:09,764
Please try to understand that
anything medical science could do

398
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:13,357
under the circumstances for Ginny
would have to be experimental.

399
00:38:13,434 --> 00:38:16,093
On the other hand, Dr.
Reynolds' report from San Angelo

400
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:19,690
did coincide exactly with what we've
learned from our autopsy on Ben Gilbert,

401
00:38:19,767 --> 00:38:23,290
that somehow that rock had
robbed his entire body of silicon.

402
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:25,627
That means only one thing.

403
00:38:25,701 --> 00:38:27,666
We've got to try synthetically

404
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:32,293
to replenish that element in Ginny's
body and arrest the solidifying action.

405
00:38:32,466 --> 00:38:35,024
I know you're doing
the best you can, Doctor.

406
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,725
It does everything but grow.

407
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:02,788
Not heat, not electricity,

408
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,926
not the simplest catalysts.

409
00:39:05,998 --> 00:39:08,328
And yet, it has to be
something simple.

410
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:11,762
Something present both here
and at the Simpson ranch.

411
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:14,692
Maybe it was something
somebody did.

412
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:18,063
Well, as long as this stuff is left
alone in the desert, nothing happens.

413
00:39:18,132 --> 00:39:19,358
It's dormant.

414
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:22,398
It's only after somebody's picked
up a chunk of it that it activates.

415
00:39:22,464 --> 00:39:24,260
But we've handled it.

416
00:39:24,565 --> 00:39:26,589
Apparently not
in the right way.

417
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:30,161
No, it has to be something
Ben and Ginny did to it.

418
00:39:30,231 --> 00:39:32,823
Well, no telling how Ben
experimented on it.

419
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:38,094
What could he have done in the laboratory
that Ginny could also have done at home?

420
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:41,753
What would a little girl do
with a rock souvenir

421
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,660
she picked up in the desert?

422
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,819
Professor.
Thank you, Dave.

423
00:40:46,062 --> 00:40:49,994
I'm sorry, Dave, I guess this is
beginning to get on my nerves a little.

424
00:40:50,296 --> 00:40:53,286
It's probably just my
strong coffee, Professor.

425
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:54,885
I'll make some fresh.

426
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:08,857
You know, this coffee I brew is responsible
for my prolonged bachelor status.

427
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:11,489
Oh?
Uh-huh.

428
00:41:11,663 --> 00:41:13,719
Cathy tried a cup of it once.

429
00:41:14,628 --> 00:41:17,093
She said anybody who drank
mud like this all day long

430
00:41:17,162 --> 00:41:19,719
has just got to be
too grouchy to live with.

431
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:24,022
Give me your cup. I'll rinse
out the mud. Thanks, Dave.

432
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:30,820
Professor...

433
00:41:47,028 --> 00:41:48,585
It was only a little chip.

434
00:41:48,662 --> 00:41:49,558
But what made it grow?
What happened to it?

435
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:52,059
It slipped into the sink.
That's all.

436
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,321
No, something started it.
Something we did.

437
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:56,327
You poured coffee in the sink.

438
00:41:56,628 --> 00:41:58,149
Coffee?
Coffee.

439
00:41:58,227 --> 00:42:01,557
Coffee is nothing
but flavored water.

440
00:42:21,927 --> 00:42:24,984
And when there's
no more water, it stops.

441
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,551
But as long as there is water,
it'll multiply again and again.

442
00:42:31,027 --> 00:42:34,016
Water. A simple thing like...

443
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,817
Professor,

444
00:42:45,092 --> 00:42:46,888
the meteor!

445
00:43:04,192 --> 00:43:05,659
Stop the car.

446
00:43:07,891 --> 00:43:09,085
The engine.

447
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:25,581
Incredible.

448
00:44:27,089 --> 00:44:30,577
Professor, they're gonna follow this
natural slope right down the canyon.

449
00:44:30,656 --> 00:44:33,020
They'll go straight through San Angelo.

450
00:44:42,923 --> 00:44:45,115
Evacuate? The entire town?

451
00:44:45,189 --> 00:44:47,156
Chief, those rocks are gonna
come crashing through here

452
00:44:47,223 --> 00:44:48,711
like an avalanche
over an anthill.

453
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:50,277
There won't be
a living thing left.

454
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,377
You won't even be able to
tell where San Angelo was.

455
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:54,785
When they're no longer confined
within the walls of the canyon,

456
00:44:54,856 --> 00:44:56,617
when they break out
onto the open valley floor,

457
00:44:56,689 --> 00:44:58,620
their rate of multiplication
is going to be frightening.

458
00:44:58,688 --> 00:45:00,087
You mean they'll grow
even faster?

459
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:01,984
Each one that shatters
will make 100 more.

460
00:45:02,055 --> 00:45:04,248
When that 100 shatters,
there'll be 10,000 of them.

461
00:45:04,322 --> 00:45:05,720
The third cycle
will create a million.

462
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:08,118
Unless we can stop them, they'll
spread over the whole countryside.

463
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:10,280
With enough rain, there's
no boundary they can't cross.

464
00:45:10,355 --> 00:45:12,184
Then it all depends on
how long it keeps raining?

465
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:15,584
That's it. We'd better find
out about that right now.

466
00:45:17,188 --> 00:45:18,984
The Weather Bureau
in Riverside's your best bet.

467
00:45:19,055 --> 00:45:20,111
Right.

468
00:45:23,189 --> 00:45:25,347
There's no exact forecast,
but...

469
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:29,477
<i>Well, can't you just give us a general
idea of when the rainstorm might be over?</i>

470
00:45:29,555 --> 00:45:33,282
Well, the prevailing
nimbostratus in your area

471
00:45:33,354 --> 00:45:36,344
seems to have begun to dissipate under
the influence of divergence aloft,

472
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:38,682
associated with veering winds.

473
00:45:38,887 --> 00:45:42,479
Ordinarily, this would lessen
the duration of precipitation.

474
00:45:42,555 --> 00:45:43,543
However,

475
00:45:44,854 --> 00:45:48,412
the unstable tropical air mass
moving up from the south

476
00:45:48,488 --> 00:45:51,885
<i>combined with the polar outbreak
moving down from Canada,</i>

477
00:45:51,953 --> 00:45:55,886
<i>could conceivably give rise to
an area of extreme cyclogenesis,</i>

478
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:58,913
<i>which, in turn, could
develop into... Friend?</i>

479
00:46:00,053 --> 00:46:02,848
<i>Yes? When is the rain
going to stop?</i>

480
00:46:03,587 --> 00:46:04,574
Why,

481
00:46:05,986 --> 00:46:07,976
today.

482
00:46:10,086 --> 00:46:11,347
This morning.

483
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,648
<i>Can you tell us how long we've
got before it starts again?</i>

484
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:17,014
Well, there's no additional

485
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,448
precipitation forecast
for another 48 hours.

486
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,246
<i>Thank you, very much.</i>

487
00:46:34,852 --> 00:46:36,011
Well, Professor,

488
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,608
do you think we can figure out
how to stop them in two days?

489
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:40,379
I'd say we have no more choice in the matter

490
00:46:40,452 --> 00:46:42,940
than a student has in
avoiding one of my assignments.

491
00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:45,849
I can vouch for that.
What about the evacuation?

492
00:46:45,952 --> 00:46:47,440
I'd alert the people anyway.

493
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:50,417
If our time runs out, you can get
instructions to them by radio and TV.

494
00:46:50,486 --> 00:46:52,973
Right. Oh, get Cochrane
to use his wire service.

495
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:56,314
They can contact all the
broadcasting stations by Teletype.

496
00:46:57,685 --> 00:47:00,117
Is that you, Ethel?
This is Dan Corey.

497
00:47:00,185 --> 00:47:02,651
Now get this, Ethel,
and get it straight.

498
00:47:04,618 --> 00:47:06,776
Call everybody in town?

499
00:47:06,884 --> 00:47:08,817
Do you realize I'm here alone?

500
00:47:08,885 --> 00:47:10,544
Then get some more help.

501
00:47:10,852 --> 00:47:13,148
I don't care how you do it, just do it.

502
00:47:13,684 --> 00:47:16,048
Tell them to warn their
neighbors. Spread the word.

503
00:47:16,118 --> 00:47:18,346
Well, at least
that's a good idea.

504
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:22,508
The way gossip travels in this town,
everybody'll hear about it in no time.

505
00:47:22,717 --> 00:47:25,205
What is it I'm supposed to warn them about?

506
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:30,747
Yes, Chief!

507
00:47:31,285 --> 00:47:33,217
Yes, Chief!
Right away, Chief!

508
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:04,713
Miss Barrett. Miss Barrett,
come here, quickly!

509
00:48:05,184 --> 00:48:06,171
Look.

510
00:48:08,284 --> 00:48:10,216
The doctor.
Get Dr. Hendricks.

511
00:48:17,284 --> 00:48:19,340
<i>...and although
the exact degree of danger</i>

512
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:20,676
<i>has not yet been determined,</i>

513
00:48:20,749 --> 00:48:22,409
<i>all residents of San Angelo</i>

514
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:25,449
<i>are requested by Chief of
Police Dan Corey of that city,</i>

515
00:48:25,516 --> 00:48:29,039
<i>to be fully prepared to
evacuate if it becomes necessary.</i>

516
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:31,208
<i>Stay tuned
to this station for...</i>

517
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:39,139
Mommy, the TV went off.

518
00:48:39,215 --> 00:48:42,239
How can I listen to what
they're saying if it went off?

519
00:48:56,115 --> 00:48:57,274
Honey,

520
00:48:57,414 --> 00:49:00,575
they said to stay off the phone. It's dead.

521
00:49:01,214 --> 00:49:04,545
The radio, the lights,
everything's dead.

522
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:13,105
She's gonna be all right.

523
00:49:13,182 --> 00:49:14,613
Breathing normally.

524
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:17,306
She's completely
out of danger.

525
00:49:35,647 --> 00:49:37,580
Outside Long Distance, please.

526
00:49:42,381 --> 00:49:43,472
<i>Long Distance.</i>

527
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:46,138
I'd like to place a
person-to-person call to San Angelo.

528
00:49:46,213 --> 00:49:48,112
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am.
I can't connect you.</i>

529
00:49:48,181 --> 00:49:49,239
What do you mean?

530
00:49:49,314 --> 00:49:51,744
<i>We've had a report of some
trouble near San Angelo.</i>

531
00:49:51,812 --> 00:49:54,507
<i>What kind of trouble? I don't
have that information, ma'am.</i>

532
00:49:54,581 --> 00:49:57,671
<i>It's impossible to get a call through
to that exchange at this time.</i>

533
00:49:57,747 --> 00:49:58,837
Thank you.

534
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,068
Dr. Hendricks,
something's wrong.

535
00:50:03,146 --> 00:50:05,509
Something's wrong with the lines.
I can't get through to Dave.

536
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:06,567
Oh?

537
00:50:07,147 --> 00:50:10,600
Those rocks. I've got to keep
trying. That won't do any good.

538
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,902
Wait a minute.
There is one way.

539
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:17,134
Operator,

540
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:21,068
get me the State Highway
Patrol, Los Angeles, please.

541
00:50:27,812 --> 00:50:30,005
LAX to Car 42. Come in.

542
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:32,374
<i>LAX to Car 42. Come in.</i>

543
00:50:32,712 --> 00:50:34,644
Car 42. Come in.

544
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:37,908
<i>Proceed to San Angelo.
Contact a Mr. Dave Miller,</i>

545
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:40,740
<i>District Office of the
Department of Interior.</i>

546
00:50:40,812 --> 00:50:42,242
Roger and out.

547
00:51:06,678 --> 00:51:09,406
They patched in the doctor's phone
call at the Los Angeles headquarters

548
00:51:09,478 --> 00:51:12,376
and they're relaying it
through the big transmitter.

549
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,734
Just press the button
when you talk

550
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:16,935
and when you want him
to answer say "over. "

551
00:51:17,011 --> 00:51:18,772
Dr. Hendricks,
this is Dave Miller. Over.

552
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:21,970
<i>Dave, I wanted to get word to you as
soon as possible. Your theory worked.</i>

553
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,601
<i>Ginny's completely
out of danger. Over.</i>

554
00:51:24,677 --> 00:51:27,939
Oh, that's wonderful news,
Doctor, for a couple of reasons.

555
00:51:28,143 --> 00:51:30,735
I have an idea there may be something
in that formula you used on Ginny

556
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:32,469
that would help us here.

557
00:51:32,543 --> 00:51:35,238
Her reaction resulted
from contact with the rock,

558
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:38,708
so why not suppose that the same agent
is capable of controlling the rocks?

559
00:51:38,777 --> 00:51:41,641
One ingredient with a common
power, if we can isolate it.

560
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:43,107
What do you think? Over.

561
00:51:43,177 --> 00:51:46,405
That's an interesting idea.
Sounds logical on the surface.

562
00:51:46,776 --> 00:51:48,538
It's certainly worth a try.

563
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:50,808
Here it is.
Are you ready? Over.

564
00:51:50,875 --> 00:51:52,399
Just a minute.

565
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:56,608
All right, Doctor.
Go ahead.

566
00:51:56,676 --> 00:52:00,301
<i>I used a base
of silicic acid uncut, CMC,</i>

567
00:52:00,709 --> 00:52:04,766
<i>Glucose DB and monochloroacetic
acid. That's it. Over.</i>

568
00:52:04,843 --> 00:52:06,810
Got it.
How did you suspend them?

569
00:52:06,877 --> 00:52:08,307
Normal saline solution.

570
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:11,002
Say, Dave, is there any way we
can speed things up from this end?

571
00:52:11,076 --> 00:52:14,973
<i>Thank you, Doctor, but I don't see how.
Not unless you can chase rain clouds.</i>

572
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:17,100
<i>Say, hold on a minute, Doctor.
It looks like trouble.</i>

573
00:52:17,177 --> 00:52:18,698
<i>Stay where you are.
I'll talk to you in a minute.</i>

574
00:52:22,776 --> 00:52:24,639
Why, it's Joe Higgins.

575
00:52:28,476 --> 00:52:29,737
Chief, you got to believe me.

576
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:31,603
You're gonna think I'm
blind drunk... Rocks, Joe?

577
00:52:31,675 --> 00:52:34,403
Towers of rock crashing down
and then growing up again?

578
00:52:34,476 --> 00:52:35,805
Yeah, yeah!

579
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:36,898
Hundreds of them. Thousands.

580
00:52:36,974 --> 00:52:39,566
They come crashing through
my farm like a, like a...

581
00:52:39,642 --> 00:52:42,473
Chief, there's nothing left.
Nothing.

582
00:52:42,542 --> 00:52:44,565
My livestock's all dead and...

583
00:52:44,974 --> 00:52:46,702
Here, here, I'll show you.

584
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:52,268
Look at the dog. He's as
hard as a piece of granite.

585
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:56,173
Mary, what's wrong?

586
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:59,138
I'd better get Doc Reynolds.

587
00:53:04,774 --> 00:53:07,831
I have it all down, Dr.
Hendricks. One injection only.

588
00:53:08,141 --> 00:53:10,232
Now, what do we do
about an iron lung

589
00:53:10,308 --> 00:53:13,603
to keep Mrs. Higgins alive until
the solution takes effect? Over.

590
00:53:13,674 --> 00:53:15,902
Well, from what you've told me, I
can assure you she'll be all right

591
00:53:15,974 --> 00:53:18,439
for three or four hours
without the lung.

592
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:21,064
And I can be there with a
portable unit long before that.

593
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:24,471
<i>And anyway, Dr. Reynolds, I'd like to
be present, if you don't mind. Over.</i>

594
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:27,404
You're more than welcome.
I was hoping you'd offer.

595
00:53:28,374 --> 00:53:30,273
Cigarette?
No, thanks.

596
00:53:33,073 --> 00:53:35,039
She's gonna be all right,
Mr. Higgins.

597
00:53:35,107 --> 00:53:38,540
Dr. Reynolds is getting all the information
on how the little Simpson girl was cured.

598
00:53:38,607 --> 00:53:40,572
He'll use the same
formula on your wife.

599
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,664
It ain't gonna
take too long, is it?

600
00:53:42,741 --> 00:53:45,967
I mean, I don't aim to sit around here and
wait for those rocks to catch up with us.

601
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:47,597
You don't have to worry.

602
00:53:47,673 --> 00:53:50,935
You see, we found out that without
rain the rocks stop growing.

603
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:54,371
Mister, I seen them smash the big,
main power line that runs into town.

604
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,769
Goes right through my place. And it
hadn't been raining for half an hour.

605
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,704
When they crashed into my house
and barns, it wasn't raining a drop.

606
00:54:00,773 --> 00:54:03,364
No, mister, they're not stopped.
They're moving right down this valley.

607
00:54:03,439 --> 00:54:05,564
You mean now?
Sure, now. Right now.

608
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,606
How far is your place
from town, Mr. Higgins?

609
00:54:07,673 --> 00:54:08,831
Six and a half miles.

610
00:54:08,906 --> 00:54:10,372
Professor, I'm going
out there and have a look.

611
00:54:10,439 --> 00:54:12,267
We've got to know
how much time we do have.

612
00:54:12,338 --> 00:54:15,499
That's Hendricks' formula.
I'll get started in the lab.

613
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:28,001
There isn't a chance that they
can repair the lines in time.

614
00:54:28,072 --> 00:54:31,367
Martin, I've got 1,500 people
waiting for word to get out of town.

615
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:33,564
Now, how am I gonna
get that word to them?

616
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,901
Well, now, Dan, I wouldn't say
we're cut off, not completely.

617
00:54:37,972 --> 00:54:40,233
Huh?
Come with me.

618
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:51,662
Bobby. Bobby.

619
00:54:52,105 --> 00:54:53,297
Over here.

620
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:01,434
Like I started
to tell you, Dan,

621
00:55:01,504 --> 00:55:04,629
<i>I know I never have much to write about in
the Sentinel, but what little there is</i>

622
00:55:04,704 --> 00:55:08,966
always gets delivered to most
every house in town, every day.

623
00:55:09,804 --> 00:55:13,394
You want me, Mr. Cochrane?
Martin, you're a genius.

624
00:55:14,137 --> 00:55:17,103
Bobby, you already know
what kind of trouble we're in.

625
00:55:17,171 --> 00:55:18,637
Now, we're gonna
need your help.

626
00:55:18,704 --> 00:55:20,101
The first thing
I want you to do is

627
00:55:20,171 --> 00:55:23,399
round up every kid in town,
boy or girl, who's got a bicycle

628
00:55:23,471 --> 00:55:26,458
and be back here with them in a
half hour. I got a job for them.

629
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:30,060
Sure, Mr. Cochrane, but... But? But what?

630
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,929
Well, most of the guys
I know won't do it

631
00:55:33,071 --> 00:55:35,434
unless I can tell them
how much they'll get paid.

632
00:55:35,504 --> 00:55:37,662
Get paid?
At a time like this?

633
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:39,495
You tell them
this is police business.

634
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,661
You tell them the Chief of
Police wants them here right now.

635
00:55:42,737 --> 00:55:44,100
Yes, sir.

636
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:47,068
I don't know, Martin.

637
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:49,658
Kids nowadays have to
get paid for everything.

638
00:55:49,736 --> 00:55:51,760
Well, don't worry
about them, Dan.

639
00:55:51,837 --> 00:55:55,997
When they find out what we want them to
deliver, you just watch the smoke fly.

640
00:55:57,603 --> 00:55:59,466
You know what
I was thinking?

641
00:55:59,703 --> 00:56:02,930
<i>This is gonna be the most important
delivery in the Sentinel's history,</i>

642
00:56:03,003 --> 00:56:05,798
to say nothing of the
biggest circulation-getter.

643
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:10,159
And because of it, I'm gonna lose
every paying customer I've got.

644
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:12,860
Chief, you'd better come
over here right away.

645
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,565
What's the matter?

646
00:56:19,636 --> 00:56:22,932
She just drove in, stopped, and then
passed out before she said a word.

647
00:56:23,003 --> 00:56:24,900
Get her over
to the doctor.

648
00:56:36,802 --> 00:56:40,164
Let's warm up that radiophone.
I want to talk to the Governor.

649
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:46,392
The Governor has declared that
a state of emergency exists

650
00:56:46,468 --> 00:56:48,764
in the area surrounding
the doomed town.

651
00:56:48,835 --> 00:56:51,392
The Highway Patrol has issued
a warning to all motorists

652
00:56:51,468 --> 00:56:55,798
other than the evacuees to stay off
the roads leading into San Angelo.

653
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:59,764
<i>Their patrol cars will stop anyone
who disregards this order.</i>

654
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:37,320
Good. Let her roll, boys.

655
00:59:04,964 --> 00:59:06,758
They're still activating.

656
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:09,059
They're pulling the water
out of the sand like sponges.

657
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:11,097
Well,
the rain's stopped, anyhow.

658
00:59:11,164 --> 00:59:15,721
Yeah, without a continuing rainfall,
at least the growth's been retarded.

659
00:59:15,863 --> 00:59:18,329
It looks like it's taken about
10 minutes for each cycle.

660
00:59:18,397 --> 00:59:19,919
Still too fast.

661
00:59:20,563 --> 00:59:23,121
Professor, the way I figure
it, we got seven or eight hours

662
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:25,992
and San Angelo's gonna look more
like a petrified forest than a town.

663
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,324
Yeah.

664
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,692
Dave, I know this is
an unnecessary question,

665
00:59:29,763 --> 00:59:33,718
but are you positive that you wrote down all
the ingredients in Dr. Hendricks' formula?

666
00:59:33,796 --> 00:59:35,023
Absolutely.

667
00:59:36,363 --> 00:59:39,659
You mean none of them work? That's about it.

668
00:59:40,464 --> 00:59:42,656
Our one chance is

669
00:59:42,963 --> 00:59:46,521
that maybe a combination
of all the ingredients.

670
00:59:46,762 --> 00:59:50,251
Yeah, yeah. Pairs, three at
a time, maybe all at once.

671
01:00:40,495 --> 01:00:43,949
Well, let's try a mixture of
silicic acid and Glucose DB.

672
01:00:44,262 --> 01:00:47,955
Don't be too discouraged, Dave.
Your theory's sound. I'm sure of it.

673
01:00:49,328 --> 01:00:52,451
Cathy!
What're you doing here?

674
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:55,687
Well, that's a fine greeting. I
thought you'd be glad to see me.

675
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,226
Of course I am.

676
01:00:58,561 --> 01:01:00,117
You look tired, honey.
Did you get any sleep?

677
01:01:00,194 --> 01:01:01,853
Oh, don't worry about me.

678
01:01:01,927 --> 01:01:03,825
Ginny's all right.
Oh, great.

679
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,457
She's sleeping mostly,
from exhaustion.

680
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,282
And I wanted
to be with you.

681
01:01:09,426 --> 01:01:12,258
Well, I'm delighted you came,
Miss Barrett. We can use some help.

682
01:01:12,328 --> 01:01:13,849
We sure can.

683
01:01:23,293 --> 01:01:25,987
We'd better get that lung in here.
All right.

684
01:01:27,293 --> 01:01:29,121
You're the husband?
Yes.

685
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,859
You can relax now.
We were on time.

686
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:38,716
It'd be simpler if we could just find a way

687
01:01:38,792 --> 01:01:41,258
to keep the water
from getting to them.

688
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:43,918
See? The activity's
almost stopped.

689
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,655
Maybe this'll stop it
for good.

690
01:01:55,659 --> 01:01:57,056
It doesn't make sense.

691
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:59,614
Something in that formula worked for
Hendricks. Why won't it work for us?

692
01:01:59,691 --> 01:02:02,624
It has me stumped. I thought, surely if
we grouped all four ingredients together

693
01:02:02,692 --> 01:02:05,589
like Dr. Hendricks did for the little
girl, we'd get a positive reaction.

694
01:02:05,658 --> 01:02:06,715
So did I.

695
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,689
Wait a minute.

696
01:02:12,225 --> 01:02:15,191
We didn't duplicate Hendricks'
formula, not completely.

697
01:02:15,259 --> 01:02:16,725
You mean the saline solution?

698
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:18,416
Why not?
We've tried everything else.

699
01:02:18,491 --> 01:02:20,651
But I thought you said that
was nothing but a salt solution

700
01:02:20,726 --> 01:02:22,918
to hold the ingredients together.
Yeah, that's what I said.

701
01:02:22,992 --> 01:02:25,356
Then it couldn't possibly
have any effect, could it?

702
01:02:25,425 --> 01:02:27,720
You're absolutely right.
It's ridiculous.

703
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:31,848
But that's what they said about the
wheel when someone first thought of it.

704
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,457
Dave, it works.

705
01:03:08,524 --> 01:03:10,615
More water.
We got to be sure.

706
01:03:26,756 --> 01:03:29,086
If we had that extra day the
Weather Bureau promised us,

707
01:03:29,157 --> 01:03:32,418
I'm sure we could figure a way
to stop the monoliths for good.

708
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:34,012
We're not that lucky.

709
01:03:34,323 --> 01:03:37,617
But I think we can cut them
off here before they reach town.

710
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:40,678
That'd be like trying to stop a
forest fire with a traffic signal.

711
01:03:40,756 --> 01:03:43,187
All right, Chief. How do
you fight a forest fire?

712
01:03:43,256 --> 01:03:45,221
With a firebreak, right?
Yeah.

713
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:48,381
Well, how about
a salt break? Look here.

714
01:03:49,756 --> 01:03:53,586
The natural slope of the valley floor
is bringing them right down here.

715
01:03:53,656 --> 01:03:56,416
Now, if we could lay a
swath of salt right here,

716
01:03:56,488 --> 01:03:59,080
making it as wide
as the monoliths are tall,

717
01:03:59,156 --> 01:04:01,122
then, when they fell and
shattered, they'd just pile up,

718
01:04:01,189 --> 01:04:03,155
keeping them inside
the canyon.

719
01:04:03,222 --> 01:04:05,051
This'd give us
the time we need.

720
01:04:05,122 --> 01:04:06,713
Theoretically,
you're right, David,

721
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:09,117
but to cover an area that
great in the time that we have,

722
01:04:09,188 --> 01:04:11,246
why, I doubt if
1,000 dump trucks

723
01:04:11,322 --> 01:04:12,946
could move that salt
over there fast enough.

724
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:15,249
I've thought about that,
Professor, but we've got to try.

725
01:04:15,321 --> 01:04:17,185
Will you gain enough time
to make it worthwhile?

726
01:04:17,256 --> 01:04:19,517
If we had to have
a misplaced ocean,

727
01:04:19,588 --> 01:04:22,053
why couldn't it have dried
up and left its salt here

728
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,587
where we need it, in the first
place? Even if it were there,

729
01:04:24,655 --> 01:04:27,450
it couldn't keep the monoliths from
breaking out of the valley eventually.

730
01:04:27,522 --> 01:04:28,510
Why?

731
01:04:28,855 --> 01:04:32,752
The dry salt in either case will
only act as a temporary barrier.

732
01:04:32,821 --> 01:04:35,651
When they pile up sufficiently, some
of them are bound to go around it.

733
01:04:35,721 --> 01:04:38,483
Why, they'll go crashing through that
irrigation dam like it wasn't there.

734
01:04:38,555 --> 01:04:40,077
And with the flood waters
to feed them,

735
01:04:40,155 --> 01:04:43,144
they'll march right on
through the reservoir canyon

736
01:04:43,221 --> 01:04:44,845
and out into
the citrus area.

737
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,012
And once they break through to
the other side of the mountains,

738
01:04:47,088 --> 01:04:49,213
there'll be
no stopping them ever.

739
01:04:49,621 --> 01:04:53,349
Chief, you lived here, didn't you,
before that irrigation project was built?

740
01:04:53,421 --> 01:04:54,750
Yeah, sure.

741
01:04:54,821 --> 01:04:56,810
Did the water
that flowed down the wash

742
01:04:56,888 --> 01:04:59,751
reach this end of the valley
before the dam was put up?

743
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,684
When it rained.
What're you driving at?

744
01:05:01,754 --> 01:05:03,719
We're gonna
beat them to the punch.

745
01:05:03,786 --> 01:05:06,980
If the monoliths get to the water
behind the dam, they'll feed on it.

746
01:05:07,053 --> 01:05:10,451
But if we could drain that reservoir
first, that same water will stop them.

747
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,782
After it floods through the
dry lake, it'll be salt water,

748
01:05:12,853 --> 01:05:14,580
which will deactivate
them completely.

749
01:05:14,653 --> 01:05:17,210
Dave, I don't think the flood gates
will release the water fast enough.

750
01:05:17,286 --> 01:05:18,843
How about the discharge pipes?

751
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,182
The discharge pipes are on
the other side of the mountain.

752
01:05:21,254 --> 01:05:24,118
The dam was built by the
citrus growers over there.

753
01:05:29,886 --> 01:05:32,216
Then we'll dynamite the dam.
Blow it up?

754
01:05:32,286 --> 01:05:34,582
You can't do that.
It's privately owned.

755
01:05:34,653 --> 01:05:37,312
Dave, you can't take on
this responsibility alone.

756
01:05:37,386 --> 01:05:40,045
She's right. Besides, that's a
$6 million irrigation project...

757
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:42,551
There's no price you can put on the
destruction those things will cause

758
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:44,448
if they're not stopped here.

759
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,509
Get in touch with the Governor. He
might order it in the public interest.

760
01:05:48,586 --> 01:05:50,676
Dave, where are you going?

761
01:05:50,752 --> 01:05:52,775
We've only got
a few hours left, Dan.

762
01:05:52,852 --> 01:05:56,512
Those charges have got to be set
exactly right to move all that concrete.

763
01:05:56,586 --> 01:05:58,414
And we only get one chance.

764
01:06:01,752 --> 01:06:04,343
The Salt Reclaiming Company
uses a lot of dynamite.

765
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:06,906
You'll find everything
you need there.

766
01:06:07,019 --> 01:06:08,279
Thanks.

767
01:06:12,184 --> 01:06:15,981
And what do you think, Professor?
Will it stop the monoliths?

768
01:06:16,851 --> 01:06:20,284
Well, it's like another
laboratory experiment, Cathy.

769
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:22,984
In science there are no guarantees.

770
01:06:24,651 --> 01:06:26,980
Hey, you can
see them from here!

771
01:08:24,348 --> 01:08:27,439
Mr. Miller, there's still some men down
at the salt plant moving equipment out.

772
01:08:27,515 --> 01:08:29,742
I'm supposed to warn them
before we set her off.

773
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,780
You better make your call now,
just to be safe.

774
01:08:31,847 --> 01:08:35,144
Then keep your phone open and
stand by. I'll tell you when.

775
01:08:36,248 --> 01:08:38,713
P1 calling P2.
Come in, P2.

776
01:09:15,213 --> 01:09:18,509
Dave, is everything all right? So far.

777
01:09:21,212 --> 01:09:22,508
One word on that car radio,

778
01:09:22,579 --> 01:09:24,841
and 6 million bucks worth
of dam goes sky high.

779
01:09:24,913 --> 01:09:26,105
David, from
our calculations,

780
01:09:26,179 --> 01:09:28,543
we know it takes at
least a 3/ salt solution

781
01:09:28,613 --> 01:09:30,204
to be effective
against monoliths.

782
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,643
So I did some fast figuring,
rough estimates

783
01:09:32,713 --> 01:09:36,645
based on what Mr. Cochrane remembers
about the volume of water behind the dam,

784
01:09:36,713 --> 01:09:39,735
and the amount of salt
that'll be in its path. And?

785
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:41,645
What are the odds?

786
01:09:41,713 --> 01:09:44,644
We're going to have to be lucky. Very lucky.

787
01:09:46,445 --> 01:09:50,378
Dave, the Governor is supposed to fly here
to get a firsthand look at the disaster area.

788
01:09:50,446 --> 01:09:52,968
But, so far, we haven't
been able to locate him.

789
01:09:53,045 --> 01:09:54,601
When he sees
what's happening here,

790
01:09:54,678 --> 01:09:57,109
he's sure to give
permission to blow up the dam.

791
01:09:57,178 --> 01:09:58,337
The important thing
right now

792
01:09:58,411 --> 01:10:01,571
is to get out to the edge of
town where we can see something.

793
01:10:01,645 --> 01:10:03,577
Chief, will you have the
patrol car stick close to us?

794
01:10:03,645 --> 01:10:05,838
We'll need that radio.
Right, Dave.

795
01:10:11,911 --> 01:10:13,469
Professor,

796
01:10:13,845 --> 01:10:17,402
can you figure how long it'll take the
water to reach the wash after it's released?

797
01:10:17,478 --> 01:10:19,307
I'll have to know
how far away it is.

798
01:10:19,377 --> 01:10:22,208
Two and seven-tenths miles
from dam to city limits.

799
01:10:23,144 --> 01:10:26,043
If it's dull or statistical,
I've written about it.

800
01:11:15,476 --> 01:11:18,306
David, roughly three minutes
after they dynamite the dam,

801
01:11:18,376 --> 01:11:21,103
the water will flood the wash.
Three minutes?

802
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:25,269
Then we've got to let them reach the wash,

803
01:11:25,342 --> 01:11:27,901
and wait till they're growing
right in the middle of it.

804
01:11:27,977 --> 01:11:30,498
Kind of like waiting till you
see the whites of their eyes.

805
01:11:30,575 --> 01:11:32,131
Dave, the Governor
still can't be reached.

806
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:35,107
He's in his car someplace
on his way to the airport.

807
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:54,572
Officer, establish
contact with Hank.

808
01:11:54,642 --> 01:11:56,664
I'm talking to the pilot
of the Governor's plane.

809
01:11:56,741 --> 01:11:59,674
He said the Governor's at the airport
now and will be aboard any minute.

810
01:12:31,474 --> 01:12:33,064
Get Hank! Quick!

811
01:12:33,707 --> 01:12:35,799
Dave, just another minute.

812
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:37,237
We don't have another minute!

813
01:12:37,306 --> 01:12:39,295
Dave Miller to Hank Jackson.
Do you read me? Over.

814
01:12:39,373 --> 01:12:41,805
I read you loud and clear.
Are you ready? Over.

815
01:12:41,874 --> 01:12:42,862
Ready!

816
01:12:45,974 --> 01:12:47,440
Hit it! Now!

817
01:13:14,806 --> 01:13:18,636
Well, let's hope the Governor
makes the right decision.

818
01:15:09,003 --> 01:15:11,128
It's working.
It's working!

819
01:15:11,203 --> 01:15:14,326
The salt water's stopping
them. Right in their tracks.

820
01:16:09,068 --> 01:16:10,864
And the Governor had stopped
for an unscheduled meeting

821
01:16:10,935 --> 01:16:13,399
with the State Engineer and
the State Disaster Director.

822
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:15,592
That's why he was so late
getting to the airport.

823
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:18,632
Never mind that. What
did he say about the dam?

824
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:23,133
Oh, he said,
"Don't blow up the dam

825
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:28,056
"unless you're absolutely
certain it'll be successful!"

826
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:37,296
Martin, you always called that dry
lake Mother Nature's worst mistake.

827
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,295
Looks like now she knew
what she was doing, huh?
