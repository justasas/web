1
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,190
- Have you fallen asleep?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

2
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,560
I think you must be in love or something.

3
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,280
Why does the old bitch pick on me?

4
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,370
That's the second time this week. I nearly
told her what she could do with the job.

5
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,990
<i>Hey, you asleep?</i>

6
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,000
That's what I asked her.

7
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,750
She wants me to stay till 7:00 again.

8
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,180
What polish are you putting on?

9
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,980
- The usual one, madame.
<i>- Oh, I'm fed up with it.</i>

10
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,310
<i>I feel like a change.</i>

11
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,480
<i>- Uh, give me Revlon's Fire and Ice.</i>
- Oh, I'll go and get it.

12
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,050
Madame Denise?

13
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,140
Madame Denise,
Mrs. Rendlesham wants Revlon Fire and Ice.

14
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,310
I don't think there's any left.

15
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,990
Put this on.
She'll never know the difference.

16
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,200
Hello, darling.
How about a bit of the other, then?

17
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,350
You can't eat stuff like this.

18
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,230
Come on.
I'll take you to Wheeler's. Okay?

19
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,440
I have to get back.

20
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,900
Oh, we can have a...
we can have a quick meal.

21
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,780
Come on.

22
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,200
I can't. I'll be late.

23
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,960
Well, just... just one thing.

24
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,040
No?

25
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,130
I can't.

26
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,150
Well, good-bye.

27
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:28,190
Well, just a -just a minute.
What about tonight?

28
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,740
I'm sorry, but I'm busy tonight.

29
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,240
You really make me feel wanted.

30
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,410
Who's the lucky boy?

31
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,290
I'm having dinner with my sister.

32
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,790
Is she a good cook?

33
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,500
I don't know. I never thought about it.

34
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,800
Well, at least it can't be
any worse than fish and chips.

35
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,430
I think we are having rabbit.

36
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,600
Rabbit? Oh.

37
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,020
I thought they'd all been killed off.

38
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,560
- No. She has a friend...
- A rabbit?

39
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,860
No, I think the friend has rabbits.

40
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,860
Poor bunny.
Well, what about tomorrow?

41
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,860
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah. Let's have dinner tomorrow.

42
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,530
I'll meet you at the Hoop and Toy.
You know, the pub along there.

43
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,450
About, uh, 7:00?

44
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

45
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,660
Come along, boy. Walkies. Walkies.

46
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,910
<i>Walkies.</i>

47
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,120
<i>Have a good day?</i>

48
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,790
<i>- Darling?</i>
- Yes.

49
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,390
- How was work?
- All right.

50
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,440
It's close today.

51
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,520
- Are you still going away?
- Oh, darling, please don't start that again.

52
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,780
- How long are you going for?
- I've told you.

53
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,820
- Fortnight?
- Mind.

54
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,290
<i>How long?</i>

55
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,790
<i>Ten or 12 days.</i>

56
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,870
No more than that?

57
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,880
I heard such a funny story
on the news this evening.

58
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,930
Does he have to leave his things
in the bathroom?

59
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,930
The minister of health...
What's his name?

60
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,350
He found eels coming out of his sink.

61
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,480
It was on the television.
Even the announcer was laughing.

62
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,230
Why does he put his toothbrush in my glass?

63
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,730
Carol, please.

64
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,830
We must get this crack mended.

65
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,590
What?

66
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

67
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,520
You're early.
I didn't expect you for hours.

68
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,860
I couldn't live without you
for another minute.

69
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,030
Idiot. Anyway, you said 8:30.
I haven't even started yet.

70
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,190
There's a marvelous story
in this evening's paper.

71
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,200
- It takes at least one hour.
- Huh?

72
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,450
Your rabbit. I'm cooking it.

73
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:33,540
Look. "Bring to the boil. Skim and allow to
simmer slowly for one and a half hours."

74
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,170
Yes. Well, we'll eat out tonight.
I'll take you out.

75
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,250
Here. Look. Read that.

76
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:43,210
Oh, I know that.
I saw it on television.

77
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,380
That bloody bell.

78
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,930
Eels.

79
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,020
<i>Pity it wasn't lobster though.</i>

80
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,560
You never give me a chance
to show you what a good cook I am.

81
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,690
Well, you can tell me over dinner.

82
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,240
You'd think they'd have something better to
do than clang away like that all the time.

83
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,740
Hmm. It's worse when they start
doing it at midnight.

84
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,410
I wonder what they ring it for anyway.
Perhaps they have wild parties.

85
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,910
Maybe they'll invite me sometime.

86
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,500
Go and put your best bib and tucker on.
I feel like a spree.

87
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,920
Ah.

88
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:27,550
The beautiful younger sister.

89
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
<i>Comment ça va?</i>

90
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,020
I thought you were eating in.

91
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,570
Aren't you going to have dinner?

92
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,200
Yes. I'm going to have dinner.

93
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,830
- But not here.
- No.

94
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,910
Not here.

95
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,250
Pass me that brush, will you?
There's a love.

96
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,630
Just because I go out once,
there's no need to start sulking.

97
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,510
- I'm not sulking.
- Hmm. Well, you're not exactly smiling.

98
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,810
Come on. You're not going in
for the Miss World competition.

99
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,110
Will we go and see
the Leaning Tower of Pisa?

100
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:25,190
I don't think Cinderella likes me.

101
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,190
- Cinderella?
- The little sister.

102
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,610
Ah, don't be silly.

103
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,070
Well, are we going to see
the Leaning Tower of Pisa?

104
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,240
She's a bit strung-up, isn't she?

105
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,750
She's just sensitive. That's all.

106
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,870
You can say that again.
She should see a doctor.

107
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,790
- What do you mean?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.

108
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,460
- No. You tell me what you meant by that.
- Nothing. Let's forget it.

109
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,990
You want to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa,
we'll see the bloody thing. Now let's relax.

110
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,491
- We're going to dinner, aren't we?
- Don't always change the subject when you start talking like that. You hear?

111
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,400
<i>Come along, boy. Din-din.</i>

112
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,770
<i>Time for din-din.</i>

113
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,280
Come along, boy. Lovely din-din.

114
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,970
Oh, come -.

115
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,980
<i>Oh!</i>

116
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,620
<i>Mmm.</i>

117
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
I'm sorry.

118
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,690
Oh, look. I've got to run.
I've left something at the flat.

119
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:17,730
Well, aren't you going to drop me off?

120
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,770
I've got no time.

121
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,530
Mmm. That's bloody hot.
No, you -you'll have to take a cab.

122
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,610
Uh, here.

123
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,080
Oh, here. Are you...
Am I gonna see you tonight?

124
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,080
Um...

125
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,080
I-I'll ring you, hmm?

126
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
I'll ring you.

127
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,730
Hello, darling.
How did you sleep?

128
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,230
All right.

129
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,990
Is he going to stay here every night?

130
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,370
I really don't think it's
any concern of yours.

131
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,050
He's married though.

132
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,390
Darling, it's my affair.

133
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,690
We all have to lead
our own lives in the end, you know.

134
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,820
Well, just don't stand around like that.
Go and answer the phone.

135
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Can't you see I'm busy?

136
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,200
- Hello?
- Miss Ledoux?

137
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,290
Yes.

138
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,000
How much longer are you going to
keep me waiting for the rent?

139
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,090
Oh. You want my sister.

140
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,340
- Ah. I suppose she's out.
- No, no. She's here.

141
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,630
Just a moment.

142
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,800
- Who is it?
- The landlord.

143
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,470
Oh, damn. He would ring up today.

144
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,680
- Hello, yes?
- Miss Ledoux?

145
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,440
- Look. I'm terribly sorry...
- I bet you are.

146
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,360
- Now look. How much longer are you going to keep me waiting?
- I promise -.

147
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,530
- I've had your promises before.
- I promise you'll have the money tomorrow.

148
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,360
That's what you said a fortnight ago.

149
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,370
You'll have the money
tomorrow without fail.

150
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,910
- Look. If you're not going to play fair by...
- My sister will bring it round to you.

151
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
<i>- Not you?</i>
<i>- N-No.</i>

152
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,000
<i>I'm going away on holiday.</i>

153
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,710
Now look, Miss Ledoux.
This time I've had just about...

154
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,840
She'll bring it round to you tomorrow.
I promise.

155
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,050
She better, Miss Ledoux.
That's all I can say.

156
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:56,470
Just the sound
of his voice makes my flesh creep.

157
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,140
Money, money, money.
That's all he ever thinks about.

158
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,190
Good heavens.
I shall be late again.

159
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,020
- Is Bridget about?
- Oh, she's downstairs.

160
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,100
Oh.

161
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,110
Bridget.

162
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,580
What's the matter?

163
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,410
- Nothing.
- Tell me.

164
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
Nothing.

165
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,960
Just bloody men.
Promise you the earth, and then...

166
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,380
- Oh, I could cut my throat.
- Don't talk like that.

167
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,390
I thought this one was different.

168
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,270
- Did he...
- Oh, he was a pig. Forget him.

169
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,650
Oh. Look at my eyes.

170
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,940
<i>Will Miss Bridget please come to the salon.</i>

171
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,780
<i>Mrs. Prendergast has arrived.</i>

172
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,820
I'll tell you the sordid details later.

173
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,740
Oh, why are they so filthy?

174
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,710
Don't be upset.

175
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,960
<i>Will Miss Bridget</i>
<i>please come to the salon right away.</i>

176
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,550
- Cheerio then.
- See you later.

177
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,030
- You're joking.
- No. You should have seen them.

178
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,030
They went for each other like those
women wrestlers in Hamburg.

179
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,320
One, a big lady with bloody great charlies,
tried to claw the other girl's face.

180
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,540
Got her fist right down her throat.
Two pints of bitter, please.

181
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,370
<i>- Two pints, sir?</i>
<i>- Lesbians?</i>

182
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,710
No, no. They both fancied the same bloke.
I should have his luck.

183
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,460
And then they started in with their teeth,
rolling about on the floor.

184
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,420
<i>It was like a madhouse. And I was</i>
<i>the only mug who tried to prevent them.</i>

185
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,550
<i>I ought to have my head examined.</i>

186
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,840
I wouldn't have minded seeing it.

187
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,550
Feel free, anytime.

188
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,720
- I ended up -
<i>- Thank you.</i>

189
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,100
My coat torn,
my shirt covered with blood.

190
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,900
If you like that sort of thing,
I'll introduce you to my cousin.

191
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,440
<i>- She's a black belt.</i>
- Black belt?

192
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,490
How did you get on?

193
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,740
- What?
<i>- What's your cousin like?</i>

194
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,410
<i>- Well, how did you get on with Little Miss Muffet?
- She sounds fun.</i>

195
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,910
- When?
<i>- Well, I thought you were taking her out to dinner.</i>

196
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,540
<i>Your cousin - what's she like?</i>

197
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,670
Is that the right time?

198
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,380
<i>- No, sir.</i>
- Oh, come on. Fill us in with the gripping details.

199
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,170
The gripping details are
that she had dinner with her sister.

200
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,640
Well, maybe you should try the sister.

201
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,290
Are you playing hard to get?

202
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,300
I've been waiting over an hour.

203
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
<i>Wh... What for?</i>

204
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,800
Well, not for Christmas.

205
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,220
We made a date. Remember?
We're having supper tonight.

206
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,390
Oh, I forgot.

207
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,890
Oh.

208
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,650
Well, next time you forget,
maybe you'll let me know.

209
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,740
It's not that, but...

210
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,830
Are you all right?

211
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,870
You look...

212
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,750
I don't know.
You look sort of-sort of funny.

213
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't feel...

214
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,090
I mean, I don't know.

215
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,510
Oh, well, anyway, come on. Now I've found
you, let's - let's go and eat something.

216
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,510
- I'm starving.
- But it's too late.

217
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,350
Look. Have... Have you been
fired or something?

218
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,530
All right. Come on.
I'll take you home. Come on.

219
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,240
Listen, Carol. I - I...

220
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,700
- I don't -
- Clumsy bitch!

221
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,700
For heaven's sake.

222
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,910
Carol!

223
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,910
Carol!

224
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,070
Dean doing a little
illegal bit outside the ring...

225
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,070
but a neat head butt there by Larsen...

226
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,190
and over to the corner
with Ray Hunter coming in.

227
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,360
Finally Rebel Ray Hunter comes in
after Stedman the giant.

228
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,870
And Hunter turning Stedman
all over the place now, but he...

229
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,330
still exchanged places with Larsen.

230
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:49,500
And Larsen again for Hunter. And now
it's Hunter in again against Stedman.

231
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,920
<i>Hunter really throwing Stedman around.</i>
<i>I don't know why he goes out.</i>

232
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,960
<i>And it's Larsen in again. Larsen comes in</i>
<i>with a twopenny drop. He's gonna need one.</i>

233
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,960
<i>Stedman almost into the ropes there.</i>

234
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,640
Darling.

235
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,310
What is it?

236
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:12,440
Don't you feel well?

237
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,980
Oh, I know you don't
want me to go away, but...

238
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,250
Hello?

239
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,000
Hello?

240
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,040
Hello?

241
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,010
Hello?

242
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,180
<i>But the first point to Hunter and Larsen.</i>

243
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,890
<i>Fourteen and a half minutes gone.</i>

244
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,860
<i>Mmm.</i>

245
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,710
Why'd you throw Michael's things away?

246
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,340
- Why'd you do it?
<i>- I don't like them there.</i>

247
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,680
It's got absolutely nothing to do with you.

248
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,680
You silly little fool.

249
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,700
I've put the money for the rent
on the table.

250
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,620
Oh, please. Don't go.

251
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,620
Now, please,
don't forget to give the money...

252
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,670
otherwise we shall both
be out onto the street.

253
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,590
- Look. Are you coming, or aren't you?
- Yes, yes. I'm coming.

254
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,720
Don't look so sad.

255
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,260
The time will pass very quickly.

256
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,100
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

257
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,520
Go on.

258
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,680
Oh!

259
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,640
- You're killing me!
- Sorry, Miss Balch.

260
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,470
- There's only -
- Good morning.

261
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,310
Good morning.
There's only one way to deal with men.

262
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,440
<i>That's treat them as though</i>
<i>you don't give a damn about them.</i>

263
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,070
I've told you all this before.

264
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,860
Still, I'm glad to see
you have listened to me just this once.

265
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,990
<i>There's only one thing they want,</i>
<i>and I'll never know...</i>

266
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,780
<i>why they make such a fuss about it,</i>
<i>but they do.</i>

267
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,330
<i>And the more you make them beg for it,</i>
<i>the happier they are.</i>

268
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:05,580
<i>- He rang me up this morning.</i>
<i>- I said he would.</i>

269
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,250
- He was practically on his knees.
- Well, make sure he stays that way.

270
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,260
I wonder, I don't suppose it would
do me any harm if I had a little snack.

271
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,430
Well, what do you fancy?

272
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:22,430
They're all the same, just like children.
They want to be spanked, then given sweets.

273
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,940
Perhaps a...

274
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,940
little Danish pastry.

275
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,610
- Tsk, tsk.
<i>- And a cup of chocolate.</i>

276
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,690
Carol will order it for you.

277
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,030
Carol.

278
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,820
Stop dreaming.

279
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,380
Are you feeling all right, love?

280
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,180
Carol, what's the matter?

281
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,930
<i>There's nothing you'd like to tell me?</i>

282
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,020
I mean, uh...

283
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,560
How do you feel now?

284
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,780
Still biting your nails, eh?

285
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:20,820
I think you'd better go home. Would you
like one of the girls to go with you?

286
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,080
No, please. I'll be all right.

287
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,750
Take a taxi anyway.
Uh, ask Millie to give you the money.

288
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,830
Thank you.

289
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,870
Hello?

290
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Hello?

291
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,770
Hello?

292
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,280
Hello, Carol?

293
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,990
It's-It's Colin. H-Hello?

294
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,830
Carol. Carol, it's me.

295
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,960
Carol. Please answer...

296
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,810
I'm running a business here, Carol,
not a rest home.

297
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,520
You can't just disappear for three days.

298
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:10,320
Are you sure - Well, I mean,
you're not in any trouble?

299
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,320
No, I'm not. I'm really...

300
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:16,740
But surely you could have phoned.

301
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:21,000
- Well, what is it?
- Mrs. Shaw-Taylor wants to see you.

302
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,870
All right.
I'll be with you in a minute.

303
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,630
Carol, I can't help you
if you won't tell me what's the matter.

304
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,630
Oh... Well...

305
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:40,350
Well, one of my aunts
came to stay very suddenly.

306
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:44,900
Oh. I was back at work two days
after I had my first baby.

307
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,650
If you're going to vanish
every time a relative appears...

308
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,820
we might just as well
put up the shutters.

309
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,950
I'd better go and see
what that old bitch wants.

310
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,530
Now, you go back to your work.
I'll talk to you later.

311
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,870
And, Carol?
Do something about your hair.

312
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:01,910
Yes, madame.

313
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,330
<i>- Oh, my God. Look, look.</i>
- It's nothing.

314
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,840
Out.

315
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,310
I should have your luck,
getting off early.

316
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:09,310
Come on. Cheer up.

317
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,280
Don't look so mis.

318
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,580
You know, you really don't look well.

319
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,210
- Is it a man?
- A man?

320
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:30,170
Well, I thought that maybe that smooth boy.
What's his name? Was making you unhappy.

321
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,880
You know, the one I've seen you with.

322
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,880
Are you in love with him?

323
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,590
I'm not in love with anyone.

324
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,970
Well, what were you up to
for the last three days?

325
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,220
Nothing. I stayed at home.

326
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:46,020
Oh, well. That's enough
to drive anyone up the wall.

327
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,940
You ought to go out,
go to a movie or something.

328
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,400
- Oh, I'd love to.
- That's it then. Do it.

329
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,820
We saw such a funny Chaplin film
at the Classic the other night.

330
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,450
What was it called?

331
00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:00,740
I thought I'd die laughing.

332
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,120
He was so hungry,
he wanted to eat his shoe.

333
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,740
- No.
- Yes.

334
00:59:04,830 --> 00:59:07,620
He pretended the laces were spaghetti.

335
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:16,090
There was this huge, great big fat man
who wanted to eat him.

336
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,550
- What? Him?
- Yes.

337
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:21,340
He wanted to eat Charlie Chaplin.

338
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,930
He thought Charlie was a chicken.

339
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,720
- Chicken?
- Yes.

340
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:30,980
And the chicken walked like Chaplin too.

341
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:32,980
You know.

342
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:40,200
Roger laughed so much,
I was quite ashamed of him.

343
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,030
<i>You ought to see it though</i>
<i>to cheer you up.</i>

344
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,360
Still keeping her legs crossed?

345
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:00,780
She's getting you down, you know.

346
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:04,530
The old, old story -
"Not before we're married, darling."

347
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:06,820
I wouldn't waste your money.

348
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:08,830
She seems a dead loss to me.

349
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:12,120
I mean, don't let her
being foreign fool you.

350
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,830
They're all the same, these bloody virgins.
They're just teasers, that's all.

351
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,920
She seems to have old Colin
nicely steamed up though.

352
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,920
She gets a big thrill out of it.

353
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,300
You tell her. She'll soon strip off.

354
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:25,880
- When I want your advice, I'll ask for it.
- Ah.

355
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:28,260
I do believe the old lad's in love.

356
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:31,010
- What about that then?
- Another good man gone.

357
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,310
I think your friends
are going to have to help you.

358
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,610
<i>Why don't you, um, take her over</i>
<i>to Reggie's pad one evening?</i>

359
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:44,610
Here. Steady on, John.

360
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,660
Oh, Reggie will lay something on.
Won't you, Reggie?

361
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,660
Or on something.

362
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,660
I can see the scene now.

363
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:58,920
Sweet music, soft lights, a big jug of iced
gin with, um, orange or lemon on top of it.

364
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,920
- Oranges.
- Why, tell her it's a fruit cup...

365
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
and three of the most eligible
bachelors in London.

366
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:05,010
Here. I'm getting excited already.

367
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:07,130
By the end of the evening,
she'll be begging for it.

368
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,640
- You'll soon be able to stop twitching.
- She'll weep with gratitude.

369
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,720
Yeah. Maybe we will too.

370
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:15,430
- Maybe you want your face pushed in.
- Here. Take your hands off me.

371
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,980
Colin, for heaven's sake.

372
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:22,020
Relax. Take a joke.
Hit me or something.

373
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:25,530
Now, look, boy. You've got it bad. Look.

374
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:28,280
You see?
He's been in the sun too long.

375
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,370
Look, it was only a joke.

376
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:34,370
There's no need to bloody bust out going on
like Cassius Clay all over the place.

377
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,750
- A joke, boy. Joke.
- Fellas, fellas, please.

378
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:40,830
If you go on like this,
you will be old before your time.

379
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,380
Look, relax, take it easy, enjoy life.

380
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,270
There's somebody there.
I can see your shadow.

381
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,360
<i>What's the matter?</i>
<i>I just want to talk to you, that's all.</i>

382
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,110
<i>Carol!</i>

383
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:42,030
<i>If you don't open the door,</i>
<i>I'll bloody well break it down!</i>

384
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:45,120
- No!
<i>- What?</i>

385
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:34,960
I'm sorry.

386
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,920
I'm sorry.

387
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,260
It's all so sordid.

388
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:54,940
What's - What's the matter?

389
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:59,820
I'm sorry. I just...

390
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:02,530
Well, I had to see you, that's all.

391
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,780
Honestly, it's been so -
so miserable without you.

392
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,080
I phoned and phoned.

393
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:16,340
The ringing tone nearly drove me mad.

394
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:31,810
Is it, uh - Is it something I've done?

395
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,780
Carol.

396
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,830
Please.

397
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,260
Tell me.

398
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,770
I'm not really like this, you know.

399
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:19,610
Oh.

400
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:21,780
I wish I could find the
proper words to say.

401
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:24,610
They just keep going round and round
in my head.

402
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:28,200
I - I just...

403
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,040
I want to be - to be with you.

404
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,460
All the time.

405
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:47,320
Hello.

406
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:53,540
You filthy bitch.

407
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:55,960
I'm sorry. Who is this?

408
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,710
Who is this? Who is this?

409
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:01,050
Who do you think, you filthy little tart?
You think I don't know he's with you?

410
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:04,220
You think you're clever,
but you're not that clever, you filthy...

411
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,960
Come on! Open up this door.

412
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:41,650
Come on. Open up.
I know you're in there.

413
01:19:41,730 --> 01:19:43,650
It's no use hiding.

414
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:45,820
Else I'll call the police.

415
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:00,140
Well!

416
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,980
Where's Miss Ledoux?

417
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:05,230
I am Miss Ledoux.

418
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:07,400
You don't look like her.

419
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:11,150
- I expect you want my sister.
- Expect?

420
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:14,150
I certainly do.

421
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:18,660
Where is she?

422
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:21,080
She's not - But I can explain.

423
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:23,370
Explain?

424
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:26,630
Well, I doubt that, my dear.

425
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:29,170
I can see it with my own eyes.

426
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:35,630
Now then, what's the idea
of barricading the door against me?

427
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:41,680
You're not only late with the rent...

428
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:44,180
but you're damaging the property.

429
01:21:44,270 --> 01:21:46,270
I've got the rent here.

430
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:56,200
Let's have a little light on the subject.

431
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,240
No!

432
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:02,160
I'm not a bloody owl, you know.

433
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:39,070
Ah, I thought I'd seen everything.

434
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:42,740
This is a flaming nuthouse.

435
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:00,430
I don't know.

436
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,430
Uh, do you always, uh...

437
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:07,270
run around like, uh, this?

438
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:09,730
I mean to say, it's a bit, uh...

439
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:22,620
What's the matter?

440
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,700
You ill?

441
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,500
Ah.

442
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:31,250
The, uh, heat's getting you down, hmm?

443
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:34,000
Uh, I don't like it myself.

444
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:40,630
I'll, uh - I'll get you
a... a glass of water.

445
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:44,510
You're white as a sheet.

446
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,930
Hmm.

447
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,940
What the hell is this?

448
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:00,950
Oh. No wonder you look ill, if you
have things like this hanging around.

449
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:06,620
It's the dustbin for you, my lad.

450
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,510
<i>Good Lord.</i>

451
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:33,600
Beats me
how you young people live in such a mess.

452
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:37,190
It's like a pigsty. Huh.

453
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:57,380
Ah.

454
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:00,260
I know. Ah.

455
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:04,300
A nice, hot cup of tea
might be better, perhaps, hmm?

456
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:13,230
Of course, um,
your sister's gone away, hasn't she?

457
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:19,230
Yes, uh...

458
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:21,940
A nice, hot cup of tea and, uh...
and an aspirin...

459
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:24,860
and you'll be as right as rain.

460
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:30,040
You must be a bit lonely, I expect...

461
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,000
now she's gone.

462
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:36,080
Yes, I - I should have guessed it.

463
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:42,260
All alone, by the telephone.

464
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,600
There's, uh, no need to be alone, you know.

465
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:57,150
Huh?

466
01:25:57,230 --> 01:25:59,480
Poor little girl.

467
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:02,190
All by herself.

468
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,450
All shaking
like a little frightened animal.

469
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,460
Oh. Ah.

470
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,460
Ah.

471
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,210
Ah.

472
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:34,140
They're your family, hmm?

473
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:36,440
Very nice. Hmm.

474
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:44,070
Yeah. There's no need
to be frightened of me, you know.

475
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:53,740
Is that you?

476
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:58,000
Huh?

477
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:02,500
Where was it taken? In, uh - In London?

478
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:06,670
<i>- Brussels.</i>
- Ah.

479
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:09,550
Ah. Brussels. Hmm.

480
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:33,330
I could be a very good friend to you,
you know.

481
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:40,120
You... look after me...

482
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:44,290
and you can forget about the rent.

483
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,050
Come on. Come on. Just...

484
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:53,140
Just a little kiss between friends, huh?
Come on.

485
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,490
You go on up. I'll park the car.

486
01:36:42,170 --> 01:36:44,130
Carol?

487
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:52,430
Carol! Are you in?

488
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,690
Carol?

489
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:41,980
I say, what's the matter?

490
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:45,650
What a terrible smell.

491
01:37:45,730 --> 01:37:49,070
What the hell's going on?
Well, get a grip of yourself, will you?

492
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:54,360
Now, what's the matter?

493
01:37:57,240 --> 01:38:00,450
Ba - Bathroom.

494
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:58,760
No! Oh!

495
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:02,390
Go in there.

496
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,980
Just sit... sit there.

497
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:25,580
- Have you got a phone?
- Who are you?

498
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:27,870
I need to phone. I need to phone!

499
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,460
- Want a telephone?
- Yes, a telephone.

500
01:39:31,460 --> 01:39:33,380
Oh.

501
01:40:08,540 --> 01:40:10,460
Everything will be all right.

502
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:13,710
<i>He's gone to the porter's room</i>
<i>to make a telephone call.</i>

503
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:16,210
She doesn't speak English, does she?

504
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,300
<i>Yes, I think she does.</i>

505
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:38,900
<i>What's the matter? What's happened?</i>

506
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:41,070
I don't know. We just came in.

507
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:45,580
Let's see. Oh.

508
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:47,660
<i>Oh.</i>

509
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:14,850
Now, you better not touch her.
They've sent -.

510
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:18,690
<i>- I won't forget tonight in a hurry.</i>
- Now, come - Now, don't touch her.

511
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,860
I'll get her some brandy.

512
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:24,320
- Has anyone called for an ambulance?
- Yes. He's gone to telephone now.

513
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:27,870
- Who?
<i>- Man we saw on the stairs.</i>

514
01:41:27,950 --> 01:41:31,200
<i>- Ah.</i>
- Can anyone do artificial respiration?

515
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:33,580
<i>You shouldn't touch her.</i>
<i>You shouldn't move her.</i>

516
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:36,040
<i>- Oh, dear.</i>
- I'll get her some brandy.

517
01:41:36,130 --> 01:41:40,710
<i>Somebody must help her.</i>
<i>Please, someone help her.</i>

518
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:06,320
<i>I wouldn't touch her. Don't touch her.</i>

519
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:10,080
<i>What's he doing?</i>

520
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:16,290
<i>- Oh.</i>
<i>- Good Lord.</i>

521
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:19,090
<i>- Oh, he's gotten her up.</i>
- Please!

522
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:21,420
He shouldn't touch her.
