00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:57,207
NARRATOR: On August 3, 1944,

2
00:00:57,207 --> 00:01:00,517
in the skies over the town of Vire,
in France...

3
00:01:02,487 --> 00:01:04,367
...the law of averages caught up

4
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:09,247
with fighter pilot Quentin Aanenson
of Luverne, Minnesota.

5
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:12,247
MAN: I was flying
the 'tail-end charlie' position,

6
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:14,607
which means the last one
in the line of flight,

7
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,607
which is the most vulnerable position

8
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:19,917
because that's the one
they'll start with first.

9
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:28,047
And suddenly the 88s and 20mm
started coming up in heavy amounts,

10
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:30,047
and just "Brmm!"

11
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:36,327
I heard this roar through my airplane
and fire came into the cockpit,

12
00:01:36,327 --> 00:01:39,007
just all in an instant.

13
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:44,081
My airplane was shaking.
I thought, "I'm gone."

14
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:48,687
So I tried to bale out.

15
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:50,927
I tried to move the canopy back,

16
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:57,407
and a piece of flak had come up
through the glide

17
00:01:57,407 --> 00:02:00,927
and so I couldn't get the canopy open.

18
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:02,485
Couldn't get it open.

19
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:09,207
The fire was still coming at me,
and so I put the plane in a dive,

20
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:12,995
because we'd always discussed
that we didn't want to die by burns.

21
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:18,607
And so I put the plane in a dive -

22
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:21,927
I was only at 4,000 feet,
so I could hit the ground fast -

23
00:02:21,927 --> 00:02:25,087
and that move literally saved my life

24
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:29,087
because the air pressure changed

25
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:32,487
and so the flames were sucked out
through that opening in the canopy

26
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:34,443
and that fire died out.

27
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:39,327
I got back to the base.

28
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:44,887
I would stall if my speed
dropped below 160 miles an hour

29
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:49,287
so I landed at 170 miles an hour,

30
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:56,047
and I didn't know that one of the 20mm
had come up through my left wheel well,

31
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:58,207
and I had a flat tyre there.

32
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:02,047
So when the landing gear
collapsed on one side,

33
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:04,407
I was still going
about 100 miles an hour,

34
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:08,927
and I was spun around by the force.

35
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:12,927
My shoulder harness on the right
broke loose.

36
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,607
The left one held.

37
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:17,607
I was spun around, and the back
of my head hit the gunsight.

38
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:19,927
So I was unconscious.

39
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:22,247
Then a couple of enlisted men
had pulled me out

40
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,007
and pulled me away from there.

41
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:31,007
After medics tended to his dislocated
shoulder and the burns on his legs,

42
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:34,007
a British photographer
from 'Picture Post' magazine

43
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:36,840
asked Aanenson to pose with his plane.

45

58

A week after his close call,
Aanenson was back in the air,

59

providing ground cover for the
Americans advancing toward Germany.

60
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:04,047
By the autumn of 1944,

61
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:08,487
the Allied advance
across western Europe had stalled,

62
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:11,647
crippled by continuing problems
with supplies,

63

who had hoped the D-day invasion
and capture of Paris

68
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:39,967
would bring a swift victory,

about their sons and brothers,

70

would put Tom Galloway,

a college student from Mobile,

73
00:05:55,727 --> 00:06:01,199
in an unwinnable battle where
the only victory to be had was survival.

74

Robert Kashiwagi, of Sacramento,

75
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:09,487
who had had everything taken from him
by his country,

76
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:12,001
would be asked to give even more.

77
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:16,287
And Quentin Aanenson, of Luverne,

78
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:20,367
who had lost so many friends
and seen so much death,

79
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:24,918
would endure still more horror
and nearly lose all hope.

80
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:33,847
Meanwhile, for those held captive
by the Japanese in the Pacific theatre,

81
00:06:33,847 --> 00:06:37,601
rescue still seemed a long way off.

WOMAN: Once the food started
going down, everything went down.

100
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:22,207
And toward the end,
my mother was 73 pounds.

101
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:28,407
And she nursed my brother
until he was three.

102
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:34,367
So if you see a picture of him
during that time, he is chubby.

103
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,727
And that's because of mother's milk.

00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:42,887
MAN: Everybody was scared to death
all the time.

171
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:48,407
And yet, you never said so, you never
gave any signals that you were.

172
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:52,887
You just were, and you knew
the other people were too.

173
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:56,327
You don't run away,
because every alternative is impossible.

174
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:59,367
There's no way out of it,
there's no way to change it,

175
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:02,487
and you are there
until you get killed or wounded.

176
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:04,407
Or until you flee

177
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:10,967
and, you know, allow everybody
to exercise their instinct for contempt,

178
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:13,967
which is unthinkable to most people.

179
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:18,087
So there's no way out,
and that puts you in a situation

180
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:21,443
that you're never in, I think,
in civilian life.

181
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:27,847
Back in Europe,
the Allies were still stalled in the north,

182
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,487
suffering from supply problems,

183
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:32,607
the disaster
of Operation Market Garden,

184
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,405
and intensified German resistance.

185
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:44,567
The American Seventh Army's drive
northward from the south of France

186
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:47,487
had run into trouble as well.

187
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:50,487
They had landed at Marseilles
in mid-August,

188
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:55,807
and at first things had gone better
than anyone had anticipated.

189
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:59,807
Within a month,
they had pushed almost 400 miles,

190
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,647
taken 89,000 German prisoners

191
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:05,967
and linked up with elements
of Patton's Third Army

192
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,287
to finally complete the continuous line

193
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:12,200
Eisenhower now believed essential
to the Allied cause.

194
00:16:14,967 --> 00:16:18,887
But thousands of Germans had
retreated into the Vosges mountains -

195
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:22,487
steep, thickly forested with evergreens,

196
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:27,447
shrouded in fog
and drenched with cold autumn rains.

197
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:33,636
There they dug in, ordered to halt
the Allied advance into Germany.

198
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:41,365
American units that had already fought
in the mountains of Italy

199
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:47,567
were sent to France and ordered
to battle their way through the Vosges.

200
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:51,487
One was the 36th Texas Division,

201
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,687
the same outfit
that had nearly been destroyed

202
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:57,087
at Monte Cassino the previous winter.

203
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,487
Another, attached to it,

204
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,767
especially requested by headquarters,

205
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:05,727
was the 100th/442nd Combat Team -

206
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:08,207
Japanese-American troops,

207
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:13,327
most of them recruited from
internment camps in the United States.

208
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:18,647
They had once been considered
a problem by the army.

209
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:23,675
Now they were problem-solvers,
called in when others failed.

210
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:28,127
MAN: It was bitterly cold.

211
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:31,567
That's when the 'lost battalion' campaign
happened,

212
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:37,207
because our general was very,
you might say, ambitious.

213
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:42,486
You say "blood and guts". Why was it
our blood and his guts, you know?

214
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:48,607
Major General John E. Dahlquist,
commander of the Texas Division,

215
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:51,087
was relatively new to combat

216
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:55,727
and had nearly lost his command twice
during the drive north from the Riviera

217
00:17:55,727 --> 00:17:59,047
for allowing his men to lag behind.

218
00:17:59,047 --> 00:18:04,007
But he was convinced he was a better
tactician than more seasoned soldiers.

219
00:18:04,007 --> 00:18:07,167
And he would prove willing
to use his detachment

220
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,807
of Japanese-American veterans

221
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:11,196
to correct his own mistakes.

222
00:18:12,487 --> 00:18:16,127
The village of Bruyères
was their first target.

223
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:20,727
Dahlquist assured them the surrounding
hills were only lightly defended.

224
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:26,167
In fact, they were filled with
well-dug-in Germans.

225
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:29,687
The 442nd cleared them off in four days,

226
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:34,807
despite the terrain, the steady icy
downpour that filled their foxholes,

227
00:18:34,807 --> 00:18:38,083
and the rain of artillery shells
bursting among the treetops.

228
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:50,247
MAN: General Dahlquist was, uh...

229
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:53,447
...a very strict general.

230
00:18:53,447 --> 00:18:56,447
And especially, it seems to me,

231
00:18:56,447 --> 00:19:00,567
that he was trying to push
the 442nd too hard, too far.

232
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:04,087
Telling us to "advance, advance",
you know.

233
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:06,327
So he was hard in that way.

234
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:09,842
And I really didn't have
any respect for him.

235
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:16,927
Meanwhile, General Dahlquist
had sent a battalion of his Texans

236
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:21,557
along a densely forested ridge
toward the important town of Saint-Dié.

237
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:29,167
Again, veteran officers warned him
the woods were full of Germans.

238
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:34,087
Again, Dahlquist insisted
there were none.

239
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:37,716
Within an hour,
the Texans were under attack.

240
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:45,247
275 of them were cut off
and surrounded by the Germans,

241
00:19:45,247 --> 00:19:47,920
who zeroed in on them from three sides.

242
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:55,720
For two days,
shells blasted their positions.

243
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:01,516
The Texans began to run out
of food and ammunition.

244
00:20:03,447 --> 00:20:06,166
Two attempts
to break through to them failed.

245
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:13,087
Finally, on October 26,

246
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:16,207
Dahlquist ordered the exhausted men
of the 442nd

247
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:20,807
to return to the wooded slopes,
rescue the 'lost battalion' -

248
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:23,287
as the Texans would come to be called -

249
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,926
and restore his reputation.

250
00:20:27,447 --> 00:20:31,447
MAN: One time, our regimental
commander, Colonel Pence,

251
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:34,567
pleaded with the division commander,
you know,

252
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,640
that we could pull back
'cause our men were so depleted.

253
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:44,367
But the division general said,

254
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:48,727
"No, we need to get those boys out,
because every day counts.

255
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:51,327
"You get in there and get them out

256
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,319
"if it takes every damn last one of you
to do it."

257
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:04,887
For five days,
fighting from tree to tree in heavy fog,

258
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:07,606
they tried to get to the trapped men.

259
00:21:09,567 --> 00:21:11,607
On the morning of October 30,

260
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:15,887
they were just 1,000 yards
from the survivors

261
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:20,687
but pinned to the slope
by artillery and machine-gun fire.

262
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:26,647
KASHIWAGl: We were stuck,
because it's a terrain that was steep,

263
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:32,767
and so we were on our own,
like a cowboy-and-lndian type of battle,

264
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:35,047
and so the other people couldn't help us.

265
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:38,607
Finally, they had had enough.

266
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:41,607
I Company
and Robert Kashiwagi's K Company

267
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:45,087
rose to their feet
and charged up the hillside,

268
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:48,447
hurling grenades
into German machine-gun nests

269
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:51,166
and firing from the waist
as they climbed.

270
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:57,687
KASHIWAGl: We just went
hog-wild crazy.

271
00:21:57,687 --> 00:22:02,044
We were mad at everybody
and ready to kill anything that there was.

272
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:08,887
And finally we made contact
with the lost battalion,

273
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:13,367
and we found only 230 or so surviving.

274
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:19,327
But we lost 400 men
trying to rescue those 230.

275
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:20,999
What a terrible price we paid.

276
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:25,327
TOKUNO: After we rescued the outfit,

277
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:30,047
why, the first Caucasian fellow
that came out

278
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:34,007
said, "I was never so glad
to see a Jap in my life."

279
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:36,127
Ha!

280
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:38,595
That's the first thing he said.

281
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:05,526
I Company had started into the forest
with 185 men.

282
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:10,197
Just 8 walked out unhurt.

283
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:16,207
Robert Kashiwagi's K Company
had begun with 186 men.

284
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:19,647
Only 17 emerged on foot.

285
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:23,765
All the rest were dead
or wounded or missing.

286
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:29,567
Kashiwagi had himself
been hit by shrapnel

287
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:32,684
for a third and then a fourth time
in the fighting.

288
00:23:41,927 --> 00:23:46,047
A few days later,
Mr and Mrs Kametaro Takeuchi,

289
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:47,967
formerly of Sacramento,

290
00:23:47,967 --> 00:23:52,647
now living behind barbed wire
at the Granada Relocation Center,

291
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:54,887
received a telegram.

292
00:23:54,887 --> 00:23:58,767
Their son, Tadashi,
had been among those killed

293
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:01,839
in the struggle to rescue
the lost battalion.

294
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:10,447
On November 12,

295
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:15,447
General Dahlquist announced
he wanted to review the 442nd

296
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:18,007
to thank them for what they had done.

297
00:24:19,247 --> 00:24:21,047
KASHIWAGl: The general decided,

298
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:25,727
"Well, now, we want to award
you people, recognise your deed."

299
00:24:25,727 --> 00:24:29,607
And so he said, "We want
the whole regiment in formation."

300
00:24:29,607 --> 00:24:34,847
And when the general got there
and looked at the formation,

301
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:36,847
he was so disgusted.

302
00:24:36,847 --> 00:24:39,964
He said, "I asked you to get
the whole regiment out there!"

303
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:45,087
And our colonel, with tears in his eyes,
says, "General", he says,

304
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:48,607
"that's all that's left
of that particular regiment.

305
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:51,121
"That's exactly what you did to us."

306
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:29,007
MAN: In the schools, we always talked
about what was happening in the war

307
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:33,127
in all the grades that I remember.

308
00:25:33,127 --> 00:25:36,807
Once in a while, we would have
somebody come home, you know,

309
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:38,567
who had been overseas,

310
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:40,607
who would come up to the school

311
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:44,607
and talk about where
they had been or...

312
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:49,607
You really... you know, again,
you know, between 6 and 10 years old,

313
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:53,607
I wasn't into the geopolitical aspects
of the war.

314
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:56,804
I was more impressed to see the guy.

315

(LIVELY JAZZ MUSIC)

316
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:24,447
MAN: I think every man that was
in the service was well aware of the fact

317
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:27,207
that when you came home on furlough,

318
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:29,527
it was a very good chance
that you would lapse

319
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:32,887
into a release of bad language, so...

320
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:35,567
It was dominant in your thinking.

321
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:39,087
It made you speak slowly
and deliberately

322
00:26:39,087 --> 00:26:42,327
and almost repeat in your own mind

323
00:26:42,327 --> 00:26:44,327
what you were going to say
before you said it,

324
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:50,887
because, you know, in the service,
you just don't use any adjectives -

325
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:53,767
you forget all your adjectives
and just use one or two.

326
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,207
WOMAN: Like?
Like I'm not going say.

My wife would come down from heaven
and hit me on the head.

329
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:16,647
FUSSELL: When you come on the line,
you are very brave

330
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:20,720
because you know nothing
about what's happening.

331
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:27,967
And it's easy for you to perform
pseudo-brave gestures and procedures,

332
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:29,967
because you don't know yet.

333
00:27:29,967 --> 00:27:31,567
And gradually -

334
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:35,487
this is because you have
a reservoir of courage when you arrive -

335
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,127
and each time you get badly frightened,

336
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:42,287
a little of it diminishes
until you don't have any left.

337
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,960
And that is the worst moment.

338
00:27:46,927 --> 00:27:50,007
As the lost battalion was being rescued,

339
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:55,647
Paul Fussell, a newly minted second
lieutenant in the 103rd Infantry Division,

340
00:27:55,647 --> 00:28:00,487
was bivouacked at Épinal,
at the foot of the Vosges mountains.

341
00:28:00,487 --> 00:28:04,207
He was 20 years old,
from Pasadena, California,

342
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:09,087
fresh from 19 months of training
and filled with excitement.

343
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:14,247
He had told his parents he felt
"very confident and safe"

344
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:16,567
as he went off to war.

345
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:20,847
The reception he and his fellow soldiers
had received

346
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:23,407
during their first few days
in southern France

347
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:25,637
only added to his buoyancy.

348
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:32,087
As the division moved northward,
up the Rhône Valley,

349
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:38,959
young women appeared along the road,
waving and passing out bottles of wine.

350
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:52,687
FUSSELL: We brought in good health -
very important -

351
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:57,007
youth, optimism...

352
00:28:57,007 --> 00:29:02,207
That's why these 18-year-olds
could pursue war at all.

353
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,767
They were kids. They were optimistic.

354
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:07,767
And they really thought that
if you did well, you'd be rewarded.

355
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:09,767
I mean, they were that innocent.

356
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:12,884
They had no idea about life's accidents.

357
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:19,287
On the night of November 10,

358
00:29:19,287 --> 00:29:22,247
he and the rest of the men
of Company F

359
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:24,007
were ordered up to the front,

360
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:27,807
to a thickly forested hillside
overlooking Saint-Dié,

361
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,447
the town toward which
the lost battalion had been heading

362
00:29:30,447 --> 00:29:32,483
when it was surrounded
by the Germans.

363
00:29:34,487 --> 00:29:37,847
They were to replace a weary company

364
00:29:37,847 --> 00:29:40,441
that had been engaged with the enemy
for weeks.

365
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:49,447
FUSSELL: I came across
two German kids,

366
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:52,687
dead, lying on their backs.

367
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:58,087
They'd been killed the day before
by the unit we were replacing.

368
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:02,087
And they were so young,
I couldn't believe it.

369
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:07,161
I thought they were between
maybe 12 and 14 years old.

370
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,607
And at the end of the war, of course,

371
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:16,367
the Germans were absolutely
scraping the barrel of everybody -

372
00:30:16,367 --> 00:30:19,325
old men who could hardly walk...

373
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:24,837
...and little kids
from late grammar school.

374
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:32,527
These kids had little uniforms on.
They were wearing caps, not helmets.

375
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:35,887
And each had been shot
through the head.

376
00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:41,567
And the blue... bluish-red brains of one

377
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:43,887
were coming out his nostrils.

378
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:45,887
They had their eyes open too.

379
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:51,687
And the other one, his bluish-red brain
was coming out just from under his cap,

380
00:30:51,687 --> 00:30:56,207
and sort of displacing his cap
as he wore it.

381
00:30:56,207 --> 00:31:01,687
And that really gave me a jolt.
I seldom refer to it.

382
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:07,047
But it was my introduction to some
painful facts - that this war is serious.

383
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:12,687
We are going to kill people,
regardless of their age,

384
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:15,567
as long as they're wearing
German uniforms,

385
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:17,637
and they are going to try to kill us.

386
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,962
MAN: I often wondered
why the Germans didn't quit.

387
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,360
I wondered why they didn't quit
after Normandy.

388
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:44,567
Once we successfully landed
on the Continent,

389
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:48,607
to me it was obvious
we're going to win the war -

390
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,007
it was just how long, or how soon.

391
00:31:51,007 --> 00:31:55,007
And all that we went through
and the people that were killed.

392
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:57,647
But what's your alternative?

393
00:31:57,647 --> 00:32:00,567
The Allied command in Europe

394
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:04,087
had not waited to see how
Operation Market Garden turned out

395
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:09,487
before mounting four more or less
simultaneous assaults on the Westwall,

396
00:32:09,487 --> 00:32:12,047
which the Allies called the Siegfried line.

397
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:16,324
Each had fallen short.

398
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:21,127
The Seventh Army overran Strasbourg

399
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:24,127
but was halted on the Rhine's
west bank.

400
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:27,287
Patton's Third Army took Metz

401
00:32:27,287 --> 00:32:30,287
and secured three bridgeheads
across the Saar,

402
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:35,042
but could proceed no further
until it could get enough fuel to go on.

403
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:41,287
In the north, two attacks were launched
by the American First Army.

404
00:32:41,287 --> 00:32:44,287
One was aimed at the German city
of Aachen.

405
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:47,967
The other intended to sweep the enemy

406
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:51,487
from the 50 wooded square miles
just south of that city

407
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:53,364
called the Hurtgen Forest.

408
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:04,887
MAN: The Hurtgen Forest
was the worst.

409
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:09,007
And you haven't heard much about it
because... it was just a mess-up.

410
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:12,407
There was no reason
to go through the forest,

411
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,167
but the generals kept wanting to
go through the forest.

412
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,407
And you'd put a division in there
and chew it up,

413
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:20,797
and they'd pull it out and
put another division in and chew it up.

414
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:26,285
It was a nightmarish place to fight...

415
00:33:29,047 --> 00:33:34,280
...with 100-foot fir trees that
in some places grew just 4 feet apart.

416
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:38,687
"It was so dense and dark
and shrouded in dank fog,"

417
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:40,367
one general remembered,

418
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:45,287
"that upon entering it, you want
to drop things behind to mark your path,

419
00:33:45,287 --> 00:33:47,801
"as Hansel and Gretel did
with their breadcrumbs."

420
00:33:51,207 --> 00:33:55,647
Two parallel lines of German pillboxes
and log-and-dirt bunkers

421
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:59,276
were hidden among the trees,
several miles apart.

422
00:34:02,847 --> 00:34:07,887
The pine needles that blanketed
the forest floor disguised trip-wires

423
00:34:07,887 --> 00:34:10,887
and mines the Americans called
'Bouncing Betties'

424
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:15,358
that sprang into the air
and went off at groin height.

425
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:22,567
The commanders who planned the battle
knew almost nothing about the terrain

426
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:27,163
and never came to see it for themselves.

427
00:34:29,127 --> 00:34:32,167
And no-one had been trained
to fight in such a place.

428
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:35,727
"We're taking three trees a day,"
one officer said,

429
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:39,845
"and they cost us
a hundred men apiece."

430
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:46,287
The first two divisions
to be ordered into the forest

431
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:50,327
would lose 4,500 men in three weeks

432
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:53,319
and move less than three miles.

433
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:03,360
On November 2,
the 28th Infantry Division followed.

434
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:09,647
With them was Second Lieutenant
Tom Galloway from Mobile, Alabama,

435
00:35:09,647 --> 00:35:13,447
an acquaintance of Sid Phillips
and his sister Katharine.

436
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:16,127
He had been a senior
at Auburn University

437
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:19,287
and was now a replacement officer
on the front lines,

438
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:25,726
a forward observer scouting targets
for the 109th Field Artillery.

439
00:35:27,687 --> 00:35:29,807
GALLOWAY:
The man I replaced got shot,

440
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:35,087
and it just wasn't too good to think
what happened to him,

441
00:35:35,087 --> 00:35:36,759
but then you've replaced him.

442
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:41,165
Targets were almost impossible to spot
from the ground.

443
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:51,007
Dense growth and constant fog
hid them from the air as well.

444
00:35:51,007 --> 00:35:53,167
Tanks could barely move

445
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:57,687
on the handful of narrow, muddy,
heavily mined logging trails.

446
00:35:57,687 --> 00:36:01,247
Soldiers could not see one another,
let alone the enemy.

447
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:05,687
"If anyone said he knew where he was,"
one commander said,

448
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:07,484
"he was a damned liar."

449
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:14,767
Despite everything, Galloway's division
took its first objective -

450
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,967
the little town of Schmidt -

451
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,687
in just two days.

452
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:22,884
The Germans took it back
the following morning.

453
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:29,281
The battlelines became totally confused.

454
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:35,807
We were all mixed up.
Give you an example - the medics.

455
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:40,007
There was only one building
that I know about there

456
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:43,887
and both the German and American
medics were using it.

457
00:36:43,887 --> 00:36:46,607
They were just bringing in
all the wounded

458
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:49,599
and both sides were using
that one building.

459
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:54,367
A steady, cold rain began to fall,

460
00:36:54,367 --> 00:36:57,087
followed by sleet, then snow.

461
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:59,726
Thousands developed trench foot.

462
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:03,927
When it was too painful to stand,

463
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:08,842
men took turns kneeling in the icy water
that filled their foxholes.

464
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:17,087
German 88 shells burst
in the fir trees above them,

465
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:21,797
showering the men with shrapnel
and dagger-sharp shards of wood.

466
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:27,327
GALLOWAY: The artillery
would hit those trees

467
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:31,807
and you didn't know if you were hit
by artillery or flying wood.

468
00:37:31,807 --> 00:37:34,647
There just was no place
to get protection.

469
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:37,167
The Germans had it,
they had it all mapped.

470
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:41,127
And you had to go down the firebreaks.

471
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:44,358
Of course, they would have guns
at those firebreaks.

472
00:37:45,407 --> 00:37:48,127
And it made it bad.

473
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:54,367
I just recall one morning
I went in with the battalion,

474
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:58,687
and before nightfall
the sergeant major came to me

475
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:01,287
and told me I was
the only officer they had left.

476
00:38:01,287 --> 00:38:02,887
And that's out of a battalion.

477
00:38:02,887 --> 00:38:07,287
And it just chewed people up.

478
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:09,278
(EXPLOSIONS)

479
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:14,807
"The days were so terrible
that I would pray for darkness,"

480
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:16,687
one private recalled,

481
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:19,724
"and the nights were so bad
I would pray for daylight."

482
00:38:21,687 --> 00:38:28,087
By November 13, the officers of every
single rifle company in the 28th Division

483
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:30,555
had been killed or wounded.

484
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:36,807
After a night
of continuous German shelling,

485
00:38:36,807 --> 00:38:39,567
an entire company broke and ran.

486
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:44,527
Even officers with drawn revolvers
could not stop them.

487
00:38:44,527 --> 00:38:48,567
Hundreds of men shot themselves
in the foot or hand

488
00:38:48,567 --> 00:38:51,127
rather than endure any more.

489
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:54,327
Hundreds more collapsed
psychologically,

490
00:38:54,327 --> 00:38:59,367
sat staring into the distance
as if no battle raged around them.

491
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:02,687
The reporter Ernie Pyle called it

492
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:06,727
"the accumulated blur,
the hurting vagueness

493
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:09,082
"of being too long in the lines."

494
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:17,727
In mid-November,

495
00:39:17,727 --> 00:39:21,037
fresh troops replaced what was left
of Tom Galloway's division.

496
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:31,003
The fighting in the Hurtgen Forest
would go on for weeks.

497
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:37,363
More than 33,000 American soldiers
would be lost.

498
00:39:38,927 --> 00:39:40,927
So many died,

499
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:43,407
and those who lived spent
so much time desperately digging

500
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:45,207
for their own protection,

501
00:39:45,207 --> 00:39:48,767
that there were few burials.

502
00:39:48,767 --> 00:39:51,047
When the snow melted
the following spring,

503
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:56,724
hundreds of bodies and parts of bodies
would still litter the forest floor.

504
00:39:58,727 --> 00:40:03,807
GALLOWAY: The men were...
well, you were just all beat up.

505
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:06,807
You'd been in that mess.
You'd been under that strain.

506
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:10,527
You just were glad to get out of there.

507
00:40:10,527 --> 00:40:13,847
I like to think that probably
the prettiest sight that I saw over there

508
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:17,287
was coming out of the forest,
up on a hill, and looking down.

509
00:40:17,287 --> 00:40:21,847
It had snowed, and the whole -
these were big fir trees -

510
00:40:21,847 --> 00:40:24,807
and they were all pretty,
with snow on and everything.

511
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:26,807
And I couldn't decide
whether the scene was pretty

512
00:40:26,807 --> 00:40:30,327
or I was so glad to get out of there
that made it look so pretty.

513
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,158
But I do remember that.

514
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:37,407
Galloway and his comrades
were sent for rest and recovery

515
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:40,447
to the Ardennes Forest,

516
00:40:40,447 --> 00:40:44,565
a quiet place where nothing much
was thought likely to happen.

517
00:40:55,487 --> 00:41:00,083
November 23, 1944 was Thanksgiving.

518
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:08,487
Defense workers in Mobile, Alabama
and Waterbury, Connecticut

519
00:41:08,487 --> 00:41:13,163
remained on the job
to help speed the day of victory.

520
00:41:16,527 --> 00:41:21,047
At noon, servicemen at McClellan Field,
in Sacramento,

521
00:41:21,047 --> 00:41:25,996
were serenaded by the glee club
of the 4909 Aviation Squadron.

522
00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:33,367
And in Luverne, Minnesota,

523
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:36,967
the local Lutheran church
held separate Thanksgiving services

524
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:39,242
in English and in German.

525
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:45,567
Thanksgiving turkey was served
to the men

526
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:48,567
on the forested slopes
of the Vosges mountains,

527
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:52,765
though it was cold by the time
it got to Lieutenant Paul Fussell.

528
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,447
That same afternoon,

529
00:41:56,447 --> 00:42:00,447
he found himself part of a 12-man squad
ordered forward

530
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:05,123
to scout the defences
of the German-held town of Nothalten.

531
00:42:07,687 --> 00:42:09,047
(GUNSHOT)

532
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:10,527
A burst of rifle fire

533
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:15,047
forced them to find what cover
they could behind a small rise.

534
00:42:15,047 --> 00:42:17,481
German snipers had them
in their sights.

535
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:21,367
No-one seemed to know what to do.

536
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:25,407
Then a second lieutenant
moved forward with his carbine.

537
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:29,167
"Let's get the sons of bitches," he said.

538
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:31,167
FUSSELL: His name was Abe Goldman.

539
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:32,967
And most of the people I fought with,

540
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:37,927
who were from the South and Texas,
Oklahoma and so on,

541
00:42:37,927 --> 00:42:40,927
had never seen a Jew in their lives.

542
00:42:40,927 --> 00:42:45,087
And the idea of this Jewish kid,
Abe Goldman,

543
00:42:45,087 --> 00:42:48,767
who should have been - in the view
of most of the other soldiers -

544
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:51,407
should have been in
the dry goods business,

545
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:57,927
to see him on the front line,
and he was very enthusiastic.

546
00:42:57,927 --> 00:43:01,407
He knew what had happened
to the Jews.

547
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:05,327
He was probably the bravest one
in the whole platoon of 40 men.

548
00:43:05,327 --> 00:43:07,367
And that's why he got himself shot.

549
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:08,516
(GUNSHOT)

550
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,927
And the fact that out of, say, 12 people

551
00:43:11,927 --> 00:43:16,487
he was the only one that
crawled forward to risk his life,

552
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:18,318
that sort of changed...

553
00:43:21,847 --> 00:43:23,838
...l'd say it changed a lot of minds.

554
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:31,767
The fight for Nothalten would take
a terrible toll on Fussell's men.

555
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:34,647
Abe Goldman survived,

556
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:36,727
but by the time the battle was over,

557
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:40,487
the company had lost four
of its six officers.

558
00:43:40,487 --> 00:43:45,727
Fussell's platoon lost 13 of its 40 men.

559
00:43:45,727 --> 00:43:49,927
The average life expectancy for
a junior infantry officer on the front lines

560
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,566
was now just 17 days.

561
00:43:55,527 --> 00:44:01,527
In the end, Lieutenant Paul Fussell
would beat those odds.

562
00:44:01,527 --> 00:44:04,087
But they would haunt him
for the rest of his life.

563
00:44:19,487 --> 00:44:22,763
AANENSON: Well, as we pushed the
Germans back and as they retreated...

564
00:44:25,327 --> 00:44:28,127
...they were able to take
all of their flak guns

565
00:44:28,127 --> 00:44:30,197
and most of their artillery with them.

566
00:44:35,887 --> 00:44:39,887
So, as we would fly missions
into that area -

567
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:44,927
in the Hurtgen Forest
or into the Ruhr Valley -

568
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:50,047
we were facing a larger number
of flak guns than we had before.

569
00:44:56,287 --> 00:44:59,359
So it was a terribly brutal time for us.

570
00:45:06,727 --> 00:45:10,047
Fighter pilot Quentin Aanenson
of Luverne, Minnesota

571
00:45:10,047 --> 00:45:13,727
had been helping provide air cover
for American troops on the ground

572
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:16,527
ever since D-day.

573
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:21,007
Through all that time,
his anchor to sanity had been the belief

574
00:45:21,007 --> 00:45:25,447
that Jackie Greer, the girl he'd met
while in training in Louisiana,

575
00:45:25,447 --> 00:45:29,847
would marry him if he survived the war.

576
00:45:29,847 --> 00:45:35,447
WOMAN: Following that war
was the best history lesson I ever had.

577
00:45:35,447 --> 00:45:42,567
I got a big map, and every day I'd get...
I had my crayons out.

578
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:44,087
Every day.

579
00:45:44,087 --> 00:45:48,767
Certain colours meant this group is here,
certain colours are this.

580
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:52,327
And I kept up with that war.

581
00:45:52,327 --> 00:45:57,037
I learned more about Europe
than I had ever learned in school.

582
00:45:58,127 --> 00:46:00,561
It was very important that I stay with it.

583
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:06,407
Aanenson and Greer exchanged letters
every two or three days,

584
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:11,800
each trying to keep the other's spirits up
till they could be together again.

585
00:46:16,647 --> 00:46:20,207
Aanenson had survived
a bad fire in his plane,

586
00:46:20,207 --> 00:46:22,967
was haunted by the fear

587
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:27,327
that he had once mistakenly fired
on British or American troops,

588
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:32,247
nearly died when his plane hurtled
toward its target so fast,

589
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,767
his instruments froze.

590
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:38,487
When he managed to pull out of his dive
at 600 miles per hour,

591
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:43,641
blood vessels in his eyes burst
and blood trickled from his ears.

592
00:46:46,567 --> 00:46:50,640
Meanwhile, his friends kept dying.

593
00:46:57,847 --> 00:47:02,727
AANENSON: Two of the guys
that lived in my tent were killed.

594
00:47:02,727 --> 00:47:06,607
There were just four of us in there,
and two of them were killed.

595
00:47:06,607 --> 00:47:09,767
I had been listed as missing in action

596
00:47:09,767 --> 00:47:12,247
because I had been so badly shot up

597
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:15,683
I had to land on a temporary airfield
closer to the front lines.

598
00:47:18,727 --> 00:47:20,207
Johnny Bathurst and I,

599
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:25,487
who were the survivors
in Duffy's Tavern, our tent there,

600
00:47:25,487 --> 00:47:29,687
decided that we couldn't
deal with that anymore.

601
00:47:29,687 --> 00:47:33,316
So we quit making friends, new friends.

602
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:39,207
On December 5, 1944,

603
00:47:39,207 --> 00:47:43,564
the impact of all that Aanenson had
seen and experienced overcame him...

604
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:48,967
...and he started writing Jackie
a very different kind of letter

605
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,844
from the ones he had sent before.

606
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:56,287
AANENSON: "Dear Jackie,

607
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:59,807
"For the past two hours,
I've been sitting here alone in my tent

608
00:47:59,807 --> 00:48:03,127
"trying to figure out just what I should do

609
00:48:03,127 --> 00:48:05,487
"and what I should say in this letter

610
00:48:05,487 --> 00:48:09,685
"in response to your letters
and some questions you have asked.

611
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:15,487
"I have purposely not told you much
about my world over here

612
00:48:15,487 --> 00:48:18,127
"because I thought it might upset you.

613
00:48:18,127 --> 00:48:24,127
"Perhaps that has been a mistake,
so let me correct that right now.

614
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:27,807
"I still doubt if you will be able
to comprehend it.

615
00:48:27,807 --> 00:48:31,595
"I don't think anyone can
who has not been through it.

616
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:38,836
"I live in a world of death.

617
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:45,315
"I have watched my friends die
in a variety of violent ways.

618
00:48:49,247 --> 00:48:52,767
"Sometimes it's just an engine failure
on take-off,

619
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:55,527
"resulting in a violent explosion.

620
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:58,327
"There's not enough left to bury.

621
00:48:58,327 --> 00:49:03,487
"Other times it's the deadly flak
that tears into a plane.

622
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,527
"If the pilot is lucky, the flak kills him.

623
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:12,682
"But usually he isn't, and he
burns to death as his plane spins in.

624
00:49:14,647 --> 00:49:16,727
"Fire is the worst.

625
00:49:16,727 --> 00:49:22,727
"In early September, one of my good
friends crashed on the edge of our field.

626
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:28,404
"As he was pulled from the burning
plane, the skin came off his arms.

627
00:49:30,527 --> 00:49:33,727
"His face was almost burned away.

628
00:49:33,727 --> 00:49:38,127
"He was still conscious and trying to talk.

629
00:49:38,127 --> 00:49:41,199
"You can't imagine the horror.

630
00:49:43,287 --> 00:49:46,927
"So far, I have done my duty in this war.

631
00:49:46,927 --> 00:49:50,807
"I have never aborted a mission
or failed to dive on a target,

632
00:49:50,807 --> 00:49:53,887
"no matter how intense the flak.

633
00:49:53,887 --> 00:49:57,367
"I have lived for my dreams
for the future.

634
00:49:57,367 --> 00:50:03,327
"But like everything else around me,
my dreams are dying too.

635
00:50:03,327 --> 00:50:09,727
"In spite of everything, I may live through
this war and return to Baton Rouge,

636
00:50:09,727 --> 00:50:14,287
"but I am not the same person
you said goodbye to on May 3.

637
00:50:14,287 --> 00:50:17,767
"No-one could go though this
and not change.

638
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:20,847
"We are all casualties.

639
00:50:20,847 --> 00:50:24,127
"In the meantime, we just go on.

640
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:29,687
"Some way, somehow,
this will all have an ending.

641
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:32,759
"Whatever it is, I am ready for it."

642
00:50:39,527 --> 00:50:41,927
When he had finished his letter,

643
00:50:41,927 --> 00:50:46,687
Aanenson folded it up
and put it away in his foot locker.

644
00:50:46,687 --> 00:50:49,647
Mailing it home
would only have been cruel

645
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:52,927
to the woman he loved
and hoped to marry -

646
00:50:52,927 --> 00:50:57,000
if he happened to make it through
what was still to come.
