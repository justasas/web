MAN: "Here lie three Americans.
What shall we say of them?

00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:10,447
"Shall we say that
this is a fine thing,

00:01:10,447 --> 00:01:14,447
"that they should give their
lives for their country?

7
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:18,447
"Why print this picture anyway
of three American boys,

00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:21,280
"dead on an alien shore?

00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:26,247
"The reason is that words
are never enough.

"The eye sees.

"The heart feels.

13
00:01:35,287 --> 00:01:40,607
"But the words do not exist

00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:46,079
"or feel what it is like,
what actually happens."

15
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:56,447
NARRATOR: In the September 20, 1943
issue of 'Life' magazine,

16
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:58,807
the editors had published
a photograph

17
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:01,607
taken on a New Guinea beach
in the South Pacific,

18
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:03,727
ten months earlier.

19
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:06,847
It was the first image
of dead American servicemen

20
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:09,287
that American civilians
had been allowed to see

21
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:12,882
in the 21 months since Pearl Harbor.

22
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:17,167
MAN: "And so here it is.

23
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:20,727
"This is the reality that

"The camera doesn't show America,

27
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:35,607
"and yet here on the beach is America.

00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:41,167
"Three parts of 130 million parts.

00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:46,167

'Life' magazine.

35
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:42,527
WILSON: The war
was always around us.

36
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:47,567
We had an air raid warden,
uh, a block warden on the street,

37
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:50,967
who wore a white hat
and a gas mask.

38
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:52,887
None of the rest of us had any.

39
00:03:52,887 --> 00:03:56,727
Uh, across the street from
my house on 46th Street

40
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:59,847
there was an empty lot, so we
built a victory garden there.

41
00:03:59,847 --> 00:04:03,847
And of course we all relished
the vegetables

42
00:04:03,847 --> 00:04:05,917
that came up the fastest.

43
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:14,047
NARRATOR: The war was now being
felt by every citizen

44
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:16,607
in every town in America.

45
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:20,047
In fast-growing Sacramento, California,

46
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:24,087
and quiet Luverne, Minnesota,
even children found themselves

47
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:27,967
caught up in the effort to win victory.

48
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,887
Waterbury, Connecticut
and Mobile, Alabama

49
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:35,567
had been transformed
into war towns almost overnight,

50
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,207
and in Mobile that transformation

51
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:42,677
would lead to confrontation
and ugly violence.

52
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:52,240
Overseas, victory seemed
a very long way off.

53
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,567
Americans had landed in Italy

54
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:19,647
and then found themselves
stopped by terrain and weather

55
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:22,647
and an implacable enemy.

56
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:28,127
There was still no firm date
for the cross-channel invasion,

57
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,087
without which, the Nazi grip
on Western Europe

58
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:33,123
could never be broken.

59
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,047
In the Pacific theatre,

60
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:39,367
more than a million Japanese troops

61
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:41,447
were on the offensive in central
and southern China

62
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:45,167
against the nationalist forces
of Chiang Kai-shek

63
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:51,047
and his sometime ally Mao Zedong.

64
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:54,447
The Americans were fighting
on Bougainville

65
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:57,567
and preparing to attack
the Gilbert Islands.

66
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:03,727
But Tokyo was almost
4,000 miles away

67
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:06,767
and the Japanese seemed
ready to defend

68
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,520
every island chain in between.

69
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:15,407
Over the coming months,
Robert Kashiwagi,

70
00:06:15,407 --> 00:06:18,367
a Japanese-American
from the Sacramento Valley,

71
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,887
whose family had been
interned by their country

72
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:23,367
simply because of their ancestry,

73
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:27,007
would nonetheless demonstrate
his devotion to that country

74
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:29,123
as few Americans ever have.

75
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:35,847
Family memories of heroism
in an earlier war

76
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:38,527
would help propel
a Princeton man from Connecticut,

77
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:41,727
named Ward Chamberlin,
to find a way to serve

78
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:46,287
despite handicaps that could
have kept him safe at home.

79
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:51,727
And Babe Ciarlo, a factory
worker from Waterbury,

80
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:55,247
would see things no-one should
ever have to see,

81
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:59,684
and say nothing about them in
his optimistic letters home.

82
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:06,247
Everywhere, the war was tearing
Americans apart,

83
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:09,007
and bringing them together,

84
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:14,923
and infusing every detail of
daily life with a new intensity.

85
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:27,407
FUSSELL: Every family
had somebody in the war.

86
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:29,207
And almost every household

87
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:33,087
had somebody wounded
or killed or missing.

88
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:36,767
Everybody had some bad news
they didn't want to talk about.

89
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:39,887
And it was very bad to bring up
the subject among strangers.

90
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:41,527
You'd say, "How you doing?"

91
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,407
Well, he'd say, "Well my son was
killed in Anzio last Thursday."

92
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:48,847
And so your relation
to strangers was different

93
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:50,927
from what it is now.

94
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:55,603
People were likely to tell you
if things were intolerable.

95
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:23,807
NEWSREEL: By January 1, Congress had
appropriated over $2 billion

96
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,487
for emergency housing
in America's war boom towns.

97
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,807
Here's how some of it
was spent in Mobile.

98
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:32,967
These are the slums we have seen.

99
00:08:32,967 --> 00:08:37,647
Slum clearance projects had been
the local, private enterprise

100
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:40,287
of a few high-minded,
far-sighted individuals.

101
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,447
But in Mobile,
such projects as these

102
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:46,757
have become one of the
obligations of good government.

103
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:55,767
They are rented only to
certified, coloured war workers

104
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:58,087
and are equipped with
auditoriums, playgrounds,

105
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:00,327
and day nurseries
to take care of the children

106
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:03,080
while their parents are working
in the war plants.

107
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:11,727
NARRATOR: To relieve the desperate
overcrowding in Mobile,

108
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:17,407
the National Housing Agency
provided 14,000 units for white workers,

109
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:22,356
but fewer than 1,000 for blacks.

110
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:27,447
There were 30,000 African-Americans
in the city now,

111
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:31,687
and just 55 hospital beds
that would take them.

112
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:35,767
GRAY: You had white water fountain,
and a black water fountain.

113
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,607
And a black would get into trouble

114
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:41,487
if he went and drank at
the white water fountain.

115
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:44,447
My friend at Brookley Field
had his head busted wide open

116
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,567
because he drank at the white fountain.

117
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:52,607
NARRATOR: 16-year-old John Gray
of 407 Royal Street

118
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:54,687
was working as a carpenter's helper

119
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,287
at Alabama dry dock
before the war began.

120
00:09:58,287 --> 00:10:02,167
There had been then no way
for a black employee

121
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:05,407
to be upgraded to the ranks
of skilled workers.

122
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:08,687
Similar discrimination was found
in defence industries

123
00:10:08,687 --> 00:10:10,687
throughout the Jim Crow South

124
00:10:10,687 --> 00:10:13,767
and in other parts
of the country as well.

125
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:18,487
But black leaders had insisted
on more jobs for black workers,

126
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:20,887
and President Roosevelt
had established

127
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,007
a Fair Employment Practices
Commission

128
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:27,247
to combat discrimination
in defence plants.

129
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:30,087
Things were beginning to change

130
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:34,687
even for the African-American
citizens of Mobile.

131
00:10:34,687 --> 00:10:39,047
GRAY: A lot of black people who
used to work in private homes

132
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:44,487
as cooks and chauffeurs and maids
got jobs at Brookley Field.

133
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:47,527
And it created some tension.

134
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:50,167
One white person asked
a black person,

135
00:10:50,167 --> 00:10:52,887
"Do you know where I can
find me a good girl?

136
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:56,407
"I'll give her $25 a week and car fare."

137
00:10:56,407 --> 00:11:02,039
And the black woman told her,
"If you can find one, I'll give her $35."

138
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:11,007
NARRATOR: With change came trouble.

139
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:17,247
In August of 1942, a city bus
driver named Grover Chandler

140
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:21,647
shot and killed Henry Williams,
a black private in uniform,

141
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:25,887
after he refused to move
to the back of the bus.

142
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:29,047
GRAY: And they put the bus driver in jail,

143
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:33,607
but they boasted that
he never stayed in a cell.

144
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:38,047
They let him sleep on a cot
that the sheriff used.

145
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:39,527
And then they let him out.

146
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:43,247
Eventually it died down, but nothing
was done to the man actually.

147
00:11:43,247 --> 00:11:47,047
NARRATOR: Tensions continued to rise.

148
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:51,487
On Tuesday morning, May 25, 1943,

149
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:54,887
they exploded at
the Alabama dry dock shipyard,

150
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:58,327
after management gave in
to a federal directive

151
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:03,924
and agreed to let 12 black workers
become welders.

152
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:09,047
ODUM: We were training them

153
00:12:09,047 --> 00:12:12,967
to be burners and welders
and become mechanics.

154
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:16,487
And the white people was resenting it.

155
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:21,327
NARRATOR: Shortly after the new
welders had finished their first shift,

156
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,487
white shipyard employees

157
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:27,047
set upon the first blacks
they could find, shouting,

158
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:30,198
"No nigger is going
to join iron in this yard."

159
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:37,647
ODUM: I'm standing up there watching,

160
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:44,487
and I never saw people so mad
and agitated in my life.

161
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:49,087
And they'd have sticks, like 3ft long.

162
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:52,367
They would knock them down
to their knees.

163
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:58,727
I saw men and women bleeding,
blood running down their face

164
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:01,887
and they didn't stand a chance
coming down that gauntlet,

165
00:13:01,887 --> 00:13:05,847
men and women on each side
beating them with sticks.

166
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:11,087
And a good many of the blacks
went out and jumped off the piers,

167
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:13,327
tried to swim the river.

168
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:15,966
Coastguard was out there
picking them up.

169
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:22,887
JOHN GRAY: The riot upset
the whole community.

170
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:26,807
Most people who worked
were afraid to go back,

171
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,127
because there would be a bunch
standing outside

172
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:32,687
and they would have their cars parked.

173
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,927
And in their cars they had
monkey wrenches

174
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:40,205
and tyre irons and stuff like that.

175
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:45,807
NARRATOR: More than 1,000 black
workers formally requested transfers

176
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:48,407
to other defence jobs.

177
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:51,607
The requests were denied.

178
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:54,687
Some left Mobile altogether,

179
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:59,127
but most were persuaded
to stay on the job.

180
00:13:59,127 --> 00:14:01,527
We had to send out and get them
and haul them back

181
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:03,087
because we needed them
to do the work.

182
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:08,967
And they came back because
we begged them to come back.

183
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:13,447
GRAY: And they would not go back until
they had some protection.

184
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:17,607
When they went back, this is
when you had to separate them.

185
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:24,567
Normally, one ferryboat
would take whoever came.

186
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:29,167
But after the riots, they had
a ferryboat to take blacks over

187
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:32,796
and a ferryboat to take whites over.

188
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:39,687
NARRATOR: In the end,
the shipyard itself was segregated.

189
00:14:39,687 --> 00:14:42,247
Four separate shipways were created

190
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:47,367
where blacks were free to hold every kind
of position, except foreman.

191
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:50,167
Blacks working in the rest
of the shipyard

192
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:53,487
remained largely confined
to the kind of unskilled tasks

193
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:55,527
they had always performed.

194
00:14:55,527 --> 00:15:00,047
The African-American newspaper
the 'Pittsburgh Courier'

195
00:15:00,047 --> 00:15:05,327
denounced the compromise
as "a victory for Nazi racial theory

196
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:08,487
"and another defeat
for the principle embodied

197
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:12,719
"in the Declaration of Independence."

198
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:20,767
In the following months,
there were racial confrontations

199
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:24,407
in industrial areas all across the country -

200
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:28,607
Springfield, Massachusetts
and Port Arthur, Texas,

201
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:32,487
Hubbard, Ohio
and Newark, New Jersey,

202
00:15:32,487 --> 00:15:39,996
and in Detroit where 34 people
were killed and more than 200 wounded.

203
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:46,327
Despite the violence,

204
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:51,087
the war was profoundly altering
life for African-Americans.

205
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:56,487
Membership in the NAACP
increased ninefold.

206
00:15:56,487 --> 00:16:00,487
The Committee of Racial Equality
demanded the desegregation

207
00:16:00,487 --> 00:16:04,162
of restaurants, theatres, bus lines.

208
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:12,807
And the 'Pittsburgh Courier'
campaigned for double victory -

209
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:17,198
over the enemies of freedom
at home as well as overseas.

210
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:04,327
KATHARINE PHILLIPS: Going back
through these letters

211
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:07,167
written to me during the war,

212
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:13,967
I find almost every letter will mention
"We had a V-mail from Sid."

213
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:19,247
He was the main concern
of the entire family.

214
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,447
Daddy would try to anticipate

215
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:27,287
where he thought
Sid would be sent next.

216
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:34,687
And when the Battle of Tarawa occurred,
we lived in horror for five days.

217
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:39,207
We thought Sidney was
in the Battle of Tarawa.

218
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:42,567
NARRATOR: Katharine Phillip's brother,
Sid,

219
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:46,007
who had endured four harrowing
months on Guadalcanal,

220
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:50,847
was actually in New Guinea
in November of 1943, not Tarawa,

221
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,447
preparing for an assault
on Cape Gloucester,

222
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,677
on the western tip of New Britain.

223
00:18:21,127 --> 00:18:27,475
SIDNEY PHILLIPS: It rained the entire
time we were at Cape Gloucester.

224
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:31,487
Everything rotted.

225
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:34,718
Clothes rotted,
your shoestrings rotted.

226
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:43,847
All the wounded were brought
right by our position,

227
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:46,287
and that was when
I decided I would like

228
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:52,167
to do something in life
that would amount to something.

229
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:55,727
And I decided that I wanted
to study medicine that day.

230
00:18:55,727 --> 00:18:58,807
Because here were
all these wounded

231
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:02,727
and there was no way
that I could help them.

232
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:06,967
NARRATOR: Cape Gloucester would be
a rugged, bloody jungle campaign,

233
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:10,127
but Phillips was fortunate
not to be among the marines

234
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,800
ordered to take Tarawa.

235
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:20,807
The hard-won victories
at Midway and Guadalcanal

236
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:24,527
had ended Japan's expansion
in the Pacific.

237
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:30,567
The Americans were free to begin
their two-pronged offensive.

238
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,327
While General Douglas
MacArthur's forces

239
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:36,607
moved north from Australia
toward the Philippines,

240
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:40,247
the Navy, under
Admiral Chester W. Nimitz,

241
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:44,727
began its advance across
the central Pacific.

242
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:49,527
Tarawa was part of
the Gilbert Chain, a coral atoll,

243
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:52,967
a ring of 38 tiny islands
around a blue lagoon

244
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:55,567
that marked the easternmost edge
of the perimeter

245
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:59,167
Japan had built to shield
its new empire.

246
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:04,527
The main target was
a heavily fortified island with an airstrip.

247
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:08,567
It was a only little larger
than New York's Central Park,

248
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:13,367
but defended by 4,500 Japanese
lmperial marines

249
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:16,527
hidden within a maze
of rifle pits and trenches,

250
00:20:16,527 --> 00:20:22,318
and hundreds of interconnected
blockhouses and concrete pillboxes.

251
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:28,367
Tarawa was to be the test case

252
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,887
for a new theory
of amphibious warfare -

253
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:35,087
any island, no matter
how fiercely defended,

254
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:39,797
could be taken by
an all-out frontal assault.

255
00:20:43,127 --> 00:20:46,007
The official version
for the people back home

256
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:49,317
was that everything
was going smoothly.

257
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:53,687
NEWSREEL: The invasion force
of warships and transports steams

258
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:56,007
for the conquest of the Gilbert Islands,

259
00:20:56,007 --> 00:21:00,727
and aboard vessels crowded with troops,
religious services are held.

260
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,487
The worshippers are fighting men

261
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:04,927
who know they are going
into desperate peril,

262
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:07,487
where many are destined
to give their lives.

263
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:10,047
And now, official
navy motion pictures

264
00:21:10,047 --> 00:21:14,199
of the bombardment of the Japs
on Tarawa with giant salvos.

265
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:45,967
NARRATOR: But the bombing
and shelling

266
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:48,567
yielded so much smoke and coral dust

267
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:53,322
that the fleet's view of the landing craft
was obscured.

268
00:21:55,567 --> 00:22:00,327
Firing was stopped for half an hour
to clear the air,

269
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:04,639
plenty of time for the Japanese
to ready themselves for the assault.

270
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:19,007
The landing craft,
meant to ferry the marines

271
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:21,407
of the 2nd Division close to the beach,

272
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:25,607
hung up on the coral reef,
easy targets for enemy guns.

273
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:27,607
(MACHINE-GUN FIRE)

274
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:29,327
Men were forced
to wade shoulder-deep

275
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:31,841
for hundreds of yards under enemy fire.

276
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:37,967
The first wave suffered some casualties.

277
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:39,727
The second was badly hit.

278
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:40,727
(EXPLOSION)

279
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:43,799
The third, nearly destroyed.

280
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:52,567
By nightfall, 5,000 marines
had made it to the beaches,

281
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:58,199
but some 1,500 of them
had been killed or wounded.

282
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:04,127
Maurice Bell, a neighbour
of Sid Phillips' from Mobile,

283
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:06,407
had watched the landings
with his binoculars

284
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:09,205
from the deck
of the USS 'lndianapolis'.

285
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:16,807
BELL: I could see the fighting
going on on the island,

286
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:19,247
just like if it was just
across the street here.

287
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:23,160
Looked like it was that close.

288
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:30,327
And soldiers and marines
falling all over the place

289
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:33,487
and you could see
bodies in the water.

290
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:38,487
And it's something that
I hope never happens again

291
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:43,561
because it's just things that happened
at that time I'll never forget.

292
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:26,247
NARRATOR: "A million men cannot take
Tarawa in a hundred years,"

293
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:29,159
the Japanese commander
had said before the battle.

294
00:24:31,007 --> 00:24:36,127
It took 10,000 marines just four days.

295
00:24:37,847 --> 00:24:44,559
But more than one third of them
had been killed or wounded.

296
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:51,087
The marine commander told the press
Tarawa had fallen

297
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:54,875
only because so many young Americans
had been willing to die.

298
00:24:57,487 --> 00:25:01,765
Outraged parents denounced
him for callousness.

299
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:26,927
Eventually, the War Department
reversed policy

300
00:25:26,927 --> 00:25:31,007
and produced a film called
'With the Marines at Tarawa',

301
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:34,487
containing combat footage
more brutal than anything

302
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:37,887
ordinary Americans had ever seen.

303
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:43,087
Some in Washington argued that
its release would damage morale,

304
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:46,796
but President Roosevelt himself
ordered that it be shown.

305
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:55,407
He wanted to give Americans a clearer
sense of what their men were facing.

306
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:58,487
FILM: These are the men
of the 2nd Marine Division,

307
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:00,327
who are now embarking

308
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:02,727
on a full phibious
operation after many...

309
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:07,007
When we saw those first pictures
of Tarawa

310
00:26:07,007 --> 00:26:10,127
we were overcome, just overcome.

311
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:12,287
For three days before we moved in,

312
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:15,487
over four million pounds of explosives
had been dropped on the island.

313
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:20,527
It was just devastating to us.

314
00:26:20,527 --> 00:26:24,727
Those American boys' bodies
floating in the surf.

315
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,807
The chaplain's assistants tend the dead.

316
00:26:26,807 --> 00:26:28,807
We just sat around and cried,

317
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:35,327
and I know that's why they'd kept it
from the American public for so long.

318
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,687
These are marine dead.

319
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:44,087
This is the price we have to pay
for a war we didn't want.

320
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:49,727
Our dislike for the Japanese
was very violent,

321
00:26:49,727 --> 00:26:55,882
that they would do this to us,
and would kill our boys like that.

322
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:04,487
And, course, the idea was "kill the Japs."

323
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:07,559
I'm ashamed to say,
but that's the way it was.

324
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:14,116
We just had to get that war over with.

325
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:38,687
NARRATOR: Mrs Martina Ciarlo,
a widow in Waterbury, Connecticut,

326
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:42,127
had two daughters and three sons.

327
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,607
The oldest boy and the youngest

328
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:47,127
were exempt from the draft
and safely at home,

329
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:50,807
but the middle son,
Corado, known as 'Babe',

330
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:55,807
was with the Fifth Allied Army,
somewhere in Italy.

331
00:27:55,807 --> 00:28:00,562
His letters home were the most important
thing in his mother's life.

332
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,887
OLGA CIARLO: She'd wait
every single morning on the porch

333
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:09,767
for the mailman to come
to bring her a letter.

334
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:17,247
And he would go by sometimes, and he
would say, "Mrs Ciarlo, not today."

335
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:20,807
So the following day she'd wait
again for that letter

336
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:23,127
and finally she would get
a letter, she'd be so happy.

337
00:28:23,127 --> 00:28:26,007
She'd run upstairs and she'd
let us read the letter,

338
00:28:26,007 --> 00:28:27,487
'cause my mother

NARRATOR: The Office
of Civilian Defense

354
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:02,967
called upon each American family

355
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,607
to become a "fighting unit
on the home front."

356
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:09,887
Everyone was asked
to collect scrap metal

357
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:12,327
from which armaments
could be made.

358
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:14,727
In one year alone,

359
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:18,766
Mobile's citizens amassed
22 million pounds.

360
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:23,567
In Sacramento,
22 big 'victory bins' were set up

on downtown street corners
for the duration,

362
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:30,327
even though some people
thought they were unsightly.

363
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:35,287
Luverne, Minnesota, had been
founded by Civil War veterans,

364
00:30:35,287 --> 00:30:38,367
but now the town council volunteered

365
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:41,767
to melt down the cannonballs
that formed part of the memorial

366
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:47,127
to the Union dead to make
munitions for the new conflict.

367
00:30:47,127 --> 00:30:49,127
And in Waterbury, Connecticut,

368

281,135 pounds of tin
were collected,

369

(MACHINE-GUNS FIRE)

378
00:31:54,607 --> 00:31:58,207
INOUYE: Consider the fact
that I'm 18, so...

379
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,040
...your emotions are
that of a young person.

380
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:07,767
I was angered to realise
that my government felt

381
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:12,447
that I was disloyal
and part of the enemy,

382
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:17,567
and I wanted
to be able to demonstrate,

383
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:20,567
not only to my government,
but to my neighbours,

384
00:32:20,567 --> 00:32:23,957
that, uh... I was a good American.

385
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:34,447
NARRATOR: After Pearl Harbor,

386
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:38,247
Washington had ordered
some 110,000 Japanese aliens

387
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,887
and American citizens
of Japanese descent

388
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:42,567
living along the West Coast,

389
00:32:42,567 --> 00:32:47,887
out of their homes
and into ten internment camps.

390
00:32:47,887 --> 00:32:52,447
All Japanese-American men of draft age,

391
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:55,247
except those already
in the Armed forces,

392
00:32:55,247 --> 00:32:59,957
had been classified as enemy aliens,
forbidden to serve their country.

393
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:08,887
Then, in early 1943, Washington
announced a new policy.

394
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:12,567
Japanese-American men were
now going to be permitted

395
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:18,642
to form a special segregated outfit,
the 442nd Regimental Combat Team.

396
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:25,767
When the army called for
1,500 volunteers from Hawaii,

397
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:29,087
where Japanese-Americans
had never been locked up,

398
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:31,847
10,000 turned up at recruiting offices,

399
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:34,767
including a freshman
in pre-medical studies

400
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:38,316
at the University of Hawaii -
Daniel Inouye.

401
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:45,887
INOUYE: And my father took time off.

402
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,559
And we got on the streetcar.

403
00:33:50,247 --> 00:33:53,447
And he was very silent

404
00:33:53,447 --> 00:33:57,360
until we got close
to the point of departure.

405
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:04,887
He cleared his throat, and I
knew something was coming.

406
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:07,247
He's not a scholarly person,

407
00:34:07,247 --> 00:34:11,247
but I know he struggled, and he said,

408
00:34:11,247 --> 00:34:14,887
"This country has been good to us.

409
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,887
"It has given me two jobs.

410
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:24,087
"It has given you and your brothers
and your sister education.

411
00:34:24,087 --> 00:34:30,247
"We owe a lot to this country.
Do not dishonour this country.

412
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:34,247
"Above all, do not dishonour the family.

413
00:34:34,247 --> 00:34:39,958
"And if you must die, die in honour."

414
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:44,567
You know, I'm 18 years old

415
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:49,567
and here he is telling
me these heavy words.

416
00:34:49,567 --> 00:34:52,887
And I've always thought to myself,

417
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:56,323
"Would I be able to say
the same thing to my son?"

418
00:34:58,247 --> 00:35:01,887
ASAKO TOKUNO: I think that they
may not really have known it themselves,

419
00:35:01,887 --> 00:35:07,247
but I think this feeling was instilled in
them through all of our parents.

420
00:35:07,247 --> 00:35:09,087
It's called 'yamata damashi',

421
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:13,247
and it's this, um, it's
like a proving of yourself

422
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:18,527
and that your loyalty goes beyond
just saying it or talking it, you know.

423
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:20,047
It's proving it,

424
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:23,127
giving it your all,

425
00:35:23,127 --> 00:35:27,207
even if you die in the process
by going to war.

426
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:30,007
And I think that's
so strongly instilled

427
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:31,967
from when you're very young

428
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:35,596
that I think that was one of the
things that pushed them on.

429
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:40,767
NARRATOR: Now, army recruiters
went to work

430
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:43,887
inside the internment camps.

431
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:46,407
Robert Kashiwagi, from Sacramento,

432
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:48,847
was bed-ridden from a lung ailment

433
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:53,045
when recruiters turned up
at Camp Amache, in Colorado.

434
00:35:54,847 --> 00:35:58,087
KASHIWAGl: When the recruiting team
came around,

435
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:02,047
they announced that
this is going to be

436
00:36:02,047 --> 00:36:07,767
a segregated combat infantry unit
slated for front line duty.

437
00:36:07,767 --> 00:36:12,887
And I protested very vigorously.

438
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:18,687
I don't mind volunteering,
but it's really unfair for me

439
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:24,207
to volunteer only to an infantry unit
that's slated for front line duty.

440
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:27,647
But we're only to have one choice -

441
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:36,407
volunteer to a segregated infantry unit,
or don't and call yourself disloyal.

442
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:38,047
My feeling was

443
00:36:38,047 --> 00:36:41,847
that the United States is our country

444
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:46,367
and if we disowned United States,
we were a man without a country.

445
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:50,327
We had no other place we could go to.

446
00:36:50,327 --> 00:36:57,483
So I more or less volunteered... from bed.

447
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,727
NARRATOR: Those
Japanese-Americans

448
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:04,847
already in the armed forces
when the war started

449
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,247
were reassigned to
the 442nd Regimental Combat Team

450
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:11,847
and sent for training
to Camp Shelby in Mississippi,

451
00:37:11,847 --> 00:37:16,967
where the Governor assured them
they would be treated as 'white' people.

452
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:23,847
KASHIWAGl: There were drinking
fountains marked "colored"

453
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:28,687
and "white" and you had
to adhere to the instruction.

454
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:33,167
"Can I go into that restaurant or
will I not be served?" you know.

455
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,447
These are the difficult
questions that entered my mind.

456
00:37:36,447 --> 00:37:42,887
And then when I got on the bus,

457
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:47,127
why all the black people had
to go to the rear of the bus,

458
00:37:47,127 --> 00:37:51,367
and whites stayed in the front.

459
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:54,647
That's confusing to me,

460
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:57,807
because I didn't know where
I was belonging to,

461
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,647
as far as a situation like that.

462
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:03,167
So I just, without any... without thinking,

463
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,287
I would always go towards
the black section,

464
00:38:05,287 --> 00:38:08,047
but they would turn me around
and put me in the white.

the Sacramento Valley,

467
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:24,123
was granted leave to go and say
goodbye to his parents.

468
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:30,447
TOKUNO: They gave us
a 15-day furlough.

469
00:38:30,447 --> 00:38:36,447
So I went back to visit
my folks at Topaz, Utah.

470
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:42,767
As I entered the compound,
the MP captain stopped me

471
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:47,047
and said, "Sergeant, have you
got any liquor in your bag?"

472
00:38:47,047 --> 00:38:53,487
I said, "Yes, I have a fifth of
whiskey to take to my folks."

473
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:57,887
The captain shook his head
and says, "Sorry, Sergeant.

474

"with my folks behind barbed wire."

483
00:39:33,447 --> 00:39:37,440

was in World War I.

506
00:41:28,767 --> 00:41:33,687
He was at Belleau Wood
and he was wounded twice,

507
00:41:33,687 --> 00:41:37,407
got the Distinguished Service Cross,
second-highest medal you can get.

508
00:41:37,407 --> 00:41:44,207
After he died, I was walking by
St Patrick's Cathedral,

509
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:50,847
and I saw Father Duffy out there,
the famous chaplain from World War I.

510
00:41:50,847 --> 00:41:54,447
But I'd met him with my dad
a couple of times.

511
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:57,407
So I went up to him
on the steps of the cathedral.

512
00:41:57,407 --> 00:42:01,447
I said, "Father Duffy,
my name is Ward Chamberlin."

513
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:03,607
He said, "That's a wonderful name."

514
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:07,487
He said, "Your father's one
of the bravest men I ever knew."

515
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,607
That'll break your heart, yeah.

516
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:14,367
NARRATOR: Chamberlin had been
captain of the Princeton soccer team

517
00:42:14,367 --> 00:42:18,847
when the war broke out,
and he was eager to do his part.

518
00:42:18,847 --> 00:42:21,487
But there was a problem.

519
00:42:21,487 --> 00:42:24,207
CHAMBERLIN: I couldn't serve
in the army or the air force

520
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:27,287
because I'd lost my eye,
my right eye, with meningitis

521
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:29,247
when I was about ten.

522
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,287
And so I was 4-F

523
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:35,687
as far as the military services
were concerned.

524
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:40,127
Then I heard about this organisation
called the American Field Service,

525
00:42:40,127 --> 00:42:44,887
which at that point were with the British
in the North African desert.

526
00:42:44,887 --> 00:42:49,367
NARRATOR: The American Field Service
was a relief organisation

527
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:52,287
that had been formed
during the First World War,

528
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:56,967
and now Chamberlin signed on
as a volunteer ambulance driver.

529
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:59,727
He had originally shipped out
for North Africa,

530
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:03,447
only to find himself
hospitalised there for six weeks

531
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,047
with a mild case of polio.

532
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:09,527
CHAMBERLIN: And after I did that
for six weeks,

533
00:43:09,527 --> 00:43:11,087
I was in pretty good shape.

534
00:43:11,087 --> 00:43:14,887
And I got some orders to report
back to my Cairo headquarters,

535
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:17,687
and I read them and they said,

536
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:19,847
"You're supposed to have
desk duty for a year."

537
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,767
So I just tore those up and
never gave 'em to anybody, so...

538
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:27,327
And ten days later I was in Italy.

539
00:43:27,327 --> 00:43:30,767
Exactly where I wanted to be,
exactly.

540
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:34,646
Wasn't so sure once I got there.

541
00:43:39,527 --> 00:43:43,047
NARRATOR: In early January, 1944,

542
00:43:43,047 --> 00:43:48,644
Chamberlin had his first taste of war.

543
00:43:58,487 --> 00:44:00,047
CHAMBERLIN: We were in
a forward position

544
00:44:00,047 --> 00:44:04,207
probably, you know, a half a mile from
the actual front line,

545
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:05,959
if you could call it that.

546
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:25,604
And the first guy that they brought in
who was so badly shot up...

547
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:34,287
...we got him into the ambulance
on a stretcher,

548
00:44:34,287 --> 00:44:36,687
and I've... I don't think
I've ever said this to anybody,

549
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:38,447
I went around the side
of the ambulance

550
00:44:38,447 --> 00:44:41,087
and just let everything out.

551
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,527
I just... sick, sick as I could
be for about 30 seconds.

552
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:50,159
And it's just... l'd never seen a body cut up
as badly as that guy was.

553
00:44:54,687 --> 00:44:56,527
NARRATOR: The Allies now came up
against new

554
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:01,527
and still more formidable German
defences - the Gustav Line.

555
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:03,687
It combined three rivers -

556
00:45:03,687 --> 00:45:07,607
the Sangro, the Garigliano
and the Rapido -

557
00:45:07,607 --> 00:45:12,727
and a chain of mountains honeycombed
with mines, pillboxes

558
00:45:12,727 --> 00:45:14,763
and sheltered gun emplacements.

559
00:45:17,847 --> 00:45:22,847
Its keystone was
the 1715-foot Monte Cassino.

560
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:26,247
Looming above the village
that gave the hill its name,

561
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:29,967
stood the most important
monastery in Europe,

562
00:45:29,967 --> 00:45:35,447
a Benedictine abbey whose origins went
back to the sixth century.

563
00:45:35,447 --> 00:45:40,760
Behind it lay the broad Liri Valley
and the road to Rome.

564
00:45:51,007 --> 00:45:54,167
Time and again, Allied forces
tried to fight their way

565
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:57,682
around its edges
and were stopped cold.

566
00:46:12,207 --> 00:46:14,247
Prime Minister Winston Churchill

567
00:46:14,247 --> 00:46:17,127
proposed a daring solution
to the impasse -

568
00:46:17,127 --> 00:46:21,327
a surprise landing behind
the German lines at Anzio,

569
00:46:21,327 --> 00:46:23,397
35 miles south of Rome.

570
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:28,919
It was a risky idea that would
take time to plan and execute.

571
00:46:31,127 --> 00:46:35,807
Meanwhile, the Allies -
including American, British,

572
00:46:35,807 --> 00:46:40,767
Canadian, New Zealand, French,
North African, Indian,

573
00:46:40,767 --> 00:46:42,767
and Free Polish troops -

574
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:46,047
would mount a series of
all-out assaults on Cassino

575
00:46:46,047 --> 00:46:48,845
aimed at somehow
breaking through.

576
00:47:19,487 --> 00:47:21,087
CHAMBERLIN: It was a horrible battle

577
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,327
because... we kept throwing divisions,

578
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:26,636
new tactics...

579
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:31,767
You couldn't get through there.

580
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:34,600
And we'd lost an awful lot
of casualties.

581
00:47:40,887 --> 00:47:43,367
The guys that I admired most

582
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:46,767
were the guys that were really
scared to death,

583
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:50,087
and did what they had to do.

584
00:47:50,087 --> 00:47:54,447
Some of us were too stupid
to, uh, feel so scared,

585
00:47:54,447 --> 00:47:59,647
or you just had some
protective armour, psychologically,

586
00:47:59,647 --> 00:48:01,567
that you put on.

587
00:48:01,567 --> 00:48:04,559
(GUNFIRE, BULLETS WHIZZING)

588
00:48:06,527 --> 00:48:10,007
But the guys I admired were
the guys who really were frightened

589
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:13,127
and went on and did
what they had to do,

590
00:48:13,127 --> 00:48:17,086
whether they were soldiers or
ambulance drivers or whatever.

591
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:25,087
NARRATOR: In the early morning hours
of January 21,

592
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:28,767
Chamberlin watched
as the 36th Texas Division

593
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:31,007
tried to cross
the fast-moving Rapido

594
00:48:31,007 --> 00:48:32,486
in the centre of the line.

595
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:37,527
"We might succeed,"

596
00:48:37,527 --> 00:48:39,367
its commander had written
in his diary,

597
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:41,835
"but I do not see how we can."

598
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:45,927
He was right.

599
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:47,645
There was no cover.

600
00:48:54,607 --> 00:48:57,167
The men stumbled
into mine fields,

601
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,761
drawing torrents of machine-gun
and mortar fire.

602
00:49:07,887 --> 00:49:10,687
Every man who managed
to make it across the Rapido

603
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:13,520
was killed, wounded or captured.

604
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:20,162
Some, who tried to swim back
to safety, drowned.

605
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,887
CHAMBERLIN: How anybody could have
sent people through that

606
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:26,445
I just can't imagine.

607
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:29,967
They were shot to pieces.

608
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,447
I saw them come out of the line.

609
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:34,007
They were walking, uh,
when I was, first came up,

610
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:35,887
they were coming out of the line,

611
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:39,247
walking down the side
of the road just, eyes shut,

612
00:49:39,247 --> 00:49:45,967
just... plodding ahead
one foot after the other.

613
00:49:45,967 --> 00:49:48,927
They looked like they'd been
through the worst stuff,

614
00:49:48,927 --> 00:49:52,007
and they had been,
they had been.

615
00:49:52,007 --> 00:49:55,317
Germans just sat across
the river and sprayed 'em off.

616
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:17,527
NARRATOR: On January 22, 1944,

617
00:50:17,527 --> 00:50:21,727
the same day Ward Chamberlin watched
the men of the 36th Division

618
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,527
stagger back from the Rapido,

619
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:30,167
36,000 Allied troops were scheduled
to land far behind the German lines

620
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:31,680
at Anzio.

621
00:50:33,887 --> 00:50:39,727
Their fate, and that of
the whole Allied effort in Italy,

622
00:50:39,727 --> 00:50:41,763
hung in the balance.
