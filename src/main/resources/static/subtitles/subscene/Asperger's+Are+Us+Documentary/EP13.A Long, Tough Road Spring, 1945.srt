00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:32,087
NARRATOR: When the people
of Luverne, Minnesota

2
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:35,967
and Sacramento, California,
Waterbury, Connecticut

3
00:00:35,967 --> 00:00:38,047
and Mobile, Alabama

4
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:41,407
went to the movies in March of 1945,

5
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:46,407
they saw and heard a sick and weary
President Franklin Roosevelt -

6
00:00:46,407 --> 00:00:51,367
so sick and so weary
that, for the first time in his career,

7
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:57,087
he referred directly to the paralysis that
kept him from standing without braces.

8
00:00:57,087 --> 00:00:59,047
ROOSEVELT: I hope
that you will pardon me

9
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:03,207
for an unusual posture of sitting down

10
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:06,287
during the presentation
of what I want to say,

11
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:11,167
but I know that you will realise
that it makes it a lot easier for me

12
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:14,447
in not having to carry about
10 pounds of steel

13
00:01:14,447 --> 00:01:18,247
around on the bottom of my legs,

14
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:22,647
and also because of the fact that I have
just completed a 14,000-mile trip.

15
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:24,207
(People applaud)

16
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:30,407
Roosevelt's strength was waning,
but his message was undimmed.

17
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:33,567
The war was still to be won.

18
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:38,447
It's a long, tough road to Tokyo.

19
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:42,927
It is longer to go to Tokyo
than it is to Berlin,

20
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:46,047
in every sense of the word.

21
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:50,327
The defeat of Germany will not mean
the end of the war against Japan.

22
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:52,767
On the contrary, we must be prepared

23
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:56,476
for a long and costly struggle
in the Pacific.

24
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:13,007
Americans had been fighting
for more than three years now,

25
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,127
and the number of dead
and wounded and missing

26
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:19,244
had more than doubled just since D-day.

27
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:28,927
The Nazis seemed at last
to be on the verge of collapse,

28
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:33,927
but American men were still dying
in the struggle to eradicate them,

29
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:40,241
and Allied planners feared the final battle
with Japan would stretch on for years.

30
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:50,487
WOMAN: I remember
going to New York on the train.

31
00:02:50,487 --> 00:02:53,767
In the station at St Louis, Missouri,

32
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:58,527
the platform was lined with caskets
with American flags.

33
00:02:58,527 --> 00:03:00,367
I could cry now.

34
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:05,087
It was just as far as you could see them
on the platform at the train station.

35
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:09,287
And I went down reading the name
in brass plaque, all the names.

36
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:11,967
And I cried and cried.

37
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,525
How could you not cry?

38
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:51,607
MAN: The Pacific, as one
experienced it, began at San Diego.

39
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:58,407
And you got a sense of what
a huge space you were going into.

40
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:01,807
That this was not going to be
like Europe,

41
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:06,007
where there was land all around
and it had names.

42
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:11,007
This was going to be nameless,
empty space, almost all of it,

43
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:14,636
with little dots of land in between.

44
00:04:20,247 --> 00:04:26,167
In March of 1945, marine pilot
Sam Hynes was 20 years old,

45
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:29,407
a former University of Minnesota student

46
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:31,887
who, like thousands of other young men,

47
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:34,647
had been made to grow up fast
during the war,

48
00:04:34,647 --> 00:04:39,847
passing test after test
on the way to manhood.

49
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:44,647
He had learned to live on his own,
had married,

50
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:48,407
mastered the dangerous art
of flying torpedo bombers

51
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:53,527
and had now received his orders to
proceed 6,000 miles across the Pacific

52
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:57,884
to face his final trial - combat.

53
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:06,527
Hynes landed at Ulithi,
the sprawling coral atoll

54
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:09,887
the US Navy had turned into
the advanced staging area

55
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:15,519
for the assault that was about to begin
on the Japanese island of Okinawa.

56
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:23,687
HYNES: It was awesome. It was huge.

57
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:27,567
The anchorage was miles across,

58
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:31,207
and it was covered
with ships of all sizes -

59
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:35,727
carriers, battleships,
destroyers, cruisers.

60
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:38,807
I'd never seen so many ships.

61
00:05:38,807 --> 00:05:42,727
It was like seeing
all the power in your corner.

62
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:45,605
And there wasn't any power
in the other corner.

63
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:53,247
Okinawa, 60 miles long and home
to almost half a million civilians,

64
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:56,887
was the gateway to Japan.

65
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:58,687
The Allies knew they had to take it

66
00:05:58,687 --> 00:06:01,847
before they could move on
to the home islands,

67
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:05,487
and were gathering
the largest invasion force since D-day -

68
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:10,207
almost 1,500 ships
and more than half a million men.

69
00:06:10,207 --> 00:06:12,596
(EXPLOSIONS)

70
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:33,567
Day after day in March of 1945,

71
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:37,719
American and British warships
fired shells and rockets at Okinawa.

72
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:53,165
There was little evidence
of the island's defenders.

73
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:58,445
Allied planners were not sure
just where they were dug in.

74
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:05,407
But they knew they were
somewhere on the island -

75
00:07:05,407 --> 00:07:08,007
more than 100,000 of them,

76
00:07:08,007 --> 00:07:12,762
well entrenched
and prepared to die for their emperor.

77
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:23,400
The Japanese Kamikaze pilots overhead
were willing to die for him too.

78
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:30,327
There were nearly
100 Japanese airfields

79
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:32,767
within flying distance of Okinawa,

80
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:36,167
and the pilots of some 5,000 warplanes

81
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:39,407
were preparing to sacrifice
their own lives

82
00:07:39,407 --> 00:07:44,197
in order to take those of as many
American sailors as possible.

83
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:53,727
MAN: They was trained to fly
their planes one way and no return.

84
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:59,087
And when they went out
after a ship or something,

85
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:03,647
they had their funeral
before they actually left.

86
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:07,927
And they knew they was
never coming back.

87
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,327
They was under the impression

88
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:13,727
that if they gave their life that way
for their country,

89
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:19,447
they had a special place in heaven
for them, automatically.

90
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:22,647
Which wasn't true.

91
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:27,447
Seaman First Class Maurice Bell,
of Mobile, Alabama,

92
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:29,447
was serving as a gunner

93
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:34,123
aboard the heavy cruiser
USS 'lndianapolis' off Okinawa.

94
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:43,719
On March 31, Kamikazes targeted her
for destruction.

95
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:51,287
BELL: I looked up to my right
and there was one small cloud up there,

96
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:54,767
and just as I looked up,
I saw a plane come out of this cloud,

97
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:58,521
and it was a Japanese Kamikaze plane.

98
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:03,447
The very instant I saw him up there,
he must have spotted our ship,

99
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:08,127
because he turned into a dive, instantly,
and was coming straight down.

100
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:13,727
It looked like he was coming just straight
to the very spot where I was sitting.

101
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,407
Our men back there started firing at it
with the 20mm,

102
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:22,080
and you could see the tracers hit.

103
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:26,687
The plane actually bounced off the ship,

104
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:29,927
but the motor and the bomb
went through the deck,

105
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:32,527
went through number three mess hall,

106
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:38,327
and right down there was three or four
or five men sitting at the table eating.

107
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,967
It killed all of them.

108
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:45,087
The bomb went all the way
through the ship into the water

109
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:47,123
and then exploded back up through.

110
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:56,887
They said that hole all the way through

111
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:01,199
was large enough to drive
a 18-wheeler through.

112
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:13,482
9 sailors died. 29 were wounded.

113
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:18,760
The 'lndianapolis' was sent to Ulithi
to have its hull mended.

114
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:28,643
Meanwhile, the bombardment
of Okinawa continued.

115
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:38,359
The invasion began on April 1.

116
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:47,687
This was the night before
Easter Sunday, the 1 st of April.

117
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:52,247
And Tokyo Rose, who was the
spokesperson for the Japanese,

118
00:10:52,247 --> 00:10:54,047
was on the radio.

119
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:55,727
WOMAN ON RADIO:
Japanese special attack planes

120
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:58,087
launched late Thursday night...

121
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:02,367
And having been through Normandy,
and they didn't know we were coming,

122
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:06,087
and here we are going into Okinawa,

123
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:11,367
and Tokyo Rose is telling us,
"OK, GI Joes, we know you're coming.

124
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:15,007
"We're going to give you
a Easter party when you land,

125
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,998
"and we'll be there waiting for you."

126
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:23,916
Well, that really sent shivers
up and down one's spine.

127
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:33,687
Navy Ensign Joseph Vaghi,
from Connecticut,

128
00:11:33,687 --> 00:11:36,047
who had been wounded
on Omaha Beach,

129
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:38,807
was among the 60,000 soldiers
and marines

130
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:41,927
moving toward the island that morning.

131
00:11:41,927 --> 00:11:46,087
He had volunteered to return to combat.

132
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:51,087
VAGHl: When we finally
began unloading, it was quiet.

133
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:55,487
As the landing crafts went in,
you just walked ashore.

134
00:11:55,487 --> 00:11:57,318
Couldn't believe this.

135
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,040
The Japanese mostly held their fire.

136
00:12:09,287 --> 00:12:13,678
Four divisions - 75,000 men -
would land that day.

137
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:19,637
The veterans couldn't believe their luck.

138
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:30,447
Marine Private Eugene Sledge,
of Mobile, and his outfit

139
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:32,287
were at the landing too,

140
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:37,287
and so relieved, they began to sing
the popular hit 'Little Brown Jug'

141
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:41,247
as they unloaded their gear
and started inland.

142
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:43,207
They had been warned

143
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:47,247
that they would be likely to lose
8 out of 10 men

144
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:49,927
before they could make it off the beach.

145
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:51,918
They lost none.

146
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:57,447
They were pleasantly surprised
by the terrain as well.

147
00:12:57,447 --> 00:13:01,327
It was "Pastoral and handsomely
terraced," Sledge remembered,

148
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:05,479
"like a picture postcard
of an Oriental landscape."

149
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:13,047
MAN: "The weather was cool, and
there was the wonderful smell of pines,

150
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:15,847
"which reminded me of home.

151
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:18,087
"It was such a beautiful island.

152
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:24,037
"You really could not believe that
there was going to be a battle there."

153
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:36,326
American infantry and tanks
raced across the island, cutting it in two.

154
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:40,687
Then, as Sledge and the marines
moved north

155
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:44,007
to clear the central
and northern parts of the island,

156
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:48,046
the army turned south
toward the main Japanese defences...

157
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:54,362
...where they began to face
increasingly strong opposition.

158
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:12,202
Offshore, the navy continued
to have its hands full.

159
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:19,087
NEWSREEL: Sky full of flak
as the Japs attack warships

160
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:21,247
supporting the invasion of Okinawa.

161
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:26,321
Scenes of plunging planes,
and enemy bombs land perilously near.

162
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:43,767
A low-flying enemy speeds
toward a warship target.

163
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:46,527
Will the guns bring it down
before it gets to its mark?

164
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,847
(ARTILLERY FIRE)

165
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,361
Yes! It's hit, on fire, and crashes.

166
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:03,487
On April 6, Japan loosed a new tactic
against the Allied ships.

167
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:09,327
Not single Kamikazes now,
but flights of hundreds of them at a time,

168
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:12,285
dropping out of the sky
to attack the fleet.

169
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:38,684
The Japanese called these deadly flights
'floating chrysanthemums'.

170
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:48,598
(ALARM BLARES)

171
00:15:54,327 --> 00:16:00,607
By the end of the day, they had
seriously damaged 17 American vessels

172
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:04,122
and killed 367 sailors.

173
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:10,447
We lost more ships, we lost
more sailors, we lost more men,

174
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,367
and it was a horror.

175
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:16,155
It was one of the worst battles
of the Pacific, really.

176
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:30,207
As the land battle for Okinawa
intensified,

177
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,767
the floating chrysanthemums
would return again and again,

178
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:39,682
taking a terrible toll
on the men and ships.

179
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:27,396
MAN: If we had an invasion of Japan,
we knew we were dead.

180
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,687
They issued orders later

181
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:39,847
that the minute American or
Allied forces landed on their homeland,

182
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:41,847
to shoot all prisoners of war.

183
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:44,884
So we had basically accepted our fate.

184
00:17:49,047 --> 00:17:54,407
Glenn Frazier was one
of 168,000 Allied prisoners of war

185
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,447
still in Japanese hands.

186
00:17:57,447 --> 00:18:01,047
He had been a captive
since the surrender on Bataán

187
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,767
in the spring of 1942.

188
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:07,927
He was now in his fourth
POW camp in Japan,

189
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:13,923
at Suruga, south-west of Tokyo,
on the Sea of Japan.

190
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:20,487
One day, their captors
permitted 50 prisoners

191
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:24,407
to wash their own filthy clothes
in the ocean.

192
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:29,487
They were sitting around
waiting for their clothes to dry

193
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:34,356
when carrier-based American bombers
roared in to attack the port.

194
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:44,207
FRAZIER: We run out of the warehouse
at the end of the dock,

195
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,367
and across the railroad tracks,
and was waving.

196
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:51,887
And we knew then that
the aircraft carrier planes were close.

197
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:56,207
And we knew that
the end was coming close.

198
00:18:56,207 --> 00:19:02,727
But that did not help our feelings
as to what was about to happen.

199
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:06,083
Our lives were going to be sacrificed.

200
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,367
MAN ON RADIO:
We interrupt this program

201
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:21,367
to bring you a special news bulletin
from CBS World News.

202
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:25,967
A press association has just announced
that President Roosevelt is dead.

203
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:28,247
The President died
of a cerebral haemorrhage.

204
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:34,127
All we know so far is that the President
died at Warm Springs, in Georgia.

205
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:37,247
WOMAN: We can all tell you
where we were

206
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:41,567
when we heard that Roosevelt had died.

207
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:45,047
President Roosevelt was really

208
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:50,407
the binding force for the United States.

209
00:19:50,407 --> 00:19:54,847
When he would come on
and give his fireside chats,

210
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:57,807
we all gathered around the radio

211
00:19:57,807 --> 00:20:01,407
and everyone looked to him
for leadership.

212
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,447
He had led us out of the Depression,

213
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:10,283
so we felt that certainly
he could lead us through a war.

214
00:20:18,407 --> 00:20:23,607
And when the news came in April
that he had died,

215
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:28,965
it was a terrible blow
to the entire country.

216
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:37,487
MAN: It was catastrophic, because
he was the only president we knew

217
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:41,321
for the first 12, 13 years of our life.

218
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:49,727
Now, the thing was, my parents were
Republicans and hated Roosevelt,

219
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:52,958
but I loved him
and most of us kids loved him too.

220
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:57,047
Because he was the face of America

221
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,801
that was saying,
"Hey, things are going to be OK."

222
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:25,327
HYNES: I was standing
outside a quonset hut

223
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:31,487
looking across the little strait between
Saipan and Tinian, the next island,

224
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:35,087
and I felt a great sense of loss.

225
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:37,247
More than that, I think -

226
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:44,198
"How will we go on fighting the war
when our commander-in-chief is dead?"

227
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:49,487
MAN: We were all very sad about it.

228
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:55,807
Less about his leaving
than about the irony of it.

229
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:59,607
If he'd died a few months later,

230
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:03,919
he could have seen the success
of what he had done.

231
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:10,167
The men of the
100th/442nd Combat Team,

232
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:13,527
the Japanese-American unit
that had already distinguished itself

233
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:16,087
in the fighting for Italy and France,

234
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:19,007
were back in the mountains
of northern Italy

235
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:22,327
when they got word
of Roosevelt's death.

236
00:22:22,327 --> 00:22:26,407
He had signed the order
that sent to internment camps

237
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:30,127
the families from which
many of them had come,

238
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:34,007
but he had also provided them
with the opportunity

239
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:38,007
to prove their loyalty on the battlefield.

240
00:22:38,007 --> 00:22:41,795
It was that FDR
they chose to remember.

241
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:45,687
MAN: I remember that day,

242
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:49,327
because when we got the word,

243
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:53,807
suddenly men in my platoon

244
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,321
took out their bayonets and put it on.

245
00:22:57,527 --> 00:22:59,767
And I said, "What's happening here?"

246
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:06,207
He says, "Well, I think we've
got to do this one for the old man."

247
00:23:06,207 --> 00:23:09,995
They just stood up and started attacking.

248
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:14,647
Radio calls coming in
from the company commander,

249
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:17,167
"What in the hell are you doing?"
You know.

250
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,847
"You're not supposed to be attacking."

251
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:21,600
I says, "Captain, you can't stop them."

252
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:30,047
And so they're all moving forward for
the old man, a man they had never met.

253

Many Americans,

255

couldn't even remember
the name of the man

taking me down to Louisiana,

Fighter pilot Quentin Aanenson,
of Luverne, Minnesota,

273
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:55,927
was home on leave that April.

274
00:24:55,927 --> 00:25:01,047
He had been in more or less continuous
combat in Europe since D-day -

275
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:06,687
10 ghastly months, during which
he'd killed men and seen friends killed

276
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:10,767
and come very close
to collapsing from despair.

277
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:16,367
He expected soon to be ordered
into action again, in the Pacific this time,

278
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:19,007
and he desperately wanted
to see Jackie Greer,

279
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:24,287
the Louisiana girl with whom
he'd fallen in love before going overseas.

280
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:29,807
Her letters had been
Aanenson's anchor to sanity.

281
00:25:29,807 --> 00:25:34,327
WOMAN: I prayed for him to come back,

282
00:25:34,327 --> 00:25:38,887
and I just felt like my prayers
would be answered.

283
00:25:38,887 --> 00:25:41,167
I was walking down the street

284
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,767
and I saw the wedding dress
in a window.

285
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:50,847
So I went right in and I bought that dress
and shipped it to my mother

286
00:25:50,847 --> 00:25:54,487
and I said, "Have this ready for me.
I'm going to need it."

287
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:59,207
Now the two were to meet again.

288
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:04,887
AANENSON: And I had to adjust
to being away from the war.

289
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:10,407
The silence was difficult to get used to.

290
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:16,807
But it was such an exciting
and unbelievable moment.

291
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:21,807
I was alive, and this was Jackie.

292
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:25,207
GREER: The first night,
we were in the living room

293
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:29,847
and he formally proposed to me.

294
00:26:29,847 --> 00:26:35,807
And for some reason I got shy

295
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:40,047
and I couldn't quite make myself
say yes.

296
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:45,567
I don't know why, because I'd been
saying yes for 11 months, you know.

297
00:26:45,567 --> 00:26:51,207
And when I hesitated
and couldn't quite say yes,

298
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:54,127
he said, "Well, now,
just make up your mind."

299
00:26:54,127 --> 00:26:56,807
The funny part was,

300
00:26:56,807 --> 00:27:01,127
the door right near my chair was closed,

301
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:04,327
and on the other side of that door
was my bed

302
00:27:04,327 --> 00:27:08,479
with that gorgeous wedding dress
spread out all over it.

303
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:15,087
AANENSON: I was going to be
going back to the war.

304
00:27:15,087 --> 00:27:18,367
I didn't want to face the idea
that she could end up

305
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:21,807
being a widow in a couple of months.

306
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,367
But the more we talked about it,

307
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:29,087
the more we decided,
"Let's get married now."

308
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:33,847
So we got married on April 17,

309
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:36,767
two and a half weeks after I got home,

310
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:39,964
in the First Methodist Church
in Baton Rouge.

311
00:27:43,047 --> 00:27:47,327
As I saw her coming down that aisle,

312
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:51,639
it was just a thrill beyond belief.

In their stupendous advances,

the Russian armies
feature massed artillery.

00:28:20,287 --> 00:28:23,677
The kind of warfare the Russians wage
on the road to Berlin.

By the middle of April 1945,

318

Soviet troops were just
30 miles from Berlin

319
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:39,047
and bent on revenge

00:28:39,047 --> 00:28:43,120
for the horrors the Nazis had inflicted
on their homeland.

321

that the armies under his command

toward the German capital.

The deadly task of capturing the city
would go to the Red Army.

324

Hitler called upon his people
to resist to the end.

336
00:30:04,007 --> 00:30:06,087
That's what I thought it was.

337
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:10,927
I fell down and I got up
and kept on moving.

338
00:30:10,927 --> 00:30:15,367
I had a bullet go right through
my abdomen.

339
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:19,076
Came out just about
a quarter inch from my spine.

340
00:30:21,207 --> 00:30:24,607
Three machine-gun nests
were firing down at Inouye

341
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:27,527
as he continued
to lead his men up the slope.

342
00:30:27,527 --> 00:30:30,407
He hurled a grenade
to knock out the first one,

343
00:30:30,407 --> 00:30:33,407
then killed its crew with his Tommy gun.

344
00:30:33,407 --> 00:30:37,527
He silenced the next gun
with two more grenades.

345
00:30:37,527 --> 00:30:41,167
As he pulled the pin on yet another

346
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:44,967
and got ready to throw it
into the third machine-gun nest,

347
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:49,127
German shrapnel nearly severed
Inouye's right arm.

348
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:51,727
Somehow, with his left hand,

349
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:56,607
he pried his dead fingers
from the live grenade and threw it,

350
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:59,280
then started up the hill again.

351
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:04,287
INOUYE: According to the men and
according to my company commander,

352
00:31:04,287 --> 00:31:08,287
he says, "For a moment,
you went berserk.

353
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:10,687
"You picked up your gun."

354
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:12,687
I had a Thompson submachine gun,

355
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:14,367
and with my left hand,

356
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:19,047
started approaching
the last machine-gun nest,

357
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:22,567
just firing it,
with the blood splattering out.

358
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:24,683
It was a horrible sight, I think.

359
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:29,247
Finally, I got hit again on my leg,

360
00:31:29,247 --> 00:31:32,956
and I kept rolling down the hill
and that was the end.

361
00:31:40,127 --> 00:31:43,487
German prisoners of war
were pressed into service

362
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:46,206
to carry Inouye back down the hill.

363
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:55,007
He was given morphine
at the aid station -

364
00:31:55,007 --> 00:31:57,167
so much morphine

365
00:31:57,167 --> 00:32:01,247
that when surgeons at the field hospital
began to amputate his shattered arm,

366
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:05,647
he had to endure it without anaesthetic.

367
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:08,887
"The pain was so intense,"
he remembered,

368
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:12,084
"that dying didn't seem like
such an awful idea."

369
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:21,367
I ended up receiving
17 whole blood transfusions.

370
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:26,327
Before they gave you the blood,
they showed you the bottle,

371
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:29,207
and on that bottle was a label

372
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:32,085
that had the name, rank,
serial number and the unit.

373
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:40,367
And so here is someone with some
fancy name, Thomas Jefferson Lee,

374
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:44,247
serial number, 92nd Division.

375
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:50,247
Now, 92nd Division was a unit that
we were attached to in the last battle,

376
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:55,727
and they're all made up
of African Americans.

377
00:32:55,727 --> 00:33:02,407
And all of the bottles I saw
were from the 92nd Division.

378
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:08,407
So I must have had 17 bottles
of good African American blood.

379
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:10,079
And so here I am.

380
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:14,287
For his heroism under fire,

381
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:18,887
Daniel Inouye would receive
the Medal of Honor.

382
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:22,367
It was granted to him 55 years later,

383
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:26,963
during his sixth term as
a United States senator from Hawaii.

384
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:37,967
Meanwhile, events in Europe
were moving so fast

385
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:41,647
it was hard for the people back home
to keep track.

386
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:43,887
NEWSREEL: On the final lap
of their drive on Berlin,

387
00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:46,082
Russian troops
send the Germans reeling.

388
00:33:55,927 --> 00:34:02,799
On April 25, American and Soviet forces
linked up at Torgau on the Elbe river.

389
00:34:07,007 --> 00:34:08,998
Germany had been cut in half.

390
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:21,562
The next day, Soviet troops
began assaulting Berlin itself.

391
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:57,807
On the morning of April 30,

392
00:34:57,807 --> 00:35:01,007
Russian troops fought their way
into the Reichstag,

393
00:35:01,007 --> 00:35:04,044
the symbol of German power.

394
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:20,807
Less than half a mile away,
beneath the rubble,

395
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:25,483
Adolf Hitler and his closest aides
huddled in their bunker.

396
00:35:27,447 --> 00:35:34,007
That afternoon, Hitler named
Admiral Karl Dönitz to succeed him,

397
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,726
then shot himself in the mouth.

398
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:46,281
Only his most fanatical followers
now continued to fight on.

399
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,047
FUSSELL: Eisenhower,
on D-day morning,

400
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:21,407
distributed to the troops a general order,
which is like a handbill,

401
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:22,887
and everybody read it

402
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:27,927
and he said, "We are about to
embark upon the great crusade,

403
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:32,127
"which we've been preparing for
for many months, etc."

404
00:36:32,127 --> 00:36:35,607
Now, at first, none of us could believe
it was anything like a crusade

405
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:39,607
because we were playing dice and
we were thinking about girls all the time

406
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:41,647
and getting as drunk as possible
and so forth.

407
00:36:41,647 --> 00:36:45,799
It wasn't like a crusade. There was
no religious dimension to it whatever.

408
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:53,447
When they finally got across
France and into Germany

409
00:36:53,447 --> 00:36:55,802
and saw the German death camps...

410
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:07,959
...they realised... that they had...

411
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:12,247
...been engaged
in something like a crusade,

412
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:15,398
although none of them called it that.

413
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:23,807
And it all began to make
a kind of sense to us.

414
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:27,607
I'm not sure that made it any better -
it may have made it worse -

415
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:31,887
to see that it was actually conducted

416
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:35,482
in defence of some noble idea.

417
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:45,487
As the Red Army had moved through
eastern Europe the previous summer,

418
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:49,247
it had uncovered, at Majdanek in Poland,

419
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:53,207
the first evidence
of the Nazis' industrialised barbarism.

420
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:58,884
The ashes of thousands of human
beings were found in a crematorium.

421
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:06,727
The American and British press
played it down,

422
00:38:06,727 --> 00:38:09,685
assuming the Soviets
were exaggerating.

423
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:16,600
Not even the Nazis
could be so murderous.

424
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:28,527
By the end of April 1945,

425
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:32,076
more than 100 camps and subcamps
would be liberated.

426
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:49,807
Auschwitz, Treblinka, Ravensbrück,

427
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:53,447
Ohrdruf, Buchenwald,

428
00:38:53,447 --> 00:38:58,601
Bergen-Belsen, Nordhausen, Dachau.

429
00:39:03,447 --> 00:39:08,607
On May 5, advance patrols
of the American 11th Armoured Division

430
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:11,927
came upon Mauthausen, in Austria.

431
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:14,127
There they found

432
00:39:14,127 --> 00:39:19,607
more than 110,000 desperate
so-called "enemies of the Reich" -

433
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:25,443
men, women and children
confined behind barbed wire.

434
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:32,047
Many were too weak to stand.

435
00:39:32,047 --> 00:39:38,047
Private Burnett Miller, of Sacramento,
was there and saw it all.

436
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:41,247
And they had put some signs out -

437
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:44,847
"Welcome, Americans.
You've saved us," and things like this.

438
00:39:44,847 --> 00:39:46,527
And we surrounded the camp

439
00:39:46,527 --> 00:39:51,847
and then there was a surge of people
who were in fairly good condition

440
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,087
begging for food.

441
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:58,727
And we were giving them
what food we had, concentrated food,

442
00:39:58,727 --> 00:40:04,047
and in some cases it overwhelmed
their systems and actually killed them.

443
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:07,647
I'm sure we were responsible
for the deaths of several hundred people

444
00:40:07,647 --> 00:40:11,162
just by feeding them concentrated food.

445
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:17,807
We went down in the basement
and there were these big furnaces,

446
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:22,807
and it looked like cordwood piled around,
and they were bodies in rigor mortis

447
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:28,564
that they had been preparing to burn
in these big furnaces.

448
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:33,607
And the fellows that went
into the other barracks

449
00:40:33,607 --> 00:40:36,047
came away just shocked,
some of them very, very sick.

450
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:39,287
The hospital there, people dying,
just thick,

451
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:42,127
and people couldn't get
out of their bunks

452
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:44,607
and people in terrible condition.

453
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:50,284
And then later there was a big trench,
and it was filled with bodies.

454
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:06,127
Some were dying,
some were trying to steal food.

455
00:41:06,127 --> 00:41:10,567
And the guards were dispersed all over,

456
00:41:10,567 --> 00:41:15,807
and we actually saw a guard move
into a house, and we chased him in,

457
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,887
and he was an officer.

458
00:41:18,887 --> 00:41:23,567
And the prisoners who were there
tore him apart,

459
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:26,240
just killed him right there.

460
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:36,447
We lived in Mauthausen, which was
an idyllic little Austrian town on the river,

461
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:38,927
but you could smell the camp in town.

462
00:41:38,927 --> 00:41:43,127
And all the villagers of course said they
didn't know anything about the camp,

463
00:41:43,127 --> 00:41:46,207
and the local priest said
he didn't know anything about the camp,

464
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:49,407
and I knew that was a lie
because you could smell the camp.

465
00:41:49,407 --> 00:41:54,959
You could just smell death.

466
00:42:01,807 --> 00:42:05,007
So it was a horrible, horrible experience.

467
00:42:05,007 --> 00:42:09,047
And then we came...
at least I came to think,

468
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:13,167
"Well, you know,
this effort has been worthwhile.

469
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,447
"There was a real reason to do this.

470
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:21,397
"These were inhuman things
that were being done to people."

471
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:32,007
Other Americans were witnessing
similar horrors at other camps.

472
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:36,727
Ray Leopold, a medic from Waterbury,
and a Jew,

473
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:39,116
was with the 28th Infantry Division.

474
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:44,887
We were...

475
00:42:44,887 --> 00:42:50,647
...near the Hadamar...

476
00:42:50,647 --> 00:42:52,767
...concentration camp.

477
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:58,167
At the same time, we noticed that
up on the hill there was a building

478
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:03,007
that the burgomaster described
as an insane asylum.

479
00:43:03,007 --> 00:43:06,327
We went up there and found that, true,

480
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:11,167
they did have an insane asylum there,
at least initially,

481
00:43:11,167 --> 00:43:14,967
but it was a place where there was

482
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:19,119
medical experimentation going
on humans.

483
00:43:25,527 --> 00:43:28,166
I really can't tell you what I saw there.

484
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:46,087
It affected me profoundly,

485
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:51,447
and I think all the men
who were with me at that time

486
00:43:51,447 --> 00:43:54,127
were equally affected.

487
00:43:54,127 --> 00:43:59,607
I, um... I felt that it was too bad

488
00:43:59,607 --> 00:44:06,887
that I was forbidden
by the Geneva Convention to kill.

489
00:44:06,887 --> 00:44:12,567
I... I felt that this was

490
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:16,047
the most horrible human experience

491
00:44:16,047 --> 00:44:22,077
that had ever been visited
on the face of the earth.

492
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:39,087
I saw one of those terrible places
where they were...

493
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:42,807
...where they had the people
that were dying and dead

494
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:46,287
and bodies stacked like cordwood.

495
00:44:46,287 --> 00:44:49,518
That was the little town of Ludwigslust.

496
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:58,047
And we made the German people
in that community go get those bodies,

497
00:44:58,047 --> 00:45:03,287
and had a burial in the park
in front of the castle

498
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:06,207
so that they would never forget it again.

499
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:11,122
And we gave them a Christian
and Jewish burial.

500
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:17,676
But the people did it.
We made the German people do it.

501
00:45:36,407 --> 00:45:41,407
These people in this country
who say it didn't happen - it happened.

502
00:45:41,407 --> 00:45:43,079
I saw it. I know.

503
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,597
It happened.

504
00:45:51,687 --> 00:45:57,367
In 1933, there were 9 million Jews
in Europe.

505
00:45:57,367 --> 00:46:02,043
By 1945, two out of three of them
were dead.

506
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:21,680
Thousands of Jewish communities
were wiped from the face of the earth.

507
00:46:25,687 --> 00:46:31,487
Hitler's regime also slaughtered
nearly 2 million non-Jewish Poles.

508
00:46:31,487 --> 00:46:35,407
They murdered more than 4 million
Soviet prisoners of war,

509
00:46:35,407 --> 00:46:37,167
as well as hundreds of thousands

510
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:40,487
of handicapped people
and political opponents,

511
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:42,367
homosexuals and Gypsies

512
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:45,567
and Jehovah's Witnesses
and slave labourers

513
00:46:45,567 --> 00:46:49,116
from all the countries they'd conquered.

514
00:47:14,807 --> 00:47:18,167
LEOPOLD: How bad it was,

515
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:20,207
how wide it was,

516
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:23,607
we never really knew how fully extensive

517
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:27,487
this horror that Hitler had visited
on Europe,

518
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,687
and in particular on the Jews,

519
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:32,527
how it was.

520
00:47:32,527 --> 00:47:37,527
But here we began to see.

521
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:41,007
We had no idea

522
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:47,116
that there was going to be
6 million dead Jews as a result.

523
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:58,207
I think the horror is still with me.

524
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:04,007
I think there's no apology

525
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:06,840
that can ever atone for what I saw.

526
00:48:22,047 --> 00:48:26,487
On May 8, three days after Burnett
Miller's unit reached Mauthausen,

527
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:29,285
Germany finally surrendered.

528
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:36,206
The war in Europe had come to an end.

529
00:48:38,327 --> 00:48:42,087
The Reich that Hitler had promised
would endure for a thousand years

530
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:45,762
had lasted less than a dozen.

531
00:49:07,247 --> 00:49:10,127
HARRY TRUMAN:
General Eisenhower informs me

532
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:13,881
that the flags of freedom
fly all over Europe.

533
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:19,361
This is a solemn but glorious hour.

534
00:49:21,607 --> 00:49:26,727
I wish that Franklin D. Roosevelt
had lived to see this day.

535
00:50:04,687 --> 00:50:08,447
MAN: Al Mclntosh,
'Rock County Star-Herald'.

536
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:12,007
"Unlike New Yorkers,
who whooped, hollered,

537
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:14,807
"and tore up tons of paper
to throw in the streets,

538
00:50:14,807 --> 00:50:19,407
"the news here was greeted
with quiet dignity and reverent restraint.

539
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:25,327
"One by one, the flags blossomed
out on Main Street,

540
00:50:25,327 --> 00:50:29,567
"and store by store
the employees quietly filed out

541
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:33,727
"and the business places
were locked up for the day.

542
00:50:33,727 --> 00:50:39,887
"But there was no shouting,
no hilarious display of any kind.

543
00:50:39,887 --> 00:50:42,924
"Most everybody went home.

544
00:50:44,527 --> 00:50:50,207
"There was quiet exultation over the fact
that a great victory had been achieved,

545
00:50:50,207 --> 00:50:54,607
"but that rejoicing was tempered
by the sobering knowledge

546
00:50:54,607 --> 00:50:58,486
"that there was another great war
yet to be won."
