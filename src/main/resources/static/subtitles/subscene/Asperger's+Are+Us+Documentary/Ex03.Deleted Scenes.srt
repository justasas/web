They were enacting a little scene
from the war.

00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:11,727
One of them had been wounded,
apparently.

3
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:13,207
And they had a medic

4
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:16,167
who was wearing a tabard
with a big red cross on it,

5
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:18,847
and he was crawling towards them.

6
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:21,167
Especially towards the man
who'd been wounded.

7
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:25,967
And in his left hand
he held a roll of bandages.

8
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:28,807
In his right hand he had
a pair of surgical scissors.

9
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:31,887
He was gonna crawl forward somehow
and help this guy,

10
00:00:31,887 --> 00:00:34,640
and at that point this shell
must have gone off above them.

11
00:00:35,887 --> 00:00:39,562
So, it was like a waxwork -
utterly incredible.

12
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:43,567
And I stood there for a second
wondering,

13
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:46,327
"What am I supposed to make of this?

14
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:49,046
"What's the symbolic meaning
of this little grouping?"

15

I can remember in the service

The fact is that reporters...

37

heroes for the American public.

38

being unfriendly or not patriotic.

Many war correspondents

55
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:58,167
were little more than cheerleaders,

56

anybody was really in self-defence...

90
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,283
...when I saw a German
leading a patrol, coming towards me.

91
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:17,367
I mistook him, because of
the way he was dressed,

92
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,847
for one of my own men.

93
00:07:18,847 --> 00:07:21,487
So I waved to him
to indicate, "I'm here.

94
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:23,927
"Come on, you can come to me.
It's safe here."

95
00:07:23,927 --> 00:07:26,007
All of a sudden I saw him...

96
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:29,287
He looked at one of his fellows.

97
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,287
He took his rifle off his shoulder.

98
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:35,087
He was wearing it
strapped to his shoulder.

99
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:39,127
And as he raised it, I raised mine
and I hit him first.

100
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:42,287
And he was terrified
and died on the spot.

101
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:45,487
And the rest of his patrol fled,
and we captured them later on.

But that was the first time
I ever killed anybody.

00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:13,398
"that the war might end before
I could get overseas into combat,

00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:16,071
"I enlisted in the Marine Corps
at Marion, Alabama.

175
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,318
"The recruiting sergeant
asked me lots of questions

176
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:22,438
"and filled out
numerous official papers.

177
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:25,438
"When he asked,
'Any scars, birthmarks

178
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,038
"'or other unusual features? '

179
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:30,358
"I described an inch-long scar
on my knee.

180
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:32,638
"I asked, 'Why such a question? '

"He replied, 'So they can identify
you on some Pacific beach

183
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:41,957
Eugene Sledge.

MAN: "I am for the immediate removal
of every Japanese on the west coast

"to a point deep in the interior.

00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:07,598
"Let him be pinched, hurt,

188
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:18,394
"Personally, I hate the Japanese,

189
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:22,630
Henry McLemore, 'Sacramento Union'.

190
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:27,718
(Ken Burns narrates) Order 9066

191
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:31,870
was the result of decades of
ugly west coast history.

192
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,078
State law and community custom
had barred Japanese immigrants

193
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:48,518
from marrying whites,
from eating in white restaurants

194
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:51,112
or living in white neighbourhoods.

195
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:55,798
Federal law had prohibited
Japanese immigrants

196
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:58,358
from ever becoming citizens

197
00:14:58,358 --> 00:15:03,876
and, in 1924, cut off immigration
from Japan altogether.

198
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:10,318
Only the American-born descendants
of Japanese immigrants,

199
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:13,238
called Nisei, were citizens.

200
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:15,438
And some now owned the land

201
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:18,350
their families had farmed
so successfully for years.

202
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:22,270
A fact many whites bitterly resented.

203
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:26,198
MAN: "We're charged with
wanting to get rid of the Japs

204
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:27,878
"for selfish reasons.

00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:30,711
"We might as well be honest - we do.

206
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:34,238
"It's a question of whether
the white man lives

"on the Pacific coast,

208
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:41,787
"They came into this valley to work

"If all the Japs
were removed tomorrow,

210
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,278
"we'd never miss them in two weeks,

211
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,518
"because the white farmers
can take over

212
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:51,395
"and produce everything

00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:55,112
"And we don't want 'em back
when the war ends either."

214
00:15:56,478 --> 00:15:59,868
Frank J. Taylor,
California Vegetable Growers.

215
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:13,989
I was in the dead centre
of the country, east and west,

216
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:17,149
among people who had
left Europe to get away from it -

217
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,629
Germans, Scandinavians, Irish.

218
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:24,949
They didn't really want to
know about Europe, I think.

219
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:30,029
I don't remember concern about
what is going to happen to Europe.

220
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:33,549
They call Europe the 'old country' -
all of Europe. (Chuckles)

221
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:35,229
They didn't want it.

222
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:40,069
They also felt that
nobody was threatening them -

223
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:41,549
and they were right.

224
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:46,469
Hitler wasn't going to invade
Minnesota. That was fairly sure.

225
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:49,589
So that as long as Japan
was being aggressive

226
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:51,549
on the far side of the Pacific

227
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:56,109
and Hitler was being aggressive
on the far side of the Atlantic,

228
00:16:56,109 --> 00:16:58,259
there wasn't really
anything to worry about.

229
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:12,269
(Ken Burns narrates)
In the weeks after D-day,

230
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,269
American pilots,
including Quentin Aanenson,

231
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:18,949
continued to fly their missions
over the fields and hedgerows

232
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:20,749
of Normandy every day,

233
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:24,901
trying to focus on the help they
were giving to the men on the ground.

234
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:30,666
And to avoid thinking too hard about
the losses in their own ranks.

235
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:38,069
Below them, the Americans
were still inching towards St-Lô

236
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:41,584
and the flat, open country
that lay just beyond it.

237
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:48,749
Sergeant Curtis Cullen Junior,
an inventive former Chicago cabbie,

238
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:52,669
had shown that sharp prongs fashioned
from Rommel's beach obstacles

239
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,149
fitted onto Sherman tanks

240
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:57,664
could slice through
the matted roots of the hedgerows.

241
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:05,869
Allied armour could now cut and blast
its way from field to field.

242
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:10,340
Weary riflemen were no longer
expected to do it on their own.

243
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,898
NARRATOR: The operation
was called Cobra.

244
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:30,909
QUENTIN AANENSON:
The day that the Cobra attack,

245
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,743
which was July 25, 1944...

246
00:18:36,469 --> 00:18:38,909
...there were
3,000 American airplanes

247
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,509
that attacked the front along St-Lô.

248
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:45,949
And we were in the first group.

249
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:50,943
I was, I think, number 8
in the attack of 3,000.

250
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:59,589
NARRATOR: The correspondent
Ernie Pyle was down below,

251
00:18:59,589 --> 00:19:02,189
watching from
a battered French farmhouse

252
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:05,226
with officers from
the 4th Infantry Division.

253
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:11,749
MAN: "The first planes
of the mass onslaught

254
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:14,109
"came over a little before 10am.

255
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,543
"They were the fighters
and dive-bombers.

256
00:19:18,189 --> 00:19:21,629
"Our front lines were marked by
long strips of coloured cloth

257
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,109
"laid on the ground,

258
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:25,418
"and with coloured smoke
to guide our airmen.

259
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:29,949
"We stood in the barnyard
of a French farm

260
00:19:29,949 --> 00:19:33,259
"and watched them barrel
nearly straight down out of the sky.

261
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:37,067
"They were bombing about a half
a mile ahead of where we stood.

262
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:41,669
"And then a new sound
gradually droned into our ears -

263
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:44,749
"a sound deep, all-encompassing

264
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:46,789
"with no notes in it,

265
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:50,464
"just a gigantic, faraway surge
of doom-like sound.

266
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:55,709
"It was the heavies, coming on
with a terrible slowness

267
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:58,869
"in flights of 12,
3 flights to a group.

268
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:01,429
"And in groups stretched out
across the sky.

269
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:04,788
"I thought it would never end.

270
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:13,744
"And then the bombs came.

271
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:19,348
"They began up ahead
as the crackle of popcorn...

272
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:25,509
"...and almost instantly swelled into
a monstrous fury of noise

273
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:29,468
"that seemed surely to destroy
all the world around us."

274
00:20:48,509 --> 00:20:50,818
NARRATOR: The bombs continued
falling for 1.5 hours.

275
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:54,789
The bright day grew dark with smoke,
Pyle remembered,

276
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:59,817
and the steady roar seemed to fill
all the space for noise on earth.

277
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:04,220
Then the wind shifted.

278
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:08,546
The coloured smoke began to move
toward the American lines.

279
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,548
So did the bombs.

280
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:14,789
MAN: "We dived.
(EXPLOSION)

281
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:19,146
"Some got in a dugout, others
made for foxholes and ditches.

282
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:24,309
"The feeling of the blast
was sensational.

283
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:27,745
"The air struck you
in hundreds of continuing flutters.

284
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:31,589
"Your ears drummed and rang.

285
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:36,069
"You could feel quick little waves
of concussion on your chest

286
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:37,548
"and in your eyes."

287
00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:01,469
NARRATOR: American bombs killed
111 American infantrymen that day

288
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:03,778
and wounded nearly 500 more.

289
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:06,669
Their desperate fellow soldiers

290
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:10,628
struggled to free them from the earth
into which they'd been blasted.

291
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:14,709
An American lieutenant general,

292
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:17,389
who had come to France
to observe the bombing,

293
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:18,868
was hurled 60 feet.

294
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:22,389
When his body was found,

295
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:27,417
it could be identified only by
a fragment of collar with three stars.

296
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:40,228
It was the worst American
friendly fire incident of the war.

297
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:46,909
The bombing also blasted and burned
and mangled

298
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:49,029
thousands of German troops.

299
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:54,103
Some maddened men shot themselves
rather than endure any more of it.

300
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:58,545
Tanks were tossed into the air
and landed upside down.

301
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:03,869
"My front lines looked like
the face of the moon,"

302
00:23:03,869 --> 00:23:05,348
the German commander remembered.

303
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:09,421
"And at least 70% of my troops
were out of action...

304
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:14,184
"...dead, wounded, crazed or numb."

305
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:19,109
Two days later, on July 27,

306
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:24,309
the First Army poured through the
newly opened gap in the German lines,

307
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:28,666
out into the countryside,
beyond the hedgerows.

308
00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:34,229
That same day,

309
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:37,665
Quentin Aanenson found himself
back in the air over Normandy.

310
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:43,349
QUENTIN AANENSON: I was flying with
Lieutenant Paul Bade.

311
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:47,509
He was the element leader
and I was on his wing.

312
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,898
We were at about 1,000 feet
over the trees.

313
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:55,465
And suddenly I saw him
start into a dive, a gradual dive.

314
00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:00,789
And as he started to go down,
I was just close to him,

315
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:04,509
I literally pulled up
so our wings overlapped

316
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,509
and saw him desperately trying to
disconnect everything -

317
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:13,989
his oxygen hose, his radio hose,
his seatbelt, and bale out.

318
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:16,309
But he was already too low.

319
00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:19,749
But in that instant,
while I'm overlapping with him,

320
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:24,149
and he knows,
in his mind he knows he's dead,

321
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:27,669
he looked over at me and
glanced at me for just a minute

322
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:30,342
and then crashed into the tree.

323
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:36,618
I had pulled off just enough
so I wasn't caught in the explosion.

324
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:45,099
But in that instant,
he knew he was dead.

325
00:24:46,229 --> 00:24:49,669
And I remember so many times
thinking about that.

326
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:56,222
He was an only son. His mother lived
in, I believe, Richmond, Virginia.

327
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,269
And I remember thinking,

328
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:03,899
"She does not know
that her son was killed today."

329
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:11,069
My friends were being killed off

330
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:13,742
and I was sending letters home
to their parents.

331
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:19,789
The day they were killed,
we grieved for them

332
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:23,309
and we packed up their things.

333
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:25,829
And maybe at the officers' club
that night

334
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:28,749
we talked about the circumstances,

335
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:30,949
what the angle of the flak had been

336
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:35,704
so we could try to avoid
certain approaches on targets.

337
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:39,701
But then we never
talked about them again.

338
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:43,709
We never talked about them again.

339
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,223
It's just as if they did not exist.

340
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:58,829
(Ken Burns narrates) Sam Hynes
was based on Okinawa now,

341
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:02,629
close enough to the fighting
so that from the doorway of his tent

342
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:06,144
he could see the battleships offshore
shelling Shuri.

343
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:09,869
In one month,

344
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:14,029
he and his squadron mates flew
more than 1,000 combat missions,

345
00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:17,909
going after torpedo launchers,
gun emplacements, submarines,

346
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,429
and dropping both propaganda leaflets
behind enemy lines

347
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:24,501
and supplies to the Americans
fighting below.

348
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:30,309
And Hynes too lost friends -

349
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:33,909
shot from the sky,
victims of their own errors,

350
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:36,742
or simply lost
somewhere over the sea.

351
00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:40,624
But the enemy was rarely seen.

352
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:44,826
SAM HYNES: Souvenirs for pilots
were hard to come by.

353
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:52,229
The infantrymen could pick something
off a dead Japanese any time,

354
00:26:52,229 --> 00:26:55,619
but we didn't see them very often.

355
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:59,029
So that one night

356
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:05,184
when a person seemed to be
trying to enter our area...

357
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:10,829
...the guards fired on him
and killed him.

358
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:15,509
And then everyone went down to see
what was their first dead enemy,

359
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,989
if he was the enemy.

360
00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:21,109
He might well have been an Okinawan
who was simply driven mad by hunger

361
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:23,349
and was trying to get in
to get something to eat.

362
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:27,308
He wasn't armed, he wasn't in
uniform, but he was very dead.

363
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:33,269
The next morning,
the pilot I flew wing on, a captain,

364
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:36,709
I went round to talk to him
about something,

365
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:39,989
he reached in his pocket
and pulled out a handkerchief,

366
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:42,981
opened it up
and there was the man's ear.

367
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:46,862
And he said, "Got me a souvenir."

368
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:57,629
DANIEL INOUYE:
I had two silver dollars.

369
00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:00,589
And one was almost split in half,

370
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:06,061
because I had it in my pocket
and a bullet grazed on it...

371
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:08,908
...and it saved my life.

372
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:12,469
So that was naturally
a good luck charm.

373
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:19,109
And on this morning, April 21, 1945,

374
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:23,429
I had lost my jacket,
I lost these two coins.

375
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:29,509
And so I saw the platoon leader
of the next platoon, and I said,

376
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:32,189
"I think today's my day."

377
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:33,789
He said,
"What are you talking about?"

378
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:36,019
I said, "This is the day
I'm gonna get banged."

379
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:38,908
Sure enough.

380
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,898
MAN: "Luverne, Minnesota.
December 6, 1945.

381
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:01,189
"Remember when you went to
a different city

382
00:29:01,189 --> 00:29:03,749
"to meet some relative
you might never have met before...

383
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,789
"...and you both agreed to wear
a flower or something

384
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,064
"as a mark of identification
for recognition purposes?

385
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:13,909
"They may have to revive that custom

386
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:16,309
"for the benefit of
returning servicemen fathers

387
00:29:16,309 --> 00:29:18,869
"who haven't seen their youngsters
for a long time.

388
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:25,069
"Harry Brodin was returning
the other day from Minneapolis

389
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:27,269
"after his discharge
from the Seabees.

390
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,021
"His wife had gone up to meet him.

391
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:32,378
"Also returning was Jim Argetsinger.

392
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:37,509
"And down at the train to greet
their fathers were the little tots -

393
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,069
"Judy Brodin and Julie Argetsinger.

394
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:42,949
"When Harry Brodin
stepped off the train,

395
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,829
"in his excitement
he grabbed the wrong youngster

396
00:29:45,829 --> 00:29:49,669
"and smothered Julie Argetsinger
with kisses and hugs.

397
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:51,989
"But the mistake was soon noticed

398
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:55,106
"and Judy Brodin
got her quota of kisses."

399
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,902
Al Mclntosh,
'Rock County Star Herald'.

400
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:25,109
GIRL: "When we came to
the ship's dining room,

401
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:26,701
"we could hardly believe our eyes.

402
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:35,309
"Long tables with white tablecloths,
white plates, two spoons, two forks,

403
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:36,788
"and what chow!

404
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,939
"Ice-cream and red apples too."

405
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:43,108
Sascha Weinzheimer.

406
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:47,749
NARRATOR: 12-year-old
Sascha Weinzheimer,

407
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:50,349
her brother and sister,
mother and father

408
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,229
had nearly starved to death

409
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:55,904
during three years as prisoners
of the Japanese in Manila.

410
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:01,949
Now they were at sea,
sailing home aboard the USS 'Capps'.

411
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:05,309
And the sailors spared no effort
to make them

412
00:31:05,309 --> 00:31:08,301
and their fellow prisoners
comfortable after their ordeal.

413
00:31:15,229 --> 00:31:18,221
It took three weeks to reach
the California coast.

414
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:26,109
GIRL: "April 8, 1945.

415
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:30,022
"I was up on deck with Mother
when we passed the Farallon Islands.

416
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:35,063
"After a quick breakfast
we came up again.

417
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:38,909
"And there, straight ahead,

418
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:42,269
"we saw the sight we had been
thinking about, talking about

419
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:45,429
"and praying about for so long -

420
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:47,385
"the Golden Gate.

421
00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:52,462
"Now we knew we were really home."

422
00:32:00,509 --> 00:32:04,669
SASCHA WEINZHEIMER: We got to
San Francisco early in the morning.

423
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:06,148
It was foggy.

424
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:09,989
And we went up on deck
just as we were going under

425
00:32:09,989 --> 00:32:11,547
the Golden Gate Bridge.

426
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,309
It was about nine o'clock
in the morning,

427
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:31,509
but the gold tip of the bridge
was sticking out

428
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,500
with the sun breaking through.

429
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:39,149
And then we cruised slowly in
past Alcatraz,

430
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:44,269
and then docked just as the sun
was just coming over the hills.

431
00:32:48,989 --> 00:32:51,829
To me, that will always be a beacon.

432
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:55,349
That Golden Gate Bridge was
a wonderful salvation for us.

433
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:58,659
That's just like
the Statue of Liberty back east.

434
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:08,261
NARRATOR: The Weinzheimer family
checked into a downtown hotel.

435
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:12,749
"Look at this," her father said,
as he dialled room service.

436
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:15,468
"I never thought I'd be
dialling a phone again."

437
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,026
They dined on steaks and potatoes
and ice-cream.

438
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:26,309
Afterwards, Sascha's little brother,
Buddy,

439
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:30,780
spent three hours turning the water
on and off, on and off.

440
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:35,219
He'd never seen faucets before.
