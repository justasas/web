QUENTIN AANENSON: It was on
one of my very early missions

6
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:54,880
that I first knew I had...
I had killed men.

7
00:00:56,087 --> 00:01:00,247
We caught a group of Germans
that were on a road

8
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:02,127
in an area where
there were no trees,

9
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:03,887
and so there was no place
for them...

10
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:06,287
to... to run and hide.

11
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:10,807
And we caught them before they
could really get off the roads

12
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:12,847
and run toward the ditches.

13
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:15,919
(GUNFIRE)

14
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:20,567
And I remember
the impact it had on me

15
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:23,887
when I could see my bullets
just tearing into them,

16
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:27,127
and... and, uh,
we had so much firepower

17
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:30,567
that the...
the bodies would fly,

18
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:33,567
uh, some yards, and, uh,

19
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:37,927
as I... as I was doing this,

20
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:40,967
I was doing it knowing
I had to do it, that it was my job.

21
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,367
This is what
I'd been trained to do,

22
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:45,164
and I dealt with it fine.

23
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:51,927
But when I got back home
to the base in Normandy

24
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:54,087
and landed...

25
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:56,396
I got sick.

26
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:02,607
I had to think
about what I had done.

27
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:05,887
Now, that didn't change
my resolve for the next day.

28
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:08,367
I went out and did it again.

00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,925
And again and again and again.

31
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,327
The Allies were on the offensive now

32
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:40,921
in western Europe as well as the Pacific.

33
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:45,007

making them pay dearly

34
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:47,885
for every inch of territory
they tried to take.

36
00:02:55,527 --> 00:03:00,127
for whom flying had once seemed the
carefree symbol of freedom and escape,

37
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:04,245
would find himself confronting death
daily in the skies over France.

38
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:11,327
While Ray Pittman, of Mobile,

was the youngest
of four orphaned children.

51
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:30,167
His brothers, John and Joe, had
been in the navy at Pearl Harbor

52
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:33,682
when the Japanese attacked,
and had been spared.

53

James had signed on
the following year,

54
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:41,887
assigned to the light

in hopes of seeing action,

64

and he saw plenty of it
as a member of a gun crew.

Japanese planes

66

off Guadalcanal,

bombarded Japanese defences
at Munda,

68
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:53,687
and survived an enemy bomb
and two torpedo hits

off Bougainville.

70
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:04,847

75

could begin to attack
the Japanese homeland.

The fleet's three most important
targets in the Marianas

80
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:38,047
were Guam, Tinian, and Saipan,

than 30,000 Japanese troops.

was Corporal Alvy Ray Pittman
of Mobile, Alabama.

He'd been working as a carpenter
alongside his father

RAY PITTMAN:
I'd made up my mind

104
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:27,767
I want to get in
the toughest outfit they had.

105
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,167
And I was afraid the war
was going to get over

106
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,647
before I got over there.

107
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:33,567
So, I joined the Marine Corps.

108
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:37,887
Course, they sent me
to Parris Island for boot camp.

109
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,567
And I remember going in,

110
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:43,047
all these guys
standing out on the grass.

111
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:46,642

You'll be sorry."

00:08:57,847 --> 00:09:00,927
assigned to destroy enemy strong
points wherever they were found,

115
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,567
using explosives, grenades,

116
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,717
and flamethrowers.

117
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:17,647
PITTMAN: You never think about
getting hurt yourself.

118
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:20,807
You think about maybe some
of your buddies

119
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:23,447
are going to get hurt.

120
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:25,367
And you wonder
who it's going to be.

121
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:29,280
I mean, I, I really didn't ever
think about getting hurt myself.

122
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:32,847
Of course, when you, when you...

your amtrack going in,

124
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,286
you know it could happen.

00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:45,807
NARRATOR: The naval bombardment
had failed.

00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:50,047
Concentrated Japanese mortar
and artillery fire

127
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,407
rained down among the amtracks

128
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:56,366
and on the men fighting
for a toehold on the beach.

129
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:02,567
All four commanders
of the assault battalions

130
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,523
were hit within minutes.

131
00:10:09,647 --> 00:10:14,047
By evening, 20,000 marines
had made it ashore,

132
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,287
but they could go no further.

133
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:21,487
The Japanese planned to keep
the Americans pinned down

134
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,167
until their own fleet
could steam in

135
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,522
from the Philippines
and destroy them.

136
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:32,207
Despite the rain of shells,

137
00:10:32,207 --> 00:10:35,677
the marines began slowly to
fight their way off the beach.

138
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,484
PITTMAN: I know I was scared a lot...

139
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:58,524
...and losing a lot of friends
really hurts you.

140
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:05,567
It's, it's really hard
for me to describe,

141
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:09,807
really, just how
I felt the whole time

142
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:12,847
'cause there's something
happening every day

143
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:17,087
and you're so tired and you
can't lift your eyelids hardly.

144
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:18,847
And something happens,

145
00:11:18,847 --> 00:11:22,727
you get a call to blow a pillbox here,
blow a pillbox there.

146
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:27,807
I mean, you wake up
and go and do your job.

147
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:33,367
But it's hard for me to tell
just how bad it was -

148
00:11:33,367 --> 00:11:35,403
how I felt.

Normandy was quilted with small,

walled from one another
by hedgerows,

166

earthen ramparts four feet high,
topped with dense hedges

167

whose tangled roots turned them
into natural fortifications

00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,127
ideal for ambushes
and often concealed

175
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:32,960
from air attack
by overarching trees.

176
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:39,687
The Germans took
full advantage of all of it.

177
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:44,367
American Sherman tanks could not
break through the hedgerows,

178
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,527
and when they tried
to roll over them,

179

Each field became what the
newspaperman Ernie Pyle called

182
00:14:02,127 --> 00:14:05,207
"a separate little war",
fought mostly

183
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:07,596
by companies of riflemen.

184
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,643
DWAIN LUCE:
The Germans were good troops.

185
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:18,807
They did not
give up ground easily,

186
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:22,207
there or any other place
I saw them.

187
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,367
You had to respect them
for the fact

188
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:25,847
they were excellent troops.

189
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:28,127
(Chuckles) They were
too damn good, and...

190
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,687
or they wouldn't have
caused us so much trouble.

191
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:32,327
(EXPLOSION)

192
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:35,683
NARRATOR: Progress was measured
in yards.

193
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:42,247
Now the pace was far slower

194
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:45,447
than the Allied commanders
had anticipated,

195
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:50,202
and the cost in dead and wounded
was far higher.

196
00:14:56,447 --> 00:14:58,967
Unarmed C-47 s,

197
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:01,647
cargo planes stripped down

198
00:15:01,647 --> 00:15:04,367
so that as many litters as
possible could be lifted aboard,

...then turned around
and came back for more.

202
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:21,767
Emily Lewis was
one of hundreds of nurses

203
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:25,447
who did all they could
for the wounded.

204
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:30,567
LEWIS: All those wounded soldiers,
they were scared to death.

205
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:35,287
Really frightened
half out of their minds.

206
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:38,087
I hugged 'em, I was teary-eyed.

207
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,767
It makes me cry to think of it.

(GROANS)

209
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:45,567
Got 'em on my plane,
talked to them.

210
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,687
Some of them were...

211
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:50,927
so unnerved...

212
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:54,476
that I-I just had to put my arms
around them and hold 'em.

213
00:15:56,847 --> 00:16:00,287
I was 23,
and they were 22, 21,

214
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:03,047
24, 18, you know.

215
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:04,527
It was...

216
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:07,167
it was just... terrible.

217
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,477
But it had to be done, you know?

218
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,447
NARRATOR: By July 1,

219
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:17,047
hundreds of thousands of troops
were onshore.

220
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:18,927
The Cotentin Peninsula

221
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:21,927
and the port of Cherbourg
had been taken,

222
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:25,522
and the beachhead stretched
for some 70 miles.

223
00:16:27,607 --> 00:16:29,887
But after three weeks of combat,

224
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:34,327
it remained, at most,
20 miles deep.

225
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:38,036
The plan to liberate France
was stalled.

226
00:16:43,927 --> 00:16:45,407
General Bradley feared

227
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:47,447
that unless something drastic
were done,

228
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:50,727
the Allies would face the same
sort of ghastly stalemate

229
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:54,606
they had endured
during the First World War.

230
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:01,927
To avoid disaster, his men had
to get out of the hedgerows

231
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:04,527
and find the kind
of wide-open countryside

232
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:08,167
American armour needed
to make real progress.

233
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:11,727
The region just beyond
the town of St-Lô

234
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:13,558
was what Bradley had in mind.

235
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,441
It was just 15 miles away...

236
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:21,327
...but to his exhausted men,

237
00:17:21,327 --> 00:17:25,527
it seemed as distant
as their ultimate target -

238
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,518
Germany.

KATHARINE PHILLIPS: During the war,
you just kept thinking

250
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:43,167
that life cannot begin
until this is over.

251
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:48,287
You just had to see again
all the boys

and been fond of,

253

and know they were home safely.

254
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:57,047
Especially for me.
I was not married,

255
00:18:57,047 --> 00:19:01,727
so I was still anticipating
my life ahead of me,

256
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:05,327
but I didn't know who
it would be spent with.

257
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:07,367
But I felt, if I could just

258
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:10,567
get my brother Sidney
back home again...

259
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,247

00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:15,647
of my old boyfriends
two years ago,

261
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:18,447
and I said,
"Why didn't you propose to me?"

262
00:19:18,447 --> 00:19:21,847
He said, "You wouldn't
have listened to me.

NARRATOR: The Japanese fleet
was close by.

280
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:54,647
Vice-Admiral Jizaburo Ozawa
had formulated a new plan

281
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:57,407
to destroy both
the American land forces,

282
00:20:57,407 --> 00:21:00,207
still struggling their way
inland on Saipan,

283
00:21:00,207 --> 00:21:02,767
and the American fleet offshore.

284
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:07,167
He would send waves
of carrier-based warplanes

285
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:08,887
against the fleet,

286
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:11,720
then reinforce the Japanese

and knew they were coming.

292
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:38,158
Hundreds of planes took off
to engage the Japanese.

The Battle
of the Philippine Sea

294
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:50,567
would be the greatest carrier

295
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:53,365
nearly four times
as big as Midway.

296
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:59,525
It was clear the Americans
now had an edge.

297
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:03,567
Their pilots were better
trained than the enemy's.

298
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:07,247
Their planes were better, too.

299
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:10,523
And they had twice
as many of them.

00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:40,287
and joined the navy
rather than the army

because, he said,
he didn't want to sleep

304
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:46,247
in a hole in the ground,
was serving as a gunner

aboard the heavy cruiser
USS 'lndianapolis',

MAURICE BELL: I was sitting up there
with the binoculars

308
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,567
and, all of a sudden,
I saw a torpedo plane

309
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:04,923
diving in on the ship
right behind us.

310
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:10,127
And, just as he launched
his torpedoes,

311
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,647
or was ready to launch them,
they hit him with fire.

312
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:14,126
They was firing at him.

313
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:20,927

and crashed.

314
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:22,645
Five seconds behind him
was another one.

315
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,320
They hit him and he crashed.

316
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:34,727
About five more seconds,
there's a third one come in,

317
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:37,207
and they hit him,

318
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,087
and it throwed that plane

319
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:42,327
in a twist, and the torpedoes
fell end over end,

320
00:23:42,327 --> 00:23:44,158
and hit the water,
and the plane crashed.

321
00:23:49,807 --> 00:23:52,958
I was watching all that
with my binoculars.

00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:11,847
NARRATOR: The Americans lost
29 planes that day,

345
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:21,887
But you surround one Japanese,

346
00:26:21,887 --> 00:26:24,087
he's going to keep fighting
right on.

347
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:26,521
He's going to keep firing
until you kill him.

348
00:26:31,447 --> 00:26:36,237
And they had one thing
in mind - it's killing you.

349
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:48,807
NARRATOR: The Japanese troops
on Saipan, now without hope

350
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,327
of rescue or reinforcement
from their shattered fleet,

351
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:55,524
were resolved to die
rather than surrender.

352
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:02,887
American forces had cleared
the airfield

353
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:06,527
and begun a slow, agonising
march toward the north,

354
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:10,567
trying to keep from killing
Japanese civilians

355
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:14,082
while flushing Japanese troops
from their hiding places.

356
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:25,596
(GUNSHOT)

357
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:35,047
Again and again, Japanese
soldiers threw themselves

358
00:27:35,047 --> 00:27:39,047
at the American guns,
shouting "Banzai!"

359
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:42,926
Apparently willing, even eager,
to die for the Emperor.

360
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,047
PITTMAN: We'd hear the Japanese
talking and drinking

361
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:50,247
and clanking bottles
and everything.

362
00:27:50,247 --> 00:27:51,999
And we knew there
was one coming.

363
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:57,647
But they'd come at us
and, and, uh...

364
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:03,447
we had machine guns set up
doing crossfires every way.

365
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:05,207
They'd have to get through
the crossfire

366
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:07,007
before we started shooting,

367
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:09,407
but then some
of them would get through.

368
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:13,287
I had one that came at me
with a bayonet

369
00:28:13,287 --> 00:28:15,207
and I shot him in the face

370
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:17,767
and he fell
in the foxhole with me,

371
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:20,527
and bled all over my pants

372
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:24,805
and the bayonet went down
between my arm and my, my chest.

373
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,517
Nearly got me and him dead.

374
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,847
NARRATOR: Before dawn on July 7,

375
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:41,839
the Japanese launched
a final banzai charge.

376
00:28:43,447 --> 00:28:47,967
3,000 men, some forced
from their hospital beds

377
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:49,967
and barely able to walk,

378
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:53,247
many armed only with clubs
and rocks and shovels,

379
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:56,045
charged into the American lines.

380
00:28:58,087 --> 00:29:01,007
Bulldozers buried all
but a handful of them

381
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,918
the next morning.

382
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:12,360
It was the largest banzai
charge of the Pacific War.

383
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,927
SAM HYNES: We thought
of the Japanese

384
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:22,079
as... mysteriously unlike us.

385
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:27,727
We knew that they would
fight to the death

386
00:29:27,727 --> 00:29:31,927
where, probably, we would
have surrendered.

387
00:29:31,927 --> 00:29:38,087
We began to learn,
though I don't think we...

388
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:42,967
gathered a lot of information
about the prison camps,

389
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:46,327
but we had some and we knew
that they were capable of,

390
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:50,767
of a cruelty and,
and sadism in a way

391
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:54,047
that we hoped
our people weren't,

392
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:57,967
though I've never been quite
sure what Americans would do

393
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:00,242
in the...
exactly the same situation.

394
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:11,839
NARRATOR: On July 10,
Saipan was officially declared 'secured'.

395
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:16,087
In almost four weeks
of fighting,

396
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:21,127
16,525 Americans had been
killed, wounded

397
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,847
or reported missing,

398
00:30:23,847 --> 00:30:27,847
the costliest battle
in the Pacific to date.

399
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:31,767
Among them
were several black marines

400
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:35,847
who had finally
been permitted to fight.

401
00:30:35,847 --> 00:30:38,847
"The Negro marines are
no longer on trial,"

402
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:43,967
the marine commandant said,
"they are marines, period."

403
00:30:47,447 --> 00:30:52,362
Almost 30,000 Japanese soldiers
were dead, as well.

404
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:01,687
In the final days of the battle,

405
00:31:01,687 --> 00:31:05,047
some 4,000 terrified
Japanese civilians,

406
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:07,727
mostly women and children,
had fled

407
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:13,047
to the island's northern tip,
a high plateau called Marpi Point.

408
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:17,007
Their government had
convinced many of them

409
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:19,727
that it was their duty
to kill themselves

410
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:24,447
rather than fall into the hands
of the cruel Americans -

411
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:28,047
and the handful of Japanese
soldiers who had survived

412
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:32,040
were prepared to shoot them
if they hesitated.

413
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:38,927
Some marines risked their lives
to halt the madness,

414
00:31:38,927 --> 00:31:41,887
Japanese American interpreters
with bullhorns

415
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:45,207
pleaded with civilians
to give up.

416
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:49,927
But more than a thousand were
either killed by Japanese troops

417
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:51,997
or chose suicide.

418
00:31:55,847 --> 00:32:00,327
PITTMAN: When we got down
to the end of the island,

419
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:04,081
they were jumping off the cliff
at Marpi Point.

420
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:17,647
They thought we'd eat them.

421
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:19,767
They thought we'd kill them
and eat them.

422
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:21,527
Stuff like that.

423
00:32:21,527 --> 00:32:24,247
It's just the Japanese
mentality -

424
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:25,999
they don't want to get captured.

425
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:31,927
I never did go down to look
at the bottom of the cliff,

426
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:35,602
but it must have been
a mess down there.

427
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:45,607
NARRATOR: A few Japanese soldiers
decided to swim out to sea,

428
00:32:45,607 --> 00:32:47,916
rather than surrender.

429
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:52,207
PITTMAN: So we decided, well,
they're going to die anyway,

430
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:54,967
we might as well shoot them.

431
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:58,607
So we set up there
shooting at them.

432
00:32:58,607 --> 00:33:00,087
We'd hear the slugs
hitting around them

433
00:33:00,087 --> 00:33:01,607
and sometimes somebody
would hit one.

434
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:05,407
But it was a long shot,

435
00:33:05,407 --> 00:33:07,284
trying to hit their head.

436
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:22,047
MAN: "Sunday, July 16.

437
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:24,007
"It was a warm, sunny day

438
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:26,043
"although it rained
during church services.

439
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:30,167
"It was the first time
I ever went to church

440
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:33,367
"and saw dead bodies
floating by.

441
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:38,647
"It is nothing to see men,
women and children floating.

"There must be thousands of Japs

00:33:43,047 --> 00:33:45,561
"The ships just run over them."

444
00:33:55,607 --> 00:33:59,607
NARRATOR: The Americans went on
to take Tinian and then Guam,

445
00:33:59,607 --> 00:34:03,805
the first US possession
to be recaptured.

446
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:08,847
The fall of the Marianas

447
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,687
and the damage done
to the Japanese fleet

448
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:12,167
in the Philippine Sea

449
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:16,922
forced Hideki Tojo to resign
as the Japanese premier.

450
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,647
His successors -
first a general,

451
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:26,526
then an admiral,
vowed to fight on.

452
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:33,447
The Japanese had succeeded
at one thing -

453
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,927
the willingness of their
soldiers and civilians

454
00:34:35,927 --> 00:34:39,927
to die rather than surrender
had made Allied planners

455
00:34:39,927 --> 00:34:42,487
painfully conscious
of the bloodshed

456
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:44,207
that would surely accompany

457
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,801
the invasion
of the Japanese homeland.

BARBARA PERKINS:
During the war,

459
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,796
it was hard to keep track
of your loved ones.

460
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:28,199
Mail was very slow.

461
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:32,447
And even the news media,
if you knew

462
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:35,407
what-what company and troop
and all that was in,

463
00:35:35,407 --> 00:35:39,887
those things weren't published
in any detail at all

464
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,685
as to pinpoint
just where they were.

465
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:47,516
Well, you just never know.

466
00:35:48,927 --> 00:35:50,567
We lived with that.

AANENSON: We would be, uh,
sitting around our tent area

496
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,807
in the apple orchard
in Normandy

497
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:55,807
and we would discuss what
they would have to pay us

498
00:37:55,807 --> 00:37:59,436
to really do what we had
just done that day.

499
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:05,487
We agreed first
that we might do it

500
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:09,487
for $1,000 a mission,

501
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:12,487
but less than 10 days later -

502
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:15,167
our losses had
gone up heavily -

503
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,167
we decided that we
wouldn't consider doing it

504
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:21,167
for less than $10,000 a mission.

505
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:25,167
And I think that it went
off the radar screen in value

506
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:29,807
before the end of July,
because there's no way

507
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,167
that you can be
a mercenary enough,

508
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,687
they could pay you enough,

509
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:37,362

on a volunteer basis.

00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:54,167
trying to focus on the help
they were giving

516
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:56,167
to the men on the ground,

517
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,167
and to avoid thinking too hard

518
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:01,556
about the losses
in their own ranks.

519
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:06,767
NEWSREEL: Dashing to a hedgerow
to clear Nazis out

520
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:08,847
of another line of hedge
across a meadow.

521
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,839
(EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE)

522
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:18,247
The enemy position's blasted

523
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:21,367
and the Germans occupying
it have enough,

524
00:39:21,367 --> 00:39:24,007
so out comes the white flag
of surrender,

525
00:39:24,007 --> 00:39:25,487
more prisoners taken
in the drive

526
00:39:25,487 --> 00:39:27,407
to the important city of St-Lô.

527
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,767
As the infantry pushes forward,
the way is cleared

528
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:33,759
by the smashing power
of tanks and heavy artillery.

529
00:39:40,807 --> 00:39:43,167
NARRATOR: On July 18, St-Lô -

530
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:47,167
or what was left of it after
six weeks of Allied bombing -

531
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,920
fell to the Americans.

532
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:05,967
General Bradley's forces
had finally reached the line

533
00:40:05,967 --> 00:40:08,167
Allied planners had
expected his men to reach

534
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:10,078
just a few days after D-day,

535
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:15,807
And he was now ready
to send his armour

536
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:19,436
roaring through the German
lines beyond the city.

537
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:23,047
But first, Allied warplanes

538
00:40:23,047 --> 00:40:24,878
were called in
to blast an opening.

539
00:40:28,807 --> 00:40:31,241
The operation
was called Cobra.

540
00:40:38,887 --> 00:40:42,167
The correspondent
Ernie Pyle was down below,

541
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:43,887
watching from a battered
French farmhouse

542
00:40:43,887 --> 00:40:47,880
with officers from
the 4th Infantry Division.

543
00:40:52,687 --> 00:40:54,167
MAN: "The first planes

544
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:57,687
"of the mass onslaught came over
a little before 10:00am.

545
00:40:57,687 --> 00:41:00,201
"They were the fighters
and dive-bombers.

546
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:06,367
"We stood in the barnyard of
a French farm and watched them

547
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:09,165
"barrel nearly straight down
out of the sky.

548
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:15,487
"And then a new sound gradually
droned into our ears,

549
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:18,487
"a sound deep,
all-encompassing,

550
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:21,367
"with no notes in it,

551
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:25,326
"just a gigantic, faraway
surge of doom-like sound.

552
00:41:26,607 --> 00:41:28,167
"It was the heavies,

553
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,167
"coming on
with a terrible slowness

554
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:33,367
"in flights of 12,
three flights to a group

555
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:36,279
"and in groups stretched
out across the sky.

556
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:39,318
"I thought it would never end.

557
00:41:44,047 --> 00:41:45,526
"And then the bombs came.

558
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:52,687
"It began up ahead
as the crackle of popcorn

559
00:41:52,687 --> 00:41:57,767
"and almost instantly swelled
into a monstrous fury of noise

560
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:01,237
"that seemed surely to destroy
all the world around us."

561
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:23,167
NARRATOR: The bombs continued
falling for an hour and a half.

562
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:25,167
The bright day
grew dark with smoke,

563
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,807
Pyle remembered,
and the steady roar

564
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:31,516
seemed to fill "all the space
for noise on earth".

565
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:46,807
Two days later,
on July 27, the first army

566
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:49,807
poured through the newly opened
gap in the German lines,

567
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:53,561
out into the countryside
beyond the hedgerows.

568
00:42:57,807 --> 00:43:00,687
For weeks,
the Americans on the ground

569
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:04,607
had felt fortunate
to gain 1,000 yards a day.

570
00:43:04,607 --> 00:43:08,207
Soon they would be
covering up to 40 miles

571
00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:10,243
in the same amount of time.

572
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:17,046
The Germans were reeling.

573
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:20,767
On August 7, the Americans

574
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:23,407
stopped a counterattack
cold at Mortain,

575
00:43:23,407 --> 00:43:27,958
and after five days of battle,
forced the Germans to retreat.

576
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:33,487
Then, on August 15,
in the south of France,

577
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:36,367
American
and Free French Forces landed,

578
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:38,167
fanned out
in all directions

579
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:41,807
and began driving northward.

580
00:43:41,807 --> 00:43:44,807
The following day,
Hitler reluctantly agreed

581
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:47,167
to pull his battered
Seventh Army

582
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:48,807
out of Normandy.

583
00:43:48,807 --> 00:43:51,879
It began a desperate
retreat toward Germany.

584
00:43:53,807 --> 00:43:57,561
The Allies caught them
near the town of Falaise.

585
00:44:05,527 --> 00:44:07,007
For three days,

586
00:44:07,007 --> 00:44:09,760
the Allies poured fire
into the fleeing men...

587
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:16,245
...from the ground
and from the air.

588
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:21,443
80,000 Germans ran
the terrible gauntlet.

589
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:27,167
At least 10,000 died,

590
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:30,807
so many that the pilots
of the Allied spotter planes

591
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:32,687
hundreds of feet
above the battlefield

592
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:35,565
were nauseated by the stench.

593
00:45:38,807 --> 00:45:41,687
So many that after
the shooting had stopped,

594
00:45:41,687 --> 00:45:43,967
General Eisenhower
remembered,

595
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:45,807
"it was literally possible

596
00:45:45,807 --> 00:45:48,527
"to walk for hundreds
of yards at a time,

597
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:52,884
"stepping on nothing
but dead and decaying flesh".

598
00:46:06,927 --> 00:46:09,567
AANENSON: I had caught
a bunch of Germans

599
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:13,487
in... in double tandem trucks,

600
00:46:13,487 --> 00:46:17,036
and they were just
massed in there.

601
00:46:19,207 --> 00:46:23,567
There was so much, uh,
firing into that

602
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:25,407
and I was the only one
that was firing.

603
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:28,727
My wingman... his guns
had been jammed, and, uh...

604
00:46:28,727 --> 00:46:35,847
the effect on me was that
my right hand quit working

605
00:46:35,847 --> 00:46:38,767
and I was on the way home

606
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:42,527
and I couldn't
grip with that hand.

607
00:46:42,527 --> 00:46:49,047
So I had to put my left hand
over on top of the stick

608
00:46:49,047 --> 00:46:52,642
to maintain it and go
and land with that.

609
00:46:57,047 --> 00:46:59,207
When I'd have
these nightmares

610
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:02,887
in years after the war,
many years after the war,

611
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:05,567
if it was one relating
to that mission

612
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:07,087
or missions like that,

613
00:47:07,087 --> 00:47:09,887
when I'd get up in the morning,

614
00:47:09,887 --> 00:47:12,207
go out to the kitchen,
Jackie would be there

615
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:15,567
and she would have had
the coffee made,

616
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:18,207
and she could tell
when I walked in

617
00:47:18,207 --> 00:47:22,407
that my right hand
wasn't functioning right.

618
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:25,207
She'd pour a cup
of coffee, not say a word.

619
00:47:25,207 --> 00:47:27,567
She'd hand it
to my left hand.

620
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:29,767
Never a word said.

621
00:47:29,767 --> 00:47:31,644
We just went on.

622
00:47:59,927 --> 00:48:03,317
NARRATOR: All across France,
the Germans were in full retreat.

623
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:10,516
Since D-day,
they had lost some 240,000 men...

624
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:14,556
...another 200,000 had surrendered.

625
00:48:19,887 --> 00:48:21,923
Allied casualties
were terrible, too.

626
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:27,767
256,000 soldiers and airmen

627
00:48:27,767 --> 00:48:31,567
had been killed,
wounded, captured,

628
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:34,445
or reported
as missing in action.

629
00:48:39,287 --> 00:48:43,439
At least 19,000 French civilians
had died as well.

630
00:48:55,887 --> 00:48:59,402
Countless French villages
had been pounded into dust.

631
00:49:09,927 --> 00:49:12,885
But most of France was free.

632
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:40,727
On August 25, 1944,

633
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,957
after four years of Nazi occupation...

634
00:49:44,327 --> 00:49:48,878
...Paris, the City of Light,
was liberated.

635
00:49:55,247 --> 00:49:58,447
MAN: "I, Ollie Stewart, of sound mind

636
00:49:58,447 --> 00:50:03,367
"and fairly sober character,
do solemnly give my word

637
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:07,567
"that I have never been kissed
so much in all my life.

638
00:50:07,567 --> 00:50:11,087
"Almost every woman I meet
on the street stops

639
00:50:11,087 --> 00:50:15,127
"and kisses me on both cheeks.

640
00:50:15,127 --> 00:50:17,880
"It is a beautiful custom."

641
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:32,367
AANENSON: We were flying
a mission near Paris

642
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:36,127
and as I pulled off
my strafing run

643
00:50:36,127 --> 00:50:38,847
and I turned back over the city

644
00:50:38,847 --> 00:50:42,407
and as I looked down,
there were just thousands

645
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:45,967
of people jamming the streets
of the Champs Élysées

646
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:49,767
and around the Eiffel Tower
and the Arc de Triomphe

647
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:52,407
and I realised
that I was seeing something

648
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:55,607
that was basically
the culmination

649
00:50:55,607 --> 00:50:57,086
of why we were there.

650
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:03,327
We are winning this war.

651
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:06,000
The good guys are going
to come out ahead.
