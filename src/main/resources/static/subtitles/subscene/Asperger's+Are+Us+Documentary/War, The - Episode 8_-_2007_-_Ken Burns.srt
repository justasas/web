00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,754
         (bird singing)         

2
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:41,205
                              

3
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:57,622
           SAM HYNES:           
    The world contains evil.    

4
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,824
 And if it didn't contain evil, 

5
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:04,729
we probably wouldn't need to try
     to construct religions.    

6
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,399
    No evil, no God, I think.   

7
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,003
 No, of course no evil, no war. 

8
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,806
         But this is not        
       a human possibility      

9
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:16,307
   that we need to entertain.   

10
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,409
      There will always be      
         plenty of evil.        

11
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,912
  And there'll always be wars.  

12
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:29,020
      Because human beings      
     are aggressive animals.    

13
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:50,141
            NARRATOR:           
         When the people        
     of Luverne, Minnesota,     

14
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,911
   and Sacramento, California;  
     Waterbury, Connecticut,    

15
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:59,751
    and Mobile, Alabama, went   
 to the movies in March of 1945,

16
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,386
       they saw and heard       
        a sick and weary        

17
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:07,258
 President Franklin Roosevelt-- 
      so sick and so weary      

18
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,627
     that for the first time    
         in his career,         

19
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,330
      he referred directly      
        to the paralysis        

20
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,300
   that kept him from standing  
         without braces.        

21
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:21,372
           ROOSEVELT:           
 I hope that you will pardon me 
     for an unusual posture     

22
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,776
     during the presentation    
     of what I want to say,     

23
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,811
but I know that you will realize

24
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,381
        that it makes it        
       a lot easier for me      

25
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:34,852
about ten pounds of steel around
    on the bottom of my legs;   

26
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,421
  and also because of the fact  

27
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:42,092
   that I have just completed   
       a 14,000-mile trip.      

28
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:46,431
            NARRATOR:           
Roosevelt's strength was waning,
         but his message        

29
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,867
          was undimmed.         

30
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,869
  The war was still to be won.  

31
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:56,507
     It's a long, tough road    
            to Tokyo.           

32
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:01,412
   It is longer to go to Tokyo  
      than it is to Berlin,     

33
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,282
   in every sense of the word.  

34
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,450
   The defeat of Germany will   
        not mean the end        

35
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,586
    of the war against Japan.   

36
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,855
        On the contrary,        
       we must be prepared      

37
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:15,459
 for a long and costly struggle 
         in the Pacific.        

38
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:24,669
            NARRATOR:           
   Americans had been fighting  
 for more than three years now, 

39
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,838
     and the number of dead     
     and wounded and missing    

40
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,742
      had more than doubled     
        just since D-Day.       

41
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:40,485
 The Nazis seemed at last to be 
    on the verge of collapse,   

42
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,321
   but American men were still  
      dying in the struggle     

43
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:47,091
       to eradicate them,       
   and Allied planners feared   

44
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:52,763
   the final battle with Japan  
   would stretch on for years.  

45
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:03,608
      In the coming weeks,      
       two men from Mobile      

46
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,445
 would fight simply to survive: 

47
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,413
 Eugene Sledge, who had endured 

48
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,549
    the horrors of the battle   
          for Peleliu,          

49
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,818
        would once again        
       be forced to enter       

50
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,588
   what he called "the abyss."  

51
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:22,259
 Maurice Bell, who had witnessed
     much of the Pacific war    

52
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,329
  aboard the USS<i> Indianapolis,</i>  

53
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:29,500
    would find himself hurled   
   into the center of history.  

54
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:35,606
   Daniel Inouye from Honolulu  
 would lead his men in an attack

55
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,608
   so furious that afterwards   

56
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,413
  even he could no longer quite 
         comprehend it.         

57
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:46,317
       And Glenn Frazier,       
   from Fort Deposit, Alabama,  

58
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,055
  who had survived three and a  
 half years of brutal captivity,

59
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:56,861
  would find that the Japanese  
    were not his only enemy.    

60
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:10,307
  The people of Sacramento and  
 Luverne, Waterbury and Mobile, 

61
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,610
  and every other American town 

62
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,547
  knew that there would be more 
  bad news from the battlefield 

63
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:20,485
   before they could dare hope  
  to know what it would be like 

64
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:27,658
  to live once again in a world 
          without war.          

65
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:33,031
         (tool clacking)        

66
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:37,234
       EMMA BELLE PETCHER:      
  I remember going to New York  
          on the train.         

67
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,804
       And at the station       
     at St. Louis, Missouri,    

68
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:44,742
        the platform was        
       lined with caskets.      

69
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,978
      With American flags.      

70
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,246
       It was just as far       
      as you could see them     

71
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,949
         on the platform        
      at the train station.     

72
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:55,286
     And I went down reading    
    the name in brass plaque    

73
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,055
     that was all the names.    

74
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,256
     And I cried and cried.     

75
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,292
     How could you not cry?     

76
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:30,455
                              

77
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:38,162
             HYNES:             
 The Pacific, as one experienced
     it, began at San Diego.    

78
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:45,235
  And you got a sense of what a 
 huge space you were going into.

79
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:48,572
  That this was not going to be 
          like Europe,          

80
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,844
 where there was land all around
        and it had names.       

81
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:56,914
 This was going to be nameless, 
          empty space.          

82
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:02,387
  Almost all of it with little  
    dots of land in between.    

83
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:13,030
            NARRATOR:           
 In March of 1945, Marine pilot 
   Sam Hynes was 20 years old,  

84
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:16,267
       a former University      
      of Minnesota student      

85
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,703
       who, like thousands      
       of other young men,      

86
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:21,505
  had been made to grow up fast 
         during the war,        

87
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:26,711
     passing test after test    
     on the way to manhood.     

88
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:31,348
         He had learned         
to live on his own, had married,

89
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,552
   mastered the dangerous art   
    of flying torpedo bombers   

90
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:37,255
 and had now received his orders

91
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:40,691
     to proceed 6,000 miles     
       across the Pacific       

92
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:45,596
to face his final trial: combat.

93
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:53,838
     Hynes landed at Ulithi,    
    the sprawling coral atoll   

94
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,907
    the U.S. Navy had turned    
  into the advance staging area 

95
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,476
         for the assault        
     that was about to begin    

96
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:03,280
     on the Japanese island     
           of Okinawa.          

97
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:09,119
             HYNES:             
         It was awesome.        

98
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,588
          It was huge.          

99
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,825
 The anchorage was miles across,

100
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,594
  and it was covered with ships 

101
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,731
    of all sizes-- carriers,    
          battleships,          

102
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,867
      destroyers, cruisers.     

103
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,603
  I'd never seen so many ships. 

104
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,239
       It was like seeing       
  all the power in your corner. 

105
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:32,643
           (laughing):          
   And there wasn't any power   
      in the other corner.      

106
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:37,215
            NARRATOR:           
     Okinawa, 60 miles long     

107
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,485
       and home to almost       
    half a million civilians,   

108
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:43,521
    was the gateway to Japan.   

109
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,991
The Allies knew they had to take
  it before they could move on  

110
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,527
      to the home islands,      
       and were gathering       

111
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,531
the largest invasion force since
   D-Day-- almost 1,500 ships   

112
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,568
          and more than         
       half a million men.      

113
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,337
       (fierce explosion)       

114
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:20,691
Day after day, in March of 1945,

115
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,526
  American and British warships 

116
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,596
    fired shells and rockets    
           at Okinawa.          

117
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:41,078
    There was little evidence   
   of the island's defenders.   

118
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,250
  Allied planners were not sure 
  just where they were dug in.  

119
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,323
     But they knew they were    
    somewhere on the island--   

120
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:56,927
   more than 100,000 of them,   
         well entrenched        

121
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,498
       and prepared to die      
       for their Emperor.       

122
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:07,872
      The Japanese kamikaze     
         pilots overhead        

123
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:11,275
       were willing to die      
          for him, too.         

124
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:17,382
        There were nearly       
     100 Japanese airfields     

125
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,550
     within flying distance     
          of Okinawa--          

126
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:23,954
  and the pilots of some 5,000  
    warplanes were preparing    

127
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,892
  to sacrifice their own lives  
     in order to take those     

128
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:31,929
   of as many American sailors  
          as possible.          

129
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:40,604
          MAURICE BELL:         
  They was trained to fly their 
  planes one way and no return. 

130
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:45,877
     And when they went out     
   after a ship or something,   

131
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:50,715
  they had their funeral before 
       they actually left.      

132
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:54,585
     And they knew they was     
       never coming back.       

133
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:59,123
  They was under the impression 
  that if they gave their life  

134
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,025
   that way for their country,  

135
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:06,898
   they had a special place in  
 heaven for them, automatically.

136
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,200
       Which wasn't true.

            NARRATOR:           
 Seaman First Class Maurice Bell
       of Mobile, Alabama,      

138
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,140
     was serving as a gunner    

139
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:22,079
    aboard the heavy cruiser    
  USS<i> Indianapolis</i> off Okinawa. 

140
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:31,555
 On March 31, kamikazes targeted
      her for destruction.      

141
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:35,526
        (alarm sounding)        
              BELL:             
    I looked up to my right,    

142
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,597
and there was one small cloud up
 there and just as I looked up, 

143
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,799
          I saw a plane         
     come out of this cloud     

144
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:46,937
      and it was a Japanese     
         kamikaze plane.        

145
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,806
        The very instant        
       I saw him up there,      

146
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:53,043
 he must have spotted our ship, 
 because he turned into a dive, 

147
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,045
    instantly, and was coming   
         straight down.         

148
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,249
  It looked like he was coming  
        just as straight        

149
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,417
        to the very spot        
      where I was sitting.      

150
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:06,323
 A man back there started firing
  at it with a 20-millimeters,  

151
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,794
        and you could see       
       the tracers hit it.      

152
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:13,463
 The plane actually bounced off 
            the ship,           

153
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:16,934
   but the motor and the bomb   
     went through the deck.     

154
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,270
          Went through          
     number three mess hall     

155
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:24,175
    and right down there was    
    three or four or five men   

156
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,609
   sitting at a table eating.   

157
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,913
     It killed all of them.     

158
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,181
    The bomb went all the way   
        through the ship        

159
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,852
   into the water and exploded  
        back up through.        

160
00:12:41,326 --> 00:12:43,794
       They said that hole      
       all the way through      

161
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:48,966
    was large enough to drive   
      a 18-wheeler through.

        29 were wounded.        

164
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:11,389
  The<i> Indianapolis</i> was sent to  
 Ulithi to have its hull mended 

165
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,825
    and eventually dispatched   
 all the way across the Pacific 

166
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:21,332
    to Mare Island, near San    
 Francisco, for further repairs.

167
00:13:24,102 --> 00:13:29,707
   Meanwhile, the bombardment   
      of Okinawa continued.     

168
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:40,952
    The invasion was to begin   
           on April 1.          

169
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:47,758
This was the night before Easter
   Sunday, the first of April.  

170
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,998
   And Tokyo Rose, who was the  
 spokesperson for the Japanese, 

171
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,402
           TOKYO ROSE:          
 Japanese special attack planes 
 launched late Thursday night...

        through Normandy,       

173
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:02,773
      and they didn't know      
         we were coming,        

174
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,710
      and here we are going     
          into Okinawa,         

175
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,612
  and Tokyo Rose is telling us  

176
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,448
        "Okay, G.I. Joes,       
     we know you're coming,     

177
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:15,352
 "we're gonna give you a Easter 
      party, when you land,     

178
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,989
       and we'll be there       
        waiting for you."       

179
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:24,528
 Well, that really sent shivers 
    up and down one's spine.

184
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:42,279

          that morning.         

185
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:46,150
       He had volunteered       
      to return to combat.

          it was quiet.         

187
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:56,126
 As the landing crafts went in, 
     you just walked ashore.    

188
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,561
     Couldn't believe this.

    were at the landing, too,   

196
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,332
        and so relieved,        
       they began to sing

    They issued orders later    
          that if, uh,          

256
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:43,040
  the minute American or Allied 
forces landed on their homeland,

257
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,841
 to shoot all prisoners of war. 

258
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:48,779
       So we had basically      
       accepted our fate.       

259
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:57,754
            NARRATOR:           
    Glenn Frazier was one of    
 168,000 Allied prisoners of war

260
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,256
    still in Japanese hands.    

261
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:04,460
      He had been a captive     
  since the surrender on Bataan 

262
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:06,496
     in the spring of 1942.     

263
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:12,168
    He was now in his fourth    
 POW camp in Japan, at Tsuruga, 

264
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,941
       southwest of Tokyo,      
      on the Sea of Japan.      

265
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,509
            (gunfire)           

266
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,380
     One day, their captors     
     permitted 50 prisoners     

267
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:27,184
to wash their own filthy clothes
          in the ocean.         

268
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:32,790
    They were sitting around    
waiting for their clothes to dry

269
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,191
       when carrier-based       
        American bombers        

270
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:38,128
  roared in to attack the port. 

271
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,768
            FRAZIER:            
  We run out of the warehouse,  

272
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,206
 or at the end of the dock, and 
 were across the railroad tracks

273
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,441
         and was waving,        
        and we knew then        

274
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,878
that the aircraft carrier planes
           were close.          

275
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,282
        And we knew that        
    the end was coming close.   

276
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,219
      But that did not help     
          our feelings          

277
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:05,722
 as to what was about to happen.

278
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:09,827
         Our lives were         
     going to be sacrificed.    

279
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:21,972
        RADIO ANNOUNCER:        
    We interrupt this program   
          to bring you          

280
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,340
     a special news bulletin    
      from CBS World News.      

281
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:26,777
       A press association      
       has just announced       

282
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,845
    that President Roosevelt    
            is dead.            

283
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,147
       The president died       
    of a cerebral hemorrhage.   

284
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,684
       All we know so far       
   is that the president died   

285
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,786
   at Warm Springs in Georgia.  

286
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:40,290
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
       We can all tell you      
          where we were         

287
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:44,627
          when we heard         
    that Roosevelt had died.    

288
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:48,598
       President Roosevelt      
          was really...         

289
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,835
        the binding force       

290
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,536
     for the United States.     

291
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,941
      When he would come on     
  and give his fireside chats,  

292
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,744
         we all gathered        
        around the radio,       

293
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,481
   and everyone looked to him   
         for leadership.        

294
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,784
          He had led us         
     out of the Depression,     

295
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,053
       so we felt that...       

296
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,790
   certainly he could lead us   
         through a war.         

297
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,726
                              

298
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:26,469
 And when the news came in April
        that he had died,       

299
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:32,709
     it was a terrible blow     
     to the entire country.     

300
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:37,080
          BURT WILSON:          
      It was catastrophic,      

301
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,484
         because he was         
   the only president we knew   

302
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:45,088
   for the first 12, 13 years   
          of our life.          

303
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,461
       Now, the thing was,      
   my parents were Republicans  

304
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,563
      and hated Roosevelt,      
        but I loved him.        

305
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:57,300
       And most of us kids      
         loved him, too.        

306
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,636
         Because he was         
       the face of America      

307
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:04,574
        that was saying,        
"Hey, things are gonna be okay."

308
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,115
                              

309
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:28,431
             HYNES:             
         I was standing         
      outside a Quonset hut     

310
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,099
looking across the little strait

311
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:34,504
   between Saipan and Tinian,   
        the next island,        

312
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,774
          and... I felt         
     a great sense of loss.     

313
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:43,613
  More than that, I think, "How 
 will we go on fighting the war 

314
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:48,751
   when our commander in chief  
            is dead?"           

315
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:52,756
          PAUL FUSSELL:         
 We were all very sad about it. 

316
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:56,326
    Less about his leaving...   

317
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,895
     than about irony of it.    

318
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:02,199
          If he'd died          
    a few months, uh, later,    

319
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:07,837
 he could have seen the success 
      of what he had done.      

320
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,742
            NARRATOR:           
      The men of the 100th      
       442nd Combat Team--      

321
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:16,513
 the Japanese-American unit that
had already distinguished itself

322
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,948
         in the fighting        
     for Italy and France--     

323
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,885
   were back in the mountains   
        of Northern Italy       

324
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:25,054
       when they got word       
      of Roosevelt's death.     

325
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:29,326
     He had signed the order    
  that sent to internment camps 

326
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:32,895
     the families from which    
     many of them had come,     

327
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:36,933
  but he had also provided them 
      with the opportunity      

328
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:41,037
     to prove their loyalty     
       on the battlefield.      

329
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,142
         It was that FDR        
     they chose to remember.    

330
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,445
         DANIEL INOUYE:         
      I remember that day,      

331
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:56,486
  because when we got the word, 
   suddenly men in my platoon   

332
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,656
     took out their bayonets    
         and put it on.         

333
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,392
          (gunfire)             
           And I said,          
    "What's happening here?"    

334
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:09,132
 He says, "Well, I think we got 
to do this one for the old man."

335
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:13,303
       They just stood up       
     and started attacking.     

336
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,738
       (gunfire continues)      

337
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,474
      Radio calls coming in     
   from the company commander,  

338
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:20,076
        "What in the hell       
    are you doing?" you know.   

339
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,778
      "You're not supposed      
        to be attacking."       

340
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,081
        I says, "Captain,       
      you can't stop 'em."      

341
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,315
           (laughing)           

342
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:30,687
       And so they're all       
 moving forward for the old man,

343
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,356
    a man they had never met.   

344
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:37,660
      (bugle playing taps)      

345
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,906
            NARRATOR:           
         Many Americans,        
  overseas as well as at home,  

346
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,776
     couldn't even remember     
       the name of the man      

347
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:56,046
           who was now          
   their commander in chief...  

348
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:59,249
        ...Harry Truman.        

349
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:04,687
              MAN:              
           All aboard!          

350
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:10,860
          I guess I had        
  a million dolls or more...   

351
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:15,631
       I guess I've played     
the doll game o'er and o'er... 

352
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:19,569
        QUENTIN AANENSON:       
     I had great difficulty     
      adjusting to the fact     

353
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:21,470
     that I was going home.     

354
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,107
    That's why I'm blue...    

355
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,908
   Landed at Washington, D.C.,  

356
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,911
          was processed         
  through some paperwork there, 

357
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:34,884
 caught a train at Union Station
  taking me down to Louisiana,  

358
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,252
        where Jackie was.       

359
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:41,057
         To love a doll        
    that's not your own...     

360
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,861
 I'm through with all of them 

361
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,730
     I'll never fall again    

362
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,598
          <i> Say, boy</i>           

363
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,234
      <i> Whatcha gonna do?</i>      

364
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:55,504
            NARRATOR:           
 Fighter pilot Quentin Aanenson 
     of Luverne, Minnesota,     

365
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:58,641
  was home on leave that April. 

366
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:02,545
   He had been in more-or-less  
   continuous combat in Europe  

367
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,548
          since D-Day--         
       ten ghastly months       

368
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,452
  during which he'd killed men  
     and seen friends killed    

369
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:13,523
       and come very close      
   to collapsing from despair.  

370
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:17,193
 He expected soon to be ordered 
       into action again,       

371
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,494
    in the Pacific this time,   

372
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,798
    and he desperately wanted   
      to see Jackie Greer,      

373
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,569
       the Louisiana girl       
  with whom he'd fallen in love 

374
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,070
     before going overseas.     

375
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:32,776
      Her letters had been      
  Aanenson's anchor to sanity.  

376
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:37,113
             GREER:             
I-I prayed for him to come back,

377
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:42,051
 and I just felt like my prayers
       would be answered.       

378
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,053
  I was walking down the street 

379
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,656
   and I saw the wedding dress  
          in a window.          

380
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:50,860
 So I went right in and I bought
           that dress           

381
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:57,400
 and shipped it to my mother and
I said, "Have this ready for me.

382
00:28:57,402 --> 00:29:01,838
            NARRATOR:           
 Now the two were to meet again.

383
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,777
            AANENSON:           
  And I had to adjust to being  
       away from the war.       

384
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:13,049
    The silence was difficult   
         to get used to.        

385
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:19,856
But it was such a... an exciting
    and unbelievable moment.    

386
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:24,527
          I was alive,          
      and this was Jackie.      

387
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:28,364
             GREER:             
        The first night,        
   we were in the living room   

388
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:32,969
 and he formally proposed to me.

389
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:38,642
 And for some reason, I got shy.

390
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:42,912
      And I couldn't quite      
     make myself say, "Yes."    

391
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,616
    I don't know why because    
       I'd been saying yes      

392
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,217
    for 11 months, you know.    

393
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:54,090
    And when I hesitated and,   
   and couldn't quite say yes,  

394
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,726
      he said, "Well, now,      
    just make up your mind."    

395
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:04,000
  The funny part was, the door  
 right near my chair was closed,

396
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:07,070
      and on the other side     
     of that door was my bed    

397
00:30:07,072 --> 00:30:12,242
with that gorgeous wedding dress
     spread out all over it.    

398
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:17,847
            AANENSON:           
  I was going to be going back  
           to the war.          

399
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:21,384
 I didn't want to face the idea 
      that she could end up     

400
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,820
    being a widow in a couple   
           of months.           

401
00:30:24,822 --> 00:30:27,257
  But it... the more we talked  
            about it,           

402
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:32,261
      the more we decided,      
    "Let's get married now."    

403
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:36,832
 So we got married on April 17, 

404
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,635
      two and a half weeks      
        after I got home,       

405
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:43,706
  in the First Methodist Church 
         in Baton Rouge.        

406
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:50,413
    As I saw her coming down    
           that aisle,          

407
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:55,418
      it was just a thrill      
         beyond belief.         

408
00:31:05,262 --> 00:31:09,966
    (dramatic music playing)    

409
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:15,805
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
  In their stupendous advances, 
       the Russian armies       

410
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:18,140
    feature massed artillery.   

411
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:27,517
The kind of warfare the Russians
   wage on the road to Berlin.  

412
00:31:32,823 --> 00:31:35,257
            NARRATOR:           
  By the middle of April 1945,  

413
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:39,896
     Soviet troops were just    
      30 miles from Berlin      

414
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,898
       and bent on revenge      

415
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,869
  for the horrors the Nazis had 
  inflicted on their homeland.  

416
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:51,307
    General Dwight Eisenhower   
             decreed            

417
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,009
         that the armies        
        under his command       

418
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:59,082
    would not drive directly    
   toward the German capital.   

419
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:04,954
The deadly task of capturing the
 city would go to the Red Army. 

420
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:11,427
  Hitler called upon his people 
      to resist to the end.     

421
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,965
  "Every village and every town 
    will be defended and held   

422
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:19,936
by every possible man," he said.

423
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,974
  For the Americans in Europe,  

424
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:28,644
  the fighting and the killing  
          sputtered on.         

425
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,215
         DANIEL INOUYE:         
  And that's a horrible thing,  

426
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:34,217
     knowing that the war is    
          going to end,         

427
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:39,288
   and you have to keep urging  
     your men to go forward.    

428
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,659
            NARRATOR:           
   The 100th 442nd Combat Team  

429
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,460
   was still in the mountains   
        of Northern Italy       

430
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:49,765
   hammering away at the last   
     German positions there.    

431
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:59,942
             INOUYE:            
     We had this objective,     
        a high mountain.        

432
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,878
       As I was going up,       

433
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,183
I suddenly felt someone punching
         me on the side.        

434
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,952
  That's what I thought it was. 

435
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:13,823
    I fell down and I got up    
       and kept on moving.      

436
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:18,428
   I had a bullet going right   
       through my abdomen.      

437
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:23,733
  Came out just about a quarter 
       inch from my spine.      

438
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:27,536
            NARRATOR:           
     Three machine gun nests    
   were firing down at Inouye   

439
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,340
         as he continued        
  to lead his men up the slope. 

440
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,309
       He hurled a grenade      
   to knock out the first one,  

441
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,345
      then killed its crew      
       with his tommy gun.      

442
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,616
    He silenced the next gun    
     with two more grenades.    

443
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,919
      As he pulled the pin      
         on yet another         

444
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,757
    and got ready to throw it   
into the third machine gun nest,

445
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,861
 German shrapnel nearly severed 
       Inouye's right arm.      

446
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:56,432
  Somehow, with his left hand,  
    he pried his dead fingers   

447
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,836
      from the live grenade     
          and threw it,         

448
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:03,038
 then started up the hill again.

449
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,708
             INOUYE:            
      According to the men      

450
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,611
   and according to my company  
       commander, he says,      

451
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:11,547
         "For a moment,         
        you went berserk.       

452
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,150
    You picked up your gun."    

453
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,785
I had a Thompson sub-machine gun

454
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,988
      and with my left hand     
       started approaching      

455
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:23,459
   the last machine gun nest,   
           just firing          

456
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,661
       and with the blood       
        splattering out.        

457
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,531
    It was a horrible sight,    
            I think.            

458
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:32,001
    Finally, I got hit again    
           on my leg,           

459
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:36,772
and I kept rolling down the hill
      and that was the end.     

460
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:46,549
            NARRATOR:           
     German prisoners of war    
    were pressed into service   

461
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,953
         to carry Inouye        
       back down the hill.      

462
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:57,693
      He was given morphine     
      at the aid station--      

463
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:02,264
   so much morphine that when   
 surgeons at the field hospital 

464
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,233
        began to amputate       
       his shattered arm,       

465
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:08,637
       he had to endure it      
       without anesthetic.      

466
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,674
    The pain was so intense,    
         he remembered,         

467
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:15,811
     "that dying didn't seem    
    like such an awful idea."   

468
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:23,986
             INOUYE:            
      I ended up receiving      
  17 whole blood transfusions.  

469
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:29,459
 Before they gave you the blood,
   they showed you the bottle,  

470
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,961
 and on that bottle was a label 

471
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,965
    that had the name, rank,    
   serial number and the unit.  

472
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:40,736
     And so, here is someone    
      with some fancy name,     

473
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:48,677
      Thomas Jefferson Lee,     
 a serial number, 92nd Division.

474
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:53,149
     was a unit that we were    
 attached to in the last battle,

475
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:58,421
     and they're all made up    
      of African-Americans.     

476
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:05,060
    And all the bottles I saw   
  were from the 92nd Division.  

477
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:11,734
  So I must have had 17 bottles 
 of good African-American blood.

478
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,437
        And so here I am.       

479
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:17,073
            NARRATOR:           
   For his heroism under fire,  

480
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:21,877
   Daniel Inouye would receive  
       the Medal of Honor.      

481
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:25,681
      It was granted to him     
         55 years later,        

482
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,982
      during his sixth term     

483
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:32,021
   as a United States senator   
          from Hawaii.          

484
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:36,158
                              

485
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,763
   Meanwhile, events in Europe  
       were moving so fast      

486
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:44,133
   it was hard for the people   
    back home to keep track.    

487
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,469
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
        On the final lap        
    of their drive on Berlin,   

488
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:51,674
       Russian troops send      
      the Germans reeling.      

489
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:03,886
            NARRATOR:           
      On April 25, American     
   and Soviet forces linked up  

490
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,356
  at Torgau on the Elbe River.  

491
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,930
  Germany had been cut in half. 

492
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:25,407
   The next day, Soviet troops  
 began assaulting Berlin itself.

493
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:48,564
       (distant shouting)       

494
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,576
   On the morning of April 30,  

495
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:04,213
 Russian troops fought their way
       into the Reichstag,      

496
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,850
   the symbol of German power.  

497
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:23,399
   Less than half a mile away,  
       beneath the rubble,      

498
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:29,204
  Adolf Hitler and his closest  
 aides huddled in their bunker. 

499
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:34,644
         That afternoon,        
Hitler named Admiral Karl Donitz

500
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:40,449
         to succeed him,        
 then shot himself in the mouth.

501
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:46,922
     Only his most fanatical    
            followers           

502
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:49,992
   now continued to fight on.   

503
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:21,557
          PAUL FUSSELL:         
  Eisenhower, on D-Day morning, 
    distributed to the troops   

504
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:25,895
a general order, which is like a
 handbill, and everybody read it

505
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:30,599
  and he said, "We are about to 
 embark upon the great crusade,"

506
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:35,070
    which we'd been preparing   
    for for many months, etc.   

507
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,373
    Now, at first none of us    
          could believe         

508
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,509
 it was anything like a crusade,
  because we were playing dice  

509
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,411
and we were thinking about girls
          all the time          

510
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,880
      and getting as drunk      
    as possible and so forth.   

511
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,348
    It wasn't like a crusade.   

512
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,718
     There was no religious     
    dimension to it whatever.   

513
00:39:52,455 --> 00:39:56,492
  When they finally got across  
     France and into Germany    

514
00:39:56,494 --> 00:40:00,496
       and saw the German       
         death camps...         

515
00:40:05,268 --> 00:40:12,308
        (voice breaking):       
 they realized that they had... 

516
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:15,244
          been engaged          
  in something like a crusade,  

517
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:19,348
      although none of them     
         called it that.        

518
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:26,855
    And it all began to make    
     a kind of sense to us.     

519
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,592
          I'm not sure          
    that made it any better.    

520
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,659
   It may have made it worse.   

521
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,863
       To see that it was       
       actually conducted       

522
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:39,235
 in defense of some noble idea. 

523
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,710
            NARRATOR:           
    As the Red Army had moved   
     through Eastern Europe     

524
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:48,778
      the previous summer,      

525
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,981
 it had uncovered at Majdaneck, 
           in Poland,           

526
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:56,251
the first evidence of the Nazis'
    industrialized barbarism.   

527
00:40:56,253 --> 00:41:00,288
     The ashes of thousands     
         of human beings        

528
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,658
  were found in a crematorium.  

529
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:09,765
 The American and British press 
         played it down,        

530
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,435
      assuming the Soviets      
       were exaggerating.       

531
00:41:15,538 --> 00:41:20,542
       Not even the Nazis       
     could be so murderous.     

532
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:31,153
    By the end of April 1945,   

533
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:36,993
  more than a hundred camps and 
  sub-camps would be liberated. 

534
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:52,508
      Auschwitz, Treblinka,     
          Ravensbrck,          

535
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,845
      Ohrdruf, Buchenwald,      

536
00:41:55,847 --> 00:42:02,385
   Bergen-Belsen, Nordhausen,   
             Dachau.            

537
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:12,294
On May 5, advance patrols of the
 American 11th Armored Division 

538
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,963
came upon Mauthausen in Austria.

539
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:19,534
        There they found        
        more than 110,000       

540
00:42:19,536 --> 00:42:22,404
       desperate so-called      
     "enemies of the Reich,"    

541
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:29,278
     men, women and children    
  confined behind barbed wire.  

542
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:35,050
  Many were too weak to stand.  

543
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:39,688
     Private Burnett Miller     
     of Sacramento was there    

544
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,958
         and saw it all.        

545
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,760
And they had put some signs out,

546
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,029
       "Welcome Americans,      
        you've saved us"        

547
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,097
      and things like this.     

548
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,065
   And we surrounded the camp   

549
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:53,202
          and then, uh,         
   there was a surge of people  

550
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:56,238
     who were in fairly good    
   condition begging for food,  

551
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,610
     and we were giving them    
        what food we had,       

552
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:05,948
        and in some cases       
  it overwhelmed their systems  

553
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,249
    and actually killed them.   

554
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,118
  I'm sure we were responsible  

555
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,619
         for the deaths         
    of several hundred people   

556
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:15,424
      just by feeding them      
       concentrated food.       

557
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:20,763
We went down in the basement and
 there were these big furnaces, 

558
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:23,733
   and it looked like cordwood  
          piled around          

559
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:26,702
  and they were bodies in rigor 
    mortis that they were...    

560
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:33,242
   had been preparing to burn   
     in these big furnaces.     

561
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:36,379
    And the fellows that went   
     into the other barracks    

562
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:38,981
     came away just shocked,    
  some of them very, very sick. 

563
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:42,217
       The hospital there,      
     people dying just thick    

564
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:45,221
   and people couldn't get out  
         of their bunks         

565
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:47,656
           and people           
     in terrible condition.     

566
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:51,460
    And then later there was    
          a big trench,         

567
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,029
 and it was filled with bodies. 

568
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:09,544
        Some were dying,        
 some were trying to steal food 

569
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:14,516
    and, uh, the, the guards    
 were dispersed all over and we,

570
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:17,152
  we actually saw a guard move  
          into a house          

571
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:21,757
      and we chased him in,     
     and he was an officer.     

572
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:26,762
And the prisoners who were there
         tore him apart,        

573
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,965
  just killed him right there.  

574
00:44:33,036 --> 00:44:35,070
     We lived in Mauthausen,    

575
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:39,542
   which was an idyllic little  
   Austrian town on the river,  

576
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:41,543
  but you could smell the camp  
            in town.            

577
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:44,880
 And all the villagers of course
 said they didn't know anything 

578
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,616
         about the camp,        
    and the local priest said   

579
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,418
     he didn't know anything    
         about the camp,        

580
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,153
   and I knew that was a lie,   

581
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:52,454
     because you could smell    
            the camp.           

582
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:58,727
      You could just smell,     
           uh, death.           

583
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:07,803
      So it was a horrible,     
      horrible experience.      

584
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:12,307
        And then we came,       
    at least I came to think,   

585
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:16,912
  "Well, you know, this effort  
      has been worthwhile.      

586
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,580
     There was a real reason    
          to do this."          

587
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:25,086
    These were inhuman things   
 that were being done to people.

588
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:34,830
            NARRATOR:           
 Other Americans were witnessing
 similar horrors at other camps.

589
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,766
      Ray Leopold, a medic      
    from Waterbury and a Jew,   

590
00:45:37,768 --> 00:45:44,540
        was with the 28th       
       Infantry Division.       

591
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:48,210
           We were...           

592
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:55,550
        near the Hadamar        
       concentration camp.      

593
00:45:55,552 --> 00:46:00,856
   At the same time we noticed  
       that up on the hill      

594
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:05,994
     that the Brgermeister     
 described as an insane asylum. 

595
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:09,297
        We went up there        
      and found that, true,     

596
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:13,435
          they did have         
     an insane asylum there,    

597
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,005
       at least initially,      
       but it was a place       

598
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:22,845
     where there was medical    
experimentation going on humans.

599
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:31,887
     I really can't tell you    
        what I saw there.       

600
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:48,804
   It affected me profoundly,   

601
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:54,777
     and I think all the men    
  who were with me at that time 

602
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:57,179
     were equally affected.     

603
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:02,284
       I, um, I felt that       
         it was too bad         

604
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:09,425
   that I was forbidden by the  
   Geneva Convention to kill.   

605
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:19,368
  I... I felt that this was the 
 most horrible human experience 

606
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:25,741
   that had ever been visited   
    on the face of the earth.   

607
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:41,823
   I saw one of those terrible  
    places where they were...   

608
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:45,727
    where they had the people   
    that were dying and dead    

609
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:49,264
       and bodies stacked       
    like cordwood, cordwood.    

610
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:54,069
    That was the little town    
         of Ludwigslust.        

611
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:58,206
  And we made the German people 
        in that community       

612
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:04,145
       go get those bodies      
  and had a burial in the park  

613
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,381
     in front of the castle     

614
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:09,017
    so that they would never    
        forget it again.        

615
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:14,890
  And we gave them a Christian  
       and Jewish burial.       

616
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,826
     But the people did it.     

617
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:21,397
      I mean, we... we made     
    the German people do it.    

618
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:43,084
  These people in this country  
   who say it didn't happen...  

619
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,753
          It happened.          

620
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:48,457
        I saw it; I know.       

621
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:51,326
          It happened.          

622
00:48:54,263 --> 00:49:00,235
            NARRATOR:           
       In 1933, there were      
  nine million Jews in Europe.  

623
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:06,875
    By 1945, two out of three   
       of them were dead.       

624
00:49:20,656 --> 00:49:23,025
 Thousands of Jewish communities
           were wiped           

625
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,393
   from the face of the earth.  

626
00:49:28,764 --> 00:49:30,498
Hitler's regime also slaughtered

627
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,102
       nearly two million       
        non-Jewish Poles.       

628
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:38,107
  They murdered more than four  
million Soviet prisoners of war,

629
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:41,110
as well as hundreds of thousands
      of handicapped people     

630
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:45,647
    and political opponents,    
     homosexuals and gypsies    

631
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,884
     and Jehovah's Witnesses    
       and slave laborers       

632
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:52,854
     from all the countries     
        they'd conquered.       

633
00:50:17,713 --> 00:50:23,685
            LEOPOLD:            
         How bad it was,        
       how wide it was...       

634
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,922
      We never really knew      
       how fully extensive      

635
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:30,025
   this horror that Hitler had  
       visited on Europe,       

636
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:35,797
        and in particular       
    on the Jews, how it was.    

637
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:41,003
    But here we began to see.   

638
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:43,638
         We had no idea         

639
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:50,912
 that there was going to be six 
 million dead Jews as a result. 

640
00:50:54,951 --> 00:51:00,856
     I... I think the horror    
        is still with me.       

641
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:10,565
 I think there's no apology that
 can ever atone for what I saw.

            NARRATOR:           
      On May 8, three days      

643
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,952
   after Burnett Miller's unit  
       reached Mauthausen,      

644
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:34,056
  Germany finally surrendered.  

645
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:39,961
        The war in Europe       
       had come to an end.      

646
00:51:41,397 --> 00:51:43,431
      The Reich that Hitler     
          had promised          

647
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,233
          would endure          
      for a thousand years      

648
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,971
  had lasted less than a dozen. 

649

  General Eisenhower informs me 

652
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:17,699
  that the flags of freedom fly 
        all over Europe.        

653
00:52:19,535 --> 00:52:23,071
        This is a solemn        
       but glorious hour.       

654
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:28,610
           I wish that          
 Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived

655
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:30,979
        to see this day.        

656

   The Japanese were not going  
     to fight any less hard     

674
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:30,732
  because Hitler was out of it.

       (machine gun fire)       

676
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:35,303
       I suppose there was      
     a certain satisfaction     

677
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,938
    that we'd beaten that lot   

678
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,275

      entirely to this lot,

      but aside from that,      

680

          I don't think

            NARRATOR:           
     The battle for Okinawa     
       was not going well.      

689
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:46,741
     The Marines had cleared    
 the northern and central parts 

690
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:48,977
   of the island by mid-April.  

691
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:52,380
        But in the south,       
    the Army had been unable    

692
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:55,583
   to blast the Japanese from   
 their main defensive positions,

693
00:55:55,585 --> 00:56:02,290
a succession of limestone ridges
around the walled town of Shuri.

694
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:09,731
            The Navy,           
     battered daily offshore    

695
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,467
          by kamikazes          
  and other Japanese warplanes, 

696
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,502
     demanded that the Army     

697
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,771
   undertake a landing behind   
       the Japanese lines       

698
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:22,477
 so that they could be attacked 
 from two sides simultaneously. 

699

   The Army commander refused.  

700
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,585
    And on the first of May,    

701
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:34,889
   the First Marine Division,   
     Eugene Sledge's outfit,    

702
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:39,394
     to shore up the center

        above the battle        

737
00:59:37,774 --> 00:59:40,741
doesn't see the terrible things.

738

      You see destruction.

You don't see the dead civilians

You don't see the dead Japanese.

756
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:20,141
  Rain pounded down, more than  
     a foot of it in a week,    

757
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:27,048
    washing maggots and feces   
   into the Marines' foxholes.  

758
01:01:27,782 --> 01:01:30,518
  The stench was overpowering.  

759
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:37,191
    There was no relief from    
    any of it, day after day.   

760
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:40,661
      SLEDGE (dramatized):      
  "If a Marine slipped and slid 

761
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:43,531
      "down the back slope      
       of the muddy ridge,      

762
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,634
       he was apt to reach      
      the bottom vomiting."     

763
01:01:49,204 --> 01:01:52,807
    "I saw more than one man    
    stand up horror-stricken    

764
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:56,411
   "as fat maggots tumbled out  
 of his muddy dungaree pockets, 

765
01:01:56,413 --> 01:02:01,416
"cartridge belt, legging lacings
          and the like.         

766
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:05,753
         "We didn't talk        
       about such things.       

767
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:09,123
     "They were too horrible    
           and obscene          

768
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,993
  "even for hardened veterans.  

769
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:19,466
  I believed we had been flung  
   into hell's own cesspool."   

770
01:02:20,669 --> 01:02:26,207
            NARRATOR:           
   Nearly 3,000 Americans died  
    taking Sugar Loaf Hill--    

771
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:32,746
    more per square foot than   
    anywhere else in the war.   

772
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:43,924
 In late May, the Japanese began
  a carefully staged withdrawal 

773
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:48,496
  slipping back ten miles or so 
     to their last redoubt,     

774
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:54,102
    another series of ridges    
  at the island's southern end. 

775
01:02:59,274 --> 01:03:03,177
  It would be three more weeks  
    before its last defenders   

776
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:10,084
were killed and their commanders
       committed suicide.       

777
01:03:11,953 --> 01:03:16,123
         By then, 92,000        
        Japanese soldiers       

778
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:22,430
 and as many as 100,000 Okinawan
      civilians were dead.      

779
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:39,713
       Of the 235 members       
  of Eugene Sledge's Company K  

780
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:46,153
     who landed on Okinawa,     
     just 26 emerged unhurt.    

781
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:52,093
  Of the 254 men brought in to  
  replace those who had fallen, 

782
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:55,462
        only 24 remained.       

783
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,367
           In the end,          

784
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:04,839
more than 12,000 Americans died,

785
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,573
      60,000 were wounded--     

786
01:04:06,575 --> 01:04:12,079
        the worst losses        
       of the Pacific war.      

787
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:26,060
   Among the dead were Private  
    First Class J.J. McCarthy   

788
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:31,499
     of Waterbury; Sergeant     
   Jeff Fleming of Sacramento;  

789
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:35,603
 Private First Class Lowell Reu 
           of Luverne,          

790
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:39,339
     and Private Ernest Roy     
           of Mobile.           

791
01:04:40,709 --> 01:04:45,346
 As the Allies prepared to move 
       on to Japan itself,      

792
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:51,319
   still more terrible losses   
       seemed inevitable.       

793
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:00,027
             HYNES:             
          We were told          

794
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:02,196
 that in the invasion of Japan, 

795
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:08,769
we would be the first land-based
 single engine bombing squadron.

796
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:13,907
 To go in, be in on the invasion
  of the Japanese home island.  

797
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:17,378
   That would be heroic stuff.  

798
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:22,884
 But at the same time, by then, 
  our sense of the strangeness  

799
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:27,254
   of the Japanese opposition   
      had become stronger.      

800
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:31,826
       And I could imagine      
    every farmer with his...    

801
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:35,128
       with his pitchfork       

802
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,397
       coming at my guts;       

803
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:39,266
        every pretty girl       
       with a hand grenade      

804
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:42,135
     strapped to her bottom     
         or something...        

805
01:05:42,137 --> 01:05:46,407
That everyone would be an enemy.

806
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:49,977
            NARRATOR:           
   The Allies planned to begin  

807
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:55,450
    with the island of Kyushu   
      on November 1, 1945.      

808
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:58,119
        More than 500,000       
         Japanese troops        

809
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,654
    were already in position    
         to repel them--        

810
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:04,692
     and another six million    
     were either under arms     

811
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:07,928
    or ready to be called up.   

812
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:12,166
    Women and schoolchildren    
          were drilling         

813
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:15,736
  with sharpened bamboo spears. 

814
01:06:18,006 --> 01:06:19,240
  The Americans did not expect  

815
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:22,977
   to be able to move against   
   the larger island of Honshu  

816
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,313
      until April of 1946.      

817
01:06:28,016 --> 01:06:31,518
 Former president Herbert Hoover
       headed a commission      

818
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,722
  that suggested half a million 
       Americans might die      

819
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,491
       before the islands       
        could be taken--        

820
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:43,297
       along with perhaps       
  seven million more Japanese.  

821
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:48,636
    Military planners came up   
    with different estimates,   

822
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:55,142
 was that the cost in casualties
 was likely to be astronomical. 

823
01:06:55,144 --> 01:07:00,247
       The end of the war       
         in the Pacific         

824
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:03,183
   still seemed very far away.  

825
01:07:05,386 --> 01:07:10,624
  G.I.'s who had once talked of 
   getting "Home Alive in '45"  

826
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:16,029
   began to coin new slogans:   
  "Back in the Sticks in '46,"  

827
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:23,003
   "Back to Heaven in '47 "...  
   even "Golden Gate in '48."   

828
01:07:24,539 --> 01:07:27,541
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
       The soviet premier,      
      the remaining member      

829
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,810
   of the original Roosevelt-   
   Churchill-Stalin Big Three.  

830
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:34,148
   Now President Truman greets  
     Prime Minister Attlee.     

831
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,317
       And the conference       
   of the Big Three at Potsdam  

832
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,387
         sets the policy        
      of the Allied powers.     

833
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:46,360
            NARRATOR:           
   In mid-July, the Allies met  
     in Germany, at Potsdam,    

834
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:47,695
     and set forth the terms    

835
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:51,065
  under which they would agree  
         to end the war.        

836
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:53,867
   Japan's leaders would have   
           to abandon           

837
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,736
   every inch of their empire,  

838
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:59,973
   face trial for war crimes,   

839
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:04,545
  submit to being disarmed, and 
  agree to American occupation  

840
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:08,348
   until a new, democratically  
       elected government       

841
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,350
      could be established.     

842
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:14,388
Unless they agreed to all of it,

843
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:17,024
     the declaration warned,    
        they could expect       

844
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:21,361
     "the utter devastation     
   of the Japanese homeland."   

845
01:08:22,397 --> 01:08:28,235
   Japan chose not to respond   
    to the Allied ultimatum,    

846
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:31,204
        and tried instead       
       to persuade Russia,      

847
01:08:31,206 --> 01:08:33,741
    which had never declared    
          war on Japan,         

848
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:38,111
    to broker more favorable    
        surrender terms.        

849
01:08:39,213 --> 01:08:40,914
  For most of Japan's leaders-- 

850
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:44,184
 despite the agony the Japanese 
      people were enduring,     

851
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:48,689
 despite the even greater agony 
   that seemed sure to come--   

852
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:54,662
     unconditional surrender    
   still remained unthinkable.
