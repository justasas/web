00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:41,470
It's the twins - Youngmin and Kwangmin.
They had many fans due to their good looks.

9

before their debut.

14
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,940
In "Don't Touch My Girl," their
2nd single, they sung of pure love.

Seungyub is another one who appeared
on TV as a child actor before his debut.

19
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,140
Alright then.

20
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,580
You're talkative when feeling good
and play innocent when feeling bad?

21
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,150
I think all women
are like that, dad.

22
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,050
That boy became a member of A-JAX.

It's the 12 member group, EXO.

30
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,630
The strategy they took for their
activities were unusual.

31
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,620
They released their prologue single
before their official debut and...

32
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:48,430

active simultaneously in Korea and China.

to present EXO's "Mama."

53
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,430
This stage is possible due
to their special strategy.

54
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:58,970
The concept of coming from Exoplanet with
supernatural powers is their uniqueness.

55
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,960
Earth, fire, wind, water, light,
and even teleportation...

56
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,950
I remember shouting out
these words as a child.

57
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,520
Sehun, blow some wind.

58
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,900
Sehun, master of wind, blows wind
for them in this sweltering heat.

59
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:21,950
Kai is mad at the warm wind.
He calls Sehun and begs for wind.

60
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:28,800
Maybe it fits only them. If I call
Suho, will he quench my thirst?

61
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,960
There's a group that combined such powers
into their song in May 2012 after EXO.

62

[It's their debut song with a higher
degree of perfection in sound]

68
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:33,870
The mascot that made their stage
even special is the robot ROVIXX.

69
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,760
It's a special work of art by
pop artist Charles Jang.

70
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:45,950
ROVIXX is composed of various characteristics
of heroes and sometimes called their 7th member.

71

They were called "art-dol"
for such a strategy.

75
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,630
They made a surprise transformation into
artists by partaking in a Batman exhibition.

76
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:16,950
The size is 91 x 72.7 cm.

77
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,550
The "VIXX" here is the key.
Batman is saying, "VIXX."

78
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:27,000
Look at the eyes.
There's nothing in there.

79
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,550
- He is angry.
- You didn't finish his eyes.

80
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,070
He has dark circles like me.

81
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,410
Those are muscles.

82
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,120
- That's the shoulder...
- What muscle is that?

83
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,700
It's this muscle. I have them.

84
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,360
This is his nose.

85
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,060
These are wrinkles on his mouth.

86
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,010
- Since he's old?
- Yes, that's right.

87
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:59,640
This is around $50,000.

88
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,430
But I'll sell it to
you for $40,000.

89
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,380
- Thank you.
- How about it?

90
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,590
- Are you buying it?
- I'm not buying it.

94
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,430
The title is "Stylish bat."

95
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:25,030
Since Batman is the theme here,
contrasting Batman's dark image...

96
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:30,290
Within the darkness,
I did some graffiti.

97
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:34,260
So I called it "Stylish bat."
As you came here...

98
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,820
This is the authority of "art-dols."

99
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,720
There's another reason why VIXX
drew attention before their debut.

100
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,680
It's their agency family.

Thanks to them, their skills
have become more exceptional.

- Park Hyo-shin does.

Not only do they sing
their songs passionately...

113
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,170
We came to support Seo In-guk.

114

You know how he resembles me.
I'm boring, but he's boring too.

I guess that's what a relationship is.
They even resemble each other.

heartwarming family.

This ballad was prereleased
before A-JAX's debut.

00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,020
The doll of Goo Ha-ra in their
music video was memorable.

00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:59,210
A certain group had a 100 day promotion
with an online teaser before their debut.

162
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,810
They are the 12 member group EXO.

163
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:12,300
They showed a small teaser before their
debut but received a positive response.

164
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:24,260
You can get their feel in the teasers.
Why don't you listen to the full song?

165
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,080
[Another Charm]

166
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,960
To become heroes that captivate all...

167
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,220
They have to show off their talents
elsewhere and not only on stage.

168
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,040
Let's see what they have done.

169
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:10,120
BOYFRIEND and VIXX showed their hidden
talents on a reality show on SBS MTV.

170
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:15,430
To grow up into Korea's idol, "Wonder Boy"
is their project to unleash their potential.

171
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,550
Hyunseong is a 20-year-old
celebrity making big.

172
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,410
- Huh?
- Sing a song.

173
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,810
[Two women recognized BOYFRIEND!]

174
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
[Success]

175
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,890
- Do you know me?
- Yes.

176
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,250
Do you know my name?

177
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,820
[Hyun! Seong!]

178
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,340
[Trying to figure out]

179
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,880
[That's dirty!]

180
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,040
We can see your mouth.

181
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,940
They still don't know.

182
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,140
Hyun... Seong?

183
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,100
[Bingo]

184
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,850
Are the other members here?

185
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,980
Other members? No.
I'm the only one here.

186
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,690
[Trying to hog the limelight]

187
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,990
Ask if they know any names
of the other members.

188
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:01,550
Do you know the names of
anyone other than me?

189
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,420
- Youngmin!
- Donghyun!

190
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,900
[These two are known abroad]

191
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,810
Youngmin and Donghyun!

192
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,260
Want to take pictures?

193
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:16,220
This is Korea, but foreigners
recognize them more than Koreans.

194
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:28,420
Go again to a large crowd and say,
"Step aside! Celebrity coming through!"

195
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,340
- This is the last.
- Start moving.

196
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:37,960
Celebrity coming through.
Please step aside.

197
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,680
A mission to increase their awareness
is basic. You're doing great Hyunseong!

198
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,830
[Slapped with water]

199
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,030
[Slow motion]

200

[Does his best to roll]

202
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,310
[True as heard]

203
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:00,140
He overcame the pressures of slo-mo.

204
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,610
Screen captures and animated GIFs
may remain, but he did very well.

205
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,610
[We are Girl Friends!]

206
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,960
[I don't know]

207
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,260
[Passed out]

208
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,430
[Drenched in sweat]

209
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:18,040
Seeing that, it's a good thing
that BOYFRIEND is a boy band.

210
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:25,000
Another group was possessed by a girl group.
It's a good thing they're wearing masks.

211
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:38,290
All of VIXX's natural and exciting
images were shown on their show.

212
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:53,070
- You don't wear like that at home.
- You said to wear what I wear at home.

213
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:54,830
Want a beating?

214
00:40:54,830 --> 00:41:03,460
Hyuk does his duty as an idol.
Let's just turn a blind eye.

215
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,300
[You look strange too...]

216
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,220
VIXX later became the
main of the show.

217
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,530
- I can do this well.
- I don't know what to do.

218
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,670
- Ready?
- Yes...

219
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,390
He laughed.

220

[Beams]

221
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,710
[Leo beams after drawing in N's breath]

222
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,290
[Bolts up!]

223
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,640
[They're fighting]

224
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,880
[Ravi goes to stop Leo]

225
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,070
Fight! Fight!

226
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,690
["Make Leo laugh"
caused this violence]

227
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,870
It ended with fists, but their
efforts are commendable.

228
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,280
They have a comical side to them.

229
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,050
A-JAX starred in their own
UCC to advertise themselves.

230
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:48,580
They showed their acting with a
clip that went with the song title.

231
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,240
Close your books!

232
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,300
Those two rows switch!

233
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,580
This row too!

234
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,380
What?

235
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,260
Another charm is the campaign song.

236
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,160
We're A-JAX

237
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,580
I look in the mirror
(put on a sweet smile)

238
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,700
Hey, be brave today

239
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,330
What strengthens me more is

240
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,690
Milk

241
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,400
A glass of milk after ramen

242
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,250
Milk

243
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:24,180

[Traffic safety song]

246
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,950
No drunk driving or falling asleep

247
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:40,760
No cell phones while driving

248
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,510
Observe the stop line
Obey the traffic signals

249
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,630
Drive slowly in school zones

250
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:52,640
All seats must have seat belts on

251
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,850
Turn off mobile TV while driving

252
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,010
Fall asleep and be in trouble
Drunk driving? No, No

253

Refrain from using cell phones

254
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:10,060
Seems like EXO can make even
karaoke into a flashy stage.

255
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:41,280
They're still rookies in variety shows,
but I think we can look forward to it.

[Their Song and Transformation]

257
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,540
Just like their group name,
BOYFRIEND's songs continued on.

258
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:09,250
Their 3rd single "I'll Be There" is a
love song with a unique melodic rap.

259
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:33,670
[It's a pop dance song
with an electronic feel]

260

[An exciting melody and
romantic lyrics also stand out]

262
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:51,290
[The key to this song is their
group dance and melodic rap]

263
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:52,490

doing anything for the person they love.

264

person they love, and it shows their colors]

268
00:46:46,670 --> 00:47:03,050
[They drew attention with various looks such as unique
pastel suits with floral patterns and street fashion]

269
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,040
BOYFRIEND completely changed.

270
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,370
"JANUS" is the title track of their
first full-length album.

271
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,900
They completely transformed
like the title of the song.

272
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,520
We can see how they grew
up into men from boys.

273
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:43,550
[It's a fancy and lyrical
new wave pop song]

274

who happily lets go of a woman but is sad]

A-JAX also transformed.

280
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,900
"Hot Game" is their 2nd single
with a club music rhythm.

281
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:09,000
They presented a stage unique to rookies
casting aside their heavy debut image.

282
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:43,470
[The rhythmical and melodic harmony
goes exquisitely with the club rhythm]

[They debuted with a strong warrior image
but transformed to an image fit for summer]

285
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:07,590
A-JAX then returned as
a bad ex-boyfriend.

286
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:13,910
"2MYX" is about a "bad guy" who
threw a blow at his ex-girlfriend.

287
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:21,950
It's nostalgic of late 1990s boy band
and their performance also drew attention.

288
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,650
[A pop dance song with passionate beats
and an intense and catchy melody]

289
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:12,980
[Like their concept of returning to 1990s boy band,
the retro and modern feelings went well together]

US boy bands, took part in composing]

in common with "Run Devil Run"]

294
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:19,880
They paid homage to Michael Jackson by
doing the moonwalk and such in their color.

295
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,000
VIXX's 2nd single dreaming of being
super heroes is "Rock Ur Body."

296
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,550
Like the lyrics comparing love to a video game,
it's a dance song with an exciting melody.

297
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:46,570
The pixel art and sound effects reminiscent
of video games at that time were memorable.

298
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:46,950
[The 8-bit sound effects of retro games and
exciting guitar riff in the intro were memorable]

299

[Going through with the retro concept of the album,
they stressed on pixel art completing their style]

301
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:55,070
SISTAR's Dasom, family to BOYFRIEND,
came to support these guys now.

302

[Formed a group for 20-year-olds]

304
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:37,420
VIXX created their color with an
exciting dance song after their debut.

305
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:42,760
But they chose to completely
transform in their next album.

306
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:49,120
They became vampires. It's a synth pop
with intense electric guitar sounds.

307
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,050
"I'm Ready to Get Hurt"
is their 3rd single.

308
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:59,020
These rookies were ready to transform
and their visuals were truly amazing.

309
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:50,470
[It's a synth pop with intense
electric guitar sounds]

310
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:59,540
[The intense sounds contrasted the sad lyrics of
a woman who hurts him even though he loves her]

311
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:08,430
[They showed off their sexy masculinity with
shocking visuals apart from their existing image]

312
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:40,930
They put on colored contacts for the
intense eyes and shocking makeup.

313
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:45,150
Their styling contributed to their
transformation into vampires.

314
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:59,510
They left a strong impression with this
song as a group making a great impact.

315
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:10,730
EXO made fans to wait making them say,
"EXO isn't making a comeback."

316
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:17,690
Compared to the others, they didn't
release another song since "Mama."

317
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:21,820
The wait finally ended in 2013.

01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:07,920
[The moves describing the wolf's cave and tree,
and the transformation into wolf boys...]

326
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,250
[Were a sophisticated performance
reminding one of a musical]

327
01:05:55,650 --> 01:06:00,500
EXO transformed into wolf boys after
falling in love with a pretty girl.

328
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:07,870
They had a special performance to go with
the song that collaborates dubstep with hip-hop.

329
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,320
What are those?

330
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:33,400
They're name tags we use
during rehearsals.

331
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,390
[Name tag?]

332
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:42,320
Since we're rookies and there are 12 of us,
it's for the staff to know our names.

333
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:46,340
It takes a long time to read them
since they're a big group.

334
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:49,100
But it's great to know their names.

335
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,140
Now I know who's who.

336
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:59,020
Together with their comeback, EXO swept
music programs by taking 1st with "Wolf."

337
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:04,240
They became hot rookies
after a year since their debut.

338
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,740
Thank you for this award.

339
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:13,380
[It's a dance song based on
refined Urban R&B sounds]

340
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:19,030
[The feeling of not wanting to lose a
woman one loves to another man is...]

341
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:24,590
[Described in a fun way with a growl]

342
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:30,080
[World-renowned choreographer Nick Bass
was in charge of their choreography]

343
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:41,280
[The performance was dynamic and touching
on a grand scale with all 12 members]

344
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:46,870
[Their music video that was shot once
on a steadicam also garnered attention]

345
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:25,730
EXO seized the music charts in Asia and
rose as the most frightening rookies in k-pop.

346
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:34,590
We cheer their remarkable growth as heroes
and their stage that makes any place heavenly.

347
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:42,540
VIXX presented "Hyde" from their
1st mini-album a year after their debut.

348
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:45,810
Their concept after vampires
was Jekyll and Hyde.

349
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:52,470
They showed the contrasting sides of man
who was hurt by love and became a devil.

350
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:40,160
[The magnificent introduction and
tense development were memorable]

351
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,490
[The concept of Jekyll and Hyde
was used to portray...]

352
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:48,850
[A man's psyche that turned evil
after being hurt by love]

353
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:53,080
[An image of angels and devils
were portrayed with...]

354
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:57,420
[Smokey makeup, achromatic-colored clothes,
and a performance stressing their concept]

355
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:01,790
[They were successful in another
intense transformation]

356
01:15:56,790 --> 01:16:02,620
They transformed again with "G.R.8.U."

357
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:07,840
Since the release of the teaser, it drew
attention with the unprecedented title.

358
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:41,650
[The fresh sounding guitar riff goes
well with the powerful synth sounds]

359
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:46,360
[They presented a clear and cool
melody that goes well with summer]

360
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:50,940
[Even before its release, online searches
were done due to the unique title]

361
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:55,620
[They took off their strong makeup
and revealed their pure charms]

362
01:16:55,620 --> 01:17:00,250
[Their leader, N, took part in
creating exciting key moves]

363
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:52,170
VIXX were rookies in the spotlight but
grew up into a group with their own colors.

364
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:55,620
We look forward to their
ever-evolving stages.

365
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:04,180
BOYFRIEND's strong transformation
continued with "I Yah," an intense dance song.

366
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:09,950
Hmm? I'm hearing this title again.
It's very familiar to me.

367
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:17,540
There was a song with the same title
14 years ago. Thus it caught my eyes.

368
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:53,410
[This song presents a powerful
and masculine voice and rap]

369
01:19:53,410 --> 01:20:02,320
[With a daring desire to conquer one's lover,
they transformed into romantic machos]

370
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,740
[The title track of H.O.T.'s 4th album
released in 1999 had the same title]

371
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:15,750
[It's been 14 years, but this
song has a different feel]

372
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:58,970
Just like H.O.T.'s "I Yah" that
they heard in their school days...

373
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:03,100
BOYFRIEND wants their "I Yah"
to be known far and wide.

374
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:09,810
We'll observe their songs that
are being heard here and there.

375
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,350
A-JAX returned after 7 months
with their 2nd mini-album.

376
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,350
"Insane" is the title track and
a hybrid electronic song.

377
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:27,410
They learned singing and dancing again
from the basics and honed their skills.

378
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:31,790
They presented a stage that is more
matured internally and externally.

379
01:23:57,050 --> 01:24:05,510
[The nonstop intense and fancy
synth sound is leading the song]

380
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:13,570
[This is their first attempt on an original
electronic dance number since their debut]

381
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:17,610
[It expresses a man's heart that
has fallen for a certain woman]

382
01:24:17,610 --> 01:24:25,670
[They expressed a new change in their
music with "insane" as the subtitle]

383
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:10,480
Like the lyrics of a man
falling for a certain woman...

384
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:16,925
We hope they become shining k-pop heroes via
their song and stage to make people fall for them.

385
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:34,975
