00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:24,285
we took about
18 or 19 German prisoners.

4
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:32,087
A young man approximately
24 years of age turned to me,

5
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:38,607
and in a voice completely accent-free,

6
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:45,127
he said, "Where are you from?"

7
00:01:45,127 --> 00:01:48,247
I said, "I'm from the United States."

8
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:50,887
"Where in the United States?"

9
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:52,887
"The north-east," I said.

10
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:55,087
"Where north-east?"

11
00:01:55,087 --> 00:01:57,767
I said, "I'm from Connecticut."

12
00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:01,447
"Where in Connecticut?"
He was persisting.

13
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:06,367
I said, "Yes, I'm from
Waterbury, Connecticut."

14
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:09,487
"Ah, yes," he said. "Waterbury.

15
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:15,007
"At the junction
of the Naugatuck and Mad rivers."

16
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:18,527
Now, you have to know
a bit about the area.

17
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:21,327
The Naugatuck is
a fairly substantial river,

18
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:24,287
but the Mad River is a little stream

19
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:27,167
that you can jump across
without any trouble.

20
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:32,767
Anyone who knew this, um...
I was puzzled.

21
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:35,567
I said, "How did you possibly know that?"

22
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:43,247
He said, "I was in training
for the administration."

23
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,567
"The administration of what?" I said.

24
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:51,127
He said, "The administration
of the territories."

25
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:55,607
My blood ran cold.

26
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:59,767
I couldn't imagine that Hitler,

27
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:02,367
in his wildest imagination,

28
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:09,327
not only had figured
he practically had Europe in his grasp,

29
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:14,959
but he also figured that
he would control America too.

30
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:34,207
NARRATOR: By December of 1944,

31
00:03:34,207 --> 00:03:36,607
Americans were growing weary
of the war

32
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:40,807
their young men had been fighting
for three long years.

33
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:45,927
In Europe, it was supposed
to be over by now.

34
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:51,127
The generals who had directed
the fighting from far behind the lines

35
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:54,567
had been predicting victory for months.

36
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,327
It had not happened.

37
00:03:57,327 --> 00:04:03,487
In the Pacific, American progress
had been slow and costly.

38
00:04:03,487 --> 00:04:06,001
The enemy showed no sign of giving up.

39
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:12,687
For the people of Luverne, Minnesota
and Waterbury, Connecticut,

40
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:16,287
Sacramento, California
and Mobile, Alabama,

41
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:19,447
and every other town
struggling to absorb it all,

42
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:23,167
the stream of telegrams
and newspaper headlines

43
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,247
telling of new losses

44
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:29,445
seemed endless and unendurable.

45
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:40,967
For their sons overseas
it was, of course, far worse.

46
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,958
(EXPLOSIONS, GUNFIRE)

47
00:04:44,607 --> 00:04:50,955
For them, there was no option
but to fight on and try to stay alive.

48
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:57,247
Ray Leopold,
a mortgage broker from Waterbury,

49
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:59,687
who had been trained to kill people,

50
00:04:59,687 --> 00:05:03,767
would find himself
trying to save them instead.

51
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,367
Glenn Frazier, from Alabama,

52
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:09,967
who had been a prisoner of war
for more than two years,

53
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:14,607
would begin to lose hope
of ever seeing his home again.

54
00:05:14,607 --> 00:05:19,727
And Burnett Miller, the only child
of a prosperous Sacramento family,

55
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:24,047
would be caught up in the biggest
and least expected battle

56
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:25,526
on the western front.

57
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:50,087
MAN: Basically, getting shot at
or shelled is just plain scary.

58
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:53,159
You just hope that it misses you.

59
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:02,487
When the artillery's coming in,
you think, "Oh, God.

60
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,767
"It's covering such an area
and I hope it doesn't hit me."

61
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:11,287
We would wish they'd
just start using rifles, you know?

62
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:15,724
Well, when you get to where
a bullet whizzes by your head...

63
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,367
...you know that's personal. (Laughs)

64
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:24,246
You know?
You better get out of the way.

65
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:31,927
Since the summer of 1944,

66
00:06:31,927 --> 00:06:35,647
Hitler had been secretly planning
a massive counterattack,

67
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:39,527
an all-out attempt to divide
and destroy the Allied armies

68
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:43,047
before they could move further
into Germany.

69
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:46,967
His target would be the Ardennes -

70
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:49,807
rolling, forested hills
in Belgium and Luxembourg

71
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:53,927
through which German troops had
advanced toward France twice before,

72
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:58,887
in 1914 and again in 1940.

73
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:02,687
It was now thinly defended.

74
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:05,687
His armies were to break through
the unsuspecting Americans,

75
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:07,607
race for Antwerp,

76
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:12,237
cut off the British Army in the north
and drive it into the sea.

77
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:18,047
Most of Hitler's commanders
thought it madness.

78
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:22,127
They had lost nearly 4 million men
since the war began.

79
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:27,647
They had too little fuel
for a major mechanised advance.

80
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:32,447
The once mighty Luftwaffe
had largely been destroyed.

81
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:35,287
But Hitler was implacable.

82
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:40,042
"The coming battle", he said, "would
decide whether we shall live or die."

83
00:07:44,207 --> 00:07:49,047
Every able-bodied German male
between the ages of 16 and 60

84
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:52,247
was made eligible for service.

85
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:57,367
25 new divisions called
the People's Infantry were formed.

86
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,607
250,000 fresh troops -

87
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:05,167
convicts and the infirm,
old men and young boys,

88
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:10,247
and conscripts from occupied countries
who didn't speak a word of German.

89
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:16,087
Preparations for the attack would
take time and demanded utter secrecy.

90
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:19,287
Hitler would not launch it
until he was certain

91
00:08:19,287 --> 00:08:25,407
winter weather and dense fog
would keep Allied aircraft on the ground.

92
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:30,847
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Tom Galloway,
of Mobile, and his division

93
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,847
were among the American troops

94
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:35,967
who happened to be stationed
in the Ardennes.

95
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:40,407
GALLOWAY: We were in Luxembourg,
rebuilding after Hurtgen Forest,

96
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:43,607
because the losses were kind of heavy.

97
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:49,687
There, like, we had a front - the division
had a front of some 20 miles.

98
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:53,487
Well, because it was a quiet area
and nothing was going to happen,

99
00:08:53,487 --> 00:08:55,607
I fired 25 rounds a day.

100
00:08:55,607 --> 00:09:01,487
I'd go up in the morning
and fire just one at the time...

(ARTILLERY FIRES)

102
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:05,276
...just to let them know we were there.

103
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:17,567
There were only four
US infantry divisions in the Ardennes -

104
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,327
80,000 men stretched out along a front

105
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,767
that ran some 80 miles
from north to south.

106
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:28,447
Two of the divisions
had seen little combat.

107
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:32,207
The other two -
the 4th and Galloway's 28th -

108
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:36,487
had been battered by weeks of
desperate fighting in the Hurtgen Forest

109
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:40,447
and had been sent to the Ardennes
to rest.

110
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:45,087
Ray Leopold, of Waterbury,
was serving with the 28th too.

111
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:47,767
He had been trained as a sniper.

112
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:53,047
LEOPOLD: We were in a place
called Malmedy-St Vith,

113
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:58,087
at a little place called Sevenig Hill.

114
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:03,407
You could put one foot in France, one
foot in Belgium, and spit into Germany

115
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:05,127
at this particular spot.

116
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:09,687
One frosty morning,
after several hours of guard duty,

117
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:13,567
Leopold stood up to stretch.

118
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,367

in the left thigh.

120
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:20,207
As chance would have it,

121
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:25,007
I had picked up a German medic's kit
a couple of days before,

122
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:27,407
lying in the field,

123
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:30,967
and I doctored my own wound

124
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:35,767
because our own medic had been killed.

125
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:41,807
And with the German equipment,
I probed for the bullet.

126
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,967
I extracted it. I cleansed the wound.

127
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,720
I doctored it myself.

the captain looked at the wound and
said, "This is wonderful. Who did it?"

130

I told him that I had.

131

He then told me, "Leopold,
I have a proposition for you.

For the most part, the war seemed
a long way away from the Ardennes,

and the men took full advantage
of the facilities for rest and recreation.

00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:41,961
And, of course,
the Bulge broke right there.

173
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:51,283
And, as I say, when they fired
the first round, it darn near hit me.

174
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:56,243
From then on, it got worse.

175
00:14:57,687 --> 00:15:02,087
But they came barrelling over there,

176
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:06,842
and just right into us.

177
00:15:16,967 --> 00:15:21,407
20 German infantry divisions were
moving forward along a 50-mile front -

178
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,602
a quarter of a million men.

179
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:27,881
Behind them roared 600 tanks.

180
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:40,167
On the adjoining ridge,
which was only a half-mile from us,

181
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:45,127
sitting up as bold as brass,

182
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:49,287
several German tanks in line,

183
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:53,287
with the driver sitting
in his black uniform,

184
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:57,487
were coming down paths
that could not, in our opinion,

185
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:59,887
possibly have taken a tank.

186
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:01,367
Footpaths.

187
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:03,287
But there it was.

188
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:07,607
These gigantic tanks,
with their 88mm guns,

189
00:16:07,607 --> 00:16:11,964
were coming down this path
in single file.

190
00:16:37,407 --> 00:16:41,567
GALLOWAY: You just had waves
of Germans coming at you.

191
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:46,967
We had one machine gun
just mowing them down.

192
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:51,407
They'd keep coming right down the road,
right into that machine gun.

193
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:53,716
But there were waves of them.

194
00:16:59,007 --> 00:17:01,127
The Germans kept coming
at the Americans,

195
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:04,005
pushing them back
or flowing around them.

196
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:12,607
As Hitler had hoped,
thick clouds and ground fog

197
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:15,246
kept Allied warplanes out of the sky.

198
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:22,362
Some men simply fled.

199
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:28,647
Surrounded by the enemy,
cut off from one another,

200
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,487
out of ammunition
and unable to fight back,

201
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:37,676
others were forced to surrender -
more than 10,000 men.

202
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:50,565
Most struggled to hold on.

203
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:58,767
Clerks and truck drivers
who had never fired a carbine

204
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:01,201
found themselves in combat.

205
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:05,847
Some officers acted like traffic cops,

206
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:11,558
trying to restore order to the chaos
on the clogged roads.

207
00:18:22,647 --> 00:18:29,927
GALLOWAY: At one point, I'm there
and I'm trying to figure out tactics.

208
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:35,207
And to be perfectly honest, I figured,
as a junior officer in the artillery,

209
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:40,687
I'd be a forward observer and I didn't
have to worry about tactics too much.

210
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,847
As it ended up, here I am in charge,

211
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:45,287
and trying to say,
"Why did you sleep through tactics?"

212
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:47,118
And... (Chuckles)... it makes you think.

213
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:53,367
The Germans continued to advance.

214
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:56,287
On December 17,

215
00:18:56,287 --> 00:18:59,247
an SS panzer unit
ambushed an American convoy

216
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:02,207
near a tiny village called Malmedy,

217
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:06,407
captured and disarmed 150 men,

218
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:11,401
and then gunned down
at least 86 of them.

219
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:23,799
They also butchered
scores of Belgian civilians.

220
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:33,842
News of the killing spread fast
among the embattled Americans.

221
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:40,647
LEOPOLD: Archie Costran was
the first sergeant of our outfit.

222
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:44,447
Came up to me within the hour

223
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:48,687
with word of what had happened
at the Malmedy massacre

224
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,316
only two miles away from us.

225
00:19:54,007 --> 00:20:00,287
He said, "If you are captured
and identified as Jewish,

226
00:20:00,287 --> 00:20:03,165
"you will not live."

227
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:10,087
He said, "Ray, why don't you
do what I'm doing?

228
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:14,247
"Take your dog tags,
with its big letter 'H' on it,

229
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:20,647
"wrap it around your hand,
put your glove back on.

230
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:25,047
"Lf, by chance, you're ever
forced to surrender," he said,

231
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:31,527
"as you raise your hand, throw the glove,
together with the dog tag,

232
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:33,757
"into the snow and step on it."

233
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:42,356
For 12 days, my hand had
the dog tag wrapped around it.

234
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:52,007
The Germans succeeded
in smashing through the centre

235
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:55,887
and spreading out to create
a 50-mile salient,

236
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:00,007
a bulge in the Allied line.

237
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:03,327
The Americans managed to keep
the breakthrough from widening

238
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:05,527
by holding on to two villages -

239
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:10,367
St Vith to the north
and Bastogne in the south.

240
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:14,360
GALLOWAY:
The unit tightened up, and we held.

241
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:21,047
Until - we had about a day, two days -

242
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,207
and then we had to start dropping back.

243
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:26,483
So we'd drop back and fire,
drop back and fire.

244
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:30,887
At that time I didn't know it,

245
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:34,357
but apparently we were
trying to protect Bastogne.

246
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:42,487
I had never heard of Bastogne,
I didn't know there was such a place,

247
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:47,527
but we were trying to protect Bastogne.

248
00:21:47,527 --> 00:21:52,007
The little town commanded
seven all-weather roads.

249
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:55,207
Keeping the Germans
from gaining control of those roads

250
00:21:55,207 --> 00:21:59,127
was now the Allies' highest priority.

251
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:04,360
I was asked to go out and ride recon,
and that was a mistake.

252
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:11,007
And I reported that
German tanks were coming.

253
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:14,527
And I could hear them speaking,
"Sprechen Sie Deutsch?"

254
00:22:14,527 --> 00:22:17,687
So I had to back up.

255
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:20,327
But it was too late.

256
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:23,364
Tom Galloway and his men
were surrounded.

257
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:27,087
They hid in a house.

258
00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:32,600
They brought a tank up,
shot that house up pretty bad.

259
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:41,087
Left with no other option,
Galloway surrendered.

260
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:43,527
Well, you never think
you're going to get caught.

261
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:46,087
You think,
"It's not going to happen to me."

262
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:50,287
He and some of his fellow captives
were sent deep inside Germany

263
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:54,075
to a prison camp
40 miles east of Frankfurt.

264
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:01,327
Meanwhile, the 101 st Airborne
was ordered to hold Bastogne

265
00:23:01,327 --> 00:23:05,207
until other reinforcements
could reach the Ardennes.

266
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:09,007
While elements of the First Army
drove south toward the forest,

267
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:13,247
General George Patton's Third Army
began a headlong rush north

268
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:17,843
to try to relieve Bastogne
before the enemy could take it.

269
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:25,479
The Germans encircled the town
and began to shell it.

270
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:48,647
The surrounded Americans

271
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:52,959
began running out
of ammunition, food, medicine.

272
00:24:06,207 --> 00:24:08,047
On December 22,

273
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,327
German officers under a white flag

274
00:24:10,327 --> 00:24:13,007
approached the American commander
at Bastogne,

275
00:24:13,007 --> 00:24:17,478
General Anthony McAuliffe
of the 101 st Airborne.

276
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:24,687
The Americans' situation was hopeless,
they said. The town was surrounded.

277
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:27,607
They demanded
the Americans surrender.

278
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:33,807
McAuliffe had
a one-word answer - "Nuts!"

279
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:38,007
The Germans had
no idea what he meant,

280
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:43,365
but they returned to their lines
and the shelling started again.

281
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:05,247
But the next morning, the skies cleared
and were quickly filled with Allied planes,

282
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:07,687
bombing and strafing German armour

283
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:12,078
and dropping supplies and ammunition
to the besieged Americans.

284
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:26,647
They were still surrounded,
still cut off from help on the ground,

285
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:32,483
but now at least they had food to eat and
ammunition with which to shoot back.

286
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:44,639
And they were fast becoming a symbol
back home of American resistance.

287
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:55,327
WOMAN: The Battle of the Bulge
was publicised.

288
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:59,247
We knew they were
holding out in Bastogne

289
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:02,687
and we were all cheering them on.

290
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:06,207
Again, we know now
how dreadful it was,

291
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:09,687
but we were very conscious
of the Battle of the Bulge,

292
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:15,327
because we felt like we had just about
completed that campaign in Europe.

293
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:21,007
And when this counterattack came,
it came as a blow to the entire nation.

294
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:23,999
('SILENT NIGHT' PLAYS)

295
00:26:30,167 --> 00:26:32,607
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT:
It is not easy to say merry Christmas

296
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:35,727
to you, my fellow Americans,

297
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:40,487
in this time of destructive war.

298
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:48,007
Nor can I say merry Christmas lightly
tonight to our armed forces

299
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:52,080
at their battle stations all over the world.

300
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:58,327
General Eisenhower,
as surprised as anyone

301
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:00,527
by the success of the German advance,

302
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:06,087
nevertheless saw the opportunity
embedded in the crisis.

303
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:11,327
The Germans were on the offensive
for the first time since Normandy,

304
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:14,327
but that meant they were exposed

305
00:27:14,327 --> 00:27:18,400
and could be themselves surrounded
and cut off.

306
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:27,207
On Christmas Day,
30 miles west of Bastogne,

307
00:27:27,207 --> 00:27:30,756
the Americans stopped
the German advance.

308
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:36,687
The following day, American tanks
broke through the German lines

309
00:27:36,687 --> 00:27:42,000
and linked up with
the 101 st Airborne inside Bastogne.

310
00:27:48,727 --> 00:27:50,967
The men there celebrated
a belated Christmas,

311
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:56,487
despite the shells and bombs
that continued to fall around them

312
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:59,081
and the fighting that lay ahead.

My dad walked me
to the main building for my siesta

339
00:30:17,727 --> 00:30:23,996
'cause the camp shut down
for three hours in the heat of the day.

340
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,927
So he stopped at the desk,

341
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:35,327
and they said, "Oh, we have
a Red Cross telegram for you."

342
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:38,647
It was from my grandmother.

343
00:30:38,647 --> 00:30:45,447
And it said my grandfather,
he had passed eight months prior,

344
00:30:45,447 --> 00:30:48,607
and we were just getting it.

345
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:51,527
He stood there and cried,

346
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:54,405
and then walked me up to my room.

347
00:30:56,687 --> 00:31:03,081
Everybody told us that my grandfather
literally died of a broken heart.

348
00:31:08,687 --> 00:31:13,687
That evening, the family did its best
to celebrate the holiday.

349
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:18,327
They made a tree out of a palm branch
stuck in a tin can filled with dirt,

350
00:31:18,327 --> 00:31:22,807
and lined up at the canteen with the
other prisoners for a special treat -

351
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:29,087
two tablespoons of jam
and one bite of chocolate.

352
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:31,607
Sascha thought it all delicious,

353
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:35,680
even though there were
tiny white worms in the chocolate.

354
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:43,327
During the night, American planes
could be heard overhead again

355
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:48,007
and scores of leaflets fluttered
out of the dark sky -

356
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:52,207
Christmas greetings from the troops
fighting their way across the Philippines

357
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:55,207
toward Manila...

358
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,277
...toward them.

359
00:32:06,807 --> 00:32:09,847
Back in the spring of 1944,

360
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:13,047
John and Glynnie Frazier,
of Fort Deposit, Alabama,

361
00:32:13,047 --> 00:32:15,845
received a telegram
from the War Department.

362
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:21,367
Their son, Glenn, had been
missing in action in the Philippines

363
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:24,567
for two agonising years,

364
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:29,247
and since nothing had been
heard from him since May of 1942,

365
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:31,966
he was now officially presumed dead.

366
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:37,327
Frazier had joined the army in 1941,

367
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:41,287
in part because he believed
that the young woman he loved

368
00:32:41,287 --> 00:32:43,278
loved someone else.

369
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:47,287
He was wrong.

370
00:32:47,287 --> 00:32:51,007
She had remained loyal to him
all that time.

371
00:32:51,007 --> 00:32:53,847
Now, with this latest news,

372
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:57,237
she began to give up hope
of ever seeing him again.

373
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:04,647
But Glenn Frazier was still alive,

374
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:07,567
a prisoner of the Japanese.

375
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:09,367
MAN: When I'd think about home,

376
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:12,047
I would think about the things
that I missed most,

377
00:33:12,047 --> 00:33:14,927
like ice-cream and potato salad

378
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:18,167
and some ambrosia that my mother
used to make for Christmas,

379
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,647
and so forth.

380
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:25,087
And of course it was always a thought
of if we would get back home,

381
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:28,327
but it got a time that we were so weak,

382
00:33:28,327 --> 00:33:32,407
it got a time with me, I was so weak
until I couldn't even remember

383
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:34,567
whether I had sisters or brothers,

384
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,487
and I couldn't even remember
their names.

385
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:39,687
And it comes to a time when you think,
"Did I have a home?

386
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:42,520
"Did I have a home?
Did I have a family?"

387
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:49,447
Frazier had come close to death
several times.

388
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:51,647
He had endured
the Bataán Death March

389
00:33:51,647 --> 00:33:54,407
and nightmarish conditions
at Camp O'Donnell

390
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,363
and Bilibid Prison in the Philippines.

391
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,447
And he had been forced to perform
slave labour

392
00:34:00,447 --> 00:34:03,367
in prison camps in Japan itself,

393
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:06,047
where he had survived
double pneumonia,

394
00:34:06,047 --> 00:34:10,767
torture, a week of isolation
in a covered pit,

395
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:13,998
and beatings so frequent
they became routine.

396
00:34:18,687 --> 00:34:23,007
Once, when he failed to lift his feet
high enough while marching,

397
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:25,521
a guard drove a bayonet into his knee.

398
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:31,807
FRAZIER: It started getting infected
and it finally got gangrene,

399
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:35,007
and the doctor,
our American doctor in there,

400
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:37,967
had nothing to treat me with
except iodine.

401
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:45,207
I would hold a cup to catch all the blood
and he cut it open with a pocketknife,

402
00:34:45,207 --> 00:34:48,607
and it would get to the point where
he would pour pure iodine in there

403
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:50,359
to cure the gangrene.

404
00:34:54,047 --> 00:34:57,327
They were thinking about
taking my leg off.

405
00:34:57,327 --> 00:35:01,366
So I told the doctor, "I'd just rather die
than have my leg taken off."

406
00:35:03,127 --> 00:35:05,083
So he fought it and we won.

407
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:10,007
At one point, there was only a space
in the back of my leg

408
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,567
about an inch and a half across

409
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:16,127
that the flesh was like normal flesh.

410
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:17,687
The rest of it was decaying.

411
00:35:17,687 --> 00:35:20,201
I could open that wound up
and see my bone.

412
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,287
Frazier's leg eventually healed

413
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:28,047
and he went back to work
on the waterfront,

414
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:30,167
where he and his friends
did all they could

415
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:32,601
to sabotage the Japanese war effort.

416
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:39,167
They risked their lives to drill holes
in the bottoms of oil barrels,

417
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,207
poured sand into gas tanks,

418
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,687
wrecked machinery,

419
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,287
destroyed a dock,

420
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:46,007
and loosened blocks

421
00:35:46,007 --> 00:35:51,639
so that a submarine under repairs
slid into the bay upside down.

422
00:35:53,967 --> 00:35:57,647
And through it all,
Frazier thought of home

423
00:35:57,647 --> 00:36:01,117
and of the girl he still hoped, somehow,
to see again.

424
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:07,607
But the thing that really kept me going
is seeing if that girl was still there

425
00:36:07,607 --> 00:36:12,327
and see if, you know, I still
in my heart was crazy about her,

426
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:14,287
and the fact that I wanted to live.

427
00:36:14,287 --> 00:36:18,247
I did not want my body
pushing up Japanese daisies.

428
00:36:18,247 --> 00:36:20,727
And I just felt that way,

429
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:24,197
and I thought, "They're going to have
a heck of a time getting me in a casket."

430
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:34,607
MAN: I became a 'Sacramento Bee'
news carrier at the age of 10,

431
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:40,607
and for me, the war was that
little square map on the front page

432
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:45,967
where it showed wavy lines
moving in some direction,

433
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:49,287
and then the next day you'd see them
move a little more,

434
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:55,007
and arrows pointed here and there
where different armies were going.

435
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:59,607
And then, all of a sudden,
there was this bulge in the map

436
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:01,287
that was going back the other way.

437
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,487
That was the Battle of the Bulge.

438
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,607
And, "My God, what's happening here?

439
00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:07,847
"Are we losing
now that we're this close?"

440
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:14,320
We all took it seriously, because
the lines had moved the other way.

441
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:20,798
(DISTANT SHOUTING, EXPLOSIONS)

442
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:46,007
MAN: "This is being written
on the verge of the new year,

443
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:51,807
"when all along the western front
the outcome still remains in doubt.

444
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:54,727
"When German parachutists
were known

445
00:37:54,727 --> 00:37:57,367

American lines

446

"dressed in American uniforms,

447
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:05,167
"it became necessary to demand
identification papers from everybody.

448
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:09,847
"But with coloured troops,
it was only a matter of form,

449
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:13,887
"since the Germans have

"but my face was my best identification."

452
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:27,279
Ollie Stewart,
the 'Baltimore Afro-American'.

453
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:53,442
MAN: I think that we went
to have a great experience.

454
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:58,087
And all of a sudden we were having
more of a great experience

455
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:00,007
than we really had reckoned for.

456
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,647
We were scared to death, of course.

457
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:05,527
Burnett Miller, of Sacramento,

458
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:09,007
who had been raised a few blocks
from where Burt Wilson lived,

459
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:12,287
was a private in the
21 st Armoured Infantry Battalion,

460
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:14,407
11th Armoured Division.

461
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:17,167
He was among the thousands
of American troops

462
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,207
ordered into the Ardennes

463
00:39:19,207 --> 00:39:24,047
to relieve Bastogne
and drive the Germans back.

464
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:27,926
It would be Miller's first real taste of war.

465
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:33,807
We crossed France,
went through parts of Belgium

466
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:38,727
and hit the Bulge in a big snowstorm.

467
00:39:38,727 --> 00:39:41,560
Our vehicles became almost inoperable.

468
00:39:56,767 --> 00:40:00,767
And the tanks, one after another,
were blown up

469
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:04,047
and we could see dead tankers
and wounded tankers

470
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:07,487
running for cover all over the place.

471
00:40:07,487 --> 00:40:10,479
That was not a pretty sight.

472
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:16,847
We baled out of these tracks
and started running through the snow

473
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:20,078
to get some kind of coverage...

474
00:40:21,647 --> 00:40:25,647
...and actually retreated
back up onto a hill,

475
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:32,405
dug in, and spent that night
in a big snowstorm.

476
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:40,279
We were wet, and I thought,
"Boy, I don't think we can make it."

477
00:40:42,287 --> 00:40:47,287
And that night there were
tracer bullets all over, lots of artillery -

478
00:40:47,287 --> 00:40:49,403
very, very scary.

479
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,847
And you'd rationalise things,

480
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:56,919
like, "Nothing worse can happen
but getting killed."

481
00:40:59,447 --> 00:41:04,646
But there were things worse
than being killed.

482
00:41:19,287 --> 00:41:24,967
In the Ardennes,
the fighting and the dying went on.

483
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:30,167
It was the coldest winter in memory.

484
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:34,240
Many men were without
winter boots or winter coats.

485
00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:41,795
Thousands lost fingers, toes or feet
to frostbite.

486
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:55,047
MILLER: Lots of our equipment
wasn't very good.

487
00:41:55,047 --> 00:42:02,807
We always had frozen feet because
our shoes were really very, very poor.

488
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:08,567
Also, you know,
we went into combat in the Bulge

489
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:12,127
in the same overcoats
we went to London in,

490
00:42:12,127 --> 00:42:16,847
and they were big, bulky,
miserable things that would get wet.

491
00:42:16,847 --> 00:42:23,195
And pretty soon we were looking
for German prisoners or German dead.

492
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:31,007
They had nice, white, bunny-fur jackets
that were just terrific -

493
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:36,001
not only comfortable and warm,
but were white and camouflaged.

494
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:43,642
MAN: Morale, I thought,
kept up because you were with people.

495
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:55,047
That as long as you were with other Gls
in the snow and in the misery,

496
00:42:55,047 --> 00:42:56,727
if you had somebody next to you,

497
00:42:56,727 --> 00:42:59,036
you figured, "Well, they can handle it,
I can handle it."

498
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:04,720
You just keep moving ahead.

499
00:43:34,207 --> 00:43:39,486
In the chaotic fighting that followed,
some towns changed hands four times.

500
00:43:41,727 --> 00:43:45,959
Civilians hid in cellars as their homes
were destroyed above them.

501
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:54,887
Allied troops had to recapture the ground
they had lost inch by frozen inch,

502
00:43:54,887 --> 00:43:56,687
sometimes reoccupying foxholes

503
00:43:56,687 --> 00:44:00,236
they'd been forced from
just a few weeks earlier.

504
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:33,116
The Americans lost an average
of 1,600 men a day.

505
00:44:34,847 --> 00:44:39,807
Among the dead were
Private John Tavera, of Sacramento,

506
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,767
Corporal Lester Bendt, of Luverne,

507
00:44:41,767 --> 00:44:46,207
Private First Class Domenic Derosimo,
of Waterbury,

508
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:51,281
and Private First Class
Jesse Leon Hattenstein, of Mobile.

509
00:44:59,207 --> 00:45:02,007
Those who were killed and wounded
were replaced

510
00:45:02,007 --> 00:45:06,327
by thousands of green troops,
mostly high school boys,

511
00:45:06,327 --> 00:45:09,285
who had been rushed through
basic training.

512
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:24,327
Many replacements died
before officers could learn their names

513
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:29,037
and were replaced
by still more frightened newcomers.

514
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:36,767
KATHARINE PHILLIPS:
I had a friend who claimed

515
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:42,478
he was sent into the Battle of the Bulge
with six weeks training and a new rifle.

516
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:48,767
He said if he had not been
shooting squirrels all his life,

517
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:53,287
he would have been completely lost.

518
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:58,441
But he shot the Germans like he would
squirrels, and that was it. (Chuckles)

519
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:05,127
Some officers ordered their men
to take no German prisoners.

520
00:46:05,127 --> 00:46:09,967
The memory of the massacre
of American troops at Malmedy

521
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,446
remained fresh.

522
00:46:16,647 --> 00:46:20,847
MILLER: We had been held up
at a little town.

523
00:46:20,847 --> 00:46:23,007
We were supposed
to just walk through it,

524
00:46:23,007 --> 00:46:25,447
and the Germans stopped us dead.

525
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:27,119
We just couldn't crack it.

526
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:31,439
Eventually, artillery came in.

527
00:46:32,807 --> 00:46:34,843
Sort of levelled the houses.

528
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:42,367
They finally surrendered,
and they came out and sort of lined up,

529
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:45,404
and per usual,
no-one knew what was going on.

530
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:54,127
We had a new battalion commander,
just graduated from West Point,

531
00:46:54,127 --> 00:46:59,967
and he lined them up and said,
"I want you to shoot 'em."

532
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:02,087
And I was horrified.

533
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:04,967
Quite a few of us were horrified.

534
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:07,567
And I went to him and told him,
you know,

535
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:11,526
that this was against
all international law and humanity.

536
00:47:12,887 --> 00:47:17,607
My good buddy,
who I'd spent so much time with,

537
00:47:17,607 --> 00:47:20,007
grabbed me and said,
"This nut will shoot you.

538
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:22,167
"You'd better quit. Knock this off."

539
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:27,446
And he got enough guys and they
shot these... about 25 prisoners.

540
00:47:29,567 --> 00:47:32,167
It was a terrible thing to see,

541
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:37,767
and I talked to a lot of my buddies
who had shot these guys

542
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:40,565
and they were horrified too.

543
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:05,767
By January 30, 1945,

544
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:09,127
six weeks after the German offensive
in the Ardennes began,

545
00:48:09,127 --> 00:48:12,967
six weeks after the start
of the Battle of the Bulge,

546
00:48:12,967 --> 00:48:18,678
the Allies had finally managed to regain
all the ground they'd lost.

547
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:31,207
It had been the biggest battle of the war
on the western front.

548
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:34,447
More than a million men took part.

549
00:48:34,447 --> 00:48:38,407
19,000 Americans died.

550
00:48:38,407 --> 00:48:43,959
60,000 more had been wounded
or captured or listed as missing.

551
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:51,567
Hitler's enormous gamble
had ended in disaster.

552
00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:58,367
He had lost some 100,000 men
and virtually all his tanks and aircraft,

553
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:02,440
and now had no way of replacing them.

554
00:49:11,527 --> 00:49:13,207
And in the east,

555
00:49:13,207 --> 00:49:18,327
the Russian army was blasting its way
closer to Berlin every day.

556
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:34,047
LEOPOLD: They had blown up
our chow truck.

557
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:39,807
So these big aluminum cans that
contained the variety of food they had

558
00:49:39,807 --> 00:49:43,527
were spaced about 40, 50 feet apart.

559
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:47,447
If a shell came in,
it would only kill one or two men

560
00:49:47,447 --> 00:49:53,007
instead of groups of us
if we were all blocked together.

561
00:49:53,007 --> 00:49:59,127
We walked down the line slowly
and opened up our mess kits.

562
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:02,247
And in the big pan of your mess kit,

563
00:50:02,247 --> 00:50:06,047
the first man placed two pieces of toast.

564
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:10,007
The second man put a nice
half-inch-thick piece

565
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:15,767
of magnificent roast beef,
covering most of the toast.

566
00:50:15,767 --> 00:50:20,407
The third man, a ladle of gravy
over all of it. Everything was fine.

567
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:23,967
The next man gave us a scoopful

568
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:28,967
of reconstituted dried peas and carrots.

569
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:33,207
It was proper. It was good.
It was on one side.

570
00:50:33,207 --> 00:50:36,407
And finally we came
to the end of the line.

571
00:50:36,407 --> 00:50:39,407
And the end of the line,
the man reached in

572
00:50:39,407 --> 00:50:42,607
and took a great big scoop
of chocolate pudding

573
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:46,887
and covered this magnificent roast beef
from one side to the other

574
00:50:46,887 --> 00:50:49,127
with chocolate pudding.

575
00:50:49,127 --> 00:50:53,127
I don't know how many of you have
ever had chocolate pudding roast beef,

576
00:50:53,127 --> 00:50:55,927
but I can tell you, despite this fact -

577
00:50:55,927 --> 00:51:01,287
despite the insult that must have come
to this beautiful piece of meat -

578
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:03,407
we loved every single bite.

579
00:51:03,407 --> 00:51:07,719
I still remember
chocolate-flavoured roast beef.
