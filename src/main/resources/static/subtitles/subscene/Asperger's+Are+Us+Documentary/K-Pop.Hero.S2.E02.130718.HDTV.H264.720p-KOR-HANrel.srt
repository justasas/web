1
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,380
Let's reminisce the
special times he had.

2
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,160
[Kim Hyun-joong's Story]

3
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,130
Kim Hyun-joong debuted in 2005
as the leader of SS501.

4
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,920
He shined on stage with his
good looks as a flower boy...

5
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,800
And became the center of
many of his fans' attention.

6
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,750
This flower boy rose to sudden prominence in
the gayo world, but he has an unusual past.

7
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,260
I never received allowances.

8
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,880
I worked for money ever
since I was young.

9
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,840
I delivered newspapers, pizza, and chicken,
and worked as a waiter. I worked hard.

10
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,970
- I didn't go to school.
- Since when?

11
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,950
I started chicken delivery
when I was in the 8th grade.

12
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,930
I got a raise around $2.50
because I did well.

13
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,670
- How much did you start at?
- I started at around $1.70.

14
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,310
- How much did you make?
- I made close to $100,000.

15
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,990
- By working part-time?
- I didn't go to school.

16
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,980
It was like a full-time job, but
how did you make $100,000?

17
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,040
- I didn't spend money...
- You didn't spend money?

18
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,590
I saved it up for a
couple of years...

19
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,480
I heard you made money
by starting a business.

20
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,110
There are those I worked with since
elementary, and we're still friends.

21
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:21,760
We said if any one of us becomes successful,
that person will start a chicken restaurant.

22
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,640
So I started one. It's doing
well and I made some cash.

23
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,620
- You own a chicken restaurant?
- You still manage it?

24
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,340
We never knew.

25
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,190
- I just found out today.
- Me too. What a surprise.

26
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:45,000
My friend recently wrote an
ad copy. He's an eccentric guy.

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,720
I asked what he was doing and he wrote
something strange on the flyer.

28
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,710
"If it doesn't taste good
then I'm your kid."

29
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,430
That's incredible!

30
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,090
So you...

31
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:10,950
Usually it would say "give a refund."
First time hearing something provocative.

32
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:21,400
We said if any one of us succeeds,
and I was the one to keep that promise.

33
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:27,450
We would think he grew without hardships,
but there's more to his sad past.

34
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,450
I ran away from home.

35
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,190
How old were you?

36
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,630
It's when I just
entered high school.

37
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,700
It's when Seo Taiji released
a song titled "Ultramania."

38
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,090
It drew out my defiance.

39
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,920
- Ultramania?
- I became one.

40
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,360
I ran away saying that
I'm sticking to music.

41
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,480
"School or music?" "Music. I'll make
money on my own and live well off."

42
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,850
But I was cold and hungry.
I almost died 3 times.

43
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,280
[Almost died 3 times?]

44
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,340
I ran away and ran out of money.
I thought I would die of starvation.

45
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,570
My friend told me to stay at his place,
but he was living with his father.

46
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,520
His father told me to get out saying that
he can't accept someone who ran away.

47
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,870
My friend allowed me to sleep in the
boiler room which was a storehouse.

48
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:38,490
I was hungry and was searching the
ground for food if there was any.

49
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:44,250
I went down, but the roads were twisted
and I couldn't find my way back.

50
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,880
I discovered a snack shop at 4 AM.

51
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,310
My first thought was
to eat and survive.

52
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:01,330
I ordered a lot of tteokbokki, odeng,
sundae, and twigim, and ate it all.

53
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,240
You ate first?

54
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,910
I felt the Heavens were on my side.

55
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,590
That shop doesn't do deliveries
but got a call for a delivery.

56
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,960
- At that moment?
- Yes.

57
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,390
The person who called always
ordered from that shop.

58
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:25,400
She said, "I'll make the delivery."
I thought, "I should run for it."

59
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,630
- I intentionally made another order.
- So she can go on the delivery?

60
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,130
She needs time to cook the ramen.

61
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:38,360
I ate a little and ran away at the same time
she left while grabbing some twigim.

62
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,790
[Better safe than sorry!]

63
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:45,090
- You grabbed some on the way?
- He needs something for tomorrow.

64
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:53,040
I ran about a mile through the alley and
entered a boiler room in a building.

65
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,480
But it was a boiler room of
a big Korean dry sauna.

66
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,520
- It must have been hot.
- It was really hot.

67
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:09,940
There's a ladder there. I climbed up
and opened the lid to the sauna.

68
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,030
I already ate the food.

69
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:21,210
I opened the lid of that underground
bunker and there were people walking.

70
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,720
- You found a passage.
- I thought I should stay here.

71
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:34,720
First, I took a hot shower, and used
someone else's disposable shaver.

72
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,060
Look at the things this
flower boy did.

73
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:44,460
I was caught the next morning and
was kicked out. So I almost died.

74
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,820
You almost died because you
were beaten to death?

75
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,650
- No, I almost starved to death.
- Nothing to eat after being kicked out.

76
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,410
Another time, I was almost
beaten to death.

77
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:02,250
My friend pitied me and bought me a bowl
of pork bone stew. I ate and left, but...

78
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,700
That alley was full of tattooed men.

79
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:15,170
Two drunk men picked a fight with us,
"Why are you young'uns here?"

80
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,550
They started beating my friend.

81
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,870
- For no particular reason?
- Because they were drunk.

82
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,810
I had no strength, but I ran head on
because I had to save my friend.

83
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:33,790
I held on saying, "Let him go!"
But there was an accident.

84
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:38,660
It was snowing. When I did that,
he slipped and hit his head.

85
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,810
I did that to a gangster.

86
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:46,220
- You made him slip?
- I made him pass out.

87
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,440
- I was afraid.
- There's one more.

88
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,590
My friend held on to the other guy
because we had to make it out alive.

89
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:05,510
That's when the boss and others came.
We thought we were going to die.

90
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:17,020
But the boss started beating the guy who passed
out. "How can you get beaten by some kids?"

91
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,550
I said, "Please stop!
We didn't mean to do this!"

92
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,940
He told me to shut up and
asked who did this to him.

93
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,960
- Who did this?
- Thought I was a goner.

94
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:38,840
My friend who wrote the strange ad copy
just came out after using the restroom.

95
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,400
I was taking care of the situation,
but he completely lost it.

96
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,810
- "What are you doing to my friends?"
- When things were starting to get quiet?

97
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,480
That was before he turned the corner.
He just saw that small group.

98
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:02,430
He saw a large group when
he turned the corner.

99
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:13,330
He always acted cool. He took out his phone
and told all of them to come at him at once.

100
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:18,210
I said, "What are you doing? Don't cause
any more trouble!" He called the police.

101
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,100
"Hurry and come! I'm going to die!"

102
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,300
We were saved because the
police came right away.

103
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,570
The last one is when
I really almost died.

104
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,570
And the one who passed out?

105
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,170
The police took us in their
car and we were saved.

106
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,040
- Did the guy wake up?
- Beats me.

107
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
I was afraid and left.

108
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,380
You said, "Please stop!"
He slipped and passed out.

109
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,770
He slipped on the snow.

110
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:53,760
Also that winter, I didn't
have a place to stay.

111
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,030
All the five story apartments until block 163
were being reconstructed in my neighborhood.

112
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:04,810
All the tenants were told to move out.
I thought of sleeping in those empty rooms.

113
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:11,300
I slept in block 125. I put a mattress in
the basement that someone threw away.

114
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:20,000
I was sleeping, but it was noisy. I woke up
and everything was demolished to block 124.

115
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,440
They were breaking it?

116
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:32,670
Yes. All the apartments were
destroyed except for block 125.

117
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,370
You must have fainted.

118
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:43,580
I went back home and decided
to go back to high school.

119
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:50,460
Such hardships in life weren't bad
since he gained a lot of things.

120
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,070
Winter break is the season when
you run away from home.

121
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,810
Winter break is the season
to run away from home?

122
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:05,820
Don't go through hardships but spend
a happy new year with your family.

123
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:13,510
Your goals are not achieved by running
away. Think of what your mother said.

124
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:19,120
You'll know it when you graduate
from high school like me.

125
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,400
Don't regret it later.
Unpack your bags...

126
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,780
He's not detailed.

127
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,330
Just stay still at home.

128
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:38,480
If any of you have such thoughts,
take what he said to heart.

129
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,690
He got over such a past and
became one of the best idols.

130
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,080
He became a singer he dreamt of and
showed various images on stage.

131
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,420
From his charisma to his liveliness,
he showed many different faces.

132
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,120
He unleashed his potential again
in the drama, "Boys over Flowers."

133
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:10,170
He played flower boy, Ji-hoo, and was the
originator of the "flower boy" syndrome.

me starting this moment?

164
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:19,730
- Take your punishment.
- Bear with it.

165
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,040
We're against it.

166
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,300
Fine!

167
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,920
She has it!

168
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,970
[Cell phone?]

169
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,160
Does she have an ulterior
motive for coming today?

170
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,230
- Is she here for a date?
- After the broadcast...

171
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,970
- Is this a dating program?
- Don't give her my number.

172
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,250
It's his number!

173
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,800
Thank you.

174
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,450
Do you suggest another
word? What will it be?

175
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,210
"I'm ugly."

176
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,950
What do you think
of your looks?

177
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,530
[She can say anything after
getting his number]

178
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,420
I'm ugly.

179
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,940
- That's incredible.
- She's humble.

180
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,240
Should we get married in May?

181
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,630
[Butchered]

182
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,120
The bride of May.

183
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,870
Fine!

184
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,660
Things are moving quickly.

185
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,720
What's with your figure?

186
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm ugly.

187
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,150
That attack doesn't work on her.

188
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:43,980
Bachelor Hyun-joong?
Follow me!

189
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,410
Do you still like me?

190
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,580
[Looking straight in the eye...]

191
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,320
I don't like that.

192
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,640
It ends with him
not liking you.

193
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,240
Jung Joo-ri wins!

194
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:10,950
- Off to the wheel with you.
- Shouldn't get "shampoo hair."

195
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,340
Spin the wheel!

196
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,190
[Spins the punishment wheel!]

197
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,860
He got "shampoo hair."

198
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,180
[He won the long-awaited
"shampoo hair"]

199
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:32,250
The president of my agency told
me to never slick back my hair.

200
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,780
I will do it exclusively
for this program.

201
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,810
Who slicks back their hair
exclusively for a program?

202
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,200
- This is the first time ever.
- Fine. Let's do it!

203
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,360
What's wrong Han-young?

204
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,620
- Can I try once?
- No, I'm doing it.

205
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,790
Please!

206
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,590
Pour water over his head.

207
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,580
Is she actually...

208
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,100
Even Hyun-bin?

209
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,170
You're going to empty it?

210
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:16,640
- Don't spill it!
- He's like a eunuch.

211
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,260
My first time washing
a man's hair.

212
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,260
[Shampoo finished!]

213
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,880
Why are you applauding for that?

214
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,580
She acts differently compared
to Bachelor Shin.

215
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,330
- This isn't punishment.
- Is he an emperor?

216
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,920
- Do we have to bow?
- He will show his hair.

217
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,580
[Finally...]

218
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,560
[Every girl's dream...]

219
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,990
[Here is...]

220
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,700
It's a punishment but not for him.
He doesn't even get a humiliating shot.

221
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:01,140
Is this the might of a flower boy?
We have evidence of that power.

222
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,370
I can endure pinches.

223
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,970
- Really?
- Yes.

224
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,040
- Really?
- Honest.

225
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,870
Pinch him real hard.

226
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,230
Doesn't it hurt?

227
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,100
- Really?
- Pinch me.

228
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,970
Boom, come here.

229
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,580
I was always curious...

230
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,010
[Even though Ho-dong strains!]

231
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:33,850
Please stand here. People will
think it's fake if the cast does it.

232
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,310
Anyone from the audience?
Who wants to pinch him?

233
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:45,930
- Me! I want to!
- Hurry! Run!

234
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,890
[This look!]

235
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,330
[Moved]

236
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,080
[Only saw him in her dreams]

237
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,230
[Even tears!]

238
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:05,200
She lost her mind after seeing him.
Yes, we understand that feeling.

239
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,970
How can she pinch in that state?

240
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:12,850
I can pinch him.
I can do it.

241
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,530
Wait, wait, wait!

242
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,170
Just stay still!
Are you okay?

243
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,520
I'm okay. Oppa...

244
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,800
We have to go on
with the show...

245
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,800
I'm okay. Really.

246
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,660
We'll do a reenactment
of what you did.

247
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,260
Alright. Will you do it?

248
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,060
Hurry! Come up here!

249
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,030
[It's the same]

250
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,910
[Am I dreaming?]

251
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,670
[Boom reborn as an actor]

252
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,070
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

253
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,330
- You're okay?
- Yes, I am.

254
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,240
Calm down. Can you do it?

255
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,700
Even this perfect flower
boy has a complex.

256
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,040
- I have a complex.
- What did you say?

257
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,370
What's with that voice?

258
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:28,550
Since it's night...
I'm getting facial hair.

259
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:35,940
This is normal, but I
used to think it wasn't.

260
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,710
I'm getting facial hair because I'm
growing old, but I can't accept that.

261
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,850
I'm an idol! Why am I
getting facial hair?

262
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,680
That's understandable. It's like
when kids first get armpit hair.

263
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,680
Every time I see that on dramas or
music programs, I can't accept it.

264
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,140
I have severe dark circles
when make up is removed.

265
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:14,340
Why do I have dark circles? Then I have
to quit drinking. I can't accept that.

266
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,970
Since I love playing soccer,
my face became darker.

267
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,650
Because you play ball outside.

268
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:27,440
My face is dark, but
it's white here.

269
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:35,880
When I see myself after a shower,
I look like a burnt matchstick.

270
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,620
Because you're like this
only up to here?

271
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,460
You're just dark here like
a burnt matchstick?

272
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:56,060
I hated that. So I watch male
actors and singers closely.

273
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:00,590
"Some of them are definitely
like matchsticks."

274
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,670
And Cha Seung-won is one.

275
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,790
Only here?

276
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:17,790
Since he films outside often,
I thought, "I'm okay then."

277
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,980
[Even Dokko Jin's a matchstick]

278
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,740
Are you jealous of other celebrities?

279
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,590
Of course! Yes, I am.

280
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,830
You're good-looking but jealous?

281
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:35,340
I get jealous too. When I watched
the movie, "The Man from Nowhere"...

282
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:42,860
When I watched it at the theatre, the
women went wild when he cuts his hair.

283
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:51,930
I also think it's cool, but I tell people,
"He cuts his hair that well by himself?"

284
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,790
[Every Korean man thinks that way]

285
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,940
"A killer can cut his hair that well?"

286
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,500
- As if you don't understand.
- I try to find faults.

287
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:13,330
When "Jeon Woo Chi" was popular...
He's very cool and a good actor.

288
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:21,700
When women say he's cool, I agree.
But isn't his dialect strange?

289
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,010
[Feels the same]

290
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,700
- Wow! He's really honest.
- Every man thinks the same.

291
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,010
I acknowledge it but jealous.

292
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:36,680
It's cute that a flower boy gets jealous,
but don't let it get to your head.

293
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:43,450
Why don't we take a glimpse
into his love life as well?

294
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:59,960
- When was your first love?
- I think in the 7th grade.

295
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,460
- 7th grade?
- Yes.

296
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:08,630
I suddenly remember you saying that
you couldn't talk to girls at school.

297
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,060
- Is it coming and going?
- What's going on?

298
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:22,150
Other girls were invisible because
there was this one girl I liked...

299
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,270
Then you should've
said it like that!

300
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:30,680
I only hung out with guys because I
didn't get a chance to speak to her.

301
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,640
How and where did you meet her?

302
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,420
After school at a
sundaeguk restaurant.

303
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,670
And you were in middle school?

304
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:45,600
Old people usually go there
to settle their stomach.

305
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,030
A middle school student went there?
What is going on here right now?

306
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,350
What's your story?

307
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:02,070
I happened to eat there with a friend
and a girl came in and ordered a bowl.

308
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,490
- A certain girl?
- Alone?

309
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,410
- In the 7th grade?
- Yes.

310
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,400
- She was with her friends.
- So she was with a group.

311
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,220
They would usually go to a
bakery or fast food restaurant.

312
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,940
So I ate there almost every
day for 2 1/2 years.

313
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,620
- Did she also come every day?
- No. She came only 2 or 3 times.

314
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,580
You ate there for 2 1/2 years
to see her those 2-3 times?

315
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:38,250
I would rotate my friends around since
they got sick of eating the same thing.

316
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,340
[All to see her...]

317
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:47,220
- You went with your friends to see her...
- He changed his friends and not the menu?

318
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,840
You must have really liked her.

319
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,590
"Can I get a bowl here?
Is she coming today?"

320
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,630
I know.

321
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,640
That's how I felt. She came
in when I was eating.

322
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,020
- You saw her when she came in?
- After I saw her, that was it.

323
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,380
- Did you talk to her?
- No, I just saw her.

324
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,180
You should've been cool and said, "A
platter of boiled beef for her, please."

325
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,720
If a man does something cool like that,
she would be like, "What is this?"

326
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,800
"He ordered this for you."
Then she would look at you.

327
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,430
And you could say something cool
like, "Enjoy" before you leave.

328
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:32,660
I couldn't do that because I had to
break my piggy bank to eat sundaeguk.

329
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:40,940
I ate there until the
restaurant closed down.

330
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,740
- What does that mean?
- Did you work there?

331
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:54,270
The owner was an old lady and she was
sick. So I helped her move meat.

You got close with her while
waiting for the girl.

- You became fond of her.
- Yes, I did.

So it ended with a crush?
At the sundaeguk restaurant?

335
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:18,590
I had a friend who liked a girl for 3 years
and we spoke our mind at that restaurant.

336
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:29,240
On December 31st past midnight before going
to high school, we decided to speak up.

337

We agreed to confess and congratulate the
one who hit it off since we're friends.

338
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:48,030
My friend confessed and it didn't work out,
but fortunately, it worked out for me.

her blog, find out her birthday...

- No, I called her.
- By phone?

crashing down.

to eat sundaeguk.

what she would say?

What was her response?

354

they didn't know.

like to go to the movies with her.

00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:57,550
The manager was surprised,
"Why did you run in here naked?"

498
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,860
He was sleeping and
was surprised.

499
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,780
He could have gotten
the wrong idea.

500
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,910
I told him, "Hurry, there's
a ghost by the shoe shelf!"

501
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:13,570
Kyu-jong and I share a room and
this time we saw it together.

502
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:20,660
We're sleeping and the male ghost looks at
us from here and the female ghost from there.

503
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,630
We were scared at first,
but now we're used to it.

504
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,350
- Since you see it all the time?
- Yes, we see it all the time.

505
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:33,750
They're talking with each other, and
Kyu-jong would say, "Go to sleep already!"

506
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:40,410
When I come alone, they're noisy
and knock on the dining table.

507
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:45,710
Since I'm used to it,
I shout, "Be quiet!"

508
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,550
- Really?
- Yes.

509
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,070
And then I really
don't hear them.

510
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:57,610
Since we're used to it now,
we're not afraid anymore.

511
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:06,540
The manager was tired and went to sleep
and the ghost was lying next to him.

512
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,750
He pushed away the face
saying, "Go to sleep."

513
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:17,320
He's used to it now. The ghost
got up and went outside.

514
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:24,420
He felt uncomfortable and bought a
tailsman but stuck it only on his room.

515
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,720
We went to Japan and saw it again.

516
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:41,910
The door's over there, Kyu-jong and I are
sitting here and the others are here...

517
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,330
[The MCs have a weak heart]

518
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,570
[Seung-gi's startled]

519
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,870
That startled me.

520
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:08,150
I went on a trip with some friends.
We had sashimi and bbq in a cabin.

521
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:12,650
We decided to find a place
where we could sing and drink.

522
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:15,210
That's when I first found out.

523
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:18,990
Seogupyo... Seogupo... Seogyupo...

524
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,060
Seogwipo.

525
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,260
Seogyu... gyu... gwipo.
It was Seogwipo...

526
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,670
- Where are you from?
- Jamsil in Seoul.

527
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,220
[He speaks Jamsil dialect]

528
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:36,170
There's no such place in Seogwipo,
but in downtown Jeju...

529
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:41,000
There's a place with a room, food and
alcohol, and you can sing and dance.

530
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,590
- It was a nightclub.
- Ah! A ballroom.

531
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:54,750
We went. Our gang and another
gang went there together.

532
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:59,120
We drank and had fun.
We also sang.

533
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:05,390
When I'm drunk, I fall asleep.

534
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:12,320
I left to use the restroom and came
back, but I don't remember anything.

535
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,640
- You were drunk?
- Yes.

536
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:22,210
I opened my eyes to check my text
and saw I had 100 missed calls.

537
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:31,830
I put my phone on the floor after
seeing it and went back to sleep.

538
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,660
All of a sudden, I thought,
"What is this place?"

539
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,040
Of course.

540
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:42,700
I couldn't see my hands.
It was pitch black.

541
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:48,390
I tried to calm myself because
I could have been kidnapped.

542
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:51,950
- You must have been afraid.
- I was scared senseless.

543
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:56,700
I imagined all sorts of things.
"What if I was sold somewhere."

544
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:08,330
I turned on my cell phone to see, but it
ran out of battery. I only saw for a second.

545
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:16,890
I groped around for my shoes and
started feeling my surroundings.

546
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:23,950
I was feeling around the room
and felt several buttons.

547
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,310
Where is he?

548
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,950
It could be a cold storage.

549
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,830
You shouted, but
there was no one?

550
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:37,420
I shouted, "Is anyone there?"
But there was no answer.

551
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:42,920
I pressed the button
and it felt familiar.

552
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,750
Ah! It's the room
from yesterday.

553
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,510
The buttons were from
the karaoke machine?

554
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:51,700
Yes.

555
00:44:51,700 --> 00:45:00,430
Two groups came together and you
were the only one trapped there?

556
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:07,970
I searched my memory. I slept in
the right room and not the left.

557
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:13,210
But they left me and
all the workers left.

558
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:19,690
I was alone in that
dark nightclub.

559
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,550
Think about it, it's dark...

560
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,590
- It really was like night.
- It's scary to be there alone.

561
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,840
- It is scary.
- What did you do?

562
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:36,990
I had to get out. The only light
I saw was from the exit sign.

563
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:45,100
I went towards it and discovered
a door, but it wouldn't open.

564
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,400
- Since it's locked?
- Yes, it was locked.

565
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,180
- They don't lock it from the inside.
- It's locked from the outside.

566
00:45:52,180 --> 00:46:01,880
I found a phone and dialed 119,
but it rang from another room.

567
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,360
[It's an extension!]

568
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:12,530
- As soon as you pressed "1"...
- It was ringing from the kitchen.

569
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,580
"What do I do?"

570
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:21,840
A Korean Wave star trapped in a
nightclub with his hair in a mess.

571
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:25,190
If that was filmed,
it would go viral.

572
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:30,170
I was thinking and started touching
the door. I managed to get it open.

573
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:35,070
I opened the glass door, raised
the shutter, and went outside.

574
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:38,180
It was like the raining scene in
"The Shawshank Redemption."

575
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:43,160
My hair was caked and
my face was swollen.

576
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:50,990
I got out but didn't have money.
I couldn't go back to Seogwipo.

577
00:46:50,990 --> 00:47:03,090
I made a collect call to my friends, but
they didn't pick up. They were sleeping.

578
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:10,340
Downtown Jeju to Seogwipo
was around 25 mi.

579
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:13,150
I thought walking would
be overdoing it.

580
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:15,210
That's like a marathon.

581
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:21,860
I sat on the street
like a beggar.

582
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,740
[A waste to call a
flower boy a beggar]

583
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,190
- A flower beggar.
- He sure is one.

584
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:35,240
I hung around for 1 1/2 hours
and finally made it back.

585
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:42,560
I found out later on why
I was in that room.

586
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:48,130
It says "Jaejoong" in front of the room.
I thought that was the waiter's name.

587
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,250
But it was on every room.

588
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,440
- Oh, it's occupied.
- There's people inside.

589
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:00,840
It means it's occupied.
So I entered the wrong room.

590
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,280
[This was the true nature of that
incident! He's an oddball star!]

591
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,440
Why did they leave you?

592
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,930
They looked for me but thought
I left because I was tired.

593
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:18,480
When you go drinking next time, sleep
at home even though you're tired.

594
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,230
That's why I call them
over to my place now.

595
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:28,770
I would go around the country
to find famous restaurants.

596
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,490
- Really?
- Yes.

597
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:36,580
I went around to find tteokbokki
that pleases my palate.

598
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:43,560
I sign up at a naengmyun bulletin board
and read reviews on famous restaurants.

599
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,850
That's how passionate you were?

600
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:51,940
There's over 20 tteokbokki restaurants
in Sindang-dong's Tteokbokki Alley.

601
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:56,770
I went and ate at each place
over a period of 3 months.

602
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,530
- Really?
- Yes.

603
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,820
You must have had
a lot of time.

604
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:05,210
- You weren't busy at all.
- We thought you were busy.

605
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,960
You should have come on
this show during that time.

606
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,070
Why eat tteokbokki
for 3 months?

607
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,800
- If we only knew.
- We thought you were busy.

608
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,610
We were waiting for you.

609
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,340
I guess I'll be busy now.

610
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:26,370
- What place is good?
- Any recommendations?

611
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:30,760
The best place is where the food
is salty, spicy, and sweet.

612
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,470
Huh? What?

613
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,790
Salty, spicy, and sweet. Why?

614
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:37,780
Stimulating food is the best.

615
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,280
Plus a lot of MSG...

616
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,580
[A devotee of MSG?]

617
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,160
People are avoiding that and
looking for green foods.

618
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,130
Well... umm... I'm taking
medication anyways.

619
00:49:54,450 --> 00:50:03,560
He has unique values. We can find
such charm in the things he says.

620
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,860
- He must've been a rascal.
- I sure was.

621
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,790
I skipped school and played soccer.

622
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:20,180
Your parents are called for too many
absences and you could get expelled.

623
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:27,230
I stole the roll book and dropped
it between the apartment elevator.

624
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:30,100
The space between the door?

625
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,170
- That space?
- Yes.

626
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:39,330
How do you recover it?

627
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:43,370
When the apartment
is reconstructed.

628
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,420
[They suffered from H1N1]

629
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,210
- You know, right?
- Of course, I do.

630
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:58,220
It says in the article, "Celebrity No. 1."
It's not like we're Robot Taekwon V.

631
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,300
[Not regarding sick people's feelings]

632
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:08,430
- Seung-gi, were you No. 5?
- I was around No. 10.

633
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,090
[Accompanied by backup dancers!]

634
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:43,060
[He's cool]

635
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,800
[High-class dancing]

636
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:05,160
[A beautiful finish]

637
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,210
I was curious about something.

638
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,040
What?

639
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,440
Why is there no mic
on the mic stand?

640
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,770
I thought you gave your all.

641
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,910
- I took it off.
- Why?

642
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:21,890
It's heavy.

643
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:23,990
[No pretense! He's honest!]

644
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,390
I lost weight due to that while
filming the music video.

645
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:33,280
- Because you held something heavy?
- Well, it is a lump of metal.

646
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:40,630
I wanted to be a PR Ambassador.

647
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,610
Huh?

648
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:47,040
- You know... promoting things.
- Like the Pyeongchang Olympics?

649
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,330
- Like a public service announcement?
- To enhance national prestige.

650
00:52:50,330 --> 00:53:01,010
I don't know about others, but doing
that is representing South Korea.

651
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:09,530
Then look at the camera and say something
for Visit Korea Year, also in English.

652
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:14,470
A Korean Wave star can do that.
In Japanese too if you can.

653
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:19,220
Please visit Korea on
Visit Korea Year.

654
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,000
With confidence.

655
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,290
Visit Anus...

656
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:28,210
[He was nervous]

657
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,290
Visit Anus Year?

658
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:39,010
It's not Visit Anus Year.
That's not really...

659
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:42,530
- That's like saying get an endoscope.
- That's the surgery department.

660
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,090
- I'm not confident.
- It's okay.

as a solo artist with the song, "Please."

667
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:53,120
[A sentimental pop R&B with a beautiful piano
melody, grand orchestra, and sad lyrics]

668
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,190
[The performance along the
sad song stands out]

669
00:54:56,190 --> 00:55:02,210
[It was changed more than 10 times for him.
It was first made public before his album]

670
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,460
After that was the title
track, "Break Down."

671
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:36,730
The strong performance stood out
as it showed off masculinity.

672
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:40,070
He even reached the top
with this song.

673
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:05,780
[It's a south urban dance song with powerful
electronic brass and dynamic synth sounds]

"Kiss Kiss", an exciting pop dance song.

679

680
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:13,960
This is when he forms a
special relationship.

681
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:21,040
It's his agency's CEO who helped with his
solo career, Bae Yong-joon, aka Yon-sama.

684

What are your thoughts on being
called "Little Bae Yong-joon"?

685
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:51,660
People think I'll feel bad for being called
Little something or the 2nd something.

686
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:57,270
If I could only be half of
what Bae Yong-joon is...

687
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:01,740
It's good to be half of
him popularity wise.

688
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:07,770
Kim Hyun-joong and Bae Yong-joon
are very close like brothers.

689
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:16,750
Bae Yong-joon gave him advice on choosing
an agency when he was worrying about it.

690
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:22,040
Several months ago, people were
calling me "The 2nd Yon-sama."

691
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,440
Are you two close?

692
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,490
Yes.

693
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:28,600
Well, he is the CEO of
Kim Hyun-joong's agency.

694
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,530
Where did you meet him recently?

695
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:35,580
In Busan. He was there alone.

696
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:40,360
I called him that I'll be there tomorrow.
I got on the plane and we had fun.

697
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,310
What was he doing there?

698
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:44,420
Solitude.

699
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,830
Solitude?

700
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:53,920
He was doing mind control in front
of the ocean while sipping tea.

701
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,520
You mean self-control?

702
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,920
["Mind control" is a game term]

703
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,610
I played too many games.

704
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:11,190
We ate and I asked if
he wanted some beer.

705
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:20,160
He said, "Sure, buy some canned beer.
Let's drink while viewing the ocean."

706
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:26,640
But the spring winds are cold. After
2 minutes, he said, "Let's go inside."

707
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,210
He was cold after
experiencing solitude?

708
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:32,630
He said it's hard
to endure the cold.

709
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,700
Yon-sama can overcome
anything except the cold.

710
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:42,600
Tell us how you stabbed
him in the back.

711
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,870
I sang the theme song of the
Guangzhou 2010 Asian Games.

712

[Singing the theme song of the Guangzhou 2010
Asian Games as one of Asia's top artists]

713
01:04:51,570 --> 01:05:02,090
I was waiting at the airport, but someone
asked me in Chinese for an autograph...

714
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:04,770
Handing me a photo of Bae Yong-joon.

715
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,540
- A Chinese person?
- Yes.

716
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:15,830
If it was a Japanese person, although not
fluent, I could say, "I'm not Yon-sama."

717
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:21,320
But this person was speaking in
Chinese and I didn't know what to say.

718
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:26,770
I kept on saying, "No! No! No,
Bae Yong-joon. No, Bae Yong-joon."

719
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:32,100
- That person said I was lying.
- Because you're Bae Yong-joon?

720
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:37,640
This person followed me around the
duty-free shops for 30 minutes.

721
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,280
I told that person that I'm not
him. I'm not Bae Yong-joon.

722
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,020
Later that person got angry.

723
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:48,800
A star should say he can't sign
an autograph. Why is he lying.

724
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,100
That person was offended.

725
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:56,720
That person said bad things about
Bae Yong-joon in the end and left.

726
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:01,770
- That Bae Yong-joon is bad?
- Yes, so he lost a fan.

727
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:03,340
[He sure is an oddball]

728
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,970
Bae Yong-joon got a bad
name for no reason.

729
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:15,360
You could have said that you're
singer Kim Hyun-joong.

730
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,000
It's a difference in education.

731
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,870
I made him lose a fan due to
me not being educated.

732
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:28,290
That person will still think you're
him and that he's unmannered...

733
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:33,770
- Doesn't even sign autographs...
- Doesn't say that he is Bae Yong-joon.

734
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:37,390
That person might watch this show
and think he's Bae Yong-joon.

735
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:38,620
[I'm Kim Hyun-joong]

736
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:45,980
You two seem close. Did you ask
if you could call him on the show?

737
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:52,390
The writers asked me if
a call was possible.

738
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:53,930
Of course!

739
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:59,690
This was my first request. I asked
him, "I have a favor to ask of you."

740
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:04,990
"I'm going to be a guest on this show.
Is it possible for me to call you?"

741
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:11,390
He said, "Sure, since this
is your first favor."

742
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:19,330
- You know "Sebaku"?
- You mean "Sebakwi"?

743
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,510
It's "Sebakwi."

744
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:27,250
He was confused and said,
"I'm nervous of quizzes."

745
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,380
[He barely appeared on variety
shows and was nervous]

746
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:41,680
I said, "Just be yourself." He texted he's
nervous on quizzes with a crying emoticon.

747
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,280
[This Korean Wave star
is actually a cutie]

748
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:49,090
Are we able to call
him on this show?

749
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:51,400
Should I try?

750
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,070
That's cool!

751
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,460
We're grateful but...

752
01:07:56,460 --> 01:08:04,660
If he does pick up, we're doing
a 1 minute speed quiz.

753
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:05,720

[It's him!]

758
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,210
Start!

759
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:27,310
You only have a minute.

760
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:33,040
- The group I started...
- SS501.

761
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,350
- National MC is...
- Kang Ho-dong.

762
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:39,460
- Huh?
- Kang Ho-dong.

763
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:45,650
Wrong.

764
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:48,460
What are you called in Japan?

765
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:54,130
Me? Yon-sama...

766
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,580
The most handsome
in Super Junior.

767
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:01,680
Umm... Shindong.

768
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,860
President to elementary
school students.

769
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:07,060
- Hyun-joong?
- Yes?

770
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:11,470
This isn't a quiz show, right?

771
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:13,170
[Stop pretending!]

772
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,740
Correct!

773
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:20,150
Hello, Bae Yong-joon?

774
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:23,260
Hello.

775
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:24,480

Please greet the viewers.

777
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:35,800
Sure. Hello, viewers.
I am Bae Yong-joon.

778
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:37,200
[Charisma can be felt
in his voice!]

779
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,870
It's the same voice you
hear on television.

780
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,600
Hyun-joong said you get
nervous on quizzes.

781
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:52,340
I thought I had to solve questions,
but I found out it wasn't.

782
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:55,320
Were you confused with "Sebakwi"?

783
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,780
Umm... well... yeah...
I think so.

784
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,770
[That can happen since he's busy]

785
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:05,410
What do you think of
Kim Hyun-joong?

786
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:15,710
He's talented. People with talent
don't make an effort, but he does.

787
01:10:15,710 --> 01:10:24,030
He's always concerned, progresses,
and is always polite and humble.

788
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:28,520
Many people, including myself,
like that about him.

789
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,210
Why did you go to Busan alone?

790
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:34,300
- Busan?
- Yes.

791
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:38,200
I had no place to stay in Seoul.

792
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,210
You can stay at my place!

793
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:44,180
- Who are you?
- I'm Jung Joo-ri.

794
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:47,960
- Oh! Hello.
- You know me?

795
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,040
Stay at my place.
It's Hapjeong.

796
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,140
[What a fool]

797
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,470
I heard you get cold easily.

798
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:59,430
Yes... I do.

799
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:01,960
How did you know?

800
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:07,270
Hyun-joong told us a little.

801
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:10,830
You'll be surprised when
you watch this show.

802
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:22,410
During the quiz, you said Kang Ho-dong
was the national MC without hesitation.

803
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:27,230
Since he's there...

804
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:29,490
[He's considerate!]

805
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,130
During "Happy Together",
he'll say it's Yoo Jae-suk.

806
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,480
What were you doing?

807
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,920
- Me?
- Right now.

808
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,320
I was waiting for this call.

809
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,180
[Even Korean Wave stars get
nervous for getting a call]

810
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:47,540
- While studying for the quiz.
- His answer was one-dimensional.

811
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:53,340
We're having a talk battle
for the King of Kings.

812
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:59,120
Kim Hyun-joong and U-know Yunho
are battling in Round 1.

813
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:04,950
Could you tell us who you predict
is going to be the winner?

814
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:08,250
- Umm...
- Could you...

815
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:16,070
I think Hyun-joong is going to win,
but it's good to see him lose as well.

816
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:18,820
Why?

817
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:22,340
I think the viewers would enjoy
seeing him get stood up.

818
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,950
[Puts a lot of thought
into his answers]

819
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:27,220
Please greet before you go.

820
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:35,750
I was glad to meet the two MCs even
though it was by phone. I had a fun time.

821
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:42,850
I hope the viewers will take interest
in this show and always stay healthy.

822
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:45,730
[Thank you for answering the call
despite your busy schedule]

823
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:48,540
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

824
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:52,210
Yong-joon, I love...
Did he hang up?

825
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:54,840
Thank you.

826
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:01,430
A phone connection for Kim Hyun-joong,
but there were others that pleased him.

827
01:13:01,430 --> 01:13:04,610
It's the people at his agency.

828
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:07,640
I'm close to 4 types of people.

829
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:19,690
1st is dancers, 2nd is friends, 3rd is my
old trainees, and 4th is my agency people.

830
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:28,160
Except for the agency people, the
rest of the 3 types were all nice.

831
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:35,270
They're nice but not that nice
when nice people saw them.

832
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:37,590
- Huh?
- That's hard.

833
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:41,510
Then is Seung-gi nice or what?

834
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:45,270
He sulks easily.

835
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:46,800
[Holds a grudge?]

836
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:54,190
There was an opportunity for me to
get close with my agency people.

837
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:59,070
I've been there for 1 1/2 years, but I wasn't
close with them for a year and 3 months.

838
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:03,700
With the exception of the director, Mr. Shin.
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

839
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:07,370
No, we wouldn't know.

840
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:18,300
I recently came back from my Asia Tour.
I went to 9-10 countries without rest.

841
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:24,840
I never went outside this time.
Many fans were waiting in the lobby.

842
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:30,430
I felt there might be an accident if I leave
and the agency told me to stay in the hotel.

843
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:34,430
I have nothing to do,
so we drank wine.

844
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:39,740
We decided to do something to
the one who passed out first.

845
01:14:39,740 --> 01:14:41,260
Do what?

846
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,490
I didn't know what that was.

847
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:51,010
I thought they were boring people
and the most they would do is tickle.

848
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:57,920
One person left around 3 AM.

849
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:04,640
- Back to the room?
- He was dead drunk.

850
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,890
He lost it...

851
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:14,450
- Don't you mean knocked out?
- Oh! Yeah, you're right.

852
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:16,160
[Made a mistake!]

853
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:20,790
Losing it and knocked out
is a big difference.

854
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:26,700
He was knocked out, but I didn't
know they were such fun people.

855
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:33,640
They started drawing on his face.

856
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:38,990
They told me it's okay for me to
reveal those pictures on this show.

857
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:40,190
Really?

858
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:45,350
- They said it was okay.
- But not you, right?

859
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:49,330
I never get drunk with them.

860
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:52,970
I might retire early.

861
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:55,060
[He might retire if such
pictures are taken!]

862
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,030
Anyways, I will show
those pictures.

863
01:15:57,030 --> 01:16:01,920
They're not celebrities, right?

864
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,170
I'll reveal them.

865
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:09,890
- Such things at the agency...
- How shocking is it?

866
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,230
[First scapegoat!]

867
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:15,180
[What a sight!]

868
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,150
What is that on his body?

869
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:19,030
This is...

870
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:21,660
Wow!

871
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:26,480
- Is he sleeping?
- That is sick!

872
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,570
[Second shocking photo!]

873
01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:30,750
[OMG!]

874
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:33,080
[As if special effects
make up was applied]

875
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,550
[Funny seeing it again]

876
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:36,930
And?

877
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,890
[Third and final photo!]

878
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:44,470
I thought he was Lee Juck.

879
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:47,050
Seems like he came
back from a war.

880
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:53,100
They have a sense of honor to throw
away their portrait rights for him.

881
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:58,910
They sure are a unique family with
strong ties to this oddball star.

882
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:00,710
It wasn't much...

883
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:07,130
Above all else, his family
is his greatest support.

884
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:13,610
It's been several months since I left, but
she prepared a meal as if I never left.

885
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:19,630
After six months you're like, "Mom, I'm home."
She says, "You hungry?" You're like, "Yes."

886
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:22,030
After you're done, she
says, "Sweet dreams."

887
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:25,450
It was awkward. It wasn't
what I was expecting.

888
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:28,580
You must have told your family
about these things.

889
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:29,500
I didn't.

890
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,920
Because they'll be worried?

891
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:37,600
As a global star are you affectionate
to your parents and give gifts?

892
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:45,730
I'm not affectionate. I received some
exposure and ran away from home...

893
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,310
My family were against
what I was doing.

894
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:57,680
I give them allowances, but...

895
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:03,990
I give it to my brother and
tell him to give it to them.

896
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:06,750
- You can't give it directly?
- No, I can't do that.

897
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:15,030
I have a lot of worries. I want to
buy my dad a nice foreign car...

898
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:26,330
If he drives that to Dongdaemun Market,
where he works, people might badmouth him.

899
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:33,550
I have a lot of stress because I want
to express my heart, but I can't.

900
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:41,930
That can turn to deep resentment
since parents are waiting for it.

901
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:52,280
My grandmother fell and broke her leg, and
was paralyzed during the leg operation.

902
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:57,680
She passed away last year during
the year-end awards ceremony.

903
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:04,520
After the ceremony, they changed
my bow tie to a black tie.

904
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:14,440
That's when I felt that I should express more
often because it's too late when that happens.

905
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:21,240
I had a lot of stress and couldn't call
them because of work on my solo album...

906
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,210
But I should call them more often
after listening to what Yunho said.

907
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:28,840
[Say, "I love you," to your
father in the morning]

908
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:35,070
Since we brought this up, why don't
you say something to your father?

909
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,900
Tell him you'll express more often.

910
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:51,660
I always respected you. I always
act cold and serious to you, but...

911
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:57,970
That's not my true heart. I apologize
for acting differently from how I feel.

912
01:19:57,970 --> 01:20:07,700
I exist because of you. I'll do well
for you and the family. I love you.

913
01:20:20,090 --> 01:20:22,800
Lucky guy, Kim Hyun-joong,
enjoys the stage.

914
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,660
[Lucky Guy, Kim Hyun-joong]

915
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:33,870
He releases his 2nd solo
album in October 2011.

916
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:38,820
He presented his special performance
through the title track, "Lucky Guy."

917
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:49,220
His interest in band music gave him the idea to
make this song so people can dance to the music.

918
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:10,110
[It's an American uptempo funky rock song with
rhythmical electric guitar and brass session]

919
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:19,110
[His interest in band music gave him the idea to
make this song so people can dance to the music]

920
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:25,160
[With Daybreak and Common Ground as
session members, it gave a fresh sound]

921
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:31,130
[The concept of a dandy and witty
gambler stood out as well]

922
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:22,740
"Do You Like That" is also
in the same album.

923
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:28,880
With his dandy and sexy charm, he
gives an exciting performance.

924
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:51,100
[A funky rock and roll with a memorable arrangement
of danceable beats and intense band instruments]

925
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:57,170
[He worked on the lyrics showing off his
exciting performance and sexy charms]

926
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:05,300
He must be a lucky guy to do a joint performance
with After School at the year-end gayo awards.

927
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:11,080
A special performance with pretty girls?
To me, he really is a lucky guy.

928
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:57,850
This is how he creates his
own special colors on stage.

929
01:25:57,850 --> 01:26:04,930
His complete transformation on
stage isn't strange anymore.

930
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:13,390
Not only is he active in Korea but will solidify his
position as an artist by planning a world tour.

931
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:18,440
Many are taking interest in
how much he will grow.
