00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:44,599
MAN: February 23, 1942.

2
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,647
"Out of Poland have come
these appalling pictures

3
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:52,719
"of the end product
of German conquest.

00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:59,047
"They show mass misery and death

00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:03,120
"to an extreme
rarely seen before in history.

00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:07,047
"They also show
the kind of thing

"the fighting foes

8

"The Jews of Poland

00:01:46,447 --> 00:01:50,327
"These are the grim
statistical facts.

00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:54,684
"The details of human agony are
multiplied beyond the telling."

19
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:59,484
'Life' magazine.

20
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:18,407
NARRATOR:
At the start of 1942,

21
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:20,841
almost all the news was bad.

22
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,687
The Soviet Union,
the United States' new ally,

23
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,447
was under unceasing attack
from the Germans,

24
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:30,567
who had encircled Leningrad

25
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,842
and reached the outskirts
of Moscow.

26
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,047
Japanese troops
had now taken Singapore,

27
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:40,167
the Gibraltar of the East,

28
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:42,635
and with it, all of Malaya.

29
00:02:48,887 --> 00:02:53,527
They had seized Borneo
and Burma and Hong Kong.

30
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:56,647
And they had taken
Guam and Wake Island,

31
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:58,319
Makin and Tarawa.

32
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:03,367
There was not
a single American base

33
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:06,439
between Hawaii
and the Philippines.

34
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,967
But President Roosevelt

35
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,007
and British prime minister
Winston Churchill agreed

36
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:18,007
that, for the time being,
they would have to remain

37
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:20,646
on the defensive in the Pacific.

38
00:03:22,207 --> 00:03:24,367
Germany, they decided,

39
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:28,007
with its vast armies
and mighty industrial machine,

40
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,486
was the greatest danger.

41
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:34,247
Victory in Europe would require

42
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,647
not only the mobilisation
of a generation of young men,

43
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:41,447
but also billions
of rounds of ammunition,

44
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:46,047
millions of guns, hundreds of
thousands of tanks and airplanes

45
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:49,687
and fleets of ships
to bring them to battle.

46
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:53,316
Producing all of that
would take time.

47
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:59,887
Meanwhile, the survival of
Britain and the Soviet Union

48
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:02,647
depended on
a steady stream of food

49
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:05,719
and fuel and weapons
from America.

50
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:32,847
BURT WILSON: When I was seven
years old, in Theodore Judah School,

51
00:04:32,847 --> 00:04:35,367
a boy from England,
an English refugee,

52
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:36,847
came into our class.

53
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:39,527
His name was
William Murgathroid Buchanan.

54
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:42,041
We all called him Roid -
Roid Buchanan.

55
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:46,687
And we developed
a great friendship.

56
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,407
And, one day,
Roid came over to my house,

57
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:52,607
and I was upstairs,
and he called, "Burt! Burt!"

58
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,087
And I looked out the window,

59
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,447
and I said, "Hi, Roid.
What's going on?"

60
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,127
And Roid said, "Do you know what

61
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:01,127
"a dirty German sub
did to my father?"

62
00:05:01,127 --> 00:05:03,357
And I said, "No. What?"
He said, "It killed him."

63
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:08,047
And I don't...

64
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:10,686
I didn't know
how to deal with that.

65
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:15,367
I went downstairs,

66
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:19,447
and we sat down under the tree
and talked awhile.

67
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:21,127
But it was still something that

68
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:26,807
I'd never had any experience
with, up until that time -

69
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,407
one of my best friends
telling me

70
00:05:28,407 --> 00:05:30,841
that his father
was killed in a war.

71
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:42,287
NARRATOR: On the evening of
January 13, 1942,

72
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:45,487
as American troops tried to stop
the Japanese on Bataán,

73
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:50,117
a German U-boat surfaced
silently off Manhattan.

74
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:55,487
Its commander was astonished
but gratified to see that,

75
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:57,527
more than a month
after Germany declared war

76
00:05:57,527 --> 00:05:59,327
on the United States,

77
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:03,887
America's largest city
was still ablaze with lights.

78
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:07,767
Using those lights
to silhouette his target,

79
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,247
he sent a torpedo
hissing toward the side

80
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:12,317
of an American oil tanker...

81
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,927
...then slipped back
beneath the sea

82
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,999
and moved south
in search of further prey.

83
00:06:26,287 --> 00:06:31,600
Within 12 hours, he had sunk
seven more unarmed vessels.

84
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:38,281
The United States seemed
totally unprepared for this kind of war.

85
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:44,607
By the end of January,

86
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:48,287
U-boats would sink 25 tankers
along the east coast,

87
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:52,127
continuing a fierce struggle
for supremacy of the seas,

88
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:54,327
called the Battle
of the Atlantic,

89
00:06:54,327 --> 00:06:58,286
and threatening to choke off
America's allies.

90
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:05,927
American beaches
were black with oil.

91
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:07,727
KATHARINE PHILLIPS:
All along the Gulf Coast

92
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,287
and all on the shores
of Mobile Bay,

93
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:12,647
we could go sit on the beach,

94
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:15,647
but we were not allowed
to light a fire,

95
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:18,487
because of the U-boats.

96
00:07:18,487 --> 00:07:23,127
We heard often in Mobile
that ships were sunk

97
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:25,807
just as they went out
of Mobile Bay.

98
00:07:25,807 --> 00:07:28,327
And we know this to be true,

99
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:31,527
because the life preservers
and the canned goods

100
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:34,167
washed up on our beaches.

101
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:38,407
NARRATOR: For a time,
the waters from Jacksonville, Florida,

102
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,047
to Galveston, Texas,
were considered

103
00:07:41,047 --> 00:07:43,163
the most dangerous
shipping lane in the world.

104
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:49,447
"The only safe run,"
said one wary merchant seaman,

105
00:07:49,447 --> 00:07:53,042
"is from St Louis to Cincinnati."

106
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,847
GLENN FRAZIER: I really fought
the first few days

107
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:34,327
for the good Old Glory...

108
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:36,567
you know, like everybody else,

109
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:38,647
you're saying,
"Good old United States.

110
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:41,007
"We're going to fight, we're
going to whip these Japanese

111
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:43,687
"in a matter
of six months," and so forth.

112
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:48,847
But when it really hit me that
this was not a short situation

113
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,607
and that they were hitting
us hard,

114
00:08:50,607 --> 00:08:54,767
then I think I changed
pretty much to protect myself

115
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,927
and my fellow Americans,
and I think I was fighting more

116
00:08:57,927 --> 00:08:59,406
to save my own life.

117
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:04,087
NARRATOR: Nearly 80,000
American and Filipino troops

118
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:07,607
had managed to escape
the Japanese around Manila

119
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:09,996
and take up positions
on the Bataán Peninsula.

120
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,836
Once again, General MacArthur's
planning had faltered.

121
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,797
Most supplies had been
left behind.

122
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:26,398
Rations had to be cut in half.

123
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:32,767
Bataán's humid forests
bred malarial mosquitoes.

124
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:36,247
Clean water was in short supply.

125
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:37,967
There was little medicine
on hand.

126
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:42,047
One field hospital had eight
operating tables...

127
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:45,323
and 1,200 battle casualties
in need of surgery.

128
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,878
Still the men struggled
to hold on...

129
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:01,967
...fighting off one attack
after another,

130
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:05,801
then retreating
halfway down the peninsula.

131
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:16,167
For weeks, the men on Bataán
continued to hope

132
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:18,167
that rescuers were coming.

133
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:22,407
Again and again, MacArthur
had assured them of it.

134
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:24,602
"Help is on the way,"
he promised.

135
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:28,447
FRAZIER: On the 'Voice of America',
one time, I remember it,

136
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:30,567
we were getting it
on short-wave radio.

137
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:33,927
It said, uh,
as far as the eye can see,

138
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:37,007
these ships and planes coming
to the Philippines.

139
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:41,007
We were told continuously that
we were getting reinforcements.

140
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:44,607
We were told that when we
retreated back into Bataán,

141
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,279
it would only be
for a few weeks.

142
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:57,557
NARRATOR: But no troops, no planes
had ever been dispatched.

143
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:01,687
They could not have made it
through, anyway.

144
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:04,406
The Japanese now controlled
the South Pacific.

145
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:13,007
"There are times," Secretary of War
Henry Stimson confided to his diary,

146
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,520
"when men must die."

147
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:22,727
By early March, three out
of four of Bataán's defenders

148
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,967
were incapacitated in some way -

149
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:31,207
sick, exhausted, wounded,
weak from hunger,

150
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,647
suffering from beriberi.

151
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:36,887
FRAZIER: At the end, close to the end,
there was one can of salmon

152
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:39,047
issued to 35 men

153
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,487
and some rice
and very little rice,

154
00:11:41,487 --> 00:11:43,887
so our situation was getting -

155
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:46,162
deteriorating and getting worse
every day.

156
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:53,687
NARRATOR: MacArthur managed
to leave his quarters on Corregidor

157
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:57,157
to visit his men on Bataán
precisely once.

158
00:12:00,767 --> 00:12:03,440
They began calling
him 'Dugout Doug'.

159
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:08,527
The soldiers' bitterness
intensified when,

160
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,007
acting under direct orders
from the president,

161
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:14,087
MacArthur, his wife,
4-year-old son

162
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:16,167
and 17 members of his staff

163
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,761
slipped out of Corregidor
in a PT boat.

164
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:25,327
From Australia, he issued
a brief statement.

165
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,797
"I came through," he said,
"and I shall return."

166
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:32,247
FRAZIER: When he left
and went to Australia,

167
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:35,127
that's what I call
doomsday for Bataán,

168
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:38,767
because we knew
then that we had to fight,

169
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:41,647
and he issued orders
to fight to the last man,

170
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:44,605
and that's, we knew what
our fate was going to be.

171
00:12:55,927 --> 00:13:01,767
NARRATOR: On April 9, 1942,
Major General Edward L. King

172
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:04,281
sent a soldier forward
with a white flag.

173
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:12,927
It was the largest surrender
by the United States Army

174
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:15,327
in its history -

175
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,717
78,000 American
and Filipino troops.

176
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:28,287
General King asked a Japanese
officer just one question -

177
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:31,438
would his men be treated
decently.

178
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:34,807
"Yes," said the officer,

179
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:36,365
"we are not barbarians."

180
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,287
But Japanese tradition held
that those who surrendered

181
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:46,327
rather than die on the battlefield

182
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:49,239
were cowards,
unworthy of respect.

183
00:13:57,207 --> 00:14:00,802
The prisoners were prodded
northward, 300 at a time.

184
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:05,527
They were to walk from Mariveles
to San Fernando,

185
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:07,647
then be loaded
onto railroad cars

186
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:11,083
for the journey to Camp O'Donnell
in central Luzon.

187
00:14:13,927 --> 00:14:16,607
What followed would be
remembered

188
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,326
as the Bataán Death March.

189
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,727
FRAZIER: If we had known what was
ahead of us at the beginning

190
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:29,561
of the Bataán Death March, uh,
I would have taken death.

191
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:36,087
It was very, very difficult
for us to understand,

192
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:39,247
because we had had no contact
with the Japanese whatsoever

193
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:41,487
as to what these people
are all about

194
00:14:41,487 --> 00:14:43,205
and what they're like.

195
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:49,087
And they immediately
started beating guys

196
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,238
if they didn't stand right
or if they were sitting down.

197
00:14:57,527 --> 00:14:59,127
We didn't know
where we were going.

198
00:14:59,127 --> 00:15:01,925
We didn't know anything.

199
00:15:11,207 --> 00:15:13,687
And we were stopped on the way,

200
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:16,327
some of us were,
and searched and beat again.

201
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:18,761
And all our possessions
were taken away from us.

202
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:23,127
Some of them had rings that they
just cut the fingers off

203
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:25,163
and take the rings.

204
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:30,847
They poured the water out
of my canteen

205
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,315
to be sure that I didn't
have any, any water.

206
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:38,327
I saw them buried alive.

207
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:41,247
When a guy was bayoneted
or shot,

208
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:44,607
laying in the road and
the convoys were coming along,

209
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:48,207
I saw trucks that would just
go out of their way

210
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:51,007
to run over the guy
in the middle of the road.

211
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:54,207
And when by the time you have
15 or 20 trucks run over you,

212
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:57,836
you look like a smashed
tomato or something.

213
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:03,527
And I saw people that had
their throats cut,

214
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:05,967
because they would take
their bayonets

215
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,607
and stick it out through
the corner of the truck at night

216
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:11,485
and it would just be high enough
to cut their throats.

217
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,807
And beating with a rifle butt

218
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:20,595
until there just was
no more life in them.

219
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:32,407
I saw Filipino women cut.

220
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,207
Their stomachs were cut open.

221
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:36,721
Their throats were cut.

222
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:43,007
I saw Filipinos
and Americans beheaded

223
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,238
just with one swipe of a sabre.

224
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:53,407
I marched six days
and seven nights, never stopped,

225
00:16:53,407 --> 00:16:56,647
I did not have but one sip
of water and no food.

226
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:59,607
Now, they say that you can't
do this, but I did.

227
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:02,607
When I got to the end
of the march after,

228
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:07,007
uh, at the end of the entire
march where I stopped

229
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:09,247
to get on a train -
they put us on a train -

230
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:12,247
my-my tongue wouldn't even
go back in my mouth.

231
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:14,487
And if you look and talk to
somebody about that,

232
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:17,957
they'll tell you that's
how close to death I was.

233
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:27,527
NARRATOR: No-one knows
precisely how many men died

234
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:30,167
on the Bataán Death March -

235
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:34,797
somewhere between 6,000 and
11,000 Filipinos and Americans.

236
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:40,007
And at the end of the march,

237
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:42,999
Camp O'Donnell
provided no relief.

238
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:47,087
An unfinished
Philippine army base,

239
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:50,727
surrounded by barbed wire
and machine gun towers,

240
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:53,407
with little water
and little shelter from the sun,

241
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,087
it would eventually hold nearly

242
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:59,397
60,000 miserable, desperate men.

243
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:05,607
Food was nothing but lugao,
watery rice soup

244
00:18:05,607 --> 00:18:07,837
filled with weevils and worms.

245
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,407
It was best to try and swallow
it after dark,

246
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:14,877
one man recalled,
so as not to have to look at it.

247
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:21,607
Some 16,000 more Filipinos
and Americans would die

248
00:18:21,607 --> 00:18:26,607
at Camp O'Donnell -
of dehydration, malnutrition,

249
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:31,607
malaria, beriberi, scurvy,

250
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:34,167
dysentery, hopelessness.

251
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,807
"Their bodies went by
in an endless column,"

252
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,287
one sergeant remembered.

253
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:47,960
"Day and night, they were
carried to the cemetery."

254
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:53,687
KATHARINE PHILLIPS:
We had all been so distressed

255
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:57,807
about leaving our boys
in the Philippines.

256
00:18:57,807 --> 00:19:01,687
There was no way of rescuing
them, we know now,

257
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:05,607
but at the time, we didn't know
that there were no ships.

258
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:08,967
Remember, they didn't tell us
how much had been sunk

259
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:11,807
at Pearl Harbor,
and we kept thinking,

260
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,847
"Why don't you go in there

261
00:19:13,847 --> 00:19:17,007
"and get the boys
out of the Philippines?"

262

(MAN SHOUTS
IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

263
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:25,036
NARRATOR: One day, Glenn Frazier
volunteered for burial detail.

264
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:30,807
FRAZIER:
On some days, we buried 250 men,

265
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:36,007
so I didn't know
that one day it might happen to me.

266
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:39,807
So, my idea was I had two sets
of dog tags.

267
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:42,167
And I said to myself,

268
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:45,967
"Well, I think I'll just throw
one of these sets of dog tags

269
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:51,287
"in the mass grave, so if I'm
alive when the war ends,

270
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:53,207
"there's no problem."

271
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:56,567
But if I'm missing or dead,
I didn't... I wanted my family

272
00:19:56,567 --> 00:20:00,407
to know and have some kind
of ending, and so forth,

273
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,807
so they would think that I was
in this grave.

NARRATOR:

stronghold in the Philippines,

277
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,446
fell to the Japanese.

SAM HYNES:
I went to Seattle in 1942.

280
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:50,647
One memory
is very clear and strong.

281
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:56,327
It's a Saturday, and I'm taking
a bus into the centre of town

282
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:58,487
and across the public square

283
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:02,287
in front of the town hall,
I guess it is...

284
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:03,927
And I see ahead of me

285
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:08,127
a line of people standing
patiently by a bus stop.

286
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:12,927
And as I approach, I see that
they're all Japanese

287
00:21:12,927 --> 00:21:16,047
and that they're getting
onto buses.

288
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:20,447
And I realise that these are
the Japanese-American citizens

289
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:25,167
of Seattle and the neighbourhood
who are being sent off

290
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:29,127
to what amounted
to a concentration camp.

291
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:32,927
And I think,
"Well, those are my enemies."

292
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:35,767
But they don't look like enemies
standing there

293
00:21:35,767 --> 00:21:39,607
in their American clothes
with their cardboard suitcases

294
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:42,838
waiting to be sent off
into the desert.

295
00:21:44,647 --> 00:21:48,727
NARRATOR:
On February 19, 1942,

296
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:54,767
President Roosevelt had signed
Executive Order 9066.

297
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:58,087
Its tone was carefully neutral.

298
00:21:58,087 --> 00:22:02,927
It authorised the War Department
to designate "military areas"

299
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:05,527
and then exclude
anyone from them

300
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:07,279
whom it felt to be a danger.

301
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:12,685
But it had a specific target...

302
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:18,247
...the more than 110,000 people
of Japanese ancestry

303
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:20,238
living along the west coast.

304
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:24,567
They were about to be forced

305
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:27,684
from their homes
and moved inland.

306
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:33,727
Thousands of German and Italian
aliens were also locked up,

307
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,447
but millions of German-
and Italian-American citizens

308
00:22:37,447 --> 00:22:41,918
remained free to live their
lives as they always had.

309
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,927
Only Japanese-Americans
on the west coast

310
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:48,927
were singled out.

311
00:22:48,927 --> 00:22:51,927
"A Jap's a Jap,"
said General John L. DeWitt

312
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:54,361
of the West Coast
Defence Command.

313
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:58,527
"It makes no difference whether he is
an American citizen or not.

314
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:00,438
"I don't want any of them."

315
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:06,327
Almost no-one protested
the government's plan,

316
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:09,447
which also classified
all Japanese-Americans

317
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:12,245
as unfit for military service.

318
00:23:13,447 --> 00:23:15,327
DANIEL INOUYE:
1 -A is physically fit,

319
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,207
and 4-F,
something's wrong with you.

320
00:23:18,207 --> 00:23:20,847
But 4-C means enemy alien.

321
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:24,327
And here I was, 17 years of age.

322
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:28,727
I considered myself
a good American but, uh...

323
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:31,002
made into an enemy.

324
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:46,327
NARRATOR: In Sacramento,
soon after Order 9066 was issued,

325
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:49,047
hand-lettered signs went up
all over town,

326
00:23:49,047 --> 00:23:52,437
saying "Japs must go."

327
00:23:54,687 --> 00:23:57,927
The orders to leave
arrived in May.

328
00:23:57,927 --> 00:24:02,167
Susumu Satow and his family
could scarcely believe it.

329
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:04,556
They were given
one week's notice.

330
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:08,127
It was middle
of the harvest and...

331
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:13,527
but still, yet we had
to abandon it and leave.

332
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:18,367
And so, of course, we made
arrangement with our friends.

333
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:20,727
"Hey, come and pick
the strawberries

334
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:23,047
"because it's ready
to be marketed."

335
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:25,686
And so I imagine they did that.

336
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:33,407
And so you put just essentials
in your suitcase.

337
00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:35,367
You know, first day,

338
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:38,727
when we had to pack up our thing
and go to the train,

339
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,116
I really wondered what's going
to happen to us?

00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:48,527
at Berkeley that spring.

342
00:24:48,527 --> 00:24:52,327
Her parents and her grandfather
were evacuated first,

343
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:55,727
because they had been born
in Japan.

344
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:59,167
She and her sister
were left behind for a time

345
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:02,407
to close
the family flower business.

346
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:06,207
We all somehow gathered the
flowers, bunched them and got

347
00:25:06,207 --> 00:25:08,927
them to the market, to the
flower market in San Francisco.

348
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:11,047
And so we were able to keep
the business going.

349
00:25:11,047 --> 00:25:13,847
And all those flowers didn't go
to waste, you know.

350
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:16,607
They were just in the height of
their beauty at that time

351
00:25:16,607 --> 00:25:20,805
of the year, getting ready
for Easter and all the holidays.

352
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:26,247
We were really...
kind of caught in the middle

353
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:29,407
when the war happened, although
no question about our loyalty

354
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:32,047
to our country, you know,
and how we felt.

355
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:33,727
(Voice breaks)
This is our country,

356
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:36,287
and when this whole evacuation
thing happened, I mean,

357
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:39,687
it was like we had no country,
because we weren't from Japan

358
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:45,447
and, and they took away our,
our rights, actually.

359
00:25:45,447 --> 00:25:48,127
We couldn't protest, and we
wouldn't have protested,

360
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:51,727
because we had to do what the
government told us to do.

361
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:55,727
And so, uh, I think our parents
realised, of course,

362
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:57,407
they were, you know,
not citizens,

363
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:59,847
so they accepted
the whole thing.

364
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:02,727
But for us,
I think it was a lot harder,

365
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,843
the fact that we had no rights.

NEWSREEL: This was
the Russian front in 1942.

368
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:34,847
The Germans advanced, looting,

369
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:37,167
torturing,
murdering as they went.

370
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:39,447
The casualties ran
into the millions.

371
00:26:39,447 --> 00:26:42,967
They had driven 1,000 miles
deep into Russian territory,

372
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:46,047
but Russia, with her
'scorched earth' policy,

373
00:26:46,047 --> 00:26:47,687
left nothing of value behind.

374
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:51,087
Wheat, which could not be
harvested, was set afire.

375

railroads, power plants.

NARRATOR: Although the German
invasion of the Soviet Union

377
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:02,967
had stalled outside Moscow,

378
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:07,327
with both sides suffering
unspeakable losses,

379
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:11,607
a new Nazi offensive
in the spring of 1942

380
00:27:11,607 --> 00:27:14,247
had sent more
than 225 divisions

381
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:17,487
steadily advancing
across Russia.

382
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:21,685
Millions of civilians
and soldiers died.

383
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:29,447
Soviet premier Josef Stalin
was demanding that the Allies

384
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,447
immediately open
a second front in the west

385
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:35,007
to relieve the pressure
on his beleaguered people.

386
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:39,287
But there was as yet

387
00:27:39,287 --> 00:27:43,447
not a single Allied soldier
fighting in western Europe,

388
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:46,007
and there would not be
for a long time.

389
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:53,317
They simply weren't ready.

390
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:59,247
American planners
had a straightforward idea

391
00:27:59,247 --> 00:28:00,927
of how to beat the Germans -

392
00:28:00,927 --> 00:28:04,607
invade France
in the spring of 1943

393
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:07,167
and drive right for Berlin.

394
00:28:09,247 --> 00:28:13,247
But the British were wary
of moving too fast.

395
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:16,807
"A defeat on the French coast,"
Winston Churchill warned,

396
00:28:16,807 --> 00:28:20,807
was, "the only way in which we
could possibly lose this war."

397
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:23,927
Instead, he favoured attacking

398
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:28,478
German and Italian forces
in North Africa.

399
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:35,927
American commanders
thought invading Africa

400
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:39,397
would be a dangerous
and wasteful diversion...

401
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:43,247
...but Congressional elections
were coming up.

402
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:45,247
American voters were eager

403
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:49,207
for more offensive action
against the Axis.

404
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:54,047
President Roosevelt
overruled his generals.

405
00:28:54,047 --> 00:28:57,198
The invasion of occupied France
would be delayed.

406
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:02,287
Instead, preparations were made
for American troops

407
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:06,678
to land in North Africa
at the end of 1942.

408
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:12,447
A bitter General George C.
Marshall, army chief of staff,

409
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:15,607
wrote privately that he
and his fellow commanders

410
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:18,927
had "failed to see
that the leader in a democracy

411
00:29:18,927 --> 00:29:21,680
"has to keep
the people entertained."

00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:48,967
SIDNEY PHILLIPS:
I did notice repeatedly

414
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:51,367
during the war that there would be

415
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:55,247
a sense of pride
in what you were a part of.

416
00:29:55,247 --> 00:29:59,207
You would feel
the power of the military.

417
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:03,607
You would feel the power
of the convoy you were in,

418
00:30:03,607 --> 00:30:07,807
the warships that
were surrounding you,

419
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:10,844
the weapons that you
were responsible for.

420
00:30:12,247 --> 00:30:15,047
It was a strange feeling.

421
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,607
You knew you were
in great danger,

422
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,607
but you somehow felt safe

423
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:22,566
in that you were a part
of this great, powerful group.

424
00:30:27,687 --> 00:30:30,007
NARRATOR:
In early August of 1942,

425
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:34,285
Private Sidney Phillips
of Mobile, Alabama,

426
00:30:34,327 --> 00:30:36,527
and the 19,000 men
of the First Marine Division

427
00:30:36,527 --> 00:30:38,807
steamed out
of Wellington, New Zealand

428
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:42,087
in a large convoy,
including all three

429
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:44,396
of America's carriers
in the South Pacific.

430
00:30:52,447 --> 00:30:57,007
Their target was
so remote, so obscure,

431
00:30:57,007 --> 00:31:00,761
that some of their officers
had trouble saying its name.

432
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:06,007
But that summer, Guadalcanal,
a 90-mile-long island

433
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:08,327
at the eastern end
of the Solomon chain,

434
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:11,327
covered with dense jungle
and coconut plantations,

435
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:14,687
had suddenly become one of the
most strategically important

436
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:17,687
spots in the Pacific.

437
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:19,487
Two separate commands

438
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:23,887
had the task of pushing
back the Japanese.

439
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:25,687
General Douglas MacArthur

440
00:31:25,687 --> 00:31:28,327
was in command
of the South-western Pacific,

441
00:31:28,327 --> 00:31:30,327
assigned to drive
from New Guinea

442
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:34,327
toward the Philippines
and Formosa.

443
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:37,007
Admiral Chester W. Nimitz
would use the marines

444
00:31:37,007 --> 00:31:41,327
to climb a longer ladder
up the Solomons, the Gilberts,

445
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:43,527
the Marshalls, the Marianas,

446
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:47,327
the Volcano Islands,
the Ryukus.

447
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:50,160
He would begin
in the Solomons.

448
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:56,007
The Japanese had made landings
there, and construction crews

449
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:59,238
were hard at work
on an airstrip on Guadalcanal.

450
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:03,367
If they were allowed
to complete it,

451
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:06,127
Japanese warplanes
could choke off shipping lanes

452
00:32:06,127 --> 00:32:09,047
between the United States
and Australia

453
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:13,962
and make the Allied
campaign impossible.

454
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:20,207
The marines, including
17-year-old Sid Phillips,

455
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:24,359
now a mortarman,
had been sent to stop them.

456
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:31,007
Their commander had assumed
his green troops would receive

457
00:32:31,007 --> 00:32:34,567
another six months of training
before they saw combat.

458
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,527
They were armed with old

459
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:39,207
single-shot,
bolt-action rifles.

460
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,087
They had only 10 days
worth of ammunition,

461
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:45,687
and in order to get them into
the fight as fast as possible

462
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:50,927
their supply stocks had been
reduced from 90 days to 60.

463
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:55,079
The men called it
'Operation Shoestring'.

464
00:33:06,687 --> 00:33:11,327
At dawn on August 7, 1942,

465
00:33:11,327 --> 00:33:13,887
American land forces
went on the offensive

466
00:33:13,887 --> 00:33:16,287
for the first time
in the Second World War.

467
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:21,207
No-one had any idea how long,
how bloody

468
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:26,487
and how consequential the battle
for Guadalcanal would be.

469
00:33:26,487 --> 00:33:30,247
Sid Phillips's platoon
was part of the second wave

470
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:32,238
of marines to go ashore.

471
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:35,167
"We had been repeatedly told

472
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:36,647
"this would be the first

473
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,687
"ship-to-shore landing," he remembered,

474
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:42,087
"and nobody could more
than guess if such an idea

475
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:43,567
"would be successful.

476
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:49,287
"We braced ourselves, and
the craft slid up on the beach.

477
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:53,727
"We charged out, ready
to do or die," Phillips said,

478
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:58,243
"and there was the first wave
sitting, laughing at us."

479
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:03,927
There was virtually
no opposition.

480
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:08,607
The first American casualty
on Guadalcanal was a marine

481
00:34:08,607 --> 00:34:10,687
who cut his hand
with a machete,

482
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:13,440
trying to open a coconut.

483
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:16,247
Americans seized
the unfinished airstrip

484
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:20,807
with little trouble
and renamed it Henderson Field

485
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:23,007
after a marine pilot
who was killed

486
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:24,647
during the Battle of Midway.

487
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:28,887
They began to prepare it
for American planes

488
00:34:28,887 --> 00:34:31,560
with signs that read,
"Under new management."

489
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:36,167
Their orders were
to hold the field at all cost.

490
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:40,967
The enemy couldn't
be allowed to retake it.

491
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:44,647
Then... the Japanese attacked.

492
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:49,675
The American fleet offshore
was their first target.

493
00:34:51,607 --> 00:34:55,964
PHILLIPS: The Japanese Navy came in
and sank all of our escorts.

494
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:12,327
NARRATOR: Four heavy cruisers
were lost, along with more than

495
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:15,327
1,800 American sailors.

496
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:17,487
PHILLIPS: They could have sunk
our supply ships, too,

497
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:19,367
but they didn't - it was at night,

498
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,407
and they didn't know
how successful they had been.

499
00:35:22,407 --> 00:35:25,567
But the next day,
all of our supplies left,

500
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:29,367
and we were... we were there
without ever unloading

501
00:35:29,367 --> 00:35:34,247
even our 10 days of supplies
that we had brought in with us.

502
00:35:34,247 --> 00:35:36,887
We would have starved to death
if there hadn't have been

503
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:39,959
a big supply
of Japanese rice there.

504
00:35:43,447 --> 00:35:46,847
NARRATOR: The marines
found themselves alone

505
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:50,567
and began to wonder if they,
like the men on Bataán,

506
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:53,081
had simply been abandoned.

507
00:35:56,727 --> 00:35:59,087
With no support
from the sea or the air,

508
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:01,760
the men were strafed
and bombed daily...

509
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,887
...pounded by shells
from Japanese ships offshore

510
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:12,407
and under attack
from enemy troops

511
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:15,080
hidden in the jungle.

512
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:19,487
PHILLIPS: We understood that
we might be expendable.

513
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:21,807
It had become
sort of the established thing,

514
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:27,967
and, uh, we knew our country
was not yet, uh, heavily armed.

515
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:32,047
And yes, we did, uh, feel
that we might be expendable.

516
00:36:32,047 --> 00:36:33,526
We really did.

517
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:55,007
NARRATOR: Phillips was among
those sent out to help recover

518
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:59,487
the bodies of marines
killed in an enemy ambush.

519
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:04,247
PHILLIPS: And it was about five miles
out to the ambush site

520
00:37:04,247 --> 00:37:08,087
where all the American bodies
had been mutilated.

521
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:10,847
They had been beheaded and, uh,

522
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:14,840
had their genitals, uh,
stuffed in their mouths, and...

523
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:20,887
Uh... our battalion
never took a prisoner

524
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:22,727
that I know of after that.

525
00:37:22,727 --> 00:37:25,007
I really...
I really don't remember

526
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:26,486
that we ever took a prisoner.

527
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:54,367
NARRATOR:
On the late afternoon of August 20,

528
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:57,687
after 13 harrowing days
on the island,

529
00:37:57,687 --> 00:38:00,447
Phillips heard the sound
of approaching aircraft

530
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:01,927
and took cover as usual.

531
00:38:01,927 --> 00:38:06,047
But this time,
the planes were American.

532
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:08,647
The marines cheered.

533
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:11,647
They were no longer alone.

534
00:38:11,647 --> 00:38:14,607
PHILLIPS: It looked like Uncle Sam
was going to fight

535
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:17,519
for that miserable place,
after all.

536
00:38:22,207 --> 00:38:25,567
NARRATOR: But at 2am
the next morning,

537
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:27,447
just hours after the first
American planes arrived,

538
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:31,527
a Japanese commander
sent 900 fresh troops

539
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:33,847
against marine positions
along the western bank

540
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:36,361
of a twisting jungle creek.

541
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:41,007
Its name was the llu River,
but because the maps

542
00:38:41,007 --> 00:38:43,647
the marines had been issued
had it wrong,

543
00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:46,287
the fierce firefight
that followed

544
00:38:46,287 --> 00:38:49,882
would be remembered
as the Battle of the Tenaru.

545
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:55,727
PHILLIPS: At that time
on Guadalcanal,

546
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:58,287
almost every night
there would be some event

547
00:38:58,287 --> 00:39:02,367
that would arouse everyone,
would keep everyone awake.

548
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:04,127
But this night it was different.

549
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:07,127
The whole world erupted,

550
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:12,687
and, uh... the lines became
just a wall of fire.

551
00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:15,567
We knew it was the real event.

552
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:18,327
NARRATOR: The Japanese commander
was so certain

553
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:20,167
he could destroy the marines

554
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:24,207
that in his diary he had
filled in the entry for the day -

555
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:26,047
"21 August.

556
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:28,766
"Enjoyed the fruits of victory."

557
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:33,647
The Japanese kept coming
all night.

558
00:39:33,647 --> 00:39:36,957
"Banzai," they screamed.
"Marine, you die!"

559
00:39:38,087 --> 00:39:40,965
The marines just kept shooting.

560
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:52,647
PHILLIPS: We killed, I think,
over 900 Japanese

561
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:56,207
and lost something like
34 marines.

562
00:39:56,207 --> 00:40:00,041
So it did our morale
a great deal of good.

563
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:07,687
NARRATOR: For the first time,

564
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:12,927
the supposedly invincible
lmperial Army had been stopped.

565
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:15,807
The humiliated commander,

566
00:40:15,807 --> 00:40:18,879
who had predicted victory,
shot himself.

567
00:40:21,847 --> 00:40:26,796
But the Battle of the Tenaru
settled nothing on Guadalcanal.

568
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:32,447
Japanese reinforcements
poured onto the island,

569
00:40:32,447 --> 00:40:35,519
and the fighting
just went on and on.

570
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,727
A confusing,
vicious war of ambush

571
00:40:48,727 --> 00:40:50,206
and counterattack.

572
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:53,247
A terrifying world

573
00:40:53,247 --> 00:40:56,487
where random Japanese shells
would explode

574
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:59,399
among the entrenched
and embattled Americans.

575
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:07,887
PHILLIPS:
Some men could take it,

576
00:41:07,887 --> 00:41:11,277
and, uh, some just physically
could not take it.

577
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:15,847
The sheer terror of knowing
that the next one

578
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:18,647
is going to have
your name on it -

579
00:41:18,647 --> 00:41:22,047
when that goes on
and on and on and on,

580
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:25,607
you... you-you get
a strange feeling

581
00:41:25,607 --> 00:41:28,687
in which you seem
to become detached,

582
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:31,527
and you just think,
"Well, maybe this will end

583
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:35,047
"and maybe it won't,
and maybe we'll all be blown up

584
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:37,047
"and maybe we won't,
but who cares?"

585
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:39,967
And you... you learn
to sort of live with it.

586
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:43,087
It is just a matter of fate.

587
00:41:43,087 --> 00:41:46,167
You will either survive
if the Lord is willing

588
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:47,647
or you will not.

589
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:50,002
So there's really nothing
you can do.

590
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:53,802
And you just take it.

591
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:03,687
NARRATOR: Private Sid Phillips
turned 18 on September 2.

592
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,207
The next day, he got
his first letter from home

593
00:42:07,207 --> 00:42:09,967
since he'd sailed
for Guadalcanal.

594
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:12,287
It was, he wrote back,

595
00:42:12,287 --> 00:42:15,597
"the best birthday present
possible for me".

596
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:24,687
In late September,

597
00:42:24,687 --> 00:42:28,965
some American reinforcements
finally made it through.

598
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:35,887
But nightly visits
by fast-moving Japanese ships

599
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,447
the marines called
the Tokyo Express

600
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:41,007
kept the enemy on the island

601
00:42:41,007 --> 00:42:44,841
supplied and reinforced
as well.

602
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:52,367
Twice, the Japanese,

603
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:54,727
determined
to retake Henderson Field,

604
00:42:54,727 --> 00:42:57,685
mounted full-scale assaults
on the airstrip.

605
00:42:59,047 --> 00:43:02,607
Twice, the marines
beat them back.

606
00:43:02,607 --> 00:43:06,441
Thousands of Japanese were
shot dead or blown to pieces.

607
00:43:30,887 --> 00:43:32,887
Week after week,

608
00:43:32,887 --> 00:43:36,243
the battle for Guadalcanal
ground on.

609
00:43:44,327 --> 00:43:45,807
On November 12,

610
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:49,287
the Japanese Navy mounted
one last major offensive,

611
00:43:49,287 --> 00:43:51,927
aimed at reinforcing
their forces

612
00:43:51,927 --> 00:43:55,237
and dislodging the Americans
on Guadalcanal.

613
00:43:56,607 --> 00:44:00,007
A much smaller number
of American ships steamed in

614
00:44:00,007 --> 00:44:02,316
to try to stop them.

615
00:44:03,847 --> 00:44:06,007
The naval battle that followed

616
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:08,805
went on for three days
and three nights.

617
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:13,687
PHILLIPS: You could see
the salvos of the ships,

618
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:16,647
and you could see
the naval shells

619
00:44:16,647 --> 00:44:19,367
going through the air
like lightning bugs.

620
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,447
And you could see ships explode.

621
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:24,087
We didn't know if they
were American or Japanese.

622
00:44:24,087 --> 00:44:26,237
We didn't know who was winning
or who was losing.

623
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:31,807
Sometimes when a ship
would explode, it would...

624
00:44:31,807 --> 00:44:34,447
the concussion would actually
flap your clothes

625
00:44:34,447 --> 00:44:36,967
miles and miles away.

626
00:44:36,967 --> 00:44:40,527
But we did know that
our fate was being decided

627
00:44:40,527 --> 00:44:44,047
and we would, uh, we would...

628
00:44:44,047 --> 00:44:47,847
sit there sort of mystified
and horrified

629
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:50,607
by what was going on,
because we knew

630
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:54,361
thousands of sailors were
dying on one side or the other.

631
00:45:01,527 --> 00:45:05,007
NARRATOR: Some 5,000
American sailors lost their lives

632
00:45:05,007 --> 00:45:07,567
in the fighting
off Guadalcanal -

633
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:10,887
so many...
that the casualty figures

634
00:45:10,887 --> 00:45:13,959
were again kept from the public.

635
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:18,087
Among those who died

636
00:45:18,087 --> 00:45:20,847
were five brothers
from Fredericksburg, lowa,

637
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:24,087
who all served
on the cruiser 'Juneau' -

638
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:27,007
Joseph, Francis, Albert,

639
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:30,397
Madison and George Sullivan.

640
00:45:32,327 --> 00:45:35,767
But Japan lost two battleships,

641
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:37,967
23 other warships,

642
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:40,207
600 aircraft,

643
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:43,756
and thousands
of sailors and airmen.

644
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:47,447
And most important
to Sid Phillips

645
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:51,287
and the men on Guadalcanal,
the enemy was no longer able

646
00:45:51,287 --> 00:45:54,767
to resupply its forces
on the island.

647
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:58,727
The Japanese continued to fight,

648
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:03,527
but it was clear the Americans
would eventually prevail.

649
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:08,207
The last starving, desperate
Japanese troops on the island

650
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:11,527
would not be killed,
captured or evacuated

651
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:14,599
until February 1943.

652
00:46:16,047 --> 00:46:20,677
21,000 Japanese soldiers
were lost.

653
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:27,286
Guadalcanal would prove
a crucial victory.

654
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:32,247
After six long months,

655
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,367
the Americans were beginning
to learn how to beat

656
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:36,927
the Japanese -
not only in the air

657
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,847
and on the sea,
but in the jungles,

658
00:46:39,847 --> 00:46:42,807
where, over the next
three years,

659
00:46:42,807 --> 00:46:45,526
the fighting would
only get worse.

660
00:46:47,607 --> 00:46:52,767
Allied shipping lanes
to Australia remained open.

661
00:46:52,767 --> 00:46:55,447
And there was more good news.

662
00:46:55,447 --> 00:46:58,727
American and Australian forces
had also taken

663
00:46:58,727 --> 00:47:02,847
the most important Japanese
strongholds on New Guinea.

664
00:47:02,847 --> 00:47:06,556
Japan's expansion
had been stopped.

665
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:10,447
PHILLIPS: By the time
we left Guadalcanal,

666
00:47:10,447 --> 00:47:14,607
which was December 22 of 1942,

667
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:17,807
we had been there
since August 7 -

668
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:21,887
everybody had lost
at least 25 pounds.

669
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:25,926
Our clothes were in rags.
We were covered with sores.

670
00:47:29,007 --> 00:47:32,044
And we had nearly starved
to death two or three times.

671
00:47:40,847 --> 00:47:43,807
KATHARINE PHILLIPS:
We did not realise

672
00:47:43,807 --> 00:47:47,687
how desperate the marines
were on Guadalcanal

673
00:47:47,687 --> 00:47:50,884
because the news never told us.

674
00:47:56,287 --> 00:48:01,327
In fact, it was not till years
later when Sidney came home

675
00:48:01,327 --> 00:48:05,647
that we found that their food
was down to fish heads and rice.

676
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:08,847
And that he was down
to 125 pounds

677
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:11,077
when they took him off
of Guadalcanal.

678
00:48:14,327 --> 00:48:19,967
NARRATOR: More than 1,700
Americans had died on Guadalcanal.

679
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:24,767
Another 4,700 were wounded,

680
00:48:24,767 --> 00:48:28,726
and thousands more
were seriously ill.

681
00:48:33,647 --> 00:48:36,207
Sid Phillips had survived.

682
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:43,207
But his Uncle Charles Tucker,
a navy pilot

683
00:48:43,207 --> 00:48:48,156
who had flown in and out
of Henderson Field, had not.

00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:57,887
KATHARINE PHILLIPS: When we lost
Charlie, it made it very real to all of us.

685
00:48:57,887 --> 00:49:03,767
And by that time, we had started
losing boys in the neighbourhood.

686
00:49:03,767 --> 00:49:07,367
The boy up here on the corner
was a navy pilot

687
00:49:07,367 --> 00:49:08,927
and he was killed.

688
00:49:08,927 --> 00:49:12,167
The boy down the street
was an air force pilot

689
00:49:12,167 --> 00:49:15,007
and he was missing in action.

690
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:19,247
We just... they started
disappearing all around us.

691
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,927
And my mother spent her time

692
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:26,167
going to visit the other
mothers, consoling them.

693
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:29,687
And it was a very,
very fearful time.

694
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:31,167
It really was.

695
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:36,727
You don't expect death
among people your age.

696
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:38,407
Old people die.

697
00:49:38,407 --> 00:49:41,767
And then, you begin to see

698
00:49:41,767 --> 00:49:44,687
that it's your contemporaries
are dying.

699
00:49:44,687 --> 00:49:47,807
And therefore,
it is just conceivable

700
00:49:47,807 --> 00:49:50,207
that you might die, too.

('AMERICAN ANTHEM' PLAYS)

702
00:49:57,167 --> 00:50:01,247
NARRATOR: Luverne, Minnesota,
had been lucky so far.

703
00:50:01,247 --> 00:50:05,727
No local family had lost
a son in the war.

704
00:50:05,727 --> 00:50:08,887
But in Sacramento,

705
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:11,327
Mrs Lillian Cole had
received news

706
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:15,127
that her son David had perished
on the USS 'Arizona'

707
00:50:15,127 --> 00:50:16,807
at Pearl Harbor.

708
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:20,207
She had been asked
by the government

709
00:50:20,207 --> 00:50:22,207
"to keep secret for the present

710
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:25,438
"the name of the ship
on which he served."

711
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:30,647
Another Sacramento native,
airman Tom Burke,

712
00:50:30,647 --> 00:50:34,327
died on a training mission
in Puerto Rico,

713
00:50:34,327 --> 00:50:36,636
devastating
his younger brother, Earl.

714
00:50:40,047 --> 00:50:44,647
In Waterbury, the family of
marine private Albert Boulanger

715
00:50:44,647 --> 00:50:48,007
learned that he had been killed
on Guadalcanal,

716
00:50:48,007 --> 00:50:52,558
not far from where Sid Phillips
of Mobile had been fighting.

717
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:05,527
Glenn Frazier was still
a prisoner of the Japanese,

718
00:51:05,527 --> 00:51:09,287
but the girl he loved back
in Alabama had changed her mind

719
00:51:09,287 --> 00:51:13,758
and was now waiting for him
to come home to her.
