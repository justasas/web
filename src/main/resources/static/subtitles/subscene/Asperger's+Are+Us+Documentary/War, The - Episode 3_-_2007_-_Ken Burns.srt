          BURT WILSON:          
  The war was always around us. 

36
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:52,063
 We had an air raid warden, uh, 
  a block warden on the street, 

37
00:03:52,164 --> 00:03:55,600
      who wore a white hat      
         and a gas mask.        

38
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:57,969
 None of the rest of us had any.

39
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,805
     Across the street from     
     my house on 46th Street    

40
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:04,175
  there was an empty lot, so we 
  built a victory garden there. 

41
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:08,513
  And of course we all relished 
         the vegetables         

42
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:11,116
    that came up the fastest.   

43
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,723
            NARRATOR:           
      The war was now being     
      felt by every citizen     

44
00:04:18,824 --> 00:04:21,158
    in every town in America.   

45
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:24,129
         In fast-growing        
     Sacramento, California,    

46
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,566
  and quiet Luverne, Minnesota, 
 even children found themselves 

47
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:32,404
     caught up in the effort    
         to win victory.        

48
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:36,474
     Waterbury, Connecticut,    
      and Mobile, Alabama,      

49
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:38,876
      had been transformed      
        into "war towns"        

50
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:40,178
       almost overnight--       

51
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,614
          and in Mobile         
       that transformation      

52
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:48,086
   would lead to confrontation  
       and ugly violence.       

53
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:57,862
    Overseas, victory seemed    
      a very long way off.      

54
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,783
 Americans had landed in Italy--

55
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:24,488
    and then found themselves   
 stopped by terrain and weather 

56
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,791
    and an implacable enemy.    

57
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:32,530
  There was still no firm date  
 for the cross-channel invasion,

58
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:35,934
          without which         
 the Nazi grip on Western Europe

59
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,502
     could never be broken.     

60
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,639
     In the Pacific theater,    

61
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,674
       more than a million      
         Japanese troops        

62
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:45,776
were on the offensive in central
       and southern China       

63
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:50,014
 against the nationalist forces 
       of Chiang Kai-shek       

64
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:51,950
      and his sometime ally     

65
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,453
           Mao Zedong.          

66
00:05:55,587 --> 00:05:58,922
   The Americans were fighting  
         on Bougainville        

67
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:02,093
     and preparing to attack    
      the Gilbert Islands.      

68
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:08,266
      But Tokyo was almost      
       4,000 miles away--       

69
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,469
     and the Japanese seemed    
         ready to defend        

70
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:14,906
 every island chain in between. 

71
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:21,112
     Over the coming months,    
  Quentin Aanenson of Luverne,  

72
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:22,814
  who saw the romance of flight 

73
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,749
         as his way out         
    of the hardscrabble life    

74
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,552
   his farmer father had led,   
       would begin to see       

75
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,022
that there were bitter realities
           in the sky           

76
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:34,725
  of which he'd never dreamed.  

77
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,930
        Robert Kashiwagi,       
       a Japanese-American      

78
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,131
   from the Sacramento Valley,  

79
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:42,533
 whose family had been interned 
        by their country        

80
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:44,936
         simply because         
       of their ancestry,       

81
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,973
  would nonetheless demonstrate 
  his devotion to that country  

82
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:53,477
   as few Americans ever have.  

83
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,948
   Family memories of heroism   
        in an earlier war       

84
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,451
  would help propel a Princeton 
      man from Connecticut      

85
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:03,588
      named Ward Chamberlin     
     to find a way to serve     

86
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:08,159
  despite handicaps that could  
   have kept him safe at home.  

87
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,598
   And Babe Ciarlo, a factory   
     worker from Waterbury,     

88
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,967
 would see things no one should 
       ever have to see--       

89
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:22,973
  and say nothing about them in 
  his optimistic letters home.  

90
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:28,546
 Everywhere, the war was tearing
        Americans apart,        

91
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:30,714
  and bringing them together--  

92
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:37,855
  and infusing every detail of  
daily life with a new intensity.

93
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:49,767
          PAUL FUSSELL:         
    Every family had somebody   
           in the war.          

94
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,202
   and almost every household   

95
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:54,873
      had somebody wounded      
      or killed or missing.     

96
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,510
Everybody had some bad news they
   didn't want to talk about.   

97
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,179
 And it was very bad to bring up
  the subject among strangers.  

98
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,414
   You'd say, "How you doing?"  

99
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:06,283
  Well, he'd say, "Well, my son 
       was killed in Anzio      

100
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:11,255
      And so your relation      
   to strangers was different   

101
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:12,624
      from what it is now.      

102
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:18,496
 People were likely to tell you 
   if things were intolerable.  

103
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:37,381
       JOHN HOPE FRANKLIN:      
           I went down          
    to the recruiting office,   

104
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:39,984
   the Navy, and volunteered.   

105
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:44,088
          I volunteered         
     in response to the call    

106
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:45,656
   that they made specifically  

107
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:50,194
   for men to man the offices.  

108
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:56,400
The recruiter for the Navy said,
       "What can you do?"       

109
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:59,803
    I said, "Well, I can, uh,   
      I can run an office.      

110
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:05,343
I can type, I can take shorthand
       if that's needed."       

111
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,012
     I said, "And, oh, yes,     
         I have a Ph.D.         

112
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:11,282
    in history from Harvard."   

113
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:14,051
         And I wondered         
    what he was going to say.   

114
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:17,588
       He said, "You have       
     everything but color."     

115
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:20,491
    And, uh, I said, "Well, I   
 thought there was an emergency,

116
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:24,662
   but obviously there's not,   
    so I bid you a good day."   

117
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:29,767
      And I vowed that day      
   that they would not get me,  

118
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:32,102
because they did not deserve me.

119
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:38,242
         If I was able--        
      physically, mentally,     

120
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:39,743
    every other kind of way,    
        able and willing        

121
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,014
      to serve my country--     
  and my country turned me down 

122
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:48,119
 on the basis of color, then my 
   country did not deserve me.  

123
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,254
      And I vowed then that     
     they would not get me.     

124
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:56,360
            NARRATOR:           
       John Hope Franklin       
     would keep that pledge     

125
00:09:56,461 --> 00:10:00,631
         and never serve        
      in the armed forces.      

126
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,166
    He would go on to become    

127
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:06,137
    one of the country's most   
    distinguished historians.   

128
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,684
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
         By January 1st,        
    Congress had appropriated   

129
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:22,186
    over two billion dollars    

130
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:26,991
      for emergency housing     
  in America's war boom towns.  

131
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:29,460
      Here's how some of it     
      was spent in Mobile.      

132
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:31,195
       These are the slums      
          we have seen.         

133
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:36,133
Slum clearance projects had been
  the local, private enterprise 

134
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:38,969
      of a few high-minded,     
    far-sighted individuals.    

135
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,839
         But in Mobile,         
     such projects as these     

136
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,243
     have become one of the     
 obligations of good government.

137
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:54,284
     They are rented only to    
  certified colored war workers 

138
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:56,620
      and are equipped with     
    auditoriums, playgrounds,   

139
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:58,822
        and day nurseries       
  to take care of the children  

140
00:10:58,923 --> 00:11:02,593
 while their parents are working
       in the war plants.       

141
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:10,134
            NARRATOR:           
    To relieve the desperate    
     overcrowding in Mobile,    

142
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:14,839
   the National Housing Agency  
      provided 14,000 units     

143
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,206
       for white workers--      

144
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:22,179
but fewer than 1,000 for blacks.

145
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,883
   There were 30,000 African-   
   Americans in the city now--  

146
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:29,720
    and just 55 hospital beds   
      that would take them.     

147
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:34,458
           JOHN GRAY:           
 You had a white water fountain 
   and a black water fountain.  

148
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,026
        And a black would       
        get into trouble        

149
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:39,730
     if he went and drank at    
    the white water fountain.   

150
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:43,066
   My friend at Brookley Field  
  had his head busted wide open 

151
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,869
        because he drank        
     at the white fountain.     

152
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:51,308
            NARRATOR:           
      16-year-old John Gray     
       of 407 Royal Street      

153
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,277
         was working as         
      a carpenter's helper      

154
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:56,813
       at Alabama Dry Dock      
      before the war began.     

155
00:11:56,914 --> 00:12:00,651
   There had been then no way   
      for a black employee      

156
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:03,821
   to be upgraded to the ranks  
       of skilled workers.      

157
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:07,491
Similar discrimination was found
      in defense industries     

158
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:09,226
  throughout the Jim Crow South 

159
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:12,029
       and in other parts       
     of the country as well.    

160
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,134
 But black leaders had insisted 
 on more jobs for black workers,

161
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:19,503
     and President Roosevelt    
         had established        

162
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:21,572
   a Fair Employment Practices  
           Commission           

163
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:26,043
    to combat discrimination    
       in defense plants.       

164
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:28,579
 Things were beginning to change

165
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,783
  even for the African-American 
       citizens of Mobile.      

166
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:37,755
              GRAY:             
    A lot of black people who   
  used to work in private homes 

167
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:40,724
     as cooks and chauffeurs    
            and maids           

168
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,360
   got jobs at Brookley Field.  

169
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:46,197
  And it created some tension.  

170
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:48,699
     One white person asked     
         a black person,        

171
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,502
    "Do you know where I can    
      find me a good girl?      

172
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:55,306
    I'll give her $25 a week    
          and carfare."         

173
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,340
  And the black woman told her, 

174
00:12:56,441 --> 00:13:01,745
      "If you can find one,     
       I'll give her $35."      

175
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,252
            NARRATOR:           
    With change came trouble.   

176
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:15,493
  In August of 1942, a city bus 
  driver named Grover Chandler  

177
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:20,131
 shot and killed Henry Williams,
   a black private in uniform,  

178
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:24,368
    after he refused to move    
     to the back of the bus.    

179
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:27,471
              GRAY:             
          And they put          
     the bus driver in jail,    

180
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:32,009
      but they boasted that     
   he never stayed in a cell.   

181
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,614
   They let him sleep on a cot  
     that the sheriff used.     

182
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,182
    And then they let him out   
           eventually.          

183
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:41,819
    It died down, but nothing   
  was done to the man actually. 

184
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,756
            NARRATOR:           
   Tensions continued to rise.  

185
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:49,994
       On Tuesday morning,      
          May 25, 1943,         

186
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:53,430
        they exploded at        
 the Alabama Dry Dock shipyard, 

187
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:56,801
    after management gave in    
     to a federal directive     

188
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:03,607
   and agreed to let 12 black   
     workers become welders.    

189
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:07,511
           CLYDE ODUM:          
      We were training them     

190
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:11,515
    to be burners and welders   
      and become mechanics.     

191
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,418
      And the white people      
        was resenting it.       

192
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:20,257
            NARRATOR:           
  Shortly after the new welders 
 had finished their first shift,

193
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:21,859
    white shipyard employees    

194
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,462
    set upon the first blacks   
   they could find, shouting,   

195
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:29,733
       "No nigger is going      
   to join iron in this yard."  

196
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:36,007
              ODUM:             
 I'm standing up there watching,

197
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:42,946
  and I never saw people so mad 
    and agitated in my life.    

198
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:47,684
     And they'd have sticks,    
      like three-foot long.     

199
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,620
   They would knock them down   
         to their knees.        

200
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:57,061
  I saw men and women bleeding, 
 blood running down their face, 

201
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,264
 and they didn't stand a chance 
   coming down that gauntlet,   

202
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:04,668
   men and women on each side   
    beating them with sticks.   

203
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:07,337
  And a good many of the blacks 

204
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,006
     went out and jumped off    
           the piers,           

205
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:11,875
    tried to swim the river.    

206
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:15,379
    Coast Guard was out there   
        picking them up.        

207
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:21,418
              GRAY:             
         The riot upset         
      the whole community.      

208
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,288
     Most people who worked     
     were afraid to go back,    

209
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,725
 because there would be a bunch 
        standing outside        

210
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:31,228
       and they would have      
       their cars parked.       

211
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:34,598
   And in their cars they had   
         monkey wrenches        

212
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:40,137
         and tire irons         
      and stuff like that.      

213
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:44,742
            NARRATOR:           
  More than 1,000 black workers 
  formally requested transfers  

214
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,277
     to other defense jobs.     

215
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,447
    The requests were denied.   

216
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:53,217
  Some left Mobile altogether,  

217
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,587
     but most were persuaded    
       to stay on the job.      

218
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:00,157
 We had to send out and get them
       and haul them back       

219
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:01,424
     because we needed them     
         to do the work.        

220
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:07,131
   And they came back because   
  we begged them to come back.  

221
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:11,735
              GRAY:             
And they would not go back until
    they had some protection.   

222
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,073
  When they went back, this is  
 when you had to separate them. 

223
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:22,913
     Normally, one ferryboat    
    would take whoever came.    

224
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:27,818
  But after the riots, they had 
 a ferryboat to take blacks over

225
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,457
         and a ferryboat        
      to take whites over.      

226
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:37,961
            NARRATOR:           
 In the end, the shipyard itself
         was segregated.        

227
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:41,831
   Four separate shipways were  
 created where blacks were free 

228
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:45,936
 to hold every kind of position,
         except foreman.        

229
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:48,472
   Blacks working in the rest   
         of the shipyard        

230
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:52,376
    remained largely confined   
 to the kind of unskilled tasks 

231
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:53,910
   they had always performed.   

232
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:58,281
 The African-American newspaper 
     <i> The Pittsburgh Courier</i>    

233
00:16:58,382 --> 00:17:03,821
  denounced the compromise as a 
 victory for "Nazi racial theory

234
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,157
       "and another defeat      
   for the principle embodied   

235
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:12,262
       in the Declaration       
        of Independence."       

236
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,270
 In the following months, there 
   were racial confrontations   

237
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,773
       in industrial areas      
    all across the country--    

238
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:27,278
   Springfield, Massachusetts,  
     and Port Arthur, Texas;    

239
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,048
         Hubbard, Ohio,         
     and Newark, New Jersey;    

240
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:35,686
 and in Detroit, where 34 people
           were killed          

241
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:39,456
   and more than 200 wounded.   

242
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,595
      Despite the violence,     

243
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:49,633
 the war was profoundly altering
   life for African-Americans.  

244
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:54,772
     Membership in the NAACP    
       increased ninefold.      

245
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:59,143
The Committee of Racial Equality
   demanded the desegregation   

246
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:03,847
    of restaurants, theaters,   
           bus lines.           

247
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:11,054
   Andthe<i> Pittsburgh Courier</i>    
campaigned for double victory-  
               -                

248
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:17,528
   over the enemies of freedom  
  at home as well as overseas.  

249
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,636
          (explosions)          

250
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:05,676
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
Going back through these letters
  written to me during the war, 

251
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:09,546
   I find almost every letter   
          will mention,         

252
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,382
   "We had a v-mail from Sid."  

253
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:17,988
     He was the main concern    
      of the entire family.     

254
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:21,024
  Daddy would try to anticipate 

255
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:25,796
        where he thought        
     Sid would be sent next.    

256
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:29,666
       And when the Battle      
       of Tarawa occurred,      

257
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:33,136
       we lived in horror       
         for five days.         

258
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:37,641
      We thought Sidney was     
    in the Battle of Tarawa.    

259
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:40,910
            NARRATOR:           
       Katharine Phillips'      
          brother Sid,          

260
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:44,280
 who had endured four harrowing 
     months on Guadalcanal,     

261
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:49,353
   was actually in New Guinea   
in November of 1943, not Tarawa,

262
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:53,056
    preparing for an assault    
       on Cape Gloucester,      

263
00:19:53,157 --> 00:19:56,126
       on the western tip       
         of New Britain.        

264
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:26,957
        SIDNEY PHILLIPS:        
    It rained the entire time   
   we were at Cape Gloucester.  

265
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:30,127
       Everything rotted.       

266
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:34,198
         Clothes rotted,        
    your shoestrings rotted.    

267
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:42,439
  All the wounded were brought  
     right by our position,     

268
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,641
        and that was when       
     I decided I would like     

269
00:20:44,775 --> 00:20:50,547
     to do something in life    
 that would amount to something.

270
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:54,384
   And I decided that I wanted  
   to study medicine that day.  

271
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:57,387
        Because here were       
        all these wounded       

272
00:20:57,488 --> 00:21:00,857
      and there was no way      
     that I could help them.    

273
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:05,295
            NARRATOR:           
   Cape Gloucester would be a   
 rugged, bloody jungle campaign,

274
00:21:05,396 --> 00:21:09,065
   but Phillips was fortunate   
   not to be among the Marines  

275
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,268
     ordered to take Tarawa.    

276
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:19,342
     The hard-won victories     
    at Midway and Guadalcanal   

277
00:21:19,443 --> 00:21:22,813
   had ended Japan's expansion  
         in the Pacific.        

278
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:29,119
The Americans were free to begin
  their two-pronged offensive.  

279
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,788
      While General Douglas     
       MacArthur's forces       

280
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:35,191
   moved north from Australia   
     toward the Philippines,    

281
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:38,795
         the Navy, under        
   Admiral Chester W. Nimitz,   

282
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:43,133
    began its advance across    
      the Central Pacific.      

283
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:48,004
 Tarawa was part of the Gilbert 
     chain, a coral atoll--     

284
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:51,508
    a ring of 38 tiny islands   
     around a blue lagoon--     

285
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,578
that marked the easternmost edge
        of the perimeter        

286
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:57,681
    Japan had built to shield   
         its new empire.        

287
00:21:57,782 --> 00:22:01,485
       The main target was      
   a heavily fortified island   

288
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,852
        with an airstrip.       

289
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:07,090
   It was only a little larger  
  than New York's Central Park, 

290
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:11,829
 but defended by 4,500 Japanese 
        Imperial Marines,       

291
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,065
      hidden within a maze      
   of rifle pits and trenches   

292
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:18,168
 and hundreds of interconnected 
           blockhouses          

293
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:21,971
     and concrete pillboxes.    

294
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,944
 Tarawa was to be the test case 

295
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:29,546
        for a new theory        
     of amphibious warfare:     

296
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:33,517
      any island, no matter     
     how fiercely defended,     

297
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:39,289
        could be taken by       
   an all-out frontal assault.  

298
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:44,528
      The official version      
    for the people back home    

299
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:48,932
       was that everything      
       was going smoothly.      

300
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,335
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
 The invasion force of warships 
      and transports steams     

301
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:54,637
        for the conquest        
     of the Gilbert Islands,    

302
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:57,640
       and aboard vessels       
      crowded with troops,      

303
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:59,576
  religious services are held.  

304
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:01,011
The worshippers are fighting men

305
00:23:01,112 --> 00:23:03,513
     who know they are going    
      into desperate peril,     

306
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:06,049
     where many are destined    
      to give their lives.      

307
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,285
        And now, official       
      Navy motion pictures      

308
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:13,657
 of the bombardment of the Japs 
  on Tarawa with giant salvos.  

309
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:46,256
            NARRATOR:           
  But the bombing and shelling  
      yielded so much smoke     

310
00:23:46,357 --> 00:23:48,157
         and coral dust         
      that the fleet's view     

311
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:52,796
      of the landing craft      
          was obscured.         

312
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:59,136
   Firing was stopped for half  
    an hour to clear the air,   

313
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,771
         plenty of time         
        for the Japanese        

314
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,141
       to ready themselves      
        for the assault.        

315
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:17,653
       The landing craft,       
   meant to ferry the Marines   

316
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:19,790
       of the 2nd Division      
       close to the beach,      

317
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:24,595
   hung up on the coral reef,   
  easy targets for enemy guns.  

318
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,429
       (machine gun fire)       

319
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,931
         Men were forced        
      to wade shoulder-deep     

320
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:31,268
      for hundreds of yards     
        under enemy fire.       

321
00:24:32,303 --> 00:24:36,840
         The first wave         
    suffered<i> some</i> casualties.   

322
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:38,842
    The second was badly hit.   

323
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,280
 The third... nearly destroyed. 

324
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:50,987
   By nightfall, 5,000 Marines  
  had made it to the beaches--  

325
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:58,595
     but some 1,500 of them     
   had been killed or wounded.  

326
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:02,699
    Maurice Bell, a neighbor    
  of Sid Phillips from Mobile,  

327
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,035
    had watched the landings    
       with his binoculars      

328
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:08,638
          from the deck         
    of the USS<i> Indianapolis.</i>    

329
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:15,278
              BELL:             
    I could see the fighting    
     going on on the island,    

330
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:18,014
    just like if it was just    
     across the street here.    

331
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:23,253
 Looked like it was that close. 

332
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:28,892
 And soldiers and sai... Marines
   falling all over the place   

333
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:31,862
        and you could see       
      bodies in the water.      

334
00:25:31,962 --> 00:25:37,033
     And it's something that    
   I hope never happens again   

335
00:25:37,134 --> 00:25:40,636
        because it's just       
      things that happened      

336
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:43,006
 at that time I'll never forget.

337
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:24,614
            NARRATOR:           
   "A million men cannot take   
   Tarawa in a hundred years,"  

338
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:29,452
     the Japanese commander     
   had said before the battle.  

339
00:26:29,553 --> 00:26:35,759
      It took ten thousand      
     Marines just four days.    

340
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,162
          But more than         
        one third of them       

341
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:44,000
   had been killed or wounded.  

342
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:48,271
      The Marine commander      
         told the press         

343
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:50,306
 Tarawa had fallen only because 

344
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:54,344
     so many young Americans    
    had been willing to die.    

345
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,217
   Outraged parents denounced   
      him for callousness.      

346
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:25,175
 Eventually, the War Department 
         reversed policy        

347
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:29,579
   and produced a film called   
  <i> With the Marines at Tarawa,</i>  

348
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,582
    containing combat footage   
           more brutal          

349
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:36,420
     than anything ordinary     
    Americans had ever seen.    

350
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:39,389
       Some in Washington       
     argued that its release    

351
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,993
    would damage morale, but    
   President Roosevelt himself  

352
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,595
    ordered that it be shown.   

353
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:47,097
(film running through projector)

354
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,532
     ("Marine Hymn" playing)    

355
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:51,267
   He wanted to give Americans  
         a clearer sense        

356
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:53,536
 of what their men were facing. 

357
00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:57,407
         FILM NARRATOR:         
        These are the men       
   of the 2nd Marine Division,  

358
00:27:57,508 --> 00:27:58,874
      who are now embarking     

359
00:27:58,976 --> 00:28:01,244
      on a full amphibious      
     operation after many...    

360
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:05,916
        When we saw those       
    first pictures of Tarawa,   

361
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:08,618
        we were overcome,       

362
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,987
         FILM NARRATOR:         
      For three days before     
          we moved in,          

363
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:14,091
    over four million pounds    
          of explosives         

364
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:18,962
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
 It was just devastating to us. 

365
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:22,966
   Those American boys' bodies  
      floating in the surf.     

366
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:25,334
         FILM NARRATOR:         
    The chaplain's assistants   
         tend the dead.         

367
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:27,403
           KATHARINE:           
  We just sat around and cried, 

368
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:30,740
        and I know that's       
       why they'd kept it       

369
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:33,943
    from the American public    
          for so long.          

370
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,979
         FILM NARRATOR:         
     These are Marine dead.     

371
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,319
This is the price we have to pay
    for a war we didn't want.   

372
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:48,024
           KATHARINE:           
       Our dislike for the      
   Japanese was very violent,   

373
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,460
  that they would do this to us 

374
00:28:51,561 --> 00:28:55,332
         and would kill         
       our boys like that.      

375
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:02,905
     And, 'course, the idea     
      was "Kill the Japs."      

376
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:07,476
       I'm ashamed to say,      
   but that's the way it was.   

377
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:13,717
       We just had to get       
       that war over with.      

378
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:37,340
            NARRATOR:           
  Mrs. Martina Ciarlo, a widow  
   in Waterbury, Connecticut,   

379
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:40,877
        had two daughters       
         and three sons.        

380
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:45,648
   were exempt from the draft   
       and safely at home,      

381
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,185
       but the middle son,      
    Corado, known as "Babe,"    

382
00:29:49,286 --> 00:29:55,825
 was with the Fifth Allied Army 
       somewhere in Italy.      

383
00:29:55,926 --> 00:30:01,063
  were the most important thing 
      in his mother's life.     

384
00:30:01,265 --> 00:30:04,401
          OLGA CIARLO:          
 She'd wait every single morning
          on the porch          

385
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:08,171
     for the mailman to come    
     to bring her a letter.     

386
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:12,776
  And he would go by sometimes, 
        and he would say,       

387
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:15,545
    "Mrs. Ciarlo, not today."   

388
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:19,082
 So the following day she'd wait
      again for that letter     

389
00:30:19,182 --> 00:30:21,484
    and finally she would get   
  a letter, she'd be so happy.  

390
00:30:21,585 --> 00:30:24,587
  She'd run upstairs and she'd  
     let us read the letter,    

391
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:26,089
        'cause my mother        
     couldn't read English.     

392
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:29,492
        And we would read       
        the letter to her       

393
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:33,663
 and she'd be happy just knowing
    that she heard from him.    

394
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:39,869
    BABE CIARLO (dramatized):   
        "Mom, how are you       
         getting along?         

395
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,906
         "Fine, I hope,         
    and keeping happy always.   

396
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,710
    "I know I haven't written   
     to you for a long time     

397
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:50,446
       "the Army has been       
     keeping me pretty busy.    

398
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:53,316
        "I'm doing good,        
        and always happy        

399
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:55,585
  "because I know you're okay.  

400
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:57,687
          Love, Babe."          

401
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:05,662
         DANIEL INOUYE:         
        Consider the fact       
       that I'm 18, so...       

402
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:09,766
        your emotions are       
     that of a young person.    

403
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:15,504
    I was angered to realize    
     that my government felt    

404
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:20,243
       that I was disloyal      
     and part of the enemy,     

405
00:31:20,344 --> 00:31:25,281
          and I wanted          
   to be able to demonstrate,   

406
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:28,484
   not only to my government,   
      but to my neighbors,      

407
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:32,688
           that, uh...          
     I was a good American.     

408
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:42,098
            NARRATOR:           
       After Pearl Harbor,      

409
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:46,035
     Washington had ordered     
  some 110,000 Japanese aliens  

410
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:49,005
      and American citizens     
       of Japanese descent      

411
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:50,273
  living along the West Coast,  

412
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:55,745
       out of their homes       
 and into ten internment camps. 

413
00:31:55,846 --> 00:32:00,283
      All Japanese-American     
        men of draft age,       

414
00:32:00,384 --> 00:32:03,185
      except those already      
      in the armed forces,      

415
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:06,021
       had been classified      
        as enemy aliens,        

416
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:08,724
       forbidden to serve       
         their country.         

417
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:13,997
      Then, in early 1943,      

418
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,499
      Washington announced      
          a new policy.         

419
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,469
   Japanese-American men were   
    now going to be permitted   

420
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,306
        to form a special       
       segregated outfit,       

421
00:32:23,473 --> 00:32:27,309
      the 442nd Regimental      
          Combat Team.          

422
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:33,416
 When the Army called for 1,500 
     volunteers from Hawaii,    

423
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:36,986
    where Japanese-Americans    
    had never been locked up,   

424
00:32:37,087 --> 00:32:39,622
        10,000 turned up        
     at recruiting offices,     

425
00:32:39,723 --> 00:32:42,525
      including a freshman      
     in pre-medical studies     

426
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:47,030
        at the University       
   of Hawaii-- Daniel Inouye.   

427
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:54,004
             INOUYE:            
  And my father took time off.  

428
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:57,507
  And we got on the streetcar.  

429
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:01,244
     And he was very silent     

430
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:07,016
       until we got close       
   to the point of departure.   

431
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:12,921
  He cleared his throat, and I  
   knew something was coming.   

432
00:33:13,023 --> 00:33:15,090
  He's not a scholarly person,  

433
00:33:15,192 --> 00:33:19,095
    but I know he struggled,    
          and he said,          

434
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:22,965
          "This country         
      has been good to us.      

435
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:25,734
   "It has given me two jobs.   

436
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:28,471
        "It has given you       
        and your brothers       

437
00:33:28,572 --> 00:33:32,107
   "and your sister education.  

438
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:34,910
 "We owe a lot to this country. 

439
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:38,047
 "Do not dishonor this country. 

440
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:42,385
       "Above all, do not       
      dishonor the family.      

441
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:45,889
      "And if you must die,     

442
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,824
         die in honor."         

443
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:52,328
   You know, I'm 18 years old   

444
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:57,533
     and here he is telling     
      me these heavy words.     

445
00:33:57,634 --> 00:34:00,603
         And I've always        
       thought to myself,       

446
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:05,842
     would I be able to say     
    the same thing to my son?   

447
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:08,310
          ASAKO TOKUNO:         
        I think that they       
         may not really         

448
00:34:08,412 --> 00:34:09,612
    have known it themselves,   

449
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:12,615
    but I think this feeling    
      was instilled in them     

450
00:34:12,716 --> 00:34:15,217
   through all of our parents.  

451
00:34:15,318 --> 00:34:16,685
  It's called<i> "yamata damashi,"</i> 

452
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:21,057
      and it's this... it's     
   like a proving of yourself   

453
00:34:21,158 --> 00:34:24,394
        and that your...        
    your loyalty goes beyond    

454
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:27,029
         just saying it         
    or talking it, you know.    

455
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,231
        It's proving it,        

456
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,900
       giving it your all,      

457
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:35,004
 even if you die in the process 
        by going to war.        

458
00:34:35,105 --> 00:34:38,073
       And I think that's       
      so strongly instilled     

459
00:34:38,174 --> 00:34:39,709
   from when you're very young  

460
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,578
     that I think that that     
      was one of the things     

461
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,847
      that pushed them on.      

462
00:34:44,948 --> 00:34:48,851
            NARRATOR:           
      Now, Army recruiters      
          went to work          

463
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:51,821
  inside the internment camps.  

464
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:54,224
        Robert Kashiwagi,       
        from Sacramento,        

465
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,459
       was still bedridden      
       from a lung ailment      

466
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,565
    when recruiters turned up   
  at Camp Amache, in Colorado.  

467
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,868
           KASHIWAGI:           
    When the recruiting team    
          came around,          

468
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:09,972
       they announced that      
       this is going to be      

469
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:14,109
       a segregated combat      
          infantry unit         

470
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,778
   slated for frontline duty.   

471
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,416
And I protested very vigorously.

472
00:35:20,517 --> 00:35:26,489
   I don't mind volunteering,   
  but it's really unfair for me 

473
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,192
        to volunteer only       
       to an infantry unit      

474
00:35:30,293 --> 00:35:32,094
          that's slated         
       for frontline duty.      

475
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:35,465
   But we're only to have one   
            choice--            

476
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:39,268
    volunteer to a segregated   
         infantry unit,         

477
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:44,707
        or don't and call       
       yourself disloyal.       

478
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:45,942
         My feeling was         

479
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:49,812
     that the United States     
         is our country         

480
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:51,381
       and if we disowned       
         United States,         

481
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,183
we were a man without a country.

482
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:58,154
      We had no other place     
         we could go to.        

483
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:07,196
        So I more or less       
    volunteered... from bed.    

484
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:12,501
            NARRATOR:           
Those Japanese-Americans already
       in the armed forces      

485
00:36:12,602 --> 00:36:15,771
       were reassigned to       
the 442nd Regimental Combat Team

486
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:19,776
      and sent for training     
 to Camp Shelby in Mississippi--

487
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:22,512
 where the governor assured them

488
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:26,616
      they would be treated     
       as "white" people.       

489
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:31,420
           KASHIWAGI:           
  There were drinking fountains 
        marked "colored"        

490
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:36,725
     and "white" and you had    
  to adhere to the instruction. 

491
00:36:36,826 --> 00:36:38,227
  Can I go into that restaurant 

492
00:36:38,328 --> 00:36:40,730
    or will I not be served?    
            you know.           

493
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:44,500
     These are the difficult    
 questions that entered my mind.

494
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:50,373
 And then when I got on the bus,

495
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:55,177
  why, all the black people had 
  to go to the rear of the bus, 

496
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:59,549
 and whites stayed in the front.

497
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,352
     That's confusing to me,    

498
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:05,755
   because I didn't know where  
       I was belonging to,      

499
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,356
as far as a situation like that.

500
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:10,827
    So I just, without any...   
        without thinking,       

501
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,829
    I would always go towards   
       the black section,       

502
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,531
  but they would turn me around 
    and put me in the white.    

503
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:22,038
            NARRATOR:           
    Early in 1944, the 442nd    
       received its orders      

504
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:24,407
        to head overseas.       

505
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:27,043
        Tim Tokuno, from        
     the Sacramento Valley,     

506
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:33,449
 was granted leave to go and say
    good-bye to his parents.    

507
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:38,087
             TOKUNO:            
 They gave us a 15-day furlough.

508
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:44,027
   And so I went back to visit  
    my folks at Topaz, Utah.    

509
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:50,265
   As I entered the compound,   
    the MP captain stopped me   

510
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:54,504
  and said, "Sergeant, have you 
  got any liquor in your bag?"  

511
00:37:54,605 --> 00:38:01,077
 I said, "Yes, I have a fifth of
  whiskey to take to my folks." 

512
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:05,914
   The captain shook his head   
   and says, "Sorry, Sergeant.  

513
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:09,218
   No liquor allowed in camp."  

514
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,757
   "Hell of a war, isn't it?"   

515
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:16,358
     That's what he told me.    

516
00:38:16,459 --> 00:38:18,060
   "Hell of a war, isn't it?"   

517
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:22,598
             I said,            
      "It sure is, Captain.     

518
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:28,203
   "Look, you got machine guns  
      on all four corners,      

519
00:38:28,304 --> 00:38:30,172
      "with live ammunition     

520
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:35,078
     "and you got the guards    
    patrolling the perimeter,   

521
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:37,245
 "and here I'm going into combat

522
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:41,884
      with my folks behind      
          barbed wire."         

523
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:46,088
      I said, "Yeah, it is      
        a hell of a war."       

524
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:55,197
    (Count Basie band playing   
 "For the Good of the Country") 

525
00:39:08,078 --> 00:39:11,313
           TOM CIARLO:          
     Waterbury at that time     
         during the war         

526
00:39:11,414 --> 00:39:14,517
     was like, uh, you could    
        almost compare it       

527
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,954
  to a miniature Times Square.  

528
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:21,423
       It was never quiet       

529
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,360
       because there were       
        so many factories       

530
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:26,261
        and each factory        
        had three shifts,       

531
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:29,231
        so they're going        
        around the clock.       

532
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:34,603
 So we had buses running up and 
  down from the center of town  

533
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:37,440
  to different streets all over 
   the city going constantly.   

534
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:42,711
            NARRATOR:           
    Like Mobile and countless   
      other American towns,     

535
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:43,912
     Babe Ciarlo's hometown     

536
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,182
   of Waterbury, Connecticut,   
          was booming.          

537
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:50,620
Its peacetime industries had all
    switched over to defense    

538
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,055
and were working 24 hours a day,

539
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:57,026
       seven days a week,       
        365 days a year.        

540
00:39:57,127 --> 00:40:00,996
    Workers came to Waterbury   
        from everywhere.        

541
00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:05,967
          LEO GOLDBERG:         
  While looking for work, there 
    was one memorable morning   

542
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:07,803
      when I got on a bus,      

543
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:10,740
          sat down next         
      to a stra... somebody     

544
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,409
   who turned to me and said,   
         "Good morning."        

545
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,177
       And I looked at him      
          as if to say,         

546
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,045
       "Who are you to say      
      good morning to me?"      

547
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:18,814
       After all, I'm from      
       Brooklyn, New York.      

548
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:20,650
          But any rate,         
   the impact was very great.   

549
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:25,221
  The friendliness that I found 
          in Waterbury          

550
00:40:25,288 --> 00:40:28,757
     was something I was not    
         accustomed to.         

551
00:40:28,858 --> 00:40:34,063
            NARRATOR:           
23-year-old Leo Goldberg quickly
  got a job as a saw sharpener  

552
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:36,499
  at the Scovill Manufacturing  
            Company.            

553
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,603
    Scovill produced so many    
    different military items,   

554
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,104
    the Waterbury<i> Republican</i>    
            reported,           

555
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:46,075
 "That there wasn't an American 
     or British fighting man    

556
00:40:46,176 --> 00:40:48,110
      "who wasn't dependent     
         on the company         

557
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:50,012
   "for some part of the food,  
            clothing,           

558
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:51,913
     "shelter and equipment     

559
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:54,550
       that sustained him       
     through the struggle."     

560
00:41:00,857 --> 00:41:05,093
 Mattatuck Manufacturing gave up
     making upholstery nails    

561
00:41:05,194 --> 00:41:07,863
   in favor of cartridge clips  
         for M-1 rifles,        

562
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:12,735
    turning out three million   
         of them a week.        

563
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:17,606
Chase Brass and Copper made more
  than 52 million mortar shells 

564
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:24,346
     and more than a billion    
     small-caliber bullets.     

565
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:27,683
            GOLDBERG:           
Having a job and no attachments,

566
00:41:27,784 --> 00:41:30,118
     it gives you a freedom.    

567
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:31,787
    You don't have to answer    
           to anybody.          

568
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:34,022
  "Hey, Mom, I'm going to stay  
        out until 10:00,"       

569
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:38,294
or "You got to be home by noon,"
       or whatever it was.      

570
00:41:39,295 --> 00:41:42,732
 So, it was a burst of freedom. 

571
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,168
         So couple that         
     with the friendliness.     

572
00:41:46,269 --> 00:41:47,403
      I got to know people.     

573
00:41:47,504 --> 00:41:50,105
   I went horseback riding for  
   the first time in my life.   

574
00:41:50,206 --> 00:41:52,741
    I never knew what a horse   
          looked like.          

575
00:41:54,444 --> 00:41:58,681
  And, uh... it was just great. 

576
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:10,225
            NARRATOR:           
 Waterbury also sent group after
  group of draftees to the war, 

577
00:42:10,326 --> 00:42:12,661
         12,000 of them.        

578
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:24,072
   The mayor saw them all off   
    at the railroad station.    

579
00:42:24,173 --> 00:42:28,376
 Each man received a prayer book
   and a carton of cigarettes,  

580
00:42:28,477 --> 00:42:32,214
    courtesy of the Shriners.   

581
00:42:32,315 --> 00:42:36,986
   Meanwhile, young Waterbury   
      women did their best      

582
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:41,556
        to keep in touch        
     with the men overseas.     

583
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:50,732
          ANNE DeVICO:          
        We wrote letters        
    to all the boys we knew.    

584
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:53,669
         And they loved         
       getting the letters      

585
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,304
 because they said at roll call 

586
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:58,207
  they wanted their name to be  
      called over and over      

587
00:42:58,308 --> 00:43:00,943
        because they said       
      it was so wonderful.      

588
00:43:01,044 --> 00:43:04,747
    They loved these letters    
      because we told them      

589
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:06,214
    where we went last night.   

590
00:43:06,315 --> 00:43:08,050
      We went for a hot dog     
          or something.         

591
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:09,384
       You know, it wasn't      
          anything big,         

592
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:13,956
   or we went to the USO dance  
   and we saw so-and-so there.  

593
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,829
      And at Christmastime,     
     they got boxes galore.     

594
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,997
     My whole kitchen table,    

595
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,398
     my mother used to help,    
        everybody helped.       

596
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:28,403
        And we sent boxes       
         to all of them.        

597
00:43:39,082 --> 00:43:44,753
            NARRATOR:           
   On December 31, 1943, some   
    of Anne DeVico's friends    

598
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:47,923
    asked her to go with them   
         into Manhattan.        

599
00:43:48,024 --> 00:43:52,427
    They wanted to see in the   
    New Year in Times Square.   

600
00:43:52,528 --> 00:43:55,096
             DeVICO:            
      Well, we had to argue     
         with my mother         

601
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:59,200
  because my mother said, "Only 
   bad girls go to New York."   

602
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:02,304
    And finally we all cried    
         and everything         

603
00:44:02,405 --> 00:44:04,673
    "Okay, you can go because   
   there's eight of you going.  

604
00:44:04,774 --> 00:44:06,742
    How could eight of you do   
        something wrong?"       

605
00:44:06,843 --> 00:44:10,579
          So we were at         
     the Times Square Hotel     

606
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,283
    and we said, "Let's find    
          an Automat,"          

607
00:44:14,384 --> 00:44:18,020
       and all of a sudden      
         this big, tall,        

608
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:22,324
     good-looking dreamboat     
           comes by...          

609
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:26,762
    And he said, "Hey, we're    
    looking for the Automat.    

610
00:44:26,863 --> 00:44:28,264
  Why don't you look with us?"  

611
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:29,532
       And I said, "Fine."      

612
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,268
        So, uh, that was        
     my future husband, Bob.    

613
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:36,738
    And, uh, as he's walking    
      with me, and he said,     

614
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,875
       "Here, the ball is       
      going to come down."      

615
00:44:39,976 --> 00:44:41,409
   And he turned and kissed me  

616
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:45,347
          and he said,          
    "I'm going to marry you."   

617
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,183
    And I said, "Oh, right."    

618
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:53,289
     I had to say he was my     
 girlfriend's boyfriend's friend

619
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,558
    because if my mother ever   
  thought I picked up somebody  

620
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,994
   in New York City, you know,  
  she wouldn't have allowed me  

621
00:44:59,095 --> 00:45:03,332
       even to go outside       
        the house again.        

622
00:45:03,432 --> 00:45:06,234
 When I came home, I'm thinking,
        "How could it be        

623
00:45:06,335 --> 00:45:10,706
  "that I'm from a small city-- 
    Waterbury, Connecticut--    

624
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:13,141
 "and how could I meet somebody 
    from Valparaiso, Indiana,   

625
00:45:13,242 --> 00:45:17,646
        in New York City,       
 and how could we fall in love?"

626
00:45:17,747 --> 00:45:20,916
   And really, he said he fell  
         in love with me        

627
00:45:21,017 --> 00:45:22,284
      that very first day.      

628
00:45:22,385 --> 00:45:24,086
It was as if fate had just said,

629
00:45:24,187 --> 00:45:25,454
          "You're going         
       to meet somebody,"       

630
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:29,024
       and whoever thought      
     it would be like that?     

631
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,512
    BABE CIARLO (dramatized):   
        "January 1, 1944.       

632
00:45:50,613 --> 00:45:53,748
  "Dearest Vic and the babies,  

633
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,117
       "I am feeling fine       

634
00:45:55,218 --> 00:45:59,655
  "and I hope to hear the same  
        from you always.        

635
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:04,326
     "I didn't write sooner     
     because I was very busy    

636
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:08,163
  and there was no mail service 
          where I was."         

637
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,835
   "I had a big turkey dinner   
         for New Year's         

638
00:46:13,002 --> 00:46:15,904
     and it was very good."     

639
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:20,075
     "Don't worry about me.     

640
00:46:20,176 --> 00:46:23,345
          Love, Babe."

00:46:25,014 --> 00:46:29,050

       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
       General Eisenhower,      

643
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:36,425
 named to command the gathering 
     Allied invasion forces,    

644
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:37,459
    surveys the Italian front   

645
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,062
       with General Clark,      
       5th Army Commander.      

646
00:46:40,196 --> 00:46:41,529
        In the mountains        
        of central Italy,       

647
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:46,435
   he observes artillery fire   
blasting the way toward Cassino.

648
00:46:54,076 --> 00:46:55,277
          (no dialogue)         

649
00:46:55,378 --> 00:46:59,214
            NARRATOR:           
         As 1944 began,         
      the Allies continued      

650
00:46:59,315 --> 00:47:02,184
   to slowly battle their way   
       northward in Italy,      

651
00:47:02,285 --> 00:47:04,719
     pushing the Germans out    
    of one defensive position   

652
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,489
         after another.         

653
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,426
          With them now         
      was Ward Chamberlin,      

654
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,462
   from Norwalk, Connecticut.   

655
00:47:15,531 --> 00:47:20,969
           CHAMBERLIN:          
  My father was in World War I. 

656
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:26,041
     He was at Belleau Wood     
    and he was wounded twice,   

657
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:27,909
  got the Distinguished Service 
             Cross,             

658
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,445
      second highest medal      
          you can get.          

659
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:36,684
  After he died, I was walking  
   by St. Patrick's Cathedral,  

660
00:47:36,786 --> 00:47:39,287
     and I saw Father Duffy     
           out there,           

661
00:47:39,388 --> 00:47:43,092
       the famous chaplain      
        from World War I.       

662
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,628
   But I'd met him with my dad  
       a couple of times.       

663
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,564
       So I went up to him      
 on the steps of the cathedral. 

664
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:53,903
     I said, "Father Duffy,     
  my name is Ward Chamberlin."  

665
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,637
            He said,            
   "That's a wonderful name."   

666
00:47:55,738 --> 00:48:00,075
   He said, "Your father's one  
of the bravest men I ever knew."

667
00:48:00,176 --> 00:48:02,444
 That'll break your heart, yeah.

668
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:06,548
            NARRATOR:           
   Chamberlin had been captain  
  of the Princeton soccer team  

669
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:11,520
     when the war broke out,    
and he was eager to do his part.

670
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:13,489
    But there was a problem.    

671
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:16,325
           CHAMBERLIN:          
  I couldn't serve in the Army  
        or the Air Force        

672
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:19,995
    because I'd lost my eye,    
  my right eye, with meningitis 

673
00:48:20,096 --> 00:48:22,064
      when I was about ten.     

674
00:48:22,164 --> 00:48:23,531
        And so I was 4-F        

675
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:28,036
 as far as the military services
         were concerned.        

676
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:30,872
       Then I heard about       
    this organization called    

677
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:32,341
   the American Field Service,  

678
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:36,744
       which at that point      
   were with the, uh, British   

679
00:48:36,845 --> 00:48:41,583
            NARRATOR:           
   The American Field Service   
    was a relief organization   

680
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:44,453
      that had been formed      
   during the First World War,  

681
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:49,191
  and now Chamberlin signed on  
as a volunteer ambulance driver.

682
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:51,927
  He had originally shipped out 
        for North Africa,       

683
00:48:52,028 --> 00:48:56,098
      only to find himself      
hospitalized there for six weeks

684
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,233
   with a mild case of polio.   

685
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:03,138
           CHAMBERLIN:          
      And after I did that      
         for six weeks,         

686
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:07,309
 And I got some orders to report
 back to my Cairo headquarters, 

687
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,178
      and, um, I read them      
         and they said,         

688
00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:12,481
    "You're supposed to have    
     desk duty for a year."     

689
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:13,915
     So I just tore those up    

690
00:49:14,016 --> 00:49:16,185
       and never gave them      
        to anybody, so...       

691
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,721
       And ten days later       
         I was in Italy.        

692
00:49:19,822 --> 00:49:23,325
  Exactly where I wanted to be, 
            exactly.            

693
00:49:23,426 --> 00:49:27,863
Wasn't so sure once I got there.

694
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:35,504
            NARRATOR:           
     In early January 1944,     

695
00:49:35,506 --> 00:49:42,077
         Chamberlin had         
     his first taste of war.    

696
00:49:50,486 --> 00:49:53,655
           CHAMBERLIN:          
  We were in a forward position 
       probably, you know,      

697
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:56,859
       a half a mile from       
     the actual front line,     

698
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,394
   if you could call it that.   

699
00:50:12,508 --> 00:50:15,710
  And the first guy that they,  
      that they brought in      

700
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:19,080
   who was so badly shot up...  

701
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:26,387
...we got him into the ambulance
         on a stretcher,        

702
00:50:26,488 --> 00:50:29,057
    and I've... I don't think   
 I've ever said this to anybody,

703
00:50:29,158 --> 00:50:31,059
   but I went around the side   
        of the ambulance        

704
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,228
  and just let everything out.  

705
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:36,865
 I just... sick, sick as I could
    be for about 30 seconds.    

706
00:50:36,966 --> 00:50:41,336
   And it's just... I'd never   
       seen a body cut up       

707
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:44,907
    as badly as that guy was.   

708
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:48,877
            NARRATOR:           
     The Allies now came up     
           against new          

709
00:50:48,978 --> 00:50:52,480
    and still more formidable   
        German defenses--       

710
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:54,649
        the Gustav Line.        

711
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,084
   It combined three rivers--   

712
00:50:56,185 --> 00:51:00,455
   the Sangro, the Garigliano   
        and the Rapido--        

713
00:51:00,556 --> 00:51:02,323
    and a chain of mountains    

714
00:51:02,424 --> 00:51:05,394
     honeycombed with mines,    
            pillboxes           

715
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,396
 and sheltered gun emplacements.

716
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:15,003
        Its keystone was        
  the 1,715-foot Monte Cassino. 

717
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:18,640
    Looming above the village   
   that gave the hill its name  

718
00:51:18,741 --> 00:51:22,277
    stood the most important    
      monastery in Europe,      

719
00:51:22,378 --> 00:51:23,945
       a Benedictine abbey      

720
00:51:24,046 --> 00:51:27,616
     whose origins went back    
      to the sixth century.     

721
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:34,923
  Behind it lay the broad Liri  
  Valley and the road to Rome.  

722
00:51:42,965 --> 00:51:46,834
  Time and again, Allied forces 
    tried to fight their way    

723
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:52,407
        around its edges        
     and were stopped cold.     

724
00:52:06,722 --> 00:52:09,357
   proposed a daring solution   
        to the impasse--        

725
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:13,995
    a surprise landing behind   
   the German lines at Anzio,   

726
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:16,664
     35 miles south of Rome.    

727
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:23,371
 It was a risky idea that would 
 take time to plan and execute. 

728
00:52:23,472 --> 00:52:27,942
     Meanwhile, the Allies--    
  including American, British,  

729
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:33,648
 Canadian, New Zealand, French, 
     North African, Indian,     

730
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,116
    and Free Polish troops--    

731
00:52:35,217 --> 00:52:38,720
     would mount a series of    
  all-out assaults on Cassino,  

732
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:43,992
        aimed at somehow        
        breaking through.       

733
00:53:12,054 --> 00:53:13,622
           CHAMBERLIN:          
    It was a horrible battle    

734
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:17,258
   because... we kept throwing  
           divisions,           

735
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:22,164
         new tactics...         

736
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:24,032
 You couldn't get through there.

737
00:53:24,133 --> 00:53:28,102
   And we'd lost an awful lot   
         of casualties.         

738
00:53:33,776 --> 00:53:36,011
  The guys that I admired most  

739
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:39,715
 were the guys that were really 
        scared to death,        

740
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:42,651
  and did what they had to do.  

741
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:46,655
   Some of us were too stupid   
     to, uh, feel so scared,    

742
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:52,628
 or you just had some protective
     armor, psychologically,    

743
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,295
        that you put on.        

744
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,664
   (gunfire, bullets whizzing)  

745
00:53:58,734 --> 00:54:02,103
 But the guys I admired were the
 guys who really were frightened

746
00:54:02,204 --> 00:54:05,206
       and went on and did      
      what they had to do,      

747
00:54:05,307 --> 00:54:12,080
  whether they were soldiers or 
 ambulance drivers or whatever. 

748
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:16,618
            NARRATOR:           
   In the early morning hours   
         of January 21,         

749
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:20,989
       Chamberlin watched       
   as the 36th Texas Division   

750
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:23,658
         tried to cross         
     the fast-moving Rapido     

751
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,095
   in the center of the line.   

752
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:29,497
       "We might succeed,"      

753
00:54:29,598 --> 00:54:32,067
    its commander had written   
          in his diary,         

754
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:35,203
 "but I do not see how we can." 

755
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:38,072
          He was right.         

756
00:54:38,173 --> 00:54:40,975
       There was no cover.      

757
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,250
        The men stumbled        
        into minefields,        

758
00:54:49,351 --> 00:54:53,822
 drawing torrents of machine gun
        and mortar fire.        

759
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,231
      Every man who managed     
  to make it across the Rapido  

760
00:55:03,332 --> 00:55:08,269
was killed, wounded or captured.

761
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:13,608
   Some who tried to swim back  
       to safety drowned.       

762
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:17,512
           CHAMBERLIN:          
   How anybody could have sent  
       people through that      

763
00:55:17,613 --> 00:55:19,814
      I just can't imagine.     

764
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,584
    They were shot to pieces.   

765
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:23,784
I saw them come out of the line.

766
00:55:23,886 --> 00:55:26,254
      They were walking...      
      when I first came up,     

767
00:55:26,355 --> 00:55:27,989
   they were, they were coming  
        out of the line,        

768
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:31,526
      walking down the side     
   of the road just eyes shut,  

769
00:55:31,627 --> 00:55:38,266
     just... plodding ahead     
    one foot after the other.   

770
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:41,536
  They looked like they'd been  
    through the worst stuff,    

771
00:55:41,637 --> 00:55:44,272
       and they had been,       
         they had been.         

772
00:55:44,373 --> 00:55:49,310
     Germans just sat across    
 the river and sprayed 'em off. 

773
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:05,393
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
      Now, taking the Nazis     
     completely by surprise,    

774
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:08,029
   the Allies hurl their fleet  
    upon Nettuno and Anzio--    

775
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:13,801
 points behind the German lines 
     30 miles south of Rome.    

776
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:18,506
     At dawn, landing ships     
   and barges stand offshore.   

777
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:20,508
  Small boats begin to pour in. 

778
00:56:20,609 --> 00:56:23,511
       The initial landing      
    meets with no opposition.   

779
00:56:23,612 --> 00:56:26,147
            NARRATOR:           
          The same day          
     Ward Chamberlin watched    

780
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,549
  the men of the 36th Division  
          stagger back          

781
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:31,052
        from the aborted        
     crossing of the Rapido,    

782
00:56:31,153 --> 00:56:35,690
      36,000 Allied troops      
        landed at Anzio.        

783
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:39,761
    Babe Ciarlo of Waterbury    
         was with them,         

784
00:56:39,862 --> 00:56:45,033
    part of the 3rd Infantry    
            Division.           

785
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:55,310
 The Allies had caught the enemy
       totally unprepared.      

786
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:58,246
    But the Allied commander,   

787
00:56:58,347 --> 00:57:02,750
     General John P. Lucas,     
       was a cautious man.      

788
00:57:02,851 --> 00:57:06,687
         His orders were        
    to move inland 20 miles,    

789
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:09,825
      seize the Alban Hills     
      that overlooked Rome      

790
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:13,161
  and cut off the railroad line 
          and two roads         

791
00:57:13,262 --> 00:57:15,362
    that supplied the enemy.    

792
00:57:15,464 --> 00:57:19,134
   Lucas wanted to be certain   
        he had enough men       

793
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:22,437
      and enough fire power     
        to be successful.       

794
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:26,274
        He took nine days       
  to consolidate his position-- 

795
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:28,609
      more than enough time     
         for the Germans        

796
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,979
   to build up their defenses.  

797
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,349
     By the time the Allies     
      began to move forward     

798
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:40,254
 the better part of eight enemy 
    divisions-- 100,000 men--   

799
00:57:40,355 --> 00:57:44,226
      held the high ground      
   along the Allied perimeter,  

800
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,862
      ready for any attack.     

801
00:57:59,475 --> 00:58:02,944
     Babe Ciarlo's division     
     tried to fight its way     

802
00:58:03,078 --> 00:58:06,547
    through the German lines    
   near the town of Cisterna,   

803
00:58:06,682 --> 00:58:12,720
     only to be hurled back     
        toward the beach.       

804
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:26,367
       Unable to advance,       
  Americans and Britons dug in  

805
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:29,304
       as best they could       
      on the Anzio plain--      

806
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:32,407
 15 miles long, ten miles deep, 

807
00:58:32,508 --> 00:58:37,979
       and totally exposed      
         to enemy fire.         

808
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:11,913
  They would remain pinned down 
there for four miserable months.

809
00:59:17,319 --> 00:59:22,424
    The secret landing meant    
 to stun the enemy had stalled, 

810
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:23,591
       just as the assault      

811
00:59:23,692 --> 00:59:27,295
       on the Gustav Line       
    it had been meant to aid    

812
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:29,431
        had also stalled.       

813
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:34,168
     As Churchill said about    
   that Anzio thing, he said,   

814
00:59:34,269 --> 00:59:36,071
    "I thought I was putting    
        a wildcat ashore.       

815
00:59:36,171 --> 00:59:38,907
       It turned out to be      
        a bloated whale,"       

816
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:42,376
   because we just sat there.   

817
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:46,814
            NARRATOR:           
  Meanwhile, the Allied armies  
      back at Monte Cassino     

818
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:50,218
     were faring no better.     

819
00:59:53,355 --> 00:59:56,557
          In February,          
  New Zealand and Indian troops 

820
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:00,261
  were ordered to take Cassino. 

821
01:00:00,362 --> 01:00:01,596
          They failed.          

822
01:00:01,697 --> 01:00:05,333
    Their commander insisted    
the Germans were using the abbey

823
01:00:05,434 --> 01:00:11,873
as an observation post to direct
 fire on the huddled men below. 

824
01:00:11,974 --> 01:00:17,946
   Waves of American warplanes  
   dropped 586 tons of bombs,   

825
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,849
 turning the abbey into rubble. 

826
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:37,798
The men below stood and cheered.

827
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,968
       Some wept with joy.      

828
01:00:50,112 --> 01:00:55,216
      But German resistance     
   was actually strengthened.   

829
01:00:55,317 --> 01:00:59,720
   Having promised the Church   
  not to disturb the sanctuary, 

830
01:00:59,821 --> 01:01:03,624
       the Nazis had never      
     actually used the abbey    

831
01:01:03,725 --> 01:01:06,194
     as an observation post.    

832
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:10,432
     But they quickly turned    
 its ruins into a new stronghold

833
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,701
  from which they directed fire 
       to destroy the men       

834
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:17,372
      that were again sent      
          against them.         

835
01:01:25,814 --> 01:01:27,816
      In March, the Indians     

836
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:32,253
   and New Zealanders attacked  
           once more.           

837
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:43,364
       The battle seesawed      
         back and forth         

838
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:45,099
   for two days and two nights  

839
01:01:45,267 --> 01:01:50,237
   before the Allies fell back  
    to where they'd started.    

840
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:57,345
      4,000 men were lost.      

841
01:01:58,013 --> 01:02:00,515
        The Germans held.       

842
01:02:01,316 --> 01:02:05,887
       In the mud and snow      
        and bitter cold,        

843
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:09,023
      the killing went on.      

844
01:02:25,006 --> 01:02:27,674
           (gunshots)           

845
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:33,581
           CHAMBERLIN:          
       You'd get a guy in       
       and he looked okay,      

846
01:02:33,682 --> 01:02:36,617
    but a little further on,    
    there'd be a medical guy    

847
01:02:36,718 --> 01:02:41,155
     and he'd say, you know,    
 "This guy's, this guy's going."

848
01:02:41,256 --> 01:02:43,391
  And I said, "Should I stop?"  

849
01:02:43,492 --> 01:02:48,429
    He said, "Yeah, why don't   
     you stop for a minute."    

850
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:51,832
         So I went back         
    and held his hand and...    

851
01:02:51,933 --> 01:02:53,334
   you know, he just looked up  

852
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:55,302
     and kind of gave a sign    
         of recognition         

853
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,839
      and then he was gone.     

854
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,608
      It was quick, quick.      

855
01:03:00,709 --> 01:03:04,345
      It's hard to describe     
 what it's really like, it's... 

856
01:03:04,446 --> 01:03:07,982
        You can remember        
       the moments, but...      

857
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:11,318
           but, um...           

858
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:12,954
            it, uh...           

859
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:19,260
  you see some guy leaving this 
  world, it's not a lot of fun.

   What is there we can all do  
        on the home front       

886
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:15,209
   to help the men coming back  
  and the men still over there? 

887
01:05:15,276 --> 01:05:17,344
    Make your home an arsenal   
           for victory          

888
01:05:17,445 --> 01:05:22,850
   by fighting waste every day  
 from now until the war is over.

889
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:26,653
            (reading)

891
01:05:52,147 --> 01:05:57,485
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
      All the old iron beds     
 were pulled out of the garages 

892
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:00,587
        and they were put       
      in the metal drives.      

893
01:06:00,688 --> 01:06:06,527
       The Boy Scouts did       
      a great deal of that.     

894
01:06:06,628 --> 01:06:09,864
        The city took up        
     the old streetcar lines    

895
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:13,567
    that went down Government   
       and Dauphin Street       

896
01:06:13,669 --> 01:06:18,239
       and we added those       
       to the scrap pile.       

897
01:06:20,675 --> 01:06:26,680
     But everyone took part     
        in World War II,        

898
01:06:26,781 --> 01:06:32,620
            NARRATOR:           
 The Office of Civilian Defense 
called upon each American family

899
01:06:32,721 --> 01:06:36,557
   to become a "fighting unit   
       on the home front."      

900
01:06:36,658 --> 01:06:39,893
       Everyone was asked       
     to collect scrap metal     

901
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:43,164
      from which armaments      
         could be made.         

902
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:44,565
       In one year alone,       

903
01:06:44,666 --> 01:06:50,071
    Mobile's citizens amassed   
       22 million pounds.       

904
01:06:50,672 --> 01:06:54,375
          Children were         
    the most avid collectors.   

905
01:06:54,476 --> 01:06:57,378
          JIM SHERMAN:          
The motto was "wash and squash."

906
01:06:57,479 --> 01:07:01,715
You wash out the can and then...

907
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:02,950
      you take the top off.     

908
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:04,385
  Then you take the bottom off. 

909
01:07:04,486 --> 01:07:08,222
  Then you put the top and the  
  bottom together in the middle 

910
01:07:08,323 --> 01:07:11,992
    and then you'd squash it,   
       you'd stomp on it.       

911
01:07:12,093 --> 01:07:14,828
     And then you put these     
       in a box and then--      

912
01:07:14,929 --> 01:07:17,364
     I don't know if it was     
every week or every other week--

913
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:19,300
     the city would come by     
    and they would pick up...   

914
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:22,669
 You'd set them out on your curb
   kind of like recycling now   

915
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:24,405
 and then the city would come by

916
01:07:24,506 --> 01:07:27,108
       and they'd pick up       
       all these tin cans.      

917
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:32,379
            NARRATOR:           
      In Sacramento, 22 big     
   "Victory Bins" were set up   

918
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:35,349
   on downtown street corners   
        for the duration,       

919
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:38,952
 even though some people thought
      they were unsightly.      

920
01:07:39,053 --> 01:07:44,324
  Luverne, Minnesota, had been  
 founded by Civil War veterans, 

921
01:07:44,426 --> 01:07:46,994
    but now the town council    
           volunteered          

922
01:07:47,095 --> 01:07:50,431
  to melt down the cannonballs  
that formed part of the memorial

923
01:07:50,532 --> 01:07:56,303
    to the Union dead to make   
 munitions for the new conflict.

924
01:07:56,404 --> 01:07:58,071
 And in Waterbury, Connecticut, 

925
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:03,311
      281,135 pounds of tin     
         were collected,        

926
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:06,580
    along with 65,000 pounds    
           of rubber,           

927
01:08:06,681 --> 01:08:10,317
     225,458 pounds of rags,    

928
01:08:10,418 --> 01:08:16,022
      and 372,733 pounds...     

929
01:08:16,124 --> 01:08:20,227
            SHERMAN:            
 If you were lucky enough to get
 a pound of bacon, for example, 

930
01:08:20,328 --> 01:08:21,862
  and you get the fat in there, 

931
01:08:21,963 --> 01:08:24,898
 you were supposed to pour that 
         into a tin can         

932
01:08:24,999 --> 01:08:29,203
      and then take it down     
       to the salvage guy.      

933
01:08:29,304 --> 01:08:31,305
        Now, I couldn't,        
 for the life of me, figure out 

934
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:35,243
   how are they going to make   
  ammunition out of bacon fat?  

935
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:39,113
    All of this we knew made    
           ammunition,          

936
01:08:39,214 --> 01:08:41,515
     but we didn't know how.    

937
01:08:41,616 --> 01:08:44,818
 But anything to help the boys.

       Fats make glycerin

   two billion pounds of waste  
 kitchen fats are thrown away-- 

940

 enough glycerin for ten billion
   rapid-fire cannon shells...

  in the largest training camp  
    of its kind in the world,   

949
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:38,005
     800 colored rookies get    
  their basic physical buildup  

950

   for eventful days to come.   

951
01:09:39,974 --> 01:09:42,309
     Ten weeks ago they were    
   coal miners, steel workers,  

952
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:43,910
 mechanics, professional boxers;

953
01:09:44,012 --> 01:09:45,879
    in fact, most everything    
      from college teachers     

954
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:46,880
       to Pullman porters.      

955
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:49,550
        A few weeks more        
     of this intensive drill    

956
01:09:49,651 --> 01:09:53,520
the field artillery replacements
  of the famed 16th Battalion;  

957
01:09:54,522 --> 01:09:56,323
         of cannoneers,         
      radio and signal men;     

958
01:09:56,424 --> 01:09:58,525
  an all-Negro group assembled  
    from all over the nation;   

959
01:09:58,626 --> 01:10:01,262
    a well-trained unit ready   
   and eager to join the fight  

960
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:05,432
    for survival of the great   
 democracy that gave them birth.

961

         All right, men.        

962
01:10:08,937 --> 01:10:11,672
            On behalf           
   of the United States Army,   

963
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:16,143
    and the reception center    
       here at this camp,       

964
01:10:16,244 --> 01:10:18,846
    we're glad to welcome you   
           here today,          

965
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:21,581
and into the United States Army.

966
01:10:22,951 --> 01:10:28,522
      We're glad to see all     
  of your happy, smiling faces. 

967
01:10:28,623 --> 01:10:31,692
       You'll be converted      
         from a civilian        

968
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:35,730
  into a full-fledged soldier.

              GRAY:             
    When I went in, they, uh,   

970
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:41,402
           had a pad.           

971
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:47,007
        And "eyes: Negro;

976
01:10:56,985 --> 01:11:00,587
     Everything was "Negro"     
    except height and weight.   

977
01:11:00,689 --> 01:11:02,123
            NARRATOR:           
       Despite the bravery      

978
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:06,394
   of African-Americans in all  
   of America's previous wars,  

979
01:11:06,627 --> 01:11:09,930
    despite the argument made   
     by the NAACP and others    

980
01:11:10,031 --> 01:11:13,934
  that "a Jim Crow army cannot  
    fight for a free world,"    

981
01:11:14,035 --> 01:11:17,505
        the armed forces        
      of the United States      

982
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:21,742
  remained strictly segregated. 

983
01:11:25,847 --> 01:11:27,281
  Black draftees from the North 

984
01:11:27,382 --> 01:11:29,350
     sent to training camps     
       in the deep South,       

985
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:34,054
    encountered Jim Crow laws   
       for the first time.      

986
01:11:34,155 --> 01:11:36,990
  Some, who defied those laws,  

987
01:11:37,091 --> 01:11:39,026
     paid with their lives.     

988
01:11:39,127 --> 01:11:43,897
    Some men refused to serve   
    in a segregated military    

989
01:11:43,998 --> 01:11:47,768
   and were imprisoned for it.  

990
01:11:47,869 --> 01:11:51,072
      At home and overseas,     
       there were frequent      

991
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:53,274
      and sometimes bloody      
         confrontations         

992
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:56,243
    between black servicemen    
      and white civilians,      

993
01:11:56,344 --> 01:11:58,045
  black troops and white ones,  

994
01:11:58,146 --> 01:12:00,681
  over women and local customs, 

995
01:12:00,782 --> 01:12:05,418
        and equal access        
     to military facilities.    

996
01:12:08,122 --> 01:12:11,025
         Growing protest        
      by African-Americans      

997
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:15,261
    would force the military    
     to make a few changes.     

998
01:12:15,363 --> 01:12:18,231
 An Army Air Corps training camp

999
01:12:18,332 --> 01:12:22,169
was set up at Tuskegee Institute
           in Alabama.          

1000
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:24,037
         A single ship,         

1001
01:12:24,138 --> 01:12:28,609
    the USS<i> Mason,</i> was manned   
      entirely by blacks--      

1002
01:12:28,776 --> 01:12:33,180
    except for her commander.   

1003
01:12:33,281 --> 01:12:35,149
    The 761st Tank Battalion    

1004
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:36,951
        would eventually        
        fight in Europe,        

1005
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:39,419
        sent to the front       
        by George Patton        

1006
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:43,190
  with the admonition: "I don't 
    care what color you are,    

1007
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:45,359
       "so long as you go       
        up there and kill       

1008
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,761
  those Kraut sons of bitches." 

1009
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:52,766
  The Marine Corps had refused  
  to accept any blacks at all,  

1010
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:57,538
  but after 1942, as casualties 
     in the Pacific mounted     

1011
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,373
 and pressure from civil rights 
       groups intensified,      

1012
01:13:00,475 --> 01:13:03,944
      John Gray and others      
      were finally allowed      

1013
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:06,547
     to sign on and serve...    

1014
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:08,649
      in segregated units.      

1015
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:12,052
              GRAY:             
       They did not intend      

1016
01:13:12,153 --> 01:13:15,322
         to have blacks         
       as fighting units.       

1017
01:13:15,423 --> 01:13:17,424
   They intended to have them,  

1018
01:13:17,525 --> 01:13:21,228
  if at all, as support units.  

1019
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:24,531
       Look like you ought      
     to appreciate the fact     

1020
01:13:24,632 --> 01:13:25,899
    that you're not up front.   

1021
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,035
    But they didn't want you    
  to get that kind of a glory.  

1022
01:13:29,136 --> 01:13:33,574
            NARRATOR:           
       John Gray was sent       
to Camp LeJeune, North Carolina,

1023
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,843
         where he joined        
   the 51st Defense Battalion,  

1024
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:39,079
   one of only two black units  

1025
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:42,316
    being trained for combat    
      in the Marine Corps.      

1026
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:45,852
        Its commander was       
  Lt. Colonel Floyd Stephenson, 

1027
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:48,956
     a veteran of the attack    
        on Pearl Harbor,        

1028
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:51,091
    who won his men's loyalty   
          by declaring,         

1029
01:13:51,192 --> 01:13:56,096
  "There is nothing that black  
    troops cannot be taught."   

1030
01:13:57,098 --> 01:13:59,867
        He was a far cry        
        from the officers       

1031
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:02,736
     John Gray was used to.     

1032
01:14:02,837 --> 01:14:05,038
              GRAY:             
     And that was different     
       from Major Larsen,       

1033
01:14:05,139 --> 01:14:07,775
    who said he had been out    
         in the jungles         

1034
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:10,711
     and he had fought this     
      and he had done that      

1035
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:15,048
        and he came back        
      to find women Marines     

1036
01:14:15,149 --> 01:14:21,855
         and dog Marines        
     and then "you people."     

1037
01:14:21,956 --> 01:14:25,225
    We didn't like for people   
      to say "you people."      

1038
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:29,396
     So instead of referring    
     to troops as "troops,"     

1039
01:14:29,497 --> 01:14:33,934
     they would always refer    
to black troops as "you people."

1040
01:14:34,035 --> 01:14:36,737
      And we resented that.     

1041
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,575
            NARRATOR:           
     John Gray and his unit     
         were eventually        

1042
01:14:41,676 --> 01:14:43,109
   sent to the South Pacific.   

1043
01:14:43,211 --> 01:14:45,646
      They had been trained     
        as expert gunners       

1044
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:48,549
     on 90 and 150 mm guns,     

1045
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,850
      and were so skilled,      
        Gray remembered,        

1046
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:54,220
         "we could shoot        
      the sting off a bee."     

1047
01:14:54,322 --> 01:14:55,889
   But their white commanders   

1048
01:14:56,057 --> 01:14:58,224
         did not see fit        
    to send them into battle.   

1049
01:14:58,325 --> 01:15:02,996
     The men took to calling    
 themselves "The Lost Battalion"

1050
01:15:03,097 --> 01:15:05,165
        because they had        
        so little to do,        

1051
01:15:05,266 --> 01:15:08,168
        and white Marines       
    resented their presence--   

1052
01:15:08,269 --> 01:15:12,372
  especially when Samoan women  
         were involved.         

1053
01:15:14,108 --> 01:15:18,378
              GRAY:             
   And when they got a chance   
    to dance or something...    

1054
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:22,516
    and those girls were told   
       that we had tails.       

1055
01:15:22,617 --> 01:15:23,984
         So when a girl         
      would dance with you,     

1056
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:27,855
  she would reach down and try  
    to see if you had a tail.   

1057
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:30,891
           (chuckles)           

1058
01:15:30,992 --> 01:15:36,329
But those girls would be so glad
     to have the treatment.     

1059
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:38,431
      So they extended, uh,     

1060
01:15:38,532 --> 01:15:40,467
     "separate, but equal,"     
          so to speak,          

1061
01:15:40,568 --> 01:15:43,070
    into the armed services.    

1062
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:53,547
         (Edgar Meyer's         
   "Concert Duo mvt. 1" plays)  

1063
01:16:19,974 --> 01:16:22,509
                              

1064
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:37,224
        QUENTIN AANENSON:       
    I wanted to fly fighters.   

1065
01:16:37,325 --> 01:16:41,128
  And by the luck of the draw,  
   I was sent to Harding Field  

1066
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,996
   at Baton Rouge, Louisiana.   

1067
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:46,633
      That's where they had     
      the P-47 Thunderbolt.     

1068
01:16:46,734 --> 01:16:50,770
     And that was the plane     
        I wanted to fly.        

1069
01:16:50,871 --> 01:16:54,307
            NARRATOR:           
The war offered Quentin Aanenson
     of Luverne, Minnesota,     

1070
01:16:54,408 --> 01:16:58,879
       a chance to realize      
  his boyhood dream of flying.  

1071
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:02,448
  Color blindness had kept him  
    out of the Army Air Corps   

1072
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:08,188
     until he took the test     
  enough times to memorize it.  

1073
01:17:08,289 --> 01:17:12,960
    In early 1944, he was one   
 of hundreds of thousands of men

1074
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:14,661
being trained to play their part

1075
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:18,365
     in the coming invasion     
           of France.           

1076
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,936
    The P-47 Thunderbolt was    

1077
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:25,071
      a powerful airplane.      

1078
01:17:25,172 --> 01:17:26,606
         We could carry         

1079
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:30,577
    two 500-pound bombs under   
  the wings, or we could carry  

1080
01:17:30,678 --> 01:17:33,480
      two 1,000-pound bombs     
        under the wings.        

1081
01:17:33,581 --> 01:17:37,017
  We carried up to ten rockets. 

1082
01:17:37,118 --> 01:17:40,120
    We had eight .50 caliber    
          machine guns          

1083
01:17:40,221 --> 01:17:43,890
      mounted in the wings      
     that had a rate of fire    

1084
01:17:43,991 --> 01:17:48,195
 of 600 rounds a minute per gun.

1085
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:50,063
       So we, in a second,      

1086
01:17:50,164 --> 01:17:52,933
 we could throw a hundred shells
           on a target          

1087
01:17:53,034 --> 01:17:54,968
   and just devastate anything  

1088
01:17:55,069 --> 01:17:56,336
    that was in front of us.    
       (rapid gunfire)          

1089
01:17:56,437 --> 01:18:00,841
            NARRATOR:           
 Fighter training in Baton Rouge
        was exhilarating,       

1090
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:02,709
         but dangerous.         

1091
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:04,077
           (explosion)          

1092
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:07,280
Five members of Aanenson's group
         of 40 trainees         

1093
01:18:07,381 --> 01:18:11,785
      died before they got      
    a chance to go overseas.    

1094
01:18:11,886 --> 01:18:14,654
        (Mills Brothers'        
       "Paper Doll" plays)      

1095
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:20,360
  I'm gonna buy a paper doll  

1096
01:18:20,461 --> 01:18:23,429
   That I can call my own...  

1097
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:28,501
            AANENSON:           
    And I had been there only   
   about ten days or two weeks  

1098
01:18:28,602 --> 01:18:32,372
       when I met Jackie.       

1099
01:18:33,741 --> 01:18:36,709
        I went to a dance       
         that was put on        

1100
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:41,281
      by a girls' club that     
        she belonged to.        

1101
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:48,588
       And this absolutely      
      darling girl came up.     

1102
01:18:48,689 --> 01:18:52,091
          JACKIE GREER:         
   And that particular night,   

1103
01:18:52,192 --> 01:18:55,929
I had a darling Valentine dress,

1104
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:59,899
 you know, the red and the white
        stripes and all.        

1105
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,769
     There was a song called    
          "Paper Doll"          

1106
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:06,940
that was so famous at that time.

1107
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:10,811
        And as I took her       

1108
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:14,013
   to dance with her, I said,   

1109
01:19:14,114 --> 01:19:17,851
      "Hello, paper doll."      

1110
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,922
             GREER:             
     We did have our dance,     

1111
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:25,259
          and we danced         
     for about five minutes,    

1112
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:28,528
    the music stopped to let    
         the band rest,         

1113
01:19:28,629 --> 01:19:30,430
        and I went home.        

1114
01:19:30,531 --> 01:19:31,865
 And when I got home that night,

1115
01:19:31,966 --> 01:19:34,968
      my sister was already     
         in bed asleep.         

1116
01:19:35,069 --> 01:19:36,569
       We slept together.       

1117
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:40,674
        And I woke her up       
      and I said, "Nelwin,      

1118
01:19:40,775 --> 01:19:45,112
      tonight I met the man     
      I'm going to marry."      

1119
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:48,148
            AANENSON:           
      Well, we had 90 days      

1120
01:19:48,249 --> 01:19:51,050
   to work with from the time   
            I met her           

1121
01:19:51,152 --> 01:19:55,054
  until the time I shipped out  
         to go overseas.        

1122
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:57,390
     We would go to parties,    

1123
01:19:57,492 --> 01:20:02,562
      and we saw each other     
       almost every night.      

1124
01:20:02,663 --> 01:20:06,332
   And we knew within a matter  
      of just a short time      

1125
01:20:06,433 --> 01:20:10,871
 that this was something serious
      and everything was...     

1126
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:13,306
        it's sort of like       
        on fast-forward.        

1127
01:20:13,407 --> 01:20:17,610
       You live your life       
       realizing that, uh,      

1128
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:20,246
  you don't have a lot of time. 

1129
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,417
            NARRATOR:           
   Before he left for England,  

1130
01:20:23,518 --> 01:20:27,487
     Aanenson laid down some    
    ground rules for Jackie.    

1131
01:20:27,588 --> 01:20:29,556
            AANENSON:           
            So I said           

1132
01:20:29,657 --> 01:20:32,993
     that "I'd like to make     
        a deal with you.        

1133

   I never did understand it.   

1139

1142
01:21:02,256 --> 01:21:06,559

       that I wouldn't get      

1143
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:10,397

   it couldn't go any further.

 they were operating on his leg,

     of shrapnel in his arm.    

1187

1207
01:25:57,384 --> 01:26:01,254

    the beach with leaflets,    

1208
01:26:01,355 --> 01:26:04,524
      urging Allied solders     
          to surrender.         

1209

    took part in some of it,

          where he was.         

1220
01:26:53,106 --> 01:26:57,777
   You couldn't say much about  
     where you were anyway,

as a chow line when you're in...

1226

   in a foxhole or someplace?

       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
The Allies are stalled at Anzio,

1260
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:26,960
but patrol clashes are frequent.

1261
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:28,161
    Here's a German outpost.    

1262
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:31,130
 (automatic gunfire, explosions)

1263
01:29:31,265 --> 01:29:33,933
           TOM CIARLO:          
       You see, probably,       
         on the newsreel        

1264
01:29:34,034 --> 01:29:35,100
      or you read about it      

1265
01:29:35,202 --> 01:29:37,470
          in the paper          
    about different battles.    

1266
01:29:37,571 --> 01:29:41,274
     But you don't actually     
   put Babe in that position,   

1267
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,042
 because he's always telling you

1268
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:48,247
     how everything is fine,    
    everything is no problem.   

1269
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:52,819
    At one point, as a matter   
 of fact, my mother had my aunt 

1270
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,922
    write a letter in Italian   

1271
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:57,156
   that she had sent to Babe.   

1272
01:29:57,257 --> 01:29:59,626
     "When you get to Rome,     
     when you get to Italy,     

1273
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:00,927
 "we have relatives over there. 

1274
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:03,028
      "When you get there,      

1275
01:30:03,129 --> 01:30:06,866
     show them these letters    
  and they'll treat you well,"  

1276
01:30:06,967 --> 01:30:08,500
 and everything else, you know. 

1277
01:30:08,602 --> 01:30:11,237
   And at the time, you think,  
well, yeah, he's going to Italy.

1278
01:30:11,338 --> 01:30:14,841
  He's going to go to Rome and  
he's going to see his relatives.

1279
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:16,042
      Can you imagine that?     

1280
01:30:16,143 --> 01:30:19,845
         It's so unreal.

            with you,           

1285
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:42,402
      because it'll do all      
          of you good."

     to target German guns,     

1296
01:31:18,705 --> 01:31:23,609
       and things at Anzio      
  had calmed down a good deal.

      fallen day and night      

1298
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:32,084
    was reduced to sporadic,    
         harassing fire.        

1299
01:31:34,555 --> 01:31:37,823
  In one sector, German gunners 
 held their fire each afternoon 

1300
01:31:37,924 --> 01:31:41,661
     while GIs played a game    
          of baseball.          

1301
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:43,663
   In a ceremony on the beach,  

1302
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:48,634
     37 foreign-born members    
of Babe's division were sworn in

1303

      as American citizens.     

1304
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:54,206

       and an army nurse.       

1306
01:31:57,644 --> 01:32:02,081
     The bride cut the cake

   (gunfire, distant shouting)

 French forces from North Africa
battled their way behind Cassino

1335
01:34:01,836 --> 01:34:06,572
            and began

1343
01:34:25,092 --> 01:34:28,427
    eager to avenge the Nazi    
   invasion of their country,   

1344
01:34:28,528 --> 01:34:30,930
          finally took          
      the ruined monastery      

1345
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:32,999
  and the positions around it.

   The Gustav Line had broken.

 The Germans began falling back.

1349
01:34:41,674 --> 01:34:47,713
        Monte Cassino was

      Meanwhile, at Anzio,      

1351
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:59,591
       General Mark Clark       
    ordered his forces there    

1352
01:34:59,692 --> 01:35:03,829
  to begin their own offensive  
           on May 23.           

1353
01:35:05,598 --> 01:35:09,034
        He was determined       
  to break out of the beachhead 

1354
01:35:09,136 --> 01:35:10,969
           and link up          
     with the Allied armies     

1355
01:35:11,071 --> 01:35:13,905
     coming up from Cassino     
        to trap the enemy       

1356
01:35:14,007 --> 01:35:17,176
    now retreating northward.

       (distant shouting)       

1361
01:35:26,552 --> 01:35:29,422
     Babe's regiment helped     
          lead the way,         

1362
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:33,759
   finally taking the fiercely  
  defended village of Cisterna  

1363
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:37,029
         they had tried         
     to take months earlier.    

1364
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:38,564
        (distant gunfire)       

1365

     (explosion, man shouts)    

1366
01:35:43,036 --> 01:35:45,938
 But when his men broke through,

1367
01:35:46,039 --> 01:35:48,841
    General Clark astonished    
          his own staff         

1368
01:35:48,942 --> 01:35:53,145
     and his British Allies     
      by racing toward Rome     

1369
01:35:53,246 --> 01:35:55,047
      rather than trapping      
         and destroying         

1370
01:35:55,148 --> 01:35:56,315
   the retreating German army,  

1371
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:59,184
         which had been         
       the original plan.       

1372
01:35:59,285 --> 01:36:02,655
           CHAMBERLIN:          
       And when we finally      
    did break through there,    

1373
01:36:02,756 --> 01:36:05,758
       we didn't even beat      
      the German army then.     

1374
01:36:05,859 --> 01:36:10,129
  So there wasn't a lot to show 
          for all that.         

1375
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:13,232
      All those casualties,     
   all those terrible things.   

1376
01:36:13,333 --> 01:36:16,468
      The only thing we did     
    from a larger perspective   

1377
01:36:16,569 --> 01:36:20,472
 was to keep a number of German 
    divisions occupied there    

1378
01:36:20,573 --> 01:36:22,808
    that otherwise could have   
         gone to France,        

1379
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,977
       or could have gone       
  to Russia or somewhere else.  

1380
01:36:25,078 --> 01:36:28,781
     But there wasn't a lot     
         to show for it.        

1381
01:36:28,882 --> 01:36:31,250
        It was horrible.        

1382
01:36:31,351 --> 01:36:33,518
         (radio static,

            reporting           

1384
01:36:35,388 --> 01:36:37,923
       that the 5th Army,       
  tanks and motorized infantry, 

1385
01:36:38,024 --> 01:36:40,960
   has roared on through Rome   
   today in relentless pursuit  

1386
01:36:42,128 --> 01:36:44,897
   That's the picture in Italy  
    as Allied planes continue   

1387
01:36:44,998 --> 01:36:47,132

   The people of this ancient   
   and still splendid capital   

1390
01:36:54,807 --> 01:36:57,476
     have seldom celebrated     
     such a riotous holiday     

1391
01:36:57,577 --> 01:36:59,045

      units of the 5th Army

1394
01:37:04,117 --> 01:37:06,118

   A tremendous shout went up   
        in the square...

1398
01:37:15,195 --> 01:37:20,132
    his sister Olga sat down    
     to write him a letter.

1445
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:29,955
       a telegram arrived

1446
01:40:30,056 --> 01:40:33,892
         Babe was dead.         

1447
01:40:36,362 --> 01:40:38,863

       as early as May 23,      

1448
01:40:38,964 --> 01:40:41,634
   as his battalion struggled   
        to take Cisterna        

1449
01:40:41,735 --> 01:40:45,036
   during the first few hours   
     of the Anzio breakout.     

1450
01:40:45,137 --> 01:40:49,675
    995 men from his division   
       were lost that day,      

1451
01:40:49,776 --> 01:40:52,545
   perhaps the largest number   
    suffered in a single day    

1452
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:58,150
  by any American Army division 
     during the entire war.     

1453

    Hundreds more were killed   
           or wounded           

1454
01:41:03,156 --> 01:41:04,489
    during the next few days,   

1455
01:41:04,590 --> 01:41:08,326
        some of them hit        
   by American fighter planes   

1456
01:41:08,427 --> 01:41:11,296
      whose pilots mistook      
   their advancing countrymen   

1457
01:41:11,397 --> 01:41:12,865
     for retreating Germans.    

1458
01:41:12,966 --> 01:41:18,137
     Whenever Babe was hit,     
     however he was wounded,    

1459
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:20,406
       he died on May 27,       

1460
01:41:20,507 --> 01:41:23,442
 eight days before his birthday.

1461
01:41:23,543 --> 01:41:28,246
     Among the belongings in    
 his pockets were two rosaries, 

1462
01:41:28,347 --> 01:41:29,581
      his driver's license,     

1463
01:41:29,682 --> 01:41:33,485
  a wallet with 16 photographs  
     of family and friends,     

1464
01:41:33,586 --> 01:41:39,290
     a blood-stained letter,    
           and $1.61.

              OLGA:             
   Well, I was out that night   
         with the girls.        

1466
01:41:46,633 --> 01:41:48,133
      We had a sewing club.     

1467
01:41:48,234 --> 01:41:51,870
           I came home          
  and after I got off the bus,  

1468
01:41:51,972 --> 01:41:56,007
   I see all these lights lit,  
      which is very unusual     

1469
01:41:56,108 --> 01:41:59,745
    that my mother would have   
      all these lights lit,     

1470
01:41:59,846 --> 01:42:01,112
and the closer I got            
to my house,                    

1471
01:42:01,213 --> 01:42:04,917
lights were all over the place  
and I can hear people talking,  

1472
01:42:05,018 --> 01:42:07,519
and as I went                   
up the front stairs,            

1473
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:12,491
I can hear my mother            
screaming, crying.              

1474
01:42:12,592 --> 01:42:17,363
My aunts, uncles,               
everybody was there,            

1475
01:42:17,463 --> 01:42:19,231
        and I didn't know       
       what had happened,       

1476
01:42:19,332 --> 01:42:24,169
   so my aunt called me aside   
 and told me what had happened. 

1477
01:42:24,271 --> 01:42:27,672
 Well, it was a terrible night. 

1478
01:42:27,774 --> 01:42:29,975
       When I got upstairs      
  and found out what happened,  

1479
01:42:30,076 --> 01:42:33,144
          of course...          
  a complete shock to all of us 

1480
01:42:33,246 --> 01:42:35,447
       because we thought       
      everything was fine.      

1481
01:42:35,548 --> 01:42:38,183
  Babe said everything is fine. 

1482
01:42:41,788 --> 01:42:46,224
      He's coming home soon     
    and it would be great...    

1483
01:42:46,359 --> 01:42:49,261
    So to tell you the truth,   
     I just went to my room,    

1484
01:42:49,362 --> 01:42:53,064
       I closed the door,       
   and that's where I stayed.

 The news of Babe's death spread
  throughout the neighborhood.

 And my girlfriend called me up.

1488
01:43:07,947 --> 01:43:08,947
          She's crying.         

1489
01:43:09,048 --> 01:43:10,582
    I said, "What happened?"    

1490
01:43:10,683 --> 01:43:13,251
    "Babe Ciarlo was killed."   

1491
01:43:13,353 --> 01:43:16,788
You know, we couldn't do a thing
      for days after that.      

1492
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:19,090
        We didn't because       
 all we could think of was him. 

1493
01:43:19,191 --> 01:43:23,194
He was always so happy and jolly
    and always so fun-loving,   

1494
01:43:23,295 --> 01:43:25,531
     and then I'm thinking,     
     "He's not coming back."    

1495
01:43:25,632 --> 01:43:30,635
       And it was terrible      
  'cause you started to realize 

1496

    They're not coming back.

      Babe's mother refused     
  to believe her son was gone.  

1500
01:43:50,657 --> 01:43:52,257
  There had been some mistake.  

1501
01:43:52,358 --> 01:43:54,827
       She was sure of it.

              OLGA:             
  My mother, of course, was...  
   well, how can I explain it?  

1503
01:43:59,632 --> 01:44:02,034
       She was a disaster.      

1504
01:44:02,135 --> 01:44:05,170
       We would be getting      
          the newspaper         

1505
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:08,173
    and my mother would look    
           at pictures          

1506
01:44:08,274 --> 01:44:11,310
      and she'd say to me,      
         "There's Babe.

1508
01:44:13,112 --> 01:44:15,413
  And I'd say, "Gee, no, Mom."  

1509
01:44:15,514 --> 01:44:16,715
     "No! You have to write.    

1510
01:44:16,816 --> 01:44:18,016
       You have to write."      

1511
01:44:18,117 --> 01:44:22,020
 I don't know how many newspaper
    offices I would write to,   

1512
01:44:22,121 --> 01:44:23,755
         magazine places        
        I would write to,       

1513
01:44:23,856 --> 01:44:28,894
questioning the name of that boy
    that was in that picture    

1514
01:44:28,995 --> 01:44:32,730
because my mother always thought
          it was Babe.          

1515
01:44:32,832 --> 01:44:35,333
    But it never came to be.    

1516
01:44:38,772 --> 01:44:43,275
   It was so bad in our house   
     that nobody ever knows.    

1517
01:44:43,376 --> 01:44:48,113
    I used to play the piano    
 ever since I was a young girl. 

1518
01:44:48,448 --> 01:44:52,984
   When my father passed away   
    and my brother Babe died,   

1519
01:44:53,086 --> 01:44:55,854
     my mother had no music     
          in the house.         

1520
01:44:55,955 --> 01:44:59,958
 I never played the piano again.

   by William Walton playing)   

1522
01:45:08,901 --> 01:45:11,703
            NARRATOR:           
   By the late spring of 1944,  

1523
01:45:11,804 --> 01:45:14,973
    events were accelerating    
            at last.            

1524
01:45:15,074 --> 01:45:18,810
         In the Pacific,        
 the Americans were on the move 

1525
01:45:18,911 --> 01:45:22,247
 and a large force was steaming 
      toward the Marianas--     

1526
01:45:22,348 --> 01:45:26,518
      the islands of Guam,      
       Tinian, and Saipan.      

1527
01:45:26,619 --> 01:45:27,686
         (bomb explodes)        

1528
01:45:27,787 --> 01:45:28,854
      On the Eastern Front,     

1529
01:45:28,955 --> 01:45:31,422
    the Soviets had triumphed   
          at Leningrad,         

1530
01:45:31,524 --> 01:45:36,662
   then destroyed or captured   
   some 250,000 German troops   

1531
01:45:36,763 --> 01:45:39,531
         in the Crimea.         

1532
01:45:39,632 --> 01:45:41,032
  But the basic fact remained,  

1533
01:45:41,134 --> 01:45:45,337
    that until the Nazi grip    
  on Western Europe was broken, 

1534
01:45:45,438 --> 01:45:48,440
 Allied victory was impossible. 

1535
01:45:49,542 --> 01:45:52,478
  The German Army had taken up  
          new positions         

1536
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:55,547
    on the Adolf Hitler Line    
          north of Rome         

1537
01:45:55,648 --> 01:45:58,951
      and the greatest test     
    for the Western Allies--    

1538
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:02,421
    the long-delayed invasion   
           of France--          

1539
01:46:02,522 --> 01:46:05,723
     was now just days away.    

1540
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:11,530
      Back in Baton Rouge,      
  Quentin Aanenson from Luverne 

1541
01:46:11,630 --> 01:46:16,868
  had to say good-bye to Jackie 
      and prepare for war.      

1542
01:46:16,969 --> 01:46:22,574
            AANENSON:           
     We were very much aware    
  of the fact that it was a...  

1543
01:46:22,675 --> 01:46:27,546
         deadly calling.        

1544
01:46:27,647 --> 01:46:31,083
And we knew thatthe loss rates  
     were extremely high,       

1545
01:46:31,184 --> 01:46:36,021
     and so it was the, uh,     
 Judge Advocate General's office

1546
01:46:36,122 --> 01:46:38,690
 that put this program in place 

1547
01:46:38,792 --> 01:46:42,161
   that all of us should have   
       our wills drawn up.      

1548
01:46:42,262 --> 01:46:45,430
     And, of course, we knew    
  the reality of our situation, 

1549
01:46:45,531 --> 01:46:48,333
         and so we tried        
      to make light of it,      

1550
01:46:48,434 --> 01:46:51,269
    but, nevertheless, we...    

1551
01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:55,207
    we all signed our wills,    
       drew up our wills--      

1552
01:46:55,308 --> 01:46:58,076
 they were standard-type wills--

1553
01:46:58,177 --> 01:47:00,478
and there had to be three pilots

1554
01:47:00,579 --> 01:47:05,517
       that would witness       
     the other pilot's will.    

1555
01:47:05,618 --> 01:47:10,121
        The three pilots        
    that witnessed my will...   

1556
01:47:10,222 --> 01:47:13,391
  were all dead in six months.  

1557
01:47:27,707 --> 01:47:35,814
  (slow instrumental of "Until  
I'm in Your Arms Again" playing)
