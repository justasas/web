MAN: Luverne, Minnesota.

00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:37,447
'Rock County Star-Herald.'

3
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:40,367
"The four grim lead lines
of the newspaper seemed

4
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:43,887
"so tragically cold and bare.

5
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:47,287
"Staff Sergeant Richard E. Mueller
is reported missing

6
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:50,487
"with seven others following
the crash of a medium bomber

"Four grim lines

00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:26,287
"With hair as vivid as a June carrot

"or round the aisles of the store.

"He fairly danced or ran

"and you knew
that here was a chap

"that was going places."

Al Mclntosh.

24
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:13,567
NARRATOR: By January of 1944,
Americans all over the country

25
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,287
had already become accustomed

26
00:02:15,287 --> 00:02:17,881
to scanning their newspaper
every morning...

27
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:23,767
...hoping not to see the names
of young men they knew

28
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:27,555
listed as missing or wounded or dead.

29
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:36,407
Men and materiel
were streaming into England

30
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:39,080
in preparation for the invasion of France.

31
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:45,919
US forces were about the assault the
Marshall Islands in the central Pacific.

32
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:50,807
American and British troops in Italy

33
00:02:50,807 --> 00:02:55,287
remained mired behind
the German Gustav Line at Cassino,

34
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:58,359
unable to batter
their way through to Rome.

35
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:04,607
It was clear to everyone

36
00:03:04,607 --> 00:03:09,442
that the newspaper casualty lists
would soon be growing longer.

37
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:14,567
SHERMAN: I delivered papers.

38
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:17,127
And all of the mothers
who had somebody in the army

39
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:22,247
would have a blue star in the window
on the little flag.

40
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:26,647
And then if the son or husband
or whatever died

41
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:29,127
they'd change that to a gold star.

42
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,647
The gold star mothers were those

43
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:32,647
who had lost a family member
in the war.

44
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:38,358
And it was the fact
that the star had changed.

45
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:41,607
But I was too young

46
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:44,679
to really understand
the consequences of death.

47
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,887
NEWSREEL: Now, taking the
Nazis completely by surprise,

48
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:16,087
the Allies hurl their fleet
upon Nettuno and Anzio,

49
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:19,363
points behind the German line
south of Rome.

50
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:26,567
At dawn, landing ships and barges
stand offshore.

51
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,567
Small boats begin to pour in.

52
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,967
The initial landing
meets with no opposition.

53
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:36,207
NARRATOR: On January 22, Allied
forces landed behind the German lines

54
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:40,359
at Anzio, hoping to break the stalemate
in Italy.

55
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:47,367
Babe Ciarlo, of Waterbury,
was with them,

56
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,517
part of the 3rd Infantry Division.

57
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:02,558
The Allies had caught the enemy
totally unprepared.

58
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:07,767
But the Allied commander,
General John P. Lucas,

59
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,047
was a cautious man.

60
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:14,247
His orders were to move inland 20 miles,

61
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,287
seize the Alban hills
that overlooked Rome

62
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:21,439
and cut off the railroad line and two roads
that supplied the enemy.

63
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:27,807
Lucas wanted to be certain he had
enough men and enough firepower

64
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:29,887
to be successful.

65
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:33,687
He took nine days
to consolidate his position,

66
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:38,367
more than enough time for the Germans
to build up their defences.

67
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:43,087
By the time the Allies began to move
forward toward the Alban Hills,

68
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:47,767
the better part of eight enemy divisions -
100,000 men -

69
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:51,007
held the high ground
along the Allied perimeter,

70
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:52,998
ready for any attack.

71
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:57,447
Fire!

72
00:05:57,447 --> 00:06:00,439
(GUNFIRE, EXPLOSIONS)

73
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:11,127
Babe Ciarlo's division tried
to fight its way through the German lines

74
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:13,846
near the town of Cisterno...

75
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:18,644
...only to be hurled back toward the beach.

76
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:34,687
Unable to advance, Americans and
Britons dug in as best they could

77
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,407
on the Anzio plain.

78
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:39,687
15 miles long, 10 miles deep,

79
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:42,963
and totally exposed to enemy fire.

80
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:06,724
They would remain pinned down there
for four miserable months.

81
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:19,007
The secret landing meant
to stun the enemy had stalled,

82
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:24,764
just as the assault on the Gustav Line it
had been meant to aid had also stalled.

83
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:30,887
As Churchill said about that Anzio thing,

84
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:33,167
he said, "I thought I was
putting a wildcat ashore.

85
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,887
"It turned out to be a bloated whale."

86
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,718
Because we just sat there.

87
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:45,167
Meanwhile, the Allied armies back at
Monte Cassino were faring no better.

88
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:53,567
In February,
New Zealand and Indian troops

89
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:56,687
were ordered to take Cassino.

90
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:59,007
They failed.

91
00:07:59,007 --> 00:08:02,887
Their commander insisted
the Germans were using the abbey

92
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:09,287
as an observation post to direct
fire on the huddled men below.

93
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:11,567
Waves of American warplanes

94
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:17,164
dropped 586 tons of bombs,
turning the abbey into rubble.

95
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:34,367
The men below stood and cheered.

96
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:36,198
Some wept with joy.

97
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,239
But German resistance
was actually strengthened.

98
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:56,967
Having promised the church
not to disturb the sanctuary,

99
00:08:56,967 --> 00:09:00,207
the Nazis had never
actually used the abbey

100
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,765
as an observation post.

101
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:07,567
But they quickly turned
its ruins into a new stronghold

102
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:10,887
from which they directed fire
to destroy the men

103
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:13,606
that were again sent against them.

104
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:27,805
In March, the Indians and
New Zealanders attacked once more.

105
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:42,567
The battle seesawed back and forth
for two days and two nights

106
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:45,843
before the Allies fell back
to where they'd started.

107
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:52,363
4,000 men were lost.

108
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:56,239
The Germans held.

109
00:09:58,407 --> 00:10:04,367
In the mud and snow and bitter cold,
the killing went on.

110
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:06,597
(GUNFIRE)

111
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:30,527
CHAMBERLIN: You'd get a guy in
and he looked OK,

112
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,927
but a little further on,
there'd be a medical guy

113
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:38,087
and he'd say, you know,
"This guy's going."

114
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,727
And I said, "Should I stop?"

115
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,605
He said, "Yeah, why don't
you stop for a minute?"

116
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:48,767
So I went back and held his hand and...

117
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:52,047
...you know, he just looked up
and kind of gave a sign of recognition

118
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:54,847
and then he was gone.

119
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,360
It was quick, quick.

120
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:01,647
It's hard to describe what it's really like.

121
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:03,922
You can remember
the moments, but...

122
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:14,925
You see some guy leaving this world,
it's not a lot of fun.

123
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:27,207
NEWSREEL: At Fort Bragg,
North Carolina,

124
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:29,327
in the largest training camp
of its kind in the world,

125
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:31,527
800 coloured rookies get
their basic physical build-up

126
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:33,887
for eventful days to come.

127
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:35,927
Ten weeks ago they were
coalminers, steel workers,

128
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:37,887
mechanics, professional boxers -

129
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:39,327
in fact, most everything
from college teachers

130
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:40,647
to Pullman porters.

131
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:42,287
A few weeks more
of this intensive drill

132
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:43,687
and they'll become

133
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:46,967
the field artillery replacements
of the famed 16th Battalion,

134
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:48,167
a compact fighting force

135
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:50,367
of cannoneers,
radio and signal men,

136
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:52,367
an all-Negro group assembled
from all over the nation -

137
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:55,327
a well-trained unit ready
and eager to join the fight

138
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:58,364
for survival of the great
democracy that gave them birth.

139
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,567
Man: Alright, men.

140
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:05,487
On behalf of the United States Army,

141
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:09,927
and the reception centre
here at this camp,

142
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:12,407
we're glad to welcome you
here to today,

143
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:14,477
and into the United States Army.

144
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:20,635
We're glad to see all
of your happy, smiling faces.

145
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:25,207
You'll be converted
from a civilian

146
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:27,926
into a full-fledged soldier.

147
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:34,321
GRAY: When I went in they, uh,
had a pad.

148
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:40,247
And "Eyes - negro.

149
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:44,047
"Hair - negro.

150
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,567
"Colour - negro.

151
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,927
"Complexion - negro.

152
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:50,727
"Race - negro."

153
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:54,207
Everything was "negro"
except height and weight.

154
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:56,167
NARRATOR: Despite the bravery

155
00:12:56,167 --> 00:13:00,367
of African-Americans in all
of America's previous wars,

156
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:03,927
despite the argument made
by the NAACP and others

157
00:13:03,927 --> 00:13:07,647
that "a Jim Crow army cannot
fight for a free world,"

158
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:11,087
the armed forces
of the United States

159
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:14,636
remained strictly segregated.

160
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:22,207
Growing protest
by African-Americans

161
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:26,087
would force the military
to make a few changes.

162
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:29,327
An Army Air Corps training camp

163
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:32,727
was set up at Tuskegee Institute
in Alabama.

164
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:39,407
A single ship, the USS 'Mason',
was manned entirely by blacks -

165
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:42,683
except for her commander.

166
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:45,967
The 761 st Tank Battalion

167
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:47,887
would eventually fight in Europe,

168
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:50,647
sent to the front
by George Patton

169
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:54,167
with the admonition - "I don't
care what colour you are,

170
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,167
"so long as you go
up there and kill

171
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,725
"those Kraut sons of bitches."

172
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:03,967
The Marine Corps had refused
to accept any blacks at all,

173
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:08,647
but after 1942, as casualties
in the Pacific mounted,

174
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,367
and pressure from civil rights
groups intensified,

175
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:14,567
John Gray and others
were finally allowed

176
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:17,167
to sign on and serve...

177
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,487
...in segregated units.

178
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:22,967
GRAY: They did not intend

179
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:26,127
to have blacks as fighting units.

180
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:28,207
They intended to have them,

181
00:14:28,207 --> 00:14:32,327
if at all, as support units.

182
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:35,327
Look like you ought
to appreciate the fact

183
00:14:35,327 --> 00:14:37,167
that you're not up front.

184
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,487
But they didn't want you
to get that kind of a glory.

185
00:14:40,487 --> 00:14:44,647
NARRATOR: John Gray was sent
to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina,

186
00:14:44,647 --> 00:14:47,607
where he joined
the 51 st Defense Battalion,

187
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,167
one of only two black units

188
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:53,487
being trained for combat
in the Marine Corps.

189
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:56,807
Its commander was
Lt. Colonel Floyd Stephenson,

190
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:59,887
a veteran of the attack
on Pearl Harbor

191
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:02,367
who won his men's loyalty
by declaring,

192
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:06,246
"There is nothing that black
troops cannot be taught."

193
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:10,527
He was a far cry
from the officers

194
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,245
John Gray was used to.

195
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:15,967
GRAY: And that was different
from Major Larsen

196
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,887
who said he had been out
in the jungles

197
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:21,727
and he had fought this
and he had done that

198
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:26,047
and he came back
to find women Marines

199
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:31,405
and dog Marines
and then "you people."

200
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:36,327
We didn't like for people
to say "you people."

201
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:40,647
So instead of referring
to troops as "troops,"

202
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:44,607
they would always refer
to black troops as "you people."

203
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:46,882
And we resented that.

204
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,327
NARRATOR: John Gray and his unit
were eventually

205
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,167
sent to the South Pacific.

206
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,327
They had been trained
as expert gunners

207
00:15:56,327 --> 00:15:59,487
on 90mm and 150mm guns,

208
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,807
and were so skilled,
Gray remembered,

209
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:04,967
"We could shoot
the sting off a bee."

210
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,967
But their white commanders

211
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,447
did not see fit
to send them into battle.

212
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:13,807
The men took to calling
themselves "the lost battalion"

213
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:16,327
because they had so little to do,

214
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:19,167
and white Marines
resented their presence -

215
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:22,557
especially when Samoan women
were involved.

216
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:29,527
GRAY: And when they got a chance
to dance or something...

217
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:33,567
...and those girls were told
that we had tails.

218
00:16:33,567 --> 00:16:35,327
So when a girl
would dance with you,

219
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,364
she would reach down and try
to see if you had a tail.

220
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:47,007
But those girls would be so glad
to have the treatment.

221
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,367
So they extended, uh,

222
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:51,167
"separate, but equal,"
so to speak,

223
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,237

AANENSON: I wanted to fly fighters.

226
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,927
And by the luck of the draw,
I was sent to Harding Field

227
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:54,167
at Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

228
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:57,647
That's where they had
the P-47 Thunderbolt.

And that was the plane
I wanted to fly.

230
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:05,487
NARRATOR: The war offered Quentin
Aanenson, of Luverne, Minnesota,

231
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:08,718
a chance to realise
his boyhood dream of flying.

232
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:13,647
Colour blindness had kept him
out of the Army Air Corps

233
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:17,765
until he took the test
enough times to memorise it.

234
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:23,807
In early 1944, he was one
of hundreds of thousands of men

235
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:28,562
being trained to play their part
in the coming invasion of France.

236
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:33,647
The P-47 Thunderbolt was

237
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:35,687
a powerful airplane.

238
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:40,727
We could carry two 500-pound bombs
under the wings

239
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:44,327
or we could carry two 1,000-pound
bombs under the wings.

240
00:18:44,327 --> 00:18:47,967
We carried up to ten rockets.

241
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:51,207
We had eight.50 calibre
machine-guns

242
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:54,727
mounted in the wings
that had a rate of fire

243
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:58,807
of 600 rounds a minute per gun.

244
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:01,167
So we, in a second,

245
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,727
we could throw a hundred shells
on a target

246
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,647

that was in front of us.

only about ten days or two weeks

257
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:42,557
when I met Jackie.

258
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:47,767
I went to a dance
that was put on

259
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:51,476
by a girls' club that
she belonged to.

260
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:59,647

darling girl came up.

JACKIE GREER: And
that particular night,

262
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:06,967
I had a darling Valentine dress,

263
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:09,401
you know, the red and the white
stripes and all.

264
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:13,607
There was a song called
'Paper Doll'

265

that was so famous at that time.

266
00:20:17,807 --> 00:20:24,767
And as I took her
to dance with her, I said,

"Hello, paper doll."

269
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:36,327
and we danced
for about five minutes,

270
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:41,327
the music stopped to let
the band rest, and I went home.

271
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:42,927
And when I got home that night,

272
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:45,647
my sister was already
in bed asleep.

273
00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:49,367
We slept together,

to go overseas.

00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:08,487
We would go to parties,

279

and we saw each other
almost every night.

280

Aanenson laid down some
ground rules for Jackie.

287
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:40,767
AANENSON: So I said that

288
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:43,967
"I'd like to make
a deal with you.

289
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:48,327
"I will come back
and survive this war

290
00:21:48,327 --> 00:21:52,887
"if you will agree
that while I'm gone

291
00:21:52,887 --> 00:21:56,967
"that you will not date
any one guy

292
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,127
"more than three times."

00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:02,647
I don't know where in the world
he came up with that.

294
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,887
I never did understand it.

295
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:07,207
But the rule was,

296
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:10,327
I couldn't have over three dates

297
00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:13,167
with any one fella.

298
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:17,487
And he explained it
that I wouldn't get

299
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:21,767
too familiar with them
in three dates,

300
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:24,487
and if I couldn't have any more,
it couldn't go any further.

301
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:26,523

was like, uh, you could almost compare it
to a miniature Times Square.

00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:02,047
It was never quiet

306
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,927
because there were
so many factories

307

and each factory
had three shifts

"Good morning."

"Who are you to say
good morning to me?"

After all, I'm from Brooklyn, New York.

the impact was very great.

00:46:41,807 --> 00:46:44,767
So to tell you the truth,
I just went to my room,

687
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:48,287
I closed the door,
and that's where I stayed.

('EXILES' BY AMY BEACH PLAYS)

689
00:46:53,887 --> 00:47:00,127
NARRATOR: The news of Babe's death
spread throughout the neighbourhood.

690
00:47:00,127 --> 00:47:02,807
ANNE DEVICO: And my girlfriend called
me up.

691
00:47:02,807 --> 00:47:03,807
She's crying.

692
00:47:03,807 --> 00:47:05,767
I said, "What happened?"

693
00:47:05,767 --> 00:47:08,887
"Babe Ciarlo was killed."

694
00:47:08,887 --> 00:47:12,407
You know, we couldn't do a thing
for days after that.

695
00:47:12,407 --> 00:47:14,847
We didn't because
all we could think of was him.

696
00:47:14,847 --> 00:47:18,727
He was always so happy and jolly
and always so fun-loving,

697
00:47:18,727 --> 00:47:21,167
and then I'm thinking,
"He's not coming back."

698
00:47:21,167 --> 00:47:26,167
And it was terrible
'cause you started to realise

699
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:30,367
that this isn't just going
over there and...

700
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:32,167
They're not coming back.

701
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:34,237
Some of them aren't.

702
00:47:41,687 --> 00:47:45,727
NARRATOR: Babe's mother refused
to believe her son was gone.

703
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:50,687
There had been some mistake,
she was sure of it.

704
00:47:50,687 --> 00:47:54,567
OLGA CIARLO: My mother, of course,
was... well, how can I explain it?

705
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:57,367
She was a disaster.

706
00:47:57,367 --> 00:48:00,487
We would be getting the newspaper

707
00:48:00,487 --> 00:48:03,567
and my mother would look at pictures

708
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:08,207
and she'd say to me, "There's Babe.
That's Babe."

709
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:10,527
And I'd say, "Gee, no, Mom."

710
00:48:10,527 --> 00:48:13,767
"No! You have to write.
You have to write."

711
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:17,367
I don't know how many newspaper
offices I would write to,

712
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:19,407
magazine places I would write to,

713
00:48:19,407 --> 00:48:24,367
questioning the name of that boy
that was in that picture

714
00:48:24,367 --> 00:48:27,807
because my mother always thought
it was Babe.

715
00:48:27,807 --> 00:48:29,877
But it never came to be.

716
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:38,967
It was so bad in our house
that nobody ever knows.

717
00:48:38,967 --> 00:48:42,482
I used to play the piano
ever since I was a young girl.

718
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:48,367
When my father passed away
and my brother Babe died,

719
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:51,047
my mother had no music
in the house.

720
00:48:51,047 --> 00:48:54,483
I never played the piano again.

('TWO PIECES FOR STRINGS'
BY WILLIAM WALTON PLAYS)

722
00:49:04,247 --> 00:49:06,967
NARRATOR: By the late spring of 1944,

723
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:10,527
events were accelerating at last.

724
00:49:10,527 --> 00:49:14,487
In the Pacific,
the Americans were on the move

725
00:49:14,487 --> 00:49:17,647
and a large force was steaming
toward the Marianas -

726
00:49:17,647 --> 00:49:21,447
the islands of Guam,
Tinian, and Saipan.

727
00:49:21,447 --> 00:49:22,807
(BOMB EXPLODES)

728
00:49:22,807 --> 00:49:24,287
On the Eastern front,

729
00:49:24,287 --> 00:49:27,047
the Soviets had triumphed
at Leningrad,

730
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:31,567
then destroyed or captured
some 250,000 German troops

731
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:33,444
in the Crimea.

732
00:49:34,647 --> 00:49:37,967
But the basic fact remained,
that until the Nazi grip

733
00:49:37,967 --> 00:49:42,961
on Western Europe was broken,
Allied victory was impossible.

734
00:49:44,887 --> 00:49:47,807
The German army had taken up
new positions

735
00:49:47,807 --> 00:49:51,007
on the Adolf Hitler Line
north of Rome

736
00:49:51,007 --> 00:49:54,327
and the greatest test
for the Western Allies -

737
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:57,447
the long-delayed invasion
of France -

738
00:49:57,447 --> 00:50:00,245
was now just days away.

739
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:07,167
Back in Baton Rouge, Quentin
Aanenson from Luverne

740
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:11,240
had to say goodbye to Jackie
and prepare for war.

741
00:50:12,727 --> 00:50:17,527
AANENSON: We were very much aware
of the fact that it was a...

742
00:50:17,527 --> 00:50:21,679
...deadly calling.

743
00:50:22,927 --> 00:50:26,727
And we knew that the loss rates
were extremely high,

744
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:31,207
and so it was the, uh,
Judge Advocate General's Office

745
00:50:31,207 --> 00:50:34,207
that put this program in place

746
00:50:34,207 --> 00:50:37,767
that all of us should have
our wills drawn up.

747
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:40,767
And, of course, we knew
the reality of our situation,

748
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,367
and so we tried
to make light of it,

749
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:46,727
but, nevertheless, we...

750
00:50:46,727 --> 00:50:50,407
...we all signed our wills,
drew up our wills -

751
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:53,287
they were standard-type wills -

752
00:50:53,287 --> 00:50:55,927
and there had to be three pilots

753
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:59,397
that would witness
the other pilot's will.

754
00:51:01,047 --> 00:51:04,887
The three pilots
that witnessed my will...

755
00:51:04,887 --> 00:51:07,959
...were all dead in six months.
