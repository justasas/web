00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:16,527
SAM HYNES: I'm not sure
I can speak about

2
00:00:16,527 --> 00:00:20,447
why human beings, in general,
go to war.

3
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:24,487
I think that's
a pretty large category.

4
00:00:24,487 --> 00:00:27,887
I can only speak about why

5
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:30,526
18-year-olds from Minneapolis
go to war.

6
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:36,639
They go to war because
it's impossible not to.

7
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:43,047
Because a current
is established in the society

8
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:46,367
so swift, flowing toward war,

9
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:50,724
that every young man who steps
into it is carried downstream.

10
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:59,847
I think we were really reluctant
to get into this subject.

11
00:00:59,847 --> 00:01:02,367
We'd made a film on the Civil War,
it was successful.

12
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:03,847
Didn't wanna be typecast,

13
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:06,727
didn't wanna be playing
to the success of that.

14
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:10,087
But people would just call us up
all the time and say,

15
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:13,727
"You gotta tell my father's story.
He's just now beginning to talk."

16
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:16,607
Or, "My father passed away
and he never told us what he did

17
00:01:16,607 --> 00:01:19,447
"and we found these letters
between him and my mom."

18
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:23,247
Or somebody will come and say,
"I landed at Omaha Beach.

19
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:24,807
"How come you haven't done
something?"

20
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:28,647
And that began to erode our
conviction not to go to war again.

21
00:01:28,647 --> 00:01:30,487
And, of course,
that's a part of it too -

22
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:34,087
not experiencing that
really just visceral sense.

23
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:38,127
We don't know any other way than to
ask the question, "What was it like?"

24
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:40,127
And if you ask, "What was it like?"

25
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:45,679
You invite so much sadness and loss
and terror, in some cases.

26
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:55,007
The real war involves getting
down there and killing people

27
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:58,807
and being killed yourself,
or just barely escaping it.

28
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:01,367
And it gives you attitudes
about life and death

29
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:04,007
that are unobtainable anywhere else.

30
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:06,687
(EXPLOSION)

31
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:08,527
We wanted to do something
experiential,

32
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:11,007
that would help our audience
understand what it was like

33
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:14,567
to live through the war
and to fight in the war.

34
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,087
And we realised that
if we didn't do it now,

35
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:19,087
we wouldn't have the chance
to do it later

36
00:02:19,087 --> 00:02:21,687
because so many veterans
were passing from the scene.

37
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:25,047
And then I heard that 1,000 veterans
of the Second World War

38
00:02:25,047 --> 00:02:27,007
were dying a day in America.

39
00:02:27,007 --> 00:02:28,687
And that our kids -

40
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:33,247
many of them the grandchildren
of those brave soldiers -

41
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:36,447
think we fought with the Germans

42
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,087
against the Russians
in the Second World War.

43
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:39,567
And I just thought, "Oh, my God."

44
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,047
How could the greatest cataclysm
in history -

45
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,447
as we call it in the film -
how could that get lost?

46
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:45,287
And if we lose that,
what do we lose?

47
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:49,287
And we felt almost honour bound
to go in and try to figure out

48
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,607
a new way to tell
the Second World War,

49
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:53,086
this time from the bottom up...

50
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:56,847
...not distracted by the generals
and presidents

51
00:02:56,847 --> 00:02:58,405
and celebrities of the war.

52
00:02:59,407 --> 00:03:01,527
Not distracted by armaments
and strategies

53
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:06,527
but by focusing on what so-called
ordinary people experienced

54
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,567
and to tell the story
from their point of view.

55
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:12,321
And to honour, bear witness,
to what they went through.

56
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:18,047
We tried really hard to find a way
to connect what was happening at home

57
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:20,807
to what was happening
to the soldiers overseas.

58
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:25,207
There's this gulf between
the life people had at home

59
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:27,596
and what the soldiers were
experiencing on the front lines.

60
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:32,127
It's sort of an unbridgeable chasm,

61
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:34,007
except that there's the thread
that connects,

62
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:35,687
which is the human beings
and their families,

63
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:37,166
or their loved ones, back home.

64
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:41,687
And if you can really care about
someone who's overseas

65
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:45,367
because his sister is worrying about
"Where is he?" and "Is he OK?"

66
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:48,927
You can sort of understand
how this was a family story.

67
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:52,317
And, by extension, the whole country
was involved in it in that way.

68
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:57,607
OLGA CIARLO: She'd wait every single
morning on the porch

69
00:03:57,607 --> 00:04:01,247
for the mailman to come
to bring her a letter.

70
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:03,887
And finally she would get a letter,
she'd be so happy.

71
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:06,447
She'd run upstairs
and she'd let us read the letter,

72
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,563
'cause my mother
couldn't read English.

73
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:12,807
MAN: "Mom, How are you getting along?

74
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:15,685
"Fine, I hope,
and keeping happy always.

75
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,127
"I know I haven't written to you
for a long time

76
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:22,324
"and I hope you understand the army
has been keeping me pretty busy.

77
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:27,719
"I'm doing good and always happy
because I know you're OK.

78
00:04:28,847 --> 00:04:30,326
"Love, Babe."

79
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:45,327
KEN BURNS: This is the greatest thing
that's happened in the world.

80
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,247
I mean, the biggest thing.

81
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:51,967
And how do you limit it? Where do you
begin? What do you have to tell?

82
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:55,847
How do you get access to it
in a new way?

83
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:57,527
And we focused, after some time,

84
00:04:57,527 --> 00:05:01,807
on the idea that we would do the war
from the perspective

85
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:05,087
of four geographically distributed
American towns.

86
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:07,447
It was a little bit of
a trial-and-error process

87
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:09,607
to come up with
what those towns would be.

88
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:11,087
And we started with the idea

89
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:12,687
of picking some place
in the north-east,

90
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,847
partly out of convenience to us
because we live in the north-east.

91
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:18,527
And really with the idea
that you could pick any town

92
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:21,567
and find great stories because
the war did touch everybody.

93
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,647
We chose Waterbury, Connecticut -
Brass City -

94
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:27,287
that had contributed so much
to the war effort.

95
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:30,847
Had made lipstick holders
and cocktail shakers and alarm clocks

96
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,327
before the war.

97
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,847
Continued to make those alarm clocks,

98
00:05:33,847 --> 00:05:36,567
but then it was said there wasn't
a British or American soldier

99
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:39,327
that wasn't wearing or shooting
or riding on something

100
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:41,124
that had been made in Waterbury,
Connecticut.

101
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:45,287
It wasn't so easy to find veterans

102
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:47,527
who could talk about
their war experiences.

103
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,447
We met hundreds of veterans

104
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:52,327
and really only a small percentage
of them were able,

105
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:55,247
for a variety of reasons,
to share what they'd been through.

106
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:58,367
And so we thought maybe instead
of just picking a town randomly

107
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:00,127
and seeing what we could find there,

108
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,967
we'd find some interesting veterans
and see where they were from

109
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,447
and see if their town might work,

110
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,087
and sort of come at it backwards.

111
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:07,887
We chose Mobile, Alabama.

112
00:06:07,887 --> 00:06:11,047
We'd read a phenomenal memoir

113
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:12,527
of a guy named Eugene Sledge,

114
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:15,287
who passed away just as we were
beginning the film.

115
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,527
But when we went to Mobile
to seek out his family

116
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,287
and tell them how much we liked it

117
00:06:19,287 --> 00:06:21,327
and thought Mobile might be
a possibility,

118
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:25,047
they introduced us to his best friend
and his sister

119
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:27,887
and then their community,
and we went out farther afield.

120
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,807
And Mobile became
this wonderful place.

121
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:32,087
More of the folks that we interview
are from Mobile

122
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,487
than any other place.

123
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:37,807
Factory workers from poor towns,
African Americans,

124
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:40,407
old Mobile aristocracy.

125
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:43,807
In fact, one of our great choruses,
Katharine Phillips -

126
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:45,287
the sister of Sid Phillips,

127
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:48,767
the best friend of Eugene Sledge,
our memoirist -

128
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:51,127
is in almost every episode
of the film

129
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:52,767
and really helps guide you along

130
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,997
from what it means to be
at the home front.

131
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:59,363
KATHARINE PHILLIPS: We had started
losing boys in the neighbourhood.

132
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:05,807
The boy up here on the corner was
a navy pilot and he was killed.

133
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:09,247
The boy down the street
was an air force pilot

134
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:11,887
and he was missing in action.

135
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:16,687
They started disappearing
all around us.

136
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:21,447
And my mother spent her time
going to visit the other mothers,

137
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:23,407
consoling them.

138
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:28,356
And it was a very, very fearful
time, it really was.

139
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,687
We couldn't make a film about
the Second World War

140
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,327
and not include
the Japanese American experience,

141
00:07:34,327 --> 00:07:36,687
and particularly the experience
of internment.

142
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,767
Therefore we had to pick something
on the west coast,

143
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:42,767
because only Japanese Americans
on the west coast were interned.

144
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:44,727
We wanted to talk about
Japanese Americans,

145
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:48,447
not only their internment
but the much less-known story

146
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:53,727
of the magnificent 442nd Regiment
that was as brave as any regiment

147
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,487
in the history of
the United States Army.

148
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:59,287
And their amazing adventures
in a country...

149
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:03,647
...fighting for a country, whose
parents were locked up back home

150
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:08,118
and under guard and machine guns
in the United States.

151
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,527
And then we needed a small town.
That was the toughest of them all.

152
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:14,127
We wanted to pick something
in the Midwest

153
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:17,087
because that was one area of the
country we hadn't touched at all.

154
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:21,167
And again we thought we could just
pick any random small town,

155
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:26,799
but it might be hard to find really
memorable war stories from that town.

156
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:32,487
And we found a fighter pilot
who lives outside of Washington, DC.

157
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:35,327
And his story was so amazing
and he was so amazing.

158
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,807
Such a strong character.

159
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:41,482
His story so unbelievable
that Hollywood couldn't make it up.

160
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,847
We asked him where he was from.
He said, "Luverne, Minnesota."

161
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:48,847
And we tracked it down. It's in the
lower left-hand corner of Minnesota.

162
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:51,919
Not far from Sioux Falls,
South Dakota.

163
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:57,327
Luverne turned out to be
unimaginably rich,

164
00:08:57,327 --> 00:09:01,647
with the discovery of Al Mclntosh,
the editor of the Rock County paper,

165
00:09:01,647 --> 00:09:03,607
who covered the daily experience

166
00:09:03,607 --> 00:09:07,646
of how the war touched really every
family in that town, in his column.

167
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:11,087
It was the godsend
of this production,

168
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,407
getting in touch with
Quentin Aanenson, our fighter.

169
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:17,007
And then, by extension, Luverne
and its newspaper editor,

170
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,407
who died in the '70s, Al Mclntosh.

171
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:22,447
Which we've had to have
Tom Hanks - Tom Hanks -

172
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:25,727
read and bring to life
as no-one else on earth could do.

173
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:28,367
August 1941.

174
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:32,487
Miss Aagot Rylund, who was in town
visiting her brother,

175
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:35,687
knows what it is to see vast sections
of a city ripped to ruin

176
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:37,607
by German bombs.

177
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:41,007
And she remembers the nights
that London burned,

178
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:44,367
how she could read a letter
by the unbelievable glare

179
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,119
of the far-off flames.

180
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,287
KEN BURNS: It was from
those four places -

181
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:54,567
and if you look at a map, they really
anchor, they hold down the country -

182
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:58,487
we began to realise that we could
comprehend the whole.

183
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:02,207
We could get a sense of what
the Second World War was like.

184
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:04,447
Paradoxically, from the bottom up,

185
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:07,527
and following these stories
and getting invested in these people,

186
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:11,007
you could learn a lot more about
the whole arc of the war as well.

187
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:14,079
That was the great surprising gift
of how we approached it.

188
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:44,607
We are going on our third
early morning dawn shoot

189
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,236
and it's about 4:40 in the morning.

190
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:51,447
And we're not exactly sure
where we're gonna shoot today.

191
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:55,127
We're gonna quickly run up
to the Catholic cemetery

192
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,287
and see if that's a nice view.

193
00:10:57,287 --> 00:11:02,727
And then if not, we'll probably go
to another farm.

194
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,447
Morning.
Good morning, Allen.

195
00:11:05,447 --> 00:11:08,245
Do you see your coffee in there?
I smell it.

196
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:10,727
We have to get up really early

197
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:13,447
because we'd like to be able to see
the beautiful sky.

198
00:11:13,447 --> 00:11:16,687
And once the sun comes up, the sky
no longer has so much colour in it,

199
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:21,327
so if you get up before the sun
comes up, the sky is gorgeous.

200
00:11:21,327 --> 00:11:23,247
And then we can try to find something

201
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:26,447
to basically silhouette it
against that gorgeous sky.

202
00:11:26,447 --> 00:11:29,727
So, we have a chance of really doing
two different kinds of shoots.

203
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:32,007
If we get up before the sun comes up,

204
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:35,927
we can do a silhouette of something
against the gorgeous sky.

205
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:38,247
And then when the sun crests
and we have first light

206
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:41,687
we can get that golden light hitting
different things we want to show.

207
00:11:41,687 --> 00:11:43,643
So we have to get up early.

208
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:47,366
Take a look at this.

209
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,047
Yeah, look at the kick
on that window,

210
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,527
and then close to the window.

211
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:54,119
Oh, gorgeous. That's fantastic.

212
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:58,087
LYNN NOVICK: We had a lot of fun
getting to know these four towns

213
00:11:58,087 --> 00:11:59,567
and the people in them,

214
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,407
and trying to find ways
to tell the stories

215
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,247
of what the war had meant
in these places.

216
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:06,207
And we went about it
in a variety of ways.

217
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:08,527
We focused first on finding out

218
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:12,407
what was the archival resources
that were available to us -

219
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:16,287
photographs, home movies,
newspapers, letters, etc.

220
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:18,167
And we went to historical societies
and public libraries

221
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,647
primarily for that.

222
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:22,847
And we put articles in the newspapers
asking for people to contact us

223
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:25,527
if they had stories to share
or materials to share.

224
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:28,327
And we were just deluged,
basically, with materials.

225
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:30,887
Why don't you tell us what you've
brought for us today?

226
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:33,967
Phone calls, emails,
all kinds of things.

227
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,967
A lot of the process
was actually just going through

228
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,087
and weeding through
all this material.

229
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:39,807
Everything that was sent to us
was read...

230
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,367
Oh, that's a great picture.

231
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:43,727
...and was responded to,
and it was a huge job.

232
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,799
But we found treasures we never
would have found any other way.

233
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:50,647
KEN BURNS: We live in
a digital world now.

234
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:52,887
We used to be able,
in every film, to tell you

235
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:55,887
we shot 1,050 rolls of film,

236
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,764
and that represented
this many hours.

237
00:12:58,767 --> 00:13:00,247
We don't have that anymore.

238
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:03,087
Sometimes the photographs don't get
photographed - they get digitised.

239
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:06,327
And then they're into our system,
and the movements are made on them.

240
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,087
And I kind of regret,
being a kind of hands-on person,

241
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:10,847
the loss of a lot of that.

242
00:13:10,847 --> 00:13:13,127
But I think it's fair to say
that we have

243
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,127
hundreds of hours of interviews,

244
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,647
hundreds and hundreds of hours
of still photographs,

245
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:22,367
and thousands of hours of footage
that we went through to distil.

246
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,847
You visit hundreds and hundreds
of archives.

247
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,807
And it's not just the places
where you think,

248
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,207
'cause you're not always
just getting the stuff of the war.

249
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:31,407
You wanna get the stuff
when it's not war.

250
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:32,887
What it was like back home.

251
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:34,367
So, I see this film as

252
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:38,287
a kind of great merger
of a vast public archive,

253
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:41,927
which was from hundreds of places
around the world,

254
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:46,607
from Tokyo to Moscow to Berlin
to London - everywhere.

255
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:48,447
And hundreds of archives
in the United States,

256
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:50,767
including the National Archives
and the Library of Congress.

257
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:52,407
Particularly the National Archives,

258
00:13:52,407 --> 00:13:56,047
which has so many of the treasures
of what we've done.

259
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:58,402
And merge that with
the personal archives.

260
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:03,007
We've got the home movies
of the guy in Sacramento

261
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,847
who's describing going to
the movies,

262
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:08,487
and then coming and playing war
with wood guns in the driveway.

263
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:09,967
We've got him in colour.

264
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:12,003
It's real. You know it's happened.

265
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:15,127
We've got their high school
graduation picture.

266
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:17,167
You've got the exterior
of your house.

267
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,806
There's almost no -
I'm proud to say - re-creation.

268
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:22,447
In one point in
the Battle of Guadalcanal

269
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:24,517
we just took our camera
and went through a jungle.

270
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:28,607
At another point, when the news of
D-day is reaching the United States,

271
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,847
we turned on the lights
in the middle of the night

272
00:14:30,847 --> 00:14:32,607
at Al Mclntosh's house.

274
00:14:35,647 --> 00:14:37,285
OK, yeah, that's nice. Hold on.

00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:40,567
Perfect, perfect. Just sit tight.

KEN BURNS: That's really his house.

277
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,647
We turn on the lights at that house

278
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:46,087

290
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,207
QUENTIN AANENSON:
Early in the morning

291
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,207
we were awakened from our bunks

292
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:38,087
and we were told to
get in our flight gear

293
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,407
and meet in the briefing room.

294
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,087
And we knew it was something serious.

295
00:15:43,087 --> 00:15:45,442
We could tell by just the atmosphere.

296
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,367
And as we took our seats,

297
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:52,687
and they pulled the curtain back,
they said,

298
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:54,882
"Gentlemen, this is it.

299
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:58,438
"The invasion of France has begun."

300
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:06,967
We decided not to use historians

301
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,887
or so-called experts in the film.

302
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:12,367
We really wanted it to be
the bottom-up story of regular people

303
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:14,727
who anyone of us could know
and could be friends with,

304
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:17,446
or could have in our neighbourhood
or backyard.

305
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:19,927
We want someone to tell you,

306
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:21,927
"I was there and this is
what happened to me."

307
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:24,567
But that means that we had a lot
to ask of those witnesses.

308
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,447
To give us not just
their own experience,

309
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:29,527
but a little bit broader meaning
of why we should care about it

310
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:31,407
and what it means for all of us.

311
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:35,923
And, so, finding the people to talk
who could do that was a challenge.

312
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:42,447
No-one had ever really asked me
about my experiences.

313
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:47,247

we all talk about.

boyfriends or relatives

in the armed forces.

Pearl Harbor got bombed

it was the eighth.

Same day, and we were bombed
a few hours later.

I'd heard of Ken Burns before

331
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:42,567
because I was a fan of
a lot of his projects -

332
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:48,367
'Baseball' and 'Civil War'
and 'Jazz'.

333
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,847

to have a great experience.

336
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:09,047
Then, all of a sudden, we were having
more of a great experience

337
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,047
than we really had reckoned for.

338
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,686
We were scared to death, of course.

339
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:18,007
Parts of the film that
struck me the most, I would think,

340
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:21,327
were the accuracy of
the Bulge in the snow.

341
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:23,047
And having been there,

342
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:26,847
I remembered it as being
terribly, terribly cold

343
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:29,727
and terribly uncomfortable
for a very long time.

344
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:31,877
But it looked
worse than I remembered.

345
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:38,007
ASAKO TOKUNO: The Lost Battalion
was a rescue mission,

346
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:40,887
which was conducted by the 442 -

347
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,957
that's my brother-in-law's unit.

348
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:50,487
I knew about the fact that
they had rescued these men.

349
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:55,207
I didn't realise how terrible.
It was devastating for them.

350
00:18:55,207 --> 00:19:00,047
It was quite a revelation anyway to
know the story the way it happened

351
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:04,165
and to see it being told by
the fellas who were there.

352
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,367
QUENTIN AANENSON: It was on one
of my very early missions

353
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,967
that I first knew
I had killed men.

354
00:19:13,967 --> 00:19:18,087
And I remember the impact
it had on me

355
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:21,167
when I could see my bullets
just tearing into them.

356
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:24,207
And I was doing it knowing
I had to do it.

357
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:25,686
That it was my job.

358
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:32,527
I do not look at history

359
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:35,367
with a cavalier viewpoint.

360
00:19:35,367 --> 00:19:37,607
It has to be right.

361
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:39,563
Or to me it's totally wrong.

362
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:43,037
When we saw the entire film...

363
00:19:45,007 --> 00:19:47,167
...the seven episodes -

364
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:51,607
at the end of each episode,
Jackie and I looked at each other

365
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,156
and tried to talk
and tried to discuss it.

366
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:59,887
But it became so overpowering,

367
00:19:59,887 --> 00:20:04,127
in an historical sense,
in an emotional sense,

368
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:09,367
that we almost had to take a break
in there

369
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:13,121
and sit it out for a few days.

370
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:19,967
This film just did everything that
you would hope for and dream about

371
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:23,647
in a film that related to
World War II

372
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:26,081
and the massiveness
of that enterprise.

373
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,847
This memory, which is not distant,

374
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:36,607
has just been kept so secret in this
such admirably reticent generation

375
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:40,567
that we feel, more than anything,
privileged

376
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:43,447
to have been able to
bear witness to their testimony.

377
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:48,247
To have been ushered in
to some of those dark rooms

378
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:53,087
and been able to construct
a narrative based on, not secrets,

379
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:55,887
but truths that they saw
when they were young.

380
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:00,167
They suddenly realise that their
memory was their greatest asset

381
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,247
and our inheritance.

382
00:21:02,247 --> 00:21:04,567
And that somewhere along the line,

383
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:07,687
those that could began to speak,

384
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:10,645
and we were just ready to listen.

385
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,487
LYNN NOVICK: Starting this project
was definitely intimidating

386
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,967
because it's such a big subject,

387
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,887
and you could go
so many different directions.

388
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:34,207
MAN ON TAPE: On one of
the largest sugar plantations

389
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:36,167
on the Philippine island of Luzon.

390
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:37,647
Just a few frames, yeah.

391
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:39,647
KEN BURNS: Those of us
who've worked on these films

392
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:41,887
sort of feel like, "Yikes,"
at the beginning,

393
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:43,367
"what have we done?"

394
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:45,367
But you're sort of like
getting up in the morning

395
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:47,367
and putting on your pants
one leg at a time.

396
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:48,846
You just start.

397
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:52,527
LYNN NOVICK: It was just
a daily process of discovery

398
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:55,607
that you could find things
and be open to them and say,

399
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,207
"Didn't know that.
We can put that in."

400
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,087
And, so, that's part of
the fun of it,

401
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:01,965
is that we get to discover things
along the way and then use them.

402
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:06,607
SARAH BOTSTEIN: The organisational
process of dealing with this material

403
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:08,527
is a daunting task.

404
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,647
The producers would narrow down
the material

405
00:22:10,647 --> 00:22:13,287
so that when an editor sat down
to edit a scene,

406
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:19,362
he or she could really begin to get
the elements to sew a scene together.

407
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:22,007
It's the night before
the Japanese came...

408
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,847
Two nights before the Japanese
came into Manila.

409
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:25,327
And they'd been there
for several days.

410
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:26,807
We can still do this.

411
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:30,647
So, we go back to
the night-time shot of Manila Bay.

412
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:32,247
KEN BURNS: This is
a huge distillation process.

413
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:33,727
That's what it's about.

414
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:39,887
Our job, in the end, is to actually
figure out a way to make this... this.

415
00:22:39,887 --> 00:22:44,207
Now, 14.5 hours may seem like that,
but it used to be more than that.

416
00:22:44,207 --> 00:22:47,847
And we beg your indulgence for
the amount of time it takes,

417
00:22:47,847 --> 00:22:49,326
but we think it's worthwhile.

418
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:53,487
MAN ON TAPE: What followed
would be remembered as

419
00:22:53,487 --> 00:22:55,603
the Bataán Death March.

420
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:01,407
GLENN FRAZIER: If we had known
what was ahead of us

421
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:04,847
at the beginning of
the Bataán Death March

422
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:06,405
I would have taken death.

423
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,127
LYNN NOVICK: We wanted to honour
the experience of the veterans

424
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:12,607
who fought in the war -

425
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:15,207
the men and women who really
put their lives on the line.

426
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:18,087
And the best way to do that,
we came to understand,

427
00:23:18,087 --> 00:23:21,407
was to allow them to bear witness
to their own stories

428
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:24,683
in the most direct
and unsentimental way.

429
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:35,563
NARRATOR: At dawn,
on August 7, 1942...

430
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:39,087
...American land forces
went on the offensive

431
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:41,167
for the first time
in the Second World War.

432
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,967
We should come to the second.
Why not start it from the get-go?

433
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:45,487
(All agree)
Right?

434
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:47,527
KEN BURNS: We cover 25
or so battles, pretty -

435
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:50,887
I don't want to say comprehensively,
but you get to know them,

436
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,927
and you feel you know them
from the inside out.

437
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:55,487
And that's what we wanted to do.

438
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:59,287
And some battles are just atrocious.
They're horrible.

439
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:02,727
And it was so hard for us to do it
emotionally.

440
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:04,407
Then others were simply complicated.

441
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:08,727
At the end of our first episode
is the first major offensive action

442
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:11,207
that the United States takes
in the land battle,

443
00:24:11,207 --> 00:24:12,720
and that's in Guadalcanal.

444
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:17,687
NARRATOR: No-one had any idea
how long, how bloody

445
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:21,887
and how consequential
the battle for Guadalcanal would be.

446
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:23,727
KEN BURNS: It goes on for months,

447
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:27,247
and that's a difficult
kind of battle to cover

448
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:29,967
because you want something to happen,
and it happens spasmodically.

449
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:32,767
And you think, "Oh, there it is,
and we've won. Oh, we haven't won."

450
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,247
It just keeps going on and on.

451
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:36,087
And it took us a long time

452
00:24:36,087 --> 00:24:39,007
to sort of break the back
of the issues in Guadalcanal,

453
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:41,647
and I'm now really happy about
how we did it.

454
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,527
So that one is a kind of
technical problem,

455
00:24:43,527 --> 00:24:46,087
and then there's the emotional stuff.

456
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:49,603
SIDNEY PHILLIPS: We understood that
we might be expendable.

457
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:53,007
It had become sort of
the established thing,

458
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:59,007
and we knew our country
was not yet heavily armed.

459
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:03,327
And, yes, we did feel that
we might be expendable.

460
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,806
We really did.

461
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:09,847
LYNN NOVICK: I don't think we really
understood how horrible the war was

462
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:11,326
for people who fought in it.

463
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:16,967
It's hard to really, I think,
appreciate from 60 years later

464
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:19,607
what it would have been like
to see your best friend blown up,

465
00:25:19,607 --> 00:25:21,607
or to kill someone at close range

466
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:23,086
and have their blood
splatter over you.

467
00:25:24,287 --> 00:25:25,767
It's kind of unimaginable.

468
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:29,316
And yet we felt we wanted to
try to imagine the unimaginable.

469
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:33,247
KEN BURNS: It's a long process.

470
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:35,527
And I'm so grateful
that public television

471
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:38,687
gives us the chance to do that.

472
00:25:38,687 --> 00:25:40,407
It's not a product.

473
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:44,887
It's not a commodity that has
a beginning, middle and end.

474
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:47,567
This is something that we love,

475
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:49,887
and we wanna work
and caress and cajole,

476
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:52,767
and rework and re-edit and rewrite
and do all those things

477
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:57,447
until we think,
for our own subjective view,

478
00:25:57,447 --> 00:25:58,927
that we've got it right

479
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:00,758
and it's time to share it
with everybody else.

(PROJECTOR WHIRRS)

481
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:10,287
LYNN NOVICK: All the footage
that we were able to get

482
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:12,007
from commercial archives
and from the National Archives

483
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:13,645
came to us without sound.

484
00:26:15,647 --> 00:26:18,287
It was sometimes
extraordinary action footage -

485
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,647
very vivid, exciting.

486
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:23,607
And you could see guns going off,
you could see things exploding,

487
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:26,280
you could see fire,
but you couldn't hear anything.

488
00:26:28,447 --> 00:26:31,407
When we locked our picture
and started to add sound,

489
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:33,207
our sound editors got very excited.

490

(ARTILLERY FIRE AND EXPLOSIONS)

491
00:26:37,927 --> 00:26:39,407
Found out, for example,

492
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:41,247
the sound that this
particular kind of machine gun -

493
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:42,727
what kind of sound does that make?

494
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,487
Or what kind of sound does
a German 88 artillery piece make

495
00:26:45,487 --> 00:26:47,087
when it's going off, or a tank?

496
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:49,727
What track's the marching on
going out,

497
00:26:49,727 --> 00:26:52,887
and what track the car pass
is coming in.

498
00:26:52,887 --> 00:26:56,287

amazing assortment of sound effects.

I like that better.

This is the most sophisticated
soundtrack we've ever completed,

501
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:05,887
and it's taken us

00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,927

locked the picture

KEN BURNS: It is hugely important
to us that the planes buzz you.

That the debris from an explosion
falls on your shoulders.

the tiniest fraction of a sense

of what it might have been like

512
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:41,396
for these kids to have
gone through what they did.

513
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:45,647
We had a veteran who came in

514
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:47,887
and he said,
"I've waited all my life

515
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:50,640
"to have something show it
the way it actually was."

We had a lot of fun
with the music on this show.

521
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:32,287
I think, going in,
we thought we'd probably have

522
00:28:32,287 --> 00:28:35,199
a lot music of the time,
and we didn't know what else.

523
00:28:38,247 --> 00:28:41,603
We were lucky enough to get Wynton
Marsalis to compose several pieces.

524
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:45,007
We showed him some clips of the film,

525
00:28:45,007 --> 00:28:47,007
and he really understood
what we were trying to do

526
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:48,725
and composed some spectacular music.

Today is a recording session
for the 'War' film.

528
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:59,687
We've done some cello and
sort of standard piano things.

529
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:03,087
And we've asked Wynton to
compose some original music for us

with John Gray,

who lives in
a segregated part of town...

534
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:15,767
And what he's done is
created a massive suite

535
00:29:15,767 --> 00:29:19,407
that takes those four towns
and divides nearly every one in two,

536
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:23,327
and creates a set of music
that's of the flavour of the town,

537
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:24,847
but has a unified theme.

WYNTON MARSALIS: It starts
with four towns

540
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:46,522
where he wanted a central theme
that was evocative of America.

541
00:29:47,527 --> 00:29:50,887
Something that was related to kinda
the early roots of the country,

542
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:52,967
but had like American
vernacular songs

543
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:56,487
but could be adaptable to kinda
swing and the music of the period.

544
00:29:56,487 --> 00:30:00,799
And a theme that could
be utilised in some form...

...in four different ways

546
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:08,607

of the four different cities,

and their way of life.

OLGA CIARLO: Waterbury,
where we lived,

549
00:30:14,087 --> 00:30:16,807
there were a lot of Italian people.

550
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:19,967
They had made a good business
for themselves

551
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:21,927
and were very well-liked.

552
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:24,600
We had a wonderful neighbourhood.

553
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:28,527
We had parties every single Sunday.

554
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:32,247

556
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:40,687
KEN BURNS: This process
begins with me,

557
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:43,127
who, I am completely inarticulate
about music.

558
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:44,887
I sort of know what I like.

559
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:47,567
I don't have any language
to express what I like.

560
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:51,407
Nor do I have any musical talent
to be able to actually do it.

561
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:54,167
So it becomes a kind of gesturing,

562
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:55,767
as if you're trying to
speak to somebody

563
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,807
in a language that
they don't understand.

564
00:30:57,807 --> 00:30:59,287
And Wynton, with this patience,

565
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:02,447
sits in his living room,
on his piano, and sort of says,

566
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:03,927
"Well, what about this?"

567
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:06,007
And he'll play different themes.
And I'll go, "Yes."

568
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:07,647
Or, "What about this way?"

569
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:09,956
And then all of a sudden
something emerges.

570
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:15,881
Just something real light.
That's the tempo.

571
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:26,207
KEN BURNS: To me, these are some of
the happiest days of making films.

572
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:29,407
On a project like this that will last
four or five or six years,

573
00:31:29,407 --> 00:31:31,807
the days where you
come into this room

574
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:37,567
and there's bits of wood and brass
and catgut and other stuff.

575
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:40,487
And these people walk in,
very much like ourselves,

576
00:31:40,487 --> 00:31:43,567
who suddenly are able to come in
and do something.

577
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:48,247
And that you leave at the end of
the day with this new thing - music.

578
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:50,647
I mean, it seems so obvious,
but it makes us happy.

to spend a day like this,

KEN BURNS: The fascination
for the Second World War

586
00:32:24,727 --> 00:32:27,687
will never end -
and it's understandable.

587

Even as that generation dies away
and passes completely,

588
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:35,280
this is still the biggest event
in human history.

LYNN NOVICK: It's seemingly a very
clear-cut black-and-white war.

There's the good guys
and there's the bad guys.

And the bad guys are so bad.

And we won, so it's
a triumphant story

593
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:54,035
that we can all appreciate
and celebrate.

594
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:57,847
And then it's also
this terrible cataclysm

595
00:32:57,847 --> 00:32:59,997
that killed so many
millions of people.

596
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:04,447
There's the twin fascination
of the horror of it

and also the triumphant narrative of it.

00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:09,767
KEN BURNS: We shoot in film,

599
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:12,127
and every 12 minutes
we have to change the roll.

600
00:33:12,127 --> 00:33:14,287
And inevitably
you go into somebody's house,

601
00:33:14,287 --> 00:33:15,767
or you're filming them
where they live,

602
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:18,567
and their wife or their son-in-law
or the daughter's there.

603
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:21,887
And quite often, in between the reel,
somebody would say,

604
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:23,607
"Honey, you never told me that."

605
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:26,440
And they would have just described
a horrific, horrific action.

606
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:30,367
LYNN NOVICK:
You sometimes open things up

607
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,847
that their family members
have not heard.

608
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:35,087
And that was amazing
to have someone afterwards say,

609
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:37,687
"Dad never told us about
what he saw.

610
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:39,287
"He never described it
quite in that way."

611

Or, "We've heard that story
a lot of times,

"but never quite the way
he told it to you."

613
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:49,407
We have a sense that this unusually
admirably reticent generation

614
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:51,007
didn't talk about it.

615
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:53,807
And then towards the end of their
life, they began to talk about it.

616
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:55,927
Intimations of their own mortality.

617
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:58,127
A sense also of obligation,
to posterity,

618
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:02,996
to their families, to us, I think,
got people talking.

619
00:34:05,647 --> 00:34:09,767
We wanted to just bear witness
and honour the testimony

620
00:34:09,767 --> 00:34:13,087
of these extraordinarily brave
young men and women.

621
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:17,207
And then just say,
"This is what happened to them."

622
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:20,517
And then let these experiences
wash over you.

623
00:34:22,607 --> 00:34:25,767
I hope that viewers
who watch this film

624
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:29,367
will gain an understanding
of what war really is.

00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:33,155
As much as it's possible for anyone
who hasn't been in war to know that.

00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:38,407
There's not any family in America

627
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:40,247
that wasn't touched by the war
in some way,

628
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:41,726
if they dig deep enough.

629
00:34:46,087 --> 00:34:47,567
Everybody did something
for the war -

630
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,607
little kids, old people,
young people -

631
00:34:49,607 --> 00:34:51,487
everybody was involved in some way.

632
00:34:51,487 --> 00:34:54,887
And so there was a sense of unity,
of purpose

633
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:58,641
that people remember today
and wonder why don't we have that.

634

KATHARINE PHILLIPS: We were
all touched by World War II.

635

Whole families were touched by
World War II.

636
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:10,367
And that, in my opinion,

637
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:14,326
is the reason we're still
so fascinated by it.

638
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:19,727
QUENTIN AANENSON: World War II
was a time unique

639
00:35:19,727 --> 00:35:22,241
in American history.

640
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:26,767
There has never been a time
when this country

641
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:30,887
was as totally united as we were

642
00:35:30,887 --> 00:35:34,766
back during those
critical four years.

643
00:35:36,087 --> 00:35:39,167
KEN BURNS: We were animated
with no political agenda.

644
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:44,127
We had no sense of wanting to make
the most comprehensive film.

645
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:46,247
What we wanted to do was say,

646
00:35:46,247 --> 00:35:48,687
"How did it happen?
What was it like?"

647
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:50,837
And do the best job we can.

648
00:35:53,647 --> 00:35:56,847
So, I can't imagine
the Second World War

649
00:35:56,847 --> 00:35:59,687
not being something that
we will continually return to

650
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:01,167
and learn new things about,

651
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,967
see from a different perspective
and light,

652
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:06,967
and ask different questions
as our own experiences change.

653
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:13,964
And realise that it will always,
always have so much to teach us.
