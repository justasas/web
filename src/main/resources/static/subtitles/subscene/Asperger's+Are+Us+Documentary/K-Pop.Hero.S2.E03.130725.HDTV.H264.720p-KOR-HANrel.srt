[The Birth of a Super Rookie - Rain]

2
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,090
A noticeable male solo
artist appeared in 2002.

3
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,750
He is Rain.

4
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,340
He gave a strong impression with
his debut song, "Bad Guy."

5
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:07,470
[A song with heavy emphasis on hip-hop with
orchestra mixed in the intense hip-hop rhythm]

6
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:15,010
[The introductory narration of a woman as if she
was crying out and Rain's powerful voice stood out]

7
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:25,440
[He left a strong impression by showing off his
acting and flashy performance in his music video]

8
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,560
He was in the spotlight
as soon as he debuted.

9
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,920
But he didn't reach
that spot overnight.

10
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:04,640
He meets an important person who will
change his life in a chance meeting.

11
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:12,450
And that person is...

12
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,580
JYP!

13
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,010
[JYP gave birth to the noticeable
rookie singer Rain in 2002]

14
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,880
Introduce yourself to JYP.

15
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,310
- Nice to meet you?
- Same here.

16
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,950
- I'm JYP.
- I'm your fan!

17
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,730
His dance is a work of art.

18
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,280
Really? Let's see some art.

19
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:47,560
Rain's 2nd key to success - do not miss
any opportunity even by chance.

20
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:11,130
He showed off his dancing skills
that he had honed to JYP that day.

21
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:28,690
It was simple. I danced after saying,
"Please watch. I am confident."

22
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,100
I said that I'm confident
once more and sang.

23
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,070
I said, "Pick me since I'm confident."
I said only those three things.

24
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:47,540
Before he debuted as Rain, he entered the
gayo world as a member of Fanclub in 1998.

25
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,800
But he experienced a bitter failure.

26
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:01,950
He's back on stage in 2000 as
Park Ji-yoon's backup dancer.

27
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,570
Your backup dancer used
to be global star Rain?

28
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,180
- Yes.
- Really?

29
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,280
[Here he is]

30
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,670
[He was cool even back then]

31
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,160
- Is that correct?
- Yes, you're right.

32
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,320
He's a great dancer and
good at choreography.

33
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,720
Yes, he is.

34
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,480
How do you know?

35
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,830
He was in the 12th grade and always did
that dance behind the school stage.

36
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,830
- Didn't it have such moves?
- Yes, yes. That's right.

37
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,850
He made all those moves.

38
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:56,920
That was after "Coming-of-Age Ceremony."
He taught me the dance when I was busy.

39
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,890
He was afraid of me at the time.

40
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,070
He was?

41
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,720
He felt uncomfortable because I was
known for "Coming-of-Age Ceremony."

42
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,130
It was difficult for him to approach
me because of my looks as well.

43
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:20,810
Each person was paired with the opposite
sex and there was a hugging move.

44
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:27,940
We had to be in perfect step, but
since he was nervous and afraid...

45
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,150
He tried to be as far as possible.
He told me all of that later on.

46
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:49,320
When I was a dancer, my skills weren't good
enough to be a singer. My singing was bad.

47
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,840
So I practiced singing in
tune for 1 1/2 years.

48
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:01,360
He went through intensive training since he
lacked in singing compared to choreography.

49
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,640
Do it again!

50
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,570
He would flick me on the
head if I didn't get it right.

51
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:18,300
It was bumper-to-bumper from
Chungcheong to Seoul.

52
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:27,840
He experienced bitter failure, silently kept
his place, and waited for his day on stage.

53
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,120
He fills the entire stage on his own,
and his thirst for it was quenched.

54
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:50,410
Rain was a hidden gem. Not only did he make
himself known on stage, but also on TV shows.

55
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,160
Aren't you chugging?

56
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,350
When did I say that?

57
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,560
You dance pretty well.

58
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,570
Yeah, I do. I think
I dance well too.

59
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,840
Do you have a girlfriend?

60
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,110
Yeah, I do.

61
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,020
Is she pretty?

62
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:29,530
Pretty ones, ugly ones, and
funny ones... I have a lot.

63
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:36,660
Rain is very popular especially
with older women, right?

64
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,850
They do this to you once in
a while because you're cute.

65
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,200
Not like how I'm doing, but
you must have been upset.

66
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,100
I wasn't upset, but
you do that a lot.

67
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,840
We do a radio show together
where she is the host...

68
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,900
I never touched you directly.

69
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,920
But?

70
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:13,020
She's fun and tries to be friendly saying,
"Your body's great." In a welcoming way...

71
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,500
"You have strong thighs"
or "Your body's great."

72
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:26,060
I think she was trying to lobby
with that skit we just did.

73
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,360
Rain, you're great.

74
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,620
He even makes the MC act like that.
Is it really his devilishness?

75
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,170
- What a chatterbox!
- Your mouth is the problem.

76
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,210
You laughing?

77
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:48,960
This is the root of Jung Ji-hoon's acting.
This is how Rain was in sitcoms.

78
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,850
It's okay. I have another one.

79
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,930
You had another one?

80
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,780
It's because I was annoyed.

81
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,120
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

82
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,560
What a flirt.

83
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,980
I can't believe this!

84
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:34,010
After people got their eyes on him, Rain
transformed in "Instead of Saying Goodbye."

85
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:42,670
It's fresh seeing the big gloves, visor, lively
dance, and his trademark smiling eyes again.

and the visor and hockey gloves were memorable]

by receiving the New Artist award...

89

rookie in the gayo world.

with "Bad Guy."

I first thank JYP, my parents, and
everyone at JYPE. Thank you.

97

All his efforts were for this moment.
Someone dear supported his dreams.

98
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,460
I made two promises with my mom.

99
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:04,510
She told me to always try and take
good care of my little sister.

100
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,000
The first part of my dream came true
and I kept that promise with her.

101
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,110
The other parts need to come
true now for me to show her.

102
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:23,940
She gave me this ring and I believe she's
always with me. So I have this on always.

103
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,730
I made a promise with
my mom in heaven...

104
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,430
That I'll win the grand prize
and dedicate it to her...

105
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:43,570
When he reached the top with the name "Rain,"
the first person he thought of was his mother.

106
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:47,820
She must be looking at
him with satisfaction.

107
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:55,880
I was determined to be a proud son when she
passed away. That goal is right before me.

108
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:06,860
I'm always trying hard to
keep my promise with her.

109

When do you miss her?

110

When I eat something good.

111
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:22,470
I visited her grave with her favorite food
wishing for the movie to be a success.

112

I miss her when I eat something good.

113
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:32,840
Unfortunately, I didn't play my part as
the son, and I regret it as I grow older.

114

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,600
When filming begins, it will be decisive
in helping him make a foray into the US.

163
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:58,340
I'm burdened since this is the beginning,
but I'm happy because it's a good start.

164
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,250
We cheer Rain whose reach
is extending to the world.

165
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,580
With Yuna Kim...

166
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:08,250
He is chosen again for
the 2011 TIME 100.

167
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,250
He's among the 100.

168
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:18,340
[Yuna Kim is 3rd and Rain is 4th!]

169
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,240
Some of those candidates are US President
Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and Beyonce.

170
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,180
And there are 2 Koreans
among the Top 5.

171
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,590
This is the first time ever.

172
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:37,040
You attend the awards ceremony
and a party afterwards, right?

173
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,280
There was Jennifer Lopez
at the table I was sitting...

174
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:48,220
- America's top female artist?
- And next to me was Puff Daddy.

175
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:55,130
If you go to such an event, everyone is
busy trying to get each other's number.

176
00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:01,300
Because everyone's thinking, "Who is that
person to make it into the list of 100?"

177
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:07,980
If you and Yuna Kim gets in, it's the first
time that two from Korea were picked.

178
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:16,350
She has a high chance of getting picked, but
my chances are slim since I went in 2006.

179
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,000
But you're also influential.

180
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,510
Please send her a message that you'll
be on the red carpet together.

181
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:31,870
We have two good-looking people from Korea
among the most influential people in the world.

182
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:38,320
Even if I don't make it, you have
to and I believe you deserve it.

183
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,350
Please make it in and bring
honor to Korea. Thank you.

184
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,100
[Korea produced these global stars!]

185
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:55,310
Rain was the first Korean ever to
make it in the 2006 TIME 100.

186
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:59,610
He set a record for being nominated
as a candidate for 6 years after 2006.

187
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,480
This was the longest record
set by an Asian star.

188
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:10,110
There was a special press conference at 2 PM.
Many reporters across the nation gathered...

189
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:17,120
With such dignity, he held an exclusive concert in
New York in 2006. The first ever by a Korean artist.

190
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,020
He announced his World Tour and
the release of his 4th album.

191
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:30,860
The album title was "Rain's World." It's a
notice that the world will be soaked in rain.

192
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:36,290
Since I made a comeback after 2 years,
I have prepared many things.

193
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,350
He will begin his World Tour starting with
Korea this Friday until the first half of next year.

194
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,360
It will be held 35 times in 12 countries such
as the US, Japan, China, and so forth.

195
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,400
With an international staff, he will put on
the best show similar to US pop stars.

196
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:56,840
After I gain some experience and
a few more performances in Asia...

197
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,780
I decided on the Asia Tour since I want
to make a foray into the US next year.

198
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:11,520
You need to learn the language since it's
a world tour and I heard you studied.

199
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:21,930
[He makes an introduction in English]

200
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:25,440
That's how much I studied.

201
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:32,220
He spoke English fluently during
his US concert last February.

202
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:48,180
[He spoke English fluently in a certain
interview after his concert ended]

203
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:55,840
I don't know how high I'm going to set
my goals, but I'll gladly accept failures...

204
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:02,190
And I'll continue to challenge myself
when I succeed. Please take interest.

205
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,920
He who enticed the world made himself
known again with another song.

206
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:13,020
The title track "I'm Coming" showed
the return of an upgraded Rain.

207
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:14,090
["I'm Coming" is the title track of
Rain's 4th album "Rain's World"]

208
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,720
[The repeating electronic sounds and hip-hop
rhythm harmonizes with his upgraded voice]

209
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,290
[Epik High's Tablo makes Rain's stage even
more powerful and makes us look forward to it]

210
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:32,420
[This song combines hip-hop rhythm
with repeating electronic sounds]

211
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:37,720
[It sounds more hip-hop due to the
rapping by Epik High's Tablo]

212
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:44,580
[Richy and AJ, choreographers to Usher and
Madonna, presented this performance to Rain]

213
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:51,180
[Rain presented a powerful stage with a song
that contains his will for the stage and future]

214
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,460
[I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK - 2006]

215
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:14,090
He debuted on the silver screen
as actor Jung Ji-hoon in 2006.

216
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:18,440
"I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK" was
directed by Park Chan-wook.

217
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,460
Let's see his skills in stealing
another person's abilities.

218
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,420
"Sorry for being slow."

219
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:31,080
This considerate patient
was caught by Il-soon.

220
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,540
"Transfer."

221
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,040
Does that really transfer abilities?

222
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,610
"Hello everyone."

223
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,750
It worked.

224
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,130
"Did you have lunch? Hello."

225
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,380
Il-soon became affable after
stealing that man's abilities.

226
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,500
"I'm sorry."

227
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,230
- What should I do?
- I'm tired.

228
00:37:53,360 --> 00:38:01,790
Hard worker Rain met a great master and was
recognized for his acting winning Best New Actor.

229
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:11,090
The Best New Actor for the 43rd
Baeksang Arts Awards goes to...

230
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,940
Jung Ji-hoon.

231
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,170
Congratulations.

232
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:23,130
He was Il-soon, a man who thought he could steal
other's abilities, in "I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK."

233
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:28,180
Unlike his charisma as an artist,
he acted well without hesitation.

234
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,730
He was evaluated as expanding his
spectrum as an actor. Congratulations.

235
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,600
Now his acceptance speech.

236
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:51,670
Thank you. I'm nervous right now.

237
00:38:51,670 --> 00:39:01,230
First, there are people that helped me
in more ways than one in this film.

238
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:06,110
I see I don't need to bend.

239
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:21,730
I thank President Hong, Mr. Jung, JYP,
Mr. Cho, Chul-hoon, and Jun-ho.

240
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:30,550
It was my dream to star in a movie.
I thank director Park Chan-wook...

241
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:35,140
He dreams of another amazing
thing as actor Jung Ji-hoon.

242
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,180
Thank you.

243
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:52,090
[Rain's Keyword : Hollywood]

244
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,910
[Hollywood]

245
00:39:54,910 --> 00:40:02,780
[Active in movie production and many
directors and actors dream of it]

246
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,340
Directed by The Wachowskis,
the main character is Speed.

247
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,130
But we're interested in the meeting
between The Wachowskis and Rain.

248
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:18,220
I think I got their trust
after they saw my acting.

249
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:22,630
I also took them out for meals
and did a lot of lobbying.

250
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:29,620
"Speed Racer" was directed
by The Wachowskis in 2008.

251
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:37,280
Rain created a new history by making his foray
into Hollywood by playing the supporting role.

252
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:46,090
I want to boast about myself here.
I was the main supporting actor.

253
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,710
I appeared for an hour
in the two hour film.

254
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:53,220
The Wachowskis casted Rain to
"Speed Racer" and "Ninja Assassin."

255
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:57,460
They took interest in him after
watching his performance.

256
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,660
After they watched Rain in
"I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK"...

257
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:07,020
They were fascinated with him to
the point of being carried away.

258
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,900
Why do I have to
go to Hollywood?

259
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,610
It looks like he was lucky and
moved up in the world, but...

260
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:17,120
He had to hold back the pain he
went through in harsh Hollywood.

261

[Rain - the world's most famous Korean man
makes it to Hollywood as Asia's top star!]

00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:29,660
[As a supporting actor in the film,
it was a box office hit worldwide]

263
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:37,780
[Behind the splendor of success,
no one knew of his pain and tears]

264

[Rain exposes the truth
about Hollywood!]

265
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,590
[He's cool]

266
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:51,140
When I first went to the US
to film "Ninja Assassin"...

267
00:41:51,140 --> 00:42:00,430
I had this big dream, "A great director will finally
build me up. I'm going to be like Brad Pitt."

268
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:08,760
I was very weak and was always beaten up
by the neighborhood kids when I was young.

269
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,080
I waged a war against myself and
wanted to overcome my weakness.

270
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:22,600
My greatest battle was against loneliness
and depression, and the diet of death.

271
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,250
- That was severe.
- 0% body fat.

272
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:32,090
I found out the truth about
Hollywood that it's cold.

273
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,660
It's cold?

274
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:39,170
They first see if the person
can make them money or not.

275
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:41,560
- "Will he/she make money?"
- Is that it?

276
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,340
They first discuss about that.

277
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:49,240
If not then they ruthlessly
look at the next candidate.

278
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:57,340
When I went to the audition, there were
many other Asian actors under my picture.

279
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:03,980
If I was not the one, they would rip
out my picture like a calendar page.

280
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:11,760
This is a secret, but even though I
signed the contract, I can't cancel it.

281
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,490
But they can cancel it even
in the middle of production.

282
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:22,050
It's the same for everyone
and not only me.

283
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:29,250
Gossip can destroy an actor's career.

284
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,140
Can you give us an example?

285
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,570
In my case, when we were filming
for "Speed Racer" in the past...

286
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:42,590
Usually, after 30 minutes of filming
inside the car, you take a break.

287
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:46,120
There's a doctor on the set because your
back and other areas can get injured.

288
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,130
But I filmed for 4 hours.

289
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,740
You didn't take a break?

290
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,870
"Want to rest?" "It's fine.
This isn't that hard."

291
00:43:54,870 --> 00:44:00,500
Everyone heard about me. The faster the
filming ends, the more money you save.

292
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:08,290
When a new actor is on a high horse
because things are going great...

293
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:12,290
Then rumors go around to
not cast that actor.

294
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:16,700
That person is cast away.
Everyone is an expendable.

295
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:21,000
After 8 long months, filming for
"Ninja Assassin" finally began.

296
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,310
This allowed me to take
another leap in life.

297
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,070
His efforts weren't a waste.

298
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:36,190
Only one lead actor was produced by
Hollywood in "Ninja Assassin" in 2009.

299
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,650
A new face in Hollywood had to
fight a fierce and lonely battle.

300
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,230
It was hard to get that sculpted body.

301
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,040
He was praised for his all-out effort.

302
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:59,550
His fearless passion and masculine charm
exploded on screen in "Ninja Assassin."

303
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:00,800
But...

304
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,130
Why fight? I might die even though I might
be a good fighter. I'd rather run away.

305
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:13,610
We heard everything about "Ninja Assassin"
through our special meeting with him.

306
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,280
This was a fated battle that
Raizo couldn't avoid.

307
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:26,520
He survived countless life-or-death crises
for his final confrontation with Ozunu.

308
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:32,970
The main character who fought this brutal
and lonely battle is actor Jung Ji-hoon.

309
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:45,240
Forget pop star Rain and Jung Ji-hoon.
You are a fighter now and a killer!

310
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,350
With the training team that created
the sculpted warriors of "300"...

311
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,440
He started on his goal
to reach 0% body fat.

312
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:10,030
Just one picture confirmed his hard work.
This is what 0% body fat looks like.

313
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:26,750
Rain evolved both on the stage and
screen and continues to do so.

314
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:33,760
I used to have 0% body fat.

315
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,760
- Wait a minute...
- 0% body fat?

316
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,970
- Body fat...
- 0% body fat.

317
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,220
Kang Ho-dong, you're out.

318
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:51,140
After training was over,
my body fat was 0.x %

319
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,280
That must be bad for your health.

320
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,000
I felt like a human weapon.

321
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,190
Why did you do that?

322
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:04,620
There's just one scene in the movie
where I don't even wear underwear.

323
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,820
You're stark-naked?

324
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:14,290
I'm doing a handstand
but not like this.

325
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,790
I have to go up on my own
from a sitting position.

326
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:21,250
I trained for 8 months
just for that one scene.

327
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,710
- Just for one scene?
- Yes, just one scene.

328
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:29,690
I lift my legs and do this.

329
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,940
- And you go up?
- That's right.

330
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,560
- Wait, let's see it.
- How is that attractive?

331
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,480
[8 months for this!]

332
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,460
[0% body fat]

333
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:50,660
I can't eat any salt or sugar.

334
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:58,050
I taste a grain of salt once a month.

335
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:03,040
You know when vampires are
dripping blood in movies?

336
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,140
- You desired it.
- I get passionate.

337
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,230
- Just from eating it?
- Yes, just from that.

338
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:15,580
The saltiness reaches my brain
and I'm just feeling it.

339
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,210
How detailed is the contract?

340
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,490
For example, I can only get a
manicure from a certain place...

341
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:28,580
I eat steak once a week that has
a certain percentage of fat.

342
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,950
This is an eight pack.

343
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,700
Such a body does exist.

344
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:39,910
As he ate salt in tears to complete
this film, it gave him another gift.

345
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:47,560
I have another good news.
There's an MTV Movie Awards.

346
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:52,650
I've been nominated for an award.

347
00:48:52,650 --> 00:49:00,770
If I'm lucky, I want to be there and
say that I'm Rain from Korea.

348
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,220
That dream came true.

349
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:17,290
He wins the Biggest Badass Star
at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards.

350
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,900
You must have mastered English.

351
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:05,440
I tried very hard and
took it head on.

352
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,830
I worried that they might despise
me for not speaking English.

353
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:16,270
I thought that I should just do it
since I'm starting it right now.

354
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:20,830
Does it matter that I don't speak
English well? I'm Korean after all.

355
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:29,210
I told Matthew Fox, "You speak English and
I speak Korean. Our level is similar."

356
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:32,870
"But I'm a cut above since I know
more English than you know Korean."

357
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:41,320
In the racing scene, only the handle
is real and everything else is CG.

358
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,350
I have to pretend to jump
when I'm told to jump.

359
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:51,750
You take off your suit and rest after 30-40
minutes because your back really hurts.

360
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:59,980
But I wanted to look good. They told me
to rest, but I smiled, "One more time."

361
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:07,490
Even though I feel like I'm going to die.
I'm wet with sweat and I have rashes.

362
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:12,480
I sat down for 5-6 hours straight.

363
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,640
What did the director say?

364
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,660
- "You're tenacious."
- Tenacious?

365
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,620
"I know Koreans are patient..."

366
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:26,410
He was born again as a Hollywood star.
But he's dreaming of bigger things.

367
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,640
[Only Rain]

368
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:51,590
Together with his 5th album, Rain made
a comeback in 2008 after 2 years.

369
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:56,500
It was his first album after
setting up his own company.

370
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:11,450
He worked on every aspect of the album, and
showed an upgraded image with "Rainism."

371
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:44,630
[The title track "Rainism" is a synthpop
with strong beats based on hip-hop]

372
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:51,520
["Rainism" is a coined term adding
the suffix -ism to his name, Rain]

373
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,500
[It's the title track of his first album
after setting up his own company]

374
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,660
[He wrote the lyrics, composed, and
produced for the first time in 7 years]

375
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:05,130
[He wore a suit and used a
cane in his performance]

376
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:09,080
[It emphasized his refined and natural
masculinity, and restrained sexiness]

377
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,740
I didn't know a neat suit
could look this sexy.

378
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:22,740
Even a performance with a cane.
A stage that only he can do goes on.

379
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:40,360
8 years after his debut, he releases a
new album in 2008 to return to the basics.

380
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:45,370
He stirred up talk with his
shocking album cover and teaser.

381
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:49,830
The title track "Love Song" met
everyone's expectations.

382
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:11,120
[This song harmonizes strings
with acoustic instruments]

383
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,540
[The sad melody on top of the
piano melody was memorable]

384
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:18,240
[The lyrics are about wanting to
hold on to his lover who left]

385
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,890
[This is his first ballad where
his mournful voice stood out]

386
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:27,000
[The shocking album cover and the teaser
of the kissing scene with Han Ye-seul...]

387
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,770
[Garnered attention before its release]

388
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:33,900
This was an exceptional performance.
The moves gave birth to many parodies.

389
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:37,880
I'll do Rain's "Love Song."

390
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,820
[Even today]

391
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:46,310
[Mud flat abs]

392
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:47,600
[That's cute]

393
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,900
[The one that can hold on
to you is Prince Jumong]

394
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:57,500
[G.O is on stage with Rain
for the first time!]

395
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,960
[Teacher and student]

396
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:17,390
Starting with the stage of his
students surpassing the teacher...

397
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:23,940
A special performance by Puffy Rain
showing off his belly and not abs.

398
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:28,870
[Puffy Rain vs Rain]

399
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,850
[Perfect reenactment]

400
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:35,420
[Charisma with weight]

401
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:40,820
[Puffy Rain is feeling it]

402
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:46,480
[OMG!]

403
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:52,620
[Wow]

404
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,600
[A sausage?]

405
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,530
[Puffy Rain needs a sausage
and not a magic stick!]

406
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:07,040
[Now to the climax]

407
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,340
[Rain's Rainism]

408
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,750
[Puffy Rain's Sausagism!]

409
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,310
[A bite for me and you!]

410
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,380
[Puffy Rain will keep
you on your seats]

411
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,220
[Takes on the abs dance!]

412
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,530
[Will he?]

413
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,500
[Is he?]

414
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,420
[OMG!]

415
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,260
[Obese compared to Rain]

416
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,670
[What about your belly?]

417
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,360
[Please...]

418
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:01,180
[Teuk Academy brings laughter]

419
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,230
[Standing ovation]

420
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,880
[Going wild]

421
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:19,130
Intense music and performance by Rain
continues in "Hip Song" as well.

422
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:19,920
[It's a song with intense beats
and a repeating synth rhythm]

423
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,100
[He presents another powerful performance
with a dance track mixing various genres]

424
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:57,760
Rain's performances reminds you
of his flashy choreography.

425
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:03,400
Out of all these choreographies,
which did he choose as the best?

426
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:08,990
Let's choose the best
three of your dances.

427
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:15,170
3rd is "How to Avoid the Sun."

428
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:25,110
Since this is the guitar melody,
I feel sleepy if I don't sing.

429
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:29,950
When I heard that's the title track,
I didn't know what to do with it.

430
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:35,700
I thought of finishing it off by singing
very well and with my appearances.

431
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:42,540
My moves were restrained as if I was going
to show something, and I ripped my clothes.

432
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:44,320
2nd is...

433
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,410
I once did a pop dance.

434
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:49,800
It's not from my album
but on a variety show.

435
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,260
- That choreography?
- Yes, it was 30 seconds.

436
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:57,180
The 30 seconds that introduced
dancing machine Rain to the world.

437
01:05:57,180 --> 01:06:05,980
I made up that dance to go on the show.
I made it really intense but short.

438
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:12,020
It was called the three step dance
since it's divided into three beats.

439
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:16,570
That's when the opening of every
show started with a dance.

440
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:18,050
- It was.
- I know.

441
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,970
It was the most memorable.

442
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,120
And 1st is...

443
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:31,170
Rainism.

444
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:38,900
[He did everything on his own since 2007
and did everything alone on "Rainism"]

445
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:43,850
You know this dance?
I made it while goofing off.

446
01:06:43,850 --> 01:06:50,120
I just put a wave in the clap
giving it some feel.

447
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,490
Just did it?

448
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:55,510
I made a fist to look wild and tough,
but I can't do this, right?

449
01:06:55,510 --> 01:07:03,740
This is worthy to be one of the best.
But he didn't shine only in dances.

450
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:07,690
I remember Rainism and
its moves the most.

451
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:20,910
Another charming thing about his
voice is when he sings ballads.

452
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:23,940
Let's rank his ballads.

453
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:42,590
[Ranking - ballads that hold on to you]

454
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:47,350
Ballads that hold on
to you by Rain.

455
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,900
The sad lyrics stood out
in "Familiar Face."

456
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:56,460
"Only You" contains the musical
colors that he wanted to show.

457
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:34,470
"In My Bed" was memorable in that
it was like a scene from a musical.

458
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:52,270
[It's an R&B song with descriptive lyrics
portraying the sadness towards one's lover]

459
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:57,220
[The key here is his matured
voice and honest lyrics]

460
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:16,500
The twist to "Bad Guy" is "Handshake"
where his mournful voice stands out.

461
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:22,230
Rain can't forget that day. "Sep. 12th"
and "Love Story" are his No. 1 ballads.

462
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:09,790
[The Rain Story Continues]

463
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:21,140
Rain gives his fans a special gift in his
last concert before serving his country.

464
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:27,540
It's a unique single titled "Busan Woman"
named after the place he held his first concert.

465
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:35,220
["Busan Woman"]

466
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:47,010
[Rain's final nationwide tour
before going to the army]

467
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:49,830
[He released this single along
with "The Best Show"]

468
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:55,840
[This was titled after Busan, the first place
he held his concert in his nationwide tour]

469
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:02,020
[The title changed according to the city
and was only done during this concert]

470
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,090
With top actresses...

471
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:20,990
It doesn't have to be a Busan woman.
He's known for being blessed with women.

472
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:24,370
The top actresses that worked
with actor Jung Ji-hoon!

473
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:27,390
I remember Min-ah the most.

474
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:29,730
- Shin Min-ah?
- Yes.

475
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:33,350
We did many retakes because
it was very intense.

476
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:35,720
They were stopping you,
but you kept on going?

477
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,820
[How intense was it?]

478
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:40,650
It was really cold.

479
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:44,780
I didn't feel ashamed
because it was really cold.

480
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:48,680
I wanted to finish it quickly without
a retake and I think she did too.

481
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:56,050
They went, "Ready. Action!" I drove her
to a corner and made it really serious.

482
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:57,250
So...

483
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:59,360
The staff tried to separate you?

484
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:04,050
The one editing it told me, "You know
you made a lot of smooching sounds."

485
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:07,110
[OMG]

486
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:11,140
The sound was...

487
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:14,820
Should we do the ideal
woman World Cup?

488
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,580
[Starting at the quarterfinals!]

489
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:18,780
Whoever comes to mind, okay?

490
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:20,990
Song Hye-kyo or Han Ye-seul?

491
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:24,150
It can't be longer than
3 seconds. One, two...

492
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:27,460
But if you're silent, that
means you hate them both.

493
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:29,990
Song Hye-kyo or Han Ye-seul.
One, two, three!

494
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:32,680
Song Hye-kyo.

495
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,860
Wasn't Han Ye-seul in
your music video?

496
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:39,940
But you picked Song Hye-kyo. You
knew after you filmed with her?

497
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:41,070
[OMG!]

498
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:47,760
Shin Min-ah or Im Soo-jung?

499
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,380
- One, two, three!
- Im Soo-jung.

500
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:55,130
- You never worked with Shin...
- Yes, he did. In dramas.

501
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,060
He knows because he already did.

502
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:01,010
He got to know them, huh?

503
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:04,040
He did a music video
with Han Ye-seul.

504
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:11,670
He also filmed in dramas but
knows because he did it. Is it?

505
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:13,690
No, I...

506
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:18,120
Jeong Ga-eun or Park Kahi?

507
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,490
They're right here.

508
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:26,170
After School's leader Park Kahi
is 1980 and Jeong Ga-eun is 1978.

509
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:28,310
[A battle between noonas!]

510
01:19:29,770 --> 01:19:34,390
Jeong or Park?
One, two, three!

511
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:36,290
Park Kahi.

512
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:40,240
Because she's a year younger?

513
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,800
Jung Joo-ri or Kim Hyo-jin?

514
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,970
This is going to be tough.

515
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:49,120
I don't want to lose.

516
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,400
[Me neither]

517
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,380
[He's troubled]

518
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:56,680
Kim Hyo-jin.

519
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,140
[She's touched]

520
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:00,120
Now the semifinals.

521
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:03,200
Song Hye-kyo or Im Soo-jung?

522
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,900
Im Soo-jung.

523
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:09,720
It's still the semifinals.
Park Kahi or Kim Hyo-jin?

524
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:13,620
Let's say that she's not married.

525
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,700
Park Kahi.

526
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,820
- You won't part yet.
- There was no tension.

527
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:28,720
Im Soo-jung or Park Kahi?
One, two, three!

528
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,770
Im Soo-jung.

529
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:38,570
Why is she your ideal woman?

530
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:40,990
How am I different from her?

531
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:45,870
- I'm dumbfounded.
- Yeah, you're twins.

532
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:50,340
You two look so alike.

533
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:54,740
Yeah, you look alike.
Thought you didn't know.

534
01:20:54,740 --> 01:21:00,340
She's very considerate
and humorous.

535
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:06,870
She spreads this happy virus.
I had fun while working with her.

536
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:10,210
You know there are many
celebrities on our show.

537
01:21:10,210 --> 01:21:11,470
Yes.

538
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:14,350
Uee said her ideal man is Rain.

539
01:21:14,350 --> 01:21:16,090
Really?

540
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:18,050
Hold on.

541
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:20,220
[I'm nervous]

542
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:24,640
[He's now a matchmaker!]

543
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,060
Give it to me if
you're not doing it.

544
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,310
Hurry!

545
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:32,530
Hello?

546
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:37,150
- Hello.
- I'm Uee...

547
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:41,110
Glad to meet you. I'm
watching your group.

548
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:44,030
- What is he watching?
- Thank you.

549
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:49,140
Everyone's pretty and
your songs are great.

550
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:52,330
Do you know our songs?

551
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:56,280
I know "Diva."

552
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:00,820
I debuted with that song.

553
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:08,120
Congratulations for doing well and
I'll continue to listen to your songs.

554
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:11,700
Could you sing our...

555
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,150
I'm your fan.

556
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:25,740
He made Uee nervous with a phone call.
We acknowledge his blessing of women.

557
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:30,440
What's his charm for
captivating women?

558
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,160
[Global star's footwork]

559
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:37,320
His very existence emits an
aura that fills the entire stage.

560
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,050
[Brilliant]

561
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:48,440
His hidden talents as an entertainer
and human side are also his charms.

562
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,650
I can't do the recording.

563
01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:52,440
Why can't you?

564
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:56,790
He has 3 stages of anger.
First stage is...

565
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:58,820
Don't look.

566
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:03,180
- Pretend he's not there.
- Wait! Hold on here.

567
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:05,580
Listen to my side later.

568
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:13,880
He has a characteristic. First,
he gives advice through allusion.

569
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:21,550
"You don't want to practice. You feel sleepy?
Do you know why the Red Hare runs straight?"

570
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:25,050
"It has blinders on!"

571
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:29,550
He gives advice through allusion.

572
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:39,870
Second, he loses his temper
and stamps his feet in rhythm.

573
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:44,800
"Why aren't you practicing?
Sleep only when you're dead!"

574
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,520
One famous saying after another.

575
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:55,620
Third, he's like, "Don't greet me."

576
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:58,240
- He gets cold.
- "Just leave."

577
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,550
That's it.

578
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:05,430
- He must have been really angry.
- But that happened recently.

579
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:10,140
- I can't really talk about it.
- You already said it all.

580
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,760
Are you afraid since you said it?
It's okay with you, Rain, right?

581
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:16,350
- It's okay.
- What he said.

582
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:19,410
But there's no 2nd album.

583
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:24,820
As you just saw, Ji-hoon isn't cool.

584
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,940
Rain's final concert before going to
the army was held on September 25th.

585
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,280
It's been a while. I'm Rain.

586
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:37,330
Rain left temporarily for
military duty in 2011.

587
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:42,460
He gave a special gift to his
fans by holding a unique concert.

588
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:46,650
I'm filled with emotion and only those
that didn't attend will feel slighted.

589
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:51,290
We won't leave you.

590
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:53,870
We love you Rain!

591
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:01,990
He sure is a global star with many
fans from around the world.

592
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:04,400
They won't leave him, right?

593
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:10,000
It's okay if you cheat on me
because I'm a cool guy.

594
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,510
But return in two years.

595
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:16,870
Even though you leave, return
in two years and all is well.

596
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:21,310
There was commotion right
before the concert started.

597
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:27,370
- It's because of the stars.
- Wow! It's MBLAQ.

598
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:32,980
The concert begins with
Rain's flashy entrance.

599
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:37,200
[Fans waited for this!]

600
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:41,130
[This is Rain God!]

601
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:47,960
He overwhelms the stage
with his entrance.

602
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:52,020
He sure made the fans go wild.

603
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:00,880
- Doing well?
- Yes.

604
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,630
- You want this?
- Throw it here!

605
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:11,290
He first thanked his fans. A buzz
cut on him seems a bit awkward.

606
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:17,900
Hello everyone.

607
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,270
Thank you for coming.

608
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:30,410
I feel sorry for causing all
this noise before leaving.

609
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,640
I'll be back soon. Thank you.

610
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:44,030
He showed his buzz cut to his fans
as a sign of gratitude for coming.

611
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:48,660
He's been on stage for 10 years,
but this must have been awkward.

612
01:26:48,660 --> 01:26:52,480
It wasn't easy for him to speak
and ended it with a salute.

613
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:08,720
Thank you for coming and for
your love the past 10 years.

614
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:10,910
I'll be back.

615
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:19,820
Did he get emotional? He was teary-eyed and
didn't speak anymore. It made his fans sad.

616
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:32,460
His longtime friend Bbaek Ga finally showed
tears as well as the fans. It was a sea of tears.

617
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:42,400
Cheer up. I love you.

618
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:44,630
I'll wait for you.

619
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:47,850
Rain left amidst heartwarming
farewells from his fans.

620
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:55,000
The story of this man who promised to
return continues and will come soon.

621
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,600
People say if there's anything
else that you can do.

622
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,880
- There's so many things?
- What do you want to do?

623
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:07,240
I want to act in China and Japan
in their respective languages.

624
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:16,600
I want to be the supreme in the US
and go to the Grammy and The Oscars.
