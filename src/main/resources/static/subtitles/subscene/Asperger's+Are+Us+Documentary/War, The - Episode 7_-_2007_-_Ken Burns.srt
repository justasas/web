00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:15,847
        (wind whistling)        

2
00:00:24,056 --> 00:00:27,192
       (machine gun fire)       

3
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,495
  (machine gun fire continues)  

4
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:46,444
         (men shouting)         

5
00:00:56,655 --> 00:00:59,491
           (shouting)           

6
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,641
        (wind whistling)        

7
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:23,180
          RAY LEOPOLD:          
 In the process of this battle, 

8
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:30,588
     we took about 18 or 19     
        German prisoners.       

9
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:36,294
  A young man approximately 24  
   years of age turned to me,   

10
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:45,836
    and in a voice completely   
      accent-free, he said,     

11
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:49,541
      "Where are you from?"     

12
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:52,810
             I said,            
  "I'm from the United States." 

13
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,580
  "Where in the United States?" 

14
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,648
    "The Northeast," I said.    

15
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,650
       "Where Northeast?"       

16
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:02,453
 I said, "I'm from Connecticut."

17
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,688
     "Where in Connecticut?"    

18
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,723
       He was persisting.       

19
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:10,896
     I said, "Yes, I'm from     
    Waterbury, Connecticut."    

20
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,698
 "Ah, yes," he said, "Waterbury,

21
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,704
at the junction of the Naugatuck
        and Mad Rivers."        

22
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,740
      Now, you have to know     
      a bit about the area.     

23
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,676
          The Naugatuck         
 is a fairly substantial river, 

24
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,546
        but the Mad River       
       is a little stream       

25
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,516
    that you can jump across    
      without any trouble.      

26
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:37,054
     Anyone who knew this...    
         I was puzzled.         

27
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:39,724
  I said, "How did you possibly 
           know that?"          

28
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:47,632
   He said, "I was in training  
    for the administration."    

29
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,735
  "The administration of what?" 
             I said.            

30
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:55,873
  He said, "The administration  
      of the territories."      

31
00:02:55,875 --> 00:03:00,211
       My blood ran cold.       

32
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:04,382
I couldn't imagine that Hitler--

33
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,052
  in his wildest imagination--  

34
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,753
      not only had figured      

35
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:13,358
    he practically had Europe   
          in his grasp,         

36
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,064
   but he also figured that he  
   would control America, too.  

37
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:32,743
        (wind whistling)        

38
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:36,414
 (distant artillery explosions) 

39
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:47,558
          PAUL FUSSELL:         
 You had no possessions at all. 

40
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,362
  You would cut everything down 
        to the simplest,        

41
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,265
         'cause you had         
      to carry everything.      

42
00:03:55,367 --> 00:04:01,205
      When we were marching     
   from one horror to another,  

43
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:06,377
 I had shoepacks on because the 
ground was always wet or frozen.

44
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,646
I had two pairs of woolen socks.

45
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:12,917
In my pockets I carried probably
       a couple of, uh...       

46
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,254
       boxes of K-rations.      

47
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,489
           I never had          
      a toothbrush at all.      

48
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:21,292
     I didn't take a shower     
         for six months.        

49
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:25,129
 No change of underwear at all. 

50
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,700
      No change of clothes      
       at all for months.       

51
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:32,470
    And I had a sleeping bag    
   which I carried with a rope  

52
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:36,541
 over my shoulder like a tramp. 

53
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:41,312
   And, uh, that's all I had.   

54
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:48,986
            NARRATOR:           
 More than 16 million Americans 
   served in the armed forces   

55
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:54,124
    The vast majority of them   
    never saw serious combat.   

56
00:04:54,126 --> 00:05:01,032
    The infantry represented    
just 14% of the troops overseas.

57
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,504
   But wherever they fought--   

58
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,841
         in North Africa        
      or the South Pacific      

59
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:11,075
       or Western Europe--      

60
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:15,379
   the infantry bore the brunt  
  of the fighting on the ground 

61
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:20,018
       and suffered seven       
     out of ten casualties.     

62
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,455
   And they endured hardships   
           and horrors          

63
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:28,425
      for which no training     
 could ever have prepared them. 

64
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:35,566
         BURNETT MILLER:        
        You know, you get       
         hardened to it.        

65
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,369
 I stayed in a hole for an hour 
           and a half           

66
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,572
    or something like that--    
  it seemed like that anyway--  

67
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,307
       with a dead German.      

68
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,510
          And it's kind         
      of an eerie feeling.      

69
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:49,280
   Uh, but you're so worried,   

70
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:53,051
     really, about yourself     
          at that time          

71
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,953
      that you didn't think     
       too much about it.       

72
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:59,991
   But you get really hardened  
            to seeing           

73
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:03,160
    a lot of gruesome sights.   

74
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,531
      And that worries you      
      as much as anything.      

75
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,065
      You think, "My gosh.      

76
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,434
        "I saw so-and-so        
        get killed today        

77
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:13,204
  "and then he got run over by  
 a tank and just a horrible mess

78
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,875
and it didn't bother me at all."

79
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,611
     But about a week after     
         the war ended,         

80
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,911
  I saw an automobile accident  

81
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:27,018
  and I got sick as I normally  
      would before the war.     

82
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,956
            NARRATOR:           
 By December of 1944, Americans 
  were growing weary of the war 

83
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:36,094
    their young men had been    
 fighting for three long years. 

84
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:41,232
   In Europe, it was supposed   
       to be over by now.       

85
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:45,136
  The generals who had directed 
          the fighting          

86
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,471
    from far behind the lines   

87
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:50,341
   had been predicting victory  
           for months.          

88
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,210
      It had not happened.      

89
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,079
         In the Pacific,        

90
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,916
 American progress had been slow
           and costly.          

91
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,653
    The enemy showed no sign    
          of giving up.         

92
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,757
  And on a tiny volcanic island 
        called Iwo Jima,        

93
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,828
  the Marines would face still  
     another terrible test.     

94
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,632
   For the people of Luverne,   
           Minnesota,           

95
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,768
   and Waterbury, Connecticut,  

96
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,304
     Sacramento, California,    
      and Mobile, Alabama,      

97
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,507
 and every other town struggling
        to absorb it all,       

98
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,678
     the stream of telegrams    
     and newspaper headlines    

99
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,614
      telling of new losses     

100
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:34,385
 seemed endless and unendurable.

101
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:44,962
     For their sons overseas    
  it was, of course, far worse. 

102
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:49,033
          (explosions)          

103
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,368
  For them there was no option  

104
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,839
         but to fight on        
     and try to stay alive.     

105
00:07:56,975 --> 00:08:01,512
 Ray Leopold, a mortgage broker 
         from Waterbury,        

106
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,714
      who had been trained      
         to kill people,        

107
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:07,284
    would find himself trying   
      to save them instead.     

108
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,087
 Burnett Miller, the only child 

109
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,289
         of a prosperous        
       Sacramento family,       

110
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,058
       would be caught up       
        in the biggest--        

111
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,128
      and least expected--      
  battle on the Western Front.  

112
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,198
  Quentin Aanenson of Luverne,  

113
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,033
     who had dealt out death    
          from the air,         

114
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:28,406
would now encounter it close up,
         on the ground.         

115
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:32,810
         And 11-year-old        
       Sascha Weinzheimer,      

116
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,913
   a prisoner of the Japanese,  
       whose fondest dream      

117
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,483
 was that her world might simply
        return to normal,       

118
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:43,487
   would have the happiest day  
          of her life.          

119
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:07,545
          TOM GALLOWAY:         
   Basically, getting shot at   
 or shelled is just plain scary.

120
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,481
    You just hope that, uh...   
         it misses you.         

121
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,690
 When the artillery's coming in,
      you think, "Oh, God,      

122
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:24,027
   it's covering such an area   
 and I hope it doesn't hit me." 

123
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:28,866
 We would wish they'd just start
     using rifles, you know?    

124
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:31,369
       Well, when you get       

125
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:35,506
    to where a bullet whizzes   
         by your head...        

126
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,676
   you know that's personal...  
       (laughs) you know?       

127
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:42,546
 You better get out of the way. 

128
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:51,456
            NARRATOR:           
Since the summer of 1944, Hitler
   had been secretly planning   

129
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,790
    a massive counterattack,    

130
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,961
  an all-out attempt to divide  
  and destroy the Allied armies 

131
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,631
 before they could move further 
          into Germany.         

132
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:04,334
       His target would be      
         the Ardennes--         

133
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:07,071
     rolling forested hills     
    in Belgium and Luxembourg   

134
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,907
   through which German troops  
   had advanced toward France   

135
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:16,647
          twice before,         
   in 1914 and again in 1940.   

136
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,884
   It was now thinly defended.  

137
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,953
His armies were to break through
   the unsuspecting Americans,  

138
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,191
    race for Antwerp, cut off   
  the British army in the north 

139
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:31,062
   and drive it into the sea.   

140
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:35,232
   Most of Hitler's commanders  
       thought it madness.      

141
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:39,470
    They had lost nearly four   
million men since the war began.

142
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:45,209
    They had too little fuel    
 for a major mechanized advance.

143
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:50,280
    The once-mighty Luftwaffe   
   had largely been destroyed.  

144
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,749
   But Hitler was implacable.   

145
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:55,853
      "The coming battle,"      
      he said, would decide     

146
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,388
 "whether we shall live or die."

147
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:06,930
  Every able-bodied German male 
  between the ages of 16 and 60 

148
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,168
 was made eligible for service. 

149
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,769
        25 new divisions,       

150
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:15,239
 called "the people's infantry,"
          were formed--         

151
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,042
     250,000 fresh troops--     

152
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:22,747
    convicts and the infirm,    
     old men and young boys,    

153
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,049
         and conscripts         
     from occupied countries    

154
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,718
        who didn't speak        
        a word of German.       

155
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,889
   Preparations for the attack  
         would take time        

156
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,524
   and demanded utter secrecy.  

157
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,094
   Hitler would not launch it   
      until he was certain      

158
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,596
  winter weather and dense fog  

159
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:42,866
   would keep Allied aircraft   
         on the ground.         

160
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:47,438
      Meanwhile, Lieutenant     
     Tom Galloway of Mobile     

161
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,240
   and his division were among  
       the American troops      

162
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,043
  who happened to be stationed  
        in the Ardennes.        

163
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:57,982
            GALLOWAY:           
We were in Luxembourg rebuilding
      after Hürtgen Forest,     

164
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:01,418
       because the losses       
       were kind of heavy.      

165
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,321
   There, like we had a front,  

166
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,258
    the division had a front    
        of some 20 miles.       

167
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,493
          Well, because         
       it was a quiet area      

168
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:14,632
and nothing was going to happen,
    I fired 25 rounds a day.    

169
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:18,970
    I'd go up in the morning    
 and fire just one at the time, 

170
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:23,573
      just to let them know     
         we were there.         

171
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:31,215
        (Duke Ellington's       
       "Solitude" playing)      

172
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:33,718
            NARRATOR:           
      There were only four      
     U.S. infantry divisions    

173
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,822
  in the Ardennes-- 80,000 men, 
   stretched out along a front  

174
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,260
     that ran some 80 miles     
      from north to south.      

175
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,896
      Two of the divisions      
     had seen little combat.    

176
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,600
         The other two--        
the Fourth and Galloway's 28th--

177
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,536
   had been battered by weeks   
      of desperate fighting     

178
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,004
     in the Hürtgen Forest,     

179
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:58,275
        and had been sent       
    to the Ardennes to rest.    

180
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,210
   Ray Leopold, of Waterbury,   

181
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,880
 was serving with the 28th, too.

182
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,082
He had been trained as a sniper.

183
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:10,554
            LEOPOLD:            
       We were in a place       
    called Malmedy-St. Vith,    

184
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:15,426
        at a little place       
      called Sevenig Hill.      

185
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:19,163
     You could put one foot     
 in France, one foot in Belgium,

186
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:22,166
      and spit into Germany     
    at this particular spot.    

187
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:27,538
            NARRATOR:           
    One frosty morning, after   
  several hours of guard duty,  

188
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,108
  Leopold stood up to stretch.  

189
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,745
    A German sniper shot him    
       in the left thigh.       

190
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,946
      (gunshot, soft thud)      

191
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,115
    As chance would have it,    

192
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,784
         I had picked up        
      a German medic's kit      

193
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:45,189
    a couple of days before,    
       lying in the field.      

194
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,224
  And I doctored my own wound,  

195
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:53,130
      because our own medic     
        had been killed.        

196
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:59,870
 And, with the German equipment,
    I probed for the bullet.    

197
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,471
         I extracted it.        

198
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,940
      I cleansed the wound.     

199
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:07,278
      I doctored it myself.     

200
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:14,718
   Two days later, when I got   
    to battalion aid station,   

201
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,254
 the captain looked at the wound

202
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,891
  and said, "This is wonderful. 
          Who did it?"          

203
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,494
     I told him that I had.     

204
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,029
        He then told me,        

205
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:29,533
            "Leopold,           
  I have a proposition for you. 

206
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,037
 I'm going to make you a medic."

207
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,342
         I, thereafter,         
      never carried a gun.      

208
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,445
           (soft thud)          
            MAN:                
           Strike!              

209
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,248
         (men cheering)         

210
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,415
            NARRATOR:           
       For the most part,       

211
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:49,486
 the war seemed a long way away 
       from the Ardennes,       

212
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:53,290
 and the men took full advantage
        of the facilities       

213
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,959
    for rest and recreation.    

214
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,996
    Life there was so quiet,    
         so uneventful,         

215
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:02,866
      that some of the men      
  called it the "ghost front."  

216
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:07,237
        MARLENE DIETRICH:       
     ¶ Outside the barracks,    
      by the corner light ¶     

217
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:12,943
       ¶ I'll always stand      
   and wait for you at night ¶  

218
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:17,180
        ¶ We will create        
        a world for two ¶       

219
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:22,786
       ¶ I'll wait for you      
    the whole night through ¶   

220
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:27,057
    ¶ For you, Lili Marlene ¶   

221
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,461
           ¶ For you,           
         Lili Marlene. ¶        

222
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:37,468
    (accordion and orchestra    
       playing interlude)       

223
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,908
          ¶ It's you ¶          

224
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:51,915
        ¶ Lili Marlene. ¶       

225
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,824
            NARRATOR:           
      But just a few miles      
          to the east,          

226
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,927
    hidden beneath the trees,   

227
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,463
    Hitler's army was making    
     the final preparations     

228
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,433
    for its surprise attack.    

229
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:16,373
      There were signs that     
     something was going on.    

230
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,008
        Civilians slipped       
        through the lines       

231
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,212
    to report growing numbers   
        of German troops.       

232
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,414
         Spotter planes         
      noted hospital trains     

233
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:28,452
     and massive Tiger tanks    
       loaded on flatcars.      

234
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:34,191
       At night, GIs heard      
  the distant rumble of motors. 

235
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:39,530
            GALLOWAY:           
      I did know that roads     
   would not have snow on them  

236
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:43,100
  which meant there was traffic 
    on those roads at night.    

237
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:46,070
     Report it, but I didn't    
   put any significance to it.  

238
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:50,908
            NARRATOR:           
       Allied headquarters      
     paid little attention.     

239
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,611
      General Omar Bradley      
       remained convinced       

240
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,614
         the German army        
        had been wrecked.       

241
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:04,621
       Then, at 5:30 a.m.       
         on December 16,        

242
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:08,192
  thousands of guns opened up.  

243
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:13,330
  The shells fell on and around 
     the American positions     

244
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,899
          for an hour.          

245
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,549
       (clamoring shouts)       

246
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:43,160
      A few moments later,      
    the enemy began to emerge   

247
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:47,530
      out of the dense fog      
    that shrouded the forest.   

248
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:52,436
    (rapid automatic gunfire)   

249
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,304
       (soldiers shouting)      

250
00:17:54,306 --> 00:18:00,444
       And, uh, of course,      
  the Bulge broke right there.  

251
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:06,684
       And, as I say, when      
   they fired the first round,  

252
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,487
      it darn near hit me.      

253
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,091
   From then on, it got worse.  

254
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,125
     (artillery explosions)     

255
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:19,229
      But, uh... they came      
      barreling over there,     

256
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:25,135
 and, uh... just right into us. 

257
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,913
            NARRATOR:           
  20 German infantry divisions  
       were moving forward      

258
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:41,919
     along a 50-mile front--    
   a quarter of a million men.  

259
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:46,156
  Behind them roared 600 tanks. 

260
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:55,132
            LEOPOLD:            
     On the adjoining ridge,    

261
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,935
         which was only         
      a half-mile from us,      

262
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:01,371
  sitting up as bold as brass,  

263
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:06,710
  several German tanks in line, 

264
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:10,547
     with the driver sitting    
      in his black uniform,     

265
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:15,252
     were coming down paths     
 that could not, in our opinion,

266
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,922
   possibly have taken a tank.  

267
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,256
           Footpaths.           

268
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,658
        But there it was.       

269
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,028
       The gigantic tanks,      
     with their 88-mm guns,     

270
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:30,233
   were coming down this path   
         in single file.        

271
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:59,029
            GALLOWAY:           
  You just had waves of Germans 
         coming at you.         

272
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:04,534
     We had one machine gun     
     just mowing them down.     

273
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,670
       They'd keep coming       
      right down the road,      

274
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,172
  right into that machine gun.  

275
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,242
  But there were waves of them. 

276
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,649
            NARRATOR:           
     The Germans kept coming    
        at the Americans,       

277
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:22,318
        pushing them back       
     or flowing around them.    

278
00:20:25,156 --> 00:20:30,226
      As Hitler had hoped,      
   thick clouds and ground fog  

279
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:33,797
      kept Allied warplanes     
         out of the sky.        

280
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,904
      Some men simply fled.     

281
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:46,176
    Surrounded by the enemy,    
    cut off from one another,   

282
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,179
        out of ammunition       
    and unable to fight back,   

283
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,583
       others were forced       
         to surrender--         

284
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:56,220
      more than 10,000 men.     

285
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:08,865
   Most struggled to hold on.   

286
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:16,507
    Clerks and truck drivers    
  who had never fired a carbine 

287
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:19,742
   found themselves in combat.  

288
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:23,079
       Some officers acted      
       like traffic cops,       

289
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:29,920
   trying to restore order to   
 the chaos on the clogged roads.

290
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:43,533
            GALLOWAY:           
   At, uh, one point I'm there  

291
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:47,537
         and I'm trying         
     to figure out tactics.     

292
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,373
   And to be perfectly honest,  
           I figured,           

293
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,077
       as a junior officer      
        in the artillery        

294
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,211
    I'd be a forward observer   

295
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:57,981
   and I didn't have to worry   
     about tactics too much.    

296
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,284
    As it ended up, here I am   
  in charge and trying to say,  

297
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,586
   "Why did you sleep through   
      tactics?" and, uh...      

298
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:07,056
       It makes you think.      

299
00:22:07,058 --> 00:22:11,395
            NARRATOR:           
      The Germans continued     
           to advance.          

300
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:13,696
         On December 17,        

301
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:16,866
        an SS panzer unit       
   ambushed an American convoy  

302
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,970
       near a tiny village      
         called Malmedy,        

303
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:23,941
 captured and disarmed 150 men, 

304
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:29,746
      and then gunned down      
      at least 86 of them.      

305
00:22:35,653 --> 00:22:42,158
       They also butchered      
  scores of Belgian civilians.  

306
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:53,003
 News of the killing spread fast
 among the embattled Americans. 

307
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:58,409
            LEOPOLD:            
  Archie Costran was the first  
     sergeant of our outfit.    

308
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:01,812
          Came up to me         
         within the hour        

309
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:06,483
 with word of what had happened 
     at the Malmedy massacre    

310
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,620
  only two miles away from us.  

311
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:14,057
  He said, "If you are captured 

312
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:21,698
    and identified as Jewish,   
       you will not live."      

313
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,437
    He said, "Ray, why don't    
     you do what I'm doing?     

314
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:31,608
      "Take your dog tags,      
 with its big letter 'H' on it, 

315
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:37,881
   "wrap it around your hand,   
     put your glove back on.    

316
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:42,619
   If, by chance, you're ever   
 forced to surrender," he said, 

317
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,622
    "as you raise your hand,    
        throw the glove,        

318
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:52,262
   together with the dog tag,   
 into the snow and step on it." 

319
00:23:53,531 --> 00:24:00,737
    For 12 days, my hand had    
 the dog tag wrapped around it. 

320
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:09,412
            NARRATOR:           
      The Germans succeeded     
 in smashing through the center 

321
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:13,617
   and spreading out to create  
       a 50-mile salient,       

322
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,187
  a "bulge" in the Allied line. 

323
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:21,091
  The Americans managed to keep 
 the breakthrough from widening 

324
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:22,926
 by holding on to two villages--

325
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:27,731
      St. Vith to the north     
   and Bastogne in the south.   

326
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:32,202
            GALLOWAY:           
     The unit tightened up,     
         and we held...         

327
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,471
    (rapid automatic gunfire)   

328
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,642
      Until... we had about     
        a day, two days,        

329
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,611
         and then we had        
     to start dropping back.    

330
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:44,814
   So we'd drop back and fire,  
       drop back and fire.      

331
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:48,285
 At that time I didn't know it, 

332
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:52,689
     but apparently we were     
   trying to protect Bastogne.  

333
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:57,194
 I had never heard of Bastogne. 

334
00:24:57,196 --> 00:25:00,063
       I didn't know there      
        was such a place,       

335
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:05,101
       but we were trying       
      to protect Bastogne.      

336
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,404
            NARRATOR:           
    The little town commanded   

337
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,305
    seven all-weather roads.    

338
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:12,742
Keeping the Germans from gaining
     control of those roads     

339
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:16,079
       was now the Allies'      
        highest priority.       

340
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:22,652
            GALLOWAY:           
 I was asked to go out and ride 
 recon, and that was a mistake. 

341
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:28,225
   And I reported that, uh...   
    German tanks were coming,   

342
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:32,362
 and I could hear them speaking,
    <i> "Sprechen Sie Deutsch?"</i>    

343
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,365
    so, uh, I had to back up.   

344
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,934
            NARRATOR:           
      But it was too late.      

345
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:42,138
    Tom Galloway and his men    
        were surrounded.        

346
00:25:42,473 --> 00:25:45,709
      They hid in a house.      

347
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:50,947
            GALLOWAY:           
     They brought a tank up,    
 shot that house up pretty bad. 

348
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:58,488
            NARRATOR:           
   Left with no other option,   
      Galloway surrendered.     

349
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,057
      Well, you never think     
   you're going to get caught.  

350
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,493
      You think, "It's not      
     going to happen to me."    

351
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,396
            NARRATOR:           
           He and some          
     of his fellow captives     

352
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,731
  were sent deep inside Germany 

353
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:13,370
    to a prison camp 40 miles   
       east of Frankfurt.       

354
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:18,642
  Meanwhile, the 101st Airborne 
  was ordered to hold Bastogne  

355
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:22,379
   until other reinforcements   
    could reach the Ardennes.   

356
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:26,650
While elements of the First Army
 drove south toward the forest, 

357
00:26:26,652 --> 00:26:29,118
     General George Patton's    
           Third Army           

358
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,154
   began a headlong rush north  

359
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,122
   to try to relieve Bastogne   

360
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:36,158
<i>before</i> the enemy could take it. 

361
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:43,934
 The Germans encircled the town 
     and began to shell it.     

362
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:56,412
       (frenzied shouting)      

363
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:06,355
    The surrounded Americans    

364
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:09,326
        began running out       
     of ammunition, food...     

365
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,194
            medicine.           

366
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,666
   (shell whizzing, exploding)  

367
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,811
     On December 22, German     
   officers under a white flag  

368
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,346
     approached the American    
     commander at Bastogne,     

369
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:35,918
    General Anthony McAuliffe   
     of the 101st Airborne.     

370
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:40,389
    The Americans' situation    
    was hopeless, they said.    

371
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:42,325
    The town was surrounded.    

372
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,261
          They demanded         
    the Americans surrender.    

373
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:51,468
    McAuliffe had a one-word    
         answer: "Nuts!"        

374
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,271
         The Germans had        
     no idea what he meant,     

375
00:27:55,273 --> 00:28:01,844
but they returned to their lines
 and the shelling started again.

376
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:18,695
      But the next morning,     

377
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,062
        the skies cleared       

378
00:28:20,064 --> 00:28:22,866
     and were quickly filled    
       with Allied planes,      

379
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,235
      bombing and strafing      
          German armor          

380
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,138
      and dropping supplies     
         and ammunition         

381
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,373
   to the besieged Americans.   

382
00:28:39,716 --> 00:28:40,784
   They were still surrounded,  

383
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:44,254
          still cut off         
    from help on the ground,    

384
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,856
        but now, at least       
      they had food to eat      

385
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:50,927
         and ammunition         
    with which to shoot back.   

386
00:28:56,567 --> 00:29:00,436
       And they were fast       
 becoming a symbol back home... 

387
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,172
     of American resistance.    

388
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:12,816
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
     The Battle of the Bulge    
         was publicized.        

389
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:16,886
        We knew they were       
    holding out in Bastogne.    

390
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:20,156
         And we were all        
        cheering them on.       

391
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,426
       Again, we know now       
      how dreadful it was,      

392
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,063
   but we were very conscious   
   of the Battle of the Bulge,  

393
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:30,834
     because we felt like we    
    had just about completed    

394
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:32,902
    that campaign in Europe.    

395
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,671
          And when this         
       counterattack came,      

396
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,842
        it came as a blow       
      to the entire nation.     

397
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:47,283
    ("Silent Night" playing)    

398
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,386
      PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT:      
      It is not easy to say     
        "Merry Christmas"       

399
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:53,389
  to you, my fellow Americans,  

400
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:57,994
          in this time          
       of destructive war.      

401
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:02,832
          Nor can I say         
    "Merry Christmas" lightly   

402
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,468
   tonight to our armed forces  

403
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,407
    at their battle stations    
       all over the world.      

404
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:15,878
            NARRATOR:           
       General Eisenhower,      
     as surprised as anyone     

405
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
         by the success         
     of the German advance,     

406
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:23,820
nevertheless saw the opportunity
     embedded in the crisis.    

407
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,022
        The Germans were        
        on the offensive        

408
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,025
       for the first time       
         since Normandy,        

409
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,828
         but that meant         
        they were exposed       

410
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,766
     and could be themselves    
     surrounded and cut off.    

411
00:30:40,604 --> 00:30:44,741
        On Christmas Day,       
   30 miles west of Bastogne,   

412
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:49,145
      the Americans stopped     
       the German advance.      

413
00:30:50,214 --> 00:30:51,514
       The following day,       

414
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,117
         American tanks         
 broke through the German lines 

415
00:30:54,119 --> 00:31:00,390
  and linked up with the 101st  
    Airborne inside Bastogne.   

416
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:08,765
    The men there celebrated    
      a belated Christmas,      

417
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,300
  despite the shells and bombs  

418
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:14,437
         that continued         
       to fall around them      

419
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,407
and the fighting that lay ahead.

00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,674
            NARRATOR:           
     The grandparents Sascha    
 Weinzheimer called Opa and Oma 

443
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,644
 lived in the Sacramento Valley.

444
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,813
 Her grandfather blamed himself 

445
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,516
   for his family's captivity   
       in the Philippines.      

446
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:08,985
  When they'd asked to go home  

447
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,920
          in the weeks          
      before Pearl Harbor,      

448
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,757
     he'd insisted they stay    
        where they were,        

449
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,893
 certain there would be no war. 

450
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,561
        Once he knew they       
      had been imprisoned,      

451
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:22,632
  he had tried to get messages  
 and Red Cross packages to them 

452
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:25,501
       month after month.       

453
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,004
    His health began to fail.   

454
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:35,578
  My dad walked me to the main  
     building for my siesta     

455
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,882
   because the camp shut down,  
       um, for three hours      

456
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:41,617
     in the heat of the day.

      of Bethlehem" plays)      

458
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:48,591
   So he stopped at the desk,   
         and they said,         

459
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:53,162
    "Oh, we have a Red Cross    
       telegram for you."       

460
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:56,432
   It was from my grandmother.  

461
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,636
  And it said my grandfather... 

462
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:03,273
          he had passed         
      eight months prior...     

463
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:06,409
  and we were just getting it.  

464
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,145
    He stood there and cried,   

465
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:12,682
       and then walked me       
         up to my room.         

466
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:15,952
        Everybody told us       

467
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:19,455
       that my grandfather      
         literally died         

468
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,390
       of a broken heart.       

469
00:34:26,062 --> 00:34:29,499
            NARRATOR:           
    That evening, the family    
          did its best          

470
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,300
    to celebrate the holiday.   

471
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,335
        They made a tree        
      out of a palm branch      

472
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,705
       stuck in a tin can       
        filled with dirt        

473
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:38,908
   and lined up at the canteen  
    with the other prisoners    

474
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,209
      for a special treat--     

475
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:46,850
     two tablespoons of jam     
   and one bite of chocolate.   

476
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,852
Sascha thought it all delicious,

477
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:54,023
  even though "there were tiny  
 white worms in the chocolate." 

478
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,696
         American planes        
  could be heard overhead again 

479
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:06,970
     and scores of leaflets     
 fluttered out of the dark sky--

480
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:10,206
    from the troops fighting    
their way across the Philippines

481
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,243
        toward Manila...        

482
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:15,578
          toward them.

00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,224
          BURT WILSON:          
    I became a<i> Sacramento Bee</i>   
 news carrier at the age of ten,

484
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,726
     and for me, the war was    

485
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,662
     that little square map     
        on the front page       

486
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:38,934
   where it showed wavy lines   
    moving in some direction,   

487
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:42,672
   and then the next day you'd  
  see them move a little more,  

488
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,240
       and arrows pointed       
         here and there         

489
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:48,577
     where different armies     
           were going.          

490
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,613
   And then, all of a sudden,   

491
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,948
 there was this bulge in the map

492
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,617
       that was going back      
         the other way.         

493
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,819
       That was the Battle      
          of the Bulge.         

494
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,588
          And, my God,          
     what's happening here?     

495
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,190
        Are we losing now       
     that we're this close?     

496
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,326
         We all took it         
      seriously because...      

497
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,330
       the lines had moved      
         the other way.

00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,294
         BURNETT MILLER:        
      I think that we went      

515
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:47,463
   to have a great experience.  

516
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,299
       And all of a sudden      
         we were having         

517
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:53,869
   more of a great experience   
than we really had reckoned for.

518
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,338
         We were scared         
      to death, of course.      

519
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:00,877
            NARRATOR:           
  Burnett Miller of Sacramento, 
who had been raised a few blocks

520
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,077
  from where Burt Wilson lived, 

521
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,948
    was a private in the 21st   
   Armored Infantry Battalion,  

522
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,583
     11th Armored Division.     

523
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,720
   He was among the thousands   
       of American troops       

524
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,321
    ordered into the Ardennes   

525
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:17,459
       to relieve Bastogne      
   and drive the Germans back.  

526
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:22,064
      It would be Miller's      
    first real taste of war.    

527
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:25,468
             MILLER:            
       We crossed France,       

528
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,003
  went through parts of Belgium 

529
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:31,874
        and hit the Bulge       
       in a big snowstorm.      

530
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:35,577
          Our vehicles          
    became almost inoperable.   

531
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:42,050
     (artillery explosions)     

532
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:46,421
       (clamoring shouts)       

533
00:38:49,826 --> 00:38:54,396
    And the tanks, one after    
     another, were blown up,    

534
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:56,598
  and we could see dead tankers 

535
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,169
   and wounded tankers running  
  for cover all over the place. 

536
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:04,573
  That was not a pretty sight.  

537
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:08,210
  We bailed out of these tracks 

538
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,312
       and started running      
        through the snow        

539
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:14,350
 to get some kind of coverage...

540
00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:18,688
    ...and actually retreated   
      back up onto a hill,      

541
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:26,629
   dug in and spent that night  
       in a big snowstorm.      

542
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,467
   We were wet, and I thought,  

543
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,036
       "Boy, I don't think      
        we can make it."        

544
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,337
        (shell explodes)        

545
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:39,141
And that night there were tracer
       bullets all over--       

546
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:44,613
       lots of artillery--      
        very, very scary.       

547
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:49,452
  And you'd rationalize things, 
  like nothing worse can happen 

548
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:52,521
       but getting killed.      

549
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:59,394
 But there... there were things 
    worse than being killed.    

550
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:02,598
   (somber blues music plays)   

551
00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:18,313
            NARRATOR:           
  In the Ardennes, the fighting 
     and the dying went on.     

552
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:23,285
    It was the coldest winter   
           in memory.           

553
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:28,457
  Many men were without winter  
     boots or winter coats.     

554
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:35,865
     Thousands lost fingers,    
   toes or feet to frostbite.   

555
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:48,677
             MILLER:            
      Lots of our equipment     
        wasn't very good.       

556
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,947
    We always had frozen feet   

557
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:55,985
  because our shoes were really 
        very, very poor.        

558
00:40:55,987 --> 00:41:01,857
   Also, you know, we went to,  
    into combat in the Bulge    

559
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:05,361
      in the same overcoats     
      we went to London in      

560
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:08,063
    and they were big, bulky,   
        miserable things        

561
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,432
       that would get wet.      

562
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:13,736
 And pretty soon we were looking

563
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:17,273
      for German prisoners      
         or German dead.        

564
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:24,280
 They had nice, white, bunny fur
jackets that were just terrific,

565
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:30,052
 not only comfortable and warm, 
 but were white and camouflaged.

566
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:37,860
          HERNDON INGE:         
   Morale, I thought, kept up   
  because you were with people. 

567
00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:46,668
    That as long as you were    
   with other GIs in the snow   

568
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,704
       and in the misery,       
if you had somebody next to you,

569
00:41:49,706 --> 00:41:53,909
  you figured, "Well, they can  
  handle it, I can handle it."  

570
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:58,180
         You just, uh...        
       keep moving ahead.       

571
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,983
 (artillery whizzing, exploding)

572
00:42:14,898 --> 00:42:17,466
         (men shouting)         

573
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:24,673
       (soldiers shouting)      

574
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,846
            NARRATOR:           
     In the chaotic fighting    
         that followed,         

575
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,450
    some towns changed hands    
           four times.          

576
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:37,152
    Civilians hid in cellars    

577
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,922
  as their homes were destroyed 
           above them.          

578
00:42:41,457 --> 00:42:45,194
 Allied troops had to recapture 
    the ground they had lost    

579
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:50,199
      inch by frozen inch,      
 sometimes reoccupying foxholes 

580
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:54,203
     they'd been forced from    
    just a few weeks earlier.   

581
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,261
   (men shouting, explosions)   

582
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:27,770
  The Americans lost an average 
       of 1,600 men a day.      

583
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:33,141
   Among the dead were Private  
   John Tavera of Sacramento,   

584
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,843
      Corporal Lester Bendt     
           of Luverne,          

585
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:39,147
   Private First Class Domenic  
      DeRosimo of Waterbury     

586
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:45,421
  and Private First Class Jesse 
   Leon Hattenstien of Mobile.  

587
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:49,892
    (shell whizzes, explodes)   

588
00:43:52,328 --> 00:43:54,997
      Those who were killed     
    and wounded were replaced   

589
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:59,534
 by thousands of green troops-- 
    mostly high-school boys--   

590
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:03,338
   who had been rushed through  
         basic training.        

591
00:44:04,574 --> 00:44:07,009
            (gunfire)           

592
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:17,286
  Many replacements died before 
officers could learn their names

593
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:23,124
 and were replaced by still more
      frightened newcomers.     

594
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:29,965
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
   I had a friend who claimed   

595
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,401
           he was sent          
  into the Battle of the Bulge  

596
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:37,106
    with six weeks' training    
        and a new rifle.        

597
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:42,078
 Graylap said if he had not been
shootin' squirrels all his life,

598
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,448
          he would have         
      been completely lost.     

599
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,951
     But he shot the Germans    
     like he would squirrels    

600
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,654
        and that was it.        

601
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:58,294
            NARRATOR:           
 Some officers ordered their men
  to take no German prisoners.  

602
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:02,531
   The memory of the massacre   
       of American troops       

603
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:06,101
   at Malmedy remained fresh.   

604
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:14,076
             MILLER:            
       We had been held up      
        at a little town.       

605
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,411
        We were supposed        
    to just walk through it,    

606
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,914
and the Germans stopped us dead.

607
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,749
   We just couldn't crack it.   

608
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,218
Fire!                           

609
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,055
 Eventually artillery came in...

610
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,825
   sort of leveled the houses.  

611
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:32,494
    They finally surrendered,   

612
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:35,497
        and they came out       
      and sort of lined up      

613
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:39,134
   and per usual, no one knew   
       what was going on.       

614
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,737
         (men shouting)         

615
00:45:42,438 --> 00:45:45,573
     We had a new battalion     
           commander,           

616
00:45:45,575 --> 00:45:50,645
 just graduated from West Point,
  and he lined 'em up and said, 

617
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:53,615
   "I want you to shoot 'em."   

618
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,450
      And I was horrified.      

619
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:58,220
        Quite a few of us       
         were horrified.        

620
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,522
 And I went to him and told him,
            you know,           

621
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:06,027
    that this was against all   
 international law and humanity.

622
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:10,733
  My good buddy, who I'd spent  
       so much time with,       

623
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:13,402
      grabbed me and said,      
     "This nut'll shoot<i> you.</i>    

624
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:15,571
       You better quit...       
     knock this off, and..."    

625
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:21,710
 And he got enough guys and they
 shot these about 25 prisoners. 

626
00:46:23,012 --> 00:46:25,080
 It was a terrible thing to see,

627
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:31,186
   and I talked to a lot of my  
 buddies who had shot these guys

628
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:34,556
  and they were horrified, too. 

629
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,108
        (wind whistling)        

630
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:58,714
            NARRATOR:           
      By January 30, 1945,      

631
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:02,117
   six weeks after the German   
offensive in the Ardennes began,

632
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:06,388
    six weeks after the start   
   of the Battle of the Bulge,  

633
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,424
 the Allies had finally managed 

634
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:12,661
    to regain all the ground    
          they'd lost.          

635
00:47:19,435 --> 00:47:24,539
 It had been the biggest battle 
of the war on the Western Front.

636
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:28,010
     More than a million men    
           took part.           

637
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:31,913
     19,000 Americans died.     

638
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:35,150
  60,000 more had been wounded  

639
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:39,521
      or captured or listed     
           as missing.          

640
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:45,026
    Hitler's enormous gamble    
     had ended in disaster.     

641
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,762
  He had lost some 100,000 men  

642
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:51,633
   and virtually all his tanks  
          and aircraft          

643
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:56,437
       and now had no way       
       of replacing them.       

644
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:01,609
          (explosions)          

645
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:08,583
  And in the east, the Russian  
    army was blasting its way   

646
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:12,287
   closer to Berlin every day.  

647
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:22,698
          (explosions)          

648
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:27,535
            LEOPOLD:            
        They had blown up       
         our chow truck.        

649
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:30,505
   So these big aluminum cans   

650
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:32,808
   that contained the variety   
        of food they had        

651
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,478
           were spaced          
    about 40, 50 feet apart.    

652
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,382
  If a shell came in, it would  
    only kill one or two men,   

653
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:45,954
  instead of groups of us if we 
   were all blocked together.   

654
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:52,394
 We walked down the line slowly 
   and opened up our mess kits  

655
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:55,464
       and in the big pan       
        of your mess kit,       

656
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:59,134
      the first man placed      
      two pieces of toast.      

657
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:03,004
    The second man put a nice   
      half-inch-thick piece     

658
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:08,877
    of magnificent roast beef   
   covering most of the toast.  

659
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:12,947
 The third man a ladle of gravy 
         over all of it.        

660
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,249
      Everything was fine.      

661
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:17,319
 The next man gave us a scoopful

662
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:22,658
        of reconstituted        
     dried peas and carrots.    

663
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,493
         It was proper.         

664
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:25,527
          It was good.          

665
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:26,762
       It was on one side.      

666
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:29,598
       And finally we came      
     to the end of the line.    

667
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,501
    And the end of the line,    
       the man reached in       

668
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:35,804
   and took a great big scoop   
      of chocolate pudding      

669
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,873
           and covered          
   this magnificent roast beef  

670
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,710
   from one side to the other   
     with chocolate pudding.    

671
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,780
  I don't know how many of you  
          have ever had         

672
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:46,548
  chocolate pudding roast beef. 

673
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,584
       But I can tell you,      
       despite this fact--      

674
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,788
       despite the insult       
       that must have come      

675
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,690
     to this beautiful piece    
            of meat--           

676
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,891
   we loved every single bite.  

677
00:49:56,893 --> 00:50:02,864
        I still remember        
 chocolate-flavored roast beef. 

678
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:07,769
   (airplane engines droning)

            NARRATOR:           
          On January 8,         
 an American plane had flown low

680
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:25,486
  over Santo Tomas prison camp  
            in Manila           

681
00:50:25,488 --> 00:50:27,555
    and dropped new leaflets.   

682
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:32,628
  They, too, were addressed to  
 the people of the Philippines. 

683
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:36,698
       "General MacArthur       
    has returned," they said.   

684

         over the radio,

    of really severe hunger--   

704
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,688
 it comes over you like waves-- 

705
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:11,359
    and then I'd do something   
         to distract me.        

706
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:16,431
    Like drumming on the side   
 of the shanty, or making noise,

707
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,099
      or even go screaming      
          a little bit,         

708
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:23,204
   just to get it out of your   
   system, and then I'd go on.  

709
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:27,943
    But the kids would cry...   

710
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,978
     and grab their throat,     

711
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,215
   or they'd grab their belly   
     and go up to my mother.    

712
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:38,920
      That... that probably     
 was a very bad thing, you know,

713
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,990
      to see your kids do.

     To me, the real heroes     
           of the war           

732
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,653
   were those who very seldom   
           get medals.          

733
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:20,121
       They're the medics.      

734
00:54:20,889 --> 00:54:24,592
  Whenever a man gets injured,  

735
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,928
 he very, very seldom calls out 

736
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,798
       for his sweetheart       
         or his mother.         

737
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,735
    First thing he calls out    
          is the medic.         

738
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:36,638
    He always says, "Medic!"    

739
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:42,577
And whenever that word is heard,
     the medic rushes over.     

740
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:47,115
        And to rush over,       
   he is just dodging bullets.  

741
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:52,487

 Munitions are a terrible thing.

      It's not a clean cut.     
       It tears. It rips.       

747
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:29,190
      I can't imagine what      
    the medics went through.    

748
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:32,560

            NARRATOR:           
  Medics were paid ten dollars  
         less per month         

751
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:42,370
than the men they tried to save.

752
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:47,909
       Many were pacifists      
  and conscientious objectors,  

753
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:50,846
    unwilling to take lives,    
           but willing          

754
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,948

         to save others.        

755
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,961
    Like the men they tended,   

756
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,832
    they learned to improvise   
           in combat.           

757

 During the Battle of the Bulge,

758
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:23,678
       they kept morphine       
 and plasma inside their shorts 

759

    to keep it from freezing.   

760

     on their helmets green     

761
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:36,090

    targets for the Japanese.   

762
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:41,663
         And everywhere,        
        they were forced        

763
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:44,733
    to make terrible choices.

        to you for help,        

769
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:07,689
  and you must doctor somebody  

770
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:11,425

       to pass somebody by      
    who is in need of comfort   

773
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,239
    but is not going to live.   

774
00:57:24,241 --> 00:57:31,413
       It's never pleasant      
   to do the work of a medic.   

775
00:57:31,415 --> 00:57:39,153
 But it's one of the essentials 
     of civilized behavior.     

776
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:56,771
            NARRATOR:           
     There were some wounds     
      no medic could treat.     

777
00:58:03,946 --> 00:58:06,681
    (film projector clacking)   

778
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:09,617
What were you                   
afraid of?                      

779
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,885
           Everything.          

780
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,787
What in particular?             

781
00:58:14,723 --> 00:58:15,756
              Dead.             

782
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:16,724
What?                           

783
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:17,692
              Dead.             

784
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:18,392
Dead what?                      

785
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,895
          Dead people.          
           I can't...           

786
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,463
       stand seeing them.       

787
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:23,531
I can't hear you.               

788
00:58:23,533 --> 00:58:27,402
          I can't stand         
       seeing dead people.      

789
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:31,038
            NARRATOR:           
 There were many names for it-- 

790
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,911
"shell shock," "battle fatigue,"
      "combat exhaustion."      

791
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:39,381
         One out of four        
       of all the Army men      

792
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:43,050
  evacuated for medical reasons 
    in Europe and the Pacific   

793
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:48,089
     suffered from some form    
  of neuropsychiatric disorder. 

794
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:49,891
        (shell explodes)        

795
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,694
    Army planners determined    
    that the average soldier    

796
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:57,031
     could withstand no more    
     than 240 days of combat    

797
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,301
       without going mad.       

798
00:59:03,271 --> 00:59:05,573
     (rapid artillery fire,     
          men shouting)         

799
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:06,741
      By that time, though,     

800
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:12,780
  the average soldier was more  
  than likely dead or wounded.  

801
00:59:19,021 --> 00:59:22,490
      (insects chittering)      

802
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:27,294
   (jaunty piano jazz playing)  

803
00:59:30,365 --> 00:59:35,736
         NAT KING COLE:         
       ¶ Knock me a kiss,       
       you'll never miss ¶      

804
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,439
    ¶ When I'm ready to go ¶    

805
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:43,311

          and say yes ¶         

806

          and say no ¶          

807

     in these fine clothes ¶

809
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:59,227
    ¶ But if you can't smile    
          and say yes ¶         

810
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:02,096
       ¶ Please don't cry       
          and say no. ¶         

811
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:07,201
         DOLORES SILVA:         
        During that time,       
 they had a lot of pinup girls. 

812
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:11,205
   Betty Grable had a picture   
 of herself in her bathing suit,

813
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:15,209
     and she's glancing back    
       over her shoulder.       

814
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:19,013
    And it's a back view and,   
      oh, it was gorgeous.      

815
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:25,653
 So I says, "My Norman is going 
 to have his own pinup picture. 

816
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:29,624
    And I had a red and white   
        polka-dot bikini.       

817
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,593
          But you could         
       either wear it low,      

818
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,494
     if you had enough nerve    
            to do it,           

819
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:37,565
      or you could wear it      
     all the way to the top.    

820
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:41,002
     Well, anyway, I put on     
    my red and white bikini,    

821
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:45,273
  and went out in the backyard, 
 and I gave my mother my camera.

822
01:00:45,275 --> 01:00:47,708
 I says, "Here. Take a picture. 

823
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:50,845
  "I want to send it to Norman. 

824
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,648
I'm going to be his pinup girl."

825
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:00,354
       And he carried that      
    through the war with him,   

826
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:03,324
  and he said that he received  
        a lot of comments       

827
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,828
        from his buddies        
   when they saw that picture,  

828
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:08,896
 because after some of them saw 
      it, they says, well,      

829
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:12,133
  they looked at him, and they  
   looked back at the picture   

830
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:13,634
  and they looked at him again, 

831
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:17,305
         and they says,         
   "What does she see in you?"  

832
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:21,509
       And I had a picture      
       of him on my desk--      

833
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,611
  one that he took in France--  

834
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:27,615
       so I was with him,       
       and he was with me.      

835
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:32,052
           SAM HYNES:           
    The best joke I remember    

836
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:33,988
      about the war, uh...      

837
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:39,060
  was not a joke that was told, 
        but that one saw.       

838
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:42,930
   I think it was on Eniwetok,  
          in the, uh...         

839
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:45,967
   in the Officers' Club bar.   

840
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:49,536
      Above the bar, uh...      

841
01:01:49,538 --> 01:01:53,140
        there was, uh...        
     an enormous brassiere,     

842
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:59,146
     as I remember, mounted     
    on a board like a tarpon.   

843
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:04,718
    And underneath, it said,    
     "Remember Pearl Olson."    

844
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,025
         (men shouting)         

845
01:02:32,114 --> 01:02:37,852
SASCHA WEINZHEIMER (dramatized):
       "February 3, 1945.       

846
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,420
   "At about 5:00 last night,   

847
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:43,258
  "ten of our planes came over  
            our camp.           

848
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:48,396
  One pilot dropped his goggles 
   with a note tied to them."   

849
01:02:49,197 --> 01:02:51,666
            "It fell            
   in the main building patio   

850
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:54,502
 "where there weren't any Nips, 

851
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:56,070
   "and a lucky friend of ours  
            found it            

852
01:02:56,072 --> 01:03:00,408
"because we found out right away
          what it said:         

853
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,675
     "'Roll out the barrel!     

854
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:06,313
  "Your Christmas will be here  
       today or tomorrow.'      

855
01:03:06,315 --> 01:03:11,018
     "Shortly we heard guns     
   and tanks in the distance.   

856
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:16,724
  "Everyone thought it must be  
     the Japs, except Daddy.    

857
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:20,161
           He was sure          
     it was the Americans."     

858
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,797
            (gunfire)           

859
01:03:31,673 --> 01:03:38,212
   The liberation was the most  
   exciting thing in my life.   

860
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:42,349
And if I cry, you'll forgive me.

861
01:03:44,186 --> 01:03:46,354
  So on the third of February,  

862
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:51,226
       my father walked me      
      to the main building.     

863
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:55,863
   But while we were walking,   

864
01:03:55,865 --> 01:04:01,001
  we heard these big rumblings  
        in the distance.        

865
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:02,237
 And usually when that happened,

866
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:05,106
   we could, all right, we had  
   trained ears by this point.  

867
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:09,310
 We knew it was the big bombers 
        coming overhead.        

868
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:10,845
  But as we walked, we noticed  

869
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:15,415
  the... it was, the noise was  
   getting louder and louder,   

870
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:17,685
     but there was no planes    
           appearing.           

871
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,020
 And we thought that was weird. 

872
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:22,623
  And people were coming out of 
 their shacks and saying, "Gee! 

873
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,792
            Isn't...            
   this is a different thing."  

874
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,127
              Fire!             

875
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:30,564
            (gunfire)           

876
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:37,038
  And we heard guns going off.  

877
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:44,178
     The Brits were saying,     
      "Oh, it's the Brits!      

878
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:46,213
          They're here!         
      The Limeys are here!"     

879
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,482
     And the Americans said,    
        "Don't be silly.        

880
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:50,651
 This is the Americans coming." 

881
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,953
      So, we were doing...      

882
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:54,555
     rushing back and forth,    

883
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,892
    and because of the fire,    
    the firing and the noise,   

884
01:04:58,894 --> 01:05:02,696
people were just running around,
            you know?           

885
01:05:02,698 --> 01:05:05,632
    They weren't staying put.   

886
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:09,136
  All of a sudden-- and it was, 
we didn't know this till later--

887
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:15,743
   it was, like, three minutes  
     to 9:00 in the evening,    

888
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,747
   they came through, crashed   
     through the front gates    

889
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:23,050
        with their tanks.       

890
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:26,387
      And it was wonderful.     

891
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,355
       People went crazy.       

892
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:32,460
  You'd think the war was over, 
         but it wasn't.         

893
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:40,201
     My mother was bedridden    
          at 73 pounds.         

894
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:47,775
"Now, let's always keep one item
 to wear when our boys come in."

895
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,678
           So she had           
     a half-eaten lipstick.     

896
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:55,183
   I had something, I forgot,   
 a sock, which is now, you know,

897
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:58,453
   no shoes, there's no point   
       in wearing a sock.       

898
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:02,723
      My sister had a clip,     
           a barrette.          

899
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,626
 And so when my father picked up
            my mother           

900
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:11,099
   and ran out of the shanty,   
     she says, "Wait! Wait!"    

901
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:13,568
 So he couldn't understand why. 

902
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:14,402
      She said, "Go back."      

903
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:16,637
    So she reached underneath   
          her mattress          

904
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,575
   and pulled out her lipstick  
         and put it on.         

905
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:23,744
    She said, "Now I'm ready    
          for my boys."         

906
01:06:27,215 --> 01:06:29,984
    (vehicle engine humming)    

907
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:43,731
 (dramatic newsreel music plays)

908
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,900
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
At Santo Tomas prison in Manila,

909
01:06:45,902 --> 01:06:51,472
   safe at last, the internees  
gather for evacuation back home.

910
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:53,040
    Pitifully undernourished,   

911
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:57,377
    they can still chop wood    
 to cook their new Army rations.

912
01:07:12,427 --> 01:07:16,397
         News from home,        
     after three long years;    

913
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,332
    the Red Cross distributes   
     letters from loved ones    

914
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:24,137
these internees had thought they
  might never hear from again.  

915
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:29,643
        (crowd cheering)        

916
01:07:37,085 --> 01:07:41,956
            NARRATOR:           
  As GIs escorted the Japanese  
     guards out of the camp,    

917
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:44,591
      some of the children      
    ran after them shouting,    

918
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:49,563
      "Make them bow, boys!     
         Make them bow!"        

919
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:54,802
        Four days later,        

920
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:59,706
    General MacArthur himself   
      visited Santo Tomas.      

921
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:09,283
          WEINZHEIMER:          
   February 7 is my birthday.   

922
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:11,185
        I had turned 12.        

923
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:15,589
      And MacArthur came in     
         for 20 minutes,        

924
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:19,627
 greeted the prisoners and left.

925
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:21,595
        (shell whizzing)        

926
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:24,598
        (thud, explosion)       

927
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:32,139
And as soon as he left, the Japs
   started shelling the camp.   

928
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:37,845
  And we had a lot of internees 
        that were killed.       

929
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:40,981
       A lot of soldiers,       
      GIs that were killed.     

930
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:44,585
       And it was just one      
  of those wild things that...  

931
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:47,220
            There was           
     just blood everywhere,     

932
01:08:47,222 --> 01:08:52,025
         and stretchers         
    and, um, people running.    

933
01:08:54,295 --> 01:08:57,231
There were two days of shelling.

934
01:08:57,233 --> 01:09:00,935
        We spent two days       
     in the central kitchen     

935
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:05,039
   until they found the nest.   

936
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:21,855
            NARRATOR:           
      The battle for Manila     
    would go on for a month.    

937
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:30,164
 Most of the city was destroyed.

938
01:09:31,566 --> 01:09:34,568
   A thousand Americans died.   

939
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:37,938
 So did 16,000 Japanese soldiers

940
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:42,443
   and nearly 100,000 Filipino  
            civilians           

941
01:09:42,445 --> 01:09:43,744
      hit by artillery fire     

942
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:47,347
         or slaughtered         
  by their retreating captors.  

943
01:10:04,432 --> 01:10:07,168
    WEINZHEIMER (dramatized):   
            "March 8.           

944
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:12,305
"Major George Woods took Mother,
    Dad and me through Manila   

945
01:10:12,307 --> 01:10:15,609
  "in a jeep to see the ruins.  

946
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:19,013
 "We had heard how badly Manila 
         was destroyed,         

947
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:21,982
      "but until we saw it      
       with our own eyes,       

948
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:27,054
      "we couldn't believe      
   such a thing could happen.   

949
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,324
 "The whole city, nothing left! 

950
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:35,863
  "Taft Avenue, the Boulevard,  
      everything in ruins.      

951
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:39,933
     "The odor from the dead    
           was awful,           

952
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:41,135
    "and whenever we stopped,   

953
01:10:41,137 --> 01:10:44,805
       the big green flies      
       were all over us."       

954
01:10:58,286 --> 01:11:04,257
         GLENN FRAZIER:         
  The information that we were  
        getting in Japan        

955
01:11:04,259 --> 01:11:06,326
        was very sketchy.       

956
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:10,864
  We would see some of the maps 
 on the paper, on the newspapers

957
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:15,035
on the stands as we were passing
  showing that the Navy was...  

958
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:18,672
  the Navy battles were closer, 
and that was encouraging for us.

959
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:20,407
   But it was still a question  

960
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:24,344
      as how we were going      
      to get out of there.      

961
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,920
      (trolley bell clangs)     

962
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:37,824
            NARRATOR:           
         Glenn Frazier,         
   from Ft. Deposit, Alabama,   

963
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:41,361
             was one            
   of 168,000 Allied prisoners  

964
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:45,765
    still in Japanese hands.    

965
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:48,869
      He had been captured      
       in the Philippines       

966
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:53,440
    after the fall of Bataan    
     in the spring of 1942.     

967
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,142
Frazier had then been so certain
          he would die          

968
01:11:56,144 --> 01:11:59,913
 that he had thrown his dog tags
        into a mass grave       

969
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:01,682
  so that when they were found, 

970
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:06,687
his parents would have some idea
  of what had happened to him.  

971
01:12:09,557 --> 01:12:12,927
            Now, with           
    the Philippines retaken,    

972
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:16,396
      American troops came      
         upon the grave.        

973
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:19,266
            FRAZIER:            
 So then they found the dog tags

974
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:20,801
   that I threw in the grave.   

975
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:27,074
   So they had absolute proof   
 that I was in that mass grave. 

976
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:28,675
    So they take the dog tags   

977
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:32,713
and the, uh, Army gentleman goes
      to my mother and dad      

978
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:34,815
     and tried to show them     
          the dog tags          

979
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,751
       and tried to settle      
         the insurance.         

980
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:40,587
        So my daddy said,       
  "Well, if I take the $10,000  

981
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:44,090
       and he's not dead,       
       what happens then?"      

982
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:46,793
    And he says, "You'll have   
        to pay it back."        

983
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:48,728
            He said,            
    "Well, you just keep it,    

984
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:54,268
"because I'm sure if anybody can
  make it, my son can make it.  

985
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:57,470
       "And if he's dead,       
   then I'll come back to you   

986
01:12:57,472 --> 01:12:59,673
      and get the $10,000."     

987
01:13:02,811 --> 01:13:04,645
      (car engine humming)

  The historic Yalta Conference 
   as it arrives at decisions   

990
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:18,859
         that will shape        
    the future of the world.    

991
01:13:18,861 --> 01:13:23,998
   The Big Three reaffirm the   
 ideals of the Atlantic Charter.

992
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,566
            NARRATOR:           
      On February 4, 1945,      

993
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:31,071
the day after Sascha Weinzheimer
 and her family were liberated, 

994
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,774
      the Big Three-- U.S.      
  President Franklin Roosevelt, 

995
01:13:34,776 --> 01:13:37,411
     British Prime Minister     
       Winston Churchill,       

996
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,513
       and Soviet Premier       
         Josef Stalin--         

997
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:42,582
 met at Yalta on the Black Sea. 

998
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:47,487
In week-long talks, they pledged
     to hold free elections     

999
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:50,524
        after the war in        
   the Eastern European states  

1000
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:52,226
    captured by the Soviets,    

1001
01:13:52,228 --> 01:13:54,694
  and agreed to divide Germany  
           and Austria          

1002
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:58,132
 into three zones of occupation.

1003
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:02,235
     But first, Germany had     
     finally to be defeated.    

1004
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:06,573
   The Nazis were still trying  
     to reinforce their army    

1005
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:08,308
      on the Eastern Front.     

1006
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,311
       Stalin wanted help       

1007
01:14:10,313 --> 01:14:15,149
    from American and British   
     air power to stop them.    

1008
01:14:15,151 --> 01:14:17,484
    The Soviet leader called    
         for air attacks        

1009
01:14:17,486 --> 01:14:20,387
      on railroad stations      
      and marshaling yards,     

1010
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:23,457
   often located in the hearts  
           of cities.           

1011
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,093
  Dresden was the first target, 

1012
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:28,328
      a beautiful old city      
          on the Elbe,          

1013
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,330
      through which German      
         reinforcements         

1014
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:33,967
 were said to be streaming east.

1015
01:14:36,437 --> 01:14:41,708
     On February 13 and 14,     
900 British and American bombers

1016
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:49,049
    hit Dresden in two waves,   
    dropping incendiary bombs   

1017
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:52,553
       in hopes of setting      
        off a firestorm.        

1018
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:57,590
         They succeeded.        

1019
01:15:06,534 --> 01:15:11,438
    At least 35,000 civilians   
  were burned or blown apart--  

1020
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:17,911
 or asphyxiated as they huddled 
 in basements and bomb shelters.

1021
01:15:19,714 --> 01:15:24,617
      The bombing went on,      
    battering oil facilities,   

1022
01:15:24,619 --> 01:15:28,822
       defense factories,       
       roads and railways       

1023
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,991
        and more cities.        

1024
01:15:31,659 --> 01:15:35,862
      Pforzheim, Würzburg,      

1025
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:41,468
    Essen, Dortmund, Potsdam.   

1026
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:50,544
In March alone, Allied warplanes
  dropped 163,864 tons of bombs 

1027
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,845
          on Germany--          

1028
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,414
         almost as many         
       as they had dropped      

1029
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:57,350
        in the preceding        
      three years combined.     

1030
01:15:57,352 --> 01:16:00,520
By the middle of the next month,

1031
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:02,623
         the air chiefs         
       would call a halt.       

1032
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:06,660
  They had run out of targets.  

1033
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:13,934
        By then, 593,000        
        German civilians        

1034
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:17,370
  had died under Allied bombs.  

1035
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:19,673
        Most were women.        

1036
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:23,710
More than 100,000 were children.

1037
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:36,356
    AL McINTOSH (dramatized):   
       "February 15, 1945.      

1038
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:40,293
 "When John Bosch was in Luverne
          last Friday,          

1039
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:43,964
 "he happened to stop and count 
         the gold stars         

1040
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,665
    "on the Honor Roll board    

1041
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:49,469
      "and said, 'There are     
       now 20 gold stars.'      

1042
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:51,004
    "He didn't know it then,    

1043
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:55,442
     "but the 21st gold star    
 would be that opposite the name

1044
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:56,476
        "of his own son,        

1045
01:16:56,478 --> 01:17:04,918
       Pfc. Everett Bosch,      
    who was killed on Luzon."   

1046
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:08,789
   "The message telling of his  
  son's death was handed Bosch  

1047
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,392
         when he reached        
    his home that afternoon."

         Al McIntosh,           
   <i> Rock County Star-Herald.</i>    

1049
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:21,268
         (rapid gunfire)        

1050
01:17:22,703 --> 01:17:29,343
        QUENTIN AANENSON:       
        I believe it was        
      February 22 of 1945.      

1051
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:34,348
   At that point I was housed   
      in a medieval castle      

1052
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:38,786
      that was right there      
     on the, uh, Ruhr River     

1053
01:17:38,788 --> 01:17:42,589
   about two and a half miles   
    back from the Ruhr River.   

1054
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:46,059
 I was set up in the great hall 
          of the castle         

1055
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:48,328
with my maps and telephone lines
           coming in.           

1056
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,565
            NARRATOR:           
 Fighter pilot Quentin Aanenson 
           of Luverne           

1057
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,935
 was no longer flying missions. 

1058
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:58,872
  He'd been promoted to captain 
    and was now coordinating    

1059
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:01,775
air strikes from what he assumed
            would be            

1060
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:05,946
       the relative safety      
         of the ground.         

1061
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:08,315
        I was calling in        
       my fighter planes,       

1062
01:18:08,317 --> 01:18:13,787
 and there was just a tremendous
  amount of requests coming in  

1063
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:22,562
 for doing this, when suddenly, 
 an 88 or a 105 artillery shell 

1064
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:27,100
     came through an opening    
    in the wall of the castle   

1065
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:31,872
   and exploded about 30 feet   
 from me-- somewhere like that. 

1066
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:34,541
    I was partially shielded    
       from the explosion       

1067
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:38,645
  because there was a column--  
     a stone column-- there,    

1068
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:43,984
 but the explosion took the top 
 of the head off an enlisted man

1069
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:47,487
  who was about 15 feet from me 

1070
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:50,824
        and, it threw...        

1071
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:55,395
     blood, tissue, brains,     
           everything           

1072
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,497
      all over me, my maps.     

1073
01:18:57,499 --> 01:19:03,636
   And I remember at the time   
   it created a lot of havoc,   

1074
01:19:03,638 --> 01:19:07,307
    but I had fighter planes    
    that were in the process    

1075
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:11,311
         of their dive,         
 so I had to keep working there.

1076
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:14,380
      They carried the man      
     who had been killed out    

1077
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:16,716
          and a couple          
     that had been wounded.     

1078
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:20,086
        And then while I        
        was still working       

1079
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:23,256
  calling in the fighter planes 
           on targets,          

1080
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:27,694
   they came over and cleaned   
 the brain tissue out of my hair

1081
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:33,266
and off my leather flight jacket
     and... and off my maps,    

1082
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:37,470
    and we just continued on.   

1083
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:40,373
     (plane engine roaring)     

1084
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:58,291
 (newsreel theme music playing) 

1085
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:20,914
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
    Airborne, the B-29s head    
           for Tokyo.           

1086
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:24,117
   The giant bombers, equipped  
   to range over 5,000 miles,   

1087
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:28,188
      now swiftly cover the     
     1,500 miles from Saipan    

1088
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:29,156
       to their objective,      

1089
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:32,458
to open the full-fledged air war
         against Japan.         

1090
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:37,397
            NARRATOR:           
      Allied planners hoped     
       the kind of bombing      

1091
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:39,733
 that had leveled German cities 

1092
01:20:39,735 --> 01:20:41,668
 would destroy the Japanese will
            to resist           

1093
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,871
      and make unnecessary      
       the bloody invasion      

1094
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:47,474
      that otherwise seemed     
           inevitable.          

1095
01:20:47,476 --> 01:20:52,478
 American B-29s could now reach 
      the enemy's homeland      

1096
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,447
     from Saipan and Tinian,    

1097
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:57,884
       but roughly halfway      
  between them and Japan itself 

1098
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:03,090
  lay a tiny volcanic island--  
            Iwo Jima.           

1099
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:05,892
     It was an otherworldly     
             place--            

1100
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:09,729
barely eight square barren miles
        of rock and ash,        

1101
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:14,368
       reeking of sulfur,       
  without safe drinking water.  

1102
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:18,105
   But it had an airstrip from  
     which Japanese fighters    

1103
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:20,140
 rose to harass American bombers

1104
01:21:20,142 --> 01:21:24,444
    as they flew to and from    
     their mainland targets.    

1105
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:27,614
   American commanders wanted   
        the island taken.       

1106
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:32,819
 Then they could make it a haven
   for their crippled bombers.  

1107
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:43,296
      For 72 straight days,     

1108
01:21:43,298 --> 01:21:45,866
    American bombers pounded    
            Iwo Jima            

1109
01:21:45,868 --> 01:21:52,873
   and its defenders with some  
 6,000 tons of high explosives. 

1110
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:09,222
   Three more days followed of  
 ceaseless shelling by the Navy.

1111
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:29,376
      In the early morning      
      of February 19, 1945,     

1112
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:34,348
       the Marines started      
       toward the island.       

1113
01:22:35,116 --> 01:22:38,384
       Most were veterans       
      of earlier landings--     

1114
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:42,989
    Saipan, Tinian, Peleliu.    

1115
01:23:00,074 --> 01:23:04,710
      The first three waves     
     met little resistance.     

1116
01:23:06,313 --> 01:23:10,149
    Some began to think this    
  invasion would be different,  

1117
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:13,152
 that for once the pre-invasion 
           bombardment          

1118
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:17,757
     really had knocked out     
     the island's defenses.     

1119
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:23,997
           It had not.          

1120
01:23:27,201 --> 01:23:31,004
  Some 21,000 Japanese soldiers 
 were waiting for the Americans 

1121
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:36,810
 inside a virtually impenetrable
 network of tunnels and bunkers.

1122
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:41,248
       As the fourth wave       
        neared the beach,       

1123
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,983
     the enemy opened fire.     

1124
01:23:53,994 --> 01:23:55,862
       (frenzied shouting)      

1125
01:24:11,445 --> 01:24:18,084
      Sergeant Ray Pittman      
      of Mobile was there.      

1126
01:24:22,289 --> 01:24:25,925
            PITTMAN:            
      Going into Iwo Jima,      

1127
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:29,029
      I was a squad leader      
          by that time.         

1128
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:33,533
    (shell whizzes, explodes)   

1129
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:35,735
   And I always looked around   
          and wondered          

1130
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:40,706
        "Now how many men       
      am I going to lose?"      

1131
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:45,411
  Course, we didn't know it was 
   going to be bad as it was.   

1132
01:25:07,167 --> 01:25:11,037
            NARRATOR:           
 Maurice Bell, also from Mobile,

1133
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:17,143
  watched the fighting from the 
  deck of the USS<i> Indianapolis.</i> 

1134
01:25:18,679 --> 01:25:21,113
              BELL:             
         I set up there         
       with my binoculars       

1135
01:25:21,115 --> 01:25:25,218
    and watching the Marines    
         on the island.         

1136
01:25:28,555 --> 01:25:33,659
       And I actually saw       
        tanks going up...       

1137
01:25:34,761 --> 01:25:37,063
    And they would come down    
          to the beach          

1138
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:39,732
     and a bunch of Marines     
   would get behind the tanks,  

1139
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:41,767
 and they would escort them up. 

1140
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:46,406
        And they'd get up       
        to certain points       

1141
01:25:46,408 --> 01:25:49,309
   and jump down in the holes.  

1142
01:25:52,446 --> 01:25:58,951
And the tank would turn, go back
  and escort more on up there.  

1143
01:26:09,396 --> 01:26:15,168
       And one day, I saw,      
     I guess he was a Marine    

1144
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:21,273
    just... short distance up   
         from the beach.        

1145
01:26:21,275 --> 01:26:26,179
   Had his flamethrower going.  
      It was hot that day.      

1146
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:36,455
 And all of a sudden he stopped,
and he turned and he walked back

1147
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:39,125
      to the water, he took     
      the flamethrower off      

1148
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:44,163
 put his clothes all down on top
       of the flamethrower      

1149
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:47,400
      and went swimming...      

1150
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:51,303
  for about 30 or 40 minutes... 

1151
01:26:51,305 --> 01:26:52,838
And he come back and he dressed,

1152
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:57,477
  got his flamethrower and went 
     back to fighting again.    

1153
01:26:58,712 --> 01:27:01,414
 I guess he thought he was going
       to be killed anyway      

1154
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:04,950
  so he might as well enjoy...  
     cool off a little bit.     

1155
01:27:04,952 --> 01:27:08,888
  (newsreel theme music plays)  

1156
01:27:11,591 --> 01:27:16,428
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
     The airfield is taken,     
   and the advance grinds on.   

1157
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:22,301
Japanese are caught in the open.

1158
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:24,237
            (gunfire)           

1159
01:27:27,207 --> 01:27:30,010
 Marines move ahead in a battle 

1160
01:27:30,012 --> 01:27:32,078
  that outranks any ever fought 
         in the Pacific.        

1161
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:38,885
 Iwo Jima, in its first 15 days,
  has cost 2,050 American dead. 

1162
01:27:38,887 --> 01:27:43,356
   And the battle still rages!  

1163
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:05,377
            NARRATOR:           
    The fighting would go on    
       for nearly a month       

1164
01:28:05,379 --> 01:28:08,982
      before the Americans      
        took the island.        

1165
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:27,967
           (shouting)           

1166
01:28:38,478 --> 01:28:41,113
    (rapid gunfire, shelling)   

1167
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:51,657
        The Japanese lost       
     their entire garrison.     

1168
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:57,997
   Once again, they had never   
     intended to surrender.     

1169
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:02,335
    Their mission was to kill   
  as many Americans as possible 

1170
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,971
     before they were killed    
           themselves.          

1171
01:29:11,011 --> 01:29:15,247
     6,821 Americans died--     

1172
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:20,686
  five times the number killed  
    on Guadalcanal or Saipan.   

1173
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:25,491
   Among the dead were Private  
    David Harris of Luverne,    

1174
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:28,861
        Corporal John B.        
      Zwanch of Waterbury,      

1175
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:32,097
      Private Zera Richards     
         of Sacramento,         

1176
01:29:32,099 --> 01:29:36,736
    and Sergeant James Albert   
      Chambliss of Mobile.      

1177
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:43,042
 27 Medals of Honor were awarded
to those who fought on Iwo Jima.

1178
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:48,014
      13 of them had to be      
       given posthumously.      

1179
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:52,018
 So many of the men in one unit 
            were lost           

1180
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:57,056
    that it came to be called   
      the "X-Ray Company."      

1181
01:29:57,058 --> 01:30:00,459
          Of the 16 men         
     in Ray Pittman's squad,    

1182
01:30:00,461 --> 01:30:03,729
         only he and two        
        others were left.       

1183
01:30:06,066 --> 01:30:10,135
            PITTMAN:            
    What I... I went through    
         after the war--        

1184
01:30:10,137 --> 01:30:16,142
           the dreams           
     and everything I had--     

1185
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:17,309
              uh...             

1186
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:22,014
      it would be just like     
         reality to me.         

1187
01:30:35,829 --> 01:30:38,264
           But, uh...           

1188
01:30:38,266 --> 01:30:42,201
     it, uh, it's really...     

1189
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:44,670
   it's really hard to explain  

1190
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:49,441
   just how you feel, because   
     I came home and married    

1191
01:30:49,443 --> 01:30:54,180
 and raised a family and lived a
 real happy life after the war. 

1192
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:59,152
 But so many of them left their 
  blood on the sand on Iwo Jima 

1193
01:30:59,154 --> 01:31:04,791
 and Saipan and Tinian that they
    didn't have that chance.    

1194
01:31:14,501 --> 01:31:19,372
            NARRATOR:           
  With the airstrip on Iwo Jima 
         in their hands,        

1195
01:31:19,374 --> 01:31:23,776
 the Americans were one big step
closer to the Japanese homeland.

1196
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:29,182
 American bombers were now free 
      to attack it at will.     

1197
01:31:29,184 --> 01:31:32,552
 (dramatic newsreel music plays)

1198
01:31:35,755 --> 01:31:38,157
           ANNOUNCER:           
   The new American firebomb,   

1199
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:41,928
     the type that has been     
  devastating Tokyo with flame. 

1200
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:43,495
  This is how it was tried out, 

1201
01:31:43,497 --> 01:31:46,365
         a blazing sweep        
      of jellied gasoline.      

1202
01:31:46,367 --> 01:31:48,567
 That's the incendiary material,

1203
01:31:48,569 --> 01:31:51,270
     a newly developed form     
        of ordinary gas,        

1204
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:57,109
 that gives it a volcanic force 
     of blazing devastation.    

1205
01:31:59,379 --> 01:32:02,815
            NARRATOR:           
 On the night of March 9, 1945, 

1206
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:07,620
        firebombing came        
     to the cities of Japan.    

1207
01:32:11,024 --> 01:32:16,929
       334 American B-29s       
    roared in low over Tokyo    

1208
01:32:16,931 --> 01:32:20,166
           and dropped          
      hundreds of thousands     

1209
01:32:20,168 --> 01:32:23,536
    of 70-pound napalm bombs.   

1210
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:30,809
  16 square miles of the city,  

1211
01:32:30,811 --> 01:32:34,847
          built largely         
  of pine and paper and bamboo, 

1212
01:32:34,849 --> 01:32:38,050
        burst into flame.       

1213
01:32:49,796 --> 01:32:53,466
  Perhaps 100,000 people died.  

1214
01:32:55,102 --> 01:32:58,771
       More than a million      
    were left without homes.    

1215
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:06,546
      In the next ten days,     
      the Americans went on     

1216
01:33:06,548 --> 01:33:10,349
      to hit Nagoya, Osaka,     

1217
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:14,454
       Kobe, Nagoya again.      

1218
01:33:15,388 --> 01:33:20,326
     Some 50,000 more people    
          were killed.          

1219
01:33:21,528 --> 01:33:24,530
         (bomb explodes)        

1220
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:29,001
         GLENN FRAZIER:         
    When the bombing started    
          in our area,          

1221
01:33:29,003 --> 01:33:31,804
       first it was about       
      once every two weeks.     

1222
01:33:31,806 --> 01:33:37,843
 Then it was a raid about every 
    week, then it stepped up.   

1223
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:41,280
  And most of the raids started 
    at night with the B-29s,    

1224
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:44,350
and you could hear the B-29, you
 could distinguish their sound, 

1225
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:47,786
  and all of a sudden you could 
    hear these Zeros up there   

1226
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:51,224
  trying to-- and the gunfire-- 
   trying to shoot them down.   

1227
01:33:51,226 --> 01:33:53,592
   (rapid anti-aircraft fire)   

1228
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:57,396
But we did see some of the fires
     in the distant places.     

1229
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:00,566
   And it was like a ballgame   
             to us.             

1230
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:03,268
 I mean, we were happy about it.

1231
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:06,271
   And they burned out a third  
       of the whole area,       

1232
01:34:06,273 --> 01:34:10,610
    killed over 300-something   
    Japanese right among us.    

1233
01:34:10,612 --> 01:34:14,513
 It burned out our own barracks 
        that we were in.        

1234
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:18,951
 They made rats out of us in the
 Philippines when we were there,

1235
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:24,857
     and our B-29s made rats    
      out of them in Japan.     

1236
01:34:29,963 --> 01:34:35,568
   And we knew that Americans   
      were getting closer.      

1237
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:37,470
      But they also told us     

1238
01:34:37,472 --> 01:34:42,175
      that if any American      
      landed on their soil,     

1239
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:44,810
   that we would all be shot--  
           the POWs--           

1240
01:34:44,812 --> 01:34:48,847
 that all guards had the ability
          to shoot you.         

1241
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:56,789
            NARRATOR:           
    American B-29s continued    
  to fire-bomb Japanese cities, 

1242
01:34:56,791 --> 01:35:00,226
     eventually forcing more    
    than eight million people   

1243
01:35:00,228 --> 01:35:02,928
        from their homes.       

1244
01:35:05,899 --> 01:35:10,002
 The Fifth Air Force printed up 
  a pamphlet to reassure pilots 

1245
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:15,174
   who might have felt uneasy   
about killing so many civilians.

1246
01:35:16,076 --> 01:35:18,210
     "The entire population     

1247
01:35:18,212 --> 01:35:20,479
 was a proper military target," 
            it said,            

1248
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:24,784
 "since the Japanese government 
  had ordered all men and women 

1249
01:35:24,786 --> 01:35:29,755
          to enlist in          
   a volunteer defense corps."  

1250
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,361
            "For us,"           
     the pamphlet continued,    

1251
01:35:35,363 --> 01:35:38,830
    "there are no civilians."   

1252
01:35:43,837 --> 01:35:45,238
      (train whistle blows)     

1253
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:49,375
        ("Taxi War Dance"       
      by Count Basie plays)     

1254
01:35:56,582 --> 01:36:00,620
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
        I volunteered for       
     the Red Cross canteen,     

1255
01:36:00,622 --> 01:36:03,723
         which was down         
    at the railroad station.    

1256
01:36:03,725 --> 01:36:10,028
  We served the boys that came  
     through on the trains.     

1257
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:14,400
And over our head we would carry
      a tray of sandwiches      

1258
01:36:14,402 --> 01:36:17,203
  and another girl would carry  
       a tray of doughnuts      

1259
01:36:17,205 --> 01:36:20,739
  and another girl would carry  
     the two jugs of coffee     

1260
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:23,509
        and a fourth girl       
      would carry the cups.     

1261
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:28,314
Well, we got word one night that
    this troop train was due,   

1262
01:36:28,316 --> 01:36:33,919
  so we got our equipment ready 
        and out we went.        

1263
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:38,524
  And we started walking along  
 by the side of the troop train 

1264
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:43,429
      and all of a sudden,      
     the worst whoop went up    

1265
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:49,134
    and these Marines started   
 pouring out of the troop train.

1266
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:52,771
   Well, I threw my sandwiches  
       and started to run.      

1267
01:36:52,773 --> 01:36:55,741
 And the girl with the doughnuts
      threw her doughnuts.      

1268
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:58,877
     But the poor girl with     
     the coffee was caught.     

1269
01:36:58,879 --> 01:37:01,280
      Well, these Marines,      
          we found out,         

1270
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:03,649
       had just come back       
         from Iwo Jima.         

1271
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:10,055
  They had been put on the ship 
 and disembarked in New Orleans 

1272
01:37:10,057 --> 01:37:12,758
      and were on their way     
        to Parris Island.       

1273
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:16,362
    So we were the first real   
         American girls         

1274
01:37:16,364 --> 01:37:18,531
 they had come in contact with. 

1275
01:37:18,533 --> 01:37:20,732
    And they were determined    
           to kiss us.          

1276
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:26,472
  So we ran as hard as we could 
        into the canteen,       

1277
01:37:26,474 --> 01:37:29,708
        slammed the door,       
    got under the counter...    

1278
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:32,344
         locked the door        
    and got under the counter   

1279
01:37:32,346 --> 01:37:34,079
  and just sat there trembling. 

1280
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:37,616
 Well, their officers came off, 
      and the shore patrol,     

1281
01:37:37,618 --> 01:37:43,122
  and they finally got them all 
 together and back on the train.

1282
01:37:43,124 --> 01:37:44,490
    And we just stayed there    

1283
01:37:44,492 --> 01:37:46,658
    till the train moved out    
         of the station.        

1284
01:37:46,660 --> 01:37:51,096
   But when we went home that   
    night, my friend whose...   

1285
01:37:51,098 --> 01:37:54,599
  who was carrying the coffee-- 
      her name was Polly--      

1286
01:37:54,601 --> 01:37:56,435
 Polly's mother asked her, said,

1287
01:37:56,437 --> 01:38:00,139
     "Well, Polly, what did     
     you girls do tonight?"     

1288
01:38:00,141 --> 01:38:02,841
         And Polly said,        
       "Oh, nothing, Mama,      

1289
01:38:02,843 --> 01:38:04,643
  it was just a regular night." 

1290
01:38:04,645 --> 01:38:08,080
   She said, "How did you get   
     those black handprints     

1291
01:38:08,082 --> 01:38:09,515
      all over your coat?"      

1292
01:38:09,517 --> 01:38:13,018
           (laughing):          
     So, we had to tell her     

1293
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:16,221
      that Polly was kissed     
   I don't know how many times  

1294
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:20,725
    before she could get away   
    and get into the canteen.   

1295
01:38:20,727 --> 01:38:24,964
  But her mother was not upset, 
 she just laughed and she said, 

1296
01:38:24,966 --> 01:38:28,200
  "Well, you girls can go back  
      next Saturday night.      

1297
01:38:28,202 --> 01:38:31,570
            You know,           
    you're doing a good job."   

1298
01:38:33,974 --> 01:38:34,440
              Fire!             

1299
01:38:42,449 --> 01:38:47,219
        ("Sheik of Araby"       
     by Benny Goodman plays)    

1300
01:38:51,891 --> 01:38:56,729
          PAUL FUSSELL:         
    The German army had been    
      beaten up very badly,     

1301
01:38:56,731 --> 01:39:03,068
     and not just in France,    
  but other places they'd been. 

1302
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:07,072
    Also, Russia was beating    
      the hell out of them      

1303
01:39:07,074 --> 01:39:10,308
     in the other direction.    

1304
01:39:11,678 --> 01:39:13,579
     It wasn't child's play     
          beating them,         

1305
01:39:13,581 --> 01:39:17,315
   but it was clear they were   
      going to be defeated.     

1306
01:39:17,317 --> 01:39:19,451
                           Fire!

1307
01:39:22,522 --> 01:39:24,022
      So we really had them     
           in the bag.          

1308
01:39:24,024 --> 01:39:27,926
   And at that moment, I knew   
 we were going to win this war. 

1309
01:39:27,928 --> 01:39:31,330
  As soon as the ice goes away  
     and spring comes again,    

1310
01:39:31,332 --> 01:39:35,534
     we get on the attacking    
      frame of mind again,      

1311
01:39:35,536 --> 01:39:39,338
       we're going to win.      

1312
01:39:49,716 --> 01:39:52,317
            NARRATOR:           
  By the middle of March 1945,  

1313
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:54,553
      hundreds of thousands     
          of Americans          

1314
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:56,188
     were crossing the Rhine    

1315
01:39:56,190 --> 01:40:00,392
   and driving into the heart   
        of Nazi Germany.        

1316
01:40:08,768 --> 01:40:10,702
       When George Patton       
       and his Third Army       

1317
01:40:10,704 --> 01:40:12,471
 began to cross near Frankfurt, 

1318
01:40:12,473 --> 01:40:16,542
   the general stopped halfway  
   across the pontoon bridge.   

1319
01:40:16,544 --> 01:40:20,112
      He'd always wanted to     
  "piss in the Rhine," he said, 

1320
01:40:20,114 --> 01:40:24,816
  and in full view of his men,  
             he did.            

1321
01:40:38,431 --> 01:40:40,065
       Then Patton learned      
      that his son-in-law,      

1322
01:40:40,067 --> 01:40:43,034
    who had been captured in    
 North Africa two years earlier,

1323
01:40:43,036 --> 01:40:47,606
   was being held in a German   
    POW camp near Hammelburg.   

1324
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:51,443
      It was some 40 miles      
    behind the German lines,    

1325
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:53,979
     but Patton didn't care.    

1326
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:56,181
          He dispatched         
     a special task force--     

1327
01:40:56,183 --> 01:41:01,353
    16 tanks, 27 half-tracks,   
          and 300 men--         

1328
01:41:01,355 --> 01:41:06,124
 to free his daughter's husband 
           right away.          

1329
01:41:07,794 --> 01:41:11,129
   Meanwhile, at the POW camp,  

1330
01:41:11,131 --> 01:41:15,133
the prisoners had heard that the
 Americans had crossed the Rhine

1331
01:41:15,135 --> 01:41:18,470
    and believed that it was    
      only a matter of time     

1332
01:41:18,472 --> 01:41:20,672
 before they would be liberated.

1333
01:41:20,674 --> 01:41:24,276
   Tom Galloway, who had been   
       forced to surrender      

1334
01:41:24,278 --> 01:41:28,180
   early in the Battle of the   
 Bulge, was among the prisoners.

1335
01:41:28,182 --> 01:41:32,284
            GALLOWAY:           
But you couldn't get too excited
         about anything,        

1336
01:41:32,286 --> 01:41:34,320
      you were too hungry.      

1337
01:41:34,322 --> 01:41:39,358
    Hunger was just foremost    
       in everybody's mind      

1338
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,927
    when you just stay hungry   
          all the time.         

1339
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:48,734
 I probably lost about 50 pounds
      in just a few months.     

1340
01:41:48,736 --> 01:41:53,505
          HERNDON INGE:         
     Well, you're just cold     
          all the time.         

1341
01:41:53,507 --> 01:41:57,543
   I went three months without  
   ever taking my clothes off.  

1342
01:41:57,545 --> 01:42:00,112
 You just stayed in your clothes
         24 hours a day.        

1343
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:02,948
 You, you took your boots off-- 
         we had boots--         

1344
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:07,786
       and you'd tie them       
      to your bunk at night     

1345
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:13,726
            NARRATOR:           
 Second Lieutenant Herndon Inge 
      was also from Mobile.     

1346
01:42:13,728 --> 01:42:16,962
   He, too, had been captured   
          at the Bulge.         

1347
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:18,897
              INGE:             
    When I was at Hammelburg,   

1348
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:21,967
     I heard that there was     
    a prisoner in another hut   

1349
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:25,371
          from Alabama,         
       so I looked him up.      

1350
01:42:25,373 --> 01:42:29,908
 A skinny, dirty fellow came up 
to me and wanted to know if I...

1351
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:31,810
        he said he heard        
        I was from Mobile       

1352
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:39,484
 and it turns out it was Herndon
   Inge, whom we call "Wanky."  

1353
01:42:39,486 --> 01:42:40,786
    And he and I were raised    

1354
01:42:40,788 --> 01:42:43,721
   probably about eight blocks  
        from each other.        

1355
01:42:43,723 --> 01:42:47,025
     And he knew my brothers    
          and sisters,          

1356
01:42:47,027 --> 01:42:50,562
   and we've been fast friends  
           ever since.          

1357
01:42:50,564 --> 01:42:58,437
            NARRATOR:           
On March 27, Patton's task force
    reached the prison camp.    

1358
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:03,175
            (gunfire)           

1359
01:43:06,579 --> 01:43:10,749
              INGE:             
     Everybody was cheering     
   and jubilant over the fact   

1360
01:43:10,751 --> 01:43:16,255
   that at last we were going   
    to be taken to good food.   

1361
01:43:18,091 --> 01:43:21,093
           (cheering)           

1362
01:43:25,598 --> 01:43:29,534
            NARRATOR:           
 Then someone started shooting. 

1363
01:43:30,903 --> 01:43:35,374
   In the confusion, Patton's   
 son-in-law was hit by a bullet 

1364
01:43:35,376 --> 01:43:37,976
and rushed to the camp hospital,

1365
01:43:37,978 --> 01:43:40,845
        too badly wounded       
        to be liberated.        

1366
01:43:45,818 --> 01:43:51,257
            GALLOWAY:           
         Then they said,        
   "We're going to move out."   

1367
01:43:51,259 --> 01:43:55,127
 They said, "If you want to go, 
          you can go,"          

1368
01:43:55,129 --> 01:44:00,532
 but some went back into prison 
       and some took off.       

1369
01:44:00,534 --> 01:44:03,502
          I took off--          
  two... two others and myself. 

1370
01:44:03,504 --> 01:44:08,540
            NARRATOR:           
    More than 1,200 Americans   
      ran out of the camp,      

1371
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:13,878
   but there were only enough   
     vehicles to carry 250.     

1372
01:44:14,747 --> 01:44:20,118
      Thousands of Germans      
    quickly surrounded them.    

1373
01:44:22,055 --> 01:44:24,523
         (rapid gunfire)        

1374
01:44:24,525 --> 01:44:26,859
 The freed prisoners scattered. 

1375
01:44:26,861 --> 01:44:32,764
  Most, including Herndon Inge, 
   were recaptured right away.  

1376
01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:37,169
  But Tom Galloway and his two  
  buddies had managed to escape 

1377
01:44:37,171 --> 01:44:43,242
   and were trying to make it   
 to the American lines on foot. 

1378
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:48,147
            GALLOWAY:           
We had passed a, uh... farmhouse

1379
01:44:48,149 --> 01:44:51,850
     with barns, outbuilding    
       and a small chapel.      

1380
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:53,919
         So I told them,        
      and I said, "Look"...     

1381
01:44:53,921 --> 01:44:57,322
         And by the way,        
       it was Good Friday,      

1382
01:44:57,324 --> 01:44:58,590
      Friday before Easter.     

1383
01:44:58,592 --> 01:45:02,828
    And I said, "This is..."    
    in that part of Germany,    

1384
01:45:02,830 --> 01:45:04,863
  Bavaria was mostly Catholic.  

1385
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:07,966
        A matter of fact,       
 I thought it was all Catholic. 

1386
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:11,303
          I told them,          
      "3:00 on Good Friday,     

1387
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:15,340
 "they're going to be in church 
 and we're going to go in there 

1388
01:45:15,342 --> 01:45:18,711
      "and get in that barn     
     that we saw last night     

1389
01:45:18,713 --> 01:45:25,150
 Well, we broke across the field
   just as fast as we could go  

1390
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:27,753
      and ran in that barn.     

1391
01:45:27,755 --> 01:45:30,789
       And I think we hit       
   the only Protestant family   

1392
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:32,257
    in that part of Bavaria.    

1393
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:33,725
   They were all in the barn.   

1394
01:45:33,727 --> 01:45:37,763
  So, that... our luck ran out  
         at that point.         

1395
01:45:37,765 --> 01:45:44,135
            NARRATOR:           
  Soon, Tom Galloway, too, was  
    back behind barbed wire.    

1396
01:45:44,137 --> 01:45:50,409
 He and Herndon Inge would have 
 to wait to be freed once again.

1397
01:45:55,380 --> 01:45:59,116
           (footsteps)

            NARRATOR:           
    By the end of March 1945,   

1412
01:46:56,209 --> 01:47:01,878
  American forces were steadily 
 gathering for their next target

1413
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:08,085
   the big, densely populated   
       island of Okinawa.       

1414
01:47:08,853 --> 01:47:13,257
   The British had taken back   
       Mandalay in Burma.       

1415
01:47:13,259 --> 01:47:17,461
    The Russians were within    
       50 miles of Berlin.      

1416
01:47:17,463 --> 01:47:22,499
 But Hitler continued to exhort 
      his people to resist,     

1417
01:47:22,501 --> 01:47:26,770
and the militarists who governed
     Japan were calling upon    

1418
01:47:26,772 --> 01:47:31,274
   every man, woman and child   
      to fight to the death     

1419
01:47:31,276 --> 01:47:35,512
  against the American invasion 
      they knew was coming.

     McINTOSH (dramatized):     
       "Today started off       
       with a big mistake

 "caused by an over-enthusiastic
        radio broadcaster

"was coming up in a few minutes.

      "it didn't cause much     
   of a flurry on Main Street.

"People have had tentative dates
       for victory before

         "and have seen         
       their hopes dashed,

 is no doubt of victory anymore.

  "They are praying and hoping  
       that the struggle,       

1437

   will be mercifully short."

01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:13,309
            NARRATOR:           
  Among the men who had landed  
           on Iwo Jima          

1441
01:49:13,311 --> 01:49:18,781
   were Bill Lansford and Pete  
 Arias, Marines from California 

1442
01:49:18,783 --> 01:49:24,153
      who had been fighting     
   in the Pacific since 1942.   

1443
01:49:24,155 --> 01:49:29,258
     Their guerrilla outfit,    
       Carlson's Raiders,       

1444
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:31,994
 The hit-and-run jungle tactics 
         they'd mastered        

1445
01:49:31,996 --> 01:49:39,601
 at Guadalcanal and Bougainville
 no longer applied on Iwo Jima. 

1446
01:49:43,673 --> 01:49:48,544
            LANSFORD:           
 When we landed, the first thing
that I saw as the ramp went down

1447
01:49:48,546 --> 01:49:55,450
  was a whole bunch of wounded  
     guys coming towards us.    

1448
01:49:55,452 --> 01:49:59,154
    People were carrying them   
    and they were all bloody,   

1449
01:49:59,156 --> 01:50:01,223
      and I said, "Uh-oh."      

1450
01:50:07,831 --> 01:50:12,701
     The noise was intense,     
 and it was really demoralizing.

1451
01:50:12,703 --> 01:50:15,704
     It was the worst thing     
     I had ever experienced.    

1452
01:50:15,706 --> 01:50:17,739
    And I thought, you know,    
           I thought,           

1453
01:50:17,741 --> 01:50:19,041
   "Something's wrong with me.  

1454
01:50:19,043 --> 01:50:23,679
 I don't know if I'm going to be
   able to make this or not."   

1455
01:50:25,381 --> 01:50:28,817
      And there were kids,      
      you know, digging in,     

1456
01:50:28,819 --> 01:50:32,354
        trying to dig in        
      under the artillery,      

1457
01:50:32,356 --> 01:50:35,057
        and the poor kids       
     didn't know any better.    

1458
01:50:35,059 --> 01:50:39,161
    Those of us who had been    
  through two or three battles  

1459
01:50:39,163 --> 01:50:40,663
     literally grabbed them     
           by the neck          

1460
01:50:40,665 --> 01:50:45,468
   and kicked them and saying,  
 "Move, move, get out of here!" 

1461
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:48,604
       because the shells       
    were right on top of us.    

1462
01:50:49,973 --> 01:50:52,374
      I thought I was going     
        to lose my mind.        

1463
01:50:52,376 --> 01:50:56,011
  And I thought, gee, I've been 
 in this too damn long already. 

1464
01:50:56,013 --> 01:50:58,647
  I... I can't take it anymore. 

1465
01:51:00,717 --> 01:51:05,955
            NARRATOR:           
Meanwhile, Pete Arias's unit had
 been stopped by relentless fire

1466
01:51:05,957 --> 01:51:08,558
    from a Japanese pillbox.    

1467
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:11,627
             ARIAS:             
       So I told this guy       
     named Danford, I said,     

1468
01:51:11,629 --> 01:51:14,930
      "Hey, Dan, let's see      
   what we can do about this."  

1469
01:51:14,932 --> 01:51:16,399
     So we crawled up there     

1470
01:51:16,401 --> 01:51:20,302
       to that place where      
     they was holding us up     

1471
01:51:20,304 --> 01:51:21,903
       and we took it out.      

1472
01:51:26,342 --> 01:51:32,247
 Then on the way back, you know,
      I got hit in the leg.     

1473
01:51:33,816 --> 01:51:38,687
   And Danford, he got killed   
    right there coming back.    

1474
01:51:39,890 --> 01:51:42,758
    Pretty soon this corpsman   
        came over there.        

1475
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:45,361
   He wasn't from our outfit.   

1476
01:51:47,063 --> 01:51:49,865
    He says, "You been taken    
        care of, Sarge?"        

1477
01:51:49,867 --> 01:51:51,367
     I says, "I don't know."    

1478
01:51:51,369 --> 01:51:52,568
 He said, "Let me look at you." 

1479
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:56,372
   So he... so I had to get up  
     and I laid down there,     

1480
01:51:56,374 --> 01:51:58,307
  He gave me a shot of morphine 
       and all that stuff       

1481
01:51:58,309 --> 01:52:01,377
   and, uh, I know he couldn't  
         bandage this up        

1482
01:52:01,379 --> 01:52:06,081
   because I was... I got big   
   wounds all over the place.   

1483
01:52:06,083 --> 01:52:08,550
  Then I heard this one coming. 

1484
01:52:08,552 --> 01:52:12,154
        (huge explosion)        

1485
01:52:12,156 --> 01:52:18,027
            NARRATOR:           
 The corpsman had thrown himself
   over Arias to protect him.   

1486
01:52:18,029 --> 01:52:22,464
             ARIAS:             
     This poor guy, he took     
    the full blast, you know,   

1487
01:52:22,466 --> 01:52:26,168
and that killed him right there.

1488
01:52:26,170 --> 01:52:29,571
You know, I always remember him.

1489
01:52:29,573 --> 01:52:33,242
I wonder who in the hell he was.

1490
01:52:55,231 --> 01:52:59,835
            NARRATOR:           
     Both Arias and Lansford    
     would survive Iwo Jima     

1491
01:52:59,837 --> 01:53:03,538
    and eventually get to go    
           back home.           

1492
01:53:03,540 --> 01:53:06,441
            LANSFORD:           
       The greatest sense       
    that I had about the war    

1493
01:53:06,443 --> 01:53:09,078
  was a sense of satisfaction,  

1494
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:11,413
      and a sense of relief     
        that it was over        

1495
01:53:11,415 --> 01:53:14,983
   and we wouldn't have to do   
    any of that stuff again.    

1496
01:53:14,985 --> 01:53:20,622
    But I also had a sense of   
 kinship with all the other guys

1497
01:53:20,624 --> 01:53:21,824
  who had been in the service.  

1498
01:53:21,826 --> 01:53:26,528
      Somehow we had become     
        a separate entity       

1499
01:53:26,530 --> 01:53:30,433
         from the people        
       who were civilians.      

1500
01:53:30,435 --> 01:53:35,871
 Our feeling was that, you know,
   we were like our own gang.   

1501
01:53:35,873 --> 01:53:39,975
         We had all done        
    what we were told to do,    

1502
01:53:39,977 --> 01:53:43,879
    and most of us, you know,   
  were characterized as heroes, 

1503
01:53:43,881 --> 01:53:46,782
     but we weren't heroes.     

1504
01:53:46,784 --> 01:53:49,017
We were just guys who were there

1505
01:53:49,019 --> 01:53:52,621
           and we did           
  what we were supposed to do.
