00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:40,087
NARRATOR: By the late summer
of 1943,

2
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:43,716
the United States had been at war
for more than 20 months.

3
00:00:46,887 --> 00:00:48,647
Its factories and shipyards

4
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:52,481
were now performing miracles of
manufacturing around the clock.

5
00:00:56,927 --> 00:01:00,327
But its armed forces
were still far from ready

6
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:04,320
to mount an assault on the Germans
occupying western Europe.

7
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,367
Meanwhile, along a thousand-mile front,

8
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:14,918
the Soviets were struggling
to hurl the Nazis from their soil.

9
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:22,647
The Americans and British
did what they could

10
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:24,956
to help relieve the pressure
on the Russians.

11
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:36,527
American airmen, including Earl Burke
of Sacramento, California,

12
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:39,767
would be called upon
to defy preposterous odds

13
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:43,601
and begin to bring the war
to the heart of Germany itself.

14
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,367
While Private 'Babe' Ciarlo,

15
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:50,607
an Italian immigrant's son
from Waterbury, Connecticut,

16
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:55,247
would find himself battling foul weather,
hostile terrain

17
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:57,687
and fierce enemy resistance

18
00:01:57,687 --> 00:02:00,884
to liberate the land
where his parents had been born.

19
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:24,487
SAM HYNES:
Dying is different for pilots,

20
00:02:24,487 --> 00:02:26,318
for aviation personnel.

21
00:02:27,927 --> 00:02:31,527
On the ground, in the infantry,
there's a corpse.

22
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:34,807
It might be blown apart,
but there's a foot

23
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:36,407
or an arm or something.

24
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,127
And it's very close.

25
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:42,887
In aviation, the planes tend
to go away and not come back.

26
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:47,927
Even if someone dies
in the air with you

27
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:52,127
the plane explodes,
it falls to the ground

28
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:54,004
at a place you'll never see.

29
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:02,165
I had a number of friends
killed during the war...

30
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:06,799
...but I never saw
any of their bodies.

31
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:28,247
EARL BURKE:
The war came home to my family

32
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:30,238
on a very gut level.

33
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:36,687
Uh, my Uncle Earl,

34
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:40,487
who lived in Sacramento
called me one night and said,

35
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,727
"I want you to come over
to my house."

36
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:45,967
He was only a couple blocks
away, so I went over there.

37
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:49,407
And he showed me an article
in the newspaper that said

38
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:51,477
there was a crash
in Puerto Rico.

39
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:59,407
And my only brother I had,
older brother,

40
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:03,798
was listed as killed
in an airplane accident.

41
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:10,527
And we tried for 12 hours
on the telephone to try to get

42
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:14,600
to Puerto Rico to confirm that
this was, indeed, my brother.

43
00:04:16,247 --> 00:04:18,007
And finally, somebody says,

44
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:22,364
"Yes, it was a Tom Burke
from Sacramento."

45
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:27,807
Well, five days later,
we got the telegram

46
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:30,879
telling that he had been killed.

47
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:36,879
So that's how my war came to us.

48
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:49,927
And there was no talking

49
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:52,607
about what had happened.

50
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,927
My parents were very stoic.

51
00:04:55,927 --> 00:05:00,927
And I only heard
my mother cry once.

52
00:05:00,927 --> 00:05:05,087
It was in her bedroom, since she
never cried in front of me.

53
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:09,567
So it was a tough thing
for those two people.

54
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:12,087
For me, I lost a brother.

55
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:13,566
"Yeah, damn it.

56
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:18,282
"We gonna do something about it."

57
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:24,167
Then I got the crazy idea
that I was going to enlist

58
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:28,524
and win the war.
(Chuckles)

59
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,927
It was kind of for Tommy...

60
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:35,927
in a way.

61
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:38,247
Not so consciously.

62
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:41,087
I didn't say,
"This is for you, Tom."

63
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:44,207
No, I never did that.

64
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:47,927
But, uh, I enlisted.

65
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:50,047
I'm glad I did.

(BENNY GOODMAN'S
'ON THE ALAMO' PLAYS)

67
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:01,247
NARRATOR:
Earl Burke joined the army

68
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:04,727
and trained first
at Fort Lewis in Seattle

69
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:08,727
where, he remembered, he learned
"how to pick up cigarette butts,

70
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:10,927
"paint anything that didn't move

71
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:13,407
"and salute anything that did".

72
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:16,167
Like his late brother,

73
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,527
he wanted to take part
in the air war.

74
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:23,527
After serving at a base
outside Reno, Nevada,

75
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:26,927
where he loaded bombs
onto heavy bombers,

76
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:30,767
he was sent across the country
to Camp Shanks, New Jersey,

77
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:34,207
and then on June 1, 1943,

78
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:37,327
boarded the 'Queen Mary',

79
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:40,847
part of the seemingly
endless stream of Gls now headed

80
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:43,998
for England to prepare
for the invasion of France.

81
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:57,247
Soon after he got there,
he happened upon

82
00:06:57,247 --> 00:06:59,727
two old friends from Sacramento,

83
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:03,727
twin brothers named
Richard and Robert Egger.

84
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:07,207
BURKE: I was in
a Red Cross hut on a base.

85
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:10,527
It was kind of
a PX type of thing.

86
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:13,567
So as we were drinking the beer
and all that,

87
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,087
having a good time, they said,

88
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:18,247
"Well, why don't you
get with us?"

89
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:24,567
They were tail and ball turret
gunners on a B-17.

90
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:27,567
It sounded like fun.

91
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:29,407
What the heck, you know?

92
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,567
I was 19.
I could've had a lot of fun.

93
00:07:32,567 --> 00:07:34,447
They seemed to be having
a lot of fun.

94
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:35,926
They were not scared at all.

95
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:40,007
So I says, "OK,"
so the next day I went down

96
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:42,927
and got an application
and filled out the application.

97
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:46,927
And at that time, they were
losing a lot of bombers.

98
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:49,567
They were losing 60 at a time.

99
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:53,727
They were losing
over 600 men in a raid.

100
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,407
So they were taking anybody.

101
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:57,087
They were taking cooks.

102
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,567
They were taking truck drivers,

103
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:02,957
mechanics - anybody that could
get into an airplane.

104
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:08,727
Nothing was going
to happen to me - no way.

105
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:12,163
I'm 19 years old.
I'm gonna conquer this world.

106
00:08:13,647 --> 00:08:17,526
Nothing was going to happen
to me, you know... no.

107
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:28,727
NARRATOR: Until the Allies
were able to launch

108
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:31,047
their long-planned
invasion of Europe,

109
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:33,687
the only way to weaken
German power

110
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:36,645
on the Continent
was from the air.

111
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:43,167
Since bombing during the day
attracted anti-aircraft fire

112
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,567
and swarms of German fighters,

113
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,327
the British preferred
to fly their missions

114
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,397
at night.

115
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,487
But when aerial surveys showed

116
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:59,447
that only one in five
British bombs had fallen

117
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:03,007
within five miles of its
intended industrial target,

118
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:05,527
their policy shifted

119
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:08,405
to what was called
area bombing.

120
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:13,967
Relentless night-time raids
on German cities,

121
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,687
intended to destroy
not only factories,

122
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:18,687
but whole neighbourhoods

123
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:21,759
and "break the spirit
of the people".

124
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:33,727
While the British continued
to bomb German cities at night,

125
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:38,287
the Americans decided to take on
the much more dangerous task

126
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,882
of bombing defence industries
by day.

127
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,727
The Americans believed
the B-17 -

128
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,487
their big, 4-engine bomber -

129
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:59,763
superior to anything else
their Allies or the enemy had.

130
00:10:01,647 --> 00:10:04,207
It was called
the Flying Fortress,

131
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:07,687
because it was armed
with as many as nine

132
00:10:07,687 --> 00:10:09,207
.50-calibre machine guns,

133
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:12,127
and each plane was fitted out

134
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:14,607
with the revolutionary
Norden bombsight,

135
00:10:14,607 --> 00:10:17,007
said to be so accurate

136
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:20,727
it made it possible to
"drop a bomb in a pickle barrel

137
00:10:20,727 --> 00:10:22,797
"from 20,000 feet".

138
00:10:33,247 --> 00:10:37,525
Around-the-clock bombing
took a fearful toll.

139
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:41,367
In late July, British bombs

140
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:44,847
set off a whirling firestorm
that burned

141
00:10:44,847 --> 00:10:47,447
or asphyxiated at least
40,000 German civilians

142
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:50,727
in and around Hamburg,

143
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:54,727
taking almost as many lives
in one week

144
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:57,287
as the German Luftwaffe
had taken

145
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,960
in eight months
of bombing Britain.

146
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:06,007
But the German will to resist

147
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:09,967
only intensified,
just as the will of Londoners

148
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:12,887
had intensified
during the Blitz.

149
00:11:12,887 --> 00:11:15,327
Hamburg's factories

150
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,000
were soon back in business.

151
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:24,287
Meanwhile, American airmen

152
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,407
were suffering terrible losses.

153
00:11:26,407 --> 00:11:29,127
MAN: Keep your eyes open.
MAN 2: Three planes, 9:00.

the Egger twins,

would both be shot down

BURKE: The number of missions
that you had to fly

161

before you were returned
to the States

162
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,087
and/or given a non-combat job

163
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:07,527
was 25 at that point.

164
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:11,727
The average number of missions

00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:15,927
flown in 1943
for a combat person

166
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:18,287
was only 14.

167
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:22,678
If you got to 14,
you were usually dead.

168
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:26,727
NARRATOR:
Earl Burke was now a member

169
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:29,927
of the 854th Chemical Warfare
Company,

170
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:32,567
part of the 384th Bomb Group

171
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:36,567
in the US Army's
Eighth Air Force.

172
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:40,127
On September 16, 1943,

173
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,327
he clambered
into the ball turret

174
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:44,397
for the first time.

175
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:49,927
Their target was the German
submarine facilities at Nantes,

176
00:12:49,927 --> 00:12:51,565
on the French coast.

177
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,202
BURKE: The ball turret
is underneath the aircraft.

178
00:12:59,087 --> 00:13:04,567
You put your knees up against
your ears... almost.

179
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,927
Almost like a foetal position,

180
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:09,567
'cause you're up in there jammed
in that little thing,

181
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,367
and you got
these horrendous guns

182
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:12,846
in front of you, two of 'em.

183
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:17,796
Didn't pass my mind that I was
getting into trouble...

184
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,760
...till the first mission.

185
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:36,727
We're flying about 28,000 feet.

186
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:39,567
And, uh, the first time
I tried my turret

187
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:43,727
to see whether I could fire,
you know, possibly, uh...

188
00:13:43,727 --> 00:13:47,087
do a reasonable job
of tracking a fighter plane,

189
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,847
I didn't know my right foot
from my left foot.

190
00:13:49,847 --> 00:13:51,927
I thought I wanted
the gun to go that way,

191
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:55,087
and I'd press up my right foot,
it'd go that way.

192
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:57,247
And I didn't know
where it was going.

193
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:59,047
I was so scared.

194
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,164
I didn't know what I was doing.

195
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:06,607
And pretty soon,

196
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:09,927
you know, before we got
to the bombing area,

197
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:12,527
and the fighters
started to come out,

198
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:16,527
uh, I learned my right foot
from my left foot.

199

NARRATOR: Earl Burke
survived his first mission.

202
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:48,127
The raid and others like it

203
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:51,119
reduced French coastal towns
to rubble.

204
00:14:52,727 --> 00:14:58,567
"Not a dog or a cat survived
in them," a German officer said,

205
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,527
but the concrete
submarine pens that had been

206
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:05,327
the Americans' target
remained intact.

207
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:09,087
BURKE: Well, the accuracy
of our bombing

208
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,679
left much to be desired.

209
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:16,527
They said you could drop a bomb
into a pickle barrel.

210
00:15:16,527 --> 00:15:19,727
We couldn't drop
a bomb in France

211
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:23,567
that hit anything, any target,
in the beginning.

212
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:25,087
We just couldn't hit 'em.

NARRATOR:
In August,

214
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:33,207
376 B-17 s had conducted
a massive raid on Schweinfurt

215
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:36,607
and Regensburg, Germany,
hoping to smash

216
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:39,527
the heavily-defended factories
that supplied ball bearings

217
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:41,367
to the Nazi war machine.

222
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,556
600 crewmen were lost.

223
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,487
The battered factories
were again

224
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:28,287
back working round the clock.

225
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,007
And so the Allied command

226
00:16:31,007 --> 00:16:34,716
ordered a second strike
on Schweinfurt for October 14.

227
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:41,287
BURKE: We were briefed
that we were going to Schweinfurt.

228
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:43,447
And you could have heard all

229
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:47,447
the people groan
and moan... swear.

230
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:50,519
Nobody wanted to go
back to Schweinfurt.

BURKE: You were getting ready to go.

233
00:17:01,167 --> 00:17:04,167
Those were the times you were
more nervous and scared

234
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,847
to get into that airplane.

235
00:17:05,847 --> 00:17:10,367
You did not want to get
into that airplane.

236
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,647
But you did anyway.

237
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:16,847
You got in the airplane
because your friends were

238
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:19,600
getting in the aircraft.

239
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:24,447
You didn't want to let
your friends down.

240
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:27,647
Even though, you know...

241
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,286

took off into the fog
and headed for Schweinfurt.

244
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:53,167
Fighter escorts shielded them
across Belgium,

245
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:56,000
then turned back
before their fuel ran out.

246
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:02,247
Within minutes,
hundreds of German fighters

247
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,527
rose up to meet them.

They came in 10 abreast.

250
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,167
You see these
little things wink.

251
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,247
And, as they wink,
you know what's coming.

252
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:27,447
You're talking about
a quarter pound of lead

253
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:30,166
each time you saw
one of those winks.

254
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:48,047
Then they would stay off
a fair thousand yards,

255
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:49,958
and they would lob...
Iob rockets at you.

256
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:52,967
You couldn't reach them

257
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:56,727
because your.50-calibre
machine gun couldn't touch them.

258
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,807
That's why we needed

259
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:00,320
the fighter escorts.

260
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:08,637

And, uh, hope that
he flies into it.

265
00:19:23,647 --> 00:19:28,847
And I was up there flying two
.50-calibre machine guns.

266
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:32,317
Shooting rounds of shells about
half an inch in diameter.

00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:12,687
the German fighters withdrew,

273
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:16,967

for yet another terror -

Plexiglas on my right-hand side
exploded.

00:21:05,687 --> 00:21:08,527
My left-hand side exploded.

284
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:12,367
And a 20-millimetre shell had
come up through my turret,

285
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:15,207
hitting me in the left arm.

286
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:19,007
Not breaking the arm,
but smashing the bone...

287
00:21:19,007 --> 00:21:21,207
tearing my jacket off,

288
00:21:21,207 --> 00:21:25,487
and went up
into the waist window

289
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:28,447
on the left-hand side,
hit the stanchion

290
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:30,967
of the.50-calibre gun,
and blew up.

291
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:33,606
Killed the waist gunner.

292
00:21:35,687 --> 00:21:38,607
And here I was down
in this ball turret

293
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:40,847
trying to figure out
what I was supposed to do.

294
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:43,927
And, I have to say this,

295
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,927
my training as an Eagle Scout

296
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:51,527
in the Boy Scouts of America
saved my arm that day.

297
00:21:51,527 --> 00:21:54,207
Because I put a tourniquet
around it, knew how to do that.

298
00:21:54,207 --> 00:21:57,007
Knew how to stop
the flow of blood.

299
00:21:57,007 --> 00:22:00,527
And, uh, everything
hunky-dory then.

300
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:04,487
And continued on flying
in the ball turret.

301
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:10,687
So it's, about 35,
40 degrees below zero.

302
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:14,127
And when blood flows out,

303
00:22:14,127 --> 00:22:18,687
it freezes and drops down
and rolls around on the bottom.

304
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:21,687
So the idea is to make sure that
when you're at altitude,

305
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:23,607
you pick your blood up
and throw it out.

306
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,087
Because if you didn't,

307
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:28,927
you'd have to mop it up
when you got down. (Chuckles)

308
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:31,367
But I fly... I flew that way

309
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:35,155
for around four,
four and a half hours.

310
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:39,127
When I got hit,
immediately I says,

311
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:42,407
"Oh, my goodness... my parents.

312
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:45,807
"My parents will get
another telegram

313
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:48,487
"telling either I was
wounded or dead."

314
00:22:48,487 --> 00:22:51,887
At that point,
I didn't know which.

315
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:54,207
That was the first time
I ever thought

316
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,207
what my being in the service

317
00:22:57,207 --> 00:22:59,357
did to my parents.

318
00:23:01,527 --> 00:23:04,247
And I had second thoughts then.

319
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:05,887
But it was too late.

320
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:08,887

00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,207
NARRATOR:
German fighters returned

322
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:13,407
and attacked the bombers
in Earl Burke's group

323
00:23:13,407 --> 00:23:15,127
again and again,

324
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,197
all the way back
to the English Channel.

325
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:35,727
The survivors landed
wherever they could,

326
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:39,037
at airfields scattered
all across England.

327
00:23:42,327 --> 00:23:45,167
The second Schweinfurt raid was

328
00:23:45,167 --> 00:23:49,160
just as disastrous as the first.

329
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:57,687
60 more Fortresses
had been shot down.

330
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:00,927
600 more men were lost

331
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:04,158
and hundreds more were wounded.

332
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:09,727

remembered that day

333
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:12,116
as Black Thursday.

334
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:16,487
We, uh, first were sent

335
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:20,527
to a bomber base
to meet the B-17 s

336
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,807
coming in shooting off
red flares,

337
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:25,719
which meant there
were wounded aboard.

338
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:31,607
The first one came in just right
over the treetops.

339
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:34,519
We thought it was
going to crash.

340
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:41,207
It skidded on the runway.

341
00:24:41,207 --> 00:24:43,287
And I was in the ambulance.

342
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:45,727
We ran over there and ran in...

343
00:24:45,727 --> 00:24:48,727
You had to crawl.

344
00:24:48,727 --> 00:24:53,567
There was no way to get back
to a B-17 standing up.

345
00:24:53,567 --> 00:24:56,487
The tail gunner was dead.

346
00:24:56,487 --> 00:25:00,799
He'd been, you know, just
shot right through the head.

from his family

everybody back home

it was "a kind of coma",

to lie down,

preferred to sleep on rocks
rather than bare ground

560
00:40:05,207 --> 00:40:08,647

relatively dry.

"so they can eat all that stuff

the street lights at night.

689
00:48:17,847 --> 00:48:20,487
"But it didn't last very long,

690
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:23,207
"just enough to throw
a little mantle of white

691
00:48:23,207 --> 00:48:28,367
"in patches over the dark,
bare, dirty-looking ground.

692
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:31,447
"Tuesday morning,
the snapping cold came,

693
00:48:31,447 --> 00:48:33,607
"and by Wednesday morning,

694
00:48:33,607 --> 00:48:36,447
"the smoke from the chimneys
was hanging like white plumes

695
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:39,647
"in the clear,
quiet, frosty air."

696
00:48:39,647 --> 00:48:44,562
Al Mclntosh,
'Rock County Star Herald'.

697
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:56,367
NARRATOR:
Americans could now look back

698
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:59,837
on some real progress
in the war against the Axis.

699
00:49:02,847 --> 00:49:05,167
In the Pacific Theatre
of Operations,

700
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:09,247
Americans had recaptured Attu
in the Aleutian Islands

701
00:49:09,247 --> 00:49:13,967
and were fighting
on Bougainville and New Guinea.

702
00:49:13,967 --> 00:49:18,567
But the Japanese were still
on the march in Burma,

703
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:21,967
intent on invading
north-eastern India.

704
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:24,887
And the long campaign
to take the Gilberts,

705
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:27,287
the Marshalls
and the Carolines,

706
00:49:27,287 --> 00:49:29,367
to liberate the Philippines

707
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:32,087
and eventually attack
the Japanese home islands,

708
00:49:32,087 --> 00:49:35,607
had only just begun.

709
00:49:35,607 --> 00:49:38,247
In the European Theatre,

710
00:49:38,247 --> 00:49:40,367
improved radar,

711
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:42,767
new, long-range Allied aircraft

712
00:49:42,767 --> 00:49:45,167
and ever-growing numbers
of escort ships

713
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:47,167
sailing from American shipyards

714
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:51,247
reduced the threat
from German U-boats.

715
00:49:51,247 --> 00:49:53,487
More and more weapons

716
00:49:53,487 --> 00:49:57,047
and equipment were now reaching
the embattled Soviet Union.

717
00:49:57,047 --> 00:50:00,327
When the Red Army began to sweep
the enemy from the Ukraine,

718
00:50:00,327 --> 00:50:03,687
thousands of newly-manufactured
American trucks

719
00:50:03,687 --> 00:50:08,207
helped make possible
their deadly pursuit.

720
00:50:08,207 --> 00:50:12,407
The Axis had been driven
from North Africa, too,

721
00:50:12,407 --> 00:50:15,843
and Sicily was now
in Allied hands.

722
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:22,247
But the Germans were
fighting back hard in Italy.

723
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:24,807
And in secret,

724
00:50:24,807 --> 00:50:28,167
they had already begun
to implement a policy

725
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:30,287
of systematised murder

726
00:50:30,287 --> 00:50:34,007
that would one day persuade
even the most cynical GI

727
00:50:34,007 --> 00:50:37,079
that the war had to be fought.

728
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:43,727
As Allied leaders drew up plans

729
00:50:43,727 --> 00:50:46,567
for the long-delayed invasion
of the Continent,

730
00:50:46,567 --> 00:50:49,847
Hitler put tens of thousands
of labourers to work

731
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:52,998
strengthening
his coastal defences.

732
00:50:56,927 --> 00:50:59,607
For the men of Luverne,
Sacramento,

733
00:50:59,607 --> 00:51:05,887
Mobile, Waterbury,
and every other American town,

734
00:51:05,887 --> 00:51:09,243
things were bound
to get still tougher.
