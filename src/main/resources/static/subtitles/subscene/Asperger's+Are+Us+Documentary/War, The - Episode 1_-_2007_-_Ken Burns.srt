00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:42,941
            NARRATOR:           
           One evening          
     in the summer of 1941,     

4
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:45,810
      several months before     
the United States would be drawn

5
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,246
   into the Second World War,   

6
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:51,216
    in a little farming town    
           in Alabama,          

7
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:56,254
  a 16-year-old high-school boy 
   named Glenn Dowling Frazier  

8
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,990
           discovered           
     that the girl he loved     

9
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:03,561
 was interested in someone else.

10
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,062
       (crickets chirping)      

11
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,464
 Frazier was so angry and upset 

12
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,901
    that when the owner of a    
 juke joint refused him service,

13
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:15,273
       he stalked outside,      
  climbed onto his motorcycle,  

14
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,774
  and roared through the door,  

15
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:21,179
       shattering bottles       
     and smashing furniture.    

16
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:22,980
        As he raced away,       

17
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:28,319
    the bar owner chased him    
 down the street with a shotgun.

18
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:30,221
        The next morning,       

19
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,257
       humiliated, scared,      

20
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,392
 and unable to face his parents,

21
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,895
      Glenn Frazier went to     
 the nearest recruiting office, 

22
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:42,867
       lied about his age       
 and joined the peacetime army. 

23
00:01:43,902 --> 00:01:49,073
     He volunteered to serve    
       in the Philippines.      

24
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,910
            FRAZIER:            
       When I volunteered       
   for the Philippine Islands,  

25
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:56,548
   I had no idea that we would  
      actually be in a war.     

26
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,584
         I was thinking         
    that probably Germany was   

27
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,053
      the most likely place     
   that there would be a war,   

28
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:05,290
so in my mind, I thought it'd be
        safe over there.        

29
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:10,294
      I never thought Japan     
     would be attacking us.     

30
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:13,831
            NARRATOR:           
    Over the next four years,   

31
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:17,969
   Frazier would find himself   
      in the midst of war--     

32
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,904
 desperate hand-to-hand combat, 

33
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:25,409
    a forced march so brutal    
the world would never forget it,

34
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,679
  and nightmarish prison camps  

35
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,815
 where simply surviving required

36
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:35,553
        luck and bravery        
      and unshakable will.      

37
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:43,394
Back in Alabama, those who loved
 him would be told he was dead. 

38
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:47,698
 All Glenn Frazier would be able
   to do was cling to the hope  

39
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,802
          that one day          
    he could come back home.    

40
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:57,475
   (artillery shell whooshes,   
            explodes)           

41
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,745
     (gunfire, men shouting)    

42
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:05,249
     I don't think there is     
   such a thing as a good war.  

43
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,219
       There are sometimes      
         necessary wars.        

44
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:12,189
           And I think          
    one might say just wars.    

45
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,959
       And that, never...       

46
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:18,296
I never questioned the necessity
           of that war          

47
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,532
 and I still do not question it.

48
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:24,302
        It was something        
      that had to be done.      

49
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:35,814
            NARRATOR:           
     The greatest cataclysm     
           in history           

50
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:40,552
       grew out of ancient      
  and ordinary human emotions:  

51
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:43,921
anger and arrogance and bigotry,

52
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:47,525
           victimhood           
     and the lust for power.    

53
00:03:48,627 --> 00:03:52,864
          And it ended          
 because other human qualities--

54
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:56,701
    courage and perseverance    
        and selflessness;       

55
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:01,206
       faith, leadership,       
  and the hunger for freedom--  

56
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,809
            combined            
   with unimaginable brutality  

57
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,045
      to change the course      
        of human events.        

58
00:04:08,047 --> 00:04:09,680
    (air raid siren wailing)    

59
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:14,451
The Second World War brought out
     the best and the worst     

60
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:17,955
        in a generation,        
       and blurred the two      

61
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:23,394
 so that they became, at times, 
    almost indistinguishable.   

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,104
  In the killing that engulfed  
  the world from 1939 to 1945,  

63
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:38,142
between 50 and 60 million people
             died...            

64
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:44,115
           ...so many,          
and in so many different places,

65
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,352
      that the real number      
      will never be known.      

66
00:04:57,162 --> 00:05:01,833
    More than 85 million men    
  and women served in uniform,  

67
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,203
  but the overwhelming majority 
      of those who perished     

68
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,871
        were civilians--        

69
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:12,009
    men, women, and children    
           obliterated          

70
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,779
    by the arithmetic of war.   

71
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,814
       (distant explosion)      

72
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:28,292
  The United States of America  
    was relatively fortunate.   

73
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:34,031
   More than 405,000 soldiers   
          and sailors,          

74
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:39,136
    airmen and marines died,    
   but that figure represented  

75
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:42,707
      proportionately fewer     
       military casualties      

76
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:47,579
    than were suffered by any   
 of the other major combatants. 

77
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,483
         American cities        
       were not destroyed.      

78
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:58,223
     American civilians were    
      never really at risk.     

79
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:08,332
   But without American power,  

80
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,502
      without the sacrifice     
       of American lives,       

81
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:15,506
     the struggle's outcome     
 would have been very different.

82
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:20,111
      The American economy      
       only grew stronger       

83
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,981
    as the fighting went on,    
    and by the time it ended,   

84
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:28,720
 the United States would be the 
  most powerful nation on earth 

85
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:34,225
 and a once isolated and insular
  people would find themselves  

86
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,028
 at the center of world affairs.

87
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:44,869
  The war touched every family  

88
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:49,841
         on every street        
   in every town in America--   

89
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,477
 towns like Luverne, Minnesota; 

90
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,047
     Sacramento, California;    

91
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:59,317
     Waterbury, Connecticut;    

92
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,854
      and Mobile, Alabama--     

93
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:06,691
    and nothing would ever be   
         the same again.        

94
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,294
  (gunfire and artillery fire)  

95
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,163
             HYNES:             
    I'm not sure I can speak    

96
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:17,135
     about why human beings     
      in general go to war.     

97
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:22,540
         I think that's         
    a pretty large category.    

98
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,741
        I can only speak        

99
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:28,812
     about why 18-year-olds     
   from Minneapolis go to war.  

100
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:33,984
         They go to war         
 because it's impossible not to,

101
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:37,121
because a current is established

102
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,792
    in the society so swift,    
       flowing toward war,      

103
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:47,665
 that every young man who steps 
 into it is carried downstream.

      in the fall of 1941.      

120

     But for most Americans,    

121
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,858
  finally beginning to recover  
   from the Great Depression,   

122
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,463
     events overseas seemed     
      impossibly far away.      

123
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:35,340
     In Luverne, Minnesota,     
the biggest town in Rock County,

124
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,142
         in the state's         
      southwestern corner,      

125
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:42,079
     the autumn harvest was     
        only a memory...        

126
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:46,484
and its 3,000 citizens had begun
      the long winter wait      

127
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,821
      until they could sow      
       their fields again.

129
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:59,997
lived at 517 North Kniss Avenue.

130
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,533
        He was a newcomer       
        from North Dakota       

131
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,869

          big city jobs         

132
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:07,772

133
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,207
   He would soon find himself   
        trying to explain       

134
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:14,778
        the unexplainable       
      to his new neighbors.     

135
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:19,383
 Six-year-old Jim Sherman lived 
         with his family        

136
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:24,155
   at 503 North Estey Street.   

137
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:28,026
            SHERMAN:            
         I think it was         
 a pretty close-knit community. 

138
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,326
   Uh, there was a saying that  

139
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,962
    if you don't want people    
        to know about it,       

140
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,364
you don't do it-- sort of thing.

141
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:38,802
 And everybody knew pretty much 
     everybody else in town.    

142
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,135
            NARRATOR:           
    Four miles south of town,   

143
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,336
      near the Rock River,      

144
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,040
      was the 120-acre farm     
     of the Aanenson family.    

145
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:22,113
     There they raised cows     
and grew barley, oats, and corn.

146
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,720
 who would face the most fearful
 odds in the skies over France, 

147
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,791
       was named Quentin.       

148
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,762
 sometimes I would be on a piece
 of farm machinery plowing corn 

149
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:41,098
      and a lonely airplane     
         would fly over         

150
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,435
       and I would look up      
    and my spirit would soar.   

151
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,337
   "That's where I want to be   
            sometime.           

152
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,738
    "I want to live that way.   

153
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,942
   I want to do those things."  

154
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:56,413
            NARRATOR:           
   In Sacramento, California,   
       the state capital,       

155
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,516
         Okies, refugees        
       from the Dust Bowl,      

156
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,518
    still camped on the edge    
             of town            

157
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,388
      and worked the fields     
   and orchards and vineyards   

158
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,090
       of the surrounding       
       Sacramento Valley.       

159
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:10,227
  The city had been the gateway 
   to the California Gold Rush  

160
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:14,765
    and the western anchor of   
 the transcontinental railroad. 

161
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:19,636
      Although it was home      
     to some 106,000 people,    

162
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:23,541
     Sacramento still seemed    
       like a small town.       

163
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,809
       Tom and Earl Burke,      

164
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:29,613
 who would be asked to sacrifice
  everything for their country, 

165
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:34,718
    lived with their parents    
       at 3240 Lassen Way,      

166
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,620
       just north of town.      

167
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,390
              EARL:             
    It was a tremendous town;   
   everybody knew each other.   

168
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,759
   All, all ethnic groups were  
          just perfect.         

169
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,830
  I mean it was... you could go 
   out on the streets at night  

170
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,065
    at 11:00, 12:00 at night    

171
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,968
    and, you know, you could    
     walk home in the dark.     

172
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,570
    Nobody locked the doors.    

173
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:54,605
   Nobody even thought of it.   

174
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,175
      It was a nice, clean,     
          little town.          

175
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:04,115
         BURNETT MILLER:        
The lower end of town was rather
         colorful to us.        

176
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,184
 There were lots of whorehouses.

177
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,454
      As you got up towards     
     the nicer part of town,    

178
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,756
    towards Tenth Street, uh,   

179
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:16,360
   the houses of prostitution   
        were quite fancy.       

180
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,598
          And as kids,          
    we used to run down there   

181
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,869
   and run through the place,   
       just raising hell.       

182
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:30,608
            NARRATOR:           
18-year-old Burnett Miller lived
         with his family        

183
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:36,781
  in a comfortable neighborhood 
  at 3643 West Lincoln Avenue.  

184
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:42,119
       He would discover,       
  in the last days of the war,  

185
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:47,024
    why it had to be fought.    

186
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:51,562
 Almost 7,000 Japanese-Americans
    also lived in Sacramento    

187
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,965
   and the surrounding county.  

188
00:13:54,933 --> 00:14:00,904
   Doctors, lawyers, teachers,  
        and shop owners,        

189
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:07,578
   as well as some of the most  
 productive farmers in America. 

190
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,249
Susumu Satow and his family grew
      strawberries, grapes,     

191
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:15,619
    and raspberries on their    
 20-acre farm, east of the city.

192
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,788
          SUSUMU SATOW:         
 My mother didn't speak English.

193
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,026
      My father spoke, uh,      
         broken English.        

194
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:26,196
   As a youngster, at the age   
 of about eight, nine, I guess, 

195
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:31,001
I used to walk down the railroad
 track to a place called Mills. 

196
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:35,506
     And Mills had a semipro    
         baseball team.         

197
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:42,480
  And so I grew up in sort of a 
 baseball environment, I guess.

00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,124
            NARRATOR:           
   In Waterbury, Connecticut,   

199
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,426
          on the banks          
     of the Naugatuck River,    

200
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,961
      a skilled workforce,      

201
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,397
        mostly immigrants       
    and immigrants' children,   

202
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,800
  turned out screws and washers 
          and buttons,          

203
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:04,802
 shower heads and alarm clocks, 

204
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:07,404
          toy airplanes         
      and lipstick holders,     

205
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,439
      and cocktail shakers.     

206
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,541
     Since the 19th century,    

207
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:16,647
 its citizens had proudly called
    their town "Brass City."    

208
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:23,687
Ray Leopold, the son of a Jewish
     immigrant from Latvia,     

209
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:28,058
     lived on Route Eight on    
 the southern edge of the city. 

210
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,164
     Waterbury was a center     
     for high-quality craft.    

211
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:38,402
  There were individuals there  
who could do 1/10,000 of an inch

212
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:43,941
  on anything and if there was  
    zero tolerance required,    

213
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,008
    they could do that, too.    

214
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,579
          OLGA CIARLO:          
Well, Waterbury, where we lived,

215
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,981
        there were a lot        
       of Italian people.       

216
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:54,452
  They had made a good business 
         for themselves         

217
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,387
    and were very well liked.   

218
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,923
We had a wonderful neighborhood.

219
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,093
         We had parties         
      every single Sunday.      

220
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,396
    Every Sunday was a picnic   
             for us.            

221
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:11,202
            NARRATOR:           
     The Ciarlo family lived    
   at 1032 North Main Street,   

222
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:16,039
 in the Italian section of town.

223
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,542
 Their father had recently died.

224
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:24,615
     His loss would be only     
the beginning of their troubles.

225
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,156
     And in Mobile, Alabama,    

226
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,724
       population 112,000,      

227
00:16:34,726 --> 00:16:38,028
     the only real industry     
        was shipbuilding,       

228
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,932
    as it had been since the    
Great War, a generation earlier.

229
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:46,002
     Once a center of cotton    
       and slave trading,       

230
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:50,173
      Mobile was best known     
 for its annual Azalea Festival,

231
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,878
 and its leisurely Southern air.

232
00:16:56,581 --> 00:17:01,352
 John Gray and his family lived 
   on the south side of town,   

233
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:06,724
 near the L & N Railroad tracks 
      at 407 Royal Street.      

234
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:11,128
     He would soon be asked     
   to fight a war for freedom,  

235
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,564
    though his own country's    
      definition of freedom     

236
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,001
      did not include him.      

237
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,137
              GRAY:             
   Whites and blacks got along  
          pretty good,          

238
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:23,174
       as long as you had       
         the status quo.        

239
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:28,645
     But you could not, uh,     
eat at the counter at Woolworth.

240
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,580
You'd have to go down to the end

241
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:34,051
     and order your sandwich    
        and take it out.        

242
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,419
           Out to eat.          

243
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,492
            NARRATOR:           
          Across town,          

244
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:44,427
       Katharine Phillips       
         and her family         

245
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,397
  lived at 1555 Monterey Place. 

246
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,734
            PHILLIPS:           
        Daddy said Mobile       
         made its living        

247
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,936
 by taking in each other's wash.

248
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,139
   And it was absolutely true.  

249
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,941
   The pace of life was slow.   

250
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,410
    On a hot summer evening--   

251
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,579
       of course there was      
      no air-conditioning--     

252
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,416
    so Daddy would load us in   
 the car and we'd drive downtown

253
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:09,786
    to Brown's Ice Cream and    
  he'd buy us an ice cream cone 

254
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,589
     and then we'd drive out    
          to Arlington          

255
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,524
    and park out by the bay,    

256
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,561
        and all sit there       
    and enjoy the sea breeze.   

257
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,864
    And when we'd cooled down   
   enough, he'd bring us home   

258
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,235
  and everybody could go to bed 
        and go to sleep.        

259
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:27,271
     Or we sat on our porch     
         in the evening         

260
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,840
     and the children played    
          in the yard.          

261
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,509
     It was a wonderful way     
           to grow up.          

262
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,913
   And we were completely away  
   from the rest of the world   

263
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,748
         down in Mobile.        

264
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:51,996
            NARRATOR:           
  No one in Mobile, Waterbury,  

265
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:57,134
      Sacramento, Luverne,      
   or anywhere else in America  

266
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,103
          was prepared          
  for what was about to happen  

267
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,674
   to them and their country.   

268
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,691
         DANIEL INOUYE:         
    Pearl Harbor was a Sunday   

269
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,394
 and, together with the family, 

270
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,930
     we're all getting ready    
        to go to church.        

271
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:31,201
 And the disc jockey's going on 
      with Hawaiian music,      

272
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:34,171
          and suddenly          
     he sounded hysterical.     

273
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,175
          For a moment,         
   I thought this was an act.   

274
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,745
So I stepped out into the street
       and sure enough...       

275
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:47,584
there are puffs and smoke coming
 out of that Pearl Harbor area. 

276
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,754
 And so I called my father out, 

277
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:56,126
   And all of a sudden, three   
  aircraft flew right overhead. 

278
00:19:56,128 --> 00:20:00,897
      They were pearl gray      
         with red dots.         

279
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,567
   I knew what was happening.   

280
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,135
  (artillery shells whistling,  
       explosions booming)      

281
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,572
 And I thought my world had just
         come to an end.        

282
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,909
           (explosion)          

283
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:34,831
         (siren wailing)        

284
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,008
            NARRATOR:           
          At 7:55 a.m.          

285
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,145
  on Sunday, December 7, 1941,  

286
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,446
 hundreds of Japanese warplanes,

287
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:53,249
 launched from aircraft carriers
         far out at sea,        

288
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:55,652
      attacked the American     
          Pacific Fleet         

289
00:20:55,654 --> 00:21:00,190
            anchored            
    at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.    

290
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:01,191
           (explosion)          

291
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,994
         The attack took        
        a terrible toll--       

292
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:07,064
       so terrible a toll       
     that the War Department    

293
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:11,201
  kept secret the exact details 
           for years.           

294
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,471
          (explosions)          

295
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:20,310
       Eight battleships,       
    including theUSS<i> Arizona,</i>   

296
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,047
      three light cruisers,     
        three destroyers,       

297
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:28,652
  and four other naval vessels  
  were either sunk or damaged.  

298
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:37,694
      164 American aircraft     
      were also destroyed.      

299
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:43,567
     Most hadn't even gotten    
         off the ground.        

300
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:50,407
 And 2,403 Americans were dead. 

301
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,849
        Nothing like this       
        had ever happened       

302
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:02,653
 to the United States of America
             before.            

303
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:13,030
   17-year-old Daniel Inouye,   
the son of a Japanese immigrant,

304
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:18,468
was a senior at William McKinley
     High School in Honolulu    

305
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,972
   and a Red Cross volunteer.   

306
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:27,076
             INOUYE:            
   A call came in that we had   
       casualties nearby,       

307
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:32,248
  One haunts me every so often. 

308
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:37,387
         It was a woman         
       clutching a child.       

309
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,656
      Her head was severed,     

310
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:44,027
 but here she was with her arms 
        around her baby.        

311
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,429
           And, uh...           

312
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:51,067
           So this is           
  what I had to pick up, at 17. 

313
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:03,179
     ANNOUNCER (over radio):    
     One, two, three, four.     

314
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:05,649
     Hello, NBC. Hello, NBC.    

315
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:09,218
This is KBU in Honolulu, Hawaii.

316
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,489
            PHILLIPS:           
   I was a sophomore at Auburn  

317
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,524
 when Pearl Harbor was attacked.

318
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,494
           ANNOUNCER:           
It is no joke, it is a real war.

319
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:21,398
    I came home from church,    
      went to the dormitory     

320
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,269
       and heard all this       
      screaming and crying.     

321
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,570
    And I went down the hall,   
             I said,            

322
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,173
       "What's the matter?      
         What's wrong?"         

323
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,109
 They said, "Turn the radio on."

324
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,712
    So we turned our radio on   
         and, of course,        

325
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:39,248
     he said, "The Japs have    
     attacked Pearl Harbor."    

326
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,186
           ANNOUNCER:           
  We have been on the telephone 
     with our station KGMB,     

327
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,755
      which is in Honolulu,     
      and they report to us     

328
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,124
   that the antiaircraft fire   
          can be heard          

329
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:52,929
        in a steady drone       
as the attacking planes come in.

330
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,664
            PHILLIPS:           
  But we comforted each other,  

331
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:56,833
and the girls all cried and wept

332
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:00,637
        because they had        
     boyfriends or relatives    

333
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,640
        that were already       
      in the armed forces.      

334
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,910
   And we realized immediately  

335
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,345
     that this would be war.    

336
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:12,582
            NARRATOR:           
       Katherine Phillips'      
       younger brother Sid      

337
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,418
    was back home in Mobile.    

338
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,522
        SIDNEY PHILLIPS:        
      I was in a drugstore,     
      drinking a milkshake,     

339
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:23,960
     and this lady burst in     
   the side door and screamed,  

340
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,795
      "Turn on the radio!"      

341
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,665
     They were talking about    
 Pearl Harbor on every station. 

342
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:33,102
           ANNOUNCER:           
   And London now awaits Prime  
  Minister Churchill's promise  

343
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:36,406
     to declare war on Japan    
        within the hour.        

344
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,142
       We knew this meant       
       we were in the war.      

345
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,445
         And we just...         

346
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,015
     all sat there quietly.     

347
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:49,252
 The radio kept giving the same 
  information again and again.  

348
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:50,754
           ANNOUNCER:           
     ...8:30 p.m. tonight...    

349
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:53,023
       BARBARA COVINGTON:       
      I remember I was home     
        eating breakfast        

350
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,158
         with my mother         
      and my two brothers.      

351
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,426
       I was the youngest,      

352
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:59,162
    and we were getting ready   
     to go to Sunday school.    

353
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,098
       I remember the fear      
   coming in my mother's eyes,  

354
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,734
  because she knew my brothers  

355
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,835
    were probably going to be   
     called, and they were.     

356
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,606
           ANNOUNCER:           
   From Washington, Secretary   
     of War Henry L. Stimson    

357
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:13,543
  today ordered the entire Army 
          into uniform,         

358
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,513
          ASAKO TOKUNO:         
     That was about the time    
    we had finals at school,    

359
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,784
 and this was my first semester 
         at UC Berkeley.        

360
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:22,619
 And, uh, heard the news first. 

361
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:27,090
  Of course, I traveled by bus  
        to go to school.        

362
00:25:28,158 --> 00:25:30,227
        And as I'd stand        
        on that corner...       

363
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,694
         (clears throat)        

364
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,962
           I would get          
      this terrible feeling     

365
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,398
   that people were watching,   
         looking at me.         

366
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,503
      And, um, you just get     
  so self-conscious, you know,  

367
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:40,937
       so much more aware.      

368
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,406
  I'd never been aware of my... 

369
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:46,809
     you know, my ethnicity.    

370
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,945
 And so, that was very strange. 

371
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:53,716
     That was the first time    
    I really felt, you know,    

372
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,987
           ANNOUNCER:           
       For the latest news      
    on the Pacific situation,   

373
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,656
   keep tuned to this station.  

374
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,158
            LEOPOLD:            
    It seemed so incredible.    

375
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,262
      2,400 innocent people     

376
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:09,032
 blown off the face of the earth
        was an atrocity.        

377
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:13,003
        It was something        
   that had to be corrected--   

378
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:16,072
        perhaps the word        
       might be "avenged."      

379
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:20,643
           And, um...           
   we had to get busy with it.  

380
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:23,613
 PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT (on radio):
          Yesterday...          

381
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:27,516
       December 7, 1941...      

382
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:31,487
            NARRATOR:           
    The following afternoon,    
      people in Sacramento,     

383
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:35,058
   Waterbury, Luverne, Mobile,  

384
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,326
 and everywhere else in America 

385
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:39,963
         gathered around        
      their radios to hear      

386
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,965
       President Franklin       
        Delano Roosevelt        

387
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:46,669
 ask a joint session of Congress
    for a declaration of war.   

388
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,606
      PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT:      
      The attack yesterday      

389
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:54,711
     on the Hawaiian Islands    
    has caused severe damage    

390
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:59,382
        to American naval       
      and military forces.      

391
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:03,453
      I regret to tell you      
  that very many American lives 

392
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,921
         have been lost.        

393
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,824
   In addition, American ships  
 have been reported torpedoed...

394
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:11,894
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
     We gathered outside of     
     Langdon Hall at Auburn,    

395
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,632
          and they had          
      a loudspeaker truck,      

396
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,834
   and we stood there quietly   

397
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:21,904
         and listened to        
President Roosevelt declare war.

398
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:26,976
        (voice breaking):       
         And, of course,        
     our whole life changed.    

399
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:31,614
      PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT:      
         With confidence        
      in our Armed Forces,      

400
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:35,552
       with the unbounding      
          determination         

401
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:37,620
         of our people,         

402
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:42,291
          we will gain          
     the inevitable triumph,    

403
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,993
         so help us God.        

404
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,295
           (applause)           

405
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:01,011
            NARRATOR:           
    Three days after Congress   
     declared war on Japan,     

406
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:06,149
  Japan's allies, Nazi Germany  
       and Fascist Italy,       

407
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,919
          declared war          
      on the United States.     

408
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:13,890
     All across the country,    

409
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:17,127
        anxious Americans       
        asked themselves,       

410
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,629
     "How did this happen?"     

411
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:26,169
     For more than a decade,    
they had had glimpses of a world

412
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,138
     descending into chaos--    

413
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,107
      in their newspapers,      
         over the radio         

414
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,877
        and in newsreels        
    shown in movie theaters.    

415
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,881
    The Strand and the State    
          in Waterbury.         

416
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:42,519
   The Crest and the Alhambra   
         in Sacramento.         

417
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:46,055
The Roxy and the Pike in Mobile.

418
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:51,194
   And the Pix and the Palace   
           in Luverne.          

419
00:28:59,169 --> 00:29:03,139
           ANNOUNCER:           
   For the first time, we saw   
   great cities squashed flat,  

420
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,276
  civilians bombed and killed.  

421
00:29:15,152 --> 00:29:18,788
            NARRATOR:           
    They had hoped they could   
       stay out of it all.      

422
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:23,292
       EMMA BELLE PETCHER:      
       You couldn't fathom      
        across the ocean,       

423
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,495
            you know,           
     and you couldn't fathom    

424
00:29:26,497 --> 00:29:27,964
    what it was really like.    

425
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,033
       But they would show      
        these newsreels,        

426
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:33,937
and I'd sneak in the back of the
theater and see these newsreels,

427
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,172
    and they were horrifying.   

428
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:07,837
            NARRATOR:           
      Throughout the 1930s,     
      country after country     

429
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,674
      had been held hostage     
    to the ruthless ambitions   

430
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:15,779
        of the leaders of       
what would be called "the Axis."

431
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:19,916
Benito Mussolini, the swaggering
       dictator of Italy,       

432
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:24,254
dreamed of restoring the ancient
    Roman Empire and becoming   

433
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:28,591
  master of the Mediterranean.  

434
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:32,729
       Adolf Hitler built       
    his monstrous Nazi regime   

435
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,131
 and the mightiest army on earth

436
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,168
      on the German thirst      
          for revenge--         

437
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,771
   revenge against the victors  
     of the First World War,    

438
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:46,442
 but also against those at home 
   who he claimed had stabbed   

439
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,678
 their armed forces in the back:

440
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,016
     Socialists, Communists,    
          and the Jews.         

441
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:53,916
      Above all, the Jews,      

442
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:59,222
      who he said were both     
       evil and subhuman.       

443
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:03,059
 The German people were superior
 to all others, he assured them,

444
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:07,697
 and he had been chosen to lead 
  them to their great destiny-- 

445
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,367
     a Reich that would rule    
       over the Old World       

446
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,002
           and the New          
      for a thousand years.     

447
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,205
        CROWD (chanting):       
          <i> Heil! Heil!</i>          

448
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:25,081
  The fact is that I am a Jew.  

449
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,884
     I was aware of what was    
       going on in Europe,      

450
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:32,221
 perhaps a little more than the 
average person might have known.

451
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:36,793
      And I did feel that,      
        somehow or other,       

452
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:40,297
 that Hitler had to be stopped. 

453
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:46,769
     Not only for the Jews,     
 but for everybody in the world.

454
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,241
        QUENTIN AANENSON:       
    We knew the war in Europe   

455
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,044
     was going to affect us     
           eventually.          

456
00:31:55,046 --> 00:32:00,716
  After Czechoslovakia had been 
    taken over by Germany...    

457
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:05,555
      we knew that the war      
    was coming our direction,   

458
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,524
      one way or the other.     

459
00:32:14,164 --> 00:32:17,333
           ANNOUNCER:           
The beginning of the<i> Blitzkrieg,</i>
      "the lightning war,"      

460
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:21,471
   ripping deep into a nation   
    not equipped to meet it.    

461
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,742
            NARRATOR:           
      On September 1, 1939,     

462
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:31,381
 Hitler's forces stormed across 
      the border of Poland.     

463
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:43,792
   In response to the attack,   
       Britain and France       

464
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:47,063
    declared war on Germany.    

465
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:52,501
 The Second World War had begun.

466
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:04,347
    Denmark and Norway fell.    

467
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,783
    Holland had surrendered.    

468
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,887
      Belgium was crushed.      

469
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:14,790
 French defenses had collapsed. 

470
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,760
      And in June of 1940,      

471
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,128
           Paris fell.          

472
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:26,869
   Adolf Hitler was the master  
       of Western Europe.       

473
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,942
     Then he set his sights     
           on Britain.          

474
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:36,646
      For more than a year,     
      she would stand alone     

475
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:39,883
    against relentless attack   
          from the air.         

476
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:42,952
   EDWARD MURROW (over radio):  
         Hello, America.        

477
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,122
      This is Edward Murrow     
      speaking from London.     

478
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,156
     They came over shortly     

479
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:49,258
       after blackout time      
      and opened the attack     

480
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,862
     with a veritable shower    
   of flares and incendiaries.  

481
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:04,307
            NARRATOR:           
    American public opinion,    

482
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,143
   which had been steadfastly   
      against being pulled      

483
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:12,549
  into Europe's troubles again, 
      had begun to change.      

484
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,952
  We had a built-up resentment  
           to Hitler.           

485
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:20,757
      We had been watching      
      the news since 1939,      

486
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:25,628
     so we knew what Hitler     
      was doing in Europe.      

487
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,797
 The way he had attacked Poland,

488
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:30,800
      the way he had tried      
        to bring England        

489
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,536
          to her knees          
  with that constant bombing--  

490
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:40,242
     we just disliked Hitler    
  and everything he was doing.  

491
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,182
            NARRATOR:           
          But as plans          
      for Britain faltered,     

492
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,551
 Hitler had turned his attention
          to the east,          

493
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:52,288
  ordering three million troops 
      in a surprise attack      

494
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,124
      on his supposed ally,     
        the Soviet Union,       

495
00:34:55,126 --> 00:35:00,195
   setting in motion the worst  
      slaughter of the war.     

496
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,876
   Meanwhile, on the far side   
          of the world,         

497
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:17,580
the military men who ruled Japan
   in the name of the emperor   

498
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,583
      believed their people     
         superior, too.         

499
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:24,220
      Their small, crowded      
     island nation had moved    

500
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,290
     from medieval feudalism    
        to the modern era       

501
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:30,693
     in less than a century,    

502
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,061
   and they dreamed of Japan's  
       becoming a mighty,       

503
00:35:33,063 --> 00:35:35,331
     self-sufficient power.     

504
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:39,435
  With extraordinary brutality, 

505
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,504
    they had set out to seize   
     the resources of China.    

506
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:46,709
        And they coveted        
      the French and Dutch      

507
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:50,846
      and British colonies      
   in Southeast Asia as well.   

508
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:05,194
           ANNOUNCER:           
    From Shanghai to Nanking,   

509
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,496
 Japan still spreads destruction
         from the skies         

510
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,598
 upon a score of Chinese cities.

511
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,367
       Here is the result:      

512
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:15,838
innocent victims of the savagery
 that masquerades as modern war.

            NARRATOR:           
       Among the obstacles      
         in Japan's way         

514
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:35,825
   were the U.S. Pacific Fleet  
       based in Hawaii...       

515
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:40,697
 and American military outposts 
      in Guam, Wake Island,     

516
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:44,367
     and in the Commonwealth    
       of the Philippines.      

517
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,375
  The Axis leaders were united  

518
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:55,911
         in their scorn         
     for the United States.     

519
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:59,148
     Its people were "timid,    
      undisciplined scum,"      

520
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,684
          Hitler said,          
      "under the influence      

521
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,253
      of Negroes and Jews."     

522
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:07,222
         He was certain         
      such a mongrel people     

523
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:11,360
  could never win a war against 
       his Aryan legions.       

524
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:17,533
  President Roosevelt had done  
      everything he could,      

525
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,903
     short of war, to combat    
         the aggressors.        

526
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:25,975
Providing desperately needed aid
    to Britain and Russia...    

527
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:31,280
     ...demanding that Japan    
      withdraw from China.      

528
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,816
            Finally,            
    freezing Japanese assets    

529
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,585
      in the United States,     
     so that no American oil    

530
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:40,590
      could be used to fuel     
   further aggression in Asia.  

531
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,862
  For the Japanese militarists, 

532
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:50,599
    that had been the signal    
   to go to war with America.   

533
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:55,404
  They made General Hideki Tojo 
         prime minister.        

534
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,707
  He thought that by destroying 

535
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,875
     the U.S. Pacific Fleet     
         at Pearl Harbor        

536
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,210
        in a single blow,       

537
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,847
  he could stun and demoralize  
     the country long enough    

538
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,383
      to become so dominant     
          in the region         

539
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:11,154
        that Japan could        
       never be dislodged.      

540
00:38:14,024 --> 00:38:16,225
 American intelligence officers 

541
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:18,961
     had broken the Japanese    
         diplomatic code        

542
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,698
       and knew some kind       
      of attack was coming.     

543
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:27,370
   (explosion, plane soaring)   

544
00:38:31,074 --> 00:38:34,377
      But no one had known      
          where or when         

545
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:37,013
       until December 7th.      

546
00:38:45,555 --> 00:38:48,357
         GLENN FRAZIER:         
     I was raised in a real     
        Christian family        

547
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,929
  and, as a result, killing was 
    not part of my training.    

548
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:57,332
 And, uh, that was a big hurdle 
       for me to get over       

549
00:38:57,334 --> 00:39:01,269
       because I had been       
       taught not to kill.      

550
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:08,677
            NARRATOR:           
  Within hours of Pearl Harbor, 

551
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,346
 the Japanese had also attacked 

552
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,317
   the main Philippine island   
            of Luzon.           

553
00:39:18,054 --> 00:39:22,959
    17-year-old Glenn Frazier   
 was now in the middle of a war 

554
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:26,929
       he thought he would      
       never have to face.      

555
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:33,368
            FRAZIER:            
    And when the war started    

556
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,239
         and I was going        
     to the field hospital,     

557
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:38,507
            a couple            
  of Japanese planes-- Zeros--  

558
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,542
bombed and strafed the hospital.

559
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,212
      (gunfire, explosions)     

560
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,613
   And as we were approaching,  

561
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,950
    a friend of mine and I--    
     uh, we got into a ditch    

562
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:52,120
   and one of the dive bombers  
    came back and strafed us    

563
00:39:52,122 --> 00:39:54,990
      and dropped one bomb      
       and hit him direct.      

564
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,928
   And all I ever found of him  
  was his left foot in a shoe.  

565
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:04,000
   And when that Japanese Zero  
        turned his wings        

566
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:08,204
      right above the trees     
    and started to fly away,    

567
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:10,606
         I could see him        
    with a smile on his face.   

568
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:14,576
    And at that point, I had    
 no problem with killing people.

569
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:18,180
   In fact, I got to the point  
      where I hunted them.      

570
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,281
            (gunshot)           

571
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,984
      And if I didn't kill      
      a Japanese in a day,      

572
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,187
   I felt I didn't do my job.   

573
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:27,789
            (gunshot)           

574
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:31,394
            NARRATOR:           
      Glenn Frazier was one     
          of 31,000 men         

575
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:34,163
        under the command       
  of General Douglas MacArthur, 

576
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:37,666
     the best-known soldier     
      in the American Army.     

577
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,469
A frontline hero of World War I,

578
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:44,974
     he was as self-absorbed    
      as he was courageous.     

579
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:50,112
  But the news of Pearl Harbor  
       had paralyzed him.       

580
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,481
 He had had nine hours' warning,

581
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,116
 yet when the Japanese attacked 

582
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,484
          his airfields         
       in the Philippines,      

583
00:40:55,486 --> 00:41:00,756
   most of MacArthur's planes   
 were still parked wing to wing,

584
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,025
   easy targets for the enemy.  

585
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,728
        (bombs whistling,       
         then exploding)        

586
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:12,768
    More than 50,000 Japanese   
 soldiers would soon be ashore, 

587
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:18,206
      converging on Manila      
  from the north and the south. 

588
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,078
  Neither the American troops,  

589
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,181
  nor the thousands of Filipino 
 reservists MacArthur called up 

590
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:30,319
   would be able to stop them.  

591
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:38,227
    The Americans were being    
   pushed out of the Pacific.   

592
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:42,831
  MacArthur eventually ordered  
    all his forces to retreat   

593
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:47,503
      onto the mountainous,     
forest-covered Bataan Peninsula.

594
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,938
   He withdrew with his family  
          and his aides         

595
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,809
 to the heavily fortified island
   at the mouth of Manila Bay   

596
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,245
       called Corregidor.       

597
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:04,420
   Meanwhile, other Americans   
       in the Philippines,      

598
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:07,856
  innocent civilians thousands  
       of miles from home,      

599
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,193
        had been swept up       
       in the war as well.      

600
00:42:12,562 --> 00:42:15,097
         (siren wailing,        
         bell clanging)         

601
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,099
           (clamoring)          

602
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:33,448
       SASCHA WEINZHEIMER:      
 The day Pearl Harbor got bombed

603
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,017
        was the seventh.        

604
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,786
     But in the Philippines,    

605
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:39,588
 with... over the international 
  date line, it was the eighth. 

606
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:45,895
  Same day, and we were bombed  
       a few hours later.       

607
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,599
         And I had polio        
       when I was a baby,       

608
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:54,670
    so I used to go to Manila   
       three times a week       

609
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,439
      for physical therapy.     

610
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:59,107
  And this is what I was doing  
      on a Monday morning,      

611
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,177
on the eighth, when the Japanese
        started bombing.        

612
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:07,315
            NARRATOR:           
     Sascha Weinzheimer was     
         eight years old        

613
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:09,017
      in December of 1941,      

614
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,753
 the daughter and granddaughter 
       of wealthy farmers       

615
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,857
     with enormous holdings     
    in the Sacramento Valley    

616
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:16,926
     and in the Philippines.    

617
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,961
       As she would detail      
          in a journal,         

618
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:20,595
    she lived with her mother   
           and father,          

619
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:24,099
    her three-year-old sister   
 and her three-month-old brother

620
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,702
      on one of the largest     
        sugar plantations       

621
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:29,939
    on the Philippine Island

    on the second of January.

00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,867
   That was the beginning of,   
            you know,           

639
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:36,338
     this putting the people    
    into camps and so forth.    

640
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,874
   And your life changed fast.

    WEINZHEIMER (dramatized):   
   "The first thing I remember  

642
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,145
 "was looking across the street 
         towards the bay        

643
00:44:44,147 --> 00:44:48,250
  "and seeing Japanese soldiers 
and officers around the flagpole

645
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,420
   where our Stars and Stripes  
           had been."           

646
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:53,722
        (crowd cheering)        

647
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:57,593

 and keep away from the windows.

      Everyone was nervous,     
       especially Mother."

         Sascha's father        

652
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,845
     from the Bayview Hotel     

653
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:20,749
      to the walled campus      
   of Santo Tomas University,   

654
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:24,787
      which had been turned     
into a civilian internment camp.

we saw of him for a few months."

       Sascha and the rest      
   of her family found shelter  

663
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,983
      first in one convent,     
        and then another.       

664
00:45:57,086 --> 00:46:00,923
  Wherever they were, the sound 
    of the guns from Bataan--   

665
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,024
       where Glenn Frazier      

666
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:03,859
        and his comrades        
      were still struggling     

667
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,228
 to stop the Japanese advance-- 

668
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:09,331
    continued day and night.    

669
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:12,501
      (distant explosions)      

670
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:19,108

672
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,454
           SAM HYNES:           
       You have to imagine      
        what it was like        

673
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:36,925
 to be a teenage, middle-class, 
     lower-middle-class kid     

674
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:40,696
     in Minneapolis in 1941.    

675
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:45,667
   The chances for excitement   
      were fairly limited.      

676
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:48,837
   You could drive a car fast,  
      you could get drunk,      

677
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,239
    you could take a girl out   

678
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,775
    and try and get somewhere   
            and fail.           

679
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:56,078
    That's local excitement.    

680
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,712
 But to have an exciting life-- 

681
00:46:57,714 --> 00:47:01,717
     it was hard to imagine     
 what an exciting life would be.

682
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:06,788
       And then, suddenly,      
    you could be, uh, a pilot   

683
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:10,191
        or a submariner,        
       or an artilleryman,      

684
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:13,395
       or any damn thing,       
         but you'd be...        

685
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:16,932
   It was something exciting,   
   and it was something adult.  

686
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:19,334
        All of a sudden,        
        you could choose,       

687
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,704
   just choose to be an adult   
      by writing your name.     

688
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:28,610
 I'm working for a bank in town 
     and delivering checks.     

689
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:33,548
        I write my name,        
     and now I'm potentially    

690
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:40,922
a combat pilot, a fighter pilot,
             an ace.            

691
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:52,701
      Or I'm the commander      
         of a submarine         

692
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,037
      going into Tokyo Bay.     

693
00:47:58,741 --> 00:48:01,710
      These are incredible      
         opportunities.         

694
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,479
    You see, they're-they're    
          melodramatic,         

695
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:10,752
   exciting, like the movies.   

696
00:48:13,256 --> 00:48:15,757
      And you might do it.      

697
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,659
       So that's terrific.      

698
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,527
      It has nothing to do      
        with patriotism.        

699
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:25,233
  It has nothing to do, really, 
     with who the enemy is.     

700
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:31,173
      It's the opportunity      
  to be somebody more exciting  

701
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:33,175
      than the kid you are.     

702
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:37,179
        (Benny Goodman's        
   "Wang Wang Blues" playing)   

703
00:49:06,809 --> 00:49:09,578
        (music continues)       

704
00:49:32,735 --> 00:49:37,772
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
           I came home          
   for my Christmas holidays,   

705
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,307
   and that's when I found out  

706
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,609
     that my brother Sidney     
          had gone down         

707
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,713
  and joined the Marine Corps.  

708
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:49,918
      And then, of course,      
  life really took on meaning.  

709
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,922
             SIDNEY:            
          My father was         
     very patriotic, and...     

710
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:58,493
 I felt like really expected me 
      to join the military,     

711
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,430
     so my friend W.O. Brown    

712
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:04,566
    said, "Sid, let's go join   
    the Navy in the morning."   

713
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:06,534
       And I said, "Fine."      

714
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,469
    And the recruiting office   
           was crowded          

715
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:09,571
   like you wouldn't believe,   

716
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:14,309
         so we walked up        
    to the head of the line,    

717
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,545
         saw this Marine        
      recruiting sergeant.      

718
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:18,680
     He came over and said,     

719
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,482
        "Do you boys want       
         to kill Japs?"         

720
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:22,350
          And we said,          
     "Yeah, that's the idea,    

721
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,819
         but we're going        
       to join the Navy."       

722
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:27,422
   And he said, "No," he said,  
 "You don't belong in the Navy. 

723
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:28,857
"You belong in the Marine Corps.

724
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,692
         "You can't get         
      in the Navy, anyway,      

725
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,060
      because your parents      
          are married."         

726
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:36,464
      And we, uh, ended up      
    joining the Marine Corps.   

727
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:40,135
           KATHARINE:           
  So Sidney joined the Marines. 

728
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:44,439
  Daddy told Mother, "You might 
  as well sign the paper, Kate. 

729
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:45,874
    He's going to go anyway."   

730
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,643
    He was only 17 years old.   

731
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:51,747
 So the story in the family is, 

732
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:55,550
  the Marine recruiting officer 
       crossed the street       

733
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:59,287
    anytime in the next year    
 that he encountered my mother, 

734
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:02,624
   because she would give him   
       a piece of her mind      

735
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:08,830
    for taking her little boy   
        into the Marines.       

736
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:12,834
            NARRATOR:           
 Unlike the professional armies 
      of Germany and Japan,     

737
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:13,835
        the armed forces        

738
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,371
  that Sid Phillips and others  
         rushed to join         

739
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:21,476
   had been totally unprepared  
      to wage a world war.      

740
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:27,115
     In 1940, the U.S. Army     
        had been smaller        

741
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,184
     than that of Rumania--     

742
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,519
  only 174,000 men in uniform,  

743
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:36,457
  wearing tin hats and leggings 
   issued during World War I,   

744
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:41,096
  and carrying rifles designed  
            in 1903.            

745
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:48,870
  The Army still owned tens of  
  thousands of cavalry horses.  

746
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,239
    To make up for lost time,   

747
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:54,943
    Congress had federalized    
       the National Guard.      

748
00:51:56,812 --> 00:52:00,715
  In Luverne, 129 local boys--  

749
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,984
    members of the Minnesota    
        National Guard--        

750
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:06,187
   were called to active duty.  

751
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:13,194
 The entire town had turned out 
  at the depot to say good-bye. 

752
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:20,769
   Then, in the fall of 1940,   
   Congress enacted the draft,  

753
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:26,007
       and every young man      
    in America began to worry   

754
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,142
 when his number would come up. 

755
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:31,779
        WILLIAM PERKINS:        
   Somebody got the greetings.  

756
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,781
    Long envelope, you know.    

757
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:37,152
   And when you opened it up,   
          it would say,         

758
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,421
  "The President of the United  
    States and your neighbors   

759
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:45,160
"have selected you to be drafted
  into the Armed Forces for...  

760
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,762
     to protect the country,    
     et cetera, et cetera."     

761
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:50,498
         And I was down         
     to a friend of mine's,     

762
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,134
          Howard Lopes,         
     and he got the letter,     

763
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:55,704
      and he opened it up,      
       and he was drafted.      

764
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:59,941
      And so, boy, we just      
       laughed and roared,      

765
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,510
   and then I had to go home.   

766
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,179
 And when I walked in the house,
        my grandma says,        

767
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,215
  "There's a letter up for you  
           up there."           

768
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:11,052
      And I... so I picked      
   it up, and I looked at it.   

769
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:12,020
    And it said, "Greetings.    

770
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,623
         "The President         
      of the United States      

771
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:17,726
      I flew out the house,     
 run down the street, you know, 

772
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:19,761
       back up the street       
       where Howard lived,      

773
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:22,731
         and I walked in        
   with the paper in my hand.   

774
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:23,665
     Everybody looked at me,    

775
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,634
    and they had a good time    
            laughing,           

776
00:53:25,636 --> 00:53:26,768
   because I had been drafted.  

777
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,070
           They knew.           
   I didn't have to tell them.  

778
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:31,706
I just hold up... the letter up.

779
00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:37,512
            NARRATOR:           
      Nearly 50 million men     

780
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,615
  would register for the draft  
         during the war.        

781
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:44,252
       To serve, they had       
      to be five feet tall,     

782
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:48,489
        weigh 105 pounds,       
     have correctable vision    

783
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:51,627
 and at least half their teeth. 

784
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:55,730
      Of the 18 million men     
    examined by Army doctors,   

785
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,999
     five and a half million    
    were rejected on medical,   

786
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:01,770
  or dental, or what was called 
         moral grounds--        

787
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:05,707
  usually because they'd given  
    what the Army considered    

788
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:08,242
        the wrong answer        
        to the question,        

789
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:11,579
      "Do you like girls?"      

790
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:16,217
   At first, the men also had   
  to be able to read and write, 

791
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:18,753
        but when hundreds       
   of thousands were rejected   

792
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:22,324
         on that score,         
  the requirement was dropped,  

793
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:24,359
       and the Army set up      
         special schools        

794
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:28,263
  to make its citizen soldiers  
            literate.           

795
00:54:29,532 --> 00:54:31,833
   The goal of basic training   

796
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:36,104
 was to turn undisciplined boys 
       into fighting men,       

797
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,474
  whose comradeship and loyalty 
  to their unit would help them 

798
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:42,610
       withstand the worst      
    that battle had to offer.   

799
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:48,683
   No one who went through it   
      would ever forget it.     

800
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,219
        WALTER THOMPSON:        
        Well, I was 18--        
        I was real young.       

801
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,821
       I-I actually cried       
         the first night        

802
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:56,257
 'cause I was scared, you know? 

803
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,626
        It was strangers.       

804
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,862
   Never saw any of those guys  
           in my life.          

805
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:04,566
     From all walks of life,    
    all sizes and all shapes.   

806
00:55:04,568 --> 00:55:07,869
  And lonely for your parents,  

807
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,071
    your home, your friends.    

808
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,840
      No one in the barrack     
          that I knew.          

809
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:16,344
       And so, it was just      
        an eerie feeling        

810
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:19,347
    to be in that situation.    

811
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:24,252
            NARRATOR:           
    Despite a growing chorus    
  of protests by black citizens 

812
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:27,288
      outraged at the idea      
   of fighting bigotry abroad   

813
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,257
 while it was tolerated at home,

814
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:31,259
the military continued to insist

815
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:38,466
 on segregating African-American
servicemen into all-black units.

816
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,903
 Even blood supplies for saving 
    the lives of the wounded    

817
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:44,206
       were kept separate.      

818
00:55:45,307 --> 00:55:47,375
         WILLIE RUSHTON:        
  Oh, we thought that one day,  

819
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:51,113
   our country would be better  
         for everybody,         

820
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:54,248
          'cause I knew         
      I saw a lot of things     

821
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:56,017
that my father had to go through

822
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,685
       that I didn't have       
         to go through,         

823
00:55:57,687 --> 00:56:00,021
        so I figured that       
    when my children come on,   

824
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,256
we'd still have something better
        than what I had,        

825
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:06,093
     so that's why I wanted     
   to go fight for my country.  

826
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:18,440
         FILM ANNOUNCER:        
        For this is what        
        we are fighting.        

827
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:19,474
     Freedom's oldest enemy,    

828
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:23,644
     the passion of the few     
        to rule the many.       

829
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,613
     This isn't just a war.     

830
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:28,150
     This is a common man's     
     life-and-death struggle    

831
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:30,118
 against those who would put him
       back into slavery.       

832
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:35,090
         BURNETT MILLER:        
      You know, we had lots     
    of propaganda at films...   

833
00:56:35,824 --> 00:56:40,161
      ...showing us how bad     
          the enemy was         

834
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:42,463
   and how evil and so forth.   

835
00:56:43,265 --> 00:56:46,734
    We were all quite cynical   
          about these.          

836
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,570
           We thought,          
    these are training films.   

837
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:52,474
        It's an awful lot       
   of propaganda and baloney.   

838
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:55,777
           ANNOUNCER:           
 For the Nazi master race theory

839
00:56:55,779 --> 00:57:00,915
  calls for the complete wiping 
out of so-called inferior races.

840
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:07,389
  And in village after village, 
     local Judases point out    

841
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:09,423
     loyal Polish neighbors.    

842
00:57:10,459 --> 00:57:11,659
             MILLER:            
        We didn't believe       

843
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:16,731
      in the brand of evil      
 that they were propagandizing. 

844
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:28,576
     We didn't think we were    
   fighting to save the world.  

845
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:29,978
 But we thought that, you know, 

846
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,213
       it was our country       
      against that country,     

847
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,548
        and that country        
     had been the aggressor,    

848
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,952
    and, uh... the Japanese,    
          their allies,         

849
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,589
      had started us in it,     
      and we had to win it.     

850
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:44,726
     And it was that simple.    

851
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:49,998
  We didn't realize till later  
  how important it really was.  

852
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:59,541
       I was fairly close       
      to being a pacifist.      

853
00:58:01,043 --> 00:58:04,279
    I believed that there is    

854
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:07,148
   mostly negotiated solutions  

855
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,417
 to most problems of this sort. 

856
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:13,088
      But I couldn't fathom     
       that there was ever      

857
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:17,392
 a solution to the confrontation
     that Hitler was giving     

858
00:58:17,394 --> 00:58:20,895
to us and the rest of the world.

859
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:25,733
     I felt that I belonged     
         in the service,        

860
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:29,003
     um, because the threat,    

861
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:33,174
      while it was directed     
at the entire rest of the world,

862
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,376
    was particularly directed   

863
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:38,246
at the origins that I came from.

864
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:42,183
        (Duke Ellington's       
   "Echoes of Harlem" playing)  

865
00:58:59,535 --> 00:59:00,835
       If I didn't know it      

866
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:02,970
    at the particular moment    
           I went in,           

867
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:06,407
   13 weeks later, after I had  
   finished my basic training,  

868
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:11,011
 I knew, expertly, how to kill. 

869
00:59:11,013 --> 00:59:14,482
      Kill with a bayonet,      
       kill with a bullet,      

870
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:16,384
      kill with your hands.     

871
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,987
       Yes, I could kill.       

872
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:24,259
             HYNES:             
       I left Minneapolis       
         for the service        

873
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:28,196
      on a dank, wet, cold,     

874
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:31,666
   March Minneapolis evening.   

875
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:35,437
       My father drove me       
         to the station         

876
00:59:35,439 --> 00:59:39,174
    in the car that he almost   
       never let me drive       

877
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:41,176
           (chuckles):          
            as a kid,           

878
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:45,080
    downtown, past all the...   

879
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:47,582
  places that had been the, uh, 

880
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:51,952
    stations of my childhood    
         and growing up,        

881
00:59:51,954 --> 00:59:55,023
  to the Rock Island Railroad.  

882
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,558
          It was dark.          

883
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,394
   The long platform was dark   

884
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:04,098
          with hanging          
     arc lights at distance,    

885
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,034
       it was dark, light,      
    dark, light, dark, light.   

886
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:11,072
       And at the far end       
        was a Navy yeoman       

887
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:15,210
        with a clipboard        
  and a gathering of young men  

888
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:16,744
       or boys around him.      

889
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:21,816
         And we stopped,        
  and my father shook my hand.  

890
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:25,720
  It seemed very strange to me  
      that my father and I      

891
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,022
   were on handshaking terms.   

892
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:32,227
Then he turned around and walked
   back toward the entrance--   

893
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:34,395
    dark, light, dark, light,   
          dark, light--         

894
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,664
     and out into the street    
          and was gone.         

895
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,733
   And I turned to the yeoman   
           and went up          

896
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:41,869
      and said, "Present,"      
      when my name came up,     

897
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:44,439
     and I was in the Navy.

  <i> LIFE</i> REPORTER (dramatized):  
       February 23, 1942.       

899
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:09,397
    "Out of Poland have come    
    these appalling pictures    

900
01:01:09,399 --> 01:01:14,035
       of the end product       
      of German conquest."      

901

 rarely seen before in history."

903
01:01:25,247 --> 01:01:26,814
         "They also show        
        the kind of thing       

904
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:30,184
       "the fighting foes       
      of Nazism may expect      

905
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:32,820
  if they really lose the war." 

906
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:38,125
    "The methodical massacre    
            takes on            

907
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:40,328
"an emotional quality of sadism,

     the Nazis to the Jews."

01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:47,869
   "Herded in Polish ghettos,   
      forbidden to walk out

01:02:23,739 --> 01:02:26,040
            NARRATOR:           
      At the start of 1942,     

918
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:29,376
  almost all the news was bad.  

919
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:33,014
        The Soviet Union,       
  the United States' new ally,  

920
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:36,117
   was under unceasing attack   
        from the Germans,       

921
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,019
   who had encircled Leningrad  

922
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:40,621
    and reached the outskirts   
           of Moscow.           

923
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:45,760
         Japanese troops        
    had now taken Singapore,    

924
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,862
   the Gibraltar of the East,   

925
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:50,465
   and with it, all of Malaya.  

926
01:02:55,771 --> 01:03:00,475
     They had seized Borneo     
    and Burma and Hong Kong.    

927
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:04,044
       And they had taken       
      Guam and Wake Island,     

928
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:07,715
        Makin and Tarawa.       

929
01:03:07,717 --> 01:03:10,351
          There was not         
     a single American base     

930
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:14,121
         between Hawaii         
      and the Philippines.      

931
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:18,726
     But President Roosevelt    

932
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:21,763
   and British Prime Minister   
    Winston Churchill agreed    

933
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:25,132
     that for the time being    
    they would have to remain   

934
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:28,436
on the defensive in the Pacific.

935
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:31,105
     Germany, they decided,     

936
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:35,276
      with its vast armies      
 and mighty industrial machine, 

937
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:36,877
    was the greatest danger.    

938
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:40,881
 Victory in Europe would require

939
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:44,552
    not only the mobilization   
  of a generation of young men, 

940
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:48,056
        but also billions       
    of rounds of ammunition,    

941
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:52,927
  millions of guns, hundreds of 
thousands of tanks and airplanes

942
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:56,697
       and fleets of ships      
    to bring them to battle.    

943
01:03:56,699 --> 01:04:01,969
      Producing all of that     
        would take time.        

944
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:06,941
   Meanwhile, the survival of   
  Britain and the Soviet Union  

945
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:09,643
           depended on          
     a steady stream of food    

946
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:13,414
      and fuel and weapons      
          from America.

948
01:04:27,262 --> 01:04:31,466
          BURT WILSON:          
   When I was seven years old,  
    in Theodore Judah School,   

949
01:04:31,468 --> 01:04:35,102
       a boy from England,      
       an English refugee,      

950
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:38,205
          His name was          
  William Murgathroid Buchanan. 

951
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:41,842
    We all called him Roid--    
         Roid Buchanan.         

952
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:45,313
        And we developed        
       a great friendship.      

953
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:48,148
          And one day,          
   Roid came over to my house,  

954
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,451
       and I was upstairs,      
         and he called,         

955
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:51,485
          "Burt! Burt!"         

956
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:52,453
  And I looked out the window,  

957
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:55,322
     and I said, "Hi, Roid.     
        What's going on?"       

958
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:56,723
   And Roid said, "Do you know  

959
01:04:56,725 --> 01:05:00,160
     what a dirty German sub    
       did to my father?"       

960
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:01,128
     And I said, "No. What?"    

961
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,831
    He said, "It killed him."   

962
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:06,734
        And I-I don't...        

963
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:10,304
          I didn't know         
     how to deal with that.     

964
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,841
       I went downstairs,       

965
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:18,279
 and we sat down under the tree 
       and talked awhile.       

966
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,480
 But it was still something that

967
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:25,552
  I'd never had any experience  
   with, up until that time--   

968
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,121
     one of my best friends     
           telling me           

969
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:30,258
         that his father        
      was killed in a war.      

970
01:05:36,898 --> 01:05:41,202
            NARRATOR:           
        On the evening of       
        January 13, 1942,       

971
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:44,005
as American troops tried to stop
     the Japanese on Bataan,    

972
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:49,676
    a German U-boat surfaced    
     silently off Manhattan.    

973
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:53,947
  Its commander was astonished  
      but gratified to see      

974
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:56,517
     that more than a month     
   after Germany declared war   

975
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,718
      on the United States,     

976
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:02,457
     America's largest city     
  was still ablaze with lights. 

977
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:06,361
       Using those lights       
    to silhouette his target,   

978
01:06:06,363 --> 01:06:09,097
        he sent a torpedo       
     hissing toward the side    

979
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:11,666
  of an American oil tanker...  

980
01:06:16,438 --> 01:06:19,473
      ...then slipped back      
         beneath the sea        

981
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:23,444
         and moved south        
   in search of further prey.   

982
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:30,584
  Within 12 hours, he had sunk  
   seven more unarmed vessels.  

983
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:33,187
    The United States seemed    

984
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:37,625
       totally unprepared       
      for this kind of war.     

985
01:06:42,931 --> 01:06:46,734
  U-boats would sink 25 tankers 
      along the East Coast,     

986
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:50,871
  continuing a fierce struggle  
    for supremacy of the seas   

987
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:52,573
        called the Battle       
         of the Atlantic        

988
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:57,911
  and threatening to choke off  
        America's allies.       

989
01:06:59,514 --> 01:07:01,949
  Still, from Boston to Miami,  

990
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:06,153
city fathers stubbornly resisted
     the idea of blackouts.     

991
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:09,856
     Turning the lights off     
 would hurt tourism, they said. 

992
01:07:09,858 --> 01:07:14,829
    The last light would not    
       wink out until May.      

993
01:07:17,065 --> 01:07:18,432
         But the Germans        
        continued to sink       

994
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:21,969
  two or three merchant vessels 
           every day.           

995
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:24,705
   More than 230 Allied ships   

996
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:28,142
  and almost five million tons  
 of desperately needed matriel 

997
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:33,714
  went to the bottom of the sea 
in the first six months of 1942.

998
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:38,319
        American beaches        
      were black with oil.      

999
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:40,554
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
    All along the Gulf Coast    

1000
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:43,223
      and all on the shores     
         of Mobile Bay,         

1001
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,359
  we could go sit on the beach, 

1002
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:48,696
     but we were not allowed    
        to light a fire,        

1003
01:07:48,698 --> 01:07:51,131
     because of the U-boats.    

1004
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:55,869
    We heard often in Mobile    
      that ships were sunk      

1005
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:58,739
      just as they went out     
         of Mobile Bay.         

1006
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:00,908
  And we know this to be true,  

1007
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,545
   because the life preservers  
      and the canned goods      

1008
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:06,480
    washed up on our beaches.   

1009
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:11,151
            NARRATOR:           
     For a time, the waters     
   from Jacksonville, Florida,  

1010
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:13,120
      to Galveston, Texas,      
         were considered        

1011
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:18,725
       the most dangerous       
   shipping lane in the world.  

1012
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:22,196
      "The only safe run,"      
 said one weary merchant seaman,

1013
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:27,601
       "is from St. Louis       
         to Cincinnati."        

1014
01:08:43,118 --> 01:08:46,820
        (distant gunfire)       

1015
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:55,963
        (closer gunfire)        

1016
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:04,538
           (shouting)           

1017
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:10,044
         GLENN FRAZIER:         
         I really fought        
       the first few days       

1018
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:11,178
     for the good Old Glory.    

1019
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,347
 You know, like everybody else, 

1020
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,249
         you're saying,         
    "good old United States.    

1021
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,651
  "We're going to fight, we're  
  going to whip these Japanese  

1022
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,288
           in a matter          
  of six months," and so forth. 

1023
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:25,526
 But when it really hit me that 
 this was not a short situation 

1024
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:27,094
   and that they were hitting   
            us hard,            

1025
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:31,032
     then I think I changed     
  pretty much to protect myself 

1026
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:35,736
    and my fellow Americans,    
 and I think I was fighting more

1027
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:40,907
            NARRATOR:           
     Nearly 80,000 American     
       and Filipino troops      

1028
01:09:40,909 --> 01:09:43,643
    had managed to escape the   
     Japanese around Manila     

1029
01:09:43,645 --> 01:09:48,248
      and take up positions     
    on the Bataan Peninsula.    

1030
01:09:50,118 --> 01:09:55,790
 Once again, General MacArthur's
     planning had faltered.     

1031
01:09:55,792 --> 01:10:00,027
     Most supplies had been     
          left behind.          

1032
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:04,465
 Rations had to be cut in half. 

1033
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:09,637
     Bataan's humid forests     
    bred malarial mosquitoes.   

1034
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:12,606
Clean water was in short supply.

1035
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:14,475
    There was little medicine   
            on hand.            

1036
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:17,278
  One field hospital had eight  
       operating tables...      

1037
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:23,784
   and 1,200 battle casualties  
       in need of surgery.      

1038
01:10:29,324 --> 01:10:33,393
     Still the men struggled    
          to hold on...         

1039
01:10:34,095 --> 01:10:38,565
   ...fighting off one attack   
         after another,         

1040
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:43,970
         then retreating        
   halfway down the peninsula.  

1041
01:10:48,843 --> 01:10:52,846
  For weeks, the men on Bataan  
        continued to hope       

1042
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,715
   that rescuers were coming.   

1043
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:58,985
   Again and again, MacArthur   
     had assured them of it.    

1044
01:10:58,987 --> 01:11:01,021
      "Help is on the way,"     
          he promised.          

1045
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:05,359
            FRAZIER:            
    On the Voice of America,    
    one time, I remember it,    

1046
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:08,195
       we were getting it       
      on short-wave radio.      

1047
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,297
          It said, uh,          
   as far as the eye can see,   

1048
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,067
 there's ships and planes coming
       to the Philippines.      

1049
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:17,071
 We were told continuously that 
 we were getting reinforcements.

1050
01:11:17,073 --> 01:11:21,041
    We were told that when we   
   retreated back into Bataan,  

1051
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,710
        it would only be        
        for a few weeks.        

1052
01:11:28,249 --> 01:11:34,121
            NARRATOR:           
    But no troops, no planes    
    had ever been dispatched.   

1053
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,691
   They could not have made it  
        through, anyway.        

1054
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:42,095
   The Japanese now controlled  
       the South Pacific.       

1055
01:11:44,332 --> 01:11:48,702
  "There are times," Secretary  
  of War Henry Stimson confided 

1056
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:52,206
          to his diary,         
      "when men must die."      

1057
01:11:53,975 --> 01:11:59,380
    By early March, three out   
  of four of Bataan's defenders 

1058
01:11:59,382 --> 01:12:01,615
were incapacitated in some way--

1059
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:07,054
    sick, exhausted, wounded,   
        weak from hunger,       

1060
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:09,723
    suffering from beriberi.    

1061
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:13,794
            FRAZIER:            
  At the end, close to the end, 
   there was one can of salmon  

1062
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:15,529
        issued to 35 men        

1063
01:12:15,531 --> 01:12:18,365
          and some rice         
      and very little rice,     

1064
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:20,834
 so our situation was getting...

1065
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:24,671
 deteriorating and getting worse
           every day.           

1066
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,844
            NARRATOR:           
   MacArthur managed to leave   
   his quarters on Corregidor   

1067
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:35,682
   to visit his men on Bataan   
         precisely once.        

1068
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:41,555
       They began calling       
       him "Dugout Doug."       

1069
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:44,725
    The soldiers' bitterness    
        intensified when,       

1070
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:47,828
   acting under direct orders   
       from the president,      

1071
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:50,097
      MacArthur, his wife,      
        four-year-old son       

1072
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:52,833
   and 17 members of his staff  

1073
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:57,137
    slipped out of Corregidor   
          in a PT boat.         

1074
01:12:57,139 --> 01:13:01,408
    From Australia, he issued   
       a brief statement:       

1075
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:06,180
   "I came through," he said,   
      "and I shall return."     

1076
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:08,882
            FRAZIER:            
      When he left and went     
          to Australia,         

1077
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:11,585
       that's what I call       
      doomsday for Bataan,      

1078
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:15,021
         because we knew        
   then that we had to fight,   

1079
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:18,291
      and he issued orders      
    to fight to the last man,   

1080
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:22,062
    and that's, we knew what    
    our fate was going to be.   

1081
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,634
      (projectile whistling     
          through air)          

1082
01:13:32,073 --> 01:13:38,378
            NARRATOR:           
        On April 9, 1942,       
  Major General Edward L. King  

1083
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:42,282
     sent a soldier forward     
       with a white flag.       

1084
01:13:45,753 --> 01:13:50,124
  It was the largest surrender  
    by the United States Army   

1085
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:51,391
        in its history--        

1086
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:56,563
         78,000 American        
      and Filipino troops.      

1087
01:14:00,101 --> 01:14:05,105
  General King asked a Japanese 
   officer just one question:   

1088
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:09,143
    Would his men be treated    
            decently?           

1089
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:11,878
     Yes, said the officer.     

1090
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,881
    "We are not barbarians."    

1091
01:14:16,284 --> 01:14:20,354
   But Japanese tradition held  
   that those who surrendered   

1092
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:22,722
         rather than die        
       on the battlefield       

1093
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:27,260
          were cowards,         
      unworthy of respect.      

1094
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:37,171
   The prisoners were prodded   
           northward,           

1095
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:39,005
         300 at a time.         

1096
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:42,409
They were to walk from Mariveles
        to San Fernando,        

1097
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,144
         then be loaded         
       onto railroad cars       

1098
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:49,583
     for the journey to Camp    
   O'Donnell in central Luzon.  

1099
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:53,253
     What followed would be     
           remembered           

1100
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:56,489
   as the Bataan Death March.   

1101
01:14:58,192 --> 01:15:02,429
            FRAZIER:            
 If we had known what was ahead 
     of us at the beginning     

1102
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:07,167
 of the Bataan Death March, uh, 
    I would have taken death.   

1103
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:12,773
   It was very, very difficult  
      for us to understand,     

1104
01:15:12,775 --> 01:15:16,310
  because we had had no contact 
  with the Japanese whatsoever  

1105
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:18,845
     as to what these people    
          are all about         

1106
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:23,416
     and what they're like.     

1107
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:25,853
      And they immediately      
      started beating guys      

1108
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:30,257
   if they didn't stand right   
  or if they were sitting down. 

1109
01:15:34,629 --> 01:15:36,463
         We didn't know         
      where we were going.      

1110
01:15:36,465 --> 01:15:39,700
    We didn't know anything.    

1111
01:15:48,409 --> 01:15:50,611
 And we were stopped on the way,

1112
01:15:50,613 --> 01:15:53,213
        some of us were,        
  and searched and beat again.  

1113
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,816
     And all our possessions    
    were taken away from us.    

1114
01:15:56,818 --> 01:16:00,454
Some of them had rings that they
    just cut the fingers off    

1115
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:02,923
       and take the rings.      

1116
01:16:05,526 --> 01:16:07,761
    They poured the water out   
          of my canteen         

1117
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:11,231
    to be sure that I didn't    
      have any, any water.      

1118
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,536
    I saw them buried alive.    

1119
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:18,071
    When a guy was bayoneted    
            or shot,            

1120
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:21,474
     laying in the road and     
 the convoys were coming along, 

1121
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:25,079
  I saw trucks that would just  
       go out of their way      

1122
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,681
       to run over the guy      
   in the middle of the road.   

1123
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:31,218
  And when by the time you have 
  15 or 20 trucks run over you, 

1124
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:35,622
     you look like a smashed    
      tomato or something.      

1125
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:40,994
    And I saw people that had   
       their throats cut,       

1126
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:42,696
     because they would take    
         their bayonets         

1127
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:45,365
    and stick it out through    
the corner of the truck at night

1128
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:49,203
and it would just be high enough
      to cut their throats.     

1129
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:53,707
  And beating with a rifle butt 

1130
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:58,378
      until there just was      
      no more life in them.     

1131
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:09,622
    I saw Filipino women cut.   

1132
01:17:09,624 --> 01:17:11,592
  Their stomachs were cut open. 

1133
01:17:11,594 --> 01:17:14,494
     Their throats were cut.    

1134
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:20,167
         I saw Filipinos        
     and Americans beheaded     

1135
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:24,037
 just with one swipe of a saber.

1136
01:17:26,941 --> 01:17:30,209
       I marched six days       
and seven nights, never stopped.

1137
01:17:30,211 --> 01:17:33,480
   I did not have but one sip   
      of water and no food.     

1138
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,550
  Now, they say that you can't  
       do this, but I did.      

1139
01:17:36,552 --> 01:17:39,385
      When I got to the end     
       of the march after,      

1140
01:17:39,387 --> 01:17:43,857
  uh, at the end of the entire  
      march where I stopped     

1141
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:46,059
       to get on a train--      
    they put us on a train--    

1142
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:49,095
   my-my tongue wouldn't even   
      go back in my mouth.      

1143
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:51,264
    And if you look and talk    
     to somebody about that,    

1144
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:55,702
     they'll tell you that's    
    how close to death I was.   

1145
01:18:00,307 --> 01:18:04,745
            NARRATOR:           
     No one knows precisely     
        how many men died       

1146
01:18:04,747 --> 01:18:06,813
   on the Bataan Death March--  

1147
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:13,854
   somewhere between 6,000 and  
 11,000 Filipinos and Americans.

1148
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:17,056
  And at the end of the march,  

1149
01:18:17,058 --> 01:18:21,528
         Camp O'Donnell         
       provided no relief.      

1150
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,930
          An unfinished         
      Philippine Army base,     

1151
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:27,567
    surrounded by barbed wire   
     and machine gun towers,    

1152
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:30,069
        with little water       
and little shelter from the sun,

1153
01:18:30,071 --> 01:18:37,911
 it would eventually hold nearly
60,000 miserable, desperate men.

1154
01:18:37,913 --> 01:18:42,816
   Food was nothing but lugao,  
        watery rice soup        

1155
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:45,452
 filled with weevils and worms. 

1156
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:48,254
 It was best to try and swallow 
         it after dark,         

1157
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:53,527
        one man recalled,       
so as not to have to look at it.

1158
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:58,499
   Some 16,000 more Filipinos   
     and Americans would die    

1159
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:03,503
       at Camp O'Donnell--      
  of dehydration, malnutrition, 

1160
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:11,978
   malaria, beriberi, scurvy,   
    dysentery, hopelessness.    

1161
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:20,020
      "Their bodies went by     
     in an endless column,"     

1162
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:21,188
    one sergeant remembered.    

1163
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:26,927
    "Day and night, they were   
    carried to the cemetery."   

1164
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:30,297
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
  We had all been so distressed 

1165
01:19:30,299 --> 01:19:34,401
     about leaving our boys     
       in the Philippines.      

1166
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:37,971
  There was no way of rescuing  
       them, we know now,       

1167
01:19:37,973 --> 01:19:41,942
 but at the time, we didn't know
    that there were no ships.   

1168
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:45,578
  Remember, they didn't tell us 
     how much had been sunk     

1169
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,648
        at Pearl Harbor,        
      and we kept thinking,     

1170
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,483
   "Why don't you go in there   

1171
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:54,687
        and get the boys        
    out of the Philippines?"    

1172
01:19:56,257 --> 01:20:02,796
            NARRATOR:           
     One day, Glenn Frazier     
 volunteered for burial detail. 

1173
01:20:04,198 --> 01:20:07,134
            FRAZIER:            
On some days, we buried 250 men,

1174
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:12,572
  so I didn't know but what one 
  day that might happen to me.  

1175
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:16,810
         So my idea was         
   I had two sets of dog tags.  

1176
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,444
      And I said to myself,     

1177
01:20:18,446 --> 01:20:22,349
 "Well, I think I'll just throw 
  one of these sets of dog tags 

1178
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:28,288
  "in the mass grave, so if I'm 
    alive when the war ends,    

1179
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:29,523
      there's no problem."      

1180
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:33,026
   But if I'm missing or dead,  
 I didn't... I wanted my family 

1181
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:36,963
   to know and have some kind   
    of ending, and so forth,    

1182
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:39,866
 so they would think that I was 
         in this grave.         

1183
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:42,802
      (artillery explosion)     

1184
01:20:44,171 --> 01:20:46,706
            NARRATOR:           
         On May 6, 1942,        

1185
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:53,046
  Corregidor, the last American 
 stronghold in the Philippines, 

1186
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:56,249
      fell to the Japanese.     

1187
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:04,524
     (men speaking Japanese)    

1188
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:16,002
        (seagulls cawing)       

1189
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:19,105
     (distant foghorn blows)    

1190
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:23,877
           SAM HYNES:           
   I went to Seattle in 1942.   

1191
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:27,013
           One memory           
    is very clear and strong.   

1192
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:33,253
 It's a Saturday, and I'm taking
  a bus into the center of town 

1193
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:35,255
  and across the public square  

1194
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:39,325
   in front of the town hall,   
        I guess it is...        

1195
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:40,460
      And I see ahead of me     

1196
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:44,598
    a line of people standing   
    patiently by a bus stop.    

1197
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:49,670
  And as I approach, I see that 
      they're all Japanese      

1198
01:21:49,672 --> 01:21:52,439
    and that they're getting    
           onto buses.          

1199
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:56,909
  And I realize that these are  
 the Japanese-American citizens 

1200
01:21:56,911 --> 01:22:01,847
 of Seattle and the neighborhood
     who are being sent off     

1201
01:22:01,849 --> 01:22:05,785
        to what amounted        
    to a concentration camp.    

1202
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:09,489
          And I think,          
  "Well, those are my enemies." 

1203
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:12,159
But they don't look like enemies
         standing there         

1204
01:22:12,161 --> 01:22:16,329
    in their American clothes   
 with their cardboard suitcases 

1205
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:20,366
     waiting to be sent off     
        into the desert.        

1206
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:25,238
            NARRATOR:           
      On February 19, 1942,     

1207
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:31,777
 President Roosevelt had signed 
      Executive Order 9066.     

1208
01:22:31,779 --> 01:22:34,447
 Its tone was carefully neutral.

1209
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:39,820
It authorized the War Department
  to designate "military areas" 

1210
01:22:39,822 --> 01:22:42,455
        and then exclude        
        anyone from them        

1211
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:45,291
  whom it felt to be a danger.  

1212
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:51,130
 But it had a specific target...

1213
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:55,201
 ...the more than 110,000 people
      of Japanese ancestry      

1214
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:59,506
  living along the West Coast.  

1215
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:01,341
  They were about to be forced  

1216
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:06,379
        from their homes        
        and moved inland.       

1217
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:10,216
 Thousands of German and Italian
   aliens were also locked up,  

1218
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:13,887
     but millions of German-    
  and Italian-American citizens 

1219
01:23:13,889 --> 01:23:19,926
   remained free to live their  
    lives as they always had.   

1220
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:23,029
     Only Japanese-Americans    
        on the West Coast       

1221
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:25,599
        were singled out.       

1222
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:28,734
        "A Jap's a Jap,"        
   said General John L. DeWitt  

1223
01:23:28,736 --> 01:23:31,404
        of the West Coast       
        Defense Command.        

1224
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:32,839
     "It makes no difference    

1225
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:35,675
   "whether he is an American   
         citizen or not.        

1226
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:38,678
   I don't want any of them."   

1227
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,882
     Almost no one protested    
     the government's plan,     

1228
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:46,319
      which also classified     
     all Japanese-Americans     

1229
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:48,955
 as unfit for military service. 

1230
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:52,058
         DANIEL INOUYE:         
     1-A is physically fit,     

1231
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:55,128
            and 4-F,            
   something's wrong with you.  

1232
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:57,697
   But 4-C means enemy alien.   

1233
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,834
And here I was, 17 years of age.

1234
01:24:00,836 --> 01:24:05,738
       I considered myself      
   a good American but, uh...   

1235
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:08,407
       made into an enemy.      

1236
01:24:17,785 --> 01:24:23,023
            NARRATOR:           
    In Sacramento, soon after   
     Order 9066 was issued,     

1237
01:24:23,025 --> 01:24:26,026
   hand-lettered signs went up  
         all over town,         

1238
01:24:26,028 --> 01:24:30,396
     saying "Japs must go."     

1239
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:34,367
       The orders to leave      
         arrived in May.        

1240
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:38,938
   Susumu Satow and his family  
   could scarcely believe it.   

1241
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:42,842
         They were given        
       one week's notice.       

1242
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:44,611
          It was middle         
      of the harvest and...     

1243
01:24:44,613 --> 01:24:49,849
      but still, yet we had     
    to abandon it and leave.    

1244
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:55,088
   And so, of course, we made   
  arrangement with our friends. 

1245
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,490
       "Hey, come and pick      
        the strawberries        

1246
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,893
       because it's ready       
        to be marketed."        

1247
01:24:59,895 --> 01:25:03,329
 And so I imagine they did that.

1248
01:25:05,832 --> 01:25:07,733
          BURT WILSON:          
    There was an area of town   

1249
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:11,504
   here in Sacramento that was  
mostly where the Japanese lived.

1250
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:14,907
     And it was empty almost    
           overnight.           

1251
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:18,711
   And we wondered, you know,   
         what happened?         

1252
01:25:19,847 --> 01:25:22,548
       They took somebody       
      out of eighth grade,      

1253
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:26,753
     a Japanese boy who did     
       wonderful cartoons.      

1254
01:25:26,755 --> 01:25:31,357
    And one day he was there,   
  and the next day he was gone. 

1255
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:34,628
   And that was very difficult  
      for us to understand,     

1256
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:38,131
   because we didn't see Sammy  
        or any Japanese--       

1257
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:43,603
     at least I didn't-- any    
 Japanese-American as the enemy.

1258
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:51,277
      (train whistle blows)     

1259
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,713
             SATOW:             
    We were allowed to bring    

1260
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:55,748
    whatever you could carry,   
           that's it.           

1261
01:25:55,750 --> 01:26:01,854
 And so you put just essentials 
        in your suitcase.       

1262
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:03,189
      You know, first day,      

1263
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:06,659
   when we had to pack up our   
   things and go to the train,  

1264
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:10,496
       I really wondered,       
  what's going to happen to us? 

1265
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:13,099
You know, that, uh, this is just
          the beginning         

1266
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:18,471
   and, uh, they may very well  
     send us back to Japan.     

1267
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:23,376
 And that, to me, was horrible. 

1268
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:28,481
 I, in my heart, knew my loyalty
       belongs to America.      

1269
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:32,318
    I went to school, pledged   
    allegiance every morning    

1270
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,821
 in grammar school and so forth.

1271
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:37,189
       And for me to think      

1272
01:26:37,191 --> 01:26:43,195
   that I may be sent to Japan  
     was... was horrendous.     

1273

            NARRATOR:           
     Asako Tokuno was still     
           a freshman           

1274
01:26:47,269 --> 01:26:48,301
    at Berkeley that spring.    

1275
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:52,439
 Her parents and her grandfather
      were evacuated first,     

1276
01:26:52,441 --> 01:26:55,641
   because they had been born   
            in Japan.           

1277
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:59,312
       She and her sister       
   were left behind for a time  

1278
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:03,850
            to close            
   the family flower business.  

1279
01:27:03,852 --> 01:27:05,318
     We all somehow gathered    
          the flowers,          

1280
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,353
    bunched them and got them   
         to the market,         

1281
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:08,788
      to the flower market      
        in San Francisco.       

1282
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:11,090
   And so we were able to keep  
       the business going.      

1283
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:14,060
 And all those flowers didn't go
       to waste, you know.      

1284
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:17,163
  They were just in the height  
         of their beauty        

1285
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:18,631
    at that time of the year,   

1286
01:27:18,633 --> 01:27:21,835
          getting ready         
for Easter and all the holidays.

1287
01:27:23,370 --> 01:27:26,172
        We were really...       
  kind of caught in the middle  

1288
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:29,642
 when the war happened, although
  no question about our loyalty 

1289
01:27:29,644 --> 01:27:32,312
    to our country, you know,   
        and how we felt.        

1290
01:27:32,314 --> 01:27:33,779
        (voice breaking):       
      This is our country,      

1291
01:27:33,781 --> 01:27:36,182
 and when this whole evacuation 
     thing happened, I mean,    

1292
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:39,785
 it was like we had no country, 
  because we weren't from Japan 

1293
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:45,458
    and they took away our...   
      our rights, actually.     

1294
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:48,027
   We couldn't protest, and we  
    wouldn't have protested,    

1295
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:51,731
    because we had to do what   
  the government told us to do. 

1296
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:56,002
 And so, uh, I think our parents
      realized, of course,      

1297
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:57,803
      they were, you know,      
          not citizens,         

1298
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:00,039
        so they accepted        
        the whole thing.        

1299
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:03,176
           But for us,          
  I think it was a lot harder,  

1300
01:28:03,178 --> 01:28:06,045
 the fact that we had no rights.

     Action pictures made by    
  Movietone cameraman Al Brick, 

1305
01:28:35,776 --> 01:28:39,412
 when a big enemy invasion fleet
  drove to seize Midway Island  

1306
01:28:39,414 --> 01:28:40,479
    and was heavily defeated.   

1307
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:43,849
   A hostile cruiser on fire,   
       bombed and ablaze,       

1308
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:46,819
  filmed from an American plane 
           as it lies           

1309
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:48,988
         like a smoking         
       volcano on the sea.      

1310
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,890
    One of the greatest blows   
        of devastation...       

1311
01:28:50,892 --> 01:28:57,796
            NARRATOR:           
   By June of 1942, Americans   
  were desperate for good news. 

1312
01:28:57,798 --> 01:28:58,831
   And the victory at Midway--  

1313
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:02,335
the westernmost of the inhabited
       Hawaiian Islands--       

1314
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,838
   was just what they had been  
          waiting for.          

1315
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:10,343
       It turned out to be      
        a great triumph,        

1316
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:15,715
     but it had almost been     
        a total disaster.       

1317
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:18,718
 The Japanese had hoped to smash
          what was left         

1318
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:24,023
   of the Pacific Fleet, take   
 Hawaii, hold its people hostage

1319
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:27,793
   and force the United States  
        to sue for peace.       

1320
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:32,999
   But American cryptographers  
   had deciphered their plans,  

1321
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:36,436
          and the Navy          
      was waiting for them.     

1322
01:29:36,438 --> 01:29:40,205
  Still, when the battle began, 

1323
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:43,709
   all but six of the first 41  
    American torpedo-bombers    

1324
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:50,583
   sent to attack the Japanese  
     fleet were shot down...    

1325
01:29:50,585 --> 01:29:55,921
 ...without scoring a single hit
     on the enemy warships.     

1326
01:29:57,324 --> 01:30:00,126
 But then, American dive bombers

1327
01:30:00,128 --> 01:30:04,830
          swooped down          
   on four Japanese carriers.   

1328
01:30:11,938 --> 01:30:18,277
And eventually, all four of them
         were destroyed.        

1329
01:30:25,986 --> 01:30:30,623
 Midway marked the first defeat 
      for the Japanese Navy     

1330
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:33,860
          in 350 years.

     Hollywood's most famous    
           movie stars          

1334
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:47,406
 leave the film capital to help 
 the government sell war bonds. 

1335
01:30:47,408 --> 01:30:51,276
The country has asked the people
   to invest a billion dollars  

1336
01:30:51,278 --> 01:30:53,713
    in one month to help pay    
          for the war.          

1337
01:30:53,715 --> 01:30:55,014
      And here's the start      
          of the drive.         

1338
01:30:55,016 --> 01:30:57,950
        They'll tour 300        
   cities from coast to coast.  

1339
01:30:57,952 --> 01:30:59,652
    This is the people's way    
           of saying,           

1340
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:02,655
      "From the home front      
       to the battlefront,      

1341
01:31:02,657 --> 01:31:04,623
        "from movie stars       
        to sales clerks,        

1342
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:09,862
 America's 130 million citizens 
        are in the war."        

1343
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:15,468
  The war-- the single greatest 
       coordinated effort       

1344
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,636
      in American history--     

1345
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:22,775
    would eventually cost the   
  United States $304 billion-?  

1346
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:27,447
more than three trillion dollars
        in today's terms.       

1347
01:31:27,449 --> 01:31:31,551
        Taxes alone could       
      never pay for it all.     

1348
01:31:31,553 --> 01:31:35,621
     That required a series     
   of annual War Bond drives.   

1349
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:39,692
        The whole country       
          got involved.         

1350
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:44,931
   In Mobile, John Cottingham,  
   a worker at Brookley Field,  

1351
01:31:44,933 --> 01:31:48,868
  invested all but eight cents  
   of his paycheck each month   

1352
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:50,402
          in war bonds.         

1353
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:55,441
   The Black Bears, the local   
   Negro League baseball team,  

1354
01:31:55,443 --> 01:32:00,979
      staged a doubleheader     
      that raised $100,000.     

1355
01:32:00,981 --> 01:32:04,317
          The citizens          
    of Sacramento were asked    

1356
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:07,453
       to buy $16 million       
         worth of bonds         

1357
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:08,821
  during one particular drive.  

1358
01:32:08,823 --> 01:32:14,726
   They were told it would pay  
   for 96 minutes of the war.   

1359
01:32:17,497 --> 01:32:21,100
  In Waterbury, bonds were sold 
      from "Liberty House,"     

1360
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:23,636
      set up in the middle      
        of the town green       

1361
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:24,937
 on the site where similar bonds

1362
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:27,339
          had been sold         
     to help defeat Germany     

1363
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:29,441
   during the First World War.  

1364
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:33,812
    People turned out to gaze   
   at a giant barrage balloon,  

1365
01:32:33,814 --> 01:32:39,051
      to see a German plane     
that had been shot from the sky,

01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:28,094
       steadily advancing       
         across Russia.         

1394
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:33,065
      Millions of civilians     
       and soldiers died.       

1395
01:34:35,902 --> 01:34:40,039
  Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin  
  was demanding that the Allies 

1396
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:42,875
        immediately open        
   a second front in the west   

1397
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:46,378
     to relieve the pressure    
   on his beleaguered people.   

1398
01:34:49,549 --> 01:34:54,086
   not a single Allied soldier  
   fighting in Western Europe,  

1399
01:34:54,088 --> 01:34:57,356
     and there would not be     
        for a long time.        

1400
01:35:02,195 --> 01:35:04,764
   They simply weren't ready.   

1401
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:10,102
        American planners       
   had a straightforward idea   

1402
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:11,570
   of how to beat the Germans:  

1403
01:35:11,572 --> 01:35:15,441
          invade France         
      in the spring of 1943     

1404
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:18,544
   and drive right for Berlin.  

1405
01:35:19,712 --> 01:35:23,583
    But the British were wary   
       of moving too fast.      

1406
01:35:23,585 --> 01:35:27,086
 "A defeat on the French coast,"
    Winston Churchill warned,   

1407
01:35:27,088 --> 01:35:31,690
  was "the only way in which we 
 could possibly lose this war." 

1408
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:34,526
  Instead, he favored attacking 

1409
01:35:34,528 --> 01:35:39,798
    German and Italian forces   
        in North Africa.        

1410
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:46,371
       American commanders      
     thought invading Africa    

1411
01:35:46,373 --> 01:35:51,477
      would be a dangerous      
    and wasteful diversion...   

1412
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:54,112
 ...but Congressional elections 
         were coming up.        

1413
01:35:54,114 --> 01:35:55,748
   American voters were eager   

1414
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:59,718
    for more offensive action   
        against the Axis.       

1415
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:04,557
       President Roosevelt      
     overruled his generals.    

1416
01:36:04,559 --> 01:36:08,627
 The invasion of occupied France
        would be delayed.       

1417
01:36:09,963 --> 01:36:12,764
 Instead, preparations were made
       for American troops      

1418
01:36:12,766 --> 01:36:18,504
     to land in North Africa    
       at the end of 1942.      

1419
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:22,975
   A bitter General George C.   
 Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, 

1420
01:36:22,977 --> 01:36:26,045
     wrote privately that he    
    and his fellow commanders   

1421
01:36:26,047 --> 01:36:29,615
       had "failed to see       
 that the leader in a democracy 

1422
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:33,052
           has to keep          
    the people entertained."    

1423
01:36:36,856 --> 01:36:40,660
       ("American Patrol"       
    by Glenn Miller playing)    

1424
01:36:56,876 --> 01:37:01,881
        SIDNEY PHILLIPS:        
 I did notice repeatedly during 
   the war that there would be  

1425
01:37:01,883 --> 01:37:05,817
        a sense of pride        
   in what you were a part of.  

1426
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:09,621
         You would feel         
   the power of the military.   

1427
01:37:09,623 --> 01:37:14,126
    You would feel the power    
   of the convoy you were in,   

1428
01:37:14,128 --> 01:37:18,297
        the warships that       
      were surrounding you,     

1429
01:37:18,299 --> 01:37:22,268
      the weapons that you      
      were responsible for.     

1430
01:37:23,069 --> 01:37:25,737
    It was a strange feeling.   

1431
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:27,406
        You knew you were       
        in great danger,        

1432
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:28,974
    but you somehow felt safe   

1433
01:37:28,976 --> 01:37:35,214
     in that you were a part    
 of this great, powerful group. 

1434
01:37:37,383 --> 01:37:40,586
            NARRATOR:           
    In early August of 1942,    

1435
01:37:40,588 --> 01:37:43,689
     Private Sidney Phillips    
       of Mobile, Alabama,      

1436
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:46,992
       and the 19,000 men       
  of the First Marine Division  

1437
01:37:46,994 --> 01:37:49,294
           steamed out          
   of Wellington, New Zealand,  

1438
01:37:49,296 --> 01:37:52,498
       in a large convoy,       
       including all three      

1439
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:55,667
      of America's carriers     
      in the South Pacific.     

1440
01:38:02,976 --> 01:38:07,312
        Their target was        
     so remote, so obscure,     

1441
01:38:07,314 --> 01:38:12,350
   that some of their officers  
  had trouble saying its name.  

1442
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:16,488
  But that summer, Guadalcanal, 
      a 90-mile-long island     

1443
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:18,657
       at the eastern end       
      of the Solomon chain,     

1444
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:22,227
    covered with dense jungle   
    and coconut plantations,    

1445
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:24,063
       had suddenly become      

1446
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:28,534
  one of the most strategically 
 important spots in the Pacific.

1447
01:38:28,536 --> 01:38:30,002
      Two separate commands     

1448
01:38:30,004 --> 01:38:34,673
     had the task of pushing    
       back the Japanese.       

1449
01:38:34,675 --> 01:38:36,141
    General Douglas MacArthur   

1450
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:38,977
         was in command         
  of the Southwestern Pacific,  

1451
01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:40,946
        assigned to drive       
         from New Guinea        

1452
01:38:40,948 --> 01:38:44,716
     toward the Philippines     
          and Formosa.          

1453
01:38:44,718 --> 01:38:47,252
    Admiral Chester W. Nimitz   
      would use the Marines     

1454
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:52,123
   to climb a longer ladder--   
 up the Solomons, the Gilberts, 

1455
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:54,192
  the Marshalls, the Marianas,  

1456
01:38:54,194 --> 01:38:58,063
      the Volcano Islands,      
           the Ryukus.          

1457
01:38:58,065 --> 01:39:02,200
         He would begin         
        in the Solomons.        

1458
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:06,337
 The Japanese had made landings 
  there, and construction crews 

1459
01:39:06,339 --> 01:39:11,343
        were hard at work       
 on an airstrip on Guadalcanal. 

1460
01:39:11,345 --> 01:39:13,778
      If they were allowed      
         to complete it,        

1461
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:16,648
       Japanese warplanes       
 could choke off shipping lanes 

1462
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:19,584
    between the United States   
          and Australia         

1463
01:39:19,586 --> 01:39:25,490
       and make the Allied      
      campaign impossible.      

1464
01:39:26,693 --> 01:39:30,729
     The Marines, including     
    17-year-old Sid Phillips,   

1465
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:35,734
        now a mortarman,        
   had been sent to stop them.  

1466
01:39:37,003 --> 01:39:41,340
   Their commander had assumed  
 his green troops would receive 

1467
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:45,610
 another six months of training 
     before they saw combat.    

1468
01:39:45,612 --> 01:39:46,811
         They were armed        

1469
01:39:46,813 --> 01:39:49,748
      with old single-shot,     
       bolt-action rifles.      

1470
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:52,251
     They had only ten days'    
      worth of ammunition,      

1471
01:39:52,253 --> 01:39:55,854
  and in order to get them into 
 the fight as fast as possible, 

1472
01:39:55,856 --> 01:40:01,460
  their supply stocks had been  
   reduced from 90 days to 60.  

1473
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:06,398
        The men called it       
     "Operation Shoestring."    

1474
01:40:13,572 --> 01:40:16,274
     (projectiles whistling     
          through air)          

1475
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:21,846
   At dawn on August 7, 1942,   

1476
01:40:21,848 --> 01:40:24,516
      American land forces      
      went on the offensive     

1477
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:26,818
       for the first time       
    in the Second World War.    

1478
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:31,456
  No one had any idea how long, 
           how bloody           

1479
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:36,828
and how consequential the battle
    for Guadalcanal would be.   

1480
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:41,099
      Sid Phillips' platoon     
   was part of the second wave  

1481
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:43,735
    of Marines to go ashore.    

1482
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:45,937
  "We had been repeatedly told  

1483
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:47,038
    "this would be the first    

1484
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,041
          ship-to-shore         
    landing," he remembered,    

1485
01:40:49,043 --> 01:40:53,745
     "and nobody could more     
   than guess if such an idea   

1486
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:59,584
    "We braced ourselves, and   
 the craft slid up on the beach.

1487
01:40:59,586 --> 01:41:03,955
      We charged out, ready     
  to do or die," Phillips said, 

1488
01:41:03,957 --> 01:41:09,761
  "and there was the first wave 
    sitting, laughing at us."   

1489
01:41:10,897 --> 01:41:14,266
       There was virtually      
         no opposition.         

1490
01:41:14,268 --> 01:41:19,370
   The first American casualty  
   on Guadalcanal was a Marine  

1491
01:41:19,372 --> 01:41:21,540
        who cut his hand        
         with a machete,        

1492
01:41:21,542 --> 01:41:24,910
    trying to open a coconut.   

1493
01:41:25,812 --> 01:41:28,480
        The Marines moved       
         off the beach.         

1494
01:41:30,716 --> 01:41:33,618
      A combat photographer     
       caught Sid Phillips      

1495
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:35,954
       relieving himself.       

1496
01:41:37,857 --> 01:41:42,294
            PHILLIPS:           
        There were times        
        of sheer boredom        

1497
01:41:42,296 --> 01:41:45,730
    and just plain hard work.   

1498
01:41:45,732 --> 01:41:49,334
       The war is actually      
    planned by the officers,    

1499
01:41:49,336 --> 01:41:51,069
        but it is fought        
        by the privates,        

1500
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:56,507
     and the privates do 99%    
      of all the hard work.     

1501
01:41:56,509 --> 01:41:59,344
            NARRATOR:           
        Americans seized        
     the unfinished airstrip    

1502
01:41:59,346 --> 01:42:02,948
 with little trouble and renamed
      it "Henderson Field"      

1503
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,350
      after a Marine pilot      
         who was killed         

1504
01:42:05,352 --> 01:42:06,351
  during the Battle of Midway.  

1505
01:42:06,353 --> 01:42:10,889
    They began to prepare it    
       for American planes      

1506
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:14,893
      with signs that read      
     "Under New Management."    

1507
01:42:14,895 --> 01:42:18,197
        Their orders were       
 to hold the field at all cost. 

1508
01:42:18,199 --> 01:42:24,035
       The enemy couldn't       
    be allowed to retake it.    

1509
01:42:24,037 --> 01:42:26,505
 Then... the Japanese attacked. 

1510
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:33,212
   The American fleet offshore  
     was their first target.    

1511
01:42:33,214 --> 01:42:38,016
            PHILLIPS:           
    The Japanese Navy came in   
  and sank all of our escorts.  

1512
01:42:38,018 --> 01:42:41,153
        (artillery fire)        

1513
01:42:50,630 --> 01:42:53,398
            NARRATOR:           
 Four heavy cruisers were lost, 

1514
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:58,403
   along with more than 1,800   
        American sailors.       

1515
01:42:58,405 --> 01:43:01,206
 our supply ships, too, but they
    didn't-- it was at night,   

1516
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:04,342
      and they didn't know      
  how successful they had been. 

1517
01:43:04,344 --> 01:43:07,412
        But the next day,       
    all of our supplies left,   

1518
01:43:07,414 --> 01:43:11,049
  and we were... we were there  
     without ever unloading     

1519
01:43:11,051 --> 01:43:15,653
  even our ten days of supplies 
 that we had brought in with us.

1520
01:43:15,655 --> 01:43:19,024
 We would have starved to death 
    if there hadn't have been   

1521
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:22,794
          a big supply          
     of Japanese rice there.    

1522
01:43:25,798 --> 01:43:28,733
            NARRATOR:           
           The Marines          
     found themselves alone     

1523
01:43:28,735 --> 01:43:32,904
  and began to wonder if they,  
     like the men on Bataan,    

1524
01:43:32,906 --> 01:43:37,074
   had simply been abandoned.   

1525
01:43:37,076 --> 01:43:38,743
            (gunfire)           

1526
01:43:38,745 --> 01:43:41,079
         With no support        
    from the sea or the air,    

1527
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:44,516
      the men were strafed      
       and bombed daily...      

1528
01:43:49,555 --> 01:43:52,023
      ...pounded by shells      
  from Japanese ships offshore  

1529
01:43:52,025 --> 01:43:54,793
        and under attack        
        from enemy troops       

1530
01:43:54,795 --> 01:43:57,963
      hidden in the jungle.     

1531
01:43:57,965 --> 01:44:01,499
            PHILLIPS:           
       We understood that       
     we might be expendable.    

1532
01:44:01,501 --> 01:44:03,468
          It had become         
 sort of the established thing, 

1533
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:09,774
  and, uh, we knew our country  
 was not yet, uh, heavily armed.

1534
01:44:09,776 --> 01:44:14,545
    And yes, we did, uh, feel   
  that we might be expendable.  

1535
01:44:14,547 --> 01:44:15,680
         We really did.         

1536
01:44:15,682 --> 01:44:17,215
       (automatic gunfire)      

1537
01:44:17,217 --> 01:44:19,584
  (bomb whistling through air)  

1538
01:44:32,398 --> 01:44:36,034
            NARRATOR:           
       Phillips was among       
 those sent out to help recover 

1539
01:44:36,036 --> 01:44:40,271
      the bodies of Marines     
   killed in an enemy ambush.   

1540
01:44:40,273 --> 01:44:45,243
            PHILLIPS:           
 And it was about five miles out
       to the ambush site.      

1541
01:44:45,245 --> 01:44:49,448
    Well, the American bodies   
       had been mutilated.      

1542
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:51,817
 They had been beheaded and, uh,

1543
01:44:51,819 --> 01:44:56,087
     had their genitals, uh,    
 stuffed in their mouths, and...

1544
01:44:56,089 --> 01:44:59,391
        (artillery fire,        
        gunfire continue)       

1545
01:44:59,393 --> 01:45:02,294
          our battalion         
      never took a prisoner     

1546
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:03,929
   that I know of after that.   

1547
01:45:03,931 --> 01:45:06,331
           I really...          
     I really don't remember    

1548
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:08,666
  that we ever took a prisoner. 

1549
01:45:08,668 --> 01:45:11,069
        (artillery fire)        

1550
01:45:17,242 --> 01:45:20,278
            (gunfire)           

1551
01:45:32,025 --> 01:45:35,160
            NARRATOR:           
      On the late afternoon     
          of August 20,         

1552
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:38,730
     (aircraft approaching)     
     after 13 harrowing days    
         on the island,         

1553
01:45:38,732 --> 01:45:41,900
    Phillips heard the sound    
     of approaching aircraft    

1554
01:45:41,902 --> 01:45:43,568
    and took cover as usual.    

1555
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:47,205
         But this time,         
    the planes were American.   

1556
01:45:47,207 --> 01:45:50,141
       (man whistling)          
      The Marines cheered.      

1557
01:45:50,143 --> 01:45:52,444
   They were no longer alone.   

1558
01:45:52,446 --> 01:45:55,780
            PHILLIPS:           
    It looked like Uncle Sam    
       <i> was</i> going to fight      

1559
01:45:55,782 --> 01:45:59,417
    for that miserable place,   
           after all.           

1560
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:03,187
        (distant gunfire)       

1561
01:46:03,189 --> 01:46:06,524
            NARRATOR:           
        But at 2:00 a.m.        
        the next morning,       

1562
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:09,528
   just hours after the first   
    American planes arrived,    

1563
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:13,598
      a Japanese commander      
      sent 900 fresh troops     

1564
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,234
    against Marine positions    
     along the western bank     

1565
01:46:16,236 --> 01:46:19,704
   of a twisting jungle creek.  

1566
01:46:19,706 --> 01:46:23,074
   Its name was the Ilu River,  
      but because the maps      

1567
01:46:23,076 --> 01:46:25,877
   the Marines had been issued  
          had it wrong,         

1568
01:46:25,879 --> 01:46:28,312
      the fierce firefight      
          that followed         

1569
01:46:28,314 --> 01:46:32,517
       would be remembered      
  as the Battle of the Tenaru.  

1570
01:46:32,519 --> 01:46:35,220
        (artillery fire)        

1571
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:37,556
            PHILLIPS:           
          At that time          
         on Guadalcanal,        

1572
01:46:37,558 --> 01:46:40,225
       almost every night       
    there would be some event   

1573
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:44,396
   that would arouse everyone,  
   would keep everyone awake.   

1574
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:46,565
But this night it was different.

1575
01:46:46,567 --> 01:46:49,067
    The whole world erupted,    

1576
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:54,639
   and, uh... the lines became  
      just a wall of fire.      

1577
01:46:54,641 --> 01:46:57,508
 We knew it was the real event. 

1578
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:00,712
            NARRATOR:           
     The Japanese commander     
         was so certain         

1579
01:47:00,714 --> 01:47:02,080
  he could destroy the Marines  

1580
01:47:02,082 --> 01:47:06,852
    that in his diary he had    
filled in the entry for the day:

1581
01:47:06,854 --> 01:47:08,386
           "21 August.          

1582
01:47:08,388 --> 01:47:11,689
  Enjoy the fruits of victory." 

1583
01:47:13,059 --> 01:47:16,127
    The Japanese kept coming    
           all night.           

1584
01:47:16,129 --> 01:47:17,795
    "Banzai," they screamed.    

1585
01:47:17,797 --> 01:47:19,564
       "Marine, you die!"       

1586
01:47:20,433 --> 01:47:23,468
 The Marines just kept shooting.

1587
01:47:23,470 --> 01:47:25,504
     (gunfire, echoed yells)    

1588
01:47:25,506 --> 01:47:27,972
       (gunfire continues)      

1589
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:34,879
            PHILLIPS:           
       We killed, I think,      
        over 900 Japanese       

1590
01:47:34,881 --> 01:47:38,250
     and lost something like    
           34 Marines.          

1591
01:47:38,252 --> 01:47:42,920
      So it did our morale      
      a great deal of good.     

1592
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:49,561
            NARRATOR:           
       For the first time,      

1593
01:47:49,563 --> 01:47:55,366
    the supposedly invincible   
 Imperial Army had been stopped.

1594
01:47:55,368 --> 01:47:57,902
    The humiliated commander,   

1595
01:47:57,904 --> 01:48:01,773
   who had predicted victory,   
          shot himself.         

1596
01:48:03,676 --> 01:48:09,714
  But the Battle of the Tenaru  
 settled nothing on Guadalcanal.

1597
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:14,652
     Japanese reinforcements    
     poured onto the island,    

1598
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:18,456
        and the fighting        
      just went on and on.      

1599
01:48:20,259 --> 01:48:22,994
            (gunfire)           

1600
01:48:27,333 --> 01:48:31,302
          A confusing,          
      vicious war of ambush     

1601
01:48:31,304 --> 01:48:33,537
       and counterattack.       

1602
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:35,340
       A terrifying world       

1603
01:48:35,342 --> 01:48:38,610
  where random Japanese shells  
          would explode         

1604
01:48:38,612 --> 01:48:42,547
      among the entrenched      
    and embattled Americans.    

1605
01:48:47,786 --> 01:48:49,454
            PHILLIPS:           
     Some men could take it,    

1606
01:48:49,456 --> 01:48:54,826
  and, uh, some just physically 
       could not take it.       

1607
01:48:54,828 --> 01:48:58,129
   The sheer terror of knowing  
        that the next one       

1608
01:48:58,131 --> 01:49:00,798
        is going to have        
        your name on it--       

1609
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,335
        when that goes on       
      and on and on and on,     

1610
01:49:04,337 --> 01:49:07,805
         you... you get         
        a strange feeling       

1611
01:49:07,807 --> 01:49:10,775
        in which you seem       
       to become detached,      

1612
01:49:10,777 --> 01:49:13,511
       and you just think,      
   "Well, maybe this will end   

1613
01:49:13,513 --> 01:49:17,282
      "and maybe it won't,      
 and maybe we'll all be blown up

1614
01:49:17,284 --> 01:49:19,184
       and maybe we won't,      
         but who cares?"        

1615
01:49:19,186 --> 01:49:22,087
      And you... you learn      
    to sort of live with it.    

1616
01:49:22,089 --> 01:49:25,323
         (explosion)            
  It<i> is</i> just a matter of fate.  

1617
01:49:25,325 --> 01:49:28,860
     You will either survive    
     if the Lord is willing     

1618
01:49:28,862 --> 01:49:29,761
        or you will not.        

1619
01:49:29,763 --> 01:49:32,730
    So there's really nothing   
           you can do.          

1620
01:49:32,732 --> 01:49:33,965
          (explosions)          

1621
01:49:33,967 --> 01:49:36,000
      And you just take it.     

1622
01:49:36,002 --> 01:49:40,405
   (gunfire and artillery fire  
          in distance)          

1623
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:45,743
            NARRATOR:           
 Private Sid Phillips turned 18 
         on September 2.        

1624
01:49:45,745 --> 01:49:49,447
      The next day, he got      
   his first letter from home   

1625
01:49:49,449 --> 01:49:52,483
        since he'd sailed       
        for Guadalcanal.        

1626
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:54,385
     It was, he wrote back,     

1627
01:49:54,387 --> 01:49:58,556
   "the best birthday present   
        possible for me."       

1628
01:50:05,264 --> 01:50:06,664
       In late September,       

1629
01:50:06,666 --> 01:50:12,036
  some American reinforcements  
    finally made it through.    

1630
01:50:14,373 --> 01:50:18,142
       But nightly visits       
  by fast-moving Japanese ships 

1631
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:20,845
       the Marines called       
       the "Tokyo Express"      

1632
01:50:20,847 --> 01:50:23,348
  kept the enemy on the island  

1633
01:50:23,350 --> 01:50:27,518
     supplied and reinforced    
            as well.            

1634
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,755
        (artillery fire)        

1635
01:50:31,890 --> 01:50:34,626
            NARRATOR:           
      Twice, the Japanese,      

1636
01:50:34,628 --> 01:50:36,894
           determined           
   to retake Henderson Field,   

1637
01:50:36,896 --> 01:50:40,364
   mounted full-scale assaults  
        on the airstrip.        

1638
01:50:40,366 --> 01:50:41,499
        (artillery fire)        

1639
01:50:41,501 --> 01:50:44,468
       Twice, the Marines       
         beat them back.        

1640
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:49,374
   Thousands of Japanese were   
  shot dead or blown to pieces. 

1641
01:51:12,064 --> 01:51:13,565
         (flies buzzing)        

1642
01:51:13,567 --> 01:51:15,133
        Week after week,        

1643
01:51:15,135 --> 01:51:19,204
   the battle for Guadalcanal   
           ground on.           

1644
01:51:25,644 --> 01:51:29,614
          The Japanese          
    were not the only enemy.    

1645
01:51:29,616 --> 01:51:33,918
The stench of rotting vegetation
     and decomposing corpses    

1646
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:39,624
hung in the humid, lifeless air,
   clung to the men's clothes,  

1647
01:51:39,626 --> 01:51:43,595
       remained as a taste      
          in the mouth.         

1648
01:51:46,999 --> 01:51:51,302
        Torrential rains        
  turned campsites into swamps, 

1649
01:51:51,304 --> 01:51:54,939
jungle paths into rivers of mud.

1650
01:51:55,941 --> 01:51:58,243
      Clouds of mosquitoes      
         spread malaria,        

1651
01:51:58,245 --> 01:52:03,381
    leaving hundreds helpless   
     with chills and fever.     

1652
01:52:05,451 --> 01:52:07,352
   To the men on Guadalcanal,   

1653
01:52:07,354 --> 01:52:13,557
 Operation Shoestring had become
      Operation Pestilence.     

1654
01:52:17,596 --> 01:52:19,363
       "The typical Marine      
         on the island,"        

1655
01:52:19,365 --> 01:52:22,333
    Sid Phillips remembered,    
          "ran a fever,         

1656
01:52:22,335 --> 01:52:25,403
    "wore stinking dungarees,   
        loathed twilight,       

1657
01:52:25,405 --> 01:52:31,342
      and wondered whether      
  the U.S. Navy still existed." 

1658
01:52:49,828 --> 01:52:53,564
    the Japanese navy mounted   
    one last major offensive,   

1659
01:52:53,566 --> 01:52:56,033
      aimed at reinforcing      
          their forces          

1660
01:52:56,035 --> 01:53:00,571
  and dislodging the Americans  
         on Guadalcanal.        

1661
01:53:00,573 --> 01:53:04,575
      A much smaller number     
  of American ships steamed in  

1662
01:53:04,577 --> 01:53:07,444
      to try to stop them.      

1663
01:53:08,213 --> 01:53:10,281
 The naval battle that followed 

1664
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:14,219
     went on for three days     
        and three nights.       

1665
01:53:14,221 --> 01:53:17,121
            PHILLIPS:           
          You could see         
    the salvos of the ships,    

1666
01:53:17,123 --> 01:53:19,958
        and you could see       
        the naval shells        

1667
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,994
      going through the air     
      like lightning bugs.      

1668
01:53:22,996 --> 01:53:25,863
And you could see ships explode.

1669
01:53:25,865 --> 01:53:28,900
     We didn't know if they     
   were American or Japanese.   

1670
01:53:28,902 --> 01:53:32,603
 We didn't know who was winning 
       or who was losing.       

1671
01:53:32,605 --> 01:53:35,540
      Sometimes when a ship     
   would explode, it would...   

1672
01:53:35,542 --> 01:53:38,610
  the concussion would actually 
        flap your clothes       

1673
01:53:38,612 --> 01:53:40,678
      miles and miles away.     

1674
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:44,582
      But we did know that      
   our fate was being decided   

1675
01:53:44,584 --> 01:53:47,818
  and we would, uh, we would... 

1676
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:51,722
   sit there sort of mystified  
          and horrified         

1677
01:53:51,724 --> 01:53:54,158
      by what was going on,     
         because we knew        

1678
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:59,463
    thousands of sailors were   
 dying on one side or the other.

1679
01:54:05,104 --> 01:54:09,006
            NARRATOR:           
   Some 5,000 American sailors  
        lost their lives        

1680
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:11,575
         in the fighting        
        off Guadalcanal--       

1681
01:54:11,577 --> 01:54:14,979
             so many            
    that the casualty figures   

1682
01:54:14,981 --> 01:54:18,616
were again kept from the public.

1683
01:54:19,517 --> 01:54:21,953
      Among those who died      

1684
01:54:21,955 --> 01:54:24,856
       were five brothers       
   from Fredericksburg, Iowa,   

1685
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:28,393
         who all served         
     on the cruiser<i> Juneau--</i>    

1686
01:54:28,395 --> 01:54:31,195
    Joseph, Francis, Albert,    

1687
01:54:31,197 --> 01:54:35,566
  Madison and George Sullivan.  

1688
01:54:36,402 --> 01:54:40,071
 But Japan lost two battleships,

1689
01:54:40,073 --> 01:54:42,339
       23 other warships,       

1690
01:54:42,341 --> 01:54:44,141
          600 aircraft,         

1691
01:54:44,143 --> 01:54:49,213
          and thousands         
     of sailors and airmen.     

1692
01:54:49,215 --> 01:54:51,048
       And most important       
         to Sid Phillips        

1693
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:55,219
   and the men on Guadalcanal,  
  the enemy was no longer able  

1694
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:59,323
     to resupply its forces     
         on the island.         

1695
01:54:59,325 --> 01:55:02,359
The Japanese continued to fight,

1696
01:55:02,361 --> 01:55:07,131
 but it was clear the Americans 
    would eventually prevail.   

1697
01:55:07,133 --> 01:55:12,069
  The last starving, desperate  
  Japanese troops on the island 

1698
01:55:12,071 --> 01:55:15,873
      would not be killed,      
      captured or evacuated     

1699
01:55:15,875 --> 01:55:20,278
      until February 1943.      

1700
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:25,383
    21,000 Japanese soldiers    
           were lost.           

1701
01:55:28,854 --> 01:55:33,858
     Guadalcanal would prove    
       a crucial victory.       

1702
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:36,027
     After six long months,     

1703
01:55:36,029 --> 01:55:38,363
  the Americans were beginning  
      to learn how to beat      

1704
01:55:38,365 --> 01:55:40,931
         the Japanese--         
       not only in the air      

1705
01:55:40,933 --> 01:55:43,801
         and on the sea,        
       but in the jungles,      

1706
01:55:43,803 --> 01:55:46,870
      where, over the next      
          three years,          

1707
01:55:46,872 --> 01:55:51,442
       the fighting would       
         only get worse.        

1708
01:55:51,444 --> 01:55:56,880
      Allied shipping lanes     
   to Australia remained open.  

1709
01:55:56,882 --> 01:56:00,083
  And there was more good news. 

1710
01:56:00,085 --> 01:56:02,353
 American and Australian forces 
         had also taken         

1711
01:56:02,355 --> 01:56:06,791
   the most important Japanese  
   strongholds on New Guinea.   

1712
01:56:06,793 --> 01:56:11,229
        Japan's expansion       
        had been stopped.       

1713
01:56:12,097 --> 01:56:15,165
            PHILLIPS:           
By the time we left Guadalcanal,

1714
01:56:15,167 --> 01:56:18,502
     which was December 22nd    
            of 1942--           

1715
01:56:18,504 --> 01:56:21,772
        we had been there       
     since August the 7th--     

1716
01:56:21,774 --> 01:56:26,044
       everybody had lost       
       at least 25 pounds.      

1717
01:56:26,046 --> 01:56:27,645
    Our clothes were in rags.   

1718
01:56:27,647 --> 01:56:33,050
   We were covered with sores.  

1719
01:56:33,052 --> 01:56:38,556
    And we had nearly starved   
  to death two or three times.  

1720
01:56:45,230 --> 01:56:47,632
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
       We did not realize       

1721
01:56:47,634 --> 01:56:51,735
    how desperate the Marines   
      were on Guadalcanal,      

1722
01:56:51,737 --> 01:56:57,175
 because the news never told us.

1723
01:56:59,844 --> 01:57:04,849
 In fact, it was not till years 
   later when Sidney came home  

1724
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:09,586
  that we found that their food 
 was down to fish heads and rice

1725
01:57:09,588 --> 01:57:12,757
      and that he was down      
          to 125 pounds         

1726
01:57:12,759 --> 01:57:16,326
     when they took him off     
         of Guadalcanal.        

1727
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:24,568
            NARRATOR:           
    More than 1,700 Americans   
    had died on Guadalcanal.    

1728
01:57:24,570 --> 01:57:29,140
   Another 4,700 were wounded,  

1729
01:57:29,142 --> 01:57:36,280
       and thousands more       
       were seriously ill.      

1730
01:57:37,849 --> 01:57:40,818
   Sid Phillips had survived.   

1731
01:57:44,356 --> 01:57:47,691
  But his uncle Charles Tucker, 
          a Navy pilot          

1732
01:57:47,693 --> 01:57:52,797
    who had flown in and out    
  of Henderson Field, had not.  

1733
01:57:55,366 --> 01:58:01,805
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
  When we lost Charlie, it made 
   it very real to all of us.   

1734
01:58:01,807 --> 01:58:08,112
And by that time, we had started
losing boys in the neighborhood.

1735
01:58:08,114 --> 01:58:12,049
  The boy up here on the corner 
        was a Navy pilot        

1736
01:58:12,051 --> 01:58:13,150
       and he was killed.       

1737
01:58:13,152 --> 01:58:16,654
     The boy down the street    
     was an Air Force pilot     

1738
01:58:16,656 --> 01:58:19,090
  and he was missing in action. 

1739
01:58:19,092 --> 01:58:23,761
     We just... they started    
   disappearing all around us.  

1740
01:58:23,763 --> 01:58:26,130
  And my mother spent her time  

1741
01:58:26,132 --> 01:58:30,501
    going to visit the other    
    mothers, consoling them.    

1742
01:58:30,503 --> 01:58:35,406
       And it was a very,       
       very fearful time.       

1743
01:58:35,408 --> 01:58:41,479
     You don't expect death     
     among people your age.     

1744
01:58:41,481 --> 01:58:42,980
         Old people die.        

1745
01:58:42,982 --> 01:58:46,050
   And then, you begin to see   

1746
01:58:46,052 --> 01:58:49,020
  that it's your contemporaries 
           are dying.           

1747
01:58:49,022 --> 01:58:52,456
         And therefore,         
     it is just conceivable     

1748
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:54,758
    that you might die, too.    

1749
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:58,228
   ("American Anthem" playing)  

1750
01:59:01,232 --> 01:59:05,570
            NARRATOR:           
       Luverne, Minnesota,      
     had been lucky so far.     

1751
01:59:05,572 --> 01:59:10,507
    No local family had lost    
        a son in the war.       

1752
01:59:10,509 --> 01:59:13,343
       But in Sacramento,       

1753
01:59:13,345 --> 01:59:15,479
      Mrs. Lillian Cole had     
          received news         

1754
01:59:15,481 --> 01:59:19,984
 that her son David had perished
       on the USS<i> Arizona</i>       

1755
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:21,218
        at Pearl Harbor.        

1756
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:24,822
       She had been asked       
        by the government       

1757
01:59:24,824 --> 01:59:26,624
 "to keep secret for the present

1758
01:59:26,626 --> 01:59:29,726
      the name of the ship      
      on which he served."      

1759
01:59:29,728 --> 01:59:34,998
   Another Sacramento native,   
        Airman Tom Burke,       

1760
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,669
   died on a training mission   
         in Puerto Rico,        

1761
01:59:38,671 --> 01:59:41,739
           devastating          
   his younger brother, Earl.   

1762
01:59:44,042 --> 01:59:48,880
   In Waterbury, the family of  
 Marine private Albert Boulanger

1763
01:59:48,882 --> 01:59:52,016
 learned that he had been killed
         on Guadalcanal,        

1764
01:59:52,018 --> 01:59:57,655
 not far from where Sid Phillips
  of Mobile had been fighting.  

1765
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:09,567
     Glenn Frazier was still    
   a prisoner of the Japanese,  

1766
02:00:09,569 --> 02:00:13,471
   but the girl he loved back   
 in Alabama had changed her mind

1767
02:00:13,473 --> 02:00:18,876
   and was now waiting for him  
      to come home to her.      

1768
02:00:28,953 --> 02:00:30,988
   Back in the summer of 1942,  

1769
02:00:30,990 --> 02:00:34,525
  a movie called<i> Holiday Inn</i>    
          had opened.           

1770
02:00:34,527 --> 02:00:40,030
  In it, Bing Crosby introduced 
  a new song by Irving Berlin.  

1771
02:00:40,032 --> 02:00:45,435
     (introduction to "White    
       Christmas" playing)      

1772
02:00:48,907 --> 02:00:53,344
         I'm dreaming         

1773
02:00:53,346 --> 02:00:59,850
     Of a white Christmas     

1774
02:00:59,852 --> 02:01:04,921
       Just like the ones      
       I used to know...       

1775
02:01:04,923 --> 02:01:09,426
            NARRATOR:           
     It was an instant hit,     
      and at Christmastime      

1776
02:01:09,428 --> 02:01:11,395
  American servicemen heard it  

1777
02:01:11,397 --> 02:01:14,331
     wherever they happened     
          to be posted.         

1778
02:01:14,333 --> 02:01:19,036
    ...and children listen    

1779
02:01:19,038 --> 02:01:29,513
      To hear sleigh bells     
          in the snow          

1780
02:01:29,515 --> 02:01:34,518
         I'm dreaming         

1781
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:40,157
     Of a white Christmas     

1782
02:01:40,159 --> 02:01:48,799
    With every Christmas card  
            I write            

1783
02:01:48,801 --> 02:01:54,939
          May your days        
    be merry and bright...     

1784
02:01:54,941 --> 02:01:58,609
            NARRATOR:           
     Japan's advance across     
  the Pacific had been stopped  

1785
02:01:58,611 --> 02:02:02,379
   at Midway and Guadalcanal,   

1786
02:02:02,381 --> 02:02:05,716
   but at the end of America's  
       first year at war,       

1787
02:02:05,718 --> 02:02:11,455
  Japan's Pacific empire still  
     stretched 4,000 miles.     

1788
02:02:11,457 --> 02:02:15,626
       <i> I'm dreaming</i>           
   <i> of a white Christmas</i>       
 On the other side of the world,

1789
02:02:15,628 --> 02:02:19,329
  the Red Army had stopped the  
  Nazi advance deep into Russia 

1790
02:02:19,331 --> 02:02:20,397
         at Stalingrad.         

1791
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:26,169
    Allied troops had finally   
     landed in North Africa.    

1792
02:02:26,171 --> 02:02:28,973
 But there they would soon face 
         the full might         

1793
02:02:28,975 --> 02:02:31,642
       of the German army       
       for the first time.      

1794
02:02:31,644 --> 02:02:35,646
   The Germans still occupied   
         most of Europe,        

1795
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:37,915
  still had designs on Britain  

1796
02:02:37,917 --> 02:02:42,419
        and, eventually,        
  on the United States as well. 

1797
02:02:45,190 --> 02:02:49,827
    For Americans in uniform,   
      a hometown Christmas      

1798
02:02:49,829 --> 02:02:52,930
      seemed very far away.     

1799
02:02:52,932 --> 02:02:59,269
          (final phrase         
   of "White Christmas" plays)  

1800
02:03:22,761 --> 02:03:25,395
  (gentle piano melody playing) 

1801
02:03:25,397 --> 02:03:30,301
          NORAH JONES:          
     All we've been given     

1802
02:03:30,303 --> 02:03:35,739
   By those who came before   

1803
02:03:35,741 --> 02:03:39,410
     The dream of a nation    

1804
02:03:39,412 --> 02:03:43,780
  Where freedom would endure  

1805
02:03:43,782 --> 02:03:50,220
      The work and prayers     
         of centuries          

1806
02:03:50,222 --> 02:03:53,690
  Have brought us to this day 

1807
02:03:53,692 --> 02:03:57,962
   What shall be our legacy?  

1808
02:03:57,964 --> 02:04:03,133
  What will our children say? 

1809
02:04:03,135 --> 02:04:07,805
      Let them say of me      

1810
02:04:07,807 --> 02:04:12,342
    I was one who believed    

1811
02:04:12,344 --> 02:04:20,985
    In sharing the blessings   
          I received           

1812
02:04:20,987 --> 02:04:26,590
    Let me know in my heart   

1813
02:04:26,592 --> 02:04:33,897
   When my days are through   

1814
02:04:33,899 --> 02:04:38,536
       America, America       

1815
02:04:38,538 --> 02:04:45,075
   I gave my best to you...   

1816
02:04:46,578 --> 02:04:51,348
            America           

1817
02:04:51,350 --> 02:05:01,058
    I gave my best to you.    

1818
02:05:17,042 --> 02:05:20,910
        (birds chirping,        
   distant machine gun firing)  

1819
02:05:32,223 --> 02:05:35,325
            NARRATOR:           
    Back on November 4, 1942,   

1820
02:05:35,327 --> 02:05:38,095
       as Sid Phillips and      
    the First Marine Division   

1821
02:05:38,097 --> 02:05:42,466
    continued to try to hold    
 Henderson Field on Guadalcanal,

1822
02:05:42,468 --> 02:05:48,038
  a unique force began landing  
      31 miles to the east.     

1823
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:50,474
        The Second Marine       
       Raider Battalion--       

1824
02:05:50,476 --> 02:05:52,309
           best known           
    as "Carlson's Raiders"--    

1825
02:05:52,311 --> 02:05:55,946
     had orders to slip into    
  the jungle behind enemy lines 

1826
02:05:55,948 --> 02:06:02,185
    and harass the 3,000-man    
  Japanese force hidden there.  

1827
02:06:04,355 --> 02:06:08,425
    With them was a young man   
       named Bill Lansford      

1828
02:06:08,427 --> 02:06:10,527
     from the Boyle Heights     
          neighborhood          

1829
02:06:10,529 --> 02:06:12,296
      of East Los Angeles.      

1830
02:06:12,298 --> 02:06:16,033
        His absent father       
        was a policeman.        

1831
02:06:16,035 --> 02:06:21,138
 His mother, Rosalinda Melendez,
     had come to California     

1832
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:23,307
      from Juarez, Mexico.      

1833
02:06:23,309 --> 02:06:29,346
            LANSFORD:           
As a boy, I was not really aware
   of the Anglo world at all.   

1834
02:06:30,448 --> 02:06:35,518
       Principally I lived      
     in Latino neighborhoods    

1835
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,689
    and spoke Spanish at home   

1836
02:06:38,691 --> 02:06:40,925
  and knew very little English  

1837
02:06:40,927 --> 02:06:44,527
           until I was          
     about 14 years of age.     

1838
02:06:46,097 --> 02:06:48,365
      I had actually wanted     
        to join the Navy        

1839
02:06:48,367 --> 02:06:52,402
  because it had that mystique  
    of going to foreign lands   

1840
02:06:52,404 --> 02:06:54,204
   and all that kind of stuff.  

1841
02:06:54,206 --> 02:06:55,339
  But the fact of the matter is 

1842
02:06:55,341 --> 02:06:59,242
that I was considered too skinny
         and too little         

1843
02:06:59,244 --> 02:07:02,078
    and they rejected me over   
   and over until I got to be   

1844
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:05,482
    like a fly hanging around   
       a gravy bowl there,      

1845
02:07:05,484 --> 02:07:08,218
   you know, the Navy station.  

1846
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:09,219
     And one day I came out     

1847
02:07:09,221 --> 02:07:12,689
   and there was this enormous  
         Marine in blues        

1848
02:07:12,691 --> 02:07:15,926
 and standing there, and he gave
       me a real pep talk.      

1849
02:07:15,928 --> 02:07:18,528
       He said, "Why don't      
      you join the Marines?     

1850
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:20,263
        They're the best        
        outfit there is."       

1851
02:07:20,265 --> 02:07:22,365
 And I thought, "Well, the Navy 
        doesn't want me;        

1852
02:07:22,367 --> 02:07:24,468
    I'll try them," you know.   

1853
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:30,040
  So in a way, it was the best  
 choice I ever made in my life. 

1854
02:07:32,911 --> 02:07:36,579
            NARRATOR:           
  At first, like many Latinos,  

1855
02:07:36,581 --> 02:07:39,382
    he did not feel entirely    
  welcome in the Marine Corps.  

1856
02:07:39,384 --> 02:07:42,986
   I think it was Little Texas  
      in the Marine Corps,      

1857
02:07:42,988 --> 02:07:45,322
     and as you know, Texans    
     and Mexicans didn't...     

1858
02:07:45,324 --> 02:07:48,925
  weren't exactly bosom buddies 
         in those days.         

1859
02:07:51,262 --> 02:07:55,065
       As the war advanced      
     and we went on through,    

1860
02:07:55,067 --> 02:07:57,000
  these Texan guys began seeing 

1861
02:07:57,002 --> 02:08:02,973
      that we weren't what      
      they thought we were.     

1862
02:08:02,975 --> 02:08:05,375
        that they weren't       
   what we thought they were.   

1863
02:08:05,377 --> 02:08:09,646
      And being Marines was     
     kind of a melting pot,     

1864
02:08:09,648 --> 02:08:12,215
       It was like the...       
 a mini United States, you know,

1865
02:08:12,217 --> 02:08:15,818
   where you got Jews, you got  
   Italians, you got Indians,   

1866
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:18,421
       and they all learn       
        to live together.       

1867
02:08:18,423 --> 02:08:21,224
    (explosion, men shouting)   

1868
02:08:21,226 --> 02:08:24,628
 The Latinos have a culture just
 as the Japanese had, you know, 

1869
02:08:24,630 --> 02:08:28,432
 their own form of Bushido code,
     which is not as extreme    

1870
02:08:28,434 --> 02:08:32,436
  but certainly is just as firm 
        in their nature.        

1871
02:08:34,038 --> 02:08:36,673
           And that's           
     that they want to prove    

1872
02:08:36,675 --> 02:08:40,844
 that they're up to whatever job
        is given to them.       

1873
02:08:40,846 --> 02:08:45,748
   And they want to show that   
they're as patriotic as anybody,

1874
02:08:45,750 --> 02:08:48,919
  as some blue-eyed blond guy.  

1875
02:08:48,921 --> 02:08:52,856
            NARRATOR:           
    Lansford soon heard about   
  the Second Raider Battalion,  

1876
02:08:52,858 --> 02:08:57,160
     an elite commando unit,    
    and decided to volunteer.   

1877
02:08:57,162 --> 02:09:01,832
         Its commander,         
  Lt. Colonel Evans F. Carlson, 

1878
02:09:01,834 --> 02:09:05,569
      was a minister's son      
     with a crusader's zeal.    

1879
02:09:05,571 --> 02:09:11,908
 Carlson's motto was "Gung ho"--
  Chinese for "Work together."  

1880
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:14,745
      Officers were called      
      by their first names      

1881
02:09:14,747 --> 02:09:17,114
and lived just as their men did.

1882
02:09:17,116 --> 02:09:21,051
       Decisions were made      
   collectively, by consensus.  

1883
02:09:21,053 --> 02:09:25,823
            LANSFORD:           
       Colonel Carlson was      
         a visionary...         

1884
02:09:27,525 --> 02:09:30,994
        and he understood       
  guerrilla warfare perfectly.  

1885
02:09:30,996 --> 02:09:33,497
  He had made a lifelong study  
        of it and his...        

1886
02:09:33,499 --> 02:09:37,000
      I think his hero was      
       Lawrence of Arabia.      

1887
02:09:37,002 --> 02:09:38,702
            NARRATOR:           
   Carlson's second in command  

1888
02:09:38,704 --> 02:09:43,107
    was the oldest son of the   
 president of the United States,

1889
02:09:43,109 --> 02:09:44,741
        James Roosevelt.        

1890
02:09:44,743 --> 02:09:47,243
            LANSFORD:           
    I think he may have been    
          nearsighted,          

1891
02:09:47,245 --> 02:09:48,845
       and he had to wear       
         special shoes,         

1892
02:09:48,847 --> 02:09:54,050
but he certainly never asked and
never got any special treatment.

1893
02:09:54,052 --> 02:09:58,388
           PETE ARIAS:          
    He used to stand in line    
  with the rest of the troops.  

1894
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:02,959
      When we went to eat,      
       he'd stand in line       

1895
02:10:02,961 --> 02:10:04,428
        with his utensils       
      and stuff like that,      

1896
02:10:04,430 --> 02:10:07,931
and, uh, he was just another guy
   as far as I was concerned.   

1897
02:10:07,933 --> 02:10:10,834
            NARRATOR:           
  Also serving with the Raiders 

1898
02:10:10,836 --> 02:10:14,204
       was a farmer's son       
    from Los Angeles County,    

1899
02:10:14,206 --> 02:10:16,473
    Pete Arias of C Company,    

1900
02:10:16,475 --> 02:10:21,712
        who had joined up       
     to get away from home.     

1901
02:10:21,714 --> 02:10:23,914
     Within hours of landing    
         on Guadalcanal,        

1902
02:10:23,916 --> 02:10:29,486
   the Raiders moved into the   
  jungle, already on the hunt.  

1903
02:10:29,488 --> 02:10:33,890
 Their objective was to terrify 
     and bewilder the enemy,    

1904
02:10:33,892 --> 02:10:36,059
    mounting surprise attacks   
         from the rear,         

1905
02:10:36,061 --> 02:10:42,099
    then melting away again,    
      living off the land.      

1906
02:10:44,068 --> 02:10:45,202
           (explosion)          

1907
02:11:01,186 --> 02:11:05,589
            LANSFORD:           
        The Japanese had        
      never been defeated.      

1908
02:11:05,591 --> 02:11:08,992
   You know, they had defeated  
      the Russians in 1904,     

1909
02:11:08,994 --> 02:11:11,394
      and from that time on     
    they had been considered    

1910
02:11:11,396 --> 02:11:15,899
    the finest jungle troops    
        and light troops.       

1911
02:11:19,437 --> 02:11:21,338
        They had a sense        
       of being superior.       

1912
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:25,374
 They held the American soldiers
          in contempt.          

1913
02:11:25,376 --> 02:11:29,178
      They thought we were      
       a bunch of softies.      

1914
02:11:29,180 --> 02:11:31,948
   They thought that we could   
     not make the sacrifices    

1915
02:11:31,950 --> 02:11:38,688
  that the Japanese could-- the 
Bushido code and all that stuff.

1916
02:11:44,528 --> 02:11:48,098
      And that superiority      
   on the part of the Japanese  

1917
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:51,968
      is one of the things      
       that defeated them,      

1918
02:11:51,970 --> 02:11:54,137
     because the last thing     
          they expected         

1919
02:11:54,139 --> 02:11:59,042
     was any Americans to be    
       behind their lines.      

1920
02:11:59,044 --> 02:12:00,977
  And they couldn't believe it. 

1921
02:12:02,080 --> 02:12:03,313
      And in the beginning      

1922
02:12:03,315 --> 02:12:06,349
      they thought we were      
       just small patrols       

1923
02:12:06,351 --> 02:12:10,386
  They didn't realize they were 
 up against an organized force. 

1924
02:12:10,388 --> 02:12:14,324
 And we... we couldn't take them
   on, you know, face to face.  

1925
02:12:14,326 --> 02:12:15,758
      You know, there were      
        too many of them.       

1926
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:18,962
 So we kept hitting their flanks
   and hitting their rear end   

1927
02:12:18,964 --> 02:12:22,632
  and attacking them where they 
 thought we weren't going to be,

1928
02:12:22,634 --> 02:12:24,734
   and chopping away at them.   

1929
02:12:24,736 --> 02:12:29,840
 It was like chopping pieces of 
an animal until the animal died.

1930
02:12:34,178 --> 02:12:40,917
            NARRATOR:           
 Most of the fighting was brief,
 violent and at close quarters. 

1931
02:12:40,919 --> 02:12:45,955
    Sometimes just a few feet   
     separated the Americans    

1932
02:12:45,957 --> 02:12:47,790
         from the enemy.        

1933
02:12:59,904 --> 02:13:01,838
             ARIAS:             
   The Raiders were in there,   

1934
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:06,442
  we was in there to take care  
      of people, you know.      

1935
02:13:06,444 --> 02:13:09,278
      If we ran into them,      
     we'd take care of them,    

1936
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:11,081
           and that...          
     that's the way it was.     

1937
02:13:11,083 --> 02:13:14,551
       But there was a lot      
        of Japs, though.        

1938
02:13:14,553 --> 02:13:18,288
    We used to run into them    
        every other day.        

1939
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:20,323
   Well, they used to tell us   

1940
02:13:20,325 --> 02:13:26,496
    that, uh... the Japanese    
     couldn't see very far.     

1941
02:13:26,498 --> 02:13:30,834
     But I... they could see    
     far enough to kill you.    

1942
02:13:32,403 --> 02:13:35,538
            NARRATOR:           
       One day, Pete Arias      
          and his squad         

1943
02:13:35,540 --> 02:13:37,140
were ordered to cross a clearing

1944
02:13:37,142 --> 02:13:40,811
        on the outskirts        
     of a deserted village.     

1945
02:13:40,813 --> 02:13:45,148
             ARIAS:             
      My corporal-- he was      
 our squad leader-- he says, uh,

1946
02:13:45,150 --> 02:13:48,151
     "I don't think we ought    
    to go across that field."   

1947
02:13:48,153 --> 02:13:51,454
   So here comes the captain,   
 he says, the company commander,

1948
02:13:51,456 --> 02:13:53,256
            he says,            
    "Hey, what's the holdup?"   

1949
02:13:53,258 --> 02:13:56,593
  And this, uh, then this squad 
      leader of mine says,      

1950
02:13:56,595 --> 02:13:59,795
 "Hey, Captain, I don't think we
   ought to cross this field."  

1951
02:13:59,797 --> 02:14:04,167
      And the captain says,     
         "Aw, go ahead."        

1952
02:14:05,836 --> 02:14:10,106
   This machine gun opened up,  
      right in front of us.     

1953
02:14:12,009 --> 02:14:15,211
     It wiped out my squad.     

1954
02:14:15,213 --> 02:14:18,581
   My platoon leader, he said,  
       "Move your squad."       

1955
02:14:18,583 --> 02:14:21,418
 I says, "I ain't got no squad."

1956
02:14:21,420 --> 02:14:23,986
 We lost a lot of people there. 

1957
02:14:36,601 --> 02:14:39,836
            NARRATOR:           
 In the fighting that followed, 

1958
02:14:39,838 --> 02:14:41,571
       some of the Raiders      
         were captured,         

1959
02:14:41,573 --> 02:14:44,841
  then tortured and mutilated.  

1960
02:14:44,843 --> 02:14:48,111
            LANSFORD:           
     And we could hear them,    
      you know, crying out      

1961
02:14:48,113 --> 02:14:51,747
 while they were being tortured.

1962
02:14:51,749 --> 02:14:54,016
     And the following day,     
        after the battle        

1963
02:14:54,018 --> 02:14:57,420
     and after we discovered    
   our guys, our Raider guys,   

1964
02:14:57,422 --> 02:15:00,557
      staked to the ground      
         and, you know,         

1965
02:15:00,559 --> 02:15:01,992
   in effect tortured, cut up,  

1966
02:15:01,994 --> 02:15:07,831
        we had captured,        
       I think, five guys.      

1967
02:15:07,833 --> 02:15:11,902
  When we were assembled there  
 after the battle, Carlson said,

1968
02:15:11,904 --> 02:15:16,105
 "Did anybody lose a good friend
    in the battle yesterday?"   

1969
02:15:16,107 --> 02:15:18,041
      And some guys raised      
          their hands.          

1970
02:15:18,043 --> 02:15:20,744
        And then he said,       
   "Okay, take these guys out   

1971
02:15:20,746 --> 02:15:23,046
  and do what you have to do."  

1972
02:15:23,048 --> 02:15:26,383
    So some of the guys took    
    them out and killed them.   

1973
02:15:26,385 --> 02:15:30,253
  Just took them in the jungle  
         and shot them.         

1974
02:15:30,255 --> 02:15:33,356
     We were supposed to be     
        good guys and...        

1975
02:15:33,358 --> 02:15:35,592
there were no reporters with us.

1976
02:15:35,594 --> 02:15:37,894
    So the word never got out   
        until much later        

1977
02:15:37,896 --> 02:15:40,830
     that that had happened,    
 and some people still deny it. 

1978
02:15:40,832 --> 02:15:45,802
 But I was there and I'm telling
   you that... that we did it.  

1979
02:15:50,441 --> 02:15:53,876
            NARRATOR:           
     What came to be called     
        the "Long Patrol"       

1980
02:15:53,878 --> 02:15:57,780
   went on for 30 brutal days.  

1981
02:15:57,782 --> 02:16:01,250
 Carlson's Raiders lost 34 men, 

1982
02:16:01,252 --> 02:16:05,555
         but they killed        
      almost 500 Japanese.      

1983
02:16:05,557 --> 02:16:10,326
A few months later, the American
  guerrillas would fight again  

1984
02:16:10,328 --> 02:16:16,766
     in the Solomon Islands,    
   this time on Bougainville.   

1985
02:16:27,578 --> 02:16:32,248
            LANSFORD:           
Bougainville was the worst place
         I've ever been.        

1986
02:16:32,250 --> 02:16:33,884
   If there really is a hell,   

1987
02:16:33,886 --> 02:16:37,053
      I mean it's got to be     
       like Bougainville.       

1988
02:16:37,055 --> 02:16:42,759
    It just... the island was   
      a pile of pestilence.     

1989
02:16:47,398 --> 02:16:52,602
  One night we were moving into 
  a position up the Piva Trail, 

1990
02:16:52,604 --> 02:16:55,538
     I mean you couldn't...     
literally couldn't see your hand

1991
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:58,541
     in front of your face.     

1992
02:16:58,543 --> 02:17:00,944
     We were moving in there    
     and I had a machine gun    

1993
02:17:00,946 --> 02:17:05,549
  and, uh, my assistant gunner  
      and I set up the gun.     

1994
02:17:05,551 --> 02:17:07,583
       And we didn't know       
         where we were.         

1995
02:17:07,585 --> 02:17:08,918
         We didn't know         
       where the enemy was      

1996
02:17:08,920 --> 02:17:11,420
   except that he was supposed  
   to be right in front of us.  

1997
02:17:11,422 --> 02:17:15,057
    And as we were setting up   
    the gun, we heard a shot,   

1998
02:17:15,059 --> 02:17:16,159
         just one shot.         

1999
02:17:16,161 --> 02:17:18,094
     And I heard a guy go...    
            (grunts).           

2000
02:17:18,096 --> 02:17:20,797
       You know, he, like,      
       caught his breath.       

2001
02:17:20,799 --> 02:17:25,569
 And, uh, you know, we lay there
        for a long time.        

2002
02:17:25,571 --> 02:17:28,204
      Then we began to hear     
        this guy moaning.       

2003
02:17:28,206 --> 02:17:31,608
     The moans became louder    
  and then he became delirious  

2004
02:17:31,610 --> 02:17:33,743
        and then he began       
     to call for his mother.    

2005
02:17:33,745 --> 02:17:37,580
     I thought that was only    
  in the movies, but it isn't.  

2006
02:17:37,582 --> 02:17:39,949
         And, uh, it was        
        a terrible night.       

2007
02:17:39,951 --> 02:17:44,787
   And then, you know, we were  
trying to sleep and we couldn't,

2008
02:17:44,789 --> 02:17:46,722
 and, uh, and I began thinking, 

2009
02:17:46,724 --> 02:17:49,526
    "Jesus Christ, why don't    
       you die, goddammit.      

2010
02:17:49,528 --> 02:17:51,261
   You know, we got to sleep."  

2011
02:17:51,263 --> 02:17:54,964
 You know, your mind gets crazy 
          after a while         

2012
02:17:54,966 --> 02:17:56,866
     under those conditions.    

2013
02:17:56,868 --> 02:17:58,701
 And he continued to moan and...

2014
02:17:58,703 --> 02:18:03,639
       until near morning       
          when he died.         

2015
02:18:03,641 --> 02:18:08,511
  When it was daylight, we were 
  told to withdraw from there.  

2016
02:18:08,513 --> 02:18:10,946
      And they had this guy     
          in a poncho,          

2017
02:18:10,948 --> 02:18:13,717
   and they were dropping him   
      into one of the holes     

2018
02:18:13,719 --> 02:18:18,154
         that the people        
      in the back had dug.      

2019
02:18:18,156 --> 02:18:21,257
  And I said, "Who is the guy?" 

2020
02:18:21,259 --> 02:18:23,859
    He told me the name of...   
           of the guy           

2021
02:18:23,861 --> 02:18:25,895
      and it was, you know,     
         my best friend.        

2022
02:18:25,897 --> 02:18:30,099
   And he had been about three  
   or four guys away from me,   

2023
02:18:30,101 --> 02:18:31,634
           and it was           
    an accidental discharge.    

2024
02:18:31,636 --> 02:18:37,674
 Somebody had accidentally fired
   a shot as he hit the deck,   

2025
02:18:37,676 --> 02:18:40,576
 and the rifle butt hit the deck
          and he fired          

2026
02:18:40,578 --> 02:18:42,879
 and it was the only shot fired 
           that night           

2027
02:18:42,881 --> 02:18:45,415
    and he... it killed him.    

2028
02:18:45,417 --> 02:18:49,018
And, you know, I just, you know,
        I felt like hell.       

2029
02:18:49,020 --> 02:18:51,921
       I really felt that.      

2030
02:18:51,923 --> 02:18:55,057
     Because of hearing him     
and the guilt feeling, you know,

2031
02:18:55,059 --> 02:18:58,695
 that I kept saying, "Why don't 
   you die, for Christ sakes."  

2032
02:18:58,697 --> 02:19:01,831
   And the other guys told me   
  that they felt the same way.  

2033
02:19:01,833 --> 02:19:06,669
        We were so tired,       
    we just wanted to sleep.    

2034
02:19:07,805 --> 02:19:08,871
    When you wish a guy dead    

2035
02:19:08,873 --> 02:19:11,841
     and it turns out to be     
   your best friend, you know,  

2036
02:19:11,843 --> 02:19:14,510
        it's... the pits.
