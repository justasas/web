(DISTANT EXPLOSIONS)

2
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:41,327
MAN: You had no possessions at all.

3
00:00:41,327 --> 00:00:44,967
You would cut everything down
to the simplest,

4
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:47,162
'cause you had to carry everything.

5
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:53,447
When we were marching
from one horror to another

6
00:00:53,447 --> 00:00:59,927
I had shoepacs on because
the ground was always wet or frozen.

7
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,567
I had two pairs of woollen socks.

8
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:09,887
In my pockets I carried probably
a couple of boxes of K-rations.

9
00:01:09,887 --> 00:01:14,807
I had never had a toothbrush at all.
I didn't take a shower for six months.

10
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:18,807
No change of underwear at all.

11
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:22,607
No change of clothes at all for months.

12
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:26,207
And I had a sleeping-bag which I carried
with a rope over my shoulder,

13
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:27,686
like a tramp.

14
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:33,277
And that's all I had.

15
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:41,247
NARRATOR: More than 16 million
Americans served in the armed forces

16
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:42,887
during the war.

17
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:48,007
The vast majority of them
never saw serious combat.

18
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:53,923
The infantry represented
just 14% of the troops overseas.

19
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:00,167
But wherever they fought -

20
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:05,127
in North Africa or the South Pacific
or western Europe -

21
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:09,127
the infantry bore the brunt
of the fighting on the ground

22
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:13,647
and suffered 7 out of 10 casualties.

23
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:18,247
And they endured hardships and horrors

24
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:21,364
for which no training
could ever have prepared them.

25
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:29,247
MAN: You know, you get hardened to it.

26
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:32,287
I stayed in a hole for an hour and a half

27
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:34,927
or something like that -
it seemed like that anyway -

28
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:36,967
with a dead German.

29
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:38,967
And it's kind of an eerie feeling.

30
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:43,727
But you're so worried, really,

31
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:46,807
about yourself at that time

32
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:48,647
that you didn't think too much about it.

33
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:53,167
But you get really hardened to seeing

34
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:56,847
a lot of gruesome sights.

35
00:02:56,847 --> 00:02:59,887
And that worries you
as much as anything.

36
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:03,487
You think, "My gosh,
I saw so-and-so get killed today,

37
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:06,687
"and then he got run over by a tank
and just a horrible mess,

38
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,803
"and it didn't bother me at all."

39
00:03:24,647 --> 00:03:27,847
In western Europe in early 1945,

40
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:32,327
Allied troops had gained back every
snowy inch of the territory they'd lost

41
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:35,007
during the Battle of the Bulge,

42
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:40,207
and vast American and British armies
were probing enemy defences,

43
00:03:40,207 --> 00:03:44,485
seeking a way across the Rhine
and into the German heartland.

44
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:54,927
Meanwhile, their Soviet allies
were rolling westward towards Berlin,

45
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:57,157
driving the Nazis before them.

46
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:06,087
In the Pacific, US forces were readying
an assault on a tiny volcanic island

47
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:13,527
that would be remembered forever
as a symbol of war's worst savagery -

48
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:15,483
Iwo Jima.

49
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:26,207
Behind enemy lines
on both sides of the globe,

50
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:30,807
German and Japanese cities
were disappearing in flames

51
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:35,085
and American prisoners
dared begin to hope for rescue.

52
00:04:38,087 --> 00:04:42,727
11 -year-old Sascha Weinzheimer,
a captive of the Japanese,

53
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:47,687
whose fondest dream was that
her life might simply return to normal,

54
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,887
would have the happiest day of her life.

55
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:53,247
While in Germany,

56
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:57,447
Tom Galloway, of Mobile,
would also taste freedom for a time,

57
00:04:57,447 --> 00:05:00,996
and then have it cruelly
snatched away again.

58
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:34,207
On January 8,
an American plane had flown low

59
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:36,807
over Santo Tomas Prison Camp
in Manila

60
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:43,327
and dropped leaflets addressed
to the people of the Philippines.

61
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:46,807
"General MacArthur has returned,"
they said.

62
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:50,087
"He will tell you over the radio,

63
00:05:50,087 --> 00:05:52,207
"in proclamation and leaflet,

64
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:56,767
"exactly how and when you can help.

65
00:05:56,767 --> 00:06:01,079
"Watch closely for these instructions."

66
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:23,007
GIRL: "Gosh! Maybe soon we can sing
'God Bless America' out loud.

67
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:26,007
"Maybe we can see our flag flying again.

68
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:31,604
"What a thrill it will be when
our first boys come through that gate.

69
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:38,927
"Mother says we fought this war too,

70
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:42,527
"like soldiers.

71
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,927
"People are dying every day
from starvation.

72
00:06:46,927 --> 00:06:50,527
"Fred Fairman and Mrs Everett
yesterday.

73
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:53,247
"We have such a short time to go.

74
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,887
"What a pity they couldn't hang on to life
just a while longer.

75
00:06:56,887 --> 00:06:59,607
"Mother weighs only 73 pounds.

76
00:06:59,607 --> 00:07:01,607
"She used to weigh 148.

77
00:07:01,607 --> 00:07:05,127
"And Dr Allen says
she has to stay in bed from now on

78
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:07,516
"because she can't walk."

79
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:15,647
WOMAN: When I'd get bouts
of really severe hunger -

80
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:18,407
it comes over you like waves -

81
00:07:18,407 --> 00:07:23,367
and then I'd do something to distract me.

82
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:28,047
Like drumming on the side of the shanty,
or making noise,

83
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,047
or even go screaming a little bit,

84
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,567
just to get it out of your system,
and then I'd go on.

85
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:39,247
But the kids would cry

86
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:41,807
and grab their throat,

87
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:45,087
or they'd grab their belly
and go up to my mother.

88
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:49,607
That probably was a very bad thing,

89
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:52,883
you know, to see your kids do.

90
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:59,447
GIRL: "January 17.

91
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:02,767
"Buddy's favourite expression is,
'Let's talk about food.'

92
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:07,807
"He has a favourite suit too,
which he calls his 'gate suit'.

93
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:11,247
"He's been taking this suit out
almost every day for months,

94
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:13,167
"putting it on the bed and saying,

95
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:17,687
"'I'll put my gate things right here,
Mummy, so I can be ready.'

96
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:21,807

98
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:33,881
"'I don't need a thing for the gate except
two good legs to walk out with,' he said.

99
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:39,727
"February 1.

100
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,007
"This morning, Aunty Bee came to visit.

101
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,407
"She works in the hospital.

102
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:52,642
"She says the doctors expect seven
more to die today, all from starvation."

103
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:28,967
MAN: To me, the real heroes of the war
were those who very seldom get medals.

104
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,037
They're the medics.

105
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:36,087
Whenever a man gets injured,

106
00:09:36,087 --> 00:09:41,207
he very, very seldom calls out
for his sweetheart or his mother.

107
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:45,047
First thing he calls out is the medic.

108
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:48,527
He always says, "Medic!"

109
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:54,367
And whenever that word is heard,
the medic rushes over.

110
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:57,803
And to rush over,
he is just dodging bullets.

111
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:03,367
That takes guts.

112
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:29,247
MAN: Munitions are a terrible thing.

113
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,847
It tears a person apart.

114
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:36,207
It's not a clean cut - it tears, it rips.

115
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:39,727
I can't imagine what
the medics went through.

116
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:41,207
You know, they were right there,

117
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,207
and they were patching people up
who were bleeding to death.

118
00:10:44,207 --> 00:10:46,801
So my heart goes out to those boys.

119
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:54,207
Medics were paid $10 less per month
than the men they tried to save.

120
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:59,327
Many were pacifists
and conscientious objectors,

121
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:04,720
unwilling to take lives, but willing
to risk their own lives to save others.

122
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:21,843
Like the men they tended,
they learned to improvise in combat.

123
00:11:28,807 --> 00:11:31,407
During the Battle of the Bulge,

124
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:38,007
they kept morphine and plasma inside
their shorts to keep it from freezing.

125
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:43,167
In the Pacific, some dyed the
red crosses on their helmets green

126
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:47,001
to make themselves less likely targets
for the Japanese.

127
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:56,207
And everywhere, they were forced
to make terrible choices.

128
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:59,607
MAN: If you're in a firefight

129
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:03,767
and you see a party that is wounded

130
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:08,807
in a way that you know
he cannot survive,

131
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:11,927
you must pass him by,

132
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:16,927
even though he may be
calling to you for help,

133
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:23,207
and you must doctor somebody
whose life you potentially can save.

134
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:27,447
And it's a terrible decision
you have to make

135
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:33,647
to pass somebody by
who is in need of comfort

136
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:36,087
but is not going to live.

137
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:41,480
It's never pleasant
to do the work of a medic.

138
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:50,079
But it's one of the essentials
of civilised behaviour.

139
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:06,561
There were some wounds
no medic could treat.

140
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:19,767
What were you afraid of?

141
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:23,207
(Mumbles) Dead people.
I can't stand seeing them.

142
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:26,438
I can't hear you.
I can't stand seeing dead people.

143
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:32,967
There were many names for it -

144
00:13:32,967 --> 00:13:38,567
'shell shock', 'battle fatigue',
'combat exhaustion'.

145
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,407
One out of four of all the army men

146
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:45,007
evacuated for medical reasons
in Europe and the Pacific

147
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:49,327
suffered from some form
of neuropsychiatric disorder.

(EXPLOSION, GUNFIRE)

149
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:54,487
Army planners determined
that the average soldier

150
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:58,327
could withstand no more
than 240 days of combat

151
00:13:58,327 --> 00:13:59,999
without going mad.

152
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:08,807
By that time, though,

153
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:13,756
the average soldier was more than likely
dead or wounded.

WOMAN: During that time,
they had a lot of pin-up girls.

165
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:12,807
Betty Grable had a picture of herself
in her bathing suit,

166
00:15:12,807 --> 00:15:16,887
and she's glancing back
over her shoulder.

167
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:20,927
And it's a back view
and, oh, it was gorgeous.

168
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:27,287
So I says, "My Norman is going
to have his own pin-up picture."

169
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:30,727
And I had a red and white
polka-dot bikini.

00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:33,047
But you could either wear it low,

if you had enough nerve to do it,

172
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:39,127
or you could wear it
all the way to the top.

173
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:42,887
Well, anyway,
I put on my red and white bikini

174
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:46,607
and went out in the backyard
and I gave my mother my camera.

175
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:49,047
I says, "Here. Take a picture.

176
00:15:49,047 --> 00:15:52,207
"I want to send it to Norman.

177
00:15:52,207 --> 00:15:54,437

And he carried that
through the war with him,

179
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,927
and he said that he received
a lot of comments

180
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:07,247
from his buddies
when they saw that picture,

181
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:10,367
because after some of them saw it,

182
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:13,207
they looked at him,
and they looked back at the picture,

183
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:17,367
and they looked at him again, and
they says, "What does she see in you?"

184
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,967
(Laughs)

185
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:25,207
And I had a picture of him on my desk,
one that he took in France,

186
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:28,438
so I was with him and he was with me.

191

"and a lucky friend of ours found it,

192
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:23,847
"because we found out right away
what it said -

00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:30,167
"'Roll out the barrel! Your Christmas
will be here today or tomorrow.'

194
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:35,047
"Shortly, we heard guns and tanks
in the distance.

195
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:40,487
"Everyone thought it must be the Japs,

The liberation was the most
exciting thing in my life.

And if I cry, you'll forgive me.

200
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:14,286
So, on 3 February, my father
walked me to the main building.

201
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:24,647
But while we were walking, we heard
these big rumblings in the distance.

202
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,567
And usually when that happened,
we could...

203
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:29,127
...alright, we had trained ears
by this point.

204
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:33,007
We knew it was the big bombers
coming overhead.

205
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:35,407
But as we walked, we noticed the...

206
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:41,407
...the noise was getting louder and louder
but there was no planes appearing.

207
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:43,287
And we thought that was weird.

208
00:18:43,287 --> 00:18:45,047
And people were coming
out of their shacks

209
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:47,925
and saying, "Gee!
This is a different thing."

210
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:58,961
And we heard guns going off.

211
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:07,607
The Brits were saying, "Oh, it's the Brits!
The Brits are coming!

212
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:10,047
"They're here! The limeys are here!"

213
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:14,167
And the Americans said, "Don't be silly.
This is the Americans coming."

214
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:18,647
So, we were doing...
rushing back and forth,

215
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:22,807
and because of the fire -
the firing and the noise -

216
00:19:22,807 --> 00:19:26,287
people were just running around,
you know?

217
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:29,367
They weren't staying put.

218
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:32,647
All of a sudden -
and we didn't know this till later -

219
00:19:32,647 --> 00:19:39,847
it was, like,
three minutes to 9:00 in the evening,

220
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:45,205
they came through, crashed through
the front gates with their tanks.

221
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,887
And it was wonderful.

222
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,367
People went crazy.

00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:56,207
You'd think the war was over,
but it wasn't.

My mother was bedridden
and 73 pounds.

225
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,447
My mother always said,

226
00:20:04,447 --> 00:20:11,487
"Now, let's always keep one item to wear
when our boys come in."

227
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:14,847
So she had a half-eaten lipstick.

228
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:19,127
I had something, I forget,
a sock, which is now, you know...

229
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:22,247
...no shoes, there's no point
in wearing a sock.

230
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:26,607
My sister had a clip, a barrette.

231
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:31,367
And so when my father picked up
my mother and ran out of the shanty,

232
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:34,287
she says, "Wait! Wait!"

233
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:37,567
So he couldn't understand why.
She said, "Go back."

234
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,247
So she reached underneath
her mattress

235
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:44,447
and pulled out her lipstick and put it on.

236
00:20:44,447 --> 00:20:46,881

We would see some of the maps
on the paper,

00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:29,807
on the newspapers on the stands

from Fort Deposit, Alabama,

Frazier had then been so certain
he would die

282
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:17,007
that he had thrown his dog tags
into a mass grave

283
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:19,327
so that when they were found

284
00:25:19,327 --> 00:25:23,286
his parents would have some idea
of what had happened to him.

Now, with the Philippines retaken,

286

American troops came upon the grave.

287
00:25:33,727 --> 00:25:38,007
FRAZIER: So then they found
the dog tags that I threw in the grave.

288
00:25:38,007 --> 00:25:44,167
So they had absolute proof
that I was in that mass grave.

289
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,247
So they take the dog tags

to my mother and dad

and tried to settle the insurance.

"what happens then?"

And he says, "You'll have to pay it back."

can make it, my son can make it.

Most were women.

338
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:40,197
More than 100,000 were children.

NEWSREEL: Airborne,
the B-29s head for Tokyo.

341
00:29:55,007 --> 00:29:58,087
The giant bombers,
equipped to range over 5,000 miles,

342
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:03,087
now swiftly cover the 1,500 miles
from Saipan to their objective

343
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:06,607
to open the full-fledged air war
against Japan.

344
00:30:06,607 --> 00:30:12,967
Allied planners hoped the kind of
bombing that had levelled German cities

345
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:14,927
would destroy the Japanese will to resist

346
00:30:14,927 --> 00:30:18,607
and make unnecessary
the bloody invasion

347
00:30:18,607 --> 00:30:21,487
that otherwise seemed inevitable.

348
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:25,887
American B-29s could now reach
the enemy's homeland

349
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:28,407
from Saipan and Tinian,

350
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:31,647
but roughly halfway between them
and Japan itself

351
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:36,687
lay a tiny volcanic island - Iwo Jima.

352
00:30:36,687 --> 00:30:39,727
It was an otherworldly place -

353
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:43,687
barely eight square, barren miles
of rock and ash,

354
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:48,447
reeking of sulfur,
without safe drinking water.

355
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,167
But it had an airstrip

356
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:54,087
from which Japanese fighters
rose to harass American bombers

357
00:30:54,087 --> 00:30:58,407
as they flew to and from
their mainland targets.

358
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:01,847
American commanders
wanted the island taken.

359
00:31:01,847 --> 00:31:05,965
Then they could make it a haven
for their crippled bombers.

360
00:31:14,407 --> 00:31:17,007
For 72 straight days,

361
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:21,287
American bombers pounded lwo Jima
and its defenders

362
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:25,963
with some 6,000 tons of high explosives.

363
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:42,160
Three more days followed
of ceaseless shelling by the navy.

364
00:31:58,487 --> 00:32:03,247
In the early morning
of February 19, 1945,

365
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:07,240
the marines started toward the island.

366
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:11,887
Most were veterans of earlier landings -

367
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:16,085
Saipan, Tinian, Peleliu.

368
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:37,766
The first three waves
met little resistance.

369
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:44,087
Some began to think
this invasion would be different,

370
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,127
that for once
the pre-invasion bombardment

371
00:32:47,127 --> 00:32:50,881
really had knocked out
the island's defences.

372
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:57,123
It had not.

373
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:05,247
Some 21,000 Japanese soldiers
were waiting for the Americans

374
00:33:05,247 --> 00:33:10,607
inside a virtually impenetrable network
of tunnels and bunkers.

375
00:33:10,607 --> 00:33:17,080
As the fourth wave neared the beach,
the enemy opened fire.

376
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:49,684
Sergeant Ray Pittman, of Mobile,
was there.

00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:59,767
MAN: Going into lwo Jima,

378
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:02,122
I was a squad leader by that time.

379
00:34:07,287 --> 00:34:09,807
And I always looked around
and wondered,

380
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:12,799
"Now, how many men
am I going to lose?"

381
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:18,436
Course, we didn't know it was
going to be bad as it was.

382
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:54,047
The fighting would go on
for nearly a month

383
00:34:54,047 --> 00:34:56,959
before the Americans took the island.

384
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:39,599
The Japanese lost their entire garrison.

385
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:46,967
Once again, they had never intended
to surrender.

386
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:50,967
Their mission was to kill
as many Americans as possible

387
00:35:50,967 --> 00:35:53,845
before they were killed themselves.

388
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:04,247
6,821 Americans died -

389
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:07,683
five times the number killed
on Guadalcanal or Saipan.

390
00:36:09,607 --> 00:36:14,167
Among the dead were
Private David Harris, of Luverne,

391
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:17,567
Corporal John B. Zwanch, of Waterbury,

392

Private Zera Richards, of Sacramento,

393
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:25,807
and Sergeant James Albert Chambliss,
of Mobile.

394
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:31,767
27 Medals of Honor were awarded
to those who fought on lwo Jima.

395
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:36,767
13 of them had to be given
posthumously.

396
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:40,847
So many of the men in one unit
were lost

397
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:45,727
that it came to be called
the 'X-Ray Company'.

398
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:51,643
Of the 16 men in Ray Pittman's squad,
only he and two others were left.

00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:26,527
But, uh...

403
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:30,607
...it, uh... it's really...

404
00:37:30,607 --> 00:37:34,487
...it's really hard to explain
just how you feel,

405
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:39,807
because I came home and married
and raised a family

406
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:43,127
and lived a real happy life after the war.

407
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:46,967
But so many of them left their blood
on the sand

408
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:49,407
on lwo Jima, Saipan and Tinian,

409
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:52,638
that they didn't have that chance.

410
00:38:03,527 --> 00:38:08,367
With the airstrip on lwo Jima
in their hands,

411
00:38:08,367 --> 00:38:12,647
the Americans were one big step closer
to the Japanese homeland.

412
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:17,647
American bombers
were now free to attack it at will.

the type that has been
devastating Tokyo with flame.

416
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:34,807
This is how it was tried out -
a blazing sweep of jellied gasoline.

That's the incendiary material,
a newly developed form of ordinary gas,

418

gelled in a way that gives it
a volcanic force of blazing devastation.

On the night of March 9, 1945,

420
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:55,559
firebombing came to the cities of Japan.

421
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:05,527
334 American B-29s
roared in low over Tokyo

422
00:39:05,527 --> 00:39:10,442
and dropped hundreds of thousands
of 70-pound napalm bombs.

16 square miles of the city,

424
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:23,127
built largely of pine and paper
and bamboo,

00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,880
burst into flame.

were left without homes.

to hit Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe,

Some 50,000 more people were killed.

FRAZIER: When the bombing
started in our area,

432
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:20,767
first it was about once every two weeks,

433
00:40:20,767 --> 00:40:26,767
then it was a raid about every week,
then it stepped up.

434
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:30,367
And most of the raids started at night
with the B-29s,

435
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:34,207
and you could hear the B-29,
you could distinguish their sound,

436
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:36,767
and all of a sudden you could hear
these Zeros up there

437
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,645
trying to - and the gunfire -
trying to shoot them down.

438
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:49,247
And we knew that Americans
were getting closer.

439
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:56,167
But they also told us that
if any American landed on their soil,

440
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:58,927
that we would all be shot, the POWs,

441
00:40:58,927 --> 00:41:02,124
that all guards had the ability
to shoot you.

442
00:41:06,447 --> 00:41:10,927
American B-29s continued
to firebomb Japanese cities,

443
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:16,160
eventually forcing more than
8 million people from their homes.

444
00:41:20,087 --> 00:41:22,847
The Fifth Air Force printed up
a pamphlet

445
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:28,319
to reassure pilots who might have felt
uneasy about killing so many civilians.

446
00:41:29,807 --> 00:41:34,887
"The entire population
was a proper military target," it said,

447
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:38,687
"since the Japanese Government
had ordered all men and women

448
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:42,885
"to enlist in a volunteer defence corps.

449
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:52,081
"For us," the pamphlet continued,
"there are no civilians."

FUSSELL: The German Army
had been beaten up very badly,

451
00:42:21,127 --> 00:42:25,837
and not just in France,
but other places they'd been.

452
00:42:27,047 --> 00:42:33,805
Also, Russia was beating the hell
out of them in the other direction.

453
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,967
It wasn't child's play beating them,

454
00:42:37,967 --> 00:42:40,925
but it was clear they were
going to be defeated.

455
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:48,527
And so we really had them in the bag.

456
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:51,287
And at that moment, I knew
we were going to win this war.

457
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:55,567
As soon as the ice goes away
and spring comes again,

458
00:42:55,567 --> 00:42:59,355
we get on the attacking
frame of mind again.

459
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:02,719
We're going to win.

460
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:16,367
By the middle of March 1945,

461
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:20,367
hundreds of thousands of Americans
were crossing the Rhine

462
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:23,564
and driving into the heart
of Nazi Germany.

463
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:34,607
When George Patton
and his Third Army

464
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:36,847
began to cross near Frankfurt,

465
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:40,887
the general stopped
halfway across the pontoon bridge.

466
00:43:40,887 --> 00:43:44,167
He'd always wanted
to piss in the Rhine, he said,

467
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:48,160
and in full view of his men, he did.

468
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:04,367
Then Patton learned that his son-in-law,

469
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:07,367
who had been captured
in North Africa two years earlier,

470
00:44:07,367 --> 00:44:11,767
was being held in a German POW camp
near Hammelburg.

471
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:15,167
It was some 40 miles
behind the German lines,

472
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:18,007
but Patton didn't care.

473
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:20,247
He dispatched a special task force -

474
00:44:20,247 --> 00:44:25,487
16 tanks, 27 half-tracks, and 300 men -

475
00:44:25,487 --> 00:44:29,526
to free his daughter's husband
right away.

476
00:44:31,687 --> 00:44:35,607
Meanwhile, at the POW camp,

477
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:39,367
the prisoners had heard that
the Americans had crossed the Rhine,

478
00:44:39,367 --> 00:44:44,847
and believed that it was only a matter
of time before they would be liberated.

479
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:48,687
Tom Galloway,
who had been forced to surrender

480
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,807
early in the Battle of the Bulge,

481
00:44:50,807 --> 00:44:52,607
was among the prisoners.

482
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,727
GALLOWAY: But you couldn't get
too excited about anything -

483
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:58,487
you were too hungry.

484
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:03,527
Hunger was just foremost
in everybody's mind

485
00:45:03,527 --> 00:45:06,287
when you just stay hungry all the time.

486
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:13,087
I probably lost about 50 pounds
in just a few months.

487
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:17,847
MAN: Well, you're just cold all the time.

488
00:45:17,847 --> 00:45:21,767
I went three months
without ever taking my clothes off.

489
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:24,327
You just stayed in your clothes
24 hours a day.

490
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:27,087
You took your boots off -
we had boots -

491
00:45:27,087 --> 00:45:32,367
and you'd tie them to your bunk at night
because they may get stolen.

492
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:37,847
Second Lieutenant Herndon Inge
was also from Mobile.

493
00:45:37,847 --> 00:45:40,967
He too had been captured at the Bulge.

494
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:43,167
INGE: When I was at Hammelburg,

495
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:48,007
I heard that there was a prisoner
in another hut from Alabama,

496
00:45:48,007 --> 00:45:49,807
so I looked him up.

497
00:45:49,807 --> 00:45:53,967
A skinny, dirty fellow came up to me
and wanted to know if I...

498
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:56,087
He said he heard I was from Mobile.

499
00:45:56,087 --> 00:46:03,247
And it turns out it was Herndon Inge,
whom we call 'Wanky'.

500
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:07,887
And he and I were raised probably
about eight blocks from each other.

501
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:13,166
He knew my brothers and sisters,
and we've been fast friends ever since.

502
00:46:14,927 --> 00:46:21,526
On March 27, Patton's task force
reached the prison camp.

503
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:33,847
INGE: Everybody was
cheering and jubilant

504
00:46:33,847 --> 00:46:39,604
over the fact that at last we were
going to be taken to good food.

505
00:46:49,727 --> 00:46:52,844
Then someone started shooting.

506
00:46:55,287 --> 00:46:59,247
In the confusion,
Patton's son-in-law was hit by a bullet

507
00:46:59,247 --> 00:47:01,967
and rushed to the camp hospital,

508
00:47:01,967 --> 00:47:03,958
too badly wounded to be liberated.

509
00:47:10,167 --> 00:47:15,367
GALLOWAY: Then they said,
"We're going to move out."

510
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:19,367
They said,
"If you want to go, you can go,"

511
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:24,607
but some went back into prison
and some took off.

512
00:47:24,607 --> 00:47:27,967
I took off - two others and myself.

513
00:47:27,967 --> 00:47:32,807
More than 1,200 Americans
ran out of the camp,

514
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:37,119
but there were only enough vehicles
to carry 250.

515
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:43,438
Thousands of Germans
quickly surrounded them.

516
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,287
The freed prisoners scattered.

517
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:57,167
Most, including Herndon Inge,
were recaptured right away.

518
00:47:57,167 --> 00:48:01,487
But Tom Galloway and his two buddies
had managed to escape

519
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:06,481
and were trying to make it
to the American lines on foot.

520
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:12,247
GALLOWAY:
We had passed a farmhouse

521
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:15,967
with barns, outbuilding
and a small chapel.

522
00:48:15,967 --> 00:48:18,207
So I told them, and I said, "Look..."

523
00:48:18,207 --> 00:48:22,807
By the way, it was Good Friday -
Friday before Easter.

524
00:48:22,807 --> 00:48:25,167
And I said, "This is..."

525
00:48:25,167 --> 00:48:30,007
That part of Germany,
Bavaria, was mostly Catholic.

526
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,087
A matter of fact,
I thought it was all Catholic.

527
00:48:32,087 --> 00:48:37,727
I told them, "3:00 on Good Friday,
they're going to be in church

528
00:48:37,727 --> 00:48:41,487
"and we're going to go in there and
get in that barn that we saw last night

529
00:48:41,487 --> 00:48:43,167
"and get out of this weather."

530
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:48,967
Well, we broke across the field
just as fast as we could go

531
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,967
and ran in that barn.

532
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:56,167
And I think we hit the only
Protestant family in that part of Bavaria.

533
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,967
(Laughs) They were all in the barn!

534
00:48:57,967 --> 00:49:02,367
So, our luck ran out at that point.

535
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:08,567
Soon, Tom Galloway too
was back behind barbed wire.

536
00:49:08,567 --> 00:49:13,766
He and Herndon Inge would have to wait
to be freed once again.

537
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:32,407
MAN: "Luverne, Minnesota,
March 29, 1945.

538
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:36,087
"A number of the boys in service
have mentioned in their letters

539
00:49:36,087 --> 00:49:39,327
"they'd like to know how things
are going back home.

540
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,921
"Dear gang...

541
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:47,847
"...today started off with a big mistake

542
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:51,887
"caused by an overenthusiastic
radio broadcaster,

543
00:49:51,887 --> 00:49:55,880
"who got the idea that a victory flash
was coming up in a few minutes.

544
00:49:57,887 --> 00:50:02,367
"To tell you the truth, it didn't cause
much of a flurry on Main Street.

545
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,607
"People have had tentative dates
for victory before

546
00:50:05,607 --> 00:50:08,075
"and have seen their hopes dashed.

547
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:14,207
"So they've made up their minds
to keep their heads down

548
00:50:14,207 --> 00:50:17,961
"and keep working until there
is no doubt of victory anymore."

549
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:26,327
By the end of March 1945,

550
00:50:26,327 --> 00:50:31,727
American forces were steadily gathering
for their next target in the Pacific war -

551
00:50:31,727 --> 00:50:36,960
the big, densely populated island
of Okinawa.

552
00:50:38,847 --> 00:50:43,207
The British had taken back Mandalay
in Burma.

553
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:47,487
The Russians were within
50 miles of Berlin.

554
00:50:47,487 --> 00:50:52,527
But Hitler continued
to exhort his people to resist,

555
00:50:52,527 --> 00:50:55,407
and the militarists who governed Japan

556
00:50:55,407 --> 00:51:01,287
were calling upon every man, woman
and child to fight to the death

557
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:04,563
against the American invasion
they knew was coming.
