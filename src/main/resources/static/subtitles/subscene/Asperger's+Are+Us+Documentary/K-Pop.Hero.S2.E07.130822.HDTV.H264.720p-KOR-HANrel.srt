knows their leader, G-Dragon.

There's always a dance festival and
my mom makes me to participate.

9
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,050
- I hated that when I was young.
- She did that because you were good.

10

"Anyone come up." Then several
of us go up and dance.

11

Must have been fun.

12
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,600
- You must have won many prizes.
- I used to do that too.

Okay... well, I went every week
and I won every time I went.

- House must have been filled.

went to a ski resort.

16

The MC was Lee Soo-man.

17
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,730
- It must be a long time ago.
- Yes, he was the MC.

18
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,670
I won the festival and
went to his agency.

19
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:36,660
I first got into SM. After 5 years
of training, I switched to YG.

20

G-Dragon was recognized
by all the heads.

21

He's been building up his
own stage since he was young.

That is when I can show
something great to people.

30
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,780
Since I must do better before I debut,
I don't think 6 years is a waste.

31
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,640
Kwon Ji-yong will be the leader
of this group in this project.

32
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,860
He already signed up because
of his exceptional skills...

33
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:27,810
But looking at the mischief in his eyes,
he's the same when he came here 6 years ago.

34
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:38,780
When I see him, I can tell what
good dancing and singing is.

35
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,450
He has exceptional skills in singing,
rapping, and dancing that people envy.

36
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,070
His peers recognize that as well.

37
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:02,930
Since he prepared longer than others,
he thirsts to debut as a singer even more.

38
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,310
Since I was here longer
than others for 5-6 years...

39

our album isn't a success...

more disappointed than them.

The door of success opens
only to those that knock.

42

He doesn't sit and wait for
the day he dreamt to come.

43

He's a perfectionist
who's hard on himself.

have ended with just listening to it...

138
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,640
- Since it's criticism?
- Yes, that's right.

139
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,310
But there were comments like,
"Why don't you go kill yourself?"

140
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,920
That was all of a sudden.

141
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:54,810
It made me think, "What did I do
for that person to think that way?"

142
00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:02,270
I should overcome it instead of falling into it
if it's what I'm going to do and it's my dream.

is something I need to put up with...

144
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:13,120
I received a lot of help from my members
and instead of being swayed by this...

145
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:21,280
There are many that will be at ease
and dream by listening to my music.

146

- That's right.

[Am I dreaming?]

169
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,610
[Was this song this cool?]

170
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:42,300
[Boom's only best song released in 2006
that never made it into the gayo rankings]

171
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,270
[That's my song!]

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,450

my song today!]

["Boom Up" is reborn]

"Oh Yeah" made KPOP STAR
to shine even more.

179
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,520
And the best hip-hop collaboration
that made even his members dance.

the ensemble room]

[G-Dragon writes the rap part for
the "I Don't Care" ensemble]

182
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,710
You can start whenever
you feel like it.

183
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,660
It's going to be strange.

184
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,430
What's it about?

185
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:45,890
Well... you're saying "I don't care"
from a woman's position...

186
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,280
But the man would have
something to say as well.

187
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,030
- So it's a response. A fight...
- You might think it's an excuse.

188
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,190
An impromptu rap revealed
another charm to this song.

189
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,000
This is the unplugged version
of 2NE1's "I Don't Care."

190
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,080
I'm a free spirit
Like you said

191
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,210
You're just a type of insurance
It's just a risk for me

192
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,470
Better put aside the thought
Of keeping me on a leash

193
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:37,580
Why don't care
This wasn't my plan

194
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:44,130
I just need a help
Because of my fault

195
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,740
It's all over
Guess I'm new to love

196
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,690
I just kept my pride as a man

197
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,980
I wasn't even able
To say sorry

198
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,300
Just understand me this time
This will be the last, please

199
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,390

Number one is the stage with
guitar prodigy Sungha Jung.

[We Are GD's Family Family Family]

202
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:50,250
YG is GD's top mentor.

203
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:56,100
He's the one that made him
into G-Dragon and an artist.

204
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,340
He couldn't train hard
since he had the cold...

205
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,120
Ji-yong?

206
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:07,840
He had a bad cold that very day,
but he sang better than expected.

207
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,900
He strained his throat because
he didn't do much singing before.

208
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:20,940
He lost his voice after
recording 3 or 4 times.

209
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,290
Let's watch him singing.

210
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:31,970
After the project was announced,
the first test video was shown.

211
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,880
This is how YG periodically checks
and assesses the trainees.

212
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,960
That's why he recorded again even
though he went over his alloted time.

213
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:54,410
YG watched the clip of Ji-yong in
silence and then speaks his mind.

214
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:59,550
I don't expect much from Ji-yong.

215
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,950
Ji-yong and Young-bae have
the best expressions...

216
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:06,620
Ji-yong actually improved a lot
in singing here in this clip.

217
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:11,660
He hated singing, but
he's feeling it right now.

218
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,410
- I don't think singing suits him...
- No, I like that sweet voice.

219
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:19,530
I don't expect him to sing well
like singing R&B songs...

220
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:27,230
I just want him to sing melodies like rap.
Chris Brown's song he's singing suits him.

221
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:33,630
It's unprecedented for the agency head
to ask to meet the trainees first.

222
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:41,810
They're on pins and needles since
they made a mistake at the Japan concert.

223
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:53,380
They're all tense that he might say
something that will hurt them.

224
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,820
He's coming.

225
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:07,370
- Is this his seat?
- They want to avoid this time.

226
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,310
- Hello.
- It's been a while.

227
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:25,820
I'm thinking... Ji-yong and Young-bae,
you guys were here for 6 years, right?

228
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:32,700
They were here for 6 years, but
I treat them the same as you guys.

229
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,130
Just because they were here longer
doesn't mean I'm more friendly to them.

230
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:41,150
It's your skills that matter in the end.

231
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:48,140
I was dumbfounded when I saw Ji-yong and
Young-bae at Se7en's concert in Japan.

232
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,370
I thought if you guys are the ones
we're looking forward to.

233
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:04,090
That performance was barely 15 points.
I wanted to crawl under a rock.

234
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:10,140
6 years isn't short. What were you
doing there? Especially Young-bae.

235
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:22,680
What did you do for
the past 6 years?

236
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:29,010
I was really upset, but I'm not here
to scold or get angry at you guys.

237
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:33,380
If you guys are going to debut in August,
it will be decided at the end of May.

238
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:39,680
I don't know if one or four
will drop out of this group.

239
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:46,900
I'm going to call you again at
the end of May and tell you.

240
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:52,400
We can continue to see each other but can't
work together if you don't have the skills.

241
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,970
YG had a hardened look since what
he said was flat and heartless.

242
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,380
Then he saw Ji-yong smiling.

243
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,130
Ji-yong, want to go home
after 6 years of training?

244
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:20,030
Just like what you said,
YG is, I don't know, brusque?

245
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,500
- Even now?
- Not anymore.

246
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,380
He's more easygoing
now that he's married.

247
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:36,730
Even until 3 years ago, he never
smiled or treated us kindly.

248
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:42,560
I still fear him and can't
even step on his shadow.

249
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:52,010
Your juniors trained harder after he scolded
them that they'll become like Young-bae.

250
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,660
That's his method.

251
00:34:54,660 --> 00:35:00,510
He makes you as embarrassed
as possible in front of others.

252
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:06,220
But it's not in front of other
agency people or the public...

253
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,250
What's the harshest thing he said
to you in front of your agency family?

254
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,870
For me...

255
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:18,110
It might seem like nothing, but I'm
getting emotional thinking about it.

256
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,080
Let's see...

257
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:27,570
For example, he would say I'm the
root of all evil in BIGBANG.

258
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,800
He would say such things.

259
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,510
- Then am I...
- Of no use?

260
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:47,730
I tried so hard but then I'll think
if what he said about me is true.

261
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:54,160
He first says the worst thing
possible to everyone.

262
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,380
So that we'll be able to overcome
anything we hear later on.

263
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:05,600
Since we're used to it now,
even if YG says something...

264
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,180
We think, "You just wait."

265
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,650
He loves that and we understand him.

266
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:20,510
That's how he trained us.
And now we're strong.

267
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:26,760
That's what he says to us, but he
compliments us when he's outside.

268
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,720
We hear that from others.

269
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,040
Then that...

270
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,860
- It strengthens you.
- Yes, it does.

271
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,800
He's happier than anyone.

272
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,060
Another thing is that he goes
around boasting that he made us.

273
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,420
Do you agree?

274
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:52,060
YG's a scary mentor, but he takes care of
G-Dragon more than anyone in YG Family.

275
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,600
He's the best partner
and family member.

276
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,560
Who is the best rapper?

277
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,330
Don't yield because if you do,
you'll be the worst rapper.

278
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,190
Will the handsome guy speak first?

279
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,380
Our styles are different...

280
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,100
They're different but...

281
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,480
He's serious and I'm free.

282
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,330
He's much better.

283
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,580
- So serious and free?
- Yes.

284
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:28,370
The standard for what's
good or bad rapping is...

285
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:31,020
There is a standard.

286
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:36,810
I think it depends.
Then I'm curious...

287
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:42,680
Does Park Myeong-su's comedy have
more quality or Tak Jae-hoon...

288
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,130
Tak Jae-hoon!

289
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,940
[Thanks]

290
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,280
[- You should be on my side!
- Actually, I'm on his side]

291
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,860
- It's Myeong-su!
- It's Tak Jae-hoon!

292
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,290
I said it's Myeong-su!

293
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,270
It's Myeong-su!
He's the best!

294
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:11,230
Daesung, your face?

295
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,960
[Unfortunately, they're
resembling each other...]

296
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:18,820
I think they're on par so...

297
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,690
- Let's see them rap.
- You can rap or...

298
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,290
[G-Dragon goes first!]

299
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,950
I'll go first.

300
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:32,760
You got the lead.
One, two, three!

301
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,550
[He stays centered!]

302

[They have good teamwork for
being together for many years]

304
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,640
That's it.

305
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:03,690
They produce a synergistic effect when
together and form a unit later on.

306
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,700
Their first album as GD&TOP
was released in 2010.

307
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,320
They showed a refined music and stage based
on their musical background of hip-hop.

308
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,760
[Electronica and hip-hop were
combined in this song]

309
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,130
[The refrain that became
more intense stood out]

310
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,610
[They showed another beauty of hip-hop
which is their musical background]

311
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:04,350
[It has an exciting mood
as if having fun at a club]

312
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:06,560
It was a perfect meeting
of music and appearances.

313
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,780
[Rhythmical sounds stand out in this song
based on 1980s new wave and disco]

314
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,050
[T.O.P's uniquely serious rap goes
well with the rhythmical sounds]

315
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:10,820
[And GD completes it by giving it
a sweet mood with his singing]

316
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:15,540
[The tracks in the album are linked like a story,
and this song also tells a story through the lyrics]

317
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,940
This is another side to the
charismatic GD and T.O.P.

318
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:52,630
The kissing scene was the hardest
because I already did it twice.

319
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:56,140
T.O.P Joo Won loves G Ra-im.

320
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:02,290
I'm having an identity crisis
since I did it twice now.

321
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:06,860
Don't worry, but you two
look great together.

322
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,540
My name is Kwon Ji-yong...

323
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:15,040
The one who was with GD
the longest is Taeyang.

324
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:25,370

488

Where do you get those experiences?
We wonder if you actually dated.

489
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:07,970

- Really?

492
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,020
We're asking you.

493
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,560

will make time for it.

You wrote, "My name is
Hammered Dragon."

497
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:30,490
It was a friend's birthday and we went
to a bowling alley in Gangnam.

498
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:34,800
We had some beer as we bowled.

499
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:39,320
There were some strong drinks
since it was a birthday.

500
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:45,050
I started drinking but
drank too much.

501
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:50,030
All I remember was coming
home after having fun.

502
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,680
But my friend called
the next day.

503
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:56,600
- "Why did you do that?"
- What did I do?

504
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,080
"Try to remember!
You're in trouble!"

505
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:05,090
I was excited after a few drinks,
and there were a lot of people.

506
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:08,460
- He said I started dancing.
- At the bowling alley?

507

[Hammered Dragon]

508
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:14,320
I was dancing like this
because I was excited.

509
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,740
I started to go somewhere.

510
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,870
I was waving happily
to a group of women.

511
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:27,820
I drank the beverages there
and started dancing with them.

512
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:32,830
My friend was surprised to see them
and took me away from them.

513
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:36,070
In front of SNSD...

514
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:40,820
I danced.

515
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:44,680
Are you close with them?

516
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,350
I'm not close.

517
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:50,920
When I meet them at the station,
since I'm one year their senior...

518
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:57,660
I have to maintain my image.
So every time they greet me...

519
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,510
[Uh, hi]

520
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:02,670
- I always did that.
- An air of mystery.

521
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:06,880
Yes, I maintained that but
since I was drunk that day...

522
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:13,470
I think Yoona, Tiffany, Sooyoung,
and Hyoyeon were there.

523
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:16,010
They don't know why but
I started dancing.

524
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:22,430
After some time, I attended an
awards ceremony with them in Japan.

525
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:26,610
But their looks towards me...

526

[The shameful senior who
danced at the bowling alley]

527
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:33,660
They were doing that and
I was really embarrassed.

528
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:39,050
To clear up their misunderstanding, I said,
"I'm not such a person. I was drunk."

529
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:43,240
- He wasn't G-Dragon but Hammered Dragon.
- Three sheets in the wind.

530
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,060
You don't remember at all?

531
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:52,530
When people act unpredictably while drunk,
they do things they always had in mind.

532
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:57,660
So G-Dragon always wanted
to dance before SNSD.

533
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,470
Why did you do that?

534
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,760
So he expressed it
with his body?

535
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,950
If that came out, it must
mean it was on his mind.

536

Who was there?

537

The G-Dragon I know is clear-headed
no matter how drunk he is.

543
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:45,140
He's our team's leader so he always
thinks that he has to be clear-headed.

544
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:49,120
Maybe he wanted to
show off his charms.

545

[He has no way out!]

546
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:53,470

he speaks of with confidence.

king of fashion in gayo.

553

This man has no equal but
has a self-claimed rival.

asks if I'm watching...

I refuse his comparison.

I might look plain in this gray suit
so this color is the key to the look.

are into fashion are his fan.

Everyone recognizes G-Dragon
as a fashion leader.

570

Not only on stage, but whatever
he wears becomes an issue.

571

Even the boldness to wear a dress
made him a fashion icon.

572
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:54,710
Some time ago, he was pointed out
by Jung Hyung-don and humiliated.

It seems like he's joking but
he wrote many hit songs.

653
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:47,880
I'm over 40 but he
makes more than me!

654
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:02,000
I was able to do that with
help from many people.

655
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,320
He could be particular but...

656
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:08,490
I didn't say anything yet.

657
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:09,880
Of course, I envy him.

658
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:20,500
I don't know but I think
it's over a 100.

659
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:26,170
If it's a 100 songs, then
each month it's...

660
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:29,850
What are you calculating?

661
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:32,470
You succeeded at a young age.

662
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:34,180
[A capable guy!]

663
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:38,570
Where does that talent
come from?

664
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:43,240
I think it became a habit.
When we used to be trainees...

665
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:51,980
YG gave us an assignment of
writing a new song every week.

666
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:58,080
I started doing that and then
one became two then three...

667
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:03,020
His remarkable senses can also
be applied to the BIGBANG members.

668
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:07,860
It looks like you two are
goofing off in the waiting room.

669
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:10,780
It says here, "With Seungri.
Tom and Jerry."

670
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:16,900
Our fans call us
Tom and Jerry.

671
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:22,140
What song are the
members good at?

672
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:23,010
For each one?

673
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,510
Is it teuroteu for Daesung?

674
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:29,730
He sings teuroteu well
but he has a nice voice...

675
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:32,520
Korean classical music.

676
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,750
That's right!

677
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:42,160
His voice is open and
good at doing that.

678
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:49,080
Taeyang is... what do you
call that? Is it CCM?

679
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:55,540
When I go to church with him,
he looks cool when singing hymns.

680
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:58,180
I think he'll be serious.

681
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:01,080
He sings like he's on stage.

682
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:05,260
- Church hymns?
- Yes, in church.

683
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:08,100
So people next to him
look only at him.

684
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,670
They tell him he was cool
after church.

685
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:18,210
It must be fun. How would
he sing something like this?

686
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:22,800
Something like that.

687
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,730
[What about himself?]

688
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:31,220
- Children's songs.
- Really?

689
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,910
- What kind?
- My voice is thin...

690
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:35,570
My voice is like a child's.

691
01:22:35,570 --> 01:22:37,960
You want him to sing?

692
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,370
[The best rapper singing
children's songs?]

693
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:45,270
You have to sing
with confidence.

694
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:47,210
Yes, and also clearly.

695
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,080
Like this.

696
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,890
"Look at Me, Gwisoon."

697
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,380
- That's right.
- Isn't that teuroteu?

698
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:01,340
Yes, it is.

699
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,990
Why only for Daesung?

700
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:12,320
He enjoys singing it
and sings it well.

701
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,780
I love it.

702
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,060
It seemed like a
loss not to.

703
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,560
Haven't you thought
of T.O.P doing it?

704
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:22,540
I wrote the song with Daesung
for the first time.

705
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:26,390
Many things happened last year
and as I talked with him...

706
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:29,880
There was something that
really hurt my heart.

707
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:37,460
He can get absorbed and sing
a really sad or happy song.

708
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:44,470
But when we sing a
medium tempo or an R&B...

709
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:52,090
He feels sorry and isn't confident
to sing while looking at his fans.

710
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:58,540
I don't know how to put this but
it made me sad when I heard that.

711
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:10,400
Since I like Daesung's voice and
he's good at hitting the high notes.

712
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:16,010
We worked to make that stand out
and that became his solo song.

713
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:20,630
I never knew how
awesome his voice was.

714
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:22,640
He memorized it while
writing the words.

715
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,550
Did he also...

716
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:31,390
Not only does he add their colors
to the song, he's also kindhearted.

717
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:36,500
He displayed his talents once more.

718
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:40,000
Everyone waited for this day.
It's GD's second album.

719
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:46,040
Not only did he write the words and music
but also produced creating this album.

720
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:52,030
[First world tour finale
Preparing for the Seoul concert]

721
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:56,660
His music doesn't disappoint.
