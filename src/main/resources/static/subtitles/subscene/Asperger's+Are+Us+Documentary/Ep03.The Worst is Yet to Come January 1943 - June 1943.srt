10
00:00:57,247 --> 00:01:02,037
and Tom, just 16
and still too young to go.

00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:09,087
But the middle son, Corado,
was 19 and single,

13

CHARLES MANN: It was good,
I guess, that you were afraid,

179

what your real thinking was

180

The commander
of the American troops there

200
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:25,847
was a visible coward.

communicate better from there.

205
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:42,047

222
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:42,407
The Americans simply didn't
know how to fight,

a British commander said,

224
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:47,167

Rommel pulled back
through the Kasserine Pass.

Eisenhower replaced
his inept commander

260

with a major general
named George S. Patton,

American workers would soon be
able to build ships and planes

00:27:44,047 --> 00:27:48,359
faster than the enemy could sink
them or shoot them down.

392

the status quo.

get up and leave the bed,

417
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:48,607
go to work and another man

once they'd gotten out
of high school,

423
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:11,887
but Emma Belle, like her father,
loved to take things apart.

424
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:16,447
PETCHER: I always fixed my own
appliances at home, growing up.

425
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:18,447
If the washing machine got
a nail in the pump

426
00:32:18,447 --> 00:32:20,647
I took the pump apart
and took the nail out

427
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,847
of the housing of the pump
and, you know, run...

428
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:25,647
I didn't have the patience to
call in a repairman

429
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:28,967
who would be, maybe three days
later and he wouldn't tell you

430
00:32:28,967 --> 00:32:31,527
morning or evening, so I'd empty
the washing machine,

431
00:32:31,527 --> 00:32:33,607
turn it upside down,
take the screwdrivers

432
00:32:33,607 --> 00:32:36,247

and went to Mobile.

436
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:58,367
So they put me in a school to
learn airplane accessories -

437
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,887
that was starters, generators,

438
00:33:00,887 --> 00:33:05,007
alternators
and some other thing.

439
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:10,287

just those little instruments,

00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:19,247
I was to inspect the torque
in the screws in the wings,

455
00:34:19,247 --> 00:34:20,807
and go into the gas tanks,

456
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:24,927
and crawl up in the wings

00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:31,287
to be in the Santo Tomas
internment camp in Manila,

517
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:34,006
but it could provide
no further information.

518
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:40,767
GIRL: "On February 15, 1943,

519
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:42,927
"a few days
after my 10th birthday,

520
00:38:42,927 --> 00:38:46,327

525
00:39:05,487 --> 00:39:10,647
NARRATOR: For almost 14 months
after Manila fell to the Japanese,

526
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:15,167
Sascha Weinzheimer, her mother,
her sister, Doris,

527
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:17,487
and her younger brother, Buddy,
had managed

528
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:20,127
to stay out of the camp
the Japanese had established

529
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:23,967
for foreign civilians on the
campus of Santo Tomas University

530
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:26,487
on the city's outskirts.

531
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:29,647
But after Sascha reported
having seen

532
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:33,647
Japanese soldiers drowning
a small Filipino boy,

533
00:39:33,647 --> 00:39:36,287
her mother decided
they would be safer

534
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:39,167
in the prison than outside it.

535
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:43,247
Their father had been imprisoned
there for more than a year -

536
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:48,967
so long that his young son
no longer recognised him.

537
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:54,767
There were now some 4,000
prisoners at Santo Tomas -

538
00:39:54,767 --> 00:40:01,567
American and British, Dutch and
Norwegian, Polish and French.

539
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,487
Immediately, the Japanese

540
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:05,807
didn't want to have anything
to do with us.

541
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:07,287
They weren't going to feed us.

542
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:09,767
They weren't going to follow
the Geneva Convention rules.

543
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:13,919
So you were left
to fend for yourself.

Filipino friends
of the internees

546
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:26,046
passed canned foods and fresh
vegetables through the fence.

547
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:30,847
Families were permitted to build
themselves bamboo shanties

548
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:35,047
with palm leaves for roofs
in which to spend the day.

549
00:40:35,047 --> 00:40:38,567
At night, they were herded into
crowded dormitories

550
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:40,887
in the main building.

551
00:40:40,887 --> 00:40:45,727
Everyone was assigned a job.

552

GIRL: "It was funny to see
bank presidents

553
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:50,047

"and goldbricks who didn't
do anything at all."

560
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:17,487
NARRATOR: The prisoners organised
churches, schools, police,

561
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:19,407
even a 'morality patrol',

562
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:22,887
meant to keep teenagers from
disappearing together

563
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:26,287
into dark corners.

564
00:41:26,287 --> 00:41:29,887
Your world becomes very small.

565
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:34,727
And you don't think beyond your
little environment,

566
00:41:34,727 --> 00:41:39,287
because everything that's
important to you is right there.

567
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:42,127
It's not in the States.

568
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,687
It's not back at the plantation.

569
00:41:44,687 --> 00:41:46,807
It's right there.

570
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:53,155

590

NARRATOR: Glenn Frazier had
endured the Bataán Death March

591
00:43:13,527 --> 00:43:15,007
and weeks of imprisonment

592
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:16,927
at Camp O'Donnell
in the Philippines,

593
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:20,287
where survival had seemed
so unlikely,

594
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:25,287
he had thrown one of his dog
tags into a mass grave

595
00:43:25,287 --> 00:43:28,767
that held the bodies of many
of his fellow prisoners.

596
00:43:28,767 --> 00:43:33,287
That way, he thought,
if they were ever recovered

597
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:36,927
his family back in Alabama
would find some comfort

598

what had happened to him.

As the marines had struggled
to take Guadalcanal,

600
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:47,327
Frazier was shipped
all the way to Japan,

601
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:51,161
to a prisoner of war camp
near Osaka.

602
00:43:53,687 --> 00:43:55,967
FRAZIER: The number
that the Japanese gave us

603
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,480
was like a serial number.

604
00:43:59,647 --> 00:44:01,647
And mine was 6-32.

605
00:44:01,647 --> 00:44:05,967
Roko naka san juni,
is the number in Japanese.

606
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:08,967
And they put it on your clothes.
You had a little button saying,

607
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:10,967
uh, 6-32.

608
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:13,047
And it was, uh,
it was part of your records,

609
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:19,077
and I kept that number all the
way through my days in Japan.

610
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:23,087
NARRATOR: The commandant told
Frazier and his fellow prisoners

611
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:27,887
they would be treated well,
as "guests of the Emperor".

612
00:44:27,887 --> 00:44:30,127
They were not.

613
00:44:30,127 --> 00:44:34,287
What little food they had
was rotten.

614
00:44:34,287 --> 00:44:36,807
Barracks were unheated.

615
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:40,807
The prisoners were divided
into 10-man shooting squads.

616
00:44:40,807 --> 00:44:44,167
If one member tried to escape,

617
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:47,637
he and all the others
would be shot.

618
00:44:49,607 --> 00:44:53,887
Frazier developed double
pneumonia and nearly died.

619
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:58,887
All the prisoners were made
to work in Japanese foundries

620
00:44:58,887 --> 00:45:03,007
or on the docks,
loading and unloading ships.

621
00:45:03,007 --> 00:45:05,807
Small children jeered and cursed

622
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:07,887
as they walked to
and from the docks,

623
00:45:07,887 --> 00:45:09,767
calling them cowards

624
00:45:09,767 --> 00:45:15,364
for having surrendered,
rather than fight to the death.

625
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:26,247
Guards beat the prisoners
regularly,

626
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:29,796
and the smallest infraction
of rules could prove fatal.

627
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:36,447
One day I was walking, coming
back from a detail that day

628
00:45:36,447 --> 00:45:37,927
on the streets of Osaka.

629
00:45:37,927 --> 00:45:40,927
And the weather was cold.

630
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:43,367
And I put my hands
in my pocket,

631
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:45,437
and I'm walking along with
everybody else.

632
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:50,287
When we got to the camp
and they checked us in,

633
00:45:50,287 --> 00:45:53,487
this guard pointed me out
and called me out.

634
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:57,487
And, uh, said, "Why did you have
your hands in your pocket?"

635
00:45:57,487 --> 00:46:00,887
I said, "Because I was cold."

636
00:46:00,887 --> 00:46:03,647
So they took me in the
commander's office

637
00:46:03,647 --> 00:46:05,567
and the interpreter says,

638
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:09,887
"That's against
the military code.

639
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:14,167
"Soldiers do not walk
with hands in pockets."

640
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:18,887
And I said, "Well, I'm not a
soldier, I'm a prisoner of war."

641
00:46:18,887 --> 00:46:21,687
So the commander banged his fist
on his desk, and -

642
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:24,487
he was a major -
and got up and he says,

643
00:46:24,487 --> 00:46:27,367
uh, the interpreter said,
"He don't like your attitude."

644
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:32,447
So, he come up and he started
arguing with me,

645
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,487
and I couldn't... I couldn't
understand anything he said.

646
00:46:35,487 --> 00:46:37,487
So he pulled his sabre out

647
00:46:37,487 --> 00:46:40,487
and he said he was going to
"make an example of you,

648
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:43,727
"so that the other men will
understand

649
00:46:43,727 --> 00:46:46,002
"they have to obey orders".

650
00:46:49,127 --> 00:46:51,687
So he puts his sword
to my throat, here,

651
00:46:51,687 --> 00:46:53,167
and nicked me a little bit,

652
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:55,607
and I could feel a little bit of
blood coming down.

653
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:59,327
So, he, the interpreter said,
"He's going to execute you."

654
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:04,007
So he asked me if I had
any last words to say.

655
00:47:04,007 --> 00:47:08,407
And I looked him straight in the
eye and I said, "He can kill me,

656
00:47:08,407 --> 00:47:10,407
"but he cannot kill my spirit.

657
00:47:10,407 --> 00:47:12,967
"And my spirit's going
to lodge in his body

658
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:16,164
"and haunt him
until the day he dies."

659
00:47:21,887 --> 00:47:25,007
And he had a frown
come over his face

660
00:47:25,007 --> 00:47:27,487
and took three steps backward
and lowered his sword

661
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:29,487
and ordered me to be put

662
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:32,967
in a five-by-five-by-five
cubicle in the ground.

663
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:38,247
I had never seen
a Japanese back down

664
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:40,687
in front of any of his
subordinates

665
00:47:40,687 --> 00:47:43,367
until that particular time.

666
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:45,487
Because once they
got to that point,

667
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:50,925
they went through with it,
regardless of the results.

685
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:12,767
"he went around the back,
unnoticed.

686
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:16,840
"Probably he just wanted
to feast his eyes on home.

687
00:49:21,807 --> 00:49:24,807
"His children were watching
at the front,

688
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:28,487
"their noses almost boring holes
in the window panes,

689
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:31,559
"as they watched
for a sign of Daddy.

690
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:37,567
"Nobody needs to describe
their shrieks of joy

691
00:49:37,567 --> 00:49:41,847
"when he walked in from
the back door to surprise them.

692
00:49:41,847 --> 00:49:45,167
"If you could
have seen them later,

693
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:47,687
"hanging on to his hands
for dear life

694
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:50,007
"as though they could hold him
home forever,

695
00:49:50,007 --> 00:49:54,842
"you couldn't have helped getting
a bit misty yourself."

696

Al Mclntosh,
'Rock County Star Herald'.

697
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:03,927
JIM SHERMAN: I think,
particularly in Luverne,

698
00:50:03,927 --> 00:50:10,167
there was this general feeling
of we're in the right,

699
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:12,847
we're doing the right thing,

700
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:17,567
and all of the things
that we're doing, collectively,

701
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:21,640
sort of brought a lot of people
together.

702
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:25,967
It was in a totally
different feeling

703
00:50:25,967 --> 00:50:28,967
that I don't think can ever
be duplicated, ever.

704
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:34,167
I just don't think that you
could have that sense of oneness

705
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:36,761
that, that we had
when we were growing up.

706
00:50:39,127 --> 00:50:43,487
NARRATOR: At home and overseas
Americans were slowly,

707
00:50:43,487 --> 00:50:46,718
sometimes painfully,
learning to work together.

708
00:50:48,367 --> 00:50:53,367
But President Roosevelt warned
the country in the summer of 1943

709
00:50:53,367 --> 00:50:57,887
"it's not too much to say
that we must pour into this war

710
00:50:57,887 --> 00:51:03,487
"the entire strength and intelligence
and willpower of the United States"

711
00:51:03,487 --> 00:51:05,557
before victory could be won.
