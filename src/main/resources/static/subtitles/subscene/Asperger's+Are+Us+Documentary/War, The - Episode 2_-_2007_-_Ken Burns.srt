4
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:40,472
            NARRATOR:           
   Early in 1943, an envelope   
 from the War Department arrived

5
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:45,143
    at 1032 North Main Street   
   in Waterbury, Connecticut,   

6
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:48,380
 the home of the Ciarlo family. 

7
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,848
    They knew it was coming.    

8
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,718
      There were three boys     
         in the family.         

9
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:56,054
 Two were exempt from the draft:

10
00:00:56,155 --> 00:01:00,491
   Dom, married with one child  
     and another on the way;    

11
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:06,931
        and Tom, just 16        
   and still too young to go.   

12
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:12,170
   But the middle son, Corado,  
       was 19 and single,       

13
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,205
working at Waterbury Steel Ball,

14
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:17,508
       a perfect candidate      
          for the army.         

15
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,614
     His family and friends     
       called him "Babe."       

16
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:25,349
          OLGA CIARLO:          
    And he was the one to go.   

17
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:28,019
     Course, it was a shock     
          to all of us,         

18
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,888
  and my mother cried forever.  

19
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,525
            Forever.            

20
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,094
 But that's the way the war was.

21
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,230
   So... it was a tough time.   

22
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:43,735
       And not only that,       
  but my father had passed away 

23
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:46,104
          in, uh, 1937.         

24
00:01:46,205 --> 00:01:49,507
          My mother was         
     very, very heartbroken     

25
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:52,943
      at that time already.     

26
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:55,146
  My mother would take the bus  

27
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,282
    and go up to the cemetery   
         all by herself.        

28
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:00,919
       She couldn't speak       
       a word of English.       

29
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:09,093
 And all she could tell the man 
   on the bus was, "Cemetery."  

30
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:17,268
And then to know that my brother
      was going off to war,     

31
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:21,673
  She didn't want to go through 
   this all over again, so...   

32
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:26,444
       It was hard times,       
        very hard times.        

33

       Here's number six,       

36
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:47,899
    a song by Frank Sinatra.    

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,135
       Let's get lost...

          "May 9, 1943.

00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,141

        five or six hours       

47
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:24,035
   for the call to go through,

59
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:07,445
            NARRATOR:           
       By January of 1943,      

60
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:11,983
    Americans had been at war   
      for more than a year.     

61
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:15,219
      The Navy had stopped      
      the Japanese advance      

62
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,055
    at the Battle of Midway.    

63
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,993
           The Marines          
      had taken Guadalcanal     

64
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:24,528
     in the Solomon Islands,    

65
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:26,630
          and American          
      and Australian forces     

66
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:29,267
    had defeated the Japanese   
             at Buna            

67
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:32,770
          on the island         
      of Papua New Guinea.      

68
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:39,377
    But the 4,000-mile march    
toward the Japanese home islands

69
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:41,279
       was just beginning.      

70
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,881
   And thousands of Americans   

71
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,850
    were still held prisoner    
        by the Japanese,        

72
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,786
     including nine-year-old    
       Sascha Weinzheimer,      

73
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,923
        whose family came       
   from the Sacramento Valley;  

74
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:59,831
   and Corporal Glenn Frazier,  
   from Ft. Deposit, Alabama.   

75
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,600
           Meanwhile,           
 in the snows around Stalingrad,

76
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:07,872
 Hitler's dream of expanding his
  empire eastward across Russia 

77
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,506
    was ending in catastrophe   

78
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:13,545
   as the Red Army annihilated  
     his surrounded armies.     

79
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:18,282
         (artillery fire        
     and automatic gunfire)     

80
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:28,926
        But the Germans,        
  with their vast war machine,  

81
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:30,795
         still occupied         
     most of Western Europe,    

82
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:36,000
   and the Allies had not yet   
  been able to agree on a plan  

83
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:40,705
or a timetable to dislodge them.

84
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:44,108
       For the time being,      
  they would have to be content 

85
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:48,646
       to nip at the edges      
  of Hitler's enormous domain.  

86
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:52,350
 American troops were now ashore
        in North Africa,        

87
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:55,019
    ready to test themselves    
       for the first time       

88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,156
       against the German       
       and Italian armies.      

89
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,361
      And American airmen,      

90
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:06,998
      including Earl Burke      
   of Sacramento, California,   

91
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:08,800
  would defy preposterous odds  

92
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:15,440
   and begin to bring the war   
 to the heart of Germany itself.

93
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:35,259
         For the people         
       of Mobile, Alabama,      

94
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,462
       Luverne, Minnesota,      

95
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:39,997
     Sacramento, California,    

96
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,133
     Waterbury, Connecticut,    

97
00:06:42,234 --> 00:06:44,468
and every other town in America,

98
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,539
      the war would dictate     
   the rhythm and pace of life  

99
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,611
   in ways they could not have  
     imagined a year before.    

100
00:06:53,712 --> 00:06:55,880
          And the sense         
       of national purpose      

101
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:59,650
  Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal 
    had brought to the battle   

102
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:01,085
  against the Great Depression  

103
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:06,157
      was now fully focused     
      on winning<i> this</i> war.      

104
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:20,404
      PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT:      
        I do not prophesy       

105
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:23,207
     when this war will end.    

106
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:29,247
        But I do believe        
    that this year of 1943...   

107
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:35,552
 will give to the United Nations
   a very substantial advance   

108
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:39,624
         along the roads        
       that lead to Berlin      

109
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,360
       and Rome and Tokyo.      

110
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,095
           (applause)           

111
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:48,466
      A tremendous, costly,     
       long enduring task,      

112
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:52,770
   in peace as well as in war,  

113
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,173
      is still ahead of us.     

114
00:07:55,274 --> 00:08:00,077
         But as we face         
      that continuing task,     

115
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:05,082
   we may know that the state   
     of this nation is good,    

116
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:07,952
    the heart of this nation    
            is sound,           

117
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:12,089
    the spirit of this nation   
           is strong,           

118
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,728
    the faith of this nation    
           is eternal.          

119
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:20,431
           (applause)           

120
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:23,034
        (applause fading)       

121
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,371
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
        Roosevelt carried       

122
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:31,342
         a real message         
  of confidence with his voice. 

123
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:34,278
  He gave us all the confidence 

124
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:37,448
        that we could do        
   anything he asked us to do,  

125
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,387
 and certainly the boys could do
  anything he asked them to do. 

126
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:46,324
     And he was the powerful    
         driving force.         

127
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:49,494
  Now, England had Churchill... 

128
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:53,264
    ...but we had Roosevelt.    

129
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:58,035
       And, from the time       
    he announced Pearl Harbor   

130
00:08:58,136 --> 00:09:01,972
          and announced         
    that we would go to war,    

131
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:05,943
     we were all behind him.    

132
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,960
  (Benny Goodman's band playing

133

   The lucky thing was that...

  the American army didn't get  
    its first taste of battle   

135
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:55,158
  going across the channel, the 
  way some people wanted us to. 

136
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,430
 They had to go through that... 
    that North African thing,   

137
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:07,205
 which was a learning experience
    and a very expensive one.   

138
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,041
Our army got to be goddamn good,

139
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:14,478
      but at the beginning      
  they were like anybody else-- 

140
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:17,682
  they weren't too good at it.  

141
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,483
           (song ends)          

142
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:20,884
         (fanfare plays)        

143
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:26,290
            NARRATOR:           
     At an Allied conference    
 in Casablanca in January 1943, 

144
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:29,861
      everything went well      
        for the cameras,        

145
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,262
     and President Roosevelt    

146
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,697
   and British Prime Minister   
        Winston Churchill       

147
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:35,299
   announced they would accept  
          nothing less          

148
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,602
  than unconditional surrender  
         from the enemy.        

149
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:41,138
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
   ...unconditional surrender.  

150
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:45,909
            NARRATOR:           
     But behind the scenes,     
    both men were concerned.    

151
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,647
  The Allies were still trying  
 to find ways to work together. 

152
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:53,183
    (distant artillery fire)    
     The previous November,     

153
00:10:53,284 --> 00:10:55,886
          Allied troops         
 under General Dwight Eisenhower

154
00:10:55,987 --> 00:11:00,358
  had made coordinated landings 
     in Morocco and Algeria     

155
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,660
without meeting much resistance.

156
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:08,732
   But Hitler strengthened his  
 forces in neighboring Tunisia. 

157
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,969
       Eisenhower's troops      
     were meant to race east    

158
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,371
      to engage the enemy,      

159
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,039
      while British General     
       Bernard Montgomery       

160
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:20,444
     pursued German General     
   Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps  

161
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:22,747
      westward from Egypt.      

162
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:28,119
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
       Tunisia, next-door       
        to Italian Libya,       

163
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,087
is at the rear of the Axis army.

164
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:32,924
     It's the next objective    
      for the American half     

165
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,793
   of the nutcracker campaign,  
      closing in on Rommel      

166
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:38,596
  from the west as the British  
      smash from the east.      

167
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:43,734
  The aim is to chase the Axis  
      out of North Africa,      

168
00:11:43,768 --> 00:11:46,036
    and other Nazi-dominated    
     territories in Europe,     

169
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:49,040
  and open shorter supply lines 
           to Russia.           

170
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:54,979
       That's the meaning       
 of the American drive to Tunis.

171
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,382
        (wind whistling)        

172
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:01,219
            NARRATOR:           
        After two months        
      of sporadic fighting,     

173
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,689
   the battle for North Africa  
      suddenly intensified.     

174
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,192
        (artillery fire)        

175
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,697
   (men shouting, explosions)   

176
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:26,676
   On February 14, Rommel sent  
      his seasoned veterans     

177
00:12:26,778 --> 00:12:32,082
  against the untested, poorly  
led, and ill-equipped Americans.

178
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:35,386
       His goal, he said,       
     was to instill in them     

179
00:12:35,486 --> 00:12:40,757
     "an inferiority complex    
       of no mean order."       

180
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:42,459
         And for a time,        

181
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,695
          he succeeded.         

182
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:20,731
     (explosions and gunfire    
         become distant)        

183
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:25,836
    With the American forces    
    was Private Charles Mann,   

184
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:30,007
         a farmer's son         
    from Luverne, Minnesota.    

185
00:13:30,108 --> 00:13:34,245
          CHARLES MANN:         
      It was good, I guess,     
      that you were afraid,     

186
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:39,116
  but it did not interfere with 
   what your real thinking was  

187
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:41,485
    because you had one idea    

188
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:44,822
      and that was that you     
       was gonna make it.       

189
00:13:59,737 --> 00:14:02,906
            NARRATOR:           
     Rommel's forces quickly    
    overwhelmed the Americans   

190
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:08,112
   whose armor proved no match  
       for German panzers.      

191
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:12,917
      Some soldiers called      
   the Allied tanks "Ronsons,"  

192
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:19,356
  for their propensity to burst 
 instantly into flame when hit. 

193
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:37,174
         (heart beating)        

194
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:48,085
   Stuka dive-bombers screamed  
    down upon the Americans.    

195
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:54,691
         Some men held,         
        others panicked.        

196
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,730
     Survivors fled westward    
     across the open plain.     

197
00:14:59,831 --> 00:15:04,969
       They would not stop      
          for 50 miles.         

198
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,806
           CHAMBERLIN:          
 They didn't know what the hell 
        they were doing.        

199
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,107
         Guys never been        
       under fire before,       

200
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:14,778
   and, uh, when they got hit,  
  they didn't know what to do,  

201
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,414
       and they retreated,      

202
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:20,484
      and they had terrible     
           leadership.          

203
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:21,785
          It was chaos.         

204
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:22,819
     And war's always chaos.    

205
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,188
          The commander         
  of the American troops there  

206
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:28,258
      was a visible coward.     

207
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,528
     He built a... a, uh...     

208
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,265
    headquarters for himself    
        in a rock chamber       

209
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,268
       some 20 miles back       
          from the line         

210
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:42,039
 with the argument that he could
 communicate better from there. 

211
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,808
      So, he was appalling.     

212
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:48,379
            NARRATOR:           
       After beating back       
  two American counterattacks,  

213
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,583
   the Germans poured westward  
   through the Kasserine Pass,  

214
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:54,050
       gateway to Algeria,      

215
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:59,923
  threatening the Allies' main  
     supply base at Tebessa.    

216
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:14,538
        (artillery fire)        

217
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,674
   (explosions, men shouting)   

218
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:20,778
       (automatic gunfire)      

219
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:43,533
         (men shouting)         

220
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:12,763
    In two weeks of fighting,   
   6,000 Americans were lost.   

221
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:16,366
45 soldiers from the little town
        of Red Oak, Iowa,       

222
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:21,037
           were killed          
      or reported missing.      

223
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:23,173
   A third of those who lived   

224
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:26,543
          were victims          
  of neuropsychiatric disorders 

225
00:17:26,644 --> 00:17:29,312
     brought on by the first    
      experience of battle      

226
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:33,383
   for which they were totally  
           unprepared.          

227
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:37,821
       2,400 surrendered.       

228
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:44,762
   The Americans simply didn't  
       know how to fight,       

229
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,496
    a British commander said,   

230
00:17:46,597 --> 00:17:49,232
       and if they didn't       
         learn quickly,         

231
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,869
    they "will play no useful   
        part whatsoever"        

232
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,371
   in the invasion of Europe.   

233
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,206
   General Eisenhower agreed.   

234
00:17:56,307 --> 00:18:01,879
    "Our operations to date,"   
 he confided grimly to a friend,

235
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,546
       "will be condemned       
        in their entirety       

236
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:08,819
   by all War College classes   
     for the next 25 years."    

237
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,423
  The correspondent Ernie Pyle  
       was with the troops      

238
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:19,497
   and struggled to make sense  
       of what he'd seen.       

239
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,831
       PYLE (dramatized):       
       "You folks at home       
      must be disappointed      

240
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,403
     at what happened to our    
  American troops in Tunisia."  

241
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:33,810
  "Personally, I feel that some 
     such setback as this--     

242
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:36,646
      "tragic though it is      
       for many Americans,      

243
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:39,483
 "for whom it is now too late-- 

244
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:44,754
         is not entirely        
      a bad thing for us."      

245
00:18:44,855 --> 00:18:48,192
     "It's all right to have    
   a good opinion of yourself,  

246
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,663
        "but we Americans       
 are so smug with our cockiness.

247
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:56,433
   "We somehow feel that just   
     because we're Americans    

248
00:18:56,534 --> 00:19:01,037
     we can whip our weight     
          in wildcats."         

249
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:09,212
            FUSSELL:            
  But I think every ground war  
      has to begin that way     

250
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:13,316
 because what's going to happen 
  to people is so unthinkable.  

251
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,786
 So it's only after you've been 
      in it a little while      

252
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,621
       that you're capable      
        of understanding        

253
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:20,290
      what's happening well     
    enough to do well at it.    

254
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:22,859
 And you have to do well at it. 

255
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,437
            NARRATOR:           
      The Americans pulled      
      themselves together.      

256
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:38,208
      Air strikes staggered     
       the German advance.      

257
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,990
       American artillery       

258
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:57,695
       moved in to hammer       
       German tank columns      

259
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:00,263
      with howitzer shells.     

260
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:21,151
    The enemy was running out   
 of ammunition, food, gasoline, 

261
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:22,652

       were well-supplied       

262
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:28,359
   with everything they needed  
        to keep fighting.       

263
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:31,761
    Fearing a counterattack,    

264
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:37,701
       Rommel pulled back       
   through the Kasserine Pass.  

265
00:20:39,737 --> 00:20:43,740
       Eisenhower replaced      
       his inept commander      

266
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:46,643
      with a Major General      
     named George S. Patton,    

267
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:49,913
       who would transform      
  the beleaguered Second Corps

00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:53,717
       into a determined,

      to beat them suckers.     

271
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,425
   That's what it amounted to.  

272
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:07,998
  We'd done so poorly towards,  
      uh, Rommel's forces,      

273
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:12,636
      but next time around      
       we'd done it right.

      the last Axis troops

     learned had come hard:     

283
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:21,738
    76,000 men had been lost,   

284

287
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:34,684

      And so they'd get out     
    and have fights and drink   

389
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:57,560
   and all that kind of stuff.  

390
00:29:57,661 --> 00:29:59,862
            NARRATOR:           
   African-Americans streamed   
           into Mobile          

391
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,199
     from all over the South    
    in search of defense work   

392
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,900
       and a fresh start.       

393
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:07,270
        They found both.        

394
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:11,507
       But they also found      
 the same kind of discrimination

395
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,510
     they had known at home.    

396
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:18,882
           JOHN GRAY:           
           Mobile was           
   a pretty fair-minded city.   

397
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:24,253
And before this time, whites and
  blacks got along pretty good  

398
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,356
       as long as you had       
         the status quo.        

399
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:31,194
    Uh, but when blacks began   
          to get homes,         

400
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:34,698
    to buy homes and to ride    
          in big cars,          

401
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,234
 uh, it turned some people off. 

402
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:44,007
  The policemen would stop you  
     and give you a ticket.     

403
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:45,608
     My cousin got a ticket     

404
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:52,115
  for driving 16 miles an hour  
       in a 15-mile zone.       

405
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:56,285
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
    150,000 people, ten full    
      military divisions--      

406
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:59,522
   the civilian equivalent of   
 Rommel's entire African army-- 

407
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:03,125
   bivouacked without warning   
     in the narrow confines     

408
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:05,461
 of one peaceful Southern city. 

409
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:07,763
   Less than three years ago,   
  you might have walked blocks  

410
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:10,734
 in Mobile without encountering 
            a person.           

411
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,069
    Today you stop to scratch   
            your head           

412
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,303
  and a line forms behind you.  

413
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:17,840
 No wonder there's such a chaos 
   and congestion of traffic.   

414
00:31:17,941 --> 00:31:21,811
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
    Mobile became so crowded    

415
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:23,980
          in six months         

416
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:27,617
     that people were living    
         in vacant lots.        

417
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:29,952
        They put up tents       
         in vacant lots.        

418
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:34,224
           People went          
    into the boarding houses,   

419
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:39,595
     and one room would hold    
      as many as four men.      

420
00:31:39,696 --> 00:31:41,664
 (newsreel narration continues) 

421
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,199
        They would sleep        

422
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,634
       for so many hours,       

423
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:46,702
    get up and leave the bed,   

424
00:31:46,803 --> 00:31:50,373
   go to work and another man   
       would take the bed.      

425
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:53,242
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
     This was a neighborhood    
         grocery store.         

426
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,279
 These girls: welders, checkers,
         and machinists.        

427
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:02,985
            NARRATOR:           
 Emma Belle Petcher was from the
  tiny town of Millry, Alabama. 

428
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,489
   Most of her girlfriends had  
     taken secretarial jobs     

429
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,525
     once they'd gotten out     
         of high school,        

430
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:13,629
but Emma Belle, like her father,
   loved to take things apart.  

431
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:18,435
            PETCHER:            
I always fixed my own appliances
      at home, growing up.      

432
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,336
     The washing machine got    
       a nail in the pump.      

433
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,572
      I took the pump apart     
      and took the nail out     

434
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:24,740
   of the housing of the pump   
      and, you know, run...     

435
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:27,376
  I didn't have the patience to 
       call in a repairman      

436
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,846
 who would be, maybe, three days
 later and he wouldn't tell you 

437
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:33,550
morning or evening, so I'd empty
      the washing machine,      

438
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,518
      turn it upside down,      
      take the screwdrivers     

439
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:37,954
    and... because I knew how   
      to do all this stuff.     

440
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:43,526
("Pistol Packin' Mama" by Jimmie
Lunceford & His Orchestra plays)

441
00:32:43,627 --> 00:32:48,264
So, I packed my little cardboard
   suitcase and got on the bus  

442
00:32:48,365 --> 00:32:52,135
       and went to Mobile.      

443
00:32:55,238 --> 00:33:00,677
   So they put me in a school   
 to learn airplane accessories. 

444
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,112
 That was starters, generators, 

445
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:06,849
           alternators          
      and some other thing.     

446
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:12,188
     So we did those parts,     
 just those little instruments, 

447
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:15,191
     over and over and over     
   and over until graduation.   

448
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:17,493
    We had to almost put them   
      together blindfolded.     

449
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:21,397
            NARRATOR:           
     Petcher breezed through    
          all her tests         

450
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:25,101
      and got a job working     
          on airplanes.         

451
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:35,945
   By 1943, six million women   
   had entered the workforce,   

452
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:40,249
  and nearly half of them were  
   working in defense plants.   

453
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:44,587
 <i> LIFE</i> magazine paid tribute to 
the mythical "Rosie the Riveter"

454
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:50,426
  as "neither drudge nor slave, 
but the heroine of a new order."

455
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:56,165
  In Mobile, 2,500 women worked 
      at Alabama Dry Dock,      

456
00:33:56,266 --> 00:34:01,437
   1,200 at Gulf Shipbuilding   
   and 750 at Brookley Field,   

457
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:07,042
 where Emma Belle Petcher worked
    her way up to inspector,    

458
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:09,278
responsible for quality control.

459
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:13,749
            PETCHER:            
 You would be assigned X number 
            of planes           

460
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,751
     to be responsible for.     

461
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:21,591
   I was to inspect the torque  
   in the screws in the wings,  

462
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:22,792
   and go into the gas tanks,   

463
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:26,696
    and crawl up in the wings   
        with flashlights.       

464
00:34:26,797 --> 00:34:31,234
 Well, I was so conscientious, I
 just didn't make the mistakes. 

465
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:35,371
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
   I worked at the government   
         nursery school         

466
00:34:35,472 --> 00:34:36,572
       which was downtown       

467
00:34:36,673 --> 00:34:40,743
    in Christ Church Rectory,   
     and we had the children    

468
00:34:40,844 --> 00:34:46,048
    of the women that worked    
        in the shipyards.       

469
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:51,587
 "Rosie the Riveter" would come 
         bring her child        

470
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:53,923
     in all of her headgear     

471
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:56,492
    and her togs that she did   
         her riveting in        

472
00:34:56,593 --> 00:34:59,695
      and drop her precious     
         little baby off        

473
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:05,601
  and go down and work all day  
      and come back at 5:00     

474
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:09,472
     and pick the child up.     

475
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:16,679
            NARRATOR:           
  So many children flooded into 
 Mobile that its overrun schools

476
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,182
         were pronounced        
     the worst in the nation    

477
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,817
           by the U.S.          
      Office of Education.      

478
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:27,657
 Some native citizens of Mobile 
      were openly scornful      

479
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,394
   A schoolteacher called them  
"the lowest type of poor whites,

480
00:35:31,495 --> 00:35:34,263
     "these workers flocking    
     in from the backwoods.     

481
00:35:34,364 --> 00:35:37,200
 "They prefer to live in shacks 
        and go barefoot.        

482
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,203
  "They let their kids run wild 
         on the streets.        

483
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:46,042
   I only hope we can get rid   
     of them after the war."    

484
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:50,046
            PETCHER:            
     No one did it verbally,    
           or to you,           

485
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:53,616
     but the air of the old     
   aristocratic Mobile people   

486
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:58,621
    were really, you know...    
    had to put up with a lot.   

487
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:03,592
            PHILLIPS:           
        Well, in Mobile,        
    the people that came here   

488
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:08,998
  to work in the shipyards came 
      from the small towns.     

489
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:13,135
 So we considered them rednecks.

490
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:17,440
    And they really weren't;    
 they were very fine Americans. 

491
00:36:17,541 --> 00:36:23,412
    But they were more of our   
   farming type of Southerner.  

492
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:26,682
   But they adjusted quickly.   

493
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:31,587
            PETCHER:            
  But, you know, everybody was  
    thrown into it together.    

494
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:34,957
  Whether they liked it or not. 

495
00:36:35,058 --> 00:36:39,061
      We were all together.

    Just before Pearl Harbor,   

530
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:12,048
 his daughter-in-law had written
       to him from Manila,

       asking if his sons

00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,153

         to California.         

534
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,192
     War seemed very close.     

535
00:39:23,293 --> 00:39:26,262
      The old man told them     
  all to stay where they were.  

536
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:31,167
     The rumors of war were     
      exaggerated, he said.     

537
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:35,604
     Now, filled with guilt,    
   he was frantic to find out   

538
00:39:35,705 --> 00:39:39,742
  what had happened to his two  
    sons and their families.    

539

00:39:49,052 --> 00:39:50,653
           In October,

  the State Department told him

00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:53,789
  the family had been reported  

545

    to be in the Santo Tomas    
   Internment Camp in Manila,   

546

     to stay out of the camp    
  the Japanese had established

  for foreign civilians on the  
campus of Santo Tomas University

559
00:40:50,914 --> 00:40:52,981
    on the city's outskirts.    

560
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,985
    But after Sascha reported   
           having seen          

561
00:40:56,086 --> 00:41:00,155
   Japanese soldiers drowning   
      a small Filipino boy,     

562
00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:02,992
       her mother decided       
       they would be safer      

563
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,294
 in the prison than outside it. 

564
00:41:05,395 --> 00:41:09,465
Their father had been imprisoned
  there for more than a year--  

565
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:15,204
   so long that his young son   
    no longer recognized him.   

566
00:41:15,305 --> 00:41:20,877
    There were now some 4,000   
   prisoners at Santo Tomas--   

567
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:27,950
 American and British, Dutch and
  Norwegian, Polish and French. 

568
00:41:28,051 --> 00:41:30,686
          Immediately,          
    the Japanese didn't want    

569
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:33,455
        to have anything        
         to do with us.         

570
00:41:33,556 --> 00:41:36,091
  They weren't going to follow  
  the Geneva Convention rules.  

571
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:40,863
        So you were left        
      to fend for yourself.

574
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:53,075
  passed canned foods and fresh 
  vegetables through the fence. 

575
00:41:53,176 --> 00:41:57,112
Families were permitted to build
   themselves bamboo shanties   

576
00:41:57,213 --> 00:42:01,216
   with palm leaves for roofs   
   in which to spend the day.   

577
00:42:01,317 --> 00:42:05,354
   At night, they were herded   
    into crowded dormitories    

578
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:07,590
      in the main building.     

579
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:11,860
  Everyone was assigned a job.

    even a "morality patrol,"   

590

     meant to keep teenagers    
   from disappearing together

       into dark corners.       

592

 Your world becomes very small. 

593

   And you don't think beyond   
    your little environment,    

594

    because everything that's   
important to you is right there.

        It's right there.

        ROBERT KASHIWAGI:       
    As far as I'm concerned,    
        I was born here.        

607
00:44:05,508 --> 00:44:07,643
          And according         
       to the Constitution      

608
00:44:07,744 --> 00:44:11,313
    that I studied in school,   
  that I had the Bill of Rights 

609
00:44:11,414 --> 00:44:13,014
    that should, should have    
          backed me up.         

610
00:44:13,115 --> 00:44:16,785
 And until the very minute I got

611
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,255
   onto the evacuation train,   

612
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:22,591
      I says, "It can't be.     

613
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:26,028
      How can they do that

            NARRATOR:           
      Robert Kashiwagi was      
       the 23-year-old son      

616
00:44:32,235 --> 00:44:36,105
     of an immigrant farmer,    
    but he spoke no Japanese,   

617
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,041
          knew no other         
    Japanese-American family,   

618
00:44:39,142 --> 00:44:42,311
     and had grown up in the    
     California countryside,    

619
00:44:42,412 --> 00:44:45,514
    15 miles from Sacramento.   

620
00:44:45,615 --> 00:44:48,584
   He had been in a sanitarium  

621
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:50,619
        being treated for       
        a lung condition        

622
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,758
         when Executive         
  Order 9066 went into effect.  

623
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,561
           KASHIWAGI:           
  Then my doctor approached me  
            and says,           

624
00:44:59,662 --> 00:45:01,763
   "I don't know what to do,"   
            he says.            

625
00:45:01,864 --> 00:45:04,800
       "You're bedridden,       
   but I can't keep you here.   

626
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,636
    The law won't allow me."    

627
00:45:07,737 --> 00:45:12,607
    And I said, "Well, okay,    
  I'll make it easier for you.  

628
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:16,378
       and I'll go to camp      
  with my family," which I did. 

629
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,383
       And I couldn't help      
        the family pack.        

630
00:45:21,484 --> 00:45:25,788
All I could do was just go along
       as excess baggage.

            NARRATOR:           
 All 110,000 Japanese-Americans 
       from the West Coast      

632
00:45:33,963 --> 00:45:36,265
       were now living in       
     ten hastily-constructed    

633
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:40,202
  inland "relocation centers."  

634
00:45:41,704 --> 00:45:47,709
           KASHIWAGI:           
    The camp that I had to go   
 to was Amache, out in Colorado.

635
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:51,312
  And it hit at 25 below zero.  

636
00:45:51,414 --> 00:45:55,383
    All we had was one little   
        potbellied stove        

637
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:56,485
    in each little apartment    

638
00:45:56,586 --> 00:46:02,357
    with a 60-watt light bulb   
         on the ceiling.        

639
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:06,829
     The barracks were just     
       makeshift barracks,      

640
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,698
     and the boards were not    
       matching together.       

641
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:13,435
   And there were big cracks,   
   and the wind was coming in.  

642
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,205
    And we stuffed newspapers   
           and things           

643
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:19,841
      in the cracks to keep     
        the elements out.       

644
00:46:21,144 --> 00:46:26,248
       We had to learn how      
     to live all over again.    

645
00:46:26,349 --> 00:46:32,687
            NARRATOR:           
  Armed guards and barbed wire  
  insured that no one got out.  

646
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,791
  Several who tried were shot.  

647
00:46:35,892 --> 00:46:41,029
          SUSUMU SATOW:         
 To walk into a double-security 
              fence             

648
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,165
        with guard tower        
          looking down          

649
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:47,836
          with guns...          

650
00:46:47,937 --> 00:46:52,241
You know, you wonder, "Gee, how,
  how could this be happening?" 

651
00:46:52,341 --> 00:46:53,508
       But it's happening.      

652
00:46:53,609 --> 00:46:55,911
         And so you kind        
    of accept that, I guess.    

653
00:46:56,012 --> 00:47:00,115
        ("Body and Soul"        
     by Benny Goodman plays)    

654
00:47:05,087 --> 00:47:09,491
            NARRATOR:           
    Wherever they were sent,    

655
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:11,393
 however they were made to live,

656
00:47:11,494 --> 00:47:17,399
    the internees acted like    
    the Americans they were.    

657
00:47:25,608 --> 00:47:29,978
             SATOW:             
         You, of course,        
       meet new people...       

658
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,881
      and you play cards...     

659
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:37,019
       and play baseball.       

660
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,989
     First thing we did was     
   to form a baseball league.   

661
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:45,727
We had games almost every night.

662
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:59,608
          ASAKO TOKUNO:         
        It was democracy        

663
00:47:59,709 --> 00:48:02,744
   on a small scale in action.  

664
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:08,850
 And we made it work, you know, 
  because everybody cooperated  

665
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:11,686
 and we knew we were going to be
         living together        

666
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:14,156
     for who knows how long.    

667
00:48:14,257 --> 00:48:17,659
            NARRATOR:           
     <i> LIFE</i> magazine claimed     
      the evacuees had been     

668
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,696
   "cheerful" about giving up   
  their homes and livelihoods.  

669
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:23,098
       After all, it said,      

670
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:28,403
        "All they forfeit       
       is their freedom."       

671
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:56,364
           SAM HYNES:           
 Dying is different for pilots, 

672
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,501
     for aviation personnel.    

673
00:48:59,602 --> 00:49:03,205
 On the ground, in the infantry,
        there's a corpse.       

674
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:06,775
    It might be blown apart,    
       but there's a foot       

675
00:49:06,876 --> 00:49:09,444
     or an arm or something.    

676
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:15,650
  In aviation, the planes tend  
  to go away and not come back. 

677
00:49:17,053 --> 00:49:20,923
      Even if someone dies      
      in the air with you,      

678
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:25,728
       the plane explodes,      
     it falls to the ground     

679
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:29,264
  at a place you'll never see.  

680
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:37,172
    I had a number of friends   
    killed during the war...    

681
00:49:37,273 --> 00:49:41,075
       ...but I never saw       
      any of their bodies.      

682
00:49:52,054 --> 00:49:55,056
           EARL BURKE:          
 The war came home to my family 

683
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:59,194
      on a very gut level.      

684
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,098
       Uh, my uncle, Earl,      

685
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:07,102
     who lived in Sacramento    
  called me one night and said, 

686
00:50:07,203 --> 00:50:09,037
    "I want you to come over    
          to my house."         

687
00:50:09,138 --> 00:50:12,307
   He was only a couple blocks  
   away, so I went over there.  

688
00:50:12,408 --> 00:50:16,178
   And he showed me an article  
   in the newspaper that said   

689
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:19,248
        there was a crash       
         in Puerto Rico.        

690
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:25,987
   And my only brother I had,   
         older brother,         

691
00:50:26,088 --> 00:50:31,759
      was listed as killed      
    in an airplane accident.    

692
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:36,798
    And we tried for 12 hours   
 on the telephone to try to get 

693
00:50:36,899 --> 00:50:42,103
 to Puerto Rico to confirm that 
  this was, indeed, my brother. 

694
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:44,639
   And finally, somebody says,  

695
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:50,412
    "Yes, it was a Tom Burke    
        from Sacramento."       

696
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:54,682
     Well, five days later,     
       we got the telegram      

697
00:50:54,783 --> 00:50:58,420
telling that he had been killed.

698
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:04,426
So that's how my war came to us.

699
00:51:13,135 --> 00:51:16,872
    And there was no talking    

700
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,540
    about what had happened.    

701
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:22,611
   My parents were very stoic.  

702
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:27,249
        And I only heard        
       my mother cry once.      

703
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,620
It was in her bedroom, since she
   never cried in front of me.  

704
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:36,458
     So it was a tough thing    
      for those two people.     

705
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,161
    For me, I lost a brother.   

706
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,831
         Yeah, damn it.         

707
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:46,601
    We're gonna do something    
            about it.           

708
00:51:46,702 --> 00:51:51,306
    Then I got the crazy idea   
   that I was going to enlist   

709
00:51:51,407 --> 00:51:56,044
        and win the war.        

710
00:51:56,712 --> 00:52:00,114
   It was kind of for Tommy...  

711
00:52:00,216 --> 00:52:02,950
            in a way.           

712
00:52:03,052 --> 00:52:04,886
       Not so consciously.      

713
00:52:04,987 --> 00:52:08,022
          I didn't say,         
     "This is for you, Tom."    

714
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:11,193
      No, I never did that.     

715
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,963
      But, uh, I enlisted.      

716
00:52:15,064 --> 00:52:16,665
         I'm glad I did.        

717
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:20,602
        (Benny Goodman's        
      "On the Alamo" plays)     

718
00:52:22,438 --> 00:52:25,741
    (troops shouting cadence)   

719
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,776
            NARRATOR:           
   Earl Burke joined the Army   

720
00:52:27,877 --> 00:52:31,012
        and trained first       
    at Fort Lewis in Seattle,   

721
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:35,583
where, he remembered, he learned
"how to pick up cigarette butts,

722
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:37,753
"paint anything that didn't move

723
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,388
 and salute anything that did." 

724
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:42,858
     Like his late brother,     

725
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:46,061
     he wanted to take part     
         in the air war.        

726
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:50,098
     After serving at a base    
      outside Reno, Nevada,     

727
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:53,235
      where he loaded bombs     
       onto heavy bombers,      

728
00:52:53,335 --> 00:52:57,705
 he was sent across the country 
   to Camp Shanks, New Jersey,  

729
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:01,176
    and then on June 1, 1943,   

730
00:53:01,277 --> 00:53:03,878
     boarded the<i> Queen Mary,</i>    

731
00:53:03,979 --> 00:53:07,248
      part of the seemingly     
endless stream of GIs now headed

732
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:11,686
     for England to prepare     
   for the invasion of France.  

733
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,065
    Soon after he got there,    
        he happened upon        

734
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:26,234
two old friends from Sacramento,

735
00:53:26,335 --> 00:53:30,304
       twin brothers named      
    Richard and Robert Egger.   

736
00:53:30,406 --> 00:53:33,908
             BURKE:             
    I was in a Red Cross hut    
           on a base.           

737
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:37,178
         It was kind of         
       a PX type of thing.      

738
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:40,415
   So as we were drinking beer  
          and all that,         

739
00:53:40,516 --> 00:53:41,783
 having a good time, they said, 

740
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:44,719
      "Well, why don't you      
          get with us?"         

741
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:51,592
 They were tail and ball turret 
       gunners on a B-17.       

742
00:53:51,693 --> 00:53:54,529
      It sounded like fun.      

743
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:56,564
    What the heck, you know?    

744
00:53:56,665 --> 00:53:58,166
            I was 19.           

745
00:53:58,267 --> 00:53:59,400
  I could've had a lot of fun.  

746
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:02,437
    They seemed to be having    
          a lot of fun.         

747
00:54:02,538 --> 00:54:06,441
       So I says, "Okay,"       
   so the next day I went down  

748
00:54:06,542 --> 00:54:09,310
     and got an application     
 and filled out the application.

749
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:13,715
   And at that time, they were  
    losing a lot of bombers.    

750
00:54:13,816 --> 00:54:16,218
 They were losing 60 at a time. 

751
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,588
        They were losing        
     over 600 men in a raid.    

752
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:22,357
  So they were taking anybody.  

753
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:23,892
     They were taking cooks.    

754
00:54:23,993 --> 00:54:25,961
 They were taking truck drivers,

755
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:30,432
 mechanics-- anybody they could 
      get into an airplane.     

756
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,770
        Nothing was going       
    to happen to me-- no way.   

757
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:37,072
        I'm 19 years old.       

758
00:54:37,172 --> 00:54:40,274
I'm going to conquer this world.

759
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:45,046
   Nothing was going to happen  
     to me, you know... no.     

760
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,357
            NARRATOR:           
        Until the Allies        
       were able to launch      

761
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,725
       their long-planned       
       invasion of Europe,      

762
00:54:57,826 --> 00:55:00,361
     the only way to weaken     
          German power          

763
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:05,233
        on the continent        
        was from the air.       

764
00:55:05,334 --> 00:55:09,938
  Since bombing during the day  
  attracted anti-aircraft fire  

765
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:11,940
 and swarms of German fighters, 

766
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:17,845
  the British preferred to fly  
    their missions at night.    

767
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:20,181
           (explosion)          

768
00:55:20,282 --> 00:55:22,950
 But when aerial surveys showed 

769
00:55:23,052 --> 00:55:25,820
      that only one in five     
    British bombs had fallen    

770
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:29,958
    within five miles of its    
   intended industrial target,  

771
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,426
      their policy shifted      

772
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:36,331
       to what was called       
         "area bombing."        

773
00:55:36,432 --> 00:55:40,635
   Relentless nighttime raids   
        on German cities,       

774
00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:43,604
       intended to destroy      
       not only factories,      

775
00:55:43,906 --> 00:55:45,273
     but whole neighborhoods    

776
00:55:45,474 --> 00:55:49,311
      and "break the spirit     
         of the people."        

777
00:55:55,651 --> 00:56:00,021
   While the British continued  
 to bomb German cities at night,

778
00:56:00,122 --> 00:56:04,893
the Americans decided to take on
  the much more dangerous task  

779
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:09,598
  of bombing defense industries 
             by day.            

780
00:56:18,207 --> 00:56:20,542
     The Americans believed     
           the B-17--           

781
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:22,777
 their big, four-engine bomber--

782
00:56:22,878 --> 00:56:28,215
    superior to anything else   
 their allies or the enemy had. 

783
00:56:28,317 --> 00:56:30,785
          It was called         
     the "Flying Fortress,"     

784
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:34,589
      because it was armed      
      with as many as nine      

785
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,024
    .50-caliber machine guns,   

786
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:38,727
  and each plane was fitted out 

787
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:41,563
     with the revolutionary     
        Norden bombsight,       

788
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,431
     said to be so accurate     

789
00:56:43,532 --> 00:56:47,769
     it made it possible to     
 "drop a bomb in a pickle barrel

790
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:50,304
       from 20,000 feet."       

791
00:56:59,915 --> 00:57:04,386
    Around-the-clock bombing    
      took a fearful toll.      

792
00:57:04,486 --> 00:57:07,888
   In late July, British bombs  

793
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:11,292
  set off a whirling firestorm  
           that burned          

794
00:57:11,393 --> 00:57:14,329
     or asphyxiated at least    
     40,000 German civilians    

795
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,298
     in and around Hamburg,     

796
00:57:17,399 --> 00:57:21,402
   taking almost as many lives  
           in one week          

797
00:57:21,503 --> 00:57:23,938
     as the German Luftwaffe    
            had taken           

798
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:27,975
         in eight months        
       of bombing Britain.      

799
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:32,413
  But the German will to resist 

800
00:57:32,514 --> 00:57:36,651
        only intensified,       
  just as the will of Londoners 

801
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:39,887
         had intensified        
        during the Blitz.       

802
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,156
       Hamburg's factories      

803
00:57:42,257 --> 00:57:45,426
   were soon back in business.  

804
00:57:48,163 --> 00:57:51,099
   Meanwhile, American airmen   

805
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,802
 were suffering terrible losses.

806
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:56,270
                   MAN:         
                   Planes, 9:00.

807
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:57,004
I got my sights.                

808
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,307
        (engine roaring)        

809
00:57:59,408 --> 00:58:01,842
        (artillery fire)        

810
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:05,713
              MAN:              
   317 out of control at 3:00.  

811
00:58:05,814 --> 00:58:08,616
            NARRATOR:           
      Earl Burke's friends      
        from Sacramento,        

812
00:58:08,717 --> 00:58:09,817
        the Egger twins,        

813
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:14,422
     would both be shot down    
      in the coming months.     

814
00:58:22,364 --> 00:58:25,533
             BURKE:             
     The number of missions     
       that you had to fly      

815
00:58:25,634 --> 00:58:28,369
    before you were returned    
          to the States         

816
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:31,005
  and/or given a non-combat job 

817
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:34,309
      was 25 at that point.     

818
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:38,413
 The average number of missions 

819
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:43,017
          flown in 1943         
       for a combat person      

820
00:58:43,118 --> 00:58:44,852
          was only 14.          

821
00:58:44,953 --> 00:58:50,424
        If you got to 14,       
     you were usually dead.     

822
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,661
            NARRATOR:           
   Earl Burke was now a member  

823
00:58:53,762 --> 00:58:56,764
  of the 854th Chemical Warfare 
            Company,            

824
00:58:56,865 --> 00:58:59,234
  part of the 384th Bomb Group  

825
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:03,538
       in the U.S. Army's       
        Eighth Air Force.       

826
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:06,808
     On September 16, 1943,     

827
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:09,243
          he clambered          
      into the ball turret      

828
00:59:09,344 --> 00:59:12,513
       for the first time.      

829
00:59:12,614 --> 00:59:16,851
   Their target was the German  
 submarine facilities at Nantes,

830
00:59:16,952 --> 00:59:18,954
      on the French coast.      

831
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:25,393
             BURKE:             
         The ball turret        
   is underneath the aircraft.  

832
00:59:25,494 --> 00:59:31,332
  You put your knees up against 
      your ears... almost.      

833
00:59:31,433 --> 00:59:33,234
  Almost like a fetal position, 

834
00:59:33,335 --> 00:59:36,204
'cause you're up in there jammed
      in that little thing,     

835
00:59:36,305 --> 00:59:39,207
           and you got          
      these horrendous guns     

836
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:45,346
 Didn't pass my mind that I was 
     getting into trouble...    

837
00:59:46,982 --> 00:59:50,218
   ...till the first mission.   

838
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:03,297
 We're flying about 28,000 feet.

839
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,934
     And, uh, the first time    
        I tried my turret       

840
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:10,170
  to see whether I could fire,  
    you know, possibly, uh...   

841
01:00:10,272 --> 01:00:13,541
       do a reasonable job      
  of tracking a fighter plane,  

842
01:00:13,642 --> 01:00:16,411
   I didn't know my right foot  
       from my left foot.       

843
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:18,345
       I thought I wanted       
     the gun to go that way,    

844
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:21,682
 and I'd press up my right foot,
        it'd go that way.       

845
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,318
        And I didn't know       
       where it was going.      

846
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,853
        I was so scared.        

847
01:00:25,954 --> 01:00:29,857
 I didn't know what I was doing.

848
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:36,630
     you know, before we got    
      to the bombing area,      

849
01:00:36,732 --> 01:00:39,034
        and the fighters        
      started to come out,      

850
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,770
   uh, I learned my right foot  
       from my left foot.       

851
01:00:42,871 --> 01:00:47,241
              MAN:              
  Two fighters, 6:00 up, coming 
     in, diving out, chief.

            NARRATOR:           
       Earl Burke survived      
       his first mission.       

855
01:01:12,668 --> 01:01:14,769
   The raid and others like it  

856
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:19,040
  reduced French coastal towns  
           to rubble.           

857
01:01:19,141 --> 01:01:25,145
  "Not a dog or a cat survived  
in them," a German officer said,

858
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:28,215
        but the concrete        
  submarine pens that had been  

859
01:01:28,316 --> 01:01:31,886
      the Americans' target     
        remained intact.        

860
01:01:31,987 --> 01:01:36,057
             BURKE:             
       Well, the accuracy       
         of our bombing         

861
01:01:36,158 --> 01:01:38,693
    left much to be desired.    

862
01:01:38,794 --> 01:01:43,330
 They said you could drop a bomb
      into a pickle barrel.     

863
01:01:43,432 --> 01:01:46,200
        We couldn't drop        
        a bomb in France        

864
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:50,504
 that hit anything, any target, 
        in the beginning.       

865
01:01:50,605 --> 01:01:52,073
    We just couldn't hit 'em.   

866

            NARRATOR:           
           In August,           

867
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:59,914
     376 B-17s had conducted    
  a massive raid on Schweinfurt 

868
01:02:00,015 --> 01:02:02,950
    and Regensburg, Germany,    
         hoping to smash        

869
01:02:03,051 --> 01:02:06,420
 the heavily-defended factories 
   that supplied ball bearings  

870
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,689
    to the Nazi war machine.

01:02:09,858 --> 01:02:12,994
            NARRATOR:

874
01:02:41,189 --> 01:02:43,992
     600 crewmen were lost.     

875
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:52,299
     The battered factories     
           were again           

876
01:02:52,334 --> 01:02:55,170
  back working round the clock. 

877
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,372
    And so the Allied command   

878
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:02,210
     ordered a second strike    
 on Schweinfurt for October 14.

      going to Schweinfurt.     

880
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,051
    And you could have heard    

881
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:14,155
      all the people groan      
       and moan... swear.       

882
01:03:14,256 --> 01:03:17,925
       Nobody wanted to go      
      back to Schweinfurt.      

883
01:03:20,628 --> 01:03:25,733
            NARRATOR:           
        Burke's squadron        
     was ready before dawn.

01:03:25,834 --> 01:03:27,468
             BURKE:             
  You were getting ready to go. 

885
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:31,005
  Those were the times you were 
     more nervous and scared    

886
01:03:31,106 --> 01:03:32,306
   to get into that airplane.   

887
01:03:32,407 --> 01:03:37,445
     You did not want to get    
       into that airplane.      

888
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:39,013
       But you did anyway.      

889
01:03:39,147 --> 01:03:43,784
     You got in the airplane    
    because your friends were   

890
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:47,121
    getting in the aircraft.    

891
01:03:48,156 --> 01:03:51,359
     You didn't want to let     
       your friends down.       

892
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,629
    Even though, you know...    

893
01:03:54,730 --> 01:03:57,731
       didn't want to go.

   and headed for Schweinfurt.  

896
01:04:16,451 --> 01:04:19,854
  Fighter escorts shielded them 
         across Belgium,        

897
01:04:19,955 --> 01:04:23,557
        then turned back        
   before their fuel ran out.   

898
01:04:25,026 --> 01:04:29,096
         Within minutes,        
   hundreds of German fighters  

899
01:04:29,197 --> 01:04:32,500
      rose up to meet them.     

900
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:36,137
     (rapid artillery fire)     

901
01:04:36,238 --> 01:04:39,340
             BURKE:             
    They came in ten abreast.   

902
01:04:43,245 --> 01:04:45,446
        (artillery fire)        

903
01:04:45,547 --> 01:04:48,683
          You see these         
       little things wink.      

904
01:04:48,783 --> 01:04:50,752
       And, as they wink,       
     you know what's coming.    

905
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:53,954
      You're talking about      
     a quarter pound of lead    

906
01:04:54,055 --> 01:04:57,391
        each time you saw       
       one of those winks.      

907
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,060
        (artillery fire)        

908
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,475
    Then they would stay off,   
      say a thousand yards,     

909
01:05:14,609 --> 01:05:17,645
      and they would lob...     
       lob rockets at you.      

910
01:05:19,381 --> 01:05:23,250
    because your .50 caliber    
machine gun couldn't touch them.

911
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:27,755
      That's why we needed      
      the fighter escorts.      

912
01:05:33,495 --> 01:05:35,463
     We were sitting ducks.     

913
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:39,367
             PILOT:             
       B-17 in trouble...       

914
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:40,935
           1:00 high.           

915
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:46,273
             BURKE:             
 When the bogeys were coming in,

916
01:05:46,374 --> 01:05:47,375
     you heard nine voices,     

917
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:52,413
         almost at once,        
     talking to each other.     

918
01:05:52,514 --> 01:05:53,648
      (overlapping voices)      

919
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:56,584
             BURKE:             
           "Holy shit,          
  look at that son of a bitch!" 

920
01:05:56,685 --> 01:05:58,820
             PILOT:             
  Don't yell on that intercom.  

921
01:06:01,323 --> 01:06:04,959
             BURKE:             
 And that's what we were hearing
       over my headphones,      

922
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:08,262
     because I couldn't hear    
    the battle sounds at all.   

923
01:06:08,363 --> 01:06:09,230
         (rapid gunfire)        

924
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:11,832
"That asshole's shooting at me?"

925
01:06:11,933 --> 01:06:13,701
         (rapid gunfire)        

926
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:19,607
     "No, no way that guy's     
        gonna shoot me."        

927
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:24,511
      (overlapping voices)      

928
01:06:24,612 --> 01:06:26,080
      And you're up there,      
         you're pressing        

929
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:27,548
   the little red button here.  

930
01:06:27,649 --> 01:06:29,516
       And, uh, hope that       
        he flies into it.       

931
01:06:29,617 --> 01:06:34,621
    And I was up there flying   
  two .50 caliber machine guns, 

932
01:06:34,722 --> 01:06:38,993
 shooting rounds of shells about
    half an inch in diameter.   

933
01:06:39,094 --> 01:06:41,828
         (rapid gunfire)        

934
01:06:48,803 --> 01:06:51,171
    Lots of lead in the air.    

935
01:06:57,112 --> 01:07:00,114
             PILOT:             
     Going out... and out...    

936
01:07:02,117 --> 01:07:04,751
   Take the shot, you guys...   

937
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:08,322
           One shot...          

938
01:07:09,757 --> 01:07:12,326
 (indistinct radio transmission)

939
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:17,030
            NARRATOR:           
    As Earl Burke's battered    
formation approached its target,

940
01:07:17,132 --> 01:07:18,665
  the German fighters withdrew, 

941
01:07:18,766 --> 01:07:23,504
    and American crews braced   
     for yet another terror:    

942
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:26,306
       antiaircraft fire--      

943
01:07:26,407 --> 01:07:27,908
        exploding shells        
       that filled the air      

944
01:07:28,009 --> 01:07:30,645
 with thousands of metal shards.

945
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:38,919
  The Germans called it "flak." 

946
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:43,090
             PILOT:             
  B-17 out of control at 3:00.  

947
01:07:43,191 --> 01:07:45,560
            NARRATOR:           
    Many more planes were hit   

948
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:48,229
 and never reached their target.

949
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:03,477
             BURKE:             
     And over Schweinfurt...    

950
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,114
            ...bang.            

951
01:08:07,215 --> 01:08:11,152
 Plexiglas on my right-hand side
            exploded.           

952
01:08:12,187 --> 01:08:14,355
   My left-hand side exploded.  

953
01:08:14,456 --> 01:08:18,725
  And a 20-millimeter shell had 
   come up through my turret,   

954
01:08:18,826 --> 01:08:21,228
   hitting me in the left arm.  

955
01:08:21,329 --> 01:08:25,499
      Not breaking the arm,     
    but smashing the bone...    

956
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,401
     tearing my jacket off,     

957
01:08:27,502 --> 01:08:31,605
           and went up          
      into the waist window     

958
01:08:31,706 --> 01:08:34,675
     on the left-hand side,     
        hit the stanchion       

959
01:08:34,776 --> 01:08:37,445
     of the .50 caliber gun,    
          and blew up.          

960
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:41,815
    Killed the waist gunner.    

961
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:44,651
       And here I was down      
       in this ball turret      

962
01:08:44,752 --> 01:08:47,354
      trying to figure out      
   what I was supposed to do.   

963
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,856
    And, I have to say this,    

964
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:54,895
  my training as an Eagle Scout 
  in the Boy Scouts of America  

965
01:08:54,996 --> 01:08:57,398
     saved my arm that day.     

966
01:08:57,498 --> 01:09:00,400
   Because I put a tourniquet   
 around it, knew how to do that.

967
01:09:00,501 --> 01:09:03,237
        You know, to stop       
       the flow of blood.       

968
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:06,574
    And, uh, then everything    
        hunky-dory then.        

969
01:09:06,674 --> 01:09:10,611
     And continued on flying    
       in the ball turret.      

970
01:09:10,712 --> 01:09:17,117
        So it's about 35,       
     40 degrees below zero.     

971
01:09:17,218 --> 01:09:19,953
    And when blood flows out,   

972
01:09:20,054 --> 01:09:24,492
    it freezes and drops down   
 and rolls around on the bottom.

973
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,795
   So the idea is to make sure  
  that when you're at altitude, 

974
01:09:27,896 --> 01:09:30,931
     you pick your blood up     
        and throw it out.       

975
01:09:31,032 --> 01:09:35,302
     you'd have to mop it up    
  when you got down. (chuckles) 

976
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,538
  But I fly... I flew that way  

977
01:09:37,639 --> 01:09:42,876
        for around four,        
     four and a half hours.     

978
01:09:42,977 --> 01:09:45,513
         When I got hit,        
       immediately I says,      

979
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:48,682
 "Oh, my goodness... my parents.

980
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:52,019
      "My parents will get      
        another telegram        

981
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,755
      telling either I was      
        wounded or dead."       

982
01:09:54,856 --> 01:09:58,125
         At that point,         
      I didn't know which.      

983
01:09:58,226 --> 01:10:00,594
     That was the first time    
         I ever thought         

984
01:10:00,695 --> 01:10:03,764
  what my being in the service  

985
01:10:03,865 --> 01:10:07,935
       did to my parents.       

986
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,804
 And I had second thoughts then.

987
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:11,972
      But it was too late.      

988
01:10:12,106 --> 01:10:15,208
             PILOT:             
  1:00 high... coming around... 

989
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:17,277
            NARRATOR:           
    German fighters returned    

990
01:10:17,378 --> 01:10:20,047
    and attacked the bombers    
      in Earl Burke's group     

991
01:10:20,148 --> 01:10:21,381
        again and again,        

992
01:10:21,482 --> 01:10:24,484
        all the way back        
     to the English Channel.    

993
01:10:27,422 --> 01:10:29,556
         (rapid gunfire)        

994
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:58,752
      The survivors landed      
      wherever they could,      

995
01:10:58,853 --> 01:11:03,057
     at airfields scattered     
       all across England.      

996
01:11:05,126 --> 01:11:13,100
 The second Schweinfurt raid was
just as disastrous as the first.

997
01:11:17,205 --> 01:11:21,108
       60 more Fortresses       
       had been shot down.      

998
01:11:21,209 --> 01:11:24,245
     600 more men were lost     

999
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:28,215
 and hundreds more were wounded.

1000
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:33,187
        Surviving airmen        
       remembered that day      

1001
01:11:33,288 --> 01:11:36,056
      as "Black Thursday."      

1002
01:11:37,091 --> 01:11:39,660
     We, uh, first were sent    

1003
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:43,697
        to a bomber base        
        to meet the B-17s       

1004
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:45,899
     coming in shooting off     
           red flares,          

1005
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,703
        which meant there       
      were wounded aboard.      

1006
01:11:51,539 --> 01:11:54,975
The first one came in just right
       over the treetops.       

1007
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:58,512
        We thought it was       
         going to crash.        

1008
01:12:00,915 --> 01:12:04,585
    It skidded on the runway.   

1009
01:12:04,686 --> 01:12:06,554
   And I was in the ambulance.  

1010
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,222
 We ran over there and ran in...

1011
01:12:09,324 --> 01:12:11,592
        You had to crawl.       

1012
01:12:11,693 --> 01:12:16,931
  There was no way to get back  
     to a B-17 standing up.     

1013
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,299
    The tail gunner was dead.   

1014
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:24,772
    He'd been, you know, just   
  shot right through the head.  

1015
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:30,878
  The copilot and the pilot had 
         been in a fire.        

1016
01:12:30,978 --> 01:12:35,349
   The belly gunner was hurt.   

1017
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,619
     They were all injured.     

1018
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:42,656
      I guess that the, uh,     
          plane that...         

1019
01:12:42,757 --> 01:12:44,825
        the German plane        
       that fired on them       

1020
01:12:44,926 --> 01:12:48,596
  just riddled the whole plane. 

1021
01:12:51,332 --> 01:12:56,036
            NARRATOR:           
Earl Burke's injury kept him out
      of action for weeks.      

1022
01:12:56,137 --> 01:12:58,905
        But each time he        
         or anyone else         

1023
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:00,975
      returned to the air,      

1024
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:06,480
 their odds of surviving the war
          grew longer.          

1025
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:14,054
             BURKE:             
I kept away from making friends.

1026
01:13:14,155 --> 01:13:18,391
     I did not make friends.    

1027
01:13:18,493 --> 01:13:23,597
   if you met a guy at the...   
at the PX and bought him a beer,

1028
01:13:23,698 --> 01:13:26,700
   tomorrow he would be gone.   

1029
01:13:26,801 --> 01:13:32,206
 You know, and you kept saying, 
      "I'm losing people."      

1030
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:35,910
   So you locked yourself up.

          JIM SHERMAN:          
            I think,            
    particularly in Luverne,    

1060
01:15:59,387 --> 01:16:06,126
 there was this general feeling 
     of we're in the right,     

1061
01:16:06,227 --> 01:16:08,262
  we're doing the right thing,  

1062
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:13,200
      and all of the things     
 that we're doing, collectively,

1063
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:18,172
 sort of brought a lot of people
            together.           

1064
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:21,407
       It was in a totally      
        different feeling       

1065
01:16:21,509 --> 01:16:24,278
   that I don't think can ever  
      be duplicated, ever.      

1066
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:29,749
   I just don't think that you  
could have that sense of oneness

1067
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:32,919
        that, that we had

            NARRATOR:           
          Almost a year         
      before Pearl Harbor,      

1070
01:16:37,591 --> 01:16:41,628
     129 National Guardsmen     
  from Rock County, Minnesota,  

1071
01:16:41,729 --> 01:16:45,632
   had found themselves called  
         to active duty.        

1072
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:51,138
    They were eventually sent   
           to Alaska,           

1073
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:56,209
   to help protect Fort Greely  
        on Kodiak Island.

01:16:57,278 --> 01:17:00,080
            SHERMAN:            
   And I was totally confused.  

1075
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:03,250
       I thought that was       
    where they made cameras.    

1076
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:04,818
     I thought it was Kodak.    

1077
01:17:04,919 --> 01:17:06,587
         And I couldn't,        
       for the life of me,      

1078
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:10,157
  figure out why all these guys 
     from Luverne were going    

1079
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,891
           to wherever          
    they made Kodak cameras.

            NARRATOR:           
An auto dealer named Ryal Miller
  visited the men of Battery E  

1081
01:17:17,998 --> 01:17:19,399
     while hunting in Alaska    

1082
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,736
      and filmed them with      
   an eight-millimeter camera.  

1083
01:17:22,837 --> 01:17:24,771
        When he got back,       

1084
01:17:24,872 --> 01:17:27,641
    he showed his home movies   
       at the Pix Theater       

1085
01:17:27,742 --> 01:17:29,409
   on Main Street in Luverne,   

1086
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:31,578
     and families crowded in    
          for a glimpse         

1087
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,981
  of how their boys were doing.

1090
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:00,006
           Afterwards,          

1091
01:18:00,107 --> 01:18:03,210
     people were encouraged     
 to make their own home movies, 

1092
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:06,045
     and to write greetings     
    to their faraway friends    

1093
01:18:06,146 --> 01:18:11,017
   on a wrapping-paper letter   
    that stretched 120 feet.    

1094
01:18:11,118 --> 01:18:14,354
 The town barber, Kay Aanenson, 

1095
01:18:14,455 --> 01:18:18,124
  whose nephew Quentin had just 
   joined the Army Air Force,   

1096
01:18:18,225 --> 01:18:23,030
       had helped organize      
       the letter writing.

 VERNON FREMSTAND (dramatized): 
    "Dear Kay and everybody,

            NARRATOR:           
  Luverne, Minnesota, was about 
   as far away from the action  

1115
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:26,126
    as any place in America,    

1116
01:19:26,227 --> 01:19:33,300
 but each day the war's reality 
     grew closer and closer.    

1117
01:19:35,002 --> 01:19:36,670
            SHERMAN:            
       I delivered papers.      

1118
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:39,673
     And all of the mothers     
  who had somebody in the Army  

1119
01:19:39,774 --> 01:19:43,042
    would have a blue star in   
 the window on the little flag. 

1120
01:19:43,143 --> 01:19:48,915
   And then, if... if the son   
  or husband or whatever died,  

1121
01:19:49,016 --> 01:19:52,285
       they'd change that       
         to a gold star.        

1122
01:19:52,386 --> 01:19:53,687
The gold star mothers were those

1123
01:19:53,788 --> 01:19:55,922
  who had lost a family member  
           in the war.          

1124
01:19:56,023 --> 01:20:01,661
    And, uh, it was the fact    
   that the star had changed.   

1125
01:20:01,762 --> 01:20:04,531
       But I was too young      

1126
01:20:04,632 --> 01:20:08,568
      to really understand      
   the consequences of death.

            FRAZIER:            
     We didn't know anything    
       about the Japanese       

1131
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,258
     when we were captured,     

1132
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:35,361
  and they didn't know anything 
         much about us.         

1133
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:38,564
  We most certainly didn't know 
         their language.        

1134
01:20:42,269 --> 01:20:49,375
 And to be able to be compelled 
   or... or made obey an order  

1135
01:20:49,476 --> 01:20:51,645
    that you didn't even know   
      what the order was--      

1136
01:20:51,746 --> 01:20:55,582
       a misunderstanding       
     or not any, any idea--     

1137
01:20:55,683 --> 01:21:00,654
       and this depending       
    on you maybe surviving...

01:21:00,755 --> 01:21:05,158
            NARRATOR:

     the Bataan Death March     

1139
01:21:05,259 --> 01:21:06,359
    and weeks of imprisonment   

1140
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:08,294
        at Camp O'Donnell       
       in the Philippines,      

1141
01:21:08,395 --> 01:21:11,431
    where survival had seemed   
          so unlikely,          

1142
01:21:11,532 --> 01:21:16,436
  he had thrown one of his dog  
     tags into a mass grave     

1143
01:21:16,537 --> 01:21:19,940
  that held the bodies of many  
    of his fellow prisoners.    

1144
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:24,477
      That way, he thought,     
  if they were ever recovered,  

1145
01:21:24,578 --> 01:21:28,348
   his family back in Alabama   
     would find some comfort    

1146
01:21:28,449 --> 01:21:31,652
           in knowing           
    what had happened to him.

      to take Guadalcanal,      

1148
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:38,725
       Frazier was shipped      
      all the way to Japan,     

1149
01:21:38,826 --> 01:21:43,430
    to a prisoner-of-war camp   
           near Osaka.          

1150
01:21:45,065 --> 01:21:47,634
            FRAZIER:            
           The number           
    that the Japanese gave us   

1151
01:21:47,735 --> 01:21:49,836
    was like a serial number.   

1152
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:52,839
       And mine was 6-32.       

1153
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:57,544
      <i> Roko naka san juni,</i>      
   is the number in Japanese.   

1154
01:21:57,645 --> 01:21:58,945
And they put it on your clothes.

1155
01:21:59,046 --> 01:22:02,281
 You had a little button saying,
            uh, 6-32.           

1156
01:22:02,383 --> 01:22:04,050
         And it was, uh,        
  it was part of your records,  

1157
01:22:04,151 --> 01:22:10,023
 and I kept that number all the 
  way through my days in Japan. 

1158
01:22:10,124 --> 01:22:14,161
            NARRATOR:           
   The commandant told Frazier  
    and his fellow prisoners    

1159
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:19,699
   they would be treated well,  
   as "guests of the Emperor."  

1160
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,501
         They were not.         

1161
01:22:21,602 --> 01:22:26,005
    What little food they had   
           was rotten.          

1162
01:22:26,173 --> 01:22:27,874
     Barracks were unheated.    

1163
01:22:27,975 --> 01:22:32,378
   The prisoners were divided   
 into ten-man "shooting squads."

1164
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:35,581
 If one member tried to escape, 

1165
01:22:35,682 --> 01:22:40,753
      he and all the others     
         would be shot.         

1166
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:44,925
    Frazier developed double    
   pneumonia and nearly died.   

1167
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:50,196
   All the prisoners were made  
  to work in Japanese foundries 

1168
01:22:50,297 --> 01:22:54,601
        or on the docks,        
  loading and unloading ships.  

1169
01:22:54,702 --> 01:22:57,169
Small children jeered and cursed

1170
01:22:57,271 --> 01:22:59,639
        as they walked to       
       and from the docks,      

1171
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:00,940
      calling them cowards      

1172
01:23:01,041 --> 01:23:07,747
     for having surrendered,    
 rather than fight to the death.

1173
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:17,290
    Guards beat the prisoners   
           regularly,           

1174
01:23:17,391 --> 01:23:22,729
   and the smallest infraction  
   of rules could prove fatal.  

1175
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:28,301
  One day I was walking, coming 
   back from a detail that day  

1176
01:23:28,402 --> 01:23:29,536
    on the streets of Osaka.    

1177
01:23:29,636 --> 01:23:32,405
    And the weather was cold.   

1178
01:23:32,506 --> 01:23:34,641
       And I put my hands       
          in my pocket,         

1179
01:23:34,742 --> 01:23:38,478
      and I'm walking along     
      with everybody else.      

1180
01:23:38,579 --> 01:23:41,514
     When we got to the camp    
     and they checked us in,    

1181
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:44,484
    this guard pointed me out   
       and called me out.       

1182
01:23:44,585 --> 01:23:49,055
And, uh, said, "Why did you have
   your hands in your pocket?"  

1183
01:23:49,156 --> 01:23:52,325
  I said, "Because I was cold." 

1184
01:23:52,426 --> 01:23:55,294
       So they took me in       
     the commander's office     

1185
01:23:55,396 --> 01:23:57,063
    and the interpreter says,   

1186
01:23:57,164 --> 01:24:01,201
         "That's against        
       the military code.       

1187
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:05,171
      Soldiers do not walk      
     with hands in pockets."    

1188
01:24:05,272 --> 01:24:10,076
  And I said, "Well, I'm not a  
soldier, I'm a prisoner of war."

1189
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:13,045
So the commander banged his fist
       on his desk, and--       

1190
01:24:13,147 --> 01:24:15,582
        he was a major--        
     and got up and he says,    

1191
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:18,618
      the interpreter said,     
 "He don't like your attitude." 

1192
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:23,490
  So he come up and he started  
        arguing with me,        

1193
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:27,060
  and I couldn't... I couldn't  
  understand anything he said.  

1194
01:24:27,161 --> 01:24:28,561
   So he pulled his saber out   

1195
01:24:28,662 --> 01:24:31,864
    and he said "He was going   
   to make an example of you,   

1196
01:24:31,966 --> 01:24:35,368
   "so that the other men will  
           understand           

1197
01:24:35,469 --> 01:24:38,204
   they have to obey orders."   

1198
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:44,210
      So he puts his sword      
       to my throat, here,      

1199
01:24:44,311 --> 01:24:46,746
  and I could feel a little bit 
      of blood coming down.     

1200
01:24:46,847 --> 01:24:50,783
    So the interpreter said,    
  "He's going to execute you."  

1201
01:24:50,884 --> 01:24:55,021
     So he asked me if I had    
     any last words to say.     

1202
01:24:55,122 --> 01:24:59,993
And I looked him straight in the
eye and I said, "He can kill me,

1203
01:25:00,094 --> 01:25:01,727
 "but he can not kill my spirit.

1204
01:25:01,829 --> 01:25:04,397
     "And my spirit's going     
      to lodge in his body      

1205
01:25:04,498 --> 01:25:08,335
          and haunt him         
     until the day he dies."    

1206
01:25:13,374 --> 01:25:16,075
       And he had a frown       
       come over his face       

1207
01:25:16,176 --> 01:25:19,145
  and took three steps backward 
      and lowered his sword     

1208
01:25:19,246 --> 01:25:20,647
    and ordered me to be put    

1209
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:24,350
    in a five-by-five-by-five   
     cubicle in the ground.     

1210
01:25:24,451 --> 01:25:29,656
        I had never seen        
      a Japanese back down      

1211
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:32,291
         in front of any        
       of his subordinates      

1212
01:25:32,393 --> 01:25:34,761
   until that particular time.  

1213
01:25:34,862 --> 01:25:36,629
        Because once they       
       got to that point,       

1214
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:43,135
   they went through with it,   
   regardless of the results.   

1215
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:52,411
       ("One O'Clock Jump"      
      by Count Basie plays)     

1216
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,582
            NARRATOR:           
    As the country mobilized    
         for total war,         

1217
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:57,550
  Americans at home were asked  

1218
01:25:57,651 --> 01:25:59,018
       by their government      
          to do without         

1219
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:03,523
      most of the luxuries      
   and many of the necessities  

1220
01:26:03,624 --> 01:26:05,391
         they had begun         
      to take for granted.      

1221
01:26:05,559 --> 01:26:11,063
Everything seemed to be rationed
       or in short supply:      

1222
01:26:11,165 --> 01:26:15,134
      gasoline and fuel oil     
           and rubber;          

1223
01:26:15,235 --> 01:26:17,904
     bobby pins and zippers     
          and tin foil;         

1224
01:26:18,005 --> 01:26:20,973
        shoes and whiskey       
        and chewing gum;        

1225
01:26:21,074 --> 01:26:26,445
  butter and coffee and nylons  
  and tomato ketchup and sugar; 

1226
01:26:26,546 --> 01:26:29,115
  canned goods and cigarettes,  

1227
01:26:29,216 --> 01:26:33,419
         and the matches        
      needed to light them.     

1228
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,456
            SHERMAN:            
      I guess the deep-down     
          feeling I had         

1229
01:26:36,557 --> 01:26:40,393
      is that they made us      
           sacrifice,           

1230
01:26:40,494 --> 01:26:41,995
   and if we were sacrificing,  

1231
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:45,532
      we would somehow feel     
    closer to the war effort.   

1232
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:48,635
 And I think that's really what 
     they were trying to do,    

1233
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:53,172
was to get your attitude in that
   our fighting men and women   

1234
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:55,808
    don't have these, so you    
      shouldn't have these,     

1235
01:26:55,909 --> 01:26:58,911
     and somehow you'll get     
    tied into the war effort.   

1236
01:26:59,012 --> 01:27:01,448
      We did without during     
         the Depression,        

1237
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:07,320
     so doing without these     
commodities really was not hard.

1238
01:27:07,421 --> 01:27:11,157
 Recipes were adjusted according
     to what you could get.     

1239
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:13,293
         Now, there were        
       shortages all over.      

1240
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:19,465
       You could get very       
       little white flour.      

1241
01:27:19,566 --> 01:27:22,835
         Cakes were all         
      adjusted to no sugar,     

1242
01:27:22,936 --> 01:27:28,074
         very little fat        
   or shortening of any sort.   

1243
01:27:28,175 --> 01:27:32,012
        So cakes took it        
      as hard as anything.      

1244
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:35,415
     To have a birthday cake    
        was a real treat,       

1245
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:38,918
      because it meant they     
     had to save everything     

1246
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,353
        to make one cake.       

1247
01:27:40,454 --> 01:27:43,923
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
           Look, Miss.          

1248
01:27:44,024 --> 01:27:47,193
      You could drive a car     
  from Los Angeles to New York  

1249
01:27:47,294 --> 01:27:51,964
with the gas that plane burns up
   in just one hour of combat.  

1250
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:53,633
      It takes two million      
         gallons of gas         

1251
01:27:53,734 --> 01:27:56,870
  to send a single 1,000-bomber 
   raid over enemy territory.   

1252
01:27:57,037 --> 01:27:59,438
     That's enough to drive     
    1,000 private automobiles   

1253
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:02,909
       7,500 miles a year       
         for four years.        

1254
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:06,613
 Now, where would you rather see
       that "no gas" sign?      

1255
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:08,981
         At his station?        

1256
01:28:09,082 --> 01:28:13,719
            NARRATOR:           
      But many people tried     
    to get around rationing,    

1257
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:16,589
   and a thriving black market  
             grew up            

1258
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:20,593
        to satisfy those        
    who couldn't do without.    

1259
01:28:20,694 --> 01:28:22,729
     According to one study,    

1260
01:28:22,829 --> 01:28:25,498
        one in every four       
       retail transactions      

1261
01:28:25,599 --> 01:28:31,304
   during the war was illegal.

           "Surprised?

        "Well, I am, too,       

1273
01:29:12,012 --> 01:29:16,715
      "but I am very safe,      
         so don't worry.        

1274
01:29:16,817 --> 01:29:19,318
          Love, Babe."          

1275
01:29:22,289 --> 01:29:24,824
            NARRATOR:           
  At the Casablanca Conference  

1276
01:29:24,925 --> 01:29:28,260
        back in January,        
 the Allies had publicly called 

1277
01:29:28,361 --> 01:29:31,230
 for the unconditional surrender
          of the Axis,          

1278
01:29:31,331 --> 01:29:38,537
  and privately decided upon an 
invasion of the island of Sicily

1279
01:29:38,638 --> 01:29:45,178
 what Churchill called "the soft
    underbelly of the Axis."    

1280
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:47,413
     American commanders had    
      impatiently insisted      

1281
01:29:47,514 --> 01:29:50,349
       on a cross-channel       
       invasion of France,      

1282
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:52,618
   but the British were wary,   

1283
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:55,054
   still haunted by the memory  
          of the losses         

1284
01:29:55,155 --> 01:29:59,392
     they had suffered there    
   during the First World War.  

1285
01:29:59,493 --> 01:30:02,695
       They got their way.      

1286
01:30:02,796 --> 01:30:04,764
     Sicily would be first.     

1287
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:08,600
 (dramatic newsreel music plays)

1288
01:30:10,537 --> 01:30:13,906
       NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER:      
   American troops of General   
      Patton's Seventh Army     

1289
01:30:14,007 --> 01:30:18,510
  move swiftly through western  
 Sicily, taking town after town 

1290
01:30:18,612 --> 01:30:19,779
      as they drive to join     

1291
01:30:19,947 --> 01:30:24,016
      General Montgomery's      
      British Eighth Army.      

1292
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:28,121
 (explosions and rapid gunfire) 

1293
01:30:36,897 --> 01:30:38,965
         (men shouting)         

1294
01:31:03,057 --> 01:31:08,294
           DWAIN LUCE:          
    And Patton came to see us   
         and talk to us.        

1295
01:31:08,395 --> 01:31:09,795
      We all loved Patton.      

1296
01:31:09,896 --> 01:31:10,830
       We loved Ike, too.       

1297
01:31:10,931 --> 01:31:12,899
  But I mean, we loved Patton.  

1298
01:31:12,999 --> 01:31:18,604
 He says, "Now, some troops can 
 move and some troops can shoot.

1299
01:31:18,705 --> 01:31:23,275
"But when you can move and shoot
        at the same time,       

1300
01:31:23,376 --> 01:31:27,813
    then you and Napoleon are   
pissing through the same straw."

1301
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:46,899
            NARRATOR:           
 It took the Allies just 38 days
       to capture Sicily,       

1302
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,705
        pushing the enemy       
    from one town to another.   

1303
01:31:52,806 --> 01:31:55,240
  Thousands of civilians died,  

1304
01:31:55,341 --> 01:32:03,917
   and 25,000 Allied soldiers   
   were dead or out of action.  

1305
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:08,755
   The Axis lost 167,000 men,   

1306
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:13,292
    the overwhelming majority   
        of them Italian.        

1307
01:32:13,393 --> 01:32:17,030
        Tens of thousands       
     of crack German troops     

1308
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:20,533
     had managed to escape.     

1309
01:32:20,634 --> 01:32:23,936
       In Rome, Mussolini       
        had been deposed        

1310
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:26,673
       by his own generals      
         and counselors.        

1311
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:30,143
   The new Italian government   
   surrendered on September 8   

1312
01:32:30,243 --> 01:32:34,780
        and declared war        
   on Germany soon thereafter.  

1313
01:32:34,881 --> 01:32:39,719
  But there were now more than  
      132,000 German troops     

1314
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,521
waiting on the Italian mainland.

1315
01:32:42,622 --> 01:32:47,860
         Another 460,000        
 were on their way to join them.

1316
01:32:47,961 --> 01:32:53,599
 And a daring Nazi commando raid
rescued Mussolini from captivity

1317
01:32:53,700 --> 01:33:00,706
and set him up in northern Italy
   as head of a puppet regime.  

1318
01:33:00,807 --> 01:33:03,308
   It was clear to the Allies   

1319
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:06,345
 that the Germans were resolved 
          to hold Italy         

1320
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:10,082
          at all costs.         

1321
01:33:13,286 --> 01:33:15,688
       When we got through      
        in North Africa,        

1322
01:33:15,789 --> 01:33:17,957
  we kept telling the Russians  

1323
01:33:18,058 --> 01:33:20,692
  that we were going to open up 
         another front.         

1324
01:33:20,793 --> 01:33:22,194
   Uh, but we couldn't open up  

1325
01:33:22,295 --> 01:33:24,697
  the front across the channel  
         at that point.         

1326
01:33:24,798 --> 01:33:25,698
   It would have been suicide.  

1327
01:33:25,799 --> 01:33:27,433
  The British were quite right  
           about that.          

1328
01:33:27,534 --> 01:33:31,237
         And so, we had,        
      we had to go into...      

1329
01:33:31,338 --> 01:33:34,440
We went into Sicily; that turned
    out to be fairly simple.    

1330
01:33:34,541 --> 01:33:35,908
        And then we went        
        across to Italy,        

1331
01:33:36,009 --> 01:33:37,810
        which we thought        
  was going to be like Sicily,  

1332
01:33:37,911 --> 01:33:40,346
  and it turned out to be much  
   more, much more difficult.   

1333
01:33:40,447 --> 01:33:44,450
            NARRATOR:           
     "Italy is like a boot,"    
       Napoleon once said.      

1334
01:33:44,551 --> 01:33:47,519
     "You must enter it like    
    Hannibal, from the top."    

1335
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:53,425
 The Allies planned to attack it
        from the bottom.        

1336
01:33:53,526 --> 01:33:57,729
        (alarms blaring)        

1337
01:33:57,831 --> 01:34:00,432
 (rapid gunfire and explosions) 

1338
01:34:03,736 --> 01:34:10,309
   At first, everything seemed  
    to go according to plan.    

1339
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:14,413
The Fifth Army landed at Salerno
         on September 9.        

1340
01:34:14,514 --> 01:34:17,617
         (men shouting)         

1341
01:34:20,887 --> 01:34:22,021
     The British Eighth Army    

1342
01:34:22,122 --> 01:34:25,258
      seized the important      
      airfields at Foggia.      

1343
01:34:26,793 --> 01:34:31,630
And Naples fell to the Americans
          on October 1.         

1344
01:34:31,731 --> 01:34:34,667
     (applause and cheering)    

1345
01:34:34,768 --> 01:34:39,038
   Despite fierce resistance,   
         in three months        

1346
01:34:39,139 --> 01:34:42,875
       the Allies managed       
    to achieve two key goals:   

1347
01:34:42,976 --> 01:34:46,211
      They had forced Italy     
         out of the war         

1348
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:47,846
      and onto their side,      

1349
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:51,517
 and they were keeping thousands
      of German troops busy     

1350
01:34:51,618 --> 01:34:55,888
       who might otherwise      
  have been fighting in Russia  

1351
01:34:55,989 --> 01:35:01,427
      against the invasion      
   both sides knew was coming.  

1352
01:35:01,528 --> 01:35:04,730
The Allies' target now was Rome,

1353
01:35:04,831 --> 01:35:08,534
      only 150 miles away.      

1354
01:35:08,635 --> 01:35:14,473
Getting there would prove harder
than anyone could have imagined.

1355
01:35:17,944 --> 01:35:20,212
     With the Allied forces     

1356
01:35:20,313 --> 01:35:24,616
     was Private Babe Ciarlo    
   of Waterbury, Connecticut,   

1357
01:35:24,717 --> 01:35:25,885
   now a member of Company G,   

1358
01:35:25,986 --> 01:35:31,457
Second Battalion, 15th Regiment,
    Third Infantry Division,    

1359
01:35:31,558 --> 01:35:33,459
       Fifth Allied Army,       

1360
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:37,162
        under the command       
     of General Mark Clark.     

1361
01:35:39,098 --> 01:35:42,801
   On September 18, nine days   
    after the first elements    

1362
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:45,972
  of the Fifth Army had landed  
           at Salerno,          

1363
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:51,376
   the Third Division had gone  
      ashore to join them.      

1364
01:36:00,153 --> 01:36:01,086
        (distant gunfire)       

1365
01:36:01,187 --> 01:36:04,724
    BABE CIARLO (dramatized):   
       "October 20, 1943.       

1366
01:36:04,825 --> 01:36:06,092
          "Dear family,         

1367
01:36:06,193 --> 01:36:10,663
    "I know I haven't written   
     to you for a long time,    

1368
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:12,998
  "the Army has been keeping me 
          pretty busy.          

1369
01:36:13,099 --> 01:36:16,035
 "I suppose you've been keeping 
    up with the news lately,    

1370
01:36:16,136 --> 01:36:18,503
         "and by the way        
   we're beating the Germans,   

1371
01:36:18,604 --> 01:36:21,841
       this war won't last      
          much longer."         

1372

     "Eddie and I are dying     
     for some nice raviolis,    

1373
01:36:25,978 --> 01:36:30,783
"and I don't think it'll be long
       before we get them.

    "Will you please send me    
     Mom's brother's address

1376
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:37,656
        (shell explodes)        

1377
01:36:37,658 --> 01:36:39,725
          "Love, Babe."         

1378
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:46,465
            NARRATOR:           
 Babe was careful always to keep
the details of what he was doing

1379
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:50,903
         from his family        
 so as not to alarm his mother. 

1380
01:36:51,004 --> 01:36:53,405
 But her brother lived in Rome, 

1381
01:36:53,506 --> 01:36:56,542
     and Babe clearly wanted    
       everybody back home      

1382
01:36:56,643 --> 01:36:59,912
 to know he'd made it to Italy. 

1383
01:37:00,013 --> 01:37:01,581
            SOLDIER:            
              Fire!             

1384
01:37:07,854 --> 01:37:09,988
  (automatic gunfire, shouting) 

1385
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:13,191
       As the Allies tried      
         to move north,         

1386
01:37:13,292 --> 01:37:14,627
     the weather turned bad,    

1387
01:37:14,728 --> 01:37:17,763
    and the terrain grew more   
      and more forbidding.      

1388
01:37:17,864 --> 01:37:18,964
        (artillery blast)       

1389
01:37:19,065 --> 01:37:20,866
    Crags, deep-cut valleys,    

1390
01:37:20,968 --> 01:37:24,970
    twisting mountain roads,    
         blown bridges--        

1391
01:37:25,071 --> 01:37:28,039
 all under constant German fire 

1392
01:37:28,141 --> 01:37:32,578
      from hidden hillside      
          strongholds.          

1393
01:37:32,679 --> 01:37:35,013
      (machine gun firing)      

1394
01:37:51,364 --> 01:37:53,699
   Bill Mauldin, from Mountain  
        Park, New Mexico,       

1395
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:58,570
 was a cartoonist for<i> Stars and</i> 
 <i> Stripes,</i> the Army newspaper.  

1396
01:37:58,671 --> 01:38:01,674
        Week after week,        
    he managed to find laughs   

1397
01:38:01,775 --> 01:38:04,777
          in the lives          
    of ordinary infantrymen,    

1398
01:38:04,878 --> 01:38:06,378
     even when, as he said,     

1399
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:11,216
 "You don't think life could be 
      any more miserable."

         The men learned        
    to sleep while marching--   

1422
01:39:39,272 --> 01:39:41,573
    it was "a kind of coma,"    
        one remembered--        

1423
01:39:41,674 --> 01:39:44,510
   and when they got a chance   
          to lie down,          

1424
01:39:44,611 --> 01:39:48,613
   preferred to sleep on rocks  
     rather than bare ground    

1425
01:39:48,714 --> 01:39:51,751
       because rocks were       
         relatively dry.        

1426
01:39:51,852 --> 01:39:56,755
   Hundreds of mules were used  
     to carry up supplies...    

1427
01:39:57,524 --> 01:40:01,126

1429
01:40:13,006 --> 01:40:17,076
  the Allies battered their way

      the Volturno Line...

    was pulled back to rest.    

1437
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:41,199
  In 58 straight days of combat 
  since the landing at Salerno, 

1438
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:49,074
     they had lost 3,265 men    
  and moved less than 50 miles. 

1439
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:54,112
       The Third Division       
 would cycle through 76,000 men

            NARRATOR:           
  The terrible losses suffered  

1455
01:42:43,523 --> 01:42:49,395
  during the second assault on  
 Schweinfurt in October of 1943 

1456
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:53,666
    in which 88 more American   
   bombers had been shot down   

1457
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:56,302
         helped persuade        
     the Allies to cut back     

1458
01:42:56,403 --> 01:42:57,903
  on daytime raids over Germany 

1459
01:42:58,004 --> 01:43:00,972
     until they could design    
   and produce enough fighters  

1460
01:43:01,073 --> 01:43:02,708
  capable of escorting bombers  

1461
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:06,845
      all the way to their      
     targets and back again.    

1462
01:43:06,946 --> 01:43:10,416
     The targets themselves     
     were changed, as well.     

1463
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:15,721
    Bombers continued to bomb   
    cities, including Berlin,   

1464
01:43:15,888 --> 01:43:17,890
  and to batter war industries, 

1465
01:43:17,991 --> 01:43:21,594
   but the destruction of the   
 German air force on the ground,

1466
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:25,731
     as well as in the air,     
     now took top priority.     

1467
01:43:25,733 --> 01:43:28,200
             AIRMAN:

1471
01:43:34,073 --> 01:43:38,110
            NARRATOR:           
   The Allies were determined   
      to dominate the skies     

1472
01:43:38,211 --> 01:43:41,346
       before the planned       
       invasion of France.      

1473
01:43:41,447 --> 01:43:43,649
             AIRMAN:

1475
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:54,359
           EARL BURKE:          
        Of course, being        
        an enlisted man,        

1476
01:43:54,461 --> 01:43:57,462
  we didn't think the officers  
   knew what they were doing.   

1477
01:43:57,563 --> 01:44:01,900
We could have fought it a little
    bit better than they did.   

1478
01:44:05,839 --> 01:44:11,176
        But occasionally,       
  the missions came off proper. 

1479
01:44:13,512 --> 01:44:15,380
      that these guys knew      
      what they were doing.     

1480
01:44:15,481 --> 01:44:16,849
       They were fighting       
         the right war.         

1481
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:23,421
 It was not an economical thing 
     to do in terms of life.    

1482
01:44:23,522 --> 01:44:27,092
     You'd lose ten bombers,    

1483
01:44:27,193 --> 01:44:29,594
       you'd lose 100 men.      

1484
01:44:34,701 --> 01:44:36,368
    (airplane engine roaring)   

1485
01:44:36,469 --> 01:44:39,571
            NARRATOR:           
Earl Burke was no longer flying.

1486
01:44:39,672 --> 01:44:41,773
   He had been wounded again,   

1487
01:44:41,874 --> 01:44:43,175
      this time by shrapnel     

1488
01:44:43,276 --> 01:44:47,379
    from a bomb that exploded   
   while he was on the ground.  

1489
01:44:50,283 --> 01:44:52,417
             BURKE:             
   They put me in a hospital.   

1490
01:44:52,518 --> 01:44:54,186
     And there they told me     

1491
01:44:54,287 --> 01:44:57,422
           that I had           
     to have my arm removed.    

1492
01:44:57,523 --> 01:44:58,690
        But fortunately,        

1493
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:02,394
    the chief of surgery came   
      upon me in a hallway      

1494
01:45:02,495 --> 01:45:04,896
         as I was going         
    into the operating room.    

1495
01:45:04,998 --> 01:45:08,066
Says, what was I doing in there?

1496
01:45:08,167 --> 01:45:11,603
     guess I'm going to have    
 a little problem with my arm." 

1497
01:45:11,704 --> 01:45:13,672
  "What's wrong with your arm?" 

1498
01:45:13,773 --> 01:45:14,840
     "I-I... I got wounded,     

1499
01:45:14,941 --> 01:45:17,943
            and I got           
 what they call osteomyelitis." 

1500
01:45:18,043 --> 01:45:20,912
    And that was the scourge    
         of World War I.        

1501
01:45:21,013 --> 01:45:24,916
 If you got wounded in the bone,
      that's what happened.     

1502
01:45:25,017 --> 01:45:29,621
     He says, "That... no...    
       not going to do it.      

1503
01:45:29,722 --> 01:45:33,057
  They put me back in the ward, 
    bring me back in a cast,    

1504
01:45:33,158 --> 01:45:36,895
     cut a hole in the cast,    
put a little wire net across it.

1505
01:45:36,996 --> 01:45:38,096
  I said, "What are you doing?" 

1506
01:45:38,197 --> 01:45:40,331
      He says, "I'm making      
  a little home for somebody."  

1507
01:45:40,433 --> 01:45:42,667
      I said, "What is that     
    little home going to do?"   

1508
01:45:42,769 --> 01:45:46,037
   He says, "I'm going to keep  
these little guys in on your arm

1509
01:45:46,138 --> 01:45:48,840
 so they can eat all that stuff 
       out of your bone."       

1510
01:45:48,941 --> 01:45:51,710
     And I said, "Well, what    
    kind of things are they?"   

1511
01:45:51,811 --> 01:45:54,312
    He says, "They're little    
          white things,         

1512
01:45:54,414 --> 01:45:57,148
    Had a handful of maggots,   
     flipped them in there,     

1513
01:45:57,249 --> 01:45:58,817
      and put the wire cage     
           back on it.          

1514
01:45:58,918 --> 01:46:00,752
  Says, "Now those little guys  
            are going           

1515
01:46:00,853 --> 01:46:02,353
 "to eat that stuff out of you, 

1516
01:46:02,455 --> 01:46:04,255
     "'cause we can't get it    
           out of you.          

1517
01:46:04,356 --> 01:46:06,357
     No way we can get that     
          out of you."          

1518
01:46:06,459 --> 01:46:09,427
    So there I was with this    
    little thing over there,    

1519
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:13,431
     and watching those guys    
         having a meal.         

1520
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:17,602
I was in the hospital 15 months.

            NARRATOR:           
 Earl Burke's air war was over. 

1522
01:46:21,741 --> 01:46:23,374
   He returned to California,   

1523
01:46:23,475 --> 01:46:26,477
helped rescue pilots lost at sea
      on training missions,     

1524
01:46:26,579 --> 01:46:32,050
     and finally, went home     
  to his parents in Sacramento.

01:47:12,525 --> 01:47:15,394
            NARRATOR:           
       Despite the all-out      
          Allied raids,         

1527
01:47:15,495 --> 01:47:20,331
   German aircraft production   
    would actually increase.    

1528
01:47:21,467 --> 01:47:24,002
   "We are virtually drowning   
          in aircraft,"         

1529
01:47:24,103 --> 01:47:25,838
     wrote one German flyer.    

1530
01:47:25,939 --> 01:47:30,775
But the Luftwaffe was now losing
    trained crews far faster    

1531
01:47:30,876 --> 01:47:32,444
  than they could be replaced.  

1532
01:47:32,545 --> 01:47:37,081
       And Allied bombing       
   had also denied the Germans  

1533
01:47:37,183 --> 01:47:41,586
        the precious fuel       
 they needed to train new ones. 

1534
01:47:42,889 --> 01:47:44,156
      "The time has come,"      

1535
01:47:44,257 --> 01:47:47,792
     the chief of the German    
fighter wing told his superiors,

1536
01:47:47,893 --> 01:47:52,364
 "when our force is within sight
          of collapse."         

1537
01:47:54,867 --> 01:47:57,836
        (engines humming)       

1538
01:47:57,937 --> 01:48:02,007
   When the time finally came   
        to invade France,       

1539
01:48:02,107 --> 01:48:06,512
 the Allies would own the skies.

1540
01:48:13,018 --> 01:48:15,320
    AL McINTOSH (dramatized):   
      "Luverne, Minnesota.

1564
01:49:32,865 --> 01:49:35,400
            NARRATOR:           
  Americans could now look back 

1565
01:49:35,501 --> 01:49:39,938
      on some real progress     
  in the war against the Axis.  

1566
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:44,142
     In the Pacific Theater     
         of Operations,         

1567
01:49:44,243 --> 01:49:48,447
  Americans had recaptured Attu 
     in the Aleutian Islands    

1568
01:49:48,548 --> 01:49:53,118
        and were fighting       
 on Bougainville and New Guinea.

1569
01:49:53,219 --> 01:49:57,822
   But the Japanese were still  
     on the march in Burma,     

1570
01:49:57,923 --> 01:50:01,125
       intent on invading       
       northeastern India.      

1571
01:50:01,226 --> 01:50:04,228
      And the long campaign     
      to take the Gilberts,     

1572
01:50:04,329 --> 01:50:06,765
          the Marshalls         
       and the Carolines,       

1573
01:50:06,866 --> 01:50:08,433
   to liberate the Philippines  

1574
01:50:08,534 --> 01:50:11,703
      and eventually attack     
    the Japanese home islands   

1575
01:50:11,804 --> 01:50:15,306
      had only just begun.      

1576
01:50:15,908 --> 01:50:17,976
    In the European Theater,    

1577
01:50:18,077 --> 01:50:19,844
         improved radar,        

1578
01:50:19,946 --> 01:50:22,047
new, long-range Allied aircraft,

1579
01:50:22,147 --> 01:50:24,649
    and ever-growing numbers    
         of escort ships        

1580
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:26,451
 sailing from American shipyards

1581
01:50:26,552 --> 01:50:30,621
       reduced the threat       
      from German U-boats.      

1582
01:50:30,722 --> 01:50:33,191
      More and more weapons     
          and equipment         

1583
01:50:33,292 --> 01:50:35,994
        were now reaching       
   the embattled Soviet Union.  

1584
01:50:36,095 --> 01:50:39,497
When the Red Army began to sweep
   the enemy from the Ukraine,  

1585
01:50:39,598 --> 01:50:42,901
 thousands of newly-manufactured
         American trucks        

1586
01:50:43,002 --> 01:50:47,472
      helped make possible      
      their deadly pursuit.     

1587
01:50:47,573 --> 01:50:51,810
    The Axis had been driven    
     from North Africa, too,    

1588
01:50:51,911 --> 01:50:56,514
       and Sicily was now       
        in Allied hands.        

1589
01:50:56,615 --> 01:51:02,053
      But the Germans were      
  fighting back hard in Italy.  

1590
01:51:02,655 --> 01:51:04,022
         And in secret,         

1591
01:51:04,123 --> 01:51:07,726
     they had already begun     
      to implement a policy     

1592
01:51:07,827 --> 01:51:09,260
     of systematized murder     

1593
01:51:09,361 --> 01:51:13,464
   that would one day persuade  
   even the most cynical G.I.   

1594
01:51:13,566 --> 01:51:17,202
 that the war had to be fought. 

1595
01:51:19,972 --> 01:51:22,807
 As Allied leaders drew up plans

1596
01:51:22,908 --> 01:51:25,744
  for the long-delayed invasion 
        of the continent,       

1597
01:51:25,844 --> 01:51:29,147
  Hitler put tens of thousands  
       of laborers to work      

1598
01:51:29,248 --> 01:51:33,118
          strengthening         
      his coastal defenses.     

1599
01:51:36,422 --> 01:51:38,723
     For the men of Luverne,    
           Sacramento,          

1600
01:51:38,824 --> 01:51:45,129
       Mobile, Waterbury,       
 and every other American town, 

1601
01:51:45,230 --> 01:51:49,367
        things were bound       
      to get still tougher.
