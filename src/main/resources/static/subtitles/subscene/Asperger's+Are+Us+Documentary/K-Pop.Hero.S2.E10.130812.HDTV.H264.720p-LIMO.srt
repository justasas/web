[A Special Girl
 - IU's Appearance]

3
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,430
IU is a cute girl like my boo because she is very sweet.

4
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,830
But she started out differently. Do you remember that?

5
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,680
She made her first appearance in 2008 at the ripe age of 16.

6
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,160
She was complimented by many musicians even before her debut.

7
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:45,000
She sang exceptionally well unlike a girl and presented "Lost Child" as her debut song.

8
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,700
[It's a hybrid pop song based on ballad but with hip-hop rhythm on electronic]

9
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,690
[It gave a unique feel balancing electronic sounds with strings]

10
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,620
[It describes a person wandering like a lost child after losing a loved one]

11
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,550
[Her captivating voice was praised despite being only 16 years old]

12
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,880
I sang at Dongdaemun when I was in junior high.

13
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:12,780
I lied that I was 17 when I was actually 14. There was a singing contest every week.

14
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,780
1-3 place were picked and given a gift certificate.

15
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,250
I went every week as a different kid to get those certificates.

16
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,800
Every week as a different kid?

17
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,920
- You changed your name?
 - There were 3 stages.

18
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,750
I went around here and there.

19
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,830
She developed her dream of being a singer at my karaoke when she was in junior high.

20
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,850
She was a regular for Room 2.

21
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:47,390
She came more than 5 times a week and sang 2-3 hours when she came.

22
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,700
That was a long time.

23
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,020
I always went on days when I didn't have after school.

24
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,430
- He gave a lot of bonuses...
 - He gave them?

25
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,600
She developed her dream of being a singer ever since she was young.

26
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,970
She was a rookie but did her best on stage.

27
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:16,180
She was one of a handful of skilled rookies but her start wasn't easy.

28
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,920
Everyone's the same but I usually don't bear any malice.

29
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,210
But if someone tries to step on me then I will try to step on them.

30
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,280
It's because everyone's the same.

31
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,320
- When you have an interview...
 - You fight with the reporters?

32
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,330
I debuted when I was really young at the age of 16.

33
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,620
I was also alone. Most of the reporters are kind but...

34
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,960
There are those that make you feel discouraged now and then.

35
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,740
We'll be discouraged on our own since we were rookies but...

36
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,030
I didn't want to be discouraged since I was being made to feel that way.

37
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,520
This wasn't the only thing that gave this 16-year-old a hard time.

38
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,470
Let's say I get a question like "What music do you want to do?"

39
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,060
If I say that I want to do such and such music and also compose...

40
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,580
Then they'll say something like "You'll vanish without a trace."

41
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:21,770
"I saw many like you. You'll vanish if you do that."

42
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:27,770
They say that with a smile and it makes me upset.

43
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,960
I can avoid that now because of my interview skills but...

44
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,090
Since he said he saw many like me...

45
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:42,240
I said, "I've never seen a reporter like you."

46
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,300
[Firm confidence]

47
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,410
I asked, "Do you wish for me to vanish?"

48
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:55,280
He said, "I'm just concerned and said that so you'll do well."

49
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,370
I said, "I'll do well as you wish."

50
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,140
Then I got reprimanded at the agency for saying that.

51
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,470
I met the same reporter again after "Good Day" was a success.

52
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:16,150
He's always smiling as he makes cutting remarks.

53
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,870
He says, "I heard that you're busy nowadays."

54
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,820
I say, "I'm busy. I'm really busy."

55
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:28,110
"You should be proud that I did well as you wished."

56
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,690
Then what did he say?

57
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,510
He did this and left.

58
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,130
[IU KO'd him!]

59
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,780
I'm on close terms with that reporter.

60
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,440
- Male or female?
 - Male.

61
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,260
He has affection for you but his way of speaking is like that.

62
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:50,760
I didn't have any amibition for popularity when I debuted.

63
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,470
I remember what I wrote in my diary after having an interview with him.

64
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,390
"I have to become popular."

65
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,390
- He planted that in you.
 - You must feel thankful.

66
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:07,620
But such hardships are doing her good now.

67
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,250
They will say such things and closely watch if the rookies can overcome it.

68
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,250
He must have watched her after saying that.

69
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,670
This song created synergism as it met the cute IU.

70
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,700
"Boo" is the title track of her 1st album.

71
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,680
IU wore clothes befitting her age with this song.

72
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,780
She unleashed her cuteness which is completely different from her debut image.

73
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,160
[An uptempo song with 80s retro sound]

74
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,260
[A snobby girl falls in love with an unexpected guy]

75
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,150

76
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,230
["Boo" is the sound she made while warming up her lips]

77
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,190
[It was put in the intro and made the song even cuter]

78
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,210
"You Know" is included in the same album.

79
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,530
[It's about making an honest confession to one's boyfriend]

80
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,610
[Her cute charms stand out from her energetic voice]

81
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:02,640
[The song was remade into a rock version with a cheerleader concept]

82
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,560
She still sings well in this lively stage with a cheerleader concept.

83
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,550
She draws more attention with such performances as she creates her style.

84
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,300
Next is IU.

85
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:18,590
I combined several songs with "crush" as the theme.

86
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,380
Give her a hand.

87
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:30,350
[IU's impromptu crush medley]

88
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,670
Guitar playing IU covered an acoustic version of songs.

89
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,840
It used to be her trademark.

90
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,470
Her timbre that goes with the guitar is very nice.

91
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,140
["Meeting" is born into a new genre with a sweet guitar melody]

92
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,680
[It makes even the original "Nation's MC" satisfied]

93
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,070
[It's now the climax]

94
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,330
How was the Lee Deok-hwa Show seeing it again after a year?

95
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:44,360
It's because of us if this goes well, but Lee Deok-hwa's fault if it doesn't.

96
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,910
She can sing various genres.

97
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:23,550
Even songs from before her birth aren't an exception.

98
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,980
[She's thoroughly educated from the fundamentals]

99

Doing great.

102
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,280
She's an admirable junior who can sing her seniors' songs.

103
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,450
That could be the reason why they look at her kindly.

104
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,440
[Her Charming Potential]

105
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,170
["Marshmallow" has the retro sounds and trends of 60s rock & roll]

106
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,280
She released her second mini-album in 2009.

107
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,860
"Marshmallow" is a pop song based on 60s rock & roll.

108
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,240
Her cuteness was upgraded with this song.

110

We need a doll before this person comes in.

Even the character on stage is cute. Do you know who the marshmallow is?

114
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,270
[The marshmallow is her manager!]

115
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,510
Stay there since you can't go all the way there.

116
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,860
Marshmallows are good when roasted over fire.

117
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,850
A duet with the "Nation's Little Sister" will stir up jealousy in everyone.

118
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:47,360
IU made harmony with 2AM's Seulong for her digital single "Nagging."

119

[Their sweet harmony stood out in this duet]

He had to explain himself on air for the crime of hugging her.

125
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:34,320
Many must have nagged him about it but cheer up.

126
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,600
- With popular singer IYO...
 - It's IU not IYO.

127
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,920
There's also a lucky guy who got to sing a duet with IU.

128
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,140
We're curious how you got to sing a duet with IU.

129

 - Really? You must be talented.

130

There are people like him who are VJs and send in clips while being a cabdriver.

131

01:06:54,190 --> 01:07:00,870
It's my first time being an MC and people tell me, "You're MC."

514
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:04,420
So one time I said, "This is MC gayo live."

515
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:09,050
Taecyeon and Wooyoung on MC gayo...

516
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:11,530
- MC gayo...
 - Inkigayo!

517
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,020
[Cute mistake by a rookie MC]

518
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:28,320
[Bouncy lines for MCs on a music program!]

519
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:34,600
She played the mascot well after getting back up from her mistake.

520
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:37,060
[1 min to the live show!]

521
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,540
[IU and Lee Jong-suk are Inkigayo's MCs!]

522
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:42,150
[As if they are actually MCs on Inkigayo!]

523
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:46,010
Jong-suk, do you know who's appearing today?

524
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:48,420
IU, what do you take me for?

525
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:53,120
- It's Lexa born to lead gayo.
 - Nope, you're wrong.

526
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:58,340
- It's Nu Clear gayo's atomic storm.
 - Nope, it isn't Nu Clear.

527
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:03,370
I know for sure this time. It's Key gayo's skeleton key.

528
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,730
I'm disappointed in you Jong-suk.

529
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:08,480
It's Get Ya Boom who's making a comeback after 10 years.

530
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,620
[He's making a comeback?]

531
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,920
Boom shakalaka still has lingering feelings.

532
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:19,610
Let's meet him. Music start!

533
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,180
[This is sad, please stop...]

534
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:30,160
[Lee Jong-suk the new Inkigayo MC]

535
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:34,500
IU's the best so far at acting in Inkigayo.

536
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:41,430
I fell hard one time and it still hurts.

537
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:44,730
Efforts don't matter. I need to do well.

538
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:51,050
I have to do well to look good because this is visual sports.

539
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:53,010
I can't do that.

540
01:08:55,710 --> 01:09:00,740
It was big for her since she's clumsy.

541
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:11,460
I heard that you're not athletic.

542
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,330
Do you think you'll be fine?

543
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:17,510
I... I... will do it.

544
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:24,600
It's a difficult challenge but people took it the wrong way.

545
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,380
[After reading the article...]

546
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:39,030
Some people didn't receive it well and I'm pretty upset about it.

547
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:46,010
People said I didn't put any effort but I think I did put in effort.

548
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:53,550
People said such things because I was worse compared to others.

549
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:57,990
I think I have to do better in the next performance.

550
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:01,830
There's not that many steps so do just half of them.

551
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:03,990
[Can't get this particular move]

552
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,740
[She practiced every day for 4-5 hours despite her schedule]

553
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:20,390
Doing good!

554
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:24,730
IU's admirable for getting an applause for putting effort.

555
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:32,640
I'm your fan.

556
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,840
I knew skating would be hard but the reason I tried is...

557
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,980
because I can greet you from this distance.

558
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:50,330
I would like to sing the show's theme song with you if the opportunity arises.

559
01:10:52,630 --> 01:10:57,200
IU and Yuna Kim revealed that they're both fans of each other.

560
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:03,190
The wish to sing together came true with the theme song "Ice Flower."

561
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:07,820
It's a heartwarming meeting between two "Nation's Little Sister."

562
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:19,180
IU releases her 2nd album after 2 years.

563
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:26,150
Corinne Bailey Rae, who she respects, wrote a song for her.

564
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:28,440
[IU's calm voice went well with Kim Kwang-jin's lyrical melody]

565
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:34,500
[He added his voice and appeared on a music program after 10 years]

566
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:36,230
The title track "You and I" was born amidst such great songs.

567
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:41,020
The song has a mysterious concept of a girl who went to the future.

568
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,490
She once again sang the special love of a girl.

569
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,430
[IU's unique sentiment and voice can be heard in this song]

570
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:20,440
[Instruments rarely heard in gayo such as harps and horns were used to create real sounds]

571
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:25,070
[She attempted various voices with a concept of traveling through space and time]

572
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:28,130
[Her singing skills have not waned and that's the charm of this song]

573
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:36,940
She felt this song will be a big hit since the recording.

574
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:42,420
People outside including myself didn't feel good about it.

575
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:48,660
Lee Min-soo composed this song who also composed "Nagging" and "Good Day."

576
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:53,420
He also composed "Abracadabra" for Brown Eyed Girls.

577
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:58,330
We started recording but I didn't agree with him from A to Z.

578
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:02,390
"You should sing like this!" "Shouldn't I sing like this?"

579
01:20:02,390 --> 01:20:08,560
We got emotional so he said, "Then you compose the song!"

580
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:11,760
And I said, "Then you sing!"

581
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,710
[That's childish]

582
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:17,850
[They're really close]

583
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:23,610
He left and went to his room not the recording studio.

584
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,500
I was also upset because this recording is for the title track.

585
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:31,980
I said bye to leave and went back to the recording studio.

586
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:38,440
I told the people there that I'll be back tomorrow and left.

587
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:43,310
One of the engineers took hold of me and reasoned with me.

588
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:47,960
"Min-soo is older than you. You shouldn't act like that."

589
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,640
We were talking here and my manager was here.

590
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:56,540
He was nodding his head. Our eyes didn't meet...

591
01:20:56,540 --> 01:21:00,000
but I know someone is there.

592
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,300
Since he was nodding his head, I thought, "I hate him."

593
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:05,510
Since he agrees.

594
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:11,250
He told me to apologize and do well tomorrow.

595
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:14,300
I said that I will and he told me to go now.

596
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:19,230
I said I will and my manager went inside the recording studio.

597
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:22,720
I thought, "Is he playing or did he leave something inside?"

598
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:29,010
I followed him inside but there was nobody.

599
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,050
[What?]

600
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:35,120
I asked the engineer, "Do you know where my manager went?"

601
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,340
"What's wrong with you?"

602
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:41,170
I said, "He went inside when we were talking here."

603
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:44,690
He said, "It was just us."

604
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:46,900
"No, he was here!"

605
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:50,720
I went outside and asked where he was.

606
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:54,550
"He's over there." I saw him coming out from over there.

607
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:56,920
It was a different place.

608
01:21:56,920 --> 01:22:00,530
No one believed me.

609
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:06,500
People say it'll be a big hit if you see a ghost in the recording studio.

610
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:11,330
This is how "You and I" was born and it placed IU at the top.

611
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:15,640
The ghost of the recording studio jinx went well.

612
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,080
I'm getting the goosebumps.

613
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:39,480
IU is now 20 and releases a single filled with her sentiments.

614
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:45,470
She conveyed her sentiments with "Peach" her own song about the excitement of love.

615
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:51,780
She tweeted a picture of a peach she drew before the song was released.

616
01:22:51,780 --> 01:22:55,220
She drew attention with that picture.

617
01:22:57,270 --> 01:23:01,320
The peach that IU drew attracted attention.

618
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:08,370
I was told to draw one that will be included in the teaser.

619
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:11,460
I drew it in the shape of a heart.

620
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:17,870
I turned it upside down since that's obvious.

621
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:23,850
I gave it but they said they can't use it because it's erotic.

622
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:25,840
- Erotic?
 - An erotic peach?

623
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,780
Then give it to Shin Dong-yup.

624
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:31,420
But it's a peach.

625
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:38,020
I couldn't throw it away since I drew it so I tweeted it.

626
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:41,160
- That's how it appeared in the articles.
 - What did the articles say?

627
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:44,970
- It was called "erotic peach."
 - Let's take a look at it.

628
01:23:44,970 --> 01:23:47,110
This is how she first drew it.

629
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:53,370
But people like Shin Dong-yup could see this in an erotic way.

630
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:56,100
This is how it changed.

631
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,500
It's nicer.

632
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:00,590
The first one is attractive.

633
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:02,080
It looks like a butt.

634
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,830
The first one looks like a real peach.

635
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,950
"Every End of the Day" was released after "Peach."

636
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:14,930
Her uniquely clear voice stood out in this song.

637
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:19,440
She changed from a cute teen into one in her 20s with deeper feelings.

638
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:23,300
We look forward to the performances she will be giving in the future.

639
