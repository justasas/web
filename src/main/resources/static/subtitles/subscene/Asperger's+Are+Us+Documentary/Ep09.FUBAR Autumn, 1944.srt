00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:34,687
MAN ON RADIO:
It's seven o'clock in the morning

2
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:38,007
and we're steaming along
the western coast of Peleliu Island.

3
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:42,367
In just about an hour and a half,
the marines will hit the beaches there.

4
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,687
Before that,
the warships of this task force,

5
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:46,687
which have been pounding the island
for three days,

6
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:49,247
will give it a final, terrific softening up.

7
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:54,607
WOMAN: Everybody had
a radio during the war. No TVs.

8
00:00:54,607 --> 00:00:58,247
And three times a day
you got the national news,

9
00:00:58,247 --> 00:01:04,487
and three times a day you did not
be far from that radio.

10
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:07,327
And, of course, my mother had
about a four-by-four map.

11
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:11,487
I really don't know where she got it.
It was a map of all of Europe.

12
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:15,167
And she had a big, long rule stick,
and that map hung right there

13
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:18,767
and it covered that little wall
where the, um, buffet is.

14
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:20,407
And when news time came,

15
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:24,407
she followed all the battles
with the rule stick on the map.

16
00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:27,287
She would have been a great historian.

17
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,925
She would have been.

18
00:01:38,407 --> 00:01:43,087
NARRATOR: Before the Japanese
attacked on December 7, 1941,

19
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,477
most Americans could not have
found Pearl Harbor on a map.

20
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:51,687
In the two and a half years that followed,

21
00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:53,687
they had had to learn
a host of new names

22
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:55,837
of the places their sons were fighting.

23
00:01:57,487 --> 00:02:01,275
Kasserine Pass
and Monte Cassino and Anzio.

24
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,562
Utah Beach and Omaha Beach.

25
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:09,885
Sainte-Mère-Église
and Saint-Lô and the Falaise Gap.

26
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:17,367
And on the other side of the world,
Guam and Bataán and Guadalcanal.

27
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:23,081
Midway and Saipan
and the Philippine Sea.

28
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,367
Before the war could end,

29
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:34,007
the citizens of Mobile, Alabama
and Sacramento, California,

30
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:36,887
Luverne, Minnesota
and Waterbury, Connecticut,

31
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:39,527
and every other town in America,

32
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:42,200
would be forced to learn
still more names.

33
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:47,438
Arnhem and Aachen
and the Hurtgen Forest.

34
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:53,207
The Vosges mountains
and the Ardennes and Remagen,

35
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:58,486
Peleliu and Luzon and lwo Jima,
and more.

36
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:08,602
And young men from those towns would
learn lessons as old as war itself...

37
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:15,679
...that generals make plans,
plans go wrong, and soldiers die.

38
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:26,887
MAN: "To the noncombatants
and those on the periphery of action,

39
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:30,038
"the war meant only boredom
or occasional excitement.

40
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:36,607
"But to those who entered
the meat grinder itself,

41
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,367
"the war was a netherworld of horror

42
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,967
"from which escape seemed
less and less likely

43
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:45,527
"as casualties mounted
and the fighting dragged on and on."

44
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:48,367
(FLAMES CRACKLE)

45
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:52,447
"Time had no meaning.
Life had no meaning.

46
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:59,647
"The fierce struggle eroded the veneer of

Eugene Sledge.

48
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:04,327
(EXPLOSION)

49
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,807
The men coined names for the chaos
in which they often found themselves

50
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:12,607
and the ineptitude of some
of the officers who sent them there,

51
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:14,487
employing language
they would never have used

52
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,527
in front of their mothers or their wives
back home.

53
00:04:18,527 --> 00:04:23,447
'SNAFU' - 'situation normal,
all fucked up'.

54
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:27,281
And 'FUBAR' - 'fucked up
beyond all recognition'.

55
00:04:44,447 --> 00:04:46,367
MAN: General Patton
is a very wise person,

56
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:48,835
despite his personal eccentricities.

57
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:55,767
He said a number of memorable things
about war that only real soldiers know.

58
00:04:55,767 --> 00:05:01,847
He said, "All plans last only
until the time of the first shot."

59
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:03,407
Then they're set aside.

60
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:07,087
Then you just have to go
on sheer invention and guts

61
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,927
and not running away
and various other things

62
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:11,997
that are never, never mentioned.

63
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:20,207
By September of 1944,

64
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:23,677
the Allies seemed to be moving steadily
toward victory in Europe.

65
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:26,727
On the eastern front,

66
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:32,407
the Russians had taken parts
of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland,

67
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:36,559
and inflicted 700,000 more casualties
on the retreating Germans.

68
00:05:38,247 --> 00:05:40,807
And in the 11 weeks since D-day,

69
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,447
American, British and Canadian forces

70
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:47,727
had freed most of France and Belgium
and parts of Holland

71
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:52,327
and were arrayed along the 350-mile belt
of concrete fortifications

72
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:54,841
the Germans called the 'Westwall'.

73
00:05:56,047 --> 00:06:00,047
Beyond it lay the heart of Germany itself.

74
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:04,887
Allied planners had not expected
their forces to get that far

75
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:07,447
for another eight months.

76
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:12,047
George Patton's Third Army
had set the pace,

77
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:15,687
covering 400 miles in less than 30 days,

78
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:21,567
though he had outrun his supplies
and was desperately short of fuel.

79
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:26,927
His armoured columns alone required
some 600,000 gallons of gasoline

80
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:29,202
every 50 miles.

81
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,887
On September 11,

82
00:06:33,887 --> 00:06:39,678
an armoured unit of the US First Army
crossed the German frontier.

83
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:46,727
"Militarily", General Dwight Eisenhower's
chief of staff told the press,

84
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:48,285
"this war is over."

85
00:06:49,847 --> 00:06:53,487
Post exchanges were ordered
to halt all holiday packages

86
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:55,527
for the men on the European front.

87
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:59,645
Nearly everyone was certain
the war would be over by Christmas.

88
00:07:01,727 --> 00:07:05,767
There was no room in the supply trucks
for winter clothing either.

89
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,281
Besides, the men wouldn't need it.

90
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:18,127
Meanwhile, the British had taken
the important Belgian port of Antwerp,

91
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:21,367
but no fuel or supplies
could be landed there

92
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:24,327
because the Germans
still held the estuary

93
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:28,127
that lay between the city
and the North Sea.

94
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:33,487
Eisenhower ordered British General
Bernard Montgomery to clear them out.

95
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,287
That would have taken weeks,

96
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:39,247
and Montgomery proposed
a daring alternative

97
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:43,047
designed to speed the Allied advance
into Germany -

98
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:46,247
Operation Market Garden.

99
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:49,887
First, American and British
airborne troops

100
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,647
would be dropped behind German lines

101
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:56,567
to seize bridges along a 65-mile highway

102
00:07:56,567 --> 00:08:00,607
from Belgium, through Holland,
to Arnhem.

103
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:04,487
Then the British Second Army
would race along that highway,

104
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:06,527
cross the Rhine at Arnhem,

105
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,207
go around the northern end
of the Westwall

106
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:11,527
and drive into the Ruhr Valley,

107
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:14,758
the centre of German industrial might.

108
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:21,087
For the risky plan to succeed,

109
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:24,682
everything had to go perfectly
and quickly.

110
00:08:26,687 --> 00:08:29,767
Eisenhower thought
the gamble was worth it.

111
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:33,887
If it did succeed,
the war could end in weeks.

112
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:38,915
"I not only approved of Market Garden,"
he said later, "I insisted on it."

113
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,087
On Sunday, September 17,

114
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:29,287
1,481 C-47 transports took off
in broad daylight from 24 British airfields

115
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:32,199
with 20,000 paratroopers on board.

116
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:40,887
Towed behind the transports
were hundreds of CG-4A gliders

117
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:43,927
carrying men and matériel.

118
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:47,807
Let's talk about the combat glider -
the CG-4A.

119
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:49,967
An 85-foot wingspan.

120
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:53,447
It would carry a ton and a half -
3,000 pounds -

121
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:55,607
plus the two pilots up front.

122
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:57,598
(DISTANT EXPLOSIONS)

123
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,847
But they were flying coffins. (Laughs)

124
00:10:01,847 --> 00:10:04,287
There was no return.

125
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:08,927
So, the idea was to get your
people down or get your load down,

126
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:10,447
whatever it is,

127
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:14,567
and then become an infantryman,
which is what we became.

128
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,647
Harry Schmid, of Sacramento,

129
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:20,567
had been studying accounting
when he was drafted in 1942,

130
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:24,007
and first planned to become a medic.

131
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:29,447
But then, he said, he didn't want to
change bedpans for the whole war,

132
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:32,247
and volunteered to become a pilot.

133
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:35,487
When his weak eyes
kept him out of a fighter cockpit,

134
00:10:35,487 --> 00:10:40,047
he settled for flying a glider
with the 82nd Airborne instead,

135
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:44,006
and found himself part
of Operation Market Garden.

136
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:49,687
Captain Dwain Luce, of Mobile,

137
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:52,687
was also on his way to Holland
aboard a glider.

138
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:55,047
The father of two small children,

139
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:57,367
he had left his family's cannery business

140
00:10:57,367 --> 00:11:00,687
to join the 82nd Airborne
when the war started,

141
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:03,567
and had survived Sicily and Italy

142
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:06,525
and 33 days of fighting in Normandy.

143
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:13,527
MAN: I got out over the North Sea there,
and that pilot had a parachute on.

144
00:11:13,527 --> 00:11:16,727
I told him, I said, "Look, you might
as well take that parachute off

145
00:11:16,727 --> 00:11:19,007
"because you're not
leaving here without me."

146
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:25,927
And I said, "Now, you get your ass shot,
who's going to land this thing?"

147
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:27,447
He says, "You are."

148
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:32,407
SCHMID: Too fast a speed
with a CG-4A will kill you,

149
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:35,087
because you're talking about
a fabric airplane

150
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:37,767
with nothing but little aluminum struts.

151
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:40,567
And these guys come in at
90 miles an hour

152
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,286
and crash into something,
and, boy, they just disintegrate.

153
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:59,327
In all my combat missions,

154
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:02,047
I never came in at more
than 50 miles an hour.

155
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:05,807
I took the chance of getting hit
by ground fire and flak,

156
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:08,887
but I wanted to get my people down
and get down on the ground.

They're all going down so slowly.

170
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:54,561
It seems as though they should
get to the ground much faster...

171
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:10,367
Things went well at first.

172
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:13,643
Dutch citizens poured into the streets
to greet the Americans.

173
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:26,527
The 82nd Airborne,
including Harry Schmid and Dwain Luce,

174
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:30,447
seized three bridges near Nijmegen,
then dug in

175
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:35,047
and waited for the British armour to
race up from Belgium and relieve them.

176
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:39,687
The 101 st Airborne took
four bridges near Eindhoven,

177
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:44,807
and when the Germans blew up a fifth,
managed to rebuild it overnight.

178
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:47,719
They too waited to be relieved.

179
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:53,487
But when the 10,000 men
of the British 1 st Airborne

180
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:56,727
came down seven miles from Arnhem,

181
00:13:56,727 --> 00:14:01,278
the Dutch crowds that turned out
to greet them slowed their advance.

182
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:07,407
Only 500 of the soldiers

183
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:10,717
managed to reach the
all-important bridge across the Rhine.

184
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,567
Meanwhile, word of the Allied plan
had fallen into enemy hands,

185
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,567
and by the end of the day,

186
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:24,207
German panzers had surrounded
the outnumbered British at Arnhem.

187
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:26,198
(GUNFIRE)

188
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:43,847
Bad weather delayed airborne
reinforcements for several days,

189
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:48,407
and when a parachute brigade
of Free Poles was finally dropped in

190
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,477
it was shot to pieces.

191
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:15,767
The British armour

192
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:19,047
that was meant to meet up with
the paratroopers on the ground

193
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:21,847
and then spearhead
the advance into Germany

194
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:25,362
soon found itself under attack
from enemy artillery.

195
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:33,007
Smashed tanks and vehicles
caused massive traffic jams

196
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:34,804
that took hours to clear.

197
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:40,927
SCHMID: The idea of the whole mission,
of course, was to control the bridges

198
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:42,804
while Montgomery came up
with his tanks.

199
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:49,527
Well, they shot him all up, and he didn't
get there for seven days. (Chuckles)

200
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:51,647
So we were in the front lines
all that time.

201
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:57,404
We were not attacking the enemy,
but we were defending perimeters.

202
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,527
This was not the way
it was supposed to go.

203
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:07,367
Harry Schmid, Dwain Luce
and the men of the 82nd Airborne

204
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:10,327
found themselves struggling
just to hold on,

205
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:13,000
with no tanks and no heavy weapons.

206
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:18,447
SCHMID: And they had two ways
of going after you.

207
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:23,127
They'd either do shells that exploded on
the ground or they used air bursts.

208
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:25,207
(EXPLOSIONS)

209
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:26,687
You worried about those air bursts,

210
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:30,127
because they would... they would burst
about 20 feet above you,

211
00:16:30,127 --> 00:16:32,047
and there was just shrapnel everywhere.

212
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:35,960
And just a little piece of shrapnel could
hit you, you know, and you're gone.

213
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:43,047
LUCE: They had better weapons,
in many cases, than we did.

214
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:45,407
You're talking about their 88s.
They were great weapons.

215
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:47,887
Very high velocity.

216
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:52,527
They were so damn fast that the bullet
got there before the sound did.

217
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:55,407
It was "Zip, bang!" you know?
Man, it just...

218
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:59,400
It was a terrible weapon to...
We all dreaded the 88s, I guess.

219
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:20,927
SCHMID: And when you're in a mission
where you're behind enemy lines,

220
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:25,207
you worry because
nobody knows anything.

221
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:27,847
You don't know whether the Germans
are coming or they aren't coming.

222
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,927
And that's probably the thing
that mentally bothers you,

223
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:33,282
is that you don't know what's going on.

224
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:38,927
As the Americans held their ground
near Nijmegen and Eindhoven,

225
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:42,367
the surrounded British at Arnhem
were being slaughtered.

226

(GUNFIRE)

227
00:18:07,407 --> 00:18:12,807
Finally, after nine long days,
Montgomery abandoned his plan,

228
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:16,083
and ordered the survivors
to withdraw by boat.

229
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:25,483
Market Garden had been the largest
Allied airborne operation of the war...

230
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:29,199
...and the most disastrous.

231
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:36,247
17,000 Britons and Canadians,
Americans and Poles

232
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:40,207
were killed or wounded or captured

233
00:18:40,207 --> 00:18:42,084
before the operation was abandoned...

234
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:49,323
...more casualties than the Allies
had suffered on D-day.

235
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:57,487
LUCE: You don't like
to see what you see. No.

236
00:18:57,487 --> 00:19:00,007
You don't like to see what you see.

237
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:05,727
I mean, it's very disquieting to...
have your friends... gone

238
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,687
and some of them
pretty terribly mauled and things.

239
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:15,887
And... but that's part of it.
War is not a pleasant activity.

240
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:19,927
And you kind of need to keep
your sense of humour a little bit

241
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,963
to get through it.

242
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:29,927
The Allies had won themselves a
narrow 65-mile corridor across Holland,

243
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:32,527
but the rest of the British
and American troops,

244
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:35,167
including Dwain Luce and Harry Schmid,

245
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:38,447
had to stay where they were to hold it,

246
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:43,282
battling the deepening cold as well as
the relentless German shelling.

247
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:48,395
They would be left there for weeks.

248
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:55,247
LUCE: As a boy, I spent
a good time in the woods,

249
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:59,527
and I think my experiences with that
helped me survive,

250
00:19:59,527 --> 00:20:04,407
and I think the little man upstairs
had his hand on my shoulder.

251
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:08,327
And I got hit once, across the helmet.

252
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:10,087
And it didn't penetrate my helmet,

253
00:20:10,087 --> 00:20:12,367
but it'll make you change
your underwear, if you have any.

254
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:14,801
But that's the only time I got hit.

255
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:23,887
No, it's... it's kind of like
a bad dream, I guess.

256
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:25,607
Wouldn't want to do it again.

257
00:20:25,607 --> 00:20:27,802
Nope. Couldn't do it again, I don't guess.

258
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:36,163
It was clear now that the war in Europe
would not end before winter.

And when he shot down

266

and the Japanese pilot
would hold his hands to his face

267

and the blood would come
out of his fingers,

268
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:24,603
we would jump up and cheer
because the good guys were winning.

WILSON: The big change
that the war brought for me

272
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:01,923
was I was a businessman
at the age of 10.

273
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:08,202
I was a 'Bee' carrier managing my
own money, managing my own route.

274
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:12,767
And what did I do
with my first pay cheque?

275
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:16,927
I went and bought a cardboard replica
of a.30 calibre machine gun

276
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:19,567
and went home and put it up in a tree
in the backyard

277
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:22,957
and made believe I was
mowing down the enemy like that.

278
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:27,200
That was my contribution
to the war effort.

279
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:31,847
And we all played war to a certain extent,

280
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:37,167
but it's interesting the way we
played war, because nobody ever died.

281
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:42,527
If you got shot, somebody
came to your aid and fixed you up,

282
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,995
and then you could rise up
and shoot again.

who had worked at
the US Rubber Company in Naugatuck.

286

They had a daughter,
born while Soden was in training,

00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,607
and he had been home to see her
just once

before leaving for France
in the summer of 1944.

to lead a patrol across the Moselle River,

00:23:28,447 --> 00:23:30,127

He had his 'million-dollar wound',
his ticket home, he told a friend,

00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:40,327
and was carried to a barn
where he was to receive treatment.

00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:57,807
Instead, his 1 st Marine Division
was sent to Pavuvu,

334
00:26:57,807 --> 00:27:01,887
a remote island so small
that when the men drilled,

335
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:06,407
one outfit had to march clockwise
and the next counterclockwise

336
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:08,637
to keep from blocking the only road.

337
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:14,007
Sitting on his cot one hot afternoon,

338
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,087
Phillips was surprised to see
a familiar figure -

339
00:27:17,087 --> 00:27:20,602
his best friend from Mobile,
Eugene Sledge.

340
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:26,607
PHILLIPS: I saw him coming down
the company street, looking intense.

341
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:30,077
I recognised him and ran out,
screamed his name.

342
00:27:31,687 --> 00:27:34,847
And we ran and beat on each other
and embraced

343
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:36,527
and rolled around on the ground.

344
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:39,527
People thought we were fighting
and a big crowd gathered.

345
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:45,247
But then I introduced him around,
and it was just a great day.

346
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,727
20-year-old Eugene B. Sledge

347
00:27:48,727 --> 00:27:51,607
was the grandson
of Confederate officers.

348
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:54,447
Bookish and frail as a child,

349
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:58,727
he had been taught to fish and hunt
by his physician father

350
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:01,967
and was a freshman
at the Marion Military Institute,

351
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:03,967
studying to become an officer,

352
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:07,801
when he decided to sign on
as a private in the Marines instead.

353
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:15,167
He told his anxious parents
that if he waited for graduation,

354
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:17,362
he might not get a chance at combat.

355
00:28:19,327 --> 00:28:26,287
WOMAN: Eugene Sledge was just
an ordinary young man.

356
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:30,287
He was full of pranks and full of tricks,

357
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:34,007
and he and my brother Sidney
pulled every one of them

358
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:35,647
that they possibly could.

359
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:38,687
But they were such great friends

360
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:44,087
that what one did,
the other one followed suit.

361
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:47,447
He was a very gentle man,
as my brother Sidney was,

362
00:28:47,447 --> 00:28:53,687
to be thrown into
the middle of a fight like that.

363
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:57,327
Not long after Sledge
got to the Pacific,

364
00:28:57,327 --> 00:29:00,647
he began keeping
an unauthorised journal,

365
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:03,407
slipping tiny sheets of notes
between the pages

366
00:29:03,407 --> 00:29:05,567
of the small New Testament he carried

367
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:08,877
so that no-one else would know
what he was doing.

368
00:29:10,847 --> 00:29:14,167
Years later, those uncensored notes
would form the basis

369
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:19,321
of a harrowing memoir
of his experiences in the Pacific.

370
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:27,087
MAN: "The awesome reality that
we were training to be cannon fodder

371
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:31,007
"in a global war that had already
snuffed out millions of lives

372
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:32,759
"never seemed to occur to us.

373
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:36,807
"The fact that our own lives
might end violently

374
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:40,447
"or that we might be crippled
while we were still boys

375
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:43,487
"didn't seem to register.

376
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:47,087
"The only thing that we seemed
to be truly concerned about

377
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:51,487
"was that we might be too afraid
to do our jobs under fire.

378
00:29:51,487 --> 00:29:55,047
"An apprehension nagged at each of us

379
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:59,087
"that he might appear to be yellow
if he were afraid."

380
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,487
Eugene Sledge.

381
00:30:01,487 --> 00:30:04,327
PHILLIPS: He had come in
as a replacement,

382
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:09,927
and I was being rotated home because
I had been overseas over two years.

383
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:16,207
I certainly did think about what
he was facing, because it was all bad.

384
00:30:16,207 --> 00:30:18,167
Every campaign was bad.

385
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:22,087
Some were a little quicker
and a little worse than others,

386
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:26,047
some were under worse conditions
than others,

387
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:32,919
but they were all bad, and I knew
he was going to face some hard times.

388
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,487
In late August of 1944,

389
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:43,287
Sledge and 16,458 other men
of the 1 st Marine Division

390
00:30:43,287 --> 00:30:48,680
left Pavuvu for the Palau Islands,
more than 2,000 miles away.

391
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:54,287
The marines were headed
for the tiny island of Peleliu,

392
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:58,487
where the Japanese
had constructed an airfield.

393
00:30:58,487 --> 00:31:01,887
It was only 550 miles east of Mindanao,

394
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:05,727
which was to be the first stop in
General Douglas MacArthur's campaign

395
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:09,087
to recapture the Philippines.

396
00:31:09,087 --> 00:31:13,842
MacArthur wanted Peleliu
put out of action to protect his flank.

397
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:20,607
But as Eugene Sledge and his fellow
marines steamed toward their target,

398
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:24,687
playing poker and sunbathing
on the deck to fill the time,

399
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:26,678
Allied plans changed.

400
00:31:29,607 --> 00:31:32,327
After the decisive American victory

401
00:31:32,327 --> 00:31:35,287
in the Battle of the Philippine Sea
the previous June,

402
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:37,287
Admiral William Halsey

403
00:31:37,287 --> 00:31:40,962
no longer considered the
Japanese air force a serious threat.

404
00:31:43,087 --> 00:31:47,160
The Peleliu airfield
had become largely irrelevant.

405
00:31:50,047 --> 00:31:54,207
But no-one cancelled the invasion
of the island.

406
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:58,166
Halsey was sure it would take
only four days to secure it.

407
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:03,087
For three days,
the navy bombarded Peleliu.

408
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,078
(EXPLOSIONS)

409
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:14,602
The foliage that blanketed
its jagged coral hills was burned away.

410
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:19,085
The coral itself was bleached white
by phosphorus.

411
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:26,404
Finally, the officer in charge told his
superiors, "We have run out of targets."

412
00:32:28,327 --> 00:32:30,795
It was time to send in the marines.

413
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:36,007
MAN: "It was hard to sleep
that night before the invasion.

414
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:40,167
"I thought of home,
my parents, my friends,

415
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:46,927
"and whether I would do my duty,
be wounded or disabled, or be killed.

416
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:52,647
"I concluded that it was impossible for
me to be killed, because God loved me.

417
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:55,687
"And then I told myself
that God loved us all

418
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:57,287
"and that many would die

419
00:32:57,287 --> 00:33:00,687
"or be ruined physically or mentally
or both

420
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,757
"in the days following.

421
00:33:07,007 --> 00:33:10,443
"My heart pounded,
and I broke out in a cold sweat.

422
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:15,007
"Finally, I called myself
a damned coward

423
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:17,965
"and eventually fell asleep
saying the Lord's Prayer to myself."

424
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:25,367
(EXPLOSIONS, GUNFIRE)

425
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:30,927
The invasion of Peleliu began at dawn
on September 15, 1944.

426
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:33,327
At 6:30 in the morning,

427
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:37,087
Sledge and his comrades
clambered into their amtracs

428
00:33:37,087 --> 00:33:39,282
and started for the island.

429
00:33:41,327 --> 00:33:46,959
"The world was a nightmare of flashes,
violent explosions, snapping bullets.

430
00:33:49,647 --> 00:33:53,087
"Up and down the beach,
a number of amtracs were burning.

431
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:56,607
"Japanese machine-gun bursts
made long splashes on the water,

432
00:33:56,607 --> 00:33:58,882
"as though flaying it
with some giant whip."

433
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:11,327
Three marine regiments -
more than 5,000 men -

434
00:34:11,327 --> 00:34:13,807
went ashore side by side

435
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:17,687
and quickly discovered that the
bombardment had done little damage

436
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:21,327
to the carefully prepared warren
of 500 fortified caves

437
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,847
and concealed gun emplacements,

438
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:26,767
some equipped with sliding doors
of armoured steel,

439
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:30,442
that honeycombed the coral ridges
running up the centre of the island.

440
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:40,002
The Japanese poured fire down upon
Eugene Sledge and his fellow marines.

441
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:48,407
"I turned my face away
and wished that I were imagining it all.

442
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:52,247
"I had tasted the bitterest
essence of war,

443
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:55,247
"the sight of helpless comrades
being slaughtered,

444
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:58,444
"and it filled me with disgust."

445
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:05,807
Willie Rushton, also from Mobile,
was on the beach too,

446
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:08,487
now a member
of the 11th Depot Company.

447
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:11,447
And then the first day
we went in there,

448
00:35:11,447 --> 00:35:14,647
those people they just...
they slaughtered us marines

449
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:17,647
like we were just a bunch of hogs
coming in the slaughter pen.

450
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:20,487
The Japanese were some
tough customers.

451
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:24,687
They really could fight. They come
at you with everything they had.

452
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:27,527
So, we marines, we were just as tough
or tougher than they were,

453
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:31,076
so we always - well, almost -
came out on top.

454
00:35:33,127 --> 00:35:36,127
The Americans lost 1,200 men,

455
00:35:36,127 --> 00:35:41,804
but they clung to the beach and some
began fighting their way inland.

456
00:35:47,447 --> 00:35:50,087
Eugene Sledge was a mortarman.

457
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:52,767
He fired round after round
into the enemy

458
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:55,839
while riflemen advanced ahead of him.

459
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:10,287
He and his regiment managed to make it
all the way across the narrow island,

460
00:36:10,287 --> 00:36:14,087
then dug in for the night.

461
00:36:14,087 --> 00:36:20,367
No-one slept, for fear that Japanese
infiltrators would slip into their lines

462
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:22,005
and slit their throats.

463
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,207
"It was the darkest night I ever saw.

464
00:36:26,207 --> 00:36:31,804
"The overcast sky was as black as the
dripping mangroves that walled us in.

465
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:37,487
"I had the sensation
of being in a great black hole

466
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:41,321
"and reaching out to touch the sides
of the gun pit to orient myself.

467
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:50,247
"Slowly, the reality of it all
formed in my mind -

468
00:36:50,247 --> 00:36:52,044
"we were expendable.

469
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:56,087
"It was difficult to accept.

470
00:36:56,087 --> 00:37:01,087
"We come from a nation and a culture
that values life and the individual.

471
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:06,527
"To find oneself in a situation
where your life seems of little value

472
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:08,518
"is the ultimate in loneliness."

473
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:18,047
The next morning, the marines were
ordered to assault Japanese positions

474
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:20,967
in the cliffs that overlooked the airfield.

475
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:23,847
Tanks and artillery would go first,

476
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:27,127
then the infantry and Sledge
would follow,

477
00:37:27,127 --> 00:37:31,962
charging across the exposed
gravel airstrip to attack the high ground.

478
00:37:34,447 --> 00:37:38,247
The temperature neared 100 degrees.

479
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:40,477
There was no shade.

480
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:46,767
The only water available, hauled up
from the beach in 5-gallon cans,

481
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:51,047
turned out to be fouled by diesel oil.

482
00:37:51,047 --> 00:37:54,047
Scores of men collapsed
from heat exhaustion

483
00:37:54,047 --> 00:37:56,880
before the signal was given.

484
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:03,767
As the marines - four battalions
and 1,800 men - moved forward,

485
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:06,679
the enemy opened up
with everything they had.

486
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:20,127
"I clenched my teeth,
squeezed my carbine stock,

487
00:38:20,127 --> 00:38:25,927
"recited over and over to myself, 'The
Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

488
00:38:25,927 --> 00:38:28,607
"'Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

489
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:32,156
"'I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.'

490
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:40,847
"The further we went, the worse it got.

491
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:44,167
"It seemed impossible that any of us
would make it across.

492
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:50,487
"To be shelled by massed artillery
and mortars is absolutely terrifying,

493
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:56,005
"but to be shelled in the open
is terror compounded."

494
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:04,047
Sledge somehow made it
across the airstrip safely,

495
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:07,087
and took what shelter he could
beneath a bush.

496
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:09,567
He was "shaking like a leaf", he wrote,

497
00:39:09,567 --> 00:39:12,487
but took comfort from the fact

498
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:15,727
that a veteran of the fighting
on Guadalcanal, crouching nearby,

499
00:39:15,727 --> 00:39:17,718
was shaking too.

500
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:31,487
Japanese tactics had changed
since the beginning of the war.

501
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:34,127
Suicidal banzai charges,

502
00:39:34,127 --> 00:39:37,367
like those on Guadalcanal
and Tarawa and Saipan,

503
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:40,167
were largely a thing of the past.

504
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:44,927
Instead, Peleliu's 10,500 defenders

505
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:50,081
would contest every inch of the island
from their hillside strongholds.

506
00:39:52,687 --> 00:39:57,158
They would have to be blasted
or burned out of them, one at a time.

507
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:00,921
(GUNSHOT)

508
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:04,727
"Even before the dust had settled,

509
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:08,247
"I saw a Japanese soldier appear
at the blasted opening.

510
00:40:08,247 --> 00:40:12,247
"He drew back his arm
to throw a grenade at us.

511
00:40:12,247 --> 00:40:14,287
"My carbine was already up.

512
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,087
"When he appeared,
I lined up my sights on his chest

513
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:18,967
"and began squeezing off shots."

514
00:40:18,967 --> 00:40:21,687
(GUNFIRE)

515
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:26,047
"As the first bullet hit him,
his face contorted in agony.

516
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:28,047
"His knees buckled.

517
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:31,119
"The grenade slipped from his grasp.

518
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:37,687
"I had just killed a man at close range.

519
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:41,607
"That I had seen clearly the pain
on his face when my bullets hit him

520
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:43,367
"came as a jolt.

521
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:47,565
"It suddenly made the war
a very personal affair."

522
00:40:51,607 --> 00:40:55,287
Willie Rushton was in the thick of it too.

523
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:57,087
He wasn't supposed to be -

524
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:01,567
his outfit was assigned to just
unload supplies and ammunition.

525
00:41:01,567 --> 00:41:03,887
But when the fighting started,

526
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:08,407
he and some of his friends volunteered
for front-line duty.

527
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:10,247
RUSHTON: But we were right there

528
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:12,687
where the fighting was going on,
you know.

529
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:16,847
They was just knocking us off
as we came forward.

530
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:18,847
That's what they were doing -
knocking us off.

531
00:41:18,847 --> 00:41:21,087
They didn't make no... whether
you was black or white or whatever -

532
00:41:21,087 --> 00:41:23,555
they didn't care
when you got into combat.

533
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:35,687
15 members of Rushton's
depot company were hit.

534
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:40,767
He was one of them,
wounded in the leg by shrapnel.

535
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:43,807
He was carried to a hospital ship
offshore,

536
00:41:43,807 --> 00:41:47,687
the only wounded black man aboard.

537
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:52,927
After his wounds were treated
he asked if he could have a haircut.

538
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,887
The ship's barber refused.

539
00:41:55,887 --> 00:42:01,087
When I got up there, he told me,
he said, "I can't cut your hair."

540
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:06,487
And so then a couple of white marines
asked him, "Why can't you cut his hair?"

541
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:09,887
Said, "You don't have to give him
no style, just cut his hair off.

542
00:42:09,887 --> 00:42:12,167
"All he wants is some
of that hair off his head."

543
00:42:12,167 --> 00:42:15,087
So he said, "No, I can't.
I can't cut his hair."

544
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:18,087
Then the captain intervened.

545
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:22,487
The captain of the Red Cross ship
came down there and told that barber,

546
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:25,127
"I'm telling you for the first
and the last time -

547
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:28,487
"I don't care who comes on this ship,
if he's an American soldier,

548
00:42:28,487 --> 00:42:30,447
"whether he's black or white
or whatever,

549
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:33,527
"I want you to cut his hair, you know,
just cut his hair.

550
00:42:33,527 --> 00:42:36,047
"Don't ever make a remark like that
anymore."

551
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:40,165
Private Rushton got his haircut.

552
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:59,007
For Eugene Sledge and the other
marines still fighting on Peleliu,

553
00:42:59,007 --> 00:43:03,447
one day, one firefight,
one terror-filled night

554
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,519
now seemed just like the next.

555
00:43:31,287 --> 00:43:35,767
"During a lull, the men stripped the
packs and pockets of the enemy dead

556
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:37,439
"for souvenirs.

557
00:43:39,407 --> 00:43:44,407
"The men gloated over, compared,
and often swapped their prizes.

558
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:47,487
"It was a brutal, ghastly ritual

559
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:50,327
"the likes of which have occurred
since ancient times

560
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,087
"on battlefields where
the antagonists have possessed

561
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:55,442
"a profound mutual hatred.

562
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:04,247
"It was uncivilised, as is all war,
and was carried out with savagery.

563
00:44:04,247 --> 00:44:09,447
"It wasn't simply souvenir hunting
or looting the enemy dead -

564
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:12,678
"it was more like Indian warriors
taking scalps.

565
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:23,087
"While I was removing a bayonet
and scabbard from a dead Japanese,

566
00:44:23,087 --> 00:44:27,687
"I noticed a marine dragging
what I assumed to be a corpse.

567
00:44:27,687 --> 00:44:30,887
"But the Japanese wasn't dead.

568
00:44:30,887 --> 00:44:36,327
"He had been wounded severely
in the back and couldn't move his arms.

569
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:40,967
"The Japanese's mouth glowed
with huge, gold-crowned teeth,

570
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:44,607
"and his captor wanted them.

571
00:44:44,607 --> 00:44:48,087
"He put the point of his KA-BAR knife
on the base of a tooth

572
00:44:48,087 --> 00:44:51,527
"and hit the handle
with the palm of his hand.

573
00:44:51,527 --> 00:44:54,847
"Because the Japanese was
kicking his feet and thrashing about,

574
00:44:54,847 --> 00:45:00,647
"the knifepoint glanced off the tooth
and sank deeply into the victim's mouth.

575
00:45:00,647 --> 00:45:08,367
"The marine cursed him, and with
a slash, cut his cheeks open ear to ear.

576
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:12,487
"I shouted,
'Put that man out of his misery.'

577
00:45:12,487 --> 00:45:16,487
"All I got for an answer
was a cussing out.

578
00:45:16,487 --> 00:45:20,167
"Another marine ran up and put a bullet
in the enemy soldier's brain

579
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:23,207
"and ended his agony.

580
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:28,281
"The scavenger grumbled and continued
extracting his prizes undisturbed."

581
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:47,607
"There were certain areas
we moved into and out of several times

582
00:45:47,607 --> 00:45:52,527
"as the campaign dragged
along its weary, bloody course.

583
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:57,647
"I became quite familiar with the sight
of some particular enemy corpse,

584
00:45:57,647 --> 00:45:59,647
"as if it were a landmark.

585
00:45:59,647 --> 00:46:04,367
"It was gruesome
to see the stages of decay proceed

586
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:06,727
"from just killed, to bloated,

587
00:46:06,727 --> 00:46:12,607
"to maggot-infested rotting,
to partially exposed bones,

588
00:46:12,607 --> 00:46:18,079
"like some biological clock
marking the inexorable passage of time.

589
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:24,527
"On each occasion my company
passed such a landmark,

590
00:46:24,527 --> 00:46:26,324
"we were fewer in number."

591
00:46:35,687 --> 00:46:40,887
"The opposing forces on Peleliu
were like two scorpions in a bottle,"

592
00:46:40,887 --> 00:46:42,567
Eugene Sledge wrote.

593
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:45,639
"One was annihilated,
the other nearly so."

594
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:09,327
After six weeks of combat,

595
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,007
Sledge and the rest
of the 1 st Marine Division

596
00:47:12,007 --> 00:47:13,918
were finally taken off the island.

597
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:18,047
It would be another month

598
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:21,687
before the Japanese commander
finally radioed his superiors

599
00:47:21,687 --> 00:47:26,124
that "All is over on Peleliu"
and then committed suicide.

600
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:36,076
A handful of Japanese would go on
fighting there until February of 1945.

601
00:47:43,087 --> 00:47:47,365
Securing Peleliu was supposed
to take four days.

602
00:47:48,807 --> 00:47:50,843
It took more than two months.

603
00:48:01,047 --> 00:48:07,759
10,000 Japanese were killed - nearly
every man who had defended the island.

604
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:20,487
More than 1,200 Americans perished,

605
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:24,407
including Private John D. New,

606
00:48:24,407 --> 00:48:28,887
who had grown up in Mobile
just across town from Eugene Sledge.

607
00:48:28,887 --> 00:48:32,207
He hurled himself
onto a Japanese grenade,

608
00:48:32,207 --> 00:48:37,167
saving the lives of two friends
but losing his own.

609
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:41,763
For his heroism, he received
a posthumous Medal of Honor.

610
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:51,995
5,274 more Americans
were maimed or missing.

611
00:48:55,847 --> 00:48:59,847
Out of the 235 men
in Eugene Sledge's company,

612
00:48:59,847 --> 00:49:04,557
only 85 left the island
without physical wounds.

613
00:49:06,487 --> 00:49:11,327
And in the end, there had been
no tactical need for the little airfield

614
00:49:11,327 --> 00:49:14,558
for which so many
of Sledge's friends had died.

615
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:23,007
"As I struggled upward onto the boat
with my load of equipment,

616
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:27,367
"I felt like a weary insect climbing a vine.

617
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:32,487
"But at last I was crawling up
out of the abyss of Peleliu.

618
00:49:32,487 --> 00:49:37,487
"I stowed my gear on my rack
and went topside.

619
00:49:37,487 --> 00:49:40,487
"The salt air was delicious to breathe.

620
00:49:40,487 --> 00:49:45,925
"What a luxury to inhale
long, deep breaths of fresh, clean air.

621
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:51,007
"But something in me died at Peleliu.

622
00:49:51,007 --> 00:49:54,767
"Perhaps it was a childish innocence
that accepted as faith

623
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:57,804
"the claim that man is basically good.

624
00:49:59,687 --> 00:50:03,487
"Possibly I lost faith
that politicians in high places,

625
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:06,087
"who do not have
to endure war's savagery,

626
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:09,966
"will ever stop blundering
and sending others to endure it."

627
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:13,520
Eugene Sledge.

628
00:50:23,847 --> 00:50:25,527
Over the coming weeks,

629
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:27,727
on both sides of the world,

630
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:32,437
Allied force would continue
to be undercut by Allied folly.
