00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,360
[The birth of 2NE1 and f(x)!]

3
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:12,940
Both YG and SM debuted new girl groups that showed off their colors in 2009.

4
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,210
They are 2NE1 and f(x).

5
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,270
YG's girl group that debuted in May of 2009 is 2NE1.

6
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:28,750
They were the talk of the town as soon as they debuted with their single "Fire".

7
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:35,120
It was a fresh group that gave a strong impact unlike the current girl groups.

8
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:20,330
[It's a mixture of reggae and hip-hop and the Indian sounding instruments were memorable]

9
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,300
[Their debut song strongly displayed each of their charms and talents]

10
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,010
[When a teaser of the first 20 secs of the song was put up on their official homepage...]

11
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:37,920
[200,000 visited the site in one day and there was much interest before they debuted]

12
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:55,170
They showed they have the potential to make the top and made their presence known.

13
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,140
f(x) debuted in September of that year after 2NE1.

14
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:14,940
They won over many fans with their lively pop dance song, "LA chA TA".

15
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:11,190
[The arrangment is memorable in that it has a hip-hop groove and electronic feel]

16
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,920
[The message of the song is to enjoy life]

17
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,920
["LA chA TA" is an interjection and a coined word that goes with the bright, cheeful song]

18
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,500
This song was more than enough to let everyone know the birth of a new groove.

19
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,340
2NE1 introduces themselves in a special way.

20
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:12,810
[I was influenced to be a singer as I listened to Mariah Carey and Beyonce when I studied in the US]

21
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,250
They showed they are skilled rookies.

22
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,340
They released their 1st mini-album in July two months after their debut.

23
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,050
The title track, "I Don't Care", is a catchy tune with a reggae melody.

24
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,010
Another one of their ambitious projects for summer.

25
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,440
[This is a mid-tempo R&B; pop with a soft reggae melody]

26
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,110
[It has a different feel from their usual songs to go along with summer]

27
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,380
[They topped various music charts and music programs once again]

28
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:23,510
They were at the top again and let all know they are a force to be reckoned with.

29
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:34,570
In November of that year, f(x) released their 1st physical single since their debut.

30
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,220
Their title track is "Chu".

31
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:41,570
[It's a europop dance song with a strong synth sound and bubbly charm]

32
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,620
[It's about the excitement of a girl filled with curiosity]

33
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,710
["Chu" is an onomatopoeia expressing the kissing sound]

34
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,590
[It hooks listeners as it repeats in the first half]

35
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,910
They made the name of f(x) known with sweet kisses.

36
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:38,790
[They have something special]

37
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,150
It wasn't just 2NE1's songs that received attention at the same time as their debut.

38
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:51,750
The never-before-seen unique styles were more than enough to draw attention.

39
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,220
The open box was filled with peculiar accessories.

40
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,540
The mood of every performance is changed with different accessories.

41
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,370
It's my first time putting on something colorful. Isn't it cute?

42
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:22,950
I always put on my airplane ring and Superman ring.

43
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:28,600
I always wear a swimsuit under my pants, but I wore a sleeveless shirt today.

44
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,650
- And... what do you call this?
 - A bandana for the waist.

45
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:40,350
The color of the bandana always changes, and I have it on today.

46
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,350
I wore pants and boots today.

47
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:49,210
I think music and fashion are the same. They're connected.

48
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:56,020
We have to show you everything on the stage such as sights and sounds.

49
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:02,390
So our appearance is very important. Thus, fashion and music are one.

50
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,530
70-80% of what we're wearing right now is our own clothes.

51
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,730
- Really?
 - Yes.

52
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,790
Everything's mine except for the belt.

53
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,330
You look classy.

54
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,660
- Your ring is...
 - Scary, huh?

55
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,880
- It's pointy...
 - There's more here!

56
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,010
- Oh, Bom has...
 - Yes, we love studs.

57
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,560
- It's a bit scary, but...
 - No, I covet them.

58
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:36,040
- Could CL introduce these?
 - In "Can't Nobody" music video...

59
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:42,720
Minzy wore this, but we can't call it clothes.

60
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,870
It's like an armor.

61
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,090
- Like this?
 - Yes.

62
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,100
That's right. Now work it.

63
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,700
Like this?

64
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,030
What's next? My head?

65
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,730
I see... like this?

66
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,730
It's similar to what football players wear...

67
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,470
You look funny, if you wear this.

68
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,140
- Really?
 - Yes.

69
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,310
Take the challenge.

70
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,500
You look good!

71
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,770
Beauty, talent, and individuality.

72
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,270
f(x) is the girl group that has it all!

73
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,960
Hi, we're f(x)!

74
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,470
Nu ABO is very novel. Please explain it to us.

75
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,820
Nu ABO is a coined word for a new fifth blood type.

76
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,250
It expresses the lyrics of our unique love story in a fun way.

77
00:19:52,190 --> 00:20:00,190
If 2NE1's specialty is their style, f(x)'s specialty is their lyrics.

78
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:05,520
The title track of f(x)'s first mini-album in 2010 is "NU ABO".

79
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:55,370
[It's a reverse beat dance song with a simple synth riff and intense drum compilation]

80
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:59,440
[NU is a homophone of "New"]

81
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,920
[It was combined with the blood types ABO to form a coined word]

82
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,640
[They don't follow the existing formula but develop their own way]

83
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:14,740
[They have something special that only they can convey through "NU ABO"]

84
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:21,070
NU and ABO combined to form a coined word. The lyrics were also memorable.

85
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,910
This could be said as f(x)'s own creative lyrics.

86
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,960
f(x)'s own unique lyrics can be found in their other songs.

87
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,010
The lyrics of their songs could also be searched online.

88
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:50,010
Their unique lyrics is one of the things used to describe them.

89
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,510
[It's an electronic pop dance song with intense synth sound and beat]

90
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,940
[It expresses in a fun way how to spend the hot summer]

91
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,810
[f(x)'s bouncy lyrics were memorable]

92
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:13,460
2NE1 releases their first full length album in 2010 showing off a new concept.

93
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:52,930
[The hip-hop rhythm was mostly percussion, but the intense rapping on top of it stood out]

94
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:59,230
[The strong chorus part and their styles gave off the same feel as the song]

95
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:06,290
They had 3 title tracks
 - Clap Your Hands, Go Away, and Can't Nobody.

96
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:10,440
This was unprecedented in the gayo world.

97
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,430
Their triple title track strategy was much loved.

98
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:20,340
Confidence in their music hit it big for them.

99
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:37,750
[It has a strong tempo and shows off their flashy performance]

100
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,050
[2NE1 and f(x)'s keyword]

101
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:12,260
The youngest member of f(x) is the cute Sulli.

102
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,970
Sulli played a role in a period drama.

103
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,490
- When she was young...
 - Really? What role?

104
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,140
It was Princess Seonhwa. I played Lee Bo-young's part as a child.

105
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,220
A princess?

106
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:33,810
[She's so cute!]

107
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:38,200
- Wasn't there a kissing scene?
 - In a period drama?

108
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,140
- I know, right?
 - A kissing scene?

109
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:50,530
I was young and embarrassed to kiss. So I told the director I can't do it.

110
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,570
- How old were you?
 - I think I was 12.

111
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,010
- 12 years old?
 - You were young.

112
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:59,490
- You sure were brazen.
 - It was just acting.

113
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,630
- It was acting.
 - It was a role.

114
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,720
Not as much as you, right Hong Suk-chun?

115
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,200
Yes, I am.

116
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,100
So you were 12 and told the director to remove the scene.

117
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,240
He said to kiss the nose...

118
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,670
He said no one would know so I kissed on the nose.

119
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,790
- With who?
 - It was Kim Suk.

120
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:23,270
- Oh! Kim Suk!
 - Do you know him?

121
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,380
No, but we'll see the video clip soon.

122
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,840
She acted as a child with a very beautiful face.

123
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:38,570
Seems like she listened to the saying, "Grow up as you are." She's still pretty.

124
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:44,370
I'm going to reveal something. It's about Sulli's atrocities.

125
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:49,890
3-4 years ago, she was in the 5th or 6th grade.

126
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,470
5th grade was 3-4 years ago?

127
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,150
Sulli was a trainee and I just entered the practice room.

128
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:05,200
Regardless of age, the date one enters the practice room determines seniority.

129
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,500
6th grader Sulli comes up to me one day and I think she was annoyed.

130
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,960
She said, "Oppa, since I'm your senior, fetch the keys from the 3rd floor."

131
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,460
- Sulli?
 - Yes.

132
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,940
I have something that shows what her mind was like at the time.

133
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,240
- It's her diary.
 - Diary?

134
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,830
- About Me by Choi Jinri.
 - Could you read it?

135
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,680
"I know I'm beautiful, but I don't know why people adore me."

136
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,100
Aren't people like singers beautiful?

137
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,300
There are many in my church that are beautiful. Why do they only adore me?

138
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,290
I hate that about people.

139
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:52,470
I tell them my name, and they say even my name is beautiful. Am I that beautiful?

140
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,200
What should we do with her?

141
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,830
Her diary shows how immature she is.

142
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,250
This is something only the haves can do which is narcissism.

143
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,220
We can't refute her words.

144
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:16,840
Sulli's real name is Choi Jinri, and a well-known sentence was born.

145
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,160
[Sulli is Jinri]

146
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:28,950
[Using Sulli's real name, this is usually used to describe her superiority]

147
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:33,370
Yong!

148
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,780
Yong Hwa oppa!

149
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,900
Hwa!

150
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,780
Your makeup is heavier than mine!

151
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,250
Next is Jo Kwon!

152
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,850
Jo!

153
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,370
I thought you were quiet.

154
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,720
Kwon!

155
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,200
But you're cocky.

156
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,760
She got them both in an instant.

157
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:07,610
Hi, I'm Sulli and I'm the comedian of f(x).

158
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,540
Not only does she have good looks, but she can make jokes.

159
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,470
I have a joke for you.

160
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,240
A dried persimmon and tiger were friends...

161
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,880
A dried persimmon and tiger?

162
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,770
They lined up to have a race.

163
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,910
Shots were fired and the tiger started running.

164
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,660
But the dried persimmon stood still and didn't run.

165
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,540
The tiger ran but the dried persimmon didn't?

166
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,080
"How come you're not running?" What did the dried persimmon say?

167
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,170
Can you guess?

168
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:46,060
- Oh! I'll be there soon?
 - I'll be there soon. Sorry.

169
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:52,040
It's corny but people laughed. This must be the power of Sulli.

170
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,780
Something like, "I'll be there soon."

171
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:01,840
If I told you this joke...

172
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,180
You would get angry.

173
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,320
"Samchons" love Sulli.

174
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,110
I heard that Sulli never met Yang Joon-hyuk privately.

175
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,370
Did you really invite her? What's going on here?

176
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,650
I was asked who I wanted to invite...

177
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:25,320
And Sulli was...

178
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,310
- You picked her?
 - Yes, I did.

179
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,670
You're her fan?

180
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:36,850
I mean she looks like an angel.

181
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:45,130
I want her on my shoulder like Tinker Bell on Peter Pan.

182
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,980
[To that extent?]

183
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,330
You have many "samchon" fans...

184
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,770
- I'm an "oppa", not "samchon".
 - Okay, you're an "oppa".

185
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,970
Aren't they your father's age?

186
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,090
- Well, my mom is...
 - What about your mom?

187
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,270
My mom is 42.

188
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,220
- Your mother is 42?
 - She's friends with me then.

189
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:14,810
He's an "oppa" who's the same age as your mother. He's a great "oppa".

190
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:27,190
Do you have anything prepared for your "oppa" fan?

191
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,660
- A dance.
 - A dance?

192
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,450
Without music?

193
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,960
- There's music.
 - Alright!

194
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:43,220
[f(x) is known for "NU ABO"]

195
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,130
[Cute like Tinker Bell!]

196
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,310
[Very pleased]

197
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,270
It's hard for young people to do that before older people.

198
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,420
She's not saying it, but she must be terrified.

199
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,170
She must've been nervous before she came here.

200
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:15,830
Tiffany asked, "Who's your favorite girl group?"

201
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,740
Tiffany asked that? My favorite is f(x).

202
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:24,080
Oh? You too?

203
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,830
Jinri? Yes, Sulli is Jinri.

204
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,460
What's charming about her?

205
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,430
Sulli's innocence is like Kang Suji of the 90s...

206
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:40,610
Both her names are correct. Sulli will always be Jinri.

207
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,570
2NE1 always put on a powerful performance with strong music.

208
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:52,990
But they showed off their matured charm with an ardent song.

209
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,070
[Their charming voices and polished beats stand out]

210
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:04,810
[Other than the title track of their 1st mini-album, this song was also loved]

211
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:12,580
They sing about love, but YG gave a special command
 - dating ban.

212
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,770
[Dating Ban]

213
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:22,920
[Usually given to idols prohibiting dating while active as singers]

214
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,530
- I think he caught us.
 - Guess he's a fisher.

215
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:32,100
The dating ban was for 3 years so it should be lifted on May 17th.

216
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,530
But he went back on his words.

217
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:41,140
He told us no even though the date passed. I don't know what to do.

218
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,180
- It was a promise.
 - I know.

219
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,540
You should date if you're 29.

220
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:54,860
Because he ties them down, they could leave every night.

221
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,680
- You surprised me there.
 - Because he ties them down.

222
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,180
That means they did go out.

223
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,180
Sometimes I didn't see them.

224
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,080
- We met up with each other.
 - Yeah, we went out together.

225
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,790
I saw them together.

226
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,490
[The truth is getting lost...]

227
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:19,710
[I forgot how to date]

228
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:27,080
[I completely forgot how]

229
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,820
[YG... please let us go...]

230
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:42,460
As they said, "YG, you're mean!" At least, let go of the two oldest.

231
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,630
It's based on a true story.

232
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:53,760
Lonely Dara has a secret. Let's listen to the story told by her labelmate.

233
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:01,520
She's in her late 20s and how can she not have a guy when she's pretty?

234
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,570
I tried to ease her lonliness.

235
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,650
So I introduced her to her first man.

236
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,780
For real?

237
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,190
First means there wasn't only one?

238
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,860
Yes, there's more.

239
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:21,110
I introduced her to the first guy, and she really liked him.

240
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:26,770
I'm not sure if he introduced him to me or not because he called.

241
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:32,060
I asked what happened and he told me to wait and I'll get a call today.

242
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,780
I waited but didn't get any calls.

243
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:39,830
I heard nothing. I didn't hear anything about them calling each other.

244
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:45,180
I thought maybe he wasn't the one and introduced her to the 2nd guy.

245
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,260
- Guy No. 2.
 - Yes.

246
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:56,080
He sways many women's hearts in Korea and is Lee Seung-gi style.

247
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,770
He must have forgotten, but he called me again.

248
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:05,640
I said hello and CL got a strange premonition.

249
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,480
She took the phone from me, spoke with him and hung up.

250
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,020
She took care of it.

251
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,560
- Why did she do that?
 - I mean, then...

252
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,380
He called and everyone knows he has a loud voice. He was like, "Noona!"

253
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,470
I had a strange premonition and told him to hang up.

254
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,800
- He was going to introduce a man?
 - Yes, I had that feeling.

255
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,970
Why did you do that?

256
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,760
- Umm...
 - He didn't do it for you.

257
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,300
I introduced Guy No. 3.

258
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,920
He was really determined.

259
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,640
In front of Dara's house...

260
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,320
- In front of her house?
 - This is it!

261
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,420
He waits in front of her house for her to come out.

262
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,600
Dara, is this true?

263
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,420
I haven't confirmed it but heard that's how it was.

264
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:10,200
He mustered up the courage and went on that cold day, but you trampled on his heart.

265
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,530
Why didn't you go out when he was waiting for you?

266
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:20,420
I was afraid. He was enthusiastic, but I didn't know if he knew me.

267
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,550
I'm bright and cute on air...

268
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:31,360
Her labelmates want her to be happy. Let's wait and see if the ban gets lifted.

269
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:03,280
[We Are the Best!]

270
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:13,950
2NE1 releases their 2nd mini-album in 2011. Starting with Bom's solo, "Don't Cry"...

271
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:19,980
They had a unique promotion by releasing each track in the album as singles.

272
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,420
[It's a fast tempo R&B; dance song with piano melody and house beats]

273
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,270
[3 weeks before promotion of their album, they released each track one by one]

274
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:34,610
[The first song released was Bom's solo, and her unique voice was charming]

275
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:50,610
Just one performance of "Lonely", released as a single, it became the mutizen song.

276
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:37,200
[This song shows off 2NE1's charming voices]

277
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,530
[It's a slow pop song that harmonizes their unique voices, guitar sounds, and strings]

278
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:49,640
[Unlike their other songs, an analog feel stands out in this]

279
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:54,180

280

[Rappers CL and Minzy were able to show their charms with singing]

281
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:20,690
"I Am the Best" topped music charts as soon as it was released.

282
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,620
They solidified their place as the best girl group.

283
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:00,870
[It has a fast beat that's electronic and hip-hop]

284

[Main features are the uniquely strong sounds and suggestive title exuding confidence]

285
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:26,480
All of these songs were in their 2nd mini-album.

286
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:35,630
We can see in "Ugly", the title track, their charm in singing various genres.

287
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,840
[It's an uptempo song with electronic rock sounds]

288
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,710
[Contrasting that is the sad feeling within]

289
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:57,910
[The hurt they received due to their ugly looks and how people view them were expressed]

290
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:01,730
[It showed their rich emotions]

291
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:48,040
f(x) also has a song in 2011 that they can't forget.

292
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,050
It's "Pinocchio", the title track of their first studio album.

293
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:57,710
Not only did they top the music charts with this electronic pop dance song...

294
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,300
They were at the top in music programs for the first time since their debut.

295
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:50,000

The process of knowing love was alluded to Pinocchio...

300
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:49,020

[2NE1's Minzy, f(x)'s Victoria]

303
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:23,030
Out of both male and female idols, Minzy gives a powerful performance.

304
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:30,700
As the great-granddaughter of Gong Ok-jin, her blood must be flowing in her as well.

305
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,300
Erotic Minzy!

306
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,280
I'm curious about that.

307
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,210
- This made a huge impact.
 - Can you explain?

308
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:13,120
I participated in various contests and competitions since the 6th grade.

309
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,260
I won a set of ribs and many other prizes, but every time I performed...

310
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,590
Eroticism was hidden inside.

311
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,710
Eroticism in dancing?

312
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:30,710
Everyone agrees and says that there's something erotic inside of Minzy.

313
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,810
We are witnesses to that. We always see her.

314
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:40,620
Every time she dances, her looks, eyes and movements are sexy.

315
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:47,100
Before our debut, YG gave her a sexy ban.

316
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:52,650
He said, "Don't forget that you're the youngest."

317
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,730
- She's born in 1994.
 - She's only 16.

318
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:05,610
Other than a powerful performance, she can make any dance look sexy.

00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,950
- Can you split them today?
 - Yes, I can.

331
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,990
Please show us.

332
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,830
Minzy can also do the splits. My legs hurt just watching.

333
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:08,460
If 2NE1 has Minzy, f(x) has Victoria.

334
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,990
She has an amazing form since she studied dancing. I'm amazed every time.

335
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,400
Go back.

336
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,410
Be careful.

337
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,940
One, two, three!

338
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:37,490
Is she human or a swan? Victoria showed off her flexibility.

339
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,750
She's drinking while doing the splits. Don't be shocked. She is human.

340
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,360
Since when were you flexible?

341
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,460
Since I was born.

342
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,360
- Do fingers count too?
 - Of course, fingers count.

343
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:00,600
How is that possible?

344
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:05,440
Makes a living by doing splits. What do you mean by that?

345
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,990
I can do splits because I'm very flexible.

346
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:12,930
Yes, we saw.

347
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,890
How far down can you go?

348
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:22,800
I attended Beijing Dance Academy.

349
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:29,080
If she got into the best dance school in China...

350
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:32,360
- It's hard to get in.
 - How old were you?

351
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:38,520
I was in the 5th grade. I told my mom I have to get into that school.

352
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:43,350
I went and the instructor told me to give my leg.

353
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:46,270
It's not give your hand but give your leg?

354
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:54,320
Raised my leg all the way here. I thought, "What's going on?"

355
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:59,650
My leg was now to the side and raised all the way up.

356
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:04,940
"That's it." Then I asked, "What were you doing?"

357
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:09,620
Next, I was told to bend backwards.

358
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:14,430
- So I bent backwards.
 - You were flexible from birth?

359
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:18,140
I bent backwards.

360
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,060
Like a folder?

361
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,700
Not like this but like this?

362
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:31,400
When I sleep, I'm in a split position.

363
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,200
You sleep in that position?

364
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:39,910
That's hard to take. That means your leg is where our arm would be.

365
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:48,340
She could use her leg as a pillow.

366
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:55,700
When I first joined SM, I couldn't speak Korean well since I'm a foreigner.

367
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:01,110
I used honorifics to everyone including Sulli.

368
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:03,170
Sulli's the youngest.

369
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:08,890
I would say, "Good night," using honorifics.

370
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:17,140
Sulli must've been terrified because she's courteous but sleeps like this.

371
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,240
And then?

372
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:23,510
One day, I was sleeping comfortably since I was tired.

373
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:41,050
I was in a split position over the bed with my eyes open towards Sulli's direction.

374
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:50,910
I was sleeping with my eyes open, and Sulli came over, "'Unni', are you awake?"

375
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:57,670
With my eyes open, I replied, "Huh? What?"

376
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:03,650
Sulli said, "You scared me! I thought something happened."

377
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:07,550
Afterwards, we got close.

378
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:11,090
We don't need words. Just show it to us.

379
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,550
- Hello, Victoria.
 - Hello.

380
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:21,460
We'll start the test. Give me your leg.

381
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,000
Raise it up.

382
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,600
Good.

383
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,900
To the side.

384
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,980
Good.

385
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,470
Backwards.

386
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:44,600
- Bend backwards?
 - Yes, just go down.

387
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:52,260
Victoria, you pass!

388

389

390
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,240
"Unni"!

391
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,830
What's up, Sulli?

392
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:16,090
Are you awake or...?

393
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:22,330
- I was sleeping.
 - Why were you...

394
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:29,530
Victoria's flexibility showed she's a human folder. That's some talent.

395
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,780
- He's from "Star King".
 - Oh, no! We're late.

396

The rap she does in her special voice is also special.

413
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,740
Would Amber try?

414

Umm... I'm not sure...

426

We have another one.

428
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:24,510

01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:07,710
- What else?
 - Idiot Bom.

502
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:12,110
Oh! My head...

503
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:17,490
The man who covered my mouth.

504
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:20,060
[What does it mean?]

505
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,750
What did he cover it with?

506
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:25,740
Maybe it was with bread.

507
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:27,800
[Since she's Bread Bom!]

508
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:37,070
It's YG. He tells me to be silent and that I'm an A-bomb when I go on air.

509
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,140
Did you make a mistake?

510
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:48,450
When I debuted, I filmed a cell phone commercial with Hyori and Joon-gi.

511
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:56,850
There was a press preview and a reporter asked what kind of cell phone we used.

512
01:10:56,850 --> 01:11:03,960
Hyori said she's using Any___ and Joon-ki said he's switching to Any___.

513
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,750
Everyone was laughing.

514
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:10,170
Since they're modeling for that cell phone.

515
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:13,220
I thought I should be funny too.

516
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:20,370
I was honest and said that I used a Cy__.

517
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:27,390
Hyori's face was like this and Joon-ki didn't know what to do.

518
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:31,040
I thought the reaction was great and I felt good.

519
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,730
- You thought the reaction was great?
 - Yes because they were laughing.

520
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:37,020
Because Lee Hyori was like this?

521
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:42,100
I deluded myself. I thought YG would compliment me.

522
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:48,640
He said, "Idiot! You're clumsy and don't do anything right!"

523
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:55,450
He scolded my manager, "You should have bought her one in advance!"

524
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:03,070
But I got in trouble again that same day.

525
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:09,660
After the press preview, Hyori asked, "Bom, why don't we have dinner together?"

526
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:17,460
I was on a diet program and had to fit into a midriff by agency standards.

527
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:23,360
I said no to her.

528
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:28,050
I said I'm on a diet and left.

529
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:34,850
Joon-ki said to me, "Lee Hyori wants to eat with you. Are you joking?"

530
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:41,750
- I was proud of myself.
 - Since you kept your promise.

531
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:49,250
I proudly told that to YG and he got angry.

532
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:52,770
- "You're an idiot!"
 - Why was he angry?

533
01:12:52,770 --> 01:13:00,490
"Do you think Hyori wanted to go yum-yum with you?"

534
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:04,750
"She just wanted to spend time." He got angry.

535
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:10,150
Why did Lee Hyori ask you? Was there something she liked?

536
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:16,720
Maybe she liked me after I caused that trouble.

537
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:27,690
When I exited, she patted me and said, "It's okay. It's because you were innocent".

538
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,770
Maybe it was to scold you.

539
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:35,680
What do you think, Dara?

540
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,320
She's doing very good.

541
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,480
But she's more fun at the dorm without cameras?

542
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:47,220
Yes, it's a hundred, thousand times more fun than this.

543
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,810
- She's more funny?
 - Yes.

544
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:52,240
- Sometimes...
 - It's okay.

545
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,740
I can't say it.

546
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,530
What is it?

547
01:13:57,530 --> 01:14:00,650
It's so fun sometimes we think she's crazy.

548
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:13,050
f(x)'s voice is Luna, their main vocalist.

549
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,840
Luna is the "Queen of Reaction".

550
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:23,490
Luna is different off stage. She's the "Queen of Reaction".

551
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:28,550
[That's how it's done]

552
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:32,260
Now it's an emotional moment.

553
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,770
"Honey, I love you."

554
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:39,980
[Star King
 - variety show academy!]

555
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:47,650
Not only is she the MC on SBS MTV's "THE SHOW"...

556
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:52,310
To all the female viewers, I'm sitting on top of Dong-joon.

557
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:55,010
It is I, Luna, vitamin MC of THE SHOW.

558
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:57,310
- Don't gauge my weight.
 - Alright, I won't.

559
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:01,930
He's not shaking but doing well.

560
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:06,270
[Luna
 - f(x)'s vitamin girl!]

561
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:09,240
What will you show us?

562
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,250
I'm in a musical, Legally Blonde...

563
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:15,570
She made a surprise transformation as an actress in "Legally Blonde".

564
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:26,320
[Solid skills from four months of performing]

565
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:34,590
[Now the acting begins!]

566
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,360
[Elle Woods' boyfriend left]

567
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:45,860
[A clear and cool musical voice]

568
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:46,780
[Luna's friends]

569
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,440
[Elle Woods grew up on her own to be acknowledged by her boyfriend]

570
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:04,890
[She grew up even more overcoming the pain of having an image as a muscular idol]

571
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:12,340
[Going beyond being an idol, she takes on variety shows and musicals]

572
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:19,720
[All will be well]

573
01:16:22,530 --> 01:16:25,330
[An explosive voice!]

574
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:31,330
[This show is cooler than before because of vitamin girl Luna!]

575
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:38,540
There's another actress in f(x) and it's none other than Sulli.

576
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:46,080
In 2012, she cut her hair to play the role of a boy in the drama "To the Beautiful You".

577
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:59,050
- It's raining. Why are you here?
 - Because it's raining.

578
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:14,230
Sulli of "To the Beautiful You".

579
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:21,770
She received the New Star Award in 2012 for her role in that drama.

580
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:26,440
We look forward to this new star's future both as a singer and actress.

581
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:31,450
Hi, I'm Sulli.

582
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:34,990
Thank you for this award.

583
01:17:34,990 --> 01:17:41,210
I thank Director Jun Ki-sang and the staff of "To the Beautiful You".

584
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:46,130
I thank my family that's watching this on television right now.

585
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:50,920
I'll continue to try hard. I also thank my fans.

586
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,130
- Thank you.
 - Congratulations.

587
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:07,810
[Their glorious stage goes on]

588
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:19,540
f(x) showed an energetic and rhythmical stage with an electronic pop dance song.

589
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:47,040
[It's an electronic pop dance song with an addictive chorus part]

590
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:52,560
[Starting off with drum beats, such energetic and rhythmical melody is memorable]

591
01:18:52,560 --> 01:19:00,520
[The feeling of falling in love is compared to the electrifying feel of being electrocuted]

592
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:04,730
[They started each line of the word "electric shock" in Korean]

593
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:08,990
[They showed off their own special lyrics once more]

594
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:16,980
[They topped all music programs and this song solidified their place]

595
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:41,600
Now we expect something different when it's f(x).

596
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:46,360
We already look forward to their next stage to satisfy that expectation.

597
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:55,610
2NE1 makes another musical transformation with an electronic trot, "I Love You".

598
01:21:55,610 --> 01:22:01,430
This song was born from their wish to spread Korean culture.

599
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:44,850
[Trot was exquisitely fused to electronic music]

600
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:50,230
[It's an experimental dance song also known as electropop]

601
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:57,560
[This song honestly portrays a woman's heart longing for love but is an amateur in love]

602
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:05,210
[They take on trot and a song on confession for the first time since their debut]

603
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:12,460
[It contains their wish of wanting to show their fans around the world the most Korean song]

604
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:30,740
2NE1 gives birth to their own music as they always worry over music.

605
01:25:30,740 --> 01:25:35,650
We look forward to their ever- changing and evolving music.
