for our final visit
to our homes.

4
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:07,247
This was around the middle
of April, 1944.

5
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:09,847
So I went up to Luverne

to see my parents,
my brothers and sisters.

7
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:20,007
And it was a very difficult
time because I knew...

8
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:22,567
I had the orders
in my possession

9
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:24,447
that would be sending me

10
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:28,127
to the European Theatre of Operations,

11
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:30,247
and I knew that we
had been assigned

12
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:36,567
to fly this terribly dangerous
type of combat mission.

13
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:39,207
So...

14
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:42,247
when I was leaving

15
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:45,007

to my mother and dad,

16
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:49,127

My sister Mavis was with me,

19
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:59,127
and I took her aside and
we walked down the platform

20
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:03,325
for a ways and I told her
what my assignment had been...

21
00:02:05,447 --> 00:02:06,927

were pretty great

to be very much aware
of this possibility

25
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:22,247

on both sides of the world,

46
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:02,406
there were signs that the tide
of war had begun to turn.

47
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:09,527
The Allies had stopped Japan's
expansion in the Pacific.

48
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:12,447
They had taken Guadalcanal
in the Solomons

49
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,847
and Tarawa in the Gilberts,

50
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:19,127
had savaged the enemy
fleet at Midway

51
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:22,647
and had begun the long climb
from island to island

52
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,717
toward the Japanese homeland.

the Allies had
cleared North Africa

were flooding into Britain.

00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:30,207
"Key executives don't stir
very far from a telephone,

178
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,247
"day or night.

179
00:12:32,247 --> 00:12:34,727
"The belief is
that the long-awaited flash

180
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:39,323
"will come sometime after 11:00pm
but before 5:00am."

00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,677
(DRUM BEATS SLOWLY)

183
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,047
PAUL FUSSELL:
We tend to call it the real war.

184
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:12,402
The rest of it's
just the showbiz war.

185
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,567
The real war involves getting
down there and killing people,

186
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:21,927
and being killed yourself
or just barely escaping it.

187
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:26,727
And it gives you attitudes
about life and death

188
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:29,480
that are unobtainable
anywhere else.

189
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:39,767
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
Soldiers, sailors and airmen

190
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:42,047
of the Allied Expeditionary Force,

191
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:46,527
you are about to embark upon
the great crusade,

192
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:49,564
toward which we have striven
these many months.

193
00:13:51,727 --> 00:13:54,844
The eyes of the world
are upon you.

194
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,727
The hopes and prayers of
liberty-loving people everywhere

195
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:03,719
march with you.

196
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:15,247
NARRATOR: The greatest invasion
in history began just after midnight

197
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:18,647
on June 6, 1944 -

198
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,527
D-day -

199
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,487
as the first
of 24,000 paratroopers,

200
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,167
flown over the Channel
in more than 1,000 aircraft,

201
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:30,125
were dropped behind enemy lines
in Normandy.

202
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,687
The Germans' theory of
the defence of the Continent

203
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:40,207
was they put, they built
pillboxes along the coastline

204
00:14:40,207 --> 00:14:42,567
and they put
their old troops in it.

205
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:45,927
Then they put their,
their Panzer divisions

206
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,327
and their SS divisions
and their good divisions

207
00:14:49,327 --> 00:14:51,327
back in central points,

208
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:53,567
the theory being that
when we hit the beach,

209
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:56,727
they would come in from
those points and drive us off.

210
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,327
Our job was to get in between
them and the beach

211
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,761
and to have them hit us
instead of the beach.

212
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:11,327
NARRATOR: Most of the men of the
British 6th Airborne dropped on target,

213
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,647
reassembled, and within an hour
had achieved their objectives,

214
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:18,807
seizing bridges across
the Orne and Dives rivers

215
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:21,807
to keep German tanks
from mounting a counterattack

216
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:23,847
along the coast.

217
00:15:23,847 --> 00:15:26,327
On the western flank,

218
00:15:26,327 --> 00:15:29,967
the 16,000 Americans
belonging to the 101 st

219
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:33,847
and 82nd Airborne divisions
were less fortunate.

220
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:37,527
Low-hanging clouds
blocked the moonlight

221
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:40,007
and obscured the landing zones.

222
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:42,207
The narrow neck of
the Cotentin Peninsula

223
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,927
was hard to hit from the air.

224
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:48,927
Many paratroopers fell
helplessly into the sea.

225
00:15:48,927 --> 00:15:51,367
Others landed in fields
and river valleys

226
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,519
flooded by the Germans
and drowned.

227
00:15:57,327 --> 00:16:01,247
Some were blown from the sky
as German tracer bullets

228
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:05,767
set off the explosives
they carried.

229
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:08,367
Still others were dropped so low

230
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,167
their parachutes
had no chance to open.

231
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:13,247
They hit, one man remembered,

232
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:15,367
with "a sound like ripe pumpkins

233
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:18,325
"being thrown down
against the ground".

234
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:29,047
The men of the 101 st Airborne
were scattered over an area

235
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:32,926
25 miles long by 15 miles wide.

236
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:45,887
Elements of the 82nd Airborne
came down in and around

237
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:48,127
the little town
of Sainte-Mère-Église,

238
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,207
just behind Utah Beach.

239
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:54,367
The fighting was already raging

240
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:58,447
when a glider carrying
Dwain Luce of Mobile, Alabama

241
00:16:58,447 --> 00:17:00,199
headed toward the landing zone.

242
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:05,487
A survivor of the invasion
of Sicily

243
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:08,567
and the landing at Salerno,
he was a captain

244
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:13,447
in the 320th Glider Field
Artillery Battalion.

245
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:15,687
LUCE: We had been in combat before

246
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:18,927
and we knew kind of what
we were getting into,

247
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:22,527
but, uh, we knew this
was the big bang

248
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:27,840
and it was, it was kind of...
worrisome, you might say.

249
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:33,127
NARRATOR: Gliders were
something new in warfare -

250
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:37,367
silent, ideal for clandestine
landings behind enemy lines,

251
00:17:37,367 --> 00:17:40,647
and capable of ferrying
equipment and vehicles

252
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:43,923
too heavy to be dropped
in any other way.

253
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:49,447
But they were also fragile,
covered with flammable fabric,

254
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:52,447
and hard to control.

255
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,887
And in some landing zones,

256
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:58,087
the Germans had placed forests
of sharpened poles

257
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:02,763
to tear them apart
and impale the men aboard.

258
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:08,367
More than half the gliders
missed their drop zones

259
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:12,047
and scores of pilots
and passengers were crushed

260
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:15,327
when vehicles and artillery
pieces slammed forward

261
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,444
during crash landings.

262
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:26,647
LUCE: I remember, in my glider,
I was sitting up next to the pilot

263
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,687
and I leaned over his shoulder
to look at it

264
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:32,047
and we dove over those trees,
we were doing 110 miles an hour

265
00:18:32,047 --> 00:18:33,887
and I thought,
this is no speed to land.

266
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:36,037
But it was too late to change.

267
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:47,767
I fortunately did not land
in front of any antitank guns

268
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:49,598
which were vicious.

269
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:54,207
I had a friend that landed
in front, in front of one

270
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:57,487
and he was cut in half.

271
00:18:57,487 --> 00:18:59,767
And, uh, those are things

272
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,997
you don't like to think about
or talk about.

273
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:09,927
NARRATOR: Dwain Luce somehow
made it out of his glider,

274
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:13,287
and quickly found himself
part of the continuing battle

275
00:19:13,287 --> 00:19:16,359
to hold Sainte-Mère-Église.

276
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:21,327
LUCE: Oh, we had a fight,

277
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,087
and the Germans
moved people in in a hurry.

278
00:19:24,087 --> 00:19:26,407
(MACHINE GUN FIRES)

279
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:30,327
You see, we didn't
have heavy weapons...

280
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:33,842
and we were fighting
heavy weapons.

281
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:50,607
NARRATOR: Surrounded, isolated,
out of communication with one another,

282
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:54,767
Dwain Luce and his unit
struggled to hold their ground

283
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:56,407
and block German tanks,

284
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,887
while they waited
for the landing force

285
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:03,324
to take Utah Beach
and come to their rescue.

286
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,327
LUCE: Whenever we went in
behind the lines,

287
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:11,046
they always gave us,
ah, morphine.

288
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:17,647
The morphine was a little thing
like a toothpaste tube

289
00:20:17,647 --> 00:20:23,247
except it had a sharp, ah, point
when you unscrewed it, you know,

290
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:25,487
and you could then stick
the needle and break it

291
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:27,159
and then you pop it in your arm.

292
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:33,007
We were back there where if
you got... really got hit bad,

293
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:35,885
nobody could take care of you.

294
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:42,047
Sainte-Mère-Église,
it was a mess.

295
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:44,402
Terrible.

296
00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:55,647
AANENSON:
Early in the morning

297
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:58,327
we were awakened
from our bunks -

298
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:00,527
about 25 or 30 of us -

299
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:04,567
at the air base that was
just above London,

300
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:08,047
and we were told to
get in our flight gear

301
00:21:08,047 --> 00:21:10,487
and meet in the briefing room.

302
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:17,287
And so we assembled in there,
just barely awake,

303
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:20,047
and we knew
it was something serious.

304
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:23,607
We could tell
by just the atmosphere.

305
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:27,607
There were two or three briefing
officers up at the front.

306
00:21:27,607 --> 00:21:32,727
They had a large map
that was covered,

307
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:38,007
and as we took our seats and
they pulled the curtain back,

308
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:42,847
they said,
"Gentlemen, this is it.

309
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:45,327
"The invasion of France
has begun."

310
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:48,767
NARRATOR: At 4:30am,

311
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:52,087
Quentin Aanenson of Luverne
took off for France

312
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:56,239
as part of the flight
of 11,000 warplanes.

313
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:01,207
Lightnings and Lancasters
and Liberators,

314
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:03,767
Mosquitoes and Marauders
and Mustangs,

315
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:08,047
Spitfires and Thunderbolts
and Flying Fortresses,

316
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:12,687
assigned to bomb and strafe
and batter German defences

317
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:15,406
before the first troops
landed on the beaches.

318
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:28,196
It was Quentin Aanenson's
first combat mission.

319
00:22:29,847 --> 00:22:33,927
As we came in over Normandy
I looked off to the left,

320
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:35,767
and it was just a short look,

321
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:38,804
and I realised later
I was looking at Omaha Beach.

322
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:14,407
We had to be very careful
of our timing,

323
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:17,927
and we had to be very careful
that we didn't go inland too far

324
00:23:17,927 --> 00:23:21,007
because the paratroopers
had been dropped in there.

325
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:24,047
And we didn't know exactly
where they were.

326
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:27,517
And as it turned out they didn't
know where they were either.

327
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:41,597
NARRATOR: Aanenson dropped his
bombs and headed back to England.

328
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:46,527
AANENSON:
It was a mixture of some clouds,

329
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:49,407
but we could see down
into the Channel

330
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:53,007
and it was impossible
to understand

331
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:54,647
really what we were seeing.

332
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:56,638
There were ships everywhere.

333
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:15,007
MAN: "The best way I can describe
this vast armada

334
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:17,087
"and the frantic urgency
of the traffic

335
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:21,407
"is to suggest that you
visualise New York Harbor

336
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:24,207
"on its busiest day of the year

337
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:28,207
"and then just enlarge
that scene until it takes in

338
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:30,927
"all the ocean

339
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,406

"And over the horizon.

"There are dozens of times

342
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:44,323
Ernie Pyle.

343
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:06,607
NARRATOR: More than 5,300 ships,
carrying 176,000 men

344
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:08,647
were streaming
across the Channel -

345
00:25:08,647 --> 00:25:12,607
battleships and tugboats,
cruisers and barges

346
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:14,647
and rusty freighters,

347
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:17,287
gunboats and hospital ships

348
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:21,647
and converted ocean liners,
ships filled with ammunition

349
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:24,407
and ships equipped to lay down
screens of smoke

350
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:26,887
to mystify the enemy -

351
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:30,407
and a fleet of more than
2,000 landing craft

352
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:33,524
to ferry men and supplies
to the beach.

353
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:49,767
Joseph Vaghi was assigned to be
a beach master that morning.

354
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:54,327
It would be his job to use
flags, blinkers, and a megaphone

355
00:25:54,327 --> 00:25:57,207
to get men, vehicles
and supplies

356
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:59,482
safely ashore on Omaha Beach.

357
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:05,007
It was his first combat, too.

358
00:26:05,007 --> 00:26:06,727
VAGHl: I had no fear.

359
00:26:06,727 --> 00:26:10,927
We prayed as, as a platoon,
we prayed together.

360
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:13,087
And said, "Well,
it's God's will.

361
00:26:13,087 --> 00:26:14,687
"They want us to go over there

362
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:16,407
"and get this devil
off the thing.

363
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:21,407
"We're gonna do it. We know
what to do, and we're ready."

364
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:26,356
I wasn't scared only because I
had not experienced this before.

365
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:31,207
WALTER EHLERS:
The more you're in combat,

366
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:34,647
the more tension you get
as time goes on,

367
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,127
because the odds are

368
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,167
that you may not be
going to make it

369
00:26:38,167 --> 00:26:40,237
because you've seen so many
other people die.

370
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:47,007
I'd get so sick when
I was going into combat,

371
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:49,207
I'd, until
that first shot was fired,

372
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,127
why I thought I was...

373
00:26:51,127 --> 00:26:53,327
my stomach was going to turn
inside out or something,

374
00:26:53,327 --> 00:26:55,927
but when the first shots went,
all that goes away.

375
00:26:55,927 --> 00:26:59,967
NARRATOR: Among the thousands
of men moving toward the beaches

376
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:02,567
were two veterans
of earlier invasions

377
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:05,087
in North Africa and Sicily.

378
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:07,207
They were from
Manhattan, Kansas -

379
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:10,047
Staff Sergeant Walter Ehlers

380
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,322
and his older brother, Roland.

381
00:27:13,487 --> 00:27:15,767
EHLERS: He was a little bit
shorter than I.

382
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:19,567
He had red hair, and he had blue
eyes and a beautiful smile.

383
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,807
And he was a perfect gentlemen
all the time.

384
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:25,327
And he, uh, he was immaculate
in dress and everything.

385
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:29,161
And he tended to keep
me that way, too. (Chuckles)

386
00:27:48,727 --> 00:27:54,327
NARRATOR: At 6:30am, the invasion
force began landing in Normandy.

387
00:27:54,327 --> 00:27:58,367
Utah Beach came first.

388
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:01,647
Drifting smoke that
obscured the target

389
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:05,287
and strong currents that drove
their landing craft off-course

390
00:28:05,287 --> 00:28:08,727
brought the Americans into shore
more than 2,000 yards

391
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:10,718
from the spot chosen
by the planners.

392
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:14,967
But General
Theodore Roosevelt, Jr,

393
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:18,487
armed only with a cane,
rallied his men

394
00:28:18,487 --> 00:28:21,843
and took the beachhead anyway
in less than an hour.

395
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:28,527
Of the 23,000 men who went
ashore at Utah Beach,

396
00:28:28,527 --> 00:28:31,166
only 197 were lost.

397
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:37,927
By late morning American tanks
were moving off the beach

398
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:41,087
to rendezvous with the embattled
82nd Airborne

399
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:43,157
at Sainte-Mère-Église.

400
00:28:45,447 --> 00:28:48,727
DWAIN LUCE: We were back there
and we didn't know

401
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,647
what was going
on on the beach, for sure.

402
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,807
We knew that the beach
would hold

403
00:28:53,807 --> 00:28:55,407
if we'd have got our job done.

404
00:28:55,407 --> 00:28:59,567
We also knew that
if the beach didn't hold,

405
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,727
we would probably be left there,
we would be abandoned,

406
00:29:01,727 --> 00:29:03,207
they couldn't get us out.

407
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,847
So naturally, it was
of great interest to us

408
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:09,887
to get our job done
and see the beach hold.

409
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:12,407
One of the things
I will always remember,

410
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:13,887
with a great deal of emotion

411
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:15,525
is that first tank
that came through.

412
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:22,087
Because that first tank
came through,

413
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:23,847
I knew the beach had held

414
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:27,078
and I knew help was on the way.

415
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,447
NARRATOR: British troops would take

416
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:48,967
the Gold and Sword beaches
almost as fast,

417
00:29:48,967 --> 00:29:50,807
though German tanks
prevented them

418
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:54,516
from capturing their next
objective, the city of Caen.

419
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:00,767
Canadian troops took Juno, too,

420
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,807
although 90 of their 306
landing craft were destroyed

421
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:07,647
by German obstacles,
and one in every 18 men

422
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:12,084
in their invading force
was killed or wounded.

423
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:17,447
Still, they managed to fight their way
seven miles inland

424
00:30:17,447 --> 00:30:19,244
by nightfall.

425
00:30:27,047 --> 00:30:30,767
But for the Americans in the
1 st and 29th infantry divisions

426
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:32,687
approaching Omaha Beach,

427
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:35,687
the most difficult landing site,

428
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:38,967
almost everything
would go wrong.

429
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:43,647
Omaha was the broadest
of the five beaches,

430
00:30:43,647 --> 00:30:47,687
and the deepest,
with 100 yards of pebbles,

431
00:30:47,687 --> 00:30:52,367
then sand dunes, barbed wire
and thick undergrowth,

432
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:55,967
all of it heavily mined.

433
00:30:55,967 --> 00:31:00,167
Behind all that loomed
formidable bluffs

434
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:03,327
fortified by
2,000 German troops,

435
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:06,478
many of them battle-seasoned
veterans.

436
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:13,447
Stützpunkts, or strongholds,
overlooked the four gullies

437
00:31:13,447 --> 00:31:18,287
that led inland - each manned
by 70 Germans with machine guns,

438
00:31:18,287 --> 00:31:22,007
mortars and armour-piercing
howitzers,

439
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:27,684
all zeroed in on the men
about to try to come ashore.

440
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:35,047
During phase two,

441
00:31:35,047 --> 00:31:39,927
American pilots had dropped most
of their bombs miles inland.

442
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:44,927
There were no bomb craters
in which to take shelter

443
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:48,920
and the naval bombardment had
barely dented German defences.

444
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:16,367
VAGHl: As we are approaching it
we see ships to the right of us,

445
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,047
ships to the left of us.

446
00:32:18,047 --> 00:32:21,767
The skies are loaded with
these flying balloons.

447
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:26,527
The battleships are shooting
and you could see the projectiles,

448
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,887
the 14-inch projectiles
from the battle wagons,

449
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:30,407
going through the air.

450
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:34,567
The smell of powder.

451
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:37,764
We didn't know what we were
gonna hit when we got in there.

452
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:45,407
NARRATOR: Men had been transferred
to their landing craft

453
00:32:45,407 --> 00:32:49,447
12 miles from shore
and while it was still dark,

454
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:54,047
so that many boats lost their
proper positions going in.

455
00:32:54,047 --> 00:32:55,767
The sea was rough.

456
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,767
The men, most of whom
had had no sleep,

457
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:03,204
were wet and cold and seasick.

458
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:09,567
The amphibious tanks that were
supposed to lead the way

459
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:11,887
and provide cover
for the infantry

460
00:33:11,887 --> 00:33:14,887
were released
too far out at sea,

461
00:33:14,887 --> 00:33:20,167
32 tanks rolled off the vessels
that carried them,

462
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:24,167
and all but five went
straight to the bottom.

463
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:28,763
Most of their crews were
trapped inside.

464
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,807
Landing craft were swamped,

465
00:33:34,807 --> 00:33:37,447
scores of men,
burdened with equipment,

466
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:40,687
slowly drowned,
screaming for help

467
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:43,599
as other boats wallowed
past them.

468
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:48,038
Commanders were forbidden
to stop and pick them up.

469
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:57,287
Along the bluffs
the Germans held their fire

470
00:33:57,287 --> 00:34:00,687
until the first landing craft
shuddered to a stop

471
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:03,406
and the ramps went down.

472
00:34:09,687 --> 00:34:12,167
Many men were ripped apart
by German machine guns

473
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:14,887
before they could step off.

474
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,560
Hundreds more were hit
in the water.

475
00:34:19,647 --> 00:34:24,287
Some badly wounded men made it
to the waterline, collapsed,

476
00:34:24,287 --> 00:34:29,600
then lay helpless
as the tide rose over them.

477
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:46,407
Those who managed
to push past

478
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:48,647
the dead and dying
in the shallows

479
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:50,327
found they had nowhere to go

480
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:53,558
once they reached the shore.

481
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:59,967
Some scrabbled at the sand
and shale, trying to dig foxholes.

482
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:03,087
Others huddled together behind
wrecked landing craft

483
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:05,367
or German obstacles -

484
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:09,565
only to find themselves
under concentrated fire.

485
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:17,047
EHLERS: We were about a hundred
yards out and we hit a sandbar.

486
00:35:17,047 --> 00:35:20,247
We asked the pilot of the boat,
"Is this as far as it's going?"

487
00:35:20,247 --> 00:35:22,287
And he says,
"As far as it can go."

488
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,447
So he lets the ramp down
and so we rush out the front,

489
00:35:25,447 --> 00:35:28,647
and we go in the water and it's
clear up to my neck like this.

490
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:31,487
(CONTINUOUS GUNFIRE)

491
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:34,718
But we got all the guys
up onto the beach.

492
00:35:42,927 --> 00:35:47,682
NARRATOR: Joe Vaghi's platoon
came ashore at 7:35.

493
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:51,527
VAGHl: Things happened so fast

494
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:54,807
that you saw men
who were being shot,

495
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:56,287
you saw them fall.

496
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,118
These things you saw.

497
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:02,764
The fact that, uh,
this is for real.

498
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:10,207
NARRATOR: Somehow,
everyone in Vaghi's platoon

499
00:36:10,207 --> 00:36:12,087
managed to make it
onto the beach,

500
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,207
but it remained
a killing zone,

501
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:17,887
choked with shattered
and burning equipment,

502
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:21,207
and desperate men
unable to move inland

503
00:36:21,207 --> 00:36:23,004
or retreat from enemy fire.

504
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:33,967
Far offshore, General Bradley
considered abandoning Omaha

505
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:36,686
rather than sending in
more men to die.

506
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:45,596
Then, the Americans
began to improvise.

507
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:51,607
Commanders defied orders
and risked

508
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:53,127
tearing the bottoms
from their ships,

509
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,247
to bring them within
a thousand yards of the beach

510
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,487
and use their guns
to finally knock out

511
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:02,001
the German pillboxes
and gun emplacements.

512
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:10,607
And on the beach itself,
officers and enlisted men alike

513
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:13,485
began taking their survival
into their own hands.

514
00:37:14,647 --> 00:37:16,127
"They're murdering us here!"

515
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:18,967
One wounded officer
shouted to his men.

516
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:22,487
"Let's move inland and get
murdered there, instead!"

517
00:37:22,487 --> 00:37:24,967
Here and there,

518
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:27,847
individuals got to their feet
and started forward.

519
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:32,407
Then small groups
began to follow.

520
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:34,807
VAGHl: This officer came up to me

521
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:36,487
and saw that I was
a beach master

522
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,607
and I had the power megaphones

523
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:42,047
and he said, "Tell these guys
to get the hell off the beach."

524
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:44,407
So I said, "Got orders here

525
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:47,647
"that you're to get the hell
off the beach now."

526
00:37:47,647 --> 00:37:51,207
The beach master said,
"Well, you follow that path there,

527
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:53,447
"because if you go
to the right or left of it,

528
00:37:53,447 --> 00:37:54,926
"you'll be stepping on mines."

529
00:37:56,887 --> 00:38:00,487
VAGHl: This one soldier, he got up,
and he put a Bangalore torpedo

530
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:04,207
in the, under the barbed
wire, blew a gap in it

531
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:07,324
and said, "Come on, follow me,"
and he led the way.

532
00:38:09,247 --> 00:38:11,767
EHLERS: I rushed my squad
through it.

533
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:13,367
We got off of the beach,

534
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:15,127
and it was probably
the biggest thing

535
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:18,437
I ever did in my life was get
those 12 men off of the beach.

536
00:38:25,847 --> 00:38:28,647
NARRATOR: When the Germans
continued to block the gullies

537
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:30,127
that led inland,

538
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:32,487
the Americans hurled themselves
right at the bluffs,

539
00:38:32,487 --> 00:38:33,967
clambering to the top

540
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:37,357
and attacking enemy positions
from the side and rear.

541
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,647
EHLERS: We went up, right up the hill
into the, uh, trenches,

542
00:38:44,647 --> 00:38:46,807
and we were chasing
the Germans then.

543
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:48,967
We captured four of them
and sent them back down,

544
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,887
and then we got
behind a pillbox

545
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:52,367
and what we didn't kill -

546
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:54,527
some escaped because they
were running from us -

547
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:59,760
but we got that particular
pillbox that day.

548
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:08,287
NARRATOR: By 1:00, after more than
six hours of desperate fighting,

549
00:39:08,287 --> 00:39:11,916
German resistance
had begun to weaken.

550
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:18,007
(EXPLOSION)

551
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:20,727
And as the afternoon went on,

552
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:23,887
combat engineers managed
to clear a safe boat path

553
00:39:23,887 --> 00:39:25,367
through the shallows,

554
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:28,367
bulldozed five new exits
from the beach...

555
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:32,679
and built a road that men and
vehicles could follow inland.

556
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:37,367
35 engineers died doing it.

557
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:12,607
It had been the bloodiest day
in American history

558
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:16,043
since the Battle of Antietam
in the Civil War.

559
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:23,967
Many of the survivors
were in shock,

560
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:26,640
unable to comprehend what
they'd just been through...

561
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:32,044
...unsure of what
they'd accomplished.

562
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:43,041
Some 2,500 American soldiers
lay dead on French soil.

563
00:41:05,607 --> 00:41:10,362
Walter Ehlers's brother, Roland,
was among the missing.

564
00:41:12,607 --> 00:41:15,367
EHLERS: I thought about looking
for my brother, but then,

565
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:16,967
when we looked at that beach,

566
00:41:16,967 --> 00:41:19,727
there were so many things
down on the beach,

567
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,007
it would be like trying
to find a needle in a haystack.

568
00:41:23,007 --> 00:41:25,887
I figured he was either
wounded or in a hospital

569
00:41:25,887 --> 00:41:27,923
and they just didn't
have a record of it.

570
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:52,287
NARRATOR: It would be five weeks
before Walter Ehlers found out

571
00:41:52,287 --> 00:41:54,243
what had happened
to his brother.

572
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:00,798
EHLERS: I never saw him die.

573
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:07,439
He got killed as he was
coming down the ramp on his LCI.

574
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:12,676
His whole squad got, uh,
wounded... or killed.

575
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:18,167
I would of rather come back
without my arms and legs

576
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:20,287
than to come back
without my brother.

577
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,404
That's, uh... that's
what it meant to me.

578
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:41,967
Well, that stayed with me
for over 50 years.

579
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:43,847
I had nightmares about that.

580
00:42:43,847 --> 00:42:45,967
He'd come back every night,

581
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:48,967
and, uh, we'd, he'd
be all neatly dressed,

582
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,167
and smiling
like he usually does,

583
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:54,000
and we'd have a conversation,
and first thing, he'd disappear.

584
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:58,365
Or I'd go to do something
and he'd disappear.

585
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,167
NARRATOR:
In less than 24 hours,

586
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:14,479
the Allies had torn a 45-mile
gap in Hitler's Atlantic Wall.

587
00:43:18,607 --> 00:43:21,838
They had lost far fewer men than
their commanders had expected.

588
00:43:25,847 --> 00:43:30,767
More than 150,000 men
were now ashore in France,

589

and more men and more
equipment and supplies

590

But there were
no further details,

no live radio reports

steadfastness in their faith.

685
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:40,407
They will need Thy blessings.

686
00:49:40,407 --> 00:49:43,717
Their road
will be long and hard...

687
00:49:45,887 --> 00:49:48,007
...for the enemy is strong.

688
00:49:48,007 --> 00:49:51,087
He may hurl back our forces.

689
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:55,247
Success may not come
with rushing speed,

690
00:49:55,247 --> 00:50:00,727
but we shall return
again and again,

691
00:50:00,727 --> 00:50:04,087
and we know that by Thy grace,

692
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:10,196
and by the righteousness of our
cause, our sons will triumph.

693
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:22,717
NARRATOR: The Allies were on
the mainland of western Europe at last.

694
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,079
Hitler was under siege
from two directions.

695
00:50:30,767 --> 00:50:35,158
But the battles that followed would prove
more costly than anyone could imagine.

696
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:45,407
And on the island of Saipan,
in the Marianas,

697
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:47,487
the Japanese were about to demonstrate

698
00:50:47,487 --> 00:50:51,241
how horrific the final campaign
against them would be.
