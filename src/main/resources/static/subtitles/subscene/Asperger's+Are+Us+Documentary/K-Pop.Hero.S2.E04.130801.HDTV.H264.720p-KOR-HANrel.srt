00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,990
T-ara entered the gayo world
in the summer of 2009.

3
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,740
People were familiar with the
six members before their debut.

4
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,920
They debuted with their single "Lies."

5
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:44,270
[It's their catchy debut song with electronic
sounds in a retro style with a repeating chorus]

6
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:51,100
[The album also contains an acoustic version
of the song giving off a different charm]

7
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,610
[The music video that contained each
member's love story made the news]

8
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,500
One young man caught our
attention in their music video.

9
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,480
He's Yoo Seung-ho,
Korea's Little Brother.

10
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,760
Yoo Seung-ho transformed into a tough
guy. With different clothes and a girl...

11
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,320
He revealed his hidden toughness
as the main male character.

12
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,910
He had a kissing scene with Jiyeon
that surprised many women fans.

13
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,540
I didn't kiss at all.

14
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,780
Jiyeon, who was the envy of all,
was actually Seung-ho's fan.

15
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,820
There was a kissing scene.

16
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:22,030
He gets off his motorcycle and
pushes me to the wall...

17
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,820
Please calm down first.

18
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,340
[I like him]

19
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:36,710
I held on to my helmet with one hand
since it was slipping and he bent his head.

20
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,520
- It was as if I was covering the kiss.
- You were just holding the helmet.

21
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,170
People were saying, "What are they
doing? Separate them right now!"

22
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,910
- They thought you were actually kissing?
- Yes. I wouldn't feel wronged if I did it.

23
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,770
But I didn't do it.

24
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:01,570
They were making a fuss and later told us
to do it for real because they need to film.

25
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:06,740
They told us to do it
and we did it.

26
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,890
Was that your first kiss?

27
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,380
It was my first kiss.

28
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,310
Yoo Seung-ho gave your
very first kiss?

29
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:25,760
She debuted and had a kissing scene with
her ideal man. She must be very happy.

30
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,190
[She will never forget that kiss]

31
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,730
Four member group, Secret, appeared
after T-ara in October of that year.

32
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,870
They debuted with "I Want You Back"
and the beginning is a secret.

33
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:48,460
This is when they truly began. Their skills were
verified with a live video before their debut.

34
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,680
[It's a medium tempo pop R&B with
a lovely melody and hip-hop beats]

35

various live videos before their debut]

36

[Their unique singing along the catchy
melody stands out in their debut song]

37
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,750
They're finally on stage but unleashed
their potential in the next album.

[Potential Unleashed - Their Dances!]

39
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,920
"Magic" is the title track of
Secret's first mini-album.

40
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,990
With flashy beats unlike their debut song,
they found favor in the eyes of the public.

41
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,200

in this pop dance song]

42

from when they debuted]

43
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,660
[This song garnered attention due to
their sexy and powerful performance]

44
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,310
The powerful dance gained much interest.
It contributed to getting this song known.

45
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,700
Just following these moves a little
bit will give you a workout.

46
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,880
It created many unforgettable stories.

47
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,110
After filming the "Magic"
music video for 24 hours...

48
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:25,310
We just fixed our makeup and went to
a music chart show without sleep.

49
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,210
I was half awake and said...

50
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:38,360
"I'm tired from filming all night, but I'll
do my best. Please understand."

51
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:45,860
I monitored myself after the
broadcast and that wasn't me.

52
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:55,150
I was slurring. People that didn't know might
think, "What is that drunk girl doing on air?"

53
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,000
People could get the wrong idea.

54
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,910
Even when I saw it, I looked
like a drunk person.

55
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,310
How bad was it? We have that
video clip in our possession.

56
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,590
While the weather was very cold,
I filmed a music video all night.

57
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:20,220
I came all the way here to *#@$
I'm not in a normal state right now.

58
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,120
Look at my pronunciation.
Please understand.

59
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:35,150
It's cold and I'm not in my right mind,
but spring is just around the corner.

60
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:42,500
I promise you a show as fresh as spring.
Once again, I'm not in a normal state.

61
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,280
Please understand just a little...

62
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:52,800
She was drunk with fatigue and not alcohol.
That could happen if you dance all night.

63
00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:00,530
Their performance continued in the title
track of their 2nd mini-album "Madonna."

64
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,070
The four transformed into sexier
Madonnas showing off their dance.

65
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:15,100

sexy and powerful individuality are established.

Here we go. Ready, begin.

76

You have to move your
pelvis and chest.

77

I'll do it if you sing.
Should we do it together?

78

Another thing catches our eyes.

104
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,720
It's the various stage costumes
as if they were doing a cosplay.

105
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:52,430
On our first broadcast, the CEO of our agency
told us to wear these gloves, ears, and tail.

106

- The CEO?
- Yes.

107
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:01,240
We learned the moves without these, but
he gave us these right before we went up.

108
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,040
We were taken aback since we
had to wear these baby things.

109
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:13,840
The one who told them to wear such
cute but difficult props was their CEO.

110

- The CEO himself?
- Yes.

- He likes that?
- Yes.

He's very meticulous. Just before we
go on air, he makes us stand in a line...

115

video call to the CEO.

"I did this and this" and
all the members talk to him.

"It's me, Eunjung..."

118
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:53,220
It passes quickly and after
hanging up, he sends a text.

119
00:20:53,220 --> 00:21:00,110
"Eunjung take off the ears, Hyomin put on one
more glove, move the hairpin from left to right."

"Bo Beep Bo Beep" was also
their debut single in Japan.

interest, but they never made No. 1.

00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:46,740
We stuck foils because there were no
curtains and the walls were moldy.

161
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,540
The snow melted and
it kept on leaking.

162
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,500
- It was leaking from the ceiling?
- We placed a bucket all day long.

163
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,670
There was a completely
broken down kitchen.

164
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:58,980
And the bathroom?

165
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,180
We couldn't use it due to the
low pressure. Even the showers...

166
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,150
- All you did was sleep?
- That place is a jungle.

167
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,820
We only slept. If we need to use
the bathroom, we held it in...

168
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,960
Those who need to use the bathroom
raised their hand and we go to a cafe.

169
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,160
We can't just use the restroom so
we buy coffee and then use it.

170
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,250
Our dream was not to be No. 1
but to escape the basement.

171
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,770
So we gave our all...

172
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:32,650
Since they lived through the basement,
their nickname was basement idols.

173
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:38,360
They could feel upset, but this nickname
made them remember their original intent.

174
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,300
I heard you are hard workers.
It must have been tough.

175
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:50,160
I went to many auditions
and never passed at one try.

176
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:56,390
I went to auditions during vacation
from the 6th grade to the 12th grade.

177
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,910
It was tough. I thought
maybe this wasn't for me.

178
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:05,290
Did you feel you would make it
even though you failed?

179
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,310
They waited a long time until
they stood on stage as Secret.

180
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:13,520
That rankled in the heart
of one of their members.

181
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:19,780
My mom told me to go to Seoul,
but I didn't have the heart.

182
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:27,610
I eventually went and fell asleep,
but I fell into a deep sleep.

183
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:37,820
Someone woke me up. When I saw my
phone, I had more than 40 missed calls.

184
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,470
I went down to Chungju in haste.

185
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:46,440
That day was May 6th, my
younger sister's birthday.

186
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:56,160
On May 7th, the day after her birthday, my
dad removed his oxygen mask at 12:05 AM.

187
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:08,280
When I heard that... he held on because he
didn't want her to be sad on her birthday.

188
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,150
For my dreams,
I don't know why I...

189
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,280
[Regret and tears finally come]

190
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:27,860
I thought why I wasn't there
with him when he passed away.

191
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:34,520
When I arrived in Chungju...

192
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:43,090
When I saw his pale, cold body...
I thought I had to let him go.

193
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:47,290
I held his hand for the last time
and it was cold and hard.

194
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,900
Your father is watching
you with satisfaction.

195
00:34:51,900 --> 00:35:00,600
I can't believe he passed away.
It's as if he's still in Chungju.

196
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,800
The four Madonnas that presented "Magic"
continued on with their transformation.

197
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,910
They made their bashful confession
"Starlight Moonlight" to shy boy.

198
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:44,180
[The heart of a shy girl is
contained in the lyrical melody]

199
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,920
[The lyrics sing of an innocent
love and it goes well with...]

200
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,350
[The retro feeling of the song and
they reached the top once more]

201
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:59,400
[Their dance gained interest again, and
this time it's a baby gorilla dance]

202
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,150
They reached the top again with this
song and made their foray into Japan.

203
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,610
This is amazing. It's like
when we first debuted.

204
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,770
Let's hold back our tears
because I'm getting emotional.

205
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,150
Let's just enjoy it.
One, two, three! Go!

206
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,870
[Even before the album went on sale,
their Japanese fans sing along]

207
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:04,460
We thank all of you today.

208
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,350
During our 3 1/2 years as trainees...

209
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,840
[Hyoseong became emotional as
she thought back to that time]

210
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:19,540
When we debuted in Korea and
when our hearts were broken...

211
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:25,130
We remember the time when we
used to live in the basement.

212
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,460
We won't forget you
that came here today.

213
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,550
Thank you very much.

214
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:43,550
Their Japanese fans were touched by
their heartfelt stage and cried together.

215
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,230
This is what's extraordinary
about the basement idols.

216
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,960
I feel great. It ended successfully.

217
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,870
[Even tears of joy...]

218
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,980
- I feel great.
- I'm excited.

219
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:07,250
I'm happy because I feel that
I'm loved when I meet my fans.

220
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,990
How do you feel?

221
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:12,840
- Our legs ache, but it was fun!
- We feel great!

222
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,310
- Our backs ache, but it was fun!
- Our legs hurt, but it was fun!

223
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,540
She was more realistic.
Act as if you're more hurt.

224
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,380
- Our legs hurt, but it was fun!
- My legs hurt for real now.

225
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,390
This is my cheat sheet.

226
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,630
This is a caldron lid hair.

227
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:41,970
We're a group that always changes,
but we will stay friendly.

228
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,960
They chose to change again.

229
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,260
They made a powerful return with an
intense pop dance song, "Love Is Move."

230
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:30,590
[A pop dance song with memorable
catchy chorus and intense beats]

231
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:36,860
[The exciting melody has a rock and roll
type of beat and it's sort of like a twist]

232
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:40,470
[Their style completely transformed
with flashy outfits and makeup]

233
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:46,340
[A stable live singing despite the intense
moves while wearing heels drew attention]

234
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:39,900
Secret time is fun because they never
lose their color despite the change.

235
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,780
Not only their shining stages, but
each member's story continues.

236
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:14,940
T-ara also revealed their own
unique song the same year.

237
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,200
They chose to go retro.

238
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,210
[Retro]

239
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:29,000
[T-ara showed their strong points in music,
fashion, dance, and so forth in this genre]

240
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:34,440
They initiated the "retro craze" with
their 1980s disco song, "Roly-Poly."

241
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:39,410
[A retro dance song with modern
elements on top of 1980s disco]

242
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:43,860
[Roly-Poly means to get up no
matter how many times one falls]

243
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:51,900
[The stage, style, and the hustle and diamond
dances of the 70s and 80s caused a retro craze]

244
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:58,160
[They conquered the music charts with its
release and was chosen as the song of 2011]

245
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,590
[They later performed in a
musical with the same name]

246
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:45,190
With fashion items and hairdo of the time,
they did a retro dance doing the disco point.

247
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:53,080
Their album, "John Travolta Wannabe,"
reminded people of Saturday Night Fever.

248
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,960
[We don't have time for this]

249
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,340
[This mission almost
became a dance lesson]

250
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,620
[This isn't the time for that]

251
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,800
[Holds the wall and dances]

252
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:35,200
T-ara's own Korean sentiment can be heard in
"Day by Day" including new member, Areum.

253
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:46,050
[The lyrical melody and string arrangement that
went with the flute in the first half stood out]

254
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,170
[It has the slowest tempo
out of all their songs]

255
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:56,330
[Their 16 minute fantasy music video
breaks away from existing conventions]

256
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,980
[They transform into an eight
member group with Areum]

257
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,780
They took moves from the
Bongsan Mask Dance.

258
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:13,700
The unique moves went well with their
song that has the slowest tempo.

259
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:46,260
"Cry Cry" uniquely conveys the sorrow
of parting in a Spanish melody.

260
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:07,990
[A Spanish style song with intense beats and
guitar sounds conveying the sorrow of parting]

261
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:15,490
[Showed both boyish sexiness and androgynous
charm with attractive singing and rapping]

262
00:49:54,570 --> 00:50:02,550
They filled the stage with various
genres being loved around the world.

263
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:11,270
Joanna's from Peru. She's happy and excited
as if on stage. T-ara watches her warmly.

264
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:29,420
Even she looks satisfied.

265
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:41,420
I'm very happy because all
of you watched me dance.

266
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:46,530
Dancing is my favorite and something
I want to do for the rest of my life.

267
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:52,610
Joanna's desperate wish
is great and profound.

268
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:58,600
Even T-ara went through that process.
Thus, her challenge touched them.

269
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:07,170
One thing she respects about Korean culture
is the indomitable spirit of challenge.

270
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:14,820
She learns of the path of challenge
that K-pop artists walked for success.

271
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:23,190
They did a shuffle dance around stage and
changed to clubbers with "Lovey-Dovey."

272
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:27,180
They made everyone dance again.

273
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,910
[A club dance song with strong
beats and electronic sounds]

274
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:22,840
[They wore flashy outfits and props
and did a shuffle dance on stage]

275
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,520
[They became funky clubbers]

276
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:40,330
[She's tired and lies down]

277
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,780
[Tries to get up]

278
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,470
Everyone, are you having fun?

279
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:58,130
Things are heating up here.
We promise you a warm winter.

280
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:02,000
Their distinctness can be known
in their one-day pledge.

281
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,480
T-ara pledged to take the subway if
"Lovey-Dovey" gets the No. 1 spot.

282
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:15,290
Did they follow through?
It looks like they did.

283
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:23,710
As soon as they finished with Inkigayo,
they took the subway to their next spot.

284
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:27,850
They handed out their CD and
rice cakes to the passengers.

285
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:32,520
Both T-ara and the passengers won't
forget that day due to their pledge.

286
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:36,780
Now let's explore their charms.

287
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,940
[Exploring Members' Charms: Secret]

288
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:03,080
[Sunhwa, Jieun]

289
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,590
You're going to impersonate?

290
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:10,310
People say I sound like them
when I do it at the dorm.

291
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:13,070
She's doing it for the first time
on air, but I'm nervous.

292
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,020
First is Lena Park...

293
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:19,480
As the group's main vocalist,
impersonations are a given.

294
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,110
First time getting such a response.

295
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:33,560
Next, while things are good.

296
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,880
- Next is Lyn.
- Alright.

297
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:49,250
- I expected it to be like this.
- Okay, while things are good...

298
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,820
Last is Hwayobi.

299
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,110
I guess that's me.

300
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,820
It's her song time!

301
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:12,100
There was an article where Sunhwa
was first and I was second.

302
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:17,230
That's the official rank, but I was
first in the unofficial rank.

303
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,340
- Wait a minute...
- You have a side job?

304
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,510
This isn't a...

305
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:22,320
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

306
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:28,710
Singers get royalties in
addition to their pay.

307
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:34,550
There's a royalty for voice and chorus.
Usually, singers don't do a chorus.

308
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:41,130
Our agency director made me the
chorus of our group from the start.

309
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:49,370
When "Shy Boy" and "Starlight Moonlight"
became hits, I made a lot for the chorus.

310
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:54,360
Secret's hidden chorus also
increased Jieun's income.

311
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:59,580
With a proven track record, she
released her first solo album.

312
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:05,980
She showed off her special voice in "Going Crazy"
about a woman who can't stand the obsession.

313
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,620
[The piano rhythm is memorable
in this R&B hip-hop song]

314
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:28,100
[It's about a woman who can't bear
a man's obsession towards her]

315
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:34,650
[She sang about it with her unique emotion
and B.A.P's Bang Yong Guk did the rapping]

316
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:41,380
[As Secret's main vocalist, this song
showed her potential as a solo artist]

317
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:07,300
But there was a twist to her.

318
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,680
- She never kissed before.
- No way! For real?

319
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:17,360
I gave a peck but never a kiss.

320
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,670
Then when you sing,
how do you...

321
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:28,670
The composers always point out that I sound
the same whether it's a sad or sexy song.

322
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:31,890
- Does Jieun have aegyo?
- She has a lot of it.

323
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,310
- Her daily life is aegyo.
- Really?

324
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:36,630
- What does she do the most?
- Show them your chair aegyo.

325
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:40,310
- What's that?
- She's 24, but...

326
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:43,350
Every time she sits, she goes...

327
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,000
- She's asking for a chair?
- She's exaggerating it.

328
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,600
I just say that when I sit.

329
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,800
Let's say you're in a restaurant
asking the manager for utensils.

330
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,310
What's wrong Jieun?

331
00:57:56,310 --> 00:58:03,680
She'll meet someone one day who'll raise
her sensibility and watch her chair aegyo.

332
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:08,450
There's another Secret member
who went solo just like Jieun.

333
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:13,550
Sunhwa sang a love song "Everything Is Pretty"
with B.A.P's Young Jae in a surprise duet.

334
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,000
[It's a confession song sung by Sunhwa
and B.A.P's main vocalist, Young Jae]

335
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,140
[Fresh melody and lovely lyrics
fitting a love song stood out]

336
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:54,470
She was on stage before her debut as
a featured singer for another group.

337
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,550
But she has a past
that goes further back.

338
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:27,020
She was on "Super Star Survival."

339
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:31,400
- Let's study together.
- How are you going to teach me?

340
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:35,040
I'll teach you well like a friend.

341
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,760
We might get intimate,
but you're not my style.

342
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,720
Not your style? Should
I sing you a song?

343
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,270
Listen to me!

344
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:47,350
"Jae-yong. Hey, Jae-yong.
Why don't we study?"

345
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:53,220
There's a screen capture of me
that's going around online.

346
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:59,480
This video stirred things up again after her debut
and she was pestered with malicious comments.

347
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:04,960
Everyone thinks my past is strange.

348
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,950
I felt wronged and played out
a self-fabricated scenario.

349
01:00:08,950 --> 01:00:15,470
There's a website where people
post old photos of celebrities.

350
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:23,730
I used my friend's login info
and started a topic.

351
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:31,930
I posted a few pictures of me that are pretty
but not too pretty because I can get caught.

352
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:38,620
I post a few strange pictures among them
and start a topic as if it wasn't me.

353
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:46,760
"I feel sad for singer Han Sunwha.
There's strange pictures of her online."

354
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:53,530
"But I searched and found a lot of pretty
ones." Then I post those pictures.

355
01:00:53,530 --> 01:01:00,320
I think what I wrote was still
online so I brought it today.

356
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,120
- You wrote it yourself?
- Yes with the pictures.

357
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,690
That is long.

[A female idol's self-fabricated scenario!]

359
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,090
"There are many old pictures but
the ones online are all strange."

360
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:19,900
"There are faces that get prettier and
others that get uglier with age..."

361
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:26,110
"But my personal opinion is that
Han Sunwha is getting prettier."

362
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:33,460
I felt bad for her and am
posting some old pictures.

363
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:37,940
"For someone who's taking her
first step for her dreams..."

364
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:42,810
She dealt with it with a self-fabricated
scenario. It's something she would do.

365
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:48,200
Her charms can be seen in
other places as well.

366
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,820
[Powerful temptation]

367
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,690

Can't you stay with me a
little longer? Can't you?

378
01:02:55,990 --> 01:03:01,290
Just one second! Only a second!
Please! Can't you do that?

379

something to tell you!

384
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:50,520
Like what Sunhwa said, a member from
T-ara went into acting and that's Hyomin.

385
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:55,360
I can't stand watching you
with that woman. Get out.

Good day.

387
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:02,230
Sometimes it sucks because
she's little miss perfect.

388
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:06,530
- How could he do that?
- I don't think he can tell...

389
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:10,660
She has an extraordinary past.

390
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:15,790
She was the model for Princess Mimi,
a doll every girl wanted at the time.

391
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:18,270
You didn't know?

392
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:23,370
- She looks so different.
- What? I look the same.

393
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:27,280
I was picked at the 1st

Your chin becomes this big if
you shoot from below, right?

You have to shoot from above
and follow the light like this.

- If this is okay...
- You just know it?

398
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:49,980
You can see your reflection on the
lens. You look at it and say...

Her secret weapon is
the sexy chair dance.

411
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:41,290
There's a T-ara member who holds a grudge
with this dance. It's the minor, Jiyeon.

412
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:46,440
You can't do it because you're
a minor. We'll get caught.

413

All she did was lie down.
A minor can do that too.

414

I want to age quickly
and lie down too.

415

come true on the show?

well. She shows her charms on "Heroes."

Every album by T-ara was a success,
but they faced a big hardship.

434
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:40,730
What they posted on social media became a
controversy and led to a break up rumor.

435
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:49,650
What they posted on social media became a
controversy and Hwayoung left the group.

436
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:54,350
T-ara was on a roll since their debut,
but this was their greatest hardship.

437
01:07:54,350 --> 01:08:03,860
They hinted at their self-relection on air
that they were thoughtless in posting that.

438
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:07,020
They overcame that and
released "Sexy Love."

439
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:13,790

Secret overcame that temptation
and succeeded in losing weight.

But the provocative moves of
"Poison" became a controversy.

451
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:43,230
They had to modify the moves
before going up on stage.

452
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:46,800
There was an unexpected variable.

453
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:53,170
I felt great from losing weight
so I took a picture and posted it.

454

I'm not good at taking pictures.

455

"You're the first girl I
hated for losing weight."

I was tormented if I had
to gain weight again.

I didn't lose that much weight.

462

Yeah, she still has those cheeks.

463
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:29,810
- It's because I take the pictures...
- You have cheeks we can pinch?

464
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:36,950
Because I took it from above,
it came out thinner than usual.

Sunhwa, as a member of the same group,
are you envious of her body or what not?

Only her upper body.
I like my lower body.

467

- No, we didn't have them on.

We thought Hana was unscathed because she
didn't say anything, but she was unconscious.

Her eyes were open, but she
couldn't remember what happened.

01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:59,130
After a thorough checkup at the hospital,
she had a rib fracture and bruised lung.

478
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:01,970
It was hard for her to breathe.

479
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:09,690
Fortunately, nobody was seriously injured,
but it happened at the busiest time...

480
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:12,450
- First day of comeback.
- It must've been hard.

481
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:17,860
It happened during the first
week of our comeback.

482
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:21,580
We were all attached to the album.

483
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:27,270
We thought it was our chance to
plant a new image to the public.

484
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:32,860
We prepared a lot so we were
very disappointed at first.

485
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:41,450
But the sisterly love I felt was great.
I thought of many things as I rested.

486
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:48,970
I thank Hyoseong who helped me
even though her leg hurt...

487
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:52,620
And Sunwha for holding my
hand in the ambulance...

488
01:17:53,690 --> 01:18:03,410
In 2013, they released "YooHoo" from their 4th
mini-album and returned to their cute image.

489
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,770
[It's an exciting synth pop dance
song with cute lyrics and melody...]

490
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:47,980
[Describing the pounding heart when
you see your friend as a man/woman]

491
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:53,530
[Their unique cute feel goes along
with the exciting rhythm and lyrics]

492
01:20:53,690 --> 01:21:00,000
We look forward to their Secret Time that's like
conveying the feeling of someone in love.

493
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:07,710
T-ara returns in 2013 with a
sub-unit called T-ara N4.

494
01:21:12,260 --> 01:21:15,730
"Countryside Life" is the title track.

495
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:21,410
T-ara showed their Korean sentiments again by
grafting Korean classical music to club music.

496
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:07,190
[It's an exciting club dance song
leavened with hip-hop elements]

497
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:10,150
[The lyrics are about breaking away
from the boring everyday life]

498
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:13,860
[The motif of this song is from the main
theme of the drama "Countryside Life"]

499
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:22,540
[Directed by Hwang Ho-joon, Korean traditional
instruments were grafted for a differentiated sound]

500
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,680
Many cheered them on for
taking such a challenge.

501
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,760
Even the legends of the drama
"Countryside Life" gathered.

502
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,950
Choi Bool-am and Kim Soo-mi are together
again after 10 years for the music video.

503
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,130
It's been 10 years since you
dressed up for "Countryside Life."

504
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:12,620
We finished it in 2003, right?
Then it's exactly 10 years.

505
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:18,610
Many celebrities are in it such as the
original sexy singer, Kim Wan-sun...

506
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:20,570
Your eyes are scarier...

507
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,310
Actor Jung Woon-taek...

508
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:27,360
Baseball god, Yang Joon-hyuk...

509
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:31,320
And Kang Minkyung of Davichi
made the music video enjoyable.

510
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,970
Why don't you also give a
congratulatory message?

511
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:36,790
- Are you in there?
- I come out a bit.

512
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:37,690
Then I have to see it.

513
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:41,720
After many hardships, they
dream of taking a new leap.

514
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:49,360
But they announced another sad
parting. Areum left the group.

515
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:59,630
Hello everyone. Even though
I didn't post much online...

516
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:06,340
I felt much love through the
few fan meetings we had.

517
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:13,640
I made many great memories and will
be seeing you soon as a solo artist.

518
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:22,050
Don't forget T-ara since they'll be active
and don't forget me and look forward to it.

519
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,590
Go me and T-ara!

520
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:31,490
Areum left the group to go solo, and
T-ara returned to a six member group.

521
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:36,330
Dani will take Areum's place
in the sub-unit T-ara N4.

522
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:39,260
T-ara went back and forth from
the top and hardships.

523
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:46,350
As they said, we hope to see a matured
and prudent T-ara shine on stage.
