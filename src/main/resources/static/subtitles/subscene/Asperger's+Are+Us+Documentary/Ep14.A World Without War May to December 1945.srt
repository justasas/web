00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:54,447
MAN: The world contains evil.

2
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:57,087
And if it didn't contain evil,

3
00:00:57,087 --> 00:01:01,247
we probably wouldn't need
to try to construct religions.

4
00:01:01,247 --> 00:01:05,287
No evil, no God, I think.

5
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:08,967
No, of course, no evil, no war.

6
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:13,327
But this is not a human possibility
that we need to entertain.

7
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:17,957
There will always be plenty of evil.
And there'll always be wars.

8
00:01:21,127 --> 00:01:25,325
Because human beings
are aggressive animals.

9
00:01:44,127 --> 00:01:46,367
NARRATOR: The hard-won
Allied victory in Europe

10
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:49,967
had delighted Americans back home.

11
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:53,487
But the hundreds of thousands of men
still fighting in the Pacific

12
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:57,196
knew that the war was far from over.

13
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:05,887
Eugene Sledge, of Mobile,

14
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:09,527
who had endured the horrors
of the Battle of Peleliu,

15
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:13,918
would once again be forced to enter
what he called 'the abyss'.

16
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:20,647
Glenn Frazier,
from Fort Deposit, Alabama,

17
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:24,567
who had survived three and a half years
of brutal captivity,

18
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:28,685
would find that the Japanese
were not his only enemy.

19
00:02:35,007 --> 00:02:39,127
And the people
of Sacramento and Luverne,

20
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:41,887
Waterbury and Mobile,

21
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:44,447
and every other American town,

22
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:49,087
knew that there would be
more bad news from the battlefield

23
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,447
before they could dare hope to know

24
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:54,887
what it would be like to live once again

25
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:56,923
in a world without war.

26
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:39,367
HYNES: It didn't really
make much difference on Okinawa.

27
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:43,007
The Japanese were
not going to fight any less hard

28
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:45,157
because Hitler was out of it.

29
00:03:47,247 --> 00:03:52,127
I suppose there was a certain
satisfaction that we'd beaten that lot

30
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:54,887
and could now turn our attention
entirely to this lot,

31
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:59,358
but aside from that,
I don't think there was much excitement.

32
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:21,367
MAN: "Nazi Germany might as well
have been on the moon.

33
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,961
"On Okinawa, no-one cared much.

34
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,167
"We were resigned only to the fact

35
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:34,047
"that the Japanese would fight to
total extinction, as they had elsewhere,

36
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:37,207
"and that Japan
would have to be invaded,

37
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:41,687
"with the same gruesome prospects."

38
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:44,485
Eugene Sledge.

39
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:58,687
The battle for Okinawa
was not going well.

40
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:01,847
The marines had cleared the northern
and central parts of the island

41
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:03,927
by mid-April.

42
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:07,607
But in the south,
the army had been unable

43
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,887
to blast the Japanese from
their main defensive positions,

44
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:16,439
a succession of limestone ridges
around the walled town of Shuri.

45
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,687
The navy, battered daily offshore

46
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:27,167
by Kamikazes
and other Japanese warplanes,

47
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:32,127
demanded that the army undertake
a landing behind the Japanese lines

48
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:36,678
so that they could be attacked
from two sides simultaneously.

49
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:43,527
The army commander refused.

50
00:05:43,527 --> 00:05:48,567
And on 1 May, the 1 st Marine Division,
Eugene Sledge's outfit,

51
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:53,595
was sent south to shore up the centre
of the American line.

52
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,527
MAN: "A column of men approached us

"As they filed past us,
one tall, lanky fellow caught my eye

"He looked at me blankly and moved on."

62
00:06:41,487 --> 00:06:46,356
Japanese shells shrieked down
as the marines struggled to find cover.

63
00:06:56,087 --> 00:07:01,047
Friends died - old friends who had
fought alongside Sledge on Peleliu.

64
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:03,927

"that we rarely saw them on their feet

00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:13,801
"and never got to know their names."

68
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,807
The marines inched
their way toward Shuri,

69
00:07:31,807 --> 00:07:35,167
blasting and burning the enemy
out of their hiding places

70
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,877
one ridge, one village,
one gulley at a time.

"The dream is always the same -

00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:28,682
"going back up to the lines during
the bloody month of May on Okinawa."

79
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:48,567
HYNES: Terrible things
happened at Okinawa.

80
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:55,767
But a man in an airplane above
the battle doesn't see the terrible things.

81
00:08:55,767 --> 00:09:00,367
What I saw was drifting smoke,
explosions.

82
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:03,207
You see destruction -

83
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:07,207
you can imagine the devastation,
but you don't exactly see it.

84
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:12,807
You don't see the dead civilians
who died in their thousands.

85
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:14,927
You don't see the dead Japanese.

86
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:17,361
You don't even
see your own dead.

87
00:09:18,527 --> 00:09:21,567
I dropped some bombs
on buildings that blew up,

88
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:26,367
and if there was anybody in them,
I suppose I killed somebody.

89
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:31,447
I don't know. I'd like to think I didn't.

90
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:35,998
But that's what I was being paid for,
was to kill people.

91
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:48,047
In late May, the Japanese began
a carefully staged withdrawal

92
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,687
from the Shuri line,

93
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:54,247
slipping back 10 miles or so
to their last redoubt,

94
00:09:54,247 --> 00:09:58,843
another series of ridges
at the island's southern end.

95
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:09,567
It would be three more weeks
before its last defenders were killed

96
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,525
and their commanders
committed suicide.

97
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:21,887
By then, 92,000 Japanese soldiers

98
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,721
and as many as 100,000
Okinawan civilians were dead.

99
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:45,287
Of the 235 members
of Eugene Sledge's Company K

100
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:47,167
who landed on Okinawa,

101
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:52,007
just 26 emerged unhurt.

102
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:57,207
Of the 254 men brought in
to replace those who had fallen,

103
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,277
only 24 remained.

104
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,687
In the end,

105
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:10,047
more than 12,000 Americans died,

106
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:12,047
60,000 were wounded -

107
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:16,882
the worst losses of the Pacific war.

108
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:32,847
Among the dead were Private First
Class J.J. McCarthy, of Waterbury,

109
00:11:32,847 --> 00:11:37,087
Sergeant Jeff Fleming, of Sacramento,

110
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,047
Private First Class Lowell Reu,
of Luverne,

111
00:11:41,047 --> 00:11:44,119
and Private Ernest Roy, of Mobile.

112
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:50,967
As the Allies prepared
to move on to Japan itself,

113
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:56,087
still more terrible losses
seemed inevitable.

114
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:08,087
HYNES: We were told that,
in the invasion of Japan,

115
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:14,687
we would be the first land-based
single-engine bombing squadron.

116
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:18,887
To go in, be in on the invasion
of the Japanese home island,

117
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:23,287
that would be heroic stuff -
we all felt that.

118
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:25,207
But at the same time,

119
00:12:25,207 --> 00:12:29,727
by then, our sense of the strangeness
of the Japanese opposition

120
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:32,167
had become stronger.

121
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:35,287
And I could imagine every farmer

122
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:41,967
with his pitchfork coming at my guts,

123
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:47,487
every pretty girl with a hand grenade
strapped to her bottom or something -

124
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,957
that everyone would be an enemy.

125
00:12:54,087 --> 00:13:00,887
The Allies planned to begin with the
island of Kyushu on November 1, 1945.

126
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:06,247
More than 500,000 Japanese troops
were already in position to repel them

127
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:11,719
and another 6 million were either
under arms or ready to be called up.

128
00:13:13,487 --> 00:13:19,437
Women and schoolchildren were drilling
with sharpened bamboo spears.

129
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,647
The Americans did not expect

130
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:28,167
to be able to move against
the larger island of Honshu

131
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,806
until April of 1946.

132
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,487
Former president Herbert Hoover
headed a commission

133
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:39,767
that suggested
half a million Americans might die

134
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:43,167
before the islands could be taken,

135
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:49,087
along with perhaps
7 million more Japanese.

136
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:52,887
Military planners came up
with different estimates,

137
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,927
but all anyone knew

138
00:13:54,927 --> 00:14:00,479
was that the cost in casualties
was likely to be astronomical.

139
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:07,958
The end of the war in the Pacific
still seemed very far away.

140
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:15,807
Gls who had once talked of
"getting home alive in '45",

141
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,967
began to coin new slogans -

142
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:21,527
"Back in the sticks in '46",

143
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,247
"Back to heaven in '47",

144
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:27,796
even "Golden Gate in '48".

145
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:31,967
NEWSREEL: The Soviet Premier,

146
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:36,487
the remaining member of the original
Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin Big Three.

147
00:14:36,487 --> 00:14:39,847
Now President Truman greets
Prime Minister Attlee

148
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:41,847
and the conference
of the Big Three at Potsdam

149
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:45,367
sets the policy of the Allied powers.

150
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:51,567
In mid-July, the Allies met in Germany,
at Potsdam,

151
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:56,567
and set forth the terms under which
they would agree to end the war.

152
00:14:56,567 --> 00:15:01,007
Japan's leaders would have to abandon
every inch of their empire,

153
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:07,687
face trial for war crimes,
submit to being disarmed,

154
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:10,407
and agree to American occupation

155
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:14,286
until a new, democratically elected
government could be established.

156
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:21,007
Unless they agreed to all of it,
the declaration warned,

157
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:26,161
they could expect "the utter devastation
of the Japanese homeland".

158
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:33,807
Japan chose not to respond
to the Allied ultimatum,

159
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:39,287
and tried instead to persuade Russia,
which had never declared war on Japan,

160
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:42,279
to broker more favourable
surrender terms.

161
00:15:44,327 --> 00:15:46,127
For most of Japan's leaders,

162
00:15:46,127 --> 00:15:49,647
despite the agony
the Japanese people were enduring,

163
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:54,047
despite the even greater agony
that seemed sure to come,

164
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:58,404
unconditional surrender
still remained unthinkable.

165
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:09,287
On August 5 on the island of Tinian,

166
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:13,447
a secret object
was placed aboard a B-29

167
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:16,287
named for the mother of its pilot -

168
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:17,959
the 'Enola Gay'.

169
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,562
It was an atomic bomb.

170
00:16:25,007 --> 00:16:28,607
It had originally been intended
for use against the Germans,

171
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:32,407
who had been feverishly working
to make a bomb of their own,

172
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:36,687
but it had not been ready for delivery
before they surrendered.

173
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:41,607
The American bomb had been
developed under such strict secrecy

174
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:46,407
that the new president had never heard
of the project before he assumed office.

175
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:49,727
But once he was told about it,

176
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:53,402
Truman approved the bomb's use
as soon as it was ready.

177
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:12,727
At 8:15 in the morning
on August 6, 1945,

178
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:16,845
the bomb tumbled through
the bomb-bay doors of the 'Enola Gay'.

179
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:29,287
43 seconds later, six miles below,

180
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:32,287
but still high above the city of Hiroshima,

181
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:36,166
it detonated, changing the world forever.

182
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,158
(EXPLOSION)

183
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:02,847
With a single bomb,

184
00:18:02,847 --> 00:18:08,683
40,000 men, women and children
were obliterated in an instant.

185
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:26,924
100,000 more would die within days
of burns and radiation.

186
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:41,607
Another 100,000 would succumb
to radiation poisoning

187
00:18:41,607 --> 00:18:43,438
over the next five years.

188
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:54,327
More than half a century later,

189
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:57,887
citizens of Hiroshima would still be dying

190
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,959
from the bomb's
long-delayed side effects.

191
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:07,927
Despite the devastation,

192
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:13,240
the Japanese still would not accept
the Allied surrender terms.

193
00:19:17,527 --> 00:19:24,007
Then, on August 8,
the Soviet Union declared war on Japan.

194
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:27,795
The islands now faced invasion
on two fronts.

195
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:36,207
At 11:02 the following morning,

196
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:40,837
an American plane dropped a second
atomic bomb, on the city of Nagasaki.

197
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:46,920
Some 40,000 more civilians
died instantly.

198
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:56,807
The Americans
had no more such bombs

199
00:19:56,807 --> 00:20:01,607
and would be unable to produce another
for several months.

200
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:05,680
But the Japanese
had no way of knowing that.

201
00:20:10,487 --> 00:20:15,047
In Tokyo, the Supreme Council
for the Direction of the War

202
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,607
remained split between those
still determined to fight on

203
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:24,007
and those willing, finally, to give up.

204
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:29,607
That evening, all six members
of the council called upon the emperor,

205
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:31,927
who broke the deadlock.

206
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:35,920
Japan would surrender.

207
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:46,167
WOMAN: Everything was set
for the landings in Japan.

208
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:49,287
So when the atomic bomb was dropped

209
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:52,047
and it ended it so quickly,

210
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:55,927
we were stunned but rejoiced.

211
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:57,687
Our boys would come home!

212
00:20:57,687 --> 00:21:01,927
There wouldn't be
any more of them killed.

213
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,007
You can never convince
anyone of my generation

214
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:08,167
that the atomic bomb
was not the greatest thing

215
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,807
that they ever came up with,

216
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:12,807
because we'll defy you.

217
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:18,527
It was just finally
the end of that horrible war.

218
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:24,287
MAN: I had very mixed feelings about it.

219
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:27,279
That the atom bomb...

220
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:35,527
...could be blasted on fellow humans

221
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,607
whose blood is as red as mine,

222
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:43,283
whose skin blisters
as readily as mine does...

223
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:49,687
...was something
I had hoped could be avoided.

224
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:53,047
Of course,
there is the mathematical odds

225
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:55,367
that by killing

226
00:21:55,367 --> 00:22:01,207
some quarter million Japanese

227
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:04,887
we may have saved
half a million American lives.

228
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:07,727
Mathematically, that's a good thing.

229
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:13,962
But it's hard
to give up someone else's life.

For nearly three years,

231
00:22:23,287 --> 00:22:28,047
Glenn Frazier, of Alabama,
had been a prisoner of war in Japan.

232
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:34,167
After the surrender, the guards
at the prison camp simply walked away.

233
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:39,727
Frazier and his comrades wandered out
among the dazed civilian population

234
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:44,801

KATHARINE PHILLIPS:
Well, my dad was so excited,

251
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:04,407
that he ran in the room
and he got his pistol from World War I,

252
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:08,847
and he filled it,
and we went out of the front door,

253
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:11,407
and if you go dig around
that azalea bush,

254
00:25:11,407 --> 00:25:13,607
I know the bullets
are still in the azalea bush.

255
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:20,487
He fired six rounds into the azalea bush,
brought the pistol back in the house,

256
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:23,647
and said to my brother and I,
"Come on, gang,"

257
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,727
and "We're going downtown."

258
00:25:25,727 --> 00:25:28,047
And he threw Mother in the car

259
00:25:28,047 --> 00:25:31,967
and we drove down
to Admiral Semmes's statue.

260

And Daddy circled it three or four times,
honking his horn.

And as we approached the pier,
there - I get a little choked up -

286
00:27:44,887 --> 00:27:52,207
there was the American flag flying high
in the breeze over American soil,

287
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:55,167
and it was the most gratifying thing,

that we would ever get back.

couldn't even say anything,
with tears in our eyes.

303
00:28:54,887 --> 00:28:57,007
So I made my phone call to my home,

304

and the phone was answered
by my mother,

305
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:02,447
and I told her who it was.

306

And, now, I didn't know anything
about all the letters

you know, telling them I was dead.

she fainted and the phone went dead.

and she fainted
when I told her who it was.

came to the phone, and she fainted.

So then there was a long pause,
and my daddy answered the phone.

313
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:31,607
He said, "Who in the world is this?"
And so I told him.

314
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:34,407
And I used my middle name at home -
Dowling.

315
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:35,887
I said, "This is Dowling."

316
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:39,247
And he said, "Well," he said,
"I knew you weren't dead."

317
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:41,927
But he said, "Looks like I've got
a bunch of dead women here."

318
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:44,207
He said, "I've got to get them
up off the floor."

00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:47,927
So he said, "Now, you hold on. Don't
go away, now. I'll be back in a minute."

320
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:50,087
So he goes and gets a pitcher of water

321
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:51,807
and he's pouring some water
in their face.

322
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:54,447
Comes back to the phone and he said,
"I think they're waking up.

00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:56,527
"Their eyes are moving.
Some are moving a little bit."

00:31:11,127 --> 00:31:14,367
to making the screws and washers
and buttons,

338
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:16,567
shower heads and alarm clocks,

339
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:20,207
toy airplanes and lipstick holders
and cocktail shakers

340
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:24,327
they'd been making before Pearl Harbor.

341
00:31:24,327 --> 00:31:30,607
But as the years went by,
the brass industry declined.

342
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:32,723
So did Brass City.

343
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:41,087
Ray Leopold came home for a time,
then moved away,

344
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:45,205
went into business, and eventually
became a fundraiser for charity.

345
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:49,847
LEOPOLD: I ran into a young man

346
00:31:49,847 --> 00:31:55,087
who was the brother of a young man
I had known reasonably well.

347
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:57,767
He said, "What outfit
were you with, Ray?"

348
00:31:57,767 --> 00:32:01,167
And I told him that I was
with the 28th Infantry.

349
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:04,807
"Really?" he said.
"My brother was with that outfit."

350
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:06,887
And I said, "Where is your brother?"

351
00:32:06,887 --> 00:32:12,447
He said, "Oh, he didn't make it.
He's dead.

352
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:15,487
"He was killed in action."

353
00:32:15,487 --> 00:32:18,727
And then he turned, he says,

354
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:23,327
"You were with the 28th too,
and you are home and he isn't."

355
00:32:23,327 --> 00:32:28,007
He couldn't get over the idea

356
00:32:28,007 --> 00:32:32,876
that someone so dear to him
as his brother couldn't make it...

357
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:41,487
...and someone who is more or less
an indifferent third person

358
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:42,966
made it.

359
00:32:53,687 --> 00:32:59,127
MAN: There are casualties in war

360
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:03,047
that they never show up as casualties.

361
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,087
They're internal casualties.

362
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:09,287
We all changed.

363
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,847
We went out as a bunch of kids.

364
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:16,247
Wars are fought by kids.

365
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:18,687
And we came back -

366
00:33:18,687 --> 00:33:23,727
looked maybe the same,
but inside we were so different.

367
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:30,607
They thought we were just odd, I guess.

368
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:34,687
"What's happened to Quent?
What's wrong?"

369
00:33:34,687 --> 00:33:40,927
And I was wondering,
"Nobody knows, nobody understands,

370
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:45,717
"and I am not good enough with words
to be able to tell them."

371
00:33:50,247 --> 00:33:53,167
Quentin and Jackie Aanenson
did not return

372
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:57,127
to his father's farm south of Luverne.

373
00:33:57,127 --> 00:34:00,087
He went to
Louisiana State University instead

374
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:04,126
and eventually entered
the insurance business.

375
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:13,287
More than 1,000 citizens
of Rock County, Minnesota

376
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:15,482
served in uniform during the war.

377
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:21,280
32 of them lost their lives.

378
00:34:26,127 --> 00:34:29,927
The names of all those who served
were carefully painted

379
00:34:29,927 --> 00:34:34,637
on a wooden roll of honour
in front of city hall in Luverne.

380
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:42,887
As the years passed, Minnesota winters
wore away the names.

381
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:49,367
One year, the monument was taken
down to be repainted and repaired.

382
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:52,200
Somehow, it was lost.

383
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:03,647
WOMAN: Our hope was
we were going to have a new life.

384
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:11,167
And I remember driving up on the day
that we drove through to the ranch.

385
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:14,407
And it was like being
in 'Alice in Wonderland'.

386
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:17,683
It was absolutely amazing.

387
00:35:21,047 --> 00:35:24,487
Sascha Weinzheimer and her family,

388
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:28,247
who had nearly starved to death
as prisoners of the Japanese in Manila,

389
00:35:28,247 --> 00:35:32,365
settled on their late grandfather's farm
in the Sacramento Valley.

390
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:40,047
WEINZHEIMER: It was some sort of
cultural shock, coming back,

391
00:35:40,047 --> 00:35:43,807
because your body's here
but your mind isn't.

392
00:35:43,807 --> 00:35:47,727
And to have to put up with the stupidity

393
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:51,407
of some of the Americans
that have been living here.

394
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:56,127
They'd walk into a room and say,
"Oh, tell us about your experience."

395
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:59,567
And then immediately they'd say, "Oh!

396
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:06,447
"We had these coupons
that had to be rationed,

397
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:09,727
"and then we couldn't go here
because of gasoline."

398
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:14,967
And so we just sort of
avoided everything.

399
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:18,327
And when people were talking to us
about our experience,

400
00:36:18,327 --> 00:36:20,047
we just clammed up,

401
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:22,481
because it...
they didn't want to hear it anyway.

402
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:41,247
Sacramento's wartime transformation
from small-town state capital to big city

403
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:43,442
would prove permanent.

404
00:36:46,727 --> 00:36:49,847
State government grew too.

405
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:53,567
So did the military bases
on Sacramento's outskirts

406
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:58,038
as the world war was eventually
supplanted by the Cold War.

407
00:37:01,447 --> 00:37:05,047
Among the Sacramentans
returning home

408
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:10,127
were thousands of Japanese-Americans
newly freed from the inland camps

409
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:14,439
in which they had been imprisoned
for no other reason than their ancestry.

410
00:37:17,047 --> 00:37:22,201
They struggled to recover their property
and rebuild their lives.

411
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:30,680
The men of the 100th/442nd
Combat Team came home too.

412
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:38,287
Robert Kashiwagi,
wounded four times in Italy and France,

413
00:37:38,287 --> 00:37:41,359
got a job with the California
Highway Department.

414
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:46,247
MAN: When I showed up in the shop,

415
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:49,207
this one fellow from the floor
went to his foreman.

416
00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:53,447
He says, "Hey, look, if that Jap is gonna
work here," he says, "I'm quitting."

417
00:37:53,447 --> 00:37:56,167
And this foreman told me that.

418
00:37:56,167 --> 00:38:02,687
And I says, "Well, you know,
I passed my test and I served overseas

419
00:38:02,687 --> 00:38:05,727
"and I think I did what
I was supposed to do,

420
00:38:05,727 --> 00:38:08,767
"so I'm going to hold my position and
I'm going to remain here, you know?"

421
00:38:08,767 --> 00:38:13,363
And I did. And so,
as I remained there, why, he quit.

422
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:20,687
And then everything turned
a little bit better as time went on,

423
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:23,367
and it got easier and easier for me.

424
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:27,758
And so I was able to serve
32 years and retire.

425
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:52,927
The war had made Mobile
into a boom town.

426
00:38:52,927 --> 00:38:56,607
But only a few years after it ended,

427
00:38:56,607 --> 00:39:01,527
some 40,000 defence jobs
had already disappeared.

428
00:39:01,527 --> 00:39:05,927
Some workers left the city
for the small towns

429
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:09,007
where they'd been living
when the war began.

430
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:13,876
Others moved north and west,
to bigger cities, in search of work.

431
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:23,407
Returning black veterans,
who had fought for freedom overseas,

432
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:28,322
found themselves facing the same
segregation they had left behind.

433
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:35,327
MAN: It would be a matter of disgust
and distaste with you

434
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:40,003
when you found out that
the fruits of victory were not yours.

435
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:50,767
I never did appreciate
going to work at night.

436
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:54,727
And the police officer would
stop you at night and say,

437
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:57,727
"Hey, boy, where you going?"

438
00:39:57,727 --> 00:40:02,127
And you come up to answer him -

439
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:07,047
"You got your hat on. Take your hat off
when you talk to a white man."

440
00:40:07,047 --> 00:40:09,207
And that kind of stuff, uh...

441
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:13,487
And I'd worked all night, just about,
at the railroad,

442
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:16,767
and didn't have a car,
so I had to walk home.

443
00:40:16,767 --> 00:40:21,238
I cried all the way home.
It was... it was hurt.

444
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:28,567
John Gray eventually went on to college,
became a teacher

445
00:40:28,567 --> 00:40:32,487
and then a beloved school principal
and community leader

446
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:35,604
for 50 years in Mobile.

447
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:43,647
Katharine Phillips briefly became
an airline stewardess

448
00:40:43,647 --> 00:40:45,365
and married a former navy pilot.

449
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:50,927
Her younger brother, Sid,

450
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:53,367
who had encountered terrible suffering

451
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,807
while serving with
the 1 st Marine Division

452
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:58,687
and vowed to find a way
to do something about it,

453
00:40:58,687 --> 00:41:02,396
went on to medical school
and became a doctor.

454
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:10,287
But there was one person
for whom he could do nothing.

455
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:17,607
MAN: My friend Eugene
was probably as good a friend

456
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:20,287
as I've ever had in my whole life,

457
00:41:20,287 --> 00:41:24,327
but he could not throw off the war.

458
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:29,276
He could not forget it.
It seemed to haunt him.

459
00:41:37,007 --> 00:41:39,087
MAN: "As I strolled the streets of Mobile,

460
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:41,806
"civilian life seemed so strange.

461
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:49,887
"People rushed around in a hurry
about seemingly insignificant things.

462
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:53,567
"Few seemed to realise
how blessed they were to be free

463
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:55,683
"and untouched by the horrors of war.

464
00:41:59,207 --> 00:42:04,167
"To them, a veteran was a veteran -
all were the same,

465
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:08,647
"whether one man had survived
the deadliest combat

466
00:42:08,647 --> 00:42:12,765
"or another had pounded
a typewriter while in uniform."

467
00:42:18,687 --> 00:42:23,847
Eugene Sledge had been
an enthusiastic hunter before the war.

468
00:42:23,847 --> 00:42:28,127
Now he found
he no longer had the heart for it.

469
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:32,407
In combat, he had felt the same
terror his targets felt

470
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:34,247
when he fired at them, he said,

471
00:42:34,247 --> 00:42:38,320
and he couldn't bear it that
they could not shoot back.

472
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:42,887
Nightmares plagued him.

473
00:42:42,887 --> 00:42:46,127
He earned a business degree
under the GI Bill,

474
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:49,407
tried the insurance business
and abandoned it,

475
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:53,727
eventually became a biologist
and teacher.

476
00:42:53,727 --> 00:42:56,607
"Science was my salvation,"
he remembered.

477
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:01,044
"It helped keep at bay the flashbacks
from Peleliu and Okinawa."

478
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:06,807
"Close, constant study of nature,"
his wife said,

479
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:09,605
"kept him from going mad."

480
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:18,087
But the war remained with him
nonetheless.

481
00:43:18,087 --> 00:43:20,007
He still had the tiny sheets of paper

482
00:43:20,007 --> 00:43:22,927
on which he'd kept a journal
in the Pacific,

483
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:25,327
and finally, at his wife's urging,

484
00:43:25,327 --> 00:43:31,118
he turned it into a combat memoir
called 'With the Old Breed'.

485
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:36,367
Describing the horrors he had endured

486
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:40,406
eventually allowed him
to begin to put them behind him.

487
00:43:43,807 --> 00:43:47,482
Eugene Sledge died in 2001.

488
00:43:49,687 --> 00:43:55,327
MAN: "Until the millennium arrives
and countries cease to enslave others,

489
00:43:55,327 --> 00:43:57,167
"it will be necessary

FRAZIER: My home town just gave me
a hero's welcome.

Couldn't ask for anybody
to be any nicer to you.

500
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:48,927
But little did you know what was ahead,

501
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:52,397

until it started happening to me.

Glenn Frazier and his brother,

00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:04,927
who had served with the army
in North Africa and Italy,

504
00:45:04,927 --> 00:45:11,327
happened to arrive home
in Fort Deposit, Alabama the same day.

505
00:45:11,327 --> 00:45:17,287
Their mother, Frazier recalled, seemed
dazed to have both her boys back,

506
00:45:17,287 --> 00:45:19,607
but she remembered
to give each of them

507
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:23,207
the little pile of Christmas packages
she'd bought and wrapped

508
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:26,517
but had been unable to send them
during the war.

509
00:45:28,007 --> 00:45:30,767
When the boys stepped out
into the street,

510
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:35,716
they were mobbed by friends and
neighbours happy to have them home.

511
00:45:39,087 --> 00:45:43,207
Before Frazier joined the army in 1941,

512
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:48,527
he had confessed to a high school
classmate that he loved her.

513
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:52,527
She had waited patiently for him
for over three years,

514
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:57,527
until the army formally told his family
Glenn was dead.

515
00:45:57,527 --> 00:46:01,727
Frazier now eagerly asked after her.

516
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:04,327
Hope that he and she
would one day marry

517
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:09,847
had helped sustain him in captivity.

518
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:12,727
"I hate to tell you this," a friend told him,

519
00:46:12,727 --> 00:46:15,924
"but she's getting married
this coming Sunday."

520
00:46:18,687 --> 00:46:22,287
That night, the nightmares began.

521
00:46:22,287 --> 00:46:26,847
FRAZIER: It was just like real life again.
It was just so real.

522
00:46:26,847 --> 00:46:28,607
It sort of kept me from sleeping.

523
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,407
I got to the point where
I didn't even want to go to sleep.

524
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:33,087
My nerves were bothering me.

525
00:46:33,087 --> 00:46:35,887
You couldn't tell anybody.
You couldn't tell...

526
00:46:35,887 --> 00:46:38,687
In those days,
if you were seeing a psychiatrist,

527
00:46:38,687 --> 00:46:41,327
it didn't make any difference
whether it was military or what,

528
00:46:41,327 --> 00:46:42,999
nobody'd give you a job.

529
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:47,807
Psychiatrists working
for the Veterans Administration

530
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,167
were of little help.

531
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:55,447
"Just act normal and you'll feel normal,"
they told him.

532
00:46:55,447 --> 00:46:59,367
Frazier eventually married,
had two children,

533
00:46:59,367 --> 00:47:03,127
ran his own trucking business.

534
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:06,517
But the war would not go away.

535
00:47:11,407 --> 00:47:17,007
I hated the Japanese as hard as
anybody, I believe, could ever hate

536
00:47:17,007 --> 00:47:18,486
for so long.

537
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:25,287
And mine was as deep. I think
I was justified in the hate that I had.

538
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:28,807
But it come a time when...
It wasn't affecting them.

539
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,727
They didn't even know I existed.

540
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:32,967
They were over there
and having their fun

541
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:35,807
and getting their things, their country
straightened out.

542
00:47:35,807 --> 00:47:38,567
And here I am over here,
I'm hating and hating and hating,

543
00:47:38,567 --> 00:47:40,527
and having the nightmares and so forth.

544
00:47:40,527 --> 00:47:43,327
And it... I had to get rid of it.

545
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:47,479
I had to throw it off because
it was just completely destroying me.

546
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:53,487
And I prayed,
and with the preacher's help

547
00:47:53,487 --> 00:47:56,727
I got to the point to where
I woke up one morning

548
00:47:56,727 --> 00:48:02,327
and I felt a little bit more rested.

549
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:06,764
But my war lasted, actually,
another 30 years.

550
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:18,487
MAN: To forget the war would be
not just impossible -

551
00:48:18,487 --> 00:48:20,284
it would be immoral.

552
00:48:23,327 --> 00:48:28,727
It doesn't get to me very often,
except when I talk about it like this,

553
00:48:28,727 --> 00:48:30,287
and I seldom do that, actually.

554
00:48:30,287 --> 00:48:35,487
It's just something, it never goes away.

555
00:48:35,487 --> 00:48:39,847
It's something you have to endure
the way you endured the war itself.

556
00:48:39,847 --> 00:48:42,847
There's no alternative.
You can't wipe out these memories.

557
00:48:42,847 --> 00:48:45,967
You can't wipe out
what you felt at that time

558
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:47,767
or what you knew other people felt.

559
00:48:47,767 --> 00:48:53,567
It's just part of your
whole possession of life.

560
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:56,035
And I suppose it does some good.

561
00:49:05,687 --> 00:49:10,847
For all those Americans
who lived through the terrible conflict,

562
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:17,127
for those whose fathers and sons
and brothers were lost or maimed,

563
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:19,967
as well as for those
whose only contact with combat

564
00:49:19,967 --> 00:49:24,847
was listening to the radio
and reading the local paper,

565
00:49:24,847 --> 00:49:30,001
it remains to this day simply "the war".

566
00:49:39,887 --> 00:49:42,887
MAN: "Luverne, Minnesota.

567
00:49:42,887 --> 00:49:47,207
"All week long, with 'Silent Night'
running through my head,

568
00:49:47,207 --> 00:49:49,596
"I've been groping for a Christmas story.

569
00:49:52,687 --> 00:49:55,838
"Somehow, the story always eluded me.

570
00:49:56,887 --> 00:49:58,767
"A lot of servicemen have been in.

571
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:01,687
"They told us where they spent
last Christmas overseas.

572
00:50:01,687 --> 00:50:06,477
"But you didn't need to write
a story about them.

573
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:12,607
"The story of their happiness
about being home

574
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:16,566
"was written all over their faces
for the world to see.

575
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:25,007
"And now comes the time
when it comes our turn

576
00:50:25,007 --> 00:50:29,523
"to extend our Christmas greetings
to each and every one of you.

577
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:35,687
"May the joy of Christmas
and a big share of its peace and beauty

578
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:38,287
"be with you all,

579
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:43,047
"every single day
of the new year to come."

580
00:50:43,047 --> 00:50:46,357
