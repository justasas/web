1
00:00:05,321 --> 00:00:08,539
  THAT I WANTED TO FIGHT MY WAR 
           IN THE AIR.          

2
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:12,643
       THERE SEEMED TO BE       
 SOME SORT OF AN APPEAL ABOUT IT

3
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,379
    OR A SENSE OF EXCITEMENT,   

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,498
    SO THAT WAS MY OBJECTIVE.   

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,018
      SO WITHIN THREE WEEKS     
        OF PEARL HARBOR,        

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,253
    I WENT OUT TO FORT LEWIS,   
           WASHINGTON,          

7
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,922
 TO APPLY TO THE ARMY AIR CORPS.

8
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:27,775
       I WANTED TO BECOME       
        A FIGHTER PILOT.        

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,262
    AND MUCH TO MY SURPRISE,    

10
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,547
            I FAILED            
     THE COLOR VISION TEST.     

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,652
AND I CONTINUED TO TAKE THE TEST
       AT OTHER LOCATIONS       

12
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:39,153
      OVER A PERIOD OF TIME     

13
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:42,974
        UNTIL, GRADUALLY,       
I MEMORIZED WHAT I SHOULD SEE --

14
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:46,711
    WHAT NUMBERS AND SYMBOLS    
    I SHOULD SEE ON THE TEST.   

15
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:47,863
      AND THEN I PASSED IT,     

16
00:00:47,865 --> 00:00:51,850
   BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL I GOT   
      TO ANCHORAGE, ALASKA,     

17
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:55,220
        AND I WAS WORKING       
   FOR THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS   

18
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,589
    WHILE I WAS STILL TRYING    
     TO GET IN THE SERVICE.     

19
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:03,628
    AND I PASSED IT UP THERE    
    IN EARLY AUGUST OF 1942.    

20
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,015
    THE DAY THEY WERE KILLED,   

21
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:10,919
            WE TALKED           
    ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES.    

22
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:15,139
 AND WE PACKED UP THEIR THINGS. 

23
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:19,527
          AND MAYBE AT          
  THE OFFICERS CLUB THAT NIGHT, 

24
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:23,097
           ABOUT WHAT           
 THE ANGLE OF THE FLAK HAD BEEN 

25
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,919
    SO WE COULD TRY TO AVOID    
 CERTAIN APPROACHES ON TARGETS. 

26
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:32,557
    BUT THEN WE NEVER TALKED    
        ABOUT THEM AGAIN.       

27
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,110
         WE NEVER TALKED        
        ABOUT THEM AGAIN.       

28
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:39,714
         IT'S JUST AS IF        
       THEY DID NOT EXIST.      

29
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:44,786
   YHAUNTED US ALL THE TIME..   

30
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:46,704
  WE THOUGHT ABOUT -- OR<i> I</i> DID. 

31
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,306
  I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE OTHERS. 

32
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:53,378
     BUT IT WAS THE KILLING,    
        THE NUMBERS OF...       

33
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:10,661
           TO SEND ME           
   ORTO A FIGHTER SQUADRON,ED   

34
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,330
         FIGHTER GROUP,         

35
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,781
      FIGHTING OFF OKINAWA      

36
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:18,270
         TO PARTICIPATE         
    IN THE INVASION OF JAPAN.   

37
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:22,724
    AND WHEN THE ATOMIC BOMB    
    WAS DROPPED ON HIROSHIMA    

38
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:27,512
       ON AUGUST 6, 1945,       

39
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,098
  AND WE STARTED TO COMPREHEND  
        WHAT THIS MEANT,        

40
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,785
     AND THEN THE SECOND ONE    
     WAS DROPPED ON NAGASAKI    

41
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,371
        FOUR DAYS LATER,        

42
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:39,657
           WE REALIZED          
      THAT OUR WAR WAS OVER     

43
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,062
   AND THAT WE WERE GONNA LIVE  
       THROUGH THIS THING.      

44
00:02:45,264 --> 00:02:50,334
      I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT      
  IT ENDED LIKE THAT, SO FAST.  

45
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:53,555
         AND THOSE OF US        
    THAT WERE PRIMED AGAIN --   

46
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:57,241
    FORTIFIED PSYCHOLOGICALLY   
         AND EMOTIONALLY        

47
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,093
      TO GO BACK TO WAR --      

48
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,279
       WERE NOW REPRIEVED,      

49
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:04,099
      AND WE WOULD BE ABLE      
     TO GO ON WITH OUR LIFE.    

50
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,752
      I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE      
   TO UNDERSTAND THE OBJECTION  

51
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:12,873
TO THE FACT THAT THE ATOMIC BOMB
          WAS DROPPED.          

52
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,728
         WE JUST BURNED         
       ALL THE ADRENALINE       

53
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,195
  THAT OUR BODY COULD PRODUCE.  

54
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,132
          AND SOMETIMES         
     WHEN WE WOULD COME HOME    

55
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,234
      AND LAND OUR AIRPLANE     

56
00:03:22,236 --> 00:03:25,136
           AND TAXI UP          
        TO OUR HARDSTAND        

57
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,206
    AND TURN OFF THE ENGINES,   

58
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,207
     WE WOULD JUST COLLAPSE,    

59
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,811
       JUST SITTING THERE       
         IN THE COCKPIT.        

60
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,747
  THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE LEFT.  

61
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,550
          WE HAD BURNED         
       ALL THE ADRENALINE.      

62
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:42,370
           WE HAD USED          
   ALL THE ENERGY THAT WE HAD.  

63
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:46,524
      SOMETIMES I HAD TO BE     
   HELPED OUT OF THE COCKPIT.   

64
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,834
           THE FELLOW           
     WHO OWNED THE BUILDING     

65
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:57,969
    SAID THAT WE HAD TO LEAVE   

66
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:02,423
 BECAUSE HIS SON WAS COMING HOME
        FROM THE PACIFIC.       

67
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:03,708
    HIS SON HAD BEEN INJURED,   

68
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,762
  AND HE "DIDN'T WANT ANY JAPS  
   IN HIS APARTMENT BUILDING."  

69
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:11,983
       AND I SAID, "BUT MY      
   SISTER-IN-LAW IS PREGNANT.   

70
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,169
  SHE'S EXPECTING IN AUGUST --  
         END OF AUGUST."        

71
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,438
        THE BABY WAS BORN       
         ABOUT THE 21st.        

72
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,243
       BUT HE WAS ADAMANT,      

73
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:25,412
    AND ST. PAUL WAS JUST --    
THERE WAS NO PLACE TO BE RENTED.

74
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:28,666
      WE WENT AD AFTER AD,      
       LOOKING AT PLACES.       

75
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,252
     THEY WERE JUST LITTLE,     
            YOU KNOW,           

76
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:34,004
   PLACES NOT REALLY LIVABLE,   
             TO ME.             

77
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:37,424
   MY SISTER-IN-LAW AND I BOTH  
     WENT TO CHECK THEM OUT.    

78
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:39,961
        SHE WAS PREGNANT,       
    AND IT WAS SUCH A CHORE.    

79
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:41,662
        FINALLY, I SAID,        
         "YOU KNOW WHAT?        

80
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:44,148
        I'M GONNA GO OVER       
    AND TALK TO THIS FELLOW."   

81
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,500
          FIRST OF ALL,         
      I WENT IN THE FRONT.      

82
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,302
      AND IT WAS A SUNDAY.      

83
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:51,355
  AND HIS WIFE AND HER FRIENDS  
   WERE SITTING IN THE FRONT.   

84
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,390
             I SAID,            
"I'D LIKE TO TALK TO MR. LAUER."

85
00:04:53,392 --> 00:04:55,676
   "MR. LAUER IS IN THE BACK.   
         HE'S WATERING."        

86
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:57,744
     SO I WALKED TO THE BACK    
         OF THE GARDEN.         

87
00:04:57,746 --> 00:05:01,398
  HE WOULDN'T TURN OFF THE HOSE 
            AT FIRST.           

88
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,501
       AND ON TOP OF THAT,      
  HE WAS VERY HARD OF HEARING.  

89
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:07,604
     SO I SAID, "MR. LAUER,     
     I NEED TO TALK TO YOU!"    

90
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:10,925
         AND I TOLD HIM,        
 "MY HUSBAND IS IN THE PACIFIC. 

91
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,960
           "HE IS WITH          
     MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.     

92
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,896
   "HE'S FIGHTING SIDE-BY-SIDE  
          WITH YOUR SON         

93
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,782
           AND I SAID,          
 "I'M SORRY THAT HE WAS INJURED,

94
00:05:18,784 --> 00:05:22,452
 BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
  THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE." 

95
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:24,021
   I MADE THIS PLEA AND, "EH?"  

96
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:26,891
     AND A COUPLE OF TIMES,     
        HE COULDN'T HEAR.       

97
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,627
        AND THEN FINALLY        
      TURNED OFF HIS HOSE,      

98
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,714
      AND DIDN'T SAY "YES,"     
       "NO," OR ANYTHING.       

99
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:37,118
  AND SO I WENT AWAY THINKING,  
     "WELL, TRIED MY BEST."     

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,771
           AND I LEFT           
 AND DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING AFTER.

101
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,807
      WE WERE ABLE TO STAY.     

102
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:46,293
          SO I THOUGHT,         
  "WELL, IT MUST HAVE WORKED."  

103
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:50,764
         AND I TOLD HIM,        
   S"BE SURE TO ASK YOUR SON.   

104
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,800
     "BECAUSE HE'LL TELL YOU    
      THAT THESE NISEI BOYS     

105
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:57,238
     ARE FIGHTING WITH THEM     
          RIGHT THERE."         

106
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:07,196
          BUT IT SEEMED         
     LIKE HE NEEDED MY HELP     

107
00:06:07,198 --> 00:06:08,731
     MORE THAN I NEEDED HIS.    

108
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:14,103
       HE WAS A SWEET KID,      
          SO AGREEABLE,         

109
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:18,907
     A LITTLE BIT GULLIBLE,     
     AND VERY GOOD-LOOKING.     

110
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:22,528
         AND I JUST FELT        
       THAT HE NEEDED ME.       

111
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,966
    AND HIM LEAVING LIKE THAT   
     REALLY BROKE MY HEART,     

112
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:27,783
           I TELL YOU.          

113
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:29,252
  AND, OF COURSE, MY MOTHER --  

114
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:33,056
     THAT MEANT TWO BOYS NOW    
      WERE IN THE SERVICE.      

115
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,656
           AND, UM...           

116
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:40,329
       IT WAS REALLY HARD       
        TO GIVE THEM UP.        

117
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:44,233
        FROM HIS LETTERS,       
       YOU COULDN'T TELL.       

118
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:48,671
    HE WAS A RESERVED PERSON.   

119
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:51,057
        AND I DON'T THINK       
      HE WANTED US TO KNOW      

120
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:55,011
     BECAUSE HE WAS PROBABLY    
   PROTECTIVE OF MOTHER AND I   

121
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:57,847
      AND MY OTHER BROTHER.     

122
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,616
  HE'S A WONDERFUL GUY, ANYWAY. 

123
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:03,219
    NO, HE NEVER COMPLAINED.    

124
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:04,620
       WE LIVED WITH THAT.      

125
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:09,392
    THAT WAS PART OF OUR PART   
         WE HAD TO PLAY.        

126
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:13,462
        HE NEVER GOT A CHANCE   
   TO GO TO A CAMP TO REGROUP   

127
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:18,117
     OR REST AND RELAXATION     
         OR BE ANALYZED.        

128
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:21,870
      A FRESNO BOY THAT WAS     
     A FRIEND OF BOTH OF US,    

129
00:07:21,872 --> 00:07:25,591
 AND HE HAD SEEN HIM IN GERMANY.

130
00:07:25,593 --> 00:07:28,027
          AND HE SAID,          
      "HE LOOKED TERRIBLE.      

131
00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:31,347
           AND I THINK          
   THEY SHOULD SEND HIM HOME."  

132
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,049
     WELL, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.    

133
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:37,787
 AND WHEN HE DID GET DISCHARGED 
         AND CAME HOME,         

134
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,622
      HE CAME TO SACRAMENTO     

135
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:41,290
       AND STAYED WITH US       

136
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:45,194
       FOR ABOUT TWO DAYS       
         OR THREE DAYS.         

137
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:46,595
         HE SEEMED FINE.        

138
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:49,581
         HE WAS KIND OF         
       A QUIET KID ANYWAY,      

139
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:53,069
       SO THERE WAS NO WAY      
         FOR ME TO KNOW.        

140
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:55,004
    I DIDN'T DETECT ANYTHING.   

141
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:59,558
   BUT HE WAS REALLY SUFFERING  
          FROM TRAUMA.          

142
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,297
  SO, HE WENT HOME TO MY MOTHER 
           IN FRESNO.           

143
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,917
      AND INSIDE OF A WEEK,     

144
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,035
       SHE WAS CALLING ME       
         AND TELLING ME         

145
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:11,337
   THAT SHE THOUGHT MY BROTHER  

146
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,625
    WAS HAVING SOME PROBLEMS    
          EMOTIONALLY.          

147
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:16,992
         I GUESS HIS --         

148
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:18,761
     IT WAS OVERPOWERING --     

149
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:22,532
     I GUESS THE DEPRESSION     
         AND THE TRAUMA         

150
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:27,069
   UNTIL HE JUST HUNG HIMSELF   
     FROM THE KITCHEN LIGHT.    

151
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:31,123
      AND MY MOTHER CAME IN     
         AND FOUND HIM.         

152
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,742
             MM-HMM.            

153
00:08:32,744 --> 00:08:35,060
           YEAH, SO...          

154
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:40,115
           HE WAS 22.           

155
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:42,785
        WAR CAN BE ROUGH.       

156
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:49,792
        MY POOR MOTHER --       

157
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:52,895
  SHE WAS NEVER QUITE THE SAME. 

158
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:02,303
        MY GRANDFATHER...       

159
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:04,838
           TRAINED ME           
        TO BE A WARRIOR.        

160
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,826
   THE ANCIENT TRIBAL-WAR DAYS  
           WERE OVER.           

161
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,294
          BUT BEING...          

162
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:12,213
        [ CLEARS THROAT ]       

163
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:17,585
          A WARRIOR...          

164
00:09:17,587 --> 00:09:19,320
         IN HIS TIME --         

165
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:22,440
     BEFORE THE RESERVATION     
         WAS SETTLED --         

166
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:26,944
       HE KEPT TRAINING ME      
      TO BECOME A WARRIOR.      

167
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:32,784
        THEN, OF COURSE,        
I WOULD RIDE HORSES ALL MY LIFE,

168
00:09:32,786 --> 00:09:37,471
           EVER SINCE           
       I WAS A LITTLE BOY.      

169
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:40,942
     BUT IN THE WINTERTIME,     

170
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:43,410
       HE WOULD WAKE ME UP      
      EARLY IN THE MORNING.     

171
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:46,364
      HE SAID, "ALL RIGHT,      
    DON'T PUT YOUR SHOES ON.    

172
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:47,765
   "DON'T PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON.  

173
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:50,935
      RUN AROUND THE HOUSE      
          BAREFOOTED."          

174
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:54,856
  IT'S MAYBE 15, 20 BELOW ZERO. 

175
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:56,541
         EVERY MORNING,         

176
00:09:56,543 --> 00:10:01,996
        IT WAS TRADITION        
    WITH THOSE OLD INDIAN MEN   

177
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:04,616
   TO TAKE A DIP IN THE RIVER.  

178
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:08,485
        SO IN WINTERTIME,       
   WE'D GO TO THE RIVER THERE,  

179
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:11,038
    MAYBE 15, 20 BELOW ZERO.    

180
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,339
      WE'D GO TO THE RIVER,     

181
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:15,159
       AND HE'D CUT A HOLE      
           IN THE ICE.          

182
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:16,193
       IT WAS ALREADY CUT,      

183
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:19,547
   BUT HE HAD TO CUT IT AGAIN   
         FOR HIS HORSES.        

184
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:25,970
         SO HE'D REMOVE         
     THE THIN LAYER OF ICE.     

185
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:28,055
     THEN WE'D GO IN THERE.     

186
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:30,358
         I'LL TELL YOU,         
       THAT'S PRETTY COLD.      

187
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,046
       HE TRAINED ME TO BE      
       PHYSICALLY STRONG.       

188
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:37,298
         BY HIS TRAINING        

189
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,836
        AND MY OBSERVING        
   THE ACTIVITIES AROUND ME --  

190
00:10:41,838 --> 00:10:45,222
        MY ENVIRONMENT...       

191
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:48,259
  THE MOVEMENT OF THE ANIMALS,  

192
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:53,814
     THE BLOWING OF THE WIND    
    DIRECTION, AND SO FORTH,    

193
00:10:53,816 --> 00:10:58,653
       SO I WAS GENERALLY       
           WELL AWARE           

194
00:10:58,655 --> 00:11:01,188
        OF WHAT I'M DOING       

195
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,623
    OR WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.    

196
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:08,162
     SO DURING WORLD WAR II,    
        I WAS NOT AFRAID,       

197
00:11:08,164 --> 00:11:10,114
    I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING,    

198
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:12,984
           AND I KNEW           
    I WAS GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.   

199
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:18,422
   SO, HE TRAINED ME THAT WAY,  
            MENTALLY.           

200
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:22,410
   I WAS READY TO GO OVERSEAS.  

201
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:28,316
      AND A COUSIN OF MINE      
 HAD JUST COME BACK FROM EUROPE.

202
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:32,603
      HE WAS A TAIL GUNNER.     

203
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:34,021
       AND BEFORE HE LEFT,      

204
00:11:34,023 --> 00:11:38,726
         A MEDICINE MAN,        
   A SUN DANCE MEDICINE MAN --  

205
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:44,215
    POWERFUL, SACRED POWERS.    

206
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:48,686
     SO HE GAVE MY COUSIN...    

207
00:11:48,688 --> 00:11:51,071
        AN EAGLE FEATHER,       

208
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:54,742
        A FLUFFY FEATHER        
         PAINTED YELLOW.        

209
00:11:54,744 --> 00:11:56,744
      "ALL RIGHT," HE SAID,     

210
00:11:56,746 --> 00:12:01,816
            "PUT THAT           
     INSIDE OF YOUR HELMET.     

211
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:03,550
    THAT'S YOUR PROTECTION."    

212
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:06,070
       THAT HELPED A LOT,       
         TOO, YOU KNOW?         

213
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:12,660
       SO AS LONG AS THAT       
    SACRED PROTECTIVE FEATHER   

214
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,445
        WAS IN MY HELMET,       

215
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:19,934
     WHY, I WAS NEVER AFRAID    
          OF ANYTHING.          

216
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:21,819
        I NEVER PANICKED.       

217
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:27,241
    AND I THINK I SURVIVED...   

218
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:29,844
        QUITE ADEQUATELY.       

219
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:33,347
    SOME SOLDIERS GET EXCITED   
         AND GET SCARED,        

220
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:36,734
         PANIC AND RUN,         
     AND THEY GET SHOT DOWN.    

221
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:39,937
         BUT I'M ALWAYS         
      IN CHARGE OF MYSELF.      

222
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:42,906
             I KNEW             
  WHAT THE ENEMY WAS GONNA DO.  

223
00:12:42,908 --> 00:12:44,208
       SO I WAS ALL RIGHT.      

224
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,878
    AND THAT LITTLE MEDICINE    
            IN THERE,           

225
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,531
  I THINK THAT KIND OF GAVE ME  

226
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:54,902
         THAT...FEELING         

227
00:12:54,904 --> 00:13:00,308
         OF HAVING POWER        
           OVER MYSELF          

228
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,925
         AND THE ENEMY.         

229
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,182
         I'VE SEEN A LOT        
      OF SAD SITUATIONS --      

230
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:13,471
     PEOPLE GETTING KILLED,     
          LYING THERE,          

231
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:17,759
      CIVILIANS, SOLDIERS,      

232
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:19,326
        BOTH SOLDIERS --        

233
00:13:19,328 --> 00:13:23,130
        AMERICAN SOLDIER,       
        GERMAN SOLDIERS.        

234
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:28,686
      AND ONE OF THE WORST      
         I'VE WITNESSED         

235
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:34,241
         WAS WE WERE...         

236
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:38,178
            ADVANCING           
     INTO THIS LITTLE TOWN.     

237
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:45,820
    AND OUR COMPANY COMMANDER   
       STEPPED ON A MINE.       

238
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:50,324
   BOY, BOTH LEGS WERE GONE --  

239
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:53,527
        JUST THESE STUBS.       

240
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:54,912
    AND HE WAS SITTING THERE.   

241
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:59,700
    AND I WAS STANDING THERE    
     AND COULDN'T HELP HIM.     

242
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:01,769
     I WAS SCARED, YOU KNOW,    
            SHOOK UP.           

243
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:06,574
   AND HE LOOKED AT HIS LEGS,   
     THEN HE FELL OVER DEAD.    

244
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:07,608
            HE DIED.            

245
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,943
       THAT WAS TERRIBLE.       

246
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:13,281
    YEAH, THAT WAS TERRIBLE.    

247
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:18,586
 I SANG A SONG THAT BELONGED TO 
 A CHIEF WHO USED TO LIVE HERE, 

248
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:22,523
             A CHIEF            
    BY THE NAME OF GREYBULL.    

249
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,542
     AND HE WOULD SING THAT     

250
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:29,380
       WHENEVER THEY MEET       
     THE CHEYENNE, YOU KNOW?    

251
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:34,468
     AND WHEN THEY DO THAT,     
         READY TO CLASH,        

252
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,205
              WHY,              
     A CHEYENNE MEDICINE MAN    

253
00:14:38,207 --> 00:14:41,342
      WOULD SING A SONG --      

254
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:47,014
   I MEAN, A CROW MEDICINE MAN  
     BY THE NAME OF GREYBULL    

255
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:48,782
      WOULD SING THIS SONG.     

256
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:51,652
    AND THE WORDS WOULD SAY,    

257
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:56,490
  "THE CHEYENNE ARE COMING NOW  
          TO DO BATTLE.         

258
00:14:56,492 --> 00:15:00,127
     "TODAY I SHALL RUN OVER    
          ONE OF THEM.          

259
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:04,715
   "YES, IALL OF THEM." THEM.   

260
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:07,351
      SO I SANG THAT SONG.      

261
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:14,140
          FIRST IT WAS          
      THE DEAD GERMAN BOYS      

262
00:15:14,142 --> 00:15:16,109
         LYING ALL OVER         
       THE FIELD OF BATTLE      

263
00:15:16,111 --> 00:15:19,345
  AND BEGINNING TO TURN YELLOW  
          AND SO FORTH,         

264
00:15:19,347 --> 00:15:20,430
        THEIR EYES OPEN.        

265
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:23,016
    I'D NEVER SEEN A CADAVER    
     WITH EYES OPEN BEFORE.     

266
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:25,552
      I'D SEEN DEAD PEOPLE,     
       LIKE MY RELATIVES,       

267
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:26,386
      IN COFFINS AND SO ON.     

268
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:29,356
     THEIR EYES WERE ALWAYS     
        DECENTLY CLOSED.        

269
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:31,925
        AND WHEN YOU SEE        
     VIOLENTLY KILLED PEOPLE    

270
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:35,445
       WITH HOLES IN THEM       
   AND MISSING LIMBS AND SO ON  

271
00:15:35,447 --> 00:15:37,831
  STARING AT YOU WITH OPEN EYES 

272
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,182
     AS IF THEY WERE ALIVE,     

273
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:41,834
 YOU FEEL TERRIBLY DISCONNECTED 
          FROM THINGS.          

274
00:15:41,836 --> 00:15:44,554
     ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO SAY    
       SOMETHING TO THEM?       

275
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:46,773
    ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO SAY,    
           "I'M SORRY.          

276
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,659
       DID IT HURT MUCH?"       
          AND SO FORTH?         

277
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:52,512
   AND I WAS STILL IN COMMAND   
         OF MY PLATOON.         

278
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:56,283
    AND WE ATTACKED A GERMAN    
POSITION THROUGH A SMOKE SCREEN,

279
00:15:56,285 --> 00:16:00,270
     WHICH WAS SO THICK THAT    
 YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE.

280
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:01,471
     IT WAS A BIZARRE THING.    

281
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:04,824
       IT WAS A TECHNIQUE       
       FOR GROUND WARFARE       

282
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:07,410
    FROM THE FIRST WORLD WAR.   

283
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:10,430
   AND THERE WERE DEAD GERMANS  
       ALL THE WAY ALONG.       

284
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,249
    AND PEOPLE WERE STEPPING    
            ON MINES            

285
00:16:12,251 --> 00:16:14,550
   AND BLOWING THEIR FEET OFF   
           AND THINGS.          

286
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:17,687
          AND MY PEOPLE         
   WERE RELATIVELY UNTOUCHED.   

287
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:20,841
       AND WE HAD TO CLEAR      
          A SMALL WOODS         

288
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:24,460
     THAT WAS SEPARATED FROM    
        EVERYTHING ELSE,        

289
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:27,797
     MAYBE A HALF-MILE WIDE     
        AND A MILE LONG.        

290
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:31,385
    AND THE GERMANS HAD BEEN    
   PREPARING THAT DEFENSIVELY,  

291
00:16:31,387 --> 00:16:35,021
   THAT POSITION, FOR MONTHS,   
    PROBABLY SINCE NORMANDY.    

292
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:37,524
       AND WE ATTACKED IT       
   AS CHEERFULLY AS WE COULD,   

293
00:16:37,526 --> 00:16:40,977
   RUNNING IN WITH OUR RIFLES   
     AT PORT ARMS AND SO ON     

294
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:42,545
    THROUGH MACHINE-GUN FIRE.   

295
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:45,832
     AND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE     
  WERE HIT AND KILLED BY THAT.  

296
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:49,152
   AND ON MY LEFT, I REMEMBER,  
   I WAS LYING ON MY STOMACH,   

297
00:16:49,154 --> 00:16:51,271
         TRYING TO KEEP         
       AS LOW AS POSSIBLE       

298
00:16:51,273 --> 00:16:52,672
 TO AVOID THIS MACHINE-GUN STUFF

299
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:55,008
        THAT WAS GOING ON       
 ABOUT AN INCH ABOVE MY HEAD -- 

300
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,878
 SO CLOSE I COULD FEEL THE HEAT 
  OF BULLETS AS THEY PASSED BY. 

301
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,284
    WHO'D NEVER IMPRESSED ME    
   ONE OF THVERY MUCHCEMENTS,   

302
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:07,954
    BECAUSE HE WAS RATHER FAT   
          AND CLUMSY --         

303
00:17:07,956 --> 00:17:13,977
 AND HE WAS AIMING AT A MACHINE 
   GUN SOME DISTANCE FROM US.   

304
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:17,264
     AND BEFORE HE COULD GET    
           A SHOT OFF,          

305
00:17:17,266 --> 00:17:20,967
       THEY HIT HIM WITH,       
  I THINK, ABOUT THREE BULLETS. 

306
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:22,069
    AND I SAW ONLY HIS BACK.    

307
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:26,038
      I DIDN'T SEE HIS FACE     
        OR ANYTHING ELSE.       

308
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,710
    THERE FLEW LITTLE CLOUDS    
    OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE DUST,   

309
00:17:30,712 --> 00:17:33,513
          BUT THEY WERE         
         POWDERED BLOOD,        

310
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:36,116
 THEY WERE BITS OF FLESH TISSUE,

311
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:38,635
      AND THERE WERE PIECES     
        OF CLOTH UNIFORM.       

312
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:40,186
    AND ABOUT THREE OF THESE    
           CAME AT ME,          

313
00:17:40,188 --> 00:17:44,157
     AND THEN HE COLLAPSED,     
  AND THAT WAS THE END OF HIM.  

314
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:47,060
   WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE WAR,  
   I COULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED.   

315
00:17:47,062 --> 00:17:48,878
    AND I HAD A TERRIBLE TIME   
         WITH MY FAMILY         

316
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,865
   BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN READING  
    THE<i> SATURDAY EVENING POST</i>   

317
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:53,700
        AND<i> LIFE</i> MAGAZINE       
       ALL DURING THE WAR.      

318
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:57,904
     AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS    
 A SORT OF CHEERFUL GAME WE WON.

319
00:17:57,906 --> 00:17:59,506
            THEY KNEW           
     I WAS IN THE INFANTRY,     

320
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:02,225
        BUT THEY THOUGHT        
THAT WAS A BRANCH OF THE SERVICE

321
00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:04,394
          WHERE YOU DID         
       A LOT OF RUNNING --      

322
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:06,112
  ATHLETIC STUFF AND SO FORTH.  

323
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:11,684
    AND THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT   
 IT WAS ABOUT CLOSE-UP KILLING. 

324
00:18:11,686 --> 00:18:13,186
  THE MISSION OF THE INFANTRY,  

325
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:15,838
    AS I LEARNED IN TRAINING    
          MANY TIMES --         

326
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,058
      WAS THAT THE INFANTRY     

327
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,126
   IS CHARGED WITH THE MISSION  

328
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:24,448
       OF GETTING AS CLOSE      
    AS POSSIBLE TO THE ENEMY    

329
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,198
       AND DESTROYING HIM.      

330
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,437
 AND THAT MEANS TEAR HIM TO BITS
          IF POSSIBLE.          

331
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:35,842
   SO THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR   
 MY PARENTS EVEN TO UNDERSTAND. 

332
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:37,977
       AND HAD SOME NOTES,      
      FAIRLY BLOODTHIRSTY,      

333
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:39,346
        THAT I'D WRITTEN        
         ABOUT THE WAR.         

334
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:41,381
         AND I GAVE THEM        
      TO MY DAD AFTERWARDS.     

335
00:18:41,383 --> 00:18:44,351
  AND HE COULDN'T FINISH THEM.  

336
00:18:44,353 --> 00:18:45,635
  ABOUT ALL THE GOOD WAR STUFF, 

337
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:50,874
 TO SAY THAT I'M OFFENDED WOULD 
   BE A GRAVE UNDERSTATEMENT.   

338
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:51,975
      I'M APPALLED BY IT --     

339
00:18:51,977 --> 00:18:54,860
   BY THE LACK OF IMAGINATION   
          OF AMERICANS,         

340
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:59,232
   BY THE OBLIGATORY OPTIMISM   
          OF AMERICANS,         

341
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:00,866
       BY THEIR DIFFICULTY      

342
00:19:00,868 --> 00:19:04,554
        IN UNDERSTANDING        
     THE TROUBLES OF PEOPLE     

343
00:19:04,556 --> 00:19:08,458
    WHO ARE LESS WELL-PLACED    
         THAN THEY ARE.         

344
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,326
   I'M TALKING ABOUT THE POOR.  

345
00:19:10,328 --> 00:19:14,447
  AND THE INFANTRY ARE THE POOR 
         IN TIME OF WAR.        

346
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:17,100
 I'VE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME 
            SOMETIMES           

347
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:19,568
        TRYING TO EXPLAIN       
      WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.      

348
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,205
        PEOPLE WILL SAY,        
   "WHY ARE YOU SO IRRITABLE?"  

349
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:26,042
"I'M IRRITABLE BECAUSE I THOUGHT
   OF A COLLEGE FRIEND OF MINE  

350
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:29,745
      "WHO SPENT THE WAR AS     
AN ADMIRAL'S AIDE IN THE PACIFIC

351
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:32,315
     "AND NEVER FIRED A GUN     
        OR WAS FIRED AT.        

352
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:38,871
 "AND THE CONTRAST BETWEEN WHAT 
  HE WAS DOING AND I WAS DOING  

353
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:41,407
 "IS JUST TOO APPALLING TO BEAR 

354
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:47,430
  WITHOUT SOME KIND OF EMOTION  
    OF RESISTANCE AND ANGER."   

355
00:19:47,432 --> 00:19:52,502
       I WAS ANGERED THAT       
   EVERYBODY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND  

356
00:19:52,504 --> 00:19:56,505
        THE -- THE, UH...       

357
00:19:56,507 --> 00:20:00,126
      SITUATION OF SOLDIERS     

358
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:02,696
       WHO FOUGHT THE WAR       
         ON THE GROUND.         

359
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:11,853
        WELL, BASICALLY,        
     WHEN YOU'RE AN O.C.S.,     

360
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:16,709
   AND YOU LIVED, ATE, SLEPT,   
  AND EVERYTHING ELSE TOGETHER. 

361
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:17,893
      YOU STUDIED TOGETHER.     

362
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:18,860
    AND I STILL REMEMBER IT.    

363
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:20,896
        IT WAS GALLAGHER,       
        GALLOWAY, GAMBLE,       

364
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:23,081
  GARDENER, GALT, AND GINSBURG. 

365
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,416
 FORWARD OBSERVER IS UP FORWARD 

366
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:26,284
         TO FIND TARGETS        
       FOR THE ARTILLERY.       

367
00:20:26,286 --> 00:20:28,386
         AND YOU WORKED         
       WITH THE INFANTRY.       

368
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:31,473
          IN OUR UNIT,          
      THE FORWARD OBSERVER,     

369
00:20:31,475 --> 00:20:33,308
   IF THE INFANTRY WAS MOVING,  

370
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,911
         YOU HAD TO STAY        
      WITH THE LEAD PLATOON     

371
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:38,163
    OF THE ATTACKING COMPANY.   

372
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:41,900
 CHANCES ARE YOU WOULDN'T BRING 
   ARTILLERY DOWN ON YOURSELF,  

373
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,401
   YOU'D KEEP IT OUT IN FRONT.  

374
00:20:43,403 --> 00:20:45,604
       AND THAT WAS THERE.      

375
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:47,255
  BUT WE ALSO WENT FOR TARGETS, 

376
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:50,308
       IF WE COULD GO OUT       
     AND FIND SOME TARGETS.     

377
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,745
     TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST,    
         IT WAS BORING.         

378
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:54,396
         WE DIDN'T HAVE         
       BUT FOUR OFFICERS.       

379
00:20:54,398 --> 00:20:57,516
      AND MOST OF THE TIME,     
 THERE WASN'T BUT ONE AVAILABLE.

380
00:20:57,518 --> 00:21:00,485
      IF I WAS NOT FORWARD,     
  THEN I HAD TO READ THE MAIL.  

381
00:21:00,487 --> 00:21:04,022
 AND IT WAS JUST ABOUT AS BORING
        AS YOU COULD GET.       

382
00:21:04,024 --> 00:21:05,807
     I DO RECALL ONE FELLOW     

383
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:09,945
     THAT I JUST DIDN'T READ    
  HIS LETTER TO HIS GIRLFRIEND. 

384
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:14,232
      AND THERE JUST WASN'T     
   IT WAANY SENSE TO IT. DAY.   

385
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:17,118
  HE WAS ONLY WRITING HIS WIFE  
          ABOUT A PAGE.         

386
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,937
           [ LAUGHS ]           

387
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:22,407
       BUT THE GIRLFRIEND       
         WAS IN ENGLAND.        

388
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:26,528
 WHICH BASICALLY HAD 50 PEOPLE, 

389
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,796
     JUMPED OFF ONE MORNING,    

390
00:21:27,798 --> 00:21:31,750
   AND I HAPPENED TO HEAR THEM  
  ON THE RADIO THAT AFTERNOON.  

391
00:21:31,752 --> 00:21:36,187
     THE BATTALION COMMANDER    
 WAS ASKING HOW MANY MEN HE HAD.

392
00:21:36,189 --> 00:21:37,155
   HE WANTED TO WAIT FOR DARK,  

393
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:39,257
      AND HE WAS SENDING UP     
         CHOCOLATE BARS.        

394
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:40,625
            HE SAID,            
    "WE GOT ONE FOR EACH MAN.   

395
00:21:40,627 --> 00:21:43,094
     HOW MANY DO YOU WANT?"     
  AND HE SAID, "SEND ME FIVE."  

396
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:46,181
    HE ONLY HAD FIVE MEN LEFT   
      OUT OF HIS PLATOON --     

397
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:48,200
        HIMSELF AND FOUR,       
           APPARENTLY.          

398
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:53,104
     BUT YOU JUST LOST FOLKS    
       LIKE MAD IN THERE.       

399
00:21:54,674 --> 00:21:57,359
          I'M SITTING,          
      AFTER I WAS CAPTURED,     

400
00:21:57,361 --> 00:21:58,877
      SEVERAL DAYS LATER --     

401
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:01,329
   MAYBE A WEEK, I DON'T KNOW.  

402
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:03,915
  I WAS IN THIS LITTLE VILLAGE  
       WHERE I HAD FIRED.       

403
00:22:03,917 --> 00:22:06,751
      AS A MATTER OF FACT,      
   ONE ROUND GOT AWAY FROM ME,  

404
00:22:06,753 --> 00:22:09,220
    I HAD KNOCKED THE STEEPLE   
         OFF THE CHURCH.        

405
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:13,208
         BUT I'M SITTING        
      ON THE CHURCH STEPS,      

406
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,628
AND THIS GERMAN OFFICER GAME UP,
      AND HE WAS ARTILLERY.     

407
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,613
        AND HE COULD TELL       
        I WAS ARTILLERY.        

408
00:22:18,615 --> 00:22:24,719
       YOU HAD YOUR BRASS       
         ON YOUR COLLAR.        

409
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:26,654
 "WERE YOU THE FORWARD OBSERVER 
          OVER THERE?"          

410
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:30,275
         I SAID, "YEAH.         
 AND YOU UP THERE?" "YES, SIR." 

411
00:22:30,277 --> 00:22:32,511
   AND HE SPOKE BETTER ENGLISH  
           THAN I DID.          

412
00:22:32,513 --> 00:22:34,579
       HE'D BEEN TO SCHOOL      
           IN ENGLAND.          

413
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:35,914
     AND HE CAME OVER THERE     

414
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,765
 AND GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WAR --

415
00:22:37,767 --> 00:22:39,934
           CAME HOME,           
    GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WAR.   

416
00:22:39,936 --> 00:22:45,390
  AND HE WAS JUST LIKE I WAS -- 
     HE WAS JUST IN THE WAR.    

417
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:46,908
           SO HE AND I          
        HAD OLD-HOME WEEK       

418
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,793
          SITTING THERE         
      ON THE CHURCH STEPS.      

419
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:52,397
          BUT THAT WAS          
     AN UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE.     

420
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:55,000
   BUT I WAS GLAD TO SEE HIM.   

421
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:57,502
          WELL, ON ONE,         
   WE WERE ON A RAILROAD CAR,   

422
00:22:57,504 --> 00:23:00,789
    AND THE AMERICANS CAME IN   
          STRAFING IT.          

423
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,408
   YOU JUST TRIED TO GET AWAY   
         FROM THE TRAIN.        

424
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,278
     AND I WENT OUT A WINDOW    
      AND DOWN THE INCLINE      

425
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,848
       AND ACROSS TO WHERE      
      THERE WAS A BRIDGE --     

426
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,953
  A LITTLE BRIDGE OVER A ROAD,  
         NOT A BIG ONE.         

427
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:19,157
   AND THERE WERE TWO OR THREE  
   GERMAN SOLDIERS UNDER THERE  

428
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:22,543
   THEY THOUGHT THE AMERICANS   
    HAD LANDED OR SOMETHING.    

429
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:24,930
           THEY WANTED          
       TO SURRENDER TO ME.      

430
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:27,198
     AND I DIDN'T WANT THEM.    

431
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,569
  THAT I WASN'T IN ANY POSITION 
      TO TAKE THEM CAPTIVE.     

432
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:33,588
           BUT, YEAH,           
  THEY TRIED TO GIVE UP TO ME.  

433
00:23:37,842 --> 00:23:42,579
  WHEN I WENT INTO THE MARINES, 
     THE FIRST THING WAS --     

434
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:45,299
      WE HAD A LITTLE SCRIP     
          TO EAT WITH.          

435
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:49,921
     AND WHEN YOU WOULD STOP    
 IN A TOWN LIKE MACON, GEORGIA, 

436
00:23:49,923 --> 00:23:51,188
      THE REGULAR MARINES,      

437
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,856
         THERE HAD BEEN         
        NO BLACK MARINES.       

438
00:23:52,858 --> 00:23:56,443
     SO THE REGULAR MARINES     
  WOULD EAT IN THE DINING ROOM, 

439
00:23:56,445 --> 00:23:59,513
      IN THE REGULAR AREA.      

440
00:23:59,515 --> 00:24:01,699
          BUT IN ORDER          
       TO HONOR MY SCRIP,       

441
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:05,369
      THEY TOOK ME UPSTAIRS     
   IN THE PRIVATE DINING ROOM,  

442
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:08,605
       AND THEY BROUGHT ME      
    ANYTHING I WANTED TO EAT    

443
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:11,174
     AS LONG AS I DIDN'T EAT    
           DOWNSTAIRS.          

444
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:12,542
    AND I IMMEDIATELY ORDERED   

445
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:16,280
        THE FILET MIGNON        
     WITH ALL THE TRIMMINGS.    

446
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:20,284
  IT WOULD REMIND YOU OF HOME.  

447
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:21,452
    AND IT BROKE YOUR HEART.    

448
00:24:21,454 --> 00:24:25,323
  FOR INSTANCE, THEY HAD BANDS  
       WHO WOULD COME OUT       

449
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:26,723
    AND ENTERTAIN THE TROOPS.   

450
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:29,910
          AND ONE BAND          
     BROUGHT OUT LENA HORNE.    

451
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:33,798
           AND WE HAD           
   THE WHITE TROOPS AROUND US,  

452
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,101
    AND THEY WOULD MAKE SEATS   

453
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:41,638
    OUT OF MAKING TREES EVEN    
     AND PUTTING AIRSTRIPS.     

454
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,408
   WHEN SHE CAME OUT AND SAID,  
    "SHOO, SHOO, SHOO, BABY,"   

455
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:50,281
A WHOLE STRIP FULL OF WHITE BOYS
      FELL OFF THEIR SEATS.     

456
00:24:50,283 --> 00:24:54,919
     WE WERE PROUD AS PUNCH     
        TO SEE LENA HORNE       

457
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:58,656
       AND OTHER PEOPLE --      
  COUNT BASIE, DUKE ELLINGTON.  

458
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:03,477
  "THIS IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR," 
       IS WHAT WE THOUGHT,      

459
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,728
  "IF WE CAN JUST GET BACK HOME 

460
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,848
        AND GET A CHANCE        
     TO ENJOY SOME OF THIS."    

461
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:11,468
        OUR ATTITUDE WAS,       

462
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:16,506
         IF THE GERMANS         
         OR THE JAPANESE        

463
00:25:16,508 --> 00:25:19,209
          WON THE WAR,          

464
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:22,613
    THE WHITE FOLK WOULD GET    
         ON THEIR SIDE,         

465
00:25:22,615 --> 00:25:25,732
   BOTH THE GERMAN OR JAPANESE  
      <i> AND</i> THE WHITE FOLK.      

466
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:28,652
SO WHAT WE DID WAS GO OVER THERE
         AND WIN THE WAR        

467
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:30,988
      AND THEN COME BACK UP     
    AND PICK UP THE GAUNTLET    

468
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:35,258
      WHERE WE TRIED TO GET     
        OUR CIVIL RIGHTS.       

469
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,361
      THAT WAS THE FEELING.     

470
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:48,271
    I WAS ON A LIST SOMEWHERE   
           IN THE NAVY          

471
00:25:48,273 --> 00:25:50,774
         TO BE CALLED UP        
    AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.    

472
00:25:50,776 --> 00:25:54,844
     AND I WAS IN COLLEGE AT    
  THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA.  

473
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,896
     AND I'D SPENT MY MONEY.    

474
00:25:56,898 --> 00:26:02,052
     ONE OF THEM WAS ALREADY    
   ANA MARINE FIGHTER PILOT..   

475
00:26:02,054 --> 00:26:05,405
      THAT WAS UNENDURABLE      
   FOR ME TO BE A COLLEGE BOY   

476
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:07,841
          AND HIM TO BE         
     A MARINE FIGHTER PILOT.    

477
00:26:07,843 --> 00:26:11,994
      SO I FELT THAT I HAD      
   TO ACCELERATE THIS SOMEHOW.  

478
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:14,948
             I WENT             
   INTO THE RECRUITING OFFICE.  

479
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,901
         AND THERE WAS,         
       TO MY ASTONISHMENT,      

480
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:20,136
      AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE     
          AT THE DESK.          

481
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:21,271
  AND I SAID, "I'VE GOT TO GO." 

482
00:26:21,273 --> 00:26:24,774
     AND AS I TALKED TO HIM,    
  IT GOT MORE AND MORE INTENSE. 

483
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:27,143
        "I'VE GOT TO GO!        
        I'M OUT OF MONEY!       

484
00:26:27,145 --> 00:26:28,245
    EVERYONE ELSE IS GOING."    

485
00:26:28,247 --> 00:26:30,546
           AND HE WENT          
    TO THE CORNER OF THE ROOM   

486
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,498
   WHERE THERE'S A GREAT PILE   
            OF FILES            

487
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,450
          AND FINGERED          
       DOWN TO THE BOTTOM,      

488
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:36,969
         PULLED ONE OUT,        
         PUT IT ON TOP,         

489
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:41,507
      AND SAID, "YOU'LL GET     
     YOUR ORDERS NEXT WEEK.     

490
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:43,442
      DON'T TELL ANYBODY."      

491
00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:45,144
         AND I WENT OUT,        

492
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:50,667
   AND IT WAS LIKE THAT MOMENT  
          AT THE BEACH          

493
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:55,105
    WHEN YOU CLIMB THE LADDER   
       OF THE DIVING BOARD      

494
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:57,307
UP TO WHERE YOU USUALLY DIVE OFF

495
00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:01,261
 AND THEN KEEP GOING TO THE ONE 
   WHERE YOU MIGHT JUMP OFF...  

496
00:27:01,263 --> 00:27:04,597
      AND KEEP GOING STILL      
   UNTIL YOU GET THE VERY TOP,  

497
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:07,283
       WHERE YOU'VE NEVER       
       JUMPED OFF BEFORE.       

498
00:27:07,285 --> 00:27:10,319
AND THEN YOU STEP UP TO THE EDGE
            AND JUMP.           

499
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:14,540
      I FELT THAT I WAS IN      
          EMPTY SPACE.          

500
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:19,695
  SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO ME  
 THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE,

501
00:27:19,697 --> 00:27:22,398
     AND THAT I HAD DONE IT.    

502
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,636
YOU DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO
 DETERMINE YOUR LIFE VERY OFTEN.

503
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:28,621
  YOUR PARENTS DO THAT FOR YOU. 

504
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:30,706
 YOUR TEACHERS DO THAT FOR YOU. 

505
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:34,777
  THAT WAS GONNA CHANGE MY LIFE 
   BUT I JUSFOREVER. DECISION   

506
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,429
           AND IT DID.          

507
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,381
        EVERYBODY JOINED.       

508
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:39,366
     I WANTED TO BE A PILOT.    

509
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:43,152
          AND EVERYBODY         
      WAS IN THE AIR FORCE.     

510
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:44,670
    AND THEY WORE PINK PANTS    

511
00:27:44,672 --> 00:27:47,207
    AND HATS WITH THE GROMMET   
           TAKEN OUT.           

512
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:53,029
  THERE WAS SOMETHING SPURIOUS  
     TO ME ABOUT THOSE GUYS.    

513
00:27:53,031 --> 00:27:55,915
       THEY FLEW TOO HIGH.      

514
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:59,803
      I WANTED TO BE IN --      

515
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:02,722
     YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,    
       I WAS 17 YEARS OLD.      

516
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:03,623
     THESE WERE IMPRESSIONS     

517
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,925
   THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY BASIS   
           IN REALITY.          

518
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:08,778
         I ALSO THOUGHT         
     THAT THE MARINE CORPS,     

519
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,431
 WHICH WAS AN ELITE OF THE NAVY,
          AS I SAW IT,          

520
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:15,451
          AND THEREFORE         
    WAS THE BEST OF THE BEST,   

521
00:28:15,453 --> 00:28:20,540
    WOULD BE THE ORGANIZATION   
    TO FLY WITH, IF I COULD.    

522
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:23,560
      I BEGAN FLYING IN --      

523
00:28:23,562 --> 00:28:27,630
    FROM A LITTLE GRASS FIELD   
        NORTH OF DALLAS.        

524
00:28:27,632 --> 00:28:29,332
      AND IT WAS WONDERFUL.     

525
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:32,769
      THE FIRST EXPERIENCE      
     OF BEING UP IN THE AIR     

526
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:36,239
      AND SEEING THE WORLD      
        DOWN BELOW YOU --       

527
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:37,873
       IT'S INDESCRIBABLE.      

528
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:43,062
   BUT IT ADDS A DIMENSION TO   
THE WORLD YOU'VE BEEN LIVING IN.

529
00:28:44,214 --> 00:28:48,884
GROWING UP IS A SERIES OF TESTS,
           INEVITABLY,          

530
00:28:48,886 --> 00:28:51,721
            MOTIVATED           
      PARTLY BY CURIOSITY,      

531
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:56,058
   ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO DO   
    THINGS THAT GROWN-UPS DO    

532
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,328
 THAT YOU'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE, 

533
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,999
           AND PARTLY           
        A SERIES OF TESTS       

534
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:07,370
        OF YOUR READINESS       
    TO BE AN ADULT, I THINK.    

535
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,872
      BY PASSING THE TESTS,     

536
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:15,694
       YOU EARN ADMISSION       
     TO THIS CLASS OF PEOPLE    

537
00:29:15,696 --> 00:29:20,250
         THAT YOU THINK         
  ALL KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.  

538
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:25,705
 AVIATION IS CERTAINLY LEARNING 
  TO FLY AS A SERIES OF TESTS.  

539
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:27,373
    BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER    

540
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:31,594
      THAT AS AN 18- OR 19-     
       OR 20-YEAR-OLD KID,      

541
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:33,329
    YOU'RE, AT THE SAME TIME,   

542
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:36,566
       STILL GOING THROUGH      
     THE OTHER SET OF TESTS.    

543
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:39,836
       YOU'RE FINDING OUT       
   WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE DRUNK.  

544
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:42,739
 YOU'RE TRYING TO PASS THE TEST 
          WITH GIRLS...         

545
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:47,143
   WHEN YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW   
 WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU GET THERE. 

546
00:29:47,145 --> 00:29:49,745
          YOU'RE, UH...         

547
00:29:49,747 --> 00:29:52,014
      YOU'RE TRYING TO LIVE     
         INDEPENDENTLY.         

548
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:54,233
      YOU'RE TRYING TO ACT      
         INDEPENDENTLY.         

549
00:29:54,235 --> 00:29:55,868
      YOU'D BE DOING THOSE,     
            YOU SEE,            

550
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,238
       WHETHER YOU'D WERE       
  IN MILITARY TRAINING OR NOT.  

551
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,239
     ON TOP OF THOSE, THEN,     

552
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:02,608
   ARE THE TESTS ABOUT SOLOING  
           AN AIRPLANE          

553
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:07,696
    AND DOING YOUR FIRST LOOP   
  AND DROPPING YOUR FIRST BOMB. 

554
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:10,550
        THERE WAS A SONG,       

555
00:30:10,552 --> 00:30:12,051
     WHICH WAS SOMETIMES --     

556
00:30:12,053 --> 00:30:15,788
 THE REFRAIN OF WHICH SOMETIMES 
      WAS "BLESS THEM ALL"      

557
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,256
  AND SOMETIMES "FUCK 'EM ALL," 

558
00:30:17,258 --> 00:30:22,245
    DEPENDING ON THE AUDIENCE   
      AND WHO WAS SINGING.      

559
00:30:22,247 --> 00:30:24,363
     AND THE VERSES WENT...     

560
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:27,417
            THEY S--            
      THEY SENT FOR THE --      

561
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:32,088
     THEY SENT FOR THE ARMY    
       TO COME TO TULAGI       

562
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,425
      BUT GENERAL MacARTHUR    
            SAID NO            

563
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:37,510
     HE GAVE AS HIS REASON    

564
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:39,111
     THIS ISN'T THE SEASON    

565
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:42,548
   BESIDES, THERE IS NO USO   

566
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,016
         FUCK 'EM ALL         

567
00:30:44,018 --> 00:30:45,284
         FUCK 'EM ALL         

568
00:30:45,286 --> 00:30:48,821
     THE LONG AND THE SHORT    
         AND THE TALL          

569
00:30:48,823 --> 00:30:52,458
      FUCK ALL THE ADMIRALS    
        IN ComAirSoPac         

570
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:57,129
     THEY DON'T GIVE A DAMN    
     IF WE NEVER GET BACK      

571
00:30:57,131 --> 00:31:00,817
         SO WE'RE SAYING       
      GOODBYE TO THEM ALL      

572
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:04,437
     AS BACK IN OUR FOXHOLES   
           WE CRAWL            

573
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:09,508
    THERE'LL BE NO PROMOTION   
    THIS SIDE OF THE OCEAN     

574
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,844
     BUT CHEER UP, MY LADS    

575
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:14,747
         BLESS 'EM ALL        

576
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:16,716
    THAT'S THE LEAST OBSCENE    
        OF MY REPERTOIRE.       

577
00:31:16,718 --> 00:31:21,938
  IF YOU WANT THE REST OF THEM, 
         I COULD OBLIGE.        

578
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,241
      THE ATOMIC BOMB WAS,      
           OF COURSE,           

579
00:31:25,243 --> 00:31:28,628
         AN ENORMOUS --         
      MORE THAN A BIG HELP.     

580
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,082
   IT WAAND WE FELT THAT,WAR.   

581
00:31:33,084 --> 00:31:37,887
        AND WITH RELIEF,        
BUT ALSO WITH A KIND OF SADNESS.

582
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:42,625
       WE HAD BEEN TURNED       
     INTO ARTIFICIAL ADULTS     

583
00:31:42,627 --> 00:31:43,893
        FOR A FEW YEARS.        

584
00:31:43,895 --> 00:31:49,849
      AND WE'D LIVED LIVES      
  THAT WERE FULL OF EXCITEMENT, 

585
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:55,588
 LIVES THAT WE COULD NEVER HAVE 
   KIND OF ANTICIPATED LIVES,   

586
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,143
       BACK IN MINNEAPOLIS      
         AND BONESTEEL.         

587
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:02,745
      NOW IT WAS ALL OVER.      

588
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:07,533
      AND I'M SURE I WASN'T     
    THE ONLY PERSON WHO FELT,   

589
00:32:07,535 --> 00:32:11,654
   "NOW I WILL HAVE TO GO BACK  
    TO BEING WHO I REALLY AM,   

590
00:32:11,656 --> 00:32:14,356
             "WHO IS            
     A COLLEGE UNDERGRADUATE    

591
00:32:14,358 --> 00:32:17,510
       "AT THE UNIVERSITY       
          OF MINNESOTA.         

592
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:19,162
    "HOW BORING THAT WILL BE.   

593
00:32:19,164 --> 00:32:22,281
     "HOW NARROW AND LIMITED    
          THAT WILL BE.         

594
00:32:22,283 --> 00:32:24,817
      "WHAT KIND OF FUTURE      
           WILL I HAVE          

595
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:26,102
    "THAT WILL BE AS MUCH FUN   

596
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:29,805
        AS BEING A PILOT        
      IN THE MARINE CORPS?"     

597
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:37,080
   WHEN THE JAPANESE SURRENDER  
     WAS ANNOUNCED TO US...     

598
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:40,716
          WE...FELT --          

599
00:32:40,718 --> 00:32:42,919
      THE SQUADRON DECIDED      

600
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,721
       THAT IT OUGHT TO...      

601
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:48,808
        MAKE SOME GESTURE       
         OF CELEBRATION.        

602
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:54,731
            AND WE...           
     TOOK OFF AS A SQUADRON,    

603
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,132
          IN FORMATION,         

604
00:32:56,134 --> 00:32:58,968
          AND FLEW OUT          
 OVER THE FLEET IN BUCKNER BAY. 

605
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,570
       AND I EXPECTED THAT      
   WAS WHAT IT WAS GONNA BE --  

606
00:33:01,572 --> 00:33:05,875
    WE'D FLY OVER THE FLEET,    
 AND THEN WE'D GO HOME AND LAND.

607
00:33:05,877 --> 00:33:11,313
   THE MAN LEADING THE FLIGHT   
  SIGNALED TO GO INTO A COLUMN. 

608
00:33:11,315 --> 00:33:15,334
     SO WE ALL PULLED BACK,     
      ONE BEHIND THE OTHER,     

609
00:33:15,336 --> 00:33:17,102
     AND DOVE ON THE FLEET.     

610
00:33:17,104 --> 00:33:21,974
          HE PULLED UP          
   ANAND DID A BARREL ROLL.T,   

611
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:24,644
              NOW,              
     A BARREL ROLL IN A TBM     

612
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:28,564
             IS LIKE            
       A FAT LADY DANCING.      

613
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:29,565
      SHE SHOULDN'T DO IT.      

614
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:33,552
    AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN SURE    
         SHE<i> CAN</i> DO IT.         

615
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:36,371
     AND THEN THE NEXT PLANE    
             DID IT.            

616
00:33:36,373 --> 00:33:38,073
    AND THEN IT WAS MY TURN.    

617
00:33:38,075 --> 00:33:40,876
         AND I PULLED UP        
       AND PULLED IT OVER,      

618
00:33:40,878 --> 00:33:45,247
 AND ALL THE RUBBISH AND DEBRIS 
  IN THE BOTTOM OF THE AIRPLANE 

619
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:46,882
        CAME FLOATING UP        
          INTO MY EYES,         

620
00:33:46,884 --> 00:33:50,820
   AND THE CREWMAN IN THE BACK  
 RATTLED AROUND A BIT, I GUESS. 

621
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:54,273
      AND THEN WE CAME OUT      
     AND IT WAS STILL FLYING    

622
00:33:54,275 --> 00:33:56,642
          AND THE WINGS         
       HADN'T FALLEN OFF.       

623
00:33:56,644 --> 00:34:00,262
      AND THEN WE WENT BACK     
           AND LANDED.          

624
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:02,548
         AND I RECKONED         
       WHAT WE WERE DOING       

625
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,967
        WAS GIVING DEATH        
        ONE MORE CHANCE.        

626
00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:07,737
     IT WAS LIKE THE STORM.     

627
00:34:08,973 --> 00:34:12,307
            OF COURSE           
     IT COULD HAVE BEEN ME.     

628
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:13,375
         BUT IT WASN'T.         

629
00:34:13,377 --> 00:34:16,429
  I GRIEVE FOR THEM EVERY DAY,  

630
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:21,267
        THE TWO OR THREE        
     WITH WHOM I WAS MOST --    

631
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,953
      WHO I WAS CLOSEST TO.     

632
00:34:23,955 --> 00:34:28,023
           BUT, THEN,           
       PEOPLE DIE IN LIFE.      

633
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,708
         NOT THAT YOUNG,        

634
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:35,097
         BUT EVERY LIFE         
      HAS SOME GRIEF IN IT.     

635
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:38,234
      AND YOU GO ON LIVING.     

636
00:34:38,236 --> 00:34:42,371
        I TALKED RECENTLY       
     WITH A FRIEND OF MINE.     

637
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:45,808
            HER NAME            
   IS GEORGINE DuVIVIER-HALL.   

638
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,461
       SHE'S ABOUT MY AGE,      
        A LITTLE YOUNGER,       

639
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,930
 WAS IN COLLEGE IN PENNSYLVANIA 
        DURING THE WAR --       

640
00:34:51,932 --> 00:34:55,318
    A LITTLE WOMEN'S COLLEGE    
      CALLED WILSON COLLEGE     

641
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,388
    WHERE SHE SAID THEY WORE    
     WHITE GLOVES TO DINNER,    

642
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,708
    OR AT LEAST WHITE GLOVES    
        WERE PART OF IT.        

643
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,943
       SHE SAID SHE REALLY      
    WASN'T AWARE OF THE WAR.    

644
00:35:04,945 --> 00:35:07,380
   THERE WAS KIND OF INNOCENCE  
         IN THIS PLACE,         

645
00:35:07,382 --> 00:35:08,881
        AS THOUGH THE WAR       
          DIDN'T EXIST.         

646
00:35:08,883 --> 00:35:13,603
     BUT WHEN SHE WENT HOME     
      AFTER THE TERM ENDED,     

647
00:35:13,605 --> 00:35:18,257
   SHE HAD TO SIT IN A BOXCAR   
       SITTING ON A COFFIN      

648
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:21,978
      WHICH WAS THE COFFIN      
   OF AN AMERICAN SERVICEMAN.   

649
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,881
            IT SEEMED           
      AN ODD JUXTAPOSITION.     

650
00:35:25,883 --> 00:35:31,420
    THEY WERE CASUALTIES FROM   
  SOMEWHERE BEING BROUGHT HOME. 

651
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:36,959
     GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY --    

652
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:40,078
       I WAS NOW IN CHARGE      
        OF THREE SQUADS,        

653
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,983
       A TOTAL OF 41 MEN.       

654
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:51,423
   AND THEN I BEGAN TO REALIZE  
       WHY THIS WAS DONE.       

655
00:35:52,892 --> 00:35:54,843
     IN YOU'RE AN ENGINEER,     

656
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:57,396
         YOU'RE SELECTED        
        TO BE AN OFFICER        

657
00:35:57,398 --> 00:36:03,118
  BECAUSE YOU KNOW MATHEMATICS  
 AND LOGARITHMS AND ALL OF THAT.

658
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,156
            IF YOU'RE           
      AN ARTILLERY OFFICER,     

659
00:36:07,158 --> 00:36:12,444
   BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOMETHING   
  ABOUT TRAJECTORY AND PHYSICS. 

660
00:36:12,446 --> 00:36:17,615
  WHY WOULD THEY SELECT SOMEONE 
    FOR AN INFANTRY OFFICER?    

661
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:22,938
WELL, HE HAS TO KNOW HOW TO READ
    THE MAPS AND THE COMPASS,   

662
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,409
       BUT HE HAS TO KNOW       
          HOW TO KILL.          

663
00:36:27,411 --> 00:36:33,248
        I WON'T TELL YOU        
   THHOW MANY MEN I KILLED.T.   

664
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:37,736
 THERE ARE SOME WHO COUNT SHEEP,
        SO THEY TELL ME,        

665
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:42,774
 BUT THERE ARE TIMES IN MY LIFE 
        WHEN I COUNT MEN.       

666
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:44,726
  AND THAT'S A TERRIBLE THOUGHT 

667
00:36:44,728 --> 00:36:48,163
       BECAUSE I'M CERTAIN      
       THE AVERAGE PERSON,      

668
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:52,101
          IF HE OR SHE          
         RAN OVER A CAT,        

669
00:36:52,103 --> 00:36:53,802
    YOU'D NEVER FORGET THAT.    

670
00:36:53,804 --> 00:36:59,024
   SO HOW IN THE WORLD CAN YOU  
 FORGET KILLING A MAN, YOU KNOW?

671
00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:03,112
     WELL, I WAS IN OAKLAND     

672
00:37:03,114 --> 00:37:05,747
          GETTING READY         
        TO GET ON A SHIP        

673
00:37:05,749 --> 00:37:08,367
         FOR A BOAT RIDE        
         BACK TO HAWAII.        

674
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:12,220
       I WAS IN MY UNIFORM      
   WITH THREE ROWS OF RIBBONS   

675
00:37:12,222 --> 00:37:15,056
     AND THE CAPTAIN'S BARS     
         ON MY SHOULDER.        

676
00:37:15,058 --> 00:37:18,159
       I MUST HAVE LOOKED       
          PRETTY GOOD,          

677
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:22,765
  WITH A HOOK ON MY RIGHT HAND, 
      WHERE IT USED TO BE.      

678
00:37:22,767 --> 00:37:27,335
        AND SO I THOUGHT        
   I'D JUST GET A NICE HAIRCUT  

679
00:37:27,337 --> 00:37:28,771
        SO I'D LOOK NEAT.       

680
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:30,789
    I LOOKED AROUND OAKLAND.    

681
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,257
     HERE WAS A BARBERSHOP.     

682
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:36,111
THREE CHAIRS, I REMEMBER THAT --
        ALL THREE EMPTY.        

683
00:37:36,113 --> 00:37:41,366
  THE BARBERS ARE JUST STANDING 
     AROUND, SO I WALKED IN.    

684
00:37:41,368 --> 00:37:44,052
         THIS ONE BARBER        
         APPROACHED ME.         

685
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:49,007
      AND HE LOOKED AT ME,      
  AND HE SAID, "ARE YOU A JAP?" 

686
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:53,028
            YOU KNOW,           
   THAT WAS A STRANGE WELCOME.  

687
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,297
           AND I SAID,          
       "I'M AN AMERICAN."       

688
00:37:56,299 --> 00:37:58,801
     "WELL, I'M ASKING YOU,     
         ARE YOU A JAP?"        

689
00:37:58,803 --> 00:38:01,604
             I SAID,            
  "MY FATHER WAS BORN IN JAPAN. 

690
00:38:01,606 --> 00:38:03,005
     "MY MOTHER IS JAPANESE.    

691
00:38:03,007 --> 00:38:05,307
  I SUPPOSE THAT MAKES ME ONE." 

692
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:07,776
    "WE DON'T CUT JAP HAIR."    

693
00:38:07,778 --> 00:38:10,846
    AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,    
     "HERE I AM IN UNIFORM.     

694
00:38:10,848 --> 00:38:16,285
   IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS TO HIM  
  THAT I'M AN AMERICAN SOLIDER, 

695
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:20,271
  AND THAT FELLOW, VERY LIKELY, 
     HAD NEVER WENT TO WAR."    

696
00:38:20,273 --> 00:38:23,608
      AND HE'S TELLING ME,      
    "WE DON'T CUT JAP HAIR."    

697
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,777
        I WAS SO TEMPTED        
         TO STRIKE HIM,         

698
00:38:25,779 --> 00:38:28,630
      BUT THEN, I THOUGHT,      
        IF I'D DONE THAT,       

699
00:38:28,632 --> 00:38:31,133
          ALL THE WORK          
        THAT WE HAD DONE        

700
00:38:31,135 --> 00:38:33,502
        WOULD BE FOR NIL.       

701
00:38:33,504 --> 00:38:35,687
    SO I JUST LOOKED AT HIM,    
           AND I SAID,          

702
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:38,290
        "WELL, I'M SORRY        
       YOU FEEL THAT WAY."      

703
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:39,224
        AND I WALKED OUT.       

704
00:38:39,226 --> 00:38:40,609
    BUT IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME   

705
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:44,629
   THAT WHAT CAPTAIN ESPINGER   
     SAID WAS VERY CORRECT.     

706
00:38:44,631 --> 00:38:47,266
        IT'S GOING TO BE        
        A LONG STRUGGLE,        

707
00:38:47,268 --> 00:38:49,451
          A TOUGH ONE.          

708
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:59,945
     THAT IF IT HADN'T BEEN     
 FOR THAT CHILDHOOD THAT WE HAD,

709
00:38:59,947 --> 00:39:05,133
   STRESSED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE   
           IN MATTERS           

710
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:10,055
 THAT WERE SO OUT OF PROPORTION 
     FROM REGULAR CHILDHOOD,    

711
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:15,043
     WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE    
    THE PEOPLE WE WERE TODAY.   

712
00:39:15,045 --> 00:39:19,114
  AND IT'S JUST LIKE ME LIVING  
    IN THE WINE COUNTRY HERE    

713
00:39:19,116 --> 00:39:23,552
     WHERE I JUST FOUND OUT     
THAT THE MORE STRESSED THE VINE,

714
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:27,888
       THE BETTER THE WINE      
        AND THE GRAPE IS.       

715
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,759
      SO DIDN'T KNOW THAT.      

716
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:33,728
   SO IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.  

717
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:41,802
    I THINK LUVERNE PROBABLY    
   WAS CLEANER DURING THE WAR   

718
00:39:41,804 --> 00:39:44,037
        THAN AT ANY TIME        
         IN ITS HISTORY,        

719
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:47,123
        PRIMARILY BECAUSE       
      WE KIDS WOULD GO OUT      

720
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:51,411
   AND WE'D GO TO THE ALLEYS,   
     BACK ROADS, DITCHES --     

721
00:39:51,413 --> 00:39:53,930
   ANYTHING TO FIND SOMETHING   
          OUT OF METAL          

722
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:57,151
     BECAUSE YOU COULD GET,     
      LIKE, A PENNY A POUND     

723
00:39:57,153 --> 00:39:58,636
  FOR SOMETHING OF THIS NATURE. 

724
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:03,040
    AND THEN IF YOU TOOK THEM   
      DOWN TO THE THEATER,      

725
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:06,977
     IF YOU HAD TWO, THREE,     
   FOUR POUNDS OF SCRAP METAL,  

726
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:08,612
  YOU WOULD GET A FREE TICKET.  

727
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,698
      MY TWO BROTHERS AND I     
        WENT OUT ONE TIME       

728
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,068
   AND MADE A HORRENDOUS HAUL.  

729
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,669
    WE JUST -- I DON'T KNOW.    

730
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:19,706
       THE ONE MAJOR THING      
    THAT I REMEMBER IN THERE,   

731
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,341
    WE HAD A BRASS BEDSTEAD,    

732
00:40:21,343 --> 00:40:24,878
      AND WE HAD OLD WHEELS     
            WE FOUND.           

733
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,881
     WE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH    
    TO GET INTO THE THEATER.    

734
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,983
           SO THE KIDS          
    WHO DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH --   

735
00:40:29,985 --> 00:40:33,153
   WE WERE DOWN ON MAIN STREET  
      RIGHT BY THE THEATER,     

736
00:40:33,155 --> 00:40:35,856
    AND WE'RE HANDING OUT --    
       "WHAT DO YOU NEED?       

737
00:40:35,858 --> 00:40:37,925
        "YOU NEED A TIRE?       
       HERE'S AN OLD RIM.       

738
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:41,728
 HERE'S AN OLD PIECE OF METAL," 
       OR WHATEVER IT WAS.      

739
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,830
    THEN DOC BOMENE, WHO WAS    
   THE MANAGER OF THE THEATER,  

740
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:47,167
 CAME DOWN AND TOLD US, "I DON'T
  WANT YOU DOING THIS ANYMORE.  

741
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:49,068
     THESE KIDS HAVE TO GET     
        THEIR OWN STUFF."       

742
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,188
     TWO POUNDS OF MILKWEED     
    WOULD MAKE ONE LIFE VEST.   

743
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:55,292
     SO THEY GAVE EVERYBODY     
      THESE SACKS, OR BAGS,     

744
00:40:55,294 --> 00:40:58,528
    AND THEN WE WOULD GO OUT    
      LOOKING FOR MILKWEED.     

745
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,732
  AND WE GOT TWO CENTS A POUND  
           FOR THESE.           

746
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:06,002
           OKAY, NOW,           
   NTHAT'S A LOT OF MILKWEED.   

747
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:07,571
   STUCK IN ONE OF THESE BAGS.  

748
00:41:07,573 --> 00:41:12,642
 BUT WE WOULD HAVE OUR PATCHES. 

749
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:16,046
   WAS FROM OLSEN'S DAIRY OUT   
   TOWARD THE BLUE MOUNTAINS,   

750
00:41:16,048 --> 00:41:17,915
    ALONG THE OLD ROCK ISLAND   
            RAILROAD.           

751
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:21,351
      AND WE'D GO OUT THERE     
    AT NIGHT OR AFTER DINNER,   

752
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:24,021
     AND WE WOULD CRAWL DOWN    
           IN THESE --          

753
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,891
          IT'S NOTHING          
     BUT WEEDS AND BRAMBLES     

754
00:41:27,893 --> 00:41:32,963
   AND WE'RE COLLECTING THESE   
    GOD-AWFUL MILKWEED PODS.    

755
00:41:32,965 --> 00:41:36,200
  BUT WE WOULDN'T TELL ANYBODY  
       WHERE WE WERE GOING      

756
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,434
 BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY 

757
00:41:37,436 --> 00:41:40,403
      "FINDING THE MILKWEED     
  IN OUR PATCH" KIND OF THING.  

758
00:41:40,405 --> 00:41:44,959
      IN ONE YEAR, I THINK      
   THERE WERE LIKE 1,300 BAGS   

759
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:48,279
       THAT WERE TURNED IN      
        OF THIS MILKWEED.       

760
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:49,563
    I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND    

761
00:41:49,565 --> 00:41:53,366
    HOW THEY WERE GONNA TAKE    
    THIS LITTLE BIT OF STUFF    

762
00:41:53,368 --> 00:41:54,685
    AND SAVE SOME NAVY PILOT    

763
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:57,388
          WHO ENDED UP          
      IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN.     

764
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,741
 BUT THAT WAS THE STORY WE GOT. 

765
00:42:02,744 --> 00:42:06,663
     AND THERE WERE WARDENS     
  ALL AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  

766
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:08,631
 THESE GUYS WOULD GO OUT THERE. 

767
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:10,767
          AND WE'D HAVE         
        THESE BLACKOUTS.        

768
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,403
 THE SIREN WOULD RING DOWNTOWN. 

769
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:15,072
    THEN YOU HAD TO TURN OFF    
         ALL YOUR LIGHTS        

770
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,907
         UNLESS YOU HAD         
       A BLACKOUT CURTAIN       

771
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,777
  THAT YOU COULD PUT OVER YOUR  
WINDOW SO THAT NO LIGHT GOT OUT.

772
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:22,962
           THE DADS --          
   MY DAD, THESE OTHER GUYS --  

773
00:42:22,964 --> 00:42:26,466
  WOULD GO OUT, AND THEY WOULD  
  WALK AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD. 

774
00:42:26,468 --> 00:42:30,703
   NOW, I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT   
 HOW THE GERMANS WERE GONNA FLY 

775
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:33,190
       ALL THE WAY ACROSS       
       THE ATLANTIC OCEAN       

776
00:42:33,192 --> 00:42:38,062
 AND THE JAPANESE WERE GONNA FLY
    ACROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN    

777
00:42:38,064 --> 00:42:42,199
    I MEAN, I HAD NO CONCEPT    
      OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.     

778
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:44,200
     THEY WANTED THESE GUYS     
          TO HAVE GUNS,         

779
00:42:44,202 --> 00:42:46,236
      BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE      
       ANY GUNS FOR THEM.       

780
00:42:46,238 --> 00:42:49,973
   SO MY DAD, THE FIRST COUPLE  
       TIMES HE WENT OUT,       

781
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:53,009
    I GUESS YOU WERE SUPPOSED   
       TO HAVE THIS NOTION      

782
00:42:53,011 --> 00:42:54,645
 THAT YOU'RE CARRYING A WEAPON. 

783
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:56,647
           HE THOUGHT           
     THAT WAS KIND OF DUMB,     

784
00:42:56,649 --> 00:42:59,783
         SO HE'D GO OUT         
   WITH HIS 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN.   

785
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,819
  HE HAD NO SHELLS OR ANYTHING. 

786
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:03,487
      AND THEN IT GOT TO BE     

787
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:06,223
        WHERE THESE GUYS        
   WOULD STAY OUT FOR A WHILE.  

788
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:08,658
          AND MY MOTHER         
       FINALLY FIGURED OUT      

789
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,861
       THAT THEY MAY DOWN       
         AT DOC BLAKE'S         

790
00:43:10,863 --> 00:43:14,097
   OR ED COLLINS' OR SOMEPLACE  
       HAVING A HIGHBALL.       

791
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,867
         SO IT WAS MORE         
   OF A SOCIAL THING, I THINK,  

792
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:20,503
   FOR THESE MEN TO PROTECT US  
     FROM I DON'T KNOW WHAT.    

793
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:24,792
       THEY HAD TO GO OUT       
    ON THESE NIGHTLY PATROLS.   

794
00:43:25,993 --> 00:43:28,778
       COLLECTING ANYTHING      
          AT THAT TIME          

795
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:32,783
 WAS OUR BASIC SOURCE OF INCOME 
            FOR KIDS.           

796
00:43:32,785 --> 00:43:33,683
       AND WE COULD GO --       

797
00:43:33,685 --> 00:43:35,869
         NOW THIS SEEMS         
       KIND OF RIDICULOUS.      

798
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:40,607
       BUT WE COULD GO TO       
 ROVER'S POOL HALL, FOR EXAMPLE,

799
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:44,878
       AND HAVE A HOT DOG       
 AND A MILKSHAKE AND A CANDY BAR

800
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,781
     THE HOT DOG WAS A DIME,    
  AND THE MILKSHAKE WAS A DIME, 

801
00:43:47,783 --> 00:43:49,650
        AND THE CANDY BAR       
          WAS A NICKLE.         

802
00:43:49,652 --> 00:43:50,751
    AND IF YOU HAD 11 CENTS,    

803
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,586
    YOU COULD GO TO THE MOVIE   
            BESIDES.            

804
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:56,156
    SO WE DIDN'T REALLY NEED    
         A LOT OF MONEY.        

805
00:43:56,158 --> 00:43:57,357
     BUT WHAT MONEY WE GOT,     

806
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,394
        WE GOT FROM A LOT       
      OF THE SCRAP THINGS.      

807
00:44:01,396 --> 00:44:05,382
     WE HAD AN ARMY AIR BASE    
     THAT WAS 30 MILES AWAY.    

808
00:44:05,384 --> 00:44:07,034
   AND A LOT OF THOSE SOLDIERS  

809
00:44:07,036 --> 00:44:09,803
      CAME OVER TO LUVERNE      
          ON THEIR R&R,         

810
00:44:09,805 --> 00:44:12,356
  SO WE HAD SOLDIERS AROUND US. 

811
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:16,693
   THEY WERE FLYING LIBERATORS  
  AND P-47s OUT OF SIOUX FALLS, 

812
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,713
  SO WE HAD A LOT OF AIRPLANES  
            OVER US.            

813
00:44:19,715 --> 00:44:21,415
     IF SOME GUY WAS DATING     

814
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:24,951
    ONE OF THE LUVERNE GIRLS,   
           LET'S SAY,           

815
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,887
 AND THEY WENT UP ON AN EXERCISE

816
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:29,823
 AND HE WAS FLYING ONE OF THESE 
       P-47 THUNDERBOLTS,       

817
00:44:29,825 --> 00:44:32,843
   HE WOULD COME ZOOMING DOWN   
           MAIN STREET          

818
00:44:32,845 --> 00:44:36,446
       LIKE 200, 300 FEET       
         OVER THE CITY.         

819
00:44:36,448 --> 00:44:39,916
     AND THE WINGS ARE GOING    
       LIKE THIS TO LET --      

820
00:44:39,918 --> 00:44:43,453
        IF SHE'S WORKING        
     WITH THE PHONE COMPANY,    

821
00:44:43,455 --> 00:44:44,588
     SHE'D KNOW WHO IT WAS.     

822
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,424
  I MEAN, THIS IS KIND OF A WAY 
      THEY WERE SIGNALING.      

823
00:44:47,426 --> 00:44:50,827
    AND WINDOWS WOULD RATTLE,   
 AND PEOPLE WOULD GET ALL UPSET.

824
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:53,680
      "YOU KNOW, THESE GUYS     
    SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS."   

825
00:44:53,682 --> 00:44:56,166
        BUT I DON'T THINK       
      IT EVER STOPPED THEM.     

826
00:44:56,168 --> 00:44:58,886
           I REMEMBER           
      ANOTHER FUNNY THING.      

827
00:44:58,888 --> 00:45:03,490
     AND WE WERE ALL EXCITED    
   THE BOMTO SEE THEM, A LOT.   

828
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,559
      THESE BIG LIBERATORS      
           AND B-29s,           

829
00:45:05,561 --> 00:45:08,962
     SOME OF THESE THAT THEY    
 WERE FLYING OUT OF SIOUX FALLS.

830
00:45:08,964 --> 00:45:11,632
  AND SO IF WE COULD HEAR THEM  
             COMING,            

831
00:45:11,634 --> 00:45:13,066
   WE'D SAY, "BOMBER! BOMBER!"  

832
00:45:13,068 --> 00:45:15,668
   AND EVERYBODY WOULD RUN OUT  
         THE BACK DOOR,         

833
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,404
        AND WE'D LOOK UP        
        AND WATCH THESE.        

834
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:20,874
 WELL, WE HAD A COCKER SPANIEL, 
             RINKY.             

835
00:45:20,876 --> 00:45:25,312
  RINKY WOULD HEAD FOR THE BACK 
 DOOR JUST AS FAST AS HE COULD. 

836
00:45:25,314 --> 00:45:28,315
 ALL YOU HAD TO SAY IS, "BOMBER!
   BOMBER!" AND RINKY IS GONE.  

837
00:45:28,317 --> 00:45:32,119
 AND ONE TIME MY MOTHER HAD JUST
    WAXED THE KITCHEN FLOOR.    

838
00:45:32,121 --> 00:45:33,887
          AND WE SAID,          
        "BOMBER! BOMBER!"       

839
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:36,556
   AND RINKY GOES TEARING OUT   
        TO THE BACK DOOR.       

840
00:45:36,558 --> 00:45:39,026
 HIS FEET ARE JUST CHURNING AWAY
           LIKE CRAZY,          

841
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:42,896
 FALLING DOWN, TRYING TO GET OUT
   THE BACK DOOR TO SEE THAT.   

842
00:45:42,898 --> 00:45:46,733
   BUT WE ALL RAN OUT TO WATCH  
      THESE PLANES GO OVER.     

843
00:45:46,735 --> 00:45:48,701
    AND THEY WENT OVER A LOT.   

844
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:55,708
  YOU KNOW, THERE WAS TERRIBLE  
    CONFUSION DURING COMBAT,    

845
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,592
       JUST UNBELIEVABLE.       

846
00:45:56,594 --> 00:45:59,428
       I MEAN, NO ONE KNEW      
       WHAT WAS GOING ON,       

847
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:02,147
        AND I DON'T THINK       
    THE GERMANS DID, EITHER.    

848
00:46:02,149 --> 00:46:05,718
  BUT ONE OF THE MOST CONFUSING 
      THINGS WAS THE RADIO.     

849
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,004
      WE ALWAYS HAD A RADIO     
     IN SOMEPLACE AROUND US     

850
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:11,740
    SO THAT WE COULD CONTACT    
          HEADQUARTERS,         

851
00:46:11,742 --> 00:46:14,676
      AND THEY WERE ASKING      
         WHERE WE WERE.         

852
00:46:14,678 --> 00:46:15,911
    CALL FOR ARTILLERY FIRE,    

853
00:46:15,913 --> 00:46:22,068
         YOU COULD TALK         
   TO THE ARTILLERY OBSERVER.   

854
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,069
          BUT THE RADIO         
        WAS JUST MADNESS        

855
00:46:24,071 --> 00:46:25,988
          BECAUSE THERE         
       WAS ALWAYS SOME GUY      

856
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:29,658
    PINNED DOWN IN A TERRIBLE   
 SITUATION, SCREAMING FOR HELP, 

857
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:33,178
 AND THEN A VERY COOL, CALM GUY 
        IN THE BACKGROUND       

858
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,248
   SAYING, "THIS IS RABBIT 3.   
       WHAT DO YOU NEED?"       

859
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,967
     AND THIS GUY WOULD SAY,    
       "CUT THAT CRAP OUT!      

860
00:46:38,969 --> 00:46:41,336
    WE'RE GETTING FIRED ON!"    

861
00:46:41,338 --> 00:46:44,339
         BUT THIS COMING        
      FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.      

862
00:46:45,558 --> 00:46:47,893
    WELL, WHEN THE WAR ENDED,   

863
00:46:47,895 --> 00:46:49,745
    I BELIEVE I WAS IN PARIS    

864
00:46:49,747 --> 00:46:53,098
       AND LIVING A VERY,       
       VERY SPLENDID LIFE.      

865
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,200
     IT WAS VERY, VERY GOOD.    

866
00:46:55,202 --> 00:46:58,337
   I WAS WORKING FOR A BRANCH   
      OF<i> STARS AND STRIPES</i>      

867
00:46:58,339 --> 00:46:59,287
       CALLED<i> ARMY TALKS,</i>       

868
00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:02,524
      WHICH WAS A MAGAZINE      
        THAT WAS PUT OUT,       

869
00:47:02,526 --> 00:47:04,559
   AND TRAVELING RATHER FREELY  

870
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:06,262
  AND HAD SOME NICE GIRLFRIENDS 

871
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:09,764
  AND A VERY, VERY INTERESTING, 
      MATURE GROUP OF GUYS      

872
00:47:09,766 --> 00:47:16,154
    WHO EDUCATED ME MORE THAN   
  THE COLLEGE HAD EDUCATED ME.  

873
00:47:16,156 --> 00:47:17,956
          THEY WERE --          

874
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:20,959
     AND WHEN THE WAR ENDED     
            IN JAPAN,           

875
00:47:20,961 --> 00:47:25,898
 IT WASN'T THE GREAT CELEBRATION
         TO PARISIANERS.        

876
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,999
      BUT TO WE IN THE ARMY     

877
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:31,887
 WHO THOUGHT MAYBE WE'D GET SENT
     TO JAPAN OR SOMETHING,     

878
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:33,622
   IT WAS A GREAT CELEBRATION.  

879
00:47:33,624 --> 00:47:36,875
   AND PARIS IS A GREAT PLACE   
          TO CELEBRATE.         

880
00:47:36,877 --> 00:47:40,813
         SO WE DID LOTS         
      OF CELEBRATING THERE,     

881
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:45,150
      QUITE UNLIKE V-E DAY.     

882
00:47:45,152 --> 00:47:47,736
      YOU KNOW, I DID SHOOT     
      AT A FELLOW ONE TIME.     

883
00:47:47,738 --> 00:47:52,023
    AND IT WAS IN BAYREUTH...   

884
00:47:52,025 --> 00:47:53,859
       THE HOME OF WAGNER.      

885
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:57,730
      AND THERE WAS A RIVER     
  THAT SPLIT THE TOWN IN HALF.  

886
00:47:57,732 --> 00:48:00,499
       AND WE'D MOVED DOWN      
          TO THE RIVER.         

887
00:48:00,501 --> 00:48:02,701
  AND WE WERE IN A LITTLE BAR.  

888
00:48:02,703 --> 00:48:05,220
        AND IN OUR RADIO,       

889
00:48:05,222 --> 00:48:08,207
         IT CAME THROUGH        
    FROM WAY UP IN BACK OF US   

890
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:10,642
     THAT THERE WAS A SQUAD     
           OF GERMANS           

891
00:48:10,644 --> 00:48:14,079
      COMING DOWN THE ROAD      
        THAT WE WERE AT.        

892
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:16,264
      AND WE WATCHED THEM,      
       AND THEY CAME DOWN.      

893
00:48:16,266 --> 00:48:18,933
   AND THEY WENT IN A BUILDING  
       ACROSS THE STREET.       

894
00:48:18,935 --> 00:48:22,153
    AND WE REALLY DIDN'T WANT   
     TO PUT UP A BIG FIGHT.     

895
00:48:22,155 --> 00:48:24,756
  BUT PRETTY SOON ONE CAME OUT  
          AND CAME DOWN         

896
00:48:24,758 --> 00:48:29,127
  AND LOOKED AT THE BRIDGE THAT 
 HAD BEEN BLOWN THAT WE WERE IN,

897
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:32,681
    THEN TROTTED UP THE ROAD    
        A COUPLE BLOCKS.        

898
00:48:32,683 --> 00:48:36,602
AND WE THOUGHT, "WELL, THE SQUAD
   UP THERE WILL PICK HIM UP."  

899
00:48:36,604 --> 00:48:38,787
          PRETTY SOON,          
     HE CAME TROTTING BACK.     

900
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:41,072
         SO WE REALIZED         
     THERE'S NO SQUAD THERE.    

901
00:48:41,074 --> 00:48:45,910
       SO EVERYBODY SAID,       
   "WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT HIM?"   

902
00:48:45,912 --> 00:48:47,012
      "NO, YOU SHOOT HIM."      

903
00:48:47,014 --> 00:48:50,115
           I ENDED UP           
      HAVING TO SHOOT HIM.      

904
00:48:50,117 --> 00:48:53,218
   AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW,   
        I WAS OUT THERE.        

905
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,252
     HE FLEW UP IN THE AIR,     

906
00:48:54,254 --> 00:48:58,056
         AND TWO OF US,         
     THE NEXT THING WE KNEW,    

907
00:48:58,058 --> 00:49:01,409
 WE WERE OUT THERE NURSING HIM. 

908
00:49:01,411 --> 00:49:05,214
   AND THEN THE SQUAD CAME OUT  
     FROM ACROSS THE STREET     

909
00:49:05,216 --> 00:49:07,599
       THAT'S THE ONLY ONE      
      I'M EVER SURE I SHOT.     

910
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:09,868
     I SHOT AT LOTS AND LOTS    
           OF THINGS.           

911
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:12,304
  BUT YOU'RE SHOOTING AT SMOKE. 

912
00:49:12,306 --> 00:49:15,007
     AT WHERE YOU COULD SEE     
  MACHINE-GUN FIRE COMING FROM. 

913
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:18,761
   YOU WERE SHOOTING AT TANKS,  
       WHICH WAS USELESS.       

914
00:49:18,763 --> 00:49:20,362
         YOU NEVER KNEW         
      WHAT YOU WERE DOING.      

915
00:49:20,364 --> 00:49:23,965
  THIS WAS THE ONLY CASE WHERE  
 YOU COULD REALLY SEE SOMEBODY. 

916
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:25,767
    AND NOBODY REALLY WANTED    
            TO DO IT.           

917
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:28,653
          HERE HE WAS,          
    AND HE WAS DOING NO HARM.   

918
00:49:28,655 --> 00:49:31,706
        AND HE WAS REALLY       
     JUST TRYING TO RETREAT.    

919
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:36,561
      BUT WE COULDN'T THINK     
   OF ANY OTHER WAY TO DO IT.   

920
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:41,833
  OUR MOVIE STARS IN THOSE DAYS 

921
00:49:41,835 --> 00:49:44,586
   WERE GUYS LIKE JAMES CAGNEY  
       AND HUMPHREY BOGART      

922
00:49:44,588 --> 00:49:47,872
     AND EDWARD G. ROBINSON     
         AND THOSE GUYS.        

923
00:49:47,874 --> 00:49:50,475
         AND WE GREW UP         
      ON ADVENTURE STORIES.     

924
00:49:50,477 --> 00:49:53,244
       WHAT IS THE REASON       
      FOR A STORY TO EXIST?     

925
00:49:53,246 --> 00:49:57,481
     IT'S TO TAKE YOU OUT OF    
   A DRAB EXISTENCE, ISN'T IT,  

926
00:49:57,483 --> 00:49:59,016
     INTO A DIFFERENT WORLD?    

927
00:49:59,018 --> 00:50:00,952
    THAT WAS HOW WE GREW UP.    

928
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:02,320
    AND THOSE WERE OUR AIMS.    

929
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:07,291
AND WHEN THE REAL WAR BROKE OUT,
    IT DID GIVE MANY OF US --   

930
00:50:07,293 --> 00:50:09,827
     MANY LATINOS ENLISTED,     
           THOUSANDS.           

931
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:13,197
       AND I SUSPECT THAT       
   IN THE BACK OF THEIR MINDS,  

932
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:18,102
     THERE WAS JAMES CAGNEY     
 DOING HIS THING IN A WAR MOVIE 

933
00:50:18,104 --> 00:50:19,187
          OR SOMETHING.         

934
00:50:19,189 --> 00:50:22,724
  BUT THEY DID OKAY IN REALITY. 

935
00:50:23,508 --> 00:50:24,675
     ESPECIALLY IN IWO JIMA,    

936
00:50:24,677 --> 00:50:30,865
 WE DID FIND MANY, MANY JAPANESE
   WHO HAD KILLED THEMSELVES.   

937
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:33,618
     THEY BLEW THEMSELVES UP    
       WITH HAND GRENADES.      

938
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:37,288
  THEY DISEMBOWELED THEMSELVES  
       WITH THEIR KNIVES.       

939
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,390
         AND SOMETIMES,         

940
00:50:39,392 --> 00:50:44,128
 WHEN WE THREATEN TO BLOW THEIR 
  CAVES UP AND BURY THEM ALIVE, 

941
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,948
     THEY, IN AFFECT, SAID,     
"SCREW YOU. GO AHEAD AND DO IT."

942
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:48,866
           AND WE DID.          

943
00:50:48,868 --> 00:50:51,319
 WE BURIED A LOT OF THEM ALIVE. 

944
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:53,905
          OUR ATTITUDE          
   WAS "BETTER THEM THAN US."   

945
00:50:53,907 --> 00:50:56,890
       AND WE HAD A SAYING      
     IN THE MARINE CORPS --     

946
00:50:56,892 --> 00:50:59,777
    THE JAPANESE WANT TO DIE    
        FOR THE EMPEROR,        

947
00:50:59,779 --> 00:51:01,446
    AND WE WANT TO HELP THEM.   

948
00:51:01,448 --> 00:51:04,732
   AND TIT'S THAT SIMPLE. IT.   

949
00:51:04,734 --> 00:51:05,733
        YOU'RE IN A WAR.        

950
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:07,618
 YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE FEELING -- 

951
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,119
    YOU FEEL SORRY FOR A GUY    
          WHEN YOU SEE          

952
00:51:09,121 --> 00:51:12,990
 THAT HE HELD A HAND GRENADE TO 
 HIS BELLY AND BLEW HIMSELF UP, 

953
00:51:12,992 --> 00:51:15,292
        BUT VERY BRIEFLY.       

954
00:51:15,294 --> 00:51:19,747
  WHO, POTENTIALLY, MIGHT HAVE  
 KILLED OR ONE OF YOUR BUDDIES. 

955
00:51:19,749 --> 00:51:21,532
     THEY WERE TOUGH PEOPLE.    

956
00:51:21,534 --> 00:51:24,602
  SO, YOU KNOW, IF THEY WANTED  
     TO BLOW THEMSELVES UP,     

957
00:51:24,604 --> 00:51:27,638
      THAT WAS ONE LESS GUY     
          TO NAIL YOU.          

958
00:51:28,673 --> 00:51:30,458
        AND THE SHELLING        
         WAS SO INTENSE         

959
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,042
   I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA LOSE   
            MY MIND.            

960
00:51:32,044 --> 00:51:36,213
 AND I THOUGHT, "GEE, I'VE BEEN 
 IN THIS TOO DAMN LONG ALREADY. 

961
00:51:36,215 --> 00:51:37,315
    I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE."   

962
00:51:37,317 --> 00:51:39,984
   BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL   
             LATER,             

963
00:51:39,986 --> 00:51:43,154
        WHEN WE WERE TOLD       
       ABOUT THAT DEFENSE,      

964
00:51:43,156 --> 00:51:45,256
 HOW EFFECTIVE THAT DEFENSE WAS 

965
00:51:45,258 --> 00:51:48,476
     AND HOW MUCH ARTILLERY     
         WE WERE TAKING.        

966
00:51:48,478 --> 00:51:49,894
      I THOUGHT IT WAS ME.      

967
00:51:49,896 --> 00:51:51,579
    THAT WAS MY WORST MOMENT.   

968
00:51:51,581 --> 00:51:54,999
           THAT NIGHT,          
        WE WERE GATHERED.       

969
00:51:55,001 --> 00:51:58,018
  AND THE LIEUTENANT CAME OVER, 
          AND HE SAID,          

970
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,204
      "IF WE'RE DRIVEN OFF      
           THE BEACH,           

971
00:52:00,206 --> 00:52:02,924
       TRY TO SWIM TOWARDS      
        THE TRANSPORTS."        

972
00:52:02,926 --> 00:52:05,793
     AND WE THOUGHT, "JESUS,    
    WHAT IS HE SAYING TO US?"   

973
00:52:05,795 --> 00:52:09,380
 I KNOW THAT SOUNDS RIDICULOUS, 
 BUT THEY ACTUALLY TOLD US THAT.

974
00:52:09,382 --> 00:52:11,048
      "IF WE'RE DRIVEN OFF      
           THE BEACH,           

975
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,085
         START SWIMMING         
      FOR THE TRANSPORTS."      

976
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:17,154
       I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW       
       HOW TO SWIM RIGHT.       

977
00:52:17,156 --> 00:52:18,923
       I SINK LIKE A ROCK.      

978
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:22,243
             FOR US,            
   IT WAS LIKE THE JAPANESE --  

979
00:52:22,245 --> 00:52:24,796
    IT WAS DO IT OR TOO BAD.    

980
00:52:28,933 --> 00:52:33,503
WE MET THE CADETS WHEN THEY WERE
   TRAINING OVER IN PENSACOLA.  

981
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:39,209
  AND I HAD ONE CUTE BOYFRIEND  
    WHO WAS FROM THE MIDWEST.   

982
00:52:39,211 --> 00:52:43,813
 AND WHEN HE KNEW HE WOULD HAVE 
      SATURDAY NIGHT FREE,      

983
00:52:43,815 --> 00:52:47,784
HE WOULD FLY HIS TRAINING FLIGHT
           OVER MOBILE          

984
00:52:47,786 --> 00:52:50,570
          AND DIVE DOWN         
    AND BUZZ MY HOUSE TWICE.    

985
00:52:50,572 --> 00:52:54,941
  AND THAT WAY, I KNEW HE'D BE  
    OVER THAT SATURDAY NIGHT.   

986
00:52:54,943 --> 00:52:57,527
      AND I WAS NOT TO DATE     
          ANYONE ELSE.          

987
00:52:57,529 --> 00:53:01,031
          I WAS TO SAVE         
 THAT SATURDAY NIGHT FOR NORMAN.

988
00:53:01,033 --> 00:53:06,502
  SO I HAD AN OLD-MAID NEIGHBOR 
       ACROSS THE STREET.       

989
00:53:06,504 --> 00:53:12,925
SHE'D SIT ON HER FRONT PORCH AND
 WAIT TO SEE IF WE'D BE BUZZED. 

990
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:16,563
   SHE'D COMING RUNNING ACROSS  
      THE PARKWAY OUT HERE,     

991
00:53:16,565 --> 00:53:18,765
            YELLING,            
    "KATHARINE, HE'S COMING!    

992
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:22,469
           "KATHERINE,          
      HE'S COMING TONIGHT!      

993
00:53:22,471 --> 00:53:29,108
     WAS ALERTED TO WHETHER     
   SO,HE WOULD COME OR NOT.OD   

994
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:34,847
      WELL, THE LAST PERSON     
 WE THOUGHT WOULD EVER BE KILLED

995
00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:38,701
  WAS MY UNCLE CHARLIE TUCKER.  

996
00:53:38,703 --> 00:53:42,338
   HE WAS SUCH A MACHO PERSON.  

997
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,358
  HE JUST DID EVERYTHING WELL.  

998
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,693
    AND WE JUST NEVER THOUGHT   

999
00:53:47,695 --> 00:53:50,029
      ANYTHING WOULD HAPPEN     
           TO CHARLIE.          

1000
00:53:50,031 --> 00:53:52,866
  IF ANYONE WOULD COME THROUGH  
            THE WAR,            

1001
00:53:52,868 --> 00:53:54,200
      IT WOULD BE CHARLIE.      

1002
00:53:54,202 --> 00:53:56,419
     SO, WHEN THE NEWS CAME     

1003
00:53:56,421 --> 00:54:02,725
    THAT CHARLIE WAS MISSING    
    IN ACTION AT GUADALCANAL,   

1004
00:54:02,727 --> 00:54:05,111
       WE WERE DEVASTATED.      

1005
00:54:05,113 --> 00:54:08,898
        WE KEPT THINKING        
     THEY WOULD FIND HIS --     

1006
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,384
  FIND HIM ON AN ISLAND ALIVE.  

1007
00:54:11,386 --> 00:54:16,706
 WE KEPT THINKING THAT MAYBE HIS
  PLANE HAD GONE DOWN SOMEPLACE 

1008
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:20,226
    WHERE HE COULD GET ASHORE   
          AND BE SAVED.         

1009
00:54:20,228 --> 00:54:24,097
            IN FACT,            
    BEFORE WE FINALLY GAVE UP   

1010
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:26,549
   THAT THEY WOULD NEVER FIND   
             CHARLIE            

1011
00:54:26,551 --> 00:54:31,354
  BECAUSE WE JUST DID NOT THINK 
    THE LORD WOULD TAKE HIM.    

1012
00:54:31,356 --> 00:54:33,340
          BUT YOU KNOW          
      THE WONDERFUL THING?      

1013
00:54:33,342 --> 00:54:36,075
     HE STAYS 22 YEARS OLD.     

1014
00:54:36,077 --> 00:54:37,894
              THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. 

1015
00:54:40,231 --> 00:54:44,817
 I MADE UP MY MIND THAT I WOULD 
  NEVER MARRY A MAN IN UNIFORM  

1016
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:46,552
  BECAUSE I LOVED THE UNIFORMS. 

1017
00:54:46,554 --> 00:54:49,939
          SO I THOUGHT,         
  WELL, MAYBE I WOULD MARRY HIM 

1018
00:54:49,941 --> 00:54:53,326
      AND REALIZE I DIDN'T      
       LIKE HIM AT ALL --       

1019
00:54:53,328 --> 00:54:55,178
  THAT IT WAS ALL THE UNIFORM.  

1020
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,849
       SO I DID NOT MARRY       
       TILL AFTER THE WAR       

1021
00:54:59,851 --> 00:55:03,169
         BECAUSE OF THAT        
      AS MUCH AS ANYTHING.      

1022
00:55:03,171 --> 00:55:07,590
     AND THE MAN I DID MARRY    
        HAD ON A UNIFORM,       

1023
00:55:07,592 --> 00:55:10,026
  BUT IT WAS A PILOT'S UNIFORM. 

1024
00:55:10,028 --> 00:55:13,713
       AND I NEVER SAW HIM      
    IN HIS DRESS NAVY UNIFORM   

1025
00:55:13,715 --> 00:55:15,615
   TILL THE DAY I MARRIED HIM.  

1026
00:55:15,617 --> 00:55:18,217
 AND HE WORE IT IN OUR WEDDING. 

1027
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:21,638
              SO --             
  OH, AND I DID LIKE HIM IN IT. 

1028
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,440
          I REALLY DID.
