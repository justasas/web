00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:26,527
NEWSREEL: An army of 150,000 men,
women and children

2
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,287
invaded an American city -

3
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:31,687
whites, Negroes, Indians,
Creoles, Cajuns.

4
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:34,207
They came from
every corner of the land.

5
00:00:34,207 --> 00:00:36,687
Their roots
in every curve of the globe -

6
00:00:36,687 --> 00:00:39,047
Moscow, Indiana,
Warsaw, North Dakota,

7
00:00:39,047 --> 00:00:41,287
Hamburg, California,
Milan, Missouri,

8
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:43,007
Baghdad, Kentucky.

9
00:00:43,007 --> 00:00:46,767
Some came out of patriotism,
some out of grim necessity,

10
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:48,647
some for a richer life.

11
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:51,727
All came to do a war job.

12
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:54,247
These are the people - a few of them.

13
00:00:54,247 --> 00:00:56,047
Thousands more
storm through these gates

14
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:58,402
on the graveyard shift
and the swing shift.

15
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:06,807
These are the jobs they came to fill.
Just a few of them.

16
00:01:06,807 --> 00:01:10,087
40,000 workers
in two great shipyards,

17
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:13,287
repairing and refitting the torpedoed
vessels of the Allied nations

18
00:01:13,287 --> 00:01:15,847
in giant dry vessels for
the Battle of the Atlantic.

19
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:19,287
The shipyards are the main war job.

20
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:23,207
But while these men and women
weld and rivet and file and plate,

21
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:25,607
tens of thousands more
are working round the clock

22
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:28,687
in the steel mills, the paper mills,
the gypsum plant,

23
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:32,247
the aluminum plant,
the Army Air Corps repair field,

24
00:01:32,247 --> 00:01:35,717
and countless machine shops,
foundries, lumber and textile mills.

25
00:01:48,247 --> 00:01:51,287
This could be any one of
a hundred great American war centres.

26
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:53,687
It happens to be Mobile, Alabama.

27
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:56,963
But the story is the same
in every war town in America.

28
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:05,407
150,000 people,
10 full military divisions,

29
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:08,487
the civilian equivalent of
Rommel's entire African army,

30
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:10,127
bivouacked without warning

31
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:13,085
in the narrow confines
of one peaceful southern city.

32
00:02:14,487 --> 00:02:15,967
Less than three years ago,

33
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,767
you might have walked blocks in
Mobile without encountering a person.

34
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:21,884
Today, you stop to scratch your head
and a line forms behind you.

35
00:02:23,847 --> 00:02:26,647
No wonder there's such a chaos
and congestion of traffic.

36
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,847
And one has to butt one's way
into buses at the plants

37
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:31,997
and elbow through thick crowds again
in town.

38
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,687
Crowds everywhere.

39
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:44,245
Crowds at the pay windows.

40
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:49,279
Block-long lines of white-collar
workers outside restaurants.

41
00:02:50,287 --> 00:02:52,167
Thirsty shipyard workers on payday

42
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:55,523
waiting their turn outside
the state-controlled liquor stores.

43
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,727
Overcrowded schools
staffed with weary teachers

44
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:01,447
working in double shifts.

45
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,927
And still 3,000 in-migrant workers'
children

46
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:07,087
had to stay at home this year

47
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,885
until accommodations to care for them
are rushed to completion.

48
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:18,407
Dingy cafes crowded to the doors.

49
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:21,319
And makeshift tent dance halls
in crammed amusement parks.

50
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:31,287
Old Mobile - sedate, grand old lady
in crinoline and iron lace -

51
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:35,847
thrust aside 240 years of history
and tradition,

52
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:38,887
rolled up her leg-of-mutton sleeves
and pitched in

53
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:43,487
to solve the complex problems
created by 150,000 strangers

54
00:03:43,487 --> 00:03:46,007
dropped without warning,
and for the duration,

55
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:49,238
into the lap of a little city
of only 78,000.

56
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:53,767
Every available room
was canvassed, utilised.

57
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,087
Many an old magnolia-shaded mansion
is now the roost of

58
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:58,887
an orchestra leader-turned-expediter,

59
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:00,923
a bond salesman-turned-leaderman.

60
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:03,927
Old warehouses were reopened

61
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:06,600
and peopled with shipyard workers
and airplane mechanics.

62
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:09,487
This was
an upholstering establishment

63
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:13,207
converted into a dormitory
for women war workers.

64
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,287
This was a neighbourhood
grocery store.

65
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:18,006
These girls - welders, checkers
and machinists.

66
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:26,567
This was a garage, now a barracks -

67
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:29,127
emergency housing for war workers.

68
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:32,961
This man is one - a pipe fitter
just checking in from San Francisco.

69
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:39,647
Here, there, everywhere -

70
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,647
on vacant lots and fields
and creek banks,

71
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:45,367
trailer camps, tent colonies
and shantytowns -

72
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,562
all facilities were overloaded.

73
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:52,047
In outlying sections of the city,

74
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:55,327
housewives, to make sure
of water for their daily needs,

75
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:57,447
set their alarms
for two in the morning

76
00:04:57,447 --> 00:04:58,927
to fill buckets and pans

77
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:01,687
for tomorrow's drinking
and washing and cooking.

78
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:03,567
Mobile's understaffed
Health Department

79
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:05,047
worked day and night

80
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:08,607
on what was really a national
rather than a local civic problem

81
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:12,805
to provide basic sanitation,
water supply and waste disposal.

82
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:21,207
But still they poured into Mobile
from every corner of the nation -

83
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:23,687
farmers, clerks
and little businessmen,

84
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:26,527
Indians, Okies, cowboys
and cotton pickers,

85
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:30,327
hillbillies, Tennessee horse traders
and South American gypsies -

86
00:05:30,327 --> 00:05:34,287
answering the government's call
for more and more war workers.

87
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:36,887
Many of them accustomed to
better things.

88
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:40,277
Others just in from the brush
where they use possums for yard dogs.

89
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,847
In Mobile, as in
every other war town,

90
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:45,847
the same acute problem arose -

91
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:47,327
homes for workers,

92
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:50,046
housing for the in-migrant armies
of industry.

93
00:06:16,287 --> 00:06:18,687
Mobile, as every American city
of any size,

94
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:20,807
had its slums before the war,

95
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,767
but when a nation is at war,

96
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:25,567
it becomes clear that
the health and welfare of each

97
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,364
affects the health and welfare
of all.

98
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,607
Lack of comfort, lack of rest,

99
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,847
illness breeding
in conditions like these

100
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:34,767
mean time lost from production.

101
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:36,247
Each citizen living poorly

102
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:39,364
weakens the fabric of the society
in which all of us live.

103
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,407
These people
and these conditions too

104
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:44,807
suddenly become a problem to be faced

105
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:48,847
in solving the health and housing
complexities of a congested war town.

106
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:50,567
The government stepped in.

107
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:52,327
Vast housing projects were initiated

108
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:55,087
and opened at low rentals
to war workers

109
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:57,527
certified by the personnel
and housing officers

110
00:06:57,527 --> 00:07:00,325
operated by the plants
in which they worked.

111
00:07:02,127 --> 00:07:03,767
By January 1 of this year,

112
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:08,127
Congress had appropriated
over $2 billion for emergency housing

113
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,924
in America's war boom towns.

114
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:12,838
Here's how some of it was spent
in Mobile.

115
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,007
These are the slums we have seen.

116
00:07:17,007 --> 00:07:20,127
Slum clearance projects had been
the local private enterprise

117
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:22,880
of a few high-minded,
far-sighted individuals.

118
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:26,207
But in Mobile, such projects as these

119
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,207
have become one of the obligations of
good government.

120
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:32,367
They're being written off
as part of the cost of building

121
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,403
ships and planes and tanks and guns.

122
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:49,407
They are rented only to
certified coloured war workers,

123
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:52,087
and are equipped with auditoriums,
playgrounds and day nurseries

124
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:53,847
to take care of the children

125
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:56,520
while their parents
are working in the war plants.

126
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:12,807
Dormitory units for men and women,

127
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:16,487
accommodating from 400 to 1,200
single workers.

128
00:08:16,487 --> 00:08:19,967
Equipped with recreational
facilities, barber shops, gymnasiums,

129
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,167
hospitals, community centres
and low-cost cafeterias -

130
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,397
whole towns in themselves.

131
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:40,527
Government-owned trailers
moved in to meet the emergency

132
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:43,485
for rent as low as $15 a month
per family.

133
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:49,247
1,700 units to accommodate
7,000 war workers and their families.

134
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,407
Modern, sanitary and scientific -

135
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,007
built by the Maritime Commission

136
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:56,204
and adjoining the shipyards in which
their occupants are employed.

137
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,407
These 2- and 4-family dwellings

138
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,607
are typical of many of
the smaller projects

139
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:05,644
that are being rushed to completion
on the outskirts of Mobile.

140
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:19,247
Day nurseries to care for
the children of women war workers

141
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:21,807
are another problem the government
is undertaking to solve.

142
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:26,607
Five small nurseries
to 150,000 people is inadequate.

143
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:30,487
But more are planned to counteract
an important contributing cause

144
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,559
of absenteeism and loss of
valuable production time.

145
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,367
For those that can afford them,

146
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,607
there are modern, permanent homes
like these,

147
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:44,807
built with the help of FHA loans

148
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:46,407
and put on the market

149
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:48,284
at rentals compatible with
government ceilings.

150
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:55,287
Decent housing, medical care,
adequate transportation -

151
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:59,644
as each of these problems is met,
the ratio of production increases.

152
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,480
In the shipyards alone,
this is already evident.

153
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,718
At the beginning, one ship
was launched every six weeks.

154
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:13,198
Today, cargo and combat vessels
slide down the ways one every week.

155
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:18,246
And the story of Mobile is the story
of every American war town.
