1
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:10,407
I knew from the beginning that
I wanted to fight my war in the air.

2
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:13,967
There seemed to be
some sort of an appeal about it,

3
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:16,127
or a sense of excitement,

4
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:18,207
so that was my objective.

5
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:21,527
So within three weeks of Pearl Harbor,

6
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:23,887
I went out to Fort Lewis, Washington

7
00:00:23,887 --> 00:00:26,687
to apply to the Army Air Corps.

8
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:28,687
I wanted to become a fighter pilot.

9
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:32,087
And much to my surprise,

10
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:34,087
I failed a colour vision test.

11
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:38,647
And I continued to take the test
at other locations

12
00:00:38,647 --> 00:00:40,967
over a period of time,

13
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:45,207
until, gradually, I memorised
what I should see -

14
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:48,007
what numbers and symbols
I should see in the test -

15
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,007
and then I passed it.

16
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:54,207
But it was not until
I got to Anchorage, Alaska

17
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:57,167
and I was working
for the corps of engineers

18
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:59,367
while I was still trying to get into service,

19
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:01,367
and I passed it up there,

20
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:04,564
in early August of 1942.

21
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:12,047
That is, the day they were killed,
we talked about the circumstances,

22
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:16,767
and we packed up their things,

23
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:21,047
and maybe at the officers club
that night, if we went in there,

24
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:25,287
we might talk a little bit about what
the angle of the flak had been

25
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:29,917
so we could try to avoid
certain approaches on targets.

26
00:01:31,087 --> 00:01:34,287
But then we never
talked about them again.

27
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:36,607
We never talked about them again.

28
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:39,647
It's just as if they did not exist.

29
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:44,207
Yet, the killing we did

30
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:46,407
haunted us all the time.

31
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:49,887
We thought about... or, I did -
I can't speak for the others.

32
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:55,086
But it was the killing - the numbers of...

33
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:08,247
Orders were being prepared

34
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:13,487
to send me to a fighter squadron -
fighter group -

35
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:15,687
flying off Okinawa,

36
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:18,838
to participate in the invasion of Japan.

37
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:23,767
And when the atomic bomb
was dropped on Hiroshima,

38
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:27,967
on August 6, 1945,

39
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:33,167
and we started to comprehend
what this meant.

40
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:37,807
And then the second was dropped
on Nagasaki, four days later,

41
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:41,487
we realised that our war was over,

42
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:44,604
and that we were going to
live through this thing.

43
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:52,127
I can't believe that it ended
like that, so fast,

44
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:55,687
and those of us that were primed again,

45
00:02:55,687 --> 00:03:00,327
fortified psychologically and emotionally
to go back to war,

46
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:03,047
were now reprieved,

47
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:05,807
and we would be able
to go on with our life.

48
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:08,367
I've never been able to understand

49
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:13,919
the objection to the fact
that the atomic bomb was dropped.

50
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:20,047
We just burned all the adrenaline
our body could produce,

51
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:24,087
and sometimes when we would
come home and land our aeroplane

52
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:28,967
and taxi up to our hardstand
and turn off the engines,

53
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:34,567
we would just collapse,
just sitting there in the cockpit.

54
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:37,047
There was nothing else left.

55
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:40,367
We had burned all the adrenaline,

56
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:44,167
we had used all the energy that we had,
and we just...

57
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:47,398
Sometimes I had to be helped
out of the cockpit.

58
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:58,407
Fellow who owned the building...
(Clears throat)

59
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,927
...said that we had to leave

60
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:04,767
because his son was
coming home from the Pacific.

61
00:04:04,767 --> 00:04:06,527
His son had been injured,

62
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:09,967
and he didn't want any 'Japs'
in his apartment building.

63
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,927
And so she gave us notice,

64
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:14,007
and I said,
"But my sister-in-law is pregnant.

65
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:16,447
"She's expecting in August,
end of August."

66
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:18,847
The baby was born about the 21 st.

67
00:04:18,847 --> 00:04:23,047
But he's... he was adamant,

68
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:25,567
and so we looked in the papers,
and St Paul was just...

69
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:27,167
...there was no place to be rented.

70
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:30,167
We went after ad after ad,
looking at places.

71
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,647
They were just little, you know...

72
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,847
...places not really livable, to me.

73
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:39,407
My sister-in-law and I both went
to check them out.

74
00:04:39,407 --> 00:04:41,447
She was pregnant
and it was such a chore.

75
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,407
And so finally, I said, "You know what?

76
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:45,887
"I'm going to go over
and talk to this fellow."

77
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:48,447
First of all, I went at the front,
and his wife...

78
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:50,647
It was a Sunday
and it was a beautiful day,

79
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:53,487
and his wife and her friends
were sitting in the front.

80
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:55,647
And I said, "I'd like to talk to Mr Lauer."

81
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:57,887
"Mr Lauer is in the back.
He's watering."

82
00:04:57,887 --> 00:04:59,847
So I walked to the back of the garden,

83
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:02,847
and he wouldn't turn off the hose
at first - he saw who I was.

84
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,527
And on top of that,
he was very hard of hearing.

85
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:08,407
So I said, "Mr Lauer,
I need to talk to you!"

86
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:12,687
And I told him - I said, "You know,
my husband is in the Pacific.

87
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,207
"He's with military intelligence.

88
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:18,687
"He's fighting side-by-side with your son
and others like your son."

89
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:20,687
And I said, "I'm sorry
that he was injured,

90
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,247
"but you just have to understand

91
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:24,327
"that we're on the same side,
and my husband..."

92
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:25,927
You know, I made this plea,

93
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:28,767
and "Eh?" and a couple of times
he couldn't hear,

94
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:31,167
and then finally he turned off
his hose and he listened,

95
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:34,567
and didn't say yes, no or anything.

96
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,047
He didn't comment.

97
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:39,207
And so I went away, thinking,
"Well, I tried my best."

98
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:42,527
And I left and didn't hear anything after.

99
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,487
We just... we were able to stay.

100
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:47,807
So I thought,
"Well, it must have worked."

101
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:49,807
So I guess I reached him.

102
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,767
And I told him, I said,
"Be sure to ask your son,

103
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,447
"'cause he'll tell you that these
Nisei boys are fighting with you,

104
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:58,199
"you know, fighting
with them right there."

105
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:06,047
He was two years older than I was,

106
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:10,247
but it seemed like he needed my help
more than I needed his.

107
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:14,167
He was a sweet kid, easily, um...

108
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:19,207
...so agreeable, and a little bit gullible,
you know?

109
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:20,927
And very good-looking.

110
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,687
And I just felt that he needed me,

111
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:29,407
and him leaving like that
really broke my heart, I tell you.

112
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,047
And, of course, my mother -

113
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:33,967
that meant two boys
now were in the service.

114
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:36,807
And, um...

115
00:06:36,807 --> 00:06:41,847
...it was really hard to give them up.

116
00:06:41,847 --> 00:06:45,407
From his letters, you couldn't tell.

117
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:49,047
He was a reserved person,

118
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:53,287
and I don't think he wanted us to know,

119
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,727
because he was probably protective
of Mother and I,

120
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:58,367
and my other brother.

121
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:01,527
He's a wonderful guy, anyway.

122
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:04,527
No, he never, never complained.

123
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:06,447
We lived with that.

124
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:11,367
That was part of our part we had to play.

125
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:15,367
He never got a chance to go to a camp
to regroup or whatever,

126
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:18,287
rest and relaxation or be analysed.

127
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:23,207
And a friend of his, a Fresno boy
that was a friend of both of us,

128
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:27,167
came back from over there,
and he had seen him in Germany.

129
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:32,161
And he said, "He looked terrible,
and I think they should send him home."

130
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,967
Well, it didn't happen,

131
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:38,927
and when he did get discharged
and came home,

132
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:41,327
he came to Sacramento

133
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:46,687
and stayed with us for about
two days, or three days.

134
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,407
He seemed fine.

135
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:50,727
He was kind of a quiet kid anyway,

136
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:54,527
so there was no way for me to know.

137
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,567
I didn't detect anything,

138
00:07:56,567 --> 00:08:00,560
that he was really suffering from trauma.

139
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:05,367
So he went home
to my mother in Fresno,

140
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:11,847
and inside of a week,
she was calling me and telling me

141
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:16,847
that she thought my brother was
having some problems, emotionally.

142
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:18,767
I guess his...

143
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:22,687
...it was overpowering, I guess,
the depression and the trauma,

144
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:24,727
and stress of it all,

145
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:29,127
until he just hung himself
from the kitchen light

146
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:31,197
and my mother came in and found him.

147
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:36,447
Yeah. So...

148
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:39,405
Yeah. He was 22.

149
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,562
War can be rough.

150
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:53,437
My poor mother.
She was never quite the same.

151
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:06,087
My grandfather
trained me to be a warrior.

152
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,607
The intertribal war days were over.

153
00:09:09,607 --> 00:09:14,761
But being... (Clears throat)... uh...

154
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:20,007
...a warrior in his time,

155
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:23,847
before the reservation was settled,

156
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:28,687
he kept training me to become a warrior.

157
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:34,527
Then, of course,
I would ride horses all my life.

158
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:37,041
Ever since I was a little boy.

159
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,837
But in the wintertime...

160
00:09:42,647 --> 00:09:45,247
...he would wake me up
early in the morning.

161
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:49,247
Said, "Alright - don't put your shoes on,
don't put your clothes on."

162
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:52,687
Running round the house, barefooted.

163
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:55,927
Maybe 15, 20 below zero.

164
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:58,807
Every morning,

165
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:03,447
it was tradition with those old Indian men

166
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:05,887
to take a dip in the river.

167
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:09,527
So in wintertime,
we'd go to the river there -

168
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:12,327
maybe 15, 20 below zero -

169
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:16,007
we'd go to the river
and he'd cut a hole in the ice.

170
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:20,967
It was already cut, but he had
to cut it again for his horses.

171
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:27,327
So he'd remove the thin
layer of snow, uh, ice,

172
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,967
then we'd go in there.

173
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:32,127
I tell you, that's pretty cold, you know.

174
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:35,887
He trained me to be physically strong.

175
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:38,687
By his training,

176
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:44,398
and my observing the activities
around me, in my environment...

177
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:53,087
...the movement of the animals
and the blowing of the wind,

178
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:55,207
direction and so forth.

179
00:10:55,207 --> 00:11:01,047
So I was generally well aware

180
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:04,047
of what I'm doing
and what I'm going to do.

181
00:11:04,047 --> 00:11:06,447
So during World War II,

182
00:11:06,447 --> 00:11:09,167
I was not afraid -

183
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:14,567
I knew what I was doing
and I knew I was going to be alright.

184
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:19,357
So he trained me that way, mentally.

185
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:23,247
I was ready to go overseas.

186
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:29,647
And a cousin of mine
had just come back from Europe.

187
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:34,127
He was a tail gunner.

188
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,607
And then, before he left,

189
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:39,687
a medicine man,
a sun dance medicine man -

190
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:45,127
powerful, sacred powers.

191
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:51,647
So he gave my cousin an eagle feather,

192
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:55,526
a fluffy feather, painted yellow.

193
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:02,927
"Alright," he said,
"put that inside of your helmet.

194
00:12:02,927 --> 00:12:04,807
"That's your protection."

195
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,767
That helped a lot too, you know.

196
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:13,967
So long as that sacred protective feather

197
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,447
was in my helmet,

198
00:12:16,447 --> 00:12:21,207
I was never afraid of anything.

199
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,007
I never panicked,

200
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:26,967
and I think I survived

201
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:30,887
quite adequately.

202
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:34,887
Some soldiers get excited
and get scared,

203
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,807
panic and run, and they get shot down.

204
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:41,447
But I'm always in charge of myself.

205
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:44,087
I know what the enemy's going to do,

206
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:46,087
so I was alright.

207
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:49,527
And that little medicine in there -

208
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:52,485
I think that kind of gave me that...

209
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,567
...uh...

210
00:12:55,567 --> 00:13:02,405
...feeling of having
power over myself and the enemy.

211
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:09,727
I've seen a lot of sad situations.

212
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:14,727
People getting killed, lying there.

213
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:19,167
Civilians, soldiers -

214
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:23,527
both American soldiers,
German soldiers.

215
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:30,319
And one of the worst
I've witnessed was...

216
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:38,287
...we were advancing
into this little town,

217
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:41,727
and, uh...

218
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:44,687
...and our company commander

219
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,047
stepped on a mine.

220
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:50,207
Boy. Both legs were gone.

221
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,887
There were just these stubs.

222
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:57,647
And so he was sitting there,

223
00:13:57,647 --> 00:14:01,087
and I was standing there
and couldn't help but look at him.

224
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:03,207
I was scared, you know, shook up.

225
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:07,407
And he looked at his legs
and he fell over dead.

226
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,287
He died.

227
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:11,327
That was terrible.

228
00:14:11,327 --> 00:14:12,965
Yeah, that was terrible.

229
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:19,927
I sang a song belonging to
a chief who used to live here.

230
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:23,367
A chief by the name of Grey Bull.

231
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:26,407
And he would sing that

232
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:30,607
whenever they'd meet
the Cheyennes, you know?

233
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:34,127
And when they do that,

234
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:36,087
they're ready to clash,

235
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:41,047
why, a Cheyenne medicine man
would sing a song.

236
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:47,607
I mean, a Crow medicine man
by the name of Grey Bull

237
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,087
would sing this song,

238
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:53,247
and the words would go, would say,

239
00:14:53,247 --> 00:14:56,087
"The Cheyennes are coming now

240
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:57,967
"To do battle

241
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:01,007
"Today I shall run over one of them

242
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:04,247
"Yes, I ran all over them."

243
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:08,240
All of them. So I sang that song.

244
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:18,047
First it was the dead German boys
lying all over the field of battle,

245
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:20,647
and beginning to turn yellow
and so forth,

246
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:22,167
their eyes open.

247
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:25,047
I'd never seen a cadaver
with eyes open before.

248
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:28,247
I'd seen dead people, like my relatives,
in coffins and so on.

249
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:30,127
Their eyes were always decently closed.

250
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:33,927
And when you see violently killed people,

251
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:37,007
with holes in them
and missing limbs and so on,

252
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:40,447
staring at you with open eyes
as if they were alive,

253
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:43,887
you feel terribly
disconnected from things.

254
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:46,247
Are you supposed
to say something to them?

255
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:51,247
Are you supposed to say, "I'm sorry.
Did it hurt much?" and so forth?

256
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:53,847
And I was still in command
of my platoon,

257
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:58,447
and we attacked a German position
through a smokescreen

258
00:15:58,447 --> 00:16:01,247
which was so thick that you didn't
know where you were.

259
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:02,767
It's a bizarre thing.

260
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:07,487
It was a technique dating from ground
warfare from the First World War,

261
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:09,167
but we did it anyhow.

262
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,527
And there were dead Germans
all the way along,

263
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:15,847
and people were stepping on mines
and blowing their feet off, and things.

264
00:16:15,847 --> 00:16:19,247
And my people were
relatively untouched.

265
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:22,607
And when we had to clear a woods,

266
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,287
a small woods that was separated
from everything else,

267
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:29,647
maybe a half-mile wide
and a mile long,

268
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:33,607
and the Germans had been preparing
that defensively, that position,

269
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:36,087
for months, probably since Normandy.

270
00:16:36,087 --> 00:16:39,687
And we attacked it cheerfully,
as cheerfully as we could,

271
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:42,447
running in with our rifles
at port arms and so on,

272
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:44,447
through machine-gun fire,

273
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:47,727
and a number of people
were hit and killed by that.

274
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:51,087
On my left, I remember,
I was lying on my stomach,

275
00:16:51,087 --> 00:16:54,287
trying to keep as low as possible
to avoid this machine-gun stuff

276
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:56,727
that was going on
about an inch above my head,

277
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:59,967
so close that I could feel the heat
of the bullets as they passed by.

278
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:05,927
One of these replacements,
who'd never impressed me very much,

279
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:07,847
'cause he was rather fat and clumsy,

280
00:17:07,847 --> 00:17:13,247
he kneeled up, and he was
aiming at a machine gun

281
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:14,967
some distance from us.

282
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,487
And before he could get a shot off,

283
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:20,487
they hit him

284
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,887
with, I think, about three bullets.

285
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:26,327
And I saw only his back -
I didn't see his face or anything else.

286
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:32,447
Out of his back, there flew what
looked like little clouds of dust.

287
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:37,527
But they were powdered blood,
they were bits of flesh tissue,

288
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:40,207
and they were pieces of cloth uniform.

289
00:17:40,207 --> 00:17:42,087
And about three of these came at me,

290
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:44,726
and then he collapsed,
and that was the end of him.

291
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:48,767
When I came out of the war,
I could not be recognised,

292
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,087
and I had a terrible time with my family,

293
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:53,607
'cause they'd been reading
the 'Saturday Evening Post'

294
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:55,647
and 'Life' magazine
all during the war,

295
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:59,087
and they thought it was a sort of
cheerful game that we won.

296
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:00,807
They knew I was in the infantry

297
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:03,287
but they thought that was
a branch of the service

298
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:05,007
where you did a lot of running,

299
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:07,567
you know, moving, athletic stuff
and so forth.

300
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:11,924
They had no idea that it was
about close-up killing.

301
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:17,207
The mission of the infantry,
as I learned in training many times,

302
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:20,127
was that the infantry is charged

303
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:25,967
with a mission of getting
as close as possible to the enemy

304
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,567
and destroying him,

305
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:31,845
and that means tear him to bits,
if possible.

306
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:37,687
So that was impossible for my parents
even to understand.

307
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:41,447
I had some notes, fairly bloodthirsty,
that I'd written about the war,

308
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:44,120
and I gave them to my dad afterwards
and he couldn't finish them.

309
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:47,687
About all the 'good war' stuff -

310
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:51,927
to say that I'm offended would be
a grave understatement.

311
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:56,167
I'm appalled by it,
by the lack of imagination of Americans,

312
00:18:56,167 --> 00:19:00,247
by the obligatory optimism
of Americans,

313
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:03,087
by their difficulty in understanding

314
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:09,847
the troubles of people who are
less well-placed than they are -

315
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:12,087
I'm talking about the poor,

316
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:15,407
and the infantry are the poor,
in time of war.

317
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:18,207
I've had a very difficult time, sometimes,

318
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:20,967
trying to explain what happened to me.

319
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:23,767
People say, "What's the matter?
Why are you so irritable?"

320
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:26,687
I'll say, "I'm irritable because
I thought of a college friend of mine

321
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:31,527
"who spent the war
as an admiral's aide in the Pacific

322
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:33,807
"and never fired a gun or was fired at.

323
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:35,607
"And the conflict, the contrast,

324
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:38,807
"between what he was doing
and I was doing

325
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:42,407
"is just too appalling

326
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:48,687
"to bear without some kind of emotion
of resistance and anger."

327
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:55,447
I was angry that everybody
didn't understand the...

328
00:19:55,447 --> 00:20:01,207
...the... situation of soldiers

329
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:03,482
who fought the war on the ground.

330
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:11,167
Well, basically, when you're in OCS,

331
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,647
there were six of us,

332
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:18,127
and you lived, ate, slept
and everything else together.

333
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:20,527
You studied together,
and I still remember it -

334
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:24,327
it was Gallicly, Galloway, Gamble,
Gardiner, Gaughton, Ginsberg.

335
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:27,887
Forward observers up forward
to find targets for the artillery,

336
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:29,807
and you worked with the infantry.

337
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:34,727
In our unit, the forward observer,
if the infantry was moving,

338
00:20:34,727 --> 00:20:38,327
you had to stay with the lead platoon
of the attacking company.

339
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:39,967
And the reason for that

340
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:42,887
was that chances are, you wouldn't
bring artillery down on yourself.

341
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:44,607
You'd keep it out in front.

342
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:48,447
And that was there, but then
we also went for targets,

343
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,887
if we could go out and find some targets.

344
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:53,767
To be perfectly honest, it was boring.

345
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:56,047
We didn't have but four officers,

346
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,927
and most of the time
there wasn't but one available.

347
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:02,287
If I was not forward,
then I had to read the mail.

348
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:04,567
And it was just about
as boring as you could get.

349
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,847
I do recall one fellow

350
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:11,327
that I just didn't read
his letter to his girlfriend -

351
00:21:11,327 --> 00:21:13,887
it was 10 pages every day,

352
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:15,847
and there just wasn't any sense to it.

353
00:21:15,847 --> 00:21:17,967
He was only writing his wife
about a page,

354
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:22,199
but he was... his girlfriend
was in England.

355
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:27,767
One example was a platoon,
which basically had 50 people,

356
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,447
jumped off one morning,

357
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:32,687
and I happened to hear them
on the radio that afternoon.

358
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:37,527
The battalion commander was asking
how many men they had.

359
00:21:37,527 --> 00:21:39,247
They had chocolate -
wanted to wait for dark

360
00:21:39,247 --> 00:21:40,847
and they would send up chocolate bars.

361
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:43,487
He says, "We've got one for each man.
How many do you want?"

362
00:21:43,487 --> 00:21:45,047
He says, "Send me five."

363
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:47,447
He only had five men left
out of his platoon.

364
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,647
Himself and four, apparently.

365
00:21:49,647 --> 00:21:53,879
But you just lost folks like mad in there.

366
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:59,367
I'm sitting, when after I was captured,
several days later,

367
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,487
maybe a week - I don't know.

368
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,247
Some time after that,

369
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:06,807
I was in this little village
where I had fired.

370
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:09,287
As a matter of fact,
one round got away from it

371
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,047
and knocked the steeple off the church.

372
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:14,767
But I'm sitting on the church steps

373
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,087
and this German officer came up,

374
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,847
and he was artillery.

375
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:24,247
And he could tell I was artillery -
you had your brass on your collar.

376
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:28,367
And he asks me, "Were you
the forward observer over there?"

377
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:30,167
I said, "Yeah. And you up there?"
"Yeah."

378
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,807
So he went and got me food.

379
00:22:31,807 --> 00:22:33,847
And he spoke better English than I did.

380
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:35,367
He'd been to school in England.

381
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:36,927
And he got caught.

382
00:22:36,927 --> 00:22:39,767
He came over there
and got caught up in the war.

383
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:41,767
He came home,
got caught up in the war.

384
00:22:41,767 --> 00:22:44,727
And he was just like I was.

385
00:22:44,727 --> 00:22:46,567
He was just in the war.

386
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:50,447
So he and I had Old Home Week
sitting there on the church steps.

387
00:22:50,447 --> 00:22:54,127
But that was an unusual experience.

388
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:55,727
But I was glad to see him.

389
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:59,167
Well, on one, we were on a railroad car,

390
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,007
and the Americans came in, strafing it,

391
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:02,727
and everybody ran.

392
00:23:02,727 --> 00:23:04,767
You just tried to get
away from the train,

393
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:08,007
and I went out a window
and down an incline

394
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:13,247
and across to where there was
a little bridge over a road -

395
00:23:13,247 --> 00:23:15,247
not a big one.

396
00:23:15,247 --> 00:23:16,767
And I slid under there

397
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,887
and there were two or three
German soldiers under there

398
00:23:18,887 --> 00:23:20,367
that gave up to me.

399
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:24,367
I mean, they thought the Americans
had landed or something, yeah.

400
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:26,927
They wanted to surrender to me,
and I didn't want them.

401
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:32,207
I explained to them that I wasn't
in any position to take them captive.

402
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:34,596
But, yeah, they tried to give up to me.

403
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:41,567
When I went into the Marines,
the first thing was...

404
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:44,167
...we was, uh... um...

405
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:46,847
...we had a little scrip to eat with.

406
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:50,007
And when you would stop in a town
like Macon, Georgia,

407
00:23:50,007 --> 00:23:54,527
um, the regular marines -
there had been no black marines.

408
00:23:54,527 --> 00:24:00,487
So the regular marines would eat
in the dining room, in the regular area.

409
00:24:00,487 --> 00:24:04,487
But in order to honour my scrip,

410
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:08,447
they took me upstairs
in the private dining room

411
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,727
and they brought me anything
I wanted to eat,

412
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:12,527
as long as I didn't eat downstairs.

413
00:24:12,527 --> 00:24:17,043
And I immediately ordered a filet mignon
with all the trimmings.

414
00:24:18,487 --> 00:24:21,127
It would remind you of home,

415
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,767
and it broke your heart.

416
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,487
For instance, they had bands

417
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:28,207
that would come out
and entertain the troops.

418
00:24:28,207 --> 00:24:30,927
And one band brought out Lena Horne.

419
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,647
And one of these... we had
the white troops around us,

420
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:38,647
and they would make seats

421
00:24:38,647 --> 00:24:41,687
out of making trees even
and putting strips,

422
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:43,287
and this was your seats.

423
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:46,287
When she came out and said,
"Shoo, shoo, shoo, baby,"

424
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:50,367
a whole strip full of white boys fell off...

425
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:51,927
...fell off their seats.

426
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:57,967
We were proud as punch to see
Lena Horne and other people -

427
00:24:57,967 --> 00:25:00,327
Count Basie, Duke Ellington.

428
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:03,967
It really made... this is worth
fighting for, is what we thought.

429
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:08,404
If we can just get back home
and get a chance to enjoy some of this.

430
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:12,567
Our attitude was,

431
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:18,881
if the Germans or the Japanese
won the war...

432
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:23,207
...the white folk would get on their side

433
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:25,687
and we'd have to fight
both the Germans or Japanese

434
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:27,207
and the white folk.

435
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:30,287
So what we did was go over there
and win the war,

436
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:31,767
and then come back up

437
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:34,600
and pick up the gauntlet where
we'd try to get our civil rights.

438
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:38,166
That was the feeling.

439
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:49,807
I was on a list somewhere in the navy

440
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:52,487
to be called up at the appropriate time,

441
00:25:52,487 --> 00:25:55,967
and I was in college,
at the University of Minnesota.

442
00:25:55,967 --> 00:26:00,287
And I'd spent my money,
and my friends were going.

443
00:26:00,287 --> 00:26:03,687
One of them was already
a marine fighter pilot.

444
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,247
That was unendurable -

445
00:26:05,247 --> 00:26:09,527
for me to be a college boy
and him to be a marine fighter pilot.

446
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:14,447
So I felt I had to
accelerate this somewhat,

447
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,087
and I went in to the recruiting office,

448
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:21,327
and there was - to my astonishment -
an old friend of mine at the desk.

449
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:23,887
And I said, "I've got to go."

450
00:26:23,887 --> 00:26:26,567
And as I talked to him,
it got more and more intense -

451
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,207
"I've got to go. I'm out of money.
Everyone else is going."

452
00:26:29,207 --> 00:26:31,807
And he went to the corner of the room

453
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,767
where there was a great pile of files,

454
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:38,727
and fingered down to the bottom,
pulled one out and put it on top,

455
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:44,687
and said, "You'll get your orders
next week. Don't tell anybody."

456
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,167
And I went out,

457
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:52,247
and it was like
that moment at the beach

458
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:56,847
when you climb the ladder
of the diving board

459
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:58,967
up to where you usually dive off,

460
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:02,967
and then keep going to the one
where you might jump off,

461
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:06,207
and keep going still
until you get to the very top,

462
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,167
where you've never jumped off before,

463
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:12,247
and then you step up
to the edge and jump.

464
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:16,607
I felt that I was in empty space.

465
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:19,447
Something had happened to me
that had never happened before

466
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:22,727
and that I had done it.

467
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,927
You know, as a kid,
you don't have an opportunity

468
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:28,047
to determine your life very often.

469
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:31,407
Your parents do that for you.
Your teachers do that for you.

470
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:35,767
But I just made a decision that
was going to change my life forever.

471
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:36,995
And it did.

472
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:41,047
Everybody joined. I wanted to be a pilot.

473
00:27:41,047 --> 00:27:43,887
And everybody was in the air force.

474
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:48,887
And they wore pink pants
and hats with the grommet taken out.

475
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:54,407
There was something spurious, to me,
about those guys.

476
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:56,727
They flew too high.

477
00:27:56,727 --> 00:28:00,327
I wanted to be in...

478
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:03,807
I didn't know anything. You have to
understand that I was 17 years old.

479
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:07,327
These were impressions that
didn't have any basis in reality.

480
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:10,687
I also thought that the Marine Corps,

481
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:14,487
which was an elite of the navy,
as I saw it,

482
00:28:14,487 --> 00:28:17,007
and therefore was the best of the best,

483
00:28:17,007 --> 00:28:21,567
would be the organisation
to fly with, if I could.

484
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:27,087
I began flying from a little grass field

485
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:28,727
north of Dallas.

486
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:31,007
And it was wonderful.

487
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:34,167
First experience of being up in the air

488
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:37,167
and seeing the world down below you,

489
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:39,807
it's indescribable.

490
00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:43,595
But it adds a dimension
to the world you've been living in.

491
00:28:45,607 --> 00:28:49,167
Growing up is a series of tests,
inevitably,

492
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:53,447
motivated partly by curiosity

493
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:57,407
about what it's like
to do things that grown-ups do,

494
00:28:57,407 --> 00:28:59,527
that you've never done before,

495
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:04,207
and partly a series of tests

496
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:08,447
of your readiness to be an adult, I think.

497
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,647
By passing the tests,

498
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:17,207
you earn admission
to this class of people

499
00:29:17,207 --> 00:29:20,247
that you think all know
what they're doing.

500
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:23,807
Aviation is...

501
00:29:23,807 --> 00:29:26,647
...certainly, learning to fly
is a series of tests.

502
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:32,887
But you have to remember that,
as an 18- or 19- or 20-year-old kid,

503
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:38,407
you're at the same time
still going through the other set of tests.

504
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:40,687
You're finding out
what it's like to be drunk,

505
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:44,567
you're trying to pass the test with girls

506
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:47,967
when you really don't know
what to do when you get there.

507
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:53,567
You're trying to live independently,

508
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:55,367
you're trying to act independently.

509
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:57,047
You'd be doing those, you see,

510
00:29:57,047 --> 00:30:00,007
whether you were in
military training or not.

511
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:03,087
On top of those, then, are the tests

512
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:05,647
about soloing an aeroplane
and doing your first loop

513
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:08,605
and dropping your first bomb
and so forth.

514
00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:13,887
There was a song
which was sometimes...

515
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:16,887
...the refrain of which
sometimes was "Bless 'em all"

516
00:30:16,887 --> 00:30:18,767
and sometimes "Fuck 'em all,"

517
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:21,367
depending on the audience
and who was singing.

518
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:26,927
And the verses went...
(Sings) # They...

519
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:29,207
# They sent for the...

520
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:33,607
#... sent for the army to come to Tulagi

521
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:36,847
# But General MacArthur said no

522
00:30:36,847 --> 00:30:40,247
# He gave as his reason,
"This isn't the season

523
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:43,487
# "Besides, there is no USO"

524
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:46,447
# Fuck 'em all, fuck 'em all

525
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:50,447
# The long and the short and the tall

526
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:54,167
# Fuck all the admirals in ComAirSoPac

527
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:58,687
# They don't give a damn
if we never get back

528
00:30:58,687 --> 00:31:02,407
# So we're saying goodbye to them all

529
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:06,167
# As back in our foxholes we crawl

530
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:10,647
# There'll be no promotion
this side of the ocean

531
00:31:10,647 --> 00:31:14,727
# But cheer up, my lads, bless 'em all. #

532
00:31:14,727 --> 00:31:16,207
MAN: That's great!

533
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,247
That's the least obscene
of my repertoire.

534
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:21,796
If you want the rest of them, I can oblige.

535
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:26,607
The atomic bomb was, of course,

536
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:29,887
an enormous... more than a big help.

537
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:32,607
It was the end of the war.

538
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:36,167
And we felt that, and with relief,

539
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:39,487
but also with a kind of sadness.

540
00:31:39,487 --> 00:31:45,767
We had been turned into
artificial adults for a few years

541
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:50,887
and we'd lived lives
that were full of excitement,

542
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:53,567
and kind of adventurous lives -

543
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:57,007
lives that we could
never have anticipated

544
00:31:57,007 --> 00:31:59,567
back in Minneapolis and Bonesteel.

545
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:04,287
Now it was all over.

546
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:09,087
And there was... I'm sure
I wasn't the only person who felt,

547
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:13,207
"Now I will have to go back
to being who I really am,

548
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:17,485
"who is a college undergraduate
at the University of Minnesota.

549
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:20,407
"How boring that will be.

550
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:23,607
"How narrow and limited that will be.

551
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:25,607
"What kind of future will I have

552
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:29,600
"that will be as much fun as being
a pilot in the Marine Corps?"

553
00:32:31,247 --> 00:32:34,007
When the Japanese surrendered,

554
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:36,521
it was announced to us.

555
00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:44,047
We felt... the squadron decided

556
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:49,167
that it ought to make
some gesture of celebration.

557
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:57,567
And we took off as a squadron,
in formation,

558
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:00,567
and flew out over the fleet
in Buckner Bay.

559
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:03,247
And I expected that was
what it was going to be -

560
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:06,047
we'd fly over the fleet
and then we'd go home and land.

561
00:33:06,047 --> 00:33:09,287
And to my astonishment,
the man leading the flight

562
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,967
signalled to go into a column.

563
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:16,527
So we all pulled back,
one behind the other,

564
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,287
and dove on the fleet.

565
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:23,207
And then, to my amazement,
he pulled up and did a barrel roll.

566
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:29,447
Now, a barrel roll in a TBM
is like a fat lady dancing -

567
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:33,607
she shouldn't do it,
and you're not even sure she can do it.

568
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:37,407
But he did it,
and then the next plane did it,

569
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:39,807
and then it was my turn.

570
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:42,847
And I pulled up and pulled it over,

571
00:33:42,847 --> 00:33:46,367
and all the rubbish and debris
in the bottom of the airplane

572
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,567
came floating up into my eyes,

573
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:52,567
and the crewman in the back
rattled around a bit, I guess.

574
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:54,527
And then we came out

575
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:58,247
and it was still flying,
the wings hadn't fallen off,

576
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:00,442
and then we went back and landed.

577
00:34:01,847 --> 00:34:06,207
And I reckon what we were doing
was giving death one more chance.

578
00:34:06,207 --> 00:34:08,357
It was like the storm.

579
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,607
Of course it could have been me.

580
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:14,407
But it wasn't.

581
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:18,087
I grieve for them.
I grieve for them every day.

582
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:21,397
The two or three
with whom I was most...

583
00:34:22,487 --> 00:34:23,966
...I was closest to.

584
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:29,207
But, then, people die in life.

585
00:34:29,207 --> 00:34:34,884
Not that young,
but every life has some grief in it.

586
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,646
And you go on living.

587
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:43,607
I talked recently with a friend of mine.

588
00:34:43,607 --> 00:34:47,327
Her name is Georgine DuVivier-Hall.

589
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:49,727
She's about my age
or a little younger.

590
00:34:49,727 --> 00:34:53,487
Was in college in Pennsylvania
during the war,

591
00:34:53,487 --> 00:34:56,967
a little women's college
called Wilson College,

592
00:34:56,967 --> 00:35:00,087
where she said they wore
white gloves to dinner,

593
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:04,287
or at least the white gloves
were part of it.

594
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:06,527
She said she really
wasn't aware of the war.

595
00:35:06,527 --> 00:35:08,407
There was kind of innocence
in this place,

596
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,367
as though the war didn't exist.

597
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:15,247
But when she went home
after the term ended,

598
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:20,087
she had to sit in a boxcar,
sitting on a coffin,

599
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:23,047
which was a coffin
of an American serviceman.

600
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:25,641
It seemed an odd juxtaposition.

601
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:32,078
They were casualties from somewhere,
being brought home.

602
00:35:36,687 --> 00:35:38,167
A grave responsibility.

603
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:40,567
I was now in charge of three squads

604
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:44,082
and that's a total of 41 men.

605
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:51,278
And then I began to realise
why this was done.

606
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:57,287
If you're an engineer,

607
00:35:57,287 --> 00:36:00,727
you're selected to be an officer
because you know mathematics

608
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,957
and logarithms and all of that.

609
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:07,407
If you're an artillery officer,

610
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:08,927
I suppose they'll select you

611
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:12,522
because you know something
about trajectory and physics.

612
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:18,165
Why would they select someone
for an infantry officer?

613
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:24,367
Well, he has to know how
to read the maps and the compass.

614
00:36:24,367 --> 00:36:26,722
But he has to know how to kill.

615
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:31,127
Yeah, that's a horrible thought.

616
00:36:31,127 --> 00:36:34,039
I won't tell you how many
men I killed, but, uh...

617
00:36:35,287 --> 00:36:39,447
There are some who count sheep,
so they tell me,

618
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:43,847
but there are times in my life
when I count men.

619
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:45,567
And that's a terrible thought.

620
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:49,647
Because I'm certain the average person,

621
00:36:49,647 --> 00:36:55,727
if he or she ran over a cat,
you'd never forget that.

622
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:59,402
So how in the world can you forget
killing a man, you know?

623
00:37:01,247 --> 00:37:07,287
Well, I was in Oakland,
getting ready to get on a ship

624
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:10,127
for a boat ride back to Hawaii.

625
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:13,647
I was in my uniform
with three rows of ribbons

626
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:16,727
and the captain's bars on my shoulder.

627
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:19,967
I must have looked pretty good,
like a big hero,

628
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:24,207
with a hook on my right hand,
where it used to be.

629
00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:29,807
And so I thought I'd just get
a nice haircut so I'd look neat.

630
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:33,807
I looked around Oakland,
and here was a barbershop.

631
00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:38,007
Three chairs, I remember that.
All three empty.

632
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:41,124
The barbers are just standing around,
so I walked in.

633
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,767
This one barber approached me
and he looked at me

634
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:48,998
and he said, "Are you a Jap?"

635
00:37:50,607 --> 00:37:53,767
And, you know,
that was a strange welcome.

636
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:56,327
And I said, "I'm an American."

637
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,847
"Well, I'm asking you, are you a Jap?"

638
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:04,127
I said, "My father was born in Japan.
My mother is Japanese.

639
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:06,487
"I suppose that makes me one."

640
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:08,045
"We don't cut Jap hair."

641
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:13,367
And I thought to myself,
"Here I am in uniform.

642
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:16,647
"It should be obvious to him
that I'm an American soldier,

643
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:18,127
"a captain at that,

644
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:21,807
"and that fellow very likely
never went to war,

645
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:24,527
"and he's telling me,
'We don't cut Jap hair."'

646
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:27,007
I was so tempted to strike him,

647
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:29,567
but then I thought, "If I had done that,

648
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:34,087
"all the work that we had done
would be for nil."

649
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:38,407
So I just looked at him and I said,
"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way,"

650
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:40,407
and I walked out.

651
00:38:40,407 --> 00:38:46,047
But it became clear to me that what
the captain said was very correct -

652
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:48,247
it's going to be a long struggle.

653
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:49,726
A tough one.

654
00:38:54,967 --> 00:39:00,967
We all say that if it hadn't been
for that childhood that we had,

655
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:02,807
stressed,

656
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:09,367
and knowledgeable in matters
that were so out of proportion

657
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:11,567
from regular childhood,

658
00:39:11,567 --> 00:39:16,687
we probably wouldn't be
the people we were today.

659
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,447
And it's just like me
living in the wine country here,

660
00:39:20,447 --> 00:39:24,807
where I just found out
that the more stressed the vine,

661
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:28,767
the better the wine and the grape is.

662
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:32,087
So, I didn't know that.

663
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:34,521
So it makes a lot of sense.

664
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:42,887
I think Luverne probably was
cleaner during the war

665
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:45,367
than at any time in its history,

666
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:48,407
primarily because we kids would go out

667
00:39:48,407 --> 00:39:53,527
and we'd go the alleys, back roads,
ditches, anything,

668
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:55,887
to find something out of metal,

669
00:39:55,887 --> 00:39:58,367
because you could get, like,
a penny a pound

670
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:00,087
for something of this nature.

671
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:03,847
And then if you took them down
to the theatre, you could get in -

672
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:08,127
if you had, like, two, three, four pounds
of scrap metal,

673
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:10,487
you would get a free ticket.

674
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:15,647
My two brothers and I went out one time
and made a horrendous haul.

675
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,127
We just... I don't know.

676
00:40:17,127 --> 00:40:19,127
The one major thing
that I remember in there,

677
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:22,247
we had a brass bedstead.

678
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:26,287
But we had wheels,
old wheels we found.

679
00:40:26,287 --> 00:40:28,847
We had more than enough
to get into the theatre.

680
00:40:28,847 --> 00:40:31,407
So the kids who didn't have enough,

681
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:34,447
we were down on Main Street,
right by the theatre,

682
00:40:34,447 --> 00:40:38,087
and we're handing out, you know,
"What do you need? Tyre?

683
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:42,327
"Here's an old rim, here's an old
piece of metal," or whatever it was.

684
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:43,847
And so they'd get in.

685
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:46,247
Then Doc, who was
the manager of the theatre,

686
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:48,647
came down and told us,
"I don't want you doing this anymore.

687
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:50,527
"These kids have to get their own stuff."

688
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:53,607
Two pounds of milkweed
would make one life vest.

689
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:56,327
So they gave everybody these sacks,
or bags,

690
00:40:56,327 --> 00:40:58,921
and then we would go out
looking for milkweed.

691
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:02,767
And we got two cents a pound for these.

692
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:04,687
No - we got 20 cents a bag.

693
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:08,687
OK, now, that's a lot of milkweed
stuck in one of these bags.

694
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:12,527
But we would have our patches,

695
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:15,407
and the one that I remember was
from the Olsen's Dairy

696
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:19,367
out towards the Blue Mounds,
along the old Rock Island railroad.

697
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:22,807
And we'd go out there at night,
or after dinner,

698
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:25,287
and we would crawl down in these...

699
00:41:25,287 --> 00:41:29,487
You know, it's nothing but weeds
and brambles and everything else,

700
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,767
and we're collecting
these God-awful milkweed pods.

701
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:36,647
But we wouldn't tell anybody
where we were going,

702
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:38,327
because we didn't want anybody

703
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:41,847
finding the milkweed in our patch,
kind of thing.

704
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:43,927
They had... in one year, I think,

705
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:49,167
there were, like, 1,300 bags that
were turned in of this milkweed.

706
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,847
I could never understand

707
00:41:50,847 --> 00:41:53,447
how they were going to take
this little bit of stuff

708
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:58,167
and save some navy pilot
who ended up in the Pacific Ocean.

709
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:01,727
You know, but that was the story we got.

710
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,327
My dad was a warden,

711
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:07,327
and there were wardens, you know,
all around the neighbourhood.

712
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:09,767
These guys would go out there.

713
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:11,887
And we'd have these blackouts.

714
00:42:11,887 --> 00:42:13,927
The siren would ring downtown

715
00:42:13,927 --> 00:42:15,847
and you had to turn off all your lights,

716
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:18,687
unless you had a blackout curtain

717
00:42:18,687 --> 00:42:22,287
that you could put over your window
so that no light got out.

718
00:42:22,287 --> 00:42:24,487
The dads - my dad
and these other guys -

719
00:42:24,487 --> 00:42:28,007
would go out and they would
walk around the neighbourhood.

720
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:30,167
Now, I couldn't figure out

721
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:34,727
how the Germans were going to fly
all the way across the Atlantic Ocean

722
00:42:34,727 --> 00:42:38,127
and the Japanese were going to fly
all the way across the Pacific Ocean

723
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:39,607
to bomb Luverne.

724
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:43,607
I mean, I just had no concept
of what was going on.

725
00:42:43,607 --> 00:42:45,607
They wanted these guys to have guns,

726
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:47,687
but, you know,
they didn't have any guns for them.

727
00:42:47,687 --> 00:42:51,367
So my dad, the first couple of times
he went out, he had a broomstick.

728
00:42:51,367 --> 00:42:53,887
I guess you were supposed to have
this notion

729
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:55,559
that you were carrying a weapon.

730
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:58,247
He thought that was kind of dumb,

731
00:42:58,247 --> 00:43:00,727
so he'd go out
with his 12-gauge shotgun,

732
00:43:00,727 --> 00:43:02,527
but he had no shells or anything.

733
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:07,527
And then it got to be where
these guys would stay out for a while.

734
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:09,927
And my mother finally figured out

735
00:43:09,927 --> 00:43:13,367
that they may be down at Doc Blake's
or Ez Collins's or some place,

736
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:14,887
having a highball.

737
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:18,767
So it was more of a social thing,
I think, for these men

738
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:21,887
to protect us from I don't know what,

739
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:25,357
but they had to go out
on these nightly patrols.

740
00:43:27,247 --> 00:43:33,807
Collecting anything at that time was
our basic source of income, for kids.

741
00:43:33,807 --> 00:43:37,847
And we could go...
Now this seems kind of ridiculous.

742
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:42,207
But we could go to the pool hall,
for example, on a Saturday night,

743
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,207
and have a hot dog
and a milkshake and a candy bar

744
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:46,687
for 25 cents.

745
00:43:46,687 --> 00:43:48,927
The hot dog was a dime,
the milkshake was a dime,

746
00:43:48,927 --> 00:43:50,607
the candy bar was a nickel.

747
00:43:50,607 --> 00:43:53,927
And if you had 11 cents,
you could go to the movie besides.

748
00:43:53,927 --> 00:43:57,247
So we didn't really need
a lot of money, OK,

749
00:43:57,247 --> 00:44:01,638
but what money we got,
we got from a lot of the scrap things.

750
00:44:02,647 --> 00:44:06,607
We had an army air base
that was 30 miles away,

751
00:44:06,607 --> 00:44:10,967
and a lot of those soldiers came over
to Luverne on their R and R,

752
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:13,447
so we had soldiers around us.

753
00:44:13,447 --> 00:44:18,407
They were flying Liberators and P-47 s
out of Sioux Falls,

754
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:20,647
so we had a lot of airplanes over us.

755
00:44:20,647 --> 00:44:26,207
If some guy was going - dating -
one of the Luverne girls, let's say,

756
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:28,407
and they went up on an exercise,

757
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:31,127
and he was flying
one of these P-47 Thunderbolts,

758
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,967
he would come zooming
down Main Street, you know,

759
00:44:33,967 --> 00:44:37,967
like, 200 feet,
200, 300 feet over the city,

760
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:40,087
you know, and the wings
are going like this.

761
00:44:40,087 --> 00:44:43,127
And she's working
with a phone company,

762
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:46,047
she'd know who it was.

763
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:48,327
I mean, this was kind of
a way they were signalling.

764
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:52,647
And the windows would rattle
and people would get all upset,

765
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:54,367
you know, "These guys
shouldn't be doing this,"

766
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:57,447
but I don't think
it ever stopped them.

767
00:44:57,447 --> 00:45:00,447
I remember another
funny thing about...

768
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:04,807
The bombers went up a lot,
and we were all excited to see them -

769
00:45:04,807 --> 00:45:07,447
these big Liberators and B-29s,
some of these,

770
00:45:07,447 --> 00:45:10,087
that they were flying
out of Sioux Falls.

771
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:14,087
And so we could hear them coming
and we'd say, "Bomber! Bomber!"

772
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,087
And everybody would
run out the back door

773
00:45:16,087 --> 00:45:17,887
and we'd look up and we'd watch these.

774
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:20,407
Well, we had a cocker spaniel, Rinky,

775
00:45:20,407 --> 00:45:22,087
and we'd say, "Bomber! Bomber!"

776
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:24,967
And Rinky would head for the back door,
just as fast as he could.

777
00:45:24,967 --> 00:45:28,087
Whether the planes came or not,
all you had to say is "Bomber! Bomber!"

778
00:45:28,087 --> 00:45:29,927
And Rinky, he's gone.

779
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:33,367
And one time, my mother
had just waxed the kitchen floor.

780
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:35,247
And we said, "Bomber! Bomber!"

781
00:45:35,247 --> 00:45:37,607
And Rinky goes tearing out
to the back door.

782
00:45:37,607 --> 00:45:40,487
His feet are just churning away
like crazy,

783
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,807
falling down, trying to get
out the back door to see that.

784
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:48,087
But that was a... we all ran out
to watch these planes go over

785
00:45:48,087 --> 00:45:49,566
and they went over a lot.

786
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:56,407
You know, there was terrible
confusion during combat.

787
00:45:56,407 --> 00:45:58,527
Just unbelievable.

788
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:00,567
I mean, no-one knew
what was going on.

789
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:02,327
I don't think the Germans did either.

790
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:05,287
But one of the most confusing things
was the radio.

791
00:46:05,287 --> 00:46:10,407
We always had a radio
in some place around us

792
00:46:10,407 --> 00:46:15,167
so that we could contact headquarters
and they were asking where we were.

793
00:46:15,167 --> 00:46:16,727
Call for artillery fire -

794
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:23,247
you could talk to the artillery observer.

795
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,367
But the radio was just madness

796
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:29,527
because there was always some guy
pinned down in a terrible situation,

797
00:46:29,527 --> 00:46:31,047
screaming for help,

798
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:34,127
and then a very cool, calm guy
in the background

799
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:37,007
saying, "This is Rabbit 3.
This is Rabbit 3."

800
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:39,647
And this guy would say,
"Cut that crap out!

801
00:46:39,647 --> 00:46:42,407
"Christ Almighty. We're getting fired on!"

802
00:46:42,407 --> 00:46:45,046
But this coming from all directions.

803
00:46:46,127 --> 00:46:51,047
Well, when the war ended,
I believe I was in Paris

804
00:46:51,047 --> 00:46:53,847
and living a very, very splendid life.

805
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:56,407
It was very, very good.

806
00:46:56,407 --> 00:47:00,647
I was working for a branch of 'Stars
and Stripes' called 'Army Talks',

807
00:47:00,647 --> 00:47:02,687
which was a magazine
that was put out,

808
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:06,127
and travelling rather freely,

809
00:47:06,127 --> 00:47:07,847
and had some nice girlfriends

810
00:47:07,847 --> 00:47:11,287
and a very, very interesting,
mature group of guys

811
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:16,927
who educated me more than
the college had educated me.

812
00:47:16,927 --> 00:47:18,887
Uh, they were...

813
00:47:18,887 --> 00:47:22,447
And when the war ended in Japan,

814
00:47:22,447 --> 00:47:26,687
it wasn't the great celebration
to Parisianers,

815
00:47:26,687 --> 00:47:29,047
but to we in the army,

816
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:32,967
who had thought maybe we'd
get sent to Japan or something,

817
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:34,487
it was a great celebration.

818
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:38,487
And Paris was a great place
to celebrate in,

819
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:41,087
so we did lots of celebrating there.

820
00:47:41,087 --> 00:47:44,523
Quite unlike VE Day.

821
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:48,207
You know, I did shoot a fellow one time,

822
00:47:48,207 --> 00:47:52,487
and it was in Bayreuth,

823
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:55,367
you know, the home of Wagner.

824
00:47:55,367 --> 00:47:59,527
And there was a river
that split the town in half

825
00:47:59,527 --> 00:48:03,487
and we'd moved down to the river
and we were in a little bar.

826
00:48:03,487 --> 00:48:10,007
And our radio, it came through
from way up in back of us

827
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:14,447
that there was a squad of Germans
coming down the road that we were at.

828
00:48:14,447 --> 00:48:17,567
And we watched them,
and they came down,

829
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:19,687
and they went in a building
across the street.

830
00:48:19,687 --> 00:48:23,927
And we really didn't want to
put up a big fight,

831
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:27,607
but pretty soon one came out
and came down

832
00:48:27,607 --> 00:48:30,327
and looked at the bridge
that had been blown, that we were,

833
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:34,327
and then trotted up the road,
a couple of blocks.

834
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:37,927
And we thought, "Well, the squad
up there will pick him up."

835
00:48:37,927 --> 00:48:39,727
Pretty soon he came trotting back,

836
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:42,527
so we realised,
"There's no squad there."

837
00:48:42,527 --> 00:48:46,847
So we sort of... everybody said,
"Why don't you shoot him?"

838
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,647
"Oh, you shoot him."

839
00:48:48,647 --> 00:48:50,527
I ended up having to shoot him.

840
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:53,367
Well, I shot him, and the
next thing I knew, I was out there.

841
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:55,487
He flew up in the air,

842
00:48:55,487 --> 00:49:01,487
and two of us, next thing we knew,
we were out there nursing him.

843
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:05,407
Drag him back, and then the squad
came out from across the street

844
00:49:05,407 --> 00:49:06,887
and surrendered.

845
00:49:06,887 --> 00:49:08,687
That's the only one I'm ever sure I...

846
00:49:08,687 --> 00:49:10,927
I shot at lots and lots of things,

847
00:49:10,927 --> 00:49:12,447
but you're shooting at smoke,

848
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:16,487
you were shooting at where you could
see machine-gun fire coming from,

849
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:20,007
you were shooting at tanks,
which was useless.

850
00:49:20,007 --> 00:49:22,247
You never knew what you were doing.

851
00:49:22,247 --> 00:49:24,487
That was the only case where
you could really see somebody,

852
00:49:24,487 --> 00:49:27,087
and nobody really wanted to do it.

853
00:49:27,087 --> 00:49:29,607
Here he was,
and he was doing no harm,

854
00:49:29,607 --> 00:49:32,567
and he was really just trying to retreat,

855
00:49:32,567 --> 00:49:37,038
but we couldn't think
of any other way to do it.

856
00:49:41,287 --> 00:49:42,927
Our movie stars in those days

857
00:49:42,927 --> 00:49:46,087
were guys like James Cagney
and Humphrey Bogart

858
00:49:46,087 --> 00:49:49,327
and Edward G. Robinson
and those guys.

859
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:53,047
You know, we grew up
on adventure stories.

860
00:49:53,047 --> 00:49:55,647
What is the reason
for a story to exist?

861
00:49:55,647 --> 00:49:58,447
It's to take you out
of a drab existence, isn't it,

862
00:49:58,447 --> 00:49:59,927
into a different world.

863
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:03,807
That was how we grew up
and those were our aims.

864
00:50:03,807 --> 00:50:06,927
And when the real war broke out,

865
00:50:06,927 --> 00:50:10,367
it did give many of us...
many Latinos enlisted -

866
00:50:10,367 --> 00:50:11,847
you know, thousands.

867
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:14,047
And I suspect that,
in the back of their minds,

868
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:19,567
there was James Cagney doing his thing
in a war movie or something.

869
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:22,400
But they did OK in reality.

870
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:25,527
Especially on lwo Jima,

871
00:50:25,527 --> 00:50:30,887
we did find many, many Japanese
who had killed themselves.

872
00:50:30,887 --> 00:50:34,447
They shot themselves, they blew
themselves up with hand grenades,

873
00:50:34,447 --> 00:50:39,167
they disembowelled themselves
with their knives, they... you know.

874
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:44,407
And sometimes when we threatened
to blow their caves up

875
00:50:44,407 --> 00:50:46,047
and bury them alive,

876
00:50:46,047 --> 00:50:48,727
they in effect said,
"Screw you. Go ahead and do it."

877
00:50:48,727 --> 00:50:52,407
And we did.
We buried a lot of them alive.

878
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:55,127
Our attitude was
"Better them than us," you know?

879
00:50:55,127 --> 00:50:57,647
And we had a saying
in the Marine Corps -

880
00:50:57,647 --> 00:51:02,247
"The Japanese want to die for the
emperor, and we want to help them."

881
00:51:02,247 --> 00:51:05,607
And that was basically it.
It's that simple.

882
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:08,487
You know, you're in a war.
You're not going to be feeling...

883
00:51:08,487 --> 00:51:10,167
You feel sorry for a guy

884
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,567
when you see that he held
a hand grenade to his belly

885
00:51:12,567 --> 00:51:14,047
and blew himself up,

886
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,527
but very briefly.

887
00:51:15,527 --> 00:51:18,567
I mean, that's the guy who
potentially might have killed you

888
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:21,007
or one of your buddies.

889
00:51:21,007 --> 00:51:23,087
They were tough people.

890
00:51:23,087 --> 00:51:25,687
So, you know, if they wanted
to blow themselves up,

891
00:51:25,687 --> 00:51:27,882
that was one less guy to nail you.

892
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:30,927
And the shelling was so intense,

893
00:51:30,927 --> 00:51:32,967
I thought I was going to lose my mind.

894
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:36,127
And I thought, "Gee, I've been
in this too damn long already.

895
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:38,447
"I can't take it anymore."

896
00:51:38,447 --> 00:51:43,367
But I didn't realise until later,
when we were told about that defence,

897
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:48,607
how effective that defence was
and how much artillery we were taking.

898
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,887
I thought it was me.

899
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:52,567
That was my worst moment.

900
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:56,207
That night... that night
we were gathered,

901
00:51:56,207 --> 00:51:57,807
and the lieutenant came over

902
00:51:57,807 --> 00:52:01,167
and he said, "If we're
driven off the beach," he said,

903
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:04,167
"try to swim towards the transports."

904
00:52:04,167 --> 00:52:07,407
And we thought, "Jesus!
What is he saying to us?"

905
00:52:07,407 --> 00:52:11,127
I know that sounds ridiculous,
but they actually told us that.

906
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:14,407
If we're driven off the beach,
start swimming for the trans... (Laughs)

907
00:52:14,407 --> 00:52:18,047
I'm a Mexican!
I didn't even know how to swim right!

908
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,207
I sink like a rock.

909
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:25,486
So, you know, for us, it was like
the Japanese - it was do it or too bad.

910
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:34,727
We met the cadets when they were
training over in Pensacola.

911
00:52:34,727 --> 00:52:40,567
And I had one cute boyfriend
who was from the Midwest.

912
00:52:40,567 --> 00:52:45,087
And when he knew he would
have Saturday night free,

913
00:52:45,087 --> 00:52:48,887
he would fly his training flight
over Mobile

914
00:52:48,887 --> 00:52:52,407
and dive down
and buzz my house twice.

915
00:52:52,407 --> 00:52:56,647
And that way, I knew he'd
be over that Saturday night.

916
00:52:56,647 --> 00:52:59,327
And I was not to date anyone else -

917
00:52:59,327 --> 00:53:02,367
I was to save that
Saturday night for Norm.

918
00:53:02,367 --> 00:53:06,487
So I had an old maid neighbour
across the street,

919
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:09,647
and every Saturday
she'd sit on her front porch

920
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:12,887
and wait to see if we'd be buzzed.

921
00:53:12,887 --> 00:53:17,727
And when he buzzed me, she'd come
running across the parkway out here,

922
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:21,607
yelling, "Katharine, he's coming!
Katharine, he's coming tonight!

923
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:23,087
"I just heard him!"

924
00:53:23,087 --> 00:53:26,687
So the whole neighbourhood
was alerted

925
00:53:26,687 --> 00:53:28,723
to whether he would come or not.

926
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:36,007
Well, the last person
we thought would ever be killed

927
00:53:36,007 --> 00:53:38,727
was my Uncle Charlie Tucker.

928
00:53:38,727 --> 00:53:43,087
He was such a... macho person.

929
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:46,367
He just did everything well.

930
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:51,047
And we just never thought
anything would happen to Charlie.

931
00:53:51,047 --> 00:53:54,767
If anyone would come through the war,
it would be Charlie.

932
00:53:54,767 --> 00:54:01,087
So when the news came
that Charlie was missing in action

933
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:03,407
at Guadalcanal,

934
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:06,047
we were devastated.

935
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:08,007
We kept thinking

936
00:54:08,007 --> 00:54:12,967
they would find him
on an island, alive.

937
00:54:12,967 --> 00:54:17,767
We kept thinking that maybe his plane
had gone down some place

938
00:54:17,767 --> 00:54:21,087
where he could get ashore
and be saved.

939
00:54:21,087 --> 00:54:25,407
In fact, it was four years
before we finally gave up,

940
00:54:25,407 --> 00:54:27,927
that they would never find Charlie,

941
00:54:27,927 --> 00:54:32,647
because we just did not think
the Lord would take him.

942
00:54:32,647 --> 00:54:36,196
But you know the wonderful thing?
He stays 22 years old.

943
00:54:37,727 --> 00:54:39,207
WOMAN: That's beautiful.

944
00:54:39,207 --> 00:54:42,647
During the entire war,
I made up my mind

945
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:45,687
that I would never marry
a man in uniform,

946
00:54:45,687 --> 00:54:48,167
because I loved the uniforms.

947
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:51,967
So I thought, "Well, then,
maybe I would marry him

948
00:54:51,967 --> 00:54:54,287
"and realise I didn't like him at all,

949
00:54:54,287 --> 00:54:56,327
"that it was all the uniform."

950
00:54:56,327 --> 00:55:00,767
So I did not marry till after the war

951
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:04,487
because of that as much as anything.

952
00:55:04,487 --> 00:55:07,807
And the man I did marry
had on a uniform,

953
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:11,247
but it was a pilot's uniform.

954
00:55:11,247 --> 00:55:16,367
And I never saw him in his dress navy
uniform till the day I married him,

955
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:19,207
and he wore it in our wedding.

956
00:55:19,207 --> 00:55:22,327
So... Oh, and I did like him in it.

957
00:55:22,327 --> 00:55:25,046
I really did!
