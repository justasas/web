00:00:56,722 --> 00:01:01,026
        QUENTIN AANENSON:       
       We were all granted      
      about ten days' leave     

3
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:05,530
       for our final visit      
          to our homes.         

4
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:12,270
   This was around the middle   
         of April, 1944.        

5
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,705
     So I went up to Luverne    

6
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:20,178
       to see my parents,       
    my brothers and sisters.    

7
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,849
   And it was a very difficult  
     time, because I knew...    

8
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,585
        I had the orders        
        in my possession        

9
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,154
    that would be sending me    

10
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:32,857
     to the European theater    
         of operations,         

11
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,692
         and I knew that        
      we had been assigned      

12
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:41,899
 to fly this terribly dangerous 
     type of combat mission.    

13
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,302
              So...             

14
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,871
       when I was leaving       

15
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:49,607
       and saying good-bye      
      to my mother and dad,     

16
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:54,079
      we went to the train      
       station in Luverne       

17
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:57,415
  to catch the midnight train.  

18
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,118
  My sister Mavis was with me,  

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,555
    and I took her aside and    
   we walked down the platform  

20
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:08,759
   for a ways, and I told her   
 what my assignment had been... 

21
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:11,796
        and that the odds       
        were pretty great       

22
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,132
  that, uh, I would be killed.  

23
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:18,469
      So I had told her...      

24
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:23,308
      to be very much aware     
       of this possibility      

25
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,178
    and that she should be...   

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,283
  prepared to help my parents.  

27
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:47,065

  is massed for the giant blow  
designed to knock out the Nazi--

30
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,551
     an astounding panorama     

31
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:12,957
     of everything that you     
    can think of... and more.   

32
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,262
    Invasion shipping massed    
       in British harbors       

33
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:20,665
   along the English Channel--  
        barges and boats.       

34
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,867
    Imagine those stacked-up    
        amphibious craft        

35
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:28,472
   when they stream in swarms   
        for the landing.        

36
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:32,110
         Bombers, which,        
     in the ground invasion     

37
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,512
     must keep on hammering,

         the final phase        
      of the European war.      

42
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:48,059
    Acres of planes reaching

00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:01,406
            NARRATOR:           
   By the late spring of 1944,  

45
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,874
   on both sides of the world,  

46
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:08,713
 there were signs that the tide 
    of war had begun to turn.   

47
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:14,185
 The Allies had stopped Japan's 
    expansion in the Pacific.   

48
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,355
   They had taken Guadalcanal   
         in the Solomons        

49
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,557
   and Tarawa in the Gilberts,  

50
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:23,628
      had savaged the enemy     
        fleet at Midway,        

51
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,532
  and had begun the long climb  
      from island to island     

52
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:31,936
  toward the Japanese homeland. 

53
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:43,348
    In the European theater,    

54
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,483
         the Allies had         
      cleared North Africa      

55
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:49,987
 of Axis forces and taken Rome. 

56
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:56,127
   Allied warplanes were still  
 bombing Germany night and day. 

57
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,197
   The Battle of the Atlantic   
          had been won,         

58
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,798
  the sea lanes were now open,  

59
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,404
and men and weapons and supplies
   were flooding into Britain.  

60
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,273
  And in the east, the Red Army 

61
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,810
     had driven the Germans     
        from the Ukraine        

62
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,079
   and was moving into Poland.  

63
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:21,886
      Back home, in places      
    like Luverne, Minnesota;    

64
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:25,390
     Waterbury, Connecticut;    

65
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,992
        Mobile, Alabama;        

66
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,262
   and Sacramento, California,  

67
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:37,035
 Americans did their best to go 
    about their normal lives.

         But in the back        
       of everyone's mind,      

76
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:20,011
  hope was combined with dread. 

77
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:23,113
    In spite of the progress    
       that had been made,

        so far in the war       

79
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,352
  had been a mere preliminary.  

80
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:33,024
       The Japanese empire      
      had begun to shrink,      

81
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,426
but its rulers seemed determined

82
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:39,664
     to defend to the death     
   every island that remained.  

83
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,800
      Rome may have fallen,     

84
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,970
        but everyone knew       
  that Hitler's grip on Europe  

85
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,071
       could not be broken      

86
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,674
       until Allied troops      
  crossed the English Channel,  

87
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,710
   smashed the German defenses  

88
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:56,080
       and drove the Nazis      
         out of France.         

89
00:06:56,082 --> 00:07:01,118
      Hundreds of thousands     
of sons and fathers and husbands

90

97
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:26,777
        just up the road        
        from Waterbury--        

98
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,081
    went home to say good-bye   
   to his family that spring.   

99
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,986
        He had his orders       
         to go overseas,        

100
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,756
          and it seemed         
       to him and to them,      

101
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,324
      that he would likely      
         be one of those        

102
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:45,095
    who would be asked to run   
       that terrible risk.      

103
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,363
             VAGHI:             
      It was very difficult     

104
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:52,737
because I had two other brothers
     already in the service     

105
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,173
  she knew all of us were going 
        to go eventually.       

106
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:58,142
     And, as it turned out,     
         we all did go.         

107
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,877
 All of us were in the service. 

108
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,579
      And that... that was      
         kind of rough.         

109
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:03,981
  But leaving, she had chin up, 

110
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,084
        you know, she...        
      we spoke in Italian.      

111
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,620
  She spoke English very well,  

112
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:13,657
     but she said all of the    
 sentimental things in Italian. 

113
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,196
   She said,<i> "Mio caro figlio,</i>  
       <i> Dio stai con lei.</i>       

114
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:22,066

   that the Allies were going

 that Soviet leader Josef Stalin

        gun emplacements,       

133
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,781
  radar and observation towers  

134
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:47,085
   and bunkers that stretched   
          from Denmark          

135
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,721
        all the way south       
    to the Spanish frontier.    

136
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:03,901
        Meanwhile, across       
      the English Channel,      

137
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,203
       more than a million      
      and a half Americans      

138
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,940
       were now in Britain      
     waiting for the signal     

139
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,241
     to start the invasion,     

140
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:15,679
an invasion that would determine
     the success or failure     

141
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,449
 of the Allied effort in Europe.

142
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:26,257
    General Dwight Eisenhower   
     was in overall command.    

143
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:30,561
   The assault was to proceed   
        in three phases.        

144
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,297
       First, paratroopers      
        would be dropped        

145
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,600
       behind the beaches       
      in the dead of night      

146
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:39,570
 to confuse the enemy and seize 
      the roads and bridges     

147
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:43,274
   that led inland from them.   

148
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,609
      Then, wave after wave     
          of airplanes          

149
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,913
 were to batter German defenses,
  destroying enemy emplacements 

150
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,783
      and creating craters      
         on the beaches         

151
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:57,454
     in which assault troops    
       could take shelter.      

152
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:01,959
   Finally, a massive flotilla  
     was to ferry thousands     

153
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:05,262
      of British, Canadian      
       and American troops      

154
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,364
    toward the French coast.    

155
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,968
    Allied commanders planned   
    five coordinated landings   

156
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,772
     along a 45-mile stretch    
    of the Normandy coastline   

157
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,609
 between the Cotentin Peninsula 
       and the Orne River.      

158
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:23,714
   Canadian and British troops  
under General Bernard Montgomery

159
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,948
  would fight their way ashore  

160
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,354
  at beaches code-named "Gold," 
      "Juno," and "Sword,"      

161
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,522
   where they were also meant   

162
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,459
    to take the city of Caen,   
       nine miles inland.       

163
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,231
           Americans,           
   under General Omar Bradley,  

164
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:44,468
          would assault         
   "Utah" and "Omaha" beaches.  

165
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,309
    AL McINTOSH (dramatized):   
       Luverne, Minnesota.      

166
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,813
          May 25, 1944.         

167
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:59,717
           "Outwardly,          
  things haven't changed here.  

168
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,954
           "The lilacs          
     are out in full bloom.     

169
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:06,524
        "The countryside        
       was never greener.       

170
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,260
       "At night there are      
         a million stars        

171
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:13,197
    "winking in the sky, with   
  a couple of million bullfrogs

         Al McIntosh,

183
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,759
          PAUL FUSSELL:         
We tend to call it the real war.

184
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:19,497
        The rest of it's        
     just the show-biz war.     

185
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,966
  The real war involves getting 
 down there and killing people, 

186
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:27,138
    and being killed yourself   
   or just barely escaping it.  

187
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,475
   And it gives you attitudes   
      about life and death      

188
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,146
      that are unobtainable     
         anywhere else.         

189
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:46,623
        RADIO ANNOUNCER:        
 Soldiers, sailors and airmen of
 the Allied Expeditionary Force,

190
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:51,128
  you are about to embark upon  
       the great crusade,       

191
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,467
  toward which we have striven  
       these many months.       

192
00:13:56,469 --> 00:14:00,537
      The eyes of the world     
          are upon you.         

193
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:05,909
    The hopes and prayers of    
liberty-loving people everywhere

194
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:09,113
         march with you.        

195
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:20,323
            NARRATOR:           
The greatest invasion in history
    began just after midnight   

196
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:23,894
        on June 6, 1944--       

197
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,262
             D-Day--            

198
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,998
          as the first          
     of 24,000 paratroopers,    

199
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,768
     flown over the Channel     
  in more than 1,000 aircraft,  

200
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:37,675
 were dropped behind enemy lines
          in Normandy.          

201
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,078
     The Germans' theory of     
  the defense of the continent  

202
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,949
    was they put, they built    
  pillboxes along the coastline 

203
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,284
          and they put          
     their old troops in it.    

204
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,521
          Then they put         
     their Panzer divisions     

205
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:54,391
     and their SS divisions     
    and their good divisions    

206
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,926
     back in central points,    

207
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,029
      the theory being that     
     when we hit the beach,     

208
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:01,265
     they would come in from    
 those points and drive us off. 

209
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,868
  Our job was to get in between 
       them and the beach       

210
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,172
     and to have them hit us    
      instead of the beach.     

211
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:15,679
            NARRATOR:           
 Most of the men of the British 
 6th Airborne dropped on target,

212
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:20,150
 reassembled, and within an hour
 had achieved their objectives, 

213
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,286
     seizing bridges across     
    the Orne and Dives Rivers   

214
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:26,957
      to keep German tanks      
  from mounting a counterattack 

215
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,859
        along the coast.        

216
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,961
      On the western flank,     

217
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:34,498
      the 16,000 Americans      
     belonging to the 101st     

218
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,502
   and 82nd Airborne divisions  
      were less fortunate.      

219
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,406
       Low-hanging clouds       
      blocked the moonlight     

220
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,675
 and obscured the landing zones.

221
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:47,110
       The narrow neck of       
     the Cotentin Peninsula     

222
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,513
  was hard to hit from the air. 

223
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:53,584
     Many paratroopers fell     
    helplessly into the sea.    

224
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,153
     Others landed in fields    
        and river valleys       

225
00:15:56,155 --> 00:16:01,859
     flooded by the Germans     
          and drowned.          

226
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:05,996
  Some were blown from the sky  
    as German tracer bullets    

227
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:10,600
     set off the explosives     
          they carried.         

228
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,036
Still others were dropped so low

229
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,006
        their parachutes        
     had no chance to open.     

230
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,075
  They hit, one man remembered, 

231
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,010
with "a sound like ripe pumpkins

232
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:23,713
        being thrown down       
      against the ground."      

233
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:33,924
  The men of the 101st Airborne 
   were scattered over an area  

234
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,961
 25 miles long by 15 miles wide.

235
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,263
     Most of them got lost.     

236
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:45,769
 24 hours later, their commander
  had still been unable to find 

237
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:49,372
         more than half         
       his surviving men.       

238
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,654
         (rapid gunfire)        

239
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:07,757
  Elements of the 82nd Airborne 
     came down in and around    

240
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:10,360
         the little town        
     of Sainte Mère-Eglise,     

241
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,297
     just behind Utah Beach.    

242
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,000
 The fighting was already raging

243
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:20,504
     when a glider carrying     
 Dwain Luce of Mobile, Alabama, 

244
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:24,841
 headed toward the landing zone.

245
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:27,344
   A survivor of the invasion   
            of Sicily           

246
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,347
   and the landing at Salerno,  
        he was a captain        

247
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:35,418
    in the 320th Glider Field   
      Artillery Battalion.      

248
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,521
              LUCE:             
  We had been in combat before  

249
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,891
    and we knew kind of what    
      we were getting into,     

250
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,128
      but, uh, we knew this     
        was the big bang        

251
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:51,302
 and it was... it was kind of...
    worrisome, you might say.   

252
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:54,738
            NARRATOR:           
   Gliders were something new   
           in warfare:          

253
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,243
  silent, ideal for clandestine 
  landings behind enemy lines,  

254
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,546
     and capable of ferrying    
     equipment and vehicles     

255
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:07,618
     too heavy to be dropped    
        in any other way.       

256
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,655
   But they were also fragile,  
 covered with flammable fabric, 

257
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,591
      and hard to control.      

258
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,593
   And in some landing zones,   

259
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,897
 the Germans had placed forests 
       of sharpened poles       

260
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:25,468
       to tear them apart       
   and impale the men aboard.   

261
00:18:26,804 --> 00:18:30,106
   More than half the gliders   
     missed their drop zones    

262
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:33,743
      and scores of pilots      
   and passengers were crushed  

263
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,581
   when vehicles and artillery  
     pieces slammed forward     

264
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,318
     during crash landings.     

265
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:48,658
              LUCE:             
 I remember, in my glider, I was
  sitting up next to the pilot  

266
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,227
 and I leaned over his shoulder 
          to look at it         

267
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,931
  and we dove over those trees, 
 we were doing 110 miles an hour

268
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,066
         and I thought,         
    this is no speed to land.   

269
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,702
 But it was too late to change. 

270
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:10,080
   I fortunately did not land   
 in front of any antitank guns, 

271
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,116
       which were vicious.      

272
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,387
   I had a friend that landed   
    in front, in front of one   

273
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:19,590
     and he was cut in half.    

274
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,525
    And, uh, those are things   

275
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,895
  you don't like to think about 
         or talk about.         

276
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:31,535
            NARRATOR:           
       Dwain Luce somehow       
    made it out of his glider   

277
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,406
    and quickly found himself   
  part of the continuing battle 

278
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:39,209
   to hold Sainte Mère-Eglise.  

279
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,147
              LUCE:             
       Oh, we had a fight,      

280
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:46,417
         and the Germans        
   moved people in in a hurry.  

281
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,285
       (machine gun fire)       

282
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:52,322
       You see, we didn't       
      have heavy weapons...     

283
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:56,727
      and we were fighting      
         heavy weapons.         

284
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:03,233
            NARRATOR:           
   The fighting was confused.   

285
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:07,237
There were no established lines.

286
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,739
              LUCE:             
 There was some guy up on a hill

287
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,274
         above me trying        
       to disrupt my life.      

288
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,412
  He was, he was shooting at us 
and trying to, trying to get us.

289
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:20,417
 And it's kind of like cops and 
  robbers in a degree because,  

290
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,953
    I mean, you were in there   
     mixed up all with them.    

291
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:26,456
     they wasn't on one side    
    and we were on the other;   

292
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,759
we were all like scrambled eggs.

293
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:39,736
            NARRATOR:           
  Surrounded, isolated, out of  
 communication with one another,

294
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:44,475
     Dwain Luce and his unit    
 struggled to hold their ground 

295
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:45,809
     and block German tanks,    

296
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,244
        while they waited       
      for the landing force     

297
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:53,550
       to take Utah Beach       
    and come to their rescue.   

298
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,854
              LUCE:             
       Whenever we went in      
        behind the lines,       

299
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:01,257
      they always gave us,      
          uh, morphine.         

300
00:21:02,459 --> 00:21:06,763
 The morphine was a little thing
     like a toothpaste tube     

301
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:12,536
except it had a sharp, uh, point
when you unscrewed it, you know,

302
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:15,071
    and you could then stick    
     the needle and break it    

303
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,541
and then you pop it in your arm.

304
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:22,613
    We were back there where    
   if you really got hit bad,   

305
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:26,082
 nobody could take care of you. 

306
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:32,022
       Sainte Mère-Eglise,      
         it was a mess.         

307
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,591
            Terrible.           

308
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:45,268
            AANENSON:           
      Early in the morning      

309
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,104
        we were awakened        
        from our bunks--        

310
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,940
     about 25 or 30 of us--     

311
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:53,910
    at the air base that was    
       just above London,       

312
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:57,681
       and we were told to      
     get in our flight gear     

313
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,849
 and meet in the briefing room. 

314
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:06,690
  And so we assembled in there, 
       just barely awake,       

315
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,493
           and we knew          
    it was something serious.   

316
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,729
          We could tell         
     by just the atmosphere.    

317
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:17,100
There were two or three briefing
    officers up at the front.   

318
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:21,772
      They had a large map      
        that was covered,       

319
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:27,511
  and as we took our seats and  
  they pulled the curtain back, 

320
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:32,315
           they said,           
     "Gentlemen, this is it.    

321
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,952
     The invasion of France     
           has begun."          

322
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:38,021
            NARRATOR:           
          At 4:30 a.m.,         

323
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,425
   Quentin Aanenson of Luverne  
       took off for France      

324
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:46,496
      as part of the flight     
     of 11,000 warplanes...     

325
00:22:47,732 --> 00:22:50,634
    Lightnings and Lancasters   
         and Liberators;        

326
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:53,036
     Mosquitos and Marauders    
          and Mustangs;         

327
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,240
   Spitfires and Thunderbolts   
     and Flying Fortresses,     

328
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:02,079
   assigned to bomb and strafe  
   and batter German defenses   

329
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:06,049
     before the first troops    
     landed on the beaches.     

330
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:18,996
    It was Quentin Aanenson's   
      first combat mission.     

331
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:23,500
  As we came in over Normandy,  
    I looked off to the left,   

332
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,934
  and it was just a short look, 

333
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:29,005
      and I realized later      
  I was looking at Omaha Beach. 

334
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:04,074
    We had to be very careful   
         of our timing,         

335
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,042
  and we had to be very careful 

336
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,143
    that we didn't go inland    
            too far,            

337
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,346
    because the paratroopers    
   had been dropped in there.   

338
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,116
   And we didn't know exactly   
        where they were.        

339
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:17,687
And as it turned out they didn't
  know where they were either.  

340
00:24:24,562 --> 00:24:31,735
            NARRATOR:           
   Aanenson dropped his bombs   
   and headed back to England.  

341
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,939
            AANENSON:           
It was a mixture of some clouds,

342
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,809
      but we could see down     
        into the Channel        

343
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:42,612
      and it was impossible     
          to understand         

344
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,347
   really what we were seeing.  

345
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,883
  There were ships everywhere.  

346
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:04,501
    ERNIE PYLE (dramatized):    
  "The best way I can describe  
        this vast armada        

347
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,336
    "and the frantic urgency    
         of the traffic         

348
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:11,007
     "is to suggest that you    
    visualize New York Harbor   

349
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,677
 "on its busiest day of the year

350
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,713
     "and then just enlarge     
           that scene           

351
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:20,617
         "all the ocean         
    the human eye can reach,    

352
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,685
   clear around the horizon."   

353
00:25:23,988 --> 00:25:25,188
     "And over the horizon.     

354
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,060
    There are dozens of times   
           that many."          

355
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:34,564
           Ernie Pyle.          

356
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:56,086
            NARRATOR:           
     More than 5,300 ships,     
      carrying 176,000 men,     

357
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,954
         were streaming         
       across the Channel:      

358
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:02,358
    battleships and tugboats,   
       cruisers and barges      

359
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,327
      and rusty freighters;     

360
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,429
   gunboats and hospital ships  

361
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:10,934
   and converted ocean liners;  
  ships filled with ammunition  

362
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:14,137
 and ships equipped to lay down 
        screens of smoke        

363
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,205
     to mystify the enemy--     

364
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,776
       and a fleet of more      
    than 2,000 landing craft    

365
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:23,747
    to ferry men and supplies   
          to the beach.         

366
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:38,895
 Joseph Vaghi was assigned to be
   a beachmaster that morning.  

367
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:43,800
   It would be his job to use   
flags, blinkers, and a megaphone

368
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,903
      to get men, vehicles,     
          and supplies          

369
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:51,241
  safely ashore on Omaha Beach. 

370
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:54,744
  It was his first combat, too. 

371
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,012
             VAGHI:             
         I had no fear.         

372
00:26:56,014 --> 00:27:00,417
     We prayed as a platoon,    
       we prayed together.      

373
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,585
        And said, "Well,        
        it's God's will.        

374
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,087
 "They want us to go over there 

375
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,122
       "and get this devil      
         off the thing.         

376
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:06,889
       "We're gonna do it.      

377
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:10,426
       We know what to do,      
        and we're ready."       

378
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:16,499
 I wasn't scared only because I 
had not experienced this before.

379
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:20,636
         WALTER EHLERS:         
   The more you're in combat,   

380
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:24,407
        the more tension        
    you get as time goes on,    

381
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,541
      because the odds are      

382
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,410
       that you may not be      
        going to make it        

383
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:31,714
   because you've seen so many  
        other people die.       

384
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,419
      I'd get so sick when      
    I was going into combat,    

385
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,955
          I'd... until          
   that first shot was fired,   

386
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,323
     why I thought I was...     

387
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,526
  my stomach was going to turn  
    inside out or something,    

388
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,861
 but when the first shots went, 
       all that goes away.      

389
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:49,399
            NARRATOR:           
   Among the thousands of men   
    moving toward the beaches   

390
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,269
        were two veterans       
      of earlier invasions      

391
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,604
   in North Africa and Sicily.  

392
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,339
         They were from         
       Manhattan, Kansas--      

393
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:00,510
  Staff Sergeant Walter Ehlers  
 and his older brother, Roland. 

394
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,847
             EHLERS:            
       He was a little bit      
         shorter than I.        

395
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,885
He had red hair, and he had blue
   eyes and a beautiful smile.  

396
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:10,954
 And he was a perfect gentleman 
          all the time.         

397
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:14,657
  And he, uh, he was immaculate 
    in dress and everything.    

398
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,760
      And he tended to keep     
        me that way, too.       

399
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,396
           (chuckles)           

400
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:44,087
            NARRATOR:           
At 6:30 a.m., the invasion force
   began landing in Normandy.   

401
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:47,724
     Utah Beach came first.     

402
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,726
       Drifting smoke that      
       obscured the target      

403
00:28:50,728 --> 00:28:54,497
 and strong currents that drove 
 their landing craft off course 

404
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:58,668
brought the Americans into shore
      more than 2,000 yards     

405
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,571
      from the spot chosen      
        by the planners.        

406
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,440
           But General          
    Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.,    

407
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:07,644
     armed only with a cane,    
         rallied his men        

408
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:12,148
  and took the beachhead anyway 
      in less than an hour.     

409
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:18,321
   Of the 23,000 men who went   
      ashore at Utah Beach,     

410
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:22,125
       only 197 were lost.      

411
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:27,196
 By late morning, American tanks
    were moving off the beach   

412
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:30,767
to rendezvous with the embattled
          82nd Airborne         

413
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,503
     at Sainte Mère-Eglise.     

414
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:38,074
           DWAIN LUCE:          
       We were back there       
       and we didn't know       

415
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:41,478
        what was going on       
     on the beach, for sure.    

416
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,413
     We knew that the beach     
           would hold           

417
00:29:43,415 --> 00:29:44,714
 if we'd have got our job done. 

418
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:48,752
        We also knew that       
    if the beach didn't hold,   

419
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,454
we would probably be left there,
     we would be abandoned,     

420
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,555
    they couldn't get us out.   

421
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:55,191
      So naturally, it was      
     of great interest to us    

422
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:59,262
       to get our job done      
     and see the beach hold.    

423
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:02,232
        One of the things       
     I will always remember,    

424
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,333
  with a great deal of emotion, 

425
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,701
       is that first tank       
       that came through.       

426
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:11,808
     Because that first tank    
          came through,         

427
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,509
    I knew the beach had held   

428
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:17,314
 and I knew help was on the way.

429
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:34,897
            NARRATOR:           
    British troops would take   

430
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:38,567
   the Gold and Sword beaches   
         almost as fast,        

431
00:30:38,569 --> 00:30:40,036
       though German tanks      
         prevented them         

432
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:46,309
    from capturing their next   
  objective, the city of Caen.  

433
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:50,046
 Canadian troops took Juno, too,

434
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:53,249
    although 90 of their 306    
  landing craft were destroyed  

435
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:57,087
      by German obstacles,      
     and one in every 18 men    

436
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:01,958
     in their invading force    
     was killed or wounded.     

437
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,859
       Still, they managed      

438
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:07,430
       to fight their way       
       seven miles inland       

439
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,901
          by nightfall.         

440
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:20,543
  But for the Americans in the  
 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions

441
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,345
    approaching Omaha Beach,    

442
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,247
the most difficult landing site,

443
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:28,350
        almost everything       
         would go wrong.        

444
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:33,089
     Omaha was the broadest     
      of the five beaches,      

445
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,960
        and the deepest,        
   with 100 yards of pebbles,   

446
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:42,165
  then sand dunes, barbed wire  
     and thick undergrowth,     

447
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,402
    all of it heavily mined.    

448
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,706
     Behind all that loomed     
        formidable bluffs       

449
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,775
          fortified by          
      2,000 German troops,      

450
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:57,046
  many of them battle-seasoned  
            veterans.           

451
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:02,585
 <i> Stützpunkts,</i> or strongholds,  
  overlooked the four gullies   

452
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:07,724
  that led inland-- each manned 
by 70 Germans with machine guns,

453
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:11,260
   mortars, and armor-piercing  
           howitzers,           

454
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:18,100
    all zeroed in on the men    
  about to try to come ashore.  

455
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:24,140
        During Phase Two,       

456
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:29,112
American pilots had dropped most
  of their bombs miles inland.  

457
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:33,983
   There were no bomb craters   
    in which to take shelter,   

458
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:40,490
  and the naval bombardment had 
 barely dented German defenses. 

459
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:06,115
             VAGHI:             
    As we are approaching it,   
we see ships to the right of us,

460
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,283
    ships to the left of us.    

461
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:10,820
      The skies are loaded      
   with these flying balloons.  

462
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:15,825
The battleships are shooting and
 you could see the projectiles, 

463
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,628
     the 14-inch projectiles    
     from the battle wagons,    

464
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,196
     going through the air.     

465
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:24,000
      The smell of powder.      

466
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,303
       We didn't know what      
      we were going to hit      

467
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,607
      when we got in there.     

468
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:34,677
            NARRATOR:           
    Men had been transferred    
     to their landing craft     

469
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,647
       12 miles from shore      
  and while it was still dark,  

470
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:43,919
     so that many boats lost    
their proper positions going in.

471
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,221
       The sea was rough.       

472
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,424
      The men, most of whom     
        had had no sleep,       

473
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:53,629
 were wet and cold and seasick. 

474
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:59,168
 The amphibious tanks that were 
    supposed to lead the way    

475
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,404
        and provide cover       
        for the infantry        

476
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,274
          were released         
       too far out at sea;      

477
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:09,479
 32 tanks rolled off the vessels
       that carried them,       

478
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:13,549
      and all but five went     
     straight to the bottom.    

479
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:18,788
       Most of their crews      
      were trapped inside.      

480
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,260
   Landing craft were swamped;  

481
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,996
         scores of men,         
    burdened with equipment,    

482
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:30,233
         slowly drowned,        
       screaming for help       

483
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,801
     as other boats wallowed    
           past them.           

484
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:38,307
    Commanders were forbidden   
    to stop and pick them up.   

485
00:34:43,113 --> 00:34:46,549
        Along the bluffs,       
   the Germans held their fire  

486
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:50,486
  until the first landing craft 
       shuddered to a stop      

487
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:53,590
    and the ramps went down.    

488
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:01,864
   Many men were ripped apart   
     by German machine guns     

489
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:04,400
   before they could step off.  

490
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:08,737
     Hundreds more were hit     
          in the water.         

491
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:13,575
 Some badly wounded men made it 
  to the waterline, collapsed,  

492
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:19,849
        then lay helpless       
   as the tide rose over them.  

493
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,932
        Those who managed       
          to push past          

494
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,833
       the dead and dying       
         in the shallows        

495
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:44,507
  found they had nowhere to go  
  once they reached the shore.  

496
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:49,245
 Some scrabbled at the sand and 
 shale, trying to dig foxholes. 

497
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,949
     Others huddled together    
  behind wrecked landing craft  

498
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,717
      or German obstacles--     

499
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:00,089
     only to find themselves    
    under concentrated fire.    

500
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:06,161
             EHLERS:            
  We were about a hundred yards 
    out and we hit a sandbar.   

501
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:09,732
 We asked the pilot of the boat,
 "Is this as far as it's going?"

502
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,467
          And he says,          
     "As far as it can go."     

503
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,504
    So he lets the ramp down    
  and so we rush out the front, 

504
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:18,407
 and we go in the water and it's
 clear up to my neck like this. 

505
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,843
      (continuous gunfire)      

506
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:25,047
     But we got all the guys    
       up onto the beach.       

507
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:30,552
 And we saw bodies on the beach,
    and bodies in the water,    

508
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:33,689
       and there's bodies       
     laying up on the beach.    

509
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,159
          Most of them          
     that we saw were dead.     

510
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:39,028
        They've wiped out       
        a whole company.        

511
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,129
        They've wiped out       
         whole platoons.        

512
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,499
      They wiped out whole      
      squads, and so forth.     

513
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:48,170
            NARRATOR:           
          A second wave         
  of frightened men came ashore 

514
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:51,007
       and stalled behind       
   the remnants of the first.   

515
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:55,812
  "Except for one tank that was 
  blasting away on the beach,"  

516
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,646
one of the newcomers remembered,

517
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:01,117
   "the crusade in Europe was,  
   for all practical purposes,  

518
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,186
       "disarmed and naked      
       before its enemies.      

519
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:08,658
  A single company of riflemen  
     could have descended,"     

520
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,394
   he said, "and swept us up."  

521
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:18,801
   (explosion, rapid gunfire)   

522
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:24,407
       Joe Vaghi's platoon      
      came ashore at 7:35.      

523
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:28,511
             VAGHI:             
     Things happened so fast    

524
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,947
        that you saw men        
      who were being shot,      

525
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,516
       you saw them fall.       

526
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:36,352
      These things you<i> saw.</i>     

527
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:40,723
       The fact that, uh,       
        this is for real.       

528
00:37:43,993 --> 00:37:47,029
            NARRATOR:           
        Somehow, everyone       
       in Vaghi's platoon       

529
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,165
       managed to make it       
         onto the beach,        

530
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,834
         but it remained        
         a killing zone,        

531
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,570
      choked with shattered     
      and burning equipment     

532
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:58,174
        and desperate men       
      unable to move inland     

533
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:01,344
   or retreat from enemy fire.  

534
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:05,814
   Joe Vaghi did what he could  
to bring order out of the chaos,

535
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:10,086
  directing his men, struggling 
 to clear a path off the beach, 

536
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:14,257
       helping the wounded      
         and the dying.         

537
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:16,792
             VAGHI:             
       I was bending down.      

538
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,628
       There was a corpse       
        on the stretcher,       

539
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,232
       and as I bent down,      
         this shell hit.        

540
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:27,903
      Well, when I came to,     
    my clothes were on fire.    

541
00:38:29,506 --> 00:38:32,875
            NARRATOR:           
          Vaghi was hit         
       in the right knee.       

542
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:37,180
    struggling to remove cans   
 of gasoline from a burning jeep

543
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:38,681
    before they could explode   

544
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:43,218
    and kill the wounded men    
      lying all around him.     

545
00:38:49,192 --> 00:38:54,563
 Far off-shore, General Bradley 
   considered abandoning Omaha  

546
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:58,134
     rather than sending in     
        more men to die.        

547
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:06,876
       Then, the Americans      
       began to improvise.      

548
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:12,248
    Commanders defied orders    
           and risked           

549
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,749
       tearing the bottoms      
        from their ships,       

550
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,819
      to bring them within      
  a thousand yards of the beach 

551
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,955
       and use their guns       
      to finally knock out      

552
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:23,526
      the German pillboxes      
      and gun emplacements.     

553
00:39:26,663 --> 00:39:31,033
    And on the beach itself,    
 officers and enlisted men alike

554
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,470
   began taking their survival  
      into their own hands.     

555
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,538
  "They're murdering us here!"  

556
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,408
       one wounded officer      
       shouted to his men.      

557
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,612
   "Let's move inland and get   
    murdered there instead!"    

558
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:45,381
         Here and there,        

559
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,551
  individuals got to their feet 
      and started forward.      

560
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:53,189
        Then small groups       
        began to follow.        

561
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,558
             VAGHI:             
   This officer came up to me   

562
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,326
       and saw that I was       
          a beachmaster         

563
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,861
 and I had the power megaphones 

564
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:02,898
  and he said, "Tell these guys 
 to get the hell off the beach."

565
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,900
   So I said, "Got orders here  

566
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,003
   that you're to get the hell  
       off the beach now."      

567
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,840
  The beachmaster said, "Well,  
   you follow that path there,  

568
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,443
       "because if you go       
   to the right or left of it,  

569
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,046
  you'll be stepping on mines." 

570
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:21,116
             VAGHI:             
  This one soldier, he got up,  
 and he put a bangalore torpedo 

571
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,653
     under the barbed wire,     
        blew a gap in it.       

572
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:27,990
 He said, "Come on, follow me," 
       and he led the way.      

573
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:32,762
             EHLERS:            
  I rushed my squad through it. 

574
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,063
    We got off of the beach,    

575
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,431
       and it was probably      
        the biggest thing       

576
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,935
  I ever did in my life was get 
 those 12 men off of the beach. 

577
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:50,646
            NARRATOR:           
   When the Germans continued   
      to block the gullies      

578
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:54,350
 the Americans hurled themselves
      right at the bluffs,      

579
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:58,788
  and attacking enemy positions 
     from the side and rear.    

580
00:41:01,825 --> 00:41:05,294
             EHLERS:            
  We went up, right up the hill 
       into the trenches,       

581
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,330
       and we were chasing      
        the Germans then.       

582
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,665
    We captured four of them    
    and sent them back down,    

583
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:12,635
         and then we got        
       behind the pillbox       

584
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,171
    some escaped because they   
     were running from us--     

585
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:21,310
   but we got that particular   
        pillbox that day.       

586
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:28,951
            NARRATOR:           
  By 1:00, after more than six  
  hours of desperate fighting,  

587
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:33,489
        German resistance       
      had begun to weaken.      

588
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:38,861
           (explosion)          

589
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,196
  And as the afternoon went on, 

590
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:44,900
    combat engineers managed    
    to clear a safe boat path   

591
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:46,068
      through the shallows,     

592
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,671
    bulldozed five new exits    
        from the beach...       

593
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:54,109
  and built a road that men and 
  vehicles could follow inland. 

594
00:41:54,944 --> 00:41:58,781
   35 engineers died doing it.  

595
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,148
  It had been the bloodiest day 
       in American history      

596
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,453
  since the Battle of Antietam  
        in the Civil War.       

597
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,360
      Many of the survivors     
         were in shock,         

598
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:49,765
    unable to comprehend what   
   they'd just been through...  

599
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:53,469
         unsure of what         
      they'd accomplished.      

600
00:42:58,474 --> 00:43:04,480
  Some 2,500 American soldiers  
    lay dead on French soil.    

601
00:43:26,035 --> 00:43:32,942
 Walter Ehlers' brother, Roland,
     was among the missing.     

602
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:36,211
             EHLERS:            
     I thought about looking    
    for my brother, but then,   

603
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,479
  when we looked at that beach, 

604
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:40,115
    there were so many things   
       down on the beach,       

605
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:43,586
     it would be like trying    
 to find a needle in a haystack.

606
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:46,522
     I figured he was either    
    wounded or in a hospital    

607
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:49,458
      and they just didn't      
      have a record of it.      

608
00:44:09,112 --> 00:44:13,015
            NARRATOR:           
     It would be five weeks     
 before Walter Ehlers found out 

609
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,618
        what had happened       
         to his brother.        

610
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,692
             EHLERS:            
      I never saw him die.      

611
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:29,664
     He got killed as he was    
coming down the ramp on his LCI.

612
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:34,069
    His whole squad got, uh,    
      wounded... or killed.     

613
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,774
  I would have rather come back 
    without my arms and legs    

614
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,876
        than to come back       
       without my brother.      

615
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:45,046
      That's, uh... that's      
      what it meant to me.      

616
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,864
    Well, that stayed with me   
       for over 50 years.       

617
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,800
  I had nightmares about that.  

618
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:06,568
   He'd come back every night,  

619
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,638
        and, uh, we'd...        
   he'd be all neatly dressed   

620
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,373
           and smiling          
      like he usually does,     

621
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:16,111
  and we'd have a conversation, 
and first thing, he'd disappear.

622
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:19,748
    Or I'd go to do something   
       and he'd disappear.      

623
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,425
            NARRATOR:           
     In less than 24 hours,     

624
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:38,900
  the Allies had torn a 45-mile 
 gap in Hitler's Atlantic Wall. 

625
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:44,706
They had lost far fewer men than
 their commanders had expected. 

626
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:51,313
      More than 150,000 men     
   were now ashore in France,   

627
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:55,817
      and more men and more     
     equipment and supplies     

628
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,988
 were coming ashore every hour. 

629
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,798
         (phone ringing)        

630
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,566
        RADIO ANNOUNCER:        
     This is Robert St. John    

631
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,601
in the NBC newsroom in New York.

632
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:15,503
      Ladies and gentlemen,     
         all night long         

633
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:18,006
       bulletins have been      
     pouring in from Berlin     

634
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:19,507

        Americans woke up       
        on June 6, 1944,        

660
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:45,960
     to newspaper headlines     
      and radio bulletins.      

661
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:49,631
         It was the news        
    they'd been waiting for.    

662
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:52,568
         But there were         
       no further details,      

663
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,838
      no live radio reports     
        from the beaches.       

664
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,875
        No one knew where       
     their sons and brothers    

665
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:03,379
    and fathers had landed...   

666
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,548
          or how those          
      landings were going.      

667
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:17,760
   In Philadelphia, the mayor   
 gently tapped the Liberty Bell 

668
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:21,563
       for the first time       
     in more than a century.    

669
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:30,305
      In New York, traders      
      on the stock exchange     

670
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,474
      observed two minutes      
           of silence           

671
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,911
   and then went back to work,  

672
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,615
  sending the Dow Jones average 
       soaring 142 points       

673
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:43,918
   to a new high for the year.

       canceled all games.      

675
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:56,432
 Everywhere, church bells rang, 
    calling people to prayer.   

676
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,567
 They knelt or bowed their heads

677
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:02,905
  in factories and schoolrooms  
        and public parks.       

678
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:08,644
          In Waterbury,         
    special masses were said    

679
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:12,714
          at the Church         
  of the Immaculate Conception. 

680
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,850
   There were prayer services   
        at Temple Israel        

681
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:19,521
     and Beth El Synagogue,     
 and on the town green, as well.

682
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:25,794
  In Sacramento, workers at the 
  Pacific Fruit Express Cannery 

683
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:30,298
      prayed for the safety     
     of 100 former employees    

684
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,569
       now in the service.      

685
00:49:34,703 --> 00:49:38,874
       In Mobile that day,      
       no liquor was sold,      

686
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:40,408
   and at the railroad station  

687
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,911
    girls walked up and down    
          the platforms         

688
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:45,246

     the morning newspapers     

689
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:49,317
   so that traveling soldiers   
    could read the headlines.

   our republic, our religion

and our civilization, and to set
   free a suffering humanity.

   stoutness to their hearts,   
  steadfastness in their faith.

  They will need Thy blessings. 

723
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:05,053
           Their road           
    will be long and hard...

    for the enemy is strong.    

725

  He may hurl back our forces.  

726
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:16,331
      Success may not come      
       with rushing speed,      

727
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:21,936

        again and again;

        off Guadalcanal,        

758
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,891
   bombarded Japanese defenses  
            at Munda,           

759
00:54:55,893 --> 00:55:00,295
   and survived an enemy bomb   
      and two torpedo hits      

760
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,464
        off Bougainville.       

761
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:11,039
   A week or so after hearing   
       the news of D-Day,       

762
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,107
        Fahey and the men       
        of the<i> Montpelier</i>       

763
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:16,344
   prepared again for battle.   

764
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:20,382
       She was now a part       
      of an 800-ship fleet,     

765
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:22,684
    steaming toward the next    
       American objective       

766
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:26,054
 in the Pacific-- the Marianas, 

767
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:28,089
   a chain of volcanic islands  

768
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:31,426
       from which the U.S.      
   B-29 Superfortress bombers   

769
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:35,197
      could begin to attack     
     the Japanese homeland.     

770
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,700
The fleet's three most important
     targets in the Marianas    

771
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:44,239
 were Guam, Tinian, and Saipan, 

772
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:48,477
        where the Marines       
        would land first.       

773
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,812
       FAHEY (dramatized):      
            "June 13.           

774
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:56,751
 "In about 14 hours now, we will
    start bombarding Saipan.    

775
00:55:56,753 --> 00:56:00,855
       "We are only about       
     1,200 miles from Tokyo.    

776
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:04,625
     "I guess I will go down    
       and buy some candy.      

777
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,661
       "The candy has been      
         our old standby        

778
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:08,063
  "when we have nothing to eat  

779
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:11,466
       at battle stations       
        for long hours."        

780
00:56:13,502 --> 00:56:18,973
            NARRATOR:           
     Saipan was unlike many     
 of the tiny, flat coral atolls 

781
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,476
         the Marines had        
        taken previously.       

782
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:25,714
      It was 14 miles long,     
  featured all kinds of terrain 

783
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:31,052
    and was defended by more    
  than 30,000 Japanese troops.  

784
00:56:33,055 --> 00:56:34,422
        It was also home        

785
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:40,194
   to somewhere between 16,000  
 and 20,000 Japanese civilians. 

786
00:56:43,198 --> 00:56:44,899
         (alarm blaring)        

787
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,734
    (bosun's whistle blaring)   

788
00:56:55,611 --> 00:57:01,316
     The shelling of Saipan     
      went on for two days.     

789
00:57:12,661 --> 00:57:16,464
        Among the Marines       
     of the Fourth Division     

790
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:21,369
  was Corporal Alvy Ray Pittman 
       of Mobile, Alabama.      

791
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:25,473
He'd been working as a carpenter
      alongside his father      

792
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:29,310
     when he decided to join    
          the Marines.          

793
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:30,879
          RAY PITTMAN:          
       I'd made up my mind      

794
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:33,815
        I want to get in        
  the toughest outfit they had. 

795
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:36,651
    And I was afraid the war    
      was going to get over     

796
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:37,952
    before I got over there.    

797
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,520
  So I joined the Marine Corps. 

798
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:44,392
      'Course, they sent me     
 to Parris Island for boot camp.

799
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:46,661
    And I remember going in,    

800
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:49,030
         all these guys         
   standing out on the grass.   

801
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:53,735
  They said, "You'll be sorry.  
        You'll be sorry."       

802
00:57:57,606 --> 00:58:01,409
            NARRATOR:           
           Ray Pittman          
     was in the first wave,     

803
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:04,746
part of a 16-man demolition team
       assigned to destroy      

804
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:07,282
       enemy strongpoints       
    wherever they were found,   

805
00:58:07,284 --> 00:58:10,151
   using explosives, grenades,  

806
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,820
       and flamethrowers.       

807
00:58:19,995 --> 00:58:23,731
            PITTMAN:            
      You never think about     
     getting hurt yourself.     

808
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:27,268
      You think about maybe     
      some of your buddies      

809
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,638
     are going to get hurt.     

810
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,205
         And you wonder         
      who it's going to be.     

811
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:35,643
  I mean, I really didn't ever  
think about getting hurt myself.

812
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,713
Of course, when you, when you...

813
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:42,216
    slugs start bouncing off    
     your amtrack going in,     

814
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:45,553
    you know it could happen.   

815
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:51,826
            NARRATOR:           
      The naval bombardment     
           had failed.          

816
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:56,431
  Concentrated Japanese mortar  
       and artillery fire       

817
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:58,366
 rained down among the amtracks 

818
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:03,504
     and on the men fighting    
   for a toehold on the beach.  

819
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:09,010
       All four commanders      
    of the assault battalions   

820
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,412
    were hit within minutes.    

821
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:20,388
   By evening, 20,000 Marines   
       had made it ashore,      

822
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,157
  but they could go no further. 

823
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:27,128
  The Japanese planned to keep  
    the Americans pinned down   

824
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:30,698
   until their own fleet could  
  steam in from the Philippines 

825
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,700
        and destroy them.       

826
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,006
   Despite the rain of shells,  

827
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:42,777
   the Marines began slowly to  
 fight their way off the beach. 

828
00:59:54,423 --> 00:59:58,393
            PITTMAN:            
  I know I was scared a lot...  

829
01:00:01,396 --> 01:00:05,467
   and losing a lot of friends  
        really hurts you.       

830
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:11,772
        It's really hard        
       for me to describe,      

831
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:15,910
        really, just how        
      I felt the whole time     

832
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:18,679
    'cause there's something    
       happening every day      

833
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:23,651
   and you're so tired and you  
 can't lift your eyelids hardly.

834
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,086
     And something happens,     

835
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,722
     you get a call to blow     
         a pillbox here,        

836
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:28,823
    to blow a pillbox there.    

837
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:33,861
       I mean, you wake up      
     and go and do your job.    

838
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:40,334
  But it's hard for me to tell  
      just how bad it was--     

839
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:42,436
           how I felt.          

840
01:00:45,006 --> 01:00:49,510
            NARRATOR:           
      The battle for Saipan     
         had just begun.        

841
01:00:57,185 --> 01:01:02,991
SASCHA WEINZHEIMER (dramatized):
      Santo Tomas, Manila.      

842
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,126
        "The rumor about        
        the Japanese army       

843
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:08,096
 taking over the camp was true."

844
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,299
         "If we thought         
    we had reason to complain   

845
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:15,436
    "about how awful our life   
  was in a concentration camp,  

846
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,272
   "we soon changed our minds   

847
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:19,941
      "and knew we had been     
     on a picnic till then.     

848
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:26,247
  "From now on, we would be the 
 same as military war prisoners 

849
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:29,684
  and not civilian prisoners."  

850
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,453
       Sascha Weinzheimer.      

851
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:37,225
            NARRATOR:           
     After the Japanese army    
         assumed control        

852
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:40,995
  of Santo Tomas camp in Manila 
       in the Philippines,      

853
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,298
    they had taken propaganda   
           photographs          

854
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,565
    of some of the prisoners    

855
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,668
   to show how well they were   
         being treated.         

856
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,305
       Sascha Weinzheimer       
     and her younger brother    

857
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:54,108
       were forced to pose      
      for the photographer.     

858
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:58,613
         Things were not        
        as they appeared.       

859
01:01:58,615 --> 01:02:03,751
     For 11-year-old Sascha,    
           her family           

860
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:06,221
            and 4,000           
    other civilian prisoners,   

861
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:10,525
life had gone from bad to worse.

862
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:15,062
Prisoners-- including children--
were made to bow to the officers

863
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:19,166
 and were beaten if they failed 
        to go low enough.       

864
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:25,507
 Food and supplies from friends 
 outside the camp were cut off. 

865
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:32,046
     There was no more meat,    
    just rice and dried fish.   

866
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:36,551
    WEINZHEIMER (dramatized):   
 "So almost everything was taken
      away from us at once.     

867
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:41,355
        We began to know        
    how bad things could be."   

868
01:02:42,424 --> 01:02:44,726
  "Even though Mummy and Daddy  
      kept telling us kids      

869
01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:48,396
"to eat everything on our plates
   because the day would come   

870
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:50,565
         "when we might         
    have very little to eat,    

871
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:54,335
 we didn't really believe them."

872
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:59,440
       Being without food,      
       I think, is, it...       

873
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,975
is one of the worst things ever,

874
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:04,912
      because without that,     
    nothing is functionable.    

875
01:03:07,148 --> 01:03:12,186
  We'd lie down in bed, in the  
 shanty-- we lived in a shanty--

876
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,421
      and I had a mattress      
          on the floor,         

877
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:19,193
     my mother and my father    
 and my sister had one mattress,

878
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:22,096
         and my brother         
      had a small mattress.     

879
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:24,933
       And we'd lie there;      
  we'd have to go to bed early  

880
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:27,101
      because of blackout.      

881
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:30,604
We used to lie down on the floor
   and you'd stick your finger  

882
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:35,943
         in your stomach        
     and feel your backbone.    

883
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:39,080
         (in singsong):         
   "Yeah, I feel my backbone."  

884
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:43,150
       And we'd, you know,      
      this would be a game.     

885
01:03:45,553 --> 01:03:48,722
       These are the games      
  that we played all the time.  

886
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:51,759
     And ironically enough,     
           it helped.           

887
01:04:02,571 --> 01:04:05,240
            NARRATOR:           
   In the late spring of 1944,  

888
01:04:05,242 --> 01:04:08,809
    John and Glennie Frazier    
    of Fort Deposit, Alabama,   

889
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:12,780
       received a telegram      
    from the War Department.    

890
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:17,118
Their son Glenn had been missing
  in action in the Philippines  

891
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:19,053
    for two agonizing years,    

892
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:24,125
and since nothing had been heard
   from him since May of 1942,  

893
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:28,296
           he was now           
    officially presumed dead.   

894
01:04:29,898 --> 01:04:32,267
       Frazier had joined       
        the army in 1941        

895
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:37,372
   in part because he believed  
  that the young woman he loved 

896
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:40,541
       loved someone else.      

897
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:46,614
 He was wrong; she had remained 
   loyal to him all that time.  

898
01:04:47,716 --> 01:04:49,183
    Now with the latest news,   

899
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:54,022
    she began to give up hope   
    of ever seeing him again.   

900
01:04:57,793 --> 01:05:00,528
        But Glenn Frazier       
        was still alive,        

901
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:03,397
   a prisoner of the Japanese.  

902
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,598
            FRAZIER:            
   When I'd think about home,   

903
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,368
 I would think about the things 
       that I missed most       

904
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:11,738
 like ice cream and potato salad
        and some ambrosia       

905
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:15,076
   that my mother used to make  
   for Christmas and so forth.  

906
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,412
          And of course         
     it was always a thought    

907
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,247
  of if we would get back home. 

908
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:23,951
        But it got a time       
   that we were so weak at...   

909
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:27,021
    I had got a time with me    
       that I was so weak       

910
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,856
 until I couldn't even remember 

911
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,691
      whether I had sisters     
          or brothers.          

912
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,193
    I couldn't even remember    
          their names.          

913
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:34,495
     And it comes to a time     
         when you think,        

914
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:35,396
   "Did I have a home back...   

915
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:38,765
       Did I have a home,       
      did I have a family?"     

916
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:44,238
            NARRATOR:           
     Frazier had come close     
     to death several times.    

917
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:48,543
 He had endured the Bataan Death
March and nightmarish conditions

918
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:52,680
  at Camp O'Donnell and Bilibid 
   Prison in the Philippines,   

919
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:56,617
     and he had been forced     
     to perform slave labor     

920
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,586
in prison camps in Japan itself,

921
01:05:58,588 --> 01:06:02,456
      where he had survived     
   double pneumonia, torture,   

922
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,292
       a week of isolation      
        in a covered pit        

923
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:10,497
    and beatings so frequent    
      they became routine.      

924
01:06:14,168 --> 01:06:16,404
      Once, when he failed      
  to lift his feet high enough  

925
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:23,110
  while marching, a guard drove 
    a bayonet into his knee.    

926
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:26,881
            FRAZIER:            
   It started getting infected  
  and it finally got gangrene,  

927
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:30,717
   and Dr. Campbell, which was  
  our American doctor in there, 

928
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:33,787
  had nothing to treat me with  
         except iodine.         

929
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,223
       I would hold a cup       

930
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:39,359
 to catch all the... the blood, 
       and he cut it open       

931
01:06:39,361 --> 01:06:41,862
       with a pocket knife      
   and would get to the point   

932
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:44,799
     to where he would pour     
      pure iodine in there      

933
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:47,468
      to kill the gangrene.     

934
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:51,906
       They were thinking       
    about taking my leg off.    

935
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:55,710
     So I told Dr. Campbell     
       I'd just rather die      

936
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:58,679
   than have my leg taken off.  

937
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:02,082
   So he fought it and we won.  

938
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:05,820
  At one point, there was only  
  a space in the back of my leg 

939
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:08,088
 about a inch-and-a-half across 

940
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:11,992
     that the flesh was just    
   like regular, normal flesh.  

941
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:13,427
   The rest of it was decayed.  

942
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:16,163
   I could open that wound up   
        and see my bone.        

943
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:20,535
            NARRATOR:           
 Frazier's leg eventually healed
    and he went back to work    

944
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:24,938
 on the waterfront at Tanagura, 
  where he and his friends did  

945
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:29,109
   all they could to sabotage   
    the Japanese war effort.    

946
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:30,878
     They risked their lives    

947
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,947
  to drill holes in the bottoms 
         of oil barrels,        

948
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:38,118
   poured sand into gas tanks,  
       wrecked machinery,       

949
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,021
        destroyed a dock        
       and loosened blocks      

950
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,257
             so that            
    a submarine under repairs   

951
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:47,127
 slid into the bay upside down. 

952
01:07:49,597 --> 01:07:53,033
       And through it all,      
     Frazier thought of home    

953
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:57,571
 and of the girl he still hoped 
      somehow to see again.     

954
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,441
            FRAZIER:            
          But the thing         
    that really kept me going   

955
01:08:01,443 --> 01:08:03,243
     is seeing if that girl     
         was still there        

956
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:07,882
and see if, you know, if I still
 in my heart was crazy about her

957
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:09,450
          and the fact          
     that I wanted to live.     

958
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:14,054
     I did not want my body     
  pushing up Japanese daisies.  

959
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:16,357
  And I, I just felt that way,  
         and I thought,         

960
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:20,427
   "They gonna have a heck of   
 a time getting me in a casket."

961
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:36,810
            NARRATOR:           
      Ten days after D-Day,     

962
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:42,983
  bodies were still washing up  
        onto Omaha Beach,       

963
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:45,686
     and because the graves     
       registration crews       

964
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,989
        had moved inland        
   with the advancing troops,   

965
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:52,026
    no one was gathering them   
           for burial.          

966
01:08:54,696 --> 01:08:59,433
    Finally, men from Quentin   
   Aanenson's fighter squadron  

967
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:02,102
     did the job themselves.    

968
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:05,138
   They retrieved the corpses   
        with long poles,        

969
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:09,109
   heaped them with driftwood   
      soaked with gasoline      

970
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:12,313
      and set them ablaze.      

971
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:17,984
   A few days later, Aanenson   
   looked down from the bluff   

972
01:09:17,986 --> 01:09:21,855
    and saw that the problem    
      had not been solved.      

973
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:26,026
    "More bodies were rolling   
  in the surf," he remembered,  

974
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:30,798
     "as the English Channel    
 continued to give up its dead."

975
01:09:33,635 --> 01:09:38,005
       (vehicles rumbling)      

976
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:42,243
      Aanenson's outfit had     
 recently moved to new quarters,

977
01:09:42,245 --> 01:09:44,812
   Advanced Landing Strip A-1,  

978
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:48,215
    a freshly built airfield    
        near Omaha Beach.       

979
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:51,585
  Their mission was to provide  
        close air support       

980
01:09:51,587 --> 01:09:52,787
      for American infantry     

981
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:57,491
      and armor struggling      
   to fight their way inland.   

982
01:09:57,493 --> 01:10:01,161
        By June of 1944,        

983
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:04,865
  the Allies dominated the air. 

984
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,769
            (gunfire)           

985
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:17,411
      Whenever the Germans      
          on the ground         

986
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:18,379
      broke into the open,      

987
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,581
        they were subject       
     to strafing and bombing    

988
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,484
from American P-47 Thunderbolts,

989
01:10:23,486 --> 01:10:26,387
      the kind of aircraft      
         Aanenson flew.         

990
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,954
            (gunfire)           

991
01:10:27,956 --> 01:10:33,393
     Attacks so relentless,     
  the Germans came to call them 

992
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:34,861
        "steel weather."        

993
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,863
         (rapid gunfire)        

994
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:43,170
            AANENSON:           
          It was on one         
    of my very early missions   

995
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:48,976
   that I first knew I had...   
        I had killed men.       

996
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:52,847
  We caught a group of Germans  
       that were on a road      

997
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:54,781
        in an area where        
      there were no trees,      

998
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,784
    and so there was no place   
            for them            

999
01:10:56,786 --> 01:10:58,452
     to... to run and hide.     

1000
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:03,590
 And we caught them before they 
 could really get off the roads 

1001
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:05,960
   and run toward the ditches.  

1002
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:10,063
            (gunfire)           

1003
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:12,833
         And I remember         
     the impact it had on me    

1004
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:16,403
   when I could see my bullets  
     just tearing into them,    

1005
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:19,706
         and... and, uh,        
    we had so much firepower    

1006
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:23,510
           that the...          
      the bodies would fly,     

1007
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:26,246
         uh, some yards,        

1008
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:30,016
and as I... as I was doing this,

1009
01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:32,619
     I was doing it knowing     
         I<i> had</i> to do it,        

1010
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:33,487
       that it was my job.      

1011
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:36,123
          This is what          
    I had been trained to do,   

1012
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,093
    and I dealt with it fine.   

1013
01:11:39,095 --> 01:11:44,965
    But when I got back home    
     to the base in Normandy    

1014
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,167
          and landed...         

1015
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:50,371
           I got sick.          

1016
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:54,942
         I had to think         
     about what I had done.     

1017
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:58,645
     Now, that didn't change    
  my resolve for the next day.  

1018
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,415
  I went out and did it again.  

1019
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:02,750
            (gunfire)           

1020
01:12:02,752 --> 01:12:06,153
 And again and again and again. 

1021
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:16,497
         (piano playing         
 "It's Been a Long, Long Time") 

1022
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:20,934
    ERNIE PYLE (dramatized):    
         "June 23, 1944.        

1023
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,603
    "This Norman countryside    

1024
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:25,639
       "looks exactly like      
      the rich, gentle land     

1025
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:29,476
    of eastern Pennsylvania."   

1026
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:34,548
"It is too wonderfully beautiful
    to be the scene of war."    

1027
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,717
        (birds chirping)        

1028
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:42,523
     "Someday, I would like     
   to cover a war in a country  

1029
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:47,628
 that is as ugly as war itself."

1030
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,963
           Ernie Pyle.          

1031
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:53,133
           (song ends)          

1032
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:55,635
            NARRATOR:           
Normandy's beauty was deceptive.

1033
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:59,473
   Allied planners had failed   
   to understand the landscape  

1034
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:02,410
     through which their men    
       would have to fight      

1035
01:13:02,412 --> 01:13:06,480
before they could begin to drive
    the enemy out of France.    

1036
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:09,049
    (gunfire, artillery fire,   
       indistinct shouts)       

1037
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:13,721
Normandy was quilted with small,
   irregularly shaped fields,   

1038
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,056
     walled from one another    
          by hedgerows,         

1039
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:20,393
earthen ramparts four feet high,
    topped with dense hedges    

1040
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:24,598
 whose tangled roots turned them
   into natural fortifications  

1041
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,668
     and made it impossible     
           to see into          

1042
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:30,704
   from one field to the next.  

1043
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:31,738
           (explosion)          

1044
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:37,344
    In one area that measured   
     just two miles by four,    

1045
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:40,614
  there were 4,000 such fields. 

1046
01:13:43,017 --> 01:13:47,087
         Here and there,        
   ancient sunken wagon tracks  

1047
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,888
 twisted between the hedgerows, 

1048
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:52,192
       ideal for ambushes       
       and often concealed      

1049
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:56,229
         from air attack        
      by overarching trees.     

1050
01:13:56,231 --> 01:14:01,401
        The Germans took        
  full advantage of all of it.  

1051
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:06,406
American Sherman tanks could not
  break through the hedgerows,  

1052
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:08,209
       and when they tried      
       to roll over them,       

1053
01:14:08,211 --> 01:14:13,814
    exposed their unprotected   
  underbellies to deadly fire.  

1054
01:14:17,318 --> 01:14:18,985
            (gunfire)           

1055
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:24,191
   Each field became what the   
 newspaperman Ernie Pyle called 

1056
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:27,494
    "a separate little war,"    
          fought mostly         

1057
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:30,430
    by companies of riflemen.   

1058
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:34,702
      (bullets whizzing by)     

1059
01:14:34,704 --> 01:14:38,105
              LUCE:             
  The Germans were good troops. 

1060
01:14:38,107 --> 01:14:40,941
          They did not          
      give up ground easily     

1061
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:44,344
    there or any other place    
           I saw them.          

1062
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:46,647
     You had to respect them    
          for the fact          

1063
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,648
   they were excellent troops.  

1064
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,050
           (chuckles):          
 They were too damn good, and...

1065
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,220
 or they wouldn't have caused us
        so much trouble.        

1066
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:54,354
           (explosion)          

1067
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:58,559
            NARRATOR:           
 Progress was measured in yards.

1068
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:04,298
   Now the pace was far slower  

1069
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,401
   than the Allied commanders   
        had anticipated,        

1070
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:13,007
and the cost in dead and wounded
         was far higher.        

1071
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:23,416
         Unarmed C-47s,         
   cargo planes stripped down   

1072
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:26,286
   so that as many litters as   
possible could be lifted aboard,

1073
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:31,157
      carried the worst hit     
    to hospitals in England,    

1074
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,160
      just 20 minutes away,     

1075
01:15:33,162 --> 01:15:37,564
       then turned around       
     and came back for more.    

1076
01:15:40,334 --> 01:15:43,871
         Emily Lewis was        
    one of hundreds of nurses   

1077
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:47,074
     who did all they could     
        for the wounded.        

1078
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:52,613
             LEWIS:             
   All those wounded soldiers,  
   they were scared to death.   

1079
01:15:52,615 --> 01:15:57,517
        Really frightened       
    half out of their minds.    

1080
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:00,354
 I hugged 'em, I was teary-eyed.

1081
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:04,124
 It makes me cry to think of it.

1082
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:07,995
      Got 'em on my plane,      
         talked to them.        

1083
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:10,196
      Some of them were...      

1084
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:12,766
         so unnerved...         

1085
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:19,373
that I-I just had to put my arms
    around 'em and hold 'em.    

1086
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:20,540
            I was 23,           

1087
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,709
      and they were 22, 21,     

1088
01:16:22,711 --> 01:16:25,612
        24, 18, you know.       

1089
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:26,880
            It was...           

1090
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:29,416
    it was just... terrible.    

1091
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:33,353
But it had to be done, you know?

1092
01:16:34,188 --> 01:16:35,422
            NARRATOR:           
           By July 1,           

1093
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:39,459
 hundreds of thousands of troops
          were onshore.         

1094
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:41,028
     The Cotentin Peninsula     

1095
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,897
    and the port of Cherbourg   
         had been taken,        

1096
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:47,868
   and the beachhead stretched  
       for some 70 miles.       

1097
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:49,903
  (explosions, artillery fire)  

1098
01:16:49,905 --> 01:16:52,006
But after three weeks of combat,

1099
01:16:52,008 --> 01:16:56,510
      it remained, at most,     
         20 miles deep.         

1100
01:16:56,512 --> 01:17:00,948
   The plan to liberate France  
          was stalled.          

1101
01:17:05,586 --> 01:17:07,154
     General Bradley feared     

1102
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:09,189
  that unless something drastic 
           were done,           

1103
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:12,726
 the Allies would face the same 
    sort of ghastly stalemate   

1104
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:17,397
        they had endured        
   during the First World War.  

1105
01:17:19,767 --> 01:17:23,970
 To avoid disaster, his men had 
   to get out of the hedgerows  

1106
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:26,506
        and find the kind       
    of wide-open countryside    

1107
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:30,176
      American armor needed     
     to make real progress.     

1108
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:33,947
     The region just beyond     
      the town of Saint-Lô      

1109
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,849
  was what Bradley had in mind. 

1110
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:39,786
  It was just 15 miles away...  

1111
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:43,256
    but to his exhausted men,   

1112
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:48,195
      it seemed as distant      
   as their ultimate target--   

1113
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:50,563
            Germany.
