            NARRATOR:           
       On August 3, 1944,       

4
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,892
   in the skies over the town   
       of Vire, in France,      

5
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,195
  the law of averages caught up 

6
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:09,000
   with fighter pilot Quentin   
 Aanenson of Luverne, Minnesota.

7
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,203
            AANENSON:           
   I was flying the "Tail-End   
       Charlie" position,       

8
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,739
    which means the last one    
     in the line of flight,     

9
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,574
  which is the most vulnerable  
            position,           

10
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,779
     because that's the one     
    they'll start with first.   

11
00:01:21,513 --> 00:01:25,216
   And suddenly the, uh, 88's   

12
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,918
   and 20 millimeters started   
            coming up           

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,222
        in heavy amounts        
       and just... Bruuum!      

14
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,124
        I heard this roar       
      through my airplane,      

15
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,594
          and fire came         
       into the cockpit...      

16
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,430
  just all in... in an instant. 

17
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,633
    My airplane was shaking.    

18
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:45,102
     I thought, "I'm gone."     

19
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,940
     So I tried to bail out.    

20
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,875
         I tried to move        
        the canopy back,        

21
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:57,582
 and a piece of flak had come up
        through the glide       

22
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,386
      and so I couldn't get     
        the canopy open.        

23
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,155
      Couldn't get it open.     

24
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:09,393
The fire was still coming at me,
and so I put the plane in a dive

25
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,396
  because we'd always discussed 

26
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:15,533
   that we didn't want to die   
            by burns.           

27
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,603
            And so...           

28
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,940
   I was only at 4,000 feet so  
  I could hit the ground fast-- 

29
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:25,210
    and that move, literally,   
          saved my life         

30
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:29,247
        because the, uh,        
      air pressure changed      

31
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,848
        and so the flames       
         were sucked out        

32
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,253
   through that opening in the  
 canopy, and that fire died out.

33
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:39,124
     I got back to the base.    

34
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:45,063
    I would stall if my speed   
 dropped below 160 miles an hour

35
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:48,966
           so I landed          
      at 170 miles an hour,     

36
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:54,005
  and I didn't know that one of 
 the 20 millimeters had come up 

37
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,210
   through my left wheel well,  
  and I had a flat tire there.  

38
00:02:58,212 --> 00:03:02,180
    So when the landing gear    
      collapsed on one side     

39
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,616
        I was still going       
    about 100 miles an hour,    

40
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:08,986
      and I was spun around     
          by the force.         

41
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:14,292
My shoulder harness on the right
          broke loose.          

42
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,962
 I was spun around and the back 
  of my head hit the gunsight.  

43
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,798
      So I was unconscious.     

44
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,500
  Then a couple of enlisted men 
        had pulled me out       

45
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,701
 and pulled me away from there.

00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:29,373
            NARRATOR:           
       After medics tended      
   to his dislocated shoulder   

47
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,909
   and the burns on his legs,   

48
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:34,145
     a British photographer     
   from<i> Picture Post</i> magazine   

49
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:38,149
     asked Aanenson to pose

  A week after his close call,  

67
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,975
  Aanenson was back in the air, 

68
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,242
     providing ground cover     

69
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:42,146
   for the Americans advancing  
         toward Germany.

        RADIO ANNOUNCER:        
    It's 7:00 in the morning    

71
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,594
 and steaming along the western 
    coast of Peleliu Island.    

72
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,529
      In just about an hour     
           and a half,          

73
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,798
      the Marines will hit      
       the beaches there.       

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,033
    Before that the warships    
       of this task force,      

75
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:05,102
    which have been pounding    
   the island for three days,   

76
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,404
  will give it a final terrific 
          softening up.         

77
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:11,642
       EMMA BELLE PETCHER:      
      Everybody had a radio     
         during the war.        

78
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,877
             No TVs.            

79
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,380
     And three times a day,     
    you got the national news   

80
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:22,653
 and three times a day, you did 
   not be far from that radio.  

81
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,923
  And, of course, my mother had 
    about a four-by-four map.   

82
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,126
       I really don't know      
        where she got it.       

83
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,028
 It was a map of all of Europe. 

84
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,130
       And she had a big,       
         long rule stick        

85
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,298
  and that map hung right there 

86
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,602
 and it covered that little wall
    where the, um, buffet is.   

87
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:42,907
 she followed all of the battles
 with the rule stick on the map.

88
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,444
       She would have been      
       a great historian.       

89
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,914
      She would have been.

  Before the Japanese attacked  
      on December 7, 1941,      

91
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,260
  most Americans could not have 
  found Pearl Harbor on a map.  

92
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:08,399
   In the two and a half years  
         that followed,         

93
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,136
  they had had to learn a host  
          of new names          

94
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,671
    of the places their sons    
         were fighting--        

95
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:19,043
Kasserine Pass and Monte Cassino
           and Anzio,           

96
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,946
   Utah Beach and Omaha Beach,  

97
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:28,186
       Sainte Mère-Église       
 and St. Lô and the Falaise Gap;

98
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,689
     and, on the other side     
          of the world,         

99
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,260
Guam and Bataan and Guadalcanal,

100
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:41,465
        Midway and Saipan       
     and the Philippine Sea.    

101
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,172
    Before the war could end,   

102
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:50,909
the citizens of Mobile, Alabama,
   and Sacramento, California,  

103
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,112
     Luverne, Minnesota, and    
    Waterbury, Connecticut--    

104
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,314
      and every other town      
          in America--          

105
00:06:56,316 --> 00:07:00,785
    would be forced to learn    
        still more names:       

106
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:05,089
        Arnhem and Aachen       
     and the Hurtgen Forest,    

107
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:10,261
      the Vosges Mountains      
  and the Ardennes and Remagen, 

108
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:17,468
 Peleliu and Luzon and Iwo Jima,
            and more.           

109
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:24,241
 And young men from those towns 
       would learn lessons      

110
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,076
     as old as war itself--     

111
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:32,082
 that generals make plans, plans
   go wrong, and soldiers die.  

112
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:36,954
        For Tom Galloway,       
 a college student from Mobile, 

113
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,658
    a strategic mistake would   
 put him in an unwinnable battle

114
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,430
where the only victory to be had
          was survival.

00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,333
 Robert Kashiwagi of Sacramento,

116
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,871
  who had had everything taken  
    from him by his country,    

117
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:57,108
     would be asked to give     
           even more.           

118
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,144
      And Quentin Aanenson,     
           of Luverne,          

119
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:04,215
  who had lost so many friends  
     and seen so much death,    

120
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,451
 would endure still more horror 

121
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:09,987

      "Time had no meaning;     

130
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,719
      "life had no meaning.     

131
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,389
   "The fierce struggle eroded  
   the veneer of civilization   

132
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:49,627
  and made savages of us all."  

133
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,562
         Eugene Sledge.         

134
00:08:53,632 --> 00:08:55,099
            NARRATOR:           
      The men coined names      

135
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,768
     for the chaos in which     
   they often found themselves  

136
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,737
   and the ineptitude of some   
         of the officers        

137
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:01,939
      who sent them there,      

138
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,141
       employing language       
   they would never have used   

139
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:07,411
    in front of their mothers   
    or their wives back home:   

140
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:12,216
   SNAFU-- "Situation normal,   
         all fucked-up."        

141
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:18,222
  And FUBAR-- "Fucked-up beyond 
        all recognition."       

142
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:36,207
          PAUL FUSSELL:         
        General Patton is       
       a very wise person,      

143
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:38,542
      despite his personal      
         eccentricities.        

144
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:42,647
  He said a number of memorable 
        things about war        

145
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,382
  that only real soldiers know. 

146
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:49,019
  He said, "All plans last only 

147
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,756
         until the time         
       of the first shot."      

148
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:56,394
    Then you just have to go    
   on sheer invention and guts  

149
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:59,663
      and not running away      
    and various other things    

150
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,300
that are never, never mentioned.

151
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,206
        (Benny Goodman's        
      "On the Alamo" plays)     

152
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,339
            NARRATOR:           
      By September of 1944,     

153
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:13,110
 the Allies seemed to be moving 
     steadily toward victory    

154
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,879
           in Europe.           

155
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,247
      On the Eastern Front,     

156
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:19,850
  the Russians had taken parts  
       of Estonia, Latvia,      

157
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,953
      Lithuania, and Poland     

158
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:25,022
   and inflicted 700,000 more   
           casualties           

159
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,791
   on the retreating Germans.   

160
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,660
And in the 11 weeks since D-Day,

161
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:34,899
 American, British, and Canadian
 forces had freed most of France

162
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,068
and Belgium and parts of Holland

163
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,703
        and were arrayed        
     along the 350-mile belt    

164
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:45,009
 of concrete fortifications the 
 Germans called the "West Wall."

165
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,712
     Beyond it lay the heart    
       of Germany itself.       

166
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:54,151
Allied planners had not expected
  their forces to get that far  

167
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,353
    for another eight months.   

168
00:10:56,355 --> 00:11:01,024
 George Patton's Third Army had 
         set the pace--         

169
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:04,795
       covering 400 miles       
      in less than 30 days,     

170
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,632
      though he had outrun      
          his supplies          

171
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:10,234
    and was desperately short   
            of fuel.            

172
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:15,773
    His armored columns alone   
  required some 600,000 gallons 

173
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:20,611
   of gasoline every 50 miles.  

174
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,879
        On September 11,        

175
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:25,816
         an armored unit        
     of the U.S. First Army     

176
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,853
   crossed the German frontier  
        near Stalzenburg.       

177
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:36,059
   General Dwight Eisenhower's  
 chief of staff told the press, 

178
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:38,529
       "this war is over."      

179
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,533
   Post exchanges were ordered  
  to halt all holiday packages  

180
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,769
           for the men          
     on the European front.     

181
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,771
   Nearly everyone was certain  

182
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:49,607
      the war would be over     
          by Christmas.         

183
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:53,778
        There was no room       
      in the supply trucks      

184
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,546
  for winter clothing, either.  

185
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,716
            Besides,            
    the men wouldn't need it.   

186
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:06,256
Meanwhile, the British had taken
   the important Belgian port   

187
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,691
           of Antwerp,          

188
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,694
     but no fuel or supplies    
     could be landed there,     

189
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,631
       because the Germans      
     still held the estuary     

190
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:18,168
    that lay between the city   
       and the North Sea.       

191
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,503
       Eisenhower ordered       

192
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,839
         British General        
       Bernard Montgomery       

193
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,140
       to clear them out.       

194
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,142
  That would have taken weeks,  

195
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,045
     and Montgomery proposed    
      a daring alternative      

196
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:32,583
  designed to speed the Allied  
     advance into Germany--     

197
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,919
    Operation Market Garden.    

198
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:40,458
   First, American and British  
airborne troops would be dropped

199
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,226
       behind German lines      

200
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,563
        to seize bridges        
     along a 65-mile highway    

201
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:49,266
  from Belgium, through Holland 
           to Arnhem.           

202
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:53,770
  Then, the British Second Army 
 would race along that highway, 

203
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,473
   cross the Rhine at Arnhem,   

204
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,442
   go around the northern end   
        of the West Wall,       

205
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,577
 and drive into the Ruhr Valley,

206
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,548
           the center           
   of German industrial might.  

207
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,254
 For the risky plan to succeed, 

208
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,856
 everything had to go perfectly 

209
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,626
          and quickly.          

210
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,663
       Eisenhower thought       
    the gamble was worth it.    

211
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:22,866
       If it did succeed,       
   the war could end in weeks.  

212
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,236
      "I not only approved      
       of Market Garden,"       

213
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,705
         he said later,         
       "I insisted on it."      

214
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:40,284
               ¶ ¶              

215
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:03,107
               ¶ ¶              

216
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:13,984
    On Sunday, September 17,    
      1,481 C-47 transports     

217
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:18,355
   took off in broad daylight   
    from 24 British airfields   

218
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,426
    with 20,000 paratroopers    
            on board.           

219
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:30,100
   Towed behind the transports  
 were hundreds of CG-4A gliders 

220
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,303
   carrying men and matériel.   

221
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:37,107
        Let's talk about        
 the combat glider-- the CG-4A. 

222
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,443
      An 85-foot wingspan.      

223
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,645
      It would carry a ton      
          and a half--          

224
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:45,315
         3,000 pounds--         
  plus the two pilots up front. 

225
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:48,919
      (artillery rumbling)      

226
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,021
           (laughing):          
  But they were flying coffins. 

227
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,358
I mean, there was no return, so,

228
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,361
          the idea was          
     to get your people down    

229
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,163
     or get your load down,     
         whatever it is,        

230
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:03,033
 and then become an infantryman,
    which is what we became.    

231
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:07,537
            NARRATOR:           
   Harry Schmid of Sacramento   
  had been studying accounting  

232
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,706
  when he was drafted in 1942,  

233
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,110
        and first planned       
       to become a medic.       

234
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,611
       But then, he said,       

235
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:18,249
he didn't want to change bedpans
       for the whole war,       

236
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,717
         and volunteered        
       to become a pilot.       

237
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,221
 When his weak eyes kept him out
      of a fighter cockpit,     

238
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:28,926
 he settled for flying a glider 
 with the 82nd Airborne instead,

239
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:35,466
     and found himself part     
   of Operation Market Garden.  

240
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:38,668
  Captain Dwain Luce of Mobile  

241
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,872
 was also on his way to Holland 
        aboard a glider.        

242
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,174
           The father           
     of two small children,     

243
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,309
    he had left his family's    
        cannery business        

244
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:49,880
    to join the 82nd Airborne   
      when the war started,     

245
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,716
     and had survived Sicily    
            and Italy           

246
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:57,187
     and 33 days of fighting    
          in Normandy.          

247
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,023
              LUCE:             
         I got out over         
      the North Sea there,      

248
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:04,461
         and that pilot         
       had a parachute on.      

249
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,097
  "Look, you might as well take 
       that parachute off,      

250
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,500
       because you're not       
    leaving here without me."   

251
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,035
   And, uh, I... uh... I said,  

252
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:16,607
  "Now, you get your ass shot,  
who's going to land this thing?"

253
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:21,378
             SCHMID:            
        Too fast a speed        
   with a CG-4A will kill you,  

254
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,114
     because you're talking     
     about a fabric airplane    

255
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,716
          with nothing          
   but little aluminum struts.  

256
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:29,253
     And these guys come in     
       at 90 miles an hour      

257
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:33,090
  and crash into something and, 
  boy, they just disintegrate.  

258
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,272
   In all my combat missions,   

259
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,208
     I never came in at more    
     than 50 miles an hour.     

260
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,211
I took the chance of getting hit
    by ground fire and flak,    

261
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,948
  but I wanted to get my people 
down and get down on the ground.

262
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,418
(static-filled radio broadcast):
    This is Edward R. Murrow.   

263
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,820
 In just about 30 seconds now...

264
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:08,024
          these 19 men          
 will walk out onto Dutch soil. 

265
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:10,160
         There he goes!         
     Do you hear 'em shout?     

266
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,731
      Three, four, five...      
       six, seven, eight,       

267
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,933
nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

268
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,936
          16, 17, 18...         

269
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,337
        (engine roaring)        

270
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,505
         There they go.         
         Every man out.         

271
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,241
     I can see their chutes     
         going down now.        

272
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,076
       Every man clear...       

273
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,346
 hanging there very gracefully, 

274
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,082
      like nothing so much      
         as khaki dolls         

275
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:35,252
         hanging beneath        
       a green lampshade.       

276
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,290
     The whole sky is filled    
        with parachutes.        

277
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,791
     They're all going down     
           so slowly.           

278
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:45,028
 It seems as though they should 
get to the ground much faster...

279
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,130
        (broadcast fades)       

280
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:52,970
       (swing music plays)      

281
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,510
            NARRATOR:           
   Things went well at first.   

282
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,812
      Dutch citizens poured     
        into the streets        

283
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,148
     to greet the Americans.    

284
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:11,621
    (cheering and whistling)    

285
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:15,091
       The 82nd Airborne,       
     including Harry Schmid     

286
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,060
         and Dwain Luce,        

287
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:19,597
      seized three bridges      
   near Nijmegen, then dug in   

288
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,133
and waited for the British armor
     to race up from Belgium    

289
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,701
        and relieve them.       

290
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,003
     The 101st Airborne took    

291
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,139
  four bridges near Eindhoven,  

292
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,708
      and when the Germans      
        blew up a fifth,        

293
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,977
managed to rebuild it overnight.

294
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:38,782
        They, too, waited       
         to be relieved.        

295
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:42,585
     But when the 10,000 men    
  of the British First Airborne 

296
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:45,956
      came down seven miles     
          from Arnhem,          

297
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,491
the Dutch crowds that turned out

298
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:51,428
          to greet them         
      slowed their advance.     

299
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:56,533
    Only 500 of the soldiers    

300
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,969
        managed to reach        
    the all-important bridge    

301
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,838
        across the Rhine.       

302
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,373
           Meanwhile,           

303
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,845
     word of the Allied plan    
  had fallen into enemy hands,  

304
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,346
   and by the end of the day,   

305
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:13,116
  German panzers had surrounded 
     the outnumbered British    

306
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,385
           at Arnhem.           

307
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,188
       (explosive gunfire,      
        bullet ricochets)       

308
00:19:19,957 --> 00:19:23,027
            (gunfire)           

309
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:31,702
       Bad weather delayed      
     airborne reinforcements    

310
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:32,803
        for several days,       

311
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:35,906
  and when a parachute brigade  
          of free Poles         

312
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:40,910
     was finally dropped in,    
     it was shot to pieces.     

313
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:43,213
            (gunfire)           

314
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:47,284
           (shouting)           

315
00:19:48,652 --> 00:19:51,755
           (gunshots)           

316
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:05,535
        The British armor       

317
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,837
    that was meant to meet up   
      with the paratroopers     

318
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,974
on the ground and then spearhead
    the advance into Germany    

319
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:15,178
 soon found itself under attack 
      from enemy artillery.     

320
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,447
           (explosion)          

321
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:22,019
   Smashed tanks and vehicles   
   caused massive traffic jams  

322
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:26,189
    that took hours to clear.   

323
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,292
             SCHMID:            
 The idea of the whole mission, 
           of course,           

324
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,360
   was to control the bridges   

325
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,697
    while Montgomery came up    
         with his tanks.        

326
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,532
   Well, they shot him all up,  

327
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:39,069
     and he didn't get there    
         for seven days.        

328
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,805
  So we were in the front lines 
         all that time.         

329
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,141
We were not attacking the enemy,

330
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:47,978
      but we were defending     
           perimeters.          

331
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,648
            NARRATOR:           
      This was<i> not</i> the way      
     it was supposed to go.     

332
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:56,987
    Harry Schmid, Dwain Luce    
and the men of the 82nd Airborne

333
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,155
   found themselves struggling  

334
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:02,859
 just to hold on, with no tanks 
      and no heavy weapons.     

335
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,461
              MAN:              
              Fire!             

336
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,864
             SCHMID:            
      And they had two ways     
       of going after you.      

337
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,434
     They'd either do shells    
  that exploded on the ground,  

338
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,303
     or they used airbursts.    

339
00:21:14,672 --> 00:21:16,273
           You worried          
     about those airbursts,     

340
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,142
      because they would...     
        they would burst        

341
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,209
    about 20 feet above you,    

342
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,710
   and there was just shrapnel  
           everywhere.          

343
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,014
     And just a little piece    
   of shrapnel could hit you,   

344
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,250
   you know, and you're gone.   

345
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:32,655
              LUCE:             
    They had better weapons,    
   in many cases, than we did.  

346
00:21:32,657 --> 00:21:34,224
You're talking about their 88's.

347
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:35,859
    They were great weapons.    

348
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:38,662
       Very high velocity.      

349
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:42,032
    that the bullet got there   
 before... before the sound did.

350
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,133
       It was zoop, bang.       

351
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,735
  You know, man, it was just... 

352
00:21:44,737 --> 00:21:46,570
 It was a terrible weapon to... 

353
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:49,740
    We all dreaded the 88's,    
            I guess.            

354
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:56,447
      (rumbling explosions)     

355
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:10,460
             SCHMID:            
  And when you're in a mission  
where you're behind enemy lines,

356
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,763
     you're worried because     
     nobody knows anything.     

357
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,900
     You don't know whether     
     the Germans are coming     

358
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:20,503
  and that's probably the most  
thing that mentally bothers you,

359
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,239
     is that you don't know     
        what's going on.        

360
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:26,809
            NARRATOR:           
      As the Americans held     
   their ground near Nijmegen   

361
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:27,978
         and Eindhoven,         

362
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,849
the surrounded British at Arnhem
     were being slaughtered.    

363
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,851
         (rapid gunfire)        

364
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,654
    (explosions and shouting)   

365
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,055
     (shouting and gunfire)     

366
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,891
  (rapid gunfire and shouting)  

367
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:54,037
       (explosive gunfire)      

368
00:22:55,873 --> 00:22:59,776
            NARRATOR:           
 Finally, after nine long days, 

369
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,278
  Montgomery abandoned his plan 

370
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,449
    and ordered the survivors   
      to withdraw by boat.      

371
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:11,722
     Market Garden had been     

372
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:16,159
       the largest Allied       
airborne operation of the war...

373
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:20,230
    and the most disastrous.    

374
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,066
  17,000 Britons and Canadians, 

375
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,604
       Americans and Poles      
     were killed or wounded     

376
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:32,676
       or captured before       
  the operation was abandoned.  

377
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,883
 More casualties than the Allies
     had suffered on D-Day.     

378
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:46,857
              LUCE:             
      You don't like to see     
       what you see. No...      

379
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,426
         You don't like         
      to see what you see.      

380
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:53,197
     I mean, it's-it's very     
        disquieting to...       

381
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:56,099
     have your friends gone     
        and some of them        

382
00:23:56,101 --> 00:24:00,570
     pretty terribly mauled     
       and things, and...       

383
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,772
     But that's part of it.     

384
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,608
 War is not a pleasant activity.

385
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,145
  And you kind of need to keep  
       your sense of humor      

386
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:12,515
       a little bit to...       
       to get through it.       

387
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,418
            NARRATOR:           
  The Allies had won themselves 

388
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,256
    a narrow 65-mile corridor   
         across Holland,        

389
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:22,292
   but the rest of the British  
      and American troops,      

390
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,861
      including Dwain Luce      
        and Harry Schmid,       

391
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:28,165
   had to stay where they were  
           to hold it,          

392
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:30,901
   battling the deepening cold  

393
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:35,305
    as well as the relentless   
        German shelling.        

394
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:39,977
          They would be         
      left there for weeks.     

395
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:44,647
              LUCE:             
  As a boy, I spent a good deal 
      of time in the woods.     

396
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:49,185
   And I think my experiences   
            with that           

397
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,988
           And I think          
     the little man upstairs    

398
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,057
  had his hand on my shoulder.  

399
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:57,894
       And I got hit once,      
       across the helmet.       

400
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,128
          And it didn't         
      penetrate my helmet,      

401
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,798
    but it'll make you change   
 your underwear if you have any.

402
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,602
    But that's the only time    
           I got hit.           

403
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:10,841
           No, it's...          

404
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,710
        it's kind of like       
      a bad dream, I guess.     

405
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,045
  Wouldn't want to do it again. 

406
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:19,783
      Couldn't do it again,     
         I don't guess.         

407
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:23,286
            NARRATOR:           
        It was clear now        
     that the war in Europe     

408
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:26,956
  would not end before winter.  

409
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:42,972
   In Waterbury, Connecticut,   
    just before Pearl Harbor,   

410
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,375
      Miss Virginia Fleming     
           had married          

411
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,343
   Staff Sergeant John Soden,   

412
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:52,749
   who had worked at the U.S.   
  Rubber Company in Naugatuck.  

413
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:56,252
    They had a daughter, born   
  while Soden was in training,  

414
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:59,989
 and he had been home to see her
    just once before leaving    

415
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:04,727
           for France           
     in the summer of 1944.     

416
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,364
     On September 10, after     
  volunteering to lead a patrol 

417
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:12,135
    across the Moselle River,   
     he was hit in the leg.     

418
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,739
           He had his           
     "million dollar wound,"    

419
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,341
        his ticket home,        
        he told a friend,       

420
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:22,378
 and was carried to a barn where
  he was to receive treatment.  

421
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,914
           (explosion)          

422
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,585
      Then, a German shell      
          hit the barn.         

423
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:36,426
        A few days later,       
 Virginia Soden got a telegram, 

424
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:40,597
    regretting to inform her    
that John was missing in action.

425
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,234
  She wrote to him right away.  

426
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:51,575
     VIRGINIA (dramatized):     
     "To My Dearest Husband     
           and Daddy,           

427
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:55,578
 "I pray to God you will be okay
        and be back soon,       

428
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,449
        "as I don't know        
        what I'd ever do.       

429
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,453
    "But you're coming home,    
            darling.            

430
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,421
      "And we'll enjoy life     

431
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:09,225
    like we're supposed to be   
          entitled to."         

432
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:15,331
         "Well, sweets,         
     your daughter is okay.     

433
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:19,235
  "I still kiss her every night 
         for her daddy.         

434
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,905
    "But the poor little dear   
          doesn't know          

435
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:24,140
      "what it's all about.     

436
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:28,145
   She's so like you, darling,  
       in every respect."       

437
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:33,483
       "The check you sent      
          for $40 came.         

438
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,218
   "Thanks a million, darling.  

439
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,556
   Every little bit will help   
     for our future, right?"    

440
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,193
    "Well, John, I can't seem   
        to write anymore,       

441
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:48,565
     except I still love you    
        more than ever."        

442
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:54,537
        "I pray you'll be       
       safe and home soon.      

443
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,073
      Your wife, Virginia."     

444
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:05,648
            NARRATOR:           
         A month later,         
   a second telegram arrived.   

445
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:10,087
     John Soden would not be    
    coming home to Waterbury.   

446
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:13,690
   The shell that had exploded  
    in the makeshift hospital   

447
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,160
         had killed him.        

448
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:21,531
   Virginia's younger brother   
      would always remember     

449
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,433
       that after she read      
          the telegram,         

450
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:28,271
       his sister let out       
      "an unearthly howl."      

451
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,822
  (indistinct, distant shouts)  

452
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:49,993
        SIDNEY PHILLIPS:        
     War is mostly boredom,     
          telling lies,         

453
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:53,964
 stealing from some other outfit
         if they've got         

454
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,866
     something better to eat    
          than you have         

455
00:28:55,868 --> 00:29:01,904
   and just making the best of  
  a thousand of bad situations. 

456
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,273
     Uh, it's going to rain.    

457
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,574
    You're going to get wet.    

458
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,643
   It's going to get too hot.   

459
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:07,944
   It's going to get too cold.  

460
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,947
      I mean, you're always     
  uncomfortable in the service, 

461
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,415
      it seemed like to me.     

462
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,852
            NARRATOR:           
     By the spring of 1944,     

463
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:19,455
 Sid Phillips of Mobile had been
    stationed in the Pacific    

464
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,924
    for more than two years.    

465
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:23,826
  He had survived the fighting  
         on Guadalcanal         

466
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:27,830
and at Cape Gloucester and hoped
    to be sent to Australia,    

467
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:31,267
     with its plentiful beer    
       and friendly girls,      

468
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,905
     until he got his orders    
           to go home.          

469
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:37,941
       Instead, his First       
         Marine Division        

470
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:41,878
       was sent to Pavuvu,      
    a remote island so small    

471
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,013
   that when the men drilled,   

472
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:46,115
     one outfit had to march    
            clockwise           

473
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,317
  and the next counterclockwise 

474
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,621
      to keep from blocking     
         the only road.         

475
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,324
       Sitting on his cot       
       one hot afternoon,       

476
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,695
  Phillips was surprised to see 
       a familiar figure:       

477
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:02,398
  his best friend from Mobile,  
         Eugene Sledge.         

478
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,900
         (Glenn Miller's        
    "Little Brown Jug" plays)   

479
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:08,337
            PHILLIPS:           
    I saw him coming down the   
company street, looking intense.

480
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:11,074
  I recognized him and ran out, 

481
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:13,175
       screamed his name.       

482
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:18,181
     And we ran and beat on     
     each other and embraced    

483
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,451
 People thought we were fighting
    and a big crowd gathered.   

484
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:24,321
            But then,           
    I introduced him around,    

485
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,756
  and it was just a great day.  

486
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:30,626
            NARRATOR:           
  20-year-old Eugene B. Sledge  

487
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:32,996
       was the grandson of      
      Confederate officers.     

488
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:37,033
  Bookish and frail as a child, 
       he had been taught       

489
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:40,036
        to fish and hunt        
     by his physician father    

490
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,506
      and was a freshman at     
 the Marion Military Institute, 

491
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,477
 studying to become an officer, 
   when he decided to sign on   

492
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,246
          as a private          
     in the Marines instead.    

493
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:54,684
   He told his anxious parents  

494
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,187
        that if he waited       
         for graduation,        

495
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,724
        he might not get        
       a chance at combat.      

496
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:04,660
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
     Eugene Sledge was just     

497
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,831
     an ordinary young man.     

498
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:11,801
     He was full of pranks,     
       and full of tricks,      

499
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:15,805
  and he and my brother Sidney  
     pulled every one of 'em    

500
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,373
    that they possibly could.   

501
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,677
But they were such great friends

502
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,212
       that what one did,       

503
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,915
  the other one followed suit.  

504
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,950
    He was a very gentle man,   

505
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,187
    as my brother Sidney was,   
          to be thrown          

506
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,990
   into the middle of a fight   
           like that.           

507
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:38,962
            NARRATOR:           
         Not long after         
   Sledge got to the Pacific,   

508
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:42,065
        he began keeping        
    an unauthorized journal,    

509
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,001
  slipping tiny sheets of notes 
        between the pages       

510
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:47,003
   of the small New Testament   
           he carried,          

511
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:51,241
 so that no one else would know 
       what he was doing.       

512
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:55,978
       Years later, those       
   uncensored notes would form  

513
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,913
 the basis of a harrowing memoir

514
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:01,751
       of his experiences       
         in the Pacific.

      "The awesome reality

      nagged at each of us

             SIDNEY:            
He had come in as a replacement,

528
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:48,231
  and I was being rotated home  

529
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:51,468
   because I had been overseas  
         over two years.        

530
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,871
      I certainly did think     
    about what he was facing    

531
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:58,174
     because it was all bad.    

532
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,442
     Every campaign was bad.    

533
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:03,346
   Some were a little quicker   
 and a little worse than others.

534
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:07,516
  Some were, uh... uh... under  
  worse conditions than others, 

535
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:12,355
     but they were all bad,     
   and I knew he was... uh...   

536
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,391
      he was going to face      
        some hard times.        

537
00:33:17,627 --> 00:33:19,763
            NARRATOR:           
     In late August of 1944,    

538
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:24,900
   Sledge and 16,458 other men  
  of the First Marine Division  

539
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:28,337
           left Pavuvu          
     for the Palau Islands,     

540
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,574
   more than 2,000 miles away.  

541
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:35,778
   The Marines were headed for  
   the tiny island of Peleliu,  

542
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,082
     where the Japanese had     
    constructed an airfield.    

543
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:43,686
   It was only 550 miles east   
          of Mindanao,          

544
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,822
 which was to be the first stop 

545
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,857
 in General Douglas MacArthur's 
            campaign            

546
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,660
  to recapture the Philippines. 

547
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:54,497
    MacArthur wanted Peleliu    
        put out of action       

548
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:57,633
      to protect his flank.     

549
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:01,837
      But as Eugene Sledge      
     and his fellow Marines     

550
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,776
  playing poker and sunbathing  
  on the deck to fill the time, 

551
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,445
      Allied plans changed.     

552
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:13,616
       After the decisive       
        American victory        

553
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:17,119
 in the Battle of the Philippine
     Sea the previous June,     

554
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,721
     Admiral William Halsey     

555
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,657
      no longer considered      
     the Japanese air force     

556
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,425
        a serious threat.       

557
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:29,532
      The Peleliu airfield      
 had become largely irrelevant. 

558
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:35,438
But no one canceled the invasion
         of the island.         

559
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,476
  Halsey was sure it would take 
  only four days to secure it.  

560
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:46,082
         For three days,        
   the Navy bombarded Peleliu.  

561
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:50,152
          (explosions)          

562
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:55,591
   The foliage that blanketed   
     its jagged coral hills     

563
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,460
        was burned away.        

564
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:01,164
  The coral itself was bleached 
      white by phosphorous.     

565
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:06,970
 Finally, the officer in charge 
       told his superiors,      

566
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,938
  "We have run out of targets." 

567
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,109
           It was time          
     to send in the Marines.

"that night before the invasion.

570
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:21,917
       "I thought of home,      
    my parents, my friends--    

571
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:25,254
"and whether I would do my duty,

572
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,324
    "be wounded or disabled,    
          or be killed.         

573

 impossible for me to be killed,

     "because God loved me.     

575

      that God loved us all

         a damned coward

00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,622
   "and eventually fell asleep  
    saying the Lord's Prayer

585

     Sledge and his comrades

      more than 5,000 men--     

596
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:57,013
    went ashore side-by-side    
     and quickly discovered     

597
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,248
      that the bombardment      
     had done little damage

to the carefully-prepared warren

  ridges running up the center

     And then the first day     

613
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:54,604
        we went in there,       
    those people, they just,    

614
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,373
   they slaughtered us Marines  
    like we were just a bunch

00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,274
         of hogs coming         
      in the slaughter pen.     

616
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:02,077
     The Japanese were some     
        tough customers.        

617
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,479
          They really,          
    they really could fight.    

618
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,815
        They come at you        
    with everything they had.   

619
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:09,051
 So we Marines, we were just as 
tough or tougher than they were.

620
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:13,489
        So we, we always        
     almost came out on top.

            NARRATOR:           
  The Americans lost 1,200 men, 

622
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,762
   but they clung to the beach  

623
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:24,266
     and some began fighting    
        their way inland.       

624
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:31,607
 Eugene Sledge was a mortarman. 

625
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:34,410
   He fired round after round   
         into the enemy,        

626
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:38,181

 (explosions and artillery fire)

628
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,092
   He and his regiment managed  

629
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:52,128
     to make it all the way     
    across the narrow island,   

630
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:55,297
   then dug in for the night.   

631
00:38:55,299 --> 00:39:00,736
   No one slept, for fear that  
Japanese infiltrators would slip

632
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:03,739
        into their lines

            NARRATOR:           
        The next morning,       

648
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,494
    the Marines were ordered    
  to assault Japanese positions 

649
00:39:59,496 --> 00:40:02,598
          in the cliffs         
  that overlooked the airfield. 

650
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,367
       Tanks and artillery      
         would go first.        

651
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,637
       Then, the infantry       
    and Sledge would follow,    

652
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,973
   charging across the exposed  
         gravel airstrip        

653
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:14,310
   to attack the high ground.   

654
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:20,182
     The temperature neared     
          100 degrees.          

655
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,818
       There was no shade.      

656
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:25,287
    The only water available,   

657
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:28,390
    hauled up from the beach    
      in five-gallon cans,      

658
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:32,561
     turned out to be fouled    
         by diesel oil.         

659
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:35,864
     Scores of men collapsed    
      from heat exhaustion      

660
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:39,301
  before the signal was given.  

661
00:40:40,103 --> 00:40:41,604
        As the Marines--        

662
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:45,241
 four battalions and 1,800 men--
         moved forward,         

663
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:48,511
       the enemy opened up      
    with everything they had.   

664
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:53,349
(explosions in quick succession)

   "is absolutely terrifying,   

674
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:38,093
  but to be shelled in the open 
     is terror compounded."

          (explosions)          

676
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:45,535
            NARRATOR:           
     Sledge somehow made it     
   across the airstrip safely   

677
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:48,638
 and took what shelter he could 
         beneath a bush.        

678
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,306
  He was "shaking like a leaf," 
            he wrote,           

679
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:53,775
 but took comfort from the fact 

680
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:57,746
 that a veteran of the fighting 
 on Guadalcanal crouching nearby

681
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:59,548
        was shaking, too.       

682
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:03,452
 (explosions and artillery fire)

683
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:13,362
  Japanese tactics had changed  
 since the beginning of the war.

684
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,731
    Suicidal banzai charges,    

685
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,133
    like those on Guadalcanal   
           and Tarawa           

686
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:21,837
and Saipan, were largely a thing
          of the past.          

687
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,541
            Instead,            
   Peleliu's 10,500 defenders   

688
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:29,378
    would contest every inch    
          of the island         

689
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,415
from their hillside strongholds.

690
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:37,986
  They would have to be blasted 
     or burned out of them,     

691
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:40,689
         one at a time.         

692
00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:43,092

          had settled,

         came as a jolt.        

705

    It suddenly made the war    
    a very personal affair."    

706
00:43:32,842 --> 00:43:38,314
            NARRATOR:           
       Willie Rushton was       
    in the thick of it, too.    

707
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:43,352
 his outfit was assigned to just
 unload supplies and ammunition.

708
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,487
 But when the fighting started, 

709
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:48,357
   he and some of his friends   
           volunteered          

710
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,159
       for frontline duty.      

711
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,760
            RUSHTON:            
     But we were right there    

712
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:54,029
where the fighting was going on,
            you know.           

713
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:58,333
  They was just, just knocking  
   us off as we came forward.   

714
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,169
  That's what they were doing,  
        knockin' us off.        

715
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:02,371
     They didn't make no...     
 whether you was black or white 

716
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:05,941
  or whatever, they didn't care 
    when you got into combat.   

717
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:17,019
            NARRATOR:           
     15 members of Rushton's    
     depot company were hit.    

718
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:22,224
       He was one of them,      
 wounded in the leg by shrapnel.

719
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:25,461
  He was carried to a hospital  
         ship offshore,         

720
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:29,431
   the only wounded black man   
             aboard.            

721
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:31,633
 After his wounds were treated, 

722
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,737
    he asked if he could have   
           a haircut.           

723
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,406
   The ship's barber refused.   

724
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:40,276
 When I got up there he told me,
          he said, uh,          

725
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:42,878
    "I can't cut your hair."    

726
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,914
    And so then, so a couple,   

727
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:46,782
    a couple of white Marines   
        asked him, said,        

728
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:47,917
  "Why can't you cut his hair?" 

729
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:50,219
  Said, "You don't have to give 
          him no style,         

730
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:51,287
     "just cut his hair off.    

731
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:53,488
      All he wants is some      
   of that hair off his ears."  

732
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,625
So he said, "No... I'm, I can't,
     I can't cut his hair."     

733
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,361
            NARRATOR:           
  Then, the captain intervened.

00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:03,765
            RUSHTON:            
  The captain of the Red Cross  
      ship came down there      

735
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:06,802
 "I'm telling you for the first 
    and the last time," said,

00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,771
     "I don't care who comes

739
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,777
  "I want you to cut his hair,  
  you know, just cut his hair." 

740
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:18,547
    He said, "Don't ever make   
  a remark like that anymore."  

741
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,451
            NARRATOR:           
Private Rushton got his haircut.

744
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:40,469

   still fighting on Peleliu,   

745
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:45,207
     one day, one firefight,    
     one terror-filled night    

746
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,844
 now seemed just like the next.

 "The opposing forces on Peleliu

796
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:23,625
   were like two scorpions in   
 a bottle," Eugene Sledge wrote.

797

      "One was annihilated,     
      the other nearly so."

       Sledge and the rest      
  of the First Marine Division  

801
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:57,492
       were finally taken       
         off the island.        

802
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,227
    It would be another month   

803
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:02,865
  before the Japanese commander 
  finally radioed his superiors 

804
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:08,770
  that "all is over on Peleliu" 
   and then committed suicide.  

805
00:50:11,307 --> 00:50:14,576
      A handful of Japanese     
   would go on fighting there   

806
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:18,413
     until February of 1945.    

807
00:50:24,487 --> 00:50:29,691
  Securing Peleliu was supposed 
       to take four days.       

808
00:50:30,593 --> 00:50:34,196
  It took more than two months. 

809
00:50:42,871 --> 00:50:46,141
  10,000 Japanese were killed,  

810
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:50,846
    nearly every man who had    
      defended the island.      

811
00:50:58,187 --> 00:51:02,324
    More than 1,200 Americans   
            perished,           

812
00:51:02,326 --> 00:51:05,594
 including Private John D. New, 

813
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:10,398
 who had grown up in Mobile just
 across town from Eugene Sledge.

814
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,568
        He hurled himself       
    onto a Japanese grenade,    

815
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:18,440
saving the lives of two friends,
       but losing his own.      

816
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:24,112
  For his heroism, he received  
  a posthumous Medal of Honor.  

817
00:51:28,484 --> 00:51:34,356
5,274 more Americans were maimed
           or missing.          

818
00:51:37,293 --> 00:51:41,329
       Out of the 235 men       
   in Eugene Sledge's company,  

819
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:46,934
     only 85 left the island    
    without physical wounds.    

820
00:51:48,003 --> 00:51:52,774
         And in the end,        
 there had been no tactical need

821
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:56,945
        for which so many       
  of Sledge's friends had died.

    "What a luxury to inhale    

829
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:28,243
  long, deep breaths of fresh,  
           clean air."          

830
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:32,648
    "But something in me died   
           at Peleliu.

         "Perhaps it was        
      a childish innocence      

832
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:41,023
that accepted as faith the claim
  that man is basically good."  

833

  the next war film to come out 

839
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,362
      because it was filled     
          with heroism          

840
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,966

841
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:29,771
     and everybody who died     
        died for a cause.       

842
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:34,008
  The biggest audience response 
     came like from a movie

<i>Flying Tigers</i> with John Wayne.  

844
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,113
      And when he shot down     
         Japanese planes        

845
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:43,051
     and the Japanese pilot     
would hold his hands to his face

846
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,587
    and the blood would come    
       out of his fingers,      

847
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,255
   we would jump up and cheer   

848
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:50,625
      because the good guys     
          were winning.

             (speaking Japanese)

851
00:54:20,889 --> 00:54:24,525
         The big change         
 that the war brought for me was

852
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:27,595
       I was a businessman      
       at the age of ten.       

853
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:32,133
      I was a<i> Bee</i> carrier,      
     managing my own money,     

854
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:34,336
     managing my own route.     

855
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:38,506
        And what did I do       
     with my first paycheck?    

856
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:40,575
        I went and bought       
       a cardboard replica      

857
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:41,876
  of a .30 caliber machine gun  

858
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,813
   and went home and put it up  
    in a tree in the backyard   

859
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:49,384
  and made believe I was mowing 
    down the enemy like that.   

860
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:54,156
    That was my contribution    
       to the war effort.       

861
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:57,325
      And we all played war     
      to a certain extent,      

862
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,961
      but it's interesting      
      the way we played war     

863
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,330
    because nobody ever died.   

864
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:07,635
 If you got shot, somebody came 
  to your aid and fixed you up, 

865
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,471
   and then you could rise up   
        and shoot again.

 The war transformed Sacramento,

868
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:27,522
    just as it had Waterbury    
           and Mobile           

869
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:31,660
   and scores of other cities   
 and towns all over the country.

870
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:37,264
   Women now drove city buses   
 and directed downtown traffic. 

871
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:43,938
 Some 12,000 local boys had gone
           away to war          

872
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,343
      including Earl Burke,     
still recovering from the wounds

873
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,779
     he suffered as a member    
    of the Eighth Air Force,    

874
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:56,951
and Harry Schmid, still fighting
     the Germans in Holland.    

875
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:01,589
           The city's           
7,000 Japanese-American citizens

876
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,224
       were missing, too,       

877
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:07,228
    sent to internment camps    
   scattered across the West.   

878
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:12,967
 Others now occupied their homes
   and farms and businesses...  

879
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,202
  ...some carefully protecting  
          the interests         

880
00:56:15,204 --> 00:56:16,771
    of their absent friends,    

881
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:21,375
 many eager to profit from their
  former neighbors' misfortune, 

882
00:56:21,377 --> 00:56:27,582
while new immigrants from Mexico
     harvested their crops.     

883
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:32,820
 28,000 defense workers streamed
    into Sacramento, as well.   

884
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:35,991
      Room had to be found      
         for all of them        

885
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:37,759
        and for thousands       
      of service personnel      

886
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,728
          at the city's         
     three Air Force bases:     

887
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,399
  Beale, Mather, and McClellan. 

888
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:47,568
  The federal government built  
   three housing developments,  

889
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:51,906
    but hundreds had to bunk    
        in the city jail,       

890
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:55,610
          the basement          
   of the Memorial Auditorium,  

891
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:58,012
  and in the Japanese Buddhist  
        Association Hall        

892
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:04,252
    that stood empty now that   
its members had been taken away.

893
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:08,923
        WILLIAM PERKINS:        
The first Sunday I came to town,

894
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,861
  I walked down Capitol Avenue. 

895
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:15,129
       And on the way down      
       toward the Capitol,      

896
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:18,399
      I looked up and I saw     
   some oranges up in a tree--  

897
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:22,670
 way up there-- and I must have 
   sat there for a long time.   

898
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,271
   Because this was in April,   

899
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:27,442
         and I sat there        
 for quite a while just admiring

900
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:30,811
   and couldn't believe I was   
   looking at oranges in April  

901
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:35,050
       and back in my home      
  it probably was snow drifts.  

902
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:39,254
            NARRATOR:           
Army Private William H. Perkins,
   from Newport, Rhode Island,  

903
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:44,092
 arrived at McClellan Air Force 
   Base in the spring of 1944   

904
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,626
      to take up his duties     
           as a member          

905
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:49,563
        of the all-black        
    4909 Aviation Base Unit--   

906
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:53,134
         truck drivers,         
       mess hall workers,       

907
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,004
        guards, and MPs.        

908
00:58:02,244 --> 00:58:04,746
        They were housed        
  in substandard wooden shacks  

909
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:07,248
  they called "Splinter City."  

910
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,218
  One of Perkins' best friends  
        in his outfit was       

911
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:14,389
    Corporal Walter Thompson,   
 a college man from Pennsylvania

912
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:16,524
          who had hoped         
    to become a fighter pilot   

913
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:19,494
        but couldn't get        
into the Tuskegee Flight School,

914
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,330
        the only one open       
      to African-Americans.     

915
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,199
        WALTER THOMPSON:        
     There was about 1,200,     
           1,500 men,           

916
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:28,402
       every walk of life       
 and from all over the country. 

917
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:30,638
               Highly-educated  
               individuals there

918
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,209
                  down to almost
                  illiterates.  

919
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:35,777
               They were all    
               assigned to that,

920
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:39,547
         regardless of your     
         intellectual abilities.

921
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:43,752
     If you were colored, that's
     where you were assigned--  

922
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:46,988
            NARRATOR:           
 There were separate facilities 
           on the base          

923
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:48,890
 for black and white personnel--

924
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:53,727
   separate theaters, chapels,  
      even bowling alleys.      

925
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:58,433
       ("The Basie Boogie"      
     by Count Basie playing)    

926
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:11,512
 The unit had its own big band, 
    the 4909 Barons of Swing.   

927
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:17,385
   Walter Thompson and William  
   Perkins were both members.   

928
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:37,972
         JEROLINE GREEN:        
       I had heard so much      
 about California at that time. 

929
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:40,608
  And it sounded so glamorous,  
             and...             

930
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,677
           and coming           
    from a little hick town,    

931
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,847
           I thought,           
"Well, I'd better go," so I did.

932
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:50,084
            NARRATOR:           
     Jeroline Green had come    
          to Sacramento         

933
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,820
    from Coffeyville, Kansas,   

934
00:59:51,822 --> 00:59:54,589
     just one of some eight     
        million Americans       

935
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,123
         who migrated to        
        the Pacific Coast       

936
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:59,961
         during the war,        
   in search of defense jobs.   

937
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:03,865
             GREEN:             
       And I realized that      
      if I stayed at home,      

938
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:06,568
     of course I'd probably     
      finish my schooling,      

939
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,202
 but I'd probably end up working

940
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,972
      in some white woman's     
      kitchen or something.     

941
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,808
  I had no growth or potential. 

942
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:17,478
        Then I was hired        
     as an inventory clerk,     

943
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,247
         counting nuts,         
       bolts, and screws.       

944
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,952
            NARRATOR:           
       Jerri Green worked       
  at McClellan Air Force Base,  

945
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:27,922
 side by side with her new best 
   friend, Barbara Covington.   

946
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:32,827
Covington was having a hard time
    coming up with the money    

947
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,462
      for tuition and books     
          for college,          

948
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,697
      when she heard about      
        the opportunities       

949
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:39,134
   being offered at McClellan.  

950
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:41,503
           COVINGTON:           
 And we got jobs within a week. 

951
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:45,206
 That's the way it was in those 
days; you could walk into a job.

952
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:49,443
     We got jobs as typists     
       in a unit and, um,       

953
01:00:49,445 --> 01:00:51,846
  at McClellan Air Force Base.  

954
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:58,019
    And I think my pay jumped   
  from the $24 a month to $65.  

955
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:02,123
 And I was making, considering, 
       fairly good money.       

956
01:01:05,961 --> 01:01:11,499
     They wanted the blacks     
     to all be in one place.    

957
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:19,440
     You know, I marvel now     
     at how well we took it.    

958
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:20,441
            You know?           

959
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,510
     We made the best of it.    

960
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:25,112
         We really did.         

961
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:28,115
 And we tried to get as much out
       of it as we could.       

962
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:31,452
      And we tried to have      
    as much fun as we could.    

963
01:01:36,692 --> 01:01:38,660
            NARRATOR:           
        Barbara Covington       
         and Jerri Green        

964
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:42,463
       sometimes performed      
       with the 4909 Band,      

965
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:48,469
         dancing as the         
       "Flora Dora Coras."      

966
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:55,276
     There they made friends    
      with Walter Thompson      

967
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:57,344
      and William Perkins.      

968
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:07,789
           COVINGTON:           
     And it was great times     

969
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:12,660
to be able to go out to the base
    and listen to the fellows   

970
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:17,898
   that you knew play so many   
    of these beautiful songs.   

971
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,936
        What was sort of        
     funny about it, though,    

972
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:25,306
       so many of the guys      
      that were in the band     

973
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:27,108
had girlfriends in the audience,

974
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:29,944
        and some of them        
      couldn't hardly play      

975
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,312
 for watching their girlfriends 

976
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:35,549
       as they danced with      
     some other serviceman.     

977
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:38,085
            NARRATOR:           
        Barbara Covington       
       and William Perkins      

978
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,988
           would marry          
  years after the war was over. 

979
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:46,093
 Walter Thompson and Jerri Green
     didn't wait that long.     

980
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,296
        They were married       
       at the end of 1944       

981
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:53,534
   at McClellan Air Force Base  
   in Sacramento, California.

         and her family

01:03:57,266 --> 01:04:01,202
  were still imprisoned, along  
   with 4,000 other civilians

   rounded up by the Japanese,

           in Manila,           
     on the island of Luzon.    

1002
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:16,584
 As the war went on, conditions 
   had steadily deteriorated.   

1003
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:21,022
          WEINZHEIMER:          
   Once the food started going  
   down, everything went down.  

1004
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:25,426
       And toward the end,      
    my mother was 73 pounds.    

1005
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:30,998
 And, um, she nursed my brother 
    until he was, uh, three.    

1006
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:37,371
 So, if you see a picture of him
 during that time, he is chubby.

1007
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,040
       And that's because       
        of Mother's milk.       

1008
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,643
     But that depleted her.

          WEINZHEIMER:          
 That was absolutely fantastic. 

1023
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:35,129
 First of all, the engines were 
     not Mitsubishi engines,    

1024
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:42,703
  they were American, different 
    sounding, strong engines.   

1025
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:47,575
            NARRATOR:           
    Waves of American planes    
 launched from aircraft carriers

1026
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:49,477
     roared in over Manila,     

1027
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:53,047
      bombing and strafing      
       Japanese positions,      

1028
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:56,617
   attacking Japanese warships  
      anchored in the bay.      

1029
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,787
    WEINZHEIMER (dramatized):   
    "Everyone was so excited.   

1030
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:03,191
       "Of course, it was       
      very dangerous for us     

1031
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:07,161
   "falling all over the camp,  
     from the ack-ack guns;     

1032
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:10,331
      "but everyone seemed      
      to feel that our boys     

1033
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:13,600
and our bombs couldn't hurt us."

1034
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:17,572
          WEINZHEIMER:          
 And then, finally, the Japanese
       saw us going crazy,      

1035
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:19,873
   looking up and everything,   
    and they set down rulings   

1036
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,510
      that we were to come      
     into the main building,    

1037
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:27,014
 and we were, if we were caught 
  looking up at our own planes, 

1038
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,350
 we would pay the consequences. 

1039
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:35,055
So, a lot of the, um, prisoners,
        a lot of the men,       

1040
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:39,593
 would be sent down to the main 
  gate and tied up at the stake 

1041
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:45,165
 and made to look up at the sun 
  for, you know, the whole day. 

1042
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:50,838
 ("Pennies from Heaven" playing)

1043
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:03,417
            NARRATOR:           
   The Japanese were still in   
   control of the Philippines,  

1044
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:06,753
    but the American assault    
           had begun,           

1045
01:07:06,755 --> 01:07:08,622
      and the next morning,     

1046
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:12,093
  the prisoner who played music 
   over the camp's loudspeaker  

1047
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:14,094
  put on "Pennies from Heaven." 

1048
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:20,334
         BILLIE HOLIDAY:        
    ¶ ...the things you love,   
     you must have showers ¶    

1049
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:25,206

1050
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:28,375
   ¶ Don't run under a tree ¶

       ¶ For you and me. ¶      

1053
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:39,019
    (instrumental interlude)    

1054
01:08:11,586 --> 01:08:14,554
           (song ends,          
      airplane soars past)      

1055
01:08:15,823 --> 01:08:17,858
            NARRATOR:           
 One month later, on October 20,

1056
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,961
   General Douglas MacArthur's  
          forces landed         

1057
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:22,629
    on the island of Leyte...   

1058
01:08:25,466 --> 01:08:26,934
      ...the first foothold     

1059
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,536
         in the struggle        
  to win back the Philippines.  

1060
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:33,340
      (explosions, gunfire)     

1061
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:44,218
  MacArthur's own landing craft 
   got stuck 75 yards offshore  

1062
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:49,023
      and he had no choice      
    but to wade to the beach.   

1063
01:08:51,059 --> 01:08:55,462
      His publicity machine     
      made the most of it.      

1064
01:08:57,432 --> 01:09:00,667
         LOWELL THOMAS:         
   When General MacArthur left  
      his command of Bataan     

1065
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:04,305
     by presidential order,     
   he gave the solemn promise,  

1066
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:05,672
        "I will return."        

1067
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:08,809
   Now he tells the Philippine  
   people, "I have returned."   

1068
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:15,048
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
 So when he came wading through 
   the water up on the beach,   

1069
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,684
     there were great cheers    
      in the movie theater.     

1070
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:23,424
   Because that's, of course,   
 how we saw MacArthur returning.

1071
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:24,892
  I realize now it was staged,  

1072
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:31,498
  a lot of it, but, man, it was 
  good to see him walking back. 

1073
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:36,237
            NARRATOR:           
   MacArthur's return thrilled  
 Americans and Filipinos alike. 

1074
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,773
        As his men began        
       to fight their way       

1075
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:40,574
       across the islands       
       of the Philippines,      

1076
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:43,844
what remained of the once-mighty
         Japanese fleet         

1077
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:48,282
      would be shattered in     
  the largest naval engagement  

1078
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:52,953
           in history,          
    the Battle of Leyte Gulf.   

1079
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:03,531
  But 24 volunteer enemy pilots 

1080
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:07,034
     offered fresh evidence     
       of Japan's resolve       

1081
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:10,604
        to keep fighting,       
       no matter the odds.      

1082
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:12,239
    They deliberately crashed   
          their planes          

1083
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,908
         into the decks         
      of American carriers      

1084
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,644
in hopes of setting them ablaze.

1085
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:25,519
  They were called kamikazes--  
   Japanese for "divine wind."  

1086
01:10:37,465 --> 01:10:38,699
   Despite the victory at sea,  

1087
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:43,504
    months of bloody fighting   
            lay ahead           

1088
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:44,972
 before the Philippine Islands, 

1089
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,207
         and the people         
       imprisoned on them,      

1090
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:50,010
       could be liberated.      

1091
01:11:08,896 --> 01:11:13,332
          PAUL FUSSELL:         
      Everybody was scared      
     to death all the time.     

1092
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:15,835
   And yet, you never said so,  

1093
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:18,371
   you never gave any signals   
         that you were.         

1094
01:11:18,373 --> 01:11:22,808
   You just were and you knew   
   the other people were, too.  

1095
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:27,113
   You don't run away because   
every alternative is impossible.

1096
01:11:27,115 --> 01:11:28,381
    There's no way out of it.   

1097
01:11:28,383 --> 01:11:30,650
  There's no way to change it,  
        and you are there       

1098
01:11:30,652 --> 01:11:32,718
until you get killed or wounded.

1099
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:36,222
    Or until you... you flee    
         and, you know,         

1100
01:11:36,224 --> 01:11:41,260
   allow everybody to exercise  
  their instinct for contempt,  

1101
01:11:41,262 --> 01:11:43,896
      which is unthinkable      
         to most people.        

1102
01:11:43,898 --> 01:11:48,167
 So there's no way out and that 
    puts you in the situation   

1103
01:11:48,169 --> 01:11:52,638
      that you're never in,     
   I think, in civilian life.   

1104
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,041
            NARRATOR:           
         Back in Europe,        

1105
01:11:55,043 --> 01:11:58,277
      the Allies were still     
      stalled in the north,     

1106
01:11:58,279 --> 01:11:59,646
 suffering from supply problems,

1107
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:02,982
          the disaster          
   of Operation Market Garden,  

1108
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:06,385
         and intensified        
       German resistance.       

1109
01:12:11,225 --> 01:12:13,526
     The American 7th Army's    
         drive northward        

1110
01:12:13,528 --> 01:12:17,630
    from the south of France    
  had run into trouble as well. 

1111
01:12:17,632 --> 01:12:20,733
         They had landed        
   at Marseille in mid-August,  

1112
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:23,203
          and at first,         
     things had gone better     

1113
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:25,871
  than anyone had anticipated.  

1114
01:12:25,873 --> 01:12:30,243
 Within a month, they had pushed
        almost 400 miles,       

1115
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:32,712
  taken 89,000 German prisoners 

1116
01:12:32,714 --> 01:12:36,182
   and linked up with elements  
      of Patton's 3rd Army      

1117
01:12:36,184 --> 01:12:38,317
       to finally complete      
       the continuous line      

1118
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:43,222
     Eisenhower now believed    
 essential to the Allied cause. 

1119
01:12:45,259 --> 01:12:47,760
    But thousands of Germans    
          had retreated         

1120
01:12:47,762 --> 01:12:49,162
   into the Vosges Mountains--  

1121
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:52,598
     steep, thickly forested    
        with evergreens,        

1122
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:58,137
  shrouded in fog and drenched  
     with cold autumn rains.    

1123
01:12:58,139 --> 01:12:59,072
       There, they dug in,      

1124
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:04,677
         ordered to halt        
the Allied advance into Germany.

1125
01:13:08,649 --> 01:13:11,450
         American units         
     that had already fought    

1126
01:13:11,452 --> 01:13:14,053
    in the mountains of Italy   
       were sent to France      

1127
01:13:14,055 --> 01:13:17,857
 and ordered to battle their way
       through the Vosges.      

1128
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:21,594
        One was the 36th        
        "Texas" Division,       

1129
01:13:21,596 --> 01:13:23,997
    the same outfit that had    
      nearly been destroyed     

1130
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:27,667
        at Monte Cassino        
      the previous winter.      

1131
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:30,770
    Another, attached to it,    

1132
01:13:30,772 --> 01:13:33,072
      especially requested      
        by headquarters,        

1133
01:13:33,074 --> 01:13:36,242
       was the 100th/442nd      
          Combat Team--         

1134
01:13:36,244 --> 01:13:38,344
    Japanese-American troops,   

1135
01:13:38,346 --> 01:13:41,748
     most of them recruited     
      from internment camps     

1136
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,217
      in the United States.     

1137
01:13:45,219 --> 01:13:49,088
  They had once been considered 
     a problem by the Army.     

1138
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:51,924
 Now, they were problem-solvers,

1139
01:13:51,926 --> 01:13:54,693
  called in when others failed. 

1140
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:58,197
        ROBERT KASHIWAGI:       
      It was bitterly cold.     

1141
01:13:58,199 --> 01:14:01,567
 That's when the Lost Battalion 
       Campaign happened,       

1142
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:07,707
  because our general was very, 
    you might say, ambitious.   

1143
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,809
   You say "blood and guts"--   

1144
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:13,813
      why, it was our blood     
     and his guts, you know?    

1145
01:14:13,815 --> 01:14:16,882
            NARRATOR:           
Major General John E. Dahlquist,

1146
01:14:16,884 --> 01:14:20,619
commander of the Texas Division,
  was relatively new to combat  

1147
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:23,722
       and had nearly lost      
        his command twice       

1148
01:14:23,724 --> 01:14:26,025
     during the drive north     
        from the Riviera        

1149
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:29,128
      for allowing his men      
         to lag behind.         

1150
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:32,331
   But he was convinced he was  
       a better tactician       

1151
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,133
  than more seasoned soldiers.  

1152
01:14:34,135 --> 01:14:37,069
   And he would prove willing   
      to use his detachment     

1153
01:14:37,071 --> 01:14:42,575
  of Japanese-American veterans 
  to correct his own mistakes.  

1154
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:46,245
     The village of Bruyères    
     was their first target.    

1155
01:14:46,247 --> 01:14:49,348
     Dahlquist assured them     
      the surrounding hills     

1156
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:50,749
   were only lightly defended.  

1157
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:56,689
    In fact, they were filled   
    with well-dug-in Germans.   

1158
01:14:56,691 --> 01:14:59,091
   The 442nd cleared them off   

1159
01:14:59,093 --> 01:15:01,327
          in four days,         
      despite the terrain,      

1160
01:15:01,329 --> 01:15:04,730
     the steady icy downpour    
   that filled their foxholes,  

1161
01:15:04,732 --> 01:15:10,769
and the rain of artillery shells
  bursting among the treetops.  

1162
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:16,910
       As soon as they had      
         taken Bruyères,        

1163
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:19,279
   General Dahlquist insisted   

1164
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,213
        they push further       
      into enemy territory,     

1165
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:24,316
        to seize another        
      heavily defended hill     

1166
01:15:24,318 --> 01:15:25,584
    overlooking Biffontaine,    

1167
01:15:25,586 --> 01:15:28,855
         a tiny village         
  with no military importance,  

1168
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:32,759
        and then to take        
        the town itself.        

1169
01:15:37,031 --> 01:15:42,201
         They did it all        
        in just two days,       

1170
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:44,971
   but their losses were heavy  

1171
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:46,873
         in part because        
   the inexperienced Dahlquist  

1172
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:51,644
 first gave them an unrealistic 
  deadline for taking the hill, 

1173
01:15:51,646 --> 01:15:54,680
    then ordered them off it,   

1174
01:15:54,682 --> 01:15:59,552
  then forced them to retake it 
   when the Germans returned.   

1175
01:15:59,554 --> 01:16:04,223
          SUSUMU SATOW:         
      General Dahlquist was     

1176
01:16:04,225 --> 01:16:07,059
     a very strict general.     

1177
01:16:07,061 --> 01:16:09,362
 And especially, it seems to me,

1178
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:13,666
   that he was trying to push   
  the 442nd too hard, too far.  

1179
01:16:13,668 --> 01:16:17,569
          Telling us to         
  "Advance, advance," you know. 

1180
01:16:17,571 --> 01:16:19,505
   So he was hard in that way.  

1181
01:16:19,507 --> 01:16:24,677
    And I really didn't have    
      any respect for him.      

1182
01:16:24,679 --> 01:16:29,082
            NARRATOR:           
  Meanwhile, General Dahlquist  
      had sent a battalion      

1183
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:33,018
  of his Texans along a densely 
         forested ridge         

1184
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:36,054
    toward the important town   
           of St. Dié.          

1185
01:16:36,056 --> 01:16:39,826
     Again, veteran officers    
           warned him           

1186
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:42,394
 the woods were full of Germans.

1187
01:16:42,396 --> 01:16:47,266
    Again, Dahlquist insisted   
        there were none.        

1188
01:16:47,268 --> 01:16:51,337
         Within an hour,        
  the Texans were under attack. 

1189
01:16:51,339 --> 01:16:53,906
     (artillery thundering)     

1190
01:16:53,908 --> 01:16:58,511
    275 of them were cut off    
 and surrounded by the Germans, 

1191
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:02,181
      who zeroed in on them     
        from three sides.       

1192
01:17:04,851 --> 01:17:09,722
          For two days,         
 shells blasted their positions.

1193
01:17:10,891 --> 01:17:15,494
   The Texans began to run out  
     of food and ammunition.    

1194
01:17:16,596 --> 01:17:20,232
  Two attempts to break through 
         to them failed.        

1195
01:17:23,503 --> 01:17:26,371
     Finally, on October 26,    

1196
01:17:26,373 --> 01:17:28,007
        Dahlquist ordered       
        the exhausted men       

1197
01:17:28,009 --> 01:17:32,377
     of the 442nd to return     
      to the wooded slopes,     

1198
01:17:32,379 --> 01:17:34,513
  rescue the "Lost Battalion"-- 

1199
01:17:34,515 --> 01:17:36,782
       as the Texans would      
       come to be called--      

1200
01:17:36,784 --> 01:17:40,453
   and restore his reputation.  

1201
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:44,523
           TIM TOKUNO:          
    One time, our regimental    
    commander, Colonel Pence,   

1202
01:17:44,525 --> 01:17:47,526
    pleaded with the division   
      commander, you know,      

1203
01:17:47,528 --> 01:17:52,665
 that we could pull back because
    our men were so depleted.   

1204
01:17:54,067 --> 01:17:57,303
 But the Division General said, 

1205
01:17:57,305 --> 01:18:02,041
 "No, we need to get those boys 
  out because every day counts. 

1206
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:04,410
        "You get in there       
        and get them out        

1207
01:18:04,412 --> 01:18:08,314
   if it takes every damn last  
      one of you to do it."     

1208
01:18:13,186 --> 01:18:16,054
            NARRATOR:           
         For five days,         

1209
01:18:16,056 --> 01:18:18,123
   fighting from tree to tree   
          in heavy fog,         

1210
01:18:18,125 --> 01:18:21,760
        they tried to get       
       to the trapped men.      

1211
01:18:23,062 --> 01:18:24,763
  On the morning of October 30, 

1212
01:18:24,765 --> 01:18:29,768
   they were just 1,000 yards   
       from the survivors,      

1213
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:33,438
     but pinned to the slope    
          by artillery          

1214
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:40,145
           KASHIWAGI:           
  We were stuck because there's 
    a terrain that was steep,   

1215
01:18:40,147 --> 01:18:42,348
    and so we were on our own   

1216
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,952
    like a cowboy and Indian    
         type of battle,        

1217
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:48,254
     and so the other people    
        couldn't help us.       

1218
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:51,924
            NARRATOR:           
  Finally, they had had enough. 

1219
01:18:51,926 --> 01:18:54,293
           "I" Company          
     and Robert Kashiwagi's     

1220
01:18:54,295 --> 01:18:56,362
 "K" Company rose to their feet 

1221
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:58,263
  and charged up the hillside,  

1222
01:18:58,265 --> 01:19:01,667
        hurling grenades        
  into German machine gun nests 

1223
01:19:01,669 --> 01:19:05,204
    and firing from the waist   
        as they climbed.        

1224
01:19:08,142 --> 01:19:11,276
           KASHIWAGI:           
  We just went hog-wild crazy.  

1225
01:19:11,278 --> 01:19:12,545
    We were mad at everybody    

1226
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:15,981
     and were ready to kill     
    anything that there was.    

1227
01:19:18,818 --> 01:19:22,087
   And finally we made contact  
    with the Lost Battalion,    

1228
01:19:22,089 --> 01:19:26,425
        and we found only       
      230 or so surviving.      

1229
01:19:26,427 --> 01:19:32,732
       But we lost 400 men      
   trying to rescue those 230.  

1230
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:34,967
 What a terrible price we paid. 

1231
01:19:35,836 --> 01:19:38,470
             TOKUNO:            
  After we rescued the outfit,  

1232
01:19:38,472 --> 01:19:43,042
 why, the first Caucasian fellow
          that came out         

1233
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:47,713
   said, "I was never so glad   
    to see a Jap in my life."   

1234
01:19:47,715 --> 01:19:49,848
           (wry laugh)          

1235
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:52,851
 That's the first thing he said.

1236
01:20:14,407 --> 01:20:19,511
            NARRATOR:           
     "I" Company had started    
  into the forest with 185 men. 

1237
01:20:20,247 --> 01:20:25,284
  Just eight walked out unhurt. 

1238
01:20:25,286 --> 01:20:29,789
 Robert Kashiwagi's "K" Company 
     had begun with 186 men.    

1239
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:32,791
    Only 17 emerged on foot.    

1240
01:20:32,793 --> 01:20:37,796
     All the rest were dead     
     or wounded or missing.     

1241
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:43,836
 Kashiwagi had himself been hit 
     by shrapnel for a third    

1242
01:20:43,838 --> 01:20:46,705
     and then a fourth time     
        in the fighting.        

1243
01:20:55,081 --> 01:20:59,151
        A few days later,       
Mr. and Mrs. Kametaro Takeuichi,

1244
01:20:59,153 --> 01:21:02,988
     formerly of Sacramento,    
  now living behind barbed wire 

1245
01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:08,026
    at the Granada Relocation   
  Center, received a telegram.  

1246
01:21:08,028 --> 01:21:11,897
       Their son, Tadashi,      
   had been among those killed  

1247
01:21:11,899 --> 01:21:15,901
    in the struggle to rescue   
       the Lost Battalion.      

1248
01:21:21,908 --> 01:21:25,978
         On November 12,        
   General Dahlquist announced  

1249
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,781
 he wanted to review the 442nd, 

1250
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:32,684
          to thank them         
     for what they had done.    

1251
01:21:32,686 --> 01:21:34,286
           KASHIWAGI:           
      The general decided,      

1252
01:21:34,288 --> 01:21:38,891
       "Well, now, we want      
      to award you people.      

1253
01:21:38,893 --> 01:21:42,761
  And so he said, "We want the  
  whole regiment in formation." 

1254
01:21:42,763 --> 01:21:46,331
       And when the re...       
   when the general got there   

1255
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:49,768
  and looked at the formation,  
    and he was so disgusted,    

1256
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:54,006
  he said, "I asked you to get  
 the whole regiment out there!" 

1257
01:21:55,909 --> 01:21:58,310
  with tears in his eyes, says, 
       "General," he says,      

1258
01:21:58,312 --> 01:22:01,980
     "that's all that's left    
  of that particular regiment.  

1259
01:22:01,982 --> 01:22:05,418
       That's exactly what      
         you did to us."        

1260
01:22:07,687 --> 01:22:13,692
            NARRATOR:           
   The 100th/442nd would spend  
      the next four months      

1261
01:22:13,694 --> 01:22:15,761
    in the south of France--    

1262
01:22:15,763 --> 01:22:18,430
  and then receive new orders.  

1263
01:22:18,432 --> 01:22:21,567
    They were needed to lead    
     still another assault--    

1264
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:26,405
  back where they had started,  
            in Italy.           

1265
01:22:28,842 --> 01:22:32,845
  The bitterness the survivors  
  felt toward General Dahlquist 

1266
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:35,414
      continued to smolder.     

1267
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:39,184
        Many years later,       
   at a review at Fort Bragg,   

1268
01:22:39,186 --> 01:22:41,954
      Dahlquist encountered     
   a white lieutenant colonel   

1269
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:45,390
         who had served         
  with the Japanese Americans.  

1270
01:22:45,392 --> 01:22:47,225
      He offered his hand.      

1271
01:22:47,227 --> 01:22:51,197
    "Let bygones be bygones,"   
         Dahlquist said.        

1272
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,600
         "It's all water        
  under the bridge, isn't it?"  

1273
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:56,702
      The colonel saluted--     

1274
01:22:56,704 --> 01:23:00,606
     but he would not shake     
       the general's hand.      

1275
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:27,833
          JIM SHERMAN:          
         In the schools,        

1276
01:23:27,835 --> 01:23:30,803
     we always talked about     
  what was happening in the war 

1277
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:34,473
        in all the grades       
        that I remember.        

1278
01:23:34,475 --> 01:23:38,243
 Once in a while, we would have 
  somebody come home, you know, 

1279
01:23:38,245 --> 01:23:41,914
      who had been overseas     
 who would come up to the school

1280
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:46,318
      and talk about where      
     they had been or, in...    

1281
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,521
  You really, you know, again,  
            you know,           

1282
01:23:49,523 --> 01:23:51,123
 between six and ten years old, 

1283
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:55,393
 I wasn't into the geopolitical 
       aspects of the war.      

1284
01:23:55,395 --> 01:23:59,431
      I was more impressed      
         to see the guy.        

1285
01:24:12,812 --> 01:24:18,751
        (Benny Goodman's        
 "I Know that You Know" playing)

1286
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,888
            NARRATOR:           
    While Eugene Sledge tried   
           to recover           

1287
01:24:22,890 --> 01:24:24,456
  from the horrors of Peleliu,  

1288
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:29,962
  his best friend Sid Phillips  
    was back home in Mobile.    

1289
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:33,298
        SIDNEY PHILLIPS:        
    I felt like it was simply   
            a dream,            

1290
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:36,035
     that I actually wasn't     
          coming home.          

1291
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:38,403
 Even after I arrived in Mobile,

1292
01:24:38,405 --> 01:24:41,106
     I kept thinking that...    
      that I can't be here,     

1293
01:24:41,108 --> 01:24:42,842
   that I'm going to wake up.   

1294
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:45,777
           The feeling          
    that it wasn't happening,   

1295
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:48,747
   I think, was overwhelming.   

1296
01:24:48,749 --> 01:24:50,782
   You just couldn't feel like  

1297
01:24:50,784 --> 01:24:52,651
 that you had actually survived 
             the war            

1298
01:24:52,653 --> 01:24:56,054
 and that you were actually back
        in your hometown        

1299
01:24:56,056 --> 01:24:58,390
   and, uh, in your own house.  

1300
01:24:58,392 --> 01:25:01,926
      I don't think I slept     
      for about three days.     

1301
01:25:01,928 --> 01:25:05,164
   I was astounded when I saw   

1302
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:07,599
    how much change had come    
          to the city.          

1303
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:12,971
        It was so crowded       
 and so much hustle and bustle, 

1304
01:25:12,973 --> 01:25:16,809
 I hardly recognized the place. 

1305
01:25:27,888 --> 01:25:32,258
 I think, uh, every man that was
  in the service was well aware 

1306
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,294
    of the fact that when you   
     came home on furlough,     

1307
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:37,796
    it was a very good chance   
      that you would lapse      

1308
01:25:37,798 --> 01:25:41,133
         into a release         
      of bad language so...     

1309
01:25:41,135 --> 01:25:43,802
       uh, it was dominant      
        in your thinking.       

1310
01:25:43,804 --> 01:25:47,305
    It made you speak slowly    
        and deliberately        

1311
01:25:47,307 --> 01:25:50,576
         and almost, uh,        
     repeat in your own mind    

1312
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:53,879
   what you were going to say   
   before you said it because,  

1313
01:25:53,881 --> 01:25:56,815
  you know, uh, in the service, 

1314
01:25:56,817 --> 01:25:58,851
       you just don't use       
         any adjectives.        

1315
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:02,320
 You forget all your adjectives 
    and just use one or two.    

1316
01:26:02,322 --> 01:26:03,288
Like?                           

1317
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:05,624
     Like I'm not going say.    

1318
01:26:05,626 --> 01:26:11,763
  My wife would come down from  
 Heaven and hit me on the head. 

1319
01:26:11,765 --> 01:26:15,134
     (explosions thundering     
          in distance)          

1320
01:26:21,841 --> 01:26:24,743
            FUSSELL:            
   When you come on the line,   
       you are very brave       

1321
01:26:24,745 --> 01:26:30,615
    because you know nothing    
     about what's happening.    

1322
01:26:30,617 --> 01:26:35,420
      And it's easy for you     
to perform pseudo-brave gestures

1323
01:26:35,422 --> 01:26:38,323
         and procedures         
   because you don't know yet.  

1324
01:26:38,325 --> 01:26:40,592
        And gradually...        
         this is because        

1325
01:26:40,594 --> 01:26:43,662
 you have a reservoir of courage
        when you arrive,        

1326
01:26:43,664 --> 01:26:46,031
   and each time you get badly  
           frightened,          

1327
01:26:46,033 --> 01:26:50,702
    a little of it diminishes   
 until you don't have any left. 

1328
01:26:50,704 --> 01:26:54,840
  And that is the worst moment. 

1329
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:58,343
            NARRATOR:           
      As the Lost Battalion     
       was being rescued,       

1330
01:26:58,345 --> 01:27:01,380
          Paul Fussell,         
a newly-minted second lieutenant

1331
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:06,251
 in the 103rd Infantry Division,
    was bivouacked at Epinal,   

1332
01:27:06,253 --> 01:27:08,520
           at the foot          
    of the Vosges Mountains.    

1333
01:27:08,522 --> 01:27:12,490
      He was 20 years old,      
   from Pasadena, California,   

1334
01:27:12,492 --> 01:27:15,527
      fresh from 19 months      
          of training,          

1335
01:27:15,529 --> 01:27:16,962
   and filled with excitement.  

1336
01:27:16,964 --> 01:27:22,767
 He had told his parents he felt
    "very confident and safe"   

1337
01:27:22,769 --> 01:27:24,602
     as he went off to war.     

1338
01:27:24,604 --> 01:27:28,907
    The reception he and his    
  fellow soldiers had received  

1339
01:27:28,909 --> 01:27:31,843
   during their first few days  
       in southern France       

1340
01:27:31,845 --> 01:27:36,181
   only added to his buoyancy.  

1341
01:27:36,183 --> 01:27:40,351
As the division moved northward,
      up the Rhone Valley,      

1342
01:27:40,353 --> 01:27:43,388
      young women appeared      
         along the road,        

1343
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:47,959
     waving and passing out     
        bottles of wine.        

1344
01:27:56,736 --> 01:28:01,373
            FUSSELL:            
   We brought in good health--  
        very important--        

1345
01:28:01,375 --> 01:28:05,076
       youth, optimism...       

1346
01:28:05,078 --> 01:28:10,716
  That's why these 18-year-olds 
    could pursue war at all.    

1347
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:12,584
         They were kids.        

1348
01:28:12,586 --> 01:28:16,155
 And they really thought that if
you did well, you'd be rewarded.

1349
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:17,990
 I mean, they're that innocent. 

1350
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:21,827
        They had no idea        
     about life's accidents.    

1351
01:28:26,066 --> 01:28:27,499
            NARRATOR:           
  On the night of November 10,  

1352
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:29,901
   he and the rest of the men   
         of Company "F"         

1353
01:28:29,903 --> 01:28:32,037
  were ordered up to the front, 

1354
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:35,673
 to a thickly forested hillside 
      overlooking St. Dié,      

1355
01:28:35,675 --> 01:28:38,710
 the town toward which the Lost 
   Battalion had been heading   

1356
01:28:38,712 --> 01:28:42,815
     when it was surrounded     
         by the Germans.        

1357
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:45,917
      They were to replace      
         a weary company        

1358
01:28:45,919 --> 01:28:51,389
      that had been engaged     
    with the enemy for weeks.   

1359
01:28:52,692 --> 01:28:56,828
            FUSSELL:            
  I came across two German kids 

1360
01:28:56,830 --> 01:29:00,966
   dead, lying on their backs.  

1361
01:29:00,968 --> 01:29:03,402
       They'd been killed       
         the day before         

1362
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:06,138
 by the unit we were replacing. 

1363
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:09,941
     And they were so young,    
     I couldn't believe it.     

1364
01:29:09,943 --> 01:29:16,081
   I thought they were between  
   maybe 12 and 14 years old.   

1365
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,584
   And at the end of the war,   
           of course,           

1366
01:29:19,586 --> 01:29:22,987
   the Germans were absolutely  
       scraping the barrel      

1367
01:29:22,989 --> 01:29:29,627
         of everybody--         
  old men who could hardly walk 

1368
01:29:29,629 --> 01:29:33,765
         and little kids        
    from late grammar school.   

1369
01:29:33,767 --> 01:29:37,769
         These kids had         
       little uniforms on.      

1370
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:40,672
     They were wearing caps,    
          not helmets.          

1371
01:29:40,674 --> 01:29:44,242
     And each had been shot     
        through the head.       

1372
01:29:44,244 --> 01:29:48,746
 And the blue, bluish-red brains

1373
01:29:48,748 --> 01:29:52,250
     of one were coming out     
         his nostrils--         

1374
01:29:52,252 --> 01:29:55,253
 they had their eyes open, too. 

1375
01:29:55,255 --> 01:29:59,791
 his bluish-red brain was coming
  out just from under his cap,  

1376
01:29:59,793 --> 01:30:04,596
     and sort of displacing     
     his cap as he wore it.     

1377
01:30:04,598 --> 01:30:08,233
 And that really gave me a jolt.

1378
01:30:08,235 --> 01:30:09,734
      I seldom refer to it.     

1379
01:30:09,736 --> 01:30:13,505
   But it was my introduction   
     to some painful facts--    

1380
01:30:13,507 --> 01:30:15,040
    that this war is<i> serious.</i>   

1381
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:20,912
   We are going to kill people  
    regardless of their age,    

1382
01:30:20,914 --> 01:30:23,815
   as long as they're wearing   
         German uniforms        

1383
01:30:23,817 --> 01:30:26,851
    and they are going to try   
           to kill us.          

1384
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:42,133
           DWAIN LUCE:          
        I often wondered        
  why the Germans didn't quit.  

1385
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:48,506
 I wondered why they didn't quit
         after Normandy.        

1386
01:30:50,043 --> 01:30:53,011
   Once we successfully landed  
        on the continent,       

1387
01:30:53,013 --> 01:30:56,915
      to me it was obvious      
   we're going to win the war.  

1388
01:30:56,917 --> 01:30:58,883
      It was just how long,     
          or how soon.          

1389
01:30:58,885 --> 01:31:03,455
And we, all that we went through
and the people that were killed.

1390
01:31:03,457 --> 01:31:05,357
 But... what's your alternative?

1391
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:09,528
            NARRATOR:           
       The Allied Command       
 in Europe had not waited to see

1392
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:11,996
   how Operation Market Garden  
   turned out before mounting   

1393
01:31:11,998 --> 01:31:17,635
 four more-or-less simultaneous 
   assaults on the West Wall,   

1394
01:31:17,637 --> 01:31:22,040
     which the Allies called    
       the Siegfried Line.      

1395
01:31:22,042 --> 01:31:25,978
     Each had fallen short.     

1396
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:29,347
    The Seventh Army overran    
           Strasbourg           

1397
01:31:29,349 --> 01:31:32,618
         but was halted         
    on the Rhine's west bank.   

1398
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:35,453
   Patton's 3rd Army took Metz  

1399
01:31:35,455 --> 01:31:38,790
  and secured three bridgeheads 
        across the Saar,        

1400
01:31:38,792 --> 01:31:40,526
  but could proceed no further  

1401
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:44,530
 until it could get enough fuel 
            to go on.           

1402
01:31:44,532 --> 01:31:47,332
          In the north,         
    two attacks were launched   

1403
01:31:47,334 --> 01:31:49,535
    by the American 1st Army:   

1404
01:31:49,537 --> 01:31:52,604
one was aimed at the German city
           of Aachen;           

1405
01:31:52,606 --> 01:31:56,207
       the other intended       
       to sweep the enemy       

1406
01:31:56,209 --> 01:31:58,510
 from the 50 wooded square miles
           just south           

1407
01:31:58,512 --> 01:32:02,413
          of that city          
   called the Hürtgen Forest.   

1408
01:32:09,354 --> 01:32:12,957
          TOM GALLOWAY:         
       The Hürtgen Forest       
         was the worst.         

1409
01:32:12,959 --> 01:32:16,428
   And you haven't heard much   
       about it because...      

1410
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:17,596
     it was just a mess-up.     

1411
01:32:17,598 --> 01:32:20,298
       There was no reason      
    to go through the forest,   

1412
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:22,834
  but the generals kept wanting 
    to go through the forest.   

1413
01:32:22,836 --> 01:32:25,937
    And you'd put a division    
    in there and chew it up.    

1414
01:32:25,939 --> 01:32:27,005
     And they'd pull it out     

1415
01:32:27,007 --> 01:32:29,941
   and put another division in  
         and chew it up.        

1416
01:32:30,743 --> 01:32:35,347
            NARRATOR:           
   It was a nightmarish place   
            to fight.           

1417
01:32:36,882 --> 01:32:39,050
     With 100-foot fir trees    

1418
01:32:39,052 --> 01:32:42,320
    that in some places grew    
      just four feet apart,     

1419
01:32:42,322 --> 01:32:48,393
    it was so dense and dark    
    and shrouded in dank fog,   

1420
01:32:48,395 --> 01:32:51,863
 that "upon entering it you want
      to drop things behind     

1421
01:32:51,865 --> 01:32:53,331
       "to mark your path,      

1422
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:57,201
    as Hansel and Gretel did    
    with their bread crumbs."   

1423
01:32:57,203 --> 01:33:02,207
       Two parallel lines       
       of German pillboxes      

1424
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:05,777
  and log-and-dirt bunkers were 
     hidden among the trees,    

1425
01:33:05,779 --> 01:33:10,381
      several miles apart.      

1426
01:33:10,383 --> 01:33:14,552
 The pine needles that blanketed
        the forest floor        

1427
01:33:14,554 --> 01:33:15,920
       disguised tripwires      

1428
01:33:15,922 --> 01:33:18,823
 and mines the Americans called 
       "Bouncing Betties"       

1429
01:33:18,825 --> 01:33:24,328
    that sprang into the air    
  and went off at groin height. 

1430
01:33:25,531 --> 01:33:28,333
         The commanders         
     who planned the battle     

1431
01:33:28,335 --> 01:33:30,802
       knew almost nothing      
        about the terrain       

1432
01:33:30,804 --> 01:33:37,041
    and never came to see it    
         for themselves.        

1433
01:33:37,043 --> 01:33:40,145
   And no one had been trained  
    to fight in such a place.   

1434
01:33:40,147 --> 01:33:43,948
    "We're taking three trees   
    a day," one officer said,   

1435
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:49,220
        "and they cost us       
     a hundred men apiece."     

1436
01:33:49,222 --> 01:33:51,589
        (machine-gun fire       
          in distance)          

1437
01:33:51,591 --> 01:33:54,526
     The first two divisions    
  to be ordered into the forest 

1438
01:33:54,528 --> 01:33:58,396
      would lose 4,500 men      
        in three weeks...       

1439
01:33:58,398 --> 01:34:02,300
        ...and move less        
        than three miles.       

1440
01:34:07,473 --> 01:34:12,177
     On November 2, the 28th    
   Infantry Division followed.  

1441
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:16,147
          With them was         
 Second Lieutenant Tom Galloway 

1442
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:17,548
      from Mobile, Alabama,     

1443
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:21,687
 an acquaintance of Sid Phillips
    and his sister Katharine.   

1444
01:34:21,689 --> 01:34:24,089
      He had been a senior      
      at Auburn University      

1445
01:34:24,091 --> 01:34:27,893
    and was now a replacement   
   officer on the front lines,  

1446
01:34:27,895 --> 01:34:30,127
       a forward observer       

1447
01:34:30,129 --> 01:34:35,599
        scouting targets        
 for the 109th Field Artillery. 

1448
01:34:35,601 --> 01:34:38,970
            GALLOWAY:           
  The man I replaced got shot,  
           and, uh...           

1449
01:34:38,972 --> 01:34:42,507
     it just wasn't too good    
      to think that, uh...      

1450
01:34:42,509 --> 01:34:46,377
      what happened to him,     
  but then you've replaced him. 

1451
01:34:46,379 --> 01:34:51,115
            NARRATOR:           
 Targets were almost impossible 
    to spot from the ground.    

1452
01:34:54,887 --> 01:34:59,290
  Dense growth and constant fog 
 hid them from the air, as well.

1453
01:34:59,292 --> 01:35:01,726
     Tanks could barely move    
         on the handful         

1454
01:35:01,728 --> 01:35:05,596
        of narrow, muddy,       
  heavily mined logging trails. 

1455
01:35:05,598 --> 01:35:09,100
   Soldiers could not see one   
  another, let alone the enemy. 

1456
01:35:09,102 --> 01:35:14,239
  "If anyone said he knew where 
  he was," one commander said,  

1457
01:35:14,241 --> 01:35:17,441
     "he was a damned liar!"    

1458
01:35:19,611 --> 01:35:20,879
       Despite everything,      

1459
01:35:20,881 --> 01:35:22,848
    Galloway's division took    
      its first objective--     

1460
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:27,786
  the little town of Schmidt--  
        in just two days.       

1461
01:35:27,788 --> 01:35:32,556
    The Germans took it back    
     the following morning.     

1462
01:35:33,692 --> 01:35:39,431
     The battle lines became    
        totally confused.       

1463
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,699
            GALLOWAY:           
      We were all mixed up.     

1464
01:35:41,701 --> 01:35:43,802
      Give you an example.      

1465
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:47,973
   there was only one building  
    that I know about there,    

1466
01:35:47,975 --> 01:35:52,043
and both the German and American
      medics were using it.     

1467
01:35:52,045 --> 01:35:54,712
   They were just bringing in   
         all the wounded        

1468
01:35:54,714 --> 01:35:58,583
 and both sides were using that 
          one building.         

1469
01:35:59,652 --> 01:36:02,888
            NARRATOR:           
    A steady, cold rain began   
            to fall,            

1470
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:05,523
  followed by sleet, then snow. 

1471
01:36:05,525 --> 01:36:08,993
Thousands developed trench foot.

1472
01:36:09,996 --> 01:36:12,163
     When it was too painful    
            to stand,           

1473
01:36:12,165 --> 01:36:14,666
     men took turns kneeling    
        in the icy water        

1474
01:36:14,668 --> 01:36:17,769
   that filled their foxholes.  

1475
01:36:21,573 --> 01:36:24,909
     German 88 shells burst     
  in the fir trees above them,  

1476
01:36:24,911 --> 01:36:30,915
 showering the men with shrapnel
and dagger-sharp shards of wood.

1477
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:35,353
            GALLOWAY:           
     The artillery would hit    
           those trees          

1478
01:36:35,355 --> 01:36:38,689
       and you didn't know      
  if you were hit by artillery  

1479
01:36:38,691 --> 01:36:39,924
         or flying wood.        

1480
01:36:39,926 --> 01:36:42,760
     There just was no place    
       to get protection.       

1481
01:36:42,762 --> 01:36:45,396
       The Germans had it,      
     they had it all mapped     

1482
01:36:45,398 --> 01:36:49,166
     and you had to go down     
         to firebreaks.         

1483
01:36:49,168 --> 01:36:53,537
 Of course they would have guns 
      at those firebreaks.      

1484
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:56,441
       And it made it bad.      

1485
01:36:56,443 --> 01:36:59,177
          I just recall         
     one morning, I went in     

1486
01:36:59,179 --> 01:37:02,347
       with the battalion       

1487
01:37:02,349 --> 01:37:06,718
      and before nightfall,     
  the sergeant major came to me 

1488
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,621
        and told me I was       
 the only officer they had left.

1489
01:37:09,623 --> 01:37:10,988
 And that's out of a battalion. 

1490
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:15,793
        And it just, uh,        
    it just chewed people up.   

1491
01:37:15,795 --> 01:37:18,997
     (explosions thundering)    

1492
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:23,335
            NARRATOR:           
   "The days were so terrible   
that I would pray for darkness,"

1493
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:24,602
      one private recalled,     

1494
01:37:24,604 --> 01:37:29,540
   "and the nights were so bad  
   I would pray for daylight."  

1495
01:37:29,542 --> 01:37:34,746
  By November 13, the officers  
  of every single rifle company 

1496
01:37:34,748 --> 01:37:40,618
      in the 28th Division      
   had been killed or wounded.  

1497
01:37:41,586 --> 01:37:45,022
          After a night         
 of continuous German shelling, 

1498
01:37:45,024 --> 01:37:47,559
an entire company broke and ran.

1499
01:37:47,561 --> 01:37:52,563
    Even officers with drawn    
 revolvers could not stop them. 

1500
01:37:52,565 --> 01:37:57,034
 Hundreds of men shot themselves
       in the foot or hand      

1501
01:37:57,036 --> 01:37:59,404
  rather than endure any more.  

1502
01:37:59,406 --> 01:38:02,273
     Hundreds more collapsed    
        psychologically,        

1503
01:38:02,275 --> 01:38:07,679
sat staring into the distance as
 if no battle raged around them.

1504
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:10,748
     The reporter Ernie Pyle    
            called it           

1505
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:15,153
     "the accumulated blur,     
      the hurting vagueness     

1506
01:38:15,155 --> 01:38:18,055
of being too long in the lines."

1507
01:38:23,662 --> 01:38:27,898
  In mid-November, fresh troops 
     replaced what was left     

1508
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:30,902
   of Tom Galloway's division.  

1509
01:38:35,508 --> 01:38:41,012
   The fighting in the Hürtgen  
  Forest would go on for weeks. 

1510
01:38:41,014 --> 01:38:47,652
        More than 33,000        
American soldiers would be lost.

1511
01:38:47,654 --> 01:38:48,786
          So many died          

1512
01:38:48,788 --> 01:38:51,956
    and those who lived spent   
so much time desperately digging

1513
01:38:51,958 --> 01:38:53,658
    for their own protection    

1514
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:56,961
  that there were few burials.  

1515
01:38:56,963 --> 01:38:59,264
      When the snow melted      
      the following spring,     

1516
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:02,400
       hundreds of bodies       
       and parts of bodies      

1517
01:39:02,402 --> 01:39:05,803
       would still litter       
        the forest floor.       

1518
01:39:07,272 --> 01:39:09,707
            GALLOWAY:           
         The men were...        

1519
01:39:09,709 --> 01:39:12,444
well, you were just all beat up.

1520
01:39:12,446 --> 01:39:13,644
    You'd been in that mess.    

1521
01:39:13,646 --> 01:39:14,879
  You'd been under that strain. 

1522
01:39:14,881 --> 01:39:18,516
      You just... were glad     
      to get out of there.      

1523
01:39:18,518 --> 01:39:20,818
      I like to think that      
  probably the prettiest sight  

1524
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:25,122
      that I saw over there     
  was coming out of the forest, 

1525
01:39:25,124 --> 01:39:29,794
  It had snowed and the whole-- 
   these were big fir trees--   

1526
01:39:29,796 --> 01:39:32,764
    and they were all pretty    
   with snow on and everything  

1527
01:39:32,766 --> 01:39:35,032
      and I couldn't decide     
  whether the scene was pretty  

1528
01:39:35,034 --> 01:39:37,435
        or I was so glad        
       to get out of there      

1529
01:39:37,437 --> 01:39:38,836
  that made it look so pretty.  

1530
01:39:38,838 --> 01:39:41,740
     But I do remember that.    

1531
01:39:41,742 --> 01:39:45,910
            NARRATOR:           
    Galloway and his comrades   
 were sent for rest and recovery

1532
01:39:45,912 --> 01:39:48,379
     to the Ardennes Forest,    

1533
01:39:48,381 --> 01:39:53,517
a quiet place where nothing much
  was thought likely to happen. 

1534
01:39:56,155 --> 01:40:02,360
("Come Ye Thankful People, Come"
            playing)            

1535
01:40:03,695 --> 01:40:09,066
            NARRATOR:           
       November 23, 1944,       
        was Thanksgiving.       

1536
01:40:13,705 --> 01:40:16,440
         Defense workers        
       in Mobile, Alabama,      

1537
01:40:16,442 --> 01:40:22,146
   remained on the job to help  
   "speed the day of victory."  

1538
01:40:24,316 --> 01:40:28,953
       At noon, servicemen      
at McClellan Field in Sacramento

1539
01:40:28,955 --> 01:40:35,026
 were serenaded by the glee club
 of the 4909 Aviation Squadron. 

1540
01:40:39,665 --> 01:40:41,265
   And in Luverne, Minnesota,   

1541
01:40:41,267 --> 01:40:45,303
 the local Lutheran church held 
 separate Thanksgiving services 

1542
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:48,272
    in English and in German.   

1543
01:40:52,043 --> 01:40:54,212
     The commander in chief,    

1544
01:40:54,214 --> 01:40:57,782
       just reelected for       
  an unprecedented fourth term, 

1545
01:40:57,784 --> 01:41:00,785
     celebrated the holiday     
       with polio patients      

1546
01:41:00,787 --> 01:41:03,354
    at Warm Springs, Georgia.   

1547
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:10,027
SASCHA WEINZHEIMER (dramatized):
         "Thanksgiving.         

1548
01:41:10,029 --> 01:41:14,532
   "We had half a can of Spam,  
  cooked one extra cup of rice, 

1549
01:41:14,534 --> 01:41:16,934
     "and got enough talinum    
         from our garden        

1550
01:41:16,936 --> 01:41:22,072
     for a salad with three     
whole garlics chopped up in it."

1551
01:41:22,074 --> 01:41:24,008
          "We thank God         
       we are all together      

1552
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:28,313
      "and not really sick      
like so many people in here are.

1553
01:41:28,315 --> 01:41:32,383
      "As usual, we talked      
  about our next Thanksgiving.  

1554
01:41:32,385 --> 01:41:35,687
      "Buddy wouldn't know      
    what a turkey was anyway,   

1555
01:41:35,689 --> 01:41:40,525
      but I still remember      
 what good food we always had." 

1556
01:41:40,527 --> 01:41:43,795
       Sascha Weinzheimer.      

1557
01:41:43,797 --> 01:41:48,399
            NARRATOR:           
 Rumors of rescue swept through 
  the Santo Tomas Prison Camp,  

1558
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:52,904
         raising hopes,         
       then dashing them.       

1559
01:41:52,906 --> 01:41:58,109
But there had been no more signs
 that the Americans were coming.

1560
01:41:58,111 --> 01:42:02,013
   MacArthur's Army was still   
         350 miles away         

1561
01:42:02,015 --> 01:42:04,748
     on the island of Leyte.    

1562
01:42:06,118 --> 01:42:10,888
   In Europe, morale among the  
 troops was said to be sinking. 

1563
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:13,757
      The men at the front,     
     like their commanders,     

1564
01:42:13,759 --> 01:42:17,328
          had expected          
  the war would be over by now. 

1565
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:18,596
        To cheer them up,       

1566
01:42:18,598 --> 01:42:22,566
 Eisenhower declared that every 
   man in the European theater  

1567
01:42:22,568 --> 01:42:24,735
   should have a turkey dinner  
        for Thanksgiving        

1568
01:42:24,737 --> 01:42:28,539
    no matter how hard it was   
          to organize.          

1569
01:42:28,541 --> 01:42:30,675
      In theHürtgen Forest,     

1570
01:42:30,677 --> 01:42:34,912
   a major in the 8th Infantry  
  Division went all the way up  

1571
01:42:34,914 --> 01:42:36,380
    to the division commander   

1572
01:42:36,382 --> 01:42:38,082
             begging            
    that it not be permitted.   

1573
01:42:38,084 --> 01:42:41,485
  When his men gathered around  
        to eat, he said,        

1574
01:42:41,487 --> 01:42:44,689
 German artillery would zero in 
            on them.            

1575
01:42:44,691 --> 01:42:49,093
 But the division commander had 
           his orders.          

1576
01:42:49,095 --> 01:42:52,629
  The cooks were on their way.  

1577
01:42:53,232 --> 01:42:55,266
      The major was right.      

1578
01:42:55,268 --> 01:42:56,734
  As his men grouped themselves 

1579
01:42:56,736 --> 01:43:02,006
   around the canisters of hot  
 turkey, the enemy opened fire. 

1580
01:43:02,008 --> 01:43:03,074
           (explosion)          

1581
01:43:03,076 --> 01:43:07,311
       As many as ten men       
   were blown apart at a time.  

1582
01:43:10,516 --> 01:43:12,483
The major would survive the war,

1583
01:43:12,485 --> 01:43:16,621
       but was never able       
  to face a turkey dinner again 

1584
01:43:16,623 --> 01:43:18,956
        without weeping.        

1585
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:28,399
     On the forested slopes     
    of the Vosges Mountains,    

1586
01:43:28,401 --> 01:43:31,569
 Thanksgiving turkey was served 
        to the men, too,        

1587
01:43:31,571 --> 01:43:33,671
 though it was cold by the time 

1588
01:43:33,673 --> 01:43:36,307
      it got to Lieutenant      
          Paul Fussell.         

1589
01:43:36,842 --> 01:43:39,010
      That same afternoon,      

1590
01:43:39,012 --> 01:43:42,913
    he found himself part of    
 a 12-man squad ordered forward 

1591
01:43:42,915 --> 01:43:48,686
  to scout the defenses of the  
 German-held town of Nothalten. 

1592
01:43:51,256 --> 01:43:53,558
      A burst of rifle fire     
           forced them          

1593
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:57,895
  to find what cover they could 
      behind a small rise.      

1594
01:43:57,897 --> 01:44:01,666
     German snipers had them    
        in their sights.        

1595
01:44:01,668 --> 01:44:03,968
      No one seemed to know     
           what to do.          

1596
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:08,206
    Then a second lieutenant    
 moved forward with his carbine.

1597
01:44:08,208 --> 01:44:12,009
"Let's get the sons of bitches,"
            he said.            

1598
01:44:12,011 --> 01:44:13,878
            FUSSELL:            
    His name was Abe Goldman.   

1599
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,680
     And most of the people     
     I fought with who were     

1600
01:44:16,682 --> 01:44:20,751
   from the South and Texas--   
      Oklahoma and so on--      

1601
01:44:20,753 --> 01:44:23,620
      had never seen a Jew      
         in their lives.        

1602
01:44:23,622 --> 01:44:27,859
And the idea of this Jewish kid,
          Abe Goldman,          

1603
01:44:27,861 --> 01:44:30,027
     who should have been--     
         in the view of         

1604
01:44:30,029 --> 01:44:32,396
  most of the other soldiers--  
        should have been        

1605
01:44:32,398 --> 01:44:34,365
   in the dry goods business,   

1606
01:44:34,367 --> 01:44:38,269
 to see him on the front line...

1607
01:44:38,271 --> 01:44:41,238
  and he was very enthusiastic. 

1608
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:43,841
        He knew what had        
      happened to the Jews.     

1609
01:44:43,843 --> 01:44:48,245
 He was probably the bravest one
 in the whole platoon of 40 men.

1610
01:44:48,247 --> 01:44:51,049
         And that's why         
      he got himself shot.      

1611
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:52,783
            (gunshot)           

1612
01:44:52,785 --> 01:44:54,685
    And the fact that out of,   
         say, 12 people,        

1613
01:44:54,687 --> 01:44:56,988
       he was the only one      
      that crawled forward      

1614
01:44:56,990 --> 01:45:01,892
        to risk his life        
   sort of changed, changed...  

1615
01:45:04,730 --> 01:45:07,999
       I'd say it changed       
         a lot of minds.        

1616
01:45:08,001 --> 01:45:11,569
            NARRATOR:           
     The fight for Nothalten    

1617
01:45:11,571 --> 01:45:14,805
   would take a terrible toll   
        on Fussell's men.       

1618
01:45:14,807 --> 01:45:17,474
      Abe Goldman survived,     

1619
01:45:17,476 --> 01:45:19,377
         but by the time        
      the battle was over,      

1620
01:45:19,379 --> 01:45:23,213
    the company had lost four   
      of its six officers.      

1621
01:45:23,215 --> 01:45:28,185
        Fussell's platoon       
     lost 13 of its 40 men.     

1622
01:45:28,187 --> 01:45:31,755
   The average life expectancy  
  for a junior infantry officer 

1623
01:45:31,757 --> 01:45:35,860
       on the front lines       
      was now just 17 days.     

1624
01:45:37,095 --> 01:45:41,832
           In the end,          
     Lieutenant Paul Fussell    

1625
01:45:41,834 --> 01:45:44,101
     would beat those odds.     

1626
01:45:44,103 --> 01:45:48,072
    But they would haunt him    
    for the rest of his life.   

1627
01:45:53,011 --> 01:45:57,881
        (engines droning)       

1628
01:46:01,419 --> 01:46:06,890
        QUENTIN AANENSON:       
 Well, as we pushed the Germans 
  back and as they retreated... 

1629
01:46:07,892 --> 01:46:10,862
    ...they were able to take   
     all of their flak guns     

1630
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:13,664
   and most of their artillery  
           with them.           

1631
01:46:19,271 --> 01:46:21,505
  So, as we would fly missions  

1632
01:46:21,507 --> 01:46:24,675
        into that area--        
      in the Hürtgen Forest     

1633
01:46:24,677 --> 01:46:27,611
    or into the Ruhr Valley--   

1634
01:46:27,613 --> 01:46:31,415
 we were facing a larger number 
          of flak guns          

1635
01:46:31,417 --> 01:46:33,718
       than we had before.      

1636
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:42,860
      So it was a terribly      
       brutal time for us.      

1637
01:46:49,201 --> 01:46:52,603
            NARRATOR:           
 Fighter pilot Quentin Aanenson 
     of Luverne, Minnesota,     

1638
01:46:52,605 --> 01:46:56,040
    had been helping provide    
  air cover for American troops 

1639
01:46:56,042 --> 01:46:59,076
 on the ground ever since D-Day.

1640
01:46:59,078 --> 01:47:03,381
     Through all that time,     
  his anchor to sanity had been 

1641
01:47:03,383 --> 01:47:06,984
  the belief that Jackie Greer, 
        the girl he'd met       

1642
01:47:06,986 --> 01:47:08,285
 while in training in Louisiana,

1643
01:47:08,287 --> 01:47:12,790
         would marry him        
     if he survived the war.    

1644
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:14,892
             GREER:             
     Following that war was     

1645
01:47:14,894 --> 01:47:18,663
     the best history lesson    
           I ever had.          

1646
01:47:18,665 --> 01:47:20,764
        I got a big map,        

1647
01:47:20,766 --> 01:47:25,802
    and every day, I'd get...   
      I had my crayons out.     

1648
01:47:25,804 --> 01:47:26,737
           Every day.           

1649
01:47:26,739 --> 01:47:29,906
      Certain colors meant      
       this group is here,      

1650
01:47:29,908 --> 01:47:31,708
    certain colors are this.    

1651
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:35,246
  And I kept up with that war.  

1652
01:47:35,248 --> 01:47:37,848
   I learned more about Europe  

1653
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:41,051
     than I had ever learned    
           in school.           

1654
01:47:41,053 --> 01:47:44,621
      It was very important     
      that I stay with it.      

1655
01:47:44,623 --> 01:47:49,059
            NARRATOR:           
  Aanenson and Greer exchanged  
letters every two or three days,

1656
01:47:49,061 --> 01:47:52,630
       each trying to keep      
     the other's spirits up     

1657
01:47:52,632 --> 01:47:55,332
       till they could be       
         together again.        

1658
01:47:59,571 --> 01:48:02,840
      Aanenson had survived     
    a bad fire in his plane,    

1659
01:48:02,842 --> 01:48:07,211
     was haunted by the fear    
   that he had once mistakenly  

1660
01:48:07,213 --> 01:48:09,880
        fired on British        
       or American troops,      

1661
01:48:09,882 --> 01:48:14,351
   nearly died when his plane   
    hurtled toward its target   

1662
01:48:14,353 --> 01:48:17,822
 so fast his instruments froze. 

1663
01:48:17,824 --> 01:48:18,723
     When he managed to pull    

1664
01:48:18,725 --> 01:48:21,392
         out of his dive        
     at 600 miles per hour,     

1665
01:48:21,394 --> 01:48:23,827
 blood vessels in his eyes burst

1666
01:48:23,829 --> 01:48:27,131
       and blood trickled       
         from his ears.         

1667
01:48:29,635 --> 01:48:34,104
           Meanwhile,           
     his friends kept dying.    

1668
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:45,549
            AANENSON:           
   Two of the guys that lived   
     in my tent were killed.    

1669
01:48:45,551 --> 01:48:47,551
         There was just         
      four of us in there,      

1670
01:48:47,553 --> 01:48:49,353
  and two of them were killed.  

1671
01:48:49,355 --> 01:48:52,389
        I had been listed       
      as missing in action      

1672
01:48:52,391 --> 01:48:56,427
   because I had been so badly  
      shot up I had to land     

1673
01:48:56,429 --> 01:49:01,131
     on a temporary airfield    
   closer to the front lines.   

1674
01:49:01,133 --> 01:49:06,303
 Johnny Bathurst and I, who were
the survivors in Duffy's Tavern,

1675
01:49:06,305 --> 01:49:08,005
         our tent there,        

1676
01:49:08,007 --> 01:49:12,409
  decided that we couldn't deal 
       with that anymore.       

1677
01:49:12,411 --> 01:49:16,780
   So we quit making friends,   
          new friends.          

1678
01:49:19,451 --> 01:49:21,919
            NARRATOR:           
      On December 5, 1944,      

1679
01:49:21,921 --> 01:49:24,788
        the impact of all       
     that Aanenson had seen     

1680
01:49:24,790 --> 01:49:28,359
  and experienced overcame him, 

1681
01:49:28,361 --> 01:49:31,762
  and he started writing Jackie 
 a very different kind of letter

1682
01:49:31,764 --> 01:49:35,533
          from the ones         
       he had sent before.      

1683
01:49:37,168 --> 01:49:38,803
            AANENSON:           
          "Dear Jackie,         

1684
01:49:38,805 --> 01:49:41,539
    "For the past two hours,    
  I've been sitting here alone  

1685
01:49:41,541 --> 01:49:45,676
"in my tent trying to figure out
      just what I should do     

1686
01:49:45,678 --> 01:49:49,213
     "and what I should say     
   in this letter in response   

1687
01:49:49,215 --> 01:49:53,984
    to your letters and some    
   questions you have asked."   

1688
01:49:53,986 --> 01:49:58,222
 "I have purposely not told you 
 much about my world over here, 

1689
01:49:58,224 --> 01:50:01,391
       "because I thought       
       it might upset you.      

1690
01:50:01,393 --> 01:50:03,961
     "Perhaps that has been     
           a mistake,           

1691
01:50:03,963 --> 01:50:06,631
     "so let me correct that    
           right now.           

1692
01:50:06,633 --> 01:50:10,300
  "I still doubt if you will be 
     able to comprehend it.     

1693
01:50:10,302 --> 01:50:15,139
    I don't think anyone can    
  who has not been through it." 

1694
01:50:19,511 --> 01:50:22,146
  "I live in a world of death." 

1695
01:50:23,948 --> 01:50:30,020
 "I have watched my friends die 
 in a variety of violent ways." 

1696
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:35,593
      "Sometimes, it's just     
  an engine failure on takeoff, 

1697
01:50:35,595 --> 01:50:38,329
          "resulting in         
      a violent explosion.      

1698
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:41,165
       "There's not enough      
          left to bury.         

1699
01:50:41,167 --> 01:50:44,668
          "Other times,         
      it's the deadly flak      

1700
01:50:44,670 --> 01:50:46,237
    "that tears into a plane.   

1701
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:49,606
     "If the pilot is lucky,    
       the flak kills him.      

1702
01:50:49,608 --> 01:50:52,443
     "But usually he isn't,     

1703
01:50:52,445 --> 01:50:56,380
      and he burns to death     
     as his plane spins in."    

1704
01:50:57,816 --> 01:50:59,350
       "Fire is the worst.      

1705
01:50:59,352 --> 01:51:02,820
      "In early September,      
 one of my good friends crashed 

1706
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:05,489
   "on the edge of our field.   

1707
01:51:05,491 --> 01:51:09,292
        "As he was pulled       
     from the burning plane,    

1708
01:51:09,294 --> 01:51:11,896
  the skin came off his arms."  

1709
01:51:13,364 --> 01:51:16,466
      "His face was almost      
          burned away.          

1710
01:51:16,468 --> 01:51:21,071
     "He was still conscious    
       and trying to talk.      

1711
01:51:21,073 --> 01:51:24,708
 You can't imagine the horror." 

1712
01:51:26,011 --> 01:51:29,346
      "So far, I have done      
      my duty in this war.      

1713
01:51:29,348 --> 01:51:33,751
 "I have never aborted a mission
 or failed to dive on a target, 

1714
01:51:33,753 --> 01:51:36,520
"no matter how intense the flak.

1715
01:51:36,522 --> 01:51:40,157
        "I have lived for       
    my dreams for the future.   

1716
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:43,026
    "But like everything else   
           around me,           

1717
01:51:43,028 --> 01:51:45,929
   "my dreams are dying, too.   

1718
01:51:45,931 --> 01:51:49,433
    "In spite of everything,    
   I may live through this war

     "We are all casualties.    

1723

"In the meantime, we just go on.

       "Some way, somehow,      

1725
01:52:09,688 --> 01:52:12,523
 "this will all have an ending. 

1726
01:52:12,525 --> 01:52:16,226
         Whatever it is,        
       I am ready for it."      

1727
01:52:22,233 --> 01:52:25,035
            NARRATOR:           
When he had finished his letter,

1728
01:52:25,037 --> 01:52:26,836
      Aanenson folded it up     

1729
01:52:26,838 --> 01:52:29,406
         and put it away        
       in his footlocker.       

1730
01:52:29,408 --> 01:52:32,342
         Mailing it home        
   would only have been cruel   

1731
01:52:32,344 --> 01:52:35,412
      to the woman he loved     
      and hoped to marry--      

1732
01:52:35,414 --> 01:52:40,550
    if he happened to make it   
 through what was still to come.

1733
01:52:50,095 --> 01:52:52,529
         (geese calling)        

1734

           (explosion)          

1735
01:53:06,745 --> 01:53:11,348
            NARRATOR:           
   Fighting in France with the  
  same 103rd Infantry Division  

1736
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:13,116
  in which Paul Fussell served  

1737
01:53:13,118 --> 01:53:18,922
  was a soldier with an unusual 
   name: Joseph Medicine Crow.  

1738
01:53:18,924 --> 01:53:22,626
   (man singing, drum beating)  

1739
01:53:22,628 --> 01:53:24,628
     Born on the Crow Indian    
           reservation          

1740
01:53:24,630 --> 01:53:28,298
   near Lodge Grass, Montana,   
            in 1913,            

1741
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:31,869
           he attended          
    a Baptist mission school,   

1742
01:53:31,871 --> 01:53:34,737
   was the first of his people  
    to graduate from college,   

1743
01:53:34,739 --> 01:53:38,675
and was studying for an advanced
     degree in anthropology     

1744
01:53:38,677 --> 01:53:40,877
       when the war began.      

1745
01:53:44,181 --> 01:53:47,317
   But he had also been raised  
          by his elders         

1746
01:53:47,319 --> 01:53:49,686
    in the warrior tradition.   

1747
01:53:49,688 --> 01:53:54,224
       JOE MEDICINE CROW:       
    My grandfather trained me   
        to be a warrior.        

1748
01:53:54,226 --> 01:53:59,630
      The Crow Indians were     
       so-called warlike.       

1749
01:53:59,632 --> 01:54:02,633
      They are militaristic     
         from way back.         

1750
01:54:02,635 --> 01:54:05,803
            NARRATOR:           
     The Crows had defended     
           their lands          

1751
01:54:05,805 --> 01:54:09,740
 against the Lakota and Cheyenne
         for generations        

1752
01:54:09,742 --> 01:54:12,943
    and had allied themselves   
     with the United States     

1753
01:54:12,945 --> 01:54:15,012
     during the Plains wars.    

1754
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:19,415
   One of Joe Medicine Crow's   
  grandfathers had been a scout 

1755
01:54:19,417 --> 01:54:21,285
   for George Armstrong Custer  

1756
01:54:21,287 --> 01:54:24,321
        before the Battle       
     of the Little Big Horn.    

1757
01:54:24,323 --> 01:54:31,228
       JOE MEDICINE CROW:       
    My paternal grandfather,    
 great war chief Medicine Crow, 

1758
01:54:31,230 --> 01:54:35,232
  he was considered the bravest 
      warrior of all time.      

1759
01:54:35,234 --> 01:54:44,908
  So he was also my inspiration 
   to follow in his footsteps.  

1760
01:54:44,910 --> 01:54:49,546
       He kept training me      
      to become a warrior.      

1761
01:54:49,548 --> 01:54:54,718
     In order to have status    
     in becoming a warrior,     

1762
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:59,089
    climbing up the ladder of   
   success to become a chief,   

1763
01:54:59,091 --> 01:55:06,062
        you must perform        
  certain dangerous war deeds.  

1764
01:55:06,865 --> 01:55:08,765
            NARRATOR:           
    To be considered a chief,   

1765
01:55:08,767 --> 01:55:12,002
   a Crow warrior had to touch  
         a living enemy,        

1766
01:55:12,004 --> 01:55:13,570
     take an enemy's weapon,    

1767
01:55:13,572 --> 01:55:20,777
   steal an enemy's horse, and  
  lead a victorious war party.  

1768
01:55:23,748 --> 01:55:25,983
        Whenever he went        
     into battle in Europe,     

1769
01:55:25,985 --> 01:55:28,952
  Joe Medicine Crow would paint 
     red stripes on his arms    

1770
01:55:28,954 --> 01:55:33,190
      beneath his uniform,      
  and he carried in his helmet  

1771
01:55:33,192 --> 01:55:35,392
     a sacred yellow-painted    
          eagle feather         

1772
01:55:35,394 --> 01:55:40,998
provided by a Sun Dance medicine
  man to shield him from harm.  

1773
01:55:43,100 --> 01:55:47,103
    He would need that power.   

1774
01:55:52,977 --> 01:55:57,548
He was asked to lead a seven-man
    squad carrying explosives   

1775
01:55:57,550 --> 01:55:59,283
through a wall of artillery fire

1776
01:55:59,285 --> 01:56:03,486
    to blast German positions   
    along the Siegfried Line.   

1777
01:56:16,433 --> 01:56:21,104
     Then, he helped capture    
        a German village.       

1778
01:56:30,715 --> 01:56:34,984
       JOE MEDICINE CROW:       
    We hid in a German town,    
       and I was assigned       

1779
01:56:34,986 --> 01:56:38,855
     to take the back alley     
   and come behind the Germans  

1780
01:56:38,857 --> 01:56:40,590
  who were in the main street.  

1781
01:56:40,592 --> 01:56:44,794
    So I did; I ran up there    
   and I saw an opening there,  

1782
01:56:44,796 --> 01:56:47,898
         a gate there--         
     there was a wall there.    

1783
01:56:47,900 --> 01:56:52,602
 So I ran up there and a German 
   soldier was running there.   

1784
01:56:52,604 --> 01:56:55,872
  We bumped heads... (chuckles) 

1785
01:56:55,874 --> 01:57:02,145
 So I swung my rifle and knocked
    his rifle off his hands.    

1786
01:57:02,147 --> 01:57:03,113
     There he was standing.     

1787
01:57:03,115 --> 01:57:05,548
         All I had to do        
      was pull the trigger.     

1788
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:11,187
   But for some reason, I put   
 my gun down and tore into him. 

1789
01:57:11,189 --> 01:57:14,223
  Then we had it out, you know. 

1790
01:57:14,225 --> 01:57:17,894
         He had me down,        
      but I turned him over     

1791
01:57:17,896 --> 01:57:23,733
 and grabbed him by the throat, 
            you know.           

1792
01:57:23,735 --> 01:57:27,003
    I was ready to kill him.    

1793
01:57:27,005 --> 01:57:34,744
   Then, his last words were,   
          "Mama, mama."         

1794
01:57:34,746 --> 01:57:39,950
 When he said that word, "Mama,"
         opened my ears.        

1795
01:57:39,952 --> 01:57:43,654
          I let him go.         

1796
01:57:43,656 --> 01:57:47,891
            NARRATOR:           
    Without quite meaning to,   
 Joe Medicine Crow had performed

1797
01:57:47,893 --> 01:57:51,494
      three out of the four     
 traditional war deeds he needed

1798
01:57:51,496 --> 01:57:55,999
      to become a war chief     
      like his grandfather.     

1799
01:57:56,001 --> 01:57:59,669
     He had led a successful    
           war party;           

1800
01:57:59,671 --> 01:58:05,976
 he had touched an enemy warrior
   and taken away his weapon.   

1801
01:58:05,978 --> 01:58:10,680
     The only thing left was    
     to capture some horses.    

1802
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:15,552
  I was a scout for my company. 

1803
01:58:15,554 --> 01:58:19,823
  We were going along the road  
     on top of the mountain,    

1804
01:58:19,825 --> 01:58:21,090
         small mountain.        

1805
01:58:21,092 --> 01:58:22,860
 And I was ahead of my company, 

1806
01:58:22,862 --> 01:58:27,297
      and I caught up with      
     some horseback riders,     

1807
01:58:27,299 --> 01:58:29,533
   and I had my field glasses.  

1808
01:58:29,535 --> 01:58:32,035
  They were Germans, you know,  
       so I followed them.      

1809
01:58:32,037 --> 01:58:36,239
            NARRATOR:           
      The Germans took over     
          a farmhouse.          

1810
01:58:36,241 --> 01:58:42,145
    The horses were pastured    
    outside, some 50 of them.   

1811
01:58:44,014 --> 01:58:46,650
       JOE MEDICINE CROW:       
So we surrounded the place there

1812
01:58:46,652 --> 01:58:50,587
   and we were going to attack  
      early in the morning.     

1813
01:58:50,589 --> 01:58:54,857
     So I was sitting there     
          with a C.O.,          

1814
01:58:54,859 --> 01:58:57,260
       and, uh, we waited.      

1815
01:58:57,262 --> 01:59:01,431
    Finally, towards morning,   
       I said, "Captain."       

1816
01:59:01,433 --> 01:59:03,933
    I said, "I have an idea."   

1817
01:59:03,935 --> 01:59:09,439
     I said, "If you give me    
  five minutes before jump-off, 

1818
01:59:09,441 --> 01:59:10,974
  I'll stampede their horses."  

1819
01:59:10,976 --> 01:59:15,178
      So we went in there,      
        opened that gate.       

1820
01:59:15,180 --> 01:59:19,115
     There were some guards     
    sitting in a shed there,    

1821
01:59:19,117 --> 01:59:23,420
     so I went behind there     
         and got a horse        

1822
01:59:23,422 --> 01:59:25,855
    and I put my little rope,   

1823
01:59:25,857 --> 01:59:29,259
made an Indian bridle, you know,
       double half hitch.       

1824
01:59:29,261 --> 01:59:33,130
   I got on it and I stampeded  
    the horses out of there.    

1825
01:59:33,132 --> 01:59:37,200
    So I headed out and then,   
         soon as I left,        

1826
01:59:37,202 --> 01:59:41,170
  why, they... they opened fire 
           over there.          

1827
01:59:48,179 --> 01:59:49,112
         But I took off.        

1828
01:59:49,114 --> 01:59:54,985
       So, these were not       
        ordinary horses.        

1829
01:59:54,987 --> 01:59:57,154
      And I looked at them.     

1830
01:59:57,156 --> 01:59:58,822
      They were beautiful.      

1831
01:59:58,824 --> 02:00:03,359
    And the one I was riding    
   was a sorrel with a blaze.   

1832
02:00:03,361 --> 02:00:05,228
     So I felt pretty good.     

1833
02:00:05,230 --> 02:00:06,296
       So I looked around.      

1834
02:00:06,298 --> 02:00:10,733
   Pretty soon, I sang a song,  
            you know.           

1835
02:00:10,735 --> 02:00:13,002
          Praise song.          

1836
02:00:13,004 --> 02:00:37,527
   (singing in Crow language)   

1837
02:00:39,096 --> 02:00:43,433
            NARRATOR:           
     When Joe Medicine Crow     
  returned home after the war,  

1838
02:00:43,435 --> 02:00:48,070
   a tribal ceremony was held   
         to welcome him.        

1839
02:00:50,307 --> 02:00:57,814
       JOE MEDICINE CROW:       
  The old elders wanted to know 
      what... my war deeds.     

1840
02:00:57,816 --> 02:01:00,784
     And I started thinking     
       about it, you know,      

1841
02:01:00,786 --> 02:01:04,621
  and I mentioned those horses. 

1842
02:01:06,290 --> 02:01:11,194
       "You have completed      
        the four deeds."        

1843
02:01:12,897 --> 02:01:16,232
 Well, I never thought about it.

1844
02:01:16,234 --> 02:01:23,773
So I guess you're looking at the
  last Plains Indian war chief.
