He is the owner of this number.

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,130
I will try hard and practice to be a great artist. Thank you.

[He's finally on stage today]

10
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:52,050
[This debut song is a sentimental ballad that accumulated everything they practiced]

11

[Their debut song shined through their captivating voices]

14
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:17,930
2AM's Jo Kwon became a legend through his success of enduring 2,567 days as a trainee.

15
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,530
- We're proud.
 - It's been 8 years?

16
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,830
When I'm on variety or talk shows...

17
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,020
People tell me to stop talking about my days as a trainee.

18
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,790
Many are sick of hearing it.

19
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,960
There's no other choice since I spent my teens as a trainee...

20
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,250
- That's a third of your life.
 - That's all I have to say.

21
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,780
I have no memories of my school days.

22
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,060
I had my first audition in the 6th grade.

23
00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:00,260
I never imagined it would take this long until I debuted.

24
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,090
You waited 8 years.

25
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,900
Now JYP tells you to get ready for your debut.

26
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,820
How did he tell you that?

27
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,400
He sent me a text.

28
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,090
Today is the 2,567th day you were a trainee.

29
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:25,450
He was a long-term JYP trainee that stayed the longest at 2,567 days.

30
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,770
He finally got to stand on the stage he dreamed of.

31
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,970
Jo Kwon silently overcame those 8 years.

32
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,920
He led 2AM as the leader with 3 other members.

33
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,560
Jo Kwon wasn't the only one who desperately wanted to be on stage.

34
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,350
They finished their first broadcast of their debut song "This Song" in tears.

35
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,750
They were moved to tears.

36
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,420
What can they exchange this feeling for?

37
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,260
The one who shed the most tears was Jo Kwon.

38
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:33,020
He can't believe this moment since he was a trainee for 8 long years.

39
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,500
This was the stage I dreamt and waited for until now.

40
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:44,080
Since I practiced under the burden and expectation of debuting.

41
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,050
Those 8 years seemed short when I was on stage.

42
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,930
I cried a lot because I was moved and felt proud.

43
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,600
"I have nothing to give but this song."

44
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,780
The voice and lyrics are sad.

45
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,040
It's a special song that only 2AM can present.

46
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,390
"This Song" is special as a collaborative stage.

47
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,540
He performed with Sunye, a fellow JYP trainee.

48
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:48,670
It must have been lovely to be in the spotlight with a friend.

49
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,380
[Jo Kwon spent time as a trainee for a long time]

50
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,180
[Sunye of Wonder Girls is a fellow labelmate and close friend]

51
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,660
[He wanted to show his gratitude to her through this song]

52
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:46,210
This heart-filled song gained much interest as it was released.

53
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,760
People paid attention to something else other than their song.

54
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:07,020
[Their Own Keyword]

55
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,970
[Kkap]

56
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:14,230
[A word describing Jo Kwon's one of a kind character]

57
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,880
He left a strong impression at a surprise performance.

58
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,280
This is how his "kkap" character was born and left a mark in idol history.

59
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:36,520
We did a special called "Wonder Boys" on Inkigayo's 500th episode.

60
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,890
There was a Jo Kwon crisis.

61
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,120
On the internet?

62
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,400
Many fans said that was the day "Kkap Kwon" was born.

63
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:53,610
There's this part in one of Wonder Girls' songs.

64
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,320
I expressed those emotions well.

65
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,940
[He sure is Kkap Kwon]

66
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,330
[Wonder Girls parody during Inkigayo's 500th special]

67
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,980
[This is how Kkap Kwon was born]

68
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:21,930
Only that part was made into an animated GIF and spread online.

69
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,910
JYP called me right away.

70
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,890
"Kwon, stop doing that."

71
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,240
"You shouldn't do that since you're a ballad singer."

72
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,470
The other members told me, "How can we sing ballads now because of you?"

73
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:45,300
You know Jo Kwon's Kkap Kwon dances on various programs...

74
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,780
I happened to watch that on television and was surprised.

75
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,090
There's an image when I create a group. The four of them are singing like this.

76
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,110
But he's doing such a dance with such expressions.

77
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,820
He didn't just dance but his expressions were...

78
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,700
I was really surprised and called him.

79
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,360
I scolded him, "What are you doing? You're a ballad singer."

80
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,200
- You did?
 - Yes.

81
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,480
He didn't do it in one program but started doing it again.

82
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,220
Jo Kwon's instinct "kkap" goes against JYP's dislikes.

83
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,840
Didn't you sense anything when you casted him?

84
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,930
Not at all because he was in elementary school.

85
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:40,170
He was unique at the audition and did Lee Jung-hyun's "Come On."

86
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,660
But he went more crazy than the original artist.

87
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,190
We agreed that he can do such dances but behave himself inbetween.

88
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,820
Inbetween?

89
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:06,360
To be cautious inbetween when he does such dances.

90
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,260
We get hooked the more we see it. I guess JYP has given up on it.

91
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,120
[Jo Kwon is rising as a agitating woman!]

92
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,270
[Is my mascara okay?]

93
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,500
[What do we do with them...]

94
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,510
Kkap Kwon comes out anywhere. How can he not stand out?

95
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,160
[If you're going to shake, you should shake like this]

96
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,250
[My son's the best!]

97
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,640
He even made his own "Kkap" awards.

98
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,550
You prepared them?

99
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,580
[Kkap Kwon Best 3 Wonder Kkap Kwon!]

100
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,480
- It's this picture.
 - When was that?

101
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,580
We parodied the Wonder Girls as Wonder Boys once.

102
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,960
I made this expression and this was the screen capture.

103
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:02,700
This is beyond "kkap" and close to horror.

104
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,490
Can you make that face?

105
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,370
[Red sun!]

106
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,810
[Kkap Kwon Best 2 Director Jo!]

107
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,180
JYP artists had a poster shoot for the year-end concert.

108
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,010
JYP was supposed to be here.

109
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,630
But I'm here and he's there.

110
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,740
JYP was hard on me at first.

111
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,490
"Why are you trying to be funny? You're a ballad singer."

112
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,850
He said a lot of things and I was scolded.

113
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,170
But now he goes around saying good things about me.

114
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,950
How did he change?

115
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,770
I'm known as Director Jo at the agency now.

116
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,080
Can you do a similar pose if a picture is taken now?

117
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,670
Another pose. One, two, three!

118
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,890
[His "kkap" instincts]

119
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,700
Let's stop.

120

[Kkap Best 1]

122
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,530
We parodied Brown Eyed Girls as Dirty Eyed Girls...

123
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,060
This was during the filming of our music video.

124
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,320
I look similar to a character in a well-known Japanese comic.

125
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,900
- It's the same.
 - It really is.

126
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,050
- It does look the same.
 - It is similar.

127
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:37,400
I'll make a prediction. It's been a year since he rose as "Kkap Kwon."

128
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,240
This will last about 5 years.

129
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,080
What is your secret?

130
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,540
- I'll do a cam version.
 - Alright. Make it cute.

131
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,510
That's a nice pose.

132

That's Jo Kwon for you.

133
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:03,540
He became big with "kkap." How did he hold this in for 2,567 days?

134
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,460
Let's wait and see this one of a kind character.

We can't leave out Changmin's voice from 2AM.

140
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,910
He drew attention not only with his excellent voice but also his nickname.

141
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,600
It's ex-soldier idol, an idol who finished his military service.

142
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:54,730
During the early days of my debut, I was known as ex-soldier idol.

143
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,820
You know those that completed their military service.

144
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,760
I qualified for the police marching band.

145
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,760
During my military service, MBC came to film.

146
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,620
I had a bad case of the flu and was sleeping upstairs.

147
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,090
I was resting when the commander came in.

148
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,940
"Changmin, I think you should go down and sing."

149
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,360
When I said I needed to rest...

150

He said, "Do you want a special leave?"

151
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,780

Yes!

155
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,580
This is being revealed for the first time.

156

He shows off his showmanship by using the right props.

165
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,140
His talents were exceptional since his time in the military.

166
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,380
I was asked to go to an audition.

167
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:41,940
It was a JYP audition and I said I'll go since I like JYP's songs.

168
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,770
I went to the audition but I didn't get news of the results.

169
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,580
I was discharged from the military without knowing the audition results.

170
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,850
I hung out with my friends all night and received a call the next day.

171
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,750
I received a call saying, "Come to JYPE and sign the contract."

172
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:08,600
The day after my discharge, I went to JYPE and...

173
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,990
He went to the audition during his leave and signed the contract after discharge.

174
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,210
How he became a singer is also extraordinary.

175
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:21,720
He was also active in the group Homme with Lee Hyun of 8Eight.

176
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,300
What made you to be in a group together.

177
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:56,700
I put this song aside because there were some heavy parts for me to sing alone.

178
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,370
I was suggested to sing with Changmin and I thought that would be great.

179
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,940
But how he entered this group was different.

180
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,130
He heard the song first...

181
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,000
You're younger than him?

182
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,490
Yes, I'm 3 years younger.

183
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:17,580
What is this feeling?

184
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,180
I didn't say anything but I think we're thinking the same thing.

185
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:27,330
Changmin is younger than Lee Hyun who is currently in the military.

186
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,020
Don't be upset. I wasn't surprised.

187
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:37,670
He stood out since there weren't many ex-soldier idols at the time.

188
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,390
Good thing you served early on.

189
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,440
This is a bonus.

190
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,370
Including myself, we made a military version of this song.

191
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,960
[Disciplined moves!]

192
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,420
[A resounding voice!]

193
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,040
[They prepared a military version of a girl group's song!]

194
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,000
What's the MND's time?

195
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,730
[Tick tock, tick tock the time just flies]

196
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,680
[Radiating masculine appeal]

197
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,280
Hey, mister! What's your name?

198
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,400
Public service worker Kim Dong-wan!

199
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,640
He's a public service worker? Are you by any chance also...

200
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,170
- I'm not Pyo In-bong!
 - I see you're not.

201
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,460
[1, 2, 3, 4! 1, 2, 3, 4!]

202
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,940
I was sleeping in the dorm and Seulong said we got a new member.

203
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,780
- I ran in with the notebook.
 - But he was laughing.

204
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,770
His picture was posted!

205
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,070
It was a clip of him during the audition.

206
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:04,350
"We got a new member but I'm at a loss for words."

207
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,810
What's the reason?

208
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:13,310
I got up from bed and the two of us didn't say anything for 5 minutes.

209
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,600
"Is he a vocal trainer?"

210
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,600
His looks made us think that he'll sing well.

211
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,440
I mean, he is an idol.

212
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,470
We thought he would be skilled because he did sing well.

213
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:34,330
That's what we thought. He had spots on his face and was just discharged.

214
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,930
So he wouldn't have been picked if it wasn't for his singing?

215
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:42,510
Lookism needs to be eradicated from Korea.

216
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,770
What's your wish?

217
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,050
I want my mouth to go in!

218
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,190
Just live as you are.

219
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:57,410
He's at ease for being discharged but feels uncomfortable of his looks.

220
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,680
I thought he took my advice...

221
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,730
But recently his skills and looks were upgraded.

222
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,790
You were recognized for your singing in the group 2AM.

223
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,230
Is there something else you want to be known for?

224
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,320
- Be honest?
 - Yes.

225
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,460
[Deep in thought]

226
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,430
For my looks...

227
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:32,490
He wants to be known for his looks. Guess he was a bright character.

228
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,670
I wonder what it feels like for people to say you look good.

229
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,720
You guys hear that.

[2AM's Music]

231
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,570
2AM drew attention with various activities along with their popular debut song.

232
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,940
They released their 2nd single in 2009 after their debut.

233
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:15,060
They presented their own ballad with "Confession of a Friend."

234
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,540
[A beautiful harmony stands out with powerful singing and masculine appeal]

235
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:46,390
[A ballad containing the regret of not becoming lovers from being friends]

236
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:56,620
[They're more stronger and masculine since their debut and their harmony stands out]

237
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:54,140
In 2010, their special ballad potential was unleashed in their 1st mini-album.

238
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,540
"Even If I Die I Can't Let You Go" was made by producer Bang Si-hyuk.

239
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,460
[This song was born from the meeting of 2AM and producer Bang Si-hyuk]

240
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,090
[It's a hybrid ballad with refined sounds and sentimental vocals]

241
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,770
[To keep the balance between the concept of ballads and idols...]

242
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,380
[Electronic sounds were used in this ballad]

243
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:37,450
[The static-like sound in the chorus is unique and made with a synthesizer]

244
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,470
[It was intentionally given such a sound]

245
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,450
[It topped various music charts with its release]

246
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,480
[Not only did they take first on broadcast...]

247
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,670
[They received the grand prize at the year-end awards]

248
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,790
- How do you feel?
 - Yes, how do you feel?

249
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:23,040
First of all, I would like to thank my dad and our manager.

250
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,450
I thank JYP who's in the US right now and Young-kwon.

251
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,610
We also thank Mr. Yang.

252
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:37,300
Kwon is crying right now... Hey, say something.

253
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,220
Thank you. I thank God, my parents...

254

Thank you everyone. We'll do our best.

I love you mom and dad! Thank you God!

256
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,650
Not only did they get their first trophy with this song...

257
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,990
But they also received the grand prize at the 2010 Golden Disk Awards.

258
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,150
They reached the top they dreamed of with their own ballads.

259
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:43,060
They released their first full-length album in the second half of 2010.

260
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:48,930
They released double title tracks and showed strong as the best group in ballads.

261
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,620
[A ballad describing the pain and loneliness of breaking up]

262

[This song describes the pain and loneliness of breaking up]

263

00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,390
[When "Even If I Die I Can't Let You Go" was released, they worked on this song]

265
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:33,120
[It was decided a long time ago to be the title track of their 1st full-length album]

266
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,120
[Their looks also matured with suits that went with the song]

267
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,450
[The unique melody that's strongly attractive went with their voices]

268
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,820
[Due to the song's appeal...]

269
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,890
[Producer Bang Si-hyuk gave much thought on the title track and decided to go double]

270
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:10,880
[Before its release, a teaser of the members shedding tears attracted attention]

271
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,890
They didn't sing only quiet ballads.

272
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:11,290
They've also transformed with fast tempo songs.

273
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,980

[The fans' request and overwhelming support made this their 2nd single]

278
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:49,080
Their most shocking performance was when they danced in "I Was Wrong."

279
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,100
Their moves changed a lot in the past two years.

280
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,750

282
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,610
[Their attempt on acting in the song's music drama also drew attention]

283
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:52,740
Before you see the dance, you need to compare our expressions.

284
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,580
The biggest change is our expressions in the song.

285
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,000
That freshness from our 1st album.

286
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,870
I'll go down and watch.

Let's see "I Was Wrong."

288
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,130
Expression is as important as the moves.

289
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,700
But be careful of getting screen captured.

290
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,280
We can't do anything about the ones that were already done.

291
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,920
We can't leave out the powerful Kkap Kwon dance for this song.

292
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,000
We'll excuse ourselves and become his shadow.

We're curious of their special stage since they can sing various genres.

He said his ideal woman and only love is Shin Mina.

What did you do afterwards?

313
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:25,260
- We had a get-together.
 - Where?

314
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,940
At a restaurant serving pork belly.

You want noodles if you eat pork belly?

There's a reason.

321
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,940
Boom? You always eat noodles after eating pork belly, right?

322
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,710
I do.

00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:51,190
- And what noodles?
 - Rice noodles.

324

You were with someone at a rice noodle restaurant around 3 AM.

325
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,000
And a lot of people know because of the articles.

326
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,140
Instead of denying it, it's now time for you to be honest.

Who did you meet at that restaurant at 3 AM?

328

It was Sohee, my labelmate.

- Park Ji-yoon?
 - Yes?

If you meet someone at 3 AM... it's not 2 or 4 but 3 AM...

332
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,050
According to experience, what feelings might you have to meet at that time?

333
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:29,100
You have to like that person.

334
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,170

00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,760
[Boom was taken aback]

338
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:52,340
You're close with Sohee but that picture spread dating rumors.

339
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:58,880
It could have developed into a relationship or it did not.

340
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,650
What happened?

341
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,680
Nothing... happened.

342
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,190
Don't stutter.

343
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,030
Sohee was the one in Seulong's dating rumors.

344
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:11,090
But there's someone else that Seulong likes.

345
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,900
It's Shin Mina.

346
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:17,130
He has her ID picture.

347
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:18,650
[It's not like he'll get documents in her place...]

348
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,100
You're afraid of this one person in Korea?

349
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,380
Who is that?

350
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:28,470
That is Shin Mina.

351
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:31,080
[He fears her the most?]

352
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,100
You're afraid of her?

353
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,960
I get nervous.

354
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:48,490
It's been made public a few times that his ideal woman is Shin Mina.

355
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:49,860
Does your family know?

356
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:51,100
[She had heard about it]

357
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,690
[He can't look at her because his heart feels like exploding]

358
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,300
[This beast idol falls before love!]

359
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,300
Idols' ideal types are... Kyu-jong likes Oh Se-jung...

360
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:11,650
It's really big news that Seulong likes Shin Mina.

361
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:16,740
This is an unexpected competitor.

362
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,360
I beg you to not turn around.

363
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:23,730
Really?

364
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:27,480
I get the goosebumps all over my body.

365
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,460
What happens if she turns around?

366
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,770
[Eyes are tightly shut]

367
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,850
[Please... don't look...]

368
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:42,070
[Bashful nine-tailed fox]

369
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,040
[Singing "Nothing Better" for her]

370
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:51,450
[I'm nervous]

371
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,360
[Don't be nervous...]

372
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,700
[He was her fan for 10 years]

373
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,150
[He's actually singing before her...]

374
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,400
[He's so nervous he can't even look at her...]

375
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:22,910
[Seems like everyone's jealous]

376
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,620
[His dream was to be on television with her someday]

377
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:50,010
[Should I look or not?]

378
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,560
[He doesn't have the courage to look at her yet...]

379
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,100
Look at her at least once!

380
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,150
[He finally looked at her!]

381
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:05,400
[A dreamlike second...]

382
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:10,660
[His dream came true!]

383
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:20,800
[A pure heart of a fan who liked her for 10 years...]

384
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:31,530
That's it.

385
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,550
[A song of love that stirs the heart...]

386
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:40,160
We acknowledge his love for her.

387
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,480
Jinwoon also made a sudden confession.

388
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,250
Can you tell us who you like?

389
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,250
Of course.

390
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:49,740
It's Seohyun.

391
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,280
- Seohyun?
 - Yes.

392
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,760
- Isn't she cute?
 - I get nervous.

393
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:59,230
We met in the hall and I turned and ran away because I'm her fan.

394
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,270
- Really?
 - Yes.

395
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,920
You're so innocent.

396
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,570
That's right!

397
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:06,500
My friend... Seohyun of Girls' Generation...

398
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,340
Something to eat?

399
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,740
Seohyun of Girls' Generation?

400
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,680
She asked to eat together before I left so we had breakfast.

401
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,620
She gave me vitamins after breakfast.

402
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,300
[She gave him vitamins as a gift?]

403
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:20,500
She gave me these.

404
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,600
[That's a letter by Seohyun!]

405
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,660
Seohyun of Girls' Generation?

406
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:31,950
Vitamins from Seohyun? That itself is vitamin.

407
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:36,600
But he has another room in his heart and that's for Lee Min-jung.

408
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:41,010
I really like Lee Min-jung.

409
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:44,160
- Lee Min-jung?
 - I really like her.

410
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,930
You know the contact lens commercial she's in?

411
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:52,700
"Giving up for health." It drives me nuts. Her eyes are so pretty.

412
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:59,780
He wants poor vision just to put on those contacts.

413
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,060
Even when you see the ad poster?

414
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:10,490
I love it, but she came to our concert.

415
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:11,440
How?

416
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,410
We got acquainted after appearing in a one-act drama together.

417
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,720
I invited her and she was in the waiting room.

418
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,490
That's when he got really nervous.

419
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,190
I wanted to take a picture with her since she was there.

420
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:32,040
I was pacing up and down to get a picture taken...

421
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,450
But I couldn't ask her to take a picture with her.

422
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:38,240
I was so nervous that I hid in the dressing room.

423
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,780
I didn't do anything wrong but I was trembling as I hid.

424
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,430
I thought, "I should act like a man, greet her and get a picture taken."

425
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:50,240
But we could see him because he's tall.

426
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,150
That's even stranger.

427
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,110
Didn't Lee Seung-gi shoot many commercials with Lee Min-jung?

428
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,100
I took many pictures with her.

429
00:55:58,030 --> 00:55:59,810
[I'm friends with her]

430
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:02,030
Jealous?

431
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,310
[Really jealous]

432
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,010
- I could make arrangements.
 - You can do that?

433
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,840
I got acquainted with her and I meet her on the set so...

434
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,830
- It's okay.
 - Why?

435
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,810
[He's holding on to his pride...]

436
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:25,700
Is Lee Min-jung the only one for you? Wasn't Kang So-ra...

437
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,870
He's currently shooting a drama with her.

438
00:56:28,870 --> 00:56:29,910
Yes I am.

439
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:32,260
Leeteuk has a long face.

440
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,440
[Leeteuk and Kang So-ra are newlyweds]

441
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,360
Didn't you get a divorce?

442
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,420
The station is on a strike.

443
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:46,010
[They've been separated...]

444
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:48,500
[They want to see each other but can't]

445
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,400
You can't meet during a strike.

446
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,080
[Let us love each other again]

447
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,120
[That cracks us up]

448
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,320
It's a strike. We didn't break off our engagement.

449
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,870
Would you pick Kang So-ra over Lee Min-jung?

450
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:06,340
You're going on a trip.

451
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,780
- A trip.
 - A trip?

452
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,670
- Planned?
 - On impulse.

453
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:13,240
You pick them up in front of their house.

454
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:16,190
- Whose house is it?
 - He's into it.

455
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:19,820
He just gets into it whatever it is.

456
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:22,710
The trunk is filled with food and you depart.

457
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,080
- Is there a mat?
 - Of course.

458
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,720
- You call, "Come out."
 - Come out?

459
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,430
Who steps out of the door?

460
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:30,190
- Whose house is it?
 - Who is it?

461
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,170
I choose Lee Min-jung.

462
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:33,300
[Me?]

463
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,030
- I'll be straightforward.
 - Alright, shoot it.

464
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,380
Are you close with Lee Min-jung?

465
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,510
- You like her, right?
 - I'm jealous.

466
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:41,670
You should create an occasion for him if you know that.

467
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:42,690
I'm jealous.

468
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:50,230
I did during the concert but it was Jo Kwon who took pictures.

469
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:53,340
And Jinwoon was hiding in the dressing room.

470
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,380
I was embarassed.

471
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:58,600
Jinwoon was shy even though the members made an effort.

472
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,240
Does she know?

473
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,710
Yes, she does.

474
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:04,760
We acknowledge that he likes Lee Min-jung.

475
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,580
Let's listen to their hypothetical proposal song.

476
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:13,470
We always make idols do a hypothetical proposal.

477
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:19,500
Since I'm the youngest, I'll make it cute.

478
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:28,970
I'll always make this pretty smile if you'll go out with me. I'm sorry.

479
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,890
No, it was cute.

480
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,320
Can we change to a three member group?

481
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,390
Next?

482
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:46,380
I'll do a short song with some aegyo.

483
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:49,850
- Then go to the front...
 - But I can't do it alone.

484
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:51,580
The members have to help.

485
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:55,630
- Are you going to do that?
 - We play around like this.

486
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:22,840
I'll sing after speaking in a Busan dialect.

487
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,000
Fine.

488
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,830
Jung-eun?

489
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:32,130
- I have something to say.
 - What is it?

490
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:33,900
Please have my child.

491
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,290
I would've regretted it if 2AM didn't do this.

492
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:32,270
[They Shine Alone and Together]

493
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:36,980
They are all exceptional singers and do well on their own as well.

494
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,140
They each went solo and had their own projects.

495
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:51,280
[Seulong]

496
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:55,330
Seulong went on stage first not as 2AM but as a duet.

497
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:59,250
He did a surprise colloboration with IU singing "Nagging."

498
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:15,820
[A song about nagging lovely to one's lover]

499
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,970
[IU and Seulong's sweet harmony stood out]

500
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:25,100
[Seulong was strongly recommended by the staff to be in a duet with IU]

501
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,960
[This is his first duet showing off a bright and cheerful voice]

502
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:34,210
But IU is interested in another 2AM member.

503
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:36,700
Who is your ideal type if you have to choose?

504
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:37,970
- Among the four?
 - Yes.

505
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:45,250
Seulong looked cool when I didn't really meet them that much.

506
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,930
He's tall and like a model.

507
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,980
- His looks are not ordinary.
 - He's really good-looking.

508
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:56,180
But after working together, Jinwoon looked cool.

509
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:59,500
- Me?
 - You do it.

510
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,420
- Thank you.
 - Take my place.

511
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:04,360
Seulong is sulking. What's cool about him?

512
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,040
When he smiles.

513
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,270
- Thank you.
 - When his eyes disappear?

514
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:12,270
I feel uncomfortable being in the middle.

515
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:16,310
Jinwoon, did you create another space in your heart?

516
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:19,660
And Changmin? You lost if you feel jealous.

517
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:30,720
[Changmin]

518
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,590
Please introduce yourselves.

519
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:37,110
- I'm Lee Hyun of 8Eight.
 - I'm Changmin of 2AM.

520
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:41,210
We have to introduce in our project name too.

521
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:43,670
Hi, we're Homme.

522
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,990
Changmin was part of Homme with Lee Hyun of 8Eight.

523
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:54,860
Songs with their unique voices were born as they are great vocalists.

524
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:06,010
[Two great vocalists, Changmin and Lee Hyun, gave birth to...]

525
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,360
[Bang Si-hyuk's first project (Homme by Hitman Bang)]

526
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,700
[This is Homme's first single]

527
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,980
[It's a hybrid rock with a cool guitar and drum sounds]

528
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,270
[The lyrics calmly describe the feeling after breaking up]

529
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:20,220
[Their uniquely cool voices were memorable]

530
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:29,770
He gave off a masculine appeal different from when he's in 2AM.

531
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,310
["Man Should Laugh" is the title track of their first mini-album for summer]

532
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:11,550
[A song mixing American style rock with sweet synthpop]

533
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:14,320
[This was released for summer like their first single]

534
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,530
[Their voices stand out and make us feel the coolness]

535
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:36,380
[Jo Kwon]

536
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:41,510
Jo Kwon released his first solo album in 2012 with a shocking performance.

537
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:44,470
He showed off his talents.

538
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:58,030
[His uniquely bright energy can be felt in this electronic dance song]

539
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:00,380
[Music, appearances, performance, and even the music video]

540
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:05,980
[Many different things were shown in the title track of his first solo album]

541
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:12,060
[His own bouncy electronic dance song was made collaborating with artists from abroad]

542
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,970
[The kitsch stage outfits and album jacket utilizing pop art were memorable]

543
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:59,600
He wore appalling high heels and did a performance only he can do.

544
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:13,480
[There's a wild feel to this song like the title]

545
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,110
[This song competed with the title track to the end]

546
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:19,410
[The vocal effect is as if it's echoing from a cave]

547
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:23,380
[The intense lyrics alluding himself to an animal stood out]

548
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:12,320
You gave a warning to your members?

549
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:17,460
It's been 4 years as I was a part of 2AM.

550
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,070
We didn't have any big fights, and if we did, we resolved it.

551
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:27,480
But I was really hurt by them this time and want to talk about it.

552
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:28,930
You have to let go of that.

553
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:33,830
You'll feel light if you do it in public.

554
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:40,780
I was filming my solo music video for about 3 days without sleep.

555
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:45,210
When a music video or album jacket is being shot...

556
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:49,870
Labelmates will sometimes come for support.

557
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:58,170
The other members come to support when one of them is doing a solo.

558
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:04,140
My members didn't come on the first day of filming.

559
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:10,690
On the second day, 2PM's Wooyoung was also filming a music video.

560
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:15,000
I asked him, "Did your members stop by?"

561
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,700
He said they already came and left.

562
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,740
[Suddenly we're starting to compare them to 2AM!]

563
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:24,730
I felt sad and went to the restroom to pick my nose...

564
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:30,240
These black things came out due to the dust and I was welling up with tears.

565
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:35,350
I don't know why but I felt really sad.

566
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:40,760
On the last day, filming ended at 9 in the morning.

567
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,410
Seulong texted me, "How's filming?"

568
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:49,450
I replied, "It's going well," thinking that he's coming.

569
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:53,270
He replied, "Good luck. I'm tired and going to sleep."

570
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:55,400
[Oh you poor thing]

571
01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:03,770
I was really sad and didn't even want to send an emoticon.

572
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:06,690
So I texted "alright" with a tilde.

573
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:09,250
At first I didn't want to put in the tilde.

574
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:10,310
You might look timid without it.

575
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:13,870
There's a difference with and without a tilde.

576
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:15,810
He might think he's sulking without that tilde.

577
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:18,970
The feeling is different.

578
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:25,480
I was really sad and thought this feeling won't go away.

579
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:30,710
So I sent another text even to Changmin and Jinwoon.

580
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:36,990
I texted, "Today's the last day of filming. How's everyone?"

581
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:38,770
That's weird.

582
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:44,820
"Wooyoung is also filming today and all his members came and left."

583
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:48,950
- You were straightforward.
 - That was around 5 AM.

584
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:51,760
Changmin wakes up at that time.

585
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:56,580
I got 5-6 texts from him.

586
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,740
I felt that they were going to come.

587
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:02,950
- Like a surprise?
 - A surprise party?

588
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:07,700
- Something like a hidden camera.
 - They're pretending not to know.

589
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,350
Thinking they will appear from somewhere but where?

590
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:11,690
That's right.

591
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:19,170
It felt they will walk out of there or wait in the waiting room.

592
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:21,810
They didn't come at all.

593
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:23,100
[Oh my!]

594
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,440
Do they know you're coming on this show?

595
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,760
Yes, but they don't know I'm talking about this.

596
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:29,040
They don't?

597
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,480
So we prepared...

598
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,750
[Prepared?]

599
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:37,150
Since this is Jo Kwon's first solo album and variety show appearance...

600
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:41,290
We have a special corner. Music please!

601
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,740
[I miss you to death]

602
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:48,040
[Explosive acting!]

603
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:58,580
Someone is here in the studio.

604
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:04,440
It's the one you want to see the most. Who is it?

605
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,980
My mom.

606
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:09,850
[Unexpected answer!]

607
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:14,200
[Do they call his mom?]

608
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,420
Anyone else?

609
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,490
2AM members!

610
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:22,250
You want to see them? Shout out to them!

611
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,730
- I miss 2AM!
 - Louder!

612
01:13:24,730 --> 01:13:26,360
I miss you!

613
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:38,230
[Surprise appearance by 2AM's Jinwoon!]

614
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,250
[The youngest member came in a heartbeat for Jo Kwon!]

615
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:49,440
Oh my! I'm about to cry!

616
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,250
[He cries as soon as he sees Jinwoon!]

617
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:00,790
[He's wailing!]

618
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:04,270
[He was really hurt]

619
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:06,440
[People might think a separated family reunited...]

620
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,760
[Don't cry!]

621
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:14,610
Jinwoon appeared for Jo Kwon who was feeling sad. He was touched.

622
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:25,960
[Jinwoon]

623
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:33,160
It's known that Jinwoon didn't have any solo activities unlike the other members.

624
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:38,620
Jo Kwon was busy in sitcoms and variety shows...

625
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:47,960
Seulong was in a duet with IU, something that I wanted to do.

626
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:51,460
I even believed in Changmin...

627
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:53,690
Why is it "even" for me?

628
01:14:54,030 --> 01:15:01,070
It's okay because he was in a duet with Lee Hyun of 8Eight.

629
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:04,260
I'm the only one without a schedule.

630
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:08,300
But aren't you the busiest now?

631
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:09,750
Oh! Now?

632
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:12,990
Now...

633
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:14,340
This is about you!

634
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,530
[The one with the "top star" disease is Jinwoon?]

635
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:22,650
It's actually about me.

636
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:25,840
[The one with the "top star" disease is Jinwoon!]

637
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:31,740
I started off with a solo album releasing first and second albums.

638
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:38,200
I played the lead in "Dream High 2."

639
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,570
When I released my first solo album...

640
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:49,390
Many band members and musicians heard it and told me I was great.

641
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:56,640
He's a former rock band member and went solo at a Rock festival in 2011.

642
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:46,230
He's finally on his long-awaited dream stage. This suits him as well.

643
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:57,520
He's doing his part on "Law of the Jungle" with unique vigor and quick adaptability.

644
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,910
[Will he make physical contact today?]

645
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:02,930
[Come here]

646
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:10,500
[What is he doing?]

647
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,810
[He's trying to lure them by becoming a tall tree]

648
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:21,070
[Jinwoon lures them with a familiar sound]

649
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:24,770
[It climbed!]

650
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:28,750
[Lemurs are known to be sociable]

651
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:32,770
[Maybe since it's the second day, it became close to them]

652
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,650
[Awesome!]

653
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:41,180
[Made physical contact!]

654
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:45,020
[A concert on the spot for finding water?]

655
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:48,080
[How do I dig you?]

656
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,670
[If you dig me and try to dig...]

657
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:56,500
[Bring a shovel and dig]

658
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:59,160
[To not make this tiring...]

659
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:02,900
[To be able to take this water...]

660
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:06,080
[If it doesn't work, we can't take it]

661
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,240
[Even though I die, I can't dig it]

662
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,760
[He wrote his own song about his crush!]

663
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:15,280
I tried to hide her from my head and heart...

664
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:19,940
But I can't because she's so bright.

665
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,490
[You're So Bright
 - Jeong Jinwoon]

666
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:31,030
[You're so bright]

667
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:40,040
[I hide under a shade that will block you]

668
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:45,950
[These two are absorbed]

669
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:50,660
[In his sweet voice]

670
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:55,990
[A sad song on unrequited love]

671
01:18:55,990 --> 01:19:00,440
[In the middle of the desert]

672
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:10,080
[I draw you this time]

673
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,860
[Jeong Jinwoon the jungle's wandering minstrel]

674
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,690
That was really good!

675
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:19,470
Don't fall in love with me.

676
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,370
[Don't worry about that]

677
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,720
I should leave.

678
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,300
[Jung-chul feels left out]

679
01:19:35,010 --> 01:19:39,800
They return in 2012 after a year and a half.

680
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:46,600
The quintessence of their ballad was felt again with a matured sentiment and voice.

681
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:18,580
