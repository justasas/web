[The Birth of Young Artists]

3
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,930
U-KISS first made an appearance in
the gayo world in September 2008.

4
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,630
They stood on their first stage
with a boyish song "Not Young."

5
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,200
[This song is sending a message to people
around them that treat them like kids]

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,180
[Dirty South school of hip-hop was changed into a
Korean style with a piano line and catchy melody]

[They were the first idol group
to present such a genre]

8
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:35,380
[As a multinational idol group, this
debut song showed off their colors]

9
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,620
"I Like You" was released next.

10
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,560
They presented a unique stage with outfits
and hairstyle recalling 1990s boy bands.

11
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,570
[1990s old pop feel was
mixed in a new way]

12
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:40,750
[The repeating lyrics and melody on
top of the hip-hop rhythm made it catchy]

13
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,160

1990s boy band, NKOTB...]

accessories made it nostalgic]

15
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:55,190
They are a multinational group with members
from the US, Hong Kong, and China.

16
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,700
Hello. We're U-KISS.

17
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,080
Why are you called U-KISS?
Doesn't it mean "You kiss"?

18
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,180
- It's a bit long.
- Really? How?

19
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,910
Interpretation?

20
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,860
Did you get that? That's
what U-KISS stands for.

21
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:04,690
That's nothing for a multinational group.
Both Dongho and Soohyun did well.

22
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:14,550
B.A.P made themselves known on a reality show
with a unique concept on aliens invading Earth.

23
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,680
We are B.A.P! Yes, sir!

24
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,790
That was a rabble.

25
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,460
- One more time.
- Edit that.

26
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,850
One more time.
Look over there.

27
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,050
We are B.A.P... quietly.
We are B.A.P. Yes sir.

28
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,580
[What are you doing?]

29
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,780
Begin. We are B.A.P! Yes sir!

30
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,900
Wow! That was good.

31
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,180
Do what we just did.

32
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,090
One, two, three!

33
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,310
- We are B.A.P!
- That's a wrap.

34
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,620
The interview was a bit awkward...

35
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,310
[Many fans came...]

36
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,030
But many fans went wild
even before they debuted.

37
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,590
With all that interest, they successfully
finished a large-scale showcase.

38
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,330
How was the scale?

39
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:21,750
It was a big stadium with 3,000 seats
where we held our showcase.

40
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,360
It was huge.

41
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,450
What did you think of the
choreography for "Warrior"?

42
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:36,230
Umm... I felt it was intense.

43
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,990
Zelo too.

44
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:45,620
They made an impressive debut on January 2012
with a strong message in the song "Warrior."

45
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,910
[A new genre adding krumping and
rock to a strong hip-hop beat]

46
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:44,650
[With a strong message of changing the
conflicts that began with human nature...]

47
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:49,150
[B.A.P's leader, Bang Yong Gook, took part in
composing and showed their own intensity]

48
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:55,570
[Zelo's 16 syllable per second rapping in the
middle known as "LTE rapping" drew attention]

49
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:02,560
[The stage and outfits went with the strong mood
and they dyed their hair blonde for solidarity]

50
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,270
BTOB debuted in March of that year.

51
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:24,330
Formed by Cube Entertainment, producers
of B2ST and 4minute, they drew attention.

52
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:31,320
"Insane" is a dance song, but the lyrical
vocals and refined melody stood out.

53
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,910
[Magnificient strings and refined melody
on top of a sentimental piano line]

54
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,490
[Their lyrical vocals and rapping
stood out in this debut song]

55
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,500

maximize their vocal appeal]

56
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:29,170
[A 28 member orchestra and performance
that went with the mood stood out]

57
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:07,610
BTOB had something else that
differentiated them from others.

58
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,010
[They Have Something Special]

59
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:32,920
BTOB first presented a dance song,
but their dance song is special.

60
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:39,760
That distinction can also be seen in
"Irresistible Lips" from their special edition.

61
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,790
It's a dance song, but a
mournful voice can be felt.

62
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:01,160
Behind the fancy melody is
the members' singing.

63
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,650
[The lyrics of feeling gratitude for one's
family went with the lyrical melody]

64
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:49,650
[We could hear their captivating voice in
this special single made for Parents' Day]

65
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,130
[A cappella for the festive mood]

66
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,880
[Even the rapper's singing.
What's Peniel doing?]

67
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:14,420
[Conductor Peniel]

68
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,730
[Mood Change]

69
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,310
[You better watch out - Why?
You better not cry - Why?]

70
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,520
[Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]

71
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,960
[Santa Claus is coming to town]

72
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,770
[Why is he coming?]

73
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,010
[Their sweet Christmas melody]

74
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,580
[So be good for goodness sake]

75
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,150
[Really?]

76
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,650
[The power of cake
makes them to sing]

77
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,150
[The ending of this sweet song is?]

78
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,280
[One more time]

79
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,690
[Santa Claus is coming to town]

80
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:00,370
Not only their singing, but each
member also plays an instrument.

81
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,270
All-around entertainer Hyunsik plays
the bass guitar like a professional.

82
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,590
Since the planning stage,
BTOB started as a band.

83
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,200
Thus it's possible for them to switch
back and forth from dance to band.

84
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,510
Will we see a BTOB band
someday? I hope so.

85
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,830
[We finally meet]

86
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,370
[You changed a lot
since we last met]

87
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,720
[Are those Earthling clothes?]

88
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,410
Welcome to Earth.

89
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:33,570
B.A.P attracted with an alien concept before
their debut, but they have another symbol.

90
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:45,650
It's a masked rabbit called "Matoki"
appearing at showcases and music videos.

91
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,440
The cost is in the hundreds of thousands,
and it's very big and heavy.

92
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:04,030
Cute characters appear once in a while
and this is B.A.P's other face.

93
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:11,170
B.A.P is an unprecedented group that
debuted with a strong warrior image.

94
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,530
It reminds me of the time
when I was a warrior.

95
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,550
B.A.P's distinct features
continue in their next song.

96
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,240
"Power" contains a warning against
the irrationalities of society.

97
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,780
[It's a hardcore hip-hop mixing intense
hardcore rock with hip-hop sounds]

98
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,520
[Standing up to the strong that habitually
tyrannizes with power and money...]

99
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,930
[It contains a message for
the weak to fight back]

100
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:47,700
[A grand orchestra, chorus, and
B.A.P's intensity stood out]

101
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,350
[A unique performance utilizing
spray cans was memorable]

102
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,320
The performance was intense and unique
using spray cans in the choreography.

103
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,180
Powerful voices went with the mixture
of hardcore rock and hip-hop sounds.

104
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,020
It showed the real worth
of this peculiar rookie.

105
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:07,640
Even Soohyun recognizes
B.A.P's charms and so do I.

106
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,690
The same goes for U-KISS.

107
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,690
They started as a fresh boy band,
but one song made a huge impact.

108
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,650
"Man Man Ha Ni" is the title track
of their third mini-album.

109
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:35,800
It became one of their hit songs with strong
hip-hop sounds on top of electronica.

110
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:15,800
[It's a catchy song mixing the intense hip-hop
sounds of gangsta rap with electronica]

111
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,550
[Their masculine charms were made
prominent with a bad guy concept]

112
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,780
[Straightforward lyrics and restrained
performance were memorable]

113
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,870
[U-KISS had a bright image
since their debut but...]

114
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,200
[This became one of their most loved songs
where they succeeded in their transformation]

115
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,130
[Kiseop joined them with this song
turning them into a seven member group]

116
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,790
U-KISS returned as strong men.

117
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:32,920
The so-called Gangnam Dance, bending
the shoulders back, was impressive.

118
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,930
Everyone started dancing.

119
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,320
[Gangnam Dance!]

120
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,650
[Gets every move!]

121
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:57,070
["Man Man Ha Ni" in rasgueado]

122
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,000
[Naturally gets exciting...]

123
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,330
[They can dance to this...]

124
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,290
[Exciting!]

125
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:31,970
Lively boy band U-KISS undergoes
a complete metamorphosis.

126
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:46,470
Their next songs stress on powerful dances
and melody, but the voice is still appealing.

127
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:05,740
"Neverland" is the title track of their 2nd
album pursuing harmony and not auto-tune.

128
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:12,930
They showed their colors in every song
that seem the same but are always evolving.

129
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,380
[It's a fusion song with house
added to a disco driving beat]

130
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:07,400
[Instead of auto-tune, they did
it manually for vocal harmony]

131
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,940
[The vocal emotions stood out in
the strong melody and performance]

132
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,070
[They showed their colors again
while presenting a mysterious charm]

133
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,800
But U-KISS changes clothes in 2012.

134
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,610
[Their Perfect Transformation]

135
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,280
U-KISS returns with "0330"
a sad hip-hop with lyrical melody.

136
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:55,960
They that showed off strong masculinity,
returned as men singing of sad love.

137
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,630
Their voices were more stable
and rapping had beat.

138
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:42,380
[It's a sad hip-hop with a lyrical piano
melody reminding one of rain sounds]

139

the woman he broke up with was...]

140
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,800
[Expressed well with a stable
voice and rapping that had beat]

141
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:55,780
[They presented an upgraded stage
with the addition of AJ and Hoon]

142
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:02,000
["0330" represents 3:30 AM and they released
a teaser at that same time on March 30th]

143
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,880
They changed into an autumn person
in "Someday" and "Stop Girl."

144
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,000
We can feel their charm in going
back and forth between genres.

145
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,030
B.A.P showed their power
as strong warriors.

146
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,670
They also transformed in
the summer of 2012.

147
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:58,230
"Crash" is a cute song comparing
a boy in love to an accident.

148
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,930
It was a big change
for these warriors.

149
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,150
[Based on British rock, it's leavened
with new colors leaning towards a band]

150

and changed into cute boys]

153
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,390
They released "Stop It" in October.

154
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:47,090
They temporarily cast aside their warrior
image reinterpreting 1990s dances.

155
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:11,290
[A simple melody and lyrics full
of aegyo harmonized in this song]

wonderful reconstruction of 1990s sounds]

159

160
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,830
They returned in the fall of 2012 with "Wow"
in new jack swing, popular in the 1990s.

00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:29,120
I withdrew every money
in all my accounts.

335
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,240
I sold all my stocks and ELS...

336
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,580
- Stocks?
- You had stocks?

337
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:41,400
I got it all in cash. The feeling
of freedom and all that cash...

338
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:48,860
I felt I had everything. I was happy
and regretted not lying low earlier.

339
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:59,540
I went to Seoul Station and booked a room for
a week at the most luxurious hotel in Busan.

340
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,080
Why Busan of all places?

341
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:07,730
I don't know. I wanted to see the ocean
and Busan was the only place I knew.

342
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,920
You know ELS but don't know
there's an ocean in Incheon?

343
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,710
ELS saved Dongho who
ran away from home.

344
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:17,410
I made that remark
because he's cute.

345
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:19,810
When money comes in...

346
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,560
There's another expert of
investments in U-KISS.

347
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,380
I put it in another account
to forget about it quickly.

348
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,630
I took 4-5 years to
purchase a house.

349
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:32,840
Kiseop's know-hows.

350
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:38,840
10% of $1,000 is allowances.
Then you have $900 left.

351
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:45,790
You divide the rest into 3 accounts.
$300 here, $300 here, and $250 here.

352
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:52,020
You'll save money with his info.
He sure is an investments idol.

353
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,890
[Dialect]

354
00:56:53,890 --> 00:57:01,590
[B.A.P used dialect in one of their
songs receiving a positive response]

355
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,580
- What is this?
- Where are you from?

356
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,070
What are they doing?

357
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:08,910
Why are they hugging?

358
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:10,630
I guess it's an adult program.

359
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,710
[Belittling one of their member's acting,
Dae Hyun and Jong Up are having fun]

360
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,210
Maybe it's an adult film.

361
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:21,470
Dae Hyun's dialect was hidden by the mike.
B.A.P used dialects in one of their songs.

362
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:29,660
Him Chan gave the idea for "No Mercy,"
a crossover song with "samul nori."

363
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:01,250
They rapped in dialects also
known as a "man's rap."

364
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:04,940
Their leader, Yong Gook, partook
in composing and gave birth to it.

365
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:19,350
[A rock riff was grafted on to
the powerful hip-hop rhythm]

366
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:26,590
[With their uniquely strong message, the sounds
of drums, claps, and feet were memorable]

367
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:32,750
[Him Chan, a graduate of Gukak National High
School, gave the idea to crossover samul nori]

368
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:39,990
[As a crossover song, it drew attention when they
went on stage with an actual samul nori group]

369
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:44,310
[Traditional Korean instruments
were grafted into the moves]

370
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:47,360
[Jong Up's solo performance was
as if he was twirling a sangmo]

371
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:32,000
First is the Gyeongsang dialect.

372
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:39,280
Next is the Jeolla dialect.

373
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:47,750
The Korean dialects are a native language
of Korea, but it's not used as much.

374
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:54,790
We wanted to show how it's a cool language
depending on how we express it musically.

375
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:57,870
Having a member from
Gyeongsang Province helped.

376
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:05,430
"I'll kick your @$$" in
dialect would be...

377
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:09,900
That's unique. What about a
dialect from another region?

378
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,620
[Cutie]

379
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:19,750
[A BTOB member actually
started the cutie song]

380
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:23,300
1+1 is cutie. 2+2 is cutie.

381
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:26,210
3+3 is... cutie.

382
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:30,670
The aegyo Bible that swept
everyone is "1+1 is cutie."

383
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:36,250
But did you know that a BTOB member
gave birth to this Korean aegyo?

384
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:46,640
It's this member who was
featured in G.NA's song.

385
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,000
It's BTOB's Ilhoon.

386
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,820
1+1 is cutie and 2+2 is cutie.

387
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:56,900
What about 5+5?

388
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,390
Wait! There's also 3.

389
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:03,090
3+3 is cutie. 4+4 is cutie...

390
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:08,670
Cutie song by the creator. Let's
explore deeper into their charms.

391
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,880
[Exploring Members' Charms]

392
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:44,370
Soohyun is the main vocalist of U-KISS.

393
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:16,550
His talents, recognized even by the
originator, can also be seen in musicals.

394
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:21,430
There was 1st generation musical actor
Nam Kyung-eub, and idol singer Soohyun...

395
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:25,840
Even actress Lee Hyun-jung who is
talented in dance, singing, and acting.

396
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:31,970
Their passion, dance, and singing come
together to produce this fantastic stage.

397
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:40,450
I'm Soohyun of U-KISS playing the role of
Mark. It's my first time doing a musical.

398
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:44,550
First, I want to do
well in the chorus.

399
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:49,280
I want to do my best, and U-KISS
is also preparing our next album.

400
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,330
Our single will come out in October.

401
01:03:52,330 --> 01:03:57,700
While active in Korea, we will hold concerts
and fan meetings in Southeast Asia...

402
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:04,480
With Soohyun making the first start, Kevin,
Hoon, and Kiseop also took roles in musicals.

403
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,620
We look forward to U-KISS
as musical actors too.

404
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:20,690
Kevin, Eli, and AJ formed
a sub-unit called uBEAT.

405
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:29,470
With Eli and AJ's low pitched rap and Kevin's
sweet voice, they gave a different charm.

406
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,380
[It's a slow tempo hip-hop
leavened with R&B]

407
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:57,090
[As a sub-unit, Eli and AJ's low pitched
rap went well with Kevin's sweet voice]

408

[It's about the sad heart of lovers
going through a breakup]

409
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:04,180
[They have a different
charm from U-KISS]

410
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:35,690
Don't you get a warning for
having your skirt that short?

411
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:37,330
- No, I don't.
- You don't?

412
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,950
- What's your name?
- It's Shin Dongsoon.

413
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:52,510
[Maybe Dongho passed out]

414
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:58,110
Not only in singing, but Dongho was also
active in variety shows and as an actor.

415
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:00,270
He's the youngest member of U-KISS.

416
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:05,330
- How old are you?
- I'm 18 years old.

417
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:08,550
You look mature now.

418
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:11,670
I haven't seen someone as mature
as him in the waiting room.

419
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,890
The day I've been waiting
for is almost here.

420
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,190
What day is it?

421
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:22,970
After this year's birthday,
I'm getting my ID card.

422
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,480
Oh, you don't have one.

423
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,990
He's now getting his ID card and
I talked with him about my problems.

424
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:38,790
I want to get a driver's license.

425
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:41,720
There's a place where you
drive to buy things.

426
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:45,160
- A drive-thru.
- Yes, a drive-thru.

427
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,990
But I always take the taxi...

428
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:55,150
He later told how he got his license.
Did you go to McDonalds first?

Zelo's the youngest
member of B.A.P.

430
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,850

He was on stage before his debut.

435
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:37,890
He was on stage with Yong Gook as
Bang and Zelo before debuting in B.A.P.

436
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:41,180

had such a group?

01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:57,450
Singing and dancing well
isn't enough these days.

443
01:09:57,450 --> 01:10:05,360
Him Chan was known as the MC for
MTV's "The Show" before his debut.

444
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:10,790
You don't need to pay attention to what
I'm saying but what I said here is right.

445
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,590
That's right.

446
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:31,880
The next MC of "The Show" after Him Chan
were Sungjae and Minhyuk of BTOB.

453
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,330

He's the leader and main vocalist,
and also took a role in a musical.

455

After 1 1/2 years, "Standing Still" was
the title track of their 3rd album in 2013.

466
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:42,030
By trying out progressive house for
the first time in Korean music...

We hope they will captivate more in an intense
and emotional way with their special stage.

473
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:53,400
As the rising stars of K-pop, they're raising
the status of K-pop all around the world.

474
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:58,760
They're especially popular in South America
and successfully ended their concert there.

475
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:04,970
They're the first Korean artists to form a
fan club that combines all of South America.

476

They released "Rain Sound"
from their mini-album in 2013.

This sentimental hip-hop
was pre-released.

479
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:26,940
But the music video that cost
hundreds of thousands drew attention.

on to a melancholy acoustic guitar riff]

their debut and became rising stars.

489
