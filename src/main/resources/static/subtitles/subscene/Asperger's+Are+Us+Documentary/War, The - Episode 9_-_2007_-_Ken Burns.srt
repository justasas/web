00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:28,426
         Well, there was        
   all kind of rumors went on   

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:32,697
        aboard ship, uh,        
     what we was delivering.    

10
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:37,168
   There was one rumor that's   
  very outstanding in my mind,  

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,105
         and this rumor         
   just flew all over the ship  

12
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:44,742
   was that we was delivering   
      scented toilet paper

      to General MacArthur.     

14
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,547

           on the ship          

15
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,315
    to load and unload this,

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,754

00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,688
        disaster struck.

  A few minutes after midnight, 

28
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,361

            on there.

00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,130
  It knocked me out of my bunk. 

30

 passed... went through my mind 

31
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,602
          was that a...         
     a boiler had blown up.

      hissing into the hull     
      of the<i> Indianapolis.</i>

45
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,614
      I put my foot against     
 the side of the ship and pushed

46
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,149
      and started swimming,     
  because I was told that, uh,  

47
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,219
     the best thing to do is    
    to get away from a ship--   

48
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:40,224
   as it went under, it would   
 create, uh, tremendous suction.

49

   So as I pushed with my foot  
      and started swimming,     

50
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,966
           when I did,          
 the ship just shot away from me

  Many men were badly wounded.

58
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:16,394
      Able-bodied survivors     
 did what they could in the dark

    the group that I was in.    

64
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:40,685

 yelled out real loud, "Sharks!"

68
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,864
   And sure enough, there were  
 sharks swimming all around us. 

69
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:56,867
      And, uh, those sharks     
      would swim around us,     

70
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:01,773
 and then, uh, all of a sudden, 
    they would dive in on us    

71
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,609
    and start attacking guys.   

72
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,945
           And, uh...           

73
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,547
 you'd see them attack somebody

    just a few feet from you,

00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:14,585

  never see that... man again.

     All you would see then     

78
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,461

          around them.          

79
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:29,800

 It had originally been intended

131
00:08:23,502 --> 00:08:25,369
           (explosion)          

132
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,838
      (rumbling continues)      

133
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:33,844
      (rumbling continues)      

134
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:44,154
  (rumbling fading out slowly)  

135
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:50,328
       With a single bomb,      
 40,000 men, women and children 

136
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,399
 were obliterated in an instant.

137
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,313
     100,000 more would die     
           within days          

138
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,516
     of burns and radiation.    

139
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,028
    Another hundred thousand    
          would succumb         

140
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:29,734
     to radiation poisoning     
    over the next five years.   

141
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:34,805
                              

142
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:39,109
 More than half a century later,

143
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,713
      citizens of Hiroshima     
      would still be dying      

144
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:46,584
         from the bomb's        
   long-delayed side effects.   

145
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:52,890
    Despite the devastation,    

146
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,259
       the Japanese still       
        would not accept        

147
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,863
   the Allied surrender terms.  

148
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:04,735
        Then on August 8,       

149
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,772
        the Soviet Union        
     declared war on Japan.     

150
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:13,444
 The islands now faced invasion 
         on two fronts.         

151
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,952
 At 11:02 the following morning,

152
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:24,254
        an American plane       
  dropped a second atomic bomb  

153
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,725
    on the city of Nagasaki.    

154
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:32,597
   Some 40,000 more civilians   
         died instantly.        

155
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:41,405
          The Americans         
     had no more such bombs     

156
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:46,477
 and would be unable to produce 
   another for several months.  

157
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:51,381
   But the Japanese had no way  
        of knowing that.        

158
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:59,690
  In Tokyo, the Supreme Council 
  for the Direction of the War  

159
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:04,462
  remained split between those  
  still determined to fight on  

160
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:08,765
       and those willing,       
      finally, to give up.      

161
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:12,703
          That evening,         
 all six members of the council 

162
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,805
    called upon the emperor,    

163
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,141
     who broke the deadlock.    

164
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:21,779
     Japan would surrender.     

165
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:29,186
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
       Everything was set       

166
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,188
   for the landings in Japan.   

167
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,057
     So when the atomic bomb    
           was dropped          

168
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:39,063
   and it ended it so quickly,  
         we were stunned        

169
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,199
          but rejoiced.         

170
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,666
    Our boys would come home!   

171
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:46,804
        There wouldn't be       
    any more of them killed.    

172
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,774
     You can never convince     
     anyone of my generation    

173
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:53,043
      that the atomic bomb      
   was not the greatest thing   

174
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,046
            (laughs):           
  that they ever came up with,  

175
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,514
     because we'll defy you.    

176
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:03,120
       It was just finally      
  the end of that horrible war. 

177
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:09,459
          RAY LEOPOLD:          
    I had very mixed feelings   
            about it.           

178
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,863
      That the atom bomb...     

179
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:20,537
        could be blasted        
        on fellow humans        

180
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:23,273
 whose blood is as red as mine, 

181
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:29,913
       whose skin blisters      
   as readily as mine does...   

182
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:34,485
    was something I had hoped   
        could be avoided.       

183
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,021
           Of course,           
 there is the mathematical odds 

184
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:42,092
     that by killing some...    

185
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,863
  quarter million... Japanese,  

186
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:49,800
        we may have saved       
 half a million American lives. 

187
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:52,470
         Mathematically,        
      that's a good thing.      

188
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:59,543
          But it's hard         
 to give up someone else's life.

189
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:14,391
            NARRATOR:           
 After Japan gave up, the guards
 at Glenn Frazier's prison camp 

190
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:18,062
     had simply walked away.    

191
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,998
He and his comrades wandered out

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,469
          among a dazed         
     civilian population...     

193
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:30,674
   and took the train to Tokyo  
          and freedom.          

194
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:39,784
   EUGENE SLEDGE (dramatized):  
    "We thought the Japanese    
     would never surrender.     

195
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,252
  "Many refused to believe it.  

196
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:48,025
  "Sitting in stunned silence,  
     we remembered our dead.    

197
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,393
         "So many dead.         

198
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:53,063
    "Except for a few widely    
    scattered shouts of joy,    

199
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:59,102
   "the survivors of the abyss  
   sat hollow-eyed and silent,  

200
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:04,775
      trying to comprehend      
      a world without war."

205
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:08,705
           EARL BURKE:          
V-J Day-- I was in San Francisco

206
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,542
      and it just blew up!      

207
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:15,545
 People come out of everywhere: 

208
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,282
      out of every window,      
       out of every door.       

209
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,385
   They came out of the sewer.  

210
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:25,489
      You could cop a feel      
      going down the street     

211
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:28,592
  and nobody would say a word.  

212
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:44,708
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
   Well, my dad was so excited  
     that he ran in the room    

213
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:51,081
   and he got his pistol from   
  World War I and he filled it  

214
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,617
         and we went out        
       of the front door,       

215
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,019
    and if you go dig around    
        that azalea bush,       

216
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,322
       I know the bullets       
  are still in the azalea bush. 

217
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,359
       He fired six rounds      
      into the azalea bush,     

218
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,128
     brought the pistol back    
          in the house          

219
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,632
  and said to my brother and I, 
        "Come on, gang,"        

220
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,668
   and "We're going downtown."  

221
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,703
 And he threw mother in the car 

222
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:17,007
        and we drove down       
   to Admiral Semmes' statue.   

223
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:21,545
  And daddy circled it three or 
  four times honking his horn.  

224
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,715
So by the time we left downtown,

225
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:28,486
     people were climbing up    
     Admiral Semmes' statue     

226
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,021
 and the celebration had begun. 

227
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,089
      But I've always said      

228
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:37,728
        my daddy started        
  the celebration for V-J day.

            NARRATOR:           
   In Waterbury, Connecticut,   

230
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:49,072
   newsboys peddling a special  
      "War's Over" edition      

231
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,241
    of the<i> Waterbury American</i>   
       were on the street       

232
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:55,512
    within 60 seconds of the    
president's formal announcement.

233
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:58,148
      Every firehouse siren     

234
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,818
   and factory whistle in town  
         began to blow.         

235
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,022
          ANNE DeVICO:          
 We didn't even know the people.

236
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,193
We didn't know who they were and
  they didn't know who we were. 

237
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,962
   It was just a joyous time.   

238
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,832
   It was a happy, happy time   
     'cause we're thinking,     

239
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:18,035
     "Well, now all our boys

            NARRATOR:           
      That evening, special     
       services were held       

242
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,810
    at every Waterbury church   
         and synagogue.         

243
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:32,148
 As a sign of profound gratitude
       for the good news,       

244
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,386
   some Italian-American women  
        climbed the hill        

245
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:40,023
   to Our Lady of Mount Carmel  
     Church on their knees.

00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:44,995
          OLGA CIARLO:          
       It was a happy time      
      for a lot of people.      

247
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,632
It was a happy time for us, too,
  to know that the war was over 

248
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,268
      for other boys, too,      
        that were there.        

249
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,836
  But it wasn't so happy for us 

250
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,905
   because we knew my brother   
       wasn't coming home.

            NARRATOR:           
Private Babe Ciarlo of Waterbury
    had been killed in Italy    

252
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:22,399
   during the Anzio break-out   
      in late May of 1944.      

253
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,002
     His mother had refused     
         to believe it,         

254
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:27,504
      poring over newspaper     
           photographs          

255
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,240
   in hopes of glimpsing him,   

256
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:33,443
       insisting the Army       
       had made an error,       

257
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:38,682
that somehow her son would still
     be coming home to her.     

258
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:49,226
           Eventually,

              OLGA:             
 I think the worst day was when 
   they brought his body back.  

260
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,500
        And we went down        
     to the railroad station    

261
00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:01,105
 and when they took his body off
the train and we were all there,

262
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,673
  we all went to the cemetery,  

263
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,776
        when they handed        
      my mother the flag...     

264
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:34,771
                              

265
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:52,956
            FRAZIER:            
         We sailed under        
     the Golden Gate Bridge     

266
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,694
  and into San Francisco Bay... 

267
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:02,699
 and as we approached the pier, 

268
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,036
          there-- I get         
      a little choked up--      

269
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,005
   there was the American flag  

270
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:12,976
    flying high in the breeze   
       over American soil,      

271
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,779
       and it was the most      
        gratifying thing        

272
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,881
     'cause we never dreamed    
     we would ever get back.    

273
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,652
      And there was a bunch     
  of prisoners of war on there. 

274
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,788
  couldn't even see anything--  
     with tears in our eyes.    

275
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,991
        And as we docked,       
       I was one of the...      

276
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,325
I was the second one to get off.

277
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:31,494
  And I get down on the ground, 
      I kissed the ground.      

278
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:34,565
 And every one of the prisoners 
  of war that was on that ship  

279
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,702
      got off the gangplank     
     and kissed the ground.     

280
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:43,406
  was just clapping their hands 
           every time           

281
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,309
      and welcomed us home.     

282
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:50,547
     And it was the greatest    
      feeling in the world.     

283
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:02,292
            NARRATOR:           
   Glenn Frazier's family back  
    in Fort Deposit, Alabama,   

284
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:06,229
  had officially been informed  
        that he had died        

285
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,765
       in the Philippines.      

286
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,467
         (phone ringing)        

287
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,604
            FRAZIER:            
   We were told we could make   
        a phone call home       

288
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,672
         at the expense         
       of the government.       

289
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,708
     So I made my phone call    
           to my home.          

290
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,879
   And the phone was answered   
          by my mother.         

291
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,047
   And I told her who it was,   

292
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:27,450
 and now I didn't know anything 
        about all these,        

293
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,652
       the... the letters       

294
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:32,122
    and the guy coming there,   
            you know,           

295
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,323
    telling them I was dead.    

296
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,457
    So she answered the phone   

297
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,360
      and then she fainted,     
    and the phone went dead.    

298
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,697
      And then her sister,      
     who was there visiting,    

299
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:41,765
         and she fainted        
   when I told her who it was.  

300
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:45,102
 And then my oldest sister came 
  to the phone and she fainted. 

301
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:48,739
 So then there was a long pause 
and my daddy answered the phone.

302
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,575
   He said, "Who in the world   
            is this?"           

303
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:52,542
        And so I told him       

304
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,611
    and I used my middle name   
            at home.            

305
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,313
         It was Dowling.        

306
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,649
  And he said, "Well," he said, 
   "I knew you weren't dead."   

307
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,452
But he said, "Look like I've got
  a bunch of dead women here."  

308
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,554
 He said, "I've got to get them 
       up off the floor."       

309
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,624
 So he said, "Now, you hold on. 
   Don't... don't go away now.  

310
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,625
   I'll be back in a minute."   

311
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,694
           So he goes           
   and gets a pitcher of water  

312
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,562
   and he's pouring some water  
         in their face.         

313
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:13,964
     Come back to the phone     
          and he said,          

314
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:17,367
   "I think they're waking up.  
     Their eyes are moving.     

315
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,270
  He said, "They'll be able to  
  talk to you in a little bit." 

316
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,907
    And that's when they knew   
     I was in San Francisco.    

317
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:31,849
            NARRATOR:           
      By the fall of 1945,      
    750,000 service personnel   

318
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:36,586
         were returning         
  to civilian life every month. 

319
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:48,098
 ("It's Been a Long, Long Time" 
            playing)            

320
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,035
          BING CROSBY:          
          Kiss me once,        
      then kiss me twice       

321
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,471
    Then kiss me once again   

322
00:22:54,473 --> 00:23:00,677
  It's been a long, long time 

323
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,314
     Haven't felt like this,   
            my dear            

324
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,417
  Since I can't remember when 

325
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:11,421
  It's been a long, long time 

326
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:15,859
        You'll never know      
        how many dreams        

327
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,461
      I dreamed about you     

328
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:24,868
        Or just how empty      
  they all seemed without you  

329
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:28,905
        So kiss me once,       
      then kiss me twice       

330
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,308
    Then kiss me once again   

331
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:37,847
        It's been a long,      
         long time...          

332
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:49,192
       Long, long time.       

333
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:57,166
          TOM GALLOWAY:         
  Certainly when you come home, 
    it, uh, it's an occasion.   

334
00:23:57,168 --> 00:24:01,037
   I didn't know how to really  
     react to it because...     

335
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,707
you'd seen a lot of things that,

336
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,677
 that, uh, you didn't ever think
           you'd see.           

337
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,513
        But in any event,       
       it, other than, uh,      

338
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:13,116
   I'll never forget my mother  
         wanted to see.         

339
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,386
For instance, I was just sitting
     there with my shoes on.    

340
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:22,059
And she wanted to see that I had
  all my limbs and everything.  

341
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:23,493
            (laughs)            

342
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,762
    That I still had my feet.   

343
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,398
         And, uh, yeah,         
 she stayed with me a good while

344
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,938
 till I showed her that I had...
     had all my parts on me.    

345
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:53,724
            LEOPOLD:            
      No matter how great,      
      no matter how small,      

346
00:24:53,726 --> 00:25:00,530
   no matter how indifferent,   
    no matter how stupendous,   

347
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:05,868
    regardless of the facts,    
    home has a unique quality   

348
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,704
  that just cannot be exceeded. 

349
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:12,875
   Home is the ultimate value   
      that humans venerate.     

350
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:17,981
            NARRATOR:           
       The war had rescued      
     Waterbury, Connecticut,    

351
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,783
       and the industries       
        that had provided       

352
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:23,086
   its nickname: "Brass City."  

353
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:26,990
          And at first,         
      its workers returned      

354
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:30,494
to making the screws and washers
          and buttons,          

355
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,295
  showerheads and alarm clocks, 

356
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:33,763
          toy airplanes         
      and lipstick holders      

357
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:39,369
and cocktail shakers they'd been
   making before Pearl Harbor.  

358
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:46,342
    But as the years went by,   
  the brass industry declined.  

359
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,845
       So did Brass City.       

360
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:56,853
    Ray Leopold came home for   
    a time, then moved away,    

361
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:58,021
       went into business       

362
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:02,458
      and eventually became     
   a fund-raiser for charity.   

363
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,364
            LEOPOLD:            
 I ran into a young man who was 
   the brother of a young man   

364
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,333
  I had known reasonably well.  

365
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,869
      He said, "What outfit     
      were you with, Ray?"      

366
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:17,507
    And I told him that I was   
     with the 28th Infantry.    

367
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,142
    He said, "My brother was    
       with that outfit."       

368
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:22,379
           And I said,          
    "Where is your brother?"    

369
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:26,483
He said, "Oh, he didn't make it.

370
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,317
           "He's dead.          

371
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,020
    He was killed in action."   

372
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:34,223
  And then he turned, he says,  

373
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:38,828
  "You were with the 28th, too, 
 and you are home and he isn't."

374
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,999
  He couldn't get over the idea 

375
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:51,107
 that someone so dear to him as 
 his brother couldn't make it...

376
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,810
 and someone who is more or less

377
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:59,182
   an indifferent third person  
            made it.            

378
00:27:08,993 --> 00:27:13,562
            AANENSON:           
   There are casualties in war  

379
00:27:13,564 --> 00:27:18,567
   that... they never show up   
         as casualties.         

380
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:21,838
  They're internal casualties.  

381
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,774
         We all changed.        

382
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:28,477
 We went out as a bunch of kids.

383
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:31,948
    Wars are fought by kids.    

384
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,716
       And we came back--       

385
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:39,088
   looked maybe the same, but   
  inside we were so different.  

386
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:46,196

       just odd, I guess.

389
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,342

     good enough with words

00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:12,355
      to his father's farm      
        south of Luverne.       

393
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,325

       University instead

00:29:57,828 --> 00:30:01,965
            NARRATOR:           
    More than 1,000 citizens    
   of Rock County, Minnesota,   

418
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,835
        served in uniform       
         during the war.        

419
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:11,374
  32 of them lost their lives.  

420
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:18,181
   The names of all those who   
  served were carefully painted 

421
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:24,254
  on a wooden roll of honor in  
 front of city hall in Luverne. 

422
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:31,528
 As the years passed, Minnesota 
  winters wore away the names.  

423
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,931
     One year, the monument     
         was taken down         

424
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:38,701
  to be repainted and repaired. 

425
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:42,271
      Somehow, it was lost.

   Our hope was we were going   
       to have a new life,      

427
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:55,719
    and I remember driving up   
           on the day           

428
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:59,655
      that we drove through     
          to the ranch.         

429
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:03,292
      And it was like being     
     in<i> Alice in Wonderland.</i>    

430
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:09,499
   It was absolutely amazing.

            NARRATOR:           
       Sascha Weinzheimer       
         and her family,        

432
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,538
 who had nearly starved to death
  as prisoners of the Japanese  

433
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,876
   in Manila, settled on their  
     late grandfather's farm    

434
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,446
    in the Sacramento Valley.   

435
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:28,551
          WEINZHEIMER:          
    It was some sort of, um,    
   cultural shock coming back,  

436
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:33,523
    because your body's here,   
      but your mind isn't.      

437
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,593
      And to have to put up     
       with the stupidity       

438
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:40,296
    of some of the Americans    
   that have been living here.  

439
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,631
     They'd walk into a room    

440
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,800
      and say, "Oh, tell us     
     about your experience."    

441
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,637
      And then immediately      
           they'd say,          

442
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:52,008
    "Um, we had these coupons   

443
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,777
   "that had to be, you know,   
          uh, rationed,         

444
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:00,283
  and then we couldn't go here  
    because of the gasoline."   

445
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:03,953
       And so we just sort      
     of avoided everything.     

446
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:08,391
  And when people were talking  
   to us about our experience,  

447
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:11,961
 because it... they didn't want 
       to hear it, anyway.      

448
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:26,242
            NARRATOR:           
      Sacramento's wartime      
         transformation         

449
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:32,882
from small-town state capital to
 big city would prove permanent.

450
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:38,288
   State government grew, too.  

451
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,891
    So did the military bases   
    on Sacramento's outskirts   

452
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:47,463
 as the world war was eventually
   supplanted by the cold war.  

453
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,769
     Among the Sacramentans     
         returning home         

454
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,339
        were thousands of       
       Japanese-Americans       

455
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,841
        newly freed from        
        the inland camps        

456
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,510
     in which they had been     
           imprisoned           

457
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:05,648
       for no other reason      
      than their ancestry.      

458
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,385
    They struggled to recover   
         their property         

459
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:13,990
    and rebuild their lives.    

460
00:33:15,525 --> 00:33:20,796
   The men of the 100th 442nd   
   Combat Team came home, too.  

461
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:26,736
    Robert Kashiwagi, wounded   
 four times in Italy and France,

462
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:32,475
  got a job with the California 
       Highway Department.      

463
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,711
           KASHIWAGI:           
  When I showed up in the shop, 

464
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:39,115
 this one fellow from the floor 
      went to his foreman,      

465
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:42,318
"Look, if that Jap is gonna work
 here," he says, "I'm quitting."

466
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,720
 And this foreman told me that. 

467
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:49,825
  And I says, "Well, you know,  
        I passed my test        

468
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,995
     "and I served overseas     
        and I think I did       

469
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,999
 "what I was supposed to do, so 
  I'm going to hold my position 

470
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:58,934
  and I'm going to remain here, 
           you know?"           

471
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,904
      And so, as I remained     
      there, why, he quit.      

472
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:07,877
   And then everything turned   
       a little bit better      

473
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,881
   as time went on, and it got  
    easier and easier for me.   

474
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:17,153
   And so I was able to serve   
      32 years and retire.      

475
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:31,433
   EUGENE SLEDGE (dramatized):  
    "The train trip home was    
     a nostalgic one for me.    

476
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:34,303
    "I was a proud American,    
           of course,           

477
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:39,575
    but I was also a terribly   
      homesick Southerner."

      When Eugene came back     
          from the war,         

487
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,980
he came directly here to see us.

488
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:21,117
      I remember him well,      

489
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,821
   coming in with his uniform   
 and all of his ribbons and all.

490
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:29,892
       And I thought, my,       
   you certainly are handsome!  

491
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:34,864
  I do remember thinking that,  
      how he had grown up.      

492
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,534
        He was no longer        
    that little young friend    

493
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,235
   of my young brother Sidney.  

494
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:43,739
 I suddenly had these two<i> men</i>   
        in my presence,         

495
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:47,944
  and I had that feeling about  
          both of 'em.          

496
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:51,080
       Uh, it was written       
         on their faces.        

497
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,614
      Their faces changed.      

498
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:56,018
       They just no longer      
        looked like boys.       

499
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,055
      They looked like men,     
        which they were.

            NARRATOR:           
     The war had made Mobile    
        into a boomtown.        

501
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:26,582
         But by the time        
    Eugene Sledge came home,    

502
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:31,487
    some 40,000 defense jobs    
    had already disappeared.    

503
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:35,958
   Some workers left the city   
       for the small towns      

504
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,728
    where they'd been living    
       when the war began.      

505
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:44,834
 Others moved north and west to 
bigger cities in search of work.

506
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:54,943
  Returning black veterans, who 
had fought for freedom overseas,

507
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:58,080
     found themselves facing    
      the same segregation      

508
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,483
      they had left behind.

 It would be a matter of disgust
      and distaste with you

00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:12,695
   that the fruits of victory   
         were not yours.        

512
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:20,569
  I never did appreciate going  
        to work at night.       

513
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:25,008
  And the police officer would  
   stop you at night and say,   

514
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,810
  "Hey, boy, where you going?"  

515
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:32,315
     And you come up to, uh,    
         to answer him.         

516
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:34,116
      "You got your hat on.     

517
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:37,853
        Take your hat off       
 when you talk to a white man." 

518
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:38,987
  And that kind of stuff, uh... 

519
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:44,360
    And I'd worked all night,   
  just about, at the railroad.  

520
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:47,096
     And didn't have a car,     
     so I had to walk home.     

521
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,365
    I cried all the way home.   

522
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,869
      It was, it was hurt.      

523
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:58,307
            NARRATOR:           
  John Gray eventually went on  
  to college, became a teacher  

524
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,845
    and then a beloved school   
 principal and community leader 

525
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:06,382
     for 50 years in Mobile.    

526
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:13,890
   Katharine Phillips briefly   
  became an airline stewardess  

527
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:17,560
and married a former Navy pilot.

528
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:20,997
    Her younger brother Sid,    

529
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,332
       who had encountered      
       terrible suffering       

530
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,701
       while serving with       
    the First Marine Division   

531
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,604
     and vowed to find a way    
    to do something about it,   

532
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:33,242
    went on to medical school   
      and became a doctor.      

533
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:42,483
    But there was one person    
  for whom he could do nothing. 

534
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:47,922
          SID PHILLIPS:         
  My friend Eugene was probably 
        as good a friend        

535
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:50,325
        as I've ever had        
        in my whole life,       

536
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:55,029
      but, uh, he could not     
       throw off the war.       

537
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:55,930
     He could not forget it.    

538
00:38:55,932 --> 00:39:00,201
      It seemed to, uh, uh,     
          to haunt him.

         "civilian life

  a veteran; all were the same,

      the deadliest combat

     or another had pounded

            NARRATOR:           
     Eugene Sledge had been     
     an enthusiastic hunter     

549
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:53,754
         before the war.        

550
00:39:53,756 --> 00:39:57,959
    Now he found he no longer   
      had the heart for it.     

551
00:39:57,961 --> 00:40:02,997
 In combat, he had felt the same
     terror his targets felt    

552
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:04,465
 when he fired at them, he said,

553
00:40:04,467 --> 00:40:09,170
  and he couldn't bear it that  
   they could not shoot back.   

554
00:40:10,272 --> 00:40:12,807
     Nightmares plagued him.    

555
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:16,110
   He earned a business degree  
      under the G.I. Bill,      

556
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:19,447
  tried the insurance business  
        and abandoned it,       

557
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:23,751
  eventually became a biologist 
          and teacher.          

558
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:26,755
   "Science was my salvation,"  
         he remembered.         

559
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,758
     "It helped keep at bay     
         the flashbacks         

560
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,328
   from Peleliu and Okinawa."   

561
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:37,198
     "Close, constant study     
   of nature," his wife said,   

562
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,502
   "kept him from going mad."   

563
00:40:43,438 --> 00:40:48,276
      But the war remained      
      with him nonetheless.     

564
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:50,078
          He still had          
    the tiny sheets of paper    

565
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,148
  on which he'd kept a journal  
         in the Pacific,        

566
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,449
          and finally,          
      at his wife's urging,     

567
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:59,787
        he turned it into       
     a combat memoir called     

568
00:40:59,789 --> 00:41:03,324
      <i> With the Old Breed.</i>      

569
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:06,227
     Describing the horrors     
         he had endured         

570
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:11,232
 eventually allowed him to begin
     to put them behind him.    

571

00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:30,417
           "to accept           
    one's responsibility to,    

575
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:37,959

            FRAZIER:            
    My hometown just gave me    
        a hero's welcome.       

583
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:15,463
    Couldn't ask for anybody    
     to be any nicer to you.    

584
00:42:15,465 --> 00:42:18,800
  But, uh, little did you know  
         what was ahead.        

585
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:23,237
   And, uh, I didn't until it   
    started happening to me.

00:42:28,243 --> 00:42:32,213
            NARRATOR:

    O'Vaughn, who had served    

587
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:34,682
  with the Army in North Africa 
           and Italy,           

588
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:41,356
 happened to arrive home in Fort
 Deposit, Alabama, the same day.

589
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,259
 Their mother, Frazier recalled,
         seemed "dazed"         

590
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:48,062
   to have both her boys back,  
       but she remembered       

591
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:51,999
 to give each of them the little
   pile of Christmas packages   

592
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:53,233
    she'd bought and wrapped    

593
00:42:53,235 --> 00:42:58,239
but had been unable to send them
         during the war.        

594
00:42:58,241 --> 00:43:00,875
    When the boys stepped out   
        into the street,        

595
00:43:00,877 --> 00:43:03,845
        they were mobbed        
    by friends and neighbors    

596
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,547
    happy to have them home.    

597
00:43:09,117 --> 00:43:13,253
      Before Frazier joined     
        the Army in 1941,       

598
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:15,990
        he had confessed        
   to a high-school classmate   

599
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:18,392
       that he loved her.       

600
00:43:18,394 --> 00:43:22,329
She had waited patiently for him
      for over three years,     

601
00:43:22,331 --> 00:43:27,668
  until the Army formally told  
   his family Glenn was dead.   

602
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:31,806
    Frazier now eagerly asked   
           after her.           

603
00:43:31,808 --> 00:43:34,441
      Hope that he and she      
       would one day marry      

604
00:43:34,443 --> 00:43:39,847
     had helped sustain him     
          in captivity.         

605
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:42,683
   "I hate to tell you this,"   
       a friend told him,       

606
00:43:42,685 --> 00:43:46,787
   "but she's getting married   
      this coming Sunday."      

607
00:43:48,857 --> 00:43:52,393
           That night,          
      the nightmares began.     

608
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:54,628
            FRAZIER:            
        It was just like        
        real life again.        

609
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,065
      It was just so real.      

610
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,399
       It sort of kept me       
         from sleeping.         

611
00:43:58,401 --> 00:44:01,836
   I got to the point where I   
didn't even want to go to sleep.

612
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:03,637
  My nerves were bothering me.  

613
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:06,074
   You couldn't tell anybody.   

614
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,343
   In those days, if you were   
     seeing a psychiatrist,     

615
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,679
  it didn't make any difference 
whether it was military or what,

616
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:14,581
    nobody'd give you a job.    

617
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:18,252
            NARRATOR:           
      Psychiatrists working     
 for the Veterans Administration

618
00:44:18,254 --> 00:44:20,021
      were of little help.      

619
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:25,393
"Just act normal and you'll feel
     normal," they told him.    

620
00:44:25,395 --> 00:44:29,663
   Frazier eventually married,  
        had two children,       

621
00:44:29,665 --> 00:44:33,401
 ran his own trucking business. 

622
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:37,372
 But the war would not go away. 

623
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,479
            FRAZIER:            
      I hated the Japanese      
       as hard as anybody,      

624
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:50,484
           I believe,           
  could ever hate for so long.  

625
00:44:50,486 --> 00:44:51,552
      And mine was as deep.     

626
00:44:51,554 --> 00:44:55,489
     I think I was justified    
     in the hate that I had.    

627
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:58,225
       But it come a time       
         when it wasn't,        

628
00:44:58,227 --> 00:44:59,327
    it wasn't affecting them.   

629
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:00,695
They didn't even know I existed.

630
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,697
      They were over there      
      and having their fun      

631
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,533
    and getting their things,   
 their country straightened out.

632
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:08,569
  And here I am over here, I'm  
  hating and hating and hating  

633
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:10,605
    and having the nightmares   
          and so forth.         

634
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,708
          And it, it...         
     I had to get rid of it.    

635
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,742
      I had to throw it off     

636
00:45:14,744 --> 00:45:19,213
 because it was just completely 
         destroying me.         

637
00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:22,416
       And I prayed and...      
  and with the preacher's help, 

638
00:45:22,418 --> 00:45:26,754
   I got to the point to where  
      I woke up one morning     

639
00:45:26,756 --> 00:45:32,326
  and I felt a little bit of... 
          more rested.          

640
00:45:32,328 --> 00:45:37,799
   But my war lasted actually   
        another 30 years.       

641
00:45:43,272 --> 00:45:49,010
          PAUL FUSSELL:         
   To forget the war would be,  
      not just impossible,      

642
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:53,581
      it would be immoral.      

643
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:54,982
 It doesn't get to me very often

644
00:45:54,984 --> 00:45:58,886
   except when I talk about it  
            like this           

645
00:45:58,888 --> 00:46:02,423
 and I seldom do that, actually.

646
00:46:02,425 --> 00:46:05,526
      It's just something,      
       it never goes away.      

647
00:46:05,528 --> 00:46:07,027
     It's something you have    
            to endure           

648
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:10,130
       the way you endured      
         the war itself.        

649
00:46:10,132 --> 00:46:11,064
     There's no alternative.    

650
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:12,700
       You can't wipe out       
         these memories.        

651
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:17,405
     You can't wipe out what    
      you felt at that time     

652
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:23,778
 It's just part of, it's part of
 your whole possession of life. 

653
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:28,716
And I suppose it does some good.

654
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,624
            NARRATOR:           
     For all those Americans    

655
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:40,694
        who lived through       
     the terrible conflict,     

656
00:46:40,696 --> 00:46:42,596
for those whose fathers and sons

657
00:46:42,598 --> 00:46:45,632
          and brothers          
      were lost or maimed,      

658
00:46:45,634 --> 00:46:49,737
      as well as for those      
 whose only contact with combat 

659
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:54,842
   was listening to the radio   
  and reading the local paper,  

660
00:46:54,844 --> 00:47:00,715
     it remains to this day,    
       simply, "The War."       

661
00:47:03,084 --> 00:47:08,656
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
  The young men that came home  
 from the war were my neighbors 

662
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:15,663
   when I was a young married   
 woman, and they lived the war. 

663
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:17,998
          They married,         
     they established homes.    

664
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,169
   We all lived in a wonderful  
       little neighborhood      

665
00:47:22,171 --> 00:47:25,439
   where the homes were built   
         for the G.I.'s.        

666
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:29,377
 And every night after we would 
    get the children to bed,    

667
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:34,582
we would all gather and the boys
     would exchange stories.    

668
00:47:34,584 --> 00:47:38,853
     That was the great way     
   of entertaining ourselves.   

669
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,689
     The boy next door to me    

670
00:47:42,691 --> 00:47:47,995
     had ridden with Patton     
         across Europe.         

671
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:54,034
    The boy across the street   
   went in on D-Day plus four,  

672
00:47:54,036 --> 00:47:57,772
   hanging on to a machine gun  
        on a half-track,        

673
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:00,107
           and he said          
    he was four miles inland    

674
00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:03,611
  before he could pry his hands 
       off the half-track.      

675
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:07,047
 He was scared out of his wits. 

676
00:48:10,819 --> 00:48:15,255
     The boy catty-cornered     
        had been a medic        

677
00:48:15,257 --> 00:48:20,260
        and had survived        
       battles in Europe.       

678
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:26,300
      And we would just sit     
      and listen, we wives.     

679
00:48:26,302 --> 00:48:32,506
    We learned more about our   
   husbands and what they did   

680
00:48:32,508 --> 00:48:37,578
          by listening          
    to them exchange stories.   

681
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,748
         But I realize,         
      as I've gotten older,     

682
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,584
  this was a healing for them.  

683
00:48:46,487 --> 00:48:51,591
            AANENSON:           
     The dynamics of war are    
     so absolutely intense,     

684
00:48:51,593 --> 00:48:57,264
        the drama of war        
        is so absolutely,       

685
00:48:57,266 --> 00:48:58,833
    emotionally spellbinding,   

686
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:04,739
 that it's hard for you to go on
       with a normal life       

687
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:08,342
         without feeling        
      something is missing.     

688
00:49:13,615 --> 00:49:16,951
         Now, I have had        
        a wonderful life.       

689
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:21,589
         I have a family        
       that just is ideal,      

690
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:25,693
 and, uh, I've enjoyed my life. 

691
00:49:25,695 --> 00:49:29,363
   But I find there are times   

692
00:49:29,365 --> 00:49:32,266
      when I am pulled back     
       into the whirlpool.      

693
00:49:32,268 --> 00:49:39,073
           I find that          
the intensity of that experience

694
00:49:39,075 --> 00:49:41,875
       was so overwhelming      

695
00:49:41,877 --> 00:49:43,410
    and almost intimidating,    

696
00:49:43,412 --> 00:49:49,750
      that you can't quite      
          let go of it.         

697
00:49:54,255 --> 00:49:57,391
    AL McINTOSH (dramatized):   
      "Luverne, Minnesota.      

698
00:49:57,393 --> 00:49:59,827
         "All week long,        
       with 'Silent Night'      

699
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:01,662
    "running through my head,   

700
00:50:01,664 --> 00:50:04,865
        I've been groping       
     for a Christmas story."    

701
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:11,438
       "Somehow, the story      
       always eluded me."       

702
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,007
      "A lot of servicemen      
          have been in.         

703
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,009
 "They told us where they spent 
    last Christmas overseas.    

704
00:50:16,011 --> 00:50:21,748
  But you didn't need to write  
      a story about them."      

705
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:26,854
  "The story of their happiness 
        about being home        

706
00:50:26,856 --> 00:50:31,959
was written all over their faces
     for the world to see."     

707
00:50:36,631 --> 00:50:39,599
     "And now comes the time    
     when it comes our turn     

708
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:41,768
    "to extend our Christmas    
            greetings           

709
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:45,539
 to each and every one of you." 

710
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:50,377
   "May the joy of Christmas,   
  and a big share of its peace  

711
00:50:50,379 --> 00:50:52,880
  "and beauty, be with you all, 

712
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:57,551
        every single day        
    of the new year to come."

         Al McIntosh,           
   <i> Rock County Star-Herald.</i>    

714
00:51:26,815 --> 00:51:34,454
          NORAH JONES:          
       For those who think     
  they have nothing to share   

715
00:51:34,456 --> 00:51:42,729
    Who fear in their hearts   
    there is no hero there     

716
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:48,369
       Know each quiet act     
          of dignity           

717
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:52,072
    Is that which fortifies   

718
00:51:52,074 --> 00:51:55,776
     The soul of a nation     

719
00:51:55,778 --> 00:51:59,146
      That will never die     

720
00:51:59,148 --> 00:52:04,484
      Let them say of me      

721
00:52:04,486 --> 00:52:10,457
    I was one who believed    

722
00:52:10,459 --> 00:52:15,162
   In sharing the blessings   

723
00:52:15,164 --> 00:52:18,031
          I received          

724
00:52:18,033 --> 00:52:23,804
    Let me know in my heart   

725
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:30,343
   When my days are through   

726
00:52:30,345 --> 00:52:35,716
       America, America       

727
00:52:35,718 --> 00:52:41,255
   I gave my best to you...   

728
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:46,193
          America...          

729
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:57,771
    I gave my best to you.
