00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:02,494
       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
         During the war,        
     you just kept thinking     

11
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:07,465
     that life cannot begin     
       until this is over.      

12
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:12,470
    You just had to see again   
          all the boys          

13
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,473
       that you had known       
        and been fond of,       

14
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,642
 and know they were home safely.

15
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:21,046
       Especially for me.       

16
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:25,783
   so I was still anticipating  
      my life ahead of me,      

17
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:29,720
      but I didn't know who     
     it would be spent with.    

18
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:31,490
   But I felt, if I could just  

19
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:35,193
      get my brother Sidney     
       back home again...       

20
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:37,595
    In fact, I talked to one    

21
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,864
      of my old boyfriends      
         two years ago,         

22
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,633
           and I said,          
 "Why didn't you propose to me?"

23
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,370
     He said, "You wouldn't     
      have listened to me.      

24
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:47,538
   "Till you got Sidney home,   

25
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,108
        you wouldn't have       
      listened to anybody."     

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,977
          And he said,          
   "By the time that occurred,  

27
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,214
    I had lost all my nerve."

40
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:14,392
            NARRATOR:           
The Japanese fleet<i> was</i> close by.

41
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:18,897
   Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa  
   had formulated a new plan--  

42
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,565
         to destroy both        
    the American land forces,   

43
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:24,669
   still struggling their way   
        inland on Saipan,       

44
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:28,773
and the American fleet offshore.

45
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,843
       He would send waves      
   of carrier-based warplanes   

46
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:32,977
       against the fleet,       

47
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:38,416
   then reinforce the Japanese  
     garrison on the island.    

48
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:43,821
  "The fate of our Empire rests 
  on this one battle," he said. 

49
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:48,893
"Everyone must give all he has."

50
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,628
         (alarm blaring)        

51
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,598
        But the Americans       
 had intercepted coded messages 

52
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,869
   and knew they were coming.   

53
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:05,309
   Hundreds of planes took off  
     to engage the Japanese.    

54
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:10,148
           The Battle           
      of the Philippine Sea     

55
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,852
  would be the greatest carrier 
   battle of the Pacific war,   

56
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,489
        nearly four times       
        as big as Midway.       

57
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:24,829
   It was clear the Americans   
        now had an edge.        

58
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:28,032
    Their pilots were better    
    trained than the enemy's.   

59
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,669
 Their planes were better, too. 

60
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,706
       And they had twice       
        as many of them.        

61
00:04:57,195 --> 00:04:59,463
          Maurice Bell,         
      who had been working      

62
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,100
      in a Mobile shipyard      
      when he was drafted,      

63
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,502
       and joined the Navy      
      rather than the Army      

64
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,805
        because, he said,       
     he didn't want to sleep    

65
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,441
    in a hole in the ground,    
     was serving as a gunner    

66
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:14,545
    aboard the heavy cruiser    
        USS<i> Indianapolis,</i>       

67
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:18,016
        now the flagship        
        of the 5th Fleet.       

68
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:23,321
          MAURICE BELL:         
     I was sitting up there     
       with the binoculars      

69
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,790
      and, all of a sudden,     
      I saw a torpedo plane     

70
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:30,795
     diving in on that ship     
        right behind us.        

71
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,165
    And, just as he launched    
         his torpedoes,         

72
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,435
  or was ready to launch them,  
     they hit him with fire.    

73
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,004
     They was firing at him.    

74
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,176
   And the plane tumbled over   
          and crashed.          

75
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,812
     Five seconds behind him    
        was another one.        

76
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:56,187
  They hit him and he crashed.  

77
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,323
    About five more seconds,    
  there's a third one come in,  

78
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,693
        and they hit him,       

79
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,094
    and it throwed that plane   

80
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,731
  in a twist, and the torpedoes 
        fell end over end       

81
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:11,069
       and hit the water,       
     and the plane crashed.     

82
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:18,008
     I was watching all that    
       with my binoculars.      

83
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:36,193
            NARRATOR:           
       The Americans lost       
       29 planes that day,      

84
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:40,465
       but they shot down       
          at least 273.         

85
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:46,437
    American submarines sank    
 two Japanese carriers, as well.

86
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:52,009
       Those who took part      
    in the one-sided contest    

87
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:57,982
      remembered it as the      
 "Great Marianas Turkey Shoot."

  By the Fourth of July, 1944,  

147
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,037
     more than a million men    
     had landed in Normandy     

148
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:19,310
   and were struggling to make  
  progress among the hedgerows. 

149
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:24,348
    That week, British planes   

150
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,852
      would drop 2,500 tons     
        of bombs on Caen,       

151
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:33,223
  beginning a third attempt to  
 take the city from the Germans.

152
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:38,662
        When it was over,       
     2,000 French civilians     

153
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,264
 had been crushed or blown apart

154
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,834
  and the Germans had withdrawn 
   to new defensive positions   

155
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:48,706
     just south of what was     
        left of the city.       

156
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:56,513
Meanwhile, on the Eastern front,

157
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,917
          the Red Army          
     had 28 German divisions    

158
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,618
     encircled in Belorussia    

159
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,725
 and killed 40,000 men when they
  tried to fight their way out. 

160
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:15,900
  The Soviets then took Minsk,  
   the capital of Belorussia,   

161
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:22,639
   and with it more than 2,000  
  tanks and 150,000 prisoners.

      had suffered the most     

164

  JAMES A. FAHEY (dramatized):  
  "Today is the Fourth of July, 

180
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:02,373

      is by killing Japs."

          RAY PITTMAN:          
 Well, your Japanese soldier is 
  probably the toughest soldier 

191
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:59,263
   that fought in World War II  
     other than the Marines.    

192
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,332
  And I mean, they were tough.  

193
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:05,636
      And you surround one,     
  he's going to keep fighting.  

194
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:10,507
 In Germany, you surround 50,000
  Germans and they'd surrender. 

195
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,975
 Or Italians, they'd surrender. 

196
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,044
 But you surround one Japanese, 

197
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,146
   he's going to keep fighting  
            right on.           

198
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,416
    He's going to keep firing   
       till you kill him.       

199
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:29,193
     And they had one thing     
   in mind-- it's killing you.

            NARRATOR:           
 The Japanese troops on Saipan, 
        now without hope        

201
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,474
   of rescue or reinforcement   
   from their shattered fleet,  

202
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:50,081
      were resolved to die      
     rather than surrender.     

203
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,919
   American forces had cleared  
          the airfield          

204
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,522
   and begun a slow, agonizing  
     march toward the north,    

205
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,426
   trying to keep from killing  
       Japanese civilians       

206
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,997
 while flushing Japanese troops 
    from their hiding places.   

207
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,151
    Again and again, Japanese   
    soldiers threw themselves   

208
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,988
      at the American guns,     
      shouting "Banzai!"--      

209
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:35,959
 apparently willing, even eager,
     to die for the Emperor.    

210
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:40,297
            PITTMAN:            
 We'd hear the Japanese talking 
          and drinking          

211
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,532
      and clanking bottles      
         and everything.        

212
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:47,138
        And we knew there       
         was one coming.        

213
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,573
      But they'd come at us     
         and, and, uh...        

214
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:55,646
   we had machine guns set up   
   doing crossfires every way.  

215
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,681
   They'd have to get through   
          the crossfire         

216
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,149
   before we started shooting,  

217
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,552
          but then some         
   of them would get through.   

218
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:05,722
    I had one that came at me   
         with a bayonet         

219
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,424
   and I shot him in the face   

220
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,227
           and he fell          
     in the foxhole with me,    

221
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,463
   and bled all over my pants   

222
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:17,234
    and the bayonet went down   
  between my arm and my chest.  

223
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:21,505
   Nearly got me and him dead.

00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:30,981
            NARRATOR:           
     Before dawn on July 7,     

225
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:35,586
      the Japanese launched     
     a final banzai charge.     

226
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:40,524
     3,000 men, some forced     
    from their hospital beds    

227
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,025
    and barely able to walk,    

228
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:45,696
   many armed only with clubs   
     and rocks and shovels,     

229
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:49,233
charged into the American lines.

230
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,637
      Bulldozers buried all     
      but a handful of them     

231
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,939
        the next morning.       

232
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:05,315
    It was the largest banzai   
   charge of the Pacific war.   

233
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:10,354
           SAM HYNES:           
   We thought of the Japanese   

234
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:15,125
  as... mysteriously unlike us. 

235
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:19,963
     We knew that they would    
       fight to the death       

236
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:24,034
    where, probably, we would   
        have surrendered.       

237
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:30,040
       We began to learn,       
   though I don't think we...   

238
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:34,845
  gathered a lot of information 
     about the prison camps,    

239
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,849
   but we had some and we knew  
  that they were capable of...  

240
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,252
     of a cruelty and sadism    

241
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,956
     in a way that we hoped     
       our people weren't,      

242
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,160
  though I've never been quite  
  sure what Americans would do  

243
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,129
            in the...           
   exactly the same situation.

00:18:58,135 --> 00:19:04,774
            NARRATOR:           
     On July 10, Saipan was     
 officially declared "secured." 

245
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:08,245
      In almost four weeks      
          of fighting,          

246
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:13,684
    16,525 Americans had been   
         killed, wounded        

247
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,986
      or reported missing,      

248
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:20,090
      the costliest battle      
     in the Pacific to date.    

249
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,994
           Among them           
   were several black Marines   

250
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,998
         who had finally        
    been permitted to fight.    

251
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,301
     "The Negro Marines are     
      no longer on trial,"      

252
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,837
   the Marine commandant said.  

253
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,940
   "They are Marines, period."  

254
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:45,348
 Almost 30,000 Japanese soldiers
       were dead, as well.      

255
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,891
In the final days of the battle,

256
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:57,394
      some 4,000 terrified      
       Japanese civilians,      

257
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,596
   mostly women and children,   
            had fled            

258
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:05,235
 to the island's northern tip, a
high plateau called Marpi Point.

259
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:09,206
      Their government had      
     convinced many of them     

260
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,742
     that it was their duty     
       to kill themselves       

261
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:16,446
 rather than fall into the hands
     of the cruel Americans,    

262
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:20,183
   and the handful of Japanese  
    soldiers who had survived   

263
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:25,255
   were prepared to shoot them  
       if they hesitated.       

264
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:31,095
 Some Marines risked their lives
      to halt the madness;      

265
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,231
 Japanese-American interpreters 
         with bullhorns         

266
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,101
     pleaded with civilians     
           to give up.          

267
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:42,606
  But more than a thousand were 
either killed by Japanese troops

268
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,042
        or chose suicide.       

269
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:52,516
            PITTMAN:            
        When we got down        
    to the end of the island,   

270
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:57,220
 they were jumping off the cliff
         at Marpi Point.        

271
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:09,799
   They thought we'd eat them.  

272
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,436
   They thought we'd kill them  
          and eat them.         

273
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,803
        Stuff like that.        

274
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,640
     It's just the Japanese     
           mentality--          

275
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,909
they don't want to get captured.

276
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:24,148
   I never did go down to look  
   at the bottom of the cliff,  

277
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,619
      but it must have been     
       a mess down there.       

278
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:38,194
            NARRATOR:           
     A few Japanese soldiers    
   decided to swim out to sea,  

279
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:42,031
     rather than surrender.     

280
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:44,701
            PITTMAN:            
      So we decided, well,      
  they're going to die anyway,  

281
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,204
  we might as well shoot them.  

282
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:50,774
       So we set up there       
        shooting at them.       

283
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,276
       We'd hear the slugs      
       hitting around them      

284
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,644
     and sometimes somebody     
         would hit one.         

285
00:21:53,646 --> 00:22:00,283
     But it was a long shot,    
    trying to hit their head.   

286
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:14,497
       FAHEY (dramatized):      
        "Sunday, July 16:       

287
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,099
   "It was a warm, sunny day,   

288
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:20,037
       "although it rained      
     during church services.    

289
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,438
     "It was the first time     
      I ever went to church     

290
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,275
      "and saw dead bodies      
          floating by.          

291
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:30,513
   "It is nothing to see men,   
  women and children floating.  

292
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:35,418
"There must be thousands of Japs
   in the waters near Saipan.   

293
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,521
 The ships just run over them." 

294
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:51,702
            NARRATOR:           
  The Americans went on to take 
      Tinian and then Guam,     

295
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:56,940
    the first U.S. possession   
        to be recaptured.       

296
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,944
    The fall of the Marianas    

297
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:04,147
       and the damage done      
      to the Japanese fleet     

298
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:09,852
  forced Hideki Tojo to resign  
    as the Japanese premier.    

299
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:14,958
        His successors--        
        first a general,        

300
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,495
        then an admiral,        
       vowed to fight on.       

301
00:23:21,632 --> 00:23:25,568
   The Japanese had succeeded   
          at one thing:         

302
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,938
    The willingness of their    
     soldiers and civilians     

303
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,209
  to die rather than surrender  
    had made Allied planners    

304
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,945
       painfully conscious      
        of the bloodshed        

305
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,412
   that would surely accompany  

306
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,782
          the invasion          
    of the Japanese homeland.   

307
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:52,996
         DANIEL INOUYE:         
     The first man I killed.    

308
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,766
     I was then a sergeant.     

309
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,169
 I was leading a little patrol, 

310
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:04,775
   and I happened to glance up  
        at the next hill,       

311
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,643
     and I saw this German.     

312
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:10,447
   And so I signaled the men,   

313
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:16,887
    and they all quieted down   
   and I said, "That's mine."   

314
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:23,059
I very deliberately got my rifle
       and set the sights,      

315
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,395
          got the wind,         

316
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:30,266
 and just squeezed the trigger, 
            and bang.           

317
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:35,271
         You would think        
      that at that moment,      

318
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,241
  after killing a human being,  

319
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:41,411
         you would feel         
      a little remorseful.      

320
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:45,048
       I felt... pleasure.      

321
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,850
     And the men applauded.     

322
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:50,486
    "You were terrific, Dan,"   
            you know?           

323
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,357
    That was the early times    
           in the war,          

324
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,261
     and, uh, we were taught    
       to kill the enemy.       

325
00:24:57,263 --> 00:25:01,164
    He was not a good person;   
     he was an evil person.     

326
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,501
           So you felt          
 you had accomplished something.

327
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,272
   Before I became a soldier,   

328
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,840
       I sang in a choir.       

329
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,644
 I was a Sunday school teacher. 

330
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:19,149
      "Thou shalt not kill"     
         was real to me.        

331
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:20,416
         And here I was,        

332
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:25,422
         killing someone        
   and not feeling remorseful.  

333
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:34,565
            NARRATOR:           
        The fall of Rome,       
       just before D-Day,       

334
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:36,132
       had boosted morale,      

335
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:40,003
      but it had not ended      
     the fighting in Italy.     

336
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,106
      The Allies had failed     
   to destroy the German army,  

337
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,910
      and as it fell back,      
 Hitler sent in reinforcements, 

338
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,012
 resolved to make the Allies pay

339
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:53,883
   for every inch of territory  
          they gained.          

340
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:59,756
       Among the Americans      
       in closest pursuit       

341
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,758
 were the Japanese-American men 

342
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,360
     of the 442nd Regimental    
          Combat Team,          

343
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,397
  fresh from training and eager 
  to demonstrate their loyalty  

344
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,667
     to the government that     
   had forced so many of them   

345
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,103
       and their families       
     into internment camps.     

346
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:18,908
      It had not been easy      
    to persuade the military    

347
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,477
    to give them that chance.   

348
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,681
       Eisenhower's staff       
 had initially rejected the idea

349
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,349
  of Japanese-American troops,  

350
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,285
     but General Mark Clark,    

351
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:31,221
   commander of the Fifth Army  
            in Italy,           

352
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:36,326
     had said that he would     
 "take anybody that will fight."

353
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:41,564
 The 442nd would find themselves
       fighting alongside       

354
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,300
        the battle-tested       
    100th Infantry Battalion,   

355
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:47,470
        made up mostly of       
 Japanese-Americans from Hawaii,

356
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:51,108
      who had been in Italy     
           for months.          

357
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,275
       (distant explosion)      

358
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,912
   They had fought so bravely   
      and lost so many men,     

359
00:26:55,914 --> 00:27:01,350
   that they came to be called  
  the "Purple Heart Battalion." 

360
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:08,225
            Together,           
   the newcomers of the 442nd   

361
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:11,061
  and the combat-wise survivors 
          of the 100th          

362
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,962
   would be asked to spearhead  

363
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,699
        the Fifth Army's        
   drive northward from Rome.   

364
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,437
     Among them were two men    
         from Sacramento        

365
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,875
         whose families         
  were still behind barbed wire 

366
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:28,144
      in the United States.     

367
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:33,984
        ROBERT KASHIWAGI:       
         It was the last        
    campfire gathering we had   

368
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,653
   before we went under fire,   

369
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:40,223
    and our company commander   
            stood up            

370
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:43,159
         in front of us         
       Japanese-Americans,      

371
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,162
        and he says that,       
     "We're going under fire    

372
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,698
     "and the very first one    
           of you guys          

373
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,968
      that turns your tail      
     and run the other way,"    

374
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,803
 he says, "I'm gonna shoot you."

375
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,472
 I says, "Oh, that's something. 

376
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:58,308
    "You don't ever say that    
         to a Japanese,         

377
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:03,145
         because that's         
    a very derogatory term."    

378
00:28:03,147 --> 00:28:06,582
            NARRATOR:           
       Private First Class      
  Robert Kashiwagi was guarding 

379
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,819
    a crossroads the Germans    
   had only recently abandoned  

380
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:13,423
     when he came under fire    
       for the first time.      

381
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,557
          (explosions)          

382
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,794
           KASHIWAGI:           
  That was a terrible situation 
          to get into,          

383
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:22,932
       because the Germans      
  would target that crossroad.  

384
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,235
            SOLDIER:            
             Ready.             

385
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,438
           KASHIWAGI:           
 We were caught in that barrage.

386
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,809
      The shell was popping     
         all around us.         

387
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,979
       We didn't have time      
  to dig a hole for a foxhole.  

388
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,348
  And we were digging the hole  
         with our nose,         

389
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,785
     trying to get our head     
     down below the ground.     

390
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:49,025
            NARRATOR:           
        The white captain       

391
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,294
        who had insulted        
      the men of the 442nd      

392
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,863
    was no longer with them.    

393
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,867
           KASHIWAGI:           
  An artillery shell dropped... 

394
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,769
   killed his first sergeant,   

395
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,105
         his, uh, runner        

396
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,141
        and a radio man,        
    all in front of his eyes.   

397
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:09,412
          This captain          
      became shell-shocked.     

398
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,081
       He was just shaking      
  and turned completely white,  

399
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,451
         and he was not         
      hardly able to walk.      

400
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,519
They almost had to lead him out.

401
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:19,256
      (indistinct chatter)      

402
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:26,062
        (artillery fire,        
      gunfire in distance)      

403
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:29,432
     Because of our action,     
     there were two Germans,    

404
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,901
          young men...          

405
00:29:36,506 --> 00:29:38,374
        (voice breaking):       
      ...killed in action,      

406
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:42,378
   dead on the side of this...  
        side of the hill,       

407
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,316
      and that affected me      
      pretty... pretty bad.     

408
00:29:47,584 --> 00:29:52,455
     Because, uh, they were     
     19 years of age, about,    

409
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,926
  they were the same age as me, 
    and I thought to myself,    

410
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,328
   gee, if this was stateside,  

411
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:03,132
     we could've been going     
  to school together, you know. 

412
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:08,671
        That was my first       
   bad experience of the war,   

413
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:14,510
 you know, to see an enemy dead,
 still recognizing their youth, 

414
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:19,349
       and, uh, that this       
     shouldn't be happening.    

415
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:22,785
     And so that hurted me.     

416
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,156
       (automatic gunfire)      

417
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,991
            NARRATOR:           
    Over the next few weeks,    

418
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:31,227
    Japanese-Americans would    
     distinguish themselves     

419
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,863
     at Belvedere, Sasetta,     

420
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,366
      Castellina, Pastina,      

421
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:40,703
       Loranzana, Luciana.      

422
00:30:41,905 --> 00:30:45,842
         The 442nd 100th        
   fought so well and so hard   

423
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,645
  that when General Mark Clark  
           led his men          

424
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,547
     into the important city    
           of Livorno,          

425
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:55,551
   he insisted that they march  
        right behind him.       

426
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,756
   Now everybody wanted them.   

427
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:07,397
      Soon, they were back      
        in action again.        

428
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,465
              MAN:              
              Fire!             

429
00:31:13,937 --> 00:31:18,474
            NARRATOR:           
     Sergeant Daniel Inouye,    
     from Honolulu, Hawaii,     

430
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:22,045
was in Company E, 2nd Battalion.

431
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,679
      (explosion, gunfire)      

432
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:29,719
             INOUYE:            
 This one experience was so bad 
 that I had to see the chaplain.

433
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:33,156
      We had just attacked      
          a farmhouse,          

434
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,424
       and I ran up there,      

435
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:38,628
        and sure enough,        
    there were three Germans,   

436
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,830
     two dead and one alive.    

437
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,401
He was leaning against the wall.

438
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:48,438
     And he spoke in German,    
    and I don't speak German,   

439
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,274
       and he was saying,       
      <i> "Kamerad, Kamerad,"</i>      

440
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:56,779
 and he had his hand up there...
          to surrender.         

441
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,915
      Then all of a sudden,     

442
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,685
        he stuck his hand       
        into his jacket,        

443
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:07,390
     and the only conclusion    
  I could reach instantaneously 

444
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:12,395
      was that he was going     
         for a... a gun.        

445
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,865
    So almost instinctively,    
           I reacted,           

446
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:20,336
       and I hit his face       
   with the butt of my rifle.   

447
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,004
     And his hand flew out,     

448
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:26,109
         and in his hand        
   was a bunch of photographs.  

449
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:32,148
  He wanted to show me pictures 
  of his wife and his children. 

450
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,422
           That's war.          

451
00:32:43,426 --> 00:32:48,364
         (piano playing         
 "It's Been a Long, Long Time") 

452
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:04,147
        (whistle blowing,       
        engine chugging)        

453
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:08,917
        BARBARA PERKINS:        
         During the war,        

454
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:13,356
    it was hard to keep track   
       of your loved ones.      

455
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:16,959
       Mail was very slow.      

456
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,461
    And even the news media,    
           if you knew          

457
00:33:19,463 --> 00:33:22,298
     what company and troop     
      and all that was in,      

458
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,003
 those things weren't published 
      in any detail at all      

459
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,740
         as to pinpoint         
      just where they were.     

460
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:35,411
   Well, you just never know.   

461
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:37,680
       We lived with that.      

462
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:41,885
    That was part of our part   
         we had to play.        

463
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:49,491
           (song ends)

 Gentlemen of the armed forces,

       this is the hoodlum

484
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,443
        I'd like to sing        
         a tune for you.        

485

        My name's Sinatra

489
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,799
            AANENSON:           
       We would be sitting      
      around our tent area      

490
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,167
      in the apple orchard      
           in Normandy          

491
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:43,272
    and we would discuss what   
    they would have to pay us   

492
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:47,944
    to really do what we had    
       just done that day.      

493
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:52,748
         We agreed first        
       that we might do it      

494
00:35:52,750 --> 00:36:00,089
    for $1,000 a mission, but   
   less than ten days later--   

495
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,492
         our losses had         
        gone up heavily--       

496
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,795
       we decided that we       
   wouldn't consider doing it   

497
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:08,364
for less than $10,000 a mission.

498
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:12,535
    And I think that it went    
  off the radar screen in value 

499
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:17,273
     before the end of July,    
     because there's no way     

500
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,875
        that you could be       
       a mercenary enough,      

501
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,043
   they could pay you enough,   

502
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:25,448
    to do what we were doing    
      on a volunteer basis.     

503
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:29,318
       (plane flies over)       

504
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,686
            NARRATOR:           
    In the weeks after D-Day,   

505
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:33,723
   American pilots, including   
        Quentin Aanenson,       

506
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,358
 continued to fly their missions

507
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,761
  over the fields and hedgerows 
     of Normandy every day,     

508
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:41,930
   trying to focus on the help  
        they were giving        

509
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:43,866
    to the men on the ground,   

510
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,736
 and to avoid thinking too hard 

511
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:49,838
        about the losses        
       in their own ranks.      

512
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:54,343
       NEWSREEL NARRATOR:       
      Dashing to a hedgerow     
       to clear Nazis out       

513
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,612
    of another line of hedge    
        across a meadow.        

514
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:02,919
    (explosions and gunfire)    

515
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,354
  The enemy position's blasted  

516
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,657
    and the Germans occupying   
         it have enough,        

517
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,494
   so out comes the white flag  
          of surrender,         

518
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:12,962
      more prisoners taken      
          in the drive          

519
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,630
      to the important city     
          of Saint-Lô.          

520
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:17,900
 As the infantry pushes forward,
       the way is cleared       

521
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,804
      by the smashing power     
  of tanks and heavy artillery. 

522
00:37:28,211 --> 00:37:30,246
            NARRATOR:           
     On July 18, Saint-Lô--     

523
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:34,883
  or what was left of it after  
  six weeks of Allied bombing-- 

524
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,220
     fell to the Americans.     

525
00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:53,168
    General Bradley's forces    
  had finally reached the line  

526
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,838
       Allied planners had      
    expected his men to reach   

527
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,274
  just a few days after D-Day.  

528
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,012
      And he was now ready      
        to send his armor       

529
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:08,250
   roaring through the German   
     lines beyond the city.     

530
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,486
   But first, Allied warplanes  

531
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,355
         were called in         
      to blast an opening.      

532
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:19,328
          The operation         
       was called "Cobra."      

533
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:29,672
        The correspondent       
   Ernie Pyle was down below,   

534
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,240
    watching from a battered    
        French farmhouse        

535
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:36,045
       with officers from       
   the 4th Infantry Division.   

536
00:38:41,217 --> 00:38:45,054
"of the mass onslaught came over
   a little before 10:00 a.m.   

537
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,357
     They were the fighters     
       and dive-bombers."       

538
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,629
  "We stood in the barnyard of  
 a French farm and watched them 

539
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,899
   barrel nearly straight down  
       out of the sky..."       

540
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,333
     (airplanes flying over)    

541
00:38:58,335 --> 00:39:02,938
 "And then a new sound gradually
      droned into our ears,     

542
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,175
         "a sound deep,         
        all-encompassing,       

543
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,544
      "with no notes in it,     

544
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:13,449
    just a gigantic far-away    
   surge of doom-like sound."   

545
00:39:14,284 --> 00:39:15,617
      "It was the heavies,      

546
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,486
           "coming on           
    with a terrible slowness    

547
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:20,656
       "in flights of 12,       
    three flights to a group    

548
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:24,359
     and in groups stretched    
      out across the sky."      

549
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:27,329
 "I thought it would never end."

550
00:39:30,533 --> 00:39:33,568
   "And then the bombs came."   

551
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:39,708
       "It began up ahead       
    as the crackle of popcorn   

552
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:45,081
  "and almost instantly swelled 
 into a monstrous fury of noise 

553
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:49,384
  that seemed surely to destroy 
    all the world around us."   

554
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:10,373
            NARRATOR:           
   The bombs continued falling  
     for an hour and a half.    

555
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,909
    The bright day grew dark    
  with smoke, Pyle remembered,  

556
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,479
       and the steady roar      
         seemed to fill         

557
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:19,415
         "all the space         
      for noise on earth."      

558
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,262
   Two days later, on July 27,  

559
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:37,233
      the First Army poured     
  through the newly opened gap  

560
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:41,838
    out into the countryside    
      beyond the hedgerows.     

561
00:40:45,308 --> 00:40:48,077
           For weeks,           
   the Americans on the ground  

562
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,114
       had felt fortunate       
   to gain 1,000 yards a day.   

563
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,984
       Soon they would be       
     covering up to 40 miles    

564
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:58,521
   in the same amount of time.  

565
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,861
    The Germans were reeling.   

566
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,264
   On August 7, the Americans   

567
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:10,532
     stopped a counterattack    
        cold at Mortain,        

568
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:16,205
 and after five days of battle, 
 forced the Germans to retreat. 

569
00:41:17,307 --> 00:41:21,010
       Then, on August 15,      
     in the south of France,    

570
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:24,013
            American            
 and Free French forces landed, 

571
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:25,881
           fanned out           
       in all directions,       

572
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:29,218
  and began driving northward.  

573
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,421
       The following day,       
    Hitler reluctantly agreed   

574
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:35,123
      to pull his battered      
          Seventh Army          

575
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,258
        out of Normandy.        

576
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,162
      It began a desperate      
     retreat toward Germany.    

577
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:45,834
     The Allies caught them     
    near the town of Falaise.   

578
00:41:53,342 --> 00:41:58,314
     the Allies poured fire     
     into the fleeing men...    

579
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:04,420
       ...from the ground       
        and from the air.       

580
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:09,451
       80,000 Germans ran       
     the terrible gauntlet.     

581
00:43:12,222 --> 00:43:14,422
      At least 10,000 died,     

582
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:18,360
     so many that the pilots    
  of the Allied spotter planes  

583
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,396
        hundreds of feet        
      above the battlefield     

584
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:23,799
  were nauseated by the stench. 

585
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,338
       So many that after       
    the shooting had stopped,   

586
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,707
       General Eisenhower       
           remembered,          

587
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,174
   "it was literally possible   

588
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:35,811
      "to walk for hundreds     
       of yards at a time,      

589
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:41,150
       stepping on nothing      
  but dead and decaying flesh." 

590
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:57,266
            AANENSON:           
          I had caught          
       a bunch of Germans       

591
00:43:57,268 --> 00:44:01,036
 in... in double tandem trucks, 

592
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:04,940
       and they were just       
        massed in there.        

593
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:10,612
     There was so much, uh,     
        firing into that        

594
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:12,281
     and I was the only one     
        that was firing.        

595
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:15,517
     My wingman... his guns     
   had been jammed and, uh...   

596
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:23,192
    the effect on me was that   
   my right hand quit working   

597
00:44:23,194 --> 00:44:25,861
    and I was on the way home   

598
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:29,364
         and I couldn't         
      grip with that hand.      

599
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:36,071
  So I had to put my left hand  
    over on top of the stick    

600
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:40,476
      to maintain it and go     
       and land with that.      

601
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,114
          When I'd have         
        these nightmares        

602
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:49,985
     in years after the war,    
    many years after the war,   

603
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,955
     if it was one relating     
         to that mission        

604
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:54,356
     or missions like that,     

605
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,892
 when I'd get up in the morning,

606
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,295
     go out to the kitchen,     
      Jackie would be there     

607
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:02,698
     and she would have had     
        the coffee made,        

608
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,167
       and she could tell       
        when I walked in        

609
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:09,505
       that my right hand       
    wasn't functioning right.   

610
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:12,408
        She'd pour a cup        
   of coffee, not say a word.   

611
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,977
          She'd hand it         
        to my left hand.        

612
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:17,246
       Never a word said.       

613
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:19,481
        We just went on.        

614
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:26,388
    (explosions, mortar fire)   

615
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,524
          PAUL FUSSELL:         
       A soldier's letter       
     I was reading recently     

616
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:32,728
          is in answer          
     to his mother's letter.    

617
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,396
    He was fighting in Europe   
            somewhere           

618
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,898
         and his mother         
       was very frightened      

619
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,699
 that he was going to be killed.

620
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:41,036
        And she wrote him       
     and said, "Be careful.     

621
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,571
  For God's sake, be careful."  

622
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:46,274
          And he said,          
     "You can't be careful.     

623
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:49,177
     You can only be lucky."    

624
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:53,782
    There's no way, whatever,   
 to escape it by... by technique

625
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:58,654
       or care or attitude      
        or fast movement        

626
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,556
or by athletic skills and so on.

627
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,257
       You're just lucky.       

628
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:09,064
     The shell hits somebody    
      who is not yourself.      

629

       KATHARINE PHILLIPS:      
    We lived in constant fear   
        of the telegrams.       

630
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:26,182
Each day we would read the lists
        in the newspaper        

631
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:31,753
 to see if we could identify any
  of the names that were there. 

632
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:39,928
  We just never knew when we'd  
   lose someone that we loved.  

633
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:51,273
          BURT WILSON:          
         During the war,        
     it was kind of surreal;    

634
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,275
    we never saw anybody die,   

635
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:59,881
 we never saw anybody maimed or 
 wounded or anything like that. 

636
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:04,153
 What amounted to a surrealistic
      feeling about the war     

637
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,189
     came to an end one day     
     when our neighbors, um,    

638
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:11,360
  put a gold star in the window 
 and pulled all the blinds down.

639
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:15,497
        Their oldest son        
    had been killed in Italy.   

640
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,034
  In Sacramento in those days,  

641
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,670
        the way you dealt       
    with something like that    

642
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,371
 was pulling all the shades down

643
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,774
      and never coming out      
          of the house.         

644
00:47:27,777 --> 00:47:30,646
  And so every time you walked  
        past that house,        

645
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:34,549
     the whole idea of death    
     was brought home to you    

646
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:39,788
   because of the shades drawn  
and the gold star in the window.

647

            NARRATOR:           
     Since D-Day, telegrams     
     from the War Department    

648
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,799
 had been arriving on doorsteps 
       all across America       

649
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:56,371
     at a rate inconceivable    
      just a year earlier.      

650
00:47:59,742 --> 00:48:03,478
       Mrs. Augusta Niland      
     of Tonawanda, New York,    

651
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,748
     received three of them.    

652
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:15,457
One son had died on Omaha Beach,
 a second at Sainte Mère-Eglise;

653
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:19,561
       a third was missing      
       in action in Burma.      

654
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,363
A fourth son would be pulled out
          of the line,          

655
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:27,603
so that at least one of her boys
  was sure to survive the war.  

656
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:33,675
    28 men from the tiny town   
      of Bedford, Virginia,     

657
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:37,078
   had landed on Omaha Beach.   

658
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,815
        19 of them died.        

659
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:45,387
    Three more died fighting    
          in Normandy.

662
00:48:53,864 --> 00:49:00,836

      were lost on June 6,      

663

  from Waterbury, Connecticut,  

664

          Since D-Day,

       were terrible, too.

   256,000 soldiers and airmen  

683

At least 19,000 French civilians
       had died, as well.

 and I turned back over the city

700
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:16,358
and as I looked down, there were
    just thousands of people    

701

   that I was seeing something  

704
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:29,537
       that was basically       
         the culmination
