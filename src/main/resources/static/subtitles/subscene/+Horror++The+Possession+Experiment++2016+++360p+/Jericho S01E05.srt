1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,540
It's time for you to come home.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:04,140
I'm staying here.
Mr Coates needs me.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,860
- This is about your dad.
- He left us with nothing.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,460
George killed a man.
We have to bury the body.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,180
We'll take him up onto the moors.
It's the only way.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,340
It seems whatever I do,
my life gets tangled up with yours.

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,700
- Is that so terrible?
- It's not what I had planned.

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,220
- What's that there on your skin?
- An injustice.

9
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,740
Shanty folk don't want me.
Not me family neither.

10
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,020
Coates has been asking questions.
Wants to know all about you.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,460
This is my estate.
You're on my land.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,340
Charles needs your help.
He needs you

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,900
to bequeath Blackwood House
to him in its entirety.

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,900
- Beg him to sign the deeds away.
- I'm not going on my knees to him.

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,940
I offered you my help, Charles,
and you threw it back in my face.

16
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,140
All you've done is bring this town
one day nearer to disaster.

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,820
Pay day, lads!

18
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,180
Look at him.
Fast as muck off a shovel.

19
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,660
With nothin' but a taste for ale
on his lips.

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,300
- Pay day. What do you expect?
- Whatever's not thrown down his neck

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,780
- will end up in Polly's purse.
- Aye. She's set to retire on wages

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,180
Dagger puts her way.

23
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,660
It's from my uncle.

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
He's still refusing to help us.

25
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,940
There's no money, Charles.

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,380
I'm sorry, it's not much
of a business partnership.

27
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,220
Whatever happens,
we'll get through it together.

28
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,020
We can't pay the men their wages.

29
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,740
You have to go and tell Mr Coates.

30
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,300
I miss you.

31
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,340
The place is quiet without you.

32
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,980
It's not been right peaceful down
at Steam Truck.

33
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,180
And Martha.
Reckons she's got double the chores.

34
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,420
I could come back, help her out.
It's only right.

35
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,620
Can move back in tonight...
if you'd like.

36
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,900
We're content enough here,
aren't we?

37
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,060
Though it's the last place
I'd have thought to bring you.

38
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,020
- I'll come back with the others.
- No, you're all right.

39
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,060
Best get fed before rush.

40
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,580
How is it?

41
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,140
What's keepin' Coates?

42
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,180
Ale isn't going to sup itself.

43
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,100
A slight administrative oversight,
that's all,

44
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,340
but resolved easily enough.

45
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,300
The men won't take kindly
to late wages.

46
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,980
A simple explanation
is all it takes, Mr Coates.

47
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,220
I think it's best
they hear that from you.

48
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,740
- Thank you all for your patience.
- What choice?

49
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,100
- Aye.
- As you might be aware...

50
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,180
What I mean is that...

51
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,620
certain issues have arisen and...

52
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,020
- Speak up, man!
- Enough.

53
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,980
Certain issues have arisen

54
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,420
which will lead to a delay
in wages being paid.

55
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,220
Just for today, that's all.
Just a day... or so.

56
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,820
But I can assure you
that it is temporary

57
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,180
and will be rectified
as soon as possible.

58
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,100
It's no use looking to me.

59
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,660
- I know as much as all you do.
- So you'd say?

60
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,220
- If you knew something?
- Aye.

61
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,580
But I don't. Trust me.

62
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,140
Like we're supposed to trust
your brother?

63
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,660
Dagger.

64
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,700
We're good for the money, as soon
as Blackwood gives us what's owed.

65
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,660
- Only those with cash.
- But none of us have been paid.

66
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,060
Well, I'm sorry,
but we're not runnin' this place

67
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,225
- for the good of our health.
- Oh, come on, Lizzie.

68
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,780
Your Joe is happy
to slip some a beer.

69
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,340
Joe Capstick,
are you givin' away free drink?

70
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,300
We can't deny the men their ale.
There'd be a riot.

71
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,420
Perhaps that's what's needed.

72
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,900
If Blackwood is green enough
to think all's well without wages.

73
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,420
Read what it says.

74
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,940
Well, what's it say, then?

75
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,820
'No money no ale'.

76
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,860
It's house rules.

77
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,020
This isn't right. None of us
should have to suffer this.

78
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,580
I kept them all out for you,

79
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,620
exactly as you left them.

80
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,900
You know, I remember
when he give me it, my dad.

81
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,380
I've been thinking about him
a lot recently.

82
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,740
I ought to be getting on.

83
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,500
What's the matter?
Are you not in any hurry, then?

84
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,220
Maybe we could just talk some.

85
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,260
It's been a tough day.

86
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,500
I worked on the rail road
for 30 years across America.

87
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,900
Civil war came
and I fought for the North.

88
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,140
My regiment was blown apart
at the Battle of Bull Run.

89
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,260
I escaped.
Tried to make my way back home.

90
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
Went renegade.

91
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,540
Burned my uniform.

92
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,580
Somethin' happened.

93
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,220
I was mistaken for a runaway slave.

94
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:38,580
They captured me,
put me to work on a plantation.

95
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,020
Branded me there.

96
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,020
I swore then

97
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:51,420
I would never be made a slave again
by any man.

98
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,580
The plantations
had their own way of working.

99
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,980
There's this great divide
between the masters and the men.

100
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,300
I never trust a man
who tries to straddle both worlds.

101
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,500
They make out they're on your side,

102
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,820
but they're only out for themselves.

103
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:18,020
Something about Johnny Blackwood
has always made me feel uneasy.

104
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,980
And ever since I heard him say
he owns this estate,

105
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:27,140
I reckon he wants to be master here.

106
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,540
'And the bride and groom are
expecting to take up residence

107
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,580
in their new home after
a short honeymoon in the Highlands'.

108
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,340
Did you hear that, Davey?

109
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,340
A brand new house.
Oh, can you imagine that?

110
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,140
A scullery, your own privy...

111
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,220
I'd like that
when we get a place of us own.

112
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,100
Why waste money on a place
for ourselves

113
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,500
- when there's room enough here?
- It's time to behave

114
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,940
like you've got expectations.
Moving up like you deserve.

115
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,620
Who knows where it might take us?

116
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,980
- Nowhere. We're going nowhere.
- I beg your pardon?

117
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,140
How long do you think viaduct
is going to take?

118
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,180
There's work here
for a good few years.

119
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,940
Years?

120
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,060
You want me to live on the edge
of a bog-soaked moor for years?

121
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,700
Why flit elsewhere when
there's regular wages to be had?

122
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,620
Wages? Nobody's had any wages.

123
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,180
- That's what all this upset has been.
- Exactly.

124
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,900
Why pay rent for elsewhere
with money we don't have?

125
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,740
Martha,
I doubt there's a need, love.

126
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,420
But there's there's kegs
to get ready and glasses to wash.

127
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,420
I know, love, but situation's bad.

128
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,940
We can't afford to pay for a shift
this evening

129
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,860
if men aren't spending on ale.

130
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,940
Aye. We'll give you a shout
the minute owt changes.

131
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,860
The men aren't happy.
They've rent to pay, food to buy.

132
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,900
They work, are paid,
money gets spent, then skint again.

133
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,980
Week in, week out. No savings.
So a delay in wages

134
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,220
might seem nothing to you,
but to folk down here,

135
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,780
- it's everything.
- I built this place from nothing.

136
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,420
You dare to stand there
and tell me how to manage things?

137
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,860
You think 'manage'
is what you're doing?

138
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,100
The whole place can see
what a crisis you're in.

139
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,820
Money will be here in a day or two.

140
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,580
We both know
that's not entirely true, is it?

141
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,540
No work tomorrow onwards
till wages are paid.

142
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,380
We're not doing owt
till our pockets are filled.

143
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,620
What's the use
in making matters worse?

144
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,660
- There's no need for this.
- Wages will be here soon enough.

145
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,860
Mr Blackwood won't let you down.

146
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,540
He's right.
You have my word on this.

147
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,500
And how much is that worth to you?

148
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,420
Cos it equals nowt to us.

149
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,300
Till there are coins in the palm
of my hand, no graft gets done.

150
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,420
No man lifts a finger!

151
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,900
It's only a day or so
before the money comes good,

152
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,900
isn't that right?

153
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,820
In the meantime...

154
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,860
I'll work with you.

155
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,580
Come back!

156
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,620
I'm ordering you.

157
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,860
What about your loyalty, huh?

158
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,300
Is it to these men

159
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,620
or to your family, as a Blackwood?

160
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,860
Your biggest fear realised,
Charles.

161
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,140
A Blackwood folly.

162
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,140
And I don't say
that to humiliate you,

163
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,620
but to encourage you.

164
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,380
Take Johnny's money from the house

165
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,460
and let him stay in the valley
as long as he wants.

166
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,860
He doesn't need to be part
of our lives up here.

167
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Mr Coates is here to see you.

168
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,460
Have the men decided
to go back to work?

169
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,460
No. And not likely, I'm afraid.

170
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,380
But there may be a way through this.

171
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,740
Navvies work hard,
then march on their stomachs

172
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,740
from the scaffold to the tavern.

173
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,300
That all comes to a halt
without money in their pockets.

174
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,820
If you're here just to repeat
my brother's words...

175
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,180
Your word isn't good enough.

176
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,540
It's gonna take
some kind of guarantee.

177
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,140
Written, not spoken.

178
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,100
Charles?

179
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,140
What do you have in mind?

180
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,780
- We're just after our money.
- All right. - Calm down.

181
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
- Step back.
- Stay back.

182
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,340
For those men who are willing
to work, I have these.

183
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:23,060
Guarantees. Each docket
initialled and stamped by me.

184
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,820
Currency until wages are paid.

185
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,660
It's nowt but scraps of paper.

186
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,620
They're as good
as any coins in your hand.

187
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,540
Which can be exchanged
for goods and services.

188
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,980
Food, beverage, rent.
And I assure you, this is temporary.

189
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,460
And as extra good will on my part,

190
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
a bonus next pay day.

191
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,980
Line 'em up, Davey.

192
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,540
Mr McCleod. Shall we get started?

193
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,380
There's about three good land sites

194
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,860
from where you could quarry
the stone to build your viaduct.

195
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,780
It's... er... not going to be cheap,
but will save you in the long term.

196
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,100
You left that in the steam truck.
Thought you might be missing it.

197
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,980
It must be nice to be back here.

198
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,620
You mind if I have a word
with your ma in private?

199
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,420
So, it seems like
he's reconciled with you.

200
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,940
- It appears so.
- Come around to you and Johnny, huh?

201
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,580
We're not together.
He doesn't even live here.

202
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,300
Have you ever asked Johnny
how old he is?

203
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,580
I reckon he's not yet
two score years.

204
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,620
He is the older brother,
that's plain as day.

205
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,100
Is that why you came here?
To quiz me about him?

206
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,820
It is, isn't it?

207
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,300
Charlie Blackwood,
he ain't got no money

208
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,860
and that's why we're all
in the mess we're in right now.

209
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,940
I reckon
he thought he had a fortune,

210
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,100
but then his brother rolled back
into town

211
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,140
claiming that this is all his land.

212
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,540
You think Johnny's planning
on being the master here?

213
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,700
Thank you for stopping by,
Mr Coates.

214
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,740
Good day to you.

215
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,380
Good day, ma'am.

216
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,420
- Annie, don't accept these.
- What?

217
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,060
There's no value to 'em.
You'll get no money to back 'em up.

218
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,860
My brother's word counts
for nothing.

219
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,780
The whole town is thick with them.

220
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,940
They're the only reason
work carries on at all.

221
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,220
- Johnny, you have to tell people.
- What, and let all hell loose?

222
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,700
Johnny, if you want folk
to think you're on their side,

223
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,740
you've no choice.

224
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,300
Listen.

225
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,540
These are worth nothing here
or anywhere else.

226
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,420
I knew it!
Let's go and see Blackwood.

227
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,860
I've seen a few places in my time.

228
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,300
China, South America...

229
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,100
Well, welcome to Yorkshire.

230
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,380
- Can't promise anything exotic.
- Oh, I don't know.

231
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,140
Just scores of grubby navvies.

232
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,140
You'll soon have scores more.

233
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,060
I'm here to plan the quarry
for the other side of the viaduct.

234
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,620
Mmm. Pa will be pleased.

235
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,940
More thirsty workers
to fill his pockets.

236
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,140
Pretty face
and a publican for a father?

237
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,020
This town's looking up already.

238
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,300
Actually,
I'm looking for a room to rent.

239
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,740
We're not usually in the business
for accommodation...

240
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,420
...but exceptions can be made.

241
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,220
Mr McCleod here
is looking for a room to rent.

242
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,940
- You must be Alma's sister.
- Oh, that line's old as the moors

243
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,420
and I've twice the wits she has.

244
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,020
If it's a room you're after,
a shillin' a night.

245
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,860
Two up front in case of breakages.

246
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
And eyes off my daughter,

247
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,940
else her intended
might have summat to say.

248
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,660
- What's happened to you?
- Blackwood's dockets.

249
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,140
The word is we won't see a penny
off the back of them.

250
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,220
What's... er...

251
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,380
- What's that all about?
- Just something and nothing.

252
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,020
You're a liar, Mr Blackwood!

253
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,460
The shop won't take 'em,
the canteen or the tavern

254
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,900
- because they're worthless.
- I don't understand.

255
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,540
Your brother told us you don't have
the money to honour 'em.

256
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,940
Please. I understand the confusion -

257
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,660
You've given us nowt
but a dead promise.

258
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,860
He's made right fools of us.

259
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,340
Are we to be left without jobs?

260
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
What are we supposed to do?

261
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,700
- So what now, Mr Blackwood?
- Clear out the way, please!

262
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,780
Leave here
with not a care for the rest of us?

263
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,940
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry's not good enough!

264
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,660
- There's no use in this trouble.
- And there's no use defending him.

265
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,100
Is there no work for you
at Capsticks?

266
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,140
I don't know
how we're going to manage.

267
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,100
Same as we always have.
We'll get by, the three of us.

268
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
George?

269
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,060
What's this doing here?

270
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,820
I took it from fireplace
when I ran back t'house that time.

271
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,260
We never speak of him no more.

272
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,020
You know why I don't say anything.

273
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,860
Cos you hate him.

274
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,060
- Cos he left us wi' nothin'.
- George.

275
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,540
It's because I don't want
to say unkind things about him.

276
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,580
Things that might hurt you.

277
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,380
Easter, I know Charles
doesn't have a penny left.

278
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,060
The guarantees,
they're nothing but scraps of paper.

279
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,300
What choice did he have? He's
fighting for this place on his own.

280
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,420
Something your father
never intended.

281
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,420
He wanted you back here
alongside your brother.

282
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,740
Have you ever been to his grave?

283
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,100
This land is in your bones.

284
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,820
All he wanted
was his family back together.

285
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,500
So do what you need to do
to make that happen.

286
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,200
Folk have no idea what's going on.

287
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,600
Best to sit tight.

288
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,280
But you would tell me, would you,
if I had to do otherwise?

289
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,520
No point in losing our heads.

290
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,040
Most are saying
Blackwoods are bankrupt.

291
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,240
I wouldn't bet on that.

292
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,160
Not until each of them
has declared their hand.

293
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,800
You've done your best.

294
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
You've shown the men
you're on their side.

295
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,200
- There's nothing else you can do.
- There is.

296
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,400
This whole estate,
the viaduct and the land,

297
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,360
was left to me in my father's will.

298
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,680
But it's debt-ridden.
There's not a penny left.

299
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,280
I didn't know until recently
because my brother took it.

300
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,600
But it's now worth nothing.

301
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,080
So that's it?

302
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,840
This whole town
is to pack up and move on?

303
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,840
There's the family house.

304
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,800
If I borrow money against that,
we can pay the men.

305
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,920
It might give Jericho a chance
at least.

306
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Well, then do it.

307
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,800
It's what my father
would have expected.

308
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,360
It seems you can't fight
who you really are.

309
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,120
When you told me
you were a Blackwood,

310
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,160
I knew this day would come.

311
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,040
This doesn't have to change things.

312
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,040
With the best will in the world,
Johnny, it does.

313
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,760
If you go through with this,

314
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
it'll separate you
from the rest of the men.

315
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,600
You can't drink with them
at the tavern

316
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,760
or wash alongside at the river

317
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
because you'll be in charge.

318
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,280
And what about us?

319
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
Annie.

320
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,480
I rent bunks to navvies and
I sell stew from the back of a hut.

321
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,560
It's a world away from
what you're walking back into.

322
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,640
Then I won't do it.
Not if it means that me and you -

323
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,520
And sacrifice people's homes
and livelihoods? No.

324
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,720
It's the right thing to do.
We both know it.

325
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Go.

326
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,360
Tell people
you'll find a way out of this.

327
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,280
But this could be our chance.

328
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,520
No.

329
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,880
Go forward in this together
and we can put the past behind us.

330
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,600
Agree to my partnership

331
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,000
and everything that
you've worked for can be saved.

332
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,960
And I'm supposed to be grateful
for that?

333
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,680
Welcome your offer with open arms?

334
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,160
It's what our father
would have wanted.

335
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,520
It's what he intended.

336
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,720
It's my home as well as yours.

337
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,760
Since when did that mean anything
to you?

338
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,560
This is the only way
to do what's right by folk.

339
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,800
- As far as you're concerned.
- No, it's a fact.

340
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,240
Because if you don't, there's
nothing to stop me taking over.

341
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,840
- You wouldn't.
- What choice do you leave me?

342
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,720
None.

343
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,800
- Not if you still want some control.
- Charles, look.

344
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,520
Johnny as a part of this
was something we never discussed.

345
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,000
- Charles.
- Don't you think I understand that?

346
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,320
But if we do as he asks, all of
our immediate problems are solved.

347
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
Doesn't that count for something?

348
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,320
It'll buy time for us.

349
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,720
There's nowt of value left in this
tommy shop except muck and timber.

350
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,040
I've nothin'
but the clothes on my back.

351
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,840
Blackwood should pay for this.
It's time we take what's ours.

352
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,120
Could help you move them to bed
if you want.

353
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,480
Ah, best leave them be.

354
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,920
All chaos outside
and they take refuge in a bottle.

355
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,920
Imagine mess if we did same.

356
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,520
Asleep. Dribblin' like a baby.

357
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,360
You could do worse, love.

358
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,240
And that's the best to hope for,
is it?

359
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,680
He loves you, Alma.

360
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,640
He can't believe his luck.

361
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,680
In't that enough?

362
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,760
Trouble is, life can't be
all lightning in a bottle.

363
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,480
Sometimes you just have to make do.

364
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,320
Here, we'll take everything
from Blackwood's house.

365
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,920
No. It... It isn't right.

366
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,360
- Thieving's not the way to go.
- He's stolen from us.

367
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,880
We're only takin' a share
of what's rightfully ours.

368
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,640
Look, I could lend some money.
To see you move on.

369
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,240
- We could go together.
- Got enough for the rest of us?

370
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,160
I couldn't take your money.

371
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,520
And Blackwood's gettin'
no more than he deserves.

372
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,760
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't have no part in it.

373
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,600
A word to anyone about this
and I'll slice you open.

374
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,520
- How many of them?
- Five. Six, maybe.

375
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,600
- Dagger included.
- We have to stop them.

376
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,000
No. Stay out of it, Annie.

377
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Hawker had a knife.

378
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,840
I'd like to believe all of this
was for the benefit of your brother.

379
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,600
- It is.
- And you get something in return.

380
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,640
Well, that's only fair.

381
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,320
What isn't is taking what's mine
and asking me to disappear again.

382
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,640
If you did,
I'd see you weren't left penniless.

383
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,320
You can't honestly believe

384
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,960
that you becoming part
of this venture is a good idea.

385
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,840
Why not?

386
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,520
You forget everything
that went on between us?

387
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,800
Listen, there's nothing
to be gained from bringing that up.

388
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,920
It was one night together years ago.

389
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
One night?

390
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
We talked about running away.

391
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,680
Isabella, we were younger.

392
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
Foolish.

393
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,400
Yes, I was...

394
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,520
to believe anything you had to say.

395
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Why should I now?

396
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,720
Because I'm a different person.

397
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,440
And from where I'm standing,
so are you.

398
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,180
If we leave right now,
we can try and warn them.

399
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,500
- We can't just do nothing.
- So you come to me for help, huh?

400
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,860
- I'd thought you'd go get Johnny.
- He's already at the house.

401
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,260
Trying to solve this mess.

402
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,460
So it's true.
I was right about him all along.

403
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,380
He is in danger, Mr Coates,
and one of the men had a knife.

404
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,220
You expect a toast?

405
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,940
There's no harm in doing something
to mark our new business situation.

406
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,980
One based on a threat.

407
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,380
Charles,
take out the past ten years,

408
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,420
was it really so bad between us?

409
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,300
There's nothing to stop us
making this work.

410
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,900
Dagger, you go first.

411
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,020
- What are you waiting for?
- Maybe Sam was right.

412
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,820
Happen this isn't the way to go.

413
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,900
No, I'm not a thief.
I never have been, so...

414
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,180
We are not leaving here
empty-handed.

415
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,620
We'll hurt them if we have to.

416
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,660
Where are you lot going?

417
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,900
Argh!

418
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,500
No! Please, please, no!

419
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,940
No, no, no! I don't mean any harm.

420
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,300
It was...
It wasn't my idea to come here.

421
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,220
Mr Blackwood, sir.

422
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,500
- What's going on, Dagger?
- I never meant any of this, Johnny.

423
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,340
We just wanted what was owed.

424
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,380
Isabella!

425
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,060
This is nowt to do wi' you, Prince.
It's your brother

426
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,980
- we've got grievance with.
- We're family.

427
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,940
You make trouble for him,
it's with me too.

428
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,620
Thought as much. Blood thicker
than water. No worry to us.

429
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,380
If you harm her - - Back off!

430
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:39,060
It's over, Hawker! It's just us two
making trouble for ourselves.

431
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,380
I'll cut you up, Prince.

432
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,540
I should have done this
first time I clapped eyes on you.

433
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,300
- Johnny!
- Hawker, don't be a fool.

434
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,060
- I'll be out of here soon enough.
- You think it ends there?

435
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,060
One word to the law,
they'll track you down.

436
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,060
- Back off!
- Hawker, please.

437
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,420
- Annie.
- I understand your frustration,

438
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,660
but don't make one mistake
on top of another.

439
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,100
It'll live with you.

440
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,260
A death on your conscience,

441
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,460
day after day
for the rest of your life.

442
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,020
I'm all right.

443
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,700
Don't you look nice.

444
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,180
Girl does her best
with what she's got.

445
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,820
The only thing a man can do
when a girl looks at him like that.

446
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,700
Once the men are paid
and the others are punished,

447
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,460
hopefully this is the end
of any unrest.

448
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,980
I can do that... if you've
other business to take care of.

449
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,340
It's usually Coates
who takes care of the wages.

450
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,700
I'm sure Mr Blackwood
is more than up to the task.

451
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,380
Coates, we should find Mr McCleod.

452
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,900
I'd like to continue
with his thoughts on the quarry.

453
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,580
I'll need a moment
with Mr Coates first.

454
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,780
Bring your keys.

455
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,100
I meant no harm.
One thing led to another.

456
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,780
I never intended...
There's no use you being here.

457
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,900
Go on.

458
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,860
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Let him go.

459
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,060
Your brother agreed
they should be punished.

460
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,220
It's his lies
over the money that led to this.

461
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,300
Then I'll get authority
from your brother.

462
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,420
You have mine.
You need to make room for me.

463
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,100
We start with this, understand?

464
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,020
A knife held to my throat
isn't something I easily forget.

465
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,300
There's no place for you here
any more.

466
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,140
Your father...

467
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,860
used to take you on walks.

468
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,060
He'd have Martha by the hand
and you up on his shoulders.

469
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,660
All the way up to Castleberg Crag.

470
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,100
Oh, he could turn a Sunday walk
through the Dales

471
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,380
into a right adventure.
Do you remember?

472
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,660
He once made a den out of sticks

473
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
and he called it a castle.

474
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,300
I don't want you to lose
those precious memories...

475
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,820
...but there's all sorts of things
about him that you don't know.

476
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,500
And if you really want
to learn the truth,

477
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,900
then there's some things
you should hear.

478
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,780
Now,
you know he gambled away our money.

479
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,980
- I couldn't stop him.
- Aye, whole village knew about that.

480
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,740
Well, he was very unhappy.

481
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,260
He had mountains of debt.

482
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,580
They say that...

483
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,740
he threw himself
off Castleberg Crag.

484
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,900
I thought you didn't know.

485
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,700
Lads at school
used to talk about it.

486
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,740
I never believed them.

487
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,820
Oh, George, I'm so sorry.

488
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,380
I'm so sorry.

489
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,420
My boy.

490
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,860
I can't understand
why he did what he did.

491
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,900
I know, love.

492
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,380
There's no explaining it.

493
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,460
But he loved you more than anything.

494
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,460
Don't ever doubt that.

495
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,020
So, Johnny Blackwood, eh?

496
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,780
He seems like a decent man.

497
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,540
I know that he likes you.

498
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,100
It'd be nice to see you smile again.

499
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,780
You giving me permission
to take up with him, are you?

500
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:46,300
Mr Coates, the Blackwoods are
grateful to you for helping us.

501
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,700
Is that so?

502
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,100
Because from where I stand,

503
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,660
I'm nothing but a stooge
between brothers

504
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,900
and no man
should have to tolerate that.

505
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,300
Charging up to the house like that.

506
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:26,020
I don't know if it makes you
the bravest woman I know...

507
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,060
or the most stupid.

508
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,860
Bit of both?

509
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,060
Reckon you need somewhere to stay.

510
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:41,060
You offering me bed and board again,
Annie Quaintain?

511
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,500
There's things
we need to talk about.

512
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,260
It's not your business.

513
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,980
Charles still doesn't know
about you and Johnny.

514
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,660
Wouldn't want anything
to come between them again.

515
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,220
You might be married to Charlie now,

516
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,620
but you are the reason
that John left in the first place.

517
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,340
It's ancient history.

518
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,860
But with John back around the table,

519
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,780
matters you think dead and buried
when he left

520
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,940
might still cause upset.

521
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,860
Charles will hear nothing from me.

522
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,900
I trust you to do the same.

523
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,140
Three options for your quarry.

524
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,820
All require expensive excavation.

525
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,100
The best and the cheapest access
site to quarry the stone is...

526
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,740
...over there.
