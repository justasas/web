1
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,570
Or we could just buy me a hi-fi.

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,090
Concentrate.

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,210
Sid's going to be spending more time
in his baby stroller than anywhere else.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,770
It's like the office was for
you when you were a working man.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,290
Ah, yes! Those happy times!

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,770
That one with blue on it?

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,250
What? The aluminium frame?

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,890
Then I don't know, Dale!

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,730
What happened to the time when
you just chucked them in a pram

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,290
and listened to Screamadelica?

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,540
Ken!

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,170
Jess! Haven't seen you since
that time at the hospital.

13
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,090
The time I gave birth! And you...

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,570
Yeah, that time, yeah. How's motherhood?

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,290
Loving it. And paternity leave?

16
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,410
How does it feel to be a feminist icon?

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,610
What can I say? I'm a hero to all women.

18
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,890
Ah, the stroller debate.
Marc and I went for that one.

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,570
The Jill Cotterill. It's durable,
light, turns into a car seat.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,690
Oh, gosh, she's a beauty!

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,850
And so this horrific
experience draws to a close!

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,650
I owe you, Jess.

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,970
Don't be silly!

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,930
Actually, you know what?

25
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,770
I'm doing this mums' group thing
with some of the girls from NCT.

26
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,010
You should come.

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,370
Bloke? At a mums' group? Think
that might be a bit weird.

28
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,930
And I said to the doctor, "Hey,
sonny -- what about MY mastitis?"

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,970
Oh! Right, cake o'clock, I think.

30
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,170
Don't you shake your head at me, Jenny.

31
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,410
That baby weight is dropping right
off and you bloody deserve it!

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,800
Excuse me for a second, ladies.

33
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,010
- Cake report. - This is going
to be the best darn coffee cake

34
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,850
those girls have ever tasted!

35
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,810
- Who would have thought that mums'
group would be so ace? - I know!

36
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,770
We get to enjoy all of
the fun and gossiping

37
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,730
but we get to avoid the catty infighting.

38
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,890
Oh, by the way, Beth said
your fruit cake was dry.

39
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,130
- Prissy little tart!
- Right.

40
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,530
Left the stuff for my meeting!

41
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,290
Ooh! How's your coffee morning going?

42
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,170
Tremendously! Ken has a foolproof system.

43
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,530
- I do. - I prepare all the food,
clean the house and wash up.

44
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,330
Ken is the social face of the operation --

45
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,690
occupying the guests, and
checking the food is tasty.

46
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,850
Sounds about right!

47
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,050
Right, now, you wash up. You
-- come and meet the girls!

48
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,010
So, everyone...

49
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,690
Oh, Ken -- busted! Now Laura's going
to know about your daytime harem!

50
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,970
It's not a harem.

51
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,530
Well, I think we would ALL like
to thank you for letting us

52
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,930
borrow him, Laura.

53
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,930
With Marc in Dubai, Ken's
the only male company I get!

54
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,890
Well, I hope he's not droning
on about history too much!

55
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,770
- You!
- Why would you say that, Laura?

56
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,170
Ken is a fascinating intellect.
I hope you appreciate him!

57
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,970
I do. And it's Lorna.

58
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,130
- What's Lorna, Laura?
- My name -- it's Lorna.

59
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,290
What? No!

60
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,730
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
So embarrassing! Oh, ha-ha!

61
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,250
- Lorna. - Yeah. - Lorna.

62
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,440
Not Laura. Lorna.

63
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,970
OK! Well. Back to work.

64
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,850
Oh! By the way, save the
25th for Eliza's christening.

65
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,530
Only right you should be there, Ken,

66
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,290
seeing as you were there at liftoff.

67
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,370
- What? - How do you
mean, there at liftoff?

68
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,330
I think what Jess means is we
were both at the same hospital

69
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,330
when the babies came. Right, Jess?

70
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,920
Right. Well, so just think about it!

71
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,530
- She's a head case.
- No, she's OK.

72
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,650
Nope, she's a head case. See you later!

73
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,500
Squeeze Sid for me.

74
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,970
Jess. What was that about?

75
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,930
Of course I haven't told Lorna
that I was at Eliza's birth!

76
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,050
What? You haven't told her?

77
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,210
No, I haven't told her. Because
of you, I missed Sid's birth!

78
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,730
If Lorna finds out, I'll
get murdered in my sleep,

79
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,930
so keep it to yourself!

80
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,130
Um... oh. It's a bit
weird. I mean, so what?

81
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,370
You held my hand as I gave
birth. It was an act of kindness.

82
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,490
Plus you wouldn't let go of my hand, so...

83
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,170
Oh, Ken! I just want to make it clear --

84
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,330
I am happily married to Marc.

85
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,290
So am I! Very happily! Not
to Marc. To Laura. Lorna.

86
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,050
Well, OK. So then, just
please -- tell your wife!

87
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,170
Because whatever problems
you and Laura are having,

88
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,010
I just don't want to
be a part of them, OK?

89
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,600
Lecture over.

90
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,050
But...

91
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,850
Ling is thousands of miles away,

92
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,700
so how come our love feels even stronger?

93
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,570
And if love transcends time and space,

94
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,770
perhaps therein lies the
secret of the universe.

95
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,210
What do you think, Dyl?

96
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,090
Couldn't give a shit, mate.

97
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,810
Hey. What's that game you're
playing on your robot phone?

98
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,210
It's not a game, you
bell-end. It's Love Swipe.

99
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,810
Ah, fuck! I just liked a munter.

100
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,210
Love Swipe is a way of
finding romantic partners?

101
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,050
No, it's hunting willing snatch.
Here, have a look. Right, OK.

102
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,450
So here we have... ah, older woman, 24.

103
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,770
Only 100 or so metres
away from us... Rachel!

104
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,850
- That's Mom!
- I flicked right, I flicked right.

105
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,050
These treacherous eyes!

106
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,290
Dylan, are you trying to hook
up with me on Love Swipe?

107
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,210
Your photo's like three years
old. You look completely different!

108
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,490
Yeah, right. So my face
has completely changed

109
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,090
- in three years, has it?
- Mom!

110
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,330
You didn't say you were
electronically dating.

111
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,450
Yeah, well, I thought
I'd put myself on there.

112
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,610
- You know, see what the
fuss was about. - Oh, phew!

113
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,690
It seems like there's been nobody
on the scene since December!

114
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,210
- Yeah. How many dates you
been on, Rach? - In total...

115
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,330
- .. none.
- What?

116
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,410
Come on, Mom! Get a move on.

117
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,770
You're not going to find a
man mooching about the house!

118
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,930
Unless there are some
available guys round here --

119
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,690
and I don't know of any.

120
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,280
Thanks, Dale.

121
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,610
- Phew! Longest day ever!
- Hello.

122
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,010
- Mwah!
- How's our little Sid?

123
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,660
Yeah, he's good. I just put him down.

124
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,570
Well, the Briony and Tim saga continues.

125
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,090
Who's Briony and Tim?

126
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,210
- From work.
- Oh!

127
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,090
Don't you listen to a word I say?

128
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,610
Of course! Your voice
is music to me, my love.

129
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,460
- I just sometimes don't
concentrate on the lyrics. - Hah!

130
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,170
So -- there's probably something
I should tell you. It's no biggy.

131
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,330
And certainly no-one's fault. So
promise me you won't over-react.

132
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,490
I will react the exact
right amount. What is it?

133
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,970
Well, do you remember when Sid was born?

134
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,010
I think I recall it, yeah.

135
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,810
Well, it's a funny story.

136
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,450
I... I ran into Jess while
we were waiting for Sid.

137
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,850
And she grabbed hold of my hand

138
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,370
and she wouldn't let go
until she'd given birth.

139
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,250
Which explains why I was late. Why
I missed Sid's birth. It's silly!

140
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,610
But like I say, it's no biggy.

141
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,530
No biggy?

142
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,860
No, no biggy.

143
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,650
Is this a biggy?

144
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,730
Jesus Christ, Ken! No biggy!

145
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,930
Come on, Lorn. It's not like
it didn't work out all right.

146
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,770
Sid's great. And you're the
best wife a man ever...

147
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,170
Oh, shut your face! You have no
idea what I was going through,

148
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,890
what it takes to push a thing
like that out of your bits!

149
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,490
May I remind you I have seen
it three times, actually,

150
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,090
with two different...

151
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,410
- Oh, shit. Lorn!
- Hi, Lorna. Hi, Chief Ken.

152
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,650
- It wasn't my fault.
- Oh, it never is your fault, is it, Ken?

153
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,570
"Whoops, I shot the cat! Whoops,
I didn't have a vasectomy!"

154
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,130
Guys. What's happening?

155
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,490
Are Chief Ken and Lorna
going to get a divorce?

156
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,170
Oh, no -- this happens every couple of years.
Believe me, it's worse when they make up.

157
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,980
Dad walking round like he's John Mayer
just because he's done it twice in a week.

158
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,010
How's your robot-phone dating going?

159
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,890
Love Swipe is crammed with goons.

160
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,290
Well, I hope you'll give 'em
a chance, little Miss Fussy!

161
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,370
Do you? All right, well -- how
about him? He's quite attractive.

162
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,610
Maybe I should go round
to his and have wild sex.

163
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,930
- Be all right with that, would you? - Absolutely
doodle dandy! - Absolutely doodle dandy.

164
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,170
- All right. There -- a match.
- What!

165
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,170
Oh! And he wants to meet now.

166
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,810
I'll just go over there, shall I?

167
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,810
You know, unless anyone has
any objections to that?

168
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,850
- No, none here. - OK. Yeah. See
you in the morning, then. Or not!

169
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,440
- OK!
- OK.

170
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,440
I could not be happier for her!

171
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,770
Maybe we should get a super king-size.

172
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,370
That way you can be even further
away and even more ridiculous.

173
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,970
Just more comfortable like this.

174
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,850
Lorna, I can't help what happened.

175
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,730
I didn't mean to upset you,
but what can I do about it?

176
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,330
Well, here's an idea -- you
can stop meeting up with Jess.

177
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,010
Ha-ha! Not happening.

178
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,570
OK, if you don't care about my feelings...

179
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,290
What about MY feelings, Lorn?

180
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,250
Jess runs the mums' group, which
happens to be my entire social life.

181
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,330
No, I'm sorry -- you don't
get to veto my friends.

182
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,090
Friends? As if! She's after you!

183
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,410
What? Don't be ridiculous!

184
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,210
"Oh, Ken! What a
fascinating intellect, Ken!

185
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,530
"Oh, Ken, hold my hand
while I give birth, Ken!"

186
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,570
Get real, Lorn!

187
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,450
I am greying, I'm out of shape and
Jess is a young, highly attractive...

188
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,570
Fuck! I didn't mean that!

189
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,850
No, I'm sorry. There is a
point of principle here.

190
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,700
I am not backing down on this. Final word.

191
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,250
OK, OK! you win! I won't see Jess again.

192
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,170
I surrender my dignity at your whim.

193
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,450
Nice to see the patriarchy
in action again.

194
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,210
How I love to rule the world.

195
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,130
Now will you please come back
to the centre of the bed!

196
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,920
I don't know what you're going on about.

197
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,780
Right, I am getting a glass of water.

198
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,890
- Hello? - Hey, how's it
kicking? You must be Rachel's...

199
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,490
ancient housemate?

200
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,610
I'm her father.

201
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,570
Father? OK, I'm Freddy. I'm
a... new friend of hers.

202
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,770
We met last night, and then
we had a... a sleepover.

203
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,170
You know.

204
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,570
- Is this awkward? This feels awkward.
- Let us eat our breakfast in silence.

205
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,850
Yeah.

206
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,370
- Hello.
- Ah, this is Freddy.

207
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,410
Freddy and Rachel went
on a date last night.

208
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,130
Interesting. Did he hold hands with
another woman while she gave birth?

209
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,970
Oh. Seamless segue! And thank you
for airing our personal grievances

210
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,930
in front of our daughter's
one-night stand.

211
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,650
I'm not a one-night-stand kind of guy.

212
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,690
Are you going to be boyfriend and
girlfriend from now on, are you?

213
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,570
- I mean, I'm not in that place, so...
- Thank you! - Shit! Rachel actually got laid!

214
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,850
Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

215
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,530
- You're still here? - Well, it's breakfast,
so... most important meal of the day.

216
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,050
Good morning, my beautiful family!

217
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,770
And complete stranger. Would
you like some pancakes?

218
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,450
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

219
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,610
You must be a friend of Rachel's?

220
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,210
Ah, sort of. We met last night.

221
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,330
On a date.

222
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,770
Oh, fun. Did you stay the night here?

223
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,570
- Yeah. - With Rachel?
- Yeah. - In her bedroom?

224
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,650
- Yes, Dale -- we slept
together, OK? - Argh!

225
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,370
Dale!

226
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,650
I am so sorry! I'll get
him cleaned up in no time.

227
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,610
- What the hell was that?
- Weird, right?

228
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,330
It must be my training with Mr Xi --
I get these crazy reflex reactions.

229
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,530
I think he'll be OK.

230
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,850
- Dale, you were the one who told me to
start dating again! - I know, you should!

231
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,850
Then why punch the first guy I spend
the night with? I thought you -- I
mean -- we had made it very clear.

232
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,850
- There's nothing between us.
- Yeah, what are you saying?

233
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,290
You were jealous. Of me and him.

234
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,530
What! I love Ling. See
previous conversations.

235
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,970
Well, obviously, there are some suppressed
emotions going on here. Maybe deal with them, Dale.

236
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,250
Because I can't have this jealous
ex going round the house saying

237
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,450
he's not jealous when he so clearly is.

238
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
I don't care either way... so...!

239
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,730
We're going to take our arms into
the air, stretching to the side.

240
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,650
Rachel is so wrong!

241
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,450
I mean, me -- jealous? No way!

242
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,010
Sure, once I thought her to be
my one and only eternal love.

243
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,210
But that was so eight months ago!

244
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,250
Right leg in the air. Really
push into that stretch.

245
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,530
- What do you think, Chief Ken?
- Oh, God.

246
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:51,090
- Chief! - Yeah, can we talk
about this another time. - Hey!

247
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,570
Oh, no!

248
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,210
Right, as soon as this class
finishes, we are leaving.

249
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,050
Keep walking, Dale. Just
keep walking, please.

250
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,780
Ken! Ken! KEN!

251
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,170
Wow, that is some world-class
baby yoga leaving there.

252
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,130
Ha-ha! Right. It was great to
see you anyway, Jess. Bye, now!

253
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,130
Hey, what are you guys
up to this afternoon?

254
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,810
Some of the mums are coming over.

255
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,210
I've made a killer pistachio tart.

256
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,250
Oh, that sounds delicious! Yeah,
we have absolutely nothing going on!

257
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,810
Oh, but I'm afraid we do have
something going on, don't we?

258
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,340
We've got that thing, Dale. You
know that thing we've got to do.

259
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,370
Oh, I get you -- THAT thing!

260
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,810
He will just...!

261
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,290
No, Chief Ken, that
thing is NEXT Wednesday.

262
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,650
- This afternoon is completely free.
- Great! So come round.

263
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,410
Oh, but I'm sorry, we can't. Get in.

264
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,450
Bye.

265
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,490
Oh, um, which way you headed?

266
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,050
Through town. See you!

267
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,090
You couldn't give me a lift, could you?

268
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,370
It's just, bit worried about
Eliza, it's such a hot day

269
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,330
and the sun being SO
dangerous for tiny babies.

270
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,290
It's very hot.

271
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,810
Of course.

272
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,200
Great. Oh, isn't he a nice man!

273
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,570
Right. We're dropping her
straight off at her house.

274
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,220
And you do not mention this
to Lorna. Do you understand?

275
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,690
Are you sure I can't tempt you
in? The girls will be round soon.

276
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,770
- I've got eclairs in from
Druckers. - Oh! - No, can't do it.

277
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,930
Suit yourself. Dale, would
you be a sweetheart?

278
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,380
Of course.

279
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,820
- Bye.
- Bye.

280
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,730
Thank you.

281
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,330
Chief Ken, have you gone insane?

282
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,330
That's some of the finest
Vienna patisserie in Birmingham!

283
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,330
Lorna says I'm not allowed to see Jess.

284
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,730
She's a little bit jealous.

285
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,980
But mums' group is the
most fun we have all week!

286
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,650
Oi! Where are you going?

287
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,250
- Lorna didn't say I couldn't see
Jess, did she? - Well, no, but... - OK.

288
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,980
- I'm going to go have some cake and
have the best time ever. - Traitor!

289
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,730
What do you think, Sid?

290
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,850
It's not like I'm doing
anything wrong, is it?

291
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,890
Jess is my friend and I love mums' group.

292
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,370
What do you think, my boy?

293
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,330
Should I obey your delusional mother,

294
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,770
or should I make my own decisions
in life like a proper adult?

295
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,760
Who's the chief here?

296
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,090
Hello?

297
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,690
Oh, great! You changed your mind!

298
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,970
Yeah! When are the girls getting here?

299
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,090
Oh, dunno -- in about an hour or so.

300
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,090
Dale, would you be a love,

301
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,130
and run and get some of
that nice coffee from town.

302
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,290
I invite everyone over for coffee
and what do I forget to buy? Coffee!

303
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,530
- Yeah. I'll be back soon!
- Right.

304
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,620
You make yourself comfortable
and I'll be back in a sec.

305
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,840
There we are, Sidney.

306
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,850
- There you go.
- Oh!

307
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,130
Wine?

308
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,330
Well, there's no coffee, is
there! Right, then. Shower for me.

309
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,650
Sorry? A shower?

310
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,450
Well, I can't receive the
girls in my yoga sweats, can I?

311
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,850
OK, Jess -- should I go and
come back another time, cos...?

312
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,410
Oh, no, I'll be two ticks.

313
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,450
Don't worry, we've got a couple
of hours before the gang get here.

314
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,300
A COUPLE of hours?

315
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,540
What are you doing?

316
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,570
Ken! Oh, you're not leaving, are you?

317
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,730
Shouldn't you be wearing more clothes?

318
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,130
Why are you walking towards
me? What's happening?

319
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,290
What's happening is you
are going to ravish me,

320
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,170
you sexy giant old man, you!

321
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,050
What? There will be no
ravishing! Not today or tomorrow.

322
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,530
You were supposed to be
my coffee morning friend!

323
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,890
I am very disappointed
in you, actually, Jess!

324
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,330
I know you're tempted.

325
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,210
You are scaring me! I am a happily
married man. What about Marc?

326
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,610
Oh, come on -- we both
know there's no Marc.

327
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,090
What?

328
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,770
What? Don't undo that.
Why are you undoing that?

329
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,250
You are mental!

330
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,690
I am mental...

331
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,490
- Argh!
- .. and naked.

332
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,730
Ooh! I'm not looking. And I'm leaving!

333
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,050
And I'm not looking! Goodbye!

334
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,500
- Get in the car. - Why? I got
coffee. - She's a fucking nutter.

335
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,850
Lorna WAS right. Jess WAS after you.

336
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,730
Yes. But Lorna had no right
to try and control my life.

337
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,570
I've behaved entirely faultlessly, yet
somehow, I'm also massively in the wrong.

338
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,330
Well, I guess I should
be the one to tell Lorna.

339
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,320
No! Obviously we are
not going to tell her.

340
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,090
And you, my ex-friend, can bog off.

341
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,570
Right, inside.

342
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,370
And none of that accidental
truth-telling that you do.

343
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,490
No, I've shaken that out my system.
It's hard to do business...

344
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,570
... Crime...

345
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,450
... in China without the odd porky pie.

346
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,970
I'll stick to my old standby
-- we were in the market

347
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,130
shopping for Lotus dumplings
for the Dragon boat festival.

348
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,090
Or maybe just go to straight to your
room and never talk to Lorna again.

349
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,980
- OK.
- OK.

350
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,050
Hiya, you two!

351
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,530
Hello, beautiful.

352
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,090
- Have you had a good day?
- Yeah.

353
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,740
He's asleep.

354
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,650
Sorry we argued.

355
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,810
Me too.

356
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,890
Maybe I was a bit
over-sensitive about Jess.

357
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,370
Still, I probably shouldn't see her again.

358
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,730
- Oh, you're not bloody
seeing her again. - No.

359
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,570
- Have you seen her again?
- No! Of course not.

360
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,560
I appreciate it, love.

361
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,820
Fuck, it's started.

362
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,810
So, maybe we could put on a box set,

363
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,570
have a bit of Ken and Lorna time.

364
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,290
Yes, that's my favourite kind of time.

365
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,370
Has it ever occurred to you
that I'm like a faithful,

366
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,450
non-alcoholic Don Draper?

367
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,850
Oh, you totally are!

368
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
- I am, right?
- Yeah.

369
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,460
Five to go to finish the season.

370
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,330
I'll go.

371
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,650
Sit down.

372
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,010
Draper's going to change that nappy.

373
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,060
Oh, God, I am like him.

374
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,490
Well, then, Sidney,

375
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,500
no in-depth analysis of the
Arab-Israeli conflict for us tonight.

376
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,570
No, we shall change that nappy,
quick bath and then bed. Deal?

377
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,210
Oh! Erm...

378
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,770
Here, I'll do that. You
take the weight off.

379
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,970
Nah, you're all right.

380
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,730
Ken, honestly, It's my
turn. You go and relax.

381
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,810
I don't want to relax. You go and relax.

382
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,050
- Let me change him.
- Lorna...

383
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,370
You are stressed out and it's
ruining our family life, OK?

384
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,650
Now, get in there and
chill the fuck out, yeah?

385
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,570
Oh, OK, well, I'll go and
make a cup of tea, then.

386
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,960
Right, good. Tea would be nice.

387
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,340
No, no, no, no, no, no!

388
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,010
Oh, fuck.

389
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,410
Just going to take him for a
little drive, soothe him a bit.

390
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,730
- But he's not crying.
- He's upset, though. I can tell.

391
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,610
It's a sort of primary carer thing.

392
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,290
'Ken, I have been calling and
calling. Where is my baby?

393
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,530
'I want my baby back!'

394
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,940
I'm driving her over now. Don't
move, I'll be ten minutes, tops.

395
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,450
Might as well keep you company.

396
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,410
But let's make it a short
ride. How's our Siddles..?

397
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,610
He's very close to being upset.

398
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,600
Just going to get
something from the house.

399
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,570
- What am I going to do, Dale?
- Snap out of it, Ken!

400
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,650
But she's in the car, she's in the car!

401
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,770
Now, you listen to me.

402
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,370
I've done swaps like these my
whole time with Mr Xi, all right?

403
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,450
Then with suitcases of money, now
with babies -- same principle.

404
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,210
- What?
- I run to Jess' house, grab Sid.

405
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,330
You take her baby to the
leisure centre car park --

406
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,650
that's where we'll meet.

407
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,090
- All you need to do is keep Lorna...
- .. from looking at the baby.

408
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,530
- You got this.
- I can do this.

409
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,130
- You got this, Chief Ken.
- I can swap these babies.

410
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,890
I know you can!

411
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,010
- Dale!
- Just for luck.

412
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,890
Where's my baby? Give me my baby, now!

413
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,770
Jessica, we're going to get
your baby. Just stay calm.

414
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,090
Also, here's your coffee from earlier.

415
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,490
Fuck the coffee.

416
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,940
Let's go.

417
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,060
This is nice.

418
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,610
OK, I'm bored now, let's go home.

419
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,410
Lorna, I'm loving this.
Come on, let's chat.

420
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,450
Tell me about those guys at work,
you know, old Tom and Britney.

421
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,490
- Briony and Tim?
- Hell, yes, those guys.

422
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,170
- Well, Siobhan thought she wasn't
invited to the Christmas party. - No!

423
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,330
I mean she's very nice,
she's in her fifties,

424
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,050
she lives on her own. You
know, she's a bit lonely.

425
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,250
Anyway she came in the other day to work,

426
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,810
she just... She burst into tears,
Ken, on the shop floor and...

427
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,050
.. I took her down to the little
room where we have our cup of tea

428
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,970
and stuff and erm...

429
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,810
.. anyway, she had to admit that
she hadn't even opened the envelope!

430
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,660
But I'm blathering.

431
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,890
What? I live for this
shit, Lorna, please...

432
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,250
OK, well, Briony came
in the following day...

433
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,050
.. and directly said, "Don't
worry, I'll go and get..."

434
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,130
- Ah. - What? - Probably
wants his bottle.

435
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,730
No! Where are you going?

436
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,090
I'm going to get Sid, bring
him in the front for a cuddle.

437
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,970
Lorna, this is our time, just you and me.

438
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,330
Let her cry... Let him cry.

439
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,250
- Ken, I can't listen to him cry.
- Lorna...

440
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,170
You're so beautiful.

441
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,090
Ken!

442
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,540
I don't know what's got into you.

443
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,260
Oh, fuck!

444
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,090
Oh...

445
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,650
- Ken?
- Stop!

446
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,330
Someone's got my baby! My baby!

447
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,680
- Stop! - What the hell
have you done with my baby?

448
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,610
Fuck!

449
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,370
No!

450
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,770
Ken, what the hell is going on?

451
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,450
- No! - Ken! - No! - Ken!

452
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,730
Ken!

453
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,330
What the hell are you doing?

454
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,850
So sorry, sir. I can explain.

455
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,450
- You've got a baby in the back of your car.
- I definitely don't.

456
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,410
- No, you have. Dale put it in.
- Hi, I'm Dale.

457
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,060
Oh, thank God, my little girl. Oh!

458
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,970
Don't you dare bring your stodgy
sponge to my mums' group ever again.

459
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,050
How dare you! That sponge
was light as a feather.

460
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,370
What the hell is happening?

461
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,890
Going around putting babies
in people's cars. It's not on!

462
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,890
- Just calm down, I can explain.
- Well, I bloody hope you will, Ken.

463
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,330
- The thing is, I went round to
Jess' this afternoon... - Ken!

464
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,770
- I know, I know you told me not to...
- No, I didn't.

465
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,370
- I'm sorry, this is principally
for Lorna. - Who's Lorna?

466
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,760
My wife.

467
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,730
Jess was there and I had
Sid and Eliza and I...

468
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,170
No, no, no, mate. Mate,
listen, I am way behind here.

469
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,770
I'm sorry, Lorn, can we
talk about this in the car?

470
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,120
Yes, I think we'd better
get back to your son, Ken.

471
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,930
What I'm saying, Ken, is I was right.

472
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,410
That mad bitch did fancy you.

473
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,130
Yes, all right, you were right.

474
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,250
In future, I will remember I
am irresistible to all women.

475
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,610
It's their incredibly well-kept secret.

476
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,770
How fast did you run out of that house?

477
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,090
Like a fat Usain Bolt.

478
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,540
- Do you want some wine?
- Yes.

479
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,320
Rachel.

480
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,290
Watching Ken and Lorna today has taught me

481
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,250
how destructive jealousy can be.

482
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,250
I mean, it seems their marriage is OK now,

483
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,450
but it was touch-and-go there earlier.

484
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,250
What are you trying to say, Dale?

485
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,890
About this morning.

486
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,850
I now accept that
somewhere deep, deep down,

487
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,330
I may have some residual
feelings towards you.

488
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,690
But, don't worry,

489
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,570
I will not let those feelings get
in the way of our friendship.

490
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,970
I will crush them using the
immense power of my mind.

491
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,580
OK, well, good luck with that.

492
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,290
So...

493
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,330
we're OK?

494
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,050
Absolutely doodle dandy.

495
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,220
Good.
