Make it more complex.

- No.

Look like a tiny T-Rex?

weakness or something.

15

that I'm poor.

176
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,748
- Dobbs.
- Oh, right.

177
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,684
Pardon me.

178
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:28,921
It's been so long, and I've
forgotten so much about you.

179
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:32,959
- Mm.
- Sorry about the echo in here.

180
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,794
It's 'cause my house is so big.

181
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,096
You know what they say
about people with big houses.

182
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,099
- Mm-mm.
- Big clit.

183
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:42,669
Can I ask how you came
into all this wealth?

184
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:46,472
You can.

185
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,942
Long answer is--
how much time do you have?

186
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,879
[both laugh]

187
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,149
The... short answer is

188
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,185
I own a boat company

189
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,887
that I have.
- Mm-hmm.

190
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:05,525
But why talk about business
when you can embrace?

191
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,126
Okay.
You all right?

192
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,628
You smell wonderful.

193
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,062
Thank you, Gene.

194
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,465
- It's Raj. My name.
- Raj, of course.

195
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,200
- Shall we...
- Jesus.

196
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,601
- Shall we eat?
- Oh, no,

197
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,136
'cause dinner's not ready yet.

198
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:18,804
Why?
I mean, I know.

199
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,908
You know what,
how about a little tour?

200
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,977
That's what I was going
to say if you'd let me finish.

201
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,312
Oh, I'm sorry.

202
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,713
I was also gonna
suggest just that.

203
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,115
Good idea.

204
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,385
- This is my own cinema paradiso.
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:35,288
It spoiled me
for the theaters, but--

206
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,822
Let's see
what's on the reels here.

207
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,291
<i>[growls]</i>

208
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,893
Oh, nope. Nope.
Sorry about that.

209
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,930
That is my porn.
It's totally Raj's porn.

210
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,666
Nothing gets me more horned up
than drawn-on dinks.

211
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:50,670
[laughs]
My staff is very, uh, "allowed."

212
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,004
Soup's on!

213
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,307
[exhales]
Hi.

214
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,942
- Hi.
- Hi.

215
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,211
Yes, just seat yourself,
McCallister.

216
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,746
I'll be back momentarily.
Gene!

217
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,815
- Oh, those are [bleep] done.
- Gene!

218
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,683
- Huh? What?
- Who is this?

219
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,086
- This isn't part of the plan.
- This is New Chet.

220
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,921
Hi.
I'm Darryl.

221
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,523
I was inspired by your whole
blast from the past situation.

222
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,525
Darryl and I used
to ass-mule liquid cocaine

223
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,860
out of the Bahamas together.

224
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,762
And we were married.

225
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,097
Oh, that's right!
We were.

226
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,933
- Right? Yes.
- Oh, for two days.

227
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,268
- Yeah, 'member?
- Oh, my gosh.

228
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,535
Wednesday and--

229
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,738
both: Thursday.
- Excuse me!

230
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,439
- What?
- The burner isn't even on.

231
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,742
His burner's not--
you're cooking over nothing.

232
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,510
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

233
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,978
This isn't going well.

234
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,647
No, no, no, no.
I'm gonna tell him.

235
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,248
No, no, no, no.
You can't tell him.

236
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,516
You can't tell him.
It's gonna be fine.

237
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,818
Get your hair-finger
out of the soup!

238
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,086
Look, solved.

239
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,488
He just sucked--

240
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,024
Darryl is here for a reason,
okay, mon?

241
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,627
Why are you talking
like a Rastafarian?

242
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,798
Okay.

243
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,368
Can you bend at all?
Got it? Okay.

244
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,437
Thank you.

245
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:03,309
Dinner will be here soon,
because I-I'ma get it.

246
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,311
Thank you.

247
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:08,280
So nice of you to come tonight.

248
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,016
And I've changed so much
since our... "skyool" days.

249
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,785
What's with your voice?

250
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,954
Sort of a global accent.

251
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:17,323
I'm very world-traveled,
like Madonna Ciccone,

252
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,993
who I've met
at several giant balls.

253
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,861
Where did you, uh, travel last?

254
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,863
I love to travel.

255
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,901
Oh, it's...
all a blur.

256
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,470
- Peni--Pen Island.
- Hmm?

257
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,972
So glad we could do this.

258
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,873
You mentioned that,
like, 30 seconds ago.

259
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,842
- Mm.
- It actually worked out well

260
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,211
'cause my book signing, um,
was canceled.

261
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,180
That must make you feel like...

262
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,182
no one likes your books.

263
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,851
No.
No, just too many RSVPs.

264
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,253
Had to move it to a bigger venue.

265
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,154
I'll be hitting up
the B &amp; Nobles

266
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,724
in Pasadena tomorrow.

267
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:55,060
Grea--great.

268
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,895
So glad you could come.

269
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,063
You said that.

270
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,331
Boom, boom, shake the room.

271
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,066
There we go.

272
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,269
Nah, you haven't seen me
in a bunch of years though, man.

273
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,737
I am grown.

274
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,272
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

275
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,208
I've got a house.
I'm in a bowling league.

276
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,542
- What?
- Yeah.

277
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,945
I've got, like, two, three kids.

278
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,413
So, you're
not a prostitute anymore?

279
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,181
- No, I'm still a prostitute.
- Oh.

280
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,951
So, how's married life?
Terribly confining or--

281
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,620
Ugh.
Alice left me.

282
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,522
We're in the middle
of a divorce right now.

283
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,724
It's ugly.

284
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,460
I'm so sorry, McCallister.
I didn't--I didn't know.

285
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,930
Don't be. Actually,
it turned out quite well.

286
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,799
I'm now dating successful
screenwriter Diablo Cody.

287
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,268
She won the Oscar for
"Juno."

288
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,604
- Never heard of it.
- Yes, you have.

289
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,673
I don't know.
J'you know?

290
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:41,674
It's "Juno."
The movie.

291
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:43,275
J'you know what movie?

292
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,543
J'you know that I'm dating

293
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,146
successful screenwriter
Diablo Cody?

294
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:49,648
I don't know, like,
what's making me think of this

295
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,186
right now, but I've, like,
always wanted to be a witch,

296
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:57,222
with, like, a bubbling cauldron.

297
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,525
That's super dope, man.
Go for it.

298
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,060
Thanks. I will.

299
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,029
Hey, remember that Christmas

300
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,065
when we broke
into that kid's house

301
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,468
but we couldn't steal anything
'cause he was so wily?

302
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,470
No.

303
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:16,008
Yeah, we were casing the place
for weeks posing as plumbers.

304
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,910
I think we even had a name.

305
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,345
The Wet Bandits?

306
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,846
Yes!

307
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,082
Yeah, that's the plot
to "Home Alone."

308
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,251
Oh, so it didn't happen again
in New York?

309
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,885
No.
That's "Home Alone 2."

310
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:30,222
The other day, we were
laughing our tails off in bed.

311
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,724
I mean, this is, like,

312
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:35,394
the healthiest relationship
I have ever been in.

313
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:39,832
Mutual respect has been
a, uh... revelation.

314
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,400
[mumbling]
Is it hot in here?

315
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,801
Are you seeing anyone?

316
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,205
I'm seeing... everyone.

317
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,341
Sorry.
Sorry for the delay.

318
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,844
Tuna tartare?

319
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,846
- [whispers] What is this?
- It's tuna tartare.

320
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:55,514
From the sea.

321
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,815
Warm roll, sir?

322
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,251
I think I'll pass.

323
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,920
Oh, take a bite out of that?

324
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,689
You know, you may want
to hire a new chef.

325
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,591
Oh, it's pronounced New Chet,
Doobs.

326
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,692
It's Dobbs.

327
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,694
Fish meat in a circle shape?

328
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,329
I don't want it.

329
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,197
Warm roll, madam?

330
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,433
Um, sure, I'll--

331
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,701
- Oh, wow. What's happening?
- [mouth full] Thank you.

332
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,369
I don't know.

333
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,873
- Comes with a warm cleave kiss.
- Oh, I don't want--

334
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,708
- Mmm.
- Yes.

335
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,877
Oof.
Smells like sex-juices.

336
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,512
No, I think that's the dinner.

337
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,614
- [wet kiss]
- Thank you.

338
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,482
Mmm.
Taste is still on my lips.

339
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,784
Okay.

340
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:34,553
- Hey.
- Mm?

341
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,522
I want you in me.

342
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,190
Okay.

343
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:41,026
Everybody's peen
in the room just went "doop"!

344
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,796
No. Not everyone.

345
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,098
Thank you.
You may go.

346
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,767
- Hey, Billie.
- It's not going well.

347
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,135

00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:15,254
but it makes me feel better,
and I thank you.

521
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,089
- Thank you.
- I'm happier because of that.

522
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,424
I'm glad I came.

523
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:19,892
- Yeah, thank you.
- Thank you.

524
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,527
And if you guys want a deal
on a private--

525
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,396
Oh, my God, dude, shut up.

526
00:19:23,397 --> 00:19:24,931
My God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

527
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:27,433
- Darryl, don't.
- Wait!

528
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,469
- I-I know the code to the safe.
- You do?

529
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,704
Yes. Point the gun
at me, White Marley.

530
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:33,272
Put the gun on her, please!

531
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,874
Oh, my God.
You are a dickhead.

532
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,709
- I know.
- Just untie me and I'll get it.

533
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,778
- You are a major one.
- I'll get you the code.

534
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:42,415
Just got to get something
out of my--saved it on my phone,

535
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,785
which is in my purse,
which is right here!

536
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:47,787
[yelps] Ah!

537
00:19:47,788 --> 00:19:51,457
Billie, that was the coolest
thing I've ever seen!

538
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,094
Oh, my God. McCallister,
did you pee your pants?

539
00:19:57,898 --> 00:19:59,732
Where?

540
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:01,901
On your [bleep] pants, man.

541
00:20:01,902 --> 00:20:03,402
Oh, yeah, that was me.
That's piss.

542
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,739
I love that you still
have the wig on.

543
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,408
So meta! Like,
you should do this "profesh."

544
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,343
I want to.
I'm getting headshots.

545
00:20:10,344 --> 00:20:11,644
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

546
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,012
Should get some on the freeway.

547
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:14,781
Yeah, be, like, in a shopping cart

548
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:17,116
holding a golf club.
All the looks.

549
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:19,152
What is this?

550
00:20:19,153 --> 00:20:21,187
Breakfast.
Just having breakfast together.

551
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:23,356
This was the plan?
You knew about this?

552
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,291
Yeah, and it totally worked.

553
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,826
He's, like,
the best actor of all time.

554
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:30,029
Yeah. I've been studying
at this actors repertory

555
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,433
that's also a cult
for about four years now.

556
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:36,236
I--this man held us hostage
with a gun.

557
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:38,271
Ugh, prop gun, you drama queen.

558
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:39,939
[gunshot]
Oh!

559
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,541
[both snicker]

560
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,443
[laughs]
Oh, my God!

561
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:45,545
We all could have died.

562
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:47,580
I was, like,
"That's real, that's real,

563
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,182
that's real, that's real."
- "It's real, it's real."

564
00:20:49,183 --> 00:20:50,783
You pointed it at her first.

565
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:52,085
- I know, I was, like, boom.
- Don't point it!

566
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:53,654
I'm sorry.
It's very real.
