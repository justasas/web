a date with a mom or something.

00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:13,012
Do you have any hobbies?

177
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:14,914
Yeah,
ice-skating and singing.

178
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:17,116
Do you have a favorite group?

179
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:18,651
Selena?

180
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:21,154
Oh, the--the dead lady?

181
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,824
Yeah, she's good.
I saw that TV movie about her.

182
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:27,827
Do you ever have that thing
happen where, like,

183
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:30,763
you're going to the bathroom
and your legs fall asleep?

184
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:32,031
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

185
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:33,299
- It happens to you too?
- Yeah.

186
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,940
Sometimes
I'm on the toilet so long

187
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,082
that I pretend that I'm on a talk show.

188
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:38,464
That's cool, *** it go?

189
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,666
Hello, I'm Dan and I welcome here
very interesting young lady.

190
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:44,971
Very pretty lady with curly hair
sitting next to me.

191
00:07:44,972 --> 00:07:46,034
Hello, Gene.

192
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:47,785
Hi, it's nice to be here.

193
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,300
What are you doing
dear today in the bathroom?

194
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:52,652
I just go to the bathroom, man.

195
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:54,488
- Me too.
- Me too.

196
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,137
Got any TP?

197
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:00,262
Yeah, let me pass it to you.

198
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:01,395
Oh.

199
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:03,761
It's too many... I'll pause the game.

200
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:06,383
So, did you ever, um--

201
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:08,518
did you ever
think about me all these years?

202
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,920
Pass the gummy bears.

203
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,221
I thought about you
constantly.

204
00:08:11,222 --> 00:08:13,123
Like, when you were
pooping and stuff?

205
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:15,125
- Sometimes.
- Gross.

206
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:18,095
I have to say that I thought
that giving birth to a child

207
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:19,930
would kick
in my maternal instincts.

208
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:21,431
Did they?

209
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:23,433
Well, this is the first time
we've been talking in 20 years.

210
00:08:23,434 --> 00:08:25,235
So jury's still out?

211
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:26,503
It took me a long time
to figure out

212
00:08:26,504 --> 00:08:28,705
that I could be
both a man and a mom.

213
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:32,109
Same. I'm, like, a really,
really, really good dancer,

214
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,511
but I'm also super pretty.

215
00:08:34,512 --> 00:08:37,114
- You are very pretty, Gene.
- Whatever.

216
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:39,616
So glad you didn't get
my dead chicken eyes.

217
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:42,953
- Oh, no, I got 'em.
- A little bit.

218
00:08:42,954 --> 00:08:46,056
- You see it?
- A little bit. For me?

219
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:47,824
Eat, eat.

220
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:51,229
- You're skin and bones.
- Bon appétit.

221
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:56,466
- Mm.
- You like it?

222
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:58,335
It's really good.

223
00:08:58,336 --> 00:08:59,336
Oh.

224
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:04,809
That was so violent
and awesome.

225
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:11,415
Ugh.

226
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:13,650
Looks like we're early.
Want to go around back?

227
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,526
Give you a little cat bath,
little butt stuff?

228
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:20,057
You can't just say stuff
to people like that.

229
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:22,159
Well, you know,
I'm sorry, all right?

230
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,627
But that's the kind
of guy I am.

231
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:26,596
I give little to no thought
to the things that I do or say.

232
00:09:26,597 --> 00:09:29,866
I just--it's off the top
of my head, you know?

233
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:32,169
South Dakota.
Cinnamon buns. Tawny Kitaen.

234
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,237
Did not think
about those words at all.

235
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:36,473
Salmon.
"Mamma Mia." English.

236
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:39,409
Lick.
Lick, lick, lick.

237
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,779
Lick, lick my.
I didn't mean the last part.

238
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,782
Ooh, no, no, no.
That was my favorite part.

239
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:49,052
- Nice foot kick, Ma.
- Thanks.

240
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:50,354
What else should you know
about me?

241
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:53,457
Well, I have a fear
of spiders and Pierce Brosnan.

242
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,459
Same.
Oh, but I like spiders.

243
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,160
Oh, yeah?
What's your favorite TV show?

244
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:59,763
"Transparent"
and "Vanderpump Rules."

245
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:01,598
- I love Vanderpump Rules.
- Isn't it fun?

246
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,833
- Yeah.
- Whoa, hey.

247
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:06,002
What the hell, Diane?
I asked you to leave.

248
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:07,270
Don't yell at him.

249
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:09,306
My name is Dan,
and you know that.

250
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:10,841
Your name is Kent.
I hate that name.

251
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:11,908
- I always have.
- Ah.

252
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:13,276
And how the hell
did you not see

253
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:15,145
- that I have been here all day?
- Don't yell at him.

254
00:10:15,146 --> 00:10:16,847
I have an extremely big house.

255
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:18,115
Now answer my question.

256
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:19,816
Gene told me that you said
that I could come back.

257
00:10:19,817 --> 00:10:20,917
I never said that.

258
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:22,119
Gene, why did you say that?

259
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,554
Don't yell at my daughter.

260
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:26,089
Gene, why did you say that?

261
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,591
It's my extremely big
house too!

262
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:31,661
Fine. What-what do you
want, Dan? Huh? Joint custody?

263
00:10:31,662 --> 00:10:33,130
You remember
what happened with Teriyaki.

264
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,664
Don't you bring up Teriyaki.

265
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:36,266
Ah.

266
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:40,470
We shared a terrier mix,
and then I lost our custody.

267
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:42,172
- Yeah.
- To a coyote.

268
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:43,874
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, that's correct.

269
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:46,977
Dan, I want you to...

270
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:49,079
- Stay in Billie's guesthouse?
- Leave.

271
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,014
I didn't know you had
that kind of aggression in you.

272
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:53,617
- Well...
- You used to be so passive.

273
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:56,220
Well, I guess
we've both changed.

274
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,222
Good-bye, Gene.

275
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:00,691
Wait, no.

276
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,329
Why do you make
all the moms go away?

277
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:10,734
Why do you make them go away?

278
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:13,070
- God, I hope she gets it once.
- Mm-hmm.

279
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:15,539
Ah!

280
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,375
I hate my life!
It sucks!

281
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:20,610
It's a sucky, sucky life,
and I'm gonna kill myself!

282
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:22,245
Shh!

283
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:23,880
I've got to do something
to make this better.

284
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:26,917
I totally messed it up.

285
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:28,785
I got to get my family
back together again.

286
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:30,420
- Shh!
- Oh, sorry.

287
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:33,757
They must really
hate each other.

288
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:36,093
Whoa, now they're,
like, in love?

289
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:38,095
What is the plot of this?

290
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:41,398
Oh, my God.
I get it now.

291
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:43,800
Love and hate
are one and the same.

292
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:47,337
Where there is heat,
there is a flame.

293
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,110
What's happening
to your face?

294
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,112
A plan.

295
00:11:58,349 --> 00:12:00,617
This is absolutely
fascinating.

296
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:03,153
I don't know anything
about this subculture.

297
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:05,055
Do you mind if I take notes?

298
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,156
Nah, go ahead.

299
00:12:06,157 --> 00:12:07,657
Thank you. There we go.

300
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:09,126
I got a little notebook

301
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:12,929
just in case I saw something
I didn't know yet.

302
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,631
Another round of homebrew?

303
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:17,934
Oh, hell yeah, Joker.

304
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:19,770
Oh, when.

305
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:21,038
Save some for yourself.

306
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,539
Can't, I got
a long drive home.

307
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,441
Well, have you
ever made non-alcoholic?

308
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:25,709
I heard it's a bitch.

309
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,810
Oh, it really isn't.

310
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:28,111
Yeah, you brew it the same,

311
00:12:28,112 --> 00:12:30,847
but then you heat it to 175
for 20 minutes

312
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:32,282
before you add your yeasts

313
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:33,984
- and your sugars.
- Are you for real?

314
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:36,687
'Cause that's some--that's
real strange knowledge to have.

315
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:39,556
Oh, yes.
In high school, I threw a party,

316
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,491
and I didn't want
anyone to get in trouble,

317
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:43,126
so I homebrewed some NA.

318
00:12:43,127 --> 00:12:45,095
No one ended up coming, but--

319
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,097
You two swing?

320
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:48,494
Do we swing?

321
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:50,762
You mean sexually do we swing?

322
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:53,598
Yeah. Joker here's
very gentle for his size.

323
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:56,280
Well, now I know
how you got your nickname, Jocker.

324
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:57,542
Do we swing?

325
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,239
I wasn't joking about swing.

326
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:01,537
Okay.

327
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:06,443
Guess who passed
the friend test, right?

328
00:13:08,764 --> 00:13:10,766
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

329
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:12,581
- Just happy.
- Oh.

330
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,244
Okay, 'cause your mouth
wasn't moving, you're

331
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:16,695
breathing sort of

332
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:18,673
look paintfool.

333
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,332
Ah. Again.

334
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,900
- Why are you here?
- Let's see.

335
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,068
It's my house,

336
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:27,103
and this is my backyard.
Why are you here?

337
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:29,572
Because your daughter said she
wanted to meet me here privately

338
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:32,408
and to be here at Steven,
which I assume means 7:00.

339
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:34,845
Well, I'm supposed
to be here at Steven, too.

340
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:37,580
- Ah.
- Oh.

341
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:38,948
Well, she really went to town

342
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:40,884
with the Christmas light
thingies.

343
00:13:40,885 --> 00:13:42,719
<i>Actually look kind of nice.</i>

344
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,522
I think she hacked
the Spotify playlist

345
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,257
of mine called "No Safe Word."

346
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:52,262
She also uncorked
a 1921 Château D'Prive Magnum,

347
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:55,499
which I will try
