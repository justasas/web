1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
- The best access site to quarry the stone is...
- Over there.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,200
We need to put the quarry on the
land where the graves are now.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,520
It's rich in sandstone. Quarrying
our own stone will save a fortune.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,560
Johnny Blackwood's innocent.
I killed Red Killeen.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,400
Red caused the explosion. I saw him
stealing from t'explosives hut.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,040
He killed Skinny and Jack.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,320
So I'll ned a spare key
to t'steam truck and the blast cart.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,720
There's only one and I hold it.
I've earned this position.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,040
There's been more then one secret
unearthed here in the past two days.

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,400
- I know what happened between you.
- Charles, I... I...

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,120
Let's set a date, Davey.
Make me an honest woman.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,440
Seems whatever I do, my life gets tangled
up with yours... Johnny Blackwood.

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,200
And is that so terrible?

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,480
It's not what I had planned.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
Is this the fair hearing
that your promised me?

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,360
- You set me up from the start.
- I had to give this town its justice.

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,360
You served yourself
into the bargain.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,240
You've got a week to work out
your notice.

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,200
And I want you gone.

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
You sleep safe, now.

21
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,400
Your quarry fella was right,
there's good sandstone here.

22
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,320
We've tunnelled through to t'rock
face.

23
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,360
Watch your step.

24
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,080
A great seam of it here, look.

25
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,840
I reckon we just saved ourselves
a fortune.

26
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,520
Congratulations.

27
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Listen here, all of you.

28
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,240
I need a team of men
to go into the ground.

29
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,240
You want to work a mine
where dead men have lain.

30
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,200
I know how you all feel
about digging sacred ground, but...

31
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,920
we'll pay a shilling on top
of what's regular. Aye.

32
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,600
I ain't superstitious like some of
these fools here. I'm in.

33
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,440
You look after yourself.

34
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,480
It's your last day, isn't it,
Mr Coates?

35
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,080
Yeah, just saying my farewells
to the men.

36
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,160
I reckon some of them will miss me.

37
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,680
I don't want you thinking
that I'll be one of them.

38
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,680
You meant to let these men string me
up, right here on my land.

39
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
I wouldn't have let you swing.
You're a gentleman.

40
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,360
I did what I did to keep the peace.

41
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,320
No, you did what you did to suit
Ralph Coates.

42
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,440
You think you can build a railway...
you and your brother?

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,920
You're just boys.

44
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,040
You think you can just hammer out
a mine in those hills?

45
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,840
You got another think coming.

46
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,840
It ain't that easy.

47
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,120
Charles... I have to leave.

48
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,320
It's better for everyone.

49
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,680
- Where will you go?
- To my uncle's for a time.

50
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,720
And after that?

51
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know. Does it matter?

52
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,840
- People will gossip, I suppose.
- Damn their gossip. I don't care about it.

53
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,160
I want to remain a partner
in this business.

54
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,960
But Blackwood House...

55
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,920
it isn't my place any longer.

56
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,400
I remember the first time I saw you
was in this garden.

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,640
Don't, Charles. Please, don't.

58
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,680
The sun.

59
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,720
It caught your hair so brightly
that when I looked away

60
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,480
I still had the image in my eyes.

61
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,240
There's never been anyone else.

62
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,440
I can't be the person that you want.

63
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,040
Better to admit it
than go on like this for years.

64
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,000
Please, tell me you're not going
to him.

65
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,000
So, this mine's gonna make you
a fortune, is it?

66
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,320
Aye. There's stone enough to clad
the whole viaduct, I reckon.

67
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Some of the men were talking...

68
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,560
saying this place is cursed.

69
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,280
Dagger, all this time Jack and Skinny
have been guarding a treasure house.

70
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,160
Folk will talk
if you get married in that.

71
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Good, then.

72
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
That's the idea.

73
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,360
Easy, easy. Whoa!

74
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,440
You'll rip it.

75
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,080
Look at you!

76
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,040
Behind that desk.

77
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,120
You look like a proper agent.

78
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,560
Trying to learn the business
as fast as I can.

79
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,040
Are you going to build this viaduct
on your own, then, Johnny?

80
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,240
Maybe I will.

81
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,360
What are you doing?

82
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,640
I come to see the agent to buy
what I need for the canteen.

83
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,080
Yeah?

84
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,680
It seems I'm going to have to
negotiate with you now.

85
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,360
Don't be soft.

86
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, don't brush me off, Johnny.
Let's do this properly.

87
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
I need a side of beef.

88
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
And a small barrel of molasses.
How much?

89
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,720
Just take what you need from the
barn, will you, and leave the money?

90
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,120
- You'll not make much profit that way.
- Come here.

91
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,200
No-one's watching.

92
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,600
I'm your customer now,
not your fancy woman.

93
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,600
Is this how you're going to treat
all the traders that come knocking?

94
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,240
- I don't think the butcher will be too impressed.
- No?

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,040
I'll leave you two alone, shall I?

96
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,840
I came to say goodbye.

97
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,920
You're leaving Blackwood House?

98
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,760
Yeah. Today.

99
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
This evening.

100
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,000
I can't stay here. He wants me gone.

101
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
I suppose you'll never come back
to this valley.

102
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,160
Why?

103
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Would that matter so much, John?

104
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,160
I was never any more than a little
distraction for you, was I?

105
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,680
Isabella... I'm sorry.

106
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,440
- Truly.
- I don't need an apology.

107
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,200
I'm not the same woman any more.

108
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,760
I've built a business.

109
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,920
And I'm determined
to stay a part of it.

110
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,120
You'll be seeing me again.

111
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Hello?

112
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,480
Hello.

113
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Anybody there?

114
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,360
- What are you doing?
- What is this money you've been keeping?

115
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,280
Tell me didn't you steal it.

116
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,120
I was given it as payment.
Honest work.

117
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,400
- Who by?
- Mr Coates.

118
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
He pays me for running errands.

119
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,800
You are still a servant here.

120
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,680
I don't get no money from it, do I?

121
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,080
They treat you well.
They give you a roof.

122
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,880
It's no better than a slave's life.

123
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,760
It's honourable wages.
Nowt wrong with it.

124
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,560
Oh, then, I'll tell Mr Blackwood,
shall I?

125
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,600
- Tell him that my brother has two masters.
- You can't.

126
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,760
This money here... was taken
from the body of Red Killeen.

127
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,000
Mr Coates give it me.

128
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,600
Come on, Dagger,
let's get back to work.

129
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Did you hear that?

130
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,040
Something's not right here, Johnny.

131
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,880
What's that?

132
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,320
Get out! Get out!

133
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,080
Agh!

134
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Mam!

135
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,440
- What's the matter?
- It's Johnny.

136
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,760
The mine's collapsed on him.
Dagger's with him.

137
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,480
I heard folks yelling.
We need to go and get the agent.

138
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,440
There isn't an agent any more.
There's no one in charge here.

139
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,160
If you're about to give me advice,
I already know what happens in bed.

140
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,200
I daresay you could teach me a thing
or two.

141
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,480
What are you doing, holding my hand?

142
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,200
Just remember, love.

143
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,080
Davey's your best chance
at happiness.

144
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,080
Make sure you make this one stick,
won't you?

145
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,040
What are you doing in here? It's
supposed to be a private ceremony.

146
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,520
Where's Davey? There's been an
accident at the mine.

147
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,240
Dagger.

148
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,840
Dagger.

149
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,800
Dagger, are you all right?

150
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,920
Annie, don't get too close!

151
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,800
Johnny?

152
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,920
Dagger?

153
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,080
Johnny, can you hear me?

154
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,560
Dagger?

155
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,120
Those Blackwood boys -
they're just children.

156
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,320
They don't know the first thing
about the work they're doing.

157
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,560
Hm. I don't suppose you can patch it
up between you.

158
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,680
Well, where will you go?

159
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
You've got family back home,
have you?

160
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,560
Not my business. Forgive me asking.

161
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,040
My wife...

162
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
she died.

163
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
I've got a son.

164
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,080
He's lodged with a woman...
who takes care of him.

165
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
And I send back what money I can.

166
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,320
Like you do for your boy.

167
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,480
That's why you've taken a shine
to the Quaintain lad.

168
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,120
Where will you settle after Jericho?

169
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,720
Who says I'm going anywhere?

170
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,920
I ain't done.

171
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,920
Push back.

172
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,680
Mind how you go.

173
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,600
Let the cart come through.

174
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,360
Come on, quickly.

175
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,960
Mr Blackwood!

176
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,880
The tunnel's fallen in.

177
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,280
The struts have broke loose
and fell.

178
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,880
Your brother's stuck inside
with Dagger Watkins.

179
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,640
It's not safe to go inside.
It could collapse at any moment.

180
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,480
Do we know if they're alive still?

181
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,729
We can shore it up again.
It will just take a while.

182
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,480
Mr Blackwood, I know that there's
bad blood between you and Johnny,

183
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,160
but someone needs to go in
and help him, sir.

184
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,640
Someone needs to go in there
and search for them.

185
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,520
There's no guarantee they'll be alive
when you get to them.

186
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,560
- I'll go into the tunnel.
- The roof is set to fall.

187
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,520
You could be crushed if you go
inside.

188
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,720
If there's a chance, we have to try
and save them before it subsides.

189
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Who's with me?

190
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,880
No, not you, Davey.
You're getting married.

191
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,480
We can't have you going down there
alone, can we, Mr Blackwood, sir?

192
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,840
Right. Let's get those men out
of there.

193
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,040
- Johnny?
- Dagger?

194
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,320
Dagger? Are you all right?

195
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,720
Say something.

196
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,880
I can't breathe proper.

197
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,240
I reckon you've got broken ribs.

198
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,320
We'll get you sorted as soon as we
get you out of here.

199
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
Does anyone know we're here?

200
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,920
Johnny? Johnny, can you hear me?

201
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,640
John?

202
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
There.

203
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,600
I should have told him I loved him.
I meant to.

204
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,640
Well, happen they'll drag him out
soon and you can tell him t'truth.

205
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,600
Thank you.

206
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
I'm so sorry, Mrs Quaintain.

207
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,520
It's kind of you to be here.

208
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,360
Well, I'm here for my husband.

209
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Johnny and all.

210
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,960
I expect you're worried
for both of them.

211
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,800
John!

212
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,280
John, can you hear me?

213
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,000
Charles! Charles, is that you?

214
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,400
John, are you all right in there?

215
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,280
Dagger's wounded bad.

216
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,120
We need to get him out.

217
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,320
Right. I'm coming.

218
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,920
The whole thing could give way
at any moment.

219
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,880
You'll be crushed under the weight
of it, Mr Blackwood, sir.

220
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,760
Quickly, Mr Blackwood, sir!

221
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,640
Move! Get out!

222
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
What's happening?

223
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,200
Where's Mr Blackwood?

224
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,520
We lost him in the tunnel, we did.

225
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,480
Some of the roof came down.
We couldn't get to him.

226
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,240
What? Do you think he's alive?

227
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,160
Please! Tell me the truth!

228
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,480
There's no way of knowing,
Mrs Blackwood.

229
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,640
Somebody has to do something.

230
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,080
Seems like you folks have a whole
lot of trouble on your hands.

231
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,680
There's a great wall of boulders
blocking the tunnel.

232
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,680
Mr Blackwood and his brother are
trapped down inside.

233
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,400
Want my advice?

234
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,400
Aye. Aye, we do.

235
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,560
The only way to shift it
is to blast it.

236
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,720
You could kill them all in there.

237
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,320
You asked for my expertise
and I'm giving it to you.

238
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,120
The thing will break apart
if you put powder under it.

239
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,560
- Let's do it.
- Davey.

240
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,960
- Get on down to the blast cart.
- Davey!

241
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,120
Mr Blackwood, he keeps the key.

242
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
I had a copy made. It's under my
mattress in the steam truck.

243
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,120
You're a fool.

244
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
You shouldn't have come for me.

245
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,520
I didn't want anyone thinking
I wasn't as brave as my brother.

246
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,440
Here we are.

247
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
My whole life I've been following
behind you.

248
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,640
Never as brave, never as strong.

249
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,960
You're smarter, John.
Smarter than I ever was.

250
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Here we go.

251
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,560
Not smart enough to save myself
from a premature burial.

252
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
We need to bind his wounds.

253
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,080
You're all right.

254
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,240
This is madness, surely?

255
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,560
It's the only way
to get them out of there.

256
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,320
They'll be right in the path of the
explosion. They'll have no idea.

257
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,440
This is the best chance they have
of not suffocating.

258
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,440
Get those people behind
the crow line.

259
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,160
Move back. Come on.

260
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,680
Tell me you're trying to save them
and not just bury them all.

261
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
What do you think I am,
Mrs Quaintain?

262
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,400
Move back!

263
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,000
Johnny ordered you off this land.
Everyone knows it.

264
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,480
There are only two men who are your
masters here, Mr Coates,

265
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,480
and they're both
in that mine tunnel.

266
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,720
It would suit you to bury them both.

267
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,680
Mrs Quaintain,
I don't have a master.

268
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,280
That man in there is my employer who
hired me to be a railway engineer.

269
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,880
And I'm telling you,
this is how you save them!

270
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
You just have to trust me.

271
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,790
It was my fault.

272
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,910
You mustn't blame Isabella.

273
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,670
Do you love her?
Tell me that much, at least.

274
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,430
What answer would make you content?

275
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,350
Do you want me to say that I ruined
both your lives

276
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,150
over an affair that meant nothing?

277
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,550
I never loved her, Charles.

278
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,590
Not for a single moment.

279
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,350
He found out about us.

280
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,310
Father, that is.

281
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,350
He was the one.

282
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,190
He sent me away to work abroad.

283
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,790
And he made Isabella break off
your engagement.

284
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,390
- I never knew. I just assumed...
- That she'd fallen out of love with you?

285
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,150
You thought that
I was just some profligate

286
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,190
who turned his back on his family?

287
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:17,670
What happened...
is he sacrificed me to protect you.

288
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,870
Come on.

289
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,350
We can't just wait
for the air to run out.

290
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,430
Holy God. They're blasting us out.

291
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,990
Get down! Now!

292
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,630
Mr Blackwood?

293
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,470
Is there anybody alive in there?

294
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,310
Charles. Charles.

295
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,670
Oh, no.
No, Charles, can you hear me?

296
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,070
Get him up on the cart.

297
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,190
Johnny.

298
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,830
I thought I wasn't going
to see you again.

299
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,990
You're a marvel, Mr Coates.
You saved them all.

300
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,990
I reckon we all owe you, Mr Coates.

301
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,150
Maybe you can find a way to pay me
back again.

302
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,510
Steady.

303
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,750
I need to go with him.

304
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,150
I'll come as soon as I can.

305
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,190
We don't want your dirty money.

306
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,910
Beer, is it?

307
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,950
Don't mind me.

308
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:05,070
It's only my wedding day.

309
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,070
You made it, then.

310
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,590
I love you, Davey Sharpe.

311
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,950
Don't you ever go forgetting that.

312
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,510
I've done everything I can.
I'll visit tomorrow.

313
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,110
Thank you, Doctor.

314
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,030
It's bad.

315
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,150
The bones are shattered.
The doctor's done what he can.

316
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,550
My body may be broken, but my
hearing's still functioning.

317
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,510
You don't have to pretend as though
nothing's wrong.

318
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,510
This viaduct. It mustn't fail.
I want them to carry on building.

319
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,790
- Charles...
- Stay. Please forget what I said.

320
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,830
I'm relying on you to do this.

321
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,150
Moving back in, Mr Coates?

322
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,590
Yes.

323
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,870
Just till those Blackwood boys
are well again.

324
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,990
You're to be married this evening,
I hear.

325
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,630
Are you free to attend?

326
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,590
Of course, Davey.
I wouldn't miss it.

327
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,150
Something else on your mind?

328
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,510
It's...

329
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,110
That key. The one for the blast cart
under your mattress.

330
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,630
Mm-hm.

331
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,430
Why did you have it made?

332
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,030
I'll see you at the ceremony.

333
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:52,590
I should go.
I'm a trespasser in this house.

334
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,110
No, not any more, John.

335
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,590
Stay. You need to be a part of this
family now more than ever.

336
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,190
Another accident?

337
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,070
The bankers will be nervous.

338
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,030
Someone needs to be by my side
when I meet with them tomorrow.

339
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,990
A Blackwood son.

340
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,270
I'm not the person to do this.

341
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:16,630
I need you to be with me if I'm
to take charge of the business.

342
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,910
Help me, John.

343
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,670
Do what Charles can't.

344
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,550
After today, you owe him.

345
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,230
I was hoping I'd see you alone.

346
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,310
Oh? What business
do you have with me?

347
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,390
I reckon you know right enough.

348
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,670
You stay away from my brother,
you hear me?

349
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:00,710
I'm the only person he has to look
out for him, so you do as I say.

350
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,710
Miss Epiphany...

351
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,910
a child has got to find his own way.

352
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,670
When I was a young man, I fought with the
North for the freedom of our people.

353
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,030
My regiment was decimated down there
in Virginia.

354
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,670
I was captured... and branded...

355
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,750
as a runaway slave.

356
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,030
You were taken to a plantation.

357
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,710
I know exactly what goes on there.

358
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,990
Young girl gets pregnant
out of wedlock...

359
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,270
no husband to look after her...

360
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:43,310
oftentimes the family takes in
that child, adopts it as its own.

361
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,390
It's a common practice.

362
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,670
Now, you just listen to me...

363
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,790
He's not your brother.

364
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,670
He's your son, ain't he?

365
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,350
And he doesn't even know
the truth.

366
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,590
If you ever tell him...
if you ever speak a word...

367
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,190
What are you going to do?

368
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:06,950
Tell master?

369
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:10,910
Don't worry.
I know how to keep a secret.

370
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,270
I reckon you can do the same for me
sometime.

371
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,750
You make sure he gets that.

372
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:22,790
The man earned it.

373
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,510
Martha? Is that you?

374
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,910
- Hey.
- Oh, I've been so worried about you.

375
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,830
Some of the women have come, love.

376
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,750
Brought some offerings for you.

377
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,510
Oh, where is she? Oh.

378
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:29,630
Look at her!

379
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,430
I've brought you some lace. Well, I'm
hardly going to bring owt else, am I?

380
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,350
This is mine.

381
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,670
I wore it when Jack and I got wed.

382
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,710
Here. Polly.

383
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,470
Oh, here.

384
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,310
There.

385
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,830
Oh...

386
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,830
Thank you.

387
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:03,150
I don't have much that's precious,
but here you are.

388
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,830
Me and my mam have made you
a petticoat.

389
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,230
Take them ribbons out your hair.

390
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,830
I'll not be upstaged by no-one.

391
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,670
My brother's sick.

392
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,990
They say he may not soon recover.

393
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,630
I promised him I'd do
what I could to help him.

394
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:47,950
You're going back to the house,
aren't you?

395
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,030
Annie. Annie, listen.

396
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,710
- Will Isabella be there?
- Aye, she'll be there

397
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,190
because she's part of the business.

398
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:07,430
But I've already told you,
I don't want to lose you.

399
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,830
So, you'll pay me a visit every now
and then.

400
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,070
I'll just be your fancy woman
in the valley.

401
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:14,150
I don't have a choice right now.

402
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,990
If I don't do this,
the viaduct will fail.

403
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,150
And you won't have a roof
or a business.

404
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,430
There must be some way
that we can be together.

405
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,550
What if...

406
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,790
What if we were to get married?

407
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,590
Hm?

408
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,030
Don't joke with me, Johnny.

409
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,950
- I'm the mother of two children.
- Aye.

410
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:59,390
Well, then, marriage it is, if you
want to keep things respectable.

411
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,510
I want us to be together
any way that we can.

412
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,990
Do you remember when you put
14 shillings in my hand?

413
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,270
It paid for bed and board.

414
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,270
And that was the only contract
we had.

415
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:25,190
- What are you saying, Annie?
- I'm saying I've found something in this town...

416
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,190
I've not had before.

417
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,350
I've found freedom, Johnny.

418
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,950
I... I don't think I want
to be just someone's wife again.

419
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,750
Not any more.

420
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,470
I'm sorry.

421
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,310
I love you...

422
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,510
Johnny Blackwood.

423
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,270
I do.

424
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,630
And I know you must go back home.

425
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,030
But I can't come along with you.

426
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,830
So...

427
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,270
where does that leave us?

428
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,110
I don't know.

429
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:19,670
What are you doing here? You're
about to get married, ain't you?

430
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:24,310
Oh, sorry. Sorry to bother you.
My boots need cleaning.

431
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,150
You erm... You got polish, have you?

432
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,550
Boy, you look nervous.

433
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,710
There's no need to be.

434
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,750
That girl of yours is a feisty one.

435
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,990
You'll be all right with her
by your side, mark my words.

436
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,710
Been thinking about
that key of yours.

437
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,990
Oh?

438
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,430
Red broke into t'blast cart.

439
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,350
But there were no sign of damage.

440
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,630
So he must have had a key to do it.

441
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:18,230
I mean... you had one made, so...

442
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,030
he could have one too.

443
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,270
Hm.

444
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:27,110
Still, he wasn't too bright, mind.

445
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,430
Maybe someone helped him to do it.

446
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,390
Or maybe someone persuaded him to
plant that powder at the scaffold.

447
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,310
Who'd do a thing like that?

448
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:50,030
Someone who would
see the viaduct fail.

449
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,270
Or maybe someone
who wanted advancement.

450
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,790
Men lost their jobs that day.

451
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,270
Hm.

452
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,070
It's a brutal way
to get a promotion.

453
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,670
Come to think of it...

454
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,550
you were one of those that
benefitted from that.

455
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,510
Aye.

456
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,510
And erm... you too... Mr Coates.

457
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,870
Yeah.

458
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,670
Well...

459
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,910
you got a bride waiting for you.

460
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,470
What's the matter, Mum?

461
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,830
Oh, it's just the wedding.

462
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,950
Don't mind me, anyway.

463
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,990
Come here.

464
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,550
- Oh, love.
- I can't believe he's late.

465
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:39,150
She'll be trawling round for another
candidate in a minute.

466
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,790
Aye.
