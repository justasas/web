1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,479
Ooh, Dr Lucy Worsley!

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,320
Ooh, interesting!

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,879
Go away, David Starkey!

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,639
Go away!

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,439
You have no place here.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,680
BABY CRIES

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,400
Ugh, you're joking.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,520
You jammy cow.

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,839
Henry Tudor ascended to the throne,
his Yorkish bride at his side.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,879
And that is Ken Thompson's
world-famous history,

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,039
The War Of The Roses.

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,079
Any comment from you?

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,599
Any insightful analysis?
BABY CRIES

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,399
No? Oh, God, here we go.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,960
Why paternity leave? Why?!

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,039
Oh!

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,120
Hello...

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,520
Yes, I do deserve them.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,439
Raaaarghh!!!

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,480
Hi, Ben.

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,199
Sorry, today's going very slowly.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,719
Still upset about Dale?

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,959
You pined for him for ages,
and then he came back,

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,839
head over heels in love
with someone else.

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,079
I wasn't thinking about that, actually,
but thanks for the reminder.

26
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,199
No problemo!

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,199
And, prepare for your day to be
turned around -

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,239
because someone is
getting a promotion.

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,679
- It's you!
- A promotion?

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,479
But, Ben, I never
applied for anything!

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,479
OK, so, Cathy is
retiring as office manager,

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,519
and Jane wanted a settled,
mother-hen-type figure for the office.

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,399
I looked her straight in the eyes
and I said,

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,639
"Rachel. The mother-hen
you want is Rachel."

35
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,079
OK, Ben, I didn't ask...

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,639
Almost 8k more, and there's a
guaranteed 12-month

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,239
full maternity cover, should you
ever, you know, want to settle down.

38
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,039
With someone.

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,839
So, what do you think?

40
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,959
- RACHEL SOBS
- Rachel, please, please stop crying!

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,399
It's unfathomable!

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,599
I'm interesting, Ben!

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,239
I've seen the world!

44
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,959
I've read Paulo Coelho!

45
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,439
I do not want to
be an office manager!

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,519
But you're an office assistant.
It's the way the world works.

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,799
I'd imagine that Paulo Coelho
was an assistant...

48
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,479
inspirational novelist!

49
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,679
But what if I
need more with my life, Ben?

50
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,479
Are we talking a sideways
move into HR?

51
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,520
No!

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,079
No, but don't dismiss it
out of hand,

53
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,160
it's got great career progression!

54
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
Dale?

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,039
When you were a businessman,
what area were you in, exactly?

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,599
Well, my boss, Mr Z, insisted
on secrecy in all his dealings.

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,519
A little quirk of his!

58
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,999
But I was across a few areas.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,239
Client facing, results oriented.

60
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,079
Sorry if I'm bamboozling you with
all this jargon!

61
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,479
Well, I must say,
it all sounds very impressive.

62
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,679
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, Mom, you're home!

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,159
- How was your day?
- Yeah, fine.

64
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,679
I hope you're hungry.

65
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,279
It's di shui dong
ribs with braised eggplant.

66
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,559
- Oh, sounds tasty.
- Always Ling's favourite.

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
Yeah, I'll probably just
have it in my room.

68
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,319
Something's up with Mom.

69
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,519
I mean, ever since I got
back from China,

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,599
she seems to be acting really cold
towards me.

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,479
Well...

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,199
It can be hard, can't it?

73
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,959
Getting reacquainted with people
you've had a thing with?

74
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,039
Oh, well, yes,
but not in this instance.

75
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,119
You see, before I went away,
Rachel told me

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,039
it was wrong that
I was in love with her.

77
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,599
So now I've found love with Ling -
who is amazing, by the way -

78
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,439
my friendship with Rachel should be
blossoming as never before.

79
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,879
Hello, my family.

80
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,639
Oh, someone's had
a nice day. Sid on good form?

81
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,119
Sidney was his usual truculent self.

82
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,759
But Daddy has found something to put
a spring in his step.

83
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,159
Really? What's that?

84
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,959
Ooh!

85
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,000
Tasty!

86
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,839
Ruby red and bright as a button,

87
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,639
a colourful trouser for a
happy fellow.

88
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,599
Who is this jaunty gentleman,

89
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,959
peacocking his way
around the Lichfield scene?

90
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,599
Why, it is I, Kenneth!

91
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,879
- You're having a mid-life crisis.
- Oh, shut up.

92
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,239
Feast your eyes on the rich
and velvety material.

93
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,319
Wow, are those traditional
costume, Ken?

94
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,879
Yes, Dale, as traditionally
worn by Laurence Llewelyn Bowen!

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,159
- I'm a shining star of manhood.
- I'll burn them.

96
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,759
You'll have to burn my legs, then,
cos they're not coming off.

97
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,679
Ha-ha, you did it, Dad,
you brought twat to the next level.

98
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,559
You bellend!

99
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,919
- Hey, can I have a lift?
- No. Where you going?
- Seeing Zoe.

100
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,795
It's a week till she goes to uni,
I think I can get to ten more shags.

101
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,479
But I have to see her every day.
Mum, lift?

102
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,999
All right, for young love.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,639
RACHEL: Guys!

104
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,199
Oh, God, it's like an omen!

105
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,239
Practically the first job
to come up, and it is perfect!

106
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,799
Since when are you looking
for a job?

107
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,239
Since I realised I couldn't spend another
day in that office full of deadbeats.

108
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,359
- That would be my office then.
- Yep!

109
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,479
There's a new position at this
ace human rights charity,

110
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,039
the Pegasus Alliance.
- Oh, Nina runs that!

111
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,119
Yes, that's Nina's.
She speaks of it relentlessly.

112
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,559
I'm going to make start on
the application now.

113
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,519
Oh, yes! Food!

114
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,399
- There you go, Mom.
- Lovely, thank you. Delicious.

115
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,679
- Oh, nice trousers!
- I thank you.

116
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,159
- Give 'em me.
- Never!
- You know I'm going to burn them.

117
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,079
- You are not going to burn them.
- Ken, I cannot see them, I cannot...

118
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,520
Ignore her! I am the red-pantalooned
Pied Piper of all women!

119
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,400
Oh!

120
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,039
Rachel, that is hands down

121
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,239
the most moving job application
I've ever read.

122
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,599
I mean, your desolate days
after Cuckoo died,

123
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,040
your nights of sleepless crying?

124
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,039
I don't know if I'm
ever going to be happy again.

125
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,639
I really appreciate that, guys.

126
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,479
I mean, I did put my heart
and soul into it, so...

127
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,759
Chief Ken, you have to read
Rachel's job application,
it'll change your life.

128
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,999
- Oh!
- It's the saddest book I've ever read.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,839
And I've read five books.

130
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,160
Really?! That good, is it?

131
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,959
Any criticism, however small,
is gratefully received, so...

132
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,480
OK, let's have a look.

133
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,319
It's quite full-on.

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,360
Yeah.

135
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,439
- How long is it till the deadline?
- Midnight.

136
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,399
Four hours? That's...

137
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,599
That's not enough time!

138
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,000
That's not enough time!

139
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,600
TYPING

140
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,519
OK, quarter of an hour to go.
Come on, hand it in!

141
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,039
Ken, how could it possibly
need this much work?

142
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,799
Don't blame me,
I'm not the one who wrote

143
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,039
a job application in the style
of Angela's Ashes.

144
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,119
- Dad, it says they're looking
for someone creative.
- Don't be so naive.

145
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,679
Creative means, "Will take less money
if they're allowed to wear jeans".

146
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,479
There. It's ready,
your dad has saved the day.

147
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,559
"I have good organisation and
experience of Excel."

148
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,199
Ooh, this one's good too!

149
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,799
Budge up, I'm just going to upload
it onto their server.

150
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,320
And... send.

151
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,319
OK, why isn't it sending?

152
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,360
Send!

153
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,279
Dad, why isn't it sending?

154
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,840
Well, hang on...

155
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,119
- Send it!
- I'll do it...
- What's wrong with this robot?

156
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,359
- Three...
- It's frozen. For God's sake!
- Two...

157
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,719
- One!
- Come on!

158
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,760
Midnight!

159
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,519
Oh, thank God!

160
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,439
Ah, there we are! Well done, love!

161
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,279
Well done. Close though!

162
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,759
That was close.

163
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,480
NOTIFICATION BEEP

164
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,879
"The deadline
passed at midnight on the 21st,

165
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,639
"we are no longer
considering applications"?

166
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,759
- What?!
- Bollocks!

167
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Oh, fuck you!

168
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,880
Oh, well, thanks a bunch, Dad!
That really helped(!)

169
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,160
What?

170
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,600
- No way was that my fault.
- Oh, Jesus, Ken.

171
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,280
- KNOCKING
- Go away.

172
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,439
Hey, it's just Dale.

173
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,319
- You OK?
- I don't get it, Dale.

174
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,239
Three years and not one thing has
gone right for me.

175
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,759
Am I cursed or something?

176
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,239
That is quite
the run of bad luck, huh?

177
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,679
First, your husband died in
the Himalayas,

178
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,519
then the website froze.
It's a double whammy.

179
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,919
Close the door
on your way out, OK?

180
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,960
Yeah, will do.

181
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,319
Hey, you know what Mr Z used to say
when a business decision

182
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,959
or something didn't go his way?
- No.

183
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,480
SPEAKS CHINESE

184
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,119
Oh, it means,
"The harder the battle,
the more brave the men become."

185
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,359
Dale, I don't know who's told you
you're a businessman, but as far

186
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,559
as I can tell, all you seem to do is
wear a suit and sunglasses.

187
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,799
Indoors!

188
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,559
I know, I have skills.
I can help you.

189
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,599
No.

190
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,640
Unless you can make Nina take a
late submission for this job, you can't.

191
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,199
You try your best to help them,
and what thanks do you get?

192
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,199
Sid's the most direct, he
just goes ahead and defecates on me.

193
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,399
Poor Rach.

194
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,879
First, Dale comes back, mooning over
some other girl, then this job.

195
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,079
She was really excited about it.

196
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,439
I know.

197
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,239
In many ways,
that job was her red trousers.

198
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,039
What sort of an evil witch denies
a person their red trousers?

199
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,639
I can turn this round.
I'll go and see Nina tomorrow.

200
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,359
See if the old Thompson
silver tongue can persuade her.

201
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,599
- You vomited on her.
- That was ages ago.

202
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,079
You punched her in the face.

203
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,119
- You completely ruined their
Christmas concert.
- Yes, all right.

204
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,159
They were more recent.

205
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,919
But you're forgetting that in a
previous, more pleasant life,

206
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,079
I was one of Lichfield's
finest lawyers.

207
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,359
- A professional in the art of persuasion.
- Ooh!

208
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,599
What are you going to persuade
me to do?

209
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,759
Hmm, well,

210
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,559
- I can think of a few things.
- Good!

211
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,079
Well, tell me about them
in the morning.

212
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,079
- Lorna, that's not fair,
you started that!
- I know.

213
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,480
Sometimes I'm all talk.

214
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,720
- KNOCKING
- Come in!

215
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,279
Ken!

216
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,639
Nina!

217
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,639
- And baby!
- Yes!
- Aw!

218
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,080
Erm...

219
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,719
Oh, golly gosh!
Look at your trousers, wow!

220
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,159
Getting a lot of trouble from bulls?

221
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,599
- I don't know yet,
I've been avoiding the bull farm!
- The bull farm!

222
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,280
- Please do sit.
- May I?
- Yes, please.

223
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,959
There we are.

224
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,079
So, I haven't seen you since you
ruined the Christmas concert.

225
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,239
Oh, Nina, I am
so sorry about the concert.

226
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,159
And, of course,
about the punch and...

227
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,280
you know, the vomit.

228
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,039
- You're forgiven. I'm not the sort
of person who carries grudges.
- Aw!

229
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,039
So, what do you want?
I imagine I will grant it.

230
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,079
Well, Rachel was making an application
for the job at your charity.

231
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,359
And - it's a funny story,
actually...

232
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,119
Ha-ha-ha!

233
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,359
Ah-ha. Erm...

234
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,519
She tried to send it last
night online,

235
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,479
and, Gordon Bennett, your website
was frozen. It wouldn't send!

236
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,879
- Oh, shame,
so she missed the deadline?
- Yes.

237
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,519
But I thought, never mind, print off
a hard copy and just bring it in.

238
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,280
Sometimes the old-fashioned
ways are the best.

239
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,639
Ken, no, I'm sorry,

240
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,879
- I couldn't accept an application
past the deadline.
- Oh.

241
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,839
Oh, no, she tried to make
the deadline, so...

242
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,799
No, yes, well -

243
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,079
I couldn't give
Rachel special treatment, you know.

244
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,960
Everyone knows how close we are.

245
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,720
- Do they?
- Yes, they do, Ken.

246
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,359
No, I'm sorry, it would be immoral
of me to read it.

247
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,560
Oh, Nina...

248
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,240
(Who would know?)

249
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,079
I would know, Ken.

250
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,120
OK.

251
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,399
OK, well.

252
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,999
It's there, if you change your mind.

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,559
No, I won't!

254
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,119
- I'm pretty sure you will.
- I won't. Bye-bye.

255
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,479
Hmm...

256
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,919
- You might!
- I won't.

257
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,960
Aw.

258
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,560
SIGHS

259
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,239
Dad?

260
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,399
- Ooh, I like those trousers,
Ken, Lord, I do!
- Of course you do.

261
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,159
- Mind if I buy a similar pair?
- Yes, I mind.

262
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,119
- Do not.
- So, how'd it go?

263
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,079
Bad news, I'm afraid, love.

264
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,039
Nina was completely unreasonable.

265
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,679
Oh, well.

266
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,319
Thank you, universe(!)

267
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,560
Oh, love.

268
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,199
Listen,

269
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,439
I probably just caught
her on a bad day.

270
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,319
It'll be all right,
I'll have another word with her.

271
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,439
Hey, listen -
how about I put Sid down,

272
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,639
then I go and get us some Magnum
out the freezer?

273
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,839
Huh? Go on, then.

274
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,159
Ben, do you want one?

275
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,760
Plain chocolate, please, Ken,
the almond ones give me hives.

276
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,960
HE WHISTLES

277
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,960
(What the f...?)

278
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,160
(Chief Ken!)

279
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,600
(Hey!)

280
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,159
A little something I'm
doing for Rachel.

281
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,679
It's Nina!

282
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,639
What have you done, you lunatic?!

283
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,719
It's going to be a
while before she wakes up.

284
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,319
But, when she does,

285
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,120
I reckon she's going to consider
Rachel for that job after all.

286
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,240
Please say this isn't happening!

287
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,119
Oh, bollocks!

288
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,279
Dad, don't promise ice cream
and not...

289
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,320
Shh!

290
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,959
What?!

291
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,759
Oh, my God! What's going on?

292
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,079
- It's Dale, he's kidnapped Nina!
- Dale!

293
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,599
Yeah, it's a fail-safe business
technique I learned in China.

294
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,119
Step one - put your intended
business partner

295
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,119
in a room with a bag
over their head.

296
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,639
Step two - they'll pretty much do
anything you want.

297
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,479
Like give you the job
of your dreams.

298
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,199
You kidnapped Nina for me?

299
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,439
You're welcome, Mom.

300
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,919
Now, we'll get to negotiations just
as soon as the chloroform wears off.

301
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,119
Chloroform?!

302
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,839
- Yeah.
- Dale, we could go to prison!
Kidnapping is illegal!

303
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,759
Well, not if it's
for business purposes.

304
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,079
Yes, it's still exactly as illegal.

305
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,239
Pretty sure you're wrong about that,
Chief Ken,

306
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,359
because Mr Z, he did
kidnappings all the time.

307
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,399
And if that was illegal,
that would make him a criminal!

308
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,159
Which he always insisted he wasn't.

309
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,239
Dale, you have done a very bad thing
here, do you understand?

310
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,000
- A very, very bad thing!
- Ken? Is that you?

311
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,439
Yes, it was definitely you.

312
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,240
I'd know your voice anywhere.

313
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,360
Oh...

314
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,279
Yes.

315
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,319
Hi?

316
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,199
Oh, God, where are we?

317
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,719
Ken, have they kidnapped you too?

318
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,239
Yes.

319
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,119
I've been kidnapped too.

320
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,479
I don't know by whom,

321
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,759
or why,

322
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,959
but... Oh!

323
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,199
MUFFLED: Ah!
I'm being dragged away now, Nina!

324
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,039
I'm being dragged away now!

325
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,079
- They're dragging me out now!
- Ken?!

326
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,319
- ON MONITOR: 'Ken!'
- You're insane! You're insane!

327
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,039
Chief Ken, I've got all covered.
Look.

328
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,999
'..If you touch
a hair on his head...!'

329
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,399
It's vital to track
negotiations at all times.

330
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,439
I improvised with Sid's
baby monitor! How neat is that?

331
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,919
It is very far from neat.

332
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,679
What the hell are we going to do?

333
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,119
- Dale, what sort of business
did Mr Z run exactly?
- All sorts.

334
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,439
- Clubs, casinos,
security services to local businesses.
- Oh, my God.

335
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,079
Oh, yeah, and he shipped
a hell of a lot of poppy extract!

336
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,319
Dale, I think Mr Z may have been
a gangster.

337
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,439
Right.

338
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,359
And I suppose Chun Pat was
a gangster too, and Sen Yi?

339
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,999
And all my fun Triad buddies?

340
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,079
You are shitting me!

341
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,439
I'm not shitting you.

342
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,479
- BEN: Ken, addendum RE:
the chocolate ices,

343
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,959
almond ones are still a no-go,

344
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,039
but I'd say a big yes to one
of the mini ones...
- Ben, shut up!

345
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,839
Dale's kidnapped Nina, she's tied up
and drugged in our garage.

346
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,839
Ha-ha-ha! Oh, you got me!

347
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,279
NINA: 'Help!

348
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,559
'Tell my children I love them!'

349
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,199
WAILS

350
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,439
Oh, my God, this is a crime!

351
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,639
I'm implicated.

352
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,639
The Law Society will be furious!

353
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,119
I need to get out of here.

354
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,239
Ben, stay.

355
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,759
OK, I'll stay.

356
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,559
We need to come up with a
plan here, people.

357
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,079
Golly gosh, Chief Ken,
if you're so worried about it,

358
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,119
- I can just take Nina back.
- Nina thinks I've been kidnapped too!

359
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,159
If you take her back,

360
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,319
the first person the police will
investigate is me!
- For what?

361
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,999
- It's not like we're doing
anything illegal, guys.
- It IS illegal!

362
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,839
- DYLAN: All right, losers?
- NINA: 'Help! Help!'

363
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,919
- Dale kidnapped Nina for me.
- That is extreme.

364
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,119
Cool.

365
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,959
- Right, well, I'll be in my room.
- Get back here!

366
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,879
We need to decide what to do,
otherwise Dale is going to prison,

367
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,199
and Ben and I are going to
lose our livelihoods.

368
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,519
Imagine not being a lawyer!
I can't, I really can't!

369
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,080
DOORBELL

370
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,959
Oh, it's you.

371
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,039
- What do you want?
- Just being a friendly neighbour, Ken.

372
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,399
We've had some complaints,
a woman was heard wailing.

373
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,519
Clearly audible from behind those
bushes over there.

374
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,399
- And who was listening from the bushes?
- I can't divulge my sources.

375
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,279
Seriously, Ken, what's happening?
(Is it Lorna?)

376
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,079
NINA: '..untie me from this chair!'

377
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,559
- Yes.
- Say no more.

378
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,199
Bit of 50 Shades in the garage, huh?

379
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,719
Nothing could be more natural.
Or beautiful.

380
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,959
- Can I...?
- No.

381
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,559
- I didn't finish. - You're going
to ask if you could watch. - I was.

382
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,719
Can I...?

383
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,279
'You won't get away with this!

384
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,719
'You mark my words,
you won't get away with this!'

385
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,879
Right.

386
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,239
We have to shut her up.

387
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,040
NINA SCREAMS

388
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,879
Oh, Ken, thank God!

389
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,519
Oh, Ken, what did they do to you?

390
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,919
RACHEL, AUSTRALIAN ACCENT:
Be quiet there, mate.

391
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,279
BEN, AUSTRALIAN:
You bloody stay there,

392
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,159
otherwise I'll put you on the
barbie, ya cockatoos.

393
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,800
OK, one of them's Australian,
and the other, I just have no idea.

394
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,599
Where are we?

395
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,919
It's impossible to say.

396
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,639
Stop complaining,
you pommy bastard!

397
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,159
Or I'll put you on the barbie,
you cockatoos.

398
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,079
OK, Ken, look,
just don't provoke him, OK?

399
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,600
Please, what do you want from us?

400
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,560
Why are we here?

401
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,600
You must have taken
us hostage for a reason?

402
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,199
OK, this is the way I see it -

403
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,879
me and my very good friend Nina
here are trapped,

404
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,039
so why don't you go
and talk amongst yourselves

405
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,919
and decide on how we can resolve
the situation, yeah?

406
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,159
NORMAL: Oh, good plan, Ken! Erm...

407
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,239
AUSTRALIAN: I mean...

408
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,400
Bonza!

409
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,119
Jeepers, Ken.

410
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,119
I don't know how you
remain so brave and masterful.

411
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,319
I mean, that was like you were
giving them orders.

412
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,919
Nina, you can't show them any fear.

413
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,919
That is the first rule of
being kidnapped

414
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,639
by enigmatic terrorist vigilantes.

415
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,759
OK, well, they've left us alone now,
and that was their first mistake,

416
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,839
cos we can talk, right?

417
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,719
So, I would say...

418
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,519
I think we're in the garage
of a suburban house.

419
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,839
- Or a lock-up, or a bunker.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
- Hmm...

420
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,719
Unlikely. I mean, look,
there's a ripper skateboard there.

421
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,559
My Neil's got one of those.

422
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,519
No, my guess would be

423
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,919
we're in a family home where there's
a son about Neil's age.

424
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,359
Stop guessing, Nina!

425
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,479
OK? It's a trap!

426
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,679
Everything in here is
designed to make us

427
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,479
think what they want us to think.

428
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,999
Believe nothing.

429
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,680
Trust no-one.

430
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,520
Ugh!

431
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,999
OK, so far, we have three ideas.

432
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,199
Number one - convince Nina this
is all a dream.

433
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,079
- That one's my favourite.
- Number two -

434
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,159
something about fridges.

435
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,999
Yeah, no,
that never really developed.

436
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,759
Number three - kill ourselves and
frame her for the murder.

437
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,639
- Yeah, thanks, Dylan.
- It's not all mine. I saw it on CSI.
- TEXT MESSAGE

438
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,959
- Oh, Zoe. Laters!
- Dylan, where are you going?

439
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,639
Seeing Zoe?
Got nine shags to go.

440
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,079
So, I have an idea, but you're not
going to like it. Go on, then.

441
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,160
What if we hand Dale into the police
and he takes the rap for everything?

442
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,399
Wow! That's great idea!

443
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,639
I knew there was a way out,
you brainy box!

444
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,839
Good job, buddy. I'll just go to
jail. How long will I be there?

445
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,919
Five, ten years?

446
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,999
I'll be out before you can say
lickety-split!

447
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,759
Dale, you do not want to go to jail.

448
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,479
You know what happens to athletic
young men in jail.

449
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,399
Are they made to do gymnastics?
Because I LOVE gymnastics!

450
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,799
So it's sorted then!

451
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,199
Dale, when you give yourself up,
make sure that you say that you take

452
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,479
absolutely all the blame
for everything, OK?
- No, stop, OK.

453
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,839
- There has to be another way.
- Dale is fine with it. OK?

454
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,639
Now, I'm just going to make
a little call...

455
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,799
Rachel, I know it's hard.

456
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,439
But you will thank me when Dale
is in jail

457
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,599
and we are not in jail. OK.

458
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,919
Quick, stop him!

459
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,440
Quick! Dale!

460
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,719
Ben, I know this is tough, but you
do understand, don't you? Yeah?

461
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,240
Sorry, buddy, had to do it.

462
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,439
BABY CRIES

463
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,359
Why is that baby crying?

464
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,119
What are they doing to it?

465
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,519
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO THE BABY?!
- It's probably nothing.

466
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,759
We just need to be quiet and...

467
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,759
maybe, in our hearts,

468
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,999
start to think about forgiving
our captors.

469
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,639
This could be the end, Ken.

470
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,199
I'd like to thank you for being
here with me.

471
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,359
- I mean, I had no choice.
- No, no, you have been wonderful.

472
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,119
'In fact, I've got a confession to
make. It's about Rachel.'

473
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,119
I didn't mind that Rachel got
her application in late.

474
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,839
Oh, well, that's excellent news!

475
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,359
No, no, to be honest,

476
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,559
'she just wasn't
really good enough for the job.

477
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,199
'I mean, you know, this is a very
prestigious position.'

478
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,839
We were looking for go-getters,
and Rachel skipped university

479
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,559
and hasn't really done much

480
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,559
'but sit on her arse ever since.'

481
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,959
'You know, we were hoping for a
certain standard of applicant, '

482
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,360
and she is very far off it!

483
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah. Yeah, must be
nice to get that out in the open.

484
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,360
Oh, wow.

485
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,439
I'm so sorry, Rach.

486
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,399
No, it's OK.

487
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,919
God, look at us!

488
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,999
You thinking you
were a businessman, and me

489
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,840
thinking I had any kind of a future
when it's already past rescuing.

490
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,920
Couple of idiots.

491
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,119
Oh, look, that must've come out the
bag the kidnappers put on my head.

492
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,319
A receipt?
I wouldn't bother with that.

493
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,919
No, it's fine,
I can read it from here.

494
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,559
"One pair of cherry
red trousers, 44" waist."

495
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,799
Yeah.

496
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,279
- That is quite interesting.
- That sounds like your trousers.

497
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,559
What trousers?

498
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,559
The ones you're wearing.

499
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,239
- Well, that's...
- It's odd that the kidnappers
would use your shopping bag.

500
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,840
Unless we're in your house?

501
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,879
Ken, I think this is your garage.

502
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,200
Nina, this is not my garage.

503
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,199
Ken, what is going on?

504
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,240
Nina, this is NOT my garage.

505
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,359
This is not my bloody garage, Nina!

506
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,000
I swear...
DOOR OPENS

507
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,879
Ken, it's Lorna!

508
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,359
What are you doing
tied up there, you drombats?

509
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,360
Ken, this IS your garage!
YOU kidnapped me!

510
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,879
Wrong, Nina!

511
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,679
- Really wrong!
- Rachel?

512
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:25,319
Yeah, Nina, maybe my CV is rubbish,
but you said I'm not a go-getter.

513
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,279
Well, how go-getting's this?

514
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,079
- I kidnapped you.
- What?!

515
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,279
I had to get your attention somehow.

516
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,679
And if taking you hostage is what
it takes for you to

517
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,759
consider my application, well, yeah,
I don't regret it.

518
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,919
Rachel, kidnapping is a crime.

519
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,559
Yes. Kidnapping IS a crime.

520
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,759
It's happening to women and children
in North Korea, Nepal...

521
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,839
Erm... Somalia...

522
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,479
- Haiti.
- Haiti.

523
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,839
And we should be fighting it!

524
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,959
Because, sometimes,
to fight a crime,

525
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,239
you have got to commit
a crime yourself!

526
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,759
Oh-ho, yes!

527
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,119
That is a beautiful thought!

528
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,079
Give me that job, or bloody hell,

529
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,079
I'll just had to keep kidnapping you
until you do!

530
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,599
OK, Rachel,

531
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,119
I'm having a hard time processing
your logic.

532
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,360
- Yeah, I get that.
- But, erm...

533
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,360
I loved it.

534
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,960
I think that is the bravest job
request I've ever had.

535
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,479
You've got the job! Ha-ha!

536
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,680
- Great!
- Hell, yeah!

537
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,559
Yes! Wow, Ken, I bet you were along
with this all along, weren't you?

538
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,719
I might have been.

539
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,879
I definitely was!

540
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,039
Untie me, now.

541
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,799
Do you know what, I always thought

542
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,079
you were a bit more of a comedian
than an actor, but you're both.

543
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,559
Yeah, group hug!

544
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,160
Come on! Aw!

545
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,560
I told you it'd work, Chief Ken.

546
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,319
Wow.

547
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,519
So I spent six months furthering
the interests

548
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,120
of an international
criminal organisation?
- Yeah.

549
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,799
God, it must make you rethink
your whole China experience, eh?

550
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,199
Everything you did.

551
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,319
Everyone you met?

552
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,359
Yeah.

553
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,199
Well, except for Ling. I
remain as in love with her as ever!

554
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,679
Hello, you two.

555
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,319
Hey, Chief Ken.

556
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,039
I've been doing some research.

557
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,319
Turns out you were right about
that Triads thing.

558
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,199
I was fairly sure.

559
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,719
It's such a shame.

560
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,759
I'll miss having a vocation in life.

561
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,079
Dale, Ken and I have had a chat.

562
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,359
Thing is, I could do with some help
looking after Sid.

563
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,559
And you clearly can't be trusted on
your own, so...

564
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,679
- So we thought,
how do you fancy being Sid's nanny?
- Aw!

565
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,159
- A nanny? Is that a real job?
- Sure it is.

566
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,239
You'd live with me
and Lorn, just like you do now,

567
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,119
and you'd help me take care
of my darling heir and shit factory.

568
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,279
Wow!

569
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,680
That's amazing!
How much would I earn?

570
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,039
50 quid a week?

571
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,560
50 quids a week?

572
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,719
- No way! I'm rich beyond
my wildest dreams!
- BABY CRIES

573
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,239
There you go, you can start now.

574
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,399
Roger that, Chief.

575
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,959
Oh, Dale?

576
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,159
You can do the night shift as well.
I'll get some kip.

577
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,599
I'll stay up all night!

578
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,519
This is going to be like a
sleepover, except I'm totally alone!

579
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,560
Goodnight, guys!

580
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,879
Dad, 50 quid?

581
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,520
Yeah, you are a tight stink.

582
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,159
Shit!

583
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,400
Did anyone untie Ben?
