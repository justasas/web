1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:03,836


2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,172


3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,107
Billie.

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,609
Billie.

5
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,010

Hello, my sweet.

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,346
Oh, my God.
Chet?

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,781
The very same.

8
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:18,117
Wh--am I asleep?
Am I dreaming right now?

9
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,352
You tell me.

10
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,187
Oh, my God.
You're so warm.

11
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,922
I've had my hands
in my pockets.

12
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,791
Are you a ghost?

13
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,360
Yes, 'tis I,
the ghost of Chet.

14
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,596
What are you doing here?

15
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,064
I've come to see you,
my precious.

16
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:34,434
Oh, God, you look so alive.

17
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:36,536
Go ahead,
you can touch me.

18
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:39,806

God, this feels so real.

19
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:41,107
It feels so right.

20
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,475
- What are we...
- Shh.

21
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:43,943
Okay.

22
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,246
O.M. gosh.
Stop, I'm gonna throw up.

23
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:48,047
Way to go, Brett.

24
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,583
This was supposed to be like
a "Scare Tactics" level prank.

25
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,452
Now you're, like, making love
to her--it's embarrassing.

26
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,387
What--what's going on?

27
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,489
That's not Chet.
That's Chet's brother, Brett.

28
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,924
Yeah, like Brett Butler,
"Grace under Fire."

29
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,826
ABC Wednesday nights,
9:30/8:30 Central.

30
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:01,327
They're twins.

31
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,463
Identical.
Except I don't have a lisp.

32
00:01:03,464 --> 00:01:04,530
But...

33
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,865
I mean, I don't have one.

34
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,634


35
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,302


36
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,870


37
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,640
<i>Ha ha!</i>

38
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,542
Yeah, I'm in town
for a couple days.

39
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,243
Thinking about investing
in a rock company.

40
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,912
- I like rock music.
- No, it's just rocks.

41
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,713
Well, that's cool
that you're stopping by.

42
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,015
- Yeah.
- Any brother of Chet's

43
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:23,149
is a new Chet to me,
you know?

44
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,884
New Chet Brett.


45
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:26,686
Welcome to CLANGENE.

46
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:27,987
You know, I'm pretty stoked
that you're into "Halo."

47
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:29,989
You must be a beast, sister.

48
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,325
I've killed a few stay-at-home
dads in my day.

49
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,327
There's this one guy--
oh, he's a total dickbutt.

50
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,262
He spams me every time
I get a great weapon.

51
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,398
<i>Did somebody say "dickbutt"?</i>

52
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,599
Dang it, Kerry!
Get out of here!

53
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,067
<i>Who's your friend?</i>

54
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,402
<i>Is he ready to watch me
pwn your ass?</i>

55
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:44,103
I'm Brett,
like Brett Butler but--

56
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,872
Pwn your own butt, Kerry!

57
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:48,074
<i>The point of the game
is to kill.</i>

58
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:50,743
<i>Maybe you need to get
your video game GED too.</i>

59
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,045
Is that a thing?

60
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,613
Well, guess what, Kerry.

61
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:55,248
I'm about to take you
to school.

62
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,749
The school of--

63
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,784
No!

64
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,018
What did you do?

65
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,220
It's time for class.

66
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,255
That is the meanest thing

67
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,823
that has ever happened

68
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,858
in the history of meanest things
ever to happen.

69
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,860
I think the Potato Famine
of '45

70
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,362
and bird flu
would disagree with that.

71
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,130
That sounds
totally made up.

72
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,099
Those are real things that you
would know if you went to class.

73
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,801


74
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,537
I don't care about
stupid potatoes and sick birds!

75
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:18,872
If I have to do
all this high school stuff,

76
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,506
I should get to do
the fun stuff too.

77
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,709
We just did Macbeth
with British accents.

78
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,379
"Is this a dagger I see before me?"

79
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,214
I'm talking
about the fun high school stuff,

80
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:31,885
like... prom or...

81
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:34,954
Oh, my God.

82
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:37,223
Oh, my God, you're a genius.
I want to do the prom stuff.

83
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,158
- I didn't say--
- Yes! I love that suggestion.

84
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,393
- Prom!
- No, I didn't give that--

85
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,461
- I should totally have a prom.
- Yeah.

86
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,129
You're the only student.

87
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,064
I'll ask other GED students.

88
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,634
It's already happening.
Brett, are you there?

89
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:50,136
- I'm in.
- You don't need a prom, okay?

90
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:54,040
Gene, I didn't go to my prom,
and I turned out...

91
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,243
I think a prom would do you good.

92
00:02:57,244 --> 00:03:01,481
Okay? Maybe you get
a little over-the-dress action?

93
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:04,284
- Or under the dress.
 Excuse me?

94
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,752
I'm not the one
who almost sucked face

95
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:06,986
with a ghost last night.

96
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,454
How you doing?

97
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,223
Okay.
You don't need a prom.

98
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,624
I'll play you for it.

99
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,159
You want to play "Halo"
against me?

100
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,262
- Yeah.
- I'm sort of a pro.

101
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,464
Damn, Gina,
you are good at this.

102
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,933
Yeah, I've got hands
on a rocket launcher.

103
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,334
Good job, Billie.

104
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,502
Yeah, I won a tournament
two years ago.

105
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,137
Best New Year's Eve ever!

106
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,572
Look alive.
Kerry just logged on.

107
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,006
<i>Why don't you fart-breathers</i>

108
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,942
<i>do yourselves a favor
and log off?</i>

109
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:31,244
Because CLANGENE breathes
farts wherever we want!

110
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:34,147
<i>I'm tea-bagging your friend.
She likes it!</i>

111
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,149
Where are the tea bags?
I don't see the tea bags.

112
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,283
Billie.

113
00:03:37,284 --> 00:03:38,318
- He killed me.
- No!

114
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,852
Not again!
My rocket launcher!

115
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,254
<i>Is mine.</i>

116
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,523


117
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,024
My rocket launcher.

118
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,526
Gene, relax,
it's just a game.

119
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:47,527
A game?

120
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,028
A game? Just a game?

121
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,631
Do you remember
what killed Chet?

122
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,800
A game, Billie, a game.

123
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:55,335
We can play again
in a couple minutes.

124
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,270
What's the point?
He already has all my weapons.

125
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,805
What else does he want?

126
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,473
My soul? My mouth?

127
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,208
My brain and also my mouth?

128
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,543
No.

129
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:06,012
Something has to be done about this.

130
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:07,347
Gene, why are you talking
like that?

131
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,681
Yeah, stop petting your hands.

132
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:12,852
And I know
exactly what to do.

133
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,455
First step--

134
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,056
Oh, man, poor Gene.

135
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,393
I know.
I'm worried about her.

136
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,195
No.

137
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:24,731
Okay, and hopefully
he's wearing a purple T-shirt.

138
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,132
Get him on the stage.

139
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,400
- What are you doing?
- What?

140
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,035
My revenge plot.
My prom plan. Nothing.

141
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,904
"First step:
Invite Kerry to prom."

142
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:32,205
Kerry the "Halo" bully?

143
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:33,806
Why would you invite him
to a prom?

144
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,441
Which you're not having.

145
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,210
Because, step two,
when he arrives,

146
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,378
we treat him like a prince.

147
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,813
Or better yet, a king.

148
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,715
A prom king, Billie.

149
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,818
Then, when he least expects it,
step three.

150
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,420
And you know what step three is?

151
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,454
I honestly have no idea.

152
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,924
Yeah, you do.

153
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,458
- You don't know what it is?
- Uh-uh.

154
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,327
We dump a bucket
of pig's blood on his head,

155
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:57,230
just like in that movie
"Carrie."

156
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,299
Okay, it sounded crazy
either way you said it

157
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,802
'cause your plan is basically
to invite your online nemesis,

158
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,004
who you've never met before...
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,240
- To a fake prom...
- Right.

160
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:09,909
Dump a bucket of animal blood
on his head

161
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,378
just because his name
sounds like the name

162
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:16,349
of a fictional horror movie
character/book character

163
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,917
that that happens to.

164
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:20,153
You know what?

165
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,654
Now that I'm hearing it
out loud,

166
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,356
yes, perfect plan!

167
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:24,724
Ha ha!

168
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,259
Okay.
You're not having a prom.

169
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,062
Is that permanent marker?

170
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,231
What? No.

171
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,767
Whiteboard's broken.

172
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,604


173
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:42,208
Why would something so bulky
be up so high?

174
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,676
Let me help you with that.

175
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,677
Oh.

176
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,547


177
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:48,781
There you go.

178
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,183
Oh, thank you.

179
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,385
I need this to advertise

180
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:55,188
the flavors
at my frozen yogurt shop.

181
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,556
Oh.

182
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,124
Peanut butter,
vanilla, green tea.

183
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,393
I don't--I don't own
a frozen yogurt shop.

184
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:03,129
- Who does anymore? I'm Hank.
- Oh.

185
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,431
"Hank" you for this.


186
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,433
Sorry.
I'm--I'm Billie.

187
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,036
Okay, so you don't own
a fro-yo shop.

188
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,772
No, I'm--I'm a teacher--
I'm a tutor.

189
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:13,773
I'm a tutor too.

190
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:14,841
No way.

191
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,643
Hand on a Bible.
Yeah.

192
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:19,345
Is it just me, or is everyone
like, "You're a what?"

193
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,781
Okay, can you get that Bible
back out here?

194
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,017
'Cause if another person asks
me, "Why aren't you a teacher?

195
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:25,685
Why are you just a tutor?"

196
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,720
I swear to God,
I'm gonna, like...

197
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,188
do something,
I don't--

198
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,658
- Preach!
- Okay.

199
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,626
They don't understand
that not every mind

200
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,862
thrives on
traditional education.

201
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:37,530
- Uh-huh.
- Can I get an "amen"?

202
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:40,400
You can get an "amen"
and then some.

203
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,203
I mean, my student,
she's like an adult,

204
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:45,205
but then she's also
like a little kid.

205
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:46,873
You're describing Atticus
to a tee.

206
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:50,977
She actually wanted me
to throw her a homeschool prom,

207
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,712
which is like, ugh--
- That's a great idea.

208
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:55,048
A great idea,
is what I said.

209
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:57,684
- Well, Atticus would love that.
- Oh.

210
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,586
And if you need a date,

211
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:03,790
I am clearly writing down
my phone number.

212
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,058
If you're free.

213
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,293
Oh, well, I ain't cheap.

214
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:09,662

Preach!

215
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,331
- Hallelujah.
- Oh, yeah.

216
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:14,334
Glory be to God!

217
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,269
- I'm not religious, by the way.
- Neither am I.

218
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,571
Okay, good, 'cause, yeah,
we're shouting in the store...

219
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:20,573
- Yeah, yeah.
- About Jesus.

220
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:21,708
"Hank" you.

221
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,812
Okay, so I posted the invite
on my GED chatroom,

222
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,781
Joy's gonna get the streamers,

223
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,950
and I'm thinking no band,
just my voice.

224
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,653
♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey, prom

225
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,288
I think we should get a band
for sure.

226
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,723
- That's so rude.
- I mean, your voice is great--

227
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:40,359
- Hey, Brett. Hey, Gene.
- Shoot. Hide it.

228
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,560
Oh, Gene.

229
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,629
Oh. Hey.
What's up? No?

230
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,565
I was thinking
about that whole prom thing.

231
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,367
Maybe it's not such a bad idea.

232
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,835
Really?

233
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,304
Yeah. I mean,
you've been working...

234
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,908
hard, and yeah,
you deserve it.

235
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,910
We already started making
a disco ball.

236
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,411
Brett!

237
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,712
Well, I'm a little upset
that you broke

238
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,481
most of the mirrors
in the house,

239
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,018
and this is very dangerous,
but points for creativity, so...

240
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,719
- Yes, point!
- Point!

241
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,054
Both: Point, point!

242
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,889
You don't actually
get points--

243
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,158
This is so great, Billie.
Prom's gonna be next level.

244
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,727
I'm talking, like, "babies left
in the dumpster" level.

245
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,896
Well, that's really upsetting.

246
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,565
No, that sucks.
Who thought of that?

247
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,900
And none of the pig's blood
stuff too, right?

248
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,602
Just--just a prom.

249
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,170
Yeah. I mean, totally.

250
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,672
Oh, my gosh, that was, like,
first draft ideas.

251
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,407
- Okay.
- Final draft is just like

252
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:31,276
me wanting to cut loose with
my GED brothers and sisters.

253
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,912
Oh, yeah, like,


254
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,647
Yeah. Cut it--

255
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,616


256
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,852


257
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,154


258
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,956
with my brothers and sisters,

259
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:46,191
Billie, now that we have prom
on the books and everything,

260
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,793
I'd like to ask you something.

261
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,027
Okay.

262
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,930
Will you--


263
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,365
Will you--

264
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,833


265
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,201


266
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,636
Gene, can you get me a Band-Aid
really quick?

267
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,104
- I'll get a Band-Aid.
- Band-Aid?

268
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,339
- I'll get some Band-Aids.
- Will you, um--

269
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,974
No, no,
your knees are gross.

270
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,675
- No, it's fine.
- Brett, you okay?

271
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:04,977
- Mm-hmm.
- You need something?

272
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,211
Yeah, maybe a couple slices
of brie

273
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,147
and some light crackers
and grapes,

274
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,283
just your basic
wine country lunch.

275
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,318
<i>You want me to go to prom
with you?</i>

276
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,488
<i>Okay, I'm holding an L with
my fingers on my forehead--</i>

277
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,790
<i>you can't see it--
but, you know, for "loser."</i>

278
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,460
Okay, got it. No, I don't
want you to be my date,

279
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,995
but I would like you to come.

280
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,631
Sort of a promotion
from enemy to frenemy.

281
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:29,067
<i>You and I,
actually hanging out in real L?</i>

282
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,203
<i>Am I getting
"To Catch a Predator'd"?</i>

283
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,005
Tell him he's getting Sissy Spacek'd.

284
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,172
Shh, stop!

285
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,641
Hemming and hawing.

286
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:37,042
Are you in or you not?

287
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,076
<i>I'm in.</i>

288
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,580
<i>Shaft-deep in your mom.</i>

289
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,049
<i>But seriously,
what time is your stupid prom?</i>

290
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,485


291
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:49,421
<i>- So--so what time is it?
- Oh, sorry, 8:00.</i>

292
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,924


293
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,425


294
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,394


295
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,929
Mm-hmm.

296
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,565


297
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,599
- Billie!


298
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,201
What are you doing?

299
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,169
First and foremost,
that teeth brushing song

300
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,370
should be on top
of the pop charts.

301
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,406
On a more pertinent note,

302
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,708
I'm here to finish the query
that was disrupted

303
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,511
by my unfortunately timed
knee accident.

304
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:15,414
Billie Brown, will you go
to prom with me?

305
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,115
Get out of my shower!

306
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,750
- Is that a yes?
- No!

307
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,751
No, it was?

308
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:20,752
Get out!

309
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,020
Faster.

310
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,224
I love your body.

311
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,092
So Billie gets
on the stage, right?

312
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,428
She announces
prom king and queen.

313
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,496
We get Kerry on the X.

314
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,965
I'm gonna do this:

315
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,267
"Drop the blood!"

316
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,502
And that's your cue to drop
the blood, got it?

317
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,172
Yeah, I agree.
Billie is rude and insensitive.

318
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,940
Are you not even listening
to me right now?

319
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:43,876
No, I don't even know
why I'm going anymore.

320
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,878
New Chet Brett,
you are my trigger man, okay?

321
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,180
You have the most important job,
so snap out of it.

322
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,816
Prom is not about being sad
and in love.

323
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:53,519
It's about revenge and shame.

324
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,356
Tonight, my enemy tastes blood.

325
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:00,225
Tonight, a war begins.

326
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,660
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

327
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,362
- Okay, well, that looks terrible.
- Not good.

328
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,997
- Can't go to prom like that.
- Here.

329
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,232


330
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,035


331
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:17,376


332
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,644
Come on, everybody!

333
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,713
Get behind me
or in front of me.

334
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:25,884
It's not a conga line if you are
not behind or in front of me.

335
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,021


336
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,891


337
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,660
- Not enjoying the festivities?


338
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:37,296
No, those people look like
they live under a bridge.

339
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,564
Looks like your date
didn't show.

340
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,465
He's coming.


341
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,768
God, I hope his student
isn't too buttoned up.

342
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,403
These people are just so ugh--

343
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,971
Brett, don't touch me!

344
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,172
It'd be fun
to take a picture later.

345
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,440
Where is Gene?

346
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,441
Oh.

347
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,444


348
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:56,615


349
00:11:56,616 --> 00:12:00,285
Gene, you're not in slo-mo.
Stop it.

350
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,321
There's no fan
blowing your hair.

351
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,089
 A breeze.

352
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,824
Don't talk like--
You're not in slo-mo.

353
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,259
- Maybe I was.
- You're not.

354
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,527
Did you ever think I was
for a second?

355
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,262
No, I didn't.
I said it right away.

356
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,830
- You thought it, right? Yes!
- All right, he's here.

357
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,699
He's here. Go, go, go, go, go.
Leave, leave, leave.

358
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,334
Okay, let me just fix
something 'cause there's a mess.

359
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,135
- Oh, what's wrong?
- Just rip your boobs out.

360
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,303
- Don't touch me. Go, go, go.
- Free 'em for prom.

361
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,973
Please, leave.
Go, go, go, go, go.

362
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,541
- Hank!
- Hey.

363
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:25,844
And you must be Atticus.

364
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,480
You are a young boy, wow!

365
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,282
I like to think that I have
an old spirit.

366
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,550
Okay.

367
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:33,285
- Uh, yeah.
- Oh, sure.

368
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,087
Come on in.
All right.

369
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,956
So where is this student
of yours?

370
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,359
Oh, um, the party
is in the backyard.

371
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,261
Great.
So should we head back?

372
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,795
- No.
- No.

373
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,764
- I mean, why would you say that?
- Yeah, why, Atty?

374
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,967
I thought you wanted to have
some fun with kids your age.

375
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,869
I brought your gluten-free
cookies and your inhaler,

376
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,237
so you're all set.

377
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,640
I don't want to go back there
right now.

378
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,708
Look, we drove
all the way out here

379
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,913
to this beautiful home that this
beautiful woman invited us to,

380
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,482
so what if she gave us a tour?

381
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,083
That'd be better--
I mean, good.

382
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,452
- That'd be great.
- Yeah. What do you say, bud?

383
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,787
- Okay.
- Okay.

384
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,422
- Okay.
- Yes!

385
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:13,392
Look at us,
like we're a little family.

386
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,461
I'm just kidding. That's a joke.
Although we could be.

387
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,465
Just--all going up
to our separate bedrooms.

388
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,467
Except for us.
We'd have the same bedroom.

389
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,436


390
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,839
Whoo!
We're gonna live forever!

391
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,242
Or a few good solid years.

392
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,844
Yeah?

393
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,213
Mm. Boo.

394
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,982
Who requested
lame "fall in love" music?

395
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,383
It's for chumps.

396
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,384
Gene!

397
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,485
Huh?

398
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,488
It's me, dickhole.

399
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,656
It's Kerry.

400
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,825
Kerry?

401
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,260
You're here.

402
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,829
And that is what you look like.

403
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,832


404
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,201


405
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,248
Hey.

406
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,841
And last but not least,
this is Gene's room.

407
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,709
Awesome, "Halo"!

408
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,478
Oh.

409
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,181
Don't you want to go down
and meet everyone at the party?

410
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,917
You know what? Let him play
for a little of bit.

411
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,351
- Really?
- Yeah, we can just, uh,

412
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,686
"Hank" out on the bed.

413
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,521

Sorry, last one.

414
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,089
- Thanks, Billie.
- No, "Hank" you.

415
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,724
- Okay, that's plenty, really.
- Okay.

416
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,761
Hey, so, great party.

417
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:26,431
Everyone seems
real bombed or...

418
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,766
blitzed.

419
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,368
Yeah, there's alcohol
available here.

420
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,338
Right.

421
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,372
Cool pizza.

422
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,042
We got that.
We bought it.

423
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,577
- Chill.
- Yeah.

424
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:41,246
[sighs]

425
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,181
I'm sorry
I'm so awkward.

426
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,083
No, I'm sorry
I'm so pretty.

427
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,619
But you are.

428
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,221
What?

429
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,555
Why are you being
so nice to me?

430
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,524
You're, like, so mean to me
in game.

431
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:55,393
I know. I'm sorry, I probably
a little too hard on girls...

432
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,095
- Sexist.
- That I like.

433
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,396
- Sexy.
- Dance with me?

434
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,266
Aren't we already?

435
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,336
I mean, he doesn't hang out
one-on-one

436
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,838
with anyone besides me.

437
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,207
In hindsight, this might have
been too much too soon.

438
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,443
Well, if it makes you
feel better,

439
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,713
I'd rather be up here with you
than down there with those...

440
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:18,383
teenaged people with their memes
and their hashtags

441
00:15:18,384 --> 00:15:20,952
and Drake--Drakes.

442
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,989
Well, uh, maybe next time
it can just be us.

443
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,358

Can I get an "amen"?

444
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,626
Amen.

445
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,561
Okay.

446
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,896
You can get a kiss too.

447
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,197
Okay.

448
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,499
Oh, wait.
Where's Atticus?

449
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,001
Oh, this is awesome.

450
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,736
He must have gone
down to the party.

451
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,304
We should spy on him.
Come on.

452
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,306
No! I mean, nah.

453
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:45,377
Uh, you know what?
We don't want to compromise--

454
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:49,247
If he sees you,
it could ruin his sociali--

455
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,217
I'll go and spy on him.

456
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,353
You stay up here.

457
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,690
And I will report back
to headquarters,

458
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,826
- Mrs. Moneypenny.


459
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,427
- James Bond style.
- Yeah.

460
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,331


461
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,567
This is actually really fun.

462
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,602
I'm--I'm having a time.

463
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:12,571
People usually say, like,
"good" or "great"

464
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:13,839
in front of the word "time."

465
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,973
That too.

466
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,075
- Could I see you again?
- What?

467
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,411
I'm sorry,
that was probably really abrupt.

468
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,013
Like I said, I'm not too good
at this kind of situ--

469
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,982
Shh.

470
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,984
That's boob for "yes."

471
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,252
You hear me?

472
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,453
Loud and clear.

473
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,590
Squeeze if you can hear me.

474
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,792
Yeah.
I hear you too.

475
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:34,994


476
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,865
Atticus, what are you doing?

477
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,334
I thought you said you were shy!

478
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,368
Tammy, right?

479
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,369
Billie.

480
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,204
Yeah, **** off.

481
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,039
You're drunk.
Don't do that.

482
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,307
Wait, what is this?

483
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,877
This is the prom?
Who are these people?

484
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:55,547
O... kay, I think there's been
a little miscommunication.

485
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,015
What's this in your hand?

486
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,119
Did you eat gluten?
Unbelievable!

487
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,387
Oh!

488
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,124
Oh, you vomited
on her pregnancy.

489
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,526
Don't make out with her
after you vomit.

490
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,594
Oh, no, stop.
Stop.

491
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,229
She's pregnant, by the way.

492
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,398
That's not just beer bloat.

493
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:17,402


494
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,805
- What's that for?


495
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:23,441
A bucket of... confetti.

496
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,110
You know what?
I think the night is over.

497
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,778

498
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,313
I thought you were
someone else.

499
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,382
No, no, no. I'm a tutor.
Fro-yo shop, preach!

500
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:32,617
No, I'm not doing
any more church bits with you.

501
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,554
Would it be
too crazy romantical

502
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,589
if I just kissed you
right now?

503
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,725
Does this answer
your question?

504
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,294
- Oh, you have blood.
- What?

505
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,829
- Blood?
- Uh-huh.

506
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,131
Oh, I'm so sorry.
This is really embarrassing.

507
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,899
It happens
when I get too excited.

508
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,267
No, that's okay.

509
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,102
Confetti really makes it
a party, no?

510
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,839
I don't have time
for this conversation right now.

511
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,607
It's just
a little bit of blood.

512
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,977
Blood, blood.
NCB, abort the mission!

513
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,512
- Not now, Gene.
- Yeah, not ever!

514
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,913
What's that?

515
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,914
What's what?

516
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,349
- Hold on.
- No.

517
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,251
- Okay, but--
- Come on, Atty, come on.

518
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,686
Excuse me, sir.

519
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,187
I think you need
to calm your roll

520
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,922
when speaking to a lady
of such physical beauty.

521
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,257
- Brett, please don't.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

522
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,359
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
What, son?

523
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,861
You want some of this?

524
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,762
Let me tell you something,
friend.

525
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,564
I Krav Maga daily.

526
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,700
I'm confused.
Am I your son or your friend?

527
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:24,736
We're out of here!
Come on, Atticus.

528
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:26,671
- Let's get your EpiPen. Come on.
- Doesn't make any sense.

529
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,573
- Later, bitch.
- Bitch?

530
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:33,011
At least I can digest
wheat flour, son.

531
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,747
Well, that's what I get
for listening to Gene,

532
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,517
a backyard full of weirdos
and the guy that I like leaving,

533
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,719
thinking I'm pathetic, which...

534
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,955
I totally am.

535
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,624
I don't think
you're pathetic.

536
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,791
Thanks, Brett.

537
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,593
That guy might though.

538
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,129
Thanks, Brett.

539
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,732
Okay, well,
I guess that's my cue

540
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,433
that the evening is over,
so...

541
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,269
Wait, aren't you gonna
announce the king and queen?

542
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,970
Are they still doing that?

543
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,205
Yes.

544
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,273
Did anyone vote?

545
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,541
No.

546
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,709
Cool.

547
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,712


548
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,716


549
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,719


550
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,591


551
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,994
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Good-bye.

552
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,664


553
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,667
And the winner is
Gene and Kerry.

554
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,935
Confetti!

555
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:33,738


556
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:37,275
No!

557
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,911


558
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,918
What the ****?

559
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,788
What the ****?

560
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,591
Is it blood?

561
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,360
It's blood?

562
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:58,697
My bangs is blood!

563
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,765
My bangs blood!

564
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:04,035
I am so, so, so, so sorry.

565
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,004
Brett, what did you do?

566
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,405
Why did you drop the blood?

567
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,741
- Drop the blood?
- No!

568
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,677


569
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,745
Ah.

570
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,914
Why did you have
an extra bucket?

571
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,116
I got a deal.

572
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:21,052
You guys look like
that "Carrie" movie.

573
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,287
Which movie, Kerry?

574
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,856
The blood one.

575
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,058
Throw a plasma grenade
on the ground,

576
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,426
another one in front of it.

577
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,629
Basically you have
a grenade launcher.

578
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,964
Oh, my gosh, you're so much
better as a frenemy.

579
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,233
Maybe I could be
your boyfrienemy.

580
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,802
What?

581
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,136
Hey, Billie,

582
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:39,905
even though
I poured blood all over you

583
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,873
and I saw you naked
and you probably hate me,

584
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,109
this is the best date
I've ever had.

585
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,110
Me too.

586
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,211
Really?

587
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,880
If I'm being honest, no.

588
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,449
Oh, my God, is that pig's blood
that I got on your knees?

589
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,218
Nah, I just got
super duper sweaty,

590
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,687
and my Band-Aids fell off.
