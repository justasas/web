00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,923
- Really?
- Yeah.

179
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:35,061
I mean, we were, and then he
got together with Mariah Carey.

180
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,796
But I think that's off.

181
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:38,898
Are you talking
about Nick Cannon?

182
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,768
I don't want to talk
about it.

183
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,504
Point is, it's tough
to find someone

184
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,906
who measures up
to your dad, right?

185
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,441
What is this?

186
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,443
It's from Mexico.
It's an antique.

187
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,944
Can I put it on
for a second?

188
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,646
- Is this cool?
- It's not clothes.

189
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,481
Oh, my God. It fits.

190
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,916
I should totally have this.

191
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,818
Yeah, I'll hang on to it
for you.

192
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,453
Oh, yeah.
You can borrow it, sure.

193
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,488
Thank you.

194
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,023
You really love
your dad, huh?

195
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,658
Yeah,
he's the frickin' best.

196
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,926
Are you kidding me?

197
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,639
He, like, bails me out
when I'm in trouble,

198
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,463
and he gets me cool stuff,

199
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,932
and he totally did
a commercial with a monkey.

200
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,401
My grandfather
died in those.

201
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,435
Can I?

202
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,303
[cell phone ringing]
Oh, sh-

203
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,307
The acting monkey was like,
"Places and set."

204
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,644
- Uh, Moishe's Gold Emporium.
- Back to one.

205
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:26,646
Moishe's Gold Emporium.
Uh, wrong number.

206
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,782
I know this before we even talk.
Shalom.

207
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,784
Oh, my gosh.

208
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,920
Was that a prank in reverse?

209
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,055
I'm in. I'm totally in.
What do I do?

210
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,623
No, I'm--
You're not in.

211
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,526
I'm evading
my student loan payments.

212
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,494
What?

213
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:44,797
I mean, if you owe 'em money,
you just pay it.

214
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,567
Yeah, but I don't have it.

215
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,936
[laughs]

216
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,338
Very funny.

217
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,973
- Can I have--
- This scarf doesn't work.

218
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,641
It's not a scarf.
It's dashiki pants.

219
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,976
What?

220
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,544
It's traditional
African garb.

221
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,746
Can I please--

222
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,280
Is there something
in your mouth?

223
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,282
My tongue and my teeth.

224
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,884
It's like you're allergic
to saying 'em.

225
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,586
"Daishiki."
How do you say it?

226
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,454
- "Da-shiki."
- Can I please--

227
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,287
- Oh, can I have this?
- Oh, yeah.

228
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:11,924
These actually I do want you
to pick up.

229
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:15,661
These are these really fun
aptitude tests I found

230
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,863
that I think we're
gonna start out with.

231
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,931
Wait, start me off with what?
What are you talking about?

232
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,400
For prepping
for the GED.

233
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,902
[laughs]

234
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,537
You got me again.

235
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,439
You're good.
Burn, sister.

236
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:28,508
Zzz-zzz.
You're on fire.

237
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,842
'Cause you're here
to be my friend.

238
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,644
That's why you were hired.

239
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,748
No, I'm being paid
to be your teacher.

240
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,484
What?

241
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,820
That's not funny
to joke about.

242
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,889
Are your parents
going somewhere?

243
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,023
I don't--

244
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,892
I just got here.
They can't--

245
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,960
Mr. Russell.
Mr. Russell.

246
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,996
Oh, hey, Bill.
How's the guesthouse?

247
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,328
Oh, it's great.

248
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,965
Are you leaving?
Where are you going?

249
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,901
I don't know--
You [bleep] my dragons?

250
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,437
Aww. She took
her Ambien too early.

251
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,338
No, we are going to Japan

252
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,274
for three days
for a breathing workshop.

253
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,644
Yeah, I'm confident
you can handle everything.

254
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,579
Just make Gene
stays out of trouble.

255
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:08,279
You're leaving?

256
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,582
Oh, forgot to tell you.

257
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:10,883
Quick, come give me a hug.

258
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,619
[ankle monitor beeping]
Oh, kiddo.

259
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,421
I'll get you next time.

260
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,590
Air hug.

261
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,525
Yeah, let's go, Blaine.

262
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,594
No, but wait.
I don't know what I'm doing.

263
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,565
Busy guy, huh?

264
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,835
Yeah, he's the best.

265
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:33,573
You know, school doesn't
technically start till Monday.

266
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,309
- It is Saturday.
- So?

267
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,311
Maybe you could have
a couple friends over,

268
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:42,915
pop in a movie--
real chill, low-key style.

269
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,784
Yeah. I mean,
I could be down with that.

270
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,754
- Yeah.
- Hey!

271
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,322
Call me Beethoven,
'cause I can't hear you!

272
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:55,728
[all cheering] Gene!

273
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,730
You said this was just
gonna be a couple of fr--

275
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:00,733

Oh, my God. Okay.

278
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,304
Guys, take
whatever you want.

279
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,706
Whatever you can carry,
you can take.

280
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,641
Okay. Hey, Gene.

281
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:09,709
Can I talk to you
for a second?

282
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:10,810
Huh? No.

283
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:12,645
Ow! That's my bicep!

284
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,680
My bicep hurts.

285
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,583
Hey, I just wanted to say
this is a really cool party.

286
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,752
Someone puked in my hair.
I'm having a really fresh time.

287
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,554
Oh, cool. Nice. Really?

288
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,322
No, not really.

289
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,690
Someone puked in my hair.

290
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,992
I'm not having a fresh time.

291
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,760
That's a wonderful thing
to happen.

292
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,762
It's like a bird [bleep] on you.
It's good luck.

293
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,030
If you don't get rid
of these people,

294
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,465
I'm gonna call the police.

295
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,498
Eh!

296
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:34,834
Okay, well,
calling the police

297
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,969
would be the least
fresh thing you could do.

298
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,303
Do you hear me?
Top of the list.

299
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,942
Ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

300
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,744
Um, are you okay?

301
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:45,978
Yes, I will sleep with you.

302
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,311
What? No, no.

303
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,874
Why does everyone
want to touch my face?

304
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:49,982
Hey, bud.
How's it going?

305
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,651
I didn't know
you were here.

306
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,920
Billie, this is Chet.
He's my best non-sexual friend.

307
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,788
He lives next door.
He's got a big fanny.

308
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,658
I don't.
I have a normal-sized fanny.

309
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,926
Oh, okay.
Will you excuse me?

310
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,360
The puke that's in my hair

311
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,831
is running down my body
and filling my shoes.

312
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,699
What is happening
to me right now?

313
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:07,733
What?

314
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:09,535
I think I have
a girlfriend.

315
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,971
Well, news report--your
girlfriend is totally not cool.

316
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,274
She was cool for, like,
a hot second, and then--

317
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,610
You know what?

318
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,746
I think we just need
to give her a little push.

319
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,979
- I'll give her a push.
- Yeah.

320
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,348
- In the bush.
- No.

321
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,449
With my penis.

322
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,418
No, I think
I have a better idea.

323
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,887
Okay. But the penis plan
is still on the table, right?

324
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,955
- The penis plan?
- Yeah.

325
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,356
It's solid.

326
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,289
I mean, I feel like
it's foolproof.

327
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,026
- Right?
- Yeah.

328
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,894
Sizzurp!

329
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,896
Oh, nice.
Do you want some salad?

330
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,331
- Yeah, I would love some.
- Yeah.

331
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,600
Please leave.

332
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,502
People live here, and I need
to clean the kitchen.

333
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,703
We live here.
Oh, my God.

334
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:46,972
Oh, God!

335
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:48,740
Don't be racist.

336
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,176
I wasn't--I didn't--

337
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:52,844
I'm not being racist--

338
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,113
Billie.
I see you met Ting Poo.

339
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,815
Oh, my God.

340
00:11:56,848 --> 00:12:01,019
Why is there a ponytail
in the sink?

341
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,087
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

342
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,622
Slow your brain wheels.

343
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:04,656
You're freaking out.

344
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:07,092
Hey, I've got an idea.
Let me French-kiss you.

345
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,693
- No!
- What?

346
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,195
Gene, you said
this was just gonna be

347
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:11,997
a couple of girlfriends.

348
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,833
Yeah. Relax.
I've got it under control, okay?

349
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,835
If anyone gets out of line,
Ting Poo has a gun.

350
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:18,303
You have a gun?

351

00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:00,004
Yes, it is, and then they
have amazing dance sex.

530
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,372
Oh, my God, remember
when she goes behind him

531
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,540
and grabs his butt?

532
00:19:02,573 --> 00:19:03,975
It was, like, role reversal.

533
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:05,243
Totally. Whoo.

534
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:07,478
- Say you'll stay.
- No!

535
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:10,114
No, look, I am not
Patrick Swayze, Gene.

536
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,883
I am the older,
disapproving sister

537
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,251
who never did another movie.

538
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:14,419
Yes, she did.

539
00:19:14,452 --> 00:19:16,287
She played Kevin's mom
in "Dishdogz."

540
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,822
- Sounds made up.
- Google it.

541
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:18,656
"Dishdogz" with a Z.
[siren wailing]

542
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,225
You hear that, Gene?
That's for you.

543
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,027
Maybe it's not, Billie.

544
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,896
Maybe it's
for Angelina Jolie.

545
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:28,433
Maybe she did murder
Brad Pitt.

546
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:30,201
- God damn it!
- What are you doing?

547
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:31,502
- Move.
- Oh.

548
00:19:31,536 --> 00:19:33,404
Move again.

549
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,273
Get off your bike.

550
00:19:35,306 --> 00:19:38,242
We're going to get you home.
Help me!

551
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:40,912
Oh, okay.
What is in here, rocks?

552
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:43,314
Drop it, drop it, drop it.

553
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:44,347
[police radio chatter]

554
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:45,516
Oh, [bleep]!

555
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,751
Okay, follow my lead.

556
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:50,721
Be invisible.
Go, go, go.

557
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:52,657
Oh, farts, Billie.

558
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,792
- I'll handle this.
- What? What are you doing?

559
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,260
I'm just gonna
go talk to them

560
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,463
and explain what happened--
it's no big deal.

561
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:01,766
The only excuse for breaking
probation is an emergency.

562
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,435
- Wait a minute.
- What?

563
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,703
Gene...

564
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:08,539
what are you doing?

565
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,508
Oh, good idea.

566
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:12,310
We'll brain the cops.

567
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:15,446
We'll stone 'em to death.
We'll both go to prison!

568
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,148
Oh, Billie, no.

569
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:20,017
Better idea--
break my hand.

570
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,086
What?
That's so much crazier.

571
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,387
I'm not gonna break
your hand.

572
00:20:23,421 --> 00:20:26,624
Billie! Break my
[bleep] hand, Billie.

573
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:28,359
- No!
- If you love me,

574
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:31,529
if you're my best friend,
you will break my hand.

575
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:33,097
I just met you.

576
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,651
If it doesn't look
like an emergency,

577
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:35,766
we both go to jail.

578
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,568
I don't think that's true.

579
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:40,037
It is.
I need you, Billie.

580
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:43,074
Do it, Billie. Do it.

581
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:45,610
Oh, God.
This is temporary.

582
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:46,777
Tell me when it's over.

583
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:48,579
Let me know once
you've broken my hand.

584
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:53,084
Oh, God! [both screaming]

585
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:57,288

586
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,159
[rap music]

587
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,495
Make sure-- Excuse me.

588
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:06,597
What are you--
What's happening?

589
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,065
Just trying
to check to make sure

590
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:09,733
we don't have
a Mrs. Doubtfire situation.

591
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:11,134
Ah, I see.

592
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:12,636
- That's fair, right?
- Yeah, that's fair.

593
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:14,571
You just saw that movie.
That's great.

594
00:21:14,604 --> 00:21:16,073
- I loved it!
- Yeah.

595
00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:17,227
- Have you seen it?
- Uh-huh.
