1
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,640
EXCITED SHOUTING

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,719
DALE: 'Dear Chief Ken, I am
writing you from the city Shanghai

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,999
'in a country the local people
call China.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,479
'Sorry I took off at Christmas
without saying goodbye.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,079
'It all got so complicated.
I had a lot of thinking to do.

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,639
'Lichfield, England,
is often on my mind,

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,519
'but Lady Luck's been kind to me
these last six months.

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,879
'I have a place to live

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,519
'and a top job
in the Shanghai business community.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,759
'Yes, Chief Ken, I can say at last
with absolutely certainty

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,960
'that everything is going my way.'

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,959
Oh! Hey, guys!

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,119
That was a great party last night.
It was your birthday, right, Hwang?

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,279
A little too much rice wine?
You little tearaway!

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,599
Let me see,

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,840
three cold ones coming right up.

17
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,519
He found out.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,720
Is he real mad?

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,920
HE SHOUTS OUT

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,280
Sorry, I forgot that was there.

21
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,440
I just cleaned the place yesterday!

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Whoo! Now, that's my exercise
for the day!

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,559
Well, that's not fair, Lu Hong.

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,839
I taught you how to nunchuk.

25
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,760
LU HONG ROARS

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,760
HE CHOKES

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,759
HE LAUGHS

28
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,119
Now look, guys, we're all
going to laugh about this someday.

29
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,999
- THEY GROAN
- But for now,

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,400
I should probably get on a plane.

31
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,319
HE CHOKES

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,000
Definitely get on a plane.

33
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,759
40 minutes?! Mate, my wife
is about to give birth here.

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,919
20 minutes. OK. Yeah.
We can hold on for that long.

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,959
Right.

36
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,839
I would like a prawn jalfrezi,
a chicken bhuna, naans,

37
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,079
- all of them - peshwari, keema...
- Tandoori special.

38
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,799
Tandoori special for four.
Lovely. Thank you.

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,439
Well remembered, Dylan.
SHE SCOFFS

40
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,799
What? The baby's a week late.
Curry induces labour.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,239
We've had it three times
this week, greedy-guts!

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,399
Lorna, it's nothing to do
with being greedy.

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,199
This is one of those
rare occasions in life

44
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,799
when doing the right thing
is also doing the tasty thing.

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,719
SHE LAUGHS
Besides, you need

46
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,839
to keep your strength up.

47
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,559
- It's going to be tough
when the baby arrives.
- Yeah...

48
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,839
Ken, you know

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,959
- these new branches we're opening up
in Sutton Coldfield?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,279
Rachna asked today if I'd
oversee them. Sort of head honcho!

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,680
- Congratulations, love!
- Thanks, Ken.
They want me to start straight away.

52
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,519
Erm... Hang on.

53
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,320
So I was thinking this time round
you might handle the baby duties.

54
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,679
- Paternity leave? I don't think so!
- Ha-ha, this is jokes.
- Interesting.

55
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,319
- Why not?
- Well, a bit sudden, isn't it?
You've rather sprung it on me.

56
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,679
Sort of like you sprang a baby on me
by lying about your vasectomy.

57
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,119
- Yes, Mum. That's the knockout.
- I mean, in theory, why not?

58
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,319
But I'd have to go in
and speak to the other partners,

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,279
and I am hugely important
to that firm.

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,399
I'm a king to them,
in my own humble way.

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,719
- Good. You can go and talk to
them tomorrow. - Yes. All right.

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,399
- I mean, yeah, I'll talk to them.
- Great!

63
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,959
Ha-ha, Dad, going to
look after the baby?

64
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,799
Going to give it its bockle
and wear a pinny

65
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,999
and be the pwimawy carer?

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,799
Oh, shut up. I'm not even
going to mention this at work.

67
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,879
As soon as your mother
lays eyes on that baby

68
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,399
and the old oxytocin hormone
starts a-flowing,

69
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,360
all thoughts of paternity leave
will exit her mind.

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,599
- No, I'm just going to ride this out.
- Yeah, sweet plan, Dad.

71
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,680
Now give me 20 quid
or I'll tell Mum.

72
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,679
Oh, Dylan?

73
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,399
- When you go to university
and leave home...
- Yeah, what?

74
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,199
Nothing. It's just
a wonderful thought.

75
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,279
- Bell end.
- DOORBELL

76
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,799
Yum-yum, here you are...

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,080
Chief Ken!

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,559
It's me. Dale.

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,160
- What the hell...?
- Long time no see.
- Dale?!

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,480
Well, come on, come in!

81
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,080
Lorna! It's Dale!

82
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,399
Touchdown at Thompson Towers.

83
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,279
And so concludes another
marathon session in the drinking

84
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,679
establishments of Lichfield.

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,799
Thanks for being designated driver.
God, it must be boring not drinking.

86
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,279
Oh, you know me.
Couldn't be boring if I tried.

87
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,599
SHE CHUCKLES

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,959
Oh, I'm so glad we stayed friends.

89
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,079
Best friends. Besties!

90
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,799
Could have easily been weird,
what with us almost being engaged.

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,879
Well, technically, we were engaged.
You said yes.

92
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,519
- But then I said no
about ten seconds later.
- Exactly.

93
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
So we were engaged for ten seconds.

94
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,559
The point is, you're still
the love of my life.

95
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,079
It's just you're
the friend love of my life.

96
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,479
I think it's because

97
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,399
it never really got that good
for us sexually, did it?

98
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,959
Yeah...

99
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,079
Rachel!

100
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,199
Hi, Ben.

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,639
You have to come in!

102
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,599
Dale's back!

103
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,680
- Oh, fuck off!
- Oh, my God...

104
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,159
Ben?

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,159
- How do I look?
- Not your best.

106
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,159
I mean, maybe just stay in the car,
wait until he's gone away again.

107
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,439
No, I'm going to go in.

108
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,559
- Yeah...
- Wish me luck.

109
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,520
Yeah. You go, girl...

110
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,039
HORN BLARES

111
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,280
Have fun...

112
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,599
Yum-yum in my tum! One thing I've
missed while in Asia, good curry.

113
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,879
- Dale, you look so nice in your suit.
Doesn't he, Rach?
- Yeah.

114
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,240
- It's very nice. - Mr Xi had
this suit made for me personally.

115
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,519
Oh! Mr Xi is my new mentor.

116
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,559
- What a wise and inspirational man,
let me tell ya!
- Right.
- Mm-hm.

117
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,880
He's not... another
cult leader, is he?

118
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,719
Of course not, Lorna!
I learned my lesson on that one.

119
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,439
- You guys must have thought
I was a real dope!
- Well, we did...

120
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,759
- No, we did not!
- No.
- No.

121
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,559
No, Mr Xi is actually
a very successful businessman.

122
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,399
So with things going
so great for you out there,

123
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,919
what brings you back to Lichfield?

124
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,639
Well, once a man has found
success in his work,

125
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,719
his attention turns
to matters of the heart.

126
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,879
- Oh, Dale doesn't need to go
into it just now, does he?
- No. No, no.

127
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,799
Well, you can stay
as long as you want.

128
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,639
We're doing up your room
for the baby,

129
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,639
so you'll have to stay
in Dylan's room.

130
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,519
- Well, that isn't happening.
- Great idea!

131
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,079
We could get those
old bunk beds out.

132
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,079
No, we could get the old bunk beds
in your arse. I'm not...

133
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,759
Insubordination.

134
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,479
It is SO good
to have you back, Dale.

135
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,320
You can move your old bed out. I'm
not touching your clammy mattress.

136
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,199
LORNA: He's come back for Rachel!
Finally, it's happening.

137
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,119
- Love is in the air, Ken.
- Yeah. And she could do worse, as well.

138
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,719
He's a good lad, is Dale.

139
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,079
I mean, he's no brainbox,
but, y'know, he gets stuck in.

140
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,639
I wouldn't want Rach
to move to China.

141
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,440
Although it is
a growing economy, I read.

142
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,639
Yeah. I don't know, y'know?

143
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,959
Rachel's in a bit of a rut right
now. Maybe change would do her good.

144
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,879
And if it's Dale, I mean,

145
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,599
who cares if he's her dead husband's
son by a teenage one-night stand?

146
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,040
As the song goes!

147
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,240
DRILL WHIRS

148
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,959
- Hey.
- Well, hey, Mom!

149
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,319
Me and Dylan are just building up
these bunk beds.

150
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,599
Yeah. Do you think we could drop
the whole "Mom" thing

151
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,559
now that you're back
and since we have had... sex?

152
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,039
Yeah, that makes sense.

153
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,839
Maybe I'll just call ya Rachel.
Or Rach.

154
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,639
I don't know, I can't choose.
I like 'em both.

155
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,679
Dale, erm, I've been thinking.

156
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,119
Last time you left so suddenly,
and I felt that we had some...

157
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,359
- talking to do.
- Yes. Yes, I'm so glad you said that.

158
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,799
So maybe we could go out?

159
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,519
There's a neat little Italian
just popped up on the high street.

160
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,599
Oh, cool.

161
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,319
- What does he want?
- No. Erm, it's a restaurant, not a person.

162
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,239
Oh. Got it, got it. I love that.

163
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,760
- OK, cool.
- Um, well...

164
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,440
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

165
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,159
The car just accelerated
away, and...

166
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,199
Hey! How are my NCT homies?

167
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,119
- Hey, Jess! Good to see you!
- How's it going?
- Oh, ready to pop.

168
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,959
Mark's still in Dubai, so, yeah,
poor, deserted, pregnant Jess!

169
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,839
- Oh, it's a crying shame.
- Mm.

170
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,239
Well, he sends cheques, so, you
know, maybe I should buy a man in.

171
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,919
How much for this one?

172
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,800
Too much for anyone.
I sell by the pound!

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,959
- Yeah, all right.
- We're actually overdue now.

174
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,999
Oh, well, erm, a friend of mine
swears the only thing that works

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,799
is nipple stimulation.

176
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,599
Oh, yeah? Oh, we'll have to
give that a go.

177
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,040
Us? Ken, you're naughty!

178
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,279
Ohhh! Oh, no! Oh, hell, no. No!

179
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,239
No, I meant Lorna and I!

180
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,879
Oh! Of course! Oh!

181
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,399
- LAUGHS
- No, of course!

182
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,599
Well... No, you two are...
You are the sweetest.

183
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,919
I could just eat you up!

184
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,440
Rarrr!

185
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,239
Anyway, better run, so, erm,
see you on the other side!

186
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,799
- Bye!
- Bye.

187
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,439
- Good luck!
- She's the worst.
- I like her.
- Because she fancies you.

188
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,720
I love you for even thinking
that's a possibility.

189
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
Right, if I can summarise,
Adrian totally cocked things up

190
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,759
and now they're suing us.

191
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,319
Not a great result, Ken,
but I gave it 100%.

192
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,560
Oh, well, as long as you tried(!)

193
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,999
All right, thank you,
meeting adjourned.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,759
Er, sorry, wait, everyone. Er, Ken?
Aren't you forgetting something?

195
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,719
I don't think so.

196
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,519
All of you, sit down.

197
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,919
Ken, you drongo, you forgot
to ask for your paternity leave.

198
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,999
- What are you doing?
- Lorna texted me to remind you.

199
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,959
So, everyone, Ken really,

200
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,880
really wants six months' paid leave
to look after his baby.

201
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,119
You do realise you're supposed
to give six weeks' notice?

202
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,679
You really are putting us
in a difficult position.

203
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,599
Oh, so it's a no, then.
Oh, that is a shame.

204
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,839
You'd better text Lorna.
Thank you, everyone.

205
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,719
On the other hand, it would be

206
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,279
an inspiring example
to the female workforce.

207
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,439
- I think I like it.
- Jane, are you on crazy pills?

208
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,759
We can't do without Ken!

209
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,359
He's the big daddy,
the grand old duke of law.

210
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,279
He makes it rain
like a bloody nimbostratus.

211
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,879
I mean, looking at it objectively,
I do see Adrian's point.

212
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,479
Oh, I don't know, we're big boys
and girls. We can handle it.

213
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,959
- We'll be fine!
- Yes, brave words, guys,
but let's not be cursory, OK?

214
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,879
Adrian? Maybe unpack what you were
saying a little bit more.

215
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,559
- I don't know, er...
- Yes, you do.

216
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,159
- Why shouldn't I do paternity leave?
- Er, Ken's the rain maker...

217
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,119
- You've said that!
- Well, let's all vote.

218
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,440
Who's for Ken's paternity leave?

219
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,960
That's three for. And against?

220
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,639
There's three against. Er...

221
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,719
with the senior partner
having the deciding vote.

222
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Ken, are you really voting against
your own paternity leave?

223
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,639
No. I must have got confused.

224
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,319
I'm voting FOR it,
because that's what I want.

225
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,719
Great! So, Ken's going on paternity
leave, and while he's away,

226
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,239
I suppose I'll have to
take up the reins.

227
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,160
Fantastic. OK, Ken,
see you in six months.

228
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,639
You would love the food. They have
this dish, chicken chop suey.

229
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,959
You've tasted nothing like it!

230
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,319
God! It makes me miss travelling
listening to you.

231
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,239
Travelling is so much fun.

232
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,199
So, are you, erm, heading back
to China any time soon?

233
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,719
Well, I mean, that kinda depends
on what happens while I'm here.

234
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,719
BOTH: We need to talk
about Christmas.

235
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,799
- Oh!
- THEY LAUGH

236
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,279
- Spooky!
- Yeah!
- OK, you go first.
- No, you go. Erm...

237
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,920
just say how you feel.

238
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,600
Look, I was so cut up when you said
we couldn't be together.

239
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,719
You see, I was taught to believe
that each person on earth was

240
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,240
given only one love.

241
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,760
I suppose I just got to believe
in second chances.

242
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,160
I've fallen for
a truly special girl...

243
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,319
...someone who's beautiful...

244
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,359
and kind...

245
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,679
and clever...

246
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,519
and funny.

247
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,959
Oh, yeah?

248
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,040
Um, what's her name... this girl...?

249
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,239
Ling.

250
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,319
Ling? Who the fuck is Ling?

251
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,559
- I mean, Ling...?
- LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

252
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,359
She lives in Shanghai, China.
She's Mr Xi's daughter, actually.

253
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,879
We fell madly in love, but Mr Xi
didn't quite approve of it,

254
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,879
so he had me chased out of town.

255
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,239
Now I gotta lie low a bit
until Ling can talk her dad around.

256
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,279
- So you're in love with Ling.
- Yeah!

257
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,399
And you're just here to hide out
from her dad. That's really...

258
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,640
That's really great.

259
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,559
- LORNA:
- I am so lucky.

260
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,279
I mean, how many other husbands
would just drop their career

261
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,279
because it is the fair thing to do?

262
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,480
Yeah. You're right.
I am a great guy.

263
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,039
Having said that...

264
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,879
now I've shown my willingness
to take paternity leave,

265
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,119
maybe it's time to ask,

266
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,319
would it be better
if I DIDN'T take paternity leave?

267
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,839
I don't know, Lorn, maybe it would.

268
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,799
Oh, Ken, just grow up.

269
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,959
Just because you take time off
to look after your own child

270
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,639
does not make you less of a man.

271
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,719
DOORBELL

272
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,520
You're not getting out of this.

273
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,519
- Hello, Ken.
- Oh...

274
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,759
- Steve...! We're busy. Go away.
- It's not a social call, Ken.

275
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,599
As your family doctor, I'm here
to check on my patient. Lorna?

276
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,719
Hi, Steve.

277
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,599
Ah... Haven't seen you two much
since Connie ran off again.

278
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,279
Do you know, I'm just up
the road now.

279
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,239
You should come round, check out
the new hot tub. Got it half-price.

280
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,719
Previous owner died in it.

281
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,759
OK. We're using a doctor
from the hospital.

282
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,879
You don't want to trust those quacks
at the so-called "hospital", do you?

283
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,919
I was kicked out of the hospital
for alleged malpractice.

284
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,039
Won't let me within 20 yards
of the place.

285
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,159
That is how stupid hospitals are.
So there you go.

286
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,680
- Let me have a look.
- Erm...
- Ken?

287
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,240
Thank you.

288
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,119
OK. In my professional opinion,
that baby is due any day now.

289
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,959
- Am I right? - It's a week late.
- It's a week late.

290
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,239
- Actually getting quite anxious.
- Don't encourage him!

291
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,919
Y'know...

292
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,359
a while back...

293
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,960
er, I rejected Western
notions of medicine.

294
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,879
Lorna, I have a trick
that will get that baby

295
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,879
out of you like a rat from a trap.

296
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,599
- OK, that's a very kind offer,
but it's a definite no.
- Ken!

297
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,479
We've tried everything else.

298
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,360
- Does this method involve you
touching me in any way?
- No.

299
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,519
- I mean, I could...
- No! - No! - No. No.

300
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,240
It's fine without. No.

301
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,839
For me?

302
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,599
Why, thank you.

303
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,799
Point that to the sky,
like you're at Ginza or Karnak.

304
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,120
Your job is to align the
energy fields, Ken. Align them.

305
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,079
SHE CHUCKLES

306
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,680
STEVE GRUNTS

307
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,879
OK, Lorna...

308
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,279
look at me.

309
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,879
Hip si bin ya. Hip si bin ya.

310
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,000
Hip si bin ya!

311
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,760
Ha!

312
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,200
Up!

313
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,639
Hip bin sin ya. Hip bin sin ya.

314
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,559
Hip bin sin ya! Hip bin sin ya...

315
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,679
Hip bin sin...

316
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,999
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

317
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
AAAAA...!

318
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,439
Well, you've blown MY mind, Steve.

319
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,360
Steve, you silly beggar,
this lump...

320
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,399
Oh, my Jesus Christ.

321
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,879
SPLASHING

322
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,839
Ken! It's happening!

323
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,559
Bloody hell! Where are my car keys?
Where are my car keys, Lorn?

324
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,119
They're in your jacket.

325
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,879
- Come on, Ken, get a move on.
- Victory!

326
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,799
Victory!

327
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,679
Come on, pick up!

328
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,479
- Ooh!
- Ben, Ben, the baby's coming.
Rachel's not picking up.

329
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,319
I need you to swing by
the restaurant...

330
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,920
- Ken, Ken, hurry up!
- Thanks, mate.

331
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,719
- Be fair, Ken, let me finish the job.
I'll deliver the baby.
- Steve...!

332
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,560
- It'll be a freebie.
- Steve, get out. Get out!

333
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,239
I've been practising at home.
I've been practising!

334
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,119
Honestly, it'd be fine.

335
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,599
Call the baby Steve. Call it Steve!

336
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,919
Rachel! Stop!

337
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,159
- Ben?
- Sorry.
- CRASHING

338
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,839
Rachel, stop it.
Stop it immediately.

339
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,119
Your mother's waters have broken.
Come on, stand up.

340
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,719
- Oh, God.
- Come on, Dale, stand up. Wrap it up.
- Let's go.

341
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,839
- Will you give me a lift?
- Yeah.

342
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,679
Oh, erm, I'll pay. I'll pay.

343
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,759
Yeah, I would take you, but there's
only space for one in the car.

344
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,079
Oh, that's fine.
It's under 12 miles, right?

345
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,320
I'll jog there. Race ya!

346
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,280
Oh! Ohhh...

347
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,840
Oh, Mum! Are you all right?

348
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,719
Whoo! These suits were not made
for long-distance running!

349
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,079
Did a baby come yet?

350
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,639
- No, no, no, you're all in plenty of
time. Dylan! - Dylan! - Better ring him.

351
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,719
No, I haven't got a signal.
I'll be back in a minute, love.

352
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,279
Ooh...

353
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,159
Obey me, you bastard! Come on!

354
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,119
Come on!

355
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,439
Ken?

356
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,359
- Ah! You're here, too!
- Yeah. Looks like it's popping at last.

357
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,839
Oh!

358
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,919
- So, your wife's in too, then?
- Yeah.

359
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,319
Looks like you're going to
beat her to it, though. Well done!

360
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,959
Yeah. I suppose I have
a fast vagina.

361
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,399
Ooh!

362
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,879
SHE CRIES OUT

363
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,479
HE JOINS IN

364
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,679
- What's happening?
- What do you think's happening?!

365
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,559
- Oh!
- Get a doctor!
- Doctor!

366
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,999
We need a doc...

367
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,560
THEY BOTH SHOUT OUT

368
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,719
Good... Just...
SHE CONTINUES SHOUTING

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,159

370
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,519
Oh, my God, it's happening!

371
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,480
- Where's Ken? Get Ken!
- I'll find Ken, Lorna, I promise.
- Yes!
- OK.

372
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,879
Excuse me, have you seen
my giant friend?

373
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,719
His face looks sort of like
a really angry eagle.

374
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,400
HE SHOUTS OUT

375
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,999
- One more push.
- Fuck you all!

376
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,359
That's the spirit!

377
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,519
Doctor, could someone
help me release this hand?

378
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,559
- I've got to be somewhere...
- Someone calm the father. He's panicking.

379
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,359
The thing is, I'm not the father.

380
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,239
Will you support me,
you selfish bastard?!

381
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,399
Rachel, never have children.

382
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,879
