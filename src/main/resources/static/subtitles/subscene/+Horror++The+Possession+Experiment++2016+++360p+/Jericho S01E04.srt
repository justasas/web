1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,010
I'm due an inheritance
now that I'm married.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,830
And money will run out
if we don't act now.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,630
I didn't expect this. I
can't believe he came back.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,150
- Let me in Charles, please.
- What's going on?

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,830
Annie, this is my brother.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,870
That fella they call the Prince, I've seen him hangin'
around your ma. I think they might be together.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,630
John James Blackwood.
Deceased. You declared me dead.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,910
You're a puzzle, Prince. I
still can't figure you out.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,830
I can't figure you out myself.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,350
Rest easy. You've got the whole
Blackwood family waiting on you.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,710
He left everything to you and not to me.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,710
My uncle, he only agreed
to my having my inheritance

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,430
on the understanding that
you would match the money.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,710
So you're telling me we
haven't got a farthing?

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,880
- Why have you been hiding in this valley?
- You're the reason I've stayed here so long.

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,760
George!

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
Hey, up, George.

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,260
- George.
- George. - George.

19
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,160
Right, got your shirt, your boots and
the tobacco from the gang, Mr Coates.

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,580
- What you doin' here?
- I've come to find you.

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,630
- It's time for you to come home.
- No, I'm staying here.

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,430
Mr Coates needs me.

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,880
Could you give us a moment
alone, please, Mr Coates?

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,680
- I'm someone important here.
- You're someone important to me.

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,030
When I'm here... I get
treated like I'm a proper man.

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,270
Proper wages and everything.

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,360
I'm sorry you saw me with Johnny,
but, honestly, it was nothing.

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,920
I always lay a place
for you at the table...

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,320
.. any time you feel ready.

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,920
Stubborn little boy. Just
give him a little time.

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,470
No harm if he has to stay a while longer.

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,160
I'm grateful, Mr Coates.

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,000
But he belongs with me. I'm his mother.

34
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,150
You have a fight with her?

35
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,000
She told me a lie.

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,150
She's gone and got herself a new man.

37
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,040
Yeah... you mean the
Prince, Johnny Jackson?

38
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,920
That's not even his real
name. It's Johnny Blackwood.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,430
As far as the world is concerned,
John James Blackwood is a dead man.

40
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,550
The papers are lodged with the
bank. The money can still be ours.

41
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,390
And? When the truth comes to light?

42
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,440
By then, it'll be too late. The money will
be in our hands and the viaduct will be saved.

43
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,030
Do we even know where he's gone?

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,800
I suppose he must be back in the valley.

45
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,860
We'll never keep it a secret
amongst the shanty folk.

46
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,940
Charles, the estate is
no longer your property.

47
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,680
You need to go to your brother now.

48
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,830
- Beg him to sign the deeds away.
- I'm not going on my knees to him.

49
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,510
A week from today, there'll
be nothing to pay the workers.

50
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,880
Then we need to find a
saviour... you and I.

51
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,310
No, no, no, no. No more, thank you.

52
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,910
But it'll go to waste. I made too much.

53
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,080
I'm already fit to
burst. - Really? - Aye.

54
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,840
How's your lass getting
on, up at the house?

55
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,270
Oh, fine linen sheets. I expect she'll be sorry to come home.
- Aye.

56
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,470
What about your lad? They say
he's working over at Coates' place.

57
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,270
He should be here with me.

58
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,990
It's just the other side of the street.

59
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,240
It feels like the other
side of the world to me.

60
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,270
Methodist Society. Eager
to save the navvies' souls.

61
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,590
They're having a service today in Jericho.

62
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,380
And what makes you so keen to worship?

63
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,520
Jonas Sorsby is giving the sermon.

64
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,550
For the Lord planted a garden,

65
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
and out of the ground
he made his glory shine!

66
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,720
- Praise be to God. Amen.
- Amen.

67
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,310
So how long will the navvy
folk be living here?

68
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,100
Six years, until the work is complete.

69
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,910
Six years shall ye sow the
land and gather in its yield.

70
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,350
Mr Sorsby, I know you to be a
highly successful businessman.

71
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,190
A chain of Drapers' stores. And
two cotton mills in Bradford.

72
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,910
A railway viaduct may be
something of a departure,

73
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,120
but I was wondering whether
you'd be willing to invest in us.

74
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,070
You could buy shares in the promised land.

75
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,020
A ladle taste better than
a silver spoon, does it?

76
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,790
The Quaintain boy told me.

77
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,600
You know, these navvies won't
stomach being made fools of.

78
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,800
It's none of your business.

79
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,280
Why you hanging round
here, hmm? Mr Blackwood?

80
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,760
Your family has money.

81
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,320
What's the deal between
you and your brother?

82
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,360
Mr Coates?

83
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,400
And just how long do you think
you can keep this a secret?

84
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Hello, John.

85
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Hello.

86
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,840
Mistress of Blackwood Estate,
how long's it taken you?

87
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,200
Eight years. How patient you've been.

88
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,560
That's cruel, John. I don't
remember you being cruel.

89
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,240
Eight years... since you left
this place. Walked out on everyone.

90
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,350
And is this the great
future you had planned?

91
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,040
Well, now who's the one being cruel?

92
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,220
You caused a great deal
of pain when you left.

93
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,510
Left a lot of questions unanswered.

94
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,520
Well, it's better that they stay
that way... for the sake of everyone.

95
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,320
I've been able to atone for my mistakes.

96
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,560
It's time that you do it,
too. Charles needs your help.

97
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,720
He needs you to bequeath Blackwood
House to him, in its entirety.

98
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,830
Why didn't he come to me himself?

99
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,750
You already know the answer.

100
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,320
Well, he's welcome to it. I
didn't come here for money.

101
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,480
I came here to pay my
respects to my father.

102
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,830
I need you to come back to the house.

103
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,080
Sign a deed. Make it legal.

104
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
You owe him that.

105
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
We both owe him.

106
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,680
Just seen your lad about.
Running errands for Coates.

107
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,280
I want him home. I'd rather
he was working with me.

108
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,360
Somehow, I've got to find a way to
stitch this family back together.

109
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,510
- Hey, you! Leave her alone!
- She's a dirty navvy!

110
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,910
My pa said this town ain't worth spit.

111
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,030
Hang on, I know you. I've
seen you in the village.

112
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,180
I'm George Quaintain's
mam. I know your mother.

113
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,390
- What you doing out here, missus?
- This is MY home now.

114
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,350
Go on! There's navvies here
with fists the size of boulders.

115
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,920
Don't be around here when the
siren goes. Go on, quickly!

116
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,800
Imagine coming all this way
on't cart just to gawp and sneer.

117
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,590
What's up with you?

118
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,640
"Home". It's the first time I've said it.

119
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,520
Happen I'm putting roots down here.

120
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,230
What did I tell you? You
are never to come here.

121
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,080
Charles needs my help. He
needs something from me.

122
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,100
As soon as he returns,
I'll be gone from here.

123
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,630
A canteen?

124
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,790
Serving food to the men. Just
to make some money on the side.

125
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,070
You need a licence to trade in this town.

126
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,070
I don't have much money put by.

127
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,220
Well, not so much a
licence, as a nod from me.

128
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,960
Well, I'd be grateful if you'd
nod your head, then... sir.

129
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,800
- Where would you like these?
- Just up against that wall, please.

130
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,040
Thank you.

131
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,080
And that comes in there.

132
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,460
Yeah, put it in by the stove.

133
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,870
- Sir, I need to talk to you.
- Just a moment, Epiphany.

134
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,480
And in here, gentlemen, you can
see a glimpse of our vision.

135
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,290
Bear with me, please, gentlemen.

136
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,250
- May I take your hats?
- Most kind of you.

137
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,810
- You went to him behind my back?
- I'm a partner in this business.

138
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,690
I don't need your permission to act.

139
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,570
I told you, I'm not going to
beg him, not for anything.

140
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,290
Charles, you listen to me!

141
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,370
You're not children fighting over toys.

142
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,130
Gentlemen, would you excuse us just a moment?
- Certainly.

143
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,650
This is what you wanted from me.

144
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,130
Blackwood House, the estate and grounds,

145
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,460
is hereby bequeathed to Charles
Blackwood in its entirety.

146
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,820
And now I want you to leave this valley.

147
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,970
You don't get my freedom into the bargain.

148
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,930
You think you belong down
there, amongst those men?

149
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,850
This valley is my home. I
took my very first breath here.

150
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,490
You're not the master of where I go.

151
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,220
This piece of paper means nothing
to me as I have an investor now.

152
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,010
Gentlemen, so sorry to keep you.

153
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,940
Sorry.

154
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,740
John. Wait... please...

155
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,900
My, my, a restaurant at
the end of our street.

156
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,490
Will erm...

157
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,450
Will folk be expected to dress
for dinner, if they come to call?

158
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,370
Folk can wear what they want,
as long as their money's good.

159
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,490
Hey, what you doing?

160
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,810
What do you think? I'm
giving you a helping hand.

161
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,850
- No, there's no need.
- Don't be daft.

162
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,500
Actually, it'll make a change
to do some work standing.

163
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,090
Come on, then. What's all this about?

164
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,650
George looks up to Coates.

165
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,490
Coates isn't the only one who
can build a little empire.

166
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,930
I'm going to give him a run for his money.

167
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,340
Hold up.

168
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,690
- I think I envy you.
- Oh... - The way you run your show.

169
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,850
Oh. So, are we, er...

170
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,660
Are we becoming friends now, Annie Quaintain?
- It appears so.

171
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,440
- Are you ready?
- Come on, then.

172
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,500
I reckon there's enough
here for... a week... or two.

173
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,250
You say there's more coming soon?

174
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,240
We've got entertainment for tonight...

175
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,690
.. and I reckon it
should be pretty decent.

176
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,410
I've got five extra barrels in,

177
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,530
and I've written a bill of entertainments.

178
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,210
Let's see!

179
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,770
Oh, who's "Quick-Fingered Jack"?

180
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,050
Ah, it's Dagger Wilkins. He
knows a card trick or two.

181
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,570
Who's "The Blooming Rose of Jericho"?

182
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,290
Er...

183
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,050
Alma.

184
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,690
She... She wanted to sing a ditty.

185
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,620
Oh, don't tell me you said yes, Joe.
- Aye.

186
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,680
What you doing, dressed like that?

187
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,810
It's my costume for tonight's show.

188
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,180
Costume? It looks like you've
forgotten to put your frock on.

189
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,920
All the music hall stars
wear this style, look.

190
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,850
What will I call myself?

191
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,890
Every star at the Alhambra's got a name.

192
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,650
What's wrong with Alma?

193
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,900
- I like Alma.
- Oh, Davey... you've no imagination.

194
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:33,610
I've spent 19 years being dragged
from navvy town to navvy town.

195
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,930
I don't see much excitement.

196
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,060
But tonight... Tonight
is gonna change all that.

197
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,410
Folk heard you talking
to that woman who came.

198
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,530
They're saying as how you're a Blackwood.

199
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,660
I'm the same fella I was before.
A name don't make no difference.

200
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,860
This valley was my home long
before any of you came here!

201
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,170
'Scuse me.

202
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,210
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Here, here!

203
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,490
Let me help you with that. Don't
you soil your precious hands.

204
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,380
Don't you struggle with it,
sir. Let me take that for you.

205
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,690
I didn't come here to deceive
you, that was never the plan.

206
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,690
I just came here for an honest
day's work, same as any man.

207
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,570
You made us look a right bunch of fools.

208
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,770
He didn't have to try too
hard with you, did he?

209
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,290
You've been arm in arm with
him since he came here.

210
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,220
Oh...

211
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,140
Get in there!

212
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:45,690
Hit me. If I were any other navvy,
you'd knock me to the ground.

213
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,780
Begging your pardon, sir.
Reckon that was MY fault.

214
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
Hey...

215
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,330
We don't want you here.

216
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,060
I'd like you to see the
progress up at the scaffold.

217
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,330
Perhaps later.

218
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:17,420
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
The Blooming Rose of Jericho!

219
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,020
Evening to you.

220
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,640
Navvies like their pleasures,
sir. Hard to deny them.

221
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,660
Mr Sorsby. Sir? Best not stray too far.

222
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,370
Stripping down to tie my garter

223
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,690
Tie is just a little bit, above my knee

224
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,010
If your hand should
slip a little further...

225
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,460
Cleanse your hands, ye sinners.

226
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,050
The triumph of the wicked is short-lived.

227
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,330
And he said...

228
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,370
Mr Blackwood, forgive me. I
cannot agree to be a partner here.

229
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,090
If I'm playing in your garden

230
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:22,090
Plucking blossoms wet with dew...

231
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,140
There's things here that
make you uneasy, sir?

232
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,250
"Uneasy"?

233
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,810
You've made nothing less
than Sodom and Gomorrah here!

234
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,010
Hey!

235
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,940
The stage is here.

236
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,890
Try to appease him, Charles. We need him.

237
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,730
Mr Sorsby, sir!

238
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,370
I'm determined we should
do business together.

239
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,250
Well, you'll need to clean
up this town, then, sir.

240
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,440
Before I'm back tomorrow.

241
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,740
Afraid I don't have
sixpence. Just a penny.

242
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,490
- Is there... owt I can do?
- You pay me what you can afford.

243
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,640
As long as I hear something
rattle, that'll do.

244
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,130
All the while he's living here,
he's not who he's claimed to be.

245
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,410
It's like something out of a penny
novel, rich man in a pauper's coat.

246
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,130
Who are you two discussing?

247
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,090
The Prince. He's Blackwood's brother.

248
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,440
And I don't want to be
friends with him no longer.

249
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,140
Are you not gonna serve me?

250
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,620
The sign says all welcome.

251
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,340
No?

252
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,960
Why should you be any
different from these folk here?

253
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,690
What do you let him stay for?

254
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,570
Because he works hard and he's hungry.

255
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,560
Just like all of you.

256
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,100
Tell her to wash it in yonder well

257
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,900
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme

258
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,860
Where never sprung
water or rain never fell

259
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,820
Then she'll be the true love of mine

260
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,930
You must be joking, sir.

261
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,650
What's a tavern if there ain't no beer?

262
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,260
That's the price of business, Joe.
We've got to make some changes here.

263
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,810
I'm not a learned man, sir.
But I know Jesus took wine.

264
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,400
Not for breakfast, dinner and tea.

265
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,650
Maybe... find yourself a dairy herd.

266
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,770
And drain those barrels dry.

267
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,490
Oh, and tell your girl she's NOT
to go up on that stage any more.

268
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,880
You try telling her anything.

269
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,420
Hang on, hang on. It'll keep.

270
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,090
It's a fine day's work.

271
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,130
I'll be wanting supplies for tomorrow.

272
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,930
You'll struggle to keep up with me.

273
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,810
Can you have your young grocery clerk

274
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,570
deliver first thing in the morning?

275
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,330
I need a shin of beef.

276
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,610
Shall we say... seven shillings?

277
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,220
A shilling more than yesterday?
You putting up prices already?

278
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,330
You want to be at the front
of the line, you have to pay.

279
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,860
Mr Coates, why do I get the feeling
you're determined to get your cut from me?

280
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,690
I'll make other arrangements.

281
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,650
You'll have to deal with me or no-one.

282
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,810
Well, we'll see about that, won't we?

283
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,650
Mrs Quaintain, why do I get the feeling

284
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,770
you're issuing a challenge to me?

285
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,060
I will not be at the beck and
call of a man again. Ever.

286
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,610
What are you two still hanging around for?

287
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,460
The cart doesn't leave for a while.

288
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,820
And I suppose you need feeding.

289
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,300
Come with me, I'll find you summat...

290
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,400
.. and I've got a job for you.

291
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,210
- Do you like stew?
- Yeah.

292
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,940
Mabel?

293
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,800
Are you with someone, are you?

294
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,340
Oh, no...

295
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:51,930
Work, for the night is coming

296
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:57,610
Work through the sunny noon

297
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:03,370
Fill brightest hours with labour...

298
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,220
He weren't joking about that dairy herd.

299
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,460
I'll tell you, plain... I'm not staying.

300
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,530
I'm not running no milk parlour,

301
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,660
just because Jesus is expected
to pop in now and again.

302
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,970
Young Blackwood, what's he thinking?

303
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,610
Selling this town out to Methodist folk.

304
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,090
Reckons how he needs their money.

305
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,620
Oh, he needs a happy town. And
he ain't gonna have one soon.

306
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,900
I only got to sing one song! And
Pa says I ain't to sing no more!

307
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,810
Oh, don't LOOK at me with them cow eyes!

308
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,090
I wanted to be someone!

309
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,250
Well, you're someone
to me. You're my Alma.

310
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,140
Oh, you don't... understand!

311
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:02,050
I hate it... here. I hate
the SMELL of the beer!

312
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:06,580
I hate the way that every
man always has dirt on him!

313
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,290
This was my one chance
to be somebody better,

314
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,450
and it's been taken away from me!

315
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,730
I reckon you're not
used to being waited on.

316
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,780
I told you, any man
could be anything here.

317
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,740
Regardless of colour.

318
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,900
- You make a decent wage at that estate?
- We don't get paid money.

319
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,130
No, we're treated as family.

320
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:50,180
In return, we tend to
the house and grounds.

321
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,940
Unusual terms of employment.

322
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,130
I've seen that in America,
before the Civil War.

323
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,210
Our families, in Antigua,
they were slaves.

324
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,930
My sister raised me. She
worked on a plantation.

325
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,410
I've been in Yorkshire since I was a baby.

326
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,900
So you're grateful for what
you've been given, huh?

327
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,100
What did you mean... when you
said a man can be anything?

328
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,060
I can find you paid
employment in the valley.

329
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,000
How's that suit you?

330
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,940
Good!

331
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,620
Tell me... how well do you know
those Blackwood brothers, huh?

332
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,740
- I shouldn't be talking about the family.
- No, of course.

333
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,140
Your loyalty is admirable.

334
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,180
I-I'm sorry, I embarrassed
you. I didn't mean to.

335
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,580
Stay, please.

336
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
Finish your coffee.

337
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,810
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

338
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,320
All right. Well, let me
know, won't you, Alice?

339
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,210
Well, look at this empire of yours.

340
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,620
It's growing bigger every day.
You'll be running this town soon.

341
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,210
What you after, lad?

342
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,090
- I was wondering if Mabel's in?
- No, she not working today.

343
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,340
You'll have to keep it
buttoned up till Tuesday.

344
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,570
What's the matter with Mabel?
She's not got that fever, has she?

345
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,570
Ah, you don't know how
we live, Annie Quaintain.

346
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,690
And you don't want to, either. Trust me.

347
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,050
What do you mean? Don't want to know what?

348
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,050
Some fella visited her last
night, smacked her around.

349
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,340
- Do you know who it was?
- Nah, she won't tell me, poor lass.

350
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,290
Should get the law on
to him, whoever he is.

351
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,090
That's the woman from the village talking.

352
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,010
You're a navvy now. Law don't trouble us.

353
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,210
Just as you asked, sir,

354
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,060
the tavern will now be a temperance bar.

355
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,620
Like sheep, we've all gone astray.
God loves a sinner come home.

356
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,940
Perhaps we can now start
to think about a contract?

357
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,210
What about those women?

358
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,410
They have no place in your town.

359
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
See that they're gone.

360
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,940
Mabel?

361
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,660
Sorry to bother you. I
brought you some vittles.

362
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,020
Oh... Look at you.

363
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,380
Happen it looks worse than it
is. It'll mend in a day or two.

364
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,850
You must tell people his name.

365
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,050
He told me he'd hurt
me again if I said owt.

366
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,970
There's people here who'll look after you.

367
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,890
They won't be able to do nothing.

368
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,850
Why not? No-one's beyond the law.

369
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,320
Some folk are beyond our laws.

370
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,100
You're telling me he's a gentleman.

371
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,180
How long you planning to live like this?

372
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,330
No-one else would know this place.

373
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,500
Shanty folk don't want me.
Nor my family, neither.

374
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,620
Look at you! Come here.

375
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,410
I was always the captain.

376
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,100
How far did we travel,
eh? Australia? America?

377
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,860
Not much further than
the edge of the garden.

378
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,330
Where've you been these last few years?

379
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,720
I've seen a lot of the world.

380
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,800
Carved a great canal across the desert.

381
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,850
Further than the end of the garden, then?

382
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,490
Listen, I need to tell ya.
Coates has been asking questions.

383
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,810
Wants to know all about you.

384
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,290
Get that wagon filled.

385
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,340
You, stack it with those
ones. Get the rest.

386
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,010
What's going on here?

387
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:56,930
You two, those baskets. Get rid.
I want these women out of here.

388
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,090
- What are you doing?
- Keep out of our way, ma'am.

389
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,740
They're making us leave. New
investor wants rid of us.

390
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,770
Go away, will you?! What's
the matter with you?!

391
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,820
Get that wagon filled!

392
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,300
Put it in the back.

393
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,340
Mabel... what are you staring at?

394
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,770
It's him. That fella, there. He's the one.

395
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,810
You! You're no man of God.
You're a damned hypocrite!

396
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,730
- Annie? What's going on?!
- He's the one who hurt Mabel.

397
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,180
Well, no wonder he's so
keen to see you out of here!

398
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,490
You'd better keep your mouth shut.

399
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,740
Or what? You'll do the same
to me as you did to her?

400
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,890
- Take your hands off me!
- Ooh!

401
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,920
You'll answer to the law for that.

402
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,750
I know you don't owe me no favours.

403
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,830
Your visits to me, that's all business,

404
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,630
and I don't wish to take advantage
of your fondness for me.

405
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,150
Why do I feel there's a 'but'
coming in this sentence?

406
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,710
Annie Quaintain struck a
man in the street just now.

407
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,190
Locked herself in her hut.
There's gonna be trouble.

408
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,790
And it's your job to protect her. Come on.

409
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,190
'Railway Agent', painted in
big, black letters outside.

410
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,230
That's supposed to mean something.

411
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
George!

412
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,110
Get up to the scaffold, there's
empty pitchers to be collected.

413
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,680
All right. I'm just going to finish
off doing this - - George, I said get!

414
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,430
It's best he ain't here.

415
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,550
Begging your pardon, sir. Ma'am.

416
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,670
- I need to speak with you.
- What is it, Coates?

417
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,670
A woman came to me and complained...
about yonder gentleman.

418
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,150
He's already told us what occurred.

419
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,950
The woman who struck me is
trying to fleece money from me.

420
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,630
Said she'd spread some damned
lies if I didn't pay her!

421
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,990
She's saying he assaulted a woman here.

422
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,790
- You're not serious?
- This is preposterous!

423
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,110
A woman who works over at the brothel hut.

424
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,550
- And you believe her lies?
- I'm obliged to, sir.

425
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,070
It's my job to take care of these people.

426
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,310
Now you listen to me, Coates. We're not just
any folk. We have a reputation in this county.

427
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,910
You're not going to take
her word over mine, surely?

428
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,110
I will drag her out of that hut.

429
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,030
And I will march her towards a constable!

430
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,430
Don't let him do that, sir. Don't
let him bring the law on her.

431
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,430
You must do as he asks. We
need to appease him, Coates.

432
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,470
You can either have this town on your
side or his money in your pocket.

433
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
Let me talk to her!

434
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,120
Miss Quaintain, it's Ralph Coates.
You're needed up at the office.

435
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,780
I'll see that you're treated well.

436
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,950
You have my word on it.

437
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,860
I sent him out. He ain't here.

438
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,310
Mrs Quaintain, would you mind telling us

439
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,700
what happened with Mr Sorsby?

440
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
No doubt you've heard.

441
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,310
He hurt Mabel.

442
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,430
A shanty town prostitute.

443
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,590
Who are you to make judgments on us? Your
son's the one that's been carrying on with her!

444
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,950
She was trying to extort money
from me! This is all a lie.

445
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,230
Just the word of two navvy women.
Against that of a gentleman.

446
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,550
Surely this lady's word
counts for something.

447
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,910
Tell your wife not to
take against us, Charles.

448
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,510
Tell her yourself, she's
standing right beside you.

449
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,870
Wives be subject to your
husbands, says the book.

450
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,120
And what does it say about priggish
men with inflated opinions?

451
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,830
Are you really gonna
be silent here, Charles?

452
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,070
Well, he has to. He knows
what's best for the townsfolk.

453
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,710
Now I've heard about
these navvy towns before.

454
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,910
There's little respect for the law.

455
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,990
But there is no question in
my mind what happened here!

456
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,390
- No, wait! Where are you taking me?
- You can't take her away like that.

457
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,110
You have no authority over me, Agent.

458
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,070
You're coming with me to see a constable!

459
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,030
What about my son and daughter?

460
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,230
Annie, I'll look after 'em till
all this is sorted. Don't worry.

461
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,620
He's there. He's coming, Mam.

462
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,430
- What's going on here?
- What's it to you?

463
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,910
This is my estate. You're on my land.

464
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,830
This woman is being taken to
the police for extorting money.

465
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,430
- On what evidence?
- The word of a gentleman.

466
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,670
Well, I'm a gentleman, too.

467
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,430
I don't believe that my
word is any better than hers.

468
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,470
But if that's what it takes to
convince you, I'll vouch for her.

469
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,640
- You're all swagger, aren't you?
- Take a look at that sign, there.

470
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,030
It's my name that's on it, not yours.

471
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,630
You have no authority here.

472
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,680
If you want any of my investment,
you'll not stand in my way.

473
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,190
No amount of money is worth letting
you harm these folk. You hear me?

474
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,910
You really want to start a
war with these shanty folk?

475
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,760
What you do to one... a hundred
others will know by tomorrow.

476
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,530
Sir, perhaps we can escort
you to your carriage?

477
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,580
Aye, sir. Reckon it's
time you were leaving.

478
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,660
Thank you.

479
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,740
You'll not see a penny of my money!

480
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,730
Well, I'll go and uncork those
four barrels I kept hidden.

481
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,610
Come on, you lot, you heard what he said!

482
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,050
Seems whatever I do,

483
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,700
my life gets tangled up with
yours... Johnny Blackwood.

484
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,210
Is that so terrible?

485
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,530
It's not what I had planned.

486
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,620
Come for supper again. I
won't charge you sixpence.

487
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,810
I did what I had to do
to keep Jericho alive.

488
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,730
All you've done is bring this
town one day nearer to disaster.

489
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,370
I offered you my help, Charles.
You threw it back in my face.

490
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,690
I wouldn't accept your help!

491
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,040
Not if my whole future depended on it!

492
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,770
You shame yourself.

493
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,420
Staying silent... when you should speak.
