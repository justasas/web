1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,880
Whole thing was an accident.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,080
Nobody's going to find out.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,920
You'll make sure,
they'll only dig so far?

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,400
This ground is soft,
there's something else.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,240
- There's another body.
- I have nothing new to tell you.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,640
We didn't have a body back then.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,640
With a blanket, this is a direct
link to someone from your house.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,480
I saw you, tear out something from
his body.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,200
Could be of some use,
might even point to who did it.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,680
Take this.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,560
It's a proud moment, when a man
receives his first ever wage.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,240
No matter how he comes by it.

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,520
The world is full of men like
Rory McCleod.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,800
It's the ones that love you, even
when you give them reason not to.

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,360
That's a real man.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,960
That's your Davey.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,400
John and Isabella were together?
Is that what you're telling me?

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,160
- It's you that I care about.
- Then aren't I lucky to have you?

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,560
- You can't go on the run.
- Annie, I have to.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,760
Coates. He won't let this lie.

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,880
Perhaps Coates understands exactly
the type of man you are.

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,400
A liar, a cheat. Is it unreasonable
to assume a murderer too?

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,800
Mam?

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,760
Mam?

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,800
Yes, love?

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,160
What's gonna happen to Johnny?

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,520
I don't know.

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,800
But it were my fault.

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,200
I can't let him take t'blame for it.

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,080
We'll sort it.

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,120
Now try and get some sleep.

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,880
I need to own up, Mam.

33
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,800
- I better tell them that it were me.
- No, you don't.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,440
You get that idea out of your head
right now. And keep your voice down.

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,480
How the heck are you gonna sort it?

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
What's happening?

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Nothing, love.

38
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,440
You go back to sleep.

39
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Your brother's dreaming, is all.

40
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,280
I was only saying.

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,520
You've been "only saying" all
morning.

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,360
Just give it a rest, will you?

43
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,120
Mark my words, the law takes on a
different meaning when you're a gentleman.

44
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,000
We'll see no justice here.

45
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,960
Red was murdered in cold blood and
thrown in the ground like an animal.

46
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,000
Now his body's sitting there
rotting,

47
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,720
while Johnny Blackwood
kisses the backsides of his cronies.

48
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,280
Look, everybody says Red were
responsible for the explosion.

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
It seems to me he were an animal!

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
There's no proof Johnny did owt.

51
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,240
But if he did, I reckon
he was doing us all a favour.

52
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,040
You two have always been special
friends, haven't you?

53
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Hey, hey. Leave it! Leave it!

54
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,760
Leave it!

55
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,520
Get back to work, you two.

56
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
And no more trouble.

57
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,000
Forgive me for intruding,
Mr Blackwood.

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,240
But with you being his brother,
you'll know he's not to blame.

59
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,360
I can't help you, Mrs Quaintain.
Coates is dealing with the matter.

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,920
He must take my brother before the
magistrate, same as any man.

61
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
But you have sway, sir...

62
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
...influence.

63
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
And I know you're a good man.

64
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,040
The way you took my daughter in,
saved her life.

65
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,960
You know Johnny could never hurt
anyone.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,480
Justice is blind to family loyalty.

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,120
I can't get involved.

68
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,720
So you're happy to entrust his life
to another?

69
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,880
And you're sure Mr Coates is the
right man?

70
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,880
I'm sorry, Mrs Quaintain.

71
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,480
You can't just abandon him!

72
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,040
Your food, Mr Blackwood.

73
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,800
I trust you slept well.

74
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,800
I need to see my brother.

75
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,840
I need to talk to him.

76
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,160
No, it's best you stay right here
for now.

77
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,720
Red has friends on the gang
and there've been rumblings.

78
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,360
I've sent for the magistrate,
but until then,

79
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
you're safer under lock and key.

80
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,280
And whatever's happened between us,
sir,

81
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,960
I'll see that you're dealt with
fairly.

82
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,360
Mr Coates?

83
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,040
The workers are not happy, sir.
They want answers.

84
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,840
As do we all.

85
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,040
We need to get t'magistrate down
here quick time to avoid trouble.

86
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,120
It's a day's ride into town. I ain't
leaving that prisoner with no protection.

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,360
And I ain't taking him with me,
neither.

88
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,680
You yourself know, anything can
happen up on those moors.

89
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,960
No, we stay right here until things
quieten down.

90
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
This is our town.

91
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,160
Our turf, and Red was one of our own,
not some gent dressed up in navvy's clothes.

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,280
Johnny needs to pay for what he did
to him.

93
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

94
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,760
I can assure you, justice will be
served. You have my word.

95
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,880
What's your promise count for in a room full
of gentlemen who think we're nowt but scum?

96
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
You run this town. Do something!

97
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
- All right.
- Do it now before we do.

98
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Let's talk about it.

99
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,080
See if maybe we can come to a
solution between ourselves.

100
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,000
Capstick's.

101
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,240
- Joe?
- Yeah?

102
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
A barrel of ale if you will.

103
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
- A barrel?
- That's right.

104
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,320
If you please.

105
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,600
We've got important matters to
discuss.

106
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,640
I'll roll one out.

107
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,560
What are you doing? What is it?

108
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Davey, please, I need to see him.

109
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,000
It ain't safe here.

110
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,120
Imagine it were Alma,
begging to see you.

111
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
I have to talk to him.

112
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,280
All right.

113
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,400
But if Mr Coates catches you,
or me, for that matter...

114
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,760
Thank you.

115
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,280
Annie.

116
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,280
Annie.

117
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
What are we gonna do?

118
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
I'm helpless, trapped in here.

119
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
I'll think of something.

120
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
In the meantime, we keep quiet.

121
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
We give them nothing.

122
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Maybe Charles will see sense.

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,080
No, we're on our own,
he won't help us.

124
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,320
I went to him, asked him to help.

125
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,560
He straight out refused,
won't use his position, anything.

126
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
No, listen to me,
it'll be all right.

127
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,760
I'll do everything I can
to get Coates off your back,

128
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,200
clear your name,
I don't know how but I will.

129
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,840
Annie, be careful.

130
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Coates is gunning for me.

131
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
He'll stop at nothing to be rid of
me.

132
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Then let him do his worst.

133
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,880
He's got nothing on you,
no evidence.

134
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
You didn't kill Red.

135
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,440
Drink up, gentlemen.

136
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,880
If you'll excuse me a moment,
I've got business to attend to.

137
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,880
What's Coates playing at,
filling their bellies with ale?

138
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Surely it'll inflame things?

139
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,600
I don't know, but it's the fastest
grasp of silver we've had in a while.

140
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,600
Mr Quaintain?

141
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,840
Whoa, whoa.

142
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
It's all right.

143
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
This trouble's got us all on edge.

144
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,440
Yes, sir.

145
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
Your mother too, huh?

146
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,600
Especially since your pa's gone
and Johnny's locked up.

147
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,240
- She's scared, sir.
- Well, it's an upsetting business.

148
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,320
It must be tough on you,
living in that house.

149
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
You know, uh...

150
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,720
sometimes a man needs another man's
counsel.

151
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Come and take a walk with me.

152
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Sometimes you just need to share the
weight.

153
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,800
You know?

154
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,720
Take another man's view on the
world.

155
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,960
I guess you had Johnny until now.

156
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
You were beginning to trust him...

157
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
...seek his advice.

158
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,520
I do listen to him.

159
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,560
And me mam.

160
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,720
Just happen they're not always right.

161
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,680
I mean... how can I let another man
take on something that's my doing?

162
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
George, what's on your mind?

163
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,720
I promised me mam that I'd take it to
t'grave.

164
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,920
I feel so ashamed.

165
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
I can't stop thinking about it.

166
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,000
It's there every day when I wake up.

167
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
He had nowt to do with it.

168
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
It had nothing to do with Johnny.

169
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,920
He were just trying to help.

170
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
I didn't mean him no harm.

171
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
I wanted to get away from him.

172
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,160
Are you telling me...

173
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
...that Red's death was down to you?

174
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
Johnny tried to cover it up.

175
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I can't let him pay for it, I can't.

176
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,440
I'm scared.

177
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Come here, son. Aww.

178
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
We can handle this between us.

179
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
You mustn't say a thing about this.

180
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,040
Not another word about it to
anybody.

181
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Aye, of course.

182
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,360
Now we're for it.

183
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,920
These lot won't rest until they've
lynched him.

184
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Aye, I think you're right.

185
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,720
Coates has made fools of us all.

186
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,000
Thinking he can quieten us down
with a bellyful of ale?

187
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,440
It's time Johnny Blackwood
learnt the meaning of justice.

188
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,000
Open the door, Davey!

189
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,160
Look, I can't do that.
Calm down, Shay.

190
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,880
Get out of me way!

191
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,000
Blackwood!

192
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Come on out to me, Blackwood!

193
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,880
Let me out, Davey!

194
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
- Come out here!
- Get back, Shay.

195
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,160
Come on, get back!
Everybody, get back!

196
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,800
Calm down.

197
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,720
Calm down! Get back!

198
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,360
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

199
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,840
Gentlemen!

200
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Everybody, calm down!

201
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
I know you all want actions.

202
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
But let's go back to the tavern.

203
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,560
And you can give voice to your
concerns there in a civilised way.

204
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,840
What, while he's hiding in there?

205
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,560
- Give me the keys.
- What about the magistrate?

206
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,600
There's no time.

207
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,840
Get back.

208
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
I've nothing to hide!

209
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,280
If each of you has a voice, it's only
right that Johnny Blackwood has one too.

210
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,240
I hope you have a good story worked
out.

211
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
Get him out of there! Come on!

212
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Get him out of there!

213
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,040
- Where's George?
- I'm not sure.

214
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
I need to find him.

215
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,480
I don't want you wandering
about alone out there.

216
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,840
Mam, what is going on?

217
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,480
Hello, love. I'm just after
a quick word with your mam.

218
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Come in.

219
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,960
I thought you might need a friend
with all that's going on.

220
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,200
You two, wait out there.

221
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,840
But don't think about stepping off
that porch.

222
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,280
Can I count on you,
Polly, as a friend?

223
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,240
In the truest sense of the word?

224
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
I need you to do something for me.

225
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
Without asking questions.

226
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,840
We all know that Johnny and Red
came to blows once.

227
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Navvies are always scrapping.

228
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,520
And it's a fact that Red's body was
found in Annie Quaintain's blanket.

229
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,080
Now, Annie Quaintain is not strong
enough to kill a man of Red's stature.

230
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,320
But Johnny Blackwood was living in her hut
and could have easily taken that blanket.

231
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,000
Mr Coates, it's a bunkhouse!

232
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,160
Any number of fellas
could have snatched that blanket.

233
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
What I know that you don't know,

234
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,240
is that Mr Blackwood was determined
to exhume those bodies by himself.

235
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,600
That's not true.
You're a liar, Mr Coates.

236
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,800
It's not a job that any man would
relish,

237
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,680
unless he had something to hide,
perhaps.

238
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,160
How about we cut his throat and
sling him in the same dirty hole?

239
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,080
- Quiet, please.
- You don't know what you're talking about.

240
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,440
Quieten down!

241
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,080
He went missing just after Red was
dug up!

242
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
You don't know what you're talking
about!

243
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,120
He was trying to flee! And, look,
he's lied to us from the start!

244
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,840
What posh gent would want to live
down here unless he was hiding summat?

245
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
What's he got to hide?

246
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,520
Quiet, please!

247
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,040
This is not gonna work if we all
speak at once.

248
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,560
Now, if you want to say your
piece...

249
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,240
Give me this. Bring this on out.

250
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,160
If you've got something to say...

251
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,080
you stand on this.

252
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,560
If you ain't standing right there,
then you ain't got the right to talk.

253
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,440
- Agreed?
- Aye.

254
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
The whole town's turning out.

255
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,240
Mam, why have you changed your
dress?

256
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,080
- That's your mourning gown, in't it?
- Yes, it is.

257
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,800
Reckon it'll do no harm to remind them we've
had enough heartache for one lifetime.

258
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,920
Right, Martha, you're to accompany
your mam.

259
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,800
George, me and you are gonna keep an
eye on that stew pot.

260
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,840
Why can't George come?

261
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,560
It's no place for young eyes nor
ears.

262
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,080
Aye, all right.

263
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
You look after your mam.

264
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
So what if Johnny fought with Red?

265
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,880
It don't make him guilty of murder.

266
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,080
Oh, oh, Dagger! Happen you're in on it,
mate, you're always trying to protect him.

267
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,880
All navvies fight from time to time!

268
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,960
Me too!

269
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,720
And you... you... and you.

270
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,120
And no one's accusing us of killing
Red.

271
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
You've got nothing on him.

272
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,080
Well said, Dagger!
You can't prove anything!

273
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
Quiet, quiet.

274
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Who's next to step up and speak?

275
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,520
I reckon I've got summat to
tell you.

276
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,840
I were taking a walk late the other
night.

277
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,640
I stopped for a breather,
a short moment to myself.

278
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Were you on your own?

279
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,880
And I overheard Annie and Johnny
talking.

280
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,800
At first, I thought they
were having a private moment.

281
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
I mean, Annie's got two kids.

282
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,800
It can't be easy for sweethearts,
even at their age.

283
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
They were whispering secrets...

284
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,960
about something terrible that had
happened.

285
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,600
And you could see it by the look on
their faces.

286
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,400
What did I tell you? He's guilty!

287
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Quieten down, everybody!

288
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,120
Let the girl speak!

289
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,480
What's she playing at?
She don't know nothing about it!

290
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,720
Don't bet on it. Where there's
trouble, Alma'll find it.

291
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
- You're right there, Joe.
- Aye.

292
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,640
All I ever hear talk of is your
mam's cooking.

293
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,440
What's the big secret,
then, eh, George?

294
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Secret? What do you mean?

295
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,840
The ingredient.

296
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:26,080
Oh, erm... dunno. Salt?

297
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,160
Too busy with your books to worry
about owt like cooking, aren't you?

298
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,880
Then how come you've not turned
a single page since I got here?

299
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Have you ever played faro?

300
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,040
Eh?

301
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
Johnny and Red were avowed enemies!

302
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,400
What happened was more than scrapping. Jack
had to break them apart and warn Red off.

303
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,920
Sadly, Jack is not here to speak for
himself.

304
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,200
Hatty...

305
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,960
...is there something you can help us
with?

306
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,400
No.

307
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,880
But your husband might have said
something.

308
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,520
No one's opinion was more trusted
than Jack's.

309
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,280
It would mean a lot to us all if we
knew how he felt about the matter.

310
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
Speak up, lass.

311
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Jack did tell me about a fight
between Johnny and Red.

312
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,160
Aye, every man saw it.
She doesn't need to account for it.

313
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
No, not the fight at the viaduct.

314
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,160
They fought another time as well.

315
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,960
It was down at the river,
it ended with Red pulling a knife.

316
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Jack had no option but to fire him.

317
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Red vowed to pay Johnny out.

318
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,920
Well, happen Johnny got there first!

319
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,520
No, I'm not saying there was any kind of
vendetta between them, I'm not saying that.

320
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,560
I can't deny there were bad blood.

321
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,280
Jack did the right thing banishing
Red.

322
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,160
And Red paid him out with that
explosion.

323
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,320
I say Red Killeen got what he
deserved!

324
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,200
Dead and buried in an unmarked
grave! I'm glad of it!

325
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,640
Me mam don't let us play cards in
t'house.

326
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,080
Me and me dad used to but she
stopped us.

327
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Oh, yeah? Why's that, then?

328
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,520
She said it were a game for cheats
and drunks.

329
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,720
Hey, your bet were on t'other card
before.

330
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Happen your mam was right.

331
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,160
You're getting there. It only took two
rounds before you noticed this time.

332
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,640
How long do you reckon they're gonna
be?

333
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,800
You're fond of Johnny, then?

334
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
Well, aye.

335
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,200
Then there's Johnny's feud with his
brother.

336
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
And the reason he hid his name.

337
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,560
Who's to say that Johnny
didn't cause that explosion...

338
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,520
...trying to sabotage his brother's
business?

339
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,320
Is this the fair hearing that you
promised me?

340
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,040
You set me up from the start.

341
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,280
What more do we need to hear?

342
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,200
Johnny had cause. He has a history of
violence, he's got a history of lying.

343
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,560
So what are we gonna do with the
guilty man?

344
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,400
We've no prison.

345
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,480
We banish him across our borders,
he walks away a free man.

346
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,120
Call for the magistrate!

347
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,160
As far as I can see...

348
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
...there is only one solution.

349
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,200
Take that, you dirty scum!

350
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
Leave him alone! Don't touch him!

351
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
Everybody, step back!

352
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,720
Mr Coates, sir.

353
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
- What about the tin?
- What's that?

354
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
The one you took from Red's corpse.

355
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
You said it was evidence.

356
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Evidence that's not gonna help him.

357
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,600
That tin had money in and it ended up in
your pocket. I heard how you spent it.

358
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,040
It was a pretty girl, huh?

359
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,480
Don't let anything happen to him.

360
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,080
I need to go to the Blackwood house,
Mr Blackwood needs to know what's happening.

361
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,440
I'm begging you,
don't let them touch him.

362
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,100
Come on!

363
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,460
You have to come, Mr Blackwood!

364
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
It's John, he's in bad trouble.

365
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,500
The shanty folk are taking justice
into their own hands.

366
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,340
At least, they're about to.
what about the magistrate?

367
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,140
Mr Coates, he didn't send for him!

368
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,460
Some of the men are talking vengeance
and demanding that Johnny pay in kind.

369
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
I think they might hang him.

370
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,740
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

371
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,460
Got you.

372
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,340
You need to do it with more
confidence.

373
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,380
I could see your hand shaking.

374
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,220
I've got my work cut out with you.

375
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,060
What's going on?

376
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,460
Your mam told me to tell you to go
with Polly.

377
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Says it's important.

378
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,740
You've all heard about the violent
altercation between Johnny and Red.

379
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,780
He hasn't denied it, to his credit.

380
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,500
But what about his movements
around the time Red was murdered?

381
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,660
Annie Quaintain?

382
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,020
You're best placed to help us with
that.

383
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,660
Hold on tight, George.

384
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,740
You ever driven an horse before?

385
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,540
We're going too fast!

386
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,620
By heck!

387
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,140
George, love, what are you doing?

388
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,180
Sit down before you fall down!

389
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,860
I need to get off.

390
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,460
Whoa!

391
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,380
Whoa, Bessie!

392
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,420
I need to go back there!

393
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,300
George, love, what's the matter all
of a sudden?

394
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,860
George!

395
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,180
You're quite fond of Johnny,
Miss Quaintain?

396
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,540
I don't see how my opinion on him
has any bearing here, Mr Coates.

397
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,700
The two of you are close,
we all know that.

398
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,980
He's a good man.

399
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,020
Are you two close enough to conceal
a crime, perhaps?

400
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,700
He's no crime to conceal.

401
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,740
Of course he has! She knows more
than she's letting on!

402
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,140
And you have no idea who took that
blanket?

403
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,100
No.

404
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:46,900
There wasn't one fella in particular who
complained about being cold that night?

405
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,860
Hey, that's enough! Leave her be!

406
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,180
Cheap jibes won't get you any closer
to the truth, Mr Coates.

407
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,780
You and Johnny are close.

408
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,820
Is that why I can't see a wedding
ring on your finger?

409
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,620
Or is it because you and the man
who stands here are lovers?

410
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,500
Do you two share a lovers' secret,

411
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,220
a secret that you would do anything
to conceal?

412
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,580
Tell the truth, woman!

413
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,900
You're right, Mr Coates!

414
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,940
We do have a secret.

415
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Johnny and I are lovers.

416
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,500
Oh, now we're getting
somewhere!

417
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,660
See, ladies and gentlemen,
what I've been telling you?

418
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,540
And we were together... alone...

419
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,860
the night that Red Killeen was
murdered.

420
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,380
That's how I know he has no crime to
conceal.

421
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,740
So, no, I don't wear my wedding ring
any more. I don't even know where it is!

422
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,500
So you want us to believe
that you were in a deep clinch,

423
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,540
a passionate embrace with this man,

424
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,140
the moment that Red Killeen
was being murdered?

425
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,180
Yes, I do, because it's true!

426
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,020
You want us to believe that while
you stand here in your mourning clothes?

427
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,060
Who are you, Annie? Huh?

428
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,700
The grieving widow who's struggling
to protect her children,

429
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,220
or a woman who just throws
her wedding ring away

430
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,940
so that she can
lay with a handsome young navvy,

431
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,260
just moments after the tragic death
of two of his friends?

432
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
Mr Coates! Mr Coates!

433
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,100
I reckon I can tell you
t'whereabouts of that wedding ring.

434
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,260
She sold it me...
in return for taking her to Settle.

435
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,980
She were going after her boy.

436
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,020
He'd run away.

437
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,980
It's in a shop there.

438
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,740
I pawned it.

439
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,780
Why was her lad running away?

440
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,620
Happen he knows summat.
George Quaintain, where is he?

441
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,660
No, no!

442
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,500
No, you don't need the boy.
You don't need George.

443
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,060
You can't put a boy on the stand,
it ain't fair.

444
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,060
Oh, look who's turned up to save the
day!

445
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,500
Just in time, Mr Blackwood, just in
time to witness Jericho justice.

446
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,220
You can't create a monster
and then expect it not to roar!

447
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,980
You're to tell me how you did it,
exactly.

448
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,300
They're like a pack of animals.

449
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,140
Mam is taking a hiding in there, so
you're to tell me so I can help her.

450
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,780
And you.

451
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,060
George!

452
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
I just wanted to get away from him.

453
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,140
He had me trapped on t'scaffold.

454
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,340
I took this tanner's knife...

455
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,380
just to protect myself with.

456
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,020
To scare him off.

457
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,060
I didn't mean to cut him.

458
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,940
You're to go home.
Go home and stay there.

459
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:22,460
No... Johnny.

460
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,220
He'll get blamed for it, they'll
hang him. It's my doing.

461
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,460
It's all right.
Trust me, I know what to do.

462
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
Please just go.

463
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,120
Hey!

464
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,160
You've got to do something!

465
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,840
I'm not sure I can. They're not gonna let me
just walk Johnny out of here. There'll be a riot!

466
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,600
I've something to say.

467
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,354
Johnny Blackwood is guilty,
I know so.

468
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,760
Johnny killed Red.

469
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,920
There were a fight between him and
Johnny up on t'scaffold.

470
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,840
Johnny cut Red with a tanner's blade.

471
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,760
There was a weapon buried next to
the body.

472
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
A tanner's blade.

473
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,760
- She's right!
- A tanner's blade! What do you say to that?

474
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,880
- George.
- Where is he?

475
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,360
George!

476
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,160
George.

477
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,840
- Get that boy down!
- Martha is lying.

478
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,760
Get down, George!

479
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,080
She's just trying to protect
me!

480
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,760
Johnny Blackwood's innocent.

481
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,000
I killed Red Killeen.

482
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,920
Let the boy speak!

483
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,800
Look, I had no intention of hurting
him!

484
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
No reason to!

485
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
But he chased me up t'scaffold.

486
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,520
I grabbed t'tanner's blade
to protect meself with, that's all.

487
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,040
I nicked him once on t'neck
when I were trying to fight him off.

488
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,800
Then... he fell back off t'scaffold.

489
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
It were him or me.

490
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
Look, Johnny did nothing wrong.

491
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,280
He were just trying to help me and
me mam.

492
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
But it were wrong.

493
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Wrong of me to let him.

494
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Wrong of me not to own up.

495
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,920
Cos when a man's at fault,
he should face t'consequences.

496
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
Why was Red so set on killing you?

497
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
What had passed between you?

498
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I knew what he'd done.

499
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,440
I saw him stealing from t'explosives
hut.

500
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,040
Red caused the explosion.

501
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,800
He killed Skinny and Jack.

502
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,400
Calm down, everybody.

503
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,760
Quieten down.

504
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
I think it's time to release me.

505
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
- Annie, bring the boy up.
- No...

506
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,120
He's confessed like a man,
let him face the consequences.

507
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
George is just a boy!

508
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,760
George Quaintain has...
bravely admitted the killing of Red.

509
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
It were an accident!

510
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,440
Now it's up to us to decide his
fate.

511
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,840
You can't do owt to him, Mr Coates.

512
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Let the boy be, Mr Coates.

513
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
What say you, Mr Blackwood?

514
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,160
Surely he was doing all he could
to save himself.

515
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,640
- Aye.
- He was that.

516
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,080
It'll be my recommendation to the magistrate
that Red Killeen's death was accidental.

517
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,320
Red Killeen murdered one of ours.

518
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,080
And he's not here today to talk
about that.

519
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,560
But some might say that today,
justice was done.

520
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,640
We'll shake on it, Mr Coates.

521
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,440
Come on, son.

522
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,520
You kept your cards close to your
chest.

523
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,160
I am so proud of you, Davey Sharpe.

524
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,200
You were summat else today.

525
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,800
What were you doing out walking so
late to overhear what you did?

526
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,240
Like I said, I were taking a moment
for meself.

527
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,960
I couldn't sleep.

528
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,800
I were thinking of you.

529
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
It's as though this trouble...

530
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,600
all this hurt caused for George,
Johnny, Annie...

531
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,120
...all started with lies.

532
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,360
Folk being afraid of telling the
truth.

533
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,800
- I don't want to live like that.
- You won't have to.

534
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,360
Not if you're with me.
Not once we're married.

535
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,320
Let's set a date, Davey.

536
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
Make me an honest woman.

537
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Charles, wait.

538
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,880
Words can't express our relief,
John.

539
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,680
Will you not stay for a drink?

540
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,840
Toast my freedom and George's.

541
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
I don't think so.

542
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,920
Home, Easter, if you please.

543
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
Oh, come on, Charles, why not?

544
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,040
There's been more than one secret
unearthed here in the past two days.

545
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
I know what happened between you.

546
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,840
Oh, Charles, I...

547
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
It was a long time ago.

548
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
I'm so sorry.

549
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,600
Drive on.

550
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,760
Aye, you best run like a rat.

551
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,160
You've got no place here.

552
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,560
You'll be seeing me again,
Dagger Wilkins.

553
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,000
I ain't finished here.

554
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,400
Why didn't you tell me what had happened
instead of lying to me all this time?

555
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,920
- Didn't you trust me?
- I couldn't put you through it, Martha.

556
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,360
The lies, the fear...

557
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,960
Look, it's over now.

558
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,960
We can start again.

559
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
No more secrets.

560
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,160
Come on.

561
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,360
What was it you once said to me?

562
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,920
You'd either see a stallion drive
another from the herd.

563
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,960
You've been desperate to get rid of me
since we first clapped eyes on each other.

564
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,600
I had to give this town its justice.

565
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,160
And serve yourself into the bargain.

566
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,360
You've got a week to work out your
notice.

567
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,720
And then I want you gone.
