1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,550
You're not my father. Just leave me be.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,920
Tomorrow I'd be obliged if you
found yourself new lodgings.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,950
She's useless, this one is.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,390
I am never... leaving you.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,470
That promise is unbreakable.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,350
That fella they call the prince.
There's a secret going on there.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,390
My uncle has control of my money.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,710
Marry me, we'll secure a future.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,670
I thought you were leaving tonight.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,190
I can't go back home. Not yet.

11
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,140
But here's as good a place as any to wait.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,150
Say what you want to
say. You don't like her.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,990
I don't like that she
treated you so bad before.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,190
Things are different between us.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,780
This is business. Nothing more.

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,400
Look on the bright side. She
might jilt me all over again.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,280
Too late. Here she comes. Missed
your chance to talk me out of it

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,910
I had to endure a lecture.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,430
My uncle seems to think
the pair of us are fools.

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,470
I had to endure the same lecture.

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,710
From my housekeeper, no less.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,560
- And? What did you say?
- I told her this was business.

23
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,630
- Thru'pence.
- What?

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,190
- For that measly little bag?
- Do you want it or not? There's folks waiting.

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,190
- Well, there must be cheaper.
- None to be had.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,430
Got us over a barrel with these prices.

27
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,880
Charge what they like for it.

28
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Listen here. All of you - listen!

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,720
Market's closed. All
trading here ends today.

30
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,670
- You can't just order us to leave.
- I'm the agent here.

31
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,270
You need licences.

32
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,310
And I'm no longer giving 'em.

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,990
Anyone found trading will
be in breach of the law.

34
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,190
- And what law's that, then?
- Mine.

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,190
You want to sell your goods,
you bring them to my door.

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,830
I will give you a fair price for them.

37
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,980
- And then I'll sell them on.
- What gives you the right?!

38
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,230
Mr Blackwood.

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,150
He's given me the authority to
run this town. I'm not gonna let

40
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,200
you waggoners run up
the prices any longer.

41
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,030
Who the hell do you think you are?

42
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,280
You put your hands on me?

43
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,750
That's gonna cost you.

44
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,120
How's your lad doing? I hope
things have settled down for him.

45
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,720
It's hard to know what's
going on in his head.

46
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,240
I only wish I could turn
the clock back for him.

47
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,840
I miss seeing him around.

48
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,880
I miss all of you.

49
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,710
'Appen I could come to call?

50
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,710
Upon the whole family, like?

51
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,910
- I'm only recently widowed, Johnny.
- I didn't mean...

52
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
I only meant...

53
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,950
There's plenty more needs doing!

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,990
Get to work!

55
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,640
Go on. Ganger's calling.

56
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,510
How about The Riviera for your honeymoon?

57
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,920
Or erm... Venice perhaps.

58
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,910
Not too hot in late spring.

59
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,870
Well, we've neither the time nor the
money for a grand tour, I'm afraid.

60
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,470
- There's work to be done. Right here.
- We need you to draw up

61
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,390
a contract for us, an equal partnership.

62
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,990
We're making a tender for the viaduct.

63
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,870
Buying up all the
remaining stock between us.

64
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,710
You'll be taking on huge debts.

65
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,040
Well, I'm due an inheritance...
now that I'm married.

66
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,720
- Charles? How will you raise your half?
- I'll borrow against the house.

67
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,590
- I'll have the papers drawn up.
- We'll need them by the end of the day.

68
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,640
The money will run out
if we don't act now.

69
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,560
Well... congratulations.

70
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,670
We haven't signed yet.

71
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,200
No! Not the company.

72
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,710
The other matter!

73
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,080
Your wedding!

74
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,430
Should we perhaps shake hands?

75
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,550
Or maybe a kiss, even.

76
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,150
I've no romantic illusions, Charles.

77
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,190
I just want us to be friends.

78
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,830
And to say we achieved something.

79
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,080
Romance we can leave to
the rest of the world.

80
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Whoa! Whoa, there!

81
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
Go on!

82
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,300
I've seen worse shit-holes.

83
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Not many, mind.

84
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
A ha'penny of tea.

85
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,760
All right. How much do I owe you?

86
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,640
Er...
- Pound of flour, bacon joint, ha'penny of tea and a ball of twine!

87
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,560
Er...

88
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,720
A shilling fourpence.

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,510
Top at arithmetic in my class at school.

90
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,950
Whatever the lad says.

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,990
Thank you.

92
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,340
Got twice the brain of
that great ox, you have.

93
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,620
Two sacks of flour to shift.

94
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,470
Have to make your living elsewhere.

95
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,070
My stock's as good as anyone's.
Why won't you take it?

96
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,030
There's people I like and there's
people I don't like, see?

97
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,580
Get on your wagon and
don't ever come back again.

98
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,950
I see you, Ralph Coates.

99
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,790
Acting like you own this town.

100
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,640
You're no better than the rest of us.

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,910
Keep your hands off me!
You're not in charge here.

102
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,190
And you never will be.
All right, all right!

103
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,150
I'll break your supply
line. I'll see to it.

104
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,590
Get off me! You're a strangler!

105
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,120
What's going on here?! Stop!

106
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,070
- The lad's all mixed up!
- 3lb of loin. Same wi' t'beef.

107
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,320
He's charged me too much.

108
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,660
The boy's right, Hawk. Give
him the money he's owed.

109
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,990
Now be on your way.

110
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,540
I need a sharper mind than
yours to keep this job.

111
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,430
You got quite a head on
your shoulders there, boy.

112
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,990
I need a new grocery clerk. How about it?
- No.

113
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,680
Sir, I don't think she'd let me.

114
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,880
Give her this. Call it an advance.

115
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Who's next?

116
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,750
- Thank you.
- Grand opening tonight!

117
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Now we've got music.

118
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,430
I am a fair maiden

119
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,680
My story is sad

120
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,520
For once I was courted...

121
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,790
What's the matter? Why have you stopped?

122
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,780
Oh, I'm awful fond of this glassware

123
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,870
Mum?!

124
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,030
But now he has left me

125
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,030
And gone far away...

126
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,550
Martha? Come over here, lass.
Sing summat for us, will you?

127
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,750
Oh, I... I don't sing so good.

128
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,670
Nonsense. Come on.

129
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,630
I am a fair maiden...

130
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,070
Reckon she can entertain the
folks in here. Don't you?

131
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,110
You're kidding.

132
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,440
- That bony little nothing?
- Finish making tea, lass, will you?

133
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,790
I kept my love's company

134
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,950
By night and by day

135
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,870
But now he has left me

136
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,600
And gone far away

137
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Oh!

138
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,470
Oh! We'll advertise it proper.

139
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,710
Martha Quainton - the nightingale.

140
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,430
We could make a little stage from some of the crates.
- Oh, no. Please, no.

141
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,070
It'll be worth an extra sixpence in your wages.
- Aye.

142
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,110
Oh, ta.

143
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,320
Uh...

144
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,830
I can see why you're so keen.

145
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,430
I'll be earning my own wages
and bringing 'em home.

146
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,430
- Please let me.
- I hope to get you back in school.

147
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,950
I can keep up with my reading.

148
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,740
I've seen them children
running wild on the moor.

149
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,020
I don't want you running with them.

150
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,240
- At least this way -
- Can I go tell him?

151
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,480
Martha?

152
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,350
What's the matter?

153
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Martha?

154
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,350
- Tell her, lass. Tell her what you did!
- It were a joke.

155
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,710
That's all. Just a silly joke.

156
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,430
She tried to poison me.

157
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,190
She's a demon... she is.

158
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,110
- Ooh! Martha!
- Are you all right?

159
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,790
- What have you done to her?!
- She's making a fuss, she is.

160
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,180
It were only cleaning soda.

161
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,630
My throat burns something awful.

162
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,120
I'll go to the river,
fetch some water for you.

163
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,560
I want that little beast out of here!

164
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,500
What's the matter? Are
you all right, Annie?

165
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,340
- Where's the Partridge lad?
- Over here.

166
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,950
We need to get him to his mam.

167
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,510
What's the matter with him?

168
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,360
His neck's all swollen. 'Appen
there's fever in this town.

169
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Oh, God!

170
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
No, no, no, no.

171
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,990
Oh, she has a bad fever, sure.

172
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,800
- And her neck's swollen.
- Rose Partridge's boy's the same.

173
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,900
I've seen summat like it before.

174
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,940
Folks call it strangling angel.

175
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,280
- Please tell me she'll recover.
- I can't help her, Annie. She needs a doctor.

176
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,390
There's a fella in town.
He's not cheap, mind.

177
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,780
I'll pay anything I have to.

178
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,390
Annie. I'll go.

179
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,640
You need to be with her.

180
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,590
Erm... begging your pardon, sir.

181
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,910
- Will Mrs Blackwood be returning soon?
- She's at her uncle's house.

182
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,190
- She'll be arriving tomorrow.
- You'll be wanting a room prepared?

183
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,780
Aye. She can have the Blue Room.

184
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,110
I meant... for the two of you.

185
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,580
You must've... discussed it between you.

186
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,440
I'll make up two rooms, then.

187
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,040
The fever is infectious. Reckon she
caught it from the Partridge lad.

188
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,030
She needs a doctor. They both do.

189
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,000
Someone needs to ride to town. The cart doesn't leave till morning.
- Take my cart.

190
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,710
You're a puzzle, Prince.

191
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,150
Always eager to play the hero.
I still can't figure you out.

192
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,670
I can't figure you out myself.

193
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,160
Why does a man who built railroads in
America need to cross the seas to get work?

194
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,060
Makes me wonder what
you're leaving behind there.

195
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
You know horses? Hm?

196
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,830
Did you ever see a stallion
drive another from the herd?

197
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,160
He gets a sense of who
his strongest rival is.

198
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,110
I'm not your rival, Mr Coates.

199
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,150
Now, excuse me, would you?

200
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Any jobs going?

201
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Is there?

202
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

203
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,190
- What's going on in there?
- The Partridge lad.

204
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,160
He died.

205
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Please.

206
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
I'm not ready.

207
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
What?

208
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,110
What is it, my sweetheart? I'm here.

209
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Leaves...

210
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,870
.. and orange blossom.

211
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
I'm not ready to die.

212
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,670
They're gonna ride me through the village.

213
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,920
That's right, my darling.

214
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,630
You'll be married in lace.

215
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,950
You'll look beautiful.

216
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,390
And you can tall Ralph Coates...

217
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,350
he doesn't own this valley!

218
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,340
And his supplies aren't getting through!

219
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,750
This remote place...

220
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,340
with no-one to take care of you.

221
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,060
I wanted my girl to have everything.

222
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Please... Martha.

223
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,280
Please be strong for me.

224
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,110
Oh, thank God you're back!

225
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,910
How's Martha? How's she doing?

226
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,120
Where's the Doctor?

227
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,720
You never made it into town.
- Some Laggan men are blocking the road. I couldn't get past.

228
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,020
I don't think she'll make
it through the night.

229
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,460
What about the Blackwood house?

230
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,920
- Johnny!
- Aye.

231
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Aye, you're right.

232
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,710
They're the only ones who can help us.

233
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,640
I'm going to need you
to spend the night here.

234
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,790
I'll watch over him, Mrs Quainton.

235
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,430
Why can't I just come with you?

236
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Because I don't want you getting sick.

237
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,710
It's your first night on your own.

238
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,590
It's a new adventure.

239
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
Eh?

240
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Ya!

241
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,270
Mortgage papers. Sign here and here.

242
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,320
I'll deliver it to the
bank in the morning.

243
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,870
Let me in, Charles, please.

244
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
I've got a girl who's
dangerously ill here.

245
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,260
In the name of God, Charles,
I'm begging you to help us!

246
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,910
What's going on?

247
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,230
Annie, this is my brother.

248
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,730
Her neck's all swollen. It
seems she can't breathe proper.

249
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,380
- Strangling angel, the shanty folk call it.
- Bring her in and lay her down.

250
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,300
- Here we are.
- Hey.

251
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,570
I tried to fetch her a doctor,
but there's trouble on t'road.

252
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,610
There's no way we can get through.

253
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,050
I'll... send Easter to fetch Dr Crick.

254
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,770
He shouldn't be on the road alone.

255
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,100
I swore to myself if you ever came back
here - - The girl needs tending, Charles.

256
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,460
Fast as you can, Easter.

257
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:38,020
- What's going on out there?
- Just some navvies from the shanty town.

258
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,060
I need that wage money. Deliver these
immediately, will you, so we can raise the capital.

259
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,490
Are you all right sleeping down there?

260
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,810
The takings from today.

261
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,330
We made a proper fortune here.

262
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,810
The people that live out here have
nothing but what the traders bring.

263
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,860
But he who controls the flow of
trade, that man would be king.

264
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,930
What are you doing?

265
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,130
Well, the king has to
be bountiful sometimes.

266
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,490
I'm making a food parcel for Mrs Laggan.

267
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,480
Her husband died in the uh... explosion.

268
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,180
Hey, that fella they call the prince.

269
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,450
- I see him hanging around your ma.
- You mean Johnny?

270
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Mm.

271
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,640
I thought they might...

272
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,100
I thought they might be together.

273
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,690
- 'Appen Polly's in?
- She had to go out.

274
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,730
Is it urgent?

275
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,770
You a friend of Polly's?

276
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,810
Anything I can help you with?

277
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,930
I come and see her regular, like.

278
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,970
Why don't you come and see me?

279
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,020
You might prefer it.

280
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,290
I'd do you for a shilling six.

281
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,610
Sixpence cheaper than her.

282
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,330
Does she know you're undercutting her?

283
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,180
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

284
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,570
- Seems I don't know you after all.
- I never said nothing to you that were a lie.

285
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,450
Why is your brother so
angry with you, Johnny?

286
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,130
He reckons I turned my
back on this family.

287
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,860
And did you?

288
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,570
I brought a tonic for her.

289
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,380
Good girl.

290
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,930
Alma. What are you doing?

291
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,210
I were stupid! I were jealous.

292
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,570
What are you talking about?

293
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,610
Martha Quainton.

294
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,400
They say that she's at death's door.

295
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,450
No! Don't try and stop me!

296
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,490
I need to do this.

297
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,700
I need to do all of the chores. It's
the least I can do to make amends.

298
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,570
You've not heard, then?

299
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,220
It's nowt to do with you. She's got fever.

300
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,370
Well, I must've caused it.

301
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,760
Partridge boy had it worse.

302
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,330
- You didn't do nowt to him, did you?
- She said it were me.

303
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,010
My mam. She said I were
the one what had done it.

304
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,650
I've been scrubbing this
place from top to bottom.

305
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,610
- She probably wanted her floors washing.
- Oh, damn her!

306
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,370
The girl's up at the house. But
she needs a doctor bad, sir.

307
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,930
Mr Blackwood took the girl
in, did he? Imagine that.

308
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,090
Some men have blocked the road.
I'll need help getting through.

309
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,170
There's navvies here are
broad enough to see them off.

310
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,320
I'll appoint someone
to come along with you.

311
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,690
All quiet around here, then?

312
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:53,210
Aye. Not much doing. No trade.

313
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,940
You did say... all vittles are shared.

314
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,180
As soon as I make some
clink, I'll pay my way.

315
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,010
Trade's been slow, has it?

316
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
You get one chance.

317
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,780
Don't try and make a fool out of me.
I've been in this game a long time.

318
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,730
Pretend this never
happened, then, shall we?

319
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,770
I'm sorry.

320
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,820
Things have been bad.

321
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,120
Place I worked in before,
fella who owned it...

322
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,880
- .. used to get drunk and...
- Knock you about, did he?

323
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,840
Just been used to taking care
of myself and no-one else.

324
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,940
Well, we take care of each other.

325
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,450
Here.

326
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,440
Start paying your way with the next one.

327
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,540
They'll be armed with just cudgels, so...

328
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,730
.. no match for you with this.

329
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,370
A girl's life depends on you.

330
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,850
- Find that doctor. Bring him back to us.
- Why are you putting me in charge?

331
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,180
You're a decent man. Honest...
strong. Go along with this gentleman.

332
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,980
You can be our watchman.

333
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,570
I thought maybe you were dead.

334
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,160
I was working in Africa a while.

335
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,260
- And Father tracked me down there.
- He told you he was sick?

336
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,850
You're too late for him!

337
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,900
Aye. I know.

338
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,770
I'm sorry for it.

339
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,290
The girl - she's taken a bad turn.

340
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,730
Come on! Come on.

341
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,170
Lovely girl, come on.
She's barely breathing.

342
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,370
- I don't know what to do.
- The poison makes a canker in her throat.

343
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,330
- There must be something we can do!
- Martha, can you hear me?

344
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,370
Martha!

345
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,170
Somebody do something! Please!

346
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,250
I'll need a knife from the kitchen.
- What?

347
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,330
I saw my mother save a
child on the plantation.

348
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,580
Reckon I can save her.
But I'll need a knife.

349
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,090
Wait. What are you going to do to her?

350
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,080
It will be easier... if you're not here.

351
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,050
- What's going on, Mr Coates?
- There's trouble in the valley tonight.

352
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,660
But you're safe in here, son.
Don't you worry about nothing.

353
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,740
Davey! Davey!

354
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,410
I'll cut you down like a hare!

355
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,060
I grew up in this house.

356
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,620
I sat on these stairs some nights,
watching the light from my father's study.

357
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,760
I still remember the
creak of that banister.

358
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,300
She's out of danger.

359
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
Thank you, sir!

360
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,090
- I see you broke the blockade, then.
- The other fella fled across t'dales.

361
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,410
I'll take him back to Jericho,
lock him up and fetch a magistrate.

362
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:38,220
No, no, no. You head on over to the
scaffold. I'll take him from here.

363
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,520
I reckon we owe you a debt.

364
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,970
Any man can be anything he wants here.

365
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,160
Just you remember that.

366
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,970
How long are you planning to stay?

367
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,010
Already you're anxious to be rid of me?

368
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,010
Let's not pretend we have any
appetite for this reunion.

369
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,570
You wanted no part of this family. Fine.

370
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,340
Get back out on the road.

371
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,000
What's the matter? Lost
something, have you?

372
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,480
No wonder you tried to hide it, Charles.

373
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,850
John James Blackwood -
deceased. You declared me dead!

374
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,490
Missing for more than seven years...

375
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,890
a man's death can be made legal.

376
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,410
That's what my lawyers advised me.

377
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,330
I didn't know when you would
come home... or even if!

378
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,780
I see. So you thought you'd just...
hasten that day along a little.

379
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,290
The terms of his will!

380
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,290
He left everything to you and not to me.

381
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,930
That's why he wanted you here. No matter
that you'd turned your back on him.

382
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,010
He still forgave you everything.
Didn't matter what I did.

383
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,810
Nursed him through his dying days!

384
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,370
He still left Blackwood House to you!

385
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,780
Can you imagine how that feels?!

386
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,370
I just assumed...

387
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,620
I thought he'd cut me
off without a shilling.

388
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,530
Charles.

389
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,020
I didn't come here... just
to claim an inheritance.

390
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,690
There's none to claim.

391
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,480
The house is all we have left, John.

392
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,050
This viaduct...

393
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,300
It's almost bled me dry.

394
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,330
I need to borrow money against the house.

395
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,210
Otherwise, everything I've
built here will vanish.

396
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,340
So, if you're to have your money,
you want me to just walk away.

397
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,810
If he was willing to forgive me...

398
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,260
if he wanted me to be here...

399
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,810
.. then why can't you do the same?

400
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,720
Oh, don't play the dutiful son.

401
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,370
It doesn't convince me.

402
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,850
You never truly cared for him.
You never cared for anyone.

403
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,610
You stand between me
and everything I want.

404
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,970
Only John Blackwood...

405
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,780
would have the arrogance to ruin
people's dreams and not give a damn!

406
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,130
Enjoying this, are you

407
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,420
Can't pretend I'm not
happy seeing you like this.

408
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,820
That is true.

409
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:35,770
- What are you doing? You letting me loose?
- Don't want no magistrates poking their nose in.

410
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,810
This town is mine.

411
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,770
- What are you gonna tell 'em?
- Tell 'em you escaped.

412
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,330
Jumped me when I stopped
to get you some water.

413
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,120
That's why you chose that dumb lad.

414
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,170
Why you put that gun in his hand.

415
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,460
Sweet-natured fella... like him.

416
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,530
Means you can control him like a dog.

417
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,680
They will arrest you if you show up again.

418
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,290
Maybe you can pay me back sometime

419
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,610
She'll remain with us. No question.

420
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,660
Mm.

421
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,650
Hey.

422
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,260
You - rest easy.

423
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,260
You've got the whole Blackwood
family waiting on you.

424
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,420
I must go see George. I'll be back soon.

425
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,900
I were bringing these flowers for
Martha, Mrs Quainton. How is she?

426
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,880
Well, I came to say... I'm proper sorry.

427
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,450
And I were hoping... maybe...

428
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,370
she and I could be friends, or summat.

429
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,040
You didn't bring those flowers for Martha.

430
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:03,180
You brought them to stop
people from thinking ill of you.

431
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,650
You're right. Weren't my idea.

432
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,980
Well... I suppose you can
tell folk it's all made up now.

433
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,290
Aye, there's a few girls here.

434
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,280
But... you won't find one
as fun as me, though.

435
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,050
How old are you, girl?

436
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,540
18, 19, hm?

437
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,940
How old do you want me to be?

438
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,210
Pardon me, ma'am.

439
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,460
I prefer someone with a
little more schooling.

440
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,890
You seem in good spirits.

441
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:49,440
- Smile on your face.
- Oh, it's been a good day.

442
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,410
Young girl didn't take your fancy?

443
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,770
You know, girls that age...

444
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,220
they ain't got no discretion.

445
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,780
I need you to forget
what you're gonna see.

446
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,760
What's that there on your skin?

447
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,260
An injustice.

448
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,130
Something you should know.
Your brother got wed.

449
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,860
- Who is she?
- Miss Lambton.

450
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,780
Do you remember her?

451
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,130
Finally persuaded her, did he?

452
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,410
I know why you truly fled this place.

453
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,450
Your brother doesn't
know anything about it.

454
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,850
If you set foot in here again,

455
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,060
I will spill it!

456
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,580
I can't believe he came back.

457
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,650
I didn't expect this.

458
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,700
He can't stay here!

459
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,740
- He can't be a part of our lives, Charles.
- There's something I have to tell you.

460
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,010
The estate belongs to him.

461
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,220
What?!
- It's fine. He says he wants no part of it.

462
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,860
But if you can't prove it's yours, we're
no longer free to raise the money on it.

463
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,290
My uncle, he only agreed
to my having my inheritance

464
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,010
on the understanding that
you would match the money.

465
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,360
So you're telling me we
haven't got a farthing?

466
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,060
Annie?

467
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,820
What's wrong?

468
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,890
I'm grateful for what you did for Martha.
But I'm sorry, I can't let you in.

469
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,740
What is it? What's the matter?

470
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,820
I can't be with a man who lies to me,
Johnny! I don't know who you are!

471
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,090
I came here to see my father afore he died.
- Really?

472
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,640
Then you tell me plain. Why have
you been hiding in this valley?

473
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,210
My brother and I... we find it
hard to act civil round each other.

474
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,860
No, that's not an answer, Johnny.

475
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,770
That's your family home.

476
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,850
That's your own kin. And
you've not even been near!

477
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,900
Annie, please!

478
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,100
You're the reason...
I've stayed here so long.

479
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:55,200
And just because I'm a Blackwood...

480
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,060
George!
