1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,470
George killed a man. If the navvies
take the law into their own hands...

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,190
Bring a blanket to wrap him
in. We have to bury the body.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,080
They've already dug a grave for
Jack. We'll bury him beneath.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,990
- It's high time you asked me to marry you.
- Do you mean it?

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,230
'I've always been sweet on you.'

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,910
Agree to my partnership and
everything can be saved.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,550
All of our problems are solved.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,390
- Doesn't that count for something?
- You can't believe it's a good idea.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,470
Why not?
- You'd forget everything that went on between us?

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,230
- You need somewhere to stay.
- Are you offering me bed and board again?

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,670
- What's going on?
- We just wanted what was owed.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,350
They should be punished. I'll
get authority from your brother.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,800
You have mine. Understand?

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,140
The best access site to quarry is...

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,400
over there.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,960
So I'll need a spare
key to the Steam Truck.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,000
And for the Tommy Shop.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,160
And the blast store.

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,480
There's only one and I hold it.

20
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,280
And I'm asking for it.

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,750
I run this place, I look after these men,

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,540
I make sure the work is on track.

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,230
I've earned this position.

24
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,830
Making amends with your brother
doesn't give you the right

25
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,070
to challenge my authority.

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,790
Charles' letter says different.

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Annie, come here.

28
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,080
Morning.

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,670
I wonder, kind sir, would you
be so kind as to pass myself

30
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,990
some more bread, please?

31
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,310
Living with your prince and a Blackwood,

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,710
can't forget my manners, he?

33
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,950
Then get your elbows off the table.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,830
And you.

35
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,470
And enjoy my company all you can.

36
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,910
Think I'll spend forever
with you reprobates?

37
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,720
Dagger... Here, take some breakfast.

38
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,960
Thanks.

39
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,710
Right, then. It's time you were off.

40
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,430
Here, Devon, take your lunch.

41
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,350
Dagger.

42
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,920
So, erm, are we going to be
living together now, then?

43
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,310
He'll want his own place. That's how it's done.
- How what's done?

44
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,630
Posh folks' living arrangements.

45
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,270
When I was at the Blackwood house,

46
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,950
Mr Blackwood had his room,
Mrs Blackwood had hers.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,870
That's none of our business, is it?

48
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Yards and yards of the finest
silks. Every colour you can imagine.

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,200
Are they just for dresses?

50
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,070
That's practically one
for each day of the month.

51
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,310
Paris would suit you.

52
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,150
Anywhere but this middling
place would suit me.

53
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,390
You're funny.

54
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,640
You make me laugh.

55
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,470
We should spend some time alone.

56
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,910
Private.

57
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,640
Not just stolen conversations
before somebody else walks in.

58
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,040
Well, I'll make time.

59
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,440
Charles. Isabella. Come in.

60
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,560
Sorry to disturb you, but there
is a matter we need to discuss.

61
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,390
- We need your help.
- What is it?

62
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,710
I'm sorry.
- Don't apologise, it's us who have come into your home.

63
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,910
Sorry to be an inconvenience.

64
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,440
- I'll get out of your way.
- You're all right, Annie.

65
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,040
So what help? What's to do?

66
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,030
We need to put the quarry on the
land where the graves are now.

67
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,070
It's rich in sandstone. Quarrying
our own stone will save a fortune.

68
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,870
The bodies will have to be moved.

69
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,030
- You can't.
- Annie.

70
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,310
It's a resting place.

71
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,510
You can't put business
before people's feelings.

72
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,950
I have the same reservations, but it
is the only place where the stone is.

73
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,790
- To secure the future of the viaduct...
- When was this arranged?

74
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,070
- Charles and I made the plans.
- There is no choice.

75
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,840
If the business is to thrive,
the bodies have to be exhumed.

76
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,400
I'm sure we can find a suitable
resting place for the remains.

77
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,760
We can talk through the details with Coates later.
- All right.

78
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,550
The trouble we've made for ourselves.

79
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,030
We should have left Red where he was.

80
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,430
A man with enemies found dead,
no-one would have batted an eye.

81
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,480
- We buried him.
- And look what happened.

82
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,670
I'll talk to Charles,
they can quarry elsewhere.

83
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,390
How, Johnny? That's the only place.
You heard him. The decision's made.

84
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,480
What's going on?

85
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,800
Stop. George, stop.

86
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,430
They'll find him then call me a murderer.

87
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,350
Don't panic and it'll be all right.

88
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

89
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,260
What's got you all worked up?

90
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,520
An argument about chores he refuses to do.

91
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
I'm sorry.

92
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,560
I'm sorry. You made me
forget myself and I shouldn't.

93
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,150
Rory, wait.

94
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,470
No, Alma, it's for the best.

95
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,630
I can't disrupt your life like
this. It's asking too much of you.

96
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,360
I got carried away. It's just...

97
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,200
You're too hard to resist.

98
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Then don't.

99
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,310
I reckon we should offer any
man who can stomach this job

100
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,840
- an extra day's wage.
- No need. I'll dig the graves myself.

101
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,910
As a member of the family demanding
this desecration is that wise?

102
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,710
We demand this sacrilege. We should
be willing to do it ourselves.

103
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,430
No, Coates is right. You can't.

104
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,190
Then find volunteers,

105
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,470
but I must be allowed
to work alongside them.

106
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,190
- I'll take charge on the day.
- Get Davey to round up volunteers

107
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,950
but do nothing until I've
spoken to the families involved,

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,390
the Partridge boy's parents and
Jack's widow. Her name again?

109
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,800
- Hatty.
- Hatty.

110
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,120
I could stay here all
day just watching you.

111
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,230
Nobody's said that to me before,

112
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,960
but then I've never been in
a position where a man might.

113
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,800
Hm.

114
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,190
That's just my luck.

115
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,150
What is?
- To fall for somebody already engaged to another man.

116
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,150
It's nothing but a promise. It
isn't like we're already wed,

117
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,960
and now the two us have...

118
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,070
Well, it changes everything.

119
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,790
I could break it off with Davey,

120
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,440
but I'd have to leave.

121
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,320
I couldn't ask you to do that,

122
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,720
giving up everything.

123
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,350
None of that matters when it's true love.

124
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,270
I'm sorry, I know how much
of a shock this must be.

125
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,070
- His final resting place desecrated.
- I have no choice.

126
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,110
- You could work around the burial site.
- No good will come of this.

127
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,630
It's disrespectful. He
should be left where he is.

128
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,630
Every care will be taken. A new
headstone will be purchased.

129
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,200
Made of the same stone
you're digging him up for?

130
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,110
I'd like proper words on it,

131
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,550
not like now, just his
name scratched on timber.

132
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,030
Something to see. He
was a good man, he was.

133
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,120
And is.

134
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,110
Still in my heart.

135
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,760
That's what matters, isn't it?

136
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,030
Hatty, are you sure?

137
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,310
A man has a right to
lie where he's buried.

138
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,080
Then I should be there when
he's taken from the ground.

139
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,150
You don't have to. Don't
upset yourself further.

140
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,950
But I want to. Will you
come with me, Annie?

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,680
Please.

142
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,830
Of course.

143
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,000
Thank you for your
understanding, Mrs Laggan.

144
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,390
You saw him.

145
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,870
George is not up to
this, he's still a child.

146
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,030
He's coping better than you think.

147
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,350
He needs to stay brave
a little while longer.

148
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,430
We got caught up in a terrible situation.

149
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,470
- The whole thing was an accident.
- I know.

150
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,190
But nobody's going to find out.

151
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,070
You make sure they only dig so
far and they only find two bodies.

152
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,390
They'll find nothing
they're not looking for,

153
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,030
then we'll get rid of Red before
work on the quarry starts.

154
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,120
Trust me.

155
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,380
Then that's an end to it.

156
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,320
I promise.

157
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,750
There's nothing safe around
here, not even the dead.

158
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,870
It's business.

159
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,670
A man takes an opportunity
where he gets it.

160
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,870
- Johnny's just taking his.
- He's a right to it.

161
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,550
At my expense? What's the use of me

162
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,190
building up my authority
to have it taken away?

163
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,270
You came here with nowt and soon
made a position for yourself.

164
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,430
You're practically the
right hand of Charles.

165
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,350
With Charles it was simple
- make myself indispensable.

166
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,870
That won't work with Johnny.

167
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,960
He's cut from something very
different to his brother.

168
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:56,030
Davey, I thought when you've got a
moment we could sit down and talk.

169
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,920
Not now, Alma. After, all right?

170
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,310
Here we go. We know
what you're going to ask.

171
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,550
There's no chance either of us will do it.

172
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,910
- It's double pay.
- They say it possesses you.

173
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,870
Prise open the coffin of a dead
man, his spirit leeches onto yours.

174
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,440
The only spirit leeched
on you is that whisky.

175
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,350
I understand you've given Blackwood
a mind for this grave business.

176
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,840
It's a cold heart that
can meddle with the dead.

177
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,550
I'm only doing my job.

178
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,520
I reckon you can do it elsewhere,
I won't have it under my roof.

179
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,680
50 men asked, not a
volunteer amongst them.

180
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,070
It seems there's no man willing
to take on the grave digging,

181
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,910
so if there's a job to be
done, I reckon I should do it.

182
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,240
You can't do this alone.

183
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,360
I'll help.

184
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,910
I'm neither family nor navvy.

185
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,320
It makes all this easier.

186
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,780
I'd be happy to work alongside John.

187
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,110
Are you sure you're
steady enough for this?

188
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,750
If the business is to work there
can't be any atmosphere between us.

189
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,950
There's none on my side.

190
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,230
Besides, you're my brother's wife now.

191
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,470
And you have Annie. I like her.

192
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,830
She seems like a decent woman.

193
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,590
It can't have been easy, widowed,
left penniless without a home,

194
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,110
forced to be nothing
but a glorified skivvy.

195
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,870
- If you've something to say, say it.
- I'd tread carefully if I were you.

196
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,710
There are certain divides not
even love can make up for.

197
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,430
You say that? You don't
even share my brother's bed.

198
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,310
- What divides lie between you?
- That's none of your business.

199
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,750
And what do you understand
about Charles and me?

200
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,150
You talk about divides,
but there is admiration,

201
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,470
respect, loyalty.

202
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,320
That's what matters in a marriage.

203
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,360
Values I doubt you even
know the meaning of.

204
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,560
Thank you.

205
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,190
I appreciate you coming.

206
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,200
All right, let's get these
coffins back to Jericho.

207
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,350
This ground is soft.

208
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,720
There's something else underneath.

209
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,040
Oh. There's another body.

210
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,510
Can you tell who it is, Coates?

211
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,640
It's Red Killeen.

212
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,390
Red Killeen vanished.

213
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,550
Now we know where.

214
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,350
What are we going to do with his body?

215
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Bury him, but not alongside the others.

216
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,550
Well, whoever's responsible
knew how to cover their tracks.

217
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,950
He fooled us all. And Bamford.

218
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,230
And now there's a murderer in the town.

219
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,080
The killer might not even be here.

220
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,910
Navvies come and go. It
could've been any one of them.

221
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,270
Could be in Jericho right now.

222
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,040
Why would anyone risk staying
put? I reckon they're long gone.

223
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,910
Navvies close ranks. Any
attempt to find who did this,

224
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,600
it'll come to nothing.

225
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,910
You and Johnny said they wouldn't find him.
- I know.

226
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,070
What's going to happen now?

227
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,310
They found nothing that
says we're involved.

228
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,950
Anybody could've put Red in there.

229
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,200
I promise you, George,

230
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,640
they'll rebury him and this
whole thing will be over.

231
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,030
Sly as a fox, the one who did this.

232
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,350
Dumping Red's body like that?

233
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,590
I'll be locking my door tonight.

234
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,790
There's a killer on the loose.

235
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,200
Who could do this?

236
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,190
It's bad enough my Jack lay dead.

237
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,110
To dump his killer alongside him...

238
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,870
He should hang for that alone.

239
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,260
I'd tie the noose myself.

240
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,240
Come on, Hatty, love.

241
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Come in.

242
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,680
Bad business.

243
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,040
Another dead man in the grave.

244
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
But I saw you

245
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,340
take something from his body.

246
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,680
This?

247
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,630
Evidence.

248
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,480
I need all I can get if I'm
going to find who killed Red.

249
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,150
Could be of some use.

250
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,870
Might even point to who did it.

251
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,860
- You don't miss much, do you?
- Hm-hm.

252
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,800
Here, take this.

253
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,600
You should be paid for what you did today.

254
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,470
I don't need money.

255
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,070
Any man that volunteered
was to get double wages

256
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,590
and you did. It's only fair.

257
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,550
It's a proud moment when a man
receives his first ever wage,

258
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,140
no matter how he comes by it.

259
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,670
Been an unsettling day for everybody.

260
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,710
Hm.

261
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,160
But there's plenty in
town to distract you.

262
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,950
Here, go, enjoy yourself.

263
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,800
Maybe you'll pay me back sometime.

264
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,160
We could slip away now
and nobody would notice.

265
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,310
Come on. I still have work to do here.

266
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,840
Say when. I only have to pack
a bag and I'm ready to go.

267
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,360
Quietly? Without fuss?

268
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,470
You're right. Can't hang about too long,

269
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,600
once the others have found out
you've stolen Davey's intended.

270
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,300
Then let's leave tonight.

271
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,990
Really?

272
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,000
I could finish up with Blackwood
and we could be on our way.

273
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,710
Charles?

274
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,190
A clearing just there, it's perfect.

275
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,560
I don't want the men reburied on the
other side of Jericho. It's bleak.

276
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,680
They deserve a decent resting
place. New headstones.

277
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,750
I know what happened was an accident,

278
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,910
but they gave their lives to our viaduct.

279
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,230
It's the least I can do.

280
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,160
Isabella?

281
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,230
I know you wanted this marriage to grow

282
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,870
into something more than
a business transaction

283
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,430
but I never believed it possible,

284
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,550
but you've changed

285
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,640
so much, Charles.

286
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,830
We've both changed.

287
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,420
We're not the people we were.

288
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,160
- Can you forgive me?
- There's nothing to forgive.

289
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,140
I want to be with you

290
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,230
in your life,

291
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
in your bedroom,

292
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
as a proper wife.

293
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,270
Don't say something you might regret.

294
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,240
I won't.

295
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,440
I haven't.

296
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,960
What are you doing?

297
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,670
How's Hatty?

298
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,150
Terrible business, Red
being found like that.

299
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,840
It doesn't give you the right to
come into my home and nose about.

300
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,200
His body was found wrapped in a blanket.

301
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,840
Why are you telling me?

302
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,720
Aren't you missing one?

303
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,580
Not that I've noticed.

304
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,710
Had your initials on it.

305
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,750
AQ,

306
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,840
Annie Quaintain.

307
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,870
Quite a few shillings to be
burning a hole in your pocket.

308
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,030
Mr Coates says I deserve it

309
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,560
and that after today I
should enjoy myself.

310
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,030
He's right about that.

311
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,160
I thought this'd be the
best place to start.

312
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,630
Sweeten me with a tot of gin

313
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,190
and I'll show you an even
better place to finish.

314
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,270
Oh.

315
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,660
I've had all this before,

316
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,190
detectives standing where
you are, asking questions.

317
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,390
I've nothing new to tell you.

318
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,110
We didn't have a body back then

319
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,640
and with the blanket there's a
direct link to someone in your house.

320
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,920
Anybody could've taken it,

321
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,520
including you.

322
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,070
Happy to let yourself into
my home without permission.

323
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,390
How do I know you've not done it before?

324
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,830
You're not the only one
who lives under this roof.

325
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,560
Who else was here at the time?

326
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,350
Skinny, paying bed and board.

327
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,540
And Johnny Blackwood.

328
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,150
He and Red never saw eye to eye.

329
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,340
A lot of folk didn't.

330
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,320
A lot of folk didn't
come to blows, did they?

331
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,320
- George.
- Mr Coates.

332
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,440
George, you stay in that room.

333
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,480
George.

334
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,750
You're wasting your time,
it's nothing to do with Johnny.

335
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,000
How can you be so sure?

336
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,470
He lied to us all.

337
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,790
Who knows what kind of
deceit he's capable of?

338
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,110
He's also shown himself
to be fair and decent.

339
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,230
Yes. He's a smart and educated man,

340
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,710
more so than any other man here.

341
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,350
Who else would have the cunning
to ditch a body in that place?

342
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,750
And be daft enough to stay put in Jericho?

343
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,630
You don't have to protect him.

344
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,760
From what exactly?

345
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,830
You stand there, you try to intimidate me

346
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,990
into saying words against Johnny.

347
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,580
I don't have to stomach this.

348
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,980
I reckon you should leave, Mr Coates.

349
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
Go on.

350
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,510
Mrs Blackwood sent me to
move her things to your room.

351
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,590
Everything?

352
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,750
As it should be, man and wife together.

353
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,790
I'm glad for you.

354
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,950
She's good for me. She was open
and honest about everything.

355
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,150
She thought we'd started
this marriage on a lie.

356
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,670
- She begged to be forgiven.
- And have you? - Of course.

357
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,790
I hope she'll be worthy of it.

358
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,390
We can't let the past get
in the way of our future.

359
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,630
- John's return shows that.
- His return has made her ask for forgiveness.

360
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,630
She was scared it'd be written on
her face when he walks in the room.

361
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,030
There's no bad blood between them.

362
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,870
Guilt made her admit they'd laid together.

363
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,600
I hate to see you made a fool
of any more than you have been.

364
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,350
John and Isabella were together?

365
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,070
Is that what you're telling me?

366
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,440
No.

367
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,150
No.

368
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,120
I thought that's what you
were said you forgave her for.

369
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,070
Charlie, forget what I just told you.

370
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,520
But you've already said it.

371
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,750
Leave those.

372
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,920
Leave them and say nothing of this.

373
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,430
He just went on and on,
question after question

374
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,680
and then George appeared. I swear,
he was about to say something.

375
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,070
I don't think he'll last much longer.

376
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,510
Coates sees an opportunity.

377
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,750
He reckons he has evidence.

378
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,870
He doesn't need evidence.

379
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,190
He's been after me since
I first set foot here.

380
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,870
We have to tread very carefully,

381
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,910
give nothing away.

382
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,960
He knows exactly what he's doing
and he's got you cornered.

383
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,320
Coates is stirring up
trouble about Red's death.

384
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,350
He even believes I've
something to do with it.

385
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,150
- You're capable of handling Coates.
- He's doing this to divide us,

386
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,560
even if it means tying me to a murder.

387
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,510
We shouldn't stand for it.

388
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,430
Is it always somebody else's fault,

389
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,030
the chaos that surrounds you?

390
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,270
It's always you, John,

391
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,600
at the centre of the
heartache, the turmoil.

392
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,910
You left here, destroyed
our father's life,

393
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,470
returned years later and lied
your way into the town I built.

394
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,230
- I had no choice.
- You never do.

395
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,390
Presumably, it wasn't your choice
to have an affair with Isabella?

396
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,790
I dare you to stand there and deny it.

397
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,830
Prove to me that you're not a liar.

398
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,870
Go on, deny it.

399
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
You can't.

400
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:58,400
Perhaps Coates understands
exactly the type of man you are.

401
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,830
You're disloyal, a liar, a cheat.

402
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,070
Is it unreasonable to
assume a murderer, too?

403
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,260
Charles... Charles...

404
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,090
Johnny, you don't mean it.

405
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,300
- You can't go away.
- I have to.

406
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
But we agreed.

407
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,370
- What's changed?
- Coates.

408
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,060
He won't let this lie

409
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,980
and I reckon Charles believes him.

410
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,410
If you go, if you leave,

411
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,210
it makes you look guilty, it
plays right into his hands.

412
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,220
It's better folk think it's me
than harm comes to you and George.

413
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,250
I love my son and I
will do anything for him,

414
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,650
but I won't let you take responsibility.

415
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,840
You don't understand.

416
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,890
I've just found the place
where I truly belong.

417
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,490
The thought of leaving...

418
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,060
But it's best for everyone.

419
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
We've come so far.

420
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,260
- I won't let you go.
- Annie, you have to.

421
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,780
Coates won't let this go. How
long until he gets to the truth?

422
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,640
And I can't put you through that.

423
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,020
Please.

424
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,900
Annie, let me do this

425
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,540
for you all.

426
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,770
It's best that I go tonight.

427
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,060
How could this be goodbye?

428
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,740
Charles.

429
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,490
I was waiting for you.

430
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,050
But my things,

431
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,170
they're still in my room.

432
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:52,140
Epiphany has been busy. I doubt
she's found the time to move them.

433
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,250
- Is your mum in?
- Mum.

434
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,170
- Hi, love. Annie.
- There you go.

435
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,170
This business with Red. Coates has
been asking all sorts of questions.

436
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,370
I know. Yesterday, he
tried to interrogate me.

437
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,970
It's Johnny he's fixated with.
It's all folk can talk about.

438
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,210
I don't believe a word of it,

439
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,780
but Johnny has to know
what he's waking up to.

440
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,120
Annie, you need to fetch him.

441
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,500
Aye.

442
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,930
Johnny?

443
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,220
He's not here. He must've
made an early start.

444
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,180
Annie?

445
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,700
He's gone.

446
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,980
- Is Johnny Blackwood here?
- No. Why would he be?

447
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:46,330
- What's going on?
- He's looking for John.

448
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,450
Sir, a word.

449
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,500
- Perhaps in private.
- No need. Say what you have to.

450
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,570
Evidence indicates your brother may
be involved in the murder of Red.

451
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,570
I'm sorry to say that now he's gone.

452
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,610
It's not John.

453
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,650
He's not capable of killing a man.

454
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,890
There must be evidence to clear his name.

455
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,970
- He'll be miles away by now.
- He did his best to convince me

456
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,970
not to investigate the murder. Now we know why.
- You think he's guilty?

457
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:20,890
You'd defend him? Him out of the
way, isn't this what you wanted?

458
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,610
- It's you that I care about.
- Then aren't I lucky to have you?

459
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,400
My brother will need to be found.

460
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,240
Are you really sure, sir?

461
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,450
If it was any other man, I'd be
expected to send a search party.

462
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,100
It'll be no different for him.

463
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,540
Yes, sir.

464
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,820
You're not the first and
you won't be the last, love.

465
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,890
I'm such an idiot.

466
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,300
The world is full of men like Rory.

467
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,060
Promise the earth to get what they want.

468
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,420
Well, he did.

469
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,620
I laid with him, Mum.

470
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,370
And I need to tell Davey.

471
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,020
He ain't going to want me now.

472
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,140
Do you still want him?

473
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:23,780
Because if you do there's not a
single reason why he should know.

474
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,090
Won't he be able to tell?

475
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,980
Your father couldn't the
night that we got wed.

476
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:39,490
Like I say, the world is full
of men like Rory McCleod.

477
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,940
I lost my head to one, too.

478
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,850
But you soon realise they're
not worth your tears.

479
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,250
They're nowt but...

480
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,820
show off and bluster.

481
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,850
It's the ones that stick by you,

482
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,050
that love you day in, day out,

483
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,100
even when you give them reason not to.

484
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,100
That's a real man.

485
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
That's your Davey.

486
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,450
Oh, love, love.

487
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:14,010
A prince? A gentleman? All
this time nowt but a murderer.

488
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:18,210
I don't believe it. Not Johnny.
He was always so decent and fair.

489
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,370
Then why turn tail like a coward, eh?

490
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,780
I never trusted him.

491
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,450
Of all places, Annie. To
dump Red alongside my Jack?

492
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,370
Hatty...
- Did you know? Are you covering for what Johnny did?

493
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,810
I'd tell you if I knew anything,

494
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,260
and nothing's been proved.

495
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,420
I'm ready to face what comes.
