1
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,730
- 'Hey, Dylan.'
- Why've you got your coat on?

2
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,090
Are you naked underneath?

3
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,490
'Look, we need to talk.'

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,850
Oh, yeah, we're going to talk all right.

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,090
'Dylan, this isn't going
to be easy to say.

6
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,770
- 'You're dumped.'
- What?!

7
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,250
- 'I've met someone else.'
- Who?!

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,610
'A guy at uni. You'd like him, actually.'

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,330
Well, I fucking doubt it!

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,930
Why are you doing this?

11
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,170
'I don't know, maybe he's
just better than you'.

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,970
- What, you mean, sex-wise?
- 'Well, yeah. But also generally.'

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,610
This is the worst wank ever.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,290
- 'Ready, babe?
- 'Yeah, almost done.'

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,010
He's there?! In the room with you?

16
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,930
That is it!

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,490
Right, Zoe, I'm going to go out tonight

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,440
and I'm going to pull so many
girls and I'm going to bang...

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,690
Work weekend. I hope it's not
bloody paintballing again.

20
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,010
Bryony from head office
has got it in for me

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,970
and those pellets really smart.

22
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,170
Dylan, you have only been
there for three weeks.

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,970
No, I don't think it's
been a good innings.

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,690
And don't use cricketing
terminology to try and get round me.

25
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,650
- Look, just don't do anything stupid.
I'll call you back. - What's happened?

26
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,130
It's Dylan. He wants to
drop out of university.

27
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,170
What?!

28
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,490
He's only been there a month.

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,730
I know. And what a lovely month it's been.

30
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,930
Oh, well.

31
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,610
If he doesn't like it. He's never
been at home in academia, Ken.

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,090
He's not in academia, Lorna.
He's doing media studies.

33
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,970
And besides, university
is about more than that.

34
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,330
It's about Dylan discovering
himself as a person,

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,650
whilst not living in MY house.

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,330
It's not the end of the world,
Dad. I never went to uni.

37
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,980
- Yeah, look what happened here.
- Oh, what DID happen?

38
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,130
You became a lovely, rounded young lady,

39
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,570
with a worthy job in charity.

40
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,930
Hoo-hoo! Great run, Dale! Morning, guys.

41
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,970
Dylan's not like you.
Someone's going to have to go

42
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,370
and talk the toerag into staying.

43
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,290
Well, you'll have to go
down to the university.

44
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,090
I'm busy team building with some
people I've known for over ten years.

45
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,490
Oh, very well -- once again,

46
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,410
- I will shoulder the burden of
responsible parenting. - Good.

47
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,090
I'm just going to go and say
goodbye to my little Siddle-diddle.

48
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,650
Wait. You're going to visit Dylan
at university? I want to come.

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,450
Well, you can't. It's going
to be tricky situation, so...

50
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,410
- Well, I'll help out. And I
won't take no as an answer! - No?

51
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,130
- What if it's a really firm no?
- Won't take it!

52
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,740
- I might try anyway, see how I get on. No.
- I'm still coming!

53
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,290
- Hi. - Hi. - I've always
wanted to see a university.

54
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,610
- What do people usually wear?
- Are you sure you want to go?

55
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,490
I'm looking after Baby Sid on
my own today. Quite a handful.

56
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,490
Which Frisbee should I
bring, red or yellow?

57
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,330
- I mean, you could stay and help me out.
- And miss out on university?

58
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,410
No thanks!

59
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,410
Because otherwise it's
just going to be me...

60
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,090
on my own...

61
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,450
in the house.

62
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,490
Could get pretty boring.

63
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,770
Well, then, I'll definitely
go with Chief Ken!

64
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,890
OK, fine, suit yourself.

65
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,250
Oh -- students wear ties, hats
and blazers, but only on Fridays.

66
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,300
- Today's Friday.
- Yes, it is. - Oh, thanks!

67
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,050
Did you go to university, Chief Ken?

68
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,130
Yes, I did. And back in the
days when it meant something.

69
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,090
Not like these days, when
kids leave with a 30 grand debt

70
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,890
- and a degree in golf course management.
- They have golf courses?!

71
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,770
- That's amazing. - Had some of the
best days of my life at university.

72
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,810
Getting drunk with pretty girls,

73
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,290
banging on about the miners' strike
and how much I hated Thatcher.

74
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,260
- Thatcher? Who's he?
- Never mind.

75
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,170
You're so smart.

76
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,850
Which is weird, cos if Dylan drops out,

77
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,890
then none of your kids will
have gone to university.

78
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,970
Oh, God!

79
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,050
- Except for Sid, of course.
- Ah.

80
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,890
By the time he's old enough, who
knows if you'll even be alive?

81
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,210
Yeah, all right. Can you
take those clothes off now?

82
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,930
You look like Jimmy Krankie.

83
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,920
- Is that bad?
- Yes.

84
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,720
- Worse than Thatcher?
- Er...

85
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,660
No.

86
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,770
Oh!

87
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,010
Oh, come on, you bastard. Oh! Come on!

88
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,370
- Guten Morgen, meine Rachel!
- Ben! I was just heading out.

89
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,330
I was just dropping
this round for your dad.

90
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,130
- I have had a letter published in
the Solicitors Journal. - Well done.

91
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,450
Well, it's nothing really,

92
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,610
just a few lines about
a minor factual error.

93
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,450
Page 17, if you're interested.
I've marked it with a yellow tab

94
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,090
- and, er, circled it in red.
- Oh, great, thanks.

95
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,370
You don't know anything
about pushchairs, do you?

96
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,410
- This one's jammed.
- Well, let me have a look.

97
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,450
Ah, the Dual Cotterill. Good unit.

98
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,970
I used to browse round Mothercare

99
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,690
back when I thought you and I might...

100
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,850
Never mind. There is a safety catch here.

101
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,450
And then it just... clicks out.

102
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,370
Oh, brilliant!

103
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,930
Now I've just got to push him round
Tesco's and get loads of stuff.

104
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,890
Mum's gone away, Dad and
Dale are off to see Dylan

105
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,810
and I'm left on my own.

106
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,730
Er, incredible idea alert.

107
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,730
Why don't you stay here
and I go do the shopping?

108
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,250
- Oh, bit of a hassle.
- Not for Bestie Ben!

109
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,450
I'll get everything you need

110
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,410
and maybe pick us up
something nice for dinner.

111
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,410
- Oh, Ben, you're amazing.
- Yes, I am.

112
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,960
- OK. Bye-bye, Sid! - "Bye-bye,
Ben!" - See you later.

113
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,580
Oh, that was nice of Uncle
Ben, wasn't it? Come on, Sid.

114
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,930
- OK. When we find Dylan, let me
do the talking, all right? - Why?

115
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,090
I'm super persuasive.

116
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,010
Yes. We're not going to kidnap him
or cut his thumbs off, are we, Dale?

117
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,530
As much as he probably deserves it.

118
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,450
OK. Maybe just slap him a little.

119
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,540
No! We're going to be
firm but fair, all right?

120
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,820
Oh...

121
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,770
Please can you move your car?

122
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,060
- Sorry, what? - I said, can you
move your car? - Can I move my car?

123
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,650
- Well, there's plenty of spaces.
- That space is for electric vehicles.

124
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,610
- Sorry, it's for what?
- Electric vehicles!

125
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,370
Electric vehicles?

126
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,690
It's not very clearly marked.

127
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,210
Maybe I'll leave my car where it is.

128
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,650
Well, maybe I'll call the clamping firm.

129
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,010
- Is this a university or a prison?
- Thatcher! - Well said, Dale.

130
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,360
- Jimmy Krankie!
- Not as relevant, but still good.

131
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,820
Fine. I'll move.

132
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,250
Dylan, I know you're in there.

133
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,770
I can hear your music!

134
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,050
Ah.

135
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,840
Sneaky AND stupid. Terrible combination.

136
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,640
Do you have a credit card?

137
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,680
I learned this lock-picking
technique when I was in jail.

138
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,140
All right.

139
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,370
- That'll work.
- Yeah.

140
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,640
- What the fuck?!
- I can never remember what THAT's for.

141
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,930
Right, young man, we need to talk.

142
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,010
Leave me alone. I know
what you're going to say,

143
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,210
but you don't understand.

144
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,260
- I hate it here.
- Should I slap him? - No!

145
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,180
Dylan...

146
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,410
University is a really important
time in a young person's life.

147
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,890
- I just don't want you to miss out.
- God, you're such a dick!

148
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,570
- Dale, slap him.
- Face or neck?

149
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,320
Fine, then, I'll get the train
home, but leave me alone!

150
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,530
Are you...? Are you crying?!

151
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,570
- Oh, is it because of the door?
- No, you twat, it's because of Zoe!

152
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,690
She dumped me and now she's
seeing this other guy.

153
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,530
- Oh. - I know it sounds lame,
but I really love the bitch.

154
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,210
Oh, God, I'm so depressed!

155
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,450
Listen, love. The thing is...

156
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,540
Hey... I got this.

157
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,100
Hey, Dilly. Look here.

158
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,050
Zoe is with another guy now.

159
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,530
And they did just get together,
so you have two understand

160
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,810
that at this moment, they're
pretty busy intercoursing often.

161
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,890
Oh, God!

162
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,010
Dale, maybe go and explore
the campus for a bit.

163
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,850
- Maybe find that golf course?
- Maybe find that golf course.

164
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,130
I'm going to find it!

165
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,890
Look, Dad, it's not just
Zoe, OK? It's everything --

166
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,450
this place, the people, the courses.

167
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,490
I've tried, Dad, I've
tried so hard, I promise.

168
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,210
But, I mean...

169
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,220
it's like you said, media studies is shit.

170
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,420
All right. But you're getting
a job and you're paying rent.

171
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,860
Deal.

172
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,530
University's such a rip-off.

173
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,580
I mean, you pay nine
grand and you get this.

174
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,850
(Nine grand. Shit!)

175
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,170
But, um, thanks for putting me first, Dad.

176
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,970
Hey. Come on, you're my son.

177
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,620
Nothing is more important than that.

178
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,940
Just out of interest, who
does look after the money here?

179
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,450
I'm so sorry about that little
misunderstanding earlier.

180
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,930
I was very tired after a long drive.

181
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,780
(Although it was rather... inconvenient.)

182
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,970
OK. I just wanted to clarify something.

183
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,370
My son, Dylan Thompson, he's
going to be dropping out.

184
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,970
(I'm sorry to hear that. We'll miss him.)

185
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,140
I'm sorry, do you mind if I move a
bit closer? I'm struggling to...

186
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,250
So it's just the small
matter of the tuition fees

187
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,650
and when they would be refunded.

188
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,660
(Oh. Let's have a look.)

189
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,170
Hm.

190
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,850
- Never.
- What?!

191
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,730
They're non-refundable.

192
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,570
He's been here for one
month and I paid £9,000, so

193
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,930
give me 8,500 and we'll call it quits.

194
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,610
Non-refundable. And non-negotiable.

195
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,000
But I've told him he can leave.

196
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,420
All right, eight grand. Final offer.

197
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,300
Thank you. You're printing me a receipt.

198
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,010
Clause 17 on the fees
contract. Zero refunds.

199
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,010
Dylan is a bright boy

200
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,010
and this university has failed
to stimulate his keen mind.

201
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,500
- According to our files, he hasn't
been to a single lecture. - What?!

202
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,300
OK...

203
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,380
I'm a lawyer.

204
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,130
And I'm going to tell
you something just once.

205
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,370
If I walk out of that door
without the tuition fees,

206
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,370
there will be... serious consequences.

207
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,220
(Mm-hm?)

208
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,520
Mm-hm...

209
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,440
OK.

210
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,010
Very well.

211
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,060
You leave me no choice.

212
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,300
7,500 grand, final offer.

213
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,850
There you are!

214
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,970
Here's dinner, and until then I
have an array of Iberian hams...

215
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:56,970
- Ooh... - .. and some dip-worthy
snacks. - Oh, Ben, this is amazing.

216
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,450
- Let me go and get you some money.
- No, no, it's on me.

217
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,450
I thought, "Hey, we're stuck indoors,

218
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,370
"might as well make the
best of it." You know --

219
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,450
two besties, some wine and a
boxset. Be like old times, eh?

220
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,610
- Did you get changed? - Yeah, I bought
a couple of things while I was out.

221
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,930
- Shirt and some shoes.
- And aftershave?

222
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,300
- Yeah. Do you like it? - It's
quite strong, isn't it? - I know!

223
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,580
Oh, I loved that.

224
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,170
- Look at Sid. He's
still bouncing. - Mm.

225
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,290
Have you been going to the gym?

226
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,930
You know -- single man,
got standards to keep up.

227
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,450
Actually, what HAS been happening
with your romantic life?

228
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,130
Because you've kept your cards
very close to your chest.

229
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,610
Oh, er, OK.

230
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,050
- Well, there's been a variety of
girls... - Mm. - .. all really smoking.

231
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,090
I'm just not sure I'm... ready to
get into a relationship, you know?

232
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,170
However much they plead.

233
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,850
Whoever you'll choose,
they'll be a very lucky girl.

234
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,490
- Think we should have that food, then.
- Hell, yeah!

235
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,850
- I'll pop it in the microwave.
- OK.

236
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,170
Oh -- Mum gave me 40
quid for the shopping.

237
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,570
- Please take it.
- No way, best-ay!

238
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,650
OK, well, I'm putting the money in
your wallet, is it in your coat?

239
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,050
- Do not go near my coat!
- Oh, what's that?

240
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,700
Don't open it.

241
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,490
Oh, the engagement ring.

242
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,300
It's, erm...

243
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,210
I keep it on me when I
see you, just in case.

244
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,140
So I mean, when you said we were
past all that old stuff, you...

245
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,330
Oh, listen. Sid's fine. Erm...

246
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,060
And thanks for getting all the
dinner and everything. It's lovely.

247
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,380
Yeah. OK.

248
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,970
Oh, the ready meal.

249
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,930
Don't forget to pierce the film
before you put it in the microwave.

250
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,340
- OK. - Can I have my ring
back, please? - Oh, yeah.

251
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,170
Erm...

252
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,010
- Oh, shit.
- What?

253
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,770
- Well, I can't see the ring.
- Well, what do you mean?

254
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,130
Oh, God, it must have fallen onto him.

255
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,370
- Oh...! OK. I think Sid might
have swallowed it. - Oh, God!

256
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,970
Oh... Ben, what do we do?

257
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,850
I don't know. I mean, I could try
and claim on the contents insurance

258
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,370
- but there'd be a hell of
an excess to pay. - What?!

259
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,330
- Oh, God, and now I have a nosebleed. Argh!
- Come on, Siddie...

260
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,060
Oh, God.

261
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,650
OK. Slight change of plan.

262
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,610
Instead of leaving university,
you are in fact now staying.

263
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,010
What?! Why?

264
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,530
Look, Dylan. I...

265
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,090
I just hate for you to throw
away a perfectly good career

266
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,450
- in media studies.
- You didn't get your money back, did you?

267
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,610
Look, I don't want to get all
draconian about it, right,

268
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,570
but I pay nine grand for you to be here,

269
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,050
so I essentially own you
for at least one year.

270
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,890
- Well, that's slavery.
- Yes. Well, maybe slavery isn't that bad.

271
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,410
Think of all the music it gave us.

272
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,730
Come on, Dylan. Give this
place another chance.

273
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,490
Only came to uni to have a
laugh. It's just so lame here.

274
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,050
It's full of sad twats and
international students.

275
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,860
All they have is a library, a shit
bar and... and a pond full of geese.

276
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,610
- They're ducks, mate.
- Oh, God, you're always criticising me.

277
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,530
Look, Dylan! University's amazing.

278
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,050
Think of all the parties,
and the protest marches...

279
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,890
Yeah, OK, forget the protest marches.

280
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,010
- There'll be someone here for you
to have a laugh with. - Hey, guys!

281
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,010
Want to come and play Frisbee
with us? Heads up, Nathan!

282
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,490
Oh! You OK?

283
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,610
Look, Dad, I'm telling you,
this is the lamest place ever.

284
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,450
Don't be a quitter.

285
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,610
Hey. Let's go and have a pint
in the student union bar.

286
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,130
That's where all the laughs start.

287
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,930
See? This place isn't too bad.

288
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,530
I'm sure it'll pick up later.

289
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,380
No, it won't. This is as good as it gets.

290
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,490
Where's the band posters?

291
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,410
Where's the guy selling
the Socialist Worker?

292
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,570
Where's the 10p-a-pint signs?

293
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,970
Last week they actually had a
talk about alcohol awareness.

294
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,660
Unbelievable!

295
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,860
Is that kid doing an essay?

296
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,770
- There's not even any
graffiti in the bogs. - What?

297
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,930
- There's got to be an anarchy sign
or a badly drawn cock and balls? - No.

298
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,530
Well, this place is a disgrace.

299
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,210
Woo-hoo!

300
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,930
I love university! I've
made so many friends.

301
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,450
- See?
- Guys, this is Charlie.

302
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,090
Nathan and I were playing
Frisbee and Charlie joined in...

303
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,050
- uh, what's that word again?
- Ironically.

304
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,050
.. Ironically. So we played
ironic Frisbee together.

305
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,010
Right! Good. Would you sit
down, Charlie, join us?

306
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,410
No-one really drinks in here.

307
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,810
No-one that I know anyway. I'm
going to a party at Ottley House.

308
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,410
- Oh, where's that?
- You haven't heard of Ottley House?

309
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,970
Oh, no. No, yeah. I've
heard of it, obviously.

310
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,690
I was, um... I was being ironic.

311
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,690
She loves that!

312
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,490
Well, the party's going to be
pretty messed up, you should come.

313
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Bring your grandad too.

314
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,930
Did you eat something naughty?

315
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,930
Did your bad, bad sister
feed you something naughty?

316
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,050
- I didn't strictly feed it to him.
- Of course not!

317
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,050
But in future you should know
feeding babies metal jewellery

318
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,850
is considered bad parenting.

319
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,210
- Yeah. I knew.
- "Knew".

320
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,210
Well, not to worry. He'll
poo it out in a few hours.

321
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,690
- You'll soon have your
engagement ring back. - Great!

322
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,450
- But it's not actually my engagement ring.
- Well, it sort of is.

323
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,170
- We were engaged and... it was the ring.
- We weren't, I said no.

324
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,490
Well, you said yes first. Ten
seconds, it still counts.

325
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,370
OK!

326
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,730
Well -- as this isn't a medical
issue, I have no comment.

327
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,250
- Unless... How old are you?
- 24.

328
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,610
Because statistically, if you
haven't met your husband by 25

329
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,210
you won't marry till 29,
and childbirth after 30

330
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,490
puts a massive strain on the NHS.

331
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,050
So if I DID have to
advise you medically...

332
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,040
Have a think about it.

333
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,810
"Should your sister have
said yes? Should she?

334
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,900
"He looks nice enough. Handsome.

335
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,410
"Should she be more realistic?"

336
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,860
- OK...
- "I think she should."

337
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,810
- Hey. - Hey! Have you guys got
any booze? We're running low.

338
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,130
In luck! Old guy does.

339
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,770
Now, this is more like it.

340
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,020
Hey, guys. We've got booze!

341
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,460
I got Frisbee!

342
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:33,610
- That's what a credit card's for.
- I'm learning so much at university!

343
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,610
We're going to leave you to it.

344
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,330
Yeah, nice one.

345
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,530
Hey, Dad.

346
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,650
I thought you were going to
be a right dick about today,

347
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,370
but you were only half as much
of a dick as I thought you'd be.

348
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,500
- Thank you, Dylan.
- Stay for a beer if you like.

349
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,500
No. You don't want me hanging
around cramping your style.

350
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,770
Again!

351
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,140
OK, Siddie, let's have
a little look at you.

352
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,370
No. Still no joy.

353
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,610
All right, then. All right.

354
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,300
Oh... Let's warm you up some milk.

355
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,690
You OK?

356
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,700
Yeah.

357
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,810
Ben, I worry, being friends with me

358
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,370
maybe... it's not the best
thing for you at the moment.

359
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,540
- No, no, it IS the best thing.
- Will you be honest for a sec?

360
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,650
It's just so ridiculous.

361
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,290
Dale's in love with this... Ling
woman, you're in love with Dale

362
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,020
and I'm in...

363
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,850
Oh, God.

364
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,500
You're right.

365
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,690
Maybe we should all... have
a fresh start and move on.

366
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,730
The trouble with moving on is... you
don't know what's round the corner.

367
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,780
There could be a hairpin bend. Or a
new boyfriend who REALLY hurts you.

368
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,330
Sometimes, when you're moving on,
you've got to go into reverse

369
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,850
and back up a little.

370
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,490
And as you're backing up,

371
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:46,370
you might be worried you're
going over old ground, but

372
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,530
actually it's the best thing
you could possibly do.

373
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,650
Because the old ground

374
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,840
is safe... and reliable...

375
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,570
.. thinks you're beautiful.

376
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,370
Ben...

377
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,220
The old ground will never...
hurt you or leave you.

378
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,850
It'll just be glad that
you're, you know...

379
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,380
driving over it again.

380
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,570
- Ooh, gosh, can you smell that?
- Yeah, I think I can.

381
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,330
Ooh!

382
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,050
- I think we have success, baby Sid.
- Yeah! - Oh...! - A bit too much.

383
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,090
- Eurgh.
- Eurgh.

384
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,610
- Maggie, Maggie, Maggie!
- Out, out, out!

385

- Your dad is wicked.
- Mm-hm.

390
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,650
Folks, seriously... I've got
another one for you guys,

391
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,970
see if you can join along.

392
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,050
This is a little number...

393
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,130
by a Mr Billy Bragg.

394
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,650

- you must all leave immediately.
- Oh, come on,

412
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,730
- they're just trying to have a bit of fun.
- The party's over.

413
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,050
Everyone, please leave.

414
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,810
You square.

415
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,970
- Thatcher!
- Yes, Dale.

416
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,090
Aren't you... a bit old
for this kind of thing?

417
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,890
I am not going to take a
lecture... from the likes of you.

418
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,850
(Bollocks.)

419
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,640
Well, I can see where he gets THAT from.

420
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,900
Guys...? Guys, wait!

421
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,170
I can see you all want to go,

422
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,850
and you think the party's over...

423
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,050
but before you do I want
to say a couple things.

424
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,300
OK?

425
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,490
All it takes for evil to flourish is
for a few good men to say nothing.

426
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,770
We have to show that supercilious bell-end

427
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,650
that we will NOT be
pushed around by the Man.

428
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,930
All right?

429
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,490
We must fight... the
might... of the system!

430
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,370
WHO'S WITH HIM?!

431
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,090
WHO'S WITH ME?!

432
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,410
OK.

433
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,010
I'll be honest...

434
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,860
I'm a little disappointed by the turnout.

435
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,690
OK, Dad, what's the plan?

436
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,530
The plan... is we're going
to teach that smug little twat

437
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,650
a lesson he won't forget.

438
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,930
- The old classic. We're going to turn
his car on its roof. - No, Dad, stop.

439
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:06,170
- Dylan...! - What if we pick it
up, and... move it over there?

440
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,960
Onto the island.

441
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,450
You are a chip off the
old block! OK, boys,

442
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,370
let's put this prick's car on the island!

443
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,210
Wait, Chief Ken... This is
all allowed at university?

444
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,370
It's totally fine.

445
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,730
Dad, come on!

446
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,570
OK, boys. Three, two, one.

447
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,500
Heave!

448
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,180
- Oh, he's going to shit when
he sees this! - Hi, Mr Duck!

449
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,220
We can do this, guys, come on...

450
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,170
Onto the island she goes!

451
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,570
Yes!

452
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:48,220
OK, boys. One last
heave. One, two, three...

453
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,170
Yes, Dad! I am DEFINTELY
staying at university!

454
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,160
So proud of you, son.

455
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,380
Oh, no! Oh...!

456
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,900
Final offer -- five grand.

457
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,210
I can't believe they kicked me
out. Why did you make me do that?

458
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,890
You're an adult now, Dylan,

459
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,490
and as an adult, we take
responsibility for our own actions.

460
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,570
That said -- don't tell your mother.

461
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,330
I can still smell burning duck.

462
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,890
Yeah. It'll take me a while
till I have a Chinese.

463
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,730
Still, university was great, wasn't it?

464
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,650
Can we go back EVERY weekend?

465
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,650
- You are such a fucktard.
- Dylan. That's enough.

466
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,490
No, it's OK, Chief Ken.
He was just being ironic.

467
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,370
Like me saying, "It's NOT going to
be great to have you home again, bro!"

468
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,570
Oh, yeah -- I'm not getting a job,
by the way. I'm going travelling.

469
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,570
Oh, yeah? And who's going
to be paying for that?

470
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,730
Well -- you are, or I'll tell Mum.

471
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,290
- Dale?
- On it.

472
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,860
Ow!

473
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,220
