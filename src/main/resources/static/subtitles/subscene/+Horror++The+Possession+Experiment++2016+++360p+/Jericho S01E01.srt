1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,830
Did you buy them an' all?
Go get 'em, will you?

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,280
They're in that back room.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,750
- Let's be done with this.
- All right.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Get a move on here!

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,440
- Why's this down here?
- How much did you say was for the book down here?

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,830
- Fetch us an extra one for a cart sale.
- Are they from upstairs?

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,670
Just a couple of chairs.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,720
I think so, aye.

9
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,940
- I've got it.
- There's nowhere else to put it.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,550
Excuse me, would ya?

11
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,590
There's a poorhouse in Settle.
They'll take your children.

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,310
I'm not being parted from them.

13
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,860
I think you'd better talk to him.

14
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,350
This house isn't ours, not anymore.

15
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
It's just a house.

16
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,440
We'll be together.

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,550
I can't stand everyone
knowing, that's all.

18
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,280
We're going to walk out of
here with our heads held high.

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Come on.

20
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,310
Worth a shilling, maybe.

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Come on.

22
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,500
Sold everything to pay his debts.

23
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,440
You said we could come to you.

24
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,750
I'm sorry, Annie,

25
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,560
I've been sick of late.

26
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,030
That's fine.

27
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
Forget I came here.

28
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Ma'am...

29
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,230
.. what's going on?

30
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
Annie?

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,150
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,670
We need somewhere we can go,

33
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,910
somewhere I can at least earn a
wage. It'll get dark in a few hours.

34
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,270
- (We can't sleep out on the streets.)
- There's jobs going, Culverdale railway.

35
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,710
They're building a great bridge out there.

36
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,520
- That's 15 miles.
- I'll find a train that'll take you.

37
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,310
Where are we headed?

38
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
An adventure.

39
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,920
- Why have we stopped?
- You have to change trains.

40
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,760
It's the end of the line. There's
a different railway yonder.

41
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,520
All change! This is the end of the line.

42
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,270
Connecting train across the valley.

43
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
All change, please!

44
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,560
Here.

45
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,820
- Take my hand.
- Thank you.

46
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,720
- Here. The steps... Ooh!
- Thank you.

47
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,360
- We're headed for Culverdale.
- It's this valley right here.

48
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,110
Here, let me help you, lad.

49
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,550
There we are.

50
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,350
- No, there's no need to carry our things.
- It's no bother, ma'am.

51
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,120
Happen if you don't want to talk to
me I can walk a little way in front.

52
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,880
- Step down here.
- Steady.

53
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,030
I suppose this is where we
part. I'm walking further west.

54
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,430
You should head over that ridge.

55
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,040
- Good luck to you and your family.
- Thank you for your help.

56
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,940
Happen I'll come to call
when you get settled.

57
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,100
I look forward to all
the lively conversation.

58
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,950
It's the ends of the earth.

59
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,800
See you later.

60
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,710
Go left a bit. No, no, no,
come back to the right.

61
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,630
That's it, that's great.
That's great. Look at that.

62
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,150
Oh, it should be an
"S". There's two of us.

63
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,320
- Capsticks.
- It's beer they want, woman, not a grammar lesson.

64
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,030
Ned Shaw, I'm the engineer.

65
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,870
You all work for me now.

66
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,030
I pay a fair wage for a fair day's work.

67
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,030
Put your mark in the book,
you'll be assigned a work gang.

68
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,030
Your bunting's in the dirt, my fine lady.

69
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,030
How about a smile?

70
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,750
Everything's barter here. A
smile for my arm, a fair trade.

71
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,590
- Can you tell me where there's work to be had?
- Boss's office over yonder.

72
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,830
- How about a kiss instead, then?
- How about I smack you with this suitcase?

73
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,840
Shaw & Blackwood pay
me to look after t'men.

74
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,230
Make sure they're fed,
they've got a roof over them.

75
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,470
They're mostly villains,

76
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,710
rough ends.

77
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,960
You don't belong here.

78
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
Nowhere else to go?

79
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,430
What are you going to do to earn
a living out here on t'moors?

80
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,550
I don't yet know.

81
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,200
I just need a place of my own.

82
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,910
Are those for rent, those huts?

83
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,350
I need somewhere to sleep tonight.

84
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,000
Forty shillings a week,
it beds enough for six.

85
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,230
Is there anywhere cheaper, perhaps?

86
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,670
You could take in lodgers,
no shortage of men here.

87
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,760
I'll give you two days' grace
on rent to set yourself up.

88
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,110
Who are you, then?

89
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,760
Ralph Coates, the new foreman.

90
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,360
Hired to work the next mile of the
branch line, east of the valley.

91
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,280
I learnt my trade on the
Baltimore-Ohio Railway.

92
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,910
Joseph Thornhill.

93
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,910
This here minor track's
mine. I'm the agent.

94
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,230
Senior foreman here on the viaduct build.

95
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,990
Nice berth you've got. Can you
tell me where I can bunk down?

96
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,240
The flophouse is cheapest, across the way.

97
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
If you're staying, you'd
better go with this gentleman.

98
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,830
There's a vacant hut round
the back of the flophouse.

99
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,440
All right?

100
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Good day.

101
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,840
How long since he died?

102
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Your husband?

103
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Who told you that?

104
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,470
I'm a railway foreman, ma'am.

105
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,120
Two things I make my business.

106
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,940
The railways... and the
folks that work 'em.

107
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,600
Excuse me asking, where's the line?

108
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,590
- Have you just arrived in town?
- I rode in on the goods train.

109
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,520
I'm Johnny Jackson.

110
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,310
I'm looking for work.

111
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,070
Look for the office that says
Shaw & Blackwood. Ask there.

112
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,990
- I'm obliged to you.
- Aye, manners.

113
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,180
Never heard the like.

114
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,040
There's a space on my gang, Your Highness.

115
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,390
George, have you got ink and paper?

116
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
We need to make more than just the rent.

117
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,780
We need to buy our way back home again.

118
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,700
- Come on, George.
- Mornin'.

119
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,580
I bought you some rations.

120
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,400
- I can't possibly take your food.
- I can.

121
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,050
George?

122
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,440
Every mouthful a banquet.

123
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,690
There's really no need, sir.
We're just on our way to market.

124
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,300
Ma'am, you can't survive without
a favour every now and then.

125
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,450
Maybe someday you can pay me back again.

126
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Thank you.

127
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,690
I did my best with what I could find.

128
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,340
I married you for your
kissing, not your sandwiches.

129
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,890
I have a theory about navvy boys.
Born fighters. In their nature.

130
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,650
But if you're on my gang, the
only thing you'll be fighting

131
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,490
- is that bedrock. Do you hear me, navvy?
- Aye.

132
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,690
- Tiger?
- Aye, Jack.

133
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,330
- Davie Boy?
- Aye, Jack.

134
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,810
- Walker?
- Aye, Jack.

135
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,890
- Shay?
- Aye, Jack. - Red? - Aye, Jack.

136
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,930
- Skinny?
- Aye, Jack. - And what do I call you?

137
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,780
His Royal Highness The Prince.

138
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,640
All right, let's get
some work done. Come on.

139
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,420
The London line ends there, and
then the Midland line begins.

140
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,490
Two networks, two locomotives.

141
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,690
And just your estate
between them, eh, Blackwood?

142
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,620
And that spells opportunity. Yes, sir.

143
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,370
A viaduct linking the networks,
making this country one nation.

144
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,460
And you need money to finish it,
hence this rather fine luncheon.

145
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,250
What would your father have thought

146
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,890
about all these... squatters on his land?

147
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,060
He traded in sugar. Sugar's the past,

148
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,850
railways are our future.

149
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,610
Ah, see, here's Mr Shaw, the engineer.

150
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,450
- We set up this venture together.
- So, how are you faring?

151
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,090
It's going to take some persuasion
before they open their wallets.

152
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,860
- Gentlemen. - Mr Shaw. - Mr
Shaw. - How are you doing?

153
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,460
- Away!
- Clear!

154
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,610
Drag it back now and stow it tight.

155
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,570
Take that with powder tomorrow.

156
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,620
It saves the digging of a hundred men.

157
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,850
Aye.

158
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,000
Who let that thing off its pegs?!

159
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,290
- That new man, he were careless.
- It wasn't me.

160
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:15,780
- I saw you.
- You couldn't see nothing with so much drink inside you.

161
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,090
Whoa, whoa!

162
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,250
- The Prince is a boxer as well, look.
- Red, you lose a day's clink.

163
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,370
Now move yourselves!

164
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,980
Right.

165
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,890
Someone's been in that bag and
they've taken half my things.

166
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,930
Must've happened when we
left the bags outside.

167
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,410
- I hate this place. Why have we come here?
- Hey, don't say that.

168
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,090
At least we've got a roof
... and we're together.

169
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,370
So we've really gotta stay in this crate,

170
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,520
side by side with a bunch of strangers?

171
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,330
Look, this here's the parlour.

172
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,250
The kitchen and the scullery
are over in the west wing.

173
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,290
- What about the billiard room?
- Of course.

174
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,050
Every respectable family
needs to entertain.

175
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,330
Over here we can have the music room.

176
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,410
A grand piano for when we
have recitals in the evening.

177
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,210
Oh, out there is the kitchen/garden,
with formal lawns leading down

178
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,290
to a tennis court. Is that
grand enough for you, Duchess?

179
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,300
You're mad sometimes.

180
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,600
Wherever you two lay your heads,

181
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,400
that's my dream home.

182
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,610
And if it all goes to plan,
I think we can promise you

183
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,860
a very healthy return on your investments.

184
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,410
Oh, I have absolute confidence.

185
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,620
Gentlemen.

186
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,850
- So sorry to keep you.
- My niece, Miss Lambton.

187
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,650
Let me introduce you.
Mr Shaw, the engineer.

188
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,930
Ma'am.

189
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,780
And you know his partner,
of course, Mr Blackwood.

190
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
Hello, Charles.

191
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,650
Please, gentlemen, don't
let me disturb you.

192
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,300
Another chair, please, Easter.

193
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,410
I'm glad you can join us, Miss Lambton.

194
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,530
I'm very glad to be here.

195
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,020
She asked if she could come.
Sorry, I should've warned you.

196
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,290
- Charles or myself will be more than happy to answer that.
- It's an extraordinary venture.

197
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,660
Come here!

198
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,330
Look at all them fine things she owns.

199
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,280
- Don't gawp.
- All my good clothes were taken, Ma.

200
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,820
Oi. Don't forget them boots, will ya?

201
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,730
Cheers, Polly. See you next payday.

202
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,820
- I like your lace.
- Thank you.

203
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,330
It's pretty, in't it?

204
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,330
Hey, go on.

205
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,530
Have you just moved in?
Lace Polly they call me.

206
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,650
Annie.

207
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,620
I'd... best get on.

208
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,690
So where are you from, Skinny?

209
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,250
I live down Plymouth way.

210
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,300
Daughter, too. Three years in September.

211
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,250
How can you stand to be away?

212
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,330
I just go when the work whistles.

213
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,890
Send back all the spare money I have.

214
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,900
Better than a shipyard, this.
No-one to tell you how to live.

215
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,460
What about you, then? You don't
talk about yourself much, do you?

216
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,340
Aargh!

217
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,890
- Argh!
- You men!

218
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,250
Argh! Argh!

219
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,570
Get your pack. I don't want to
see you this side of the mountain.

220
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,940
You're a dead man,
Prince, I swear you are!

221
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,410
We need to find new lodgings

222
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,740
- before we wake up with our throats cut.
- Yeah.

223
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,530
Your sign says lodgings.

224
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,450
It's 14 shillings a week.

225
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,450
You get three meals,

226
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,970
a mattress and your laundry.

227
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,700
Start on about kissing me again,
I will kick you out of doors.

228
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,370
We've already had the pleasure.

229
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,250
I said I'd come to call
when you got settled.

230
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,490
So...

231
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
.. here I am.

232
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,390
What are you doing, boy?

233
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,640
Just getting firewood.

234
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
You ain't seen me.

235
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,280
Do you hear?

236
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
Oh.

237
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,800
- Which part of the track are you working on, then?
- Your side.

238
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,380
Not as grand as here.

239
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,550
Do you get a cut of
what those traders earn?

240
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,310
- Aye, I do.
- Reckon I'm just gonna have to steal your pass then.

241
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,830
- Morning.
- Good morning.

242
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,840
- Here.
- Thanks.

243
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,270
Well, this is a banquet.

244
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,520
- A man works harder on hot vittles than he does on cold.
- Mmm.

245
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,020
Right.

246
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,160
Skinny?

247
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,150
Now you're staying here as my
guests, these are my house rules.

248
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,230
The room at the end is
for family, this parlour

249
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,320
- is the only place we meet.
- What do we get in exchange for all these rules?

250
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,160
We're the only lodgings with fine china.

251
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,580
You get to live a cut above the others.

252
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,220
- All right.
- A knife and fork there.

253
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,080
Alma, stop your dreaming,
get out here, help serve.

254
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,350
I've only just got up.

255
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,350
A navvy drinks beer any time of
t'day. If we want to make a living,

256
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,590
it means we're open.

257
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,480
Alma.

258
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,440
- Good morning to ya.
- Morning.

259
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,240
What's the matter? Can't bear
to share the water with me?

260
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I've a daughter.

261
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,190
She's...

262
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,950
I understand.

263
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,120
Don't worry, I won't bother
you for the time of day.

264
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,790
Now you and me, our
linen's the same colour.

265
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,200
The only friends you'll have
around here are the ones you make.

266
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,270
He's telling everyone, boasting about it.

267
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,030
- I never kissed Jackie Blackburn.
- He says you're sweet on him, he brung you presents.

268
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,630
I can't help who dreams about me, can I?

269
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,270
- Why are you following me, Davey?
- I want to talk.

270
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,310
- I mean here, this navvy town.
- You...

271
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,630
You kissed me up in Scarborough.

272
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,310
You don't run halfway around the
world cos someone kisses you.

273
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,230
What's that under your skirt?

274
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,110
Well, Davey, if you don't
know, my kiss were wasted.

275
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,640
No, I mean that lace. Well,
that's what he brung ya?

276
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,600
He saved up half his wages.

277
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,120
- Who are you staring at?
- That petticoat is mine.

278
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,040
- Whoever gave it you, they stole it.
- Alma, give it back.

279
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,030
You lay a finger on me and
I will smack you so hard

280
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,280
your teeth with rattle.

281
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,520
Agh!

282
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,120
You fool, you little fool!

283
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,840
There. Now neither of us can have it.

284
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
Uh!

285
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,920
He didn't save up no wages,
your new admirer. He filched it.

286
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,550
I'm afraid they're about to start blasting.
It's not safe to go into the valley today.

287
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,190
- Oh, are we to be prisoners, then?
- You're free to wander my grounds.

288
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,150
- There's good shooting on the moors.
- Perhaps Blackwood can entertain your niece whilst we're gone?

289
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,400
It would be an honour.

290
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,430
Davey boy, get the agent
to give you powder.

291
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,150
Take the new man with you,
show him how it's done.

292
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,400
We need 20 ounces of the black
stuff to shift this bedrock.

293
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,720
I said I'd escort you.

294
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,950
Your uncle's gone off for a few hours.

295
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The prospect delights you, obviously.

296
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,640
You don't need to nursemaid me, Charles.

297
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,630
I wanted to see you. I heard
about your grand scheme.

298
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,270
You didn't think it might be awkward?

299
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,320
I'm sorry.

300
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,230
I thought... things might mend.

301
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,840
It's been eight years.

302
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,510
Perhaps I was wrong.

303
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,380
Perhaps we won't ever be friends.

304
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,910
All men back behind the crow line.
Clear the pit while I plug the fuse.

305
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,750
.. my fine daughter

306
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,030
Step it up, Mary, if you can

307
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,390
Step it up, Mary, my fine daughter

308
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,470
Show your legs to the countryman...

309
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,390
Show your legs to the countryman

310
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Show your legs to the countryman...

311
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,790
There's some powder missing.

312
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,240
A barrel's gone.

313
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,670
Step it up, Mary, my fine daughter

314
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,190
Step it up, Mary, if you can

315
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,200
Step it up, Mary...

316
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,800
Oh, God...

317
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,430
Oh, sweet Jesus, no.

318
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Someone help me!

319
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,150
Help! Get me out of here!
There's gunpowder everywhere!

320
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,680
Please, get me out!

321
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,830
- It's everywhere!
- Jack!

322
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,550
Argh! Aargh! Aargh!

323
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,230
Help them, lads, they're over there.

324
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,390
- Argh! Argh!
- Get down!

325
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,510
- Get down!
- Argh!

326
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Here we are.

327
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,800
He was up at the scaffold when
it happened. Open the door.

328
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,990
We need to bind these
wounds with something.

329
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,320
Here we are, gently. There
we are, there you are.

330
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,870
- I'll be back.
- Where are you going?

331
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,990
There may be others.

332
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,470
I don't know how to tend to it.

333
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,140
Martha, go and find a doctor.

334
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,840
Martha, go and find
someone who can help us!

335
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,600
Has anybody seen my husband?

336
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,780
Anybody seen Jack Laggan?

337
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Davey?

338
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,600
Davey...

339
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,320
I'm sorry. He... wouldn't
have known nothing.

340
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,990
No!

341
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,550
No! Davey...

342
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,430
Jack! Jack...

343
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,840
Jack. Jack!

344
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,120
JAAACK!

345
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,110
- I sent for a doctor.
- There isn't one to be had.

346
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
I'll need a spoon.

347
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,030
Have you got flour and
salt to make a poultice?

348
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,080
Go, quickly.

349
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,950
There, there.

350
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,920
Have you seen my lad anywhere?

351
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Sit down there.

352
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
Oi!

353
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,560
Hey!

354
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Talk to him, lass.

355
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,700
Say something to make him smile.

356
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,550
You're going to get better.

357
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,240
We're looking out for you.

358
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,710
Mr Blackwood? Sir? Sir?

359
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,030
There's a navvy lad in that
hut, burnt bad in the explosion.

360
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,480
- We need to get him to a
hospital. - Show me. - This way.

361
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,440
Get him up. Pull him down.

362
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,310
- Let me give you something for what you've done for him.
- No, I can't accept nowt, sir.

363
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,300
No, not just for Christian kindness.

364
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,350
Drive on.

365
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,790
I wanted to see Mr Thornhill.

366
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,270
Crawled into a bottle.
He'll be leaving here.

367
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,420
Someone has to answer for this tragedy.

368
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,040
- Remind me, what's your experience?
- Oh.

369
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,390
Thirty years on the railway, sir,

370
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,240
across the northern United States.

371
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,030
I want you to take over in the valley.

372
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,830
Jack Laggan, the ganger who was killed,

373
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,870
- you need to find a man to replace him. Who's his second?
- A young man named Sharpe. Davey Sharpe.

374
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,710
Find him, will you,
Coates, and promote him.

375
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,260
- You're in charge now.
- Why, thank you, sir.

376
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,920
We need more blankets for the wounded.

377
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,160
I'll take them over with the
water as soon as it's boiled.

378
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
What are you doing?

379
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,660
Someone ought to write,
he has a wife and child.

380
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,070
Well, won't Mrs Shaw or...

381
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,320
Mr Blackwood see to it?

382
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,940
I don't think those men
care about any of us.

383
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,280
I should go back to the
site and find his pack.

384
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,200
If the worst happens we
have to send her his wages.

385
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
Davey Sharpe?

386
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,190
Mr Shaw's looking for a new ganger.

387
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,440
I told you're his man.

388
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,390
It wouldn't be right, sir,

389
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,180
with Jack not even in the earth.

390
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Someone's gotta keep this ship afloat.

391
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,440
Would you rather I gave it to another man?

392
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,560
Well?

393
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,870
I'm in debt to you, sir.

394
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Agh!

395
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,260
- Come 'ere!
- Argh!

396
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,030
Argh!

397
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,910
You saw me take powder out of
yonder blast cart, didn't you?

398
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,760
And you know what powder
does, don't you, boy? Hmm?!

399
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,630
Shh, shh, shh.

400
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Argh!

401
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,120
Come on, come here!

402
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,550
Right!

403
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,350
Argh!

404
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,720
Red was thrown off the gang.
He was trying to pay us back.

405
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,830
George saw him do it,

406
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,880
steal the powder.

407
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,880
- Well, we have to tell the agent.
- Annie, no.

408
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,360
George, wait out the front. Go.

409
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,720
Go on.

410
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,790
Thornhill's a decent man.

411
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,910
- He's been booted out, and there's no law here.
- George was defending himself. - We can't prove it.

412
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,350
George killed a man,

413
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,310
that's all they'll see.

414
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,500
They'll come for him.

415
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,440
God help him if the navvies
take t'law into their own hands.

416
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,030
I don't know what to do.

417
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,780
We have to bury the body.

418
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,510
What?

419
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,150
- No-one will know. Red was ordered to leave here.
- That's insane.

420
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,070
They'll think he just skipped town.

421
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,200
It's the only way.

422
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,960
Why are you helping us?

423
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,990
Because I can.

424
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,110
Because I'm... here.

425
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,400
And you're alone.

426
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,270
Bring a blanket to wrap him in,

427
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,520
and we'll take him up onto the moors.

428
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,440
- (What's he doing?)
- (I don't know.)

429
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,850
Where are we putting him?

430
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,770
They've already dug a grave for
Jack. We'll bury him underneath.

431
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,290
No-one will dig there, ever.

432
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,980
Here.

433
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,260
Turn him over.

434
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,560
What's he doing with all this money?

435
00:48:56,660 --> 00:49:00,300
- That's more than just his wages.
- I reckon someone paid him to do it.

436
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,330
We should bury it with him.

437
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,260
Jack's job?

438
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,370
Ganger's job?

439
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,170
Aye.

440
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,220
The agent come and told me right away.

441
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,490
So,

442
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,690
what do you say?

443
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,340
I say it's high time you
asked me to marry you.

444
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,010
What?

445
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,730
- Do you mean it?
- Yeah, of course I mean it.

446
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,780
I've always been sweet on you, Davey.

447
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:47,810
W...

448
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,250
I don't want you saying this
just cos I get more wages.

449
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,130
Kiss me.

450
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,520
Make it a proper bargain.

451
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,730
Mr Blackwood has sent me.

452
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,820
The man that got burned
up in that there fire?

453
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,420
You mean Skinny.

454
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,540
He died before we got him to t'doctor.

455
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,500
Mr Charles?

456
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,780
A man died tonight.

457
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,010
Died on the cart,

458
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,200
right in front of me.

459
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,730
The investors, I need
to speak to them myself,

460
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,450
- to reassure them.
- Charlie,

461
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,930
they took a carriage back to town.

462
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,080
They didn't wanna spend the night here.

463
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,860
All right, now.

464
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,690
Here we are.

465
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,880
'And the Lord said to Joshua,

466
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:52,130
"See, I have given thee rich land

467
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:55,900
called Jericho into your hands,

468
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,890
with its great king

469
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,740
and its mighty men of valour

470
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:07,220
who toil there each day."'

471
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,170
I've been thinking today

472
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:23,250
Of that beautiful land

473
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:29,540
I shall meet when the sun goes down

474
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,610
At the glorious gates

475
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,330
With my governor I stand

476
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:44,090
Will there be any stars in my crown?

477
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:50,970
Will there be any stars,
any stars in my crown?

478
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:57,090
When at evening the sun goeth down

479
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:02,530
When I wake with the blessed

480
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:06,900
In the mansions of rest

481
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,370
Listen here, all of you!

482
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:31,620
Looks like it was
sabotage killed these men.

483
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,370
The name's Bamford.

484
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,420
I'm a detective.

485
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,120
Mr Blackwood's hired me to investigate.

486
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,820
Anyone knows anything,
you come and tell me.

487
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,490
Tell me what happened with Shaw.

488
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:18,480
I've just seen him leaving, Charles.

489
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,660
I don't see it's any of your business.

490
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,980
My uncle withdrew all his capital.

491
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:31,490
The scheme has made him near bankrupt.

492
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,240
Shaw rode over here to
tell you that the viaduct

493
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,100
is finished.

494
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:43,120
Why did you come back here today?

495
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:45,450
To tell you that my uncle is a fool.

496
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,290
This viaduct could make you all a fortune.

497
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,540
It's all academic. I've no more to invest.

498
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,810
But I do.

499
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:57,060
I have an inheritance...
and I want to put it to use.

500
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:03,690
- You... are not serious?
- I'm offering you a way out of this.

501
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,090
- After everything that's happened between us?
- I have money,

502
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,450
- you have a vision.
- We were going to be married.

503
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:13,330
This is different,
Charles. This is business.

504
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,380
No,

505
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,980
I'm sorry, no.

506
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:22,690
You've put every penny
you have into this scheme.

507
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:27,010
The well is dry, no-one else will
invest in you after this accident.

508
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:30,500
If you don't take my money, you're ruined.

509
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,960
And he reckons some of
the powder was missing.

510
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,180
That doesn't make much sense, sir.

511
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,450
Mr Thornhill seemed to be the kind of man

512
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,370
to keep that key on him at all times.

513
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,920
No-one could've got
into that gunpowder cart.

514
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,420
Look at that,

515
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,690
the stains on it. Someone's
made a copy of that,

516
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,740
pressed it into some wax or something.

517
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,650
They took it while he slept.

518
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,850
Any of the men missing?

519
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:30,180
Red Killeen was fired two days ago.
They say he had a score to settle.

520
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,850
He could have had a copy made of that key,

521
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,930
broke into t'cart, stole t'powder.

522
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,880
He'll be on t'road. I'll
run him to ground, I will.

523
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,900
Hey.

524
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:16,220
Gentlemen... Gentlemen!

525
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,530
I'm Ralph Coates,

526
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:23,980
and I've been hired to
replace Mr Thornhill.

527
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,570
Now I know you got questions
as to why a Negro from America

528
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:32,360
has been put in charge over here.

529
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,450
Well, let me tell you.

530
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,050
In this business, it's not about
the colour of a man's skin,

531
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,440
it's about what he knows,

532
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,290
what he's worth.

533
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,930
I've done 30 years on
the rails across America

534
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,720
and I got the papers to prove it.

535
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,050
And I promise you,

536
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,570
you do right by me,

537
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,820
I will do right by you,

538
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,980
and we'll get this job done.

539
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,170
I was a schoolmaster's wife.

540
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,210
I sang to the Lord each Sunday.

541
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,330
My husband, he died,

542
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,130
left us debts.

543
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:44,920
That's what brought me out here.

544
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,580
I hate you, Johnny Jackson,
for making me do what you did.

545
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,500
Still, I know you saved my son for me.

546
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:12,060
I reckon I owe you everything.

547
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,690
I've been waiting for you, Mrs Quaintain.

548
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:47,170
That detective's back. If George
says anything, we're finished.

549
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:50,450
There's a price to every man's
love. What's yours, son?

550
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,980
I can't watch. It's Johnny.

551
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,850
- He's been ground into t'dirt.
- I am never leaving you,

552
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,770
that promise is unbreakable.

553
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:03,130
That fella they call The Prince,
there's a secret going on there.

554
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:07,220
I thought you were leaving tonight,
I thought I'd never see you again.
