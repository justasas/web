1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,764
- We need somewhere we can go.
- This job's going.

2
00:00:02,788 --> 00:00:05,671
Culverdale way. They're building
a great bridge out there.

3
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:07,880
A viaduct,
making this country one nation.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,560
- I'm Johnny Jackson.
- Tobias Farrelly.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,600
Folks call me Skinny.

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,600
There's a space on my gang...
Your Highness

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,400
Aagh!

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,640
You're a dead man, Prince.
I swear you are!

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,976
- Someone help me!
- Jack!

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,760
Has anybody seen my husband?

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,280
Looks like it was sabotage
killed these men.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,840
Name's Bamford. I'm a detective.

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,960
Someone's made a copy of that?
Any of your men missing?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,800
Red Killeen.

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,240
- Get back!
- No!

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,880
George killed a man.
We have to bury the body.

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,800
I have an inheritance.
And I want to put it to use.

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,720
- After everything that's happened between us?
- This is business.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,400
I need you to take over in the
valley. You're the best man we have.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,880
- What can I get you, Mister?
- I'm not here for your poor man's ale.

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,840
Red Killeen!

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,080
I've reason to believe
he had a grudge in this town.

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,120
Caused the explosion.

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,200
I've ridden east to west...
Churchtown to Morwenstow...

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,160
No sign of him.

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,160
Vanished into the wind, he has.

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
Someone here knows summat.

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,800
Somebody's got a story to tell.

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,160
This here is for information.

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Half stays in my pocket
till I can check the truth of it.

31
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,280
'Appen I'll have that drink now.

32
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,320
This here's Dagger. He's er...
looking for a place to stay.

33
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,040
14 shillings a week,
three meals and a mattress.

34
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,120
How about if I pay you less
and maybe have smaller portions

35
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,720
That smile works with the ladies,
does it?

36
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
Aye. I've had some success with it.

37
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,880
Not put off by
a wedding ring neither.

38
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,400
Not married. Just impervious.

39
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,760
Dictionary up there.
Help yourself

40
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,720
Thank you.

41
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,400
I've just given this chap
the welcome speech.

42
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,920
He can give it you. And mind you
keep these curtains closed.

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,960
I've a daughter.

44
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,560
Should have enough
to pay a week's rent.

45
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,040
And have money to put by, an' all.

46
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,960
How long will it take to get home?

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,720
Oh, nose to the grindstone,
should be back in a month or two.

48
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,440
You're lying to me.

49
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,240
Martha.

50
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,600
- Where's George?
- He's busy with his books.

51
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,400
Mam? What's going on?

52
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,320
George?

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
That secret...

54
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Our secret... the one that
we agreed never to speak about.

55
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,960
- You haven't told no-one?
- What's this about?

56
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,800
- Promise me that you haven't let on!
- Johnny, stop it!

57
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,520
Why do you want to remind him?
It's better if he forgot.

58
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,360
- I haven't said nothing to no-one.
- Course you haven't.

59
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,680
We'll never... talk about that again,
any of us.

60
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,400
You're not my father.
Just leave me be.

61
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,240
That detective's back in town.

62
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,560
If George says anything,
we're finished.

63
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
He keeps remembering.

64
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,920
It doesn't help
having you under this roof.

65
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,560
- What does that mean?
- - I want you gone.

66
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,200
- Annie, you can't blame me.
- I'm not blaming you.

67
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,520
You moved heaven and earth to help us
but he needs to put this in the past.

68
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
Right.

69
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,760
Tomorrow I'd be obliged if
you found yourself new lodgings.

70
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,040
Come.

71
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,040
Hands in.

72
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,200
This is my kingdom.
You're a guest here.

73
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Don't forget it now.

74
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,600
That scaffold needs rebuilding
from the ground up.

75
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,720
It was badly damaged in the blast,
sir.

76
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,880
Lumber isn't cheap.

77
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,800
And it takes time to acquire.
We can't just have the men all sitting idle.

78
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,400
What about building from
the other side of the valley?

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,520
- Begging your pardon, sir... are you suggesting...
- Another gang.

80
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,200
Blasting from the east whilst
the west is being dismantled.

81
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
It ain't never been done.

82
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,440
Still,
don't mean it ain't worth trying.

83
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
You're a good man, Coates.

84
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,520
Tell me. Where do you hail from?

85
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,720
Vermont, sir.
North-eastern part of America.

86
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,040
Family of blacksmiths.
Led me to work on the railways.

87
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,840
Crossed the seas to get away from
that damn civil war.

88
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,880
I see. England's a haven, then.

89
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Of sorts.

90
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Sir, the erm...

91
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,800
That detective's back down in
the valley. He's unsettling the men.

92
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,600
My viaduct has been sabotaged,
Coates.

93
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,200
Whoever did this,
we can't let them get away with it.

94
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Mr Thornhill.

95
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
I...I need a job, Mr Coates.

96
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
I need to find work in this valley.

97
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't get a job...
after what happened.

98
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,760
If you're not too proud
to skivvy for me...

99
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
you can collect the rents.

100
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Morning.

101
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Tell me, now.

102
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,920
Either of you gentlemen
hear talk of Red Killeen?

103
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,480
You're his friends, aren't you?
Least, that's what I've been hearing.

104
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,120
Be sure and come at closing time

105
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,280
Great at clearing the place, you is!

106
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
I've spoken to my lawyers, Charles.

107
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,960
Take me on as a partner...
and your problems will be over.

108
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We'll put up half the capital each.

109
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,760
I've got my inheritance and you...
can borrow against this estate.

110
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
I assume you have control of it.

111
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,680
I'm the only one to inherit.

112
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
Sunday is Whitsun.

113
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,160
The men deserve some celebration -
a couple of kegs.

114
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,440
A hog roast. Maybe dancing.

115
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,880
A Whit Fair,
like any proper village.

116
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,360
'If thou of fortune be bereft,

117
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,040
and in thy store
there be but left two loaves,

118
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
sell one and, with the dole,

119
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,440
buy hyacinths to feed thy soul.'

120
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,960
Are you suggesting poetry evenings?

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,160
I'm suggesting we make this valley
somewhere they want to live and work.

122
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Another Eden.

123
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
- It's not near enough.
- I know. And I'm sorry for it.

124
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,120
Can't do you no special favours.
Coates has paid me to collect rents.

125
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,960
- Not listen to folks' sad stories.
- Jack saved some, but it were less than I reckoned.

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,360
You'd better get out of them
smart clothes and start earning.

127
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,080
It's less than a week since he died.

128
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,840
Are you telling me
I've no more time to mourn?

129
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
My poor Jack.

130
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,040
Poor Jack would sooner you didn't
get booted out of your home.

131
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
I didn't know it were you.

132
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,840
I mean,
that's been leaving them flowers.

133
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
You knew him, Tobias?

134
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
He lodged with me for a while.

135
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
How are you holding up?

136
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,720
I'm not sure how to make a go of it.

137
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
It's a hard town for women.

138
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,880
You have to scratch
to find your place.

139
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,040
Reckon they'll always be willing to
pay for a plate and a mattress.

140
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Me, I've got no spare rooms.

141
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,360
I'll have to find
some other employment.

142
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,760
Something you want to say?

143
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,960
Begging your pardon, sir, I...

144
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,800
don't like speaking out of turn.

145
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,160
All evidence to the contrary
these past 30 years.

146
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What do you wish to scold me for?

147
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,920
I was with you
every day you grew up, Charlie.

148
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,680
I feel like I raised you.

149
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,520
And I saw...
what she did to you before.

150
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,280
And how she... broke you.

151
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,120
It's different now.
She's offering to invest her fortune.

152
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,400
But you can't just
shut your heart away.

153
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,520
That'll be all, Epiphany. Thank you.

154
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,760
- I see you've got t'sign up in t'window.
- Johnny left this morning.

155
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
You're the man of the house now.

156
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,520
I feel bad for him.

157
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
It's not your fault.

158
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
I were speaking badly to him.

159
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,160
He were just trying to help us out.

160
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
George, it's safer this way.

161
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,240
No-one'll find out what happened.

162
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,440
Ma'am. Your sign says lodgings.

163
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,460
- Where did the prince end up?
- Found himself other lodgings.

164
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,740
I can smell a quarrel

165
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,220
You can lose that smirk
before you come for supper.

166
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,740
Morning to you, ma'am.

167
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,780
Morning.

168
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,100
George,
go out and fetch some water in.

169
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,420
George?

170
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,420
Fine children you've got there.

171
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Will you be staying long?

172
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,220
As long as it takes to find one man.

173
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,020
I could have been a collier
working down a mine

174
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,300
I could have been a sailor
a-sailing on the brine, but...

175
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,820
I'm a navvy, I'm a navvy,
working on the line

176
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,260
I'm a navvy, I'm a navvy,
working on the line

177
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,780
I'm a navvy, I'm a navvy,
working on the line...

178
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,580
That detective fella, he's gone out.

179
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
You know why he's come here,
don't you?

180
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,740
Remember your dad
took you fishing one time?

181
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,780
He said I were no good for it.

182
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
I wouldn't stay still.

183
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,900
Scared them fishes away, I did.

184
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,060
I need you...
to be a fisherman for me.

185
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,380
I need you to remain quite... still.

186
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,740
Day or two... he'll be gone.

187
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,020
Navvies are all
cut from t'same cloth.

188
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,100
They all wear the same,
walk the same,

189
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,580
cuss the same -
easy to lose yourself in a crowd.

190
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,620
So you think Killeen
has slipped the net.

191
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,220
There is a chance he'd make for port.

192
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,020
- Find a berth overseas.
- Easy way to be sure.

193
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,500
Telegraph port authorities.

194
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,380
Liverpool.

195
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,860
She's a real marvel, that Annie.

196
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,060
What happened... twixt the two of you?

197
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,060
She's not my sweetheart. Never was.

198
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
You're better off.

199
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,220
With two children
hanging off her apron...

200
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,420
It's better to be a free agent
in a town like this.

201
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,500
Found yourself a new friend, Prince?

202
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,100
He ain't no navvy.
Looks like a pretty lass, he does.

203
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,540
'Appen the prince wants to
get in his trousers

204
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,620
Leave it. He wants someone to rag.

205
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,340
Don't start nothing, Dagger.
Take your ease.

206
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,820
- No-one's gonna curse me to my face.
- Come on, lad. You be smart now.

207
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Whoa!

208
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,300
You're a dead man. You know that?

209
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,060
Oh! It takes two of you now,
does it

210
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,420
'Ey, Prince.
What do you reckon to this, then?

211
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,780
It takes two of them
to beat just one of us.

212
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,380
Get off him! Get off him!

213
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,620
- Break it up!
- Get off him! Get off him!

214
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:40,060
Get off! Next person who raises
his hand leaves this town! I mean it!

215
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,860
We'll finish 'em sometime,
you and me.

216
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,140
What's going on here?

217
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,980
The prince and his mate got into it with
Hawker and Shay. It's just a bit of sport.

218
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,380
All right, you men. Back to work!

219
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,340
- I was just looking! Let me go!
- Why should I?

220
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,500
- It's the birch for you.
- I'll tell you something true.

221
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,820
Red had a fight down by the river.
Good fighter the other fella was too.

222
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,020
Did you see his face?
Do you know his name?

223
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,060
Tell me before I let you go.

224
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,540
No, I just heard talk of it.

225
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,420
Happened over near waterfall.

226
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,900
Hey, son. Fetch me that.

227
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,940
Ever seen a man fight wi' a knife?

228
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,620
You'll dispatch a man with one stroke
if you know where to hit right.

229
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,620
The Killeens of the Earth.

230
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Maybe somebody finished him off.

231
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100
What do you think?

232
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,860
Well, I can't pretend
you're not welcome.

233
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
There's more than enough work going.

234
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,780
Tell me true.
Do you think you'll manage it?

235
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,780
Hm?

236
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,300
Have some stranger
put his paws over you?

237
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,340
I need two bob by t'week's end.

238
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,300
Do you reckon one customer
would do it?

239
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,780
One jig'll give you what you need.
It's fast money.

240
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,820
Usually, half a minute.

241
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,900
Please, God, my Jack'll forgive me
for making this my living.

242
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,580
Where's the money gone?

243
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,420
Someone's been in here,
taken everything.

244
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,660
- Where were you?
- Washing pots. You can't blame me.

245
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,180
I were only gone a minute. And how would
they even know the money was there?

246
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,020
Oh, the fool.

247
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,940
The little fool!

248
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,780
- What's happened?
- George has run away from here. - Why? What's gone on?

249
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,980
He did something.
It's best you don't know about it.

250
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,020
I need to go after him.
You serve supper.

251
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,780
- If anyone asks, I'm sick.
- Where are you going to find him?

252
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,380
I know exactly where he's headed.

253
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,200
I've telegraphed
the port authorities.

254
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,360
Expect a reply within a day.

255
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,560
Post rider will deliver
directly to me.

256
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,200
We'll find out
if Killeen's fled abroad.

257
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,040
Still... I reckon there might be
another answer, maybe.

258
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,040
Killeen was involved in a fight
just before he disappeared.

259
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,080
And... you think...

260
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,600
I think navvies are proud men.

261
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,280
They won't let a slight
go unpunished.

262
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,240
I think he might be under the soil.

263
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,840
So.

264
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
- We're looking for the man who beat him.
- Aye.

265
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,520
A fighter. And a good'un.

266
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,440
What if we held a competition at
your Whitsun fair, a sporting match?

267
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,680
We set the men against each other.

268
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
All the good fighters will declare.

269
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,600
And the man you're after,
he's sure to be amongst them.

270
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,160
- So... have you ever worked a tavern before?
- No.

271
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,440
We're saving. I'm... trying
to help my ma the best I can.

272
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,000
Be in in a half hour. Best frock.

273
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,760
Alma. This is Martha.
She'll be working alongside you.

274
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,200
- What do you reckon?
- What's that?

275
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,600
Have you heard about the wrestling
match at the Whitsun Fair?

276
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,200
You and me.
We can challenge Hawker and Shay.

277
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,520
Something about you
is far too reckless.

278
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,160
But I reckon that's how I like it.

279
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,720
I need to know about
them bruises on your skin, lad.

280
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,840
I'm looking for a navvy
who's been brawling.

281
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,960
- Shouldn't have more than 30 or 40
men to choose from - Turn around.

282
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,360
- What?
- I'm looking for knife marks.

283
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,240
A navvy's skin's
a catalogue of violence.

284
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
No. You're not the man.

285
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,080
Now. Make him wash his self.

286
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,200
And he's paying for a jig,
not a mattress.

287
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,400
He falls asleep and snores, you
kick him out of bed. Do you hear?

288
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,760
Right, fella. She's waiting for you.

289
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,200
Mrs Laggan.

290
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,680
You might as well keep 'em.

291
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,760
They're going back into your pocket.

292
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,600
I...I'm sorry. No, missus.

293
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,440
I don't reckon how
I'm eager to do this.

294
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,880
What's the matter? Don't you like me?

295
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,560
Oh, aye. I like you right enough.

296
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,400
Two bob. That's all I need
to settle my bill for t'week.

297
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
Stay.

298
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
- Please.
- Erm...

299
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
I...I'll take this for rent, then.

300
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
But I won't lay a finger on you.

301
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Well, I haven't done nowt to earn it.

302
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,760
We've talked some.

303
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,840
I bought your company with it.
How's that for you?

304
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
I don't know what we are,
Mrs Laggan.

305
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,600
We're not townsfolk,
we're not countrymen neither.

306
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
But I surely know that...

307
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,920
...we're not savages.

308
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,360
This... can be
our little arrangement.

309
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,640
Oh, look who it is.

310
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,640
'Ey! Any of you likely lads
wanna try your hand?

311
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,960
Whit Fair wrestling.
You can earn yoursen 10 shilling.

312
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,160
Put your name down, Hawker.
You'll make us all rich!

313
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,600
Them two think the money's
as good as won.

314
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,800
They'll have to get past
Dagger and me.

315
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,240
- Call yourself a wrestler?
- More like a big old.

316
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
By name but not by nature eh

317
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,920
I swear I never touched 'em.

318
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,160
Must've knocked 'em with
your sleeve. You - get sweeping.

319
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,520
- Everything all right?
- She's useless, this one.

320
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,120
George?

321
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,560
I knew you'd come here.

322
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
You can't make me go back there.

323
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,080
You don't have any choice.

324
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
This isn't your home any more.

325
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,800
You can't pretend the last few days
haven't happened.

326
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,120
Where's the money?

327
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,720
How much is missing?

328
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,480
- I hitched a ride. I had to pay.
- So that's half my savings.

329
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,520
- Now you hate me.
- Don't ever say that.

330
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,640
Come back.

331
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
I promise I'll look after you.

332
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,080
- I won't let anything happen to you.
- You're a liar.

333
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,720
- No-one can promise that.
- George.

334
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,800
This is about your dad.

335
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,680
He left us wi' nothing.

336
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
He did.

337
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,080
But I am never... leaving you.

338
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
That promise is unbreakable.

339
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Saw you coming across the moors.

340
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,640
Are you bringing Mr Bamford
a telegram?

341
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,360
- Aye, sir.
- I'm the agent here. - I'll take it off your hands.

342
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
If you make it worth my while

343
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,400
What brings you out here,
Mr Bamford?

344
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,520
I don't recall giving you permission
to open my telegram.

345
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,640
Killeen's not in the passenger log,
is he?

346
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,000
You know where he is, though,
don't you?

347
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,960
Would you believe
I'm ignorant of his whereabouts?

348
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,240
You won yourself quite a promotion
after the explosion happened.

349
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,440
You paid Killeen to do it,
didn't you?

350
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,920
This town was run by a drunk.

351
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Thornhill had no place here.

352
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,920
So you let some crazy man loose
with a barrel load of powder

353
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,160
just to win this mile of track
from him?

354
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
Ever fought in a war?

355
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,920
Ever marched behind
a general who's inept?

356
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,320
One bullet in the general's back
can save a whole army.

357
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,720
So. It's for the good of the rest.

358
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,040
Anything else to say
before I march you off in irons?

359
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,360
You're not gonna lift a finger,
except to shake my hand.

360
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,560
And maybe...

361
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,880
...count out some of this money.

362
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,920
There's a price
to every man's loyalty.

363
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
What's yours, sir?

364
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,800
Whatever Blackwood's paying you,
I'll double it.

365
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,840
Come and place your money.
Place your money.

366
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,440
- Yes, sir. What can I do for you? Can I place a bet?
- Yes.

367
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,520
That one.

368
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,840
Didn't wanna go watch?

369
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,480
I want to stay by you.

370
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,120
Come on!

371
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,000
I get to do what I should've done
before. Bury your face in t'dirt!

372
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,240
Bamford's still here, then,
sniffing round.

373
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,760
You're lucky. You don't have to
share a bunk with him.

374
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,880
He's staying at Annie's wi' us.

375
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,440
All right. The rules are simple.
One man in the ring at a time.

376
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,720
Fighters can swap out.
All it takes is a handshake.

377
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,440
All right? Fighters, step in!

378
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,320
Dagger, shake!

379
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,080
Shake!

380
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,760
One man in the ring at a time!

381
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,720
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

382
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,200
Up you get! Up you get, pretty boy!

383
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,560
Here we go! Come on!

384
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,720
Come on! Let's have it, please!

385
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,760
Get out of it!

386
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,800
What's the matter? What's happened?

387
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,040
I can't watch. It's... it's Johnny.

388
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,360
He's being ground into t'dirt.

389
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,560
Come on, lads! Come on, lads!

390
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,840
Johnny!

391
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,040
- Wrestle!
- Come on, Johnny!

392
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Wrestle!

393
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,880
And fight!

394
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,000
- Come on, Johnny!
- Ten...

395
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,520
nine, eight, seven...

396
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,640
six, five...

397
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,760
four, three, two, one!

398
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,520
Come on!
Hawker and Shay are the winners!

399
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,840
Yes!

400
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
Come on, lad.

401
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,200
It was my fault. I distracted you.

402
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,600
No, you made it easier,
losing for real.

403
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,080
We bet against ourselves.
Reckon we'll have cleaned up here.

404
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,920
There's your winnings.

405
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,880
- What will you do with it?
- Probably keep Polly occupied a while.

406
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,880
What about you, Prince?

407
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
I'll see you at the tavern, lads.

408
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,920
Come here.

409
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,680
- What's this?
- It ain't enough for you to set up home again in t'village.

410
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,200
But it's enough to get the lad
away from Bamford.

411
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
Take the children and leave here.

412
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,920
I've not that many friends
that I'll forget the best of them.

413
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Thank you.

414
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,840
Oh!

415
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,880
Sir.

416
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,920
I've been waiting for you,
Mrs Quaintain.

417
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,120
I've come to tell you...

418
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,080
...I'll be leaving.

419
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,680
Killeen is overseas.

420
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,360
He won't be crossing my path again.

421
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
Much obliged.

422
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,040
Where's my wandering boy tonight?

423
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,480
The boy of my tenderest care

424
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,680
The boy who was once
my joy and light

425
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,000
- Excuse me.
- The child of my love and prayer?

426
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,160
Got the telegram from Liverpool.

427
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,240
Killeen was in the passenger log.

428
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,600
He'll be halfway round the world
by now.

429
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,280
- Are you certain he acted alone?
- Aye, sir.

430
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,320
Reckon that's what happened.

431
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,760
Oh, where is my boy tonight?

432
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I reckon I owe you, sir.

433
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,120
You... you owe me nowt, ma'am.

434
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,360
- I paid for a portion of your time.
- I owe you.

435
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
I owe you one dance.

436
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Thank you.

437
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,680
Something's wrong.

438
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,720
What is it?

439
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,680
I'm afraid women
aren't much welcome in business.

440
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,320
My uncle has control of my money.

441
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
He's refusing to let me invest it.

442
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,240
But... I thought...

443
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,320
- You led me to believe...
- Oh, don't fret, Charles. All's not lost.

444
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,680
I'm committed to this enterprise.

445
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,160
And the money is due to me
the second I'm married.

446
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,800
Oh, fine. So I just have to wait for you to find
a suitable husband and we can be business partners

447
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,840
We could always hasten
that day along, of course.

448
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,880
We're a pair... you and I.

449
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,840
Both passionate about the work here.

450
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,800
Marry me. We'll secure a future.

451
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,280
I'm in the unique position
of having tried that once already.

452
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,520
I've been paying all my life
for that one mistake I made.

453
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,560
You have too.

454
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,560
Can't this be the moment
that we begin again?

455
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,920
- He bought the story. He thinks Killeen has fled.
- Good.

456
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,480
You'd better hope
he is in the ground.

457
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,160
Who do you think
would've put him there?

458
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,560
That fella they call the prince.

459
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,600
There's a secret going on there.

460
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,200
I've seen navvies fight
a hundred times.

461
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,920
Never seen a navvy
shake hands before a fight.

462
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,600
Whoever he is, he's a gentleman.

463
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
I thought you were leaving tonight.

464
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,080
I thought I'd never see you again.

465
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,240
I can't go back home. Not yet.

466
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,560
But here's as good
a place as any to wait.
