1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,919
Or we could just buy me a hi-fi.

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,439
Concentrate.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,559
Sid's going to be spending more time
in his baby stroller than anywhere else.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,119
It's like the office was for you
when you were a working man.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,639
Ah, yes! Those happy times!

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,119
That one with blue on it?

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,599
What? The aluminium frame?

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,239
Then I don't know, Dale!

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,079
What happened to the time when you
just chucked them in a pram

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,639
and listened to Screamadelica?

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,680
Ken!

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,519
Jess! Haven't seen you
since that time at the hospital.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,439
The time I gave birth! And you...

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,919
Yeah, that time, yeah.
How's motherhood?

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,639
Loving it. And paternity leave?

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,759
How does it feel to be
a feminist icon?

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,959
What can I say?
I'm a hero to all women.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,879
THEY LAUGH

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,239
Ah, the stroller debate.
Marc and I went for that one.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,919
The Jill Cotterill. It's durable,
light, turns into a car seat.

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,560
Oh, gosh, she's a beauty!

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,199
And so this horrific experience
draws to a close!

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,999
I owe you, Jess.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,319
Don't be silly!

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,279
Actually, you know what?

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,119
I'm doing this mums' group thing
with some of the girls from NCT.

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,359
You should come.

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,719
Bloke? At a mums' group?
Think that might be a bit weird.

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,279
And I said to the doctor, "Hey,
sonny - what about MY mastitis?"

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,519
THEY LAUGH

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,319
Oh! Right, cake o'clock, I think.

32
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,519
Don't you shake your
head at me, Jenny.

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,759
That baby weight is dropping right
off and you bloody deserve it!

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,560
Excuse me for a second, ladies.

35
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,359
- Cake report.
- This is going to be
the best darn coffee cake

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,199
those girls have ever tasted!

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,159
- Who would have thought that mums'
group would be so ace?
- I know!

38
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,119
We get to enjoy all of the fun
and gossiping

39
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,079
but we get to avoid
the catty infighting.

40
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,239
Oh, by the way,
Beth said your fruit cake was dry.

41
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,479
- Prissy little tart!
- Right.

42
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,879
Left the stuff for my meeting!

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,639
Ooh! How's your coffee morning
going?

44
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,519
Tremendously!
Ken has a foolproof system.

45
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,879
- I do.
- I prepare all the food,
clean the house and wash up.

46
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,679
Ken is the social face
of the operation -

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,039
occupying the guests,
and checking the food is tasty.

48
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,199
Sounds about right!

49
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,399
Right, now, you wash up.
You - come and meet the girls!

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,359
So, everyone...

51
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,039
Oh, Ken - busted! Now Laura's going
to know about your daytime harem!

52
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,319
HE LAUGHS
It's not a harem.

53
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,879
Well, I think we would ALL like to
thank you for letting us

54
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,279
borrow him, Laura.

55
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,279
With Marc in Dubai,
Ken's the only male company I get!

56
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,239
Well, I hope he's not
droning on about history too much!

57
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,119
- You!
- Why would you say that, Laura?

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,519
Ken is a fascinating intellect.
I hope you appreciate him!

59
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,319
I do. And it's Lorna.

60
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,479
- What's Lorna, Laura?
- My name - it's Lorna.

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,639
What? No!

62
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,079
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
So embarrassing! Oh, ha-ha!

63
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,599
- Lorna.
- Yeah.
- Lorna.

64
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,999
SHE LAUGHS

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
Not Laura. Lorna.

66
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,319
OK! Well. Back to work.

67
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,599
THEY CHORTLE

68
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,199
Oh! By the way, save
the 25th for Eliza's christening.

69
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,879
Only right you should be there, Ken,

70
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,639
seeing as you were
there at liftoff.

71
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,719
- What?
- How do you mean, there at liftoff?

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,679
I think what Jess means is
we were both at the same hospital

73
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,679
when the babies came. Right, Jess?

74
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,799
Right. Well, so just think about it!

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,840
SHE LAUGHS

76
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,879
- She's a head case.
- No, she's OK.

77
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,999
Nope, she's a head case.
See you later!

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,440
Squeeze Sid for me.

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,199
HE SIGHS

80
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,319
Jess. What was that about?

81
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,279
Of course I haven't told Lorna that
I was at Eliza's birth!

82
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,399
What? You haven't told her?

83
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,559
No, I haven't told her. Because of
you, I missed Sid's birth!

84
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,079
If Lorna finds out,
I'll get murdered in my sleep,

85
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,279
so keep it to yourself!

86
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,479
Um... oh. It's a bit weird.
I mean, so what?

87
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,719
You held my hand as I gave birth.
It was an act of kindness.

88
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,839
Plus you wouldn't let go of my hand,
so...

89
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,519
Oh, Ken! I just want to make it
clear -

90
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,679
I am happily married to Marc.

91
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,639
So am I! Very happily!
Not to Marc. To Laura. Lorna.

92
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,399
Well, OK. So then,
just please - tell your wife!

93
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,519
Because whatever problems you
and Laura are having,

94
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,359
I just don't want to be
a part of them, OK?

95
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,759
Lecture over.

96
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,039
SHE GIGGLES

97
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,399
But...

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,199
Ling is thousands of miles away,

99
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,520
so how come our love feels
even stronger?

100
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,919
And if love transcends time
and space,

101
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,119
perhaps therein lies
the secret of the universe.

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,559
What do you think, Dyl?

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,439
Couldn't give a shit, mate.

104
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,159
Hey. What's that game you're
playing on your robot phone?

105
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,559
It's not a game, you bell-end.
It's Love Swipe.

106
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,159
Ah, fuck! I just liked a munter.

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,559
Love Swipe is a way of finding
romantic partners?

108
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,399
No, it's hunting willing snatch.
Here, have a look. Right, OK.

109
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,799
So here we have... ah, older woman,
24.

110
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,119
Only 100 or so metres away from
us... Rachel!

111
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,199
- That's Mom!
- I flicked right, I flicked right.

112
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,399
These treacherous eyes!

113
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,639
Dylan, are you trying to hook up
with me on Love Swipe?

114
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,559
Your photo's like three years old.
You look completely different!

115
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,839
Yeah, right. So my face has
completely changed

116
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,439
in three years, has it?
- Mom!

117
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,679
You didn't say you were
electronically dating.

118
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,799
Yeah, well, I thought
I'd put myself on there.

119
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,959
- You know, see what the fuss was about.
- Oh, phew!

120
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,039
It seems like there's been nobody
on the scene since December!

121
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,360
- Yeah. How many dates you been on, Rach?
- In total...

122
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,679
- ...none.
- What?

123
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,759
Come on, Mom! Get a move on.

124
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,119
You're not going to find a man
mooching about the house!

125
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,279
Unless there are some available
guys round here -

126
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,039
and I don't know of any.

127
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,080
Thanks, Dale.

128
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,959
- Phew! Longest day ever!
- Hello.

129
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,359
- Mwah!
- How's our little Sid?

130
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,280
Yeah, he's good.
I just put him down.

131
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,919
Well, the Briony
and Tim saga continues.

132
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,439
Who's Briony and Tim?

133
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,559
- From work.
- Oh!

134
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,439
Don't you listen to a word I say?

135
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,959
Of course!
Your voice is music to me, my love.

136
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,840
- I just sometimes don't
concentrate on the lyrics.
- Hah!

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,519
So - there's probably something
I should tell you. It's no biggy.

138
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,679
And certainly no-one's fault.
So promise me you won't over-react.

139
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,839
I will react the exact right amount.
What is it?

140
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,319
Well, do you remember when Sid
was born?

141
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,359
I think I recall it, yeah.

142
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,159
Well, it's a funny story.

143
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,799
I...I ran into Jess
while we were waiting for Sid.

144
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,199
And she grabbed hold of my hand

145
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,719
and she wouldn't let go
until she'd given birth.

146
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,599
Which explains why I was late. Why
I missed Sid's birth. It's silly!

147
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,959
But like I say, it's no biggy.

148
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,879
No biggy?

149
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,160
No, no biggy.

150
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,999
Is this a biggy?

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,079
Jesus Christ, Ken! No biggy!

152
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,279
Come on, Lorn. It's not like it
didn't work out all right.

153
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,119
Sid's great. And you're the best
wife a man ever...

154
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,519
Oh, shut your face! You have no idea
what I was going through,

155
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,239
what it takes to push a thing
like that out of your bits!

156
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,839
May I remind you I have seen it
three times, actually,

157
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,439
with two different...

158
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,759
- Oh, shit. Lorn!
- Hi, Lorna. Hi, Chief Ken.

159
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,999
- It wasn't my fault.
- Oh, it never is your fault, is it, Ken?

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,919
"Whoops, I shot the cat!
Whoops, I didn't have a vasectomy!"

161
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,479
Guys. What's happening?

162
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,839
Are Chief Ken
and Lorna going to get a divorce?

163
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,519
Oh, no, this happens every couple
of years. Believe me, it's worse
when they make up.

164
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,280
Dad walking round like he's John Mayer
just because he's done it twice in a week.

165
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,359
How's your robot-phone dating
going?

166
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,239
Love Swipe is crammed with goons.

167
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,639
Well, I hope you'll give 'em
a chance, little Miss Fussy!

168
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,719
Do you? All right, well - how about
him? He's quite attractive.

169
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,959
Maybe I should go round to his
and have wild sex.

170
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,279
- Be all right with that, would you?
- Absolutely doodle dandy!
- Absolutely doodle dandy.

171
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,519
- All right. There - a match.
- What!

172
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,519
Oh! And he wants to meet now.

173
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,159
I'll just go over there, shall I?

174
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,159
You know, unless anyone has any
objections to that?

175
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,199
- No, none here.
- OK. Yeah. See you
in the morning, then. Or not!

176
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,720
- OK!
- OK.

177
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,120
I could not be happier for her!

178
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,119
Maybe we should get
a super king-size.

179
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,719
That way you can be even further
away and even more ridiculous.

180
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,319
Just more comfortable like this.

181
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,199
Lorna, I can't help what happened.

182
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,079
I didn't mean to upset you,
but what can I do about it?

183
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,679
Well, here's an idea - you can
stop meeting up with Jess.

184
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,359
Ha-ha! Not happening.

185
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,919
OK, if you don't
care about my feelings...

186
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,639
What about MY feelings, Lorn?

187
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,599
Jess runs the mums' group, which
happens to be my entire social life.

188
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,679
No, I'm sorry -
you don't get to veto my friends.

189
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,439
Friends? As if! She's after you!

190
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,759
What? Don't be ridiculous!

191
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,559
"Oh, Ken! What a fascinating
intellect, Ken!

192
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,879
"Oh, Ken, hold my hand
while I give birth, Ken!"

193
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,919
Get real, Lorn!

194
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,799
I am greying, I'm out of shape and
Jess is a young, highly attractive...

195
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,280
Fuck! I didn't mean that!

196
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,199
No, I'm sorry.
There is a point of principle here.

197
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,520
I am not backing down on this.
Final word.

198
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,799
HE GROANS

199
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,599
OK, OK! you win!
I won't see Jess again.

200
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,519
I surrender my dignity at your whim.

201
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,799
Nice to see
the patriarchy in action again.

202
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,559
How I love to rule the world.

203
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,479
Now will you please come back
to the centre of the bed!

204
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,399
I don't know what you're
going on about.

205
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,999
SHE SCREAMS

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,080
Right, I am getting a glass
of water.

207
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,239
- Hello?
- Hey, how's it kicking?
You must be Rachel's...

208
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,839
ancient housemate?

209
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,959
I'm her father.

210
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,919
Father? OK, I'm Freddy.
I'm a... new friend of hers.

211
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,119
We met last night, and then we had
a... a sleepover.

212
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,519
You know.

213
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,919
- Is this awkward? This feels awkward.
- Let us eat our breakfast in silence.

214
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,199
Yeah.

215
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,719
- Hello.
- Ah, this is Freddy.

216
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,759
Freddy and Rachel
went on a date last night.

217
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,479
Interesting. Did he hold hands with
another woman while she gave birth?

218
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,319
Oh. Seamless segue! And thank you
for airing our personal grievances

219
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,279
in front of our daughter's one-night
stand.

220
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,999
I'm not a one-night-stand
kind of guy.

221
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,039
Are you going to be boyfriend
and girlfriend from now on, are you?

222
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,919
- I mean, I'm not in that place, so...
- Thank you!
- Shit! Rachel actually got laid!

223
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,199
Ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

224
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,879
- You're still here?
- Well, it's breakfast, so...
most important meal of the day.

225
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Good morning, my beautiful family!

226
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,119
And complete stranger.
Would you like some pancakes?

227
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,799
Yeah, that's what I'm talking
about.

228
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,959
You must be a friend of Rachel's?

229
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,559
Ah, sort of. We met last night.

230
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,679
On a date.

231
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,119
Oh, fun. Did you stay the night
here?

232
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,919
- Yeah.
- With Rachel?
- Yeah.
- In her bedroom?

233
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,999
- Yes, Dale - we slept together, OK?
- Argh!

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,719
Dale!

235
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,999
I am so sorry! I'll get him
cleaned up in no time.

236
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,959
- What the hell was that?
- Weird, right?

237
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,679
It must be my training with Mr Xi -
I get these crazy reflex reactions.

238
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,879
I think he'll be OK.

239
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,199
- Dale, you were the one who told me
to start dating again!
- I know, you should!

240
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,199
Then why punch the first guy
I spend the night with? I thought you,
I mean, we had made it very clear.

241
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,199
- There's nothing between us.
- Yeah, what are you saying?

242
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,639
You were jealous. Of me and him.

243
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,879
What! I love Ling.
See previous conversations.

244
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,319
Well, obviously, there are some
suppressed emotions going on here.
Maybe deal with them, Dale.

245
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,599
Because I can't have this jealous ex
going round the house saying

246
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,799
he's not jealous
when he so clearly is.

247
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
I don't care either way... so...!

248
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,079
We're going to take our arms into
the air, stretching to the side.

249
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,999
Rachel is so wrong!

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,799
I mean, me - jealous? No way!

251
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,359
Sure, once I thought her to
be my one and only eternal love.

252
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,559
But that was so eight months ago!

253
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,599
Right leg in the air.
Really push into that stretch.

254
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,879
- What do you think, Chief Ken?
- Oh, God.

255
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:51,439
- Chief!
- Yeah, can we talk
about this another time.
- Hey!

256
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,919
Oh, no!

257
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,559
Right, as soon as this class
finishes, we are leaving.

258
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,399
Keep walking, Dale.
Just keep walking, please.

259
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,080
Ken! Ken! KEN!

260
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,759
SHE LAUGHS

261
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,519
Wow, that is some world-class baby
yoga leaving there.

262
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,479
Ha-ha! Right. It was great to see
you anyway, Jess. Bye, now!

263
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,479
Hey, what are you guys up to
this afternoon?

264
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,159
Some of the mums are coming over.

265
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,559
I've made a killer pistachio tart.

266
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,599
Oh, that sounds delicious! Yeah,
we have absolutely nothing going on!

267
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,159
Oh, but I'm afraid we do have
something going on, don't we?

268
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,640
We've got that thing, Dale.
You know that thing we've got to do.

269
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,719
Oh, I get you - THAT thing!

270
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,159
He will just...!

271
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,639
No, Chief Ken,
that thing is NEXT Wednesday.

272
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,999
- This afternoon is completely free.
- Great! So come round.

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,759
Oh, but I'm sorry, we can't. Get in.

274
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,799
Bye.

275
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,839
Oh, um, which way you headed?

276
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,399
Through town. See you!

277
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,439
You couldn't give me
a lift, could you?

278
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,719
It's just, bit worried about Eliza,
it's such a hot day

279
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,679
and the sun being
SO dangerous for tiny babies.

280
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,639
It's very hot.

281
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,159
Of course.

282
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,480
Great. Oh, isn't he a nice man!

283
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,919
Right. We're dropping her
straight off at her house.

284
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,600
And you do not mention this to
Lorna. Do you understand?

285
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,039
Are you sure I can't tempt you in?
The girls will be round soon.

286
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,119
- I've got eclairs in from Druckers.
- Oh!
- No, can't do it.

287
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,279
Suit yourself.
Dale, would you be a sweetheart?

288
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,320
Of course.

289
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,920
- Bye.
- Bye.

290
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,079
Thank you.

291
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,679
Chief Ken, have you gone insane?

292
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,679
That's some of the finest Vienna
patisserie in Birmingham!

293
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,679
Lorna says I'm not
allowed to see Jess.

294
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,079
She's a little bit jealous.

295
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,760
But mums' group is the most fun
we have all week!

296
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,999
Oi! Where are you going?

297
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,599
- Lorna didn't say I couldn't
see Jess, did she?
- Well, no, but...
- OK.

298
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,280
- I'm going to go have some cake
and have the best time ever.
- Traitor!

299
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,079
What do you think, Sid?

300
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,199
It's not like I'm doing
anything wrong, is it?

301
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,239
Jess is my friend
and I love mums' group.

302
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,719
What do you think, my boy?

303
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,679
Should I obey your delusional
mother,

304
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,119
or should I make my own decisions in
life like a proper adult?

305
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,320
Who's the chief here?

306
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,160
Hello?

307
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,039
Oh, great! You changed your mind!

308
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,319
Yeah! When are the girls getting
here?

309
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,439
Oh, dunno - in about an hour or so.

310
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,439
Dale, would you be a love,

311
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,479
and run and get some of that nice
coffee from town.

312
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,639
I invite everyone over for coffee
and what do I forget to buy? Coffee!

313
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,319
THEY LAUGH

314
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,879
- Yeah. I'll be back soon!
- Right.

315
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,920
You make yourself comfortable and
I'll be back in a sec.

316
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,480
There we are, Sidney.

317
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,040
HE EXHALES

318
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,199
- There you go.
- Oh!

319
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,479
Wine?

320
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,679
Well, there's no coffee, is there!
Right, then. Shower for me.

321
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,999
Sorry? A shower?

322
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,799
Well, I can't receive the girls in
my yoga sweats, can I?

323
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,199
OK, Jess - should I go
and come back another time, cos...?

324
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,759
Oh, no, I'll be two ticks.

325
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,799
Don't worry, we've got a couple
of hours before the gang get here.

326
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,960
A COUPLE of hours?

327
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,640
What are you doing?

328
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,919
Ken! Oh, you're not leaving,
are you?

329
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,079
Shouldn't you be wearing
more clothes?

330
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,479
Why are you walking towards me?
What's happening?

331
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,639
What's happening is
you are going to ravish me,

332
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,519
you sexy giant old man, you!

333
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,399
What? There will be no ravishing!
Not today or tomorrow.

334
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,879
You were supposed to be my coffee
morning friend!

335
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,239
I am very disappointed in you,
actually, Jess!

336
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,679
I know you're tempted.

337
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,559
You are scaring me! I am a happily
married man. What about Marc?

338
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,959
Oh, come on -
we both know there's no Marc.

339
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,439
What?

340
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,119
What? Don't undo that.
Why are you undoing that?

341
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,599
You are mental!

342
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,039
I am mental...

343
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,839
- Argh!
- ..and naked.

344
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,079
Ooh! I'm not looking.
And I'm leaving!

345
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,240
And I'm not looking! Goodbye!

346
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,800
- Get in the car.
- Why? I got coffee.
- She's a fucking nutter.

347
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,199
Lorna WAS right.
Jess WAS after you.

348
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,079
Yes. But Lorna had no right to try
and control my life.

349
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,919
I've behaved entirely faultlessly,
yet somehow, I'm also
massively in the wrong.

350
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,679
Well, I guess
I should be the one to tell Lorna.

351
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,839
No! Obviously we are not
going to tell her.

352
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,200
KEN'S PHONE RINGS

353
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,439
And you, my ex-friend, can bog off.

354
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,919
Right, inside.

355
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,719
And none of that accidental
truth-telling that you do.

356
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,839
No, I've shaken that out my system.
It's hard to do business...

357
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,919
...Crime...

358
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,799
...in China
without the odd porky pie.

359
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,319
I'll stick to my old standby -
we were in the market

360
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,479
shopping for Lotus dumplings
for the Dragon boat festival.

361
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,439
Or maybe just go to straight to your
room and never talk to Lorna again.

362
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,280
- OK.
- OK.
- DALE LAUGHS

363
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,399
Hiya, you two!

364
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,879
Hello, beautiful.

365
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,439
- Have you had a good day?
- Yeah.

366
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,040
He's asleep.

367
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,999
Sorry we argued.

368
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,159
Me too.

369
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,239
Maybe I was a bit
over-sensitive about Jess.

370
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,719
Still,
I probably shouldn't see her again.

371
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,079
- Oh, you're not bloody seeing her again.
- No.

372
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,919
- Have you seen her again?
- No! Of course not.

373
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,360
I appreciate it, love.

374
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,600
Fuck, it's started.

375
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,159
So, maybe we could put on a box set,

376
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,919
have a bit of Ken and Lorna time.

377
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,520
Yes, that's my favourite
kind of time.

378

KEN'S PHONE RINGS

379
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,719
Has it ever occurred to you that
I'm like a faithful,

380
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,799
non-alcoholic Don Draper?

381
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,199
Oh, you totally are!

382
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,799
- I am, right?
- Yeah.

383
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,359
MAD MEN THEME TUNE PLAYS

384
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,319
Five to go to finish the season.

385

BABY CRIES

386
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,679
- THEY BOTH SIGH
- I'll go.

387
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,999
Sit down.

388
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,359
IN DEEP VOICE: Draper's going to
change that nappy.

389
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,160
Oh, God, I am like him.
LORNA LAUGHS

390
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,839
Well, then, Sidney,

391
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,800
no in-depth analysis of the Arab-Israeli
conflict for us tonight.

392
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,919
No, we shall change that nappy,
quick bath and then bed. Deal?

393
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,559
KEN GASPS
Oh! Erm...

394
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,119
Here, I'll do that.
You take the weight off.

395
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,319
Nah, you're all right.

396
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,079
Ken, honestly,
It's my turn. You go and relax.

397
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,159
I don't want to relax.
You go and relax.

398
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,399
- Let me change him.
- Lorna...

399
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,719
You are stressed out and it's
ruining our family life, OK?

400
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,999
Now, get in there
and chill the fuck out, yeah?

401
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,919
Oh, OK, well, I'll go
and make a cup of tea, then.

402
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,800
Right, good. Tea would be nice.

403
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,640
No, no, no, no, no, no!

404
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,359
Oh, fuck.

405
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,759
Just going to take him for a little
drive, soothe him a bit.

406
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,079
- But he's not crying.
- He's upset, though. I can tell.

407
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,959
It's a sort of primary carer thing.

408

KEN'S PHONE RINGS

409
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,639
'Ken, I have been calling
and calling. Where is my baby?

410
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,879
'I want my baby back!'

411
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,240
I'm driving her over now. Don't
move, I'll be ten minutes, tops.

412
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,799
Might as well keep you company.

413
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,759
But let's make it a short ride.
How's our Siddles...?

414
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,959
He's very close to being upset.

415
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,080
Just going to get
something from the house.

416
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,919
- What am I going to do, Dale?
- Snap out of it, Ken!

417
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,999
But she's in the car,
she's in the car!

418
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,119
Now, you listen to me.

419
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,719
I've done swaps like these my whole
time with Mr Xi, all right?

420
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,799
Then with suitcases of money,
now with babies - same principle.

421
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,559
- What?
- I run to Jess' house, grab Sid.

422
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,679
You take her baby to the
leisure centre car park -

423
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,999
that's where we'll meet.

424
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,439
- All you need to do is keep Lorna...
- BOTH: ..from looking at the baby.

425
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,879
- You got this.
- I can do this.

426
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,479
- You got this, Chief Ken.
- I can swap these babies.

427
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,239
- I know you can!
- THEY BOTH YELL

428
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,960
- Dale!
- Just for luck.

429
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,239
Where's my baby?
Give me my baby, now!

430
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,119
Jessica, we're going to get your
baby. Just stay calm.

431
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,439
Also,
here's your coffee from earlier.

432
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,839
Fuck the coffee.

433
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,880
Let's go.

434
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,360
This is nice.

435
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,959
OK, I'm bored now, let's go home.

436
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,759
Lorna, I'm loving this.
Come on, let's chat.

437
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,799
Tell me about those guys at work,
you know, old Tom and Britney.

438
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,839
- Briony and Tim?
- Hell, yes, those guys.

439
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,519
- Well, Siobhan thought she wasn't
invited to the Christmas party.
- No!

440
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,679
I mean she's very nice,
she's in her fifties,

441
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,399
she lives on her own. You know,
she's a bit lonely.

442
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,599
Anyway she came in the other day
to work,

443
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,159
she just... She burst into tears,
Ken, on the shop floor and...

444
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,600
LORNA PRATTLES ON

445
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,399
...I took her down to the little
room where we have our cup of tea

446
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,560
and stuff and erm...

447
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,159
...anyway, she had to admit that she
hadn't even opened the envelope!

448
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,400
But I'm blathering.

449
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,239
What? I live for this shit,
Lorna, please...

450
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,599
OK, well, Briony
came in the following day...

451
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,399
...and directly said, "Don't
worry, I'll go and get..."

452
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,479
- BABY CRIES
- Ah.
- What?
- Probably wants his bottle.

453
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,079
No! Where are you going?

454
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,439
I'm going to get Sid,
bring him in the front for a cuddle.

455
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,319
Lorna, this is our time,
just you and me.

456
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,679
Let her cry... Let him cry.

457
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,599
- Ken, I can't listen to him cry.
- Lorna...

458
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,880
You're so beautiful.

459
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,439
- LORNA GASPS
- Ken!

460
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,320
I don't know what's got into you.

461
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,560
Oh, fuck!

462
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,439
Oh...

463
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,999
- Ken?
- Stop!

464
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,679
Someone's got my baby! My baby!

465
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,280
- Stop!
- What the hell have you
done with my baby?

466
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,959
Fuck!

467
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,719
No!

468
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,119
Ken, what the hell is going on?

469
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,799
- No!
- Ken!
- No!
- Ken!

470
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,079
- Ken!
- BRAKES SCREECH

471
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,679
What the hell are you doing?

472
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,199
So sorry, sir. I can explain.

473
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,799
- You've got a baby
in the back of your car.
- I definitely don't.

474
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,759
- No, you have. Dale put it in.
- Hi, I'm Dale.

475
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,360
Oh, thank God, my little girl. Oh!

476
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,319
Don't you dare bring your stodgy
sponge to my mums' group ever again.

477
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,799
KEN GASPS

478
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,399
How dare you!
That sponge was light as a feather.

479
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,719
What the hell is happening?

480
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,239
Going around putting babies in
people's cars. It's not on!

481
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,239
- Just calm down, I can explain.
- Well, I bloody hope you will, Ken.

482
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,679
- The thing is, I went round
to Jess' this afternoon...
- Ken!

483
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,119
- I know, I know you told me not to...
- No, I didn't.

484
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,719
- I'm sorry,
this is principally for Lorna.
- Who's Lorna?

485
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,760
My wife.

486
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,079
Jess was there
and I had Sid and Eliza and I...

487
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,519
No, no, no, mate.
Mate, listen, I am way behind here.

488
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,119
I'm sorry, Lorn,
can we talk about this in the car?

489
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,800
Yes, I think we'd
better get back to your son, Ken.

490
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,279
What I'm saying, Ken,
is I was right.

491
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,759
That mad bitch did fancy you.

492
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,479
Yes, all right, you were right.

493
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,599
In future, I will remember
I am irresistible to all women.

494
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,959
It's their incredibly
well-kept secret.

495
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,119
How fast did you run
out of that house?

496
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,439
Like a fat Usain Bolt.
THEY LAUGH

497
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,040
- Do you want some wine?
- Yes.

498
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,320
Rachel.

499
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,639
Watching Ken
and Lorna today has taught me

500
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,599
how destructive jealousy can be.

501
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,599
I mean, it seems their marriage
is OK now,

502
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,799
but it was touch-and-go there
earlier.

503
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,599
What are you trying to say, Dale?

504
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,239
About this morning.

505
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,199
I now accept that
somewhere deep, deep down,

506
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,679
I may have some residual feelings
towards you.

507
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,039
But, don't worry,

508
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,919
I will not let those feelings
get in the way of our friendship.

509
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,319
I will crush them
using the immense power of my mind.

510
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,880
OK, well, good luck with that.

511
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,639
So...

512
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,679
we're OK?

513
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,399
Absolutely doodle dandy.

514
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,520
Good.
