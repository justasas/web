1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,319
All right, all right! Bloody hell!

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,759
- Here you go.
- Why have you got my post?

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,559
Have you been hassling
the postman again?

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,919
Well, he says he's a postman,

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,679
but you can't trust anyone these
days - thank you, Tony Blair.

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,559
- Right, then, bye.
- So, um, what are your
plans for your birthday?

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,959
- It's not my birthday.
- You old wind-up merchant!

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,079
My idea - you and me hit the pubs
and get shitted.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,359
Like I say, it's not my birthday!

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,199
Then why have I got "Ken"
written on the palm of my hand?

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,159
- Because you're insane.
- That's weird,
I'm normally spot on with dates.

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,320
Funny story about that.
There was this little...

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,559
- Ah, good morning!
- Good morning!
- Happy birthday, Dad.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,479
Oh, thank you! Aw!

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,999
What's this?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,479
- THUD!
- Ow!

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,879
Oh, hey, Chief Ken!

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,559
- It's your birthday today -
happy birthday!
- Thank you!

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,879
What are you... doing?

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,639
Another all-night vigil,
hoping for an e-mail from Ling.

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,359
Not one phone call, not a letter,

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,079
not a single e-mail
since I left China.

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,039
- Tea?
- Tea!
- Yeah.

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,399
Oh! Is there anything there for me?
Maybe from Shanghai, China?

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,719
- No, mate, just a couple of cards
for the birthday boy.
- Oh!

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,759
Have you seen my shoes?

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,079
- No. Not on this special morning!
- You know, my brown ones for work.

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,679
Special for SOMEONE, anyway.

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,639
Got a ton of meetings this morning
and I've hardly slept a wink. Oh!

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,439
There they are!
I'm going to be late back.

31
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,039
- I've sterilised Sid's bottles for you.
- What a lovely present(!)

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,639
It must be...

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,239
my birthday!
- See you all later.
- Bye!

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,999
Oh, Ken, I completely forgot.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,399
Car seat, in case you want
to go out.

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,119
- Check this out!
Gold lame birthday banner!
- Ho-ho!

37
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,559
- This is going to be
the best birthday ever!
- Right.

38
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,159
Tonight, we're going to party
like it's 99 Red Balloons.

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,119
- You've been listening to Lorna's
CD collection again?
- Yeah, I have.

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,279
- You want me to put one on?
- No! God, no!

41
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,959
Tonight is MY night.

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,679
As soon as Lorna is home,
we'll be having the holy trinity

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,479
of entertainment -

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,920
the quiz.

45
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,279
The curry!

46
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,319
And... the special anniversary
edition

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,599
of The Dambusters...
- ..Dambusters.

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,879
Tri... vial Pursuit...
What is this?

49
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,719
It's what people did in the '80s
when they didn't have television.

50
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,839
It's an incredible general knowledge
quiz. It's the ultimate test of...

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,040
Evening, Ken. Oh, fantastic(!)

52
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,959
- Where'd you want this?
- Not in my house? What is it?

53
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,279
Fresh batch of home-brew. Not
your birthday, eh? You old rogue!

54
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,079
You and me,
we're going to neck this

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,119
and lock horns
like two rutting stags.

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,319
- Who let you in?!
- Yes, Rachna, I'm on it.
I'll sort it out first thing.

57
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,319
Ah, good evening, darling!

58
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,999
- Steve?
- What?
- Thing is, this is a quiet occasion.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,159
- For me and my family.
- I am your family!

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,719
You and me are like brothers,

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,679
always ribbing each other,
busting each other's gonads...

62
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,359
- Sorry about that, love.
How was your day?
- Increasingly disappointing.

63
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,759
I know what you mean.
I've been rushed off my feet.

64
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,559
I've hardly had a chance to...

65
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,679
- ...wish you a happy birthday!
- Thanks, love!

66
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,359
- I'm so glad you didn't forget.
- I would never forget your birthday!

67
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,319
But if I did, with a new baby
and my current workload, it would

68
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,279
probably be forgivable.
- Would it?

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,679
I'll see to him. Don't you move!
Back in a sec, birthday boy.

70
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,199
Mwah!

71
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,599
Here we go...

72
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,160
Oh!

73
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,959
Match point.

74
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,719
Get this and we win.
Dale, do not blurt out the answer.

75
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,319
OK, I just really want to win!

76
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,559
I know, and if you think you know it,
and based on your past form,

77
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,799
that's highly unlikely -
then raise your hand.

78
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,240
Roger that.

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,279
- Right...
- What's...?

80
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,879
- Lichfield!
- Dale!

81
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,399
- I'm going to have to take
his first answer.
- Oh, come on!

82
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,839
- All right, last chance.
- What's this?

83
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,679
Is it a card for a certain special
someone? Happy birthday, gorgeous.

84
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,199
Thank you!

85
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,039
Ah.

86
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,319
Lorna, did you get this out of the
emergency card drawer in the bedroom?

87
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,519
What emergency card drawer
in the bedroom?

88
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,679
- "To Ken, congratulations,
you passed..."
- Read on.

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,480
"..The age of 47."

90
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,400
Thank you, love, it's perfect.

91
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,479
Do you know what would make
this game even more interesting?

92
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,999
A high-stakes wager.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,879
- Oh, no.
- Your humiliation is enough for me, Steve.

94
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,799
- I don't need to take
your money as well.
- I don't want your money, Ken.

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,560
I want your body.

96
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,719
Get this wrong
and you have to join my dojo.

97
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,399
The judo club?!

98
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,479
- I don't think so.
- Hm?

99
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,639
Blaaark, blaark, blaark!

100
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,039
Blaaark, blaark, blaark, blaark!
BLAAARK, BLAARK!

101
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,919
Go on, OK, if it'll shut you up,
I'll take your little bet.

102
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,479
If we get this wrong -
which is highly unlikely

103
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,159
because it's a blue pie,
and I am the maestro of the blue -

104
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,279
then I'll join your pathetic little dojo.
- And my hot tub club.
- No.

105
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,279
- All right.
- However, if-- WHEN--
we get this right, you will go home.

106
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,240
For ever.

107
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,480
Deal.

108
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,000
- Yes!
- Right, the bet is on!

109
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,679
- The question is...
- Yes?

110
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,400
- Nervous?
- No.

111
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,919
What animal comes after
a horse in the Chinese calendar?

112
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,559
Oh, bollocks!

113
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,599
Ha! I know this one, guys!

114
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,479
- You've said that every single time.
- I know, but I lived in China, Ken.

115
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,719
I know the language,
the culture,

116
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,599
I know when they put
the bins out - it's Thursday.

117
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,479
And more than that,
I know I can get this answer,

118
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,919
because it's linked to the most
incredible experience of my life.

119
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,519
'I was travelling
across the Far East

120
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,599
'and found myself
in the great city of Shanghai.

121
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,519
'I needed to get a job,

122
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,479
'so I spent my last few yuan
on a Teach Yourself Mandarin CD.'

123
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,759
'I tell you, the Chinese do not
like it when you ask for work.

124
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,879
'They get super upset.

125
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,559
'I was hungry and penniless.'

126
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,999
'But fate was about to...'

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,119
Fascinating as this is, Dale, can
you please just tell us an answer?!

128
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,879
I'm just about to, Chief Ken.

129
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,199
He's stalling,
thinking I'll give something away.

130
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,839
Well, he's wrong,
I can sit like this for hours.

131
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,879
Yeah, let's not put that to the test.
Quick as you can, please, Dale.

132
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,559
- We are on a tight schedule.
- Oh, shut up, Dad, I'm into this.

133
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,919
Because after this,
it's The Dambusters, so...

134
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,279
We would be playing Trivial Pursuit in
German if it wasn't for The Dambusters!

135
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,279
- You might like to think about that,
young lady.
- (Take your time, Dale.)

136
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,119
So, I was in my apartment,
when there was a knock at the door.

137
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,879
Whoa! Slow down, buddy!

138
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,879
'I guessed he made
a delivery to the wrong address.

139
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,279
'I decided to keep it safe
until he came back.

140
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,879
'Then I noticed something
really weird.

141
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,999
'Each duck had a bag of white
powder hidden inside.

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,359
'I didn't know what it was,
so I piled them neatly together

143
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,240
'and waited.

144
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,319
'And waited...

145
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,719
'And waited.

146
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,719
'I hadn't eaten a proper meal
in days.

147
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,279
'I didn't want the guy
to get in trouble,

148
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,559
'so I didn't touch a single duck.

149
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,959
'It was late and soon
I fell asleep.

150
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,439
'When I woke up...
they were in my room!'

151
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,399
- 'I didn't catch all
of what they were saying,

152
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,599
'but it was something to do
with money and laundering.

153
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,919
'That's when I realised,
duck is so messy to eat that they

154
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,439
'included washing powder,
so people could launder
their tablecloths after.'

155
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,039
- Washing powder!
- Yeah! Considerate, right?

156
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,439
The laundry guys were so pleased
I didn't touch their merchandise,

157
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,639
they asked if I was interested
in a career in business.

158
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,959
'The next night, their boss came
around to meet me. This was Mr Xi.

159
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,319
- 'A gangster?
- Yes, Chief Ken.

160
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,120
'Although there was no way
to tell that at the time.

161
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,119
'And behind Mr Xi,
there she was, his daughter...

162
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,640
'Ling.'

163
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,679
'She was without doubt the most
beautiful girl I had ever seen.

164
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,919
'Not just beautiful,
but mysterious and amazing...'

165
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,959
You know what, Dad's right - maybe
you could just skip this stuff.

166
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,719
- Oh, but Ling is the reason
I know the answer.
- Oh.

167
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,159
- Well, Ling and the chicken.
- The chicken?

168
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,159
Is that the answer,
the year of the chicken?

169
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,079
Wrong! I win! Yes! Come on!

170
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,959
- That was not an answer,
I was conferring with Dale.
- Yeah!

171
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,559
It's not the year of the chicken.

172
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,159
Actually the chicken is
kind of a surprise in the story.

173
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,639
- Forget I mentioned the chicken.
- Just get on with it!

174
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,479
So I'll just skip all
the stuff at Ling being

175
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,519
so beautiful
I forgot how to breathe?

176
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,320
I mean...

177
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,119
First time I saw Connie was
at a debate on capital punishment.

178
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,119
I was, er, pro-electric chair and
she was - typical Connie, really -

179
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,639
pro-hanging.

180
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,919
We compromised on lethal injection.

181
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,200
Life was... much simpler then.

182
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,160
Fuckin' hell.

183
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,000
Anyways, um,
so Mr Xi had come to offer me a job.

184
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,319
'Before I could join their family
business, I had to pass a test.

185
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,319
'They placed a strange
object on the table.

186
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,039
- 'It looked like a cage, but what
animal could be inside?
- A chicken?

187
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,559
'It was a chick...
Oh, gosh darn it, Dale!

188
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,119
'Anyways, I wasn't sure
what I was supposed to do.

189
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,800
'All I knew was that the chicken
was super sacred to them.'

190
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,760
I got it.

191
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,639
Hi, Mr Chicken! Are you thirsty?
I got you water!

192
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,680
'This did not go down well.

193
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,599
What?

194
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,800
This?

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,520
- I got this about three years ago
when I was part of a cult.

196
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,719
I thought it was all above board,

197
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,159
but it turns out it was quite
a dangerous organisation.

198
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,119
Can you imagine?

199
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,279
'It turned out the Chinese
really love triangles!

200
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,039
'Super lucky, huh?

201
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,080
'But what happens next
was even more incredible.'

202
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,479
I'm going for a slash. That
home-brew has gone right through me.

203
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,279
- And you won't be needing this.
- Not going to cheat, Steve!

204
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,440
Not now you're not.

205
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,119
Right, I'm going to Google the
answers so we can get rid of him.

206
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,879
- Relax, Chief Ken, I got this!
- Yes. But just in case,
where's my phone.

207
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,440
I've got that too.

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,559
- Who wants a beer?
- Yeah, go on.
- That would be nice, actually.

209
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,199
Maybe with a slice of birthday cake.

210
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,679
Did you... get a cake?

211
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,919
Tsk!

212
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,800
Ken, I am on it!

213
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,319
- Ken?
- What?!
- Is your phone waterproof?

214
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,200
Oh, God...

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,839
Are you all right, Mum?

216
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,959
I hid some Jaffa Cakes somewhere
when I was pregnant.

217
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,719
- Maybe if I stick a candle
in one of them.
- I dunno, maybe.

218
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,559
- Oh, Rach, have I become
one of those high-powered

219
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,839
career women that
puts their job before their family?

220
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,720
You know what, I think you're OK.

221
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,639
Work's mad. And I'm getting out
of sync with your dad. And Sid.

222
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,719
And you. I mean, how are you,
Rach? How's your job with Nina?

223
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,039
Well, Nina's mental, obviously.

224
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,799
I think, if I could change one
thing, though, it would be Dale

225
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,559
constantly going on about his
passionate love for another woman.

226
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,599
I wouldn't worry too much
about that. I mean...

227
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,119
- Dale punched that bloke Freddie,
didn't he?
- Mm.

228
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,319
- He's obviously got feelings
for you deep down.
- Annoyingly deep down.

229
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,639
Look... you're here, she's not.
It's like property, isn't it?

230
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,479
She's not taken possession.
You're squatting on her man.

231
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,959
And if you hang on long enough...

232
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,240
I'll get to squat on him for ever.

233
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,679
- Mum... that's such a bad metaphor.
- Yeah, eugh!

234
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,999
A decent phone should be waterproof
up to 50 metres.

235
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,719
- Turn it off!
- What?

236
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,240
- Should I continue my story now?
- Oh, God, yes!
- OK.

237
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,679
'So Mr Xi had seen
my triangle tattoo

238
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,679
'and he took this
as a sign of good luck.

239
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,400
'He decided to give me another
chance to join the family business.

240
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,239
'There was a long red scar
going right across his chest.

241
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,839
'Mr Xi pointed to the scar
and said...'

242
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,080
How... did I... get this?

243
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,360
'I looked at the others,
but they were giving nothing away.'

244
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,079
So Mr Xi said I had 20 questions
to guess how he got his scar.

245
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,679
Get it right and he'd let me

246
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,199
join his close-knit
community of businessmen.

247
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,679
Get it wrong, he'd remove my skin.

248
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,559
Dale! What were you thinking??

249
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,879
- I was thinking, if I'm going to be a
businessman, I should probably buy a suit.
- Mm. Yes. Mm.

250
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,000
Lorn, can you see to him?

251
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,720
I'll be right back.

252
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,240
Time for a refill.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,399
So, Ling was in the room,
but she was ignoring you.

254
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,279
Yeah, but it just made her
that much more mysterious.

255
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,279
Mysterious slash unhelpful.

256
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,199
- Unhelpful?
- Yeah.
- Ling?

257
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,999
Yeah, I guess you
don't really know Ling

258
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,079
or you would understand
how funny that is!

259
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,999
But, yeah, when I go back to China,
you should totally come meet her.

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,559
Yeah, are you going back?

261
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,639
I mean, have you heard from her yet?

262
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,799
Not... Not yet.

263
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,039
But I guess the post
is kind of slow from China.

264
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,599
- She could phone or e-mail,
couldn't she?
- Yeah, she will.

265
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,519
Just when the timing's right,
you know?

266
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,959
Dale, I don't...

267
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,199
Guess how I got my scar.

268
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,000
Steve! I've no idea.

269
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,039
Little bugger won't settle.

270
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,719
I'll take him.

271
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,879
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh!

272
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,399
Right, what did I miss?

273
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,599
I'm just trying to guess
how Steve got his scar.

274
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,599
Oh, God. Put your shirt back on.

275
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,319
It was a mole. I removed it myself.

276
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,159
Bloody agony.

277
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,639
So, come on.

278
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,880
- How did it end?
- Oh.

279
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,200
So, I had 20 questions to guess
how Mr Xi got the scar.

280
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,160
I sat cross-legged on the floor
as Ling served us green tea.

281
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,679
Mr Xi was super fussy about his tea

282
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,799
and would only drink it when it was
two degrees off boiling point.

283
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,200
Argh!

284
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,399
Only then could I ask a question

285
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,679
and try to solve the riddle
of the scar.

286
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,719
I was only allowed
one question per night,

287
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,879
which, at first,
I found very difficult.

288
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,480
Do you want any milk with your tea?

289
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,360
Did you get it in a fight?

290
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,640
Did you have an operation?

291
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,600
Are you sure you didn't want
any milk with your tea?

292
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,800
Argh!

293
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,639
From that night on, seeing her
became the highlight of my day.

294
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,679
I started delaying
asking the question

295
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,720
so I could be around her for longer.

296
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,360
Night by night, I turned the whole
thing into an elaborate show.

297
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,079
They seemed to like it,

298
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,840
especially Ling,
who would clap and laugh.

299
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,559
But, all too soon, the time would
come to ask the question

300
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,239
and, all too soon, I'd get it wrong.

301
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,720
Did you work in a circus?

302
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,319
Has anybody got a towel?

303
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,679
Lorn, where have you been?

304
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,839
- Tesco.
- Tesco? It's a force-ten gale outside.

305
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,439
I know, but look! A cake!

306
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,639
- Oh.
- I mean, it's a bit weather-beaten, but...

307
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,999
I think I can put this
back together.

308
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,679
Bloody seal's jammed again.

309
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,759
Seem to have run out of nappies.

310
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,679
Oh, yeah. Don't worry, Chief Ken.
I'll have this together in no time.

311
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,319
- Come on!
- We could still put
some meringues on it!

312
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,919
I can't seem to find any. Mum!

313
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,799
Don't you worry, Chief Ken. I'll
have this cake together in no time.

314
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,639
I know we've got some candles
somewhere.

315
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,879
Come on!

316
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,919
Right! That's it!

317
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,000
My birthday is now officially over.

318
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,240
Oh.

319
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,519
Just confirming that a refusal
to answer counts as a wrong answer,

320
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,399
in which case I win the bet.

321
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,679
Go away.

322
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,919
You're not serious.

323
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,999
It's no way to treat your best mate.

324
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,279
Come on, Steve.

325
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,600
You're not my best mate.
You never were.

326
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,239
Wow.

327
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,079
That... Wow.

328
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,560
I didn't see that coming.

329
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,919
I can handle Connie leaving me

330
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,439
again.

331
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,319
I can accept my kids not wanting
to take my calls.

332
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,879
I can even deal

333
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
with my sensei blanking me...

334
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,759
...in Lidl.

335
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,120
But this...

336
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,439
- Look, let's just go home.
- Hold me!

337
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,839
- Get off me!
- I've had no physical
intimacy since Connie left me again.

338
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,719
I need to be held.

339
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,719
Ooh. Oh.

340
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,640
Oh. Oh.

341
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,719
We're still best mates, aren't we?

342
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,200
Uh-huh.

343
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,199
He's coming. He's coming.

344
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,519
Everybody!

345
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,519
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow

346
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,239
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow

347
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,319
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow

348
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,359
♪ And so say all of us! ♪

349
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,119
Make a wish!

350
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,159
OK.

351
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,919
I wish that you would
finish your story

352
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,320
so that I can get to bed.

353
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,879
You got it, birthday boy.

354
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,440
And so it all hinges
on the last night.

355
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,759
I'd used up all my goes

356
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,240
and now Mr Xi needed a final answer.

357
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,119
Guess correctly and I'd join
the family business.

358
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,000
Guess wrong and I would have to make
my way in life with no head.

359
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,719
I had no clue what to say

360
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,000
and I racked my brain
for inspiration.

361
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,360
What could cause a scar like that?

362
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,759
I'd heard him say he'd grown up
by the sea

363
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,240
and that he would often
go swimming there.

364
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,000
You answer now.

365
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,079
She mouthed the words "Stin ree,"

366
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,000
which I think means "Good luck."

367
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,319
Yes! Yeah, all right.

368
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,920
I'm ready to give my answer.

369
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,039
It has something to do

370
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,120
with the ocean.

371
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,080
Something very dangerous.

372
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,640
You...

373
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,040
...got your scar...

374
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,280
...waterskiing!

375
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,040
Yeah.

376
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,559
I'd guessed correctly

377
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,759
and Mr Xi was as good as his word.

378
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,679
The next day, I was officially
welcomed into the family

379
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,320
and made a delivery boy.

380
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,159
So I learned a valuable lesson
that day.

381
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,039
In fact, I learned 12 of them
which I will now explain.

382
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,679
- First lesson...
- No.

383
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,079
Enough is enough.

384
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,279
Steve, ask the question.

385
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,919
Here we go. Get this right
and you win the bet.

386
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,999
Get this wrong and the Lichfield
Mixed Martial Arts Centre

387
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,159
gets a 6'8" white belt
with a heart of gold.

388
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,799
Just get on with it.

389
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,920
OK, so, what animal comes after
the horse in the Chinese calendar?

390
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,560
The monkey!

391
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,319
It's wrong.

392
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,199
It's... It's the goat.

393
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,599
- What?
- The goat!

394
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,799
How about that! It's the goat!

395
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,519
- So what was the point of that story?
- There was a moral, Chief Ken.

396
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,399
Did not see it?

397
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,800
Sometimes, you've just got to guess.

398
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,039
Well, thank you, Confucius!

399
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,919
So judo is Tuesdays and Thursday
night in the Scout hut.

400
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,199
Thursdays is full contact,
so you have to pad up.

401
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,439
- Go home.
- Before that,
I'm going to have to come round

402
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,519
and just test your reactions.

403
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,359
Just really to see what kind of
fighting skills you have.

404
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,799
I'm sensing probably
quite a low level,

405
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,480
but, don't worry,
I'll take you through it.

406
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,879
I've got something for you.

407
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,119
It's not curry, is it?

408
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,440
Not this time of night,
you great trougher!

409
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,519
Lorn! An evening with Simon Schama!

410
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,119
It's in London next month.

411
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,320
I thought we could
make a weekend of it.

412
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,800
Thank you.

413
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,959
Oh. So no Dambusters, then?

414
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,999
Yeah. Survived the Nazis,
killed by a bellend.

415
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,519
Guess what, guys! I got a surprise!

416
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,919
I felt really bad about earlier,
so I got another cake.

417
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,679
Also, the guy in the shop said,
if we're having a party,

418
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,919
we could use some of these things.
- Whoo!

419
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,119
That's really nice, Dale,

420
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,199
but I think we should all
probably head to bed.

421
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,440
- Dad!
- Oh, Ken.

422
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,640
What sort of cake is it?

423
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,000
- White chocolate.
- Good.
- I'll get some plates.

424
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,239
What?

425
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,999
I don't know. It's just...

426
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,479
My whole life, I've been a part of
different families,

427
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,639
each with their own way
of doing things.

428
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,319
Vashradi told us to intercourse
with aliens,

429
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,399
Mr Xi chopped peoples' tongues off
for telling lies,

430
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,759
and you like your dishwasher
on economy cycle.

431
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,039
It's hard to tell
who's got it right.

432
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,879
I do know this -

433
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,959
the only place I've ever felt
at home

434
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,759
is right here.

435
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,119
Well, It's very sweet, Dale,

436
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,559
but I am British,
so take it down a notch.

437
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,799
You've really been like a dad to me,
Chief Ken.

438
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,439
Maybe a notch more.

439
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,920
I'm going to miss you
when I go back to China.

440
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,479
- No. Not that.
- OK.

441
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,600
She did get me a curry!

442
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,759
Ah!

443
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,560
- Argh!
- Argh!
