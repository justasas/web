1
00:00:02,436 --> 00:00:04,237
What are you doing?

2
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:06,406
Uh, as you know, we've been
studying American History,

3
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:09,108
and that's why I'm so proud
to introduce you

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,078
to a very special
and patriotic guest--

5
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,346
Why are you talking
from the other room?

6
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,916
- Not a real drum.
- The 35th President,

7
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:21,521
John F. Kennedy!
Kennedy! Kennedy!

8
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,789
Hello, Gene.

9
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,524
I'm here to tell you all about

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:28,261
a very tumultuous time
in our country's history,

11
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:30,096
the 1960s.

12
00:00:30,097 --> 00:00:31,431
Didn't you get shot in the head?

13
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,800
That's right.
Very impressive, Gene.

14
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:34,968
I did get shot in the head.

15
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,436
But how do you know that?

16
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:38,371
What do you mean?
I--

17
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,973
'Cause your brain bits would
be all over your lap and stuff.

18
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:42,108
I read the paper the next day,
and I saw that I--

19
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,677
Oh, so you're a ghost that reads?

20
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,279
No, I...
no, I--

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,114
Oh, you're Kevin Costner?
Playing JFK?

22
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,515
- He played a detective--
- Oh, I never saw it.

23
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,551
That was researching
the assassination.

24
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,286
I never watched it.
It looked boring.

25
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,121
How do you not know
anything about anything,

26
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,890
but you know everything about JFK?

27
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,524
So you are Billie!

28
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,525
- I called it.
- No, I--

29
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:00,927
I knew it when you walked in.

30
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,961
I was like,
"That's Billie."

31
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,563
I had a whole thing planned,

32
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,965
and I would do my--was
working on my accent.

33
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,433
Yeah, it's good.
It's a horrible accent.

34
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,035
- No--
- Keep doing it.

35
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,571
Okay, um,
"But because of that conflict" --

36
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,273
Are you saying "corn-flict?"

37
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,541
- Conflict.
- Oh, conflict.

38
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,409
- "And upheaval."
- Upheaval.

39
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,945
"Of the time,
we are now closer than ever

40
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:21,715
to being
an equal opportunity society."

41
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:26,085
If we're an
equal opportunity society,

42
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,555
why haven't I been served
my lemonade yet?

43
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,391
Hmm?
Think about that.

44
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,092
♪ We're too gangsta for TV

45
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,061
<i>♪ That's why
you don't see us ♪</i>

46
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,796
<i>♪ But they still
wanna be us ♪</i>

47
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,866
<i>Ha ha!</i>

48
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,237
Ugh, too mushy.

49
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:47,073
Too hard.

50
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,575
Oh, just right.

51
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,076
That's good.

52
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,578
You just said that one was good.

53
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,580
Yeah, I don't care
for peaches personally.

54
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,081
Gene, you're being a brat.

55
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,016
You're just making a mess
for Joy to clean up.

56
00:01:57,017 --> 00:01:58,918
Joy doesn't clean those up.
Do you, Joy?

57
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,086
- Sí.
- See?

58
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,321
"Sí" means yes.

59
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,555
You're a saint, by the way, Joy,

60
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:03,590
to put up with this.

61
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,358
- Kiss-ass.
- Right?

62
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,759
You totally deserve a raise
for putting up with that.

63
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,995
You were just
throwing peaches on the ground.

64
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:12,365
Oh my god, you're obsessed
with the peaches right now.

65
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,766
Okay?
We've moved on

66
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,102
to Joy.

67
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,770
- Selfish.
- Uh-huh.

68
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,539
You do deserve a raise, though.
I agree.

69
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,074
Mr. Russell
doesn't give raises.

70
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,110
I do get to keep
Gene's hand-me-downs.

71
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,247
Okay, I'm sorry, that's crazy

72
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:28,514
that you've never gotten a raise.

73
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:29,782
Yeah, she's right.

74
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,050
You need to get you
some paper, son.

75
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:32,785
You know what?
Go in, make your case.

76
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,922
- He'll go for it.
- Oh, I know what you should do.

77
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,257
- She's gotta "Shark Tank" it.
- Mm-hmm.

78
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,591
- What is Sharks--
- "Shark Tank" it!

79
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:40,526
- Okay!
- "Hi, Mark Cuban,

80
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,095
can I have some money?"

81
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,529
That's such a good impression,
"Shark Tank" it!

82
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,809
Oh.
Hey, Joy.

83
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,612
I don't think the trash
is too full,

84
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:02,015
but I am glad you are here.

85
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,350
I want to talk to you
about the menu

86
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,052
for the big dinner party
this weekend.

87
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,987
- Mr. Kent.
- Hmm.

88
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,223
I've been with this family
for a very long time now.

89
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,392
And I do whatever is asked of me.

90
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:15,962
That's why I'm here to ask
for a 10% raise

91
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:19,165
in a 100% stake
for the rest of my job.

92
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,568
What's happening right now?

93
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,902
Are you "Shark Tanking" me?

94
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,871
I can't take anything
less than 10%.

95
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:28,374
You are "Shark Tanking" me.

96
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,077
Joy, you know I don't give raises,

97
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:33,346
and yet here you are
asking for one.

98
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,848
And for that reason...

99
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,650
I'm out.

100
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:38,885
What do you mean?

101
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,153
I saw this cool movie last night.

102
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:41,421
- Yeah.
- Have you seen "Forrest Gump?"

103
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,789
Everyone's seen
"Forrest Gump."

104
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,890
I don't think so.

105
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,558
What do you think
"Run, Forrest" --

106
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,260
Joy, what's wrong?

107
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,896
I listened to your
stupid advice and I got fired.

108
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,331
He fired you.

109
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,399
- Who's gonna brush my hair?
- Gene!

110
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,002
I'm so sorry, Joy, I feel
like this is partially my fault.

111
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:58,605
Partially?

112
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,240
This is all your fault.

113
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,942
You think you're so smart
because of your books

114
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:05,245
and your degrees and your maxi pad

115
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,513
you left in your underwear
that I had to throw out

116
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,015
before I washed them?

117
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:10,850
I can assure you, I did not know

118
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,752
about the last thing until now.

119
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,756
Goodbye, ladies.

120
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:21,261
- I feel so bad.
- You should feel bad.

121
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:24,931
That's disgusting.
I mean, I'm grossed out. Me.

122
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,633
- About Joy.
- Oh, right.

123
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,635
I can't believe he fired her.
I mean, you can't just

124
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:30,303
throw people away like trash.

125
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,105
Yeah, you should leave 'em
in your underwear

126
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,038
for the maid to find.

127
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,141
Hey, Joy.
Um, it's me.

128
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,676
Your phone's doing that thing
where it rings once

129
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,712
and goes right to
voice-mail--which is cool.

130
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,213
Totally cool.
I wanted to say how much

131
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,582
<i>I really hate you--
- Message complete.</i>

132
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,850
Not being here!

133
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,353
I hate you not being here!

134
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,154
- God.
- Oh, Billie.

135
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,990
Yikes, first you get her fired,

136
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:51,858
now you're leaving her
hate messages?

137
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:55,328
I didn't get her fired.
Your dad is being ridiculous.

138
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:57,230
Well, we were a part of that too.

139
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:58,765
Damn it.

140
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:01,601
No--no, no!

141
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,437
How am I supposed to eat
with no Joy?

142
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,906
- That's it.
- What?

143
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:08,842
That's it!
We'll go on a hunger strike.

144
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:11,077
Huh?
Action through peaceful protest,

145
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:14,481
like our brothers and sisters
of the '60s, baby!

146
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:18,485
Yes, I am so in.

147
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:20,086
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

148
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,756
Except, I believe
it's called a "hunger stroke."

149
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,824
- It isn't.
- You wanna look it up?

150
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,760
- You're still eating.
- Oh, right.

151
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:29,129
Spit it out.

152
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,698
Don't put that in your mouth.

153
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,266
Oh, my gosh, Joy's back!

154
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:34,968
I never looked away.

155
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:37,470
Well, say what you will about Joy,

156
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,639
but she made a mean eggplant.

157
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,475
You can't plant eggs.

158
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:47,047
Well, you probably noticed that
Gene and I aren't eating,

159
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:49,149
and I'm sure you're wondering why.

160
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,351
- I actually hadn't.
- We're on hunger strike.

161
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:53,320
Not a hunger stroke,
though it's totally normal

162
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:54,988
if you thought it was called that.

163
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:57,524
And we're not going to eat
until you hire Joy back.

164
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,059
Gene's eating right now.

165
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,660
I need it, I need it!

166
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,263
Look ladies, do you know why
a shark has no memory?

167
00:06:03,264 --> 00:06:05,131
- Bad childhood?
- No.

168
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:08,034
A true predator never looks back.

169
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,636
I don't know if that's factual.

170
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:10,937
Word is "actual."

171
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,139
You can even
not eat as much as you like,

172
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,876
but I'm not budging.
How does that strike you?

173
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,745
It strikes me like lightning.

174
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:19,913
As in, never.

175
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:21,214
Which is how much I'm gonna eat,

176
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,649
and this one's gonna eat,

177
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,452
until Joy gets back in here.

178
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:27,087
Using her maid legs!

179
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:28,255
Get him, Billie!

180
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:31,925
And...
that's a... fact.

181
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:33,543
Oh, Billie, you're awful at this.

182
00:06:33,785 --> 00:06:35,795
Hope for domestic rights!

183
00:06:35,797 --> 00:06:37,764
Hope for domestic workers!

184
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,299
Hope for freedom--
- Stop yelling!

185
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,001
Who are you talking to?

186
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,303
Sorry, I'm just cranky
'cause this protest sucks.

187
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:45,205
There's no people here
but us and New Chet.

188
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:48,976
Yeah, man, and this sign stick
is giving me hella splinters.

189
00:06:48,977 --> 00:06:51,712
You guys, don't worry.
This is how all movements start.

190
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:54,281
Plus, I called my old college
buddies from Baked Earth.

191
00:06:54,282 --> 00:06:55,816
They will make it happen.

192
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:57,718
Your buddies sound like
hippies. I hate hippies.

193
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:00,487
They are a conscious
collective of peace warriors.

194
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:02,189
Oh--oh, great.

195
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,490
Here comes another protestor.

196
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,359
See?
It's already working.

197
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,294
Oh, and she went all out,
wearing a sexy maid's uniform.

198
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:09,563
- Ah!
- Stop it.

199
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:12,366
- Hello, I'm the new maid, Hope.
- Maid?

200
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:13,901
- Drop--drop, drop!
- What?

201
00:07:13,902 --> 00:07:15,302
- What do we do?
- Come on, lock paws.

202
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:17,404
- Form a wall of resistance.
- Hey, hey.

203
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:19,006
Baby girl, you want
to get in there?

204
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:20,974
- You gots to get by us.
- Yeah.

205
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,643
Yeah, and we're gonna eat your ass

206
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:24,511
- Uh-uh.
- Beat your ass!

207
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:26,747
I'm sorry, I haven't eaten.
It's very difficult for me.

208
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:28,515
- I could make you something.
- Oh, yeah--

209
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:29,750
- She doesn't want it.
- I would love a grilled cheese.

210
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:31,118
- Or like--
- War on hunger--

211
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,719
Oh, there you are.
Come on in.

212
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,088
Big dinner party tonight.
Lots of things to do.

213
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,990
Excuse me.

214
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:38,692
Just because you hired
someone knew does not mean

215
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:40,594
you will break our spirit,
Mr. Russell.

216
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:42,496
- Gene's eating again.
- Don't!

217
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:43,931
Scab!

218
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:47,935
Can I talk to you for a minute?

219
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:49,503
Oh, yeah, sure.
What's on your mind?

220
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:51,438
No!

221
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,440
- Hey. Look at me.
- Huh.

222
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:54,842
I don't know
where this came from--

223
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:56,944
- My pocket.
- But you do not throw food

224
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,079
or beat ass
in a non-violent movement.

225
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,982
- Violence is not the answer.
- Violence is always the answer!

226
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,518
- Always!
- Okay, I--look, I am just

227
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,087
gonna go talk to her,
tell her whazzup.

228
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:08,822
What?
Why are you saying that to me?

229
00:08:08,823 --> 00:08:11,124
Oh, like "What's going on,"
I didn't mean to,

230
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,993
like, do it, like...

231
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:15,162
- Billie,
- Wha--once she sees

232
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:16,497
what we're doing--
- Mm-hmm.

233
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:18,932
She will stand
in solidarity with us.

234
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,436
Hey, give me some ski--

235
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:24,471
She's the most racist
person I know.

236
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:26,140
Oh, is that fajitas?

237
00:08:26,141 --> 00:08:27,975
Yeah, you want some?
You look hungry.

238
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:29,743
I--I am,
but I can't.

239
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:32,079
That's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

240
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,714
You see, Gene--
- The one who threw

241
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:35,415
the pizza at me?
- Yeah, sorry about that.

242
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,051
She's like, a child.

243
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:41,755
Um, the thing is,
the last maid got fired.

244
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:43,257
- Oh.
- And it was, like,

245
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:47,728
totally unjustified,
so we're actually not eating

246
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:49,363
until Kent hires her back again.

247
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:52,432
So, it would actually
really help us out

248
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:55,269
if you would just, like, quit.

249
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:58,906
- Are you crazy?
- Leave.

250
00:08:58,907 --> 00:09:01,208
- Why don't you quit?
- Oh, me?

251
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:04,044
No, no, what I do is
a lot more specialized.

252
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:05,712
Not that you're not special.

253
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,781
I mean, I think
you're probably really special.

254
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:10,050
Not in a like,
"Oh, she's so special,

255
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:11,785
get her a slice of cake"
sort of way,

256
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:12,786
I don't know,
you know what I mean.

257
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:17,090
Did you just call me a--
a "white puta?"

258
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:20,160
- No.
- All right, good first talk.

259
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:21,161
- Yeah.
- Hopefully the first of many.

260
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:22,930
Hope!

261
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:24,431
What a lot of people don't
know, though, is Malcolm X

262
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:26,567
started the Black Panthers
because he was

263
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:27,935
a "Pink Panther" fan.

264
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:29,436
- Oh, really.
- Yeah.

265
00:09:29,437 --> 00:09:31,405
Who doesn't love Peter O'Toole?

266
00:09:31,406 --> 00:09:34,074
- Why doesn't this work?
- Where'd you get that knife?

267
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,776
- Sponcer's Gifts?
- Hmm.

268
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:37,744
- Gene!
- Oh, what? I didn't...

269
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,580
- How'd it go?
- She's not quitting.

270
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:41,515
Oh. Okay, well, then,
let's do this, you know?

271
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:43,784
- Come on, don't give up.
- We're not doing

272
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:45,853
the peaceful protest crap
anymore, Billie, okay?

273
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:47,688
It didn't work!
My dad doesn't care.

274
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:50,090
So unless you have a better idea,

275
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,259
viva la pizza.
- Is it good?

276
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,496
So good.
You should taste how it tastes.

277
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:57,464
Oh, , hippies.
New Chet, get the crossbow.

278
00:09:57,465 --> 00:09:59,133
Oh, no, no, no.
They're not hippies.

279
00:09:59,134 --> 00:10:01,001
They're from Baked Earth.
They're here to help.

280
00:10:01,002 --> 00:10:03,971
Hi, thank you for your presence.

281
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:05,506
Namaste.

282
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:07,941
These are some
ugly-ass chicks.

283
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:15,616
♪

284
00:10:15,617 --> 00:10:17,718
Hi, everyone.
Thank you all for coming

285
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:20,821
to this peaceful demonstration
for our sister Joy.

286
00:10:20,822 --> 00:10:23,524
We need to educate people about

287
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:24,892
workers' rights for a fair wage.

288
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:26,794
- We can't hear you!
- Yeah!

289
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:28,629
Uh, human megaphone everybody!

290
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,030
Really?
It's pretty quiet out.

291
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:32,032
Really?
It's pretty quiet out!

292
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,568
Seriously, I'm pretty sure
you can all hear me just fine.

293
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:37,871
Seriously, I'm pretty sure
you can all hear me just fine.

294
00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:39,139
Logically, if you're repeating

295
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,808
everything I say, you can hear me.

296
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:42,242
Logically,
if you're repeating

297
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:43,977
everything I say, you can hear me.

298
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:48,715
- Oh, I'm from England!
- Oh, I'm from England!

299
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:50,551
This is so stupid.
I hate these people.

300
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:52,820
This is so stupid.
I hate these people.

301
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:55,823
- Ow, you're hurting my arm--
- Quit being such a baby!

302
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:57,391
This is a disaster.

303
00:10:57,392 --> 00:10:58,959
Those people out there smell
like BO and cashews!

304
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,261
I love cashews.
They're the elite nut.

305
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:02,830
Listen to me.
I get it now.

306
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:05,699
Joy is a real person.
She deserves a real protest.

307
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,501
But those people
out there--those hippies?

308
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:08,936
They don't care about
getting Joy back.

309
00:11:08,937 --> 00:11:11,104
I heard one of them go,
"Who's Joy?"

310
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:14,107
That's how they talk, Billie!
That's how they talk naturally.

311
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:16,944
Those people are just here
to crash between Phish concerts.

312
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:18,445
What the hell's a fish concert?

313
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:20,414
Like, a bunch of fish
playing instruments?

314
00:11:20,415 --> 00:11:22,015
Is that really your first guess?

315
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,350
No, you're right.
That's crazy.

316
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:25,619
It's gotta be, like,
a bunch of people

317
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,589
using fish to play instruments.
Yum.

318
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,824
Yum, fish!
I'm Billie!

319
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:31,892
That's all I think about, is food.

320
00:11:31,893 --> 00:11:33,727
Look at me!
Ahh!

321
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:35,162
That's 'cause I'm actually
doing the hunger strike.

322
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:36,997
Me, too!
What do you think I'm doing?

323
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:38,499
Do you know how many calories
I've had today?

324
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,766
- How many?
- 5,000!

325
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,435
Who are you, Michael Phelps?
Gross.

326
00:11:41,436 --> 00:11:43,837
I need to eat.
I'm growing, Billie.

327
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:46,006
- No, you're not growing.
- Yes, I am!

328
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,941
I hope you have nightmares.
Indian nightmares.

329
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:50,077
Oh, no, no!
Oh!

330
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:51,879
<i>- Attention!
- Attention, circus folk.</i>

331
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,280
- Your head's a tennis ball.
- What?

332
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:57,351
You are all trespassing,
and my lawn

333
00:11:57,352 --> 00:12:00,120
smells like dirty cashews.
- I told you.

334
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:02,923
Mr. Russell,
we're not going anywhere

335
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:04,424
until you hire Joy back.

336
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:07,895
- What do we want?
- Free O.J. Simpson!

337
00:12:07,896 --> 00:12:10,030
- When do we want it?
- Now!

338
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:12,032
My dinner guests are
going to be arriving soon.

339
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,134
I don't want them accosted
by a bunch of

340
00:12:14,135 --> 00:12:16,270
shower-phobic vegans.

341
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,105
You can end this whenever
you want, Mr. Russell.

342
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:19,740
You just have to do
the right thing.

343
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:21,342
Have it your way.

344
00:12:25,446 --> 00:12:29,283
No!

353
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,534
What's the password?

354
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,303
The password?

355
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,672
- You got it.
- The password is "password"?

356
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:30,375
Yeah, but see the S's are fives.

357
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:34,713
Welcome to the revolution.

358
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,388
She's here.

359
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,224
Oh. Hey, Billie.

360
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,794
- You've awakened.
- What is going on?

361
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,396
Your tactics didn't work.
You lost.

362
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,666
The only thing my dad
responds to... is strength.

363
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,804
It's time to fight fire
with flamier fire.

364
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,573
Gene, I don't know
what you're planning to do,

365
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,609
but I know it is a bad idea.

366
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,478
You know, my bad idea
was letting you be in charge

367
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,913
in the first place.

368
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,482
You were never willing
to do what it takes.

369
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:13,051
You were never willing
to go all the way.

370
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,287
You thought a hunger strike
was called a "hunger stroke."

371
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,556
Yeah, and we may never know
who was right on that one.

372
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,791
- It's me. I'm 100%.
- Well, perhaps.

373
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,261
It's that arrogance that makes
you such a weak leader.

374
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:25,497
This is crazy.
Joy would not want any of this.

375
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:29,568
Why don't you let
Joy tell you what Joy wants?

376
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,403
Who else is in this room?

377
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,805
Gene's plan might be crazy
enough to work...

378
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,974
white puta.
- I'm sorry...

379
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,410
I haven't eaten in 36 hours.

380
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,512
Did you just call me a white puta?

381
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:44,182
No. I said viva la revolución,
white puta.

382
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,184
You definitely said it that time.

383
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,120
- Yeah, time you did.
- I did.

384
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,022
What are you planning to do?

385
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,258
Let's just say tonight's
turkey is gonna be da bomb.

386
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,764
No. No!

387
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,333
This is a non-violent
movement!

388
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,202
Make love, not war!

389
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,773
- The five dollar foot long!
- Hey, everyone, stop.

390
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,776
- What?
- I-I don't know.

391
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:12,678
I'm feeling a little lightheaded.

392
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,046
I--uh-oh.

393
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:15,614
I think I'm gonna pass out again.

394
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:18,684
- Billie, you're fine.
- I'm passing out.

395
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,587
That would be, like,

396
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,023
a bunch of people using fish
to play instruments.

397
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,594
Is that fajitas?
I haven't eaten in 36 hours.

398
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,363
"Yum, fish!"
There's gonna be meat.

399
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:35,734
So, unless you have
a better idea, viva la pizza.

400
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:39,905
Imagine all the pizza.
Imagine.

401
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,640
Konichiwa.

402
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,209
What's going on?
Gene, what are you doing?

403
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,514
You were never willing
to go all the way.

404
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,084
Words.

405
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,520
The S's are fives!

406
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,723
- Ha ha ha ha ha.
- You understand it?

407
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,325
It's a gun.
For violence.

408
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,160
No.

409
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:08,083
What are you going to do?

410
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:11,754
Let's just say
the turkey's gonna be the bomb.

411
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:14,089
The turkey will be the bomb.
The turkey will be the bomb.

412
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,291
The turkey will be--

413
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:18,060
The turkey's a bomb!

414
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:22,631
And to Mr. Sasaki for coming
all the way from Kyoto.

415
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:25,267
Cheers.

416
00:16:25,268 --> 00:16:27,903
I have a very important message

417
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,072
I want to share with you
for the future.

418
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,909
- You're all gonna die!
- Jesus Christ, Billie.

419
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,078
- What's this about?
- Get out! Get out!

420
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,349
This thing's gonna blow!
Oh oh oh!

421
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,488
That's so good.
It's so moist.

422
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:49,358
Billie,
what the hell are you doing?

423
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:51,760
You.

424
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,096
You wouldn't listen.
You radicalized Gene.

425
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,365
Because
you're so hard-headed,

426
00:16:56,366 --> 00:17:00,369
- Gene put a bomb in the turkey!
- Where?

427
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,404
- Huh?
- Where's the bomb?

428
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:03,839
You've almost eaten
the entire thing.

429
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,509
Billie, what are you doing?

430
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:10,879
I thought you put a bomb
in the turkey.

431
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,114
Are you crazy?

432
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,716
You thought I was gonna, what?

433
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:17,386
Kill all these people
and blow up my own house?

434
00:17:17,387 --> 00:17:18,921
'Cause you said--

435
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,757
you said the turkey's
gonna be "da bomb."

436
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:25,227
It's an expression from the '90s.

437
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:27,529
I snuck in Joy
to do the cooking tonight.

438
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,798
I figured, dad,
if you tasted her food

439
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,401
maybe you'd remember
why we love her so much.

440
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:34,770
- Aww.
- I know, I'm a sweetheart.

441
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:38,942
- What--I ruined everything?
- Pretty much.

442
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,081
What is that? Crying?

443
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:47,816
Or is that a cat
trying to breath in outer space?

444
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,985
Or like a ghost that's
trying too hard to be spooky?

445
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,821
We get it!
We all get it!

446
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,923
Look, I am sorry, but I am not

447
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:57,093
changing my mind on this one.

448
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,729
I'll make you an offer, Joy.

449
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,232
I've sat here.
I've eaten your appetizers.

450
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,567
And guess what?
I like what I taste.

451
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:07,236
How'd you like
to come work for me?

452
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:10,205
I'll give you 10% more
than you were making here.

453
00:18:10,206 --> 00:18:12,474
- Well, of course--
- Not so fast.

454
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:14,877
I'm in love...

455
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:16,412
and her name is Joy.

456
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:18,213
I want to add you to my portfolio

457
00:18:18,214 --> 00:18:21,016
of home care professionals.
20% raise...

458
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,851
and three nights a week off.

459
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,520
Yeah, I'm sure she'll love

460
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,854
cleaning up
after your three toddlers

461
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,222
and two mistresses, Charles.

462
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Leave Susan and Bunny out.

463
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:31,427
This is business.

464
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:33,762
Join the Spielvogel clan, Joy.

465
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:35,998
What do you say?

466
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:43,706
Both offers are great,
but--

467
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,507
Let me sweeten the pot.

468
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:48,010
I'm all-in
on the Joy business.

469
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:51,246
I'll give you 30%
more than you're making now,

470
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:55,851
plus first right of refusal
on all leftovers.

471
00:18:55,852 --> 00:19:00,456
Sasaki goes through staff
like they're paper towels.

472
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:03,258
All the offers are on the table.

473
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:04,526
What's your decision?

474
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:06,562
Can we have a moment
to step outside

475
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:07,730
to think about our decision?
- C-can we just work out--

476
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,231
Wait!

477
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,467
I want back in.

478
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:14,370
Joy, I will double your pay.

479
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:17,940
That's 100% raise,
but more than money,

480
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:21,110
I'll throw in something
you really deserve:

481
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:23,545
an apology.

482
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:26,782
I'm sorry, Joy.
I never should have let you go.

483
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:29,218
I made a mistake.
Please come back.

484
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:30,619
<i>♪</i>

485
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,256
Mr. Russell...

486
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:37,659
you've got a deal.
- Yes!

487
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,095
Nobody out "Shark Tanks"
Kent Russell.

488
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,897
We've got our Joy back.

489
00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:43,732
- Oh, Billie.
- Ew.

490
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,334
- Oh, did you--
- Eat the whole thing?

491
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:49,605
I ate it all.
I ate the meat.

492
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:53,075
- I ate the guts!
- Ew.

493
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:55,477
- I ate it's ass!
- Ugh.

494
00:19:55,478 --> 00:19:57,312
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

495
00:19:57,313 --> 00:19:58,981
- Do you have another one?
- I love you so much.

496
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:01,466
- Don't touch me.
- Do you have another one?

497
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:04,285
Well, the last few days
have been crazy.

498
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,820
It got nutty.

499
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:08,056
You thought I was gonna
murder my entire family.

500
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:09,257
That's what happens when your body

501
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,592
starts eating its own tissue.

502
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:14,896
I learned a lot, though.

503
00:20:14,897 --> 00:20:16,564
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

504
00:20:16,565 --> 00:20:18,633
I learned that you really
can send a message

505
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,301
with your actions.
- Mm.

506
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,569
I learned that
if you want to fight

507
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,804
for the little guy,
you become--

508
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,677
Right.

509
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:31,679
I forgot to untie Hope.

510
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,984
I tied her up in the panic room.

511
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,255
What do you think
JFK's doing right now?

512
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:42,490
I don't want
to talk about it.
