- What?

176
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:10,971
You got my cast wet!

177
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:12,239
I don't know how to swim!
Here, I'll help you.

178
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:13,340
I'll help you.
I got you.

179
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,709
Ow, no, no!
No, no, no!

180
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,611
I'm not making a funny joke!

181
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:19,646
- Get off of me!
- I can't.

182
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,314
You're weighing me down, man.

183
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,949
I need you.

184
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:25,385
Why are you so much heavier
than you are on land?

185
00:07:25,387 --> 00:07:27,621
- Wake up! Wake up!
- Okay?

186
00:07:27,623 --> 00:07:29,222
I can't die!
What's wrong with you?

187
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:31,091
I can't die, I've never
been to France.

188
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:33,160
- You're my sea pony.
- I am not your sea pony.

189
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,795
- Giddy-up!
- Ahh!

190
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:35,896
Dinner!

191
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:37,164
Give it a rest, joy.

192
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,665
Everyone knows
your accent is fake.

193
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,034
That is true.

194
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,803
Help us!
Don't go chasing waterfalls.

195
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:44,438
No, no, no, no, no!

196
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,505
No, no!

197
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:55,657
Tanzy, what is this link
you just sent me?

198
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,092
It's all the buzzfeed quizzes.

199
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:00,395
I'm finding out what kind
of bird I would kill

200
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,163
if I was a Jaguar.

201
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:03,662
Oh, yeah.

202
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:06,153
- You look ridiculous.
- Get a mirror.

203
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:07,259
Why?

204
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:09,368
Obviously I'm indicating
that you look the same.

205
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:10,439
Oh, indicating.

206
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:12,908
Why don't you take your five-dollar
words and live off of that

207
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,543
instead of living off
my dad's money.

208
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:17,085
Brring, brring!
Hold on, I have to take this.

209
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:18,136
- What?
- Hello?

210
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:21,864
Oh, it's the ironic operator
from... Irony... Town.

211
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:24,786
That's not a real phone.
Or a town.

212
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:27,889
Ha, it says rip torn
would play me

213
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:29,146
in a movie about my life.

214
00:08:29,148 --> 00:08:31,545
Ooh, I got Kate blanket.

215
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:33,464
Oh.

216
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,145
- Oh, Mr. Russell?
- Hmm?

217
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,233
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I think that

218
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:40,402
if I'm gonna get Gene
to listen to me,

219
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:42,504
we should lay down
some ground rules.

220
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,638
- What are you doing?
- Also, I'm sorry I'm wet.

221
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,675
Gene, what do you have
to say about that?

222
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:48,810
I think it's disgusting
that she's telling everyone

223
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:50,445
that she's sexually aroused
at the table.

224
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,614
- I'm not sexually aroused.
- It's okay.

225
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:55,030
It happens, just don't
tell everybody about it

226
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:56,251
over a nice pasta salad.

227
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:58,754
How the heck am I Chandler?

228
00:08:58,756 --> 00:08:59,799
I don't know.

229
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:01,056
You know what
I just realized?

230
00:09:01,197 --> 00:09:03,283
- I don't say this lately.
- Hm.

231
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,694
I really don't like you.

232
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:08,658
Hey.
Get a mirror.

233
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,427
It doesn't work
in this instance

234
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:12,221
because that would mean
I don't like myself.

235
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:13,468
And it's okay that you don't.

236
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,217
Everyone agrees
that you shouldn't.

237
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:18,173
Yeah, right, who?
Everyone likes me.

238
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,908
Who doesn't like me?

239
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,509
Easy-skeezy,
right off the bat.

240
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,483
- There's me.
- Good.
- There's your parents.

241
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:25,608
Who names their kid that they
like after Billy crystal?

242
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:28,426
I was not named
after Billy crystal.

243
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,692
But even if I was,
joke's all over you, babe,

244
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:34,389
because "forget Paris" is one
of my favorite movies.

245
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:36,491
I thought your favorite movie
was "pretty woman"

246
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,860
because you love the opera
and you're a whore for money.

247
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:41,062
Well then your favorite movie
must be "waterworld"

248
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:43,303
because it was expensive
and terrible.

249
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:44,318
Like you.

250
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,196
Ha, look at that.

251
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:50,371
The quality I most admire
in a woman is earrings.

252
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:51,788
Mm-hmm.

253
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,724
I thought your favorite movie
was "splash" because

254
00:09:54,726 --> 00:09:56,148
splash!

255
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,178
Ha-ha.

256
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,480
I'm already wet, idiot.

257
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:02,252
- Is that supposed to be me?
- Yeah, this is also you.

258
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:05,307
"Please, sir, do you have
any change?

259
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:07,283
"I'm so very poor."

260
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:08,869
Mm-hmm.

261
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:12,694
Am I a ghost?
No, it's cold outside.

262
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:13,695
Temperature-wise.

263
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,731
Well, at least my daddy
doesn't have to pay people

264
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,272
to hang out with me.

265
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:28,343
Hmm, my ginger soul mate is

266
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:30,254
ed sheeran.

267
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,422
Huh.

268
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:32,856
Where's Gene?

269
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,168
I'm not Gene.

270
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,339
Oh, yeah.

271
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,939
Do you know who I am?

272
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,208
You're Billy crystal.

273
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,610
Billy crystal.
Funny.

274
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,912
Yeah, remember that movie
where we saw

275
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:53,384
where he was in that
movie with the woman?

276
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:54,387
I saw that.

277
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,330
Gene?

278
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,711
Gene?

279
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,737
Um, I brought you a beer
and some ice cream.

280
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,072
I know you usually mix it,
I couldn't quite

281
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:17,012
bring myself to do it, but...

282
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,644
A... are you there?

283
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,882
Anyway, I just wanted
to apologize for earlier

284
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,551
at dinner, and, uh...

285
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,752
That's it, really.

286
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,269
I'm not very good at this.

287
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:33,691
So, I'll just leave this here
in case you're still awake.

288
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,694
Can you hear me?

289
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,266
Gene?

290
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,454
All right, well,
see you tomorrow.

291
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:47,920
No, you won't,

292
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:50,089
'cause tomorrow...

293
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:52,091
I'm gonna kill bill.

294
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:56,916
What'd you say?

295
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,785
I heard you say my name.
What'd you say?

296
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,156
Honk-shoo, honk-shoo...

297
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,678
are you just going
"honk-shoo" like you're snoring?

298
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,240
At the door?

299
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:10,412
Go away!

300
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:26,366
What the f...

301
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:28,968
"all dicks welcome here,"
that's not true.

302
00:12:29,134 --> 00:12:31,301
So many bras...

303
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:33,264
And they're not mine.

304
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:36,709
Where would you even...
Put it?

305
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,174
Hey, Billie,
I read my assignments,

306
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:39,542
and the Bible.

307
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:41,444
Oh, my gosh.

308
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:42,946
You did this.

309
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:45,215
I really hope
my dad slash your employer

310
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:47,417
doesn't come in and see this.

311
00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:48,985
Dad!
Dad, come now!

312
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:50,286
All right, what?
Gene, I got a conference call

313
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:51,821
with a chocolate company.

314
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:55,158
Don't look up
from your phone... oh, dang it.

315
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,927
Oh, you're probably gonna want
to fire her now.

316
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:59,729
This bite's the big one.

317
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:01,798
Pack your stuff?

318
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,200
Mr. Russell, I...

319
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:06,570
This is not my stuff.

320
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:07,343
Mm.

321
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:08,571
Although I do actually

322
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:09,839
greatly enjoy that movie.

323
00:13:09,841 --> 00:13:11,007
"America n history x"?
It's...

324
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,813
- You like it?
- I love it.

325
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:14,410
- Me, too!
- Edward Norton?

326
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:16,212
With those arms?
Hold me.

327
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:18,248
How 'bout Edward Norton
with that semi-chub.

328
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,383
Are you kidding me?
When he's getting arrested?

329
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:21,551
Is that what that is?

330
00:13:21,553 --> 00:13:22,885
Yeah, what did you think
it was?

331
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,053
Like, a shorts bubble.

332
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:25,455
I'm sorry, what's going on?

333
00:13:25,457 --> 00:13:27,056
Oh, this is just all
Billie's stuff,

334
00:13:27,058 --> 00:13:28,191
so you probably want
to fire her.

335
00:13:28,193 --> 00:13:29,292
Pack your stuff.

336
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:31,761
Gene clearly staged

337
00:13:31,763 --> 00:13:33,607
to get me fired.
- Mm-hmm.

338
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:34,794
Why would I wanna
get you fired?

339
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:38,234
'Cause I don't want to watch
"garbage men with penises part vi"?

340
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:40,103
How do you know
the very specific,

341
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:42,004
very bad title of this porno?

342
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:44,440
Because it's one of the
best... i don't know.

343
00:13:44,442 --> 00:13:45,808
- You own it!
- No!

344
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,744
You were like, "here I am
in the porn shop."

345
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:50,324
"Garbage men with penises
"part vi"!

346
00:13:50,326 --> 00:13:53,149
I've never been to a porn
sho... what did you it?

347
00:13:53,151 --> 00:13:54,484
A shop?
Mr. Russell.

348
00:13:54,486 --> 00:13:56,252
A porn shop?
Mr. Russell, i...

349
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:57,520
No, don't listen to what
she's about to say, dad.

350
00:13:57,522 --> 00:13:58,788
She's a coke-head.

351
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,123
Look at her, racing to it!

352
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,557
Like a regular Tim Allen.

353
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,292
- This is flour.
- Sure, Billie.

354
00:14:03,294 --> 00:14:06,062
The room is filled with
flowers, man!

355
00:14:06,064 --> 00:14:07,563
LSD!

356
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:09,232
You're covering the wrong
side of your mouth.

357
00:14:09,234 --> 00:14:11,401
She's on LSD, dad!

358
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:13,436
Gene, this is very, very
creative stuff.

359
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:15,538
Really, it is, but as I said,

360
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,775
I have a call,
and the chocolate people wait

361
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:20,476
for no man.

362
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:22,445
Excuse me.

363
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:23,679
Mr. Russell.

364
00:14:23,682 --> 00:14:24,717
- Mr. Russell.
- Huh?

365
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:27,412
Hi. Is that all you're
gonna say about that?

366
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,085
It's just Gene, all right?

367
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:30,863
She's like a... oh, what's
a good analogy?

368
00:14:30,865 --> 00:14:33,089
She's like y2k,

369
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:35,591
which everybody thought was
gonna be this huge disaster,

370
00:14:35,593 --> 00:14:37,093
then nothing happened.

371
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:38,748
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

372
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:41,197
Still have a garage
full of soup.

373
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,565
No, I mean, don't you
think there should be some

374
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:44,634
consequences or guidance

375
00:14:44,636 --> 00:14:47,237
from you?
- Don't listen to her, dad.

376
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:48,922
She's a sex addict
who loves trash dicks.

377
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:53,543
I don't love trash
di... i have normal urges.

378
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:54,597
Look.

379
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,512
Gene respects you,
and I don't think that

380
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:58,014
that applies to many people.

381
00:14:58,016 --> 00:14:59,682
I think she would stop
if you'd just

382
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:01,517
lay down the law a little.

383
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,219
I knew there was a reason
I hired you.

384
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:04,721
You're smart.

385
00:15:04,723 --> 00:15:05,922
- Thank you.
- Come on, let's go.

386
00:15:05,924 --> 00:15:08,424
Now? No, I thought you had
a chocolate emergency.

387
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:09,735
It's my daughter.
What's wrong with you?

388
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:11,011
Oh, yes.

389
00:15:12,931 --> 00:15:14,130
- Yeah.
- I'm... I'm coming.

390
00:15:14,132 --> 00:15:15,431
- Okay.
- All right.

391
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:17,133
Oh, gross, but also natural?

392
00:15:17,135 --> 00:15:19,268
Gene, your dad would like
to talk to you.

393
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,131
Yeah.

394
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,631
Cool, cool, cool,
is it to tell me

395
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:23,139
that uh... He fired you?

396
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:23,834
Pack your stuff?

397
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:26,779
All right, Gene, I, um...

398
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:30,846
Need to talk to you.
Need to talk to...

399
00:15:31,124 --> 00:15:32,415
- You.
- You.

400
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:35,818
What you did was...

401
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:40,136
Bad.
And...

402
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:41,891
Get out of the house.

403
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:43,159
No, she's on
house arrest, so...

404
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:44,560
huh?
- She has to stay here.
(Clean the room.)

405
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:46,829
Clean the room!

406
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:48,130
(Do the book report.)

407
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:49,599
And report a book.

408
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:51,702
- That's good. That's close enough.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

409
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,970
- I would love to.
- Mm-hmm.

410
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:56,539
But I don't want to.

411
00:15:56,541 --> 00:15:57,486
Okay, well, that's solved.

412
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:59,175
No, no, no.
Not gonna want to, remember?

413
00:15:59,177 --> 00:16:00,610
- Oh, yeah.
- But she has to.

414
00:16:00,612 --> 00:16:01,602
- Yeah.
- Yes.

415
00:16:01,604 --> 00:16:03,352
Oh, right, right.
Makes sense to me now.

416
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:04,325
Yeah, yes. Here we go.
Okay.

417
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:06,594
Gene.

418
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:08,918
You have to.

419
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,158
No.

420
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,993
- More stern.
- More stern. Okay.

421
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,004
- You have to!
- Oh, my God!

422
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,613
- What are you doing?
- I wasn't gonna hit her!

423
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,361
I just... i was just threatening
her, a little bit.

424
00:16:18,363 --> 00:16:21,226
- Just use your voice.
- Okay. All right.

425
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:24,100
Gene,

426
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:26,035
I want you to clean
this room right now,

427
00:16:26,037 --> 00:16:27,837
and after that, I want you
to do your book report,

428
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,072
and from here on out,

429
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:31,907
you will listen to what...

430
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,877
- Billie.
- Billie tells you to do

431
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,653
or I will be very, very
disappointed

432
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:40,387
in you.

433
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,931
Fine.

434
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:47,957
- That was great.
- That was really good.

435
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,473
- That was so great!
- You did so good.

436
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,460
My God, you're so brave
and authoritative.

437
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:53,696
- Well, you know.
- My God.

438
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:55,331
Oh, and Gene?

439
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,921
You can leave that poster.

440
00:16:58,403 --> 00:17:00,616
Thanks.
Mm.

441
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:03,939
Stupid book report!

442
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,475
♪ ♪

443
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:09,161
Sorry if this book report's
not very good.

444
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:11,630
I've been up late
working hard on it,

445
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,165
but then also "school ties"
came on,

446
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:14,800
and that's one of
my favorite movies,

447
00:17:14,802 --> 00:17:16,402
which is surprising,
'cause I don't like

448
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:19,171
anything school-related, but
I love Jewish-themed movies.

449
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:22,041
- No, that's okay.
- Why are you interrupting
the book report?

450
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:23,709
Oh, I didn't realize you...

451
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,744
Are you reading that
off the page?

452
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:27,579
- Yes!
- Oh. Sorry.

453
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:29,415
It was so conversational,
I thought we were just talking.

454
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,784
Okay, well now I lost
my frickin' spot.

455
00:17:31,786 --> 00:17:33,819
- I'm sorry.
- Just let me...

456
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:35,187
All flustered now.

457
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:39,458
I did my book report on

458
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,690
"fear and loathing
in Las Vegas."

459
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:45,290
I liked it slash it was
confusing as **.

460
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:47,800
The book starts
with raoul Duke

461
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:49,501
behind the wheel
of a convertible.

462
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:54,973
<i>He realizes the drugs he took
earlier are kicking in.</i>

463
00:17:54,976 --> 00:17:56,393
They're kicking in,
the drugs, yes?

464
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:00,279
<i>- Next to him sits
his 300-pound attorney,</i>

465
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:03,593
<i>Dr. Gonzo,
aka the fat samoan.</i>

466
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:08,487
<i>- They were headed
to Vegas from L.A.</i>

467
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:09,922
Let's go to Vegas.

468
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:11,857
<i>- And there were bats
and stuff.</i>

469
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:14,727
I see two more.
I see bats.

470
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,332
It's real. It's real.

471
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:21,834
<i>- They're on their way
to Vegas,</i>

472
00:18:22,287 --> 00:18:24,743
<i>but they got derailed
because Lenny is like,</i>

473
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:27,005
<i>"curley, what's up
with your hand?"</i>

474
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:28,674
I like to keep my hand
nice and soft

475
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:31,662
so I can touch my girlfriend.

476
00:18:31,664 --> 00:18:33,441
Aw, that feels gross.

477
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:35,402
Wait, who's lennie?

478
00:18:35,404 --> 00:18:37,883
Me... sometimes, uh,
raoul Duke

479
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:39,685
calls himself lennie.

480
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:40,819
Got it.

481
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:41,887
<i>- So they took off.</i>

482
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:44,257
This plane's going fast.

483
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:47,160
I don't think planes
were invented yet.

484
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:49,161
<i>- They continued their journey.</i>

485
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:51,856
Cow, cow, cow, cow.

486
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:53,909
That's not a cow.
That's a tire.

487
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,034
<i>- It was much easier
for them to get to Vegas</i>

488
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:58,956
<i>by taking the good ol'
Mississippi river.</i>

489
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,800
We gotta catch that
riverboat.

490
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:02,773
I agree with you.

491
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,320
You catch anything?

492
00:19:04,322 --> 00:19:06,412
Just this minnow.

493
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:07,811
Uh-oh.

494
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,856
You want it?

495
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:10,640
Nice minnow!

496
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:14,586
<i>- And by that time, Dr. Gonzo
was a free man.</i>

497
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:16,555
Gene.

498
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:17,827
Whoosh.

499
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,328
- Gene!
- Sup?

500
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,268
Okay.
Gimme that.

501
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,288
- Okay.
- And get off my desk.

502
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:26,334
Jeez. Demanding.

503
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:27,702
Any questions?

504
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:29,366
You with the stupid glasses
in the front?

505
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,835
How many of the books
that I gave you did you read?

506
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:34,161
'Cause it feels like you read
parts of all of them

507
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,501
without noticing
they were different,

508
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:37,212
and wove them into one story.

509
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:39,912
Okay, CSI Miami,
if you say so.

510
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:41,178
Or... any of the CSI's
would work.

511
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,155
Didn't you notice that
the names kept changing?

512
00:19:44,157 --> 00:19:45,856
Yeah, but I thought
they were, like, nicknames.

513
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:48,654
Like, how some people call me
"genie" or "goosetits."

514
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:50,422
Really wish that one
would go away.

515
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:51,370
How is that even possible?

516
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:55,194
Oh, guys said that my tits
looked like goose beaks.

517
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,498
I meant that you read
three different books

518
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,699
without noticing?

519
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,768
Well at least I tried.
Jeez.

520
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,336
Do you mind if I actually
go finish them?

521
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:05,604
Because now that I know
that the ending isn't

522
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:07,005
that huck and lennie
go to L.A.,

523
00:20:07,007 --> 00:20:08,273
I kinda want to find out
what happens.

524
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:10,108
Sure, Gene.

525
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,877
- Class over. Go.
- Okay.

526
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,032
Oh, and can I borrow a few
books from your guesthouse?

527
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:16,056
Yeah, have at it.
Go nuts.

528
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:18,191
Can't wait.

529
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:21,367
Can't wait?

530
00:20:21,369 --> 00:20:22,802
Wait a minute.

531
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,604
Gene likes reading.

532
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:26,606
She likes to read.

533
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,374
I did it.

534
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:30,209
I did it.

535
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,544
Oh, God.
Mr. Russell?

536
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:32,965
- Huh?
- I did it.

537
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:34,866
I got through.

538
00:20:34,868 --> 00:20:35,833
Yeah...

539
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,285
I...

540
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,816
I raped your daughter.

541
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:42,919
That a bill.

542
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:44,700
Date raped her!
Who am I?
