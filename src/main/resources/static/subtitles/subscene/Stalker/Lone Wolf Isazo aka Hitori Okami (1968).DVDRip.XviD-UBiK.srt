One night when the
Kiso song was in the air

00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:51,951
A man's pride made him leave his love

5
00:00:51,951 --> 00:01:04,364
Now a roaming gambler

6
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:16,572
Lone Wolf, where are you going?

7
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:31,891

Hurries on by over the bridges of Kiso

18
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,422
Who on earth told you?

19
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,427
Isazo the Wanderer?

20
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,558
I knew him well.

21
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,703
Were we sworn brothers?

22
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,869
No way.

23
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:58,942
Sure, I'M a yakuza too, but
I'M still unaccomplished.

24
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,041
But not Isazo.

25
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,582
Through and through, so to speak.

26
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:13,518
He was what a true yakuza looks like.

27
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:19,288
"The Ripper" would have been...

28
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,394
a perfect name for him
rather than 'the Wanderer".

29
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,476
He never stayed in one
place More than three days.

30
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:33,842
He killed so Many that...

31
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:38,617
he was always on alert that
someone was after him.

32
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,685
You could feel it.

33
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:49,358
He had no boss, no disciple.

34
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,126
Won't let anyone get close to him.

35
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,629
He truly was a lone wolf.

36
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,976
It was at the Shiojiri Peak in Shinshu...

37
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,558
I haven't done anything to
induce your challenge. Go away.

38
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,665
Are you chickening out, Isazo?

39
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,964
You know My name.

40
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,010
So that's Isazo the Wanderer.

41
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,170
All right.

42
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,814
Hey, I'll lend you a hand!

43
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:43,338
No need!

44
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:49,384
I don't want to have
nightmares about your graves.

45
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,548
Unsheathe your sword, coward!

46
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,525
Get him!

47
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,703
Damn you, you say one
thing and do another.

48
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,308
How dare you rape an innocent girl.

49
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,196
You'd better leave, or you'll
get Mixed up in trouble.

50
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,092
I didn't see him for a long time after that.

51
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,570
I think it was the following year,
toward the end of winter...

52
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,799
It was at Boss Yoza'emon's
Sakamoto Inn in Joshu...

53
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,881
when I ran into him the second time...

54
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,300
Excuse Me, excuse Me!

55
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,437
This is My first introduction
to you. I was born in...

56
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,064
Hold it right there.

57
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,908
You call that an introduction?

58
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,876
You haven't been around Much, have you?

59
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:28,176
Well, this is My first trip in
training. Please go easy on Me.

60
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,717
I really don't know how to go
about it. Please take Me with you.

61
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,152
You want to come as a second Man, I see.

62
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,451
Yes, I'd appreciate it.

63
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,561
I'M traveling; therefore, this
is My first introduction to you.

64
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,189
I ask the Chief and Madam of your
family to forgive My introduction.

65
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:48,968
I was born Kiso. My boss in the gambling
business is Age Matsu-no-Jinbei.

66
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,505
I'M his young disciple, Magohachi,
who is just a beginner.

67
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,640
I ask you to kindly
acknowledge our encounter...

68
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,870
and regard Me as an ally from now on.

69
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:05,414
I'M Hanji, born in Mino.
Pleased to Meet you.

70
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:39,714
Excuse Me but aren't you Isazo?

71
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,993
Didn't I Meet you in Shiojiri Peak?

72
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:51,030
You remembered. Thanks.

73
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,000
What are you waiting for?
Come draw water for him.

74
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,801
Yes!
- Hurry up.

75
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,998
Oh, I'M fine. Excuse Me.

76
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:07,036
Brother, who is he?

77
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,916
What's wrong with you?

78
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:13,052
If you want to be a
gambler, know your basics.

79
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,077
That's Isazo the Ripper.

80
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,358
That's him?

81
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,825
Hurry up.

82
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,628
It's a known fact...

83
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,731
that whomever he sides with always
wins a war between families.

84
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,258
That's why every family
Manager wants to hire him.

85
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,069
Not only that...

86
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:35,999
They say he has a divine touch
when it comes to dice rolling.

87
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,218
Boss, Madam, I am grateful for the Meal.

88
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,987
I am grateful.
- I am grateful.

89
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,255
Shall I go get another?

90
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,190
What?

91
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,391
There's only this Much left.

92
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,492
Idiot.

93
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,561
It's a rule that a traveler can
only have one bowl of soup...

94
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,358
one Main dish, and two bowls of rice.

95
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,631
Thank you for the Meal.

96
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,254
Brother, please lie down.

97
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,051
Hey, hold it.

98
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,427
What kind of layout is this?

99
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,362
What?

100
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,165
I can't believe how ignorant you are.

101
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:24,737
A traveler sleeps in a
single layer folded in two.

102
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:25,704
Do it over.

103
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,674
But Brother, we'll catch a
cold with just one layer.

104
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,905
It's the proper Manners. Keep it in Mind.

105
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,882
You seem to think it's easy.

106
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,318
I don't think you'll
Make it in this business.

107
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,654
You'd better quit for your own sake.

108
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,922
No way.

109
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:46,892
I can't go back to My village now.
I quit farmer business completely.

110
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,863
Being a gambler is Much
harder than being a farmer.

111
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,900
But you see, I have no Money, no status.

112
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,835
This is the only way I
can Make it in the world.

113
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,634
I've had enough of slithering
around Muddy rice paddies.

114
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,902
I'M prepared to do anything...

115
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,843
I want to be like Isazo.

116
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,849
You don't know what you're talking about.

117
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,410
You can never be like him
with soft spirit like yours.

118
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,049
I will.

119
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,119
I'll show you.

120
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,030
Quite a skill. He's got all the Money.

121
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,123
Isn't it the right time to quit?

122
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,660
Looks like Odd is the bet of the night.

123
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,993
Let Me bet with you, traveler.

124
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,165
Me too! Me too!

125
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,833
Odd side closed.

126
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,302
Any bet on Even?

127
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,471
We cannot continue
without a bet on Even.

128
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,839
Even?

129
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,036
This won't be a game.
What's going to happen?

130
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,679
I guess the house will
have to bet on Even.

131
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,048
Any bet on Even? Place
some bets on Even.

132
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,675
Any bet on Even?

133
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:03,219
Don't Mean to take over but I'll withdraw
My bet and counterbalance the others.

134
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,292
Bets closed.

135
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,069
Odd! 3-6 Odd.

136
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,270
He lost it all.

137
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,397
He did it knowingly.

138
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,203
You can't keep winning and just leave.

139
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,247
I will retire for the night.

140
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,084
Visitor, good game, wasn't it?

141
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,449
Yes.

142
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,681
Here you are.

143
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,391
Please use this for your refreshments.

144
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,688
Thanks.

145
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:39,230
Boss, and everyone, please excuse Me.

146
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,059
Thank you.

147
00:16:55,047 --> 00:17:00,485
Please teach Me how to read
the dices the way you do.

148
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:09,392
I'M told I came out from Mom’s
womb with dice in each hand.

149
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,029
Thank you.

150
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,005
Thank you.

151
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,007
Hey...

152
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,804
What are you doing? Hey!

153
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,385
Why are you spacing out?

154
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,845
Brother, I know I'M a beginner.

155
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,886
Nowhere near where Isazo is.

156
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,692
But he's a human being too.

157
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,295
What?

158
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,463
What would happen if I killed him?

159
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,307
My name will ring throughout
the eight regions of Kaga.

160
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,876
What on earth are you talking about?

161
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,813
Are you dreaming?

162
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,772
Hey, I'M going to visit My old lady.

163
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,952
Come out of it. What a fool.

164
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,292
I'M in bed already.

165
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,891
Excuse Me for coming back late.

166
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,232
Thank you for patrolling.

167
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,800
Thank you.

168
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,202
Have a good night.

169
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,136
Good night.

170
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,237
I will.

171
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,241
Where is Agematsu's Man?

172
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,247
He should be home soon.

173
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,544
Is that so?

174
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,505
Then, I'll turn this off.

175
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,281
Don't do it, young Man.

176
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:50,434
You're saved because I know
you hold no grudges against Me.

177
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,031
Otherwise...

178
00:22:54,139 --> 00:23:02,513
My sword would have pierced
through your neck in a flash.

179
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:08,776
I was playing a foolish
game. Please forgive Me.

180
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,420
The following spring...

181
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,856
Boss Kumokaze-no-Kamekichi
of Sanshu Hirai held...

182
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,518
an anniversary of his late predecessor.

183
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:05,143
I attended the prayer service
on behalf of the ill Boss Jinbei.

184
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:10,809
Then, at the game held
afterwards, I saw Isazo.

185
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:28,533
Wait. That's Boss
Terazu-no-Manosuke, right?

186
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:33,470
Indeed. Sitting across
from him is Mori-no-Goro.

187
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:37,133
Oh, Boss Mori.

188
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:43,380
Well, guys, I'M off.

189
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:46,384
I can't play against Isa.

190
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,787
Hey, see you later.

191
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:51,551
Isa's gonna take them
to the cleaners today.

192
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,856
What?

193
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,827
Isazo.

194
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,077
Master!

195
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,730
Master, I don't know what
happened between you and him.

196
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,468
He is a traveling Man, but someone
the big Men treat as equals.

197
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,665
You don't know what the
consequences will be.

198
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:42,801
I'd say take it easy.

199
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,978
Do you think I held Myself back
because I was afraid of him?

200
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:52,109
Not at all. Come on, pour him another cup.

201
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,589
Who is "he"?

202
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,224
None of your business.

203
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,326
Isazo the Wanderer.

204
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,590
Isazo?
- You know him?

205
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,998
Is he here now?

206
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,558
Did you have something with him?

207
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,204
I'll leave that up to your imagination.

208
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,307
I'll bring him here if you want to see him.

209
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:19,578
He won't. He dumped
Me like a piece of rag.

210
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,313
Interesting.

211
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:26,084
Woman, leave it to Me if you
have grudges against him.

212
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,218
I'll take care of him.

213
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,550
I Might have thanked you...

214
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,890
if he hadn't said he Makes
it a rule not to stay...

215
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,757
in one place More than three days
or with one particular woman.

216
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,284
Welcome!

217
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,462
Good evening.

218
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,909
Bring some Sake. And a plate of your pick.

219
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,651
One bottle and one vegetable!

220
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,580
Welcome!

221
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,355
Here you are.

222
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,168
Bring some Sake, and a plate of your pick.

223
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:21,036
Yes. Kitchen, a plate of your choice!

224
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,980
Yone, bring five or six bottles to the back.

225
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,409
Here's a rare visitor.

226
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:26,831
Why? Can't you say at least something?

227
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,707
I'M glad you're well.

228
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,503
I see you know how to say pleasantries.

229
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,853
Isazo, it's Me. It's been a while.

230
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,378
I saw you in the corner at the game.

231
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,324
My, you knew.

232
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:47,459
Now, now, let Me pour you.

233
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:51,088
I like to pour for Myself.
I don't like being treated.

234
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:53,755
You aren't bright, are you?

235
00:28:55,834 --> 00:29:00,038
Give up trying to be friends with him.

236
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,674
He's a heartless, cold-blooded Man.

237
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:07,008
He Makes a woman cry and
doesn't Move a Muscle in his face.

238
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,411
Did he Make you cry too?

239
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,807
That's right.

240
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,043
I was working at Midori-ya in Goyu.

241
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,354
I'M so Mad.

242
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:23,923
He Made Me crazy about him, then
left Me in the cold without a goodbye.

243
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,732
Are you leaving, you heartless bastard?

244
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,166
Age Matsu, come with Me.

245
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,337
All right.

246
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,404
Bastard!

247
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,407
Not even a smile after a long time.

248
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:39,043
I wish you'd get killed in some fight.

249
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,409
I won't cry for you if you're dead!

250
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,546
Isazo!

251
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,373
Who Might you be?

252
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,204
Saito Itto.

253
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:16,347
Taga Chuzaburo whom you crippled at
the Shiojiri Peak is My longtime friend.

254
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,077
Master! Please don't.

255
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:23,588
Isazo, it's My predecessor's
anniversary today.

256
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,290
Please keep the peace.

257
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,891
I am aware.

258
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,291
Thank you for your hospitality today.

259
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,956
And you call yourself the Ripper?
Live up to your reputation!

260
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,169
I don't want to cause a scene at
a bar with innocent customers.

261
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:54,085
I'll wait for you at the bamboo
woods down the street after four.

262
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,780
Don't back down.

263
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:57,784
Let's go.

264
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,933
Here's one for you.

265
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,992
You can drink, can't you?

266
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,733
What's the Matter?

267
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,947
I can't believe it.

268
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,814
You're about to have a duel.

269
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,221
Hey, leave us alone for a Minute.

270
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,553
But...
- C’mon, beat it.

271
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:48,028
Isa, let's exchange cups.
I want us to be brothers.

272
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,035
I won't. I like being alone.

273
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,474
You don't like Me.

274
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:57,581
You're from Age Matsu in Kiso, right?

275
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,549
That's right.

276
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,016
That's the reason.

277
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:01,419
Why?

278
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,853
I want you to do Me a favor.

279
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:07,425
There's a shop called
Shinjo-ya in Kiso Fukushima...

280
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,121
two and a half Miles east of Age Matsu.

281
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,330
Yeah, I know the shop.

282
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,696
Will you deliver this to them?

283
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:19,360
There's 50-ryo in here.
Give it to the owner.

284
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,462
Sure thing.

285
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:26,770
I never ask anyone any favor,
but I feel I can trust you.

286
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,943
You won't let Me down, will you?

287
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,551
You said you can trust Me.

288
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,310
Let Me ask you one thing...

289
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,120
Why do you want to kill Me?

290
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,855
A low life like you...

291
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:14,359
calling yourself a killer and acting
like some big deal. How annoying.

292
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,917
I can't let you be.

293
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,988
I see.

294
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,168
Just surviving but still a samurai.

295
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,537
You want to prove I'M
below you somehow.

296
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:27,970
Shut up!

297
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:31,105
You raped My good friend's daughter.

298
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,677
Damn you!

299
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,404
I hope Isazo will be okay.

300
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,821
I suppose...

301
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:03,528
I'll add a new tomb plaque in My eyes.

302
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,362
He won, didn't he?

303
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:12,365
Isazo won, didn't he?

304
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,251
People of Kumokaze...

305
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:29,325
I'M on My way to assist
Kurokoma-no-Katsuzo in Koshu.

306
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,152
If you need to send Men
after Me, please go ahead.

307
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,735
Isazo!

308
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:54,542
He runs fast too, like a wild animal.

309
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,068
This is the battle drum!

310
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:47,638
Let us play it too!

311
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:50,698
Now, the random battle drum!

312
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:58,115
There's no such thing as a battle drum!
- Switch with us!

313
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,878
What are you doing?

314
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,453
I will not tolerate such rude behavior!

315
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,956
Stop talking vainly like a samurai!

316
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,191
My father is a samurai!

317
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,954
Liar! He's not a samurai!
- What?

318
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:22,299
Fatherless kid! Fatherless kid!

319
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,453
Be a Man. Don't take that from them.

320
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,221
Does it hurt? You won't cry, right?

321
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,917
No way, I'M a samurai’s son.

322
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,088
Leave it like this and it'll
be fine in a couple of days.

323
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,065
Boy, where do you live?

324
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,589
Over there.

325
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:25,232
Come on.

326
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,802
I can walk.

327
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:32,877
Yoshi-no-suke, what are you doing?

328
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:34,811
Oh, Mother!

329
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,681
What happened?

330
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,512
That Man.

331
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:44,051
Oh, how very kind of you.

332
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,599
Lady Yoshino!

333
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:17,615
Lady Yoshino, so, the child Must be...

334
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,429
Say thank you to him.

335
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,365
Thank you, Uncle.

336
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,890
Thank you for your kindness.

337
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,385
Nothing has changed.

338
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,520
It's all just like 8 years ago.

339
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,067
Hey, old Man, it's been a long time.

340
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,739
I'M glad you're well.

341
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,833
I hope you received the gift
I sent you the other day.

342
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:25,115
I hereby confirm receipt of
the chunky sum of 50 ryo.

343
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:27,140
Thanks for everything.

344
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:31,121
I see it as your funeral expense.

345
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,958
The amount now exceeds 200 ryo.

346
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,153
Haven't you given it to Lady Yoshino?

347
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,929
She refuses to take it.

348
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,731
Did you ask her why?

349
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,699
She wouldn't tell Me.

350
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,431
Poor lady...

351
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:51,275
She Makes a humble
living as a seamstress.

352
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,266
I see. That explains.

353
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,470
Did you see her?

354
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,245
But why wouldn't she?

355
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,477
Stop it!

356
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:19,726
Idiot!

357
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,732
The heiress of the Ueda Family...

358
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,702
having an affair with a
servant and eloping with him?

359
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,270
Have you gone Mad?

360
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,535
Yoshino, apologize to your father at once.

361
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,678
Isazo's father was a traveling gambler
who collapsed in front of our house!

362
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,780
My Mother took pity on him.

363
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,183
She called the doctor for him
and even paid for his funeral.

364
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:42,744
We raised orphan Isazo out of kindness.

365
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,255
How dare he force himself
on his benefactor's daughter!

366
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,985
No, he didn't force Me.

367
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:52,229
We are in love.

368
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,098
Shut the hell up!

369
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:58,969
I didn't raise My daughter
to fall for a gambler’s son!

370
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,571
I taught him how to write and read...

371
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:04,875
and how to use the sword,
even though he's a servant.

372
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:08,333
He's a dog that bites the
hand that feeds him!

373
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,738
Uncle, we'll find Isazo and...

374
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,658
What are you doing to him?

375
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,991
I said you two are strangers from now on.

376
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,864
I'M carrying his baby.

377
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,866
I forbid you to have the baby!

378
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:32,029
Then, please disown Me as you wish!

379
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,871
Think about it.

380
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:37,141
Where will you get going
out into the world with him?

381
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,143
He has no future.

382
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,813
You will tarnish the name
of the Ueda Family forever.

383
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:47,580
You won't only disgrace the family
and bring shame to your father...

384
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,687
but you and your baby...

385
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,987
will also have to bear that
cross for the rest of your lives.

386
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,930
My lady, I waited for you!

387
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,750
Sir Hirazawa, what are you doing to Me?

388
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,911
Ask yourself!

389
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,056
Where is Lady Yoshino?

390
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,148
Shut up!

391
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:33,430
How dare you betray the people
who generously took you in...

392
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,998
and attempt to Marry Lady Yoshino?

393
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,091
You deserve to be punished!

394
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,598
You are the ungrateful scum of Mankind.

395
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,443
You're below dogs and beasts. Give up!

396
00:45:56,887 --> 00:46:00,914
More than anyone else, I
know how virtuous Isazo is...

397
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:07,090
and how hard he worked to serve us.

398
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:13,896
But if you end up eloping with
a Man of such a low class...

399
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:20,711
then your father would have to
resign as chief of border security...

400
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:22,679
which the family has
served as for generations.

401
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,245
I am not saying this because...

402
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:31,680
I care about the Ueda's name, or
your father's reputation, or Mine.

403
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:35,953
Consider the future of the baby.

404
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:44,133
All we need is for Isazo to leave
Fukushima, for you to endure.

405
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:48,963
If it is a baby boy, he will
be the heir to the family.

406
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:56,180
It is the right way for a woman to
consider the happiness of her child.

407
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,909
Mother!

408
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,008
My lady!

409
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,634
My lady!

410
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,714
Isazo!

411
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:37,781
My lady...

412
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,726
Day will break soon.

413
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:50,300
We Must leave while it's dark
so that they will not see us.

414
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:53,531
My lady, quick, please get ready.

415
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,610
Please hurry, My lady.

416
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:15,652
Isazo, forgive Me.

417
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,287
I... I...

418
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,468
I cannot be with you any More.

419
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:32,309
My lady.

420
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:37,337
I am giving up My happiness
for the baby's sake.

421
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,542
For the baby...

422
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:48,789
What do you Mean? I don't understand.

423
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,761
I will wait for you.

424
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,925
Please find a respectable position worthy
of the Ueda name and then return.

425
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,364
Do you Mean to say the son
of a gambler is not human?

426
00:48:59,636 --> 00:49:02,434
Take this Money and hurry and go.

427
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:07,239
You go from here on your own.

428
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,543
Please, Isazo.

429
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:21,482
Forget it, get rid of the child!

430
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,349
Isazo!

431
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,780
You show your face after a long absence...

432
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:48,513
and already call violence
for Me to witness.

433
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:57,020
I'll let you stay the night, but you
should leave at the crack of dawn.

434
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:02,360
Excuse Me, please let Me in.

435
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:05,030
I told you.

436
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:08,162
They're back for revenge.

437
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:16,007
Who is it? It's late.

438
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,986
I remember you.

439
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:26,888
I won't be formal. I heard Isazo is here.

440
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:35,999
They can't stop talking about how
you single-handedly led Kurokoma...

441
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:37,734
to win the Koshu war.

442
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,836
The story has spread down Kiso Road.

443
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:42,239
You kept your promise
to deliver the good.

444
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,273
Thanks.

445
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,342
Stop being so formal.

446
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:46,076
Oh, thanks.

447
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,178
What brought you here to Fukushima?

448
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,680
That's My question.

449
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,717
I'M sure you're aware that
the Kojin and Kiyotake...

450
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,787
had a run-in and are now on bad terms.

451
00:50:56,787 --> 00:51:00,190
It all started because
Kojin bullied Kiyotake...

452
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:04,528
and invaded their territory
during the Ontake festival.

453
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:06,730
They bribed Detective Hirazawa
at the police to take their side...

454
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,232
so they feel they can do
whatever they want.

455
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,223
Really distasteful.

456
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:17,240
Boss Tokubei of the Kiyotake has
been ill and keeping a low profile...

457
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,731
so they feel now's the
chance to take over.

458
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,914
So, I was compelled to
offer My help to Kiyotake.

459
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,781
His lay daughter is in charge...

460
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,511
and there's no hope for us to win.

461
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,382
The only hope to turn
the tide would be you.

462
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:40,121
I came to Fukushima because
Iwamatsu of the Kojin hired Me.

463
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,400
Kojin?

464
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,937
He's been asking Me for three
years. I couldn't keep putting it off.

465
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:52,000
I see, but you don't have to help Kojin
who's already got an upper hand.

466
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:55,078
I don't know who's got an upper hand.

467
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:57,681
I don't care who's going to win.

468
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:01,412
I just can't ignore yakuza rules.

469
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,720
That's crazy.

470
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,859
The correct way for a virtuous Man is to
side with the righteous party, isn't it?

471
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:12,454
Righteousness and virtue
have to do with your attitude.

472
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:15,287
They aren't commodities or banners.

473
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:21,862
You Mean, you won't change your
Mind about helping the Kojin?

474
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:28,441
I see, you're after the
Money they're paying you.

475
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,312
After all it's nothing More than
beasts killing one another.

476
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:37,150
One May be after the Money, but if
he dies, that's the end of the story.

477
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,915
That bar hostess in Mikawa was right.

478
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,555
You have no compassion.

479
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:50,528
I have no boss or follower,
no home or family.

480
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:54,531
The law of the yakuza is the
only thing I depend upon.

481
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:59,809
I can't hope to survive carrying
such baggage as compassion.

482
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,281
Fine.

483
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,649
I'll see you in hell.

484
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:15,082
I, Magohachi of Age Matsu,
will fight you squarely.

485
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:46,320
Are you insane?

486
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:51,326
The world would be in total
darkness without compassion.

487
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:55,186
You will never understand how
dark and how horrifying it can be...

488
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:59,396
unless you have walked the path yourself.

489
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,270
I heard Isazo is back in town.

490
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,773
Is that so?

491
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,211
You don't seem surprised.

492
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,017
He became a gambler after all.

493
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,921
You can't fight against your own blood.

494
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:58,455
It's My fault.

495
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:04,801
If only I had left with him, he
would have been a straight Man.

496
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,428
Don't be stupid!

497
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,102
Lf...

498
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,177
If you had accepted Me as your husband...

499
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:18,079
the Ueda family would have been
fine even after Uncle passed away.

500
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:21,774
All would have been peaceful.

501
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,122
How could you, with that lowly Man!

502
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,391
I Must kill him in the
name of a samurai’s pride.

503
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:36,433
Seiichiro...

504
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:39,469
It's all water under the bridge
now. Why do you have to?

505
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,305
If people find out Yoshi-no-suke's
father is a criminal...

506
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,874
it would hinder him from going to Kyoto...

507
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:48,071
for academic studies or
being regarded as a samurai.

508
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:52,213
Understand?

509
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,213
There is a chance Isazo May stop by.

510
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:59,946
I forbid you to see him even
if he did. Send him away.

511
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,256
I'M going to kill him.

512
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:16,403
The Man you've been loyal to for
eight years is a yakuza and criminal.

513
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,467
He is scum.

514
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:24,537
I hear he's earned the name 'the ripper".

515
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,548
Makes Me laugh!

516
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:34,555
You hate him that Much.

517
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,722
When a samurai receives
a scar by a lowly Man...

518
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:44,365
he Must finish him off to save face.

519
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:07,049
Uncle?

520
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:09,092
Goroku?

521
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:13,188
Well, if it isn't Miss Ueda.

522
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,494
Has Isazo been by here?

523
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,068
Please don't hide it from Me.

524
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,670
I have important business with him.

525
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:22,763
Okay? Just tell him so.

526
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,705
Just a Moment please.

527
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:28,711
People May see you out here.

528
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,509
Please come around the back door.

529
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,637
Go away from here. Leave
as soon as possible.

530
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,406
Hirasawa is after you.

531
00:57:56,406 --> 00:58:00,043
He'll order the border security to
stop you too. Leave right now.

532
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:04,036
It shouldn't Matter to
you whether I live or die.

533
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,957
After I'M finished with My yakuza
business, I won't have any reason to stay.

534
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:15,549
You don't have to tell Me to leave.

535
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:20,160
Except, just one More time...

536
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,421
You want to see Yoshi-no-suke?

537
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:25,768
I was hoping to.

538
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:28,828
So you want to show up the way you
are and tell him you're his father?

539
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:33,009
Are you against it? He's My child.

540
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,842
I told him his father is dead.

541
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:41,914
I want him to go to Kyoto
for academic studies.

542
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,988
Utilize the Money I left with the old Man.

543
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:46,022
I don't want it go to waste.

544
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:51,027
Do you think we will be happy
with Money earned by gambling?

545
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:54,690
I put My life at risk to Make the
Money. It's as clean as can be.

546
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,930
I lost both My parents.

547
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,936
Our Mansion has been
given to someone else.

548
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:06,342
I would have been so happy if, rather
than pitying how poor we are...

549
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:09,311
you returned as a respectable
father that he deserves.

550
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:20,580
I see.

551
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:24,383
My hands are covered with
blood of the Men I've killed.

552
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:29,225
You feel ashamed of Me,
and I have no regrets.

553
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:34,635
Would you dare hold
him with those hands?

554
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,006
Of course I would.

555
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:39,275
Being a yakuza was the only way for Me...

556
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:42,335
to survive when I had
no one to depend on.

557
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:52,782
There is no point blaming each other now.

558
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:02,793
Please do not show up in front of him.

559
01:00:03,566 --> 01:00:05,932
Take good care of yourself.

560
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:10,005
I pray for a safe journey...

561
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,298
Sirs, helpers...

562
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:51,076
We have just received a declaration
of war. Tonight is the night.

563
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:56,549
We are counting on you.

564
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,285
Thank you.
- Thank you.

565
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,315
Thank you...

566
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:05,995
Here you are.

567
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:07,230
I'll give My best.

568
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,631
Thank you.

569
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:11,968
Thank you. I guarantee you My best.

570
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,230
Thank you...

571
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:19,135
Thanks.
- Thank you.

572
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:23,972
Thank you.

573
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:32,179
Oh, it's you, Hanji.

574
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,019
Brother!

575
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:40,221
I feel Much better now that
I know you're with Me.

576
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,165
What's that?

577
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,666
It's a one ryo gold coin.

578
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:46,335
I'M a full-fledged helper at last.

579
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:47,937
I'M getting kind of excited.

580
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:49,238
Idiot!

581
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:50,273
What?

582
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:54,437
Where did you learn to act so pathetic
to help someone just for Money.

583
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,747
But Brother, all these people here too...

584
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:03,151
The Manly Man's spirit is valuable
when it cannot be bought by Money.

585
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:06,155
One shouldn't fight for
someone when they're wrong...

586
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:09,090
even if they're willing to pay 5 or 10 ryo.

587
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:18,367
Now that Isazo is here to help us...

588
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,268
we've already won this fight.

589
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:36,311
Well, please kill off all Members
of the Kiyotaki family.

590
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:40,551
Please take it.

591
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,058
I'll receive it later.

592
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,560
Are you saying it's too little?

593
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,459
Kiyotaki's got 22 or 23 Members.

594
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,370
Let's say they've got about 10 helpers.

595
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,972
So they've got roughly 30 Men in total.

596
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:58,808
Well, you're well informed.

597
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:01,377
I put the only life I've got at risk.

598
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,846
I Must be informed about My opponent.

599
01:03:03,846 --> 01:03:07,784
What does that have to do with this?

600
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:11,621
I have an idea how Much is in there.

601
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,748
It seems a little off the Mark.

602
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,392
What?

603
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:18,461
It would seem you could
find sufficient help...

604
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:22,031
for that kind of a job along Kiso
Road and Nakasendo Highway.

605
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,862
Well, if you excuse Me.

606
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,228
Hey, wait a Minute!

607
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:37,670
So, you're Isazo.

608
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:47,216
Isazo, this is Master Kito.

609
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:51,149
How do you do? Can I
do something for you?

610
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:56,290
I overheard your conversation.
You seem confident of your skills.

611
01:03:56,899 --> 01:04:01,103
I hear they call you the ripper, and
that you're a skilled swordsman.

612
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,972
Thank you.

613
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,407
Excuse Me.

614
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:05,931
Wait!

615
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,904
I want to take a good
long look at the face...

616
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:20,281
of a famous Man.

617
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,787
You're playing with Me.

618
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:29,128
That's an unforgivable remark!

619
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:41,408
I've Made up My Mind. 15 ryo.

620
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:44,009
20 ryo!

621
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:50,081
Please rate Me after the war.

622
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:06,926
Uncle!

623
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,103
Little Yoshi.

624
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:10,573
Where's your Mom?

625
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,541
She went to deliver a kimono she sewed.

626
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:14,710
She said she'd be right back.

627
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:16,109
I see.

628
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:18,381
You're brave to wait at home alone.

629
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:21,839
I'M fine. I always do so I'M used to it.

630
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,777
Little Yoshi, where's your dad?

631
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,938
My father is dead.

632
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,515
Did they tell you what
kind of a Man he was?

633
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:57,043
Mother often tells Me that
he was a fine samurai.

634
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:02,087
She wants Me to be just like him.

635
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:06,124
But I don't know how to
become a fine samurai.

636
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:11,666
Will you tell Me how to
become a fine samurai?

637
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:17,440
Well, you see, you've got to practice
the sword and study academics...

638
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,705
I can't find a teacher
because I'M fatherless.

639
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:24,003
Because you're fatherless?
That's ridiculous.

640
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:30,415
I wonder why he had to die.

641
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,239
You don't have to have a teacher.

642
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:02,144
Just listen to your Mother, and
you will surely become a fine Man.

643
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:24,940
Give it to your Mother.
Tell her it's from Isazo.

644
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:27,176
So your name is Isazo.

645
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:29,111
What do you do?

646
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:33,616
You're not a samurai, you
don't look like a townsman...

647
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:34,950
I'M traveling.

648
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,519
What do you do traveling?

649
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:37,420
Business.

650
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:41,424
What do you sell? Why
do you carry a sword?

651
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:44,527
This is to protect Myself on My journey.

652
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,552
You Must be real strong.

653
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:53,030
A sword is heavy.

654
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:01,072
I'M gonna cut you!

655
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:07,817
But Uncle, you only got one sword.

656
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:10,445
A samurai carries two.

657
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:18,761
Listen, use the Money and go
to Kyoto with your Mother.

658
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:23,289
You Must study well and become as
fine a samurai as your late father.

659
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,097
All right?

660
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,025
Sure!

661
01:08:30,072 --> 01:08:35,377
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

662
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:38,744
Of course you won't
because I'M going to Kyoto.

663
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:46,219
Be well. Study as hard as you can.

664
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:51,227
Good bye.

665
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:52,717
Bye.

666
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:28,322
Isazo, let's have a Match, one on one.

667
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:29,849
All right.

668
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:48,941
Here I come.

669
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:09,229
Brother, let Me help.

670
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,625
Don't Meddle with us.

671
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,874
Stay out of this!

672
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:23,976
Hanji!

673
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:30,646
Hanji!

674
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,081
Damn it!

675
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:36,319
How dare...

676
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:41,764
The war is over! It's over!

677
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:45,968
Hey, it's not over between us. Come on!

678
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,436
Don't be stupid.

679
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,571
Once a war is over, helpers are dismissed.

680
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:51,473
Once the horn is blown,
you're working for no pay.

681
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,134
That's not it.

682
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:57,046
You May be the ripper, but
you'll die in a war someday.

683
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:59,181
I don't want someone else to kill you.

684
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:03,152
I May not be able to win but
I want at least cut you once.

685
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,086
I appreciate your spirit...

686
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,886
but there's no reason why
we should rush to die.

687
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:23,272
Isazo, where to now?

688
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:26,708
I'll go get My due from Iwamatsu,
then leave during the night.

689
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:33,239
Hey, wake up, I hit you
with the back of the blade.

690
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,579
Tell Me, have you had enough of war?

691
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:41,323
No way. I'M having so Much fun.

692
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:43,025
You're impossible.

693
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,927
Let Me tell you just one
thing: Don't commit a crime.

694
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,687
Don't get involved with a
woman outside of this world.

695
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:06,281
Isazo, thank you. Boss is waiting for you.

696
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:07,483
Thank you kindly.

697
01:13:07,483 --> 01:13:08,916
Please follow us.

698
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:18,927
Well, thank you for coming.

699
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,462
Where's Isazo?

700
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:23,693
All is well. Everything as planned.

701
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,041
He's here.

702
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,838
Then, excuse us.

703
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:44,319
Listen, to save face and
the name of Ueda family...

704
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,221
we cannot let him escape this time.

705
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,552
Yes!

706
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:05,707
Aren't you taking Me the wrong way?

707
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:08,335
Boss will be here in a Minute.

708
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,023
Who is it?

709
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,961
Isazo...

710
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:35,903
There's no point struggling.
Submit to your punishment.

711
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:40,776
You raped your Master's daughter
and had her to carry an illegal child.

712
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,378
You're an immoral low life who
stained the name of the Ueda.

713
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:44,646
Take it!

714
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:49,106
I loved Lady Yoshino from
the bottom of My heart.

715
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:53,055
What's wrong with getting the
woman you love pregnant?

716
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,488
Shut up.

717
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:58,927
You and your father both
were lowly gamblers.

718
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:01,418
You weren't even supposed
to be socializing with us.

719
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:05,701
And you raped the
daughter of your Master.

720
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,430
It wasn't rape.

721
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,432
Ask Lady Yoshino.

722
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:13,175
We were in love...
- Shut up!

723
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:15,844
You deserve to be lynched.

724
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:19,211
You should die a Miserable unseen death.

725
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:23,474
Or would you rather have
the illegal child killed?

726
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,244
Isazo...

727
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:29,123
Take a look.

728
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,190
Mother!

729
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:44,973
Is this what a respectable
samurai should do?

730
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:45,874
How shameful!

731
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:47,432
Drop your sword!

732
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:53,270
Do you want the child dead?

733
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:57,319
Mother, help Me! I'M scared!

734
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:01,056
Quiet! You're the son of a samurai.

735
01:16:01,056 --> 01:16:03,923
Help Me! Help Me, Uncle!

736
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:31,809
I'M letting you die in front of these two.

737
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:34,711
Be grateful.

738
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:44,555
Run!

739
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:47,061
Please run!

740
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:56,078
I told you never to show your face again.

741
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:57,379
I can't obey you.

742
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:58,641
What?

743
01:17:02,884 --> 01:17:05,320
Because I want to see My child.

744
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,845
I won't let you call him your own.

745
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:10,585
You're scum!

746
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:29,401
Isazo, I'M not backing down tonight.

747
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:33,115
Leave Me alone. This isn't a yakuza war.

748
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,980
It's My personal responsibility.

749
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:40,511
Don't be stupid. I'M not
going to let them kill you.

750
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,592
Little Yoshi, take a good look.

751
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,904
This is what scum does.

752
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:58,031
Keep your eyes open.

753
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:00,468
Understand, son?

754
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:03,475
This isn't what a human should do.

755
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:07,582
Isazo...

756
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:11,541
Age Matsu, I don't need your help.

757
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,148
Son, watch this.

758
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:55,958
Die!

759
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,097
Isazo!

760
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:47,576
Isazo...

761
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:49,351
Are you all right?

762
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:50,818
Uncle...

763
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:58,988
Son, did you see that?

764
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:03,029
You saw it.

765
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,441
We've got to take care
of your wounds first.

766
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,945
Don't Make a fuss over
such small wounds.

767
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:19,880
I've gotten these countless times before.

768
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:26,288
Now, Lady Yoshino, you should go.

769
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:30,292
What are you saying? You've
got to see a doctor right away.

770
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:35,389
I'll take care of My own wounds
even if I have to lick them.

771
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:47,569
Little Yoshi, don't ever
become anything like Me.

772
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:55,773
Age Matsu, I'll see you again if
fate allows us and if I'M still alive.

773
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:59,746
Isazo, you...

774
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:12,060
Guess I'll have a dream about
new tomb plaques tonight.

775
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:16,799
Uncle!

776
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:52,869
Uncle!

777
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:20,499
And what happened to Isazo?

778
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,699
I haven't seen him since.

779
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:32,079
Now way he can die.

780
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:40,754
I'M sure he's traveling
somewhere, roaming about...

781
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:45,458
dreaming about new plaques.

782
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:53,365
Just like a lone wolf.

783
