1
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,207
[Carl] Children fear monsters.

2
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:12,108
Creatures of the night they
imagine hiding under beds...

3
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:17,007
Iurking in closets.

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,550
But as we grow older,

5
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:22,679
we learn evil doesn 't announce itself
with a mask or costume.

6
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,951
That the deepest,
most dangerous terrors

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,394
are those not disguised,

8
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,091
but those hidden in plain sight.

9
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,794
N ice mask, freak show.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,735
Give it back.

11
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,329
Make us.

12
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,867
Whoa! Freak show's got a knife.

13
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,240
Let me see it, doofus.

14
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,711
- It's mine.
- I said give it.

15
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,840
[boy] Leave him alone.

16
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,182
- What you gonna do, Carver?
- What you gonna do, Blakely?

17
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,252
That's enough.

18
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:02,488
- Justin's got a knife. We were...
- I'll handle it. You boys run along.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,264
You know knives
aren't allowed at school.

20
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,529
They're not?

21
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:14,198
Students caught with weapons
are subject to expulsion.

22
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,139
Well, you're new here, so this time

23
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:19,770
I'll just take the knife
and leave you with a warning.

24
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,610
Yes, sir, Mr. Jeffries. Thank you.

25
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,079
[man] That's not yours.

26
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,018
Mr. Seaver,

27
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:36,085
this school has a "no tolerance" policy
toward knives.

28
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,461
The knife's his.

29
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,363
Give it back.

30
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,131
I'm concerned about your son,
Mr. Seaver.

31
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,837
He's withdrawn and lonely.

32
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:56,541
In my experience, children act that way
when they have trouble at home.

33
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,880
You'll suffer for this.

34
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,395
[wind blowing]

35
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,070
[eerie whispers]

36
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,815
[eerie whispers]

37
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,253
Hello? Is someone there?

38
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,928
[eerie whispers]

39
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:53,098
[screams]

40
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,068
[banging]

41
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,056
[man] Mr. Kolchak.

42
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,192
[Carl] Detective.

43
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,397
[detective] I hate this kind of case.

44
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,202
It always gets to you.

45
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,540
No matter how long you've been a cop,
how many bodies you've seen.

46
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,671
You can imagine,
being a crime reporter.

47
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,736
Yeah.

48
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:14,617
Well, you know, I'd like to get
your particular insight into this case.

49
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,087
Let justice be properly served.

50
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,853
My thoughts about this case
are unorthodox.

51
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,054
Not likely to stand up
in a court of law.

52
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,064
Now you let me worry about the law,
Mr. Kolchak.

53
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:30,364
Right now I'm just interested in
understanding what happened here.

54
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,600
I find that open-minded of you.
Unusually so.

55
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,608
I wouldn't call it "open-minded".

56
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,305
I just find this
a strange and tragic case.

57
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,746
And I'd just like to set things right,

58
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,249
now, as best I can.

59
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,444
I understand.

60
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,148
Well, now, this is, um...
being videotaped.

61
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,885
So why don't we start at the beginning,

62
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,918
and tell me what made you interested
in this story in the first place?

63
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,190
I mean, last week,

64
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,062
"Accidental death by lightning"?

65
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,228
That can't properly be called
a crime at all, can it?

66
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,467
Except there was nothing
accidental about it.

67
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,098
[Carl] "Mr. Arnold Jeffries,

68
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,700
vice principal
of McClintock Elementary School,

69
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,246
found dead this morning
by the school janitor."

70
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,305
The man was struck by lightning.

71
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,907
It was a tragic, but accidental, death.

72
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,351
Lightning that tossed his body
30 feet in the air,

73
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,855
impaling him on the school flagpole?

74
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,414
In 1 978, a truck driver
in Manchester, England,

75
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,484
was struck by lightning, tossed 57 feet.

76
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,655
His body landed on his neighbor's roof.

77
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,594
I did a little reading on lightning.

78
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,299
So then you know about
the Lichtenberg figure?

79
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,934
Lichtenberg figure, yeah, of course.

80
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,437
Oh! Oh...

81
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,608
Phew! What is that?

82
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,450
- That's the Lichtenberg figure.
- Oh. What is that again?

83
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,751
Also known as
arborescent lightning burn.

84
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,021
Recognized by pathologists
as evidence of a lightning strike.

85
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,291
Oh, you are really turning me on
right now.

86
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,561
I've seen it before in lightning
strikes. What's your point?

87
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,033
- Look where the mark begins.
- Down by his waist.

88
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,766
Yeah. Lightning always strikes high,
near the head or neck. Not low.

89
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,571
That's why I called Kolchak, because
no one here's ever seen this before.

90
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:22,239
So the lightning hit something else
first, bounced off and struck Jeffries.

91
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:26,251
Only, according to the Weather Service,
no lightning struck within ten miles

92
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,310
- of the school last night.
- I give up.

93
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,152
OK, so if lightning didn't kill
this man, what did?

94
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,748
I don't know.

95
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,259
But at least you're asking
the right questions.

96
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,764
- So, you went to the school.
- Yeah.

97
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,994
- [detective] To do what?
- [Carl] Just to ask questions.

98
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,593
[Perri]
Jeffries was a popular administrator,

99
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,900
well-liked, no enemies to speak of.

100
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,339
Yeah,
the principal tells the same story.

101
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,901
I know it disappoints you, but I think
this is exactly what it seems.

102
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,810
A simple, yet bizarre, accident.

103
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,782
- Hey, guys.
- What is it?

104
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,809
I'm not sure,
but that figure on Jeffries' body,

105
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,289
and this tree, check this out.

106
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,791
[beeping]

107
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,795
[Carl] They're the same.

108
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,492
I don't get it.

109
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,943
[woman] Draw what you feel inside.

110
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,949
When someone you know passes away,

111
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,180
it's OK to feel sad,

112
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,586
or angry, or scared.

113
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,058
But the principal, and l,
and all your teachers

114
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,891
want you to know that you're safe.

115
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,488
And nothing's going
to happen to any of you.

116
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,296
- Our school is a community.
- So what are you going to do?

117
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,666
[teacher] When we lose someone
we care for...

118
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,331
- About what?
-...we come together, help each other

119
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,806
through our sadness...

120
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:59,242
You heard what your dad said
to Mr. Jeffries yesterday.

121
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,803
My dad didn't do anything.

122
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,009
...we are all friends
and what do friends do?

123
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,676
He told him he'd suffer.

124
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,811
Everybody says it was an accident.

125
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,680
But it wasn't.

126
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,657
Was it?

127
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,260
You're so lucky.

128
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,163
I'd give anything
to have a dad like yours.

129
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,468
I know.

130
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,797
And I know you're scared.

131
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,479
But you've got to tell someone.

132
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,139
- If you won't, I will.
- [bell rings]

133
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:40,879
[woman]
All right, everyone leaves early today.

134
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,561
And you're convinced that this is
the day Justin Seaver drew this?

135
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,395
It was his assignment
as part of grief counseling.

136
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,459
But nobody saw him draw it
on this particular day.

137
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,198
Well, no one except Ryan Carver.

138
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,901
Right. An 1 1 -year-old boy.

139
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,839
So, what, later that morning,

140
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,211
you approached Ryan with your theory
about Ezekiel...

141
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,307
No, no. He approached me.

142
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,284
[Carl] Can I help you with something?

143
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:18,153
Um, yeah. You were asking people about
who was carving into that tree, right?

144
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,486
That's right.

145
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,654
Is there something you want to tell us?

146
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,391
It was my friend, Justin Seaver.

147
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,330
His dad got really mad at Mr. Jeffries

148
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,494
for taking away his knife.

149
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,504
He told him he would suffer.

150
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,405
Would you know where we could find
Justin's father?

151
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,276
Over there, with Justin.

152
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,608
Do you think Justin's dad
hurt Mr. Jeffries?

153
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,313
I don't know. I heard he hurt someone
where Justin used to live.

154
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,877
That's why they moved here.

155
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,423
Do you know where that is?

156
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,390
I don't know.

157
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,689
Justin doesn't talk much.

158
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,251
Doesn't have a lot of friends.

159
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,457
Well, except for you.

160
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,763
My dad says you should be nice
to people less fortunate than you.

161
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,827
Ryan? What's going on here?

162
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,839
I'm Carl Kolchak, with the Beacon.

163
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,569
I'm Dan Carver, with the LAPD. You...

164
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,579
You normally interview kids
without their parents' permission?

165
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,638
Uh, no, Dad. Um, I came to them.

166
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,581
I was telling them about Mr. Seaver.

167
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,175
Yeah? What about Mr. Seaver?

168
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:23,449
We won't print anything
your son's told us, Mr. Carver.

169
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,989
Good thing.

170
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:32,227
So that's when it all began?
Kolchak twisting up your mind?

171
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,163
Isn't that right?

172
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,766
No. No, that's not how it happened.

173
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,935
He spoke to my son, that's all.

174
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,841
He didn't talk to you about evil?
Possession?

175
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,401
No. Not then.

176
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,945
Come on, Dan.

177
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,781
You know who we're looking at here?

178
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:59,590
Now, you're gonna go to prison.
The question is for how long?

179
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,287
I know a guy like you
couldn't do something like this,

180
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:06,525
unless Kolchak fed you
some pretty crazy ideas.

181
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,433
That he did.

182
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,768
Dan, I'm not asking you
to do anything wrong.

183
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,341
I'm just asking you to lay the blame

184
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,037
for this terrible tragedy
where it belongs.

185
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,841
On Carl Kolchak.

186
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,444
So what made you so interested
in Ezekiel Seaver?

187
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,959
I mean, by your own account,
you had nothing,

188
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:39,054
except for the vague suspicions
of an 1 1 -year-old boy.

189
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,399
[Carl] Well, that was enough.

190
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:49,534
Ryan said someone had been hurt there,
and that's why the Seavers moved.

191
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:50,905
And he was right.

192
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,035
[Perri] What are we looking for exactly?

193
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,639
[Carl] Anything that sheds light
on the mysterious Mr. Seaver.

194
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,527
- [buzzing]
- Oof!

195
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,031
[Carl] Father of the year.

196
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,533
- [woman] Who are you?
- Oh!

197
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,432
Um, reporters.

198
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,098
I'm Carl Kolchak, this is Perri Reed.
We're with the L.A. Beacon.

199
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,267
Mona Sampson. I live next door.

200
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:28,177
We'd like to ask you questions
about a former neighbor, Ezekiel Seaver.

201
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,272
Oh, Lord...

202
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,180
We were told he hurt someone here.

203
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,845
[snorts] "Hurt someone"?

204
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,911
Can you tell us what happened?

205
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,791
Truth is I never liked him.
Right from the start.

206
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,024
It was like he was hiding something.
And I always felt sorry for the boy.

207
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,962
Who did he hurt, Mrs. Sampson?

208
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,135
Mrs. Hartsman. Lived across the street.

209
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,071
The boy used to sneak into her pool,
poor thing.

210
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,631
She complained to Ezekiel,

211
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,075
and then, on a Saturday afternoon...

212
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,373
Zap.

213
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,538
Lightning strike?

214
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,343
Lightning? No.

215
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,440
High-voltage wire fell into her pool.

216
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,250
They say the water boiled.

217
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:11,721
Cooked her flesh through.

218
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,759
[detective]
Mrs. Sampson denies saying that.

219
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,227
[Carl] Of course she does.

220
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,163
[detective] And your colleague,
what was she thinking?

221
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,723
[Carl]
She was, uh, keeping an open mind.

222
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,794
- [Perri] You' re excited now.
- [Carl] See the pattern?

223
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,635
- I can see you see it.
- Do I have to connect the dots?

224
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:30,902
No. All you have to do is explain to me

225
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,912
how Seaver magically speared a man on a
flagpole and cooked a woman in her pool.

226
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,278
That's the point.
There is no explanation.

227
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,318
Yes, there is.
They're called "freak accidents".

228
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:43,878
- So there's no story here?
- No, there's a story all right.

229
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,517
It's a very sad, very human one, though.
About a man abusing his son.

230
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,118
You work that angle.
That'll make Vincenzo happy.

231
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,632
- And what are you going to do?
- Try to keep someone else from dying.

232
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,468
[Justin] You don't know what it's like.

233
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,734
Your dad is so nice.

234
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,545
You should tell somebody, Justin.

235
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,576
If you won't, I will.

236
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,018
No, don't.

237
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,020
I just wish I could live with you.

238
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,327
What's that?

239
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,237
- Dr. Lawrence? Carl Kolchak.
- [bell rings]

240
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,741
- I'm a...
- I know who you are.

241
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,244
The reporter who's been asking
crazy questions.

242
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,303
- We need to talk.
- Now's not a good time.

243
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,973
It concerns Justin Seaver.

244
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,177
You know why his father moved here.
The woman who was killed...

245
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,222
I've heard the rumors,
and I don't put any stock in them.

246
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,690
It just seems that anyone
who crosses him ends up dead.

247
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,193
Are you trying to scare me?

248
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:01,256
I'm asking for any information you have
about Ezekiel Seaver abusing his son.

249
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,561
And why would I do that?

250
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,071
Because publicly exposing him
may be the only thing to stop him.

251
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,569
If Justin Seaver has any problems,

252
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:12,737
I'll report them to the Department of
Social Services, not the newspaper.

253
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,336
Then report it anonymously,
to protect yourself.

254
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,679
I hardly think that's necessary,
Mr. Kolchak.

255
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,242
- In case you change your mind.
- Yeah.

256
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,185
I hope you do.

257
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,883
[door opening]

258
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,523
[Dr. Lawrence] Hi.

259
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,423
I hear you guys
have something to show me?

260
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,029
Show her, Justin.

261
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,126
[Mr. Seaver]
What do you think you're doing?

262
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,324
Are you looking to get me in trouble?

263
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,060
No.

264
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,103
They'll take you away.
You'll wind up in foster care.

265
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,469
Is that what you want?

266
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,674
What I do...

267
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,475
everything I do...

268
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,170
is for you.

269
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,174
Remember that.

270
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,456
Now, let's fix this.

271
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,688
You people owe me an apology.

272
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,197
We owe you?

273
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,497
- What did you feed this boy?
- This is a joke. No.

274
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,006
He's allergic. Anything with peanuts,
you coulda killed him.

275
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,099
What I saw on that child's back
has nothing to do with peanuts.

276
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,837
Lucky for you, he's better.

277
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,877
Lift up your shirt, boy.

278
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,443
Do as I say.

279
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,633
I'm taking him home now.

280
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,410
I don't know what just happened,

281
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,468
but you're not fooling me.

282
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,446
I know you hurt him.

283
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,653
[detective] Ryan told you
about the incident at school.

284
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,790
- lsn't that right, Dan?
- Yes.

285
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,766
What did you do when your son told you,

286
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,635
being an officer of the law,
and a responsible father?

287
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,471
[Dan] I tried calling Dr. Lawrence,
but she'd already gone home for the day.

288
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:01,309
And, um, by the next morning,
it was too late.

289
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,913
OK.

290
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,583
[slow whirring]

291
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:20,358
- [eerie whispering]
- [tapping]

292
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,729
Hello?

293
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,200
- Hello?
- [eerie whispering]

294
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,173
Anybody out there?

295
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,481
[fast whirring]

296
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,257
[squeaking]

297
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,062
[explosion]

298
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,932
[creaking]

299
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,663
[screams]

300
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,286
Been trying to reach you. I heard the
school psychologist was found dead.

301
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:23,055
Ceiling fan spun off its axle.
Severed her head at the neck.

302
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,288
How did that happen?

303
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,196
Ah, it's just another freak accident.

304
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,359
[sighs] What's that?

305
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,425
Justin Seaver's confidential file.

306
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,198
I lifted it from the scene.

307
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,105
Look, it says here
Ryan found large, red welts on Justin.

308
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,667
When Lawrence confronted Ezekiel,
the welts disappeared.

309
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,771
Dr. Lawrence confronted
Ezekiel about his abuse,

310
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,782
and now she's dead.

311
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,216
He killed her,
just like he killed the others.

312
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:48,810
I think you're right.

313
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,481
- What did you say?
- You're right about Ezekiel,

314
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,151
- just not in the way you think.
- What do you mean?

315
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,091
Seaver doesn't have much of a record.

316
00:19:56,161 --> 00:20:00,120
In fact, on paper he didn't even exist
until he adopted Justin three years ago.

317
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,400
Adopted?

318
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,765
And get this.
Seaver's only source of income

319
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,669
for the past three years
is as a commercial electrician,

320
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,900
specializing in high-voltage work.

321
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,237
All these deaths, Jeffries,
the woman in Val Verde,

322
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,543
and the school psychologist,
all involve electricity somehow.

323
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,311
He's staging them,
to make them look like accidents?

324
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,978
It's the first answer in this
that makes any sense.

325
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:26,184
[detective] But you weren't buying
her electrician angle, were you?

326
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,987
I wouldn't say that.

327
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,052
[detective] Come on,
you were focused on something bigger,

328
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,393
that defied rational explanation.

329
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,956
[Carl] I just knew Ezekiel Seaver
posed a danger.

330
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,265
[detective] You went to the school,
to find Detective Carver.

331
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:43,035
- Detective Carver?
- What are you doing here?

332
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,666
I need to speak about your son.

333
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,045
You' re gonna stay over tonight.

334
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,748
Dad will never let me.

335
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,752
- [Dan] What's the mystery?
- [Carl] You're aware that Ryan

336
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,845
brought Justin to see the psychologist?

337
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,516
- Yeah, I know.
- And that she was killed last night

338
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,321
by a freak accident,
only days after Mr. Jeffries.

339
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,554
What's your point?

340
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:08,396
I believe these people died because
they dared to confront Ezekiel Seaver.

341
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,727
You got any proof of that?

342
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:16,035
No proof, no. But I believe that Ryan,

343
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,305
by trying to help Justin,
may have put himself in danger.

344
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,278
It must have been unnerving,

345
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:24,782
this man telling you
that your boy was in danger.

346
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,545
No, I didn't listen.

347
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,950
You think Seaver's going to hurt my boy?

348
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,283
Yeah, I think he will.

349
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,756
No, you listened, Dan, you stood there,
and you listened,

350
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,918
while this man messed with your head.

351
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:39,225
I heard what he was saying,
but I didn't listen.

352
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,663
The evidence against Ezekiel Seaver
is circumstantial,

353
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,170
but I believe he's a threat.

354
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,175
Where did he go? Ryan!

355
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,271
[eerie whispers]

356
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,305
[Dan] Hey, Ryan!

357
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,522
Hey, Justin, where's Ryan?

358
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,720
[eerie whispers]

359
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,592
[screams]

360
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,292
Ryan!

361
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,305
[detective] He had you right
where he wanted you. Didn't he?

362
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,432
Come on, Dan.

363
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,305
Kolchak's timing?

364
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:29,211
Warning you your boy would be taken,
before it happened?

365
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,682
You were ready to
believe his wild theories.

366
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,618
- Anything on Ryan Carver?
- Jain's down at the precinct.

367
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,053
The cops are questioning
Ezekiel and Justin.

368
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,283
Lot of good that'll do.

369
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,485
- What about you?
- I got Detective Carver

370
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,996
to talk off the record.
It turns out Ezekiel's not Ezekiel.

371
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,896
Up until three years ago,
Ezekiel was Arthur Somers,

372
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,161
seminary novitiate.

373
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,203
He was studying to be a priest.

374
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,738
[sighs] So what happened
three years ago?

375
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:58,572
He got expelled from the church
for conducting an unauthorized ritual.

376
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,804
An exorcism.

377
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,039
You're kidding.

378
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,979
Janet Seaver of Flagstaff, Arizona,

379
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,074
claimed an evil spirit jumped into her.

380
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,518
Ezekiel, aka Arthur Somers,
stayed with her for two weeks,

381
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,715
- trying to drive it out.
- And did he?

382
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,621
In a manner of speaking.

383
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,820
She died from lack of food and water.

384
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,729
- So was Ezekiel arrested?
- No. And Janet left behind an only son,

385
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,393
in the care of her spiritual adviser.

386
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:24,696
Justin.

387
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,602
Ezekiel adopted the son
of the woman he killed.

388
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,336
What if, when Janet Seaver died,

389
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,244
the evil spirit jumped out of her body,
into Ezekiel's?

390
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,446
Did you run that theory
by Detective Carver?

391
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,612
Yeah. He didn't buy it either.

392
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,588
[detective]
But you did buy it, didn't you?

393
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,258
Coming at you
with all that Linda Blair stuff.

394
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,633
You were beginning to believe him,
even though you wouldn't admit it.

395
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,226
Not to him, not to anyone.

396
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,303
Yes.

397
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,837
I believed him.

398
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,758
[detective] While the police
questioned Ezekiel Seaver

399
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,350
about Ryan's disappearance,

400
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:25,294
you took the opportunity
to break into his house.

401
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:28,821
Detective Carver didn't know
what you were up to, did he?

402
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,236
- I know what you're doing.
- What I'm doing?

403
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,364
You're building a case that

404
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,908
I incited Detective Carver
to commit murder.

405
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,503
I told you, Mr. Kolchak,
I just needed your help with this.

406
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,140
You wanna prosecute me as an accessory

407
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,242
in the hope that you can reduce
Carver's sentence.

408
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,480
You were hell-bent, Mr. Kolchak.

409
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,648
- Breaking and entering...
- Ryan's life was at stake.

410
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,624
- Ryan?
- [phone rings]

411
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:59,687
Perri Reed? Hang on a second.
What are you doing back?

412
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,528
- Cops let Ezekiel sneak out.
- Ezekiel's been released?

413
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,034
- Yeah.
- When?

414
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,831
They finished 20 minutes ago.

415
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,997
I'll call you back. Come on.

416
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,337
What? What is it?

417
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,638
Kolchak. He's at Ezekiel's.

418
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,345
Ryan.

419
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,543
[door opening]

420
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,928
[creaking floorboards]

421
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,730
[footsteps]

422
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,246
[doorbell]

423
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,254
Hi, I'm Perri Reed, with the Beacon.

424
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,126
Excuse me. I just need
to ask you some questions.

425
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,596
[hushed] Kolchak!

426
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,569
Now!

427
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,435
So, everyone thinks
you kidnapped Ryan Carver.

428
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,474
You have to leave. Now.

429
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,101
This is your chance to clear your name,
Mr. Seaver.

430
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,372
[TV]

431
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,358
- You've wasted enough of my time.
- I'll have to write the story anyway.

432
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,156
- Write what you like.
- l...

433
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,423
[door closing]

434
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,146
[cackling]

435
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,805
"Malum". So what's it mean?

436
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:37,143
It's Latin for "wicked" or "evil."

437
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,809
You think Ezekiel
put it in Justin's room?

438
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,247
[Jain] What are you looking for?

439
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:46,085
That picture you took
of the tree back at the school.

440
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,017
[Jain] M, A, l.

441
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,528
Yeah, but what if it's not an "l"?

442
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,928
What if it's the start of an "L"?

443
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,558
M, A, L.

444
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,159
He was carving the same word. "Malum".

445
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,398
- Who?
- Justin.

446
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,573
It was Justin, all along.

447
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,371
[detective]
So now it was a boy who was evil?

448
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,677
Everything I've told you is true.

449
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,780
You want to solve this case?
You need to believe that.

450
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:19,221
Dan Carver believed it.
Look where it got him.

451
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,555
Dan Carver didn't believe me
until it was too late.

452
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,392
You were right.
Ezekiel didn't kidnap Ryan.

453
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:27,931
- Who did?
- That evil spirit,

454
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,491
I don't think it jumped into Ezekiel.
It landed in Justin.

455
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,230
[elevator bell]

456
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:35,898
[Perri] Kolchak, that boy is a victim.

457
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,874
If anybody's demonic, it's Ezekiel.

458
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,605
This guy's room is a religious shrine.
After Justin's mother died,

459
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,671
- he chose the name Ezekiel.
- The prophet?

460
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,377
[Carl] Who believed he was
the watcher of lost souls.

461
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,976
And that's what he's become.

462
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,647
Justin's responsible
for everything we've seen.

463
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,123
- [Jain] Justin is demonic?
- Both houses filled

464
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:58,856
with candy wrappers, video games. The
kid's in charge. Ezekiel's the prisoner.

465
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,956
Ryan told us that
Ezekiel threatened Jeffries.

466
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:06,129
[Carl] What if he wasn't threatening
him, but warning him about Justin?

467
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:09,173
[Perri] What about the welts
on his body? Dr. Lawrence?

468
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,606
- Justin did it himself.
- Why would he do that?

469
00:30:11,676 --> 00:30:14,543
Same reason he left a tree-shaped mark
on Jeffries' body,

470
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,477
and used electricity to kill him.

471
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,948
- Which is?
- T o draw attention to Ezekiel.

472
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,609
T o make him look suspicious.

473
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,243
T o get rid of him.

474
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,595
Boo!

475
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,603
It's OK, Ryan. It's just me.

476
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,765
Justin, get me out of here.

477
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,368
I can't. My dad would kill me.

478
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,310
Just get a knife and cut the rope!

479
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,444
I brought you something.

480
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,717
I'm scared.

481
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,690
I don't even know how I got here. [sobs]

482
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,521
You've gotta help me.

483
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,892
Everything's gonna be OK, Ry.

484
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,294
Promise.

485
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,798
I just want to live with you guys.

486
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,995
Please! You gotta help me!

487
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,231
You have to tell my dad where I am.

488
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,897
OK, buddy.

489
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,335
I will.

490
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:28,979
[eerie whispering]

491
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:52,033
Hello? Mr. Carver? It's Justin.

492
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,840
You need to come quick. It's about Ryan.

493
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,041
[Dan] Where are you, Justin?
Are you home?

494
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,777
Don't meet me here.

495
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,728
[Perri] Wouldn't it be easier
for Justin to kill Ezekiel?

496
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:16,028
[Carl] If he dies, Justin goes to
a home. That's not what he wants.

497
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,126
- [Jain] What does he want?
- A brother and a new father.

498
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:20,465
Detective Carver?

499
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,648
It's OK. It's all right.
T ell me everything.

500
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,208
But my dad...

501
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,777
I'll protect you, I promise.

502
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:39,982
I'm never gonna let him hurt you again.

503
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,591
I can show you where he is.

504
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:47,460
OK. All right, good boy.

505
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,604
- Did you find anything?
- No sign of Ryan.

506
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,540
But Justin's stuff is all packed.

507
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,475
Detective Carver's not answering.

508
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,276
- [police radio]
- [Jain] Wait! Listen...

509
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:07,944
...Detective Carver requests
emergency services, Ranch Road...

510
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,317
Ranch Road. I know where that is.

511
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,587
...and out. Which way, Justin?

512
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,754
What if my dad's there?

513
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,262
Don't worry about that, son.
I'll deal with him.

514
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,703
Ryan!

515
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,142
No!

516
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,039
No! No!

517
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,941
Help! Somebody help!

518
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,884
[yelling]

519
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:46,321
At this point, you believed
everything that Kolchak said?

520
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,723
I just wanted to find my son.

521
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,658
Ryan!

522
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,286
[Dan] Ryan!

523
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:01,799
No! No!

524
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,670
[yelling]

525
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:10,013
He did this.
He caused this pain, this suffering.

526
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,915
- I'm putting a stop to it.
- No!

527
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,748
[Mr. Seaver] I'm taking you back.

528
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,219
[screams]

529
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:18,346
No!

530
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:20,391
Kolchak had gotten inside your mind.

531
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,926
You were sure that this man was evil.

532
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,053
I thought he was gonna hurt my son.

533
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,990
[Dan] Get your hands off him!

534
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,499
- Get away from him!
- [Ryan screams]

535
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,685
[Ryan sobs]

536
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,603
I got there too late.

537
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:11,267
And this drawing that Justin allegedly

538
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,368
did during grief counseling,
you took it as proof?

539
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,936
It is proof,
that Justin set this whole thing up

540
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,710
so that Detective Carver
would kill Ezekiel.

541
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,480
Carver was cleared of any wrongdoing

542
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,612
in the shooting of Ezekiel Seaver.

543
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:29,490
The whole thing would have stopped,
right there, if you had let it.

544
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,793
[siren]

545
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,558
[Carl] Detective.

546
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,294
How can I help you, Mr. Kolchak?

547
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,166
I hear you've become
Justin's temporary guardian.

548
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,639
Yeah. I hope to make it permanent
after everything he's been through.

549
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,642
Everything we've been through.

550
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,940
Mr. Carver...

551
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:51,470
Justin may not be the innocent victim
you think he is.

552
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,945
What do you mean?

553
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:59,251
All those things that we thought
Ezekiel was doing,

554
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,257
I now think it was Justin.

555
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,590
So you admit it.
You put the idea inside his head.

556
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,027
No, I told him the truth!

557
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,997
You were trying to unbalance him.

558
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:09,726
He still wouldn't believe me.

559
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,869
If he had, maybe we wouldn't
be here right now.

560
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,567
We are here right now
because of you, Mr. Kolchak,

561
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,667
not despite you!

562
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,678
- I don't wanna hear this.
- Detective.

563
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:25,807
Look, he's a little boy
who stood up to an evil man.

564
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,784
- He helped me save my son.
- I only wish that were true.

565
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,822
I want you to stop bothering me
and my family.

566
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,722
You understand what that means,
Mr. Kolchak?

567
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,540
He tried to tell me that he was evil,

568
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,373
and I didn't believe him. Until...

569
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,140
Until what?

570
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,149
Until we got home and, uh...

571
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,479
Ryan started telling me
that he was afraid of Justin,

572
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,990
that Justin was gonna kill him.
And, uh...

573
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,526
and then I found this
packed in Justin's things,

574
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,028
and I finally knew.

575
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,464
That it was true.

576
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,558
That everything Kolchak
had told me was true.

577
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,900
Why didn't you tell somebody, Dan?

578
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:24,840
I didn't believe Kolchak,
why would anybody believe me?

579
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,241
- You won't believe me, even now.
- Dan...

580
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:31,475
I knew, that unless I did it,
Justin was gonna kill Ryan...

581
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,518
so he wouldn't have to share me
with anybody.

582
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,986
So I held him down...

583
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:43,893
and I put my hand over his mouth
so he couldn't scream,

584
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,929
and I slit his throat.

585
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,632
Using this?

586
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:56,804
Only, that's not how it happened, Dan.

587
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:02,309
You didn't find this in Justin's things.

588
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:06,116
Kolchak gave it to you.

589
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,048
He drew it himself,

590
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,486
and gave it to you
to prove that Justin was evil.

591
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:16,424
He told you to kill that poor,
defenseless little boy.

592
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,724
He tried to convince you that

593
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,630
that was the only way
to rid your house of this evil.

594
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:28,161
And in your confused, agitated state,
having just lost and regained your son,

595
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,572
having shot and killed the man
who abducted him...

596
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,074
you believed Kolchak's lies.

597
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,152
Isn't that right, Dan?

598
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,126
Isn't that right?

599
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,801
You're free to go.

600
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,866
After all that?

601
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,936
Do me a favor, Kolchak, get out.

602
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,441
I don't want to see your face again.

603
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:44,073
So you're, uh... you're taking
the blame for what happened?

604
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,845
It is my fault. No one else.

605
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,722
I have to ask you one more question,
Detective.

606
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,417
Yeah, what's that?

607
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,984
If you stabbed Justin to protect Ryan,

608
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:02,396
why would you kill him in the room
where you know your son would find him?

609
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,665
Like I said, I'm responsible.

610
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,071
You'll go to prison, Detective.

611
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:17,110
But I know who killed Justin Seaver.

612
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,580
And it wasn't you.

613
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:42,204
[Carl] Evil hides,
not just in darkness and shadows,

614
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,968
but in lies and deceit.

615
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:49,740
Abusing kindness, trust, compassion,

616
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,374
and turning the good against themselves.

617
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:57,251
So that the most kind-hearted
fail to recognize the danger until...

618
00:40:58,422 --> 00:40:59,912
it's too late.

619
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,659
[eerie whispers]
