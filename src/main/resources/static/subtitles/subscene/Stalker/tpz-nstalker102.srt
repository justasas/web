1
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:04,027
This is where Kolchak killed his wife.

2
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,969
- Of course, that's not his story.
- Carl!

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,370
[woman] Who was it?

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,534
He claimed whatever it was,
it wasn't human.

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,135
Pretty convenient,
killing his wife, leaving him alive.

6
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,681
Kolchak,
I didn't mean to get you arrested.

7
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,614
But you're not sure
I'm innocent either?

8
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,982
Her left hand.
She didn't have it before she died.

9
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,112
Why kill that woman
and take that little girl?

10
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,180
Why kill your wife and why not you?

11
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:28,455
All these strange deaths,
they're like pieces in a puzzle,

12
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,553
a puzzle I'm trying to put together.

13
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:37,967
[Carl] In nightmares, they intrude
from places beyond our imagining.

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,372
Demons, monsters, killers,

15
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,809
who strike with no remorse or reason.

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,245
In our waking hours,
we look over our shoulder,

17
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,680
out the corner of our eye,

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,685
alert to the stranger
who might attack without warning.

19
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:58,423
But in all our lives,
there is a greater danger,

20
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:02,621
one even more terrifying
for being unexpected.

21
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,492
Not the killer we fear,
but the killer we trust.

22
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,503
[man] Attababy, good hustle,
Crusher. Attaboy.

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,767
[man] Come on, Jeffrey!
Hit it hard, kid!

24
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,237
They're keeping him in?

25
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,246
It's his turn.
Come on, Jeffrey, you can do it!

26
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,339
I know,
but this could be terrible for him.

27
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,385
Sweetheart, he can do this.

28
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,853
[man watching]
Here you go, kid.

29
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,447
Come on, Jeffrey!
Hey, hit a fastball, huh!

30
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,253
Play ball!

31
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,927
Strike one!

32
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,089
- What are you doing?
- I can't bear to watch.

33
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,191
It's the last inning,
there are two outs. He can win this.

34
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,327
[man] Here you go.
Hit it hard, Jeffrey!

35
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,530
Strike two!

36
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,199
I have to go set up snow cones.
I'll watch from there.

37
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,208
Jane. Jane!

38
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,979
The boy's way out in front of the ball.

39
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,245
- Remember how I showed you?
- Back elbow up,

40
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,585
both eyes on the pitcher,
bring the bat back as he throws.

41
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,955
God, he looks so much like you did.

42
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:10,587
Dad, I'm really glad
you could be here for this.

43
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,367
You know what you have to do.

44
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,734
[chatter on outfield]

45
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,488
- [clapping]
- [man] Here you go, Jeffrey.

46
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,089
Doug.

47
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,869
Go on! Go on!

48
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,137
- Safe!
- [cheering]

49
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,721
[children chant]

50
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,849
Jeffrey! Jeffrey! Jeffrey!

51
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,010
Weapon used
was an aluminum baseball bat.

52
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,852
Mrs. Linman was pronounced dead
at the scene.

53
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,983
Now, uh, on a personal note,

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,551
and owing to the fact I know
I'm gonna get this question

55
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,429
from at least one of you,
yes, I do know the defendant well.

56
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,161
Doug Linman has served this city
for over nine years.

57
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,397
He's a loyal and dedicated prosecutor.

58
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:02,100
This is a hard day... for all of us.

59
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,242
- Questions?
- [man] Detective!

60
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,612
Will Mr. Linman be given special
treatment by your department?

61
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:14,210
I'm not sure that even merits
an answer, but no. Absolutely not.

62
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,551
- Perri.
- Could you describe the relationship

63
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,615
between Mr. Linman and his wife?
Any marriage difficulties?

64
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,661
- Any previous acts of violence?
- None that I know of.

65
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,062
At this point I can't speculate
on state of mind or motive.

66
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,100
Have you looked at Mr. Linman's claim

67
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,965
that he was visited
by a dead man prior to the murder?

68
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,369
- Come again?
- In the statement you made,

69
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,237
Mr. Linman claims that he was
visited at the baseball field

70
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,867
by his father, Robert Linman.

71
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,640
Except that Robert Linman
died seven years ago.

72
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,045
Exactly. He did. What's your point?

73
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,778
Were there any other witnesses
who saw Robert Linman?

74
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:49,515
He'd be a balding man,
largish ears, five-nine, five-ten.

75
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,955
Uh, excuse me, who are you?

76
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,550
Carl Kolchak. I'm with the Beacon.

77
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,463
Next question.

78
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,199
- Hey, partner.
- Hey.

79
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,175
Sounded like you had your hands full.

80
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:15,237
No kidding. You ever hear
of that reporter, Carl Kolchak?

81
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,374
His editor is gonna get
an earful from me.

82
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,884
Ghosts?
Is that what you ask detectives about?

83
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,715
I don't recall saying "ghosts."

84
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,222
- No. "Dead man. Largish ears."
- I did say that.

85
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,782
Even if I didn't know the Linmans, l'd
have a hard time finding the humor.

86
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm not making light, Tony.

87
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,627
I want to know why a man
suddenly bashes his wife's head in,

88
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,360
claiming his dead father made him.

89
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:37,403
God, isn't it obvious? He snapped.
It happens every day.

90
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,904
But why say his father
directed him to kill her?

91
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,668
I don't know, Carl.
Maybe he just broke from reality.

92
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,767
A man doesn't just break from reality,

93
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,506
kill his wife, then tell
some crazy story to explain it.

94
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,711
OK...

95
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,253
Then maybe he didn't break from reality.

96
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:59,917
Maybe this is a story he's concocting
to service as an insanity defense.

97
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,393
He's a prosecutor. Don't you think
he'd come up with a better story?

98
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,557
Ask him yourself. His attorney called.
Doug wants to talk.

99
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:09,499
And not to bolster
some kind of insanity plea.

100
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,730
He intends to plead guilty.

101
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,397
[buzzer]

102
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,036
[metal clanking]

103
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,512
I met her my first year in law school.

104
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,607
I married her the day I passed the bar.
T o celebrate.

105
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,885
I love my wife.

106
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,518
I love...

107
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,590
I need you to write that.
I need you to tell them. T ell my son.

108
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,598
They won't even let me see him.

109
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,260
Mr. Linman, talk us through
that day at the ballpark.

110
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,398
I did it.

111
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,532
I murdered her.

112
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,069
I still don't know why.

113
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,547
You told the police
you saw your deceased father.

114
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,848
Yes. Several times.

115
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,516
Before. But not since.

116
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,454
Did you think it was strange seeing him?

117
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,554
No.

118
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:15,260
It felt so... It just felt right.

119
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,070
I've missed him so much
in the last few years.

120
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,970
When he started to...

121
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:28,076
to visit me,
it was kind of like a dream.

122
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:32,083
You know?
In a dream, it feels natural.

123
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,119
Did he tell you to kill your wife?

124
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,117
Yes.

125
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,888
No, I mean, he didn't say, "Kill Jane."

126
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,261
He said to me,
"You know what you have to do."

127
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,827
And somehow I did.

128
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:57,968
I have to ask you, Mr. Linman.
Why are you pleading guilty?

129
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,343
I mean, you don't appear to me
to be delusional.

130
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,008
- Do you think you are?
- What else would I be?

131
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,608
I'm not sure,
but I think you owe it to your wife

132
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:11,419
to find out if someone else,
or if something else, is responsible.

133
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,288
[buzzer]

134
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,688
Can I ask you two
to step outside, please?

135
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,692
Now.

136
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,105
You're leading him down a path
he doesn't want to go.

137
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,671
He wants to plead guilty.

138
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,912
We're just asking questions,
Detective Granof.

139
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,318
Perri, you've always been
a stand-up reporter,

140
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,083
so I'm gonna be nice about this.

141
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,987
I don't care who your boss knows,

142
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,425
you'll have no further access
to Doug Linman. Understood?

143
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,333
I'm thinking I'm understanding
what this whole thing is about.

144
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,134
Why you're interested in this case.

145
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,072
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

146
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,667
Have you seen the autopsy photos
of Linman's wife?

147
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,009
Yeah, I have.
And there's no mark on her wrist.

148
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,943
I'm not going to let this go.
There's something deeper here.

149
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,728
[man's voice]
You know what you have to do.

150
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,358
You know what you have to do.

151
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,425
You know what you have to do.

152
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,033
You know what you have to do.

153
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,165
You know what you have to do.

154
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,107
You know what you have to do.

155
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,050
What's this?

156
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,921
Doug Linman's effects. His attorney
let me take a look through them.

157
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,460
Didn't Detective Granof
just tell you to back off?

158
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,190
No, he said
we couldn't talk to Linman.

159
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,755
He didn't say
"You can't go through his stuff."

160
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,892
And what exactly
do you expect to find?

161
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,062
- You'll laugh.
- I won't laugh.

162
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,001
Everything Doug Linman described:

163
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,406
the dreamlike state,
the compulsion to act,

164
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,468
even the appearance of a loved one,
matches records of...

165
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,738
spirit possession.

166
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,979
Sorry. Spirit possession.

167
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:24,216
You think Linman just jotted
all this down in his day-planner?

168
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,124
No. But there may be evidence
here of a trigger.

169
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,923
What do you mean by "trigger?"

170
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,932
Possessions usually take place
at a time of personal crisis,

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,490
so anything can be a trigger.

172
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,503
A bankruptcy filing,
a diagnosis from the doctor...

173
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,106
[sighs] But there's nothing here.

174
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,143
The only unusual reference is "AC, DC."

175
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:49,272
AC, DC? The band, battery,
or the sexual preference?

176
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,009
None of the above.

177
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,575
It's an appointment he underlined.
1 1 am, last Thursday.

178
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,483
What?

179
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,195
"AC, DC" stands for
"Appellate Court, Damon Caylor."

180
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:09,792
I happen to know he filed a writ
of habeas corpus there last Thursday.

181
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,666
Well, who's Damon Caylor?

182
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,470
Caylor was sort of
a Charles Manson wannabe.

183
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,912
He recruited lost souls
and persuaded them

184
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,712
that society was corrupt
and needed to be wiped clean.

185
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,515
By "wiped clean,"
I gather you mean killing people?

186
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,782
Specifically, the moral hypocrites.

187
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,189
They managed to kill one so-called
"hypocrite" before being arrested,

188
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,094
but they hacked off
the head of an oil executive

189
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,632
in a Palos Verdes
supermarket parking lot.

190
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,224
Nice.

191
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,436
And you covered Caylor's trial.

192
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,633
Linman prosecuted.

193
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,609
They never got him for the murder
his followers committed,

194
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:55,306
but he was convicted on a separate
charge of strangling his wife, T eresa.

195
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,144
Wait a sec,
look what you wrote here.

196
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,915
"Linman claimed Caylor possessed
his followers to commit murder."

197
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,683
He wasn't talking
about a literal possession.

198
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,553
Huh. Maybe he was.

199
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,890
No! Wai... Carl!

200
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,125
Linman was using the word "possession"
as a metaphor.

201
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,966
Maybe, but what if Caylor metaphorically
possessed his followers to kill,

202
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:21,063
and now, somehow, literally directed
Linman to do the same?

203
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,474
Caylor indoctrinated weak-minded people
over a period of months, even years.

204
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,774
It'd be a pretty neat trick
to do the same thing

205
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,042
to a prosecutor
from inside his jail cell.

206
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,447
It would, wouldn't it?

207
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,951
If Caylor is involved,
and I'm not saying he is,

208
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,544
why not consider
the more likely scenario?

209
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,453
Which is?

210
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,924
His old followers, from the outside.

211
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,291
Maybe he directed them to take revenge.

212
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:46,559
Either way, we need to find out.

213
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,623
We've got to get back in
to see Doug Linman.

214
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,568
- Can't.
- We can talk to the warden.

215
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,502
No, I mean, we can't.

216
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,436
Doug Linman is dead.

217
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,168
He hung himself in his cell
early this morning.

218
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,917
That's why he agreed to talk.

219
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,886
He intended the interview
to be his final statement.

220
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,281
[buzzer]

221
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:13,985
[metal scraping]

222
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,890
Thank you for seeing us so quickly.

223
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,623
Oh... not a problem.
Caylor doesn't get many visitors.

224
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,688
Not since he's been confined
to solitary.

225
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,427
[Perri] When was his last visitor?

226
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:25,766
There was only one, months ago,
uh, February maybe.

227
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,738
- Can I get a name?
- I can get you that.

228
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,900
What did Caylor do
to end up in solitary?

229
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,274
Well, it's what he said,
not what he did. I thought you knew.

230
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,074
Knew what?

231
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,081
Caylor made a lot of enemies here.

232
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,710
He told the prisoners they were
all worthless, a bunch of cowards.

233
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,811
Last year,
he was attacked in the kitchen.

234
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,187
Somebody threw hot oil in his face.
Permanently blinded him.

235
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,850
Caylor's blind?

236
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,862
You see why we can't put him
back in the general population.

237
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,764
Half the gangs in here still have
a standing death order against him.

238
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,395
Mark here will be outside
the whole time.

239
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,030
- That's, uh, if you need him.
- Thanks.

240
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,606
Carl.

241
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,736
- Just, uh...
- What?

242
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:13,682
- I thought I could do it.
- What are you talking about?

243
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,380
I covered Caylor's trial
for six months and...

244
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,186
He's shackled and blind.

245
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,457
I need you to interview him
without me. Sorry.

246
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,121
[buzzer]

247
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,863
[keys jangle]

248
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:33,734
[metal clanks]

249
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,640
- Where is she?
- Who?

250
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,408
They said Perri Reed was coming.
Where is she?

251
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:45,348
She's not coming.
My name is Carl Kolchak...

252
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:49,376
I know who you are.
But I agreed to talk to her, not you.

253
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,348
Are you doing that?

254
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,189
You certainly have
an active imagination, Mr. Kolchak.

255
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,162
Why don't you check the batteries?

256
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,027
They're new.

257
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,567
What is it that you wanted to ask,
Mr. Kolchak?

258
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,195
What's the angle of your story?

259
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,398
The prosecutor who put you away...

260
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,304
He's dead.

261
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,243
I heard.

262
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,212
You're in solitary, Mr. Caylor.
How did you know that?

263
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,011
It's a prison. You hear things.

264
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,142
And you're not sorry he's dead.

265
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,915
You mean like all the people
you quote in your paper?

266
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,422
"He seemed so normal.
Such a good father."

267
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,356
I don't grieve for hypocrites.

268
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,190
You'd seen Mr. Linman recently,
hadn't you?

269
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,628
I don't see anyone anymore.

270
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,727
He opposed my writ of habeas corpus,
and it was denied.

271
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:42,137
- So this was revenge?
- I don't understand.

272
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,870
Oh, I think you do.
You're known as a powerful manipulator.

273
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,972
See, I think that you somehow directed
Doug Linman to kill his wife.

274
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:52,415
My followers were weak-minded.

275
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,982
Directing a prosecutor
would be a pretty neat trick...

276
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,149
from inside my cell.

277
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,825
"You know what you have to do."
What does it mean?

278
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:13,994
It means all of those
who belong in hell will find their way.

279
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,733
- He did it.
- Wait, he told you that?

280
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,609
No, but he... he knew things
he shouldn't have.

281
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,648
If there's one thing he's capable of,

282
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,207
it's manipulating you
into believing he's guilty.

283
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,947
Then why not come right out and say it?
Why play coy?

284
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,512
He's a manipulator. World-class.

285
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,218
Look, I don't know
what kind of game he's playing,

286
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,693
but I have no doubt in my mind
he's playing one.

287
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:40,220
Ah, if this is a game,
is it over? Or is it just starting?

288
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,198
[whistle, cheering]

289
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,939
Boys, no running in the house!

290
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,606
And wash up! Dinner in 1 5 minutes!

291
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,979
Collin, can you turn that down, please?

292
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,286
Collin! Can you turn that down, please?!

293
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,059
Mommy. Look what I made.

294
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,603
OK, sweetie. Get cleaned up.

295
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,071
Mommy, you didn't look! Mommy!

296
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,166
OK, honey, I'm sorry. I'm looking.

297
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,366
[voices on police radio]

298
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:05,308
"You know what you have to do."

299
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,921
Yeah.

[chatter]

301
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,762
Press is supposed to be back
behind the police tape.

302
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,930
I'm not asking for a statement,
Detective.

303
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,064
- I need to talk to you.
- Not now.

304
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,701
I believe there's a connection
between this murder

305
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,870
and the murder
of Doug Linman's wife.

306
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,979
Why do you say that?

307
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,483
Amanda Daniels
is a highly respected judge.

308
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,883
Doug Linman a top prosecutor.

309
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,923
Both of them presided
at the trial of Damon Caylor.

310
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,083
What's Caylor have to do with anything?

311
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,822
You arrested Caylor, Detective.
I mean, you know he's a manipulator,

312
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,160
that he directed his followers to kill.

313
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,723
Caylor is in prison, Mr. Kolchak.

314
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,530
Yeah, but both Linman and Daniels

315
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:01,130
claimed they were directed to kill
by loved ones they lost.

316
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,604
Judge Daniels only shared that
with me and my partner.

317
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,408
- How did you know?
- I didn't. But it's true, isn't it?

318
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,179
She claims she saw the image
of her six-year-old daughter,

319
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,122
who was killed
in a drunk-driving accident last year.

320
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,421
Then how do you explain that?

321
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,791
I can't. And neither can you.

322
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,990
Detective, you testified
against Caylor at his trial.

323
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,532
Yeah, so?

324
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,865
Have you had any visions
of a dead parent, a child...

325
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,235
a family member you loved or miss?

326
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,211
I think they need to start
upping your medication, Kolchak.

327
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,110
All right? And soon.

328
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,280
He's just not willing to believe.

329
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,346
Yeah, neither will Perri.

330
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,861
- What do you mean?
- Perri. Didn't she tell you?

331
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,226
T ell me what?

332
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,322
The role she played
in Caylor's conviction.

333
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,627
What role?

334
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:07,065
Linman couldn't prosecute Caylor
for the crimes his followers committed.

335
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,198
Not until Perri interviewed
Caylor's wife,

336
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,573
who admitted
that he directed them to kill.

337
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,669
That's why Caylor killed his wife?

338
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,442
The day Perri's story was published.

339
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,821
Katrina Ortega?

340
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,355
Yes.

341
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,522
I'm Perri Reed. I'm a reporter.

342
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:36,432
From the Beacon.
I remember you. At the trial.

343
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,230
I'd like to talk to you
about Damon Caylor.

344
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,753
You shouldn't... I...

345
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,757
I can get in trouble
if you come back here.

346
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,884
Katrina,
I think Caylor's getting revenge

347
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,053
on the judge and the prosecutor
who tried him.

348
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,689
- I don't know anything about that.
- I think you do.

349
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,926
- Me?
- Yeah, according to the warden,

350
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:13,404
you visited Caylor in prison
six months ago. Why?

351
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,372
Because I couldn't say no.

352
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,567
How's that for an answer?

353
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:21,010
After two years
of deprogramming and lithium,

354
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,570
when he called, I still came running.

355
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,380
Did he ask you to do anything for him?
T o contact anyone?

356
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,114
No. He just said he was done with us.

357
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,622
That he didn't need any of us anymore.

358
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,585
But he didn't say why.

359
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,324
He's blind, but he still sees, you know?

360
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:44,024
Not with his eyes. He sees inside you.

361
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:48,562
People you love, people you miss.

362
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,700
That's how he'd get us
to do things for him.

363
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:56,476
Get inside our heads and
then use our own memories against us.

364
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,539
Confuse us.

365
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:03,414
If the police didn't stop us,
it would have been my turn.

366
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,515
I would have killed someone, too.
Someone like you.

367
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,758
He hates you, you know. All of you.

368
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,925
He blames you
for turning his wife against him.

369
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:21,405
His hate is like this flame
burning in his heart.

370
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:27,275
It'll never go out.
Not until you're all dead.

371
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,022
You asked to see me.

372
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,891
I heard about poor Judge Daniels.

373
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,401
1 7 years of marriage down the drain.

374
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,700
So you're admitting it.
That you directed her to kill.

375
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:01,837
I have a message
the people need to hear.

376
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,508
I want it printed.
On the front page of the Beacon.

377
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:09,543
Do that, and I feel certain
the killings will stop.

378
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,249
- You're blackmailing us?
- I'm simply trying to help.

379
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,217
Why would I believe
you'd keep your word?

380
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:20,355
I've learned more about you
since our last visit, Mr. Kolchak.

381
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:22,900
About the death of your wife, lrene.

382
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,232
The bizarre story you told the police.

383
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,964
How did you know that?

384
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,337
The point is,
you're someone I can deal with.

385
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,606
Someone who understands loss,
like I do.

386
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,044
- I'm not like you.
- But you are.

387
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,048
These other people are hypocrites.

388
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:42,246
Claiming to be virtuous, when their real
interest is advancing their careers,

389
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,383
buying bigger houses, newer cars,
taking vacations in Hawaii and Aspen.

390
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,056
Not you.

391
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,791
You're in this for yourself,
and you admit it.

392
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,457
I respect that.

393
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:58,401
I didn't murder my wife.
You murdered yours.

394
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:03,737
I loved my wife,
as deeply as you loved yours.

395
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,969
But they confused her
into turning against me.

396
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,207
I hated what they made me do.

397
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,944
You're responsible
for your wife's death. No one else.

398
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,714
Just as Doug Linman
is responsible for his wife.

399
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,919
And Judge Daniels for her husband.

400
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,289
And the same for all of those
who will follow.

401
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,592
Let them live with that pain.
If they can.

402
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:34,598
I have one more condition.

403
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,206
He'll only give it to Perri?

404
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:40,438
Yeah, he said he's offended
by her refusal to see him.

405
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,811
I won't let this newspaper
become a mouthpiece for a lunatic.

406
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:47,010
- What do we tell Caylor?
- T ell him to shove it.

407
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,211
What?

408
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,516
You believed he was responsible
for the deaths.

409
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,717
Yeah, I do. I think Caylor's
loss of eyesight and time alone

410
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,556
have allowed him to strengthen his mind,
to focus it.

411
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,995
So you really think he's become some
kind of homicidal Amazing Kreskin?

412
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,660
- You can't doubt he's involved.
- I don't. Just not the way you think.

413
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:08,297
Point is, if we don't print his
manifesto, he'll keep killing people.

414
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,137
And I think he will, even if we do.
Perri said it.

415
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,643
Caylor's a games player.
This is part of a game.

416
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,839
Why didn't he try to influence her?
Or Granof?

417
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,348
Maybe he did.
We need to contact Granof's partner...

418
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,646
- Granof doesn't have a partner.
- Sure he does.

419
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:24,587
No. Glen Mitchell died six months ago.
He never got a new one.

420
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,716
Granof said he was
at the crime scene this morning.

421
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,726
- Hey, Pat. Wait up.
- Hey. What's going on?

422
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,462
We just had a disturbance call.
4400 Cloverdale.

423
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,664
4400 Cloverdale? That's my address.

424
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,197
I know.
You know what you have to do.

425
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,845
Thanks. They think he went home.
He's not picking up his cell.

426
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:50,279
I'll get the address.

427
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,711
[loud music through earphones]

428
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,673
[tires screech]

429
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,385
[beep]

430
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,391
- [rapid knocking]
- [Carl] Hello!

431
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,503
[cocks trigger]

432
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,005
- [gunshot]
- [beep]

433
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,068
What is this? What?

434
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,905
Pat?

435
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,179
[buzzer]

436
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,462
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this?

437
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,660
- I have to.
- No, you don't.

438
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:55,570
If Granof killed his wife
because I couldn't go in there...

439
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,970
- Guard.
- [keys jangle, gate clatters]

440
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,880
Please. Sit, Miss Reed.

441
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:15,051
You got what you wanted.
She's here. Now give it to us.

442
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:16,787
I said, sit.

443
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,193
Who do you think you're talking to?

444
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,996
It's all right.

445
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,831
I'm grateful you came this evening,
Miss Reed.

446
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,436
I know how hard it was for you
to walk into this room.

447
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,748
Oh, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
You're afraid of me.

448
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,342
Yes, I am.

449
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,911
Strange, isn't it?

450
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:49,949
Well, after all, I'm shackled.
A blind man. But you know why?

451
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,894
It's because I can't see you,

452
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:57,264
but I can see... who you are.

453
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:01,795
You can see, Caylor.
But what you see, you twist.

454
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,240
I should've been a reporter.

455
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:10,812
However you're doing it,
we want the killings to stop.

456
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:24,050
Print it on the front page
of the Beacon. As is.

457
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:28,532
No editor's commentary.
No explanation.

458
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,536
Does your editor
agree to these conditions?

459
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,595
I suppose he'll have to.

460
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,071
Good.

461
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,992
I know what you love!
I know what you fear!

462
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,154
[Carl] Let go! Guards!

463
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,494
I know... what you have to do.

464
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,018
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

465
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,056
This some kind of joke?

466
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,858
What?

467
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,161
It's empty. The whole thing.

468
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:38,134
But I don't understand.
Why would he give us a blank book?

469
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:45,642
Because you were right. This was a game
and you were the prize.

470
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:48,006
Me?

471
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,172
Remember Doug Linman's day-planner?

472
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:54,378
AC-DC? The day of Caylor's
appellate court hearing?

473
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:57,546
Caylor filed a motion
knowing that it would be denied.

474
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,953
Why would he do that?

475
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,891
Because he knew that Linman,
Judge Daniels and Granof would be there.

476
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,124
I don't understand what this has to do
with an empty notebook.

477
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,860
What if Caylor needed to see his victims
in order to control them.

478
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,095
- T o "see" them?
- Yeah, to be with them,

479
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,866
to be near them.
So he could see inside their heads.

480
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,136
He lied about this because
he knew it would put him in contact

481
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:22,976
with the one victim
he couldn't claim until now. You.

482
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,624
Thanks.

483
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,762
I see you looking at me.

484
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,200
- Huh?
- I can see you, Jain.

485
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:02,720
- Stop it!
- I'm, I'm worried about you.

486
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,847
Go away. T oday.

487
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,687
OK.

488
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,901
- How's she doing?
- She seems agitated.

489
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,469
What if she stabs me with her
letter opener when I'm not looking?

490
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,873
Well, I think she'll only
go after people she loves, Jain,

491
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,536
so you're pretty safe.

492
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,773
Yeah. But what did Granof say?

493
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,575
Well, he's agreed to ask the warden
to send Caylor

494
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:37,485
to a deep isolation facility
in upstate Michigan, so...

495
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,455
Will moving him
make any difference?

496
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,355
I don't know.

497
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,293
I'm gonna, um, catch you later.

498
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,927
How are you feeling?

499
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:51,833
The way you and Jain keep staring at me,
like the most popular girl at the prom.

500
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,633
Yeah, I don't think Jain
wants the next dance, though.

501
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,569
- How's Granof?
- Better.

502
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,237
Uh, the doctor gave him
some anti-anxiety pills.

503
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,406
Which brings me to something
I wanted to discuss with you.

504
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:06,776
Medication.

505
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:10,079
- No. No.
- Just hear me out.

506
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,248
- I'm not taking any drugs, Kolchak!
- It's just sleeping pills.

507
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,816
If you're asleep, you pose no danger
to yourself or anyone else.

508
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:19,988
Look, I'm not gonna hurt anyone, OK?
I'm not seeing anybody.

509
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:24,865
- Yeah, that's just what Granof thought.
- How long am I supposed to be asleep?

510
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:28,099
Just until morning. Until the warden
gets Caylor out of state.

511
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,436
And what possible difference
does that make?

512
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:33,476
Look, I don't know,
but it's worth a try.

513
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,603
Did Jain take my letter opener?

514
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:41,880
Perri. Look, if you won't do it
for yourself, do it for your parents.

515
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,655
Do it for anyone you love.

516
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:55,330
I can't express enough how much
I hate the idea of this whole thing.

517
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,396
Think of it as a vacation
from your problems.

518
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,461
That's not funny.

519
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,032
- I feel like Caylor won.
- No. He hasn't.

520
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,845
He has.

521
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,378
He got inside my head.

522
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,387
I'm afraid to go to sleep.

523
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,827
- Afraid of what I'll dream.
- I'm gonna be right here. OK?

524
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,286
You know what you have to do.

525
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:55,086
You know what you have to do.

526
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,320
You know what you have to do.

527
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,761
You know what you have to do.

528
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,892
You know what you have to do.
You know what you have to do.

529
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,649
You know what you have to do.

530
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,690
You know what you have to do.
[echoes]

531
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,588
[knocking]

532
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,075
Irene?

533
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,757
[exhales sharply]

534
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,696
You know what you have to do.

535
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,534
You know what you have to do.

536
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,733
It can't be.

537
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,007
I know how much you've missed me.

538
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,675
The way I've missed you.

539
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,791
[Caylor's voice]
You know what you have to do.

540
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,833
You know what you have to do.

541
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,391
You know what you have to do.

542
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,936
I can't get through to Kolchak.

543
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:51,168
- He's not picking up?
- No. Not at Perri's or his cell phone.

544
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,869
Caylor might have tricked us.

545
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:54,935
- You know what you have to do.
- [T ony] How?

546
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:58,038
[Jain] Kolchak spent more time with him
than any one of us.

547
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:01,744
What if he couldn't get to Reed?
So, he got to him instead.

548
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,310
You get down there, I'll call Granof.

549
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,650
OK.

550
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,987
You know what you have to do.

551
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,357
You know what you have to do.

552
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,588
It's not there.

553
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,204
It can be just like it was.

554
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,899
Before you were lost
and searching for answers.

555
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,976
When your life still belonged to you.

556
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,378
- Granof.
- Pat, it's, uh, T ony Vincenzo.

557
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,543
Could you some officers
over to Perri Reed's apartment?

558
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,018
Yeah, of course, but why?

559
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,716
We're afraid some of Caylor's followers
might target her next.

560
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,951
She doesn't need to worry about Caylor.

561
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:45,621
I've been talking to the warden and
we're transferring him a little early.

562
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,568
What do I have to do?

563
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,305
Hmm, you know what you have to do.

564
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,711
[? The Veils: More Heat Than Light]

565
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:18,060
? The Imperial disaster's

566
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,792
? In furious decline

567
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,334
? They've been burnin' down the ghettos

568
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,097
? Burnin ' down the ghettos

569
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,764
? Crossin ' all of the lines

570
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,607
? Everyone gets so excited...

571
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,908
You know what you have to do.

572
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,141
You know what you have to do.

573
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,342
You know what you have to do.

574
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,477
You know what you have to do.

575
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,488
?... heat than light
More heat than light... ?

576
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,114
You know what you have to do.

577
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:49,214
Perri!

578
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,793
[banging on door]

579
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,729
Kolchak!

580
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,294
You know what you have to do.

581
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:00,337
You know what you have to do.

582
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:01,871
You know what you have to do.

00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:05,102
You know what you have to do.
You know what you have to do.

584
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,768
[Jain, knocking] Kolchak!

585
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,202
You know what you have to do.

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,408
You know what you have to do.
You know what you have to do.

587
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,451
You know what you have to do.

588
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,953
Kolchak! Open the door!

589
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,218
- Kolchak!
- You know what you have to do.

590
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,887
You know what you have to do.
You know what you have to do.

00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,894
You know what you have to do.
You know what you have to do.

592
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,267
[lrene] You know what you have to do.

593
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,197
[Jain] Perri!

594
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:43,538
- What's going on out here?
- Call the cops! Now!

595
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,208
You know what you have to do.
You know what you have to do.

596
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:48,683
You know what you have to do.
You know what you have to do.

597
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,744
[Caylor] You know what you have to do.

598
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:56,158
You know what you have to do.

599
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,027
You know what you have to do.

600
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,099
[alarm]

601
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:11,605
Open the door!

602
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,701
Open the door!

603
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,542
Kolchak!

604
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:02,091
He did what he said, it was done.

605
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,923
In less than a minute.

606
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,485
- Hey.
- Hey.

607
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:12,230
- Uh,... you can have this back now.
- Thanks.

608
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,362
- I took it.
- I know.

609
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,744
- So...
- We don't have to talk about it.

610
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,673
You saw her last night, didn't you?

611
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,649
I saw...

612
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,545
saw what he wanted me to see.

613
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,282
You OK?

614
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,850
Yeah.

615
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,963
Good.

616
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:01,441
[Carl] I spend long hours
looking outside for answers.

617
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:09,088
But there is a deeper understanding,
hidden inside.

618
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,922
About the darkness
that resides in each of us,

619
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:20,602
and how far we would go
to get back what we can never recover.
