[man] You were late.
Missed your chance.

00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,800
[Carl] You said he could help me
find what killed my wife.

4
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,399
[man] He still can.

T rucker picked up a hitcher
matching Kolchak's witness.

Dropped him off near Koreatown.

00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,182
She has a dream.
She will meet a man in need.

8
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:23,381
She will help this man.
She will open her heart to him.

9
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:24,855
She will find peace.

10
00:00:24,924 --> 00:00:26,789
Turns out that our missing witness

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,886
is an undercover DEA agent
by the name of Victor Caleca.

12
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:33,694
They want him for the same reason they
wanted you, the night your wife died.

13
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,031
He's driving home with his wife,
and wham!

14
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:39,230
Something slams into them.
She still hasn't been found.

15
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,500
This Agent Caleca's wife,
she's dead, right?

16
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,132
- Right.
- Well then, who's this?

17
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,837
[woman] It's Linda.
I haven't heard from Victor in days.

18
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,504
She's alive.

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,981
Justice Department is filing suit
to make Kolchak reveal his source.

20
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,279
He won't.

21
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,842
- There is another way.
- Me.

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,514
- I need to know who you are.
- I can't help you.

23
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,887
- I need answers.
- We won't be speaking again.

24
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,688
- You don't know his name.
- The information was good.

25
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:05,492
Do you know how reckless that is?
I don't know who you are, Carl.

26
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,432
- What did you find?
- Two calls placed to Agent Walton

27
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,992
in the past 48 hours
from a market in Koreatown.

28
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,936
OK. You'd better get down there.

29
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,473
You're under arrest.

30
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:47,129

- He's not picking up?

32
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,968
- Speaking.
- Where's Jain?

33
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,775
I'm not supposed to say.

34
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,475
Where is he?

35
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,644
Are you the boss?

36
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,314
I promised I wouldn't tell,
but he went to Koreatown.

37
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,550
- What for?
- Kolchak sent him.

38
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,819
What is it?

39
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,418
That's why I was looking for Jain.
T o take pictures.

40
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:14,024

- A double homicide. In Koreatown.

Jain, what happened?

48
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,021
I talked to him, Agent Caleca,
just before they killed him.

49
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,323
Victor Caleca?

50
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,793
- Did he send you?
- What did he say?

51
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,831
He said he was expecting
Agent Walton, not me.

52
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,357
He had just spoken to him on the phone.

53
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,700
Agent Walton was already dead.

54
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:04,107
I know. I told him that.
Then he said "It's a trap."

55
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,510

I guess that man
was already hiding in there.

59
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,353
So I hid under the cot.

60
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,057
Did you get a look at them?

61
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,862

- Yeah, just like that.
- I don't understand.

80
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,246

Yeah, something like that.

whose name you didn't even know.

You know me too well.

Or rather you don't know me at all.

No. I don't think I do.

101

I, uh... went a little crazy
the last few days.

102
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,920
- I don't expect you to forgive me.
- Good. Because I don't.

103
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,731
I wish I could explain it.

104
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:10,006
I can only say that I thought
I was close to answers

105
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,915
about what killed my wife.

106
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,317
- And now?
- Now...

107
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:21,315
Hopes raised, then dashed
are cruel indeed.

108
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:32,096
And what if I told you...
I could raise them again?

109
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,210
Kolchak! Hey, man.

110
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,540
You OK?

111
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,312
Vincenzo said you nearly got shot.
Are you OK?

112
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,683
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry.

113
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,088
I know how much finding this guy
Caleca meant to you.

114
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,424
- Yeah.
- But we think we found something else.

115
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,622
- You mean, we think I found it.
- What is it?

116
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:02,532
Before he died, Caleca's supervisor,
Agent Walton, told us a story.

117
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,264
Caleca survived an attack
while driving in a storm.

118
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:09,434
An attack in which his wife Linda
was killed. Sound familiar?

119
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,135
You know it does.

120
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,144
Only, unlike your wife,

121
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,079
Walton told us that Linda Caleca's
body was never found.

122
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:19,083
And that, my friends, was a big fat lie.

123
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,120
- You found her body?
- I found her. Alive.

124
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,851
I got this off that guy Walton's
throwaway cell phone.

125
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,359
It's Linda.
I know I'm not supposed to call,

126
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,885
but I haven't heard from Victor in days.
I'm scared, Rich.

127
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,432
- I'll try you again later.
- She's on the run.

128
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,596
If we can find her, she might be able to
give us the answers you're looking for.

129
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:42,004
I'm on it. That call was placed
from a pay phone in San Bernardino.

130
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,167
A pay phone?
Then how can you track her?

131
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,177
I've got some other tricks up my sleeve.

132
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,510
What about this source of yours?
The one who told you about Caleca.

133
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,573
I told you, I don't know who he is.

134
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,949
- You never saw him? Never met him?
- No.

135
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,580
There was just this house
that he sent me to.

136
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,953
Where?

138
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,959
I thought you said this was the place.

139
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,462
It is. I'm sure of it.

140
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,397
Then... where's the house?

141
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,936
[Jain] Do you think
someone could've moved it?

142
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,544
The whole house? In 48 hours?

143
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,205
Like on Home Makeover?

144
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,012
He said if I answered Caleca's
questions, I'd answer my own.

145
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,748
Carl, this house was never here.

146
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,450
The cell phone you say
you spoke to this source on...

147
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,515
- never activated.
- What are you saying?

148
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,585
Could you have been tipped off
some other kind of way?

149
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,654
By a police source of some kind?

150
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,462
A drug informant
who told you to look for Caleca.

151
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:19,766
What? And then I just twisted it
in my head? Imagined this source?

152
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,036
You're forgetting. Kolchak
wasn't the only one hearing voices.

153
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,907
- Who else?
- Agent Caleca.

154
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,242
He told me he spoke to
Agent Walton on the phone,

155
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,179
when Walton was already dead.

156
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,342
[Perri] It's possible Walton was alive.

157
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,717
Maybe he wasn't. And maybe
this isn't all in Kolchak's head.

158
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,779
Maybe there's something to this.

Oh, no, no, no.
We don't want to buy anything.

162
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,771
We just want to talk. Are you OK?

OK. Yes.

165
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,311
She doesn't want to stay here
any longer. T oo much death.

166
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,979
- Where will she go?
- With me.

00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,956
I have a house by the sea.
North of here.

Dae, this is Carl Kolchak.

169
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,164
He needs to ask some questions
about the man who was here.

Victor Caleca.

171
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,137

00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,777
She did not know he was married.

175
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,714
[speaks Korean]

176
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,746
- He said a name in his sleep.
- Linda.

177
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,289
Yeah. Linda.
Look, we need to find her.

178
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,756
We think the men who came here
are looking for her.

179
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,522
[speaks Korean]

180
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,527
She doesn't know anything about her.

181
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:58,126
OK. Thank you.

182
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,438
- She said there is something.
- [Dae speaks Korean]

183
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,778
He used to wear it
around his wrist.

184
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,841
[Dae speaks Korean]

185
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,387
It meant as much to him
as her wedding photos meant to her.

186
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,226
She wants you to keep it.

187
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,688
You say he wore it on his wrist.

188
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,995
Did you ever happen to see
if there was a mark there?

189
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,799
[speaks Korean]

190
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,840
It would've been like a birthmark.

191
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,876
Red. Shaped like a snake.

192
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,877
[woman speaks Korean]

193
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,208
No. She saw no mark.

194
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,551
Thanks.

195
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,321
[woman] This is where I'll be.

196
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,226
If you find this woman.

197
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:03,394
If there's anything we can do
to help her, please tell us.

198
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,802
We will. Thank you.

199
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,176
You want to tell us
what that was all about?

200
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,049
I was just asking.

201
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,715
That question
about the mark on Agent Caleca?

202
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,052
Why not?

203
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,561
You said that mark appears on people
after they die strange deaths.

204
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,596
Dead people. Not the living.

205
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,599
I also said this is a puzzle
I'm trying to piece together.

206
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,295
I don't even know what
all the pieces look like yet.

207
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,303
- What do you think this means?
- I don't know.

208
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,106
It's like that, uh, bracelet
Madonna wears, right?

209
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,841
- And Britney Spears?
- Those are Kabbalah strings.

210
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:54,750
This one has knots tied in it in
groups of two, four and three.

211
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,447
[phone rings]

212
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,887
It's Edhead. Hey.

213
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,487
Nice. We'll be right there.

214
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,091
- What?
- Linda Caleca.

215
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,826
Edhead thinks she's found her.

216
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:12,495
So the pay phone she called from
is located right here,

217
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:15,597
directly across the street from
the Travel lnn motel in Tujunga.

218
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,232
You think she was staying there?

219
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,437
Even if she did, she would've
paid cash to avoid being found.

220
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,173
Hard to find, but not impossible.

221
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:25,444
Even if you pay cash,
the motel takes your driver's license.

222
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,815
Puts your number
into the computer system.

223
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,945
I managed to get her credit record

224
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,822
which shows her driver's license number.
I8884201.

225
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,621
Got a match for it at the motel?

226
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,857
- That's what I'm saying.
- Is she there now?

227
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,865
She left six days ago.

228
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,230
[Jain] Ah... What?

229
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,962
Then you didn't exactly find her.

230
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:47,335
I didn't say I knew where she is
right now, but I found her.

231
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,842
- She just left again.
- What do you mean, left again?

232
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,537
She was there six nights ago,
stayed three nights.

233
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,809
Same thing six nights before,
stayed three nights then left.

234
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,442
Hey, let me see that bracelet again.

235
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,729
- That's what this is for.
- What?

236
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:15,494
The knots,
in groupings of two, four and three.

237
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,502
It's a perpetual calendar.

238
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,504
- I don't get it.
- Well, she's on the run.

239
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,267
She can't stay anywhere too long.

240
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,502
It's not safe to call her husband, so...

241
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,669
She's gone between
three different motels.

242
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:30,340
This bracelet was a way for Caleca
to know where she was on any given day.

243
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:34,182
Two knots, two nights at one motel.
Four knots, four nights at another.

244
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,653
- Three knots...
- Back at the Travel lnn in Tujunga?

245
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,383
For three nights.

246
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,426
If she was last there six nights ago,
she'd be back there...

247
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,427
T oday.

248
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,900
Edhead... rules.

249
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,071
They're on the move.
They are on the move.

251
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,085

[man] Air Unit Six
tracking northbound on the 1 1 0.

253
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:26,327
Advise when you have
the vehicle in sight.

254
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,297
I'll meet you out the front.

255
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,984
Come on, Carl.

256
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,552
Why have you dragged us
all the way out here?

257
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,941
Anything?

258
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,882
The manager recognizes her,
but says he hasn't seen her.

259
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,419
Wait. That's her, isn't it?

260
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:58,025
You don't think
that's his source, do you?

261
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,563
I think that is Victor Caleca's wife.

262
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,262
Wait there.

263
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,304
- I thought she was dead.
- Yeah. So did l.

264
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,472
- You ready to move?
- [man] Copy that.

265
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,539
I'd like to check in, please.

266
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,882
Mrs. Caleca, I'm Perri Reed
and this is Carl Kolchak.

267
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,320
- Hi.
- What do you want?

268
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,754
T o help.

269
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,958
[motorbikes approach]

270
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,265
How did you find me?

271
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,207
We can explain that later.

272
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,680
We got trouble.

273
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,582
- Kolchak!
- We need to get you to safety.

274
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,779
I'm not going anywhere with you.

275
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,185
Get down!

276
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,886
Shots fired! Go, go, go, go, go!

277
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:05,691
[tires screech]

278
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,426
[siren]

279
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,308
Come on.

280
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,808
- I'm hitting these guys.
- So am l.

281
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,995
[tires screech]

282
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,288
All right. I just got off
the phone with Chief Bratton.

283
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,293
He assures me the authorities
are making all efforts

284
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,919
to locate Carl and Perri.

285
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:53,863
It's been four hours
since they went missing

286
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,366
and there hasn't been
a single sighting. Jain.

287
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,734
We think they may be
with this woman, Linda Caleca,

288
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,273
the widow of the DEA agent
that was shot last night.

289
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,865
We think that she's the one
these bikers were after.

290
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,604
Any idea why they want to kill her?

291
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,238
That's the angle we were working
when this went down.

292
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,044
In their absence,
it's the angle we'll all be working.

293
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,483
Seth, Rob, we need to find out
who these bikers are

294
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,418
and find Carl and Perri before they do.

295
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,456
- We're on it.
- Dawn, hound the LAPD,

296
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:21,253
sheriffs, and,
God forgive me, the coroner.

297
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,489
Anyone catches a glimpse
of Carl, Perri, or this woman,

298
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:26,190
I want to know about it first.

299
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:31,165
All right, we all know our assignments.
Let's get on it.

300
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,397
Could you come with me?

301
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,071
Sorry to drop in unannounced.
You can imagine why I'm here.

302
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,671
Why don't you tell me?

303
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:47,013
Three officers were gunned down
in the line of duty today.

304
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,383
It goes without saying,
we need answers.

305
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,580
Yes, it does.

306
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,021
We want your cooperation
to monitor calls

307
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,525
- in and out of the Beacon...
- Listen to our calls?

308
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,324
For rapid response,
in case Reed or Kolchak phone in.

309
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,421
We'll also need your photographs, son.

310
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,364
- Give you my pictures?
- I know, I know.

311
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,460
T ony, it is a lot to ask
but there's a lot at stake here.

312
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,505
Yes, there is,

313
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:11,872
and you will receive
no cooperation from this paper.

314
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,240
What did you say?

315
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,541
If something happened to Carl,
Perri or Jain,

316
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,549
- I would hold you responsible.
- Me?

317
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,380
They should cover the story, not be it.

318
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,215
I didn't make them the story.

319
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,414
You released Kolchak to follow him,

320
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,219
- as your stalking horse.
- You wanted Kolchak's source.

321
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:31,023
All due respect, I don't answer to you
about my investigative techniques.

322
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,529
No, you answer to the public.

323
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,861
Which is what this paper
will make sure you do,

324
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,561
by publishing what we know,
when we know it.

325
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,506
I thought we were friends.

326
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:45,634
We were.

327
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,268
Then, as a friend,

328
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,280
do you really think
that your publisher will refuse

329
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:54,250
to cooperate with the FBl?
The Crossbinder board?

330
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,646
I'd hate to see you fall on your sword.

331
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,259
Not for Kolchak.

332
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,624
He's not worth it.

333
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,626
You can go now.

334
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:16,840
Here is... my cell phone number.

335
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:25,042
In case my "friend" changes his mind.

336
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,593
That was awesome.

337
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:45,260
He's right.
The board might not back up my decision.

338
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,965
We need to find Carl and Perri, fast.

339
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,599
Yeah, I know, but how?

340
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,742
- Your friend, Egghead...
- Edhead.

341
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,548
Could you get her back down here?

342
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,346
Yeah.

343
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,760
- Hey.
- [owl hoots]

344
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,802
Well, I cleaned out the vending machine.

345
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:22,505
We've got cookies, chips
and candy for dinner.

346
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,666
Fantastic.

347
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,801
- Linda?
- No thanks.

348
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:30,275
- How did you find me?
- Your driver's license.

349
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,248
You left the number with the motel.

350
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:35,252
But how did you know that
I'd be coming back to that motel?

351
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,947
T oday?

352
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,495
[sobs]

353
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,408
Vic's dead, isn't he?

354
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,274
- I'm sorry.
- I knew it.

355
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,842
I knew it when I saw you.

356
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:15,850
I had a dream last night
and it felt... so real.

357
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:20,195
Victor came to me...

358
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,795
and he told me that he wasn't
ever going to see me again.

359
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:30,637
But he said it would be OK.

360
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,645
That I wouldn't be alone.
That I'd find peace.

361
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,812
Those bikers.

362
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,783
Were they the same ones

363
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,650
that ambushed you and your husband
three weeks ago?

364
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,485
I don't know.

365
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,890
Victor thought a drug lord,
Felix Morales, was responsible.

366
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,291
That's why he and Rich Walton
came up with the story

367
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,764
that I was already dead.

368
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:01,503
We wore these bracelets
so that he could find me again,

369
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,406
after he'd paid him for our lives.

370
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,944
But Morales didn't kill him, did he?

371
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,842
It was the bikers.

372
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,245
Who are they?

373
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:16,481
We don't know.
We only know that they killed Morales

374
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:20,081
and your husband and Agent Walton, too.

375
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,352
And now they're coming after me.

376
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,222
Why?

377
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,366
We need every possible thing
that we can get.

378
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,236
OK, just give us one minute, will you?
Thanks.

379
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,743
- Did you reach Edhead?
- Yeah, she's working on it.

380
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,076
- That's not why I wanted to see you.
- What is it?

381
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:46,276
[sighs]
There's a problem with this story.

382
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:52,083
- These are the killers?
- Yeah.

383
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,954
Well, two of them anyway.

384
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,994
- I've got positive lDs.
- How?

385
00:29:57,061 --> 00:30:00,758
Their photos were on file, from a bank
shoot-out in Culver City two years ago.

386
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:04,268
They're ex-cons by the names
of Clayton Crans and Roy Lockard.

387
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,496
So that's good work.
What's the problem?

388
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:10,530
The story says that SWAT sharpshooters

389
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:12,872
took out both Crans and Lockard.

390
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:19,079
According to our files,
both of these men are already dead.

391
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:35,095
Think you can sleep?

392
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,690
I'll try.

393
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,460
We'll just be in the next room.

394
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:44,838
Perri.

395
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,709
You're so kind doing this for me.

396
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,147
I don't know what to say.

397
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,844
You don't have to say anything.

398
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,852
I know you're reporters,

399
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,252
but you're risking your lives
staying with me.

400
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,530
My colleague, Carl...

401
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,965
about a year ago, he and his wife
were attacked in a storm

402
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,798
by... something he didn't see.

403
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,498
Is she OK?

404
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,703
She was killed.

405
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,038
How?

406
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:26,941
She was pregnant.
Her fetus was torn from her body.

407
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,047
Oh, my God.

408
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,988
Carl was told
if he could find your husband,

409
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:37,687
he might get the answers
to who or... what killed her.

410
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,456
Who or what?

411
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,938
I don't have any answers for him.

412
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,065
I don't think Victor did either.

413
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,604
Who would tell him that we would?

414
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,413
[door opens]

415
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,951
Hey. You want some dinner?

416
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,461
I've got, uh, cheese,
ranch and barbecue flavor.

417
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,062
Maybe later.

418
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,429
[Carl sighs]

419
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,994
We're going to have
a little problem in the morning.

420
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,232
What's that?

421
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,640
I wasn't quite ready
to flee justice today.

422
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,541
How much cash do you have?

423
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,480
After what I spent on dinner?
About 60 bucks.

424
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:35,778
And I thought you were a rich man.

425
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:37,252
What do you mean?

426
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:43,827
You were right about Agent Fain
trying to pit me against you.

427
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,160
He told me your "motive"
for killing lrene.

428
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,427
Irene's estate.

429
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,834
I always wondered how you could
afford that house in the hills.

430
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,873
Yeah.

431
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:02,006
Did you give the cabin manager
your driver's license number?

432
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,039
Yeah, I changed it by a digit.
He seemed pretty nosy though.

433
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,446
I know how we found Linda,

434
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,820
but I'm still wondering
how those bikers got there.

435
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,155
I don't know.

436
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:22,325
I, uh, heard on the radio
three cops got shot,

437
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,391
but the bikers got away.

438
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,401
Who are they?

439
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,235
That's the question.

440
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,969
She can't keep running forever, Carl.

441
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:35,877
Got any ideas on where we can take her?

442
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,881
Well, in case you haven't noticed,

443
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,110
I'm kind of making this thing up
as I go along.

444
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,516
Yeah. I noticed that.

445
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:46,216
Hopefully, the cops will find the bikers
before the bikers find us.

446
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,557
And if they don't?

447
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,219
If they don't...

448
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:55,095
she's got to go someplace
where no one will ever find her.

449
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,537
[knock at door]

450
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,343
- Who is it?
- It's the manager.

451
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:12,213
I'm just closing up the front desk,
in case you folks need anything.

452
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,377
- Uh, we're fine.
- You want me to turn down the sheets?

453
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:19,549
- Got some bedtime mints here?
- No, thank you. Good night.

454
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:23,082
All right, then. Good night.

455
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,910
- I'll call you back. What?
- She got something.

456
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,918
I cloned this agent's cell number.

457
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,921
Been listening to his traffic all night.
Mostly dead ends...

458
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,388
But?

459
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,426
But he just got the call.

460
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,724
Kolchak's car was spotted
at a cabin off the Sierra Highway.

461
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,765
- The FBl's on the way there.
- I need a phone number.

462
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,472
Hey, Perri.

463
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,271
Just want to say thank you
for, uh, being here.

464
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,113
For trusting me.

465
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,171
In for a penny.

466
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,476
Yeah.

467
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:27,747
But since I am here, maybe you could
start trusting me a little bit more.

468
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,259
What do you mean?

469
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,924
You asked that Korean woman, Dae,

470
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,399
about whether Caleca
had the mark on his wrist.

471
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,663
[sighs]

472
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,729
- Yeah.
- Why?

473
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,367
Don't say you were just
asking an innocent question,

474
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,809
because you don't ask
innocent questions.

475
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,938
Why would you think that mark
would've been on Caleca's wrist?

476
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,530
Because...

477
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:17,836
I have it on mine.

478
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,178
How did it get there?

479
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,189
I was born with it.

480
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:37,785
I thought it was a birthmark
until lrene died

481
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:41,457
and... I saw it on her body.

482
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,432
I don't understand how that could be.

483
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,833
That's when I started looking, you know,

484
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:50,169
and I found it on other people
who'd died strange deaths.

485
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:54,439
But in each case, it appeared
on their bodies after they died.

486
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,843
That's right.

487
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,108
You never found it
on anyone else living?

488
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,043
Never found anyone born with it,
like you?

489
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,525
[phone rings]

490
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,292
[Carl sighs]

491
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,696
- Hello.
- Carl, it's Tony.

492
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,263
T ony? How did you find us?

493
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,402
The FBI beat me to it.
You've got to get out of there, now.

494
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,673
[motorbike engines]

495
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,850
I think it's too late for that.

496
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,856
[cocks gun]

497
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,787
Shh.

498
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,562
Look, our only chance is the car.

499
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,898
We'll never make it.
Not without him seeing us.

500
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,165
- We can go through the trees.
- They'd hear us.

501
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,139
But they'll find us if we stay here.

502
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:33,005
- I'm going to draw them away.
- What are you talking about?

503
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,671
When they start after me,
get in the car and don't stop.

504
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:37,270
They'll kill you.

505
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,112
If I make it to the manager's office,
I can take his truck.

506
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,311
You have a better plan?

507
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,747
It's going to be OK.

508
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,740
[gunshot]

509
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,906
What happened, Carl?

510
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,545
Where's Linda Caleca?

511
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:33,062
[Fain] Kolchak!

512
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,327
Kolchak!

513
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,902
- Perri, hey.
- Where is he?

514
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,969
In the conference room.

515
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,498
Oh, my God. How did you get away?

516
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,296
I'm not even sure, exactly.
I just kept running.

517
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,063
And they didn't catch you?

518
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,765
- No.
- I can't believe it.

519
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:21,301
I was just telling T ony how, uh, Linda
Caleca got away from us at the motel.

520
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,539
You didn't see where she went?

521
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,513
No. I didn't.

522
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,284
Well, we'll just have to tell that
to Agent Fain.

523
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,018
That we can't be of any use to them.

524
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,582
That's right.

525
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,823
And we have no indication of where
Mrs. Caleca might have gone to?

526
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,666
I'm hoping someplace safe.

527
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,864
Someplace no one will ever find her.

528
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,539
[Carl] Life travels a crooked path.

529
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,102
[speaks Korean]

530
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,614
A course whose shape
we cannot recognize,

531
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,673
except by looking back on it.

532
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,019
How happiness leads to heartbreak.

533
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,385
I' m back.

534
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,425
How a dark turn leads to peace and joy.

535
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:16,798
Our purpose,
like our destination, is hidden.

536
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,530
But goodness is a refuge.

537
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:25,797
A soft, warm light
into which evil cannot see.
