1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,763
Agent Fain. What do you want me to see?

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,828
This is where Kolchak killed his wife.
That's not his story.

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,998
Convenient, killing his wife,
leaving him alive.

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,872
Look at her left hand.
She didn't have it before she died.

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:14,937
Why kill that woman and take that girl?
Why kill your wife and why not you?

6
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,473
You have to wonder why he's been
so interested in this case.

7
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,179
Why a man would be drawn
to a story that mirrors his own?

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:24,314
All these strange deaths,
they're like pieces in a puzzle.

9
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,827
- A puzzle I'm trying to put together.
- And when you get your answers?

10
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,727
I'll print them.
Then they'll believe. They'll have to.

11
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,699
[Carl] Before time, before light,
before life itself,

12
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:42,072
they say the Earth was formless, empty.

13
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:45,270
And darkness was over
the surface of the deep.

14
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,576
That darkness hovers there still.

15
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:51,481
Eternity whispering
in the crash of the waves.

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,086
Mysteries about who we are
and where we come from.

17
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,818
We suffer, we toil,

18
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,828
we live and die,

19
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:06,522
never knowing
why we 're born into this life.

20
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,293
Whether it's to serve good...

21
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,496
or evil.

22
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,131
[al I speak Lati n S pan ish]

23
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,202

28
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,103
- Great story, Carl.
- Thank you.

29
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,001
Any word yet on who killed these men?

30
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,371
No, not much to go on, other than
the tracks they left at the scene.

31
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,966
This missing witness?

32
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,842
They have my description,
like, he was wounded, so...

33
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,404
I have to say, I was a bit surprised.

34
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,081
- Why's that?
- The death of a drug lord

35
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,521
is a big story, but it's straight crime.

36
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,115
You know, there's nothing...
"woo-ooh" about it.

37
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,060
Nothing "woo-ooh". Ha!

38
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,792
Just wouldn't expect
it to grab your attention.

39
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,529
- Carl, are you OK?
- Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

40
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,409
Ms. Perri Reed from the L.A. Beacon.

41
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,819
- Agent Fain.
- How you been, Ms. Reed?

42
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,951
If you're looking for Kolchak,
you just missed him.

43
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,155
I'm not.

44
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,164
I'm looking for T ony Vincenzo.

45
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,961
Bernie!

46
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,730
Guess I found him.

47
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,834
What the hell is going on?

48
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,677
- Oh! Nice digs.
- Thanks.

49
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,378
I always knew that you'd make good
in the big city.

50
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,910
- Congratulations, you deserve it.
- How's the FBl treating you?

51
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,652
No shortage of bad guys out there.
Which is, uh, why I called.

52
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:38,163
This story that Kolchak
had in the morning paper...

53
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,789
The drug cartel executions?

54
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,061
I don't need to say
how I feel about Kolchak.

55
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,103
- No.
- He's a hell of a reporter,

56
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,537
- I give him that. Damn good story.
- What's it got to do with you?

57
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:51,737
Uh, a joint FBl-DEA task force was
created last night to look into this.

58
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:55,008
- We'd like your cooperation.
- You'd like our cooperation?

59
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,208
These deaths completely blind-sided us.

60
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,912
Until he turned up dead last night,
this cartel chief, Felix Morales,

61
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,649
we didn't even know
he'd crossed the border.

62
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:09,287
So, what makes you think
Kolchak could help?

63
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,796
He got there before the cops did.

64
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,890
Obviously, he's got some
kind of inside information.

65
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,130
A source tipped him off.
We're willing to play ball.

66
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,900
Give the Beacon exclusives
all the way on this thing.

67
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,874
I suspect Carl will be reluctant
to work with you

68
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,776
as you're trying to put him away
for his wife's death.

69
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,473
That's why I came to you.

70
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,249
He didn't kill lrene, Bernie.

71
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,551
Let's agree to disagree on that,
OK, T ony?

72
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,123
Well,
whatever's between Kolchak and me...

73
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:45,221
this man he saw running away last night
can lD those shooters

74
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,528
and we need to find him, before they do.

75
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,391
[banging]

76
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,323
[creaking]

77
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,964
[banging]

78
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,374
That's all you're asking me to do?
That's everything.

79
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,705
- Just do this...
- No!

80
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:06,767
Carl!

81
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,826
- Carl? What's wrong?
- I need my keys.

82
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,524
- What's going on?
- I'm getting stabbed in the back.

83
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,760
Because of Agent Fain?

84
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,364
What do you know about that?

85
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,599
- I saw him.
- When?

86
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,608
After you left. Looking for Vincenzo.

87
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,440
Vincenzo wants me to cooperate.

88
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,972
T o share information
so they can find this missing witness.

89
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,542
- What's Fain offering?
- Oh, what does it matter?

90
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,555
- He just wants to get to him before me.
- What, that witness?

91
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,353
Where are my damn keys?

92
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,624
Right here.

93
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,126
Carl, where are you going?
I'm just trying to help here, OK?

94
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,133
I don't want your help.

95
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,638
- [knocks]
- Hey.

96
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,165
You took pictures at that crime scene
last night with Kolchak, right?

97
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,733
Yeah.

98
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,906
- So, what happened?
- Why do you ask?

99
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,950
Because Kolchak's been acting crazy.

100
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,575
Crazier than usual, anyway.

101
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,143
Yeah, he was acting
kind of weird last night, too.

102
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,451
You have any idea
how he got onto this story?

103
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,617
No, but I can tell you this.

104
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,321
He wasn't expecting
to find those bodies.

105
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:34,230
Didn't even know who they were
until the cops lD'd them.

106
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:41,337
- Then what was he doing there?
- Looking for that witness.

107
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,967
The one that got away.

108
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,444
- He had a description of him.
- He doesn't know who he is.

109
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,845
- Why would he look for him?
- He didn't tell me,

110
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,281
but I think I'm beginning
to have an idea.

111
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,818
I'm listening.

112
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:57,344
Kolchak acts strange
and then Fain shows up,

113
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,654
Iooking for the same guy
that Kolchak's trying to find?

114
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,663
This story's not about
who killed the drug lord,

115
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,031
it's about what killed Kolchak's wife.

116
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,104
I'm still afraid.

117
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,577
[screams]

118
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,208
[Carl] I need you to jump...

119
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,650
[girl yells]

120
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,982
[screaming]

121
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,156
- [eerie whooshing]
- [screaming]

122
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:39,527
Emily Gale was pregnant.
That's why they think he killed her.

123
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,196
- [Carl] That's my wife.
- Carl!

124
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,796
- [Carl] She had a secret.
- She was pregnant.

125
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,841
They tore the fetus from her body.

126
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,079
Were you aware Kolchak claims
some sort of beast killed his wife

127
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,347
and that a judge ordered him
held for psychiatric evaluation?

128
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,853
This just came over the police wire.

129
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,291
- What is it?
- A trucker picked up a hitchhiker

130
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,352
matching the description of Kolchak's
witness last night.

131
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,057
Dropped him off near Koreatown.

132
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,565
But they don't know it's him.

133
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,067
All they have is Kolchak's description.

134
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,696
Right. However he got that.

135
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:23,003
Your idea that this man
has something to do with Kolchak's wife

136
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,100
doesn't jibe with what he's always said.

137
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,840
- That something not human killed her?
- How do bikers killing a drug lord

138
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,610
- relate to that?
- I don't know.

139
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,414
I think it does... somehow.

140
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,717
Unless there's some other explanation.

141
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,279
Well, what's that?

142
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:41,520
Kolchak spent six months in a psych ward
after his wife died.

143
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,222
Yeah, so?

144
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,423
You said yourself
he's been acting weird.

145
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,433
What? You think he's cracking up?

146
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,199
What's Agent Fain doing here then?
Coincidence?

147
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,071
Maybe just investigating this case,
like he said.

148
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,909
But somebody told Kolchak,
not you, not any other reporter,

149
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,472
to go to that house last night.
T o look for this man.

150
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,481
Then we need to find him.

151
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,215
Find out why.

152
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,214
[police radio]

153
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,390
[Korean]

154
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:25,056
Linda.

155
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,958
Linda.

156
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,266
[phone rings]

157
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,513
- Hello?
- [man] You were too late last night.

158
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,524
- I went soon as you called.
- You missed your chance.

159
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,787
You told me to come here.
That you'd be here.

160
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,388
If you have any questions
about the story, you'd better ask them.

161
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,228
- We don't have much time.
- Let's start with who you are.

162
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,236
A friend. Someone just like you.
Someone trying to help.

163
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,535
Well, friend, I'd showed up
at that house five minutes earlier,

164
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,006
I'd be dead right now, too.

165
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,373
This man I sent you to find
narrowly escaped.

166
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,435
Next time he won't be so lucky.

167
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,482
Yeah, but escaped who?
Who killed that drug lord?

168
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,016
Not who, what.

169
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,278
It was four men.

170
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,650
They found tracks
from their motorcycles.

171
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:59,054
You of all people should know
what the police find means nothing.

172
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,616
[sighs] You told me this man could help
me find what killed my wife.

173
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,560
They're after him for the same reason

174
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,860
they were after you
the night your wife died.

175
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,332
- And why is that?
- You have a role to play.

176
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:10,390
You know that.

177
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,460
I don't know what you' re talking about.

178
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:15,996
I don 't have to tell you. It's on your
left wrist, hidden by your watch.

179
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,034
The mark.

180
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,170
- How do you know about that?
- You need to find him.

181
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,611
How do you know?

182
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,649
Find him and you'll get your answers.

183
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,982
- I don't even know who he is!
- I do.

184
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,684
Thank you.

185
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,093
- Vincenzo's not here.
- I came to see you.

186
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,255
About?

187
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,164
Kolchak won't cooperate
with our investigation.

188
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,667
He won't cooperate with you.

189
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,637
I was hoping T ony could persuade him
otherwise.

190
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:50,402
You know, it is a win-win
for the Beacon and the Bureau.

191
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,344
If you think you're gonna get to Kolchak
through me, you're wasting your time.

192
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:59,612
You've already written this story
in your head, haven't you, Ms. Reed?

193
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,710
It's Les Misérables.

194
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,553
I'm lnspector Javert and Kolchak
is poor, persecuted Valjean...

195
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,457
- Something like that, yeah.
- Only...

196
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,626
you don't know... what you don't know.

197
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,767
Perri? What's going on?

198
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,965
- It's nothing, Carl...
- I asked her, not you.

199
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,501
- Uh, just stay cool.
- Carl, it's...

200
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,913
- Trying to stab me in the back again?
- I'm not the one who cut his wife...

201
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,349
[Perri] Carl!

202
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,555
- Kolchak! Stop!
- [Tony] That's enough!

203
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:39,648
It's over!

204
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,185
It's over!

205
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,075
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, come in, please.

206
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,381
Carl's got another exclusive
on these drug cartel killings.

207
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,617
That's great.

208
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,456
Turns out that our missing witness

209
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,224
is an undercover DEA agent,
name of Victor Caleca.

210
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,756
Until that night,
he'd been AWOL for two weeks.

211
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,632
Fain knew this man was DEA.

212
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,762
That's why he formed this task force.

213
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,637
The suspicion is that
Agent Caleca is corrupt

214
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,700
and in the employ of the drug
lord who was killed that night.

215
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,474
- That's the suspicion?
- DEA isn't confirming it,

216
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:39,813
but this story's going to have legs.
So I want you to team with Carl.

217
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,614
T ony, the story's his...

218
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:45,783
That's is the only way he's going to
keep it after that outburst yesterday.

219
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,951
Lucky Fain isn't pressing charges.

220
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,228
I see.

221
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,992
We done here?

222
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,658
Yeah, you can go.

223
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,477
- He doesn't want me on this story...
- It's not about him.

224
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,343
The FBl is pressing the matter
of Kolchak's source.

225
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,975
They're prepared to go to court to force
disclosure. If that happens,

226
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,986
I need to know that you are there
to protect this paper.

227
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,185
Good morning.

228
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,861
I found this shirt in the back.
Mine was kinda ruined.

229
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,164
I hope it's OK.

230
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,166
Yes.

231
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,806
Oh, you need to sit.

232
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:42,643
I'm OK. I'm bandaged pretty tight.

233
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,740
I, uh, I want to thank you
for taking care of me

234
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,012
and for not calling the police.

235
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:53,216
My English is not so good.

236
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,886
But you understand "thank you"?

237
00:19:55,961 --> 00:20:00,830
- Thank you.
- Yes. You're welcome.

238
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:06,460
Listen, um...

239
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,232
I was just wondering...

240
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,777
I can't leave. Not just yet.

241
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:15,472
Would it be OK if I stay here a little?
I can help you...

242
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,741
Yes. Stay.

243
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,845
Yes.

244
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,624
- Thanks for coming.
- You said it was important.

245
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,390
I'm embarrassed about
my behavior with Kolchak.

246
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:38,300
- I shouldn't have baited him.
- That's not why you wanted to see me.

247
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,103
No. The Justice Department
is filing suit against the Beacon,

248
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,439
compelling Kolchak to reveal his source.

249
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,037
- He won't. You know that.
- I was hoping there was another way.

250
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,547
Using me?

251
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,016
I know you feel disloyal, you shouldn't.

252
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,643
Yeah, so you keep saying.

253
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,211
You know how far back Kolchak and I go?

254
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:01,555
The Freemar graft case,
the one that made his career and T ony's.

255
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:03,993
Guess who his source was?

256
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,094
You?

257
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,998
We used to be pretty tight, me and Carl.

258
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:14,266
The night lrene died,
I went to the station as Carl's friend.

259
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,897
And the weirder his story got,

260
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:19,501
the more I realized
that he didn't deserve my friendship.

261
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,241
- He killed her.
- No. I don't believe that.

262
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,250
I didn't want to either.
They had marital problems.

263
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,445
- He had a motive.
- What motive?

264
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,455
Kolchak inherited a lot of money
when lrene died.

265
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:35,050
- You didn't know that, did you?
- It doesn't make him guilty.

266
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,760
You believe his story.

267
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:42,391
[Fain] I think Kolchak has to believe
there's something strange going on.

268
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,801
He needs to believe it so badly,
he's cooked up this cockamamie theory

269
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,102
about marks on people's wrists.

270
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,734
All so that he doesn't have to admit...

271
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,807
he killed the woman he loved.

272
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,246
But she did have that mark on her wrist.

273
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,806
Which proves what?

274
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,816
The more you play into his delusions,
the more you enable him.

275
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,854
Let's forget that, OK? Let's just say...

276
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,656
I'm an overworked, underpaid
civil servant trying hard

277
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,392
to find a missing DEA agent
before the bad guys do.

278
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,664
I could really use your help.

279
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,822
Making any headway
locating this DEA agent?

280
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,358
I got feelers out at the LAPD,
County Sheriffs.

281
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,827
No luck so far.
You can report that to Agent Fain.

282
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,364
- Kolchak...
- That is who you went to see?

283
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,764
- You're paranoid.
- And you're denying it?

284
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,228
I'm on your side. Even though
you might be forgetting that right now.

285
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,740
Are you?

286
00:22:56,808 --> 00:23:00,505
Or are you wondering again
whether I deserve to be trusted?

287
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,664
That picture.

288
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,773
That your husband?

289
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,413
Where is he?

290
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,207
[Dae coughs]

291
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,188
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

292
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,825
Finished.

293
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,788
Thank you.

294
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,797
What is... this?

295
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,764
Something very important.

296
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,940
Like that picture is to you.

297
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:10,143
This is very important to me.

298
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,567
[? blues]

299
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,138
Richard Walton?

300
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,111
Perri Reed, Jain McManus,
from the Los Angeles Beacon.

301
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,910
Reporters? You got to be kidding me.

302
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,578
You're Victor Caleca's supervisor,
right? The missing DEA agent?

303
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,645
- How'd you find me?
- A lot of DEA agents come here.

304
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,624
And your personnel photo's online.

305
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,719
Damn lnternet. Ruining the world.

306
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,128
I don't suppose you know where he is?

307
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,534
Well, that's the $64,000 question,
isn't it?

308
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,628
Questions are being asked about Caleca.

309
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,900
Why he was in that house
with a bag of money.

310
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,169
Why he's on the run now.

311
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,337
You mean was Victor dirty?
That's what you're asking?

312
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,709
Yes. It is.

313
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,683
You got the story all backwards,
you know that?

314
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:22,049
- Straighten it out for us.
- I would if I could.

315
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,551
Off the record, then.

316
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,394
Off the record?

317
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,389
Off the record,

318
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:38,129
- Vic's the victim here, not the perp.
- What do you mean?

319
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,731
Three weeks ago,
he's driving home with his wife,

320
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,331
and they get caught in this storm.

321
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,475
A storm?

322
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,844
They pull over to the side of the road,
and wham!

323
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,247
Something slams into 'em.

324
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,547
Linda never had a chance.

325
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:59,955
- Was she killed?
- They dragged her body away.

326
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,323
She still hasn't been found.

327
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:09,391
- Did he see what it was?
- You mean who it was?

328
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:14,669
Vic never did.

329
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,503
Now, I don't mean to be rude,
I got drinking to do.

330
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,455
? I think it's so groovy now

331
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,191
? That people are finally
getting together

332
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,857
? I think it's wonderful and how

333
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,924
? That people are finally
getting together

334
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,095
? I think it's so groovy now

335
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,503
? That people are finally
getting together

336
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,268
? I think it's wonderful and how

337
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,470
? That people are finally
getting together

338
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:57,948
? Reach out in the darkness

339
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:02,146
? Reach out in the darkness

340
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,451
? Reach out in the darkness

341
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:11,655
? And you may find a friend

342
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,789
? I think it's so groovy now

343
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,765
? That people are finally
getting together

344
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,665
? I think it's wonderful and how

345
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,068
? That people are finally
getting together

346
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,197
? I think it's so groovy now

347
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,798
? That people are finally
getting together

348
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,400
? I think it's wonderful and how

349
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,878
? That people are finally
getting together...

350
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,611
[helicopter]

351
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:38,722
Hello.

352
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,017
You wanted to see me?

353
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,322
- You lied to me.
- What are you talking about?

354
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,523
I spoke to that missing DEA agent's
supervisor last night.

355
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:49,294
- You spoke to him?
- He said something attacked Caleca

356
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,358
- and killed his wife.
- Oh, brother.

357
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,199
I think Kolchak's source told him

358
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:56,138
Caleca could give him answers
about what killed his wife.

359
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,005
- He what?
- The same thing killed their wives.

360
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,739
I gather that you told all this
to Kolchak.

361
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,673
No, not yet.

362
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:05,841
Good.

363
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:09,182
Because we know who killed
Agent Caleca's wife.

364
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:12,314
- Who?
- The cartel. Felix Morales.

365
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,382
The late Felix Morales.
We think Caleca was on the take.

366
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,896
He did something to cross Morales,
so the order was given.

367
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,059
Why would he go meet with the man
that killed his wife?

368
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,502
T o bargain for his own life.
It just didn't work out that way.

369
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,871
This isn't just about
a dirty DEA agent anymore.

370
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:35,003
This is about whoever killed
that drug lord and shot Agent Walton.

371
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,378
- Agent Walton was shot?
- Last night.

372
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,782
By the looks of it, it's the same bikers
who killed that drug lord.

373
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,821
How is he?

374
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,520
We don't know.

375
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:53,086
There's his blood... quite a lot of it.

376
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,828
No body. Not yet.

377
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,166
[phone rings]

378
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,449
- It's about time.
- I couldn't call before.

379
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,957
Look, no one can find this DEA agent.

380
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,549
- You have to.
- Why?

381
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,596
- What's he going to tell me?
- I told you before.

382
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:29,099
Answer the questions he's asking,
you'll answer your own.

383
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,466
- I need to see you.
- That's not possible.

384
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:35,597
The Justice Department's after me.
I need to know who you are.

385
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,904
- I'm sorry. I can't help you.
- I need answers!

386
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,435
- We won't be speaking again.
- [line goes dead]

387
00:29:50,755 --> 00:29:53,053
- Agent Walton.
- Dick?

388
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,820
- Victor?
- Is this a good time to talk?

389
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,156
Where are you?

390
00:29:57,228 --> 00:29:59,822
Are you OK? You sound strange.

391
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:03,664
The question is are you OK?
I've been worried to death.

392
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,669
I'm OK. I'm someplace safe.

393
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:09,332
The feebies are all over this. Tell me
where you are and I'll bring you in.

394
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,931
No. Not just yet.

395
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,978
Reporters came asking questions
last night.

396
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,513
I don 't know the story
you want me to tell anymore.

397
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,845
T ell me who those guys were.
Those bikers.

398
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,010
I don 't know. I hoped you knew.

399
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,952
I don't think it was the cartel anymore,
Dick. It was them.

400
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:26,786
They're the ones
who came after Linda and me that night.

401
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,224
- Why would they do that?
- I need you to find out.

402
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,023
- Victor...
- I'll call you later.

403
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,462
What's this?

404
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,797
The story.
I'm supposed to be working on it

405
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,032
with you, remember?

406
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,471
I'd say congratulations,

407
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,339
except I have a pretty good idea
who your source was.

408
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,744
Carl! Perri!
I wanna see both of you, now.

409
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:03,317
- What's going on?
- Who's your source?

410
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,021
The one who got you on this story.

411
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:07,257
You think I'd answer
that question for him?

412
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,800
It's not a question anymore, Carl.
It's an order.

413
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,166
The District Court
ruled against the Beacon.

414
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,364
- Well, then we'll appeal.
- No, we won't.

415
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,907
- Why not?
- The decision has been made.

416
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,603
- By who?
- Our parent company.

417
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,975
The Crossbinder board
has decided to comply.

418
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,209
Oh, they've decided?
I'm the reporter here.

419
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:29,014
I don't like it myself, but they own
this paper. It is their prerogative.

420
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,956
- And if I refuse?
- You go to prison.

421
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,100

422
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,133
[Dae speaks Korean]

423
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,873
There's something she needs to tell you.

425
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,040

[speaks Korean]

427
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,559
After her husband died,
she grieved and she worried.

[speaks Korean]

429
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,628
She doesn't know how to run a store.

430
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,894
She's losing money.

431
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,630
Her sister and mother count on her
to send money home.

[speaks Korean]

433
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,314
I come to see her.

434
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:17,190
I make good money as a doctor.

435
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:21,994
I want to marry her,
but she does not love me.

[speaks Korean]

437
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:33,405
She thinks maybe this is her fate.
T o marry without love.

[speaks Korean]

439
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,583
And then one night she has a dream.

440
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,957
And the dream says
a man will come to her in need.

441
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,360
She will help that man.

442
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,263
She will open her heart to him and...

443
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,062
she will find peace.

444
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,602
[speaks Korean]

445
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:03,235
When she saw you,

446
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:06,538
when she felt your breath
against her cheek,

447
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,045
she knew that man was you.

448
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:18,346
Now, if you go,
she fears this dream will be a lie.

449
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,559
If you must go, go.

450
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:35,067
But if you want to stay,
if that is in your heart...

451
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,265
she wants you to know...

452
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,004
it is in hers.

453
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,911
I...

454
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,582
I can't.

455
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,960
I'm sorry.

456
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,222
I'm sorry.

457
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,180
This is Edhead. Techie I told you about.

458
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:21,082
- Edhead?
- You got a problem with that?

459
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:23,245
- You didn't tell anyone else?
- I swear.

460
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,290
What do you think this phone's
going to lead to? Plutonium?

461
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,791
- What did you find?
- Nothing.

462
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,259
I thought she was good.

463
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,660
- She's the best...
- I'm damn good.

464
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,325
This phone doesn't show any calls
received. It's never been activated.

465
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,563
Well, that's not possible.
I got two calls on that phone.

466
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,400
Well, the only other explanation

467
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:44,498
is that maybe you just zeroed the memory
when you busted it.

468
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,776
What about the phone itself?

469
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,642
Paid for in cash at a shop in Hollywood.

470
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,947
So you say you're good?

471
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,212
That's what I said, and I don't lie.

472
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,278
I'm trying to locate this missing
DEA agent, Victor Caleca.

473
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,984
Yeah, Jain told me.

474
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,354
- How would you find him?
- You mean... electronically?

475
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:12,334
Cell phone, credit card,
lnternet and e-mail activity.

476
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:14,633
- Can you find him?
- Give me some time.

477
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,105
- That I don't have.
- [door opening]

478
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,841
[Jain] Perri, hey.

479
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,613
This is my friend, Edhead.
The one I told you about.

480
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,912
- Hey.
- How you doing?

481
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,884
Can I see you for a minute?

482
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,249
I wanted to let you know
we got a petition together,

483
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,759
signed by the staff,
supporting your decision.

484
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:39,057
- What decision?
- T o protect your source.

485
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,428
T o go to prison
rather than revealing it.

486
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,865
- Don't bother.
- W-w-wait. Why not?

487
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,696
- I'm not trying to protect him.
- Then what are you doing?

488
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:58,147
- You don't know his name.
- The information was good...

489
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:02,084
Do you know how reckless that is?
You don't even know who this guy is,

490
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:05,816
- or how he might be using you.
- That's my call.

491
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,415
Fain was right.

492
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,426
I don't know who you are, Carl.

493
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,897
I really don't.

494
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,636
- Agent Walton.
- You're alive.

495
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,268
And kicking.

496
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,837
- Thank God. The paper said...
- I know what it said.

497
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,816
Just tell me where you are.

498
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:39,049
Victor, tell me where you are
so I can get you out of there.

499
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,094
Koreatown.

500
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:49,258
[elevator chime]

501
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,903
- We got something.
- Hate to say I told you so...

502
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,874
- What is it?
- It wasn't easy, so I expect payback.

503
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,878
Those men are coming to take me away,
so talk faster.

504
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,540
Right. T urns out this guy, Walton,

505
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,381
bought a throwaway cell phone, off
the books. I figured out his pass code

506
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,317
- and cloned it.
- What did you find?

507
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,982
Two calls to Agent Walton
in the past 48 hours

508
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:14,752
from a market in Koreatown.

509
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:17,658
- You'd better get down there.
- Yeah. Right.

510
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,225
- Seriously?
- Everything depends on this.

511
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,325
I'd go, but I'm about to be
a little tied up.

512
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,895
What am I supposed to do
when I get there?

513
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,965
- T ell me if you find him.
- Right. Do you want to come?

514
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,340
No, thanks.

515
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,715
Will you reconsider?

516
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,650
I couldn't if I wanted to.

517
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,088
In that case...

518
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,481
you are under arrest.

519
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:53,254
You have the right to remain silent.

520
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:57,392
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...

521
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,815
- Hey.
- Hey.

522
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,876
I just found this.

523
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,012
What?

524
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:21,525
I've been listening to messages
cloned off Walton's cell phone...

525
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,356
- You'll take care of her?
- If she'll let me.

526
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:28,228
- Thank you.
- Thank you... for leaving.

527
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,234
Jain said this Agent Caleca's wife,
she's dead, right?

528
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,100
- Right.
- Well, then who's this?

529
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:38,073
It's Linda. I'm not supposed to call,
but I haven't heard from Victor in days.

530
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,770
I'm scared, Rich.
I'll try you again later.

531
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,403
She's alive.

532
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:58,050
- Victor Caleca?
- Did he send you?

533
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,427
- Who?
- Agent Walton.

534
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:02,892
[buzzer]

535
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,360
[clang]

536
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,302
I don't know how to tell you this,
but Agent Walton's dead.

537
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,337
I just spoke to him.

538
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:17,404
No, I just heard it on the radio
on the way over here.

539
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,472
They found his body a few hours ago.

540

[motorbike engines]

541
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,083
This is a trap.

542
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,559
What's a trap?

543
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,426
Whoever you are,
you better get out of here now.

544
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,576
[panting]

545
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,593
