00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:03,666
Carl Kolchak.

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,500
Perri Reed and this is Jain McManus.

3
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,836
- Senior Crime Reporter?
- I've been here four years.

4
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:11,001
- Know how long I've covered crime?
- You are expected to get along.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,646
It's my wife. Look at her left hand.

6
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,115
- What is it?
- I don't know.

7
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,947
She didn't have it before she died.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,011
It's the same marks here in Seattle,

9
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:25,216
and again in Sacramento,
and again and again.

10
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,555
Something terrible is happening

11
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,891
and no one sees it
because no one wants to.

12
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,048
[Carl] I drive the night.

13
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:56,020
Looking into the darkness,
where our fears reside.

14
00:00:56,089 --> 00:01:01,527
Of things the mind dismisses
but the heart knows are real.

15
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:05,325
Evils that lie hidden in the blackness.

16
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,332
I have seen these evils.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,197
They have taken my wife,

18
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,499
pregnant with a child never to be born.

19
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:16,406
Leaving me haunted by questions
about her strange death,

20
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:21,937
and the deaths of so many
others no one dares to explain.

21
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,110
So I drive,

22
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:30,222
knowing we fear the night
not because it hides these evils,

23
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:33,724
but rather because it reveals them.

24
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:42,361
This is really good, Brenda.

25
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,232
All I did was tighten it a little.

26
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,899
You recast my approach
to the actuarials. It's much better.

27
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,874
Thanks.

28
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,309
You're so nice to do this.
Staying late and all.

29
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,642
You want to get a drink or something?

30
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,706
- I've still got to do a letter.
- [clattering]

31
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,981
- Who's that?
- The janitor?

32
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,683
No, he already came and went.

33
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,719
Hello.

34
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,193
Nobody's supposed to be up here.

35
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,358
I'll be right back.

36
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,534
[sighs]

37
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,496
[gurgling]

38
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,468
Is anybody here?

39
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,491
There wasn't, uh... Brenda?

40
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,698
[sighs]

41
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,334
- Brenda.
- [screams]

42
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,978
All units to a 187 at Second and Flower.

43
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,043
Two victims.
Cause of death unknown.

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,088
All units to a 1 87...

45
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,624
[police radio]

46
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,078
[indistinct]

47
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,878
[camera shutter whirs]

48
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,718
[alarm beeps]

49
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,356
- Good morning.
- Aren't you the early bird?

50
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,196
Night owl, actually.
I gather you saw my story.

51
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,362
I did. Front page. Impressive.
Two victims even.

52
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:41,202
Their bodies strangely desiccated.
Almost mummified.

53
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,969
No one knows exactly how.

54
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,636
Your story says
these people were murdered.

55
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,340
Well, I got that
from a confidential source.

56
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,507
Funny. I just spoke to Detective Cuevas.

57
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,017
He called me on my way
in to work this morning

58
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,781
to tell me your story was wrong.

59
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,515
Really?

60
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,555
Why do I get the feeling
you're laughing at me right now, Carl?

61
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,891
- This is serious.
- And I take it seriously.

62
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,898
Setting aside how someone
could have killed people this way,

63
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,332
security cameras
don't show anyone else there.

64
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:12,269
So the police have concluded
that no one killed them.

65
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:16,001
They've concluded they weren't murdered,
but rather it was an accident.

66
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,270
They were exposed
to an unidentified toxin.

67
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,073
A toxin?

68
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:22,876
I just thought I'd come to you
before going to Vincenzo.

69
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,247
Well, that's fair and I appreciate it.

70
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,811
But the police are wrong.

71
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,418
They're wrong?

72
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,926
Just because the cameras
didn't pick up the killer

73
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,326
- doesn't mean he wasn't there.
- No, it means...

74
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,060
The victims were last seen
90 minutes before they were found.

75
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:45,230
And I checked, there's no known
toxin that can work that fast.

76
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,169
- Are you sure?
- Even if there was,

77
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,038
why would only two people
out of 3,000 in there be exposed?

78
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,942
I don't know. But explain
how a killer could have done this.

79
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,275
I can't. No one can.

80
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,412
But someone preyed upon those people
while they were alone

81
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:06,288
in some big empty building
where no one could hear their screams.

82
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:11,626
So you're saying if there's a killer,
he may take more victims?

83
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,623
I'm saying that's the story.

84
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,126
If you're interested.

85
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,499
- You're bothered, aren't you?
- By what?

86
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,807
Because I got the story last night,
not you.

87
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,245
I'd be happy for you, Kolchak,
if it were right.

88
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,717
How'd you find out about it, anyway?
On your police scanner?

89
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,946
- You don't trust me, do you?
- What?

90
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,989
- You don't.
- I never said that.

91
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,956
No. You didn't.

92
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,796
[police radio]

93
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,364
Want to tell me
why you're just standing here?

94
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,497
You want to get the story right,
don't you?

95
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,244
- Come on.
- You're kidding me, right?

96
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,806
The police won't just
let us into their crime scene.

97
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,182
- So you're sneaking in?
- I'm not sneaking.

98
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,244
I'm snooping.

99
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,066
I can't believe I'm doing this.

100
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,100
Step inside or someone will see you.

101
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,941
It's called disturbing a crime scene.
It's a felony.

102
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,744
Forensics have already been. And I think
you're going to want to see this.

103
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,110
What?

104
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,587
These marks show where the victims were.

105
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,487
Now the woman, Brenda Cook,

106
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,995
she came in here, ran to
the male victim, Jeremy Steckler...

107
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,562
and they collapsed on the floor here.

108
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,135
None of which
proves this was a homicide.

109
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,537
No. But what are these?

110
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:08,006
- Third person.
- His marks end here, though.

111
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:19,147
- What, did you find something?
- This stain on the carpet.

112
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,783
Body fluids?

113
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,090
No, it looks like some kind of gel.

114
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,957
[shrieks]

115
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,523
- What happened?
- It burns.

116
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,907
...any details about the mysterious
deaths of two office workers...

117
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,672
- I'm watching it now.
- [woman] Was that your office?

118
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,838
They were at Second and Flower,
I think.

119
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,677
- [TV] A detective...
- Hmm?

120
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,683
I like working at night.

121
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,414
I can hear myself think
without the phone ringing all the time.

123
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,622
- [woman] Is something wrong?
- Nothing.

00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:57,288
- Darling, please come home.
- Hold on a second, Lynda.

125
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,396
[Lynda] Mark? Mark?

126
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:19,207

00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,377

00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,676
- [man] Cuevas.
- Detective Cuevas, Perri Reed.

138
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,244
I thought you'd be calling.

139
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,621
Please don't tell me the guy who died
was killed by a sick building.

140
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,183
- Maybe he was.
- You've got to do better than that.

141
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,523
You think I'm lying?

142
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,154
What else am I supposed to think?

143
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,291
You didn't mention the other footprints
at the first crime scene.

144
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,598
It wasn't some mystery killer,
if that's what you're thinking.

145
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,503
We think they belonged to the janitor
who found the bodies.

146
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,507
What about the gel smeared on the floor?

147
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,100
How do you know about that?

148
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,544
Why don't you just tell me what it is?

149
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,913
I'll tell you all about it,
if you let me buy you a drink tonight.

150
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,878
I'm not having a drink with you.

151
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,081
You are if you want to know
why these people are dying.

152
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,921
[phones ring]

153
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,232
Morning. What are these?

154
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,360
Follow-up to Kolchak's exclusive,
we hope.

155
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,633
Comparing the pictures I took
of the crowd outside the crime scene

156
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:30,800
- to the crowd outside the first scene.
- Looking for...?

157
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:33,811
Killers often return to the scene
to relive their crimes.

158
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,110
If the same face shows up
in both places, it could be him.

159
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,048
That or a very determined looky-loo.

160
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,710
In any case, it's worth a try.

161
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,914
Yeah. Kolchak,
can I see you for a second?

162
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,131
- There is no killer.
- What makes you say that?

163
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,101
Detective Cuevas just told me
everything the cops know.

164
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,830
How'd you get him to do that?

165
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,672
Don't ask.
Are you familiar with Diazinon?

166
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,402
Yeah, it's a pesticide.

167
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,639
Very powerful, very toxic,
but approved for outdoor use only.

168
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:11,342
Now according to the police, janitors
used it illegally in both buildings

169
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,612
- for the past six months.
- Bug spray?

170
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,052
It's the only connection
between crime scenes.

171
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,715
- They're running tox screens now.
- Bug spray?

172
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,656
It's the story everyone's going with.

173
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:24,025
It's more credible
than some killer shriveling people.

174
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,064
Well, how do you explain this?

175
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,691
Their best guess right now
is some other chemical

176
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,828
that the janitors been using.
They're running tests.

177
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:36,397
- What, the police are lying?
- No, they're wrong.

178
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,033
Somebody's wrong, all right.

179
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,601
- I need to know your source.
- It's confidential.

180
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,512
Your last confidential source
turned out to be you.

181
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,812
Look, you have my word, it's genuine.

182
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,286
If I'm not going to go to Vincenzo
with this right now,

183
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,823
I need a whole hell of a lot more
than your word.

184
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,882
I need to know you're right.

185
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,342
- [Perri] Your source is the coroner?
- Patience, Grasshopper.

186
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,972
Jain said you were at the crime scene
before the cops.

187
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,572
- That's right.
- How?

188
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,347
I sensed a disturbance
and was led there psycho-magnetically.

189
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,115
You're joking, right?

190
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,780
Yes, I am.

191
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,588
No, I monitored the radio frequency
used by private security firms.

192
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,687
There's a ten or fifteen-minute lag time
before the cops show.

193
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,392
- So, I was there when they arrived.
- [beep]

194
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,492
- Do you ever use the front door?
- Not if I can help it.

195
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,599
[Perri] So you're telling me
your source is Alex Nyby?

196
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,165
- A legitimate source.
- He's an orderly, Kolchak.

197
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,870
You bribe him for information.

198
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,209
- So?
- Has it occurred to you

199
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,477
that he'll tell you what you want
to hear to get more bribes?

200
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,747
- Ah, there's that trust thing.
- "Trust thing"?

201
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,754
Yeah, you have a problem with it.

202
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,722
Other people must have told you.

203
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,486
I do not have a problem with trust.

204
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,960
It just so happens that you're
a very suspicious character.

205
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:12,302
Oh, my God.
This is the man that died last night?

206
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:16,273
Mr. Mark Rothman,
alleged victim of pesticide poisoning.

207
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,877
No, man, it's not there.

208
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,850
His throat's abraded,
just like the others.

209
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,787
What do you mean,
"just like the others"?

210
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:34,417
Nyby found abrasions
on the throats of the first victims.

211
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,291
Why didn't the coroner rule
these deaths a homicide?

212
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,921
They're abrasions, for sure.

213
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,434
There's not the internal bleeding
you'd find in strangulation cases.

214
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,164
Oh. So you're saying that they
were strangled but not strangled?

215
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:47,967
Exactly!

216
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,909
- You said you had something for me.
- Yes, I do.

217
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,843
- Does that look familiar?
- The stuff that burned your finger.

218
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,817
- Yeah, that'd be my guess.
- Where'd you get it from?

219
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,377
They scraped traces of it
off this guy's neck here

220
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,320
and l, uh, stole a little for you.

221
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,552
- Thanks, Alex.
- No problem.

222
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:11,153
Ooh, wait a minute.
Aren't you, uh, forgetting something?

223
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,595
Oh, yeah.

224
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,859
Oh, what, more Laker tickets?

225
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,663
[chuckles] Ballet, actually.

226
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,795
The ballet?

227
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:23,137
Yes. The, uh, Bolshoi.

228
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,699
The Bolshoi?
I'm trying to get tickets to that.

229
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:28,008
Really? So I hear.

230
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,175
I can't believe you like the ballet.

231
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,050
Well, l, uh, I don't.

232
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,958
No.

233
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,626
What am I supposed to do with these now?

234
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:53,598
[Perri] I'm just thinking out loud here,
but your idea is what exactly, Kolchak?

235
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:58,041
Someone grabbed their necks
with this jelly on their hands?

236
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,544
- Possibly.
- And that idea doesn't seem,

237
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,080
I don't know, um, insane?

238
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,514
No more insane than the idea

239
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,052
that those people died from bug spray.

240
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,283
Any idea why he would target
people in office buildings?

241
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,948
No, not yet.

242
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,391
I saw you look for the mark
on that body back there.

243
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,021
Yeah, I haven't found it
on any of the victims.

244
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:22,158
Why would you? What connection
could those deaths have to your wife's?

245
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,328
I told you, I think these strange deaths
are connected somehow.

246
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,531
How?

247
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,903
I don't know.

248
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:33,570
But these people they shouldn't...
shouldn't be dying.

249
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,738
Not this way.

250
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,315
- Dr. Messinger.
- Yes.

251
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,789
This is Carl Kolchak.
He's a colleague of mine.

252
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,089
- Hi.
- Hi. How can I help you?

253
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:51,254
Perri said your specialty
is biochemistry

254
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,595
- and you've helped her before.
- I'm chair of the department here.

255
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,692
Well, we hoped you might be able
to analyze this substance.

256
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,498
Kolchak got some on his finger.

257
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,131
It burned my skin,
but not the carpet where I found it.

258
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,232
Ah, well, that's interesting.

259
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,504
Where'd you get this sample from?

260
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,479
We found it on the neck
of a homicide victim.

261
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,577
A homicide victim?
How'd you get a hold of it?

262
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,177
We can't reveal our sources.

263
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,090
I'll tell you what.

264
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,186
I'm not interested in blindly
serving someone else's agenda.

265
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,959
So, if you can't tell me
where you got the sample from...

266
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,932
You heard about the bodies downtown?

267
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,368
I heard about it on the radio.
Pesticide poisoning, wasn't it?

268
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,837
Does that look like a pesticide to you?

269
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,867
I think the authorities
can solve this without your help.

270
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,413
Yeah, maybe they will, eventually.

271
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,144
But three people
in the last two days have died.

272
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,617
Until someone finds out why,
more people are gonna be murdered.

273
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,403
[engine starts]

274
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,159
Another shocking assault
on an office worker tonight.

275
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,220
Authorities say the man was attacked

276
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:10,234
in the Hope Street office building
downtown, and survived.

277
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,031
No details have been released yet,

278
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,868
but police say that the victim
suffered major burns

279
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,498
around his neck area.

280
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,544
The victim's been sedated.
He told the police he was attacked

281
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,138
- by someone who grabbed his throat.
- I just got off the phone with Cuevas.

282
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,775
Is he acknowledging
a connection to the other deaths?

283
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:29,150
Not officially. But at least
he's not talking bug spray anymore.

284
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,280
- Where's McManus?
- At the hospital,

285
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,722
trying to find out
about this guy's condition.

286
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,626
The Chief of Police said they've
questioned everybody with access.

287
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,664
Security guards, janitorial crews...

288
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,063
- But no suspects?
- No.

289
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,658
The question is, why?

290
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,602
If this is the same killer
who attacked the other people,

291
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,663
why isn't the victim dead already?

292
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:53,736
I can keep the front page open
two more hours.

293
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,608
[hold music plays]

294
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,694
Hot date?

295
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,165
Let's just say I'm happy to be here.

296
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,759
- I'm touched.
- [phone clicks]

297
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,364
- Dominic Messinger.
- Hi, it's Carl Kolchak and Perri Reed.

298
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,568
I thought you'd call.
I saw it on the news.

299
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,237
Could he have been exposed
to the substance we gave you?

300
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,303
If he was,
I don't know how he survived.

301
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,212
Are you near a computer?

302
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,882
I swabbed this rat's throat
with the gel you left.

303
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,980
These images were taken
over the next two minutes.

304
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,919
Oh, my God.

305
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,492
- What happened?
- Mummified mouse.

306
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,366
In a manner of speaking, yes.

307
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,462
The rat was completely dehydrated.

308
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,665
How?

309
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:59,404
That gel's a synthetic compound.
A super astringent.

310
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,106
Like witch hazel,
concentrated 1 0, 000 times.

311
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,512
It draws all the water from the body.

312
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,019
- OK, but then where is it?
- What do you mean?

313
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,783
If this gel is drawing water
from these people's bodies,

314
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,223
there should be puddles
left behind, right?

315
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:18,661
- Something must have absorbed it.
- I think it was... someone.

316
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,325
The man, who got exposed
to this astringent, somehow.

317
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,596
Like a chemical plant or something.

318
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,433
And now he's drinking people up?

319
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,940
- Right.
- With his hands?

320
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,408
- Right.
- And he'd be doing this, why?

321
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,571
- I think he needs this.
- Then he wouldn't stop.

322
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,582
No, he wouldn't stop.

323
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,942
Not unless someone stopped him.

324
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,894
You can't take that out.
That explains what killed them.

325
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,726
"Gel" found on one victim's neck,
but not on the others?

326
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,132
A synthetic compound
his body secretes through his hands.

327
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,729
And we did find it at the first
crime scene, on the floor.

328
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,297
That doesn't mean
that's what killed these people.

329
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,382
That explains what the compound does.

330
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,611
It strips people's bodies of water.

331
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,846
Do you know how ludicrous that sounds?

332
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,520
Yes, I do.

333
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,960
If this killer wants to drink water
with his hands,

334
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,429
why doesn't he stick them
under a faucet?

335
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,432
OK. Run that.

336
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:39,742
All it says is the police believe these
deaths are homicides. It's a non-story.

337
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,678
Then next time,
bring me something I can print.

338
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,314
- He's right, you know.
- What do you mean, he's right?

339
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,879
- We don't have the story.
- A killer's on the loose.

340
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,927
- But we don't have the story.
- A predator's out there.

341
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,428
The longer we're silent,
the more people will die.

342
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,863
We need to find out
where this compound came from

343
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,662
- and how he got exposed to it.
- We want to catch this guy,

344
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,068
we need to answer my question.
Why did this last victim survive?

345
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,741
- How'd it go?
- I snuck past hospital security,

346
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,643
but they bounced me
before I could get to the victim's room.

347
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,704
What do you got?

348
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,816
- Pictures of the hallway?
- I told you they kicked me out.

349
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,918
Wait. Stop. Go back.

350
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,522
Yeah. Stop.

351
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,591
Can you blow that up?

352
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,227
Yeah.

353
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,809
Now, these meds
are going to our victim, right?

354
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,641
- Right.
- Can you read that?

355
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,375
- The label on the lV bag?
- I think I can.

356
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,881
Thiamin and folate.

357
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:58,548
How the hell can...
Who are you calling?

358
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,250
My father. He's a doctor.

359
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,316
Dad, it's Perri,
I hope I didn't wake you.

360
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,453
No, I have a question.

361
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,090
Why would you prescribe thiamin
and folate to an in-patient?

362
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,532
I don't get it.
What's his lV bag going to tell us?

363
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,003
If the cops won't tell us
why he survived, his medication might.

364
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,404
Great. Thanks.

365
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:20,433
They're multivitamins, used to treat
alcoholics for malnourishment.

366
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,276
So the hospital's treating
this man for alcoholism?

367
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,747
Evidently.

368
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:27,808
What does being an alcoholic
have to do with why he survived?

369
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,056
Yeah, maybe nothing.

370
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:36,389
[radio] S. S. 241,
this is 668 north La Cienega.

371
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:40,090
Resident pick up.
Ride will be waiting on the street.

372
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:48,261
Thanks so much for coming.
I was afraid to walk back to my car.

373
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:55,879
I feel bad calling, but I heard
about these people being killed.

374
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,402
[Carl] Anything?

375
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:26,172
I've called chemical companies in seven
states. No luck. What about you?

376
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,372
A theory. I did some research
on alcoholism.

377
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:33,042
- You ever hear of hypomagnesia?
- It's Latin, "not enough magnesium."

378
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:36,645
In addition to malnourishment,
alcoholics commonly suffer from it.

379
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:40,487
Not enough magnesium results
in a severe electrolyte imbalance.

380
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,923
OK, I'm with you so far.

381
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,053
What if that's why this victim survived,
and the others didn't?

382
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,531
As an alcoholic his body didn't
have what the killer needed.

383
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,667
Electrolytes?
Why didn't he just go crazy

384
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,034
in the sports drink aisle
at the supermarket?

385
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:57,006
He could,
unless it's not electrolytes he's after,

386
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,407
but the minerals in our body
that carry them.

387
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,479
Like magnesium?

388
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:05,311
It could explain not only
why this last victim survived,

389
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:09,319
but why the killer doesn't go
after people living on the streets.

390
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,378
He needs healthy victims.

391
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:16,518
I don't know. I mean it makes sense
if I squint real hard.

392
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,897
Yeah.

393
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,159
Are these from the third crime scene?

394
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,463
Yeah, Jain just put those up.

395
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,870
You're disappointed, aren't you, Carl?

396
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,172
About what?

397
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:36,338
The explanation
for why the killer's doing this.

398
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:42,009
Whatever it is, it's scientific.
Medical.

399
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,146
[Perri] You thought it was supernatural.

400
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:48,215
Something you could connect back
to whatever killed your wife.

401
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,355
Kolchak?

402
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:58,065
It's been right in front of us
the whole time.

403
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,195
What?

404
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,866
It's not a face in the crowd,
but outside it.

405
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:09,005
This security guard.
Here... here... and here.

406
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,982
The cops already questioned the guards
who worked in those buildings.

407
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,076
The same guard
in all three crime scenes.

408
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,087
What if he worked for the security firm,

409
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,715
but wasn't assigned
to any of those buildings?

410
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:26,229
[radio] S. S. 107 to LAX terminal two.
Party of three. No luggage.

411
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,698
S. S. 1 07 to LAX terminal two...

412
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,167
Uh, can I help you?

413
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:35,229
I'm Carl Kolchak, this is Perri Reed and
Jain McManus, we're from The Beacon.

414
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:38,207
I'm Mr. Cory, the manager.
Could you stop taking pictures?

415
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,177
We need to confirm the name
of a guard you employ. This man.

416
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:45,239
Our personnel records
are confidential. I said stop.

417
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,245
- We'll write the story anyway.
- I guess so.

418
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,720
How do you spell "Cory"?
With or without an "E"?

419
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,121
Uh, what story?

420
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,250
- Your hiring practices.
- Lack of screening.

421
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,159
Employing a convicted felon
to guard an unsuspecting public.

422
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:00,527
I don't know what you're talking about.

423
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:04,125
This man was convicted of second
degree murder and armed robbery.

424
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,670
- We already know his name.
- T ony Vincenzo.

425
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:10,037
You wouldn't be violating
any confidentiality rules.

426
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,906
We only need to confirm
it's the same T ony Vincenzo.

427
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:15,937
I really can't do that.

428
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,950
You're right.
We'll just run the story anyway.

429
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,250
Unless your records contradict
our information about this man.

430
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,291
In which case,
we'd be glad to drop the whole thing.

431
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,830
His name is Warren Prees,
from Tucson, Arizona.

432
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,197
If that's his real name.

433
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,429
I don't get why he bothers
holding down a job.

434
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,200
If he's killing these people,
why not take their money?

435
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:46,232
Access. He can get pass codes,
find out where the cameras are.

436
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,506
Slip in and out
without ever being detected.

437
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,048
The fox guarding the henhouse.

438
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,300
- That's where he lives?
- That's where his paychecks go.

439
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,735
Wait, where are you going?

440
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,966
- I'm going in.
- It's illegal.

441
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,376
"ln battling evil, excess is good."
It's Kahlil Gibran.

442
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:24,609
- Sounds more like Donald Rumsfeld.
- We should call the police.

443
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:26,980
We have no proof,
other than his picture.

444
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,712
We can't just break in.

445
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,845
He's killed three people in four days.

446
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,288
What if he needs to feed to stay alive?

447
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,724
Do you want to give him time
to kill again?

448
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,926
T ell me you're
not going to break the lock?

449
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,770
No.

450
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,906
Give me a lift?

451
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,356
- Can we turn the lights on?
- No, he might come back.

452
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,830
OK.

453
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,913
So, what are we looking for?

454
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,548
Anything that connects this man
to the murders.

455
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,352
This is interesting.

456
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,832
Looks like our security guard
gets around.

457
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,272
He can't stay in one place too long.

458
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:22,861
[clunking]

459
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,801

Oh, my God.

463
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,262
Guess this is the right place.

466
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,366
He's here.

467
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,534
How do we get out of here?

468
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,441
That way.

469
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,809
OK, we're dead.

470
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,771
Police!

471
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:21,705
Call the cops!

472
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,540
[Perri] Kolchak!

473
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,485
[tires screech]

00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,662
[horns blare]

475
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,518
Kolchak!

476
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,365
[Perri] Kolchak!

477
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,986
- Morning.
- Kolchak.

478
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,332
- How you feeling?
- Thirsty.

479
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,993
- We've worked on the story.
- Have you?

480
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,336
We think we have our killer's real name,
Bernard Faroux.

481
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,138
Lordsburg, New Mexico.
Released on disability a year ago

482
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,270
from his security job
at an industrial vinyl chloride plant.

483
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,474
I take it they use astringents
at the plant?

484
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,915
He claimed to have inhaled it
for six months

485
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,646
from a leaky ventilation system.

486
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,518
Of course,
the company denied his claims.

487
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:47,784
So we have nothing
but his allegations.

488
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:50,793
I've referred it
to Detective Cuevas all the same.

489
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,852
What about the other bodies we found?

490
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,656
Some were women
he'd been called to escort home.

491
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,827
And the others?

492
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,470
What? What is it?

493
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,476
There's something else, Kolchak.

494
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,671
Something l...

495
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,772
We were hoping that you could explain.

496
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,019
I took it at the warehouse.

497
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,184
Pretty sure she was the only one
that had it.

498
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:31,233
We already checked, she didn't
have that mark before she died.

499
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,832
How can that be?

500
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,863
I don't know.

501
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,811
[Carl]
There are evils that live amongst us.

502
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,814
Hidden behind walls,

Open your eyes and you'll see them.

But be careful
you don 't open them too wide.

00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,876
