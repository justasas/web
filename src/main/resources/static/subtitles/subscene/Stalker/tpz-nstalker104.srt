1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,969
I'm Carl Kolchak.

2
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,197
Perri Reed.
And this is Jain McManus.

3
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,501
Perri is the senior crime
reporter at this paper.

4
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,542
- Senior crime reporter?
- I've been here four years.

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:10,940
Do you know how long
I've covered crime?

6
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,876
The two of you
are expected to get along.

7
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:16,347
You have to wonder why he's been
so interested in this case.

8
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,044
A man drawn to a story
that so closely mirrors his own?

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,054
All these strange deaths,
they're like pieces in a puzzle,

10
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,919
a puzzle I'm trying
to put together.

11
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,821
But no one sees it,
because no one wants to.

12
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,291
And when you get your answers?

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,420
I'll print them. Then they'll
believe. Then they'll have to.

14
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,070
[Carl] They're in the news every day.

15
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,577
Warnings about what you eat.

16
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,943
Drink. Breathe.

17
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,379
Think.

18
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,417
In the modern world,
fear of death

19
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:55,045
isn 't a distant anxiety
reserved for old age.

20
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,425
It's daily life.

21
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,756
The ordinary
no longer offers comfort.

22
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:06,561
Not when death can come
any time... from anything.

23
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,733
U h, that's dangerous, you know.

24
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,772
Your cell phone.

25
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:16,138
Static electricity could start
a fire. L-Look behind you.

26
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,106
[muttering]
Some punk's sweatin' me...

27
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,875
[continues talking]

28
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,590
[whimpers] No!

29
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,008
[cries in pain]

30
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,715
[screams]

31
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,163
[man] Someone call 91 1!

32
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,922
[hubbub, voices on radio]

33
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,930
- Hey.
- Hey. What do you got?

34
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,238
- Got a story. A good one.
- A gas station fire?

35
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,336
Not the fire, but how it started.

36
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,381
I overheard a witness telling the cops

37
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,541
that it was another customer here.

38
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,676
The guy who died, Theodore Fogel.

39
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,242
Was he smoking?

40
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,984
No. He was burning up.
Literally.

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,754
A witness said that this man
Fogel's body started the fire?

42
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,796
- Like some kind of human torch?
- Like Johnny Storm.

43
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,854
- Flame on.
- Witness might have been wrong.

44
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,763
A hundred things
could've started this.

45
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,098
I don't think the fire's the story.

46
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,042
- You read yesterday's paper?
- Of course.

47
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,275
Then you saw the front page.

48
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,682
- The T errorMaker.
- The Unabomber-type guy, right?

49
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,219
Yeah, a homegrown terrorist

50
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,051
who sent his victims wax
figurines as calling cards.

51
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,920
So-called "burning men."

52
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,517
They all died. Burned by some
kind of biological agent.

53
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,028
Yeah, one that seemingly burned
his victims alive...

54
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,257
from the inside.

55
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,764
No wax burning man was found.

56
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,198
It could've melted in the fire.

57
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,259
...and the TerrorMaker's dead,
Kolchak.

58
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,804
How could he take a new victim
when he died a year ago?

59
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,799
That's what I want to know.

60
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,741
[telephone rings]

61
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,078
I'm gonna go print these out.

62
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,309
Have you considered
this might be a copycat?

63
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,373
I have.

64
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,578
Bu that's not the story
you're interested in?

65
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,087
Not really.

66
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,992
Before he died,
the T errorMaker denied

67
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,118
he burned his victims
with biological agents.

68
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,388
That's right.

69
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,453
He claimed
he could summon "hellfire".

70
00:04:58,531 --> 00:04:59,759
Exactly.

71
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,629
Yeah, um, well, I read that,

72
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:05,603
and, crazy me, I dismissed it
as the ravings of a madman.

73
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,902
Well, maybe it is.
Maybe it isn't.

74
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,469
How long you been working here?

75
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,343
Uh, about two months, I guess.

76
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,576
In that time, I have witnessed
more freaky things

77
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,947
than I've seen my entire life.

78
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,178
Thanks.

79
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,023
You know why you keep
finding these things, Carl?

80
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,957
Because I look for them?

81
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,824
Because you want to find them.

82
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,095
Keep chasing monsters,
one day they'll be chasing you.

83
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,862
[woman] Howard, welcome back.

84
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,926
Hey, there he is.

85
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,165
Hey, let me take the lead
in this, OK.

86
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,706
I know how to handle him.

87
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,833
I don't want Gorn bigfooting us.

88
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,435
Howard Gorn covered the
T errorMaker case for ten years.

89
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:50,380
he has a six-figure book deal
about it. The story's his.

90
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,146
Yeah, the story was his.
Now it's ours.

91
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,125
- Enter.
- Carl Kolchak, Mr. Gorn.

92
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,720
Yeah, I've heard about you.
Perri, how's the crime beat?

93
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,163
- Keeping you busy?
- Yeah, it's fine.

94
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,463
You know,
I started out covering crime.

95
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,163
The first Pulitzer
was for the Manson thing.

96
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,332
I got in tight with Bugliosi
and Polanski and all those guys.

97
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:19,606
Crime is a great beat for
beginners. The public loves it.

98
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,737
Right.

99
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,747
So, what is it you need from me,
sweetheart?

100
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,477
Yes, "sweetheart."
Why don't you tell Mr. Gorn?

101
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,179
Well, I hate to bother you,
but we were having an argument.

102
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,085
- About?
- Your story you wrote yesterday

103
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,556
talked about rumors that the FBl
killed the wrong man.

104
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,422
That the real T errorMaker's
still alive.

105
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,725
- Yeah, and so is Elvis.
- [chuckles]

106
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,664
You're convinced this suspect,
Robert Guttman, was guilty?

107
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,758
Look, it'll all be covered
in my book.

108
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,860
It was just bad luck, that's all.

109
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,202
The raid went bad when
a tear gas canister ignited,

110
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,765
incinerating Guttman
and his wife, Margaret.

111
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,834
So there was no suspect to question.

112
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,573
And no smoking gun.

113
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:57,047
The biological agents
he used to burn his victims,

114
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,141
- they were never found?
- No.

115
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,915
Presumably, he stole them
from some DOD lab he worked at.

116
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:06,516
And the theory is that they were
transmitted by the figurines

117
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,219
he sent to his victims.

118
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,058
So simply touching a figurine
caused them to burn up?

119
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,122
Within seconds.
Poof! You're dead.

120
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,225
- That was the theory.
- Yeah, right.

121
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:19,100
The biological agents
disappear without a trace.

122
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:22,107
There's no hard proof,
you get rumors, conspiracy nuts.

123
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,076
Good thing about rumors
is they help sell books.

124
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,442
Hmm. What about
the T errorMaker's letters,

125
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,947
claiming he killed these people
with "hellfire"?

126
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,779
What about it?

127
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,046
Did you ever consider
they might be true?

128
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,523
Oh, you mean that God gave him
the power to scorch human flesh?

129
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,687
No.

130
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,660
This guy, Perri,
he's a piece of work.

131
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,166
Your article also talked about
an FBl profiler, Doug Panero.

132
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,329
Yeah.

133
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,873
Is he convinced
Guttman was guilty, too?

134
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,104
I suppose so. It was his profile
they were working off.

135
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,735
But Panero's not talking, so...

136
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,006
Why not?

137
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,273
Listen, these, uh,
these questions...

138
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,315
Are they a part of this argument
that you two are having?

139
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,447
No, no, we just got
a little carried away.

140
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,459
Thank you for settling our
debate, Howard. Appreciate it.

141
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,428
- Anytime, sweetheart.
- It's been an education.

142
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,559
Right.

143
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,431
[knocking]

144
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,131
Mrs. Panero? Hi, I'm Perri Reed.

145
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,197
This is Carl Kolchak.
We're with the Beacon.

146
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:32,005
Oh, I'm sorry, my husband
doesn't give interviews.

147
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,172
We don't need to talk to Agent Panero.
If he could just look at this.

148
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,715
What is it?

149
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,842
It's the file of a man who
was burned to death last night.

150
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,114
We were hoping your husband
could tell us

151
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,486
if he fits the profile
of a T errorMaker victim.

152
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,117
He was the FBl agent
in charge of the case.

153
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,629
But the T errorMaker's dead.
Thanks to my husband.

154
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:54,097
Yes, we understand that.
If he could just take a look at this.

155
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,096
Our number's inside. Thanks.

156
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,393
That's the last one.

157
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,559
T en years this guy's
been killing people.

158
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,762
There's got to be more research
in these files.

159
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,897
There is. It's Gorn's story.
Most of it's up in his office.

160
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,101
Yeah. For his book.

161
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,940
When you get to be as famous
as he is, paper gives you latitude.

162
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,537
Yeah, well, that latitude's
keeping us from finding out

163
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,209
how this T errorMaker
burns these people.

164
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,808
It's already been explained.

165
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,377
A classified biological agent
that leaves no trace or residue?

166
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,219
- Right.
- So top secret

167
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,555
that no one's
ever proven it even exists?

168
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,889
Doesn't mean it doesn't.

169
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,327
What,
just because it wasn't found

170
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,160
doesn't mean it doesn't exist?

171
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,029
Where have I heard that before?

172
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,127
OK. Let's say there never were
any biological agents.

173
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,406
He burned these people
with "hellfire"?

174
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,911
The T errorMaker claimed
that biblical wrath was on his side.

175
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,072
That these bioweapons
were offensive to God.

176
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,810
- And that makes sense to you?
- I'm only saying,

177
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,375
admit that there may be more
to this world

178
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,478
than reason alone can explain.

179
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,584
Reason's all we have.

180
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,617
And if it's not enough?

181
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,562
- [rustling, rattling]
- What was that?

182
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,043
[gasps]

183
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,622
You haven't shown this to the FBl?

184
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,386
Not yet.

185
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,524
So, we don't know if it's authentic?

186
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,364
- It could just be a hoax.
- It may be.

187
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,736
Or it could be that the FBl
killed the wrong guy a year ago

188
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,037
and the T errorMaker's back.

189
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:53,203
"I'm Back" is written in the same
blood-red ink he used in the past.

190
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,008
So, why send it here?

191
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,515
Maybe he saw us at the gas
station asking questions.

192
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,380
That is
the "real-world" explanation.

193
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,182
That's where I live.
It's the explanation I'm looking for.

194
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,188
There could be others.

195
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,960
What does Howard Gorn
think about all this?

196
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,531
- We haven't told him.
- And why not?

197
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,228
Because this is our story.
Jain found it.

198
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,007
T ony, it does not seem fair
to just hand it over to him.

199
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,043
Howard Gorn is on the national desk.
He outranks all of us.

200
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,840
But we're the ones
who put it together.

201
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,504
You haven't put anything together.

202
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,071
You don't know this is authentic.

203
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,084
You don't even know if the victim
fits this lunatic's profile.

204
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,185
So, until you do...

205
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,652
I don't see any reason to waste
Howard Gorn's time with this.

206
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,670
Thanks for cutting us
some slack, T ony.

207
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,140
Try not to hang yourself with it.

208
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,734
The FBl's position on this
is that it's a fake.

209
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,337
- Well, how can you be so sure?
- The T errorMaker's dead.

210
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,245
This has got to be a copycat
of some kind.

211
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,750
Unless you're wrong, Agent Houck.

212
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,616
We've all heard the rumors,

213
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,882
but Guttman fits the Bureau's
profile to a "T"

214
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,787
and the attacks stopped after his death.

215
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,917
Did you hear about
the gas station explosion?

216
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,724
- Yeah, I heard about it.
- Don't think it's connected?

217
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,823
- No, there's no evidence it is.
- What does Doug Panero think?

218
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,865
Howard Gorn covered this story
for the Beacon for ten years.

219
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,337
Why aren't I talking to him?

220
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,533
Well,
Howard's the reason we're here.

221
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,846
All right, I'll have Quantico
take a look. I'll let you know.

222
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,058
- [Jain] He's here.
- Who?

223
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,498
That, uh, FBl agent
you wanted to see.

224
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,695
- Doug Panero?
- Yes. I had him wait in Photo

225
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,761
so that Gorn wouldn't see him.

226
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,578
Agent Panero?

227
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,544
I wanted to get back to you.

228
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,816
T o tell you that I checked out
the man in this file.

229
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,859
Was he someone the T errorMaker
would target for death?

230
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,089
Every victim had some connection
to biological weapons research,

231
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,756
which he claimed to oppose
on moral grounds.

232
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,427
I compiled a list of over 7,000
people that fit his criteria.

233
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,026
This victim at the gas station

234
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,868
was doing bioengineering
research at CSU,

235
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,172
research the T errorMaker
would've clearly found unacceptable.

236
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,576
You think he's alive?
The T errorMaker?

237
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,275
I didn't say that.
I said the victim fit his profile.

238
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,510
But we received
a burning man figure last night

239
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,577
wrapped in paper,
with the words "I'm back".

240
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,589
- May I see it?
- We just gave it to the FBl.

241
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,023
- They're analyzing it.
- Then I can't help you.

242
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,686
Except to say it's plausible
T errorMaker would have sent

243
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,060
a burning man to the press
to spread fear.

244
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,692
Agent Panero...
why did you come here today?

245
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,963
Because you asked for my opinion.

246
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,163
It's our understanding

247
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,173
that you haven't spoken to anyone
in the press since the raid.

248
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,713
The raid was a black mark
on the Bureau.

249
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,376
Questions were raised
about loss of innocent life.

250
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,577
Guttman's wife.

251
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,780
Even whether or not
Guttman was guilty.

252
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,382
The whole episode has made me
persona non grata at the Bureau.

253
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,892
But you still work there.

254
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,226
Not really. I don't go to the office.

255
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,060
I-I still don't understand though

256
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,259
why you came to us
instead of the FBl.

257
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,166
Because if T errorMaker's still alive,

258
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:15,297
if we did kill the wrong man,
I want people to know about it.

259
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,604
And your old boss? Agent Houck?

260
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:21,168
Let's just say the FBl
doesn't need any more headlines.

261
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,680
I'll, uh, I'll show you out.

262
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,723
I thought you'd be excited.
Sounds like we have a story.

263
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,990
Yeah.

264
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,526
What is it?

265
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:47,265
He's still got it in his eyes. Fear.

266
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,216
[rock music plays]

267
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,978
[doorbell]

268
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,688
It's been an hour and a half.

269
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,455
- Sorry. Traffic.
- Yeah, right.

270
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,826
Thank you.

271
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:20,462
Food's here.

272
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,268
- Who's hungry?
- Come on and eat.

273
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,329
What's this, the toy surprise?

274
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,568
Susan?

275
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,433
- Oh, God!
- [laughs]

276
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,996
Don't do that!
You scared the crap out of me!

277
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,542
[woman mock-screams]

278
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,351
- Gary?
- What now?

279
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,630
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

280
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,258
No. I mean it.

281
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,865
What's happening?
What's happening to me?

282
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,033
I'll get help!

283
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,943
[agonized screams]

284
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,664
Just got confirmation from LAPD.

285
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,635
- A burning man?
- Found on the patio table.

286
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,865
Think it got delivered
with the take-out dinner.

287
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,099
How did it get in there?

288
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,971
Same way as with
all the other victims.

289
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,771
- Which is?
- Nobody knows.

290
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,402
- You reach Panero?
- Not yet,

291
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,276
but the victim's
gotta be on the list.

292
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,078
He was an executive at a biotech
company in Manhattan Beach.

293
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,449
I'll see if I can get a picture
from personnel.

294
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,011
You want to work the phones
or start writing?

295
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,750
You write it.
I'll get you my notes.

296
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,655
I'll, uh, I'll take those notes.

297
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,455
The FBl called,
it's... my story.

298
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,025
[noise of traffic outside]

299
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,940
- Howard.
- I'm on deadline, T ony.

300
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,067
The story's theirs.

301
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:39,804
You're out of your bailiwick here.

302
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:43,177
This story belongs to national,
not to city desk.

303
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,806
They found it. They chased it.

304
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,477
They also pumped me pretty good
for information about it,

305
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,487
and they still don't even know
what "it" is.

306
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,922
The T errorMaker's back.
T onight's attack proved it.

307
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,686
You see what I mean?

308
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,523
Well, why don't you tell us then?

309
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,825
You can read all about it
in tomorrow's Beacon.

310
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:02,025
Well, you mean what your pals
at the FBl tell you to write?

311
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,625
That it's nothing but a copycat?

312
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:13,009
This is the figurine
you wanted the FBl to analyze.

313
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:17,242
The other... is from an attack
that took place two years ago.

314
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,806
They look the same.

315
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,476
Well, they're not.

316
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,079
The FBl says the wax is
different and so is the mold.

317
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,415
This one is a fake.

318
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,483
It's a copycat.

319
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,689
And I don't write
what the FBl tells me to write.

320
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,995
I write the simple truth.
Like I always do.

321
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,433
Now I'll take those notes
from you now...

322
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,166
if there's anything in them
worth reading.

323
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,134
[knocking]

324
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,972
Good morning.
Is your husband in?

325
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,274
What do you want?

326
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,212
Did you read the news
this morning?

327
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,875
I read it.

328
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,782
I need his help.

329
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,447
He's done helping, Mr. Kolchak.
You should call the FBl.

330
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,323
- People are dying.
- Listen to me.

331
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,831
My husband has helped enough.

332
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:43,766
For ten years he's chased
that monster. He's paid enough.

333
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:47,168
- It's OK, Lisa.
- Doug...

334
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,230
It's all right.

335
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,603
What is it that you need,
Mr. Kolchak?

336
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,512
Answers.

337
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:04,819
This is where it all happened.
Where I hunted the man down.

338
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,267
Lisa wants me to move past all this.

339
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,204
But you can't.

340
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:25,300
All those years chasing a phantom,

341
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,675
imagining his every move.

342
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:29,805
I never met the man,
but I got to know him better

343
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,815
than my friends and my family.

344
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:36,718
The day that Guttman died,
it was like my life ended, too.

345
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:39,450
The FBl didn't need
or want me anymore.

346
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,719
You read about the death last night?

347
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:48,664
The biotech exec? The FBl thinks
he was killed by a copycat.

348
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,725
But you don't believe that.

349
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,402
Why do you say that?

350
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,599
It doesn't fit with your theory
about the agent

351
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,335
the T errorMaker used to kill.

352
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,036
Well, I've seen the research.

353
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,579
Our government's working
on all kinds of killer germs.

354
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,479
Biological warfare,
it's the new combat.

355
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,915
But you theorized
that Guttman stole them

356
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,418
from a lab where he worked.

357
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,647
Yeah, that's right.

358
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,746
So, if that were true,

359
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,054
how would a copycat get
this same biological agent?

360
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,688
I don't know.
It seems next to impossible.

361
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:22,222
- What if it isn't a copycat?
- What are you talking about?

362
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,734
Maybe Guttman was the wrong guy.

363
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,795
He fit the profile.
And he worked at a lab

364
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,841
where he had access
to biological agents.

365
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,432
That's based on the assumption

366
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,206
that he killed these people
with a biological agent.

367
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,715
So what? Your saying he burned
them with "hellfire"?

368
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,881
You've got to be joking.

369
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,886
You want to put this case
behind you.

370
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:46,219
Let me help you do that,
once and for all.

371
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,322
- [telephone]
- [Perri] Where you been?

372
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,955
Why are you asking?

373
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,693
You still working on the story?

374
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,394
Who wants to know? You or Gorn?

375
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,905
Vincenzo. He got called into the
managing editor's office this morning.

376
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,269
Ooh, he got his hand slapped?

377
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,433
We all did.
Jain can stay on the story,

378
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,636
but if either of us
steps on Gorn's turf again,

379
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,700
we'll be fired.

380
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,110
Uh, they're bluffing.

381
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,876
They don't trust us, Carl.

382
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,385
They don't think we know how
to do our jobs. Not like Gorn does.

383
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,547
We're the only ones trying
to write this story. The real story.

384
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:21,114
They don't care.
They want us to let it go.

385
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,855
Well, I care.
I'll take my chances.

386
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:26,898
You can't do that.

387
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,093
Vincenzo is being
held personally responsible.

388
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,830
That's his problem, not mine.

389
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:35,395
He got you this job, Carl.

390
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,508
You cross the line again,
it'll cost him his.

391
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,237
You need to back off.

392
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,899
- [man] Freeze!
- [siren]

393
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,666
[shouting, tires screech]

394
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:44,132
Right down!

395
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,835
Turn him around! Now.

396
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,214
[officer] Come on, get up.

397
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,212
A little lower.

398
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,589
Glenn Overton,
formerly employed as a driver

399
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,653
- for a high-risk trucking firm.
- Trucking?

400
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,722
He transported biohazardous
materials for the government.

401
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,030
Now how'd the FBl
find him so quickly?

402
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,763
According to Gorn,

403
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,101
Overton was on the Bureau's
terrorist watch list.

404
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,697
They'd tracked him all along.

405
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,504
Yeah, they took us
back to his room.

406
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,568
He had, like,
a dozen figurines there,

407
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,545
wax molds, the whole deal.

408
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,481
Well, what about
this traceless biological agent?

409
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,509
There was something there.
They made sure I got a picture of it.

410
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,579
It's being analyzed at Quantico.

411
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,181
I hate to be the one to say it...

412
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,420
- Then don't.
- [telephone]

413
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,131
- Kolchak.
- It's Doug Panero.

414
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,758
What kind of crap is this?
You said you wanted answers.

415
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,631
Slow down,
what are you talking about?

416
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,137
The story in the Beacon.
Glenn Overton.

417
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,366
You got to be kidding me!

418
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,500
The FBl says he's the copycat.

419
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,203
They even have proof to back it up.

420
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,303
Overton was on my suspect list
for years.

421
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,043
He's a kook, a pretender.
He couldn 't burn a match.

422
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,051
Well, they found
the figurines in his room,

423
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,917
- the wax molds, the...
- So did I. Four years ago.

424
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,287
They're putting away
a terrorist wannabe

425
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,259
when you and I both know
the real guy is still out there.

426
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,057
I'm off the story, Doug.

427
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,621
I can connect you
to Howard Gorn.

428
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,291
Gorn 's a tool in the Bureau.

429
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:19,360
I'm not talking to him, Kolchak.
I'm talking to you.

430
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,869
I-l-I can't help you.

431
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:26,308
You let this story stand,
more people are gonna end up dead.

432
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,778
You're telling me
you're OK with that?

433
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:33,077
[man on telephone] Let me know
when you get a release on it.

434
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,778
- l' ll call you back.
- All right.

435
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:36,150
Kolchak!

436
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:44,618
Carl! Where are you going?

437
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,027
I'd prefer not to say.

438
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:48,031
T ell me you're not working
on this story.

439
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,794
- OK. I'm not.
- Carl.

440
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,263
Look, Panero says
Gorn's story is a fraud.

441
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,035
- Then let him tell Gorn that.
- He doesn't trust Gorn.

442
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:59,099
Oh, so he's talking to you now?

443
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,270
Where are you going to print it?

444
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:06,179
That's right. I forgot.
You don't care about the Beacon,

445
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,276
just about
getting the story for yourself.

446
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,514
What I care about
is getting the story right,

447
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,386
which you once told
me you cared about, too.

448
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,093
[Gorn] Perri!

449
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,568
I, uh, I just wanted to say

450
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,230
that, uh, despite everything,
there's no hard feelings.

451
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,102
Oh, of course, no hard feelings.

452
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,007
I never like to leave
a pretty lady mad at me.

453
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:33,669
Right.

454
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:37,511
And, uh, about the way
you tried to work me...

455
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,483
- I am so sorry about that.
- No, don't be, don't be.

456
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,316
I admire that.

457
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:47,381
Manipulation is an essential
quality in a good reporter.

458
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,791
As for your friend Kolchak,
here...

459
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,059
Uh, may I offer you
a bit of advice?

460
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,393
Be my guest.

461
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,334
He's a fanatic,
driven by obsessions.

462
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,995
Even if he wasn't crazy...

463
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,671
he's the kind of guy who will
just drag you down. Huh?

464
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,636
- Thanks for your advice.
- Any time.

465
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,274
- Hey, Howard.
- Hmm?

466
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,684
You know, I know this is your
story, but I was wondering if...

467
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:21,454
if I could help? You know,
with research, calls, anything?

468
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,687
I, I wouldn't expect
to share a byline.

469
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,787
But just a chance to learn.

470
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,198
Why don't you let me think about it.

471
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:33,993
Thanks.

472
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,043
[elevator bell dings]

473
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,447
This is my file on Overton,

474
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,316
categorically dismissing him
as a suspect.

475
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,587
They caught him red-handed,

476
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,487
Ieaving a burning man
in someone's car.

477
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,389
Yeah, "someone." Who?

478
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,189
They haven't released a name.

479
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,127
I guarantee you, whoever it is,

480
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,461
he was not on
the T errorMaker's target list.

481
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,764
You think he's
still alive... this T errorMaker.

482
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,771
Lisa used to think it was just me.

483
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,277
That I couldn't accept
that it was over.

484
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,514
But I'm sure now... it's not.

485
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,824
Well, well, well, look at this.

486
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,918
I was just doing a little organizing.

487
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,987
Your book research is here,
your outgoing stories are over there.

488
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:37,057
Why don't we go get a drink, huh?

489
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,966
I was just going to stick around here

490
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,096
and get things in shape for tomorrow.

491
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,977
Well... all right.

492
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,378
You know, Howard,

493
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:54,782
I was wondering what was in this
bottom drawer. It's locked.

494
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,878
You don't need
to worry about that.

495
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,823
See you tomorrow.

496
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,561
- Have you seen Kolchak?
- No, why?

497
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,834
I haven't been able
to reach him all day.

498
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,138
- Think he's working on the story?
- I know he is.

499
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,405
He's not the only one.

500
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,777
What are those?

501
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,009
Oh, Gorn's files. For his book.

502
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,108
Ones he kept out
of the research library.

503
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:05,278
They left me with some questions.

504
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,517
About what?

505
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,083
This so-called
"traceless" biological agent.

506
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:16,663
Look, two instances
of people burning up

507
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,998
without ever having received
a figurine.

508
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,438
Here, a case of a Wisconsin man

509
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,974
who touched the burning man,
didn't burn up.

510
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,975
These discrepancies
have never been disclosed

511
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,879
or explained by the FBl
or Panero.

512
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,747
So you think that their theory
about this pathogen is...

513
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:36,685
Oh, God, it's weak at best.
Gorn is going right along with it,

514
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,221
just spouting the company line.

515
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,416
In exchange for access to the FBl.

516
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,289
- No doubt.
- Why would the FBl lie?

517
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,921
You know, why would Panero lie?

518
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,430
They're not. It...

519
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,858
It's the only rational explanation
they could come up with.

520
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:55,565
You're not saying that you
believe that the T errorMaker

521
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,734
killed these people with... "hellfire"?

522
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,438
Do I look crazy to you? Huh?

523
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,879
I'm just saying
that the scientific explanation

524
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:09,147
for these attacks... doesn't add up.

525
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,211
Doesn't add up at all.

526
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:18,393
Guttman kept taking
the same toll road.

527
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,657
91 west to the Five.

528
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,494
Every month. Where was he going?

529
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,000
I don't know. I don't know
that it means anything.

530
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,536
Well, it says here he kept
a locker in Bellflower.

531
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,401
Just off the 91 Freeway, isn't it?

532
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:29,906
I was thinking the same thing,

533
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,807
but I checked it out after he died.
The locker was empty.

534
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,868
I'm telling you, it's a dead end.

535
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,456
I haven't seen your wife tonight.

536
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,084
She took a drive.

537
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,723
She's not happy
you're back into all this, huh?

538
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:57,393
She wants our life back.
Whatever that is.

539
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,598
It's been so long,
I don't even know anymore.

540
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,566
I get these pictures in my head

541
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:08,772
and I keep thinking
if I could put them together,

542
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,873
I can leave this all behind.
I could move on.

543
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,849
You understand
what I'm talking about?

544
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,520
Yeah. I do.

545
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,595
Did Guttman have any relatives?

546
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,402
No. Why?

547
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,410
That storage locker in Bellflower.

548
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,641
Someone's been paying
to keep it open this past year.

549
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:08,430
Nineteen.

550
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,869
It's not locked.

551
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,748
- [Kolchak] It's not empty, either.
- No.

552
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,487
- Did you touch one?
- No.

553
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,363
- Is it the real thing?
- Sure looks like it.

554
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,266
There's wax molds. Paraffin.

555
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,940
[exhales loudly]

556
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,507
Look at this.

557
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:57,483
I think we just found your "hellfire."

558
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,155
It's a hell of a story, isn't it?

559
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:08,721
Yeah. Writing it for the Beacon
is another matter.

560
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,791
The FBl is not going
to be able to deny this now.

561
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,103
This is proof the T errorMaker
is still at work.

562
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,440
Guttman was a loner.

563
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:25,039
Only a certain amount of people
he knew could have access to the locker.

564
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,283
I already know who had access.

565
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,450
What are you talking about?

566
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,592
I've seen this ink before, Doug.

567
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,566
On the paper the T errorMaker
wrote, that said "I'm back."

568
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,563
That note?

569
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,333
No one else knew
we were on the story.

570
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,644
It's you.
You're the T errorMaker now.

571
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,147
Are you crazy?

572
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,582
You couldn't accept Guttman
was dead.

573
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,050
So you brought him back.

574
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,280
You hid what we found
in that storage locker

575
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:08,416
because if you hadn't, questions
about this case would have stopped.

576
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,517
And your life would have been over.

577
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,189
You're saying I killed these people.

578
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,994
You had the list
of the T errorMaker's victims.

579
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,230
You knew just who to target, and how.

580
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,930
You're lying.

581
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,732
I wish I was.

582
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,746
I'm the one who found him.

583
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,050
He found you.

584
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,987
You spent so long
looking for answers.

585
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,047
When you found them,

586
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,783
you lost yourself.

587
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,265
No! I can't let you say these things.

588
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,634
Doug.

589
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,272
Doug.

590
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,911
It's true, isn't it?

591
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,301
I'm sorry.

592
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,100
I'm so sorry.

593
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,945
- Doug!
- [sizzling]

594
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:44,919
No!

595
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,297
You seen this?

596
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,932
- Yeah, I've seen it.
- It's completely bogus.

597
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,911
The FBl's got it all wrong,
Gorn's reporting it as fact.

598
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:14,680
Vincenzo wants to see us. Now.

599
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:18,483
Gorn is a total fraud.
He ought to be fired.

600
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,217
We'll back you up on this, T ony.

601
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,851
That won't be necessary.
I'm letting the story stand.

602
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,656
[Perri] The story's wrong.

603
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,526
That guy Overton didn't kill Panero

604
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,189
or any of these other people.

605
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:31,860
This copycat was knee-deep
in stolen biohazardous materials.

606
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,131
The FBl has a solid case against him.

607
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,298
I can't believe
you're going along with this.

608
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,104
He is. We all are.

609
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,813
You were there.
You saw how Panero died.

610
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,247
He touched a burning man
from that storage locker!

611
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,718
Yeah, that's how he died.
But that's not what killed him.

612
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:55,618
Panero spent ten years
trying to catch a monster.

613
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,562
I think the monster finally caught him.

614
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:11,001
? Out of my head again

615
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:18,277
? Into the fire

616
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:25,150
? Faithless until the end

617
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:31,927
[Carl] Doug Panero lived
with a fear, he finally came to see.

618
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,726
A fear I know too well.

619
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,495
Of a question
that holds a terrible answer.

620
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,665
Should I ever look into the eye
of the monster I'm chasing?

621
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,868
Whose face would I see?

622
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,843
[unearthly sounds]
