1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,333
[man] I drive at night.

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,533
A police radio as my compass.

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:12,237
Looking for answers to questions
I'm only learning how to ask.

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:17,648
About things adults dismiss,
but children are right to fear.

5
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,480
Shapes that lurk in the darkness.

6
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,453
Nightmares that intrude
from another realm.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,548
Forces that spring
not from the imagination,

8
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,355
but live amongst us, unseen.

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,692
These forces have taken
something from me,

10
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,062
something I can never recover.

11
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,967
So I stalk the night,
looking, and knowing.

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,972
Our fear of the dark
never really goes away.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,374
We just learn to pretend...
it's not there.

14
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,871
Don't forget this.

15
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,041
Cold tonight.

16
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,210
I could call in sick, you know.

17
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:57,222
Oh yeah? How are we gonna
make the house payments then?

18
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,357
- Going to bed now?
- In a minute.

19
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,230
[clattering]

20
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,288
[thudding]

21
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,421
Henry?

22
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,767
[banging, smashing]

23
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,296
Ow!

24
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,973
[light bulb fizzes]

25
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:42,519
[thudding]

26
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,504
[eerie whooshing]

27
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,637
[woman screams]

28
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,614
[woman screams]

29
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,541
Perri Reed, with the Beacon.

30
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,846
Press passes.

31
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,014
I was hoping to speak
with the detective in charge.

32
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,390
I think he's already answered
your questions, Ms. Reed.

33
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,326
- We just got here.
- Yes, you did.

34
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,559
But another reporter
from your paper's already here.

35
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,869
[Perri] Hey there.

36
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,427
You're from the Beacon?

37
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,367
Carl Kolchak.

38
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,432
Hi. I'm Perri Reed,

39
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,500
and this is Jain McManus.

40
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,569
We're from the Beacon.

41
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:09,910
You can go.

42
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,741
Excuse me?

43
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,219
Well, obviously it's a mix-up but...

44
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,722
...I've got the assignment.
You can go.

45
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,089
Do you even work for the Beacon,
Mr. Horshack?

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,186
Kolchak. T oday's my first day.

47
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,894
Yeah, well, the mix-up's yours,
Mr. Kolchak,

48
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,868
because this is my story.

49
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,632
Look, I've already got the story.

50
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:35,469
And it's not the one
they're peddling outside.

51
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,771
I even took the photos.

52
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,841
What is the story?

53
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:53,852
Emily Gale, age 32,
reported missing by husband Henry, 37,

54
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,089
when he came home this morning
from his job as a night watchman.

55
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:00,132
Signs of violence suggest foul play.

56
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,168
- That it?
- No, that's not it.

57
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,863
Well, what else do you have?

58
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,234
I have confidential sources, Ms. Reed.

59
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,073
First day on the job,
you've got confidential sources?

60
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,807
And what do those sources tell you, hmm?

61
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:21,181
That even though no body's been found,

62
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:25,418
they think this is a murder,
with husband Henry prime suspect.

63
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,085
They even have a nice, juicy motive.

64
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,026
Which is?

65
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,321
Wouldn't you like to know?

66
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,060
Yeah, I would.

67
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,965
And I intend to.

68
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,871
No one actually gave you the assignment,
did they, Carl?

69
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,637
Well, you asked me to cover crime,
did you not, T ony?

70
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,613
- That's my beat. You can't...
- Perri! Please.

71
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,014
You know,
most people come in the office,

72
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,814
meet their colleagues,

73
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,014
get a desk,
before they start snagging stories.

74
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,287
- I thought you'd value my enterprise.
- And I do, Carl.

75
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,760
But Perri is senior crime reporter
at this paper.

76
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,297
- She's senior crime reporter?
- I've been here 4 years.

77
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,492
Do you know how long
I've covered crime?

78
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,966
Do I care?

79
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,629
The two of you
are expected to get along.

80
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,437
Is that clear?

81
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,667
- Crystal.
- Yes.

82
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,004
Good.

83
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,404
The story's hers.

84
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,214
- [man] Cray.
- Detective Cray, Perri Reed.

85
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,416
I'm calling about the missing woman
in the desert, Emily Gale.

86
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,858
We heard you are treating this
as a murder case.

87
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,487
None of my guys
would source information like that.

88
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,430
I can't give you anything
beyond the official statement.

89
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,161
Thank you.

90
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,760
How's it coming?

91
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,772
I need to know who your sources are.

92
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,865
A good reporter protects his sources.

93
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,105
Kolchak, you heard what Vincenzo
just said. This is my story.

94
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,238
Of course. You can use my information.

95
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,975
No, I can't.

96
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,779
Not without knowing
who your sources are.

97
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:07,691
Perri. You do want to know
the nice, juicy motive, don't you?

98
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:13,530
- What is it?
- [whispers] Come here.

99
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,101
Emily Gale was pregnant.

100
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,573
And that's why they think he killed her.

101
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,545
Yo!

102
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,718
[buzzing]

103
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,331
[clamoring]

104
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,413
[reporter] Where were you
when your wife disappeared?

105
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,780
- Mr. Medlock, who killed your sister?
- Your brother-in-law?

106
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,614
[Jain] Hey. What are they saying?

107
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,520
Officially, Gale's being questioned
for the murder of his pregnant wife.

108
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,593
Her fetus was torn from her body.

109
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,458
Oh, man. T orn how?

110
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,555
It doesn't say.

111
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,100
And they're still looking
for the murder weapon.

112
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,531
It's just like Kolchak said?

113
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,038
Yep.

114
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,438
How did he know?

115
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,611
Mr. Medlock? I'm sorry for your loss.

116
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,877
Do we have to do this?

117
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:42,443
A member of the family
has to make the identification, sir.

118
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:49,561
Honey, the doctor needs to see
Daddy and me alone for a minute.

119
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,859
Are you OK waiting here?

120
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,728
OK.

121
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,806
[Carl] It's a little scary, isn't it?

122
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,371
The bodies of dead people
used to scare me too.

123
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,678
Until I realized that...

124
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:19,851
...well, the people living in those
bodies, they're not there anymore.

125
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,854
They went someplace else.

126
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,364
I'm still afraid.

127
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,297
Of what?

128
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,328
Of what's out there.

129
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,441
- Who are you?
- Carl Kolchak.

130
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,277
Honey, wait out there.
How the hell did you get in here?

131
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,614
I'm writing about your sister. Police
think your brother-in-law killed her.

132
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,884
Of course he did!
How dare you come in here?

133
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,281
Come on.

134
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,485
Come on, let's go.

135
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,462
Mrs. Medlock?

136
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,946
- Come to gloat?
- You've got the story.

137
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:16,948
Yeah. The same one as everyone else.

138
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,314
- Not necessarily.
- What's that?

139
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,148
Emily Gale's brother and his wife.

140
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,620
- You talked to them?
- We had a chat in the morgue.

141
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,250
- May l...
- Of course. It's for you.

142
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,057
You see,
he believes his brother-in-law's guilty,

143
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,656
- but the wife doesn't.
- She said that?

144
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,430
She didn't exactly.
But she gave me this look.

145
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,937
A look. She gave you a look?

146
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,372
Well,
she obviously believes he's innocent.

147
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,672
I see. So who does she believe
killed Emily Gale?

148
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,770
Well, that's up to you to find out.

149
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,009
But you want a fresh angle,
that's the lead.

150
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,545
Carl.

151
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,788
Why can't you let this story go?

152
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,492
I'm the little pig
that built my house of straw!

153
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,301
[Medlock] Just running to the store.
I'll be right back, Petunia.

154
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,167
[door closes]

155
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,374
[TV] I'm the smart little piggy.
I built my house of bricks!

156
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,623
[shower]

157
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,362
[door handle clicking]

158
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,166
[door handle clicking]

159
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,698
[door handle clicking]

160
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,349
[door handle clicking]

161
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,590
[thumping]

162
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,853

00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,176
[eerie whooshing]

00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,680
[jaunty tune]

165
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,618
[light bulb fizzing]

166
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,931
Julie?

167
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,072
[screaming]

168
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,555
[creaking]

169

[heavy breathing]

170

[screaming]

171
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,522
I just returned from the hospital,
where my wife, Trish,

172
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,191
is in the lCU fighting for her life.

173
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,002
My daughter's out there somewhere.

174
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,500
If you took Julie,
please bring her back.

175
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:07,978
[Medlock] I'm begging you.

176
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,611
Carl!

177
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,988
Thank you. How'd it go?

178
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,526
Aw, lots of questions, no answers.

179
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,721
They're now looking for a serial killer.

180
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,559
They think the little girl's dead?

181
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,826
Well,
they aren't telling the father that.

182
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,859
Call Henry Gale's attorney. See if he'll
talk now charges have been dropped.

183
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,770
Wow. Kolchak, I would have thought

184
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,105
you would have tried
to get that interview for yourself.

185
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:41,408
- I did, actually.
- Without asking me first?

186
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,311
Yeah, he wouldn't return my calls.

187
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,850
Seeing as you're
the senior crime reporter, hm?

188
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,681
That's good thinking, Carl,

189
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,847
but the, uh, interview's
already been granted.

190
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,517
- Really?
- Wanna come?

191
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,389
Gumby do something to piss you off?

192
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,903
You knew I had that Henry Gale interview
before you asked.

193
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,873
- Yeah, I did.
- That's what I thought.

194
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,836
[Perri] Ed Medlock thought
you killed his sister, Mr. Gale.

195
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,508
Have you spoken to your brother-in-law?

196
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,245
I know what he told you.

197
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,085
[Gale] I guess,
when there are no answers,

198
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,216
people get desperate for an explanation.

199
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,854
Sometimes,
they believe the unbelievable.

200
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,730
Did... Did you see or hear anything
before you left?

201
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,997
Like, say... an animal?

202
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,771
An animal?

203
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,710
Yeah, um, sometimes coyotes come down,
get in the garbage cans.

204
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,907
I didn't think anything of it.

205
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:54,043
But did you... actually see this coyote?

206
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,617
No. Why? Is that important?

207
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,855
Thank you, Mr. Gale.

208
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,124
What was that about?

209
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,443
Good morning.

210
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,317
Morning. Hi.

211
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:07,155
- [ringing tone]
- Agent Fain.

212
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,127
Agent Fain, hi, I'm Perri Reed
with the L.A. Beacon.

213
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,789
How can I help you,
Perri Reed from the L.A. Beacon?

214
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:17,564
- I'm calling about Carl Kolchak?
- Carl Kolchak? Where is he?

215
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,304
He works with me here at the Beacon.

216
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,034
Is that right?

217
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,303
I know he worked for the paper
in Las Vegas,

218
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,039
and he was being questioned
regarding a murder case.

219
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,308
Are you writing a story about this,
Ms. Reed?

220
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,783
'Cause none of Kolchak's buddies
out here in Vegas would.

221
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,948
Is there a story?

222
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,922
Oh, hell yes there is,
if you're willing to write it.

223
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,221
Carl Kolchak is a murderer.

224
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:53,093
- Hey. Got a minute?
- Y eah, sure.

225
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:58,732
All right, when you asked Henry Gale
about an animal, it got me thinking.

226
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,307
These are shots I took
from the Gale home and the motel.

227
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:06,010
Now, I wasn't trying
to photograph the dirt, but look.

228
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:11,684
Tracks. They're pretty much all
just partials, but then I found this.

229
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,221
- An ambulance?
- No. Behind it.

230
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,529
What the hell is it, Kolchak?

231
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,425
- Ms. Reed?
- Agent Fain.

232
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,658
- Thank you for taking the time.
- Of course.

233
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,893
What is it you want me to see out here?

234
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,232
This is where Kolchak killed his wife.

235
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:03,166
- Are you sure about that?
- Course that's not his story.

236
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,806
[Fain] Kolchak says he pulled over
to avoid a head-on collision.

237
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,143
[gasps] Carl!

238
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,417
[Fain] That's when he said it happened.

239
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,647
[gasps] Carl!

240
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,717
What was it?

241
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,884
He said he never got a good look at it.

242
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,863
He claimed that, whatever it was,
it wasn't human.

243
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:44,748
Pretty convenient, don't you think?

244
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,717
Killing his wife, leaving him alive.

245
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:50,311
He was never charged?

246
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,516
Insufficient evidence.

247
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:56,391
I've answered your questions, Ms. Reed.
Now, answer mine.

248
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,986
Why are you investigating Carl Kolchak?

249
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:05,332
The ambulance was parked back there
when I took the picture.

250
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:10,239
Which means, whatever it was,
it was running over here.

251
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,005
- How do you know that?
- These marks.

252
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:15,069
One set here, and one over there.

253
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:19,279
So, there's two of these things?

254
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,581
Well, at least.

255
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,848
- But no drag marks.
- Drag marks?

256
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:27,016
Emily Gale's body was dragged.

257
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,253
But there's no drag marks here
and no blood.

258
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,262
Which means what?

259
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,359
Maybe they didn't drag her off.
Maybe they carried her off.

260
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,096
Instead of looking for her body,

261
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,537
the police should be looking
for that little girl alive.

262
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:42,801
I don't understand.

263
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,468
What kind of animal
carries off a little girl?

264
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,411
Who said this thing's an animal?

265
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,778
It's not an animal,
but it leaves tracks.

266
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,044
OK, now you're freaking me out.

267
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,826
Perri? What's going on?

268
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,065
If it isn't my old friend Carl.

269
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,537
Agent Fain.

270
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,902
I talked to the authorities out here,
Carl.

271
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:21,844
It seems this case
that you're, um, investigating

272
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,404
has uncanny similarities
to your wife's murder.

273
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,280
What?

274
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,429
- Where is he?
- Being questioned.

275
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,061
I have you to thank for this?

276
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,231
You knew what happened and didn't say.

277
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,639
- It's nobody's business.
- Hiring a murderer?

278
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,801
Accused murderer.

279
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:54,345
That's reassuring.

280
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,412
It's not my job to reassure you.

281
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,247
Were you aware Kolchak
claimed a beast killed his wife,

282
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,290
and a judge ordered him
held for psychiatric evaluation?

283
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,587
- He recanted that story.
- After six months.

284
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,253
- The FBl considers him a suspect.
- That's all he is.

285
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,263
Regardless of how you feel about him,

286
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,664
you have to wonder why he's been
so interested in this case.

287
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,261
You mean why a man would be drawn
to a story that closely mirrors his own?

288
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:27,339
Five years ago,

289
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:31,109
I'm working the night desk
at the Vegas Daily News...

290
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,014
when this kid walks in.

291
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,816
He says he's got proof that Freemar
Holdings is paying off city officials.

292
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,048
Freemar graft case?

293
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,148
That kid was Kolchak.

294
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:43,626
It turned into the biggest corruption
scandal in Nevada history.

295
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,560
Made my career.

296
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,188
And his.

297
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,231
For two years, he lived that story 24-7.

298
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:56,066
The DA brought 32 indictments,
got 28 convictions.

299
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,871
But the capper is...

300
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:01,378
the day old man Freemar himself
is convicted,

301
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,708
Kolchak is a no-show.

302
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:03,839
Where was he?

303
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:06,679
Irene was sick.
He stayed home to take care of her.

304
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,583
And he missed...

305
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:13,750
the biggest day
of the biggest story of his career.

306
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:19,586
So do I think Kolchak went to pieces
when his wife died? Course I do.

307
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,723
But killed her? Mm-mm.

308
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,728
The prisoner emerges.

309
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,038
[T ony] They done with you?

310
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:32,565
For now. All they have
is their fevered imaginations.

311
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,185
Thanks for the lift.

312
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,520
Hey, Kolchak?

313
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,617
When I went to the FBl,
I was just asking questions.

314
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,254
I didn't mean to get you arrested.

315
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,660
But you're not sure I'm innocent,
either, are you?

316
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,069
Perri?

317
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,406
- That's your house, right?
- Yeah.

318
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,844
Why's your front door busted open?

319
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,927
[Perri] Oh, my God.

320
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,661
Agent Fain, I presume.

321
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,434
Let me help you clean this up.

322
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,641
I need a beer. How about you?

323
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:45,048
Sure.

324
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,179
- [Carl] Bottle OK?
- That's fine.

325
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,856
[Carl] It's my wife.

326
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,630
Why would you keep these?

327
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,359
Look at her left hand.

328
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:41,028
- What is it?
- I don't know.

329
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,438
But she didn't have it before she died.

330
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,504
It's the same marks here in Seattle,
five months ago.

331
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,050
And again in Sacramento, six weeks ago.

332
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,847
And again, and again, and again.

333
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,049
So all these people were killed
by the same thing that killed your wife?

334
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,221
That's just it. None of them were.

335
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,494
Laura Brau, convinced someone's
gonna burn her to death,

336
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,728
Iocks herself in her house.

337
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:16,332
Next morning her body's found
incinerated by 2,500 degree heat,

338
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,070
but the floor beneath her
isn't even singed.

339
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,442
Glenn Barger kills himself in ldaho.

340
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:25,779
His suicide note confesses to three
murders, correct in every detail.

341
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,251
Only the murders
are committed after his death.

342
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:33,951
Andre and Arlene Bormanis move
into an old house with two children.

343
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,687
They report strange sounds,
think they have a ghost.

344
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:41,198
The police ignore it, until
they're all found hanging in the attic.

345
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:47,136
- I don't understand the connection.
- I don't either.

346
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,366
But there is one.

347
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,207
You never had any confidential sources,
did you?

348
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,940
You knew Emily Gale's murder
would match your wife's

349
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,505
before the police did. How?

350
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,676
Maybe it's like Agent Fain said.

351
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,549
Maybe I know because I did kill her.

352
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,549
Or?

353
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,925
The body of a drifter
was found in the desert last week,

354
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:14,329
not two miles from Emily Gale's house.

355
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,629
She was killed the same way.

356
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,568
But if you knew they
were coming for someone,

357
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,574
- why wouldn't you go get help?
- From who? My psychiatrist?

358
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,500
Why kill that woman
and take that little girl?

359
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:28,512
Why kill your wife?

360
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,639
And why not you?

361
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,910
My wife had a secret
that she was gonna tell me...

362
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,785
the night she died.

363
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,857
I didn't find out what it was
until the autopsy.

364
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,199
She was pregnant.

365
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:53,362
They tore the fetus from her body.

366
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,315
Did Emily Gale
have that same mark on her body?

367
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,552
I don't know. They won't release
the autopsy photos.

368
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,618
So what about all these other people?

369
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,857
You're telling me
they all have this mark?

370
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,161
Most of them don't.
But some do.

371
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,103
All these strange deaths.
They're like pieces in a puzzle.

372
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,802
A puzzle I'm trying to put together.

373
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,276
Something terrible is happening.

374
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,140
But no one sees it
'cause no one wants to.

375
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,021
I think I could use that beer now.

376
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,189
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

377
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,525
I think it's like the man said.

378
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,271
You desperately want an explanation,

379
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,837
so you believe the unbelievable.

380
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,400
That little girl is still out there.

381
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,505
I'm the only one asking questions
that could save her.

382
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,447
[phone rings]

383
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,578
[Carl] Yeah?

384
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,555
OK, I'll be right there.

385
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,649
That was Jain.
He just responded to a call

386
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,354
about some wild animals
near a girls' school.

387
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,879
- What happened?
- Girl inside heard scratching.

388
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,816
When the headmistress looked,
she saw something run off.

389
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:51,447
- She told the police it was an animal.
- That what you're basing this on?

390
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:55,289
That, and those tracks that we found
at the motel, they're here, too.

391
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,306
- That's why they left.
- The lights?

392
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,776
They're on motion sensors.

393
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,574
- Look.
- [Perri] What's this prove?

394
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,912
[Jain] That these things
Kolchak's looking for were here.

395
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,781
Or wolves, or coyotes, or armadillos,
for all I know.

396
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:22,911
Armadillos?

397
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:26,479
All I'm saying is that
this proof of yours is anything but.

398
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,550
What are you doing?

399
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,720
Hunting.

400
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:35,095
- Gimme the keys.
- What for?

401
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,624
You can ride home with Elmer Fudd.
I've had enough.

402
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,143
[faint growling]

403
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,091
[cooing]

404
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,037
- [eerie whooshing]
- [Perri yells]

405
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,178
[squealing tires]

406
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,161
You OK?

407
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,225
Kolchak!

408
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,449
- It's a coyote.
- What?

409
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:03,351
The common Canis Iatrans,
found throughout North America.

410
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,787
Doesn't look like any coyote
I've ever seen.

411
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,553
It was badly mangled
when Kolchak hit it, son.

412
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,618
Release the body. We can get
confirmation of your findings.

413
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,391
- That's not possible.
- Why not?

414
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,456
Animal Control picked up the body
a half hour ago.

415
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,796
It's been cremated.

416
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,064
[Jain] Aw, you gotta be kidding me!

417
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,974
You can write the story anyway.

418
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:36,043
- Saying what?
- What happened. What really happened.

419
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,816
That we saw a coyote
and mistook it for something else?

420
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,620
The hottest places in hell
are reserved for those who,

421
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,127
in times of moral crisis,
remain neutral.

422
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,628
What are you talking about?

423
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:49,963
- Did that look like a coyote to you?
- No. It didn't. But why would they lie?

424
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:53,333
Fain's so desperate to put me away,
he'd suppress any evidence

425
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,338
Iinking my wife's death to Emily Gale.

426
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:58,898
Fain told me there were human footprints
outside Emily Gale's house.

427
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,469
Why won't he release the autopsy photos?
He knows what they show.

428
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,983
That Emily Gale's body has the same mark
as lrene's did.

429
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,018
Only she didn't.

430
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,451
I got Fain to release the photos.

431
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,093
Sorry, Kolchak.
She doesn't have the mark.

432
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,800
I know how badly you want answers, Carl.

433
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,470
T o know who or...

434
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,449
...what killed your wife.

435
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,980
- She was afraid.
- Your wife?

436
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,648
That little girl.

437
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,555
Julie.

438
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:52,255
When I met her, she said she was afraid
of what's out there.

439
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:55,522
She probably knew the killer.

440
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,568
She's not dead, Perri.

441
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,796
I know you want to believe that, Carl.

442
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:03,307
And, trust me, so do l.
But it's been two days...

443
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,537
There were no drag marks
outside the motel and no blood.

444
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:09,546
I'm telling you, they carried her away.

445
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,211
"They"?

446
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,915
Maybe... these aren't the same
things that killed my wife.

447
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,985
Whatever they are,
they killed Emily Gale,

448
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,925
and they took that little girl.

449
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:29,729
So these animals, they have purpose?
Intelligence?

450
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,463
[Jain] Somebody order piping hot coffee?

451
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,095
[bleeping]

452
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,841
- What is it?
- Come on.

453
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,242
"Come on"? I've got the coffees.

454
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,371
The vapor I sprayed outside the school

455
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,076
- was a sort of chemical LoJack.
- What's it tracking?

456
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,710
The other one of those "coyotes",
I guess.

457
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,899
[Carl] This is near where
Emily Gale's body was found.

458
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,335
[bleeping]

459
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,566
[Carl]
The signal's coming from that cave.

460
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,253
- [Jain] What happened?
- [Carl] Lost the signal.

461
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,601
- You think she's down there.
- I intend to find out.

462
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,369
- We're going down there?
- That's what I had in mind.

463
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,034
T ake this.

464
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,476
- What is it?
- Cattle prod.

465
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,514
- Cattle prod?
- [electrical buzzing]

466
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,072
You have like a gun or something?

467
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,176
[Jain] I think a gun might be better.

468
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,346
- You ever used a gun before?
- No.

469
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:00,083
- As I thought.
- I've never used a cattle prod...

470
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,420
Shh!

471
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,689
- [child sobbing]
- [Carl] You hear that?

472
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,457
That's her.

473
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,707
[distant screaming]

474
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,715
[Jain] Hey, hey.

475
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,774
[Perri] What is it?

476
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:31,285
[Jain] I don't know.

477
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,849
[squealing, wings flapping]

478
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,172
It was... bats.

479
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,535
Great.

480
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,239
[child screaming, sobbing]

481
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,417
[eerie swooshing]

482
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,226
[Perri] That's no little girl.

483
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,737
[Perri] Think we went the wrong way?

484
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,180
[Carl] I don't think so.

485
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,740
[sobbing]

486
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:34,910
Julie!

487
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,213
[child] Here.

488
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,193
[Carl grunts]

489
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,756
[sobbing]

490
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:53,000
- Julie!
- [rocks crumbling]

491
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,066
[distant splashing]

492
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:59,904
We're gonna get you out of here, OK?
T ake you home.

493
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,535
[eerie whooshing]

494
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,311
- Carl!
- Yeah, I got her.

495
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,612
I need you to jump.

496
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,480
Come on.

497
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,548
[Carl] That's right.

498
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,661
Don't look down.
Look at me. Look at me.

499
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,063
- [eerie whining]
- [Jain] Kolchak!

500
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,561
[Julie sobs]

501
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,437
- I'm afraid.
- I won't let you fall, OK?

502
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,669
I promise.

503
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,677
[whooshing]

504
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,013
Come on. I won't let you fall.

505
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:42,318
[Carl] That's right.

506
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,286
Look at me. Look at me.

507
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,153
[Julie screams]

508
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,957
[Carl] I got you. I got you.

509
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,087
- [Carl] Let's go!
- [roaring]

510
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,132
[Perri] Let's go!

511
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:06,707
- [eerie whining]
- [Julie shrieks]

512
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,836
- [roaring]
- [whooshing]

513
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,717
[whooshing]

514
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,013
[Jain groans]

515
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,945
[Julie screams]

516
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,691
[Perri] Come on, Jain!

517
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:24,250
- [Jain yells]
- [Julie screams]

518
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,690
[shrieking]

519
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,041
[revving engine]

520
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,636
[squealing]

521
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,875
[screaming]

522
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:05,493
? I can see it all tonight

523
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,834
? Underneath a perfect sky

524
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:14,469
? Where the universe revolves
around the pupil of an eye

525
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:19,881
? And infinities stretch out
from infinities within

526
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,283
? I'm a part of everything

527
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,846
? I'm a part of everything

528
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,325
? Am I falling asleep?

529
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:37,299
? Is it all just a dream?

530
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,030
? And the cars are like water

531
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,538
? And the road is like a stream

532
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,837
? Rolling down through the city

533
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,743
? Flowing out into the city

534
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:51,441
? Going nowhere like me

535
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:56,612
? Going nowhere like me ?

536
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,129
Morning.

537
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,258
Want to explain this story you wrote?

538
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,825
- What about it?
- It says the police are looking

539
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:15,167
- for whoever kidnapped the girl.
- They are.

540
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,402
Julie can't remember anything
about how she got into that cave.

541
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,967
But that's not the... [hushed] point.

542
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:24,947
You didn't write what we saw,
what you believe.

543
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:28,451
How long would I last if I wrote
what I believed? How long would you?

544
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,817
- The public has a right to know.
- The public?

545
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,446
The public doesn't wanna know.

546
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:38,150
Look, these are things
I need to find out,

547
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:40,424
to understand, for myself.

548
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,864
And when you get your answers?

549
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:47,233
Then I'll print them. And then
they'll believe. Then they'll have to.

550
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,263
I'm watching you.

551
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,433
Well, you are the senior crime reporter.

552
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,480
Yes, I am.

553
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,344
That reminds me.

554
00:41:58,415 --> 00:42:02,112
I've been covering crime for four years.
How long have you?

555
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,710
Five.

556
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,687
That's what I thought.

557
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,797
[Carl] As a reporter, I seek answers
to the questions that haunt me.

558
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,695
- [radio]... victims mutilated.
- [Carl] But the stories,

559
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:25,799
the real stories,
you won 't find printed in any newspaper.

560
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,937
Stories of strange deaths.

561
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,876
Endless suffering.

562
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,416
Horrors we can only pretend to explain.

563
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:45,318
And these are the stories
I live to write.

564
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:49,890
Driven by the faith that one day
people will read them and understand.

565
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,128
Haunted by the fear
that the answers I seek

566
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,033
Iie not in the darkness without,

567
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,070
but the darkness... within.
