1
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,902
Honey,
all I'm asking you to do.

2
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:06,796
Is change his name.

3
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,241
No.

4
00:02:08,273 --> 00:02:09,685
No, no, no, no,
you don't understand.

5
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:11,481
We'll be in so much trouble
if you don't.

6
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:13,478
I swear to God,
we'll be hit by lawsuits.

7
00:02:13,506 --> 00:02:15,913
From every angle possible.

8
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:17,774
Thank you, sweetheart.

9
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:19,282
Okay.

10
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:21,014
Well, I'll give it
to the legals,

11
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:23,888
But if they say it's a no,
then it's a no.

12
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:25,975
Okay, yeah, well,
I've got to go.

13
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:27,419
See you soon.

14
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:30,259
Sorry about that.

15
00:02:30,292 --> 00:02:31,640
No, that's okay.

16
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,919
Ah, Paula, how have you been?

17
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:35,267
Fine.
Yeah.

18
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,294
Getting there.

19
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:37,642
And how's the work coming on?

20
00:02:37,676 --> 00:02:39,471
Um, you know.

21
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:40,997
It'll come.

22
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,713
Yeah, well, I know it will.

23
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:43,916
You're too good a writer.

24
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,089
For that talent
just to disappear.

25
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:46,919
It just doesn't happen.

26
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,919
Now, I don't want to put
any more pressure on you,

27
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:52,343
But we do have responsibilities,

28
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,702
And ours is our deadline.

29
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:56,467
I've got the printers
and the whole shebang.

30
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,943
Primed and ready to roll.

31
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,292
Yeah, I know you have.

32
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:03,047
You know what's funny?

33
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,423
Most... most writers
come to see me.

34
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:07,862
Chomping at the bit
for attention,

35
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,268
Almost willing to get themselves
into a lawsuit.

36
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:11,826
To get a piece of the action...

37
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,927
A piece of success, but...

38
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,276
But you...

39
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:16,945
I do want success.

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,801
Oh, it's just...

41
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:23,686
Come with me.

42
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:33,572
Look at that.

43
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:36,846
All those people.
All that noise.

44
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,253
How can you think,
let alone write in this?

45
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:41,564
Get away for a while.

46
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,405
Go back home and get some rest,

47
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:45,673
And try and get back in touch
with your writing.

48
00:03:45,706 --> 00:03:47,213
I can't just leave.

49
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:48,882
Trust me!
Just go.

50
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:52,124
It'll do you the wealth of good.

51
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:19,149
Sync and corrections by R3V0LV3R.

52
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:42,260

54
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,263

Ooh.

62
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:03,275
Deal with you later.

63
00:06:29,386 --> 00:06:30,430
Oi.

64
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:32,146
Gonna give me a heart attack?

65
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,106
Precious.

66
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,801
Mm?
Yeah.

67
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,915
Oh, you're gorgeous,
aren't you?

68
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,461
Excuse me.

69
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:54,069
Sara.

70
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:55,513
Sara Phillips.

71
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:57,680
Hmm?

72
00:06:57,713 --> 00:06:59,445
Robert Gainer.

73
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:00,472
<i>Book review.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

74
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:02,302
Yeah, I know who you are.

75
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:04,309
Ahh.

76
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,122
Of course you do.

77
00:07:06,156 --> 00:07:08,112
I just wondered if I could ask
you a couple of questions.

78
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:09,588
About Paula Martin.

79
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:12,863
Look, I'm...

80
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:14,897
I'm sorry.
I'm kind of busy at the moment.

81
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:17,355
Um...

82
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:19,351
Could you call the office
in the morning?

83
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,535
And we'll deal with it then.
I'm sure it can wait.

84
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:23,005
Ah, yes, well,

85
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:25,508
I've been trying
to contact you via the office.

86
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,146
For over a month now.

87
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,873
I'm just getting
the runaround, you know?

88
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,254
"She's not in today.

89
00:07:31,287 --> 00:07:33,051
"She's at lunch.
She's away from her desk.

90
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,026
She'll call you tomorrow."

91
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:36,743
Not avoiding my calls,
are you, Sara?

92
00:07:36,777 --> 00:07:38,540
'Cause that's what
it's starting to feel like.

93
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:41,670
This conversation should not
be happening here, Robert.

94
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:44,527
All I want is an interview
with your client Paula Martin.

95
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,714
That's all.

96
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:48,185
Paula is busy, I'm afraid.

97
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:49,807
Ah, yes.

98
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,781
Writing her second novel.

99
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:53,996
Yeah, exactly.

100
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,889
That's not what I heard, Sara.

101
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:57,895
Oh?
And what did you hear?

102
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:02,003
Well, a little bird told me.

103
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:04,604
That Paula Martin
had a breakdown.

104
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:07,653
Just after her last book
went number one.

105
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:09,708
Now, that's not unusual.

106
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,665
There's a lot of it about.

107
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:13,270
Just let her talk to me.

108
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:14,490
Get it out in the open.

109
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:16,384
Might free her up.

110
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:17,876
It's a win-win situation, Sara.

111
00:08:17,908 --> 00:08:21,214
Listen, Mr. Gainer.

112
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,102
There's nothing wrong
with my client.

113
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,644
She's in the country
as we speak,

114
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:27,600
Working quite happily
on her next book,

115
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:30,555
Away from...
from people like you.

116
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:32,336
She doesn't do interviews.

117
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:33,685
You should know that,

118
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:35,401
And if I read in your
magazine gossip column.

119
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:37,119
That Paula Martin
had a breakdown,

120
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:38,756
I'll use every penny we have
taking you to court.

121
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,040
Do you understand me?

122
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:41,933
Now, before you
say anything else,

123
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:44,516
Go back to where you came from
and sit down.

124
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:46,763
You're embarrassing me
and yourself.

125
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:51,033
Okay.

126
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:53,889
But I will get that interview,
Sara, believe me.

127
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:56,392
And gossip isn't really gossip.

128
00:08:56,426 --> 00:08:59,666
If the story's correct, right?

129
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,144
Just tell her
I'd like to talk to her,

130
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:02,459
If you don't mind.

131
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:04,065
Thank you very much.

132
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:05,130
Excuse me.

133
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,765
You are kidding me!

134
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,122
Oh, God.

135
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,842
Hello?

136
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:34,941
Hello, Leo.

137
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:36,799
It's Paula.

138
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:39,344
Are you all right?

139
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,314
Everything's confusing me.

140
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:43,779
I mean, this fucking house.

141
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:45,732
I haven't been here for years.

142
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,375
Just calm down.

143
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:49,942
I'm sure Sara will help you.

144
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:52,184
Mm, yeah.

145
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:53,850
Yeah, you're right.

146
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:55,227
I'll call Sara.

147
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,277
She could rent me a place
in London or something,

148
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,638
Couldn't she?

149
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,853
Exactly.

150
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:01,503
I just knew
it was a stupid idea.

151
00:13:01,537 --> 00:13:03,041
Coming back here.

152
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:07,875
Uh, look, Leo,

153
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:09,381
I've really got to go.

154
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:11,751
No.
No, no, no.

155
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:14,472
I'll call you
when I get out of this place.

156
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:17,482
Yeah.
Bye.

157
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:23,263
Just wanted to check
if there's anything special.

158
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:25,104
You need doing.

159
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,056
Uh, no, that's okay.
I was just on the phone.

160
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,690
The room
should be clean enough.

161
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,891
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

162
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:32,004
I'm Mrs. Brown,
the housekeeper.

163
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:34,214
Two days a week,
mondays and thursdays,

164
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,720
9:00 till 5:00.

165
00:13:35,753 --> 00:13:36,712
Mondays is my wash day.

166
00:13:36,744 --> 00:13:38,378
Two days a week.

167
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,514
Ooh, that looks nasty, dear.

168
00:13:39,547 --> 00:13:40,795
What happened to you?

169
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,380
Oh, it's nothing.

170
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:44,046
I just caught it on a nail.
Stupid.

171
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:45,917
Oh, well, I'll be down
in the kitchen.

172
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,647
Why don't I have
a look at it for you?

173
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,928
I can clean it up.

174
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:02,114
You know, you really should
get to a hospital with that.

175
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:04,324
Why don't I
clean it up for you,

176
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:06,854
And you get yourself
down there in a taxi?

177
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:08,710
It's not far.

178
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:11,144
In fact, I could come with you.

179
00:14:11,178 --> 00:14:13,450
I need a couple
of things in town.

180
00:14:13,483 --> 00:14:14,956
Ah, I can't, really.

181
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,620
I'm meant to be writing.

182
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:17,885
Really, dear?

183
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,070
Writing what?

184
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:20,383
A book.

185
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,016
Really?

186
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:23,713
With a hand like this?

187
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,891
Do you ever hear from my uncle?

188
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:28,933
No.

189
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,366
I haven't heard
from him in years.

190
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,320
Well, he was traveling
the far east,

191
00:14:33,353 --> 00:14:35,145
Last thing we knew.

192
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:37,178
Still, pays the wages,

193
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:38,524
Pays the bills,

194
00:14:38,557 --> 00:14:40,653
Keeps this place going,

195
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:43,167
So we carry on as normal,

196
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,319
And when he gets back,

197
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:47,522
It'll all be just as he left it.

198
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,923
When was the last time
you were here?

199
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:53,366
Oh, must be...

200
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,519
Oh, I don't know.

201
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:55,928
Um, I can't remember.

202
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,801
Well, I've been here nine.

203
00:14:57,834 --> 00:14:59,339
Really?
Is it that long?

204
00:14:59,371 --> 00:15:00,699
Gosh.

205
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:02,728
Last few years have been
a bit of a blur.

206
00:15:04,895 --> 00:15:08,560
Look, I do know
how this is gonna sound,

207
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:11,186
But do you ever think
this place is haunted?

208
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:13,524
Haunted?

209
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:15,301
What makes you say that, dear?

210
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:17,431
Well, it's just...

211
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:18,920
Just what?

212
00:15:19,994 --> 00:15:22,074
It's just me.

213
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:25,131
Well, this is a very old house,

214
00:15:25,164 --> 00:15:28,079
And old houses
have lots of secrets.

215
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:29,167
Yeah.

216
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,104
I know I'm just being
a bit silly.

217
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:33,825
You know where I am
if you need me.

218
00:15:33,859 --> 00:15:36,036
Oh, and there's Joshua,
the young gardener.

219
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,765
Ah, yes, I heard him.

220
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:40,167
- Two days a week,
- 9:00 till 5:00.

221
00:15:40,168 --> 00:15:42,011
Got his work cut out
keeping this place together.

222
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,609
So have I.

223
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,283
Now, look, I'm gonna give you
a couple of painkillers.

224
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:48,204
They might make you
a bit drowsy,

225
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:49,452
But from the looks of you,

226
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:51,599
I don't think a few hours' sleep
would go amiss.

227
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,072
I have Robert Gainer
on the line.

228
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:05,961
Said he wants to make an apology
for last night.

229
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:08,939
And to see if you've
changed your mind.

230
00:16:08,971 --> 00:16:10,252
He's on line one.

231
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:12,270
Tell him I'm out at lunch.

232
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:13,454
All day.

233
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:52,425
Paula.

234
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,690
Paula.

235
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:54,891
I have something for you.

236
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:02,992
Sara sent me.

237
00:17:03,026 --> 00:17:04,978
She said you were
having trouble concentrating,

238
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:07,380
And I was to help
take the pressure off.

239
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:08,933
Help speed up
the writing process.

240
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:11,783
And get you out of this place
as quickly as we can.

241
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:13,658
She said that's
what you wanted...

242
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:18,923
And by the looks of things,
you could use the help.

243
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,461
Are you okay?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

244
00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:22,702
It's nothing.

245
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:24,608
Yeah, she's right.
It's...

246
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,490
It's been a struggle,
what with one thing and another.

247
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:29,347
It's like this house
doesn't want me to work.

248
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,036
It doesn't want me
to write this book.

249
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,830
Sorry, I know
how stupid that must sound.

250
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:34,840
No.

251
00:17:34,872 --> 00:17:36,168
No, you're an artist.

252
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:39,690
You're sensitive
to your surroundings.

253
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,932
And what beautiful surroundings.

254
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:44,157
Oh, yes.

255
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,151
It, um...
it belongs to my uncle.

256
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:48,368
He could be dead
for all they know.

257
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,744
They just
keep it running for him.

258
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,562
I spent quite a lot of time here
when I was a kid...

259
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:54,548
Summer holidays,
a few christmases.

260
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:56,054
How wonderful.

261
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:57,078
Yeah.

262
00:17:58,312 --> 00:17:59,561
Distractions?

263
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:06,828
How am I supposed to work
with constant noise like that?

264
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:10,752
Well, I wasn't really
thinking about the noise.

265
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:18,886
Just going into town
to get those few bits.

266
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:20,070
I'll see you later.

267
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,409
Don't hurry back.

268
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:27,628
Do you fancy a glass of wine?

269
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,925
I'd love one.

270
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:30,685
Come on.

271
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:31,603
I'll get it.

272
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:45,969
So tell me about the book.

273
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:48,433
To be honest with you,

274
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:50,964
There's not much to tell
at the moment.

275
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,877
Inspiration hasn't been
exactly forthcoming.

276
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,447
The last book that I wrote.

277
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:58,040
Has been like a millstone.

278
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,217
I mean, maybe...
who knows?

279
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:02,363
Maybe that was it.

280
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,468
No, no.

281
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:04,637
Come on, I read your last book.

282
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:06,302
I know it well.

283
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:07,487
It was controversial.

284
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,928
It made people think.

285
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,273
That's why it was
such a success.

286
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:12,450
Definitely not the work
of a one-hit wonder.

287
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:16,292
Can I be honest with you?

288
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:17,958
Hmm?

289
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,481
You need to have
more faith in yourself.

290
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:23,594
You just have
a touch of anxiety.

291
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:25,772
Little bit of writer's block?

292
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:28,430
They say
write about what you know.

293
00:19:28,462 --> 00:19:30,575
That's always
a good place to start.

294
00:19:30,609 --> 00:19:33,169
You must have the beginnings
of an idea to come out here.

295
00:19:35,123 --> 00:19:36,928
Kind of.
Well, I thought I did.

296
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:42,103
It's just...

297
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,447
It's my head.

298
00:19:43,481 --> 00:19:46,106
It's not been in the right place.

299
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:48,540
For a couple of years.

300
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:53,056
I was sick, and I had to
go into recovery for a while.

301
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:56,017
That's great.

302
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,201
No, I...

303
00:19:57,235 --> 00:19:59,476
I didn't mean that.
I meant...

304
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:01,389
Well, that would
make a great book.

305
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,010
Well,
there isn't really that much.

306
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:08,057
That I can remember
about the whole thing,

307
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,427
But who knows?

308
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,476
Tomorrow is another day.

309
00:20:12,508 --> 00:20:13,917
Yeah.

310
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,254
And this has been a long one.

311
00:20:16,288 --> 00:20:18,208
Now, where do I sleep?

312
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:19,232
Come on.

313
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,218
I'll show you to your room.

314
00:20:24,037 --> 00:20:25,285
I hope you're warm enough.

315
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:27,382
It does get cold here at night.

316
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:30,841
I put an extra blanket
on the end of your bed.

317
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,564
Oh, I used to stay in a house
the same as this.

318
00:20:33,596 --> 00:20:35,517
Creaking floors,

319
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:36,926
Plumbing, always cold at night,

320
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,687
Even in the naves.

321
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:45,379
Oh, I'm just in here.

322
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,157
You know, you're prettier
than your picture.

323
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,111
Oh, thank you.

324
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,139
Should we
make a start first thing?

325
00:20:51,257 --> 00:20:52,232
Mm, bright and early.

326
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:53,721
Morning's
my favorite time of day.

327
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,114
I never miss it.

328
00:20:55,147 --> 00:20:56,844
Oh, we'll get on
just fine then.

329
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:59,469
Um, you're in here.
Hope that's okay.

330
00:20:59,503 --> 00:21:01,038
It's perfect.

331
00:21:01,072 --> 00:21:02,287
Night, then.

332
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:03,408
Night.

333
00:21:11,158 --> 00:21:12,374
Sleep tight.

334
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:13,319
Night.

335
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,892
Paula?

336
00:22:52,926 --> 00:22:54,094
Paula.

337
00:22:55,311 --> 00:22:56,655
It's okay.
It's okay.

338
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:58,865
It's just a dream.

339
00:22:58,898 --> 00:22:59,954
It's just a nightmare.

340
00:23:02,644 --> 00:23:05,269
It's okay.

341
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:06,550
It's just a dream.

342
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:14,859
How are you this morning?

343
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:17,917
Oh, fine.

344
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:20,928
- You sure?
- Yeah.

345
00:23:20,961 --> 00:23:23,762
I'm sorry if I frightened you
last night.

346
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:25,475
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm all right.

347
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:27,685
It was you I was worried about.

348
00:23:27,718 --> 00:23:29,430
I'm just a bit stretched
at the moment,

349
00:23:29,462 --> 00:23:31,479
What with one thing
and another.

350
00:23:32,521 --> 00:23:34,713
Can I give you some advice?

351
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,955
Everyone else does.

352
00:23:36,988 --> 00:23:38,172
I'm sorry.

353
00:23:38,204 --> 00:23:41,263
I didn't mean that.

354
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,383
Go on.

355
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:47,075
Well, sometimes you're
better off dealing with things.

356
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:49,636
Than leaving it till tomorrow
to sort out.

357
00:23:52,535 --> 00:23:53,879
Should we have a go
at doing some work today?

358
00:23:53,912 --> 00:23:55,601
I thought we could
make a start on something.

359
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:57,145
If you're up for that.

360
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:59,059
I suppose
we got to start sometime.

361
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:03,133
Well, I'll tell you what.

362
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:04,350
If you could
harness those dreams.

363
00:24:04,384 --> 00:24:05,888
You were having last night,

364
00:24:05,921 --> 00:24:08,033
You've got yourself
your second best seller.

365
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:09,282
Straight to number one.

366
00:24:10,484 --> 00:24:11,908
Selling books.

367
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,797
It's all that anyone's
interested in.

368
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,832
It's as if it's the most
important thing on the planet.

369
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:20,265
My agent, Sara...

370
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:21,483
She talks about
a number one book.

371
00:24:21,516 --> 00:24:23,180
As though it's the holy grail.

372
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,493
She's obsessed.

373
00:24:26,415 --> 00:24:27,502
Hmm.

374
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,571
Sounds like someone's mistaken
their agent for their friend.

375
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:35,781
Of course she wants
a best seller.

376
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:37,848
Anyway, she's probably
a frustrated writer.

377
00:24:37,863 --> 00:24:39,014
They're all the same.

378
00:24:39,048 --> 00:24:40,468
Always ready
to tell you how to do it.

379
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:42,345
But can't do it themselves.

380
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:43,754
Yeah.

381
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:46,412
Look, should we finish in here
and make a start?

382
00:24:46,445 --> 00:24:48,237
I did have some stuff.

383
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,390
I was just getting it down.

384
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:52,336
When it got swallowed up
in the computer.

385
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:55,186
Okay, well, let's see
if any of that comes back.

386
00:24:55,218 --> 00:24:57,588
I'll set up in the study
if that's all right with you.

387
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,549
Yeah, sure.

388
00:24:58,582 --> 00:24:59,669
Okay.

389
00:25:12,286 --> 00:25:14,031
Love.

390
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:16,593
What is love?

391
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:18,978
Is love an emotion,

392
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:22,725
A feeling,
or just a state of mind?

393
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:26,791
Is it a way of life
for some people?

394
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,900
Just a dream for others?

395
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:30,570
An unreachable dream.

396
00:25:30,603 --> 00:25:32,396
It was unclear to me,

397
00:25:32,428 --> 00:25:34,317
But I knew
that I felt something...

398
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,655
Something that
made me feel uneasy;

399
00:25:36,687 --> 00:25:40,017
Something I couldn't
quite relate to.

400
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,938
Up until now,

401
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:44,884
Everything that made me laugh,

402
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:46,934
Cry, even lose my temper,

403
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:49,223
Had been my personal secret.

404
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,186
This was first time
that I'd ever allowed...

405
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,604
This was the first time
I'd ever considered.

406
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:58,190
Allowing to really
get to know me properly.

407
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:01,296
I'd never allowed anyone
to get this close before...

408
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:04,083
To explore my mind,

409
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:07,189
Body, and soul...

410
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:10,038
But the more secure I became,

411
00:26:10,072 --> 00:26:12,215
The more my insecurities.

412
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:14,041
Found a way through.

413
00:26:18,061 --> 00:26:19,693
"The more secure I became,

414
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:21,800
The more my insecurities
found a way through."

415
00:26:21,808 --> 00:26:22,736
Yeah, I know what I wrote!

416
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:24,512
And it is rubbish!

417
00:26:24,546 --> 00:26:27,139
Ah, it's like those crap novels.

418
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:29,860
You find in the Oxfam shop!

419
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,253
The dog-eared, yellow ones.

420
00:26:31,286 --> 00:26:34,104
That stink of old women.

421
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:36,793
You might as well
just pack up and go.

422
00:26:36,826 --> 00:26:39,162
I can't do this!

423
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:54,902
Oh, for Christ's sake,
what's wrong with me?

424
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,642
Hello?
Hello?

425
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:51,773
Wait!

426
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:54,751
Wait!

427
00:28:17,056 --> 00:28:19,649
Hello?

428
00:28:19,682 --> 00:28:21,282
Who's there?

429
00:29:16,344 --> 00:29:18,186
Like I said,

430
00:29:18,219 --> 00:29:20,523
Thanks again
for seeing me so quickly.

431
00:29:20,556 --> 00:29:22,130
Not at all.
Please.

432
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:28,561
So how can I help you,
Mr. Gainer?

433
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:30,179
Please call me Robert.

434
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:31,891
Robert.

435
00:29:31,924 --> 00:29:34,358
It's about one of your clients.

436
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,575
Paula Martin.

437
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:37,719
- Paula?
- Yes, the author.

438
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:39,481
Yeah, I know who she is.

439
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:40,457
She's not just a client.

440
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,739
She's a very good
friend of mine.

441
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:43,515
What is it, exactly,
that you do?

442
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:45,245
Well,
I'll be straight with you.

443
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:47,038
I'm a journalist,

444
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:49,087
And I work for a magazine,

445
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,505
<i>The Book Review,</i>

446
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,083
And, well,

447
00:29:54,116 --> 00:29:55,683
I'd like a little bit
of information.

448
00:29:55,717 --> 00:29:57,508
She's doing her second book,

449
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,270
And we would like
to help her publicize.

450
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:00,647
Get behind her on this.

451
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,312
You know that it's
really tough out there.

452
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:03,593
For writers these days,

453
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,964
And they can do
with all the help they can get.

454
00:30:05,997 --> 00:30:08,477
I can't discuss
clients or friends.

455
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,238
With anyone from a magazine.

456
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:12,736
I'm sure you already know that.

457
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,096
I'm sorry, Mr. Gainer.

458
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,459
You've wasted your time.

459
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:17,523
Personally speaking,
I think it was a bit harsh,

460
00:30:17,556 --> 00:30:18,484
What they did to you.

461
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,085
I mean, after all,

462
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:22,359
You were just looking out
for your client, weren't you?

463
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:25,417
Woman had a bad reaction
to a simple antidepressant.

464
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,779
Clashed with another medication
which I knew nothing about.

465
00:30:28,812 --> 00:30:30,381
I didn't see it

466
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:33,102
'cause she didn't
put it on the form.

467
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:36,001
You know,
in situations like this,

468
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,763
I usually find
that a small fee helps.

469
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,909
I've got 1,000 pounds here.

470
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:44,647
I know you could do with it.

471
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,087
Just tell me
where she's staying.

472
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:47,720
It's yours.

473
00:30:47,753 --> 00:30:48,745
Simple as that.

474
00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:27,146
What on earth
do you think you're doing?

475
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,779
Nothing.

476
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:30,654
I just thought I'd help
tidy it up a bit for you.

477
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,918
Tidy it up?

478
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,679
You saying there was
something wrong with it?

479
00:32:33,712 --> 00:32:34,992
No, I didn't say it.

480
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:36,529
You said it.

481
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:37,553
You said it yesterday.

482
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:38,898
You said it was rubbish.

483
00:32:38,931 --> 00:32:40,429
You said it was like
one of those books.

484
00:32:40,436 --> 00:32:41,684
You find in Oxfam
that nobody wants,

485
00:32:41,717 --> 00:32:42,740
Not me.

486
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:44,054
I just thought I'd help you out.

487
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,911
Yeah, well, don't.

488
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:47,993
If I'd wanted to hire somebody
to write my own book for me,

489
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:49,369
Then I would have done it!

490
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:50,330
Oh, my God!

491
00:32:50,363 --> 00:32:53,116
This has been a bloody joke!

492
00:32:53,149 --> 00:32:55,742
How dare you!

493
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:57,888
You're my P.A.,

494
00:32:57,921 --> 00:32:59,040
Not a bloody ghostwriter!

495
00:32:59,073 --> 00:33:00,738
Do you understand?

496
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:05,189
I mean, look at it!

497
00:33:05,222 --> 00:33:08,327
There's bloody pages of it.

498
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,856
You never, ever do this again!

499
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,817
Never!

500
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,131
Is that clear?

501
00:33:13,163 --> 00:33:14,923
Perfectly.

502
00:33:14,957 --> 00:33:17,678
Perfectly clear.

503
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:18,798
I'll leave it to you.

504
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:10,641
Hi.

505
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:12,594
You okay?

506
00:37:13,972 --> 00:37:16,021
Yeah, I think so.

507
00:37:16,053 --> 00:37:17,317
What is it?

508
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,437
Bad dreams?

509
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:21,271
No.

510
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,833
It's just me being stupid.

511
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,562
Must have fallen asleep
in the bath.

512
00:37:25,595 --> 00:37:26,844
And freaked myself out.

513
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:27,805
Come in.
Come in.

514
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:28,926
Sit down.

515
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:39,396
It was just really weird.

516
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,343
I thought that...

517
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:45,320
Look,

518
00:37:45,353 --> 00:37:47,234
Do you want to stay
in here tonight?

519
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,461
Oh, could I?

520
00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:52,093
Would you mind?

521
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:53,407
Come on.

522
00:38:02,054 --> 00:38:03,652
You just need to get some sleep.

523
00:38:03,686 --> 00:38:05,350
You're getting yourself
all stressed out.

524
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,016
It won't do you any favors.

525
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:08,168
Positive mental energy.

526
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,385
That's what you need.

527
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:10,795
Brings good things to you:

528
00:38:10,828 --> 00:38:11,979
Good health, good thoughts,

529
00:38:12,012 --> 00:38:14,028
And more importantly,
good ideas.

530
00:38:14,062 --> 00:38:15,406
If you can do that,

531
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:17,456
The book will
take care of itself.

532
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:18,864
Trust me.

533
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,625
You know I'm right?

534
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:21,746
Yeah, I do.

535
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:31,320
Thank you.

536
00:38:31,354 --> 00:38:32,794
Don't worry about it.

537
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:35,004
You just need
a good night's sleep.

538
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:37,917
I mean for the words.

539
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,864
Just read it.

540
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,937
It's fantastic.

541
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,283
It's...

542
00:38:45,316 --> 00:38:46,628
It's so much darker,

543
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:51,047
But it's everything
that I wanted to write.

544
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,359
It's everything
that was in my head.

545
00:38:52,393 --> 00:38:54,056
But I couldn't get it out.

546
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:58,988
Why don't you
stay in bed tomorrow?

547
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:00,750
Take it easy for the day.

548
00:39:00,783 --> 00:39:03,087
Let me do the worrying for you.

549
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,976
That's why I'm here.

550
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,322
Take the pressure off.

551
00:39:06,355 --> 00:39:09,204
Yeah, that would be nice.

552
00:39:09,237 --> 00:39:10,516
Try and get some sleep.

553
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:56,399
What the hell
is going on down there?

554
00:40:56,432 --> 00:40:57,790
I can't hear myself think,

555
00:40:57,824 --> 00:40:59,376
Let alone work!

556
00:40:59,408 --> 00:41:01,313
I didn't know
Mrs. Brown was coming in today.

557
00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:02,786
It's not just that woman.

558
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,517
It's the fucking gardener
as well!

559
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:05,958
What on earth do they think
they're up to?

560
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,590
I was on a roll down there,

561
00:41:07,623 --> 00:41:09,576
And if you could still remember
what that feels like,

562
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:11,945
Then you'd be kind enough
to sort it out.

563
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:14,075
Sort it out?
What can I say?

564
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:15,804
I don't care
what you fucking say.

565
00:41:15,837 --> 00:41:17,277
Just get rid of them.

566
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,934
Get them the fuck
out of this house!

567
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:21,183
It's either me or them...

568
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,820
And without me,
we're both fucked.

569
00:41:58,043 --> 00:41:58,970
Did they go?

570
00:41:58,972 --> 00:42:00,667
Oh, uh, yes,

571
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,588
But I told them
they could come back tomorrow.

572
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:05,054
Said what?

573
00:42:05,086 --> 00:42:08,160
That they could
come back tomorrow.

574
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:11,330
Well, don't expect any work
to happen tomorrow.

575
00:42:11,364 --> 00:42:13,398
And I'll have some coffee
when you're ready.

576
00:42:28,527 --> 00:42:30,096
Sara.

577
00:42:30,128 --> 00:42:32,144
Hello.

578
00:42:32,178 --> 00:42:33,170
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

579
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:34,835
I'm feeling fine.

580
00:42:34,867 --> 00:42:37,044
Yeah, things are really
starting to happen.

581
00:42:37,077 --> 00:42:38,934
I've hit a good vein.

582
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,891
Yep.

583
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:45,915
Yeah, yeah.

584
00:42:45,948 --> 00:42:47,611
I'd like to get on, though.

585
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:48,861
All right...

586
00:42:48,894 --> 00:42:50,559
Thanks for calling.

587
00:42:50,591 --> 00:42:51,679
Bye.

588
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:31,825
Paula!

589
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:39,847
Paula!

590
00:44:47,053 --> 00:44:48,173
Oh.

591
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:49,261
Paula Martin?

592
00:44:49,294 --> 00:44:50,863
Yes.

593
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,031
The author?

594
00:44:52,144 --> 00:44:53,104
Yes.

595
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:53,936
Can I help you?

596
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:56,498
I'm rather busy.

597
00:44:56,531 --> 00:44:57,891
I I'm sorry.

598
00:44:57,925 --> 00:44:59,813
I didn't recognize you
straight off.

599
00:44:59,846 --> 00:45:01,382
You look kind of...

600
00:45:01,415 --> 00:45:02,647
What?

601
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:04,680
Well, different
to your picture...

602
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:08,075
But in a better sort of way,

603
00:45:08,107 --> 00:45:09,548
If you don't mind me saying so.

604
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,478
Well, a little bit of makeup
does wonders to you.

605
00:45:14,047 --> 00:45:15,808
Hey, uh, nice house.

606
00:45:15,841 --> 00:45:16,865
Is it yours?

607
00:45:16,898 --> 00:45:18,049
Mm.

608
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,619
Yes.

609
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:20,739
Um, what is it you want?

610
00:45:21,909 --> 00:45:23,846
I'm Robert Gainer.

611
00:45:23,878 --> 00:45:24,870
You might have heard of me.

612
00:45:24,903 --> 00:45:27,336
I'm a writer.

613
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,649
I'm not in your category,

614
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:30,762
But I work for a magazine.

615
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:32,604
The Book?

616
00:45:32,637 --> 00:45:35,326
I thought you could
fill me in on a few blanks.

617
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,407
We could have a talk.

618
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,479
Talk...

619
00:45:38,512 --> 00:45:40,080
Of course.

620
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:41,394
Of course.
Why don't you come in?

621
00:45:41,427 --> 00:45:42,866
Join me for a glass of wine.

622
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,499
I think it's that time of day.

623
00:45:44,532 --> 00:45:46,421
Oh, and I think there's
some cheese and biscuits.

624
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:47,734
In the kitchen.

625
00:45:47,766 --> 00:45:48,983
All right. Thanks.
That sounds great.

626
00:45:49,016 --> 00:45:50,455
Thank you very much.

627
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:02,881
You know,

628
00:46:02,914 --> 00:46:03,953
If I'd known.

629
00:46:03,986 --> 00:46:05,062
That getting to talk to you.

630
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:07,235
Was gonna be this pleasant,

631
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:09,226
Would have caused me
a lot less stress.

632
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:13,481
Well, stress is the one thing

633
00:46:13,514 --> 00:46:14,857
I don't believe in.

634
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:17,803
Anything to relieve stress
is good in my book.

635
00:46:17,836 --> 00:46:19,116
What do you think, Robert?

636
00:46:20,207 --> 00:46:23,295
Hmm, yeah.

637
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:25,922
So Paula,

638
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:27,329
How's the book coming along?

639
00:46:27,363 --> 00:46:28,771
Fine.

640
00:46:28,804 --> 00:46:30,084
Why wouldn't it be?

641
00:46:30,214 --> 00:46:33,638
Well, I don't have to tell you.

642
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:36,841
That there were some rumors
floating around out there.

643
00:46:36,874 --> 00:46:39,242
About how you, uh...

644
00:46:39,275 --> 00:46:40,298
Running into difficulties.

645
00:46:40,332 --> 00:46:41,560
Had a little bit of a breakdown.

646
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:44,078
So much so that you, um,

647
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:47,087
Employed the services
of a ghostwriter.

648
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,089
Now, I don't
believe a word of that.

649
00:46:51,107 --> 00:46:54,293
I know you're too much of a pro.

650
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:56,103
But you wouldn't mind too much.

651
00:46:56,135 --> 00:46:58,215
If we talked a little bit.

652
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:01,066
About the "breakdown,"
would you?

653
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:03,018
Look, I know
it's a sensitive subject,

654
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:04,812
But sometimes
it's good to talk...

655
00:47:04,846 --> 00:47:07,598
Get it out there in the open,

656
00:47:07,632 --> 00:47:09,776
And, well,

657
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:13,618
Show the public
the real Paula Martin.

658
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:14,979
And you know something?

659
00:47:15,092 --> 00:47:17,076
I've got a sneaking suspicion.

660
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:20,039
That it won't harm the sales
of your new book either.

661
00:47:20,072 --> 00:47:21,079
I see.

662
00:47:23,722 --> 00:47:25,387
Let me get you some more wine.

663
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:26,860
Thank you.

664
00:47:26,893 --> 00:47:28,589
So when did it all start?

665
00:47:28,623 --> 00:47:32,303
I mean, was it the, uh...

666
00:47:33,522 --> 00:47:35,057
Pressures of writing?

667
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:37,427
Everyday life?

668
00:47:37,461 --> 00:47:39,364
I mean, look, there's
no embarrassment in it either.

669
00:47:39,397 --> 00:47:40,516
You know that.

670
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:41,861
It's all too common out there.

671
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:43,398
Oh, no, you've got me wrong.

672
00:47:43,432 --> 00:47:44,856
I've no embarrassment.

673
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,586
I'm happy to tell you
what happened.

674
00:47:46,618 --> 00:47:47,962
- Oh, you are?
- Mm.

675
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:50,732
Where do I start?

676
00:47:50,765 --> 00:47:51,885
Would you mind very much.

677
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:55,440
If I recorded this?

678
00:47:56,865 --> 00:48:00,195
You see, I don't want
to misquote you, Paula,

679
00:48:00,228 --> 00:48:03,781
And I really would like
to get it all down.

680
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,766
Entirely in your own words.

681
00:48:08,025 --> 00:48:09,913
There you go.

682
00:48:09,946 --> 00:48:12,203
Let's go.
We're ready.

683
00:48:12,235 --> 00:48:13,516
So...

684
00:48:16,912 --> 00:48:18,769
You want everything?

685
00:48:18,801 --> 00:48:20,338
Yeah, everything.

686
00:48:23,091 --> 00:48:24,644
My brother
was fucking my brains out.

687
00:48:24,676 --> 00:48:26,277
From the age of 13,

688
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,157
So I killed him!

689
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:28,262
I ripped his fucking spleen out.

690
00:48:28,295 --> 00:48:30,039
While he was on top of me.

691
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:56,874
Now you know everything.

692
00:49:10,644 --> 00:49:13,045
Thought you might like
some cheese and biscuits.

693
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:16,055
Oh, thank you.

694
00:49:16,088 --> 00:49:17,497
And how are you feeling?
Any better?

695
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,226
Yeah, a lot better.
Thank you.

696
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:21,448
Yeah, I think I'll get up
tomorrow and do some work.

697
00:49:21,453 --> 00:49:23,149
- Do you, now?
- Yeah, you were right.

698
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:25,183
A day in bed has done me
a barrel of good.

699
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:27,648
I'll be the judge of that.

700
00:49:27,938 --> 00:49:30,738
There's nothing
for you to worry about.

701
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:32,767
That reporter
that came this afternoon...

702
00:49:32,789 --> 00:49:34,772
It was Robert Gainer,
wasn't it?

703
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:36,150
What did he want?

704
00:49:36,183 --> 00:49:37,366
Oh, he just wanted
a quick chat...

705
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,551
A few words for the magazine.

706
00:49:39,882 --> 00:49:41,945
Don't worry.
I was very polite.

707
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,227
I gave him a drink,
something to eat,

708
00:49:43,259 --> 00:49:44,443
And told him
you couldn't see him.

709
00:49:44,477 --> 00:49:46,044
Because you didn't want
to be disturbed.

710
00:49:46,078 --> 00:49:47,710
You were too busy
hitting that deadline.

711
00:49:47,743 --> 00:49:49,456
Oh, thank you.

712
00:49:50,705 --> 00:49:53,538
Do you think
he'll be coming back?

713
00:49:53,572 --> 00:49:55,428
Like I said,

714
00:49:55,461 --> 00:49:57,379
There's nothing
for you to worry about.

715
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:36,545
Are you comfortable?

716
00:50:36,577 --> 00:50:37,921
Yeah, thank you.

717
00:50:37,954 --> 00:50:39,073
Good.

718
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:40,387
Just for the record,

719
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,789
This is the 4th
of February, 1997.

720
00:50:42,821 --> 00:50:45,527
Now, after "three,"

721
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,281
I want you to take
a deep breath in.

722
00:50:48,314 --> 00:50:51,226
And breathe out slowly, okay?

723
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,308
One...

724
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:55,854
Two...

725
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:56,974
Three.

726
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:01,825
Paula,

727
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,859
Tell me about your childhood.

728
00:51:05,798 --> 00:51:07,641
Tell me about
your summer holidays.

729
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:09,847
They were hot.

730
00:51:09,881 --> 00:51:11,113
So hot...

731
00:51:11,146 --> 00:51:13,658
Sometimes I could
hardly breathe,

732
00:51:13,691 --> 00:51:16,268
As if there wasn't enough air.

733
00:51:17,886 --> 00:51:19,076
I know how stupid that sounds.

734
00:51:21,937 --> 00:51:23,024
Were you alone there?

735
00:51:35,851 --> 00:51:37,514
Hate.

736
00:51:37,548 --> 00:51:38,668
What is hate?

737
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:42,542
An emotion that eats away
at your soul.

738
00:51:42,576 --> 00:51:45,296
Until there's nothing left.

739
00:51:45,329 --> 00:51:47,858
Burns a hole in your heart.

740
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:50,067
That seeps poison
into your veins.

741
00:51:51,702 --> 00:51:54,871
Self-loathing
is the most painful addiction...

742
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,361
Disrespect for all that we are.

743
00:51:58,394 --> 00:51:59,482
Who am I?

744
00:52:02,397 --> 00:52:06,175
A soul waiting to escape
the confines of her cell.

745
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:09,217
Waiting to be set free
from this world of torment...

746
00:52:11,427 --> 00:52:13,219
Until this world drips...

747
00:52:14,726 --> 00:52:16,005
Of blood.

748
00:52:25,165 --> 00:52:27,054
Paula, what on earth
has happened?

749
00:52:29,616 --> 00:52:31,344
Oh, my poor thing.

750
00:52:33,075 --> 00:52:34,835
Come on.

751
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:35,956
Sit down.

752
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:44,793
Let me sort this out for you.

753
00:52:49,342 --> 00:52:50,750
I was just making
some breakfast.

754
00:52:50,782 --> 00:52:52,095
I thought you'd be hungry.

755
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:53,356
You hardly ate yesterday at all.

756
00:52:57,796 --> 00:52:59,715
Now, then,
let's have a look at this.

757
00:53:03,303 --> 00:53:06,569
You see, you have to be
very careful with open wounds.

758
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:10,290
They get very messy
if you don't look after them.

759
00:53:13,167 --> 00:53:16,944
Now, you need
to take better care of this.

760
00:53:18,354 --> 00:53:19,922
And if it starts
to give you any trouble,

761
00:53:19,956 --> 00:53:22,996
You just let me know, okay?

762
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,127
What is it?

763
00:53:29,658 --> 00:53:30,746
Well?

764
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:34,365
The book.

765
00:53:34,398 --> 00:53:35,678
The book.

766
00:53:35,711 --> 00:53:37,535
Don't you worry yourself
about the book.

767
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:39,680
I told you,
I'm taking care of everything.

768
00:53:52,586 --> 00:53:53,674
Look at you.

769
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,388
Just leave the mess to me.

770
00:54:01,456 --> 00:54:02,544
It's Mrs. Brown.

771
00:54:04,626 --> 00:54:05,740
I'll talk to her this time.

772
00:54:24,448 --> 00:54:25,536
Where's that bloody mop?

773
00:55:25,419 --> 00:55:26,699
Mrs. Brown.

774
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,715
Hello?

775
00:55:37,747 --> 00:55:38,867
Leo.

776
00:55:39,894 --> 00:55:41,397
How you doing?

777
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:42,646
Well, yeah,

778
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,631
It has been a while,
to say the least.

779
00:55:44,664 --> 00:55:45,944
What can I do for you?

780
00:55:49,821 --> 00:55:50,941
Listen, Leo,

781
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:53,918
Why don't I come and see you?

782
00:55:53,952 --> 00:55:55,231
Get me out of the office
for a while.

783
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:57,856
Make this conversation
a bit more private.

784
00:55:57,889 --> 00:55:59,394
It'll be nice to see you anyway.

785
00:56:06,503 --> 00:56:07,495
Mrs. Brown?

786
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,897
Did you say
you wanted Mrs. Brown?

787
00:56:20,930 --> 00:56:22,001
That's what I said.

788
00:56:22,034 --> 00:56:24,035
Look, I don't know
if you heard me or not,

789
00:56:24,068 --> 00:56:26,469
But I've got to go, and she's
supposed to come with me.

790
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:28,691
Oh, Mrs. Brown...
she's just down in the basement.

791
00:56:31,129 --> 00:56:32,521
Well, can you tell her
I'm waiting for her?

792
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,186
I've just
got to get off sharpish.

793
00:56:34,219 --> 00:56:36,062
Why don't you
tell her yourself?

794
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:39,694
What, down the basement?

795
00:56:39,727 --> 00:56:40,751
Yeah, yeah,

796
00:56:40,784 --> 00:56:42,560
She's down there somewhere.

797
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,712
Mrs. Brown?

798
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,282
Mrs. Brown, are you down there?

799
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:04,000
Well, when you see her,

800
00:57:04,033 --> 00:57:05,391
Can you tell her I'm leaving.

801
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:07,459
And she'll have to get
a taxi home tonight?

802
00:57:20,299 --> 00:57:23,164
Stupid fucking bitch.

803
00:57:36,438 --> 00:57:37,606
Ahh!

804
00:57:45,085 --> 00:57:47,645
You stupid fucking bitch!

805
00:57:47,678 --> 00:57:49,055
What do you want this time, huh?

806
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:50,479
Never know how well off you are,

807
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:52,176
Even when someone's
trying to help you!

808
00:57:52,209 --> 00:57:53,682
Go away.

809
00:57:53,715 --> 00:57:55,186
Oh, please leave me alone,
for God's sake!

810
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,011
Leave me alone!

811
00:57:58,647 --> 00:58:00,438
Where's Mrs. Brown?

812
00:58:00,472 --> 00:58:01,944
She's in the cellar,

813
00:58:01,976 --> 00:58:04,409
You fucking whore!

814
00:58:39,902 --> 00:58:41,535
Can't take your call right now,

815
00:58:41,568 --> 00:58:43,648
So please leave a message.

816
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:47,523
Leo.
Leo!

817
00:58:47,557 --> 00:58:49,412
It's me.

818
00:58:49,445 --> 00:58:52,198
Oh, help me.

819
00:58:52,231 --> 00:58:54,024
She's trying to kill me!

820
00:58:55,017 --> 00:58:56,821
The girl that Sara hired.
She's...

821
00:58:59,678 --> 00:59:01,886
You really didn't
need to do that.

822
00:59:01,919 --> 00:59:02,846
Thanks very much.

823
00:59:02,879 --> 00:59:04,223
It's been a long time.

824
00:59:04,256 --> 00:59:05,696
Since a woman's
bought me dinner,

825
00:59:05,729 --> 00:59:07,611
Especially one
as beautiful as you.

826
00:59:08,771 --> 00:59:10,180
Listen, don't ruin it.

827
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:13,862
But it was lovely.

828
00:59:29,698 --> 00:59:31,387
- Do you mind if I...
- No.

829
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,928
Well, cheers.

830
00:59:42,972 --> 00:59:45,917
You miss Paula, don't you?

831
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,158
Yeah, of course I do.

832
00:59:48,191 --> 00:59:50,655
She was...
she <i>is...</i>

833
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:52,320
Still a major part of my life.

834
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:56,099
But our relationship
was never physical.

835
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:57,316
We...

836
00:59:57,349 --> 00:59:59,398
We didn't want that.

837
00:59:59,431 --> 01:00:02,824
Of course,
after the breakdown, well...

838
01:00:03,993 --> 01:00:07,212
So what was it
you wanted to show me?

839
01:00:20,646 --> 01:00:22,998
Fucking bastard, you've been
treating me like a fool.

840
01:00:23,031 --> 01:00:24,983
I should tear
your fucking heart out.

841
01:00:25,016 --> 01:00:26,521
And ride the fucker out.

842
01:00:26,553 --> 01:00:27,850
You're the fucking
devil himself,

843
01:00:27,883 --> 01:00:30,156
You fucking bastard!

844
01:00:36,752 --> 01:00:37,841
Who was that?

845
01:00:43,429 --> 01:00:44,518
Mrs. Brown?

846
01:00:47,721 --> 01:00:49,001
Mrs. Brown.

847
01:01:21,152 --> 01:01:23,937
Help me.

848
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:25,185
Help me.

849
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:26,947
Paula, please.

850
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:29,317
Leo.

851
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:32,679
It's the P.A.

852
01:01:32,712 --> 01:01:34,633
- She's after me.
- Calm down.

853
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:36,633
Paula.

854
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:37,594
Who is she?

855
01:01:37,627 --> 01:01:39,484
A woman called Linda.

856
01:01:39,518 --> 01:01:41,117
I don't know her second name.

857
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,889
She's already killed two people.

858
01:01:45,921 --> 01:01:46,817
Calm down.

859
01:01:48,835 --> 01:01:51,044
Voice on the tape.
It's a woman called Linda.

860
01:01:51,077 --> 01:01:53,766
She's been stalking Paula
since she was a little girl.

861
01:01:53,799 --> 01:01:55,943
She's back.

862
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:50,638
Thought I heard you down there.

863
01:02:57,026 --> 01:02:58,787
Come on!
Fuck you!

864
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:00,708
Go on!

865
01:04:27,186 --> 01:04:28,947
My brother was
fucking my brains out.

866
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:32,148
From the age of 13,
so I killed him!

867
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:34,294
I ripped out his fucking spleen.

868
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:36,135
While he was on top of me!

869
01:04:39,947 --> 01:04:42,059
Fucking my brains out
from the age of 13,

870
01:04:42,093 --> 01:04:43,789
So I killed him!

871
01:04:43,821 --> 01:04:45,919
I ripped out his fucking spleen.

872
01:04:45,951 --> 01:04:47,200
While he was on top of...

873
01:04:49,491 --> 01:04:51,763
Fucking my brains out
from the age of 13,

874
01:04:51,796 --> 01:04:53,587
So I killed him!

875
01:04:53,621 --> 01:04:55,957
I ripped out his fucking spleen.

876
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:57,350
While he was on top of me.

877
01:04:58,985 --> 01:05:00,041
Fucking my brains out...

878
01:05:11,729 --> 01:05:14,130
You're telling me
that this Linda.

879
01:05:14,162 --> 01:05:17,333
And Paula are the same person.

880
01:05:17,365 --> 01:05:18,676
How?

881
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:21,847
Dissociative identity disorder.

882
01:05:21,881 --> 01:05:24,057
She's been coming to see me
for nearly ten years.

883
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,755
Some days were good,

884
01:05:25,787 --> 01:05:27,580
And that's when Paula
would come through the door.

885
01:05:27,612 --> 01:05:28,637
Other days were bad.

886
01:05:28,669 --> 01:05:30,973
That's when Linda would show up.

887
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:33,696
That's the voice
you heard on the tape.

888
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:34,766
What are you talking about?

889
01:05:34,785 --> 01:05:36,194
Paula and her brother.

890
01:05:36,227 --> 01:05:38,147
Spent all of their
holidays here.

891
01:05:38,179 --> 01:05:40,356
He began to rape her
at a young age.

892
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:42,117
The older she got,
the more she blocked it out,

893
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:43,271
Till in the end,

894
01:05:43,304 --> 01:05:44,936
She created a separate person:

895
01:05:44,969 --> 01:05:46,056
Linda.

896
01:05:49,099 --> 01:05:50,347
She has absolutely
no recollection.

897
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:51,693
Of her brother at all.

898
01:05:51,725 --> 01:05:53,133
With a split personality.

899
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,799
That could cope with the trauma.

900
01:05:54,832 --> 01:05:57,713
Whenever Paula's under stress,
Linda shows up.

901
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:00,243
That's right.

902
01:06:00,275 --> 01:06:02,195
Paula stabbed her brother
when he was raping her.

903
01:06:02,229 --> 01:06:03,636
Tipped her over the edge.

904
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:05,975
She was put under
my supervision.

905
01:06:06,008 --> 01:06:08,184
Oh, my God,
I sent Robert Gainer down there.

906
01:06:08,216 --> 01:06:09,913
You sent the reporter
to the house?

907
01:06:09,946 --> 01:06:11,386
We thought it would help
with publicity.

908
01:06:11,419 --> 01:06:12,923
Aw, Christ.

909
01:06:22,899 --> 01:06:24,339
What are you doing?

910
01:06:27,606 --> 01:06:29,270
You wanted to come.

911
01:06:36,536 --> 01:06:37,352
Linda?

912
01:06:37,385 --> 01:06:39,146
Where are you?

913
01:06:39,179 --> 01:06:40,266
I know you're here.

914
01:06:42,061 --> 01:06:45,070
Christ, what's that smell?

915
01:06:45,102 --> 01:06:47,055
Linda!

916
01:06:47,088 --> 01:06:49,136
Paula?

917
01:06:49,169 --> 01:06:51,315
Linda, it's Leo.

918
01:06:54,741 --> 01:06:56,951
All right, you stay here.

919
01:06:56,984 --> 01:06:59,352
Really?

920
01:06:59,384 --> 01:07:01,178
Linda, don't worry.

921
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:02,586
Just want to talk to you.

922
01:07:22,489 --> 01:07:23,576
Linda?

923
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:53,380
Paula, is that you?

924
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,161
It's all right.

925
01:08:09,194 --> 01:08:11,050
I told you I'd come.

926
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:12,715
Hey.
Hey.

927
01:08:12,748 --> 01:08:14,413
I told you I'd come for you.

928
01:08:14,446 --> 01:08:15,533
You're safe now.

929
01:08:20,065 --> 01:08:21,216
This is brilliant.

930
01:08:26,341 --> 01:08:29,159
Absolutely bloody brilliant.

931
01:08:31,657 --> 01:08:33,674
It's okay.

932
01:08:33,707 --> 01:08:34,794
You're all right.

933
01:08:37,036 --> 01:08:37,965
It's over.

934
01:09:00,957 --> 01:09:02,238
You're right.

935
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,569
It is over.

936
01:09:43,996 --> 01:09:45,083
Leo?

937
01:09:51,777 --> 01:09:53,633
Leo?

938
01:09:57,413 --> 01:09:58,340
Paula?

939
01:10:01,064 --> 01:10:02,152
Linda.

940
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,763
Where do you think
you're going with my work?

941
01:10:08,797 --> 01:10:10,654
Your biography.
It's incredible.

942
01:10:10,686 --> 01:10:11,903
I've never read
anything like it...

943
01:10:11,935 --> 01:10:13,439
Do you really think

944
01:10:13,472 --> 01:10:14,945
I am gonna let you
walk out of here.

945
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:17,409
With all my work?

946
01:10:17,572 --> 01:10:18,466
Where's Leo?

947
01:10:20,725 --> 01:10:22,438
Where is he?

948
01:10:22,471 --> 01:10:24,519
Oh, he's up in the bedroom.

949
01:10:24,552 --> 01:10:27,929
Do you want to see him?

950
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:29,802
Sara.

951
01:10:29,836 --> 01:10:31,323
Get out of here.

952
01:10:31,357 --> 01:10:33,213
Get out of here while you can!

953
01:10:33,246 --> 01:10:34,991
Paula, please!
This isn't you!

954
01:10:35,024 --> 01:10:37,873
Sara, please get out of here.

955
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:40,290
I can't!
Where's Leo?

956
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:42,884
He's dead.

957
01:10:42,918 --> 01:10:45,062
I killed him.

958
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,420
Where the fuck...

959
01:11:15,452 --> 01:11:17,387
Shit.

960
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:18,813
Yeah.

961
01:11:20,703 --> 01:11:21,951
Hey.

962
01:11:21,984 --> 01:11:24,769
Yeah, police.

963
01:11:24,801 --> 01:11:26,530
I'm at Crow's...

964
01:11:26,563 --> 01:11:29,349
Crow's Hall!

965
01:11:29,381 --> 01:11:30,887
I don't know what
the fuck is happening,

966
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:34,184
But you have to get here quick!

967
01:11:34,216 --> 01:11:35,432
What?

968
01:11:35,466 --> 01:11:37,482
Oh, fuck!

969
01:11:37,516 --> 01:11:39,019
Shit.

970
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:57,592
No!

971
01:13:09,771 --> 01:13:10,748
Ahh!

972
01:14:11,336 --> 01:14:12,904
So what was your relationship.

973
01:14:12,937 --> 01:14:14,024
To the party?

974
01:14:18,924 --> 01:14:20,364
What were your reasons.

975
01:14:20,397 --> 01:14:22,317
For coming out here
in the first place?

976
01:14:26,993 --> 01:14:30,772
Miss.

977
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:31,892
Miss, are you okay?

978
01:14:38,234 --> 01:14:40,602
Yeah.

979
01:14:40,635 --> 01:14:43,484
Everything is just.

980
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:44,606
Perfect.
