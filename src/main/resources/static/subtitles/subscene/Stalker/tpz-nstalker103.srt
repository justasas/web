00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:03,661
Carl Kolchak.

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,864
Perri Reed, and this is Jain McManus.

3
00:00:05,939 --> 00:00:08,134
- She's senior crime reporter?
- I've been here 4 years...

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,300
You are expected to get along.

5
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:10,968
This is where Kolchak killed his wife.

6
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,272
That's not his story.

7
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,677
All these strange deaths,
like pieces in a puzzle,

8
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,545
a puzzle I'm trying to put together.

9
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,981
The public has a right to know.

10
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,679
These are things
I need to find out for myself.

11
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:29,886
[Carl] Fear has its own physiology,
primal responses to threat.

12
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,733
The quickened heart,
the sweaty palm,

13
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:49,544
the panic that chokes in the throat,
making time seem to stand still.

14
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,984
We 're born with these instincts

15
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,784
to flee danger
from the world outside us, to survive.

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,303
[? hip hop]

17
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,209
[hel icopter]

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,914
But there 's no place to run
when the dangers come

19
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:26,418
not from outside us, but from...

20
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,976
ourselves.

21
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,316
[man] Hey.

22
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,154
Hey.

23
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,085
[muffled scream]

24
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,026
[hissing]

25
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,837
- Enough!
- What are you doing?

26
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,610
- Let her go.
- We're not finished.

27
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,051
- I said let her go!
- Not yet. She's not ready.

28
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:08,459
Get her.

29
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,514
[creaking]

30
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,015
[water pouring]

31
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,524
Help me! Help me!

32
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:27,004
Help me!

33
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,569
Help me!

34
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,477
[spluttering]

35
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,184
[gasping]

36
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,491
[muffled]

37
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,198
[muffled] Help! Help!

38
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:38,700
Look who's here.

39
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,011
Good morning.

40
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,281
Don't tell me, Carl.

41
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,754
Let me guess why you're here.

42
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,381
Be my guest.

43
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,392
This morning,
a vagrant found the body

44
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,020
of Liza Valenti, age 20,
a UC honors student.

45
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,997
According to the coroner,
she showed signs of drowning.

46
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,433
Ballooned lungs, foam in the airways,
conjunctival hemorrhage...

47
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,903
Only there was no water
found in her lungs.

48
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:10,170
A woman mysteriously drowned,
but not drowned.

49
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,643
- Precisely.
- Ever hear of dry drowning?

50
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,838
What is that?

51
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,973
The larynx involuntarily seals up
to prevent water entering.

52
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,915
It's rare, but it happens.

53
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,148
She could still have drowned,
but have no water in her lungs.

54
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,086
So she did drown.

55
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,522
Not necessarily.

56
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,989
You're going to say that there was
no water in that bathroom.

57
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,464
In fact, no running water
in the entire house.

58
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,627
You'll say the police found a basin
of spilled water next door.

59
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,136
- Only her...
- May I continue?

60
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,604
- Be my guest.
- You'll say they found bruises

61
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,972
on her neck, consistent with
her being held down in that basin.

62
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,103
Her body was discovered in the bathroom,
not in the next room.

63
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,169
[Carl] Doubtless.

64
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,181
She ran there before she succumbed,

65
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,809
fleeing three men
whose shoeprints were found.

66
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,648
Couldn't have said it better myself.

67
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:58,350
So, setting aside why an
honors student would be in this house,

68
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,483
it's a simple case of homicide.

69
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,684
Yes.

70
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,158
Only it isn't.

71
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,529
What is that?

72
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:16,006
Here, here, and here.

73
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:20,808
Someone's taken away the candles,
but there's wax. Black candle wax.

74
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,314
- It's a circle.
- Suggestive of the black arts,

75
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,715
occult rituals. You smell that?

76
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,049
[sniffs] Urine?

77
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,919
Incense. Someone was
burning it here last night.

78
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,821
Is it satanic?

79
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,986
No, not necessarily.
There's thousands of occult sects,

80
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,859
some going back to pagan times.

81
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,058
We don't even know how long
this candle wax has been here.

82
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,661
- It's not brittle.
- There's no electricity in this house.

83
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,228
So burnt candles
don't have to mean occult.

84
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:50,036
- Why are you staring at me?
- I'm staring at the window.

85
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,440
Why?

86
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,910
There's some kind of oil on the glass.

87
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,187
- What is it?
- It's a symbol.

88
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,387
Drawn with anointing oil.
As a part of whatever went on here.

89
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,896
[Carl] Hey, Jain, get a picture.

90
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,631
[phone rings]

91
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,904
- [Perri] Find something?
- [Carl] Yeah, I think so.

92
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:30,645
This.

93
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,048
Three horns.

94
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,316
A horned triskele,
or the horns of death.

95
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,120
Horns of death? For real?

96
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,991
"A powerful occult symbol,
the three horns represents

97
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,520
three realms of existence
and for whoever leads the ceremony,

98
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,830
the ability to raise
supernatural forces from them."

99
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,928
- Aw, man!
- Let me see that.

100
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,839
So, you think that they raised
some kind of supernatural force?

101
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,240
Not so fast.

102
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,271
This book also says the ritual involves
the sacrifice of virgin dwarves.

103
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,317
Did that happen last night as well?

104
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,852
All I'm saying is it has something to do
with what killed her.

105
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,824
Not what, who.

106
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,363
[man] Liza loved learning.

107
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,793
She made even the hardest things seem...

108
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,595
simple.

109
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,668
I'm an English major,

110
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,340
Liza studied astrophysics.

111
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,777
I could never understand
how she wrapped her mind

112
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,513
around all that math.

113
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:48,857
Electromagnetism, quantum mechanics,
atomic and molecular physics...

114
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,590
- You're a reporter?
- Carl Kolchak, with the Beacon.

115
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,063
Oh, thanks.

116
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,828
Devan Harvey, UC Standard.

117
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:58,393
It's the school paper.
It's, uh... you know.

118
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:03,932
...trying to appreciate
every inch of their beauty.

119
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,210
- That made her feel alive.
- [Devan] Let me get you caught up.

120
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,216
That's Jack Mercer.
The dead girl's boyfriend.

121
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,844
- I gathered that.
- Oh, reporter.

122
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
- [Mercer]...and so natural.
- [both] Yeah.

123
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,150
Yeah. I might like a job...
at the Beacon.

124
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,763
- Now?
- No, not now! Come on!

125
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,699
I gotta graduate first.
You know, graduate.

126
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,828
Maybe I'll work at the Beacon,
pay my dues,

127
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,704
and, uh, move on to a better paper,
like the Times.

128
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,470
- Good move.
- Yeah.

129
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,875
[Mercer]...I see how
many lives she touched.

130
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,538
We'll never forget you, Liza.

131
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,718
- It's real touching, isn't it?
- Yeah.

132
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,091
[laughs] Are you kidding?

133
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,493
- No.
- Yeah, it's sad.

134
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,360
[man] Good evening, everybody.

135
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,128
We're all here to honor
the memory of Liza Valenti.

136
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,190
Intellectual...

137
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,260
Hey, you want a tip?

138
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:10,135
Ask Jack about how Liza died.
About how ironic it is.

139
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,201
- What're you talking about?
- Just remember, I want a job!

140
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,771
[man]...accomplishments would
lead most of us to believe

141
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:21,286
- that she was here for a lifetime...
- [Perri] Jack? Jack Mercer?

142
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,413
Hi, I'm Perri Reed
and this is Carl Kolchak.

143
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,583
We're with the Beacon.
We were hoping to ask a few questions.

144
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,217
I don't have anything to say.

145
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,457
We understand that this is
a difficult time for you right now.

146
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,931
You were Liza's boyfriend?
Did you see her the night she died?

147
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,164
No. I was working late
with Professor Carr.

148
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,432
I am so proud to see all of you here...

149
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,940
You don't know what
she was doing around there

150
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,943
or who else might have been with her?

151
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,137
I wish I knew.

152
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,613
I was told I should ask you
about how Liza died.

153
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,110
- The irony of it.
- Who told you that?

154
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,022
She was afraid of drowning.

155
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,117
For her to die that way...

156
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,765
- I have to go...
- Jack, one more thing.

157
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,692
You know what that is?

158
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,528
What's that?

159
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:19,340
It was painted with oil on the window
of the house where Liza died.

160
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,278
Hey. We gotta roll.

161
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,820
- He seemed nervous.
- You think he's involved?

162
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,228
Don't you?

163
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:42,756
Reporters, Jack?
What the hell are you thinking?

164
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,133
It'd be more suspicious
if I didn't talk to them.

165
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:49,197
We're being watched
to see how we deal with the situation.

166
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,970
Situation?

167
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,307
Is that what Liza is now?

168
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,040
Of course not.

169
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,639
But you took a vow,
to me and to the group.

170
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,721
Isn't it strange that we were
trying to scare her with water,

171
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,312
then she ended up drowning?

172
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,724
None of us even knew that
until we heard the news this morning.

173
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,920
Yeah.

174
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:14,356
There's a lot
at stake here, Jack.

175
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,525
Our futures.

176
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,933
As "masters of the universe."

177
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,699
If we don't stand together...

178
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,631
we all fall.

179
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,235
Remember that.

180
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,888
Sure your camera's not defective?

181
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,788
No, it's only on these six photos,
out of sequence.

182
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,758
The others are clean.

183
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,388
- Wow, look at that.
- What?

184
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,262
That. It's the same in every photo.

185
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,763
I don't see it.

186
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,235
Enlarge it.

187
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,686
A face.

188
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,019
And it's screaming.

189
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,839
- Do you see it?
- Not really.

190
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:08,005
Well, it's right there.
It looks like it's, uh... screaming.

191
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,480
People see Lincoln's face
in potato chips, too.

192
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,710
I think it's just
some sort of camera error.

193
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,446
Not as far as we can tell.

194
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,216
Well, I think I may
have found something.

195
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,985
Do you have more photos
of the oily window at the house?

196
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,287
Yeah, sure.

197
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,671
[Perri] So...

198
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:39,234
I kept thinking about
how you connected the dots yesterday

199
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,644
and when I woke up today, it hit me.

200
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,589
- They're not horns, they're...
- Circles.

201
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:55,650
...halos. I don't think
this is an occult symbol.

202
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,356
I think it's a crest,
for the Three Society.

203
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,193
- What is that?
- I've heard of it.

204
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,201
- It's a secret society, right?
- Very exclusive, very old.

205
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,238
So called because they initiate
three members every year.

206
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,239
The school's best and brightest.

207
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:12,744
Only no one knows who they are,
or anything about them because it's...

208
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:14,711
- Secret?
- Exactly.

209
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,772
But there were four people
at that house the night Liza died.

210
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,581
Three initiates and a senior member
to supervise. That makes four, total.

211
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,451
So, you're saying the ritual was...

212
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,286
Hokum. They burn candles, they chant.

213
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,985
It's their tradition, probably.

214
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,722
As is the idea of Liza
having to face her worst fear.

215
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,230
- Oh, why would they do that?
- T o build trust.

216
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,359
You share your worst fear with them,
then they help you face it.

217
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,599
So, this was just some super-secret
fraternity hazing gone wrong?

218
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:47,739
Well, if I'm right, Liza's death
was probably just a terrible accident.

219
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,317
I'm wondering.

220
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,752
What?

221
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:00,883
How you knew about the crest
for the secret society.

222
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,190
I can't say.

223
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,162
- You can't say?
- No.

224
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,425
- You can't say?!
- No.

225
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:15,304
- You were in a secret society?
- I told you, Kolchak, I can't say.

226
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,367
- Was it the Three Society?
- I went to Stanford.

227
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,142
These societies are usually
exclusive to one school.

228
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,649
- So you were in another one?
- I can't tell you.

229
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,948
Well, then you were.

230
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,412
OK, fine, fine.

231
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:37,492
But why, hypothetically,
would you join a group like that?

232
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,360
- Why not?
- They're elitist.

233
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,298
Cliques for snobs
who trade on connections to get ahead.

234
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,666
No, they're not!
They're about friendship.

235
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,364
- Friendship?
- Yes.

236
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,998
You forge a close bond
with a small group of people

237
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,975
and then you swear your allegiance
to them forever.

238
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,377
- So... you're still a member.
- Kolchak.

239
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,438
- Come on!
- No!

240
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,813
- I only want to...
- Zip it!

241
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,215
OK.

242
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,316
Professor Carr? Carl Kolchak,
Perri Reed, the L.A. Beacon.

243
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:13,161
- Sorry, I'm late for an appointment.
- Oh, we'll walk with you.

244
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,793
- How well did you know Jack Mercer?
- I'm his faculty adviser.

245
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,770
You were also his alibi
the night Liza died.

246
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,501
He hardly needs one. Jack's one
of the finest students at this school.

247
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,702
[Carl] What were you two
doing that night?

248
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,908
Designing a study program to incorporate
the fellowship Jack was just awarded.

249
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,780
And you were Liza Valenti's
faculty adviser, too?

250
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,217
Yes, I was.

251
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,484
Have you ever heard of
something called the Three Society?

252
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,287
I've heard whispers about members,
like everyone else.

253
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,420
Hear whispers about Liza
being initiated the night she died?

254
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:47,226
The night Jack said he was with you?

255
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,828
- Where are you getting all this?
- We can't tell him, can we?

256
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,496
No.

257
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,872
No, we told him we wouldn't.

258
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,674
Jack was with me the whole evening.

259
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,086
Now, if you'll excuse me...

260
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,059
- You think you rattled him?
- I think I did.

261
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,474
Jack!

262
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,238
- You talked to those reporters?
- Just once, before...

263
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,110
You were sworn to deny
any affiliation with this group.

264
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,150
That means you don't talk.
T o anyone!

265
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,654
The rules of this society
come before everything.

266
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,712
- I didn't say anything.
- He didn't...

267
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,258
You didn't tell them
you and Liza were initiates?

268
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,657
- No.
- Well, they know.

269
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,718
Or at least they're acting like they do.

270
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,925
Maybe I should have told them.

271
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,992
Maybe I should have
told the police, too.

272
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,766
- You know what you're saying?
- He didn't mean it...

273
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:07,903
All I know is that I searched that house
looking for Liza, just like you told us.

274
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,447
And I didn't kill her.

275
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,176
You think... I killed her?

276
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,222
- Well, did you?
- Jack...

277
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,818
I won't even dignify that
with a response.

278
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,095
[Mercer] She told me, you know.

279
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,762
That you tried to sleep with her,
but she turned you down.

280
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,830
When you wouldn't take no for an answer,
she said she'd go to the administration.

281
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,307
Come on, Jack!

282
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,903
No, it would have jeopardized
your tenure if she had told them.

283
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:51,149
Whatever our differences,
our vow binds us together.

284
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,282
Forever.

285
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:58,386
You break that vow and you'll
lose everything you've ever worked for.

286
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,556
The Society will make sure of that.

287
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,245
[gasps]

288
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,083
[grunts]

289
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,133
[screams]

290
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,556
[Perri] Why are we
sneaking into the morgue?

291
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,120
I want answers about
what killed Professor Carr.

292
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:09,531
- The results haven't been released.
- We're not waiting for that.

293
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,590
We're not?

294
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:13,570
- I have a confidential source.
- Another source?

295
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:14,799
This should be good.

296
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,071
OK.

297
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,710
Please tell me your source is alive.

298
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,646
About time, man, you're killing me.

299
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,754
- Who's she?
- Alex Nyby, Perri Reed.

300
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:36,418
She works with me at the Beacon.

301
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,225
Nice. Can I talk to you?
You know, man...

302
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,563
my deal is with you,
not the damn Beacon.

303
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,761
Your deal?

304
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:47,100
My man.

305
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:48,469
You said floor seats!

306
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,405
- What!
- They're floor adjacent!

307
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,409
What do you mean, "floor adjacent"?

308
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,843
Wait, you've been bribing
this man with tickets?

309
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:56,938
Oh, wait, this is your source?

310
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,483
- What are you, an orderly?
- Pathology specialist.

311
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:02,714
- Whatever. Kolchak!
- Next time, floor seats.

312
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,312
Of course.

313
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,352
The remains of Professor Richard Carr,

314
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,489
pronounced dead at the scene
at 2:47 p.m.

315
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,425
- Whoa.
- I can't even look.

316
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,398
This is how you look when
every bone in your body breaks.

317
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:23,498
- A human squish toy.
- Here's the thing.

318
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,476
No one saw him fall.
And he left no note.

319
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,308
He must have jumped after we saw him.

320
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,871
- Unless he didn't jump.
- You think he was pushed?

321
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:34,783
- Tell her what you told me.
- Oh. The blood splatter at the scene.

322
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,845
- It was on a 27-foot radius.
- So?

323
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,892
The building they think he fell from
was only five stories.

324
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,861
And that kind of damage only occurs
when a guy falls 50 stories, not five.

325
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,024
According to you... an orderly.

326
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,059
A pathology... specialist!

327
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,136
There's no building near 50 stories
on that campus.

328
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,438
Exactly.

329
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:03,447
Look, Liza, with no water in her lungs,
dies of drowning, her greatest fear.

330
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:07,315
Now, Carr, with no tall buildings,
dies from a high fall.

331
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,377
And what if that was his greatest fear?

332
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:11,649
But I thought you agreed
that this was about

333
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:15,557
a secret society,
not about raising some occult power.

334
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,026
Maybe it's both.

335
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,498
Excuse me, um, Perri Reed, right?

336
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,935
Do you like basketball?

337
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,567
[snickers]

338
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,575
- [door opening]
- What?

339
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,080
- The corpses, right?
- [door closes]

340
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,712
- [Carl] Working a big story?
- Yes, I am.

341
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,053
Hey, guys,
what are you doing here?

342
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,888
- We need your help.
- Oh, really?

343
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,552
Are you kidding?

344
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,564
Remember when you told me
to ask Jack about how Liza died?

345
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:54,792
Yeah.

346
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,596
Well, you knew drowning
was her worst fear.

347
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,102
Right.

348
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:03,540
Now Professor Carr dies from a fall,
which we're guessing was his worst fear.

349
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,269
Yeah.

350
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,435
Yeah, that's right.

351
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,947
- Someone's got to be behind it.
- Hmm.

352
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,444
And you think it's me?

353
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,487
How did you know drowning
was her worst fear, Devan?

354
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:20,457
- Jack and I used to be friends.
- Used to be? What happened?

355
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:24,393
Jack made it into the Three Society,
and I didn't.

356
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,431
You tried to get into the Three Society?

357
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:29,729
I approached Professor Carr,
but he acted like it didn't exist.

358
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,634
So he tapped Liza and Jack instead.

359
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:37,471
- And you got revenge.
- Me? No! No! No!

360
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,874
- It was Craig Boyer.
- Craig Boyer?

361
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,606
Yeah. Jack's new buddy.

362
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,843
The guy who had that bruise on his face
the day after Liza died.

363
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,476
Why would you say he did it?

364
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:48,985
You didn't hear?

365
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,955
And you guys are supposed to be
the professionals...

366
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,082
Hear what?

367
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,423
Craig was arrested.

368
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,986
Drug possession and suspicion of murder.

369
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:01,658
The toxicology report on Liza
found that she'd taken

370
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:04,258
a powerful, homemade
psychedelic drug.

371
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,998
- They think Craig gave her it?
- He's a chem major.

372
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,098
Apparently, he made it from chemicals
he stole from the lab.

373
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:14,635
Ones that later matched
those found in Liza's body.

374
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:16,544
At least that's what I'm writing.

375
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,982
It's too bad you guys
didn't get there first.

376
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:23,316
'Cause then we could work
on a story together, or something.

377
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,020
I phoned the coroner's office.

378
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:35,032
They won't have Carr's toxicology report
until tomorrow.

379
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,160
- I can't believe it.
- That we got scooped by that pipsqueak?

380
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,669
Yeah, that too.

381
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:44,607
But I meant the idea that Craig's drugs
killed Liza, or the professor.

382
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,371
It makes some sense, doesn't it?

383
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:50,039
Not if that drug was intended
to be ceremonial. An entheogen.

384
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,207
A what?

385
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,945
A hallucinogenic drug
used in a ritualistic context

386
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,646
to heighten the experience.

387
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,850
Maybe Craig didn't intend to kill them.
Maybe it was just an accident.

388
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,587
[Jain] Hey.
You guys gotta check this out.

389
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,088
These are pictures of Craig Boyer
on the way to his booking.

390
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,999
- Come on, Jain, not again.
- Just wait.

391
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,845
[Jain] Look at that.

392
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,878
Can you mask out the image behind it?

393
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,420
It's a boy.

394
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,508
[Carl] The question, T ony, is why
does this image keep appearing?

395
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,878
Couldn't it be a corrupted file,
or a double exposure of some kind?

396
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,383
But I changed the CCD
after the first pictures.

397
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,615
- Whatever. We've got the story.
- Drugs?

398
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,418
Craig cooked them.
Liza had them in her system

399
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,925
and the tox screen
will show Carr had them, too.

400
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:13,055
Look, even if he did, drugs don't
explain the damage to this man's body.

401
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,328
Maybe they do. Can I be you again?

402
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,628
- Heard of "mind over matter"?
- You mean ESP? Psychokinesis?

403
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,834
I was thinking of something
more tangible.

404
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:28,140
Really? That's so unlike you, Carl.

405
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:32,582
People have gone into self-induced
trances, causing injury to themselves.

406
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,814
Like stigmatas, spontaneously
bleeding on religious zealots?

407
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,514
- Exactly.
- So you're saying

408
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,454
Liza and Carr imagined their deaths?

409
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:43,255
The drugs Craig made are a hallucinogen.
Could have heightened the effect

410
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,923
- of falling off a building.
- No pun intended...

411
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,661
- "Heightened."
- Yeah, I suppose it could have.

412
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,760
But you still can't explain that.

413
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:56,364
And... neither can you.

414
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,408
[siren]

415
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,115
Why did you ask me down here, Craig?

416
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,058
To tell you I am not
going to take the fall for you.

417
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,958
For me?

418
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,658
They're not just talking about
drug charges, but about murder.

419
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,223
You made the drugs, not me.

420
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:25,565
You know that drugs
had nothing to do with this.

421
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,273
You think I killed Liza?

422
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,468
I've thought it the whole time.

423
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,739
When Professor Carr died,
I knew I was right.

424
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,180
- Why didn 't you say something?
- Because I was your friend.

425
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,183
That was the whole point of the society.

426
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,549
We were supposed to
look out for each other.

427
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,381
I just can 't do it anymore.

428
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,254
What are you talking about?

429
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,820
- Cutting a deal.
- To tell them what?

430
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,093
The truth of what happened that night.

431
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,500
How you really felt
about Professor Carr and Liza.

432
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,402
Suddenly the truth's important?

433
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:04,237
We're talking about
my future here, Jack!

434
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:11,715
I might be in jail right now,
but I am not going to prison.

435
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,547
Not for you, not for anybody.

436
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,920
You're on your own.

437
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,792
- Guard!
- [siren]

438
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,272
Anything?

439
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,580
No, nothing that makes sense.

440
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,721
You know, years ago, in Chicago,
my editor sent me out

441
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,320
to do some leg work
on this very important story.

442
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,627
The murder of a union boss.

443
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:05,328
I was just off the copy desk, it was a
big deal for me, I was nervous as hell.

444
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:09,601
But I'm knocking on doors and stopping
guys at the dock, asking questions.

445
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:14,236
And this one longshoreman
tells me he'll spill, off the record.

446
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,679
He fills my notebook.
I ended up writing on cardboard boxes.

447
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:18,841
What did he say?

448
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:22,512
Everybody knows it was the shipping
company but they're afraid to talk.

449
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:26,284
Busted the story wide open.
I think I'm sitting on a Pulitzer.

450
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:27,722
So? What happened?

451
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,727
I write the story.
My hands are shaking, I'm so excited,

452
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,730
and two hours before we go to print,
the cops make an arrest.

453
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:35,789
You know who they bag?

454
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,696
My source.

455
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,771
The longshoreman.

456
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,172
Truth was in front of me the whole time.

457
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:48,303
But I was so convinced I knew
what that story was, I got lost.

458
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,515
Start with certainties
and you will end up with doubt.

459
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,055
[sighs]

460
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,152
Where does your story start, Carl?

461
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,203
[Carl sighs]

462
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,905
[siren]

463
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,384
[hissing]

464
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,556
[choking]

465
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,859
[Perri] You hear about Craig Boyer?

466
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:49,763
Crushed mysteriously in his cell?

467
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,166
Yeah. And that's not all.

468
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:53,828
Coroner's report.

469
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,669
Professor Carr didn't have
the drugs in his system.

470
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,107
So the drugs don't explain these deaths.

471
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,734
No.

472
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,680
What are we missing?

473
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,512
Look, I went back to the beginning.

474
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,882
- T o where this story started.
- Liza's death?

475
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:12,946
Remember what you said? The society's
initiation is the same, every year.

476
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,925
And the occult stuff is just hokum.
Nothing ever happens.

477
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,258
- Right.
- What was different this time?

478
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,458
[Carl] That house.

479
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,468
- Who are you calling?
- Devan.

480
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,698
For what?

481
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:32,504
T o see if he can get his old friend Jack
to meet us back at the house...

482
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,101
where it all started.

483
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:49,485
- I'm here. What's this about?
- Saving your life, we hope.

484
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,701
- What's your worst fear, Jack?
- Just tell me how they died.

485
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:04,606
Know why the Three Society chose
this house for its initiation this year?

486
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:08,372
- I'll bet you're going to tell me.
- Because it had a history.

487
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,141
A history far worse than they knew.

488
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,479
This place made headlines
in the Beacon 1 1 years ago.

489
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,390
Why are you showing me this?

490
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,863
Your life is in danger. From whatever
killed Liza, Craig, and Professor Carr.

491
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,193
What is it?

492
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,861
It's what the four of you unleashed
that night without even knowing it.

493
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,769
[Carl] In 1 994,
Charles Dunmore moved his wife

494
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,773
and three children down from Barstow

495
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:40,572
after getting a job
at the old Figueroa brickyard...

496
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:44,012
Poor neighborhood, but a big house.

497
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,516
Dunmore sunk everything he had into it.

498
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,212
[woman on TV] Why do I always
have to be the mean one?

499
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,255
Why can 't you be the mean one ever?

500
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:54,917
- I can be...
- But you never are! Look...

501
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:59,292
[Carl] Not two months later
the brickyard shut down.

502
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:01,593
And so did Dunmore.

503
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,964
A co-worker would later say
Dunmore told him

504
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:09,166
he 'd rather see his family dead
than out on the street.

505
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,470
Is it any wonder pride is a sin?

506
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,376
He started with his daughter.

507
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,108
She never stood a chance.

508
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,315
[screaming]

509
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:32,489
His ten-year-old son woke
upon hearing his sister scream.

510
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,191
The boy grabbed
his little brother and ran.

511
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,130
- Frantic, they listened...
- [screaming]

512
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,905
... as their father went on
to kill their mother.

513
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,200
The boy was brave,
keeping his little brother quiet.

514
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:17,139
Not knowing if any second
their father would find them.

515
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,447
They dared not breathe.

516
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,495
Knowing he would find them.

517
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,365
Knowing they would be next.

518
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,216
And then... he gave up.

519
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,250
The weight of what he 'd done
must have taken hold.

520
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,924
[TV] Oh, God, what happened to you?

521
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,885
[Carl] The boy opened the cupboard
thinking he 'd saved his little brother.

522
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,787
Wake up.

523
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:52,200
Only then discovering
the terrible truth. He was too late.

524
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,295
[Carl] He was dead from fear.

525
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:58,474
[Devan] So, you think
that's the face in the photo?

526
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:02,609
[Carl] Dunmore's youngest son.

527
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,944
Literally, scared to death.

528
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:16,092
[Mercer] What is this to do
with what's happened?

529
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,153
Ancient folklore says that in those rare
instances when someone dies of fear,

530
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,461
the fear that killed them stays behind.

531
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,127
[Jain] Like the ghost of an emotion.

532
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,829
This is what you wanted to tell me?

533
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:30,169
The ghost of that little boy's fear.
I think you raised it.

534
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,300
Do you think it attached itself to us?

535
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:36,312
This image only appeared in pictures
that included Craig, Professor Carr...

536
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,779
or you.

537
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,279
You believe this?

538
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,685
Look, I don't know about ghosts, OK?

539
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,916
But I do know that
the mind is very powerful,

540
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,687
and it may only matter
that you believe it.

541
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,655
- You're crazy.
- We're trying to help you.

542
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,496
Just stay away from me.
All of you.

543
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,230
[door closing]

544
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:28,025
[woman on TV] I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

545
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,760
[man on TV] The point is...

546
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,462
[woman] Why do I always
have to be the mean one?

547
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,936
Why can 't you be the mean one
once in a while?

548
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,405
- [man] I can be...
- [door opening]

549
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:01,664
- Hey, guys?
- [Carl] What is it?

550
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:08,869
Well, these handprints.
Do you think these are Dunmore's kids?

551
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,601
- Why?
- Well, there's three of them.

552
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,475
Their names were kept out of the papers,
but look at these last two.

553
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:16,774
Gus...

554
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,509
and Jack.

555
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,380
Jack?

556
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,147
Oh my God.

557
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,744
Jack was adopted.

558
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,223
Jack Dunmore grew up
to be Jack Mercer.

559
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,726
That's why they chose this house.

560
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,888
Returning here was Jack's greatest fear.

561
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:35,454
why wouldn't he tell us?
Where are you going?

562
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,557
What?

563
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,201
[Mercer] Dad, please! No! No! No!

564
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,805
[father groans]

565
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,710
[Mercer] No! No!

566
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,501
It's over. It's over.

567
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,061
It's OK, Jack. He's not here.

568
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,581
He never was.

569
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,156
[Carl] Fueled by memory,
fear takes form.

570
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:48,931
Becoming a thing that lives
long after death.

571
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:07,883
Residing not just in our hearts,
but in the hidden bonds between us.

572
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:18,692
Fear so powerful cannot be escaped,

573
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:23,005
but it can be... destroyed.
