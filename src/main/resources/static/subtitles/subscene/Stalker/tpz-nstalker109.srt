1
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:14,413
[Carl] In nature, predators
cut off their prey from the pack,

2
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,484
Ieaving them vulnerable,
easy to attack.

3
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,180
[growls, barks]

4
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,519
[chatter, laughter]

5
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:31,625
Modern society values independence.
The strength to stand on our own.

6
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,666
To make our own way.

7
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,667
- [whimpering]
- [clock ticks]

8
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,728
Forfeiting not only the comfort of home,

9
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,401
but the bonds of family and community.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,645
[barking]

11
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,712
[children cheer]

12
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,686
[clock ticks]

13
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,726
Gus, Come on! Bring it back.

14
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,485
[barking]

15
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,836
But in our isolation, we become weak.

16
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:13,303
Perfect victims.

17
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,738
Gus!

18
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,512
[ticking]

19
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,149
- [sobbing]
- [hissing]

20
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:43,895
[barking]

21
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:46,800
Gus, where are you?

22
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,399
[sobs]

23
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,870
[screaming]

24
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,883
[barks, whines]

25
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:46,597
- Thanks for seeing us, Dr. Shields.
- I was surprised to get your call.

26
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,897
The press doesn't usually
take an interest in an accidental death.

27
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:55,601
That's our question. If the death of the
woman, Jennifer Owens, was an accident.

28
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,007
The decedent's body
was severely decomposed

29
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,375
and suffered significant
post-mortem predation,

30
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,970
but that was my conclusion, yes.

31
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,811
[Perri] Based on the bruise on her head?

32
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,977
A contusion on her left temple,
suggesting she fell, struck a rock

33
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:11,490
- which knocked her unconscious.
- So in actuality she died from...

34
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,927
Exposure. She never regained
consciousness as far as I can tell.

35
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:18,395
Any idea why she'd be
in that part of the park?

36
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,125
It's relatively isolated.

37
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,533
No, I generally leave questions
like that for the detectives,

38
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,163
but her car was found close by,
her purse inside.

39
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,902
- Maybe she went for a walk.
- In high heels?

40
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:32,638
As I say, that's a...
that's a police matter.

41
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,448
- This postmortem predation.
- Yes.

42
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,417
What about the predation on her face?

43
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,488
- What about it?
- Something ate through her nose,

44
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,822
deep into her brain cavity.
Pretty extreme, wouldn't you say?

45
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,657
I suppose so, yeah.

46
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,755
As I understand it, the bite signature

47
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:55,494
doesn't match any species
native to this area.

48
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,231
Where did you get that?
I didn't put that in my report.

49
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,399
Could this particular predation
have occurred before she died?

50
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,674
Uh, possible, but I don't see
any of the defensive wounds

51
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,341
that would suggest
she was attacked that way.

52
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,246
- Thank you for your time.
- Of course.

53
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,518
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

54
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,030
[hushed] Hey! Come here.
Come here. Come on.

55
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,537
Now, do you see what I mean?

56
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,440
I hate to tell you, your boss's answers
seemed convincing.

57
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,946
That's why I called you. I can't
go around his back and call the cops.

58
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,915
- What do you think killed this woman?
- I don't know, exactly.

59
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,008
Whatever it is, it's some mean-ass thing

60
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,815
that chomped through her face
and into her brain.

61
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,981
And you've been able
to determine that,

62
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,753
but the coroner in charge of the case
hasn't because...?

63
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:57,728
Because... he lacks imagination.

64
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,965
Or maybe you have too much of it.

65
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,266
Look, all I'm saying is, do your thing,

66
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,501
ask questions
and you'll see that I'm right.

67
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,446
[woman]
For a parent to outlive a child...

68
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,379
it's not supposed to be.

69
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,349
Every time I pack something in a box,

70
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,821
it hits me again that she's...
never coming home.

71
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,858
We're very sorry for your loss,
Mrs. Owens.

72
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,723
[Carl] Your daughter disappeared
two weeks ago, ma'am.

73
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,492
Have you any idea why she would
have been in that park that day?

74
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,261
We spoke often,
but she lived her own life.

75
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,929
I couldn't tell you
where she was on any given day.

76
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,665
Did she have a boyfriend

77
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,799
or someone who can give us
an insight into why she was there?

78
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,140
Oh, she didn't date much.
T oo busy with her work, I guess.

79
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,545
- She was a real-estate agent?
- Yes. Worked long hours.

80
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:52,482
Every weekend. Married to her job.

81
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,847
[hushed] I understand.

82
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,021
You don't think
this was an accident, do you?

83
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,291
Well, that's what we're
trying to determine.

84
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,800
Well, I don't care what anybody says.
I know it wasn't.

85
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,358
Why would you say that, Mrs. Owens?

86
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:18,903
This was taken the day
she got her real-estate license.

87
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,880
See that? That necklace
belonged to my grandmother.

88
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,715
It was an antique.
Jenny never took it off.

89
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,084
It wasn't found on her body.

90
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,521
Have you told the police
you think she was robbed?

91
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,718
Nothing else was taken.

92
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:39,093
I keep thinking, if only
I'd never given her the necklace,

93
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,328
maybe she'd still be alive today.

94
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,337
How do I look?

95
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,472
You look beautiful.

96
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,670
What's the matter?

97
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,283
Nothing. It's... Long day.

98
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,755
Aaron.

99
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,155
Aaron, worrying ages you.

100
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,332
Yes, you're right.

101
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,499
You're such a good son.

102
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,597
You always listen to your mother.

103
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,874
- Where are you going?
- Out.

104
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,608
[doorbell]

105
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,120
- Hello.
- [woman laughs]

106
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,752
Marlene, how do you stay so beautiful?

107
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,728
Flattery will get you everywhere.

108
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,526
- Oh.
- [woman laughs]

109
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,462
Oh, Aaron. How are you?

110
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,801
- I didn't know you had a date tonight.
- A mother can still have secrets.

111
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,046
- Where'd you get this?
- It's lovely, isn't it?

112
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,144
Don't wait up.

113
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,136
- You wanted to see us?
- Yes.

114
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,004
- I have to say, I'm a bit embarrassed.
- About what?

115
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:07,512
If it weren't for your questions, we may
have not ever thought to look for it.

116
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,774
It's very time consuming, because
it has to be done the old-fashioned way,

117
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:16,515
by examining the entire body with
a magnifying glass, believe it or not.

118
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,285
These are close-ups
of the victim's neck.

119
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:22,657
We found a needle mark, injected
right into the center of a freckle.

120
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,357
- Oh, my God. It's incredible.
- Then this was a homicide?

121
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,922
With a very careful killer.

122
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,867
I notified the detectives.
I'm embarrassed I missed this.

123
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,871
[Perri] Know what she was injected with?

124
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,339
Nothing came up
in her tox screen first time.

125
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,966
How is that possible?

126
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,342
A drug could have moved quickly
through her system, an anesthetic.

127
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,782
I ordered full blood work. I'd say
this rules out the bite to the face

128
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,341
- as the cause of death.
- Why is that?

129
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,684
There are a lot of animals
in Los Angeles,

130
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,589
but as far as I know, none of them
carry around a hypodermic needle.

131
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,650
- Right.
- I'm curious.

132
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:59,630
How did you two know to ask about
this case in the first place?

133
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,530
A, um...

134
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,126
- A necklace was taken.
- A necklace?

135
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,639
The dead woman's mother thought
maybe that was why she was killed.

136
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,696
Hm.

137
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,315
- What did he say?
- You were right. It was a homicide.

138
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,757
- He found a needle mark in her freckle.
- He found a needle mark?

139
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:32,059
No, I think you mean, I found it.
That's why I was trying to reach you.

140
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,065
- You found it?
- It took me all night.

141
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,000
He called you because
I told him about it this morning.

142
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,663
- It still doesn't make sense.
- What's that?

143
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,106
The killer's careful. He injects her
in a freckle to hide his crimes.

144
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,164
[both] Yeah.

145
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,679
Why be so careful if he's gonna smash
her head against a rock to kill her?

146
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,147
- Exactly.
- I don't know.

147
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,877
But Dr. Shields is right.

148
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,579
That wound to her face
makes even less sense.

149
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,454
I'm telling you, that's exactly what
killed her, not this bump on her head

150
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,982
that Dr. Credit-grabber
is telling you about.

151
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:09,795
[knocks]

152
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,764
Marlene?

153
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,035
[man] Hello? Anybody home?

154
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,102
[Marlene] Door's open.

155
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,179
[Marlene] I'm just...
I'm just getting ready.

156
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,917
- Mind if I mix myself a drink?
- [Marlene] Help yourself.

157
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,132
- Marlene!
- Yes?

158
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,568
I don't think your son likes me much.

159
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,868
[Marlene] What makes you say that?

160
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,773
Oh, he never seems
too happy to see me.

161
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:55,007
[Marlene] Aaron's protective,
that's all. He likes to take care of me.

162
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,726
[Marlene] I'm sure
the more time you spend together

163
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,388
the more he'll like you.
You just wait and see.

164
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,632
Are you all right?

165
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,731
Fine.

166
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,442
How do I look?

167
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,744
Amazing. Like you always do.

168
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,582
[Marlene] Beautiful.

169
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,488
We've got to be quick.
I've got work this afternoon.

170
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:22,330
Oh, I forgot my necklace.
Be right back.

171
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,256
She's a pretty woman.

172
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,656
She had a birthday coming up.

173
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,631
The same as mine.

174
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,532
It's not fair to die so young.

175
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:05,110
No, it isn't. [sighs]
You got anything?

176
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:09,375
I've called every zoologist
and biologist in southern California.

177
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,315
You agreed that needle mark
ruled out animal attack.

178
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:16,878
Yes, but, you know, I'm wondering why
an animal would eat into her flesh.

179
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,447
Why? Well, how about
because it was hungry?

180
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,120
It chewed through her cartilage
and bone, eating into her brain.

181
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,686
So if it was that hungry,
why go to all the trouble?

182
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,232
And if it wanted to kill,
why kill that way?

183
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,962
You ask the most interesting questions.
You know that?

184
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,368
What have you got?

185
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,738
I've spoken with her friends.
No one had talked to her in days.

186
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,141
- What about at her office?
- She would have been

187
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,305
showing houses on Saturday.
I've yet to locate her supervisor.

188
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,475
Hey, guys. I got something.

189
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,043
- [Carl] Where are you taking us?
- [Jain] The Beacon's research morgue.

190
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,454
[Perri] I forgot this existed.
It's old newspaper files, pre-1 980.

191
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,391
I like to come down and look around.
Which is how I found it.

192
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,692
- Or rather, Titus did.
- Who's Titus?

193
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:00,921
Speaking.

194
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,302
[Jain] Titus Berry,
this is Carl Kolchak...

195
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,932
- Hi.
-...and Perri Reed.

196
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,170
Jain said you found something.

197
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,372
[Jain] Yeah, I was, uh,
telling Titus about your story

198
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,746
about the woman
whose face was bitten through.

199
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,012
Well, you know something about that?

200
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,184
[Titus] Let the others scurry about

201
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,225
gathering their contemporary bits
of gossip.

202
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,783
Research.

203
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,353
That is where the joy lies,
and the fascination.

204
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,058
What did you find, Mr. Berry?

205
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,998
[Titus] Oh, the impatience of youth.

206
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:39,060
I have found something
which you would never find

207
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:44,132
on the ln-ter-net
or the World Wide Web,

208
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:47,440
where historical events
are erased from memory

209
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,812
if no one is there
to record them digitally.

210
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,483
- Your point being?
- This crime, it's happened before.

211
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,922
I remembered it the moment
Jain described it to me.

212
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:04,520
- When, before?
- November 1 7th, 1 970.

213
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,086
1 970?

214
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,498
Lois Arleta. Her body was dumped
in T opanga Canyon Park

215
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,900
after her disappearance
three weeks earlier.

216
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,303
A little like the death
we're investigating...

217
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,136
It's exactly like it, Ms. Reed.

218
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:20,235
Jain said something ate through
a woman's nose and face, into her brain.

219
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,406
You're telling me the same thing
happened 35 years ago, as well?

220
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,814
"Coroner's office stated
the damage to the face

221
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,681
was most likely the result of..."

222
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,916
- Animal predation.
- Did the police investigate?

223
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,252
[Titus] Yes, they did.

224
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:37,660
The investigating officer
is listed as Detective Collins.

225
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,221
H never determined
who or what killed this woman?

226
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,359
No, not her. Not any of them.

227
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:47,201
- Any of "them"?
- This woman was only the first.

228
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,797
There were two other victims,
besides Ms. Arleta,

229
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,934
their bodies
were found a few days later.

230
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,447
All three of these women
were killed the same way.

231
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,317
Los Angeles history.

232
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,790
Remember it,
or be doomed to repeat it.

233
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:18,663
- Where have you been?
- Aaron.

234
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:21,171
- Why aren't you at work?
- I left early.

235
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,502
What on earth for?

236
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:26,169
The police are investigating
the death of Jennifer Owens.

237
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,042
How did that happen?

238
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,412
One of the assistants
found a needle mark on her body.

239
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,474
I've had to order blood work.

240
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,421
Que será, será.

241
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,753
Two reporters know about it.
They... I...

242
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,623
I tried to throw them off,
but they know things.

243
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,195
- Like what?
- Like her necklace is missing.

244
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,602
- You think this is her necklace?
- Don't lie to me!

245
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,230
Watch your tone, young man.

246
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,774
I'm older than you, and much wiser.

247
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,279
I know... I know that. I...

248
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,294
You just need to trust me.

249
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,693
I'm going to take care of everything.

250
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,640
We're so close now.

251
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,017
Is it worth it, Mother?

252
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,213
You're asking me if it's worth
having more time together?

253
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,453
Of course it is.

254
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,125
Of course it is, darling.

255
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,254
Hello?

256
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,069
Hello?

257
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,353
- Can I help you?
- [gasps]

258
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,362
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

259
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:04,027
- No, I'm fine. Marlene Harmon?
- Yeah. I was just outside.

260
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:07,868
- Lovely home, isn't it?
- Oh, I'm not a client,

261
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,671
I'm a reporter. I'm Perri Reed,
I'm with the Los Angeles Beacon.

262
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,268
Oh, a reporter.

263
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,711
Yeah, I'm writing
a story about Jennifer Owens.

264
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,808
Weren't you her supervisor,
Mrs Harmon?

265
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,649
It's "Ms". Yes, I was.

266
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,422
We think someone
may have killed her.

267
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,750
Oh, my God.

268
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,763
Were you aware of anyone
who disturbed her or threatened her?

269
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,822
No, no.

270
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,460
Well, it might have been
an older man.

271
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,027
Oh, so there is a suspect?

272
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:44,166
Not exactly.
We're following... kind of a hunch.

273
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,178
Bit of a long shot, actually.

274
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,372
I see.

275
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,878
I've always thought it's so dangerous,

276
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,384
being a pretty young woman
like she was,

277
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:59,356
showing these houses to strangers,
all alone.

278
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,584
You think it might have been a client?

279
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:06,153
Anything could happen
in one of these empty houses.

280
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,324
And no one would be around to help.

281
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:14,336
I don't suppose you'd allow me to review
her calendar or her client list?

282
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,466
No, I can't do that,
not to a reporter. I'm sorry.

283
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,705
Oh, of course. No, I understand.

284
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,543
Here's my card.
My home number's written on the back.

285
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,880
If you can think of anything,
anything at all, please call.

286
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,613
OK.

287
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,678
I, uh...

288
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:34,320
I hope you won't find it inappropriate,

289
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:39,092
but I just have to say,
you're such a beautiful girl.

290
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,655
Thank you.

291
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:44,531
Such amazing skin.

292
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,001
What I wouldn't give
to be your age again.

293
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:57,276
It's all so fleeting, you know?

294
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,647
Yes, l... I suppose it is.

295
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,151
[man] Hello?

296
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,425
- Are you the realtor?
- [Marlene] I'm coming.

297
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:15,531
Excuse me... please.

298
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:24,336
- [Carl] Detective Collins?
- Detective, retired.

299
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,139
- You the reporter that called?
- Carl Kolchak.

300
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,976
You want to know about
this case from 35 years ago?

301
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,540
If you remember any details
that wouldn't have been in the paper?

302
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:37,850
Kinda hard to forget it.
Three women, faces disfigured,

303
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,016
their bodies dumped in the public parks.

304
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,560
Newspaper accounts
say the case was never closed.

305
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,458
Body dumps are the hardest.

306
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,021
Not knowing where somebody died
makes it much tougher.

307
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,261
Did you ever determine
the manner of death?

308
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,064
Mr. Kolchak...

309
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:56,130
I probably investigated
over 200 homicides in my career.

310
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,676
None of them gave me nightmares
like this one.

311
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,678
Why, because of the violence?

312
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,475
Because of the suffering.

313
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,038
Those girls had needle marks
on their bodies.

314
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:08,644
- They were injected with anesthetic?
- Paralyzed, but awake.

315
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,178
Helpless.
They died a slow, terrible death.

316
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,487
Never even had a chance
to cry out for help.

317
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,322
You never identified any suspects?

318
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,922
I said the case was never closed, but
I'm pretty damn sure I know who did it.

319
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:23,365
- Well, who was it?
- A doctor by the name of Luke Russell.

320
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,404
He'd stolen anesthetics
from the hospital where he worked.

321
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:30,271
- Why didn't you arrest him?
- We never got the chance.

322
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:33,106
Shot himself in the face
with a 9mm handgun.

323
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:37,911
- He's dead? Are you sure?
- Couldn't be much more sure.

324
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,845
Wait, and you're certain
he was the killer?

325
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,651
Well, the killings stopped
after we found his body.

326
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,020
Mr. Kolchak,
why are you so interested in this case?

327
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,723
Because another woman died
the same way recently.

328
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,823
And I thought maybe...

329
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,735
the same killer was back.

330
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,363
[chuckles] After 35 years?

331
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,036
Well, I'll tell you this,

332
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,703
if the same guy's going around
killing young girls at his age,

333
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,804
he's got a hell of a lot more energy
than I do.

334
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:15,382
Thanks.

335
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,828
[Perri] Get anything?

336
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:28,923
The detective from the 1 970s case thinks
the killer killed himself 35 years ago.

337
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,400
- How about you?
- Another dead end.

338
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,301
- [sighs]
- [Jain] I got something.

339
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:41,936
[Carl] What is it?

340
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,972
A burning desire compelled me
to look further back into our files

341
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:50,920
to see if there were any deaths
that were similar to those in 1 970.

342
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:55,187
- 1 935? You've gotta be kidding me.
- See for yourself.

343
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,836
[Carl] "Three women,
victims of wild animal attacks,

344
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,929
the flesh on their faces consumed."

345
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,032
- All unmarried. All young.
- Fascinating, isn't it?

346
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:16,647
- That's weird.
- Wait. 2005 to 1 970, is 35 years.

347
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:19,946
- 1 970 to 1 935, that's...
- 35 years.

348
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:24,819
That is very observant, Mr. Kolchak.
I had not noticed that myself.

349
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,018
- I know what you're thinking, Carl.
- Let's take a look.

350
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,719
[Carl] March 1 st, 1 900.

351
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,458
"Three ladies
in the West Adams District..."

352
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,593
"Attacked onto their faces."

353
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:41,571
Wow.
That can't be a coincidence, can it?

354
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,369
Want to go for 1 865?

355
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,241
The Beacon didn't start publishing
until 1 898.

356
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,047
[Perri] Let's give this
the benefit of the doubt.

357
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,176
- First murder occurs in 1 900.
- Right.

358
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:58,154
When this man would be,
let's be conservative here, uh, ten.

359
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,212
Right.

360
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:03,057
So he'd be... 1 1 5 years old now.

361
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,427
Going around killing women
in his walker.

362
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,838
Thanks for obtaining
the exhumation order, Detective.

363
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:21,675
Consider it a favor to Detective
Collins. He's an old friend of mine.

364
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:25,011
I'm not understanding your interest
in this man Luke Russell.

365
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,313
We think he may have
been involved in murders

366
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,250
similar to Jennifer Owens' in 1 970.

367
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,789
- That was 35 years ago.
- That's right.

368
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,950
How could he be connected to the
most recent death, if he's dead?

369
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,459
If he's dead.

370
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,386
[ratcheting]

371
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,331
[creaking]

372
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:57,105
I can confirm unequivocally
this man is indeed dead.

373
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:01,619
Yeah. I'm sorry
for wasting your time, Detective.

374
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:05,417
- No apology necessary.
- No, wait a minute. Excuse me.

375
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,152
- Look at that.
- [Shields] What?

376
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,389
- The entrance wound.
- What about it?

377
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,523
Well, there should be contact burns,
shouldn't there?

378
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,089
Well, there should be, yes.

379
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,659
Maybe there were,
they just... faded with age.

380
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:23,606
Yeah, but that wound. I would say
it's circular... not star-shaped.

381
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:28,073
It's hard to say,
given the condition of the body.

382
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,513
- What does it mean?
- The autopsy might have been wrong.

383
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:35,644
This man may not have been shot
at contact or even near contact range.

384
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,551
So, he didn't kill himself?

385
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:41,524
No, he may have been murdered.

386
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,429
Excuse me.

387
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,366
[heavy breathing]

388
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,977
- Gin.
- You win again.

389
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:13,218
- I don't like losing.
- Hm!

390
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,054
Marlene...

391
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,424
I know your secret.

392
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:26,937
Yesterday, I saw you
getting dressed. I...

393
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,836
I saw how you...

394
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,472
cover up.

395
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,075
That's makeup
on the back of your hand, isn't it?

396
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:47,222
Look, what I'm saying is you don't
need high collars or... or long sleeves.

397
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,385
Not for me.

398
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,658
You're a beautiful woman, Marlene.

399
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,726
Hugh, I don't want you to leave here.

400
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,136
Ever.

401
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:12,278
Jain said the suspect from 35 years ago
didn't kill himself. He was murdered?

402
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,376
- Possibly by the real killer.
- How does that work?

403
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,944
The detective said
Dr. Russell stole anesthetics

404
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,719
- the killer used to immobilize victims.
- He immobilized them?

405
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:25,388
Remember what Shields said about
Jennifer not having defensive wounds?

406
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,693
- Right.
- She couldn't fight back

407
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,133
because the killer paralyzed her
with an anesthetic.

408
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:33,193
So the killer got the drugs he needed

409
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,967
from this doctor
and then when the police closed in...

410
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,440
He killed the doctor.
Made it look like a suicide

411
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,375
so they thought they found their man.

412
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,211
- [sighs]
- You going home?

413
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,080
My parents are bringing over dinner.

414
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,780
Well, that's nice. They live in town?

415
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,846
I don't see them as much as I should,
but...

416
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,625
there's something about this story,
you know?

417
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,927
Yeah. I understand.

418
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,163
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

419
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,669
[phone rings]

420
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,911
- Kolchak.
- It's Nyby.

421
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,811
You gotta get back down here. Now.

422
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,609
A Jane Doe,
her body found by a horse trail rider

423
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,949
in Griffith Park a month ago.

424
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,515
[Carl coughs]

425
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,362
[Carl] Is that a woman?

426
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,195
- What's left of her.
- Yeah, her face is missing.

427
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,964
I'm never going to find a needle mark
to prove it, but you gotta believe me...

428
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,630
No, I believe you.

429
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:44,800
If she's been here a month,
how come you're only finding out now?

430
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:48,004
A clerical error.
Somebody misfiled her case.

431
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,379
But if I'm right, it means
Jennifer Owens wasn't the first victim,

432
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,441
she was the second.

433
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,520
It's two down, one to go.

434
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:21,535
- Aaron, where have you been?
- Driving.

435
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,843
You're late for dinner.
You didn't even call.

436
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,906
I, uh... [clears throat]

437
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,213
...performed an autopsy today.

438
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,381
- You perform autopsies every day.
- On Luke.

439
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,293
Luke?

440
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,995
How did that happen?

441
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,231
These reporters. They...

442
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:54,506
They know he's involved,
they just don't know how.

443
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,047
Well, then...

444
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,673
that's fine.

445
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,285
You told me he killed himself.

446
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,186
- Aaron.
- You killed him.

447
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:10,091
He did everything you said
his whole life and then you killed him.

448
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,561
Just like you're going to kill me.

449
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,190
No.

450
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,735
No, no.

451
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,430
Aaron.

452
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,318
I did lie to you.

453
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,782
To protect you.

454
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,793
Your brother was not like you.

455
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:48,826
He was not as strong, as devoted.

456
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:56,169
The police kept asking questions,
just like these reporters are doing now.

457
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,504
He would have told them everything.

458
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,170
He would've ruined everything.

459
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:04,043
So you shot him and made it
look like he killed himself?

460
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,481
And the police stopped asking questions!

461
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,348
They closed the case!

462
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,279
If I hadn't done what I did,

463
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,484
I would not be here now.

464
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,857
You would not be here now.

465
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,690
These reporters are not going
to stop asking questions.

466
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,929
They think an old man is responsible.

467
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,493
And an old man was.

468
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,165
I made sure of it.

469
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,799
What have you done?

470
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,971
I told you before.

471
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:41,283
I'm older... and wiser.

472
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,360
Everything's going to be just fine.

473
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,261
You'll see...

474
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:58,999
my love.

475
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,862
- [laughing] Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi.

476
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,464
Let me put these in the kitchen.

477
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,840
- Hey, baby doll. Mmm.
- Hey, Dad.

478
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,912
This place doesn't do takeout,
but your father insisted.

479
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,578
Well, for us they should.

480
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,384
The hospital board
eats there every week.

481
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,654
It really is excellent ltalian
food. Fantastic osso buco.

482
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,424
- Mmm.
- So, what's going on?

483
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:28,055
What do you mean?

484
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:29,827
You invite us over on a week night?

485
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,528
When was the last time she did that?

486
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,069
Never, I think.

487
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,196
I just wanted
to see you guys, that's all.

488
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,043
I guess it's just this story
I've been writing

489
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,912
about these women
who have been killed.

490
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:50,181
Makes me realize how lucky I am,
and vulnerable.

491
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,586
How easily it can
all be taken away from you.

492
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,252
So, who killed the women?

493
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:00,024
We don't know,
but they died terrible deaths, Dad.

494
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,625
I mean, something bit through
their faces, into their brains.

495
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:04,725
Nice dinner talk.

496
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,292
Every one of these women,

497
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,395
the killer consumed
their brain matter?

498
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,906
Apparently, yeah.

499
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,568
Must we continue talking
about this over dinner?

500
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,612
That's kinda strange, isn't it?
What part of the brain?

501
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,274
I don't know what it's called,
but it's right here.

502
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,112
Make any sense to you?

503
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,311
Only if it's not the brain he's after.

504
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:26,117
- What else could it be?
- Could be the pituitary gland.

505
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,953
What's that do?

506
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,016
It's sometimes called
the "master" gland.

507
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,995
It's the size of a... a pea,

508
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,259
highly prized
in some Asian cultures.

509
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,823
What for?

510
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,768
It controls every other
gland in the endocrine system.

511
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,668
Growth, sex, aging.

512
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:45,698
The myth is that
if it's consumed from a live animal,

513
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:47,334
it'll prolong life.

514
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,903
You're talking about cultures
that eat the glands of animals.

515
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,314
That's right.
But in this case, who knows?

516
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:56,649
- I've heard of stranger.
- So have l.

517
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:57,745
[phone rings]

518
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,347
Mmm. Excuse me.

519
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,618
[father] Mm-hmm.

520
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,662
- Hello?
- Ms. Reed, it's Marlene Harmon.

521
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,130
I'm sorry to call so late.

522
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,327
- It's all right. How can I help?
- I think I have some information

523
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:14,303
about Jennifer Owens' death
you might be interested in.

524
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:15,771
What kind of information?

525
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,535
Can you come over right now?

526
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,771
I'd like to speak to you,
in strictest confidence.

527
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:30,252
[Nyby] Ah. Here's her admitting file.
What are you looking for?

528
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,255
[Carl] You said someone
misfiled her case.

529
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,915
Yeah, I did.

530
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,288
I want to know who.

531
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:40,162
- Wait, you don't think...
- "Dr. Aaron Shields"

532
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,823
ruled her death "accidental".

533
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:45,335
The chew marks on the face,
"post-mortem predation".

534
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:48,167
- Just like Jennifer Owens.
- You were right, Alex.

535
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,706
Right from the start.

536
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:53,335
- Shields has been covering up?
- Yeah, for the real killer.

537
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,504
No doubt supplying
the anesthetics he needs,

538
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,140
just like Dr. Russell, 35 years ago.

539
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,708
I can't believe it.

540
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,480
Wait, who are you calling?

541
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,078
Hi. Is Perri there?

542
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:07,681
Do you know where she's gone?

543
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:11,250
Oh. Can you just tell her Carl
Kolchak's trying to reach her?

544
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,921
OK, thanks.

545
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,599
- What?
- Perri.

546
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,726
Her parents said
she had to leave for a story.

547
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:23,297
- You think it's this story?
- Well, she didn't say.

548
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,966
Do you have
Shields' home address?

549
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,010
I'll get it.

550
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,682
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

551
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,694
Dr. Shields?

552
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,731
Hello.

553
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,098
What are you doing here?

554
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,398
No more questions, dear.

555
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,066
[pained cry]

556
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:06,149
You're just gonna let this happen?

557
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,199
[ticking]

558
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,022
- [gunshot]
- [pained cry]

559
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,566
[siren]

560
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,069
[squealing tires]

561
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,641
[police radio]

562
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,845
You OK?

563
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,359
It's gonna be OK. I'm right here.

564
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,633
[Carl]
The past has endless stories

565
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:16,935
about tragedies that have struck
those who have come before us.

566
00:41:17,007 --> 00:41:19,339
A history of tears.

567
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,437
But nature remains
indifferent to our suffering.

568
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,278
Offering only a cold, hard truth.

569
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,443
One that becomes harder to bear,

570
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,510
the more we learn to love living.

571
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:37,083
That at the very moment life
first pumps through our veins,

572
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,221
the clock is set... to stop.
