1
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:07,833
[Perri] There are
countless stories in this city

2
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,932
about the lives lived here.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,877
About how the fates of others
intertwine with our own

4
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:16,143
in ways we can never expect or predict.

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,549
I'm a reporter.

6
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,381
This is my job.

7
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,513
To see, to understand.

8
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,787
But there are stories
behind these stories.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,557
Stories about terrors I've only
begun to train my eyes to see.

10
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:37,024
I've learned this seeing
carries a heavy burden...

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,371
because once open to the darkness...

12
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,534
our eyes can never be closed again.

13
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,892
What... What are you doing, man?
Let me go!

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,563
I said let me go, damn it!

15
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,260
I ain't playing with you.
Let me go!

16
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,768
What do you want, man?

17
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:14,967
Say something, man.
What do you want from me?

18
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,134
What do you want from me? Huh?

19
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,384
[creaking]

20
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,792
No. No. No, man, no!

21
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,385
Man, don't!

22
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,192
Please God, no!

23
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,357
No! No!

24
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,230
Man, no!

25
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:46,204
No, please God, no!

26
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,933
[screams]

27
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,769
No! No!

28
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,451
[thumping]

29
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,117
[Perri] Hey.

30
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,183
Hey.

31
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,957
[phone rings]

32
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,492
Kolchak.

33
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,768
- Who was that?
- Hung up.

34
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,934
Working on a story?

35
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:55,997
Yeah.

36
00:02:56,075 --> 00:03:00,102
T odd Hoffman, USC grad student.

37
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,705
Three nights ago he went
to a Lakers game with friends,

38
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:05,979
then headed south on foot.
No one's seen him since.

39
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:09,886
Missing persons case. You wrote
a missing persons story last week.

40
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,720
And another one a week before that.

41
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,693
That's four people missing
from downtown inside a month.

42
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,821
All of them disappeared
without a trace.

43
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,922
- What's the connection?
- Beats me.

44
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,058
I'm hoping you can figure it out.

45
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,399
[Perri] Three men, one woman.

46
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,407
Ages range from 26 to... 58.

47
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,239
Rich, poor, black, white, Latina.

48
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,337
LAPD's drawn no conclusions whatsoever.

49
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,041
So who says there's a story?

50
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,345
I do.

51
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,350
Because?

52
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,819
Because, that's my angle.

53
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,082
T ony says I got nothing,

54
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,021
so I got to figure a way
how to sell it to him.

55
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,525
Jeez. Boring T ony

56
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,893
and his weird preoccupation
with printing verifiable facts.

57
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,524
Ha! The big words
indicate sarcasm, right?

58
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,862
Mm-hmm.

59
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,461
Carl, sometimes a reporter
needs more than just his gut.

60
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,136
So. What are you...

61
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,080
What are you still doing here?

62
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,083
My birthday party.
Aren't you going to go?

63
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,586
Your birthday party?

64
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,282
I don't recall you...

65
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:21,293
It's a surprise party they're throwing
for me, all the folks in the office.

66
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,625
I...

67
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:27,462
Well, what can I say?
I sussed it out. I'm a reporter.

68
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,525
And a fine one at that.
Happy birthday.

69
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,128
I really don't know
anything about it. Seriously.

70
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,733
Well. It's, um...
Pretty sure it's at my apartment.

71
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:41,041
So, I just thought maybe
you might want to...

72
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,311
Yeah, yeah. Maybe I'll swing by.

73
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,045
Cool, um,
I guess I'll see you later then.

74
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,146
Maybe.

75
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,232
[chime]

76
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:09,634
[chime]

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,045
[man] Hey, Kolchak. Hey.

78
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,449
Can I help you?

79
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:29,086
Yeah. Yeah, what's my answer?

80
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,259
What's... What's my answer?

81
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,191
I'm sorry. Do we know each other?

82
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,669
What? Yeah.

83
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,139
I was 227, you were 223.
So give me my answer.

84
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,808
Sir, l... I don't have
any answer for you.

85
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,142
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

86
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,843
Hey, you contacted me,
all right? Don't jerk me around.

87
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,443
I'm not jerking you around, sir.

88
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,387
You say I contacted you.
How exactly did I do that?

89
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,789
Through your articles. The secret code.

90
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,326
The secret code?

91
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,056
Yes. Yes!
What... What did I just say?

92
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,859
I broke the code.

93
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,991
Each letter represents an integer.

94
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,228
Fibonacci numbers. A child could see it.

95
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,270
The first sentence,

96
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:14,033
one-one-two-three-five-eight,
P-A-U-P.

97
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:18,510
Minus four, based on the first numeral
of my address, again. Obvious.

98
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,639
P minus four equals L.
P-A-U-L. Paul.

99
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,275
And, you are Paul?

100
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,842
Hey, man, why are
you messing with me?

101
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,649
You know I don't have much time.

102
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,385
All right. Look, I think
I'm starting to understand.

103
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,917
Here's my question. Did you sign in
with the security guard in the lobby?

104
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,089
Of course not. I snuck in.

105
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,963
OK, see, that's not gonna work.

106
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,333
I'll give you your answer,
but first we have to go downstairs,

107
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,532
sign in with the guard.
It's procedure.

108
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,768
Ah. Procedure. OK, I got you.

109
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,507
I don't know what game
you think you're playing,

110
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,605
but as I told you,
I don't have much time.

111
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,446
- Which you know!
- Yeah.

112
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,544
Now, let's start again.

113
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,283
You've been writing about me
the last couple of weeks.

114
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,552
The missing persons.

115
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,184
The missing persons?

116
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,751
You keep repeating what I say,

117
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,354
I'm gonna put one
through the bridge of your nose.

118
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,956
- OK, let's...
- T o hell with this!

119
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,898
- I do not have the time.
- Paul, don't...

120
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,528
- Turn around! Turn around!
- Don't do this. Paul...

121
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,196
Your car keys. Hurry.

122
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,975
- A GT. Where is it?
- Employee parking, level two.

123
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,240
- What color is it? What color?
- I don't know.

124
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,804
It's gold and metallic.

125
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:30,974
Please don't do this.

126
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,608
You're not giving me much choice.

127
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,983
I gotta get out.
The Old Man's gonna be waiting.

128
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,887
You know, you should have
just given me my answer.

129
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,925
- [man grunts]
- [Carl groans]

130
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,441
[rattling]

131
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,425
Paul?

132
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,361
[hushed]
Keep it down. He'll hear you.

133
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,281
Now, I'm gonna take my hand away.

134
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,080
But you have to be
real quiet, all right?

135
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,712
Little mouse voice. Understand?

136
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,726
- What do you want from me?
- You know what I want.

137
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,695
I want my answer.

138
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:54,927
- I don't have any answers...
- Little mouse voice.

139
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,498
Yes, you do. Yes!

140
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,040
No, I don't. I...

141
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,042
I don't know who you are,
or what to tell you,

142
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,543
I think you've got the wrong guy.

143
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,511
I don't have the wrong...

144
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,356
I don't have the wrong guy.

145
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,157
You're Carl Kolchak.

146
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,757
You were 223, I was 227.

147
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,429
We talked. Lots.

148
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,664
I don't know what 223 or 227...

149
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,569
- I don't know what that means.
- Ah!

150
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,664
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,443
St. Elizabeth's, Carl.

152
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,037
Psych ward.

153
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,105
They had you in room 223.

154
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,914
I was in room 227,
two doors down.

155
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:51,684
Yeah, it was only
like a year and a half ago,

156
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,554
so don't act like you don't remember.

157
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,924
Yeah, I was in St. Elizabeth's.

158
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,827
- It was right after my wife died.
- Yeah. Exactly.

159
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:05,337
But I swear,
I don't remember you. I'm sorry.

160
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:09,704
They... They had me on
very heavy psychotropics. They...

161
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,242
It was a very bad time for me.

162
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:14,302
Ah. Whereas for me, it was Club Med.

163
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:26,555
Fine. Say you don't remember me
from St. Lizzie's.

164
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,493
Still, one simple fact remains.

165
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,594
You've been contacting me
through the secret code

166
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,362
you've inserted in your
newspaper articles.

167
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,561
Don't! Don't shake your head!

168
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,367
You shake your head at me
and I'm going to cut it off!

169
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:48,004
I'm sorry. I apologize.

170
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,517
Please, take me through this...
this code-breaking process.

171
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,816
Was this about the missing
persons stories I wrote?

172
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,454
Are you saying
that you were responsible

173
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,823
for the people I wrote about?

174
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:05,352
That y... you were
the reason they went missing?

175
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,729
I'm not responsible.

176
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,928
The Old Man! He's responsible!

177
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,096
Who's the Old Man?
Is that your father?

178
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,469
What?

179
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,271
What kind of question is that?
You keep changing the subject!

180
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,340
Look!

181
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,840
Look.

182
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,444
Right here, in the King's English.

183
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,749
"Paul, I have your answer."

184
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:35,055
You wrote that and I found it.

185
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,061
Undeniable.

186
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,860
I passed your test.

187
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,025
Now you give me my answer!

188
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,700
The answer to what?

189
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,203
Which... Which answer?

190
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,766
I mean, there's lots of
questions I can think about.

191
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,744
Important questions that need answers.

192
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,007
You know that.

193
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,778
That's...
That's part of my test for you.

194
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,719
The answer to what?

195
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,313
Say it.

196
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,222
I want...

197
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,421
the answer...

198
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,192
to how I get out of here.

199
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,032
[? funk]

200
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,544
He didn't know about the party?

201
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,208
- That's what he said.
- He must have known.

202
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:35,617
He was invited.
Anyway, you told him about it, right?

203
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,053
So how come he's not here?

204
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,523
I don't know, he's busy,
he doesn't like parties...

205
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,787
It's Kolchak. Who knows?

206
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,852
But Kolchak loves you.

207
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,228
I mean he doesn't... Well...

208
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,097
He doesn't "love" love you.

209
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,636
He "like" loves you.

210
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:54,935
Respects you as a professional.

211
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,100
A meeting of the minds.

212
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,277
Jain? What exactly
are you drinking? Hmm?

213
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:03,713
You know what? I'm calling him.

214
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,513
No. No-no-no. Jain.

215
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,619
Paul, why can't you leave?

216
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,783
Who's keeping you here?

217
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:14,917
[buzzing]

218
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,458
What am I hearing?

219
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,682
All right, uh...

220
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,016
Well, let's talk about
the Old Man. Is he here?

221
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,180
Course he's here. He's always here.

222
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,191
Where is he? I don't see him.

223
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,318
Why would you see him?

224
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,625
He's in the back bedroom.

225
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,494
He lives in the light switch.

226
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,467
- I don't understand, Paul.
- He hides there.

227
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,995
And here.

228
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,030
That's why I can't leave.

229
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,374
He won't let me.

230
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:09,540
He gets mad at me and
he gets bigger inside my head

231
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,742
and my skull splits open.

232
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,748
- It's unbearable.
- Yeah?

233
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:20,356
He screams in my head.

234
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,956
He makes me smell bad smells.

235
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,190
He moves around inside my body.

236
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,324
My shoulder, my penis.

237
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,433
One time he was in my toes.

238
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,700
I had him then.
I had him good, I thought.

239
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:38,969
Oh, God.

240
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,647
Once I cut 'em all off,

241
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,980
I realized he was right back
in my shoulder. You see?

242
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,214
But down the hall...

243
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,527
that's all his.

244
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:04,068
You cross the yellow line,
you're his forever.

245
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,600
That's where the others all went.

246
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,275
Down the hall.

247
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,835
The missing persons?

248
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,405
Is that where you put 'em?

249
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,950
Are they still back there?

250
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,918
Are they still alive?

251
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:25,286
You promise me answers,
but all I hear are stupid questions.

252
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,257
What are you going to do with those?

253
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,455
I'm going to carefully cut your
head open. My answer's in there.

254
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,963
- I'm gonna find it.
- Paul.

255
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,967
If I start screaming,
the Old Man's going to hear, right?

256
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,059
Huh?

257
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:42,002
You're right. He's gonna...

258
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,140
[laughs] You passed my test.

259
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,617
You passed my test
with flying colors, Paul.

260
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,486
[Paul laughs]

261
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,715
I'm gonna help you now.

262
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,292
Uh, my car.
Did you use it to bring me here?

263
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,419
Where is it?

264
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,727
Parked out back, in the alley.
I hid it under a tarp.

265
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,290
Oh, good thinking.

266
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,996
Look, it's got everything
we need to get rid of the Old Man.

267
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,539
So you check the trunk.
I got equipment in there.

268
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,130
And all you need to do is...

269
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,642
is go out and get it
and bring it back here.

270
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,111
And then we'll get to work. OK?

271
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:11,718
Hey!

272
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,331
Hey!

273
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,129
You gotta help me!

274
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,998
I'm trapped in here!

275
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,505
I'm being held hostage.

276
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,974
- Who are you?
- My name is Carl Kolchak.

277
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,207
I've been kidnapped by the man
who lives in this house.

278
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,372
Paul Krieger?

279
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,746
Paul, yeah, that's his name.

280
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,717
Do you know him?

281
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,846
I'm Stanley Kim, his caseworker.

282
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,514
L.A. Department of Mental Health.

283
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,787
Oh, yeah. I'd say
he definitely needs you.

284
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,658
Look, please, just call
the police. We don't have much time.

285
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,061
Where is he right now?

286
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,326
He's in the alley behind the house.

287
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,627
[bleeping]

288
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,871
- Police.
- [Carl sighs]

289
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,069
Yeah, I'll hold.

290
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,840
- [electrical buzzing]
- [Kim groans]

291
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,720
- [grunting]
- [groaning]

292
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,299
What are you gonna do to him?

293
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,578
Paul, be mad at me, not him!

294
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,545
It was my idea.

295
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,048
He didn't do anything!

296
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,108
Paul, talk to me!

297
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,584
What are you gonna do to him?

298
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,314
I'm gonna feed him
to the Old Man.

299
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,152
- [Kim] Paul?
- I got no choice.

300
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,285
You woke him up.
Now I gotta give him somebody.

301
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:53,991
[Kim] Paul?
What are you doing? Paul, Paul.

302
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,035
- [Kim] Let me go. Paul! Paul!
- This is on you, Carl.

303
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:01,038
- This is on your head.
- [Kim] Let me go! No!

304
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,574
[Kim yells, sobs]

305
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,135
[Kim screams]

306
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,916
[Krieger] I had half a mind
to give you to the Old Man, instead.

307
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,325
But I need you.

308
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,828
I liked old Stanley.

309
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,092
He was OK.

310
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,896
Even if he was a little nosy.

311
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,493
Stanley. That was his name?

312
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,972
That was the name
of the man you just killed?

313
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,303
I didn't kill him.

314
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,539
I ain't killed anybody since 1 990.

315
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,842
The Old Man got him.

316
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,440
And when the Old Man gets you,
you're worse than dead.

317
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:51,545
Look at you.

318
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,048
Trying to make me feel guilty.

319
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,855
Trying to shift the blame.

320
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,726
You're way more
of a murderer than I am!

321
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,459
Now, let's see what you
had in your car, huh?

322
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,907
Cattle prods.

323
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,840
Glow sticks.

324
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:18,880
Climbing ropes.
Useless, useless crap.

325
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,879
What's this, a camcorder?

326
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,954
- What is it?
- It's a thermographic camera.

327
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,323
It takes pictures of heat.

328
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,330
That's it. You know what?
I'm just gonna cut your head open.

329
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,923
- I'm not gonna waste more time.
- What if it doesn't work?

330
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,935
What are you going to do then?

331
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,368
Think about it, Paul.

332
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,770
If you cut my head open, I'll die.

333
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,967
What if you don't find
what you're looking for?

334
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,033
Then you've got nothing.

335
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,136
You'll be alone.

336
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:51,307
It'll just be
you and the Old Man, forever.

337
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,687
You know, I'm understanding
something now, Paul.

338
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,087
I'm understanding that you're right.

339
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,717
The answer is up here in my brain.

340
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:05,388
But it's... It's buried deep
in my subconscious.

341
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,194
See, that's why it's...
it's tricky to get at.

342
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,894
But it's not impossible.

343
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,740
Keep talking.

344
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,775
How did I contact you
in the first place?

345
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,311
It was through the secret code
in my articles, right?

346
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,348
I mean, messages
I wasn't even aware I was sending.

347
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,439
Because it was...

348
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,041
It was my subconscious mind

349
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,111
communicating
through my fingertips as I typed.

350
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,383
So, don't you see, Paul?

351
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,754
You and l,

352
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,487
the only way we're
gonna get to the truth

353
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,358
about what's locked up in here...

354
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:43,192
is for you to let me write your story.

355
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,329
[Perri] Thank you for coming.

356
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,431
- [man] You're welcome.
- [woman laughs]

357
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,137
Jain, you gonna sprout roots,
or you gonna let me call you a cab?

358
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,274
- It doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't?

359
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,252
I left Kolchak three messages.
Why wouldn't he call me back?

360
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,551
It's one in the morning,
he's probably in bed.

361
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,217
- Maybe he turned off his phone.
- [sighs] Perri...

362
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:12,320
We are hard-charging newspaper
men in a city that never sleeps.

363
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,490
Since when do we turn off our phones?

364
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,693
You know yourself, this isn't like him.

365
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,867
Jain, I don't know.

366
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,705
I don't know Kolchak well enough

367
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:28,610
to say what's like him
and what isn't and neither do you.

368
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,671
Except...

369
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:33,843
You know, if he thought
that something happened to you,

370
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,788
or to me, even if it was just
some crazy feeling he was having

371
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,985
he'd check on us
to make sure we were OK.

372
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,153
I do know that much about him.

373
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,299
[Jain groans]

374
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,338
[door opening, closing]

375
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:06,143
I can't write like this.

376
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,083
You'll have to unlock my wrists.

377
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,593
So, now what?

378
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,630
Now, start talking.

379
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,107
T ell me about the Old Man.

380
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,235
When did he first come to you?

381
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,869
St. Elizabeth's.

382
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,105
Why were you there?

383
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,811
Prison dodge. Had a good lawyer.

384
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,855
He got me sent there instead of Chino.

385
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:48,052
Anyway, it's not like
I belong in a nut house. Kinda like you.

386
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:52,222
Had to play the game after
they blamed you for killing your wife.

387
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,857
Anyway, I was due for some good luck.

388
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,457
My old lady was a junkie whore.

389
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:00,232
I laid eyes on her maybe
three times my entire life.

390
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,364
She palmed me off on my grandparents.

391
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,705
Couple of real Bible-thumpers.

392
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,371
They never trusted me.

393
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,471
Ever.

394
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,244
One day when I was 1 9,

395
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,945
I was in the kitchen
and my Grams starts in on me

396
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,921
about how I stole some money out
of her purse, like, 1 1 dollars.

397
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,752
Ridiculous. So what?

398
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:22,453
But she's yelling
like I robbed Fort Knox!

399
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,757
Yelling in that damned
screeching voice of hers,

400
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,024
screeching in my head.

401
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:29,965
So the next thing I know, I got
a handful of her hair, and I'm just...

402
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,498
So then...

403
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:43,343
I had to go do
the same thing to Gramps.

404
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,110
I mean, what choice did I have?

405
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,620
What, was I gonna look him in
the eye? The look he'd give me?

406
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,986
I just couldn't stand to see that.

407
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:57,758
Anyway... I ended up at St. Elizabeth's.

408
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:02,596
And one day, when they were
giving me shock therapy...

409
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:06,831
I look up and there's
the Old Man, smiling down at me.

410
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,030
Showing those sharp little teeth.

411
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,175
Nobody else could see him
except for me.

412
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:18,945
And he says, "You're mine."

413
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,912
'Cause of what I'd done.

414
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,615
And I knew right then,

415
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,214
he was never gonna
leave me alone after that.

416
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,793
He wants me bad.

417
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,558
Real bad.

418
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,560
But I can't let him get me.

419
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:44,400
Paul, if he wants you,
what about the others?

420
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:48,537
The ones you send down in the
hallway? Why does he take them?

421
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:54,610
He's always screaming
in my head, making my head hurt.

422
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,949
Yelling at me to cross the yellow line.

423
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,184
He wants me
in that back bedroom with him.

424
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,520
So...

425
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:06,225
sometimes I give him
somebody else instead.

426
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,426
And then he's quiet for a little while.

427
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,696
I don't like doing it.

428
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,534
I feel real bad for those people.

429
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,338
I have your answer now.

430
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,176
There is no Old Man.

431
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,351
There never was.

432
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,860
- What are you talking about?
- You invented him.

433
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:39,522
The guilt you feel about
your grandparents is so overwhelming

434
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,294
that it makes you see
your very own devil.

435
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,699
One that you created,
one that doesn't exist.

436
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,465
Oh yeah, Dr. Freud?

437
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,598
Then what's waiting
at the end of that hall?

438
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,871
Nothing. It's just an empty bedroom.

439
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,003
And that's your answer.

440
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,208
And you and I could
walk out of here any time.

441
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,375
It's up to you.

442
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,744
You know how many
times I heard that, Carl?

443
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:09,286
Every doctor
at St. Lizzie's told me that!

444
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,524
But you? Out of all the people,
I thought you would believe me.

445
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,565
You know what it's like
to be called crazy!

446
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,430
We're not talking about me, Paul.

447
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:19,561
You told me your wife was killed
by monsters, and I believe you.

448
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:23,438
But what? Was that just your
guilty conscience talking? Huh?

449
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,841
Was that just a wild story you
confabulated so as you could sleep?

450
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,401
We're not talking about me, Paul.

451
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,913
You and I have nothing in common.

452
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,448
Oh, yeah? Really?

453
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,944
This camera sees through walls.

454
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:37,511
It takes pictures of heat.

455
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,284
I want you to go down the hallway,

456
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,019
aim it at that closed door.

457
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:45,256
And if your Old Man's there,
you'll see him.

458
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,100
Go on. Do it.

459
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,198
You're sure that Old Man's
there, prove it to me.

460
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,752
There.

461
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,226
[Krieger] See?

462
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,494
What did I tell you?

463
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,036
[Krieger] See him?

464
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:37,838
- T ell me you see him.
- I see something.

465
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,413
What's the matter with this thing?

466
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,323
I don't know. The battery may be dead.

467
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,552
- Anyone back there?
- Don't.

468
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,693
[creaking]

469
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,673
[panting]

470
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,942
Mr. Kim.

471
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,848
Please... help me.

472
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,889
- No!
- Paul, he's hurt. Let me go!

473
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,017
It's a trick.
He wants you to cross the line.

474
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:25,256
- What? Damn it, let me go!
- Hey!

475
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,232
That's the Old Man. Right there.

476
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,134
Plain as day. Don't you see him?

477
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,866
Paul, I'm Stanley. Please.

478
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,205
- You're the Old Man.
- I'm Stanley, Paul.

479
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,177
Stanley.

480
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,476
For God's sake,
you stabbed me, remember?

481
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,479
You took me in the back, stabbed me,
then dumped me out of the chair.

482
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,044
- You always lie. Stop lying!
- [Carl] Paul.

483
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,352
Paul, calm down. Put the gun down.

484
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,723
[Kim] Try...
Try and focus, Paul. Please.

485
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,958
Have you... Have you
taken your chlorpromazine?

486
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,727
Remember how we talk about
how you always need to take it?

487
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,770
- Stanley tells me, not you.
- Paul, don't.

488
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,304
I'm bleeding bad.

489
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:11,365
I think... I think I'm going
to die if I don't get an ambulance.

490
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:16,004
- T ell him, Mr. Kolchak.
- See? He knows your name.

491
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,310
How would he know
unless he's the Old Man?

492
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,216
Because I told him.
I told him when he first came here!

493
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:26,986
Remember how you and I always
talk... talk about Mr. Kolchak?

494
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,026
How you say
he's sending clues to you?

495
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:33,496
Your interest in his wife lrene?

496
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,829
What? What about my wife?

497
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,027
He's... He's fixated on her.

498
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:42,129
He was on day-release
from St. Elizabeth's

499
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,196
when she was murdered.

500
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,799
He came back talking
about Las Vegas.

501
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,812
Something scary in the desert.

502
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,711
He had blood on his pant leg...

503
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,215
Shut up, Old Man.

504
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:56,481
I... I never... never put two
and two together until now.

505
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,284
I swear to you,
I never thought he had it in him.

506
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,291
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

507
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,851
No, stop! Take me back!
Let me hear the rest!

508
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,624
T ell me about my wife.

509
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,394
He's lying! That's what he does.

510
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,901
Paul! Don't hurt him. Paul!

511
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,160
Paul!

512
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,409
I checked the parking deck
on my way up. His car's not there.

513
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,215
[Perri] He left in a hurry.

514
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,813
His jacket's still
on the back of his chair.

515
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,985
Something doesn't feel right, T ony.

516
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,496
Honestly, if it was the Carl Kolchak
I knew two years ago, I would agree.

517
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,589
But the one who works for me now...

518
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,190
Couldn't tell you.

519
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,736
Why do you say that?

520
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,772
The death of lrene, it changed him.

521
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,539
He's driven now by demons
I can't even begin to understand.

522
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,805
But if I had to guess,

523
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,347
I'd say he probably just
doesn't want to be reached.

524
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,209
What else do you have?
How can you track him down?

525
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,188
I don't know.
There's nothing here.

526
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,451
I mean... [sighs]

527
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,554
What?

528
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,293
He got a telephone call before I left.

529
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,392
He said it was a hang-up.

530
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,266
Maybe if we could get it traced...

531
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,546
[Kim] No, I'm not the Old Man.

532
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,446
[approaching engine]

533
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:35,478
- Perri! Perri, it's me.
- Carl, what are you doing?

534
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:38,515
I'm being held hostage. Me and another
guy who needs an ambulance.

535
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,177
- Get away and call the police.
- Can you climb out?

536
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,550
- My foot's chained.
- I'm not leaving you here.

537
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,055
Perri, this guy is a lunatic.
He's got a gun.

538
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:49,116
Listen to me and get
the hell out of here, OK?

539
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,820
Come on. [grunts]

540
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,658
Help me, damn it!

541
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,534
[Perri] Move.

542
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:01,129
For God's sake.
What are you, Nancy Drew?

543
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,505
Oh, God. Are you OK?

544
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,840
Wonderful. How did you find me?

545
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:10,107
Remember we were
talking in the newsroom

546
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,014
and you got that hang up call?

547
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,314
Well, I traced it to this address.

548
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:18,480
- Well, good job.
- It's all I had, so...

549
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,820
You trusted your gut?

550
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,588
Someone once told me a reporter
needs more than their gut.

551
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,755
Yeah, and a nice set of bolt cutters
would be great about now, too.

552
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,765
Yes, I'd like to report a man with a gun

553
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:31,461
at 4809 Pampas Street.

554
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,996
He's holding two hostages, one of whom
needs immediate medical attention.

555
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,067
This is Perri Reed with the Los
Angeles Beacon. Please, hurry.

556
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,542
They're on their way.

557
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,605
Sorry I missed your birthday party.

558
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,484
- How was it?
- Uh, well, you know...

559
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:53,957
Uh... people drinking,
having a good time.

560
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:57,517
Friends helping me celebrate the fact
that I'm one year closer to death.

561
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,187
The usual.

562
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,298
Perri. I... I...

563
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:12,101
You know, when so many people
tell you you're crazy,

564
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:13,438
you start to wonder.

565
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,410
And you shut them out
to protect yourself.

566
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:24,149
And you feel like you need
to take things on alone.

567
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,213
But Carl, you're not alone.

568
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,391
You have friends who believe in you.

569
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,759
You got me.

570
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,136
Let's get the hell outta here.

571
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,747
- What are you trying to do?
- What do you mean?

572
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,783
This!

573
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,283
There's a message here.

574
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,183
Your answer!

575
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,495
Where's Mr. Kim?
What did you do to him?

576
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:15,699
He was the Old Man.
He went back there, and he's waiting.

577
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:19,573
I'm sending you to him
if you don't explain this, right now.

578
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,612
- There's nothing to explain.
- No?

579
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,840
Then why did you write this, huh? Why?

580
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,811
Uh, well, what does it say, Paul?

581
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:32,017
"Cross the yellow line."

582
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,819
Why would you tell me to do that, Carl?

583
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:37,190
Are you trying to kill me?

584
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,126
Answer me, you son of a bitch!

585
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,391
[Perri yells]

586
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,326
- [groans]
- No!

587
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,473
Oh, God. Oh, God.

588
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,308
OK, hold on, Perri.

589
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,349
- [Carl] Just hold on.
- How did you get loose?

590
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,385
Who let you out of the chair?
The Old Man?

591
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:04,512
- The ambulance is coming.
- Get away from her.

592
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,386
- You're gonna be OK.
- That's the Old Man.

593
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:09,255
Shut up! Shut up!

594
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,795
Please, don't let me die.

595
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,558
Carl, please...
Please don't let me die.

596
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,327
What? Are you kidding?

597
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,130
Think I'm gonna let you die
on your birthday? Come on.

598
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,330
You don't know me very well.

599
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:26,910
- Perri.
- Please don't let me die.

600
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,536
Perri, hold on.

601
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,579
Perri.

602
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,819
Perri.

603
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,555
Oh, he is good.

604
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,561
You ought to win an Oscar for that one.
That was genius. Bravo, Old Man.

605
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,466
Don't you get it?
Don't you see what he's trying to do?

606
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,730
That's the Old Man,
pretending to be your friend.

607
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:56,432
Get you to turn on the waterworks.
Get you all emotional.

608
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,805
So you'll do something crazy.

609
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:01,140
Put me over the yellow line!

610
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,849
Because that's where he wants me!

611
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:09,352
Back in that room,
where he's got all the power!

612
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,978
Son of a bitch.

613
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,588
You damn lunatic!

614
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,450
[grunting]

615
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,257
[gunshot]

616
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,161
Is the Old Man doing this?

617
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,327
Huh?

618
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,602
Where's the Old Man now,
you sick bastard?

619
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,505
Huh, is he down the hallway?

620
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:34,271
Or is he in the light switch?

621
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:38,510
I'll tell you what,

622
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,345
- let's go see him.
- No! No!

623
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,683
- Let's go see him together!
- No!

624
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,189
[Krieger screams]

625
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,930
[Perri] Carl.

626
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,100
Perri?

627
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,494
[door opening, creaking]

628
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,949
Paul?

629
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,356
[police radio]

630
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,803
- Hey.
- Hey.

631
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,274
So, uh, I missed your birthday.

632
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,375
I think I understand.

633
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,426
The Detective said
you thought you saw me here tonight?

634
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,119
Yeah, I did.

635
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:13,197
He kept telling me
I sent him messages in my stories.

636
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,106
That I had his answer.

637
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,403
And he was right, I did.

638
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,973
But it didn't come from me.

639
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,380
If it didn't come from you, Carl...

640
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,284
where did it come from?

641
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,406
[Perri] If you look
into the darkness long enough

642
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:58,914
your eyes adjust.

643
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:03,148
And you start to see...

644
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,347
that there are evils in the dark.

645
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,649
But in seeing...

646
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,560
you learn a terrible truth.

647
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,258
That you have not
found these evils at all...

648
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,525
but rather...

649
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,300
they have found you.
