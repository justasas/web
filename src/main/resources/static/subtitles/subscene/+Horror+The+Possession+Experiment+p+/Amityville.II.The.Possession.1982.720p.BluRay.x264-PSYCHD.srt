1
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,887
- Close your eyes.
- They're closed.

2
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,223
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

3
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,416
Okay, open them now.

4
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:10,055
Look at it! It's great!

5
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,869
Hey, what do you think, Montelli?

6
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,906
- Daddy, look at the lake!
- Come on, Mark, let's go to the lake!

7
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,969
Come on, Mark. Let's go!

8
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:34,281
- Look, a motorboat!
- It's so nice. I love it!

9
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,490
- Hey, kids!
- Look at it.

10
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:45,799
That's dangerous. I don't want to see you
near the edge. You understand?

11
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,163
- Yeah.
- What?

12
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,602
Yes, sir!

13
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,412
Look at it!

14
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,917
It's ours!

15
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,819
<i>Be it ever so</i>

16
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,987
Wait. One, two, three.

17
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:12,792
<i>Be it ever so humble</i>

18
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,528
<i>There's no place like home</i>

19
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,030
What's this? The Andrews Sisters?

20
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,198
- Hi, Daddy.
- Where's Sonny?

21
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,533
He's right behind us.
He should be here any minute.

22
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,503
- I thought I told you to stay together.
- Home sweet home.

23
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,367
- Daddy's such a creep.
- Be respectful.

24
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,422
Hey, Dad. The new car is fantastic.

25
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,326
You should have seen it at the red light.
A guy was stepping on the accelerator.

26
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:50,396
So I put the pedal to the metal.
You should've seen it. It was fantastic!

27
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,398
- I left the guy...
- Where the hell were you?

28
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,625
I told you to back up your mother.

29
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,035
She knows the way.

30
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,400
Don't be smart, boy.
You're not too big for a whipping.

31
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,011
- I know, you proved that to me.
- You're pushing it. You're right on the edge.

32
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,815
- I just stopped at the corner for cigarettes.
- Stop your whining.

33
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,017
You're gonna be a man
by smoking cigarettes?

34
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,319
Now you're growing
a little fuzz over here?

35
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,718
Learn how to take some orders.
You hear me?

36
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,123
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,592
I'm so excited.

38
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,535
- Tricia, look at the fireplace.
- Look at that staircase!

39
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,412
These windows are stuck.

40
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,622
They're nailed.

41
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,247
Wow! This is a mansion.

42
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,653
What's going on?
What's this? Peggy Fleming?

43
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,555
The first and last time you skate in here.

44
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,391
I wonder what idiot
nailed all these windows shut.

45
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,928
God damn it! They nailed
every window upstairs the same way.

46
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,029
Oh, no.

47
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:06,332
I have a good mind
to call that asshole real estate guy.

48
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,900
It's here!

49
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,650
Hello.

50
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,897
What do you think you're doing?

51
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,633
I'm going to introduce you
to your new room.

52
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,634
If you don't watch, I'm gonna fall on you.

53
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,864
- No nails here. Over.
- Isn't it great?

54
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,902
- It's all right.
- I love it.

55
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,248
- You're getting heavy.
- You used to hug me all the time.

56
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,616
That was when you were lighter.

57
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,919
- It's 'cause now you're old and snotty.
- There is another reason.

58
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,044
- What?
- You're not my type.

59
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:07,185
- You like them tall? Big boobs, right?
- That is none of your business.

60
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,329
How about you? What's your type?

61
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,166
I like them sensitive, dark,
and about this high.

62
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,259
- You're ridiculous.
- No. Come on, let's get to know the house.

63
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,875
- Can you feel it?
- Yeah.

64
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,752
I was wondering
if there was a girl here before, like me.

65
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,013
And she was in love with a boy.

66
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,745
- Yeah.
- But she was unhappy.

67
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,883
- Unhappy?
- The boy didn't love her.

68
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,595
- Why?
- Because she was ugly, like you.

69
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,091
You stupid!

70
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,907
Just put that down over there.

71
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,110
- Anywhere?
- They're my husband's guns.

72
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,770
You better put them in the closet.

73
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,392
Hey, lady.
Looks like you got another room in here.

74
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,600
The realtor didn't tell us about that.

75
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,602
- Want me to check it out for you?
- Would you?

76
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,294
- Sure.
- Great.

77
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,971
Here's a light over here.

78
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,072
- This is a really good one.
- All right, thank you.

79
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:46,719
You got a problem in here, lady.
Must be a busted sewer line or something.

80
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,384
Oh, my.

81
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,666
Lady, it stinks in here.

82
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,724
Hey, are you all right?
Come on out of there.

83
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,797
Oh, my goodness!

84
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,166
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

85
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,703
- What happened? What's that on your shirt?
- Shit. Excuse me, ma'am.

86
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,906
There's a lot of flies, a lot of mud,
a lot of everything in there.

87
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:37,343
- If I was you, I'd stay out of there.
- I'm sorry I had you go in there.

88
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:40,313
Take this towel
and go upstairs and wash up.

89
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,315
- There's soap and stuff upstairs.
- Thank you.

90
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,280
Watch out for your head.

91
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,445
Ma, did I scare you?

92
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:37,752
Somebody... touched me.

93
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:41,955
What?

94
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:46,202
- Somebody touched me.
- Who touched you?

95
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,703
Somebody.

96
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:49,866
Here.

97
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,411
Now.

98
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,947
You mean,
you actually felt somebody's hand?

99
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,984
It felt like fingers on my arm.

100
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,951
Mom, it must be your imagination.

101
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,296
You put the fork here, stupid.

102
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,531
- Shut up!
- Don't tell me to shut up.

103
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,200
Come on, children. That's enough.

104
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,895
Sit down, everybody.
Anthony, did you wash your hands?

105
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,134
What do you think?

106
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,204
I think we're a very lucky family.

107
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,047
Now let's eat. Come on, it's getting cold.

108
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:38,223
- Pass me the string beans.
- Pass the spaghetti.

109
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,853
Haven't we forgotten something?

110
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,460
Heavenly Father, bless our new home...

111
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:53,439
and watch over us as we become
a part of this community.

112
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:57,942
We thank thee for this food, bless it
to the nourishment of our bodies.

113
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:02,982
God damn it!

114
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,885
Don't even look at me!
I didn't put that mirror up there.

115
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:06,952
No, Daddy!

116
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:09,816
- Why does he always blame me...
- Stop it!

117
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,920
Can't we just eat our first meal
in this house without fighting?

118
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,802
All everybody's been doing
ever since we got here, is fighting!

119
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,870
All right, I've had enough of it with you.

120
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,495
I don't want to hear any more of it!

121
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,502
Look, it's not even broken.

122
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,445
All right, let's continue.

123
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,355
Bless this food
for the nourishment of our body.

124
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:47,118
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

125
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,231
- Good night, Trish.
- Good night, Sonny.

126
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,317
There had better be a good...

127
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,193
Come on back to bed, honey.

128
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,019
Okay, I see you there.

129
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,528
There's a 12-gauge shotgun waiting
for anybody trespassing.

130
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,778
Anthony, somebody is here.

131
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,583
Don't move.

132
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,105
What happened?

133
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,930
Brushes.

134
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,740
Brushes?

135
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,562
Anthony, you can't do
that to the kids. No.

136
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,832
But, Daddy, it was the brushes!
We didn't do it!

137
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:30,936
- You think that's funny?
- He can't even write!

138
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,238
- What about her?
- Don't you touch her!

139
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,307
- Get out of my way!
- You leave her alone!

140
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,981
I'll kill you, you...

141
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,426
Where's your sister?
You had something to do with this?

142
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,925
No!

143
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,495
- You stop it!
- You think that's funny?

144
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:06,030
- You're a big man. Don't you hit them!
- Daddy, no!

145
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,566
No, Daddy, don't!

146
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,612
Mommy!

147
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:51,210
Oh, my God! What's happening to us?

148
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,272
<i>Why didn't you pull that trigger?</i>

149
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:31,414
<i>Why didn't you shoot that pig?</i>

150
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:38,230
"We believe in one God,
the Father, the Almighty...

151
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,232
"maker of heaven and earth,
of all things seen and unseen.

152
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,637
"We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ...

00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:49,775

158
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:09,628
I'm Delores Montelli,
and I have four children.

159
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:13,065
- That's splendid. Welcome, Mrs. Montelli.
- Thank you.

160
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,962
And Mr. Montelli?

161
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:19,360
My husband is a good man, Father,
but he's not a big churchgoer.

162
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:23,208
I was wondering if you could come
to our house and bless it.

163
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,173
- Certainly, I'd be delighted.
- Thank you.

164
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,952
Mr. Montelli, I presume?
I'm Father Adamsky.

165
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,087
Your wife asked me to stop by.

166
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,669
May I come in?

167
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,538
Oh, Father. You came.

168
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,641
- Mrs. Montelli.
- I'm so glad.

169
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,709
- Have you met my husband?
- Yes, we just met.

170
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:58,935
Good.

171
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:03,680
Father, please come into our living room.
Children, take your coats off.

172
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:07,386
Children, this is the man
you saw in church this afternoon.

173
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,656
This is Father Adamsky.
Father, these are our two youngest children.

174
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,191
- This is Mark.
- Mark, it's good to meet you.

175
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,927
- And this is Jan. Honey.
- Jan, pleasure to meet you.

176
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,497
Just put your things down here, Father.

177
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,725
Honey, would you please go get
Tricia and Sonny?

178
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,431
Give us a minute.

179
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,529
Excuse me.

180
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,780
What the hell is the matter with you?

181
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,576
I don't go to church
and you bring it here?

182
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,980
Yes. He's going to bless our house.

183
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,578
- Sonny.
- Hey! What?

184
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,351
Anthony, please.

185
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:53,595
Please go inside,
please be nice to him, for me. Please.

186
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:01,039
There's somebody someplace around here,
but we can't find him.

187
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,375
- You can't find him?
- What's that?

188
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,103
This is a surplice.

189
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,818
- I'll bet you know what this is.
- I've seen it, but I don't know the name.

190
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,579
It's a stole.

191
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,023
- Want a smoke, priest?
- No, thank you.

192
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,329
- You mind if I do?
- Not at all.

193
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,430
- Jan.
- Yes, sir?

194
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,595
See if...

195
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,203
the priest wants a drink of something.

196
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,415
A glass of water would be very nice.

197
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,881
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it!

198
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,849
You're dead!

199
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,495
- You're dead!
- You're scaring me! I can't breathe!

200
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,063
It's like a movie.

201
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,688
- You're scaring me.
- Don't worry, it's okay.

202
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,461
Here, you can give the glass.

203
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,226
I love you.

204
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,901
Father, this is my firstborn, Sonny.

205
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,033
He hasn't been feeling well lately.

206
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:17,273
Good to meet you, Sonny.

207
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,463
Jesus Christ!

208
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,299
What do you kids think this house is?
A playground?

209
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,391
- We didn't do it!
- Don't you lie to me!

210
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:42,607
- Please, don't hit the child.
- Mister, this isn't your business.

211
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,842
Do you hear that?

212
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:48,038
I raise my children the way I see fit.
Now you do what you got to do and go.

213
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:57,286
- You think that's funny?
- We didn't do it!

214
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:04,129
Father, please forgive my husband.
Please, Father.

215
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,566
I think there will be a better time
for this, Mrs. Montelli.

216
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,658
Yes, of course, Father. I'm so sorry.

217
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,541
It's not your fault. Perhaps one day
your husband and I can meet as friends.

218
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,541
Of course, Father.

219
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:29,848
We are going to get into the car,
and we're going to go to the church.

220
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,941
And you are going to apologize to the priest
in front of your children.

221
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:39,150
- Or else...
- Or else what?

222
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:45,196
Or else I am going to walk out
of this house tonight...

223
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,457
and I am not going to come back.

224
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,465
Jesus Christ, Delores.

225
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,346
Hey, snotty. You coming to church?

226
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,934
Hurry up. Come on, hurry up.

227
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:42,080
- Where's Sonny?
- He's upstairs. He said he isn't feeling well.

228
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,582
Is that you?

229
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,623
Who's there?

230
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,308
Patricia?

231
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:49,712
Jan?

232
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,455
Who's there?

233
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,584
I've got a gun out here.

234
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:34,518
Come on out.

235
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,597
Oh, my God!

236
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,831
No!

237
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,555
- I thought you were asleep.
- I was.

238
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,936
- When did you get back from church?
- Hours ago.

239
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:01,937
What happened downstairs?
All the windows were open.

240
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,710
I don't know. Something. I don't remember.

241
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,215
You look terrible. Are you okay?

242
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,912
Yeah, I feel all right.

243
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,592
You should see a doctor.

244
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,058
You've got dark rings around your eyes.

245
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,221
- What happened at church?
- It was unbelievable.

246
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:32,068
Daddy made his apologies,
but then he took us out for a steak dinner.

247
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:37,337
He tried to get Mommy drunk,
but she wouldn't go for it.

248
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,506
You know...

249
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,869
there's something strange.

250
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,677
I think Mommy doesn't want to make love
to Daddy anymore.

251
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,912
I think he tries to force her.

252
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,650
I heard her crying.

253
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,627
Why are you looking at me like that?

254
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,033
Because you're beautiful.

255
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,597
I'm beautiful?

256
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,667
- Hey, come on. Stop teasing me.
- No, I mean it.

257
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,704
Sit on the bed.

258
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:20,709
Come on. Strike a pose for me on the bed.

259
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,493
We're gonna play a game...

260
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,828
where you are the beautiful model
and I am the famous photographer.

261
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,464
Pose for me.

262
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,604
You know, Trish...

263
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:57,447
I think that you are probably
the most beautiful girl in the world.

264
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:00,623
Probably? You're not sure?

265
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:06,060
I'm sure.

266
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,136
- Take off your nightgown.
- What?

267
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,900
Just for a second.

268
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,503
Okay. Just for a second.

269
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,276
There.

270
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:42,459
I think now I can say you are
the most beautiful girl in the world.

271
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,028
Put your hair up.

272
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,201
Now I put my hair up?

273
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,278
You have a beautiful neck.

274
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,947
- Enough.
- No.

275
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,996
- I have a secret I want to tell you.
- What?

276
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:30,937
They're mine.

277
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,547
- My panties.
- I took them from the laundry.

278
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:45,089
But why?

279
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,570
- It is a big sin.
- Don't be afraid.

280
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,842
I went all the way...

281
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,017
with my friend.

282
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:20,096
You must resist this temptation.

283
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:26,935
One day perhaps you'll meet someone,
marry, raise a family.

284
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,142
Even if you love him very much,
you must resist...

285
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,233
We do not love each other.

286
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,348
You don't love each other?

287
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:41,009
Then this is only a sexual matter?

288
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:47,348
He does it just to hurt.

289
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,657
Well, to hurt who?

290
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,192
Hurt you?

291
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,832
To hurt God.

292
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,241
My child, you shouldn't say that.

293
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,548
Now, tell me everything,
from the beginning.

294
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,240
No!

295
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:29,533
I try and pray at home...

296
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,830
<i>He's here. Stay away from him.</i>

297
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:37,406
- ...but the words won't come.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

298
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,000
That's all right.

299
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:48,218
You're here now, and you'll bless the house,
and everything will be all right.

300
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,843
- Won't it?
- Of course.

301
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:55,316
"Sprinkle me with hyssop, O Lord,
and I shall be clean.

302
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:02,089
"Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow."

303
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,650
Upstairs, too, Father.

304
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,186
"Be merciful to me, my God,
for great is thy goodness."

305
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,787
Glory be to the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

306
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,983
You're not coming with me?

307
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,796
My son is upstairs...

308
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,956
and he hasn't been happy to see us lately.

309
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,229
I don't want to disturb him.

310
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:44,132
- You must go, Father. Please.
- It's all right.

311
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:58,116
"Hear us, holy Lord, Almighty Father,
eternal God...

312
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,426
"and deign to send us thy holy angel
from heaven...

313
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:06,196
"to guard, cherish, protect,
visit, and defend...

314
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:08,696
"all who dwell in this house."

315
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,432
Hello, Sonny.

316
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:43,163
"Sprinkle me with hyssop, O Lord,
and make me clean."

317
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,866
Why are you hiding?

318
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,338
I'm not.

319
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:58,977
I just don't want to talk to anyone.
This is my room. I want to be alone.

320
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,517
Your mother asked me to come.

321
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,080
So bless my mother's room.

322
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,193
- Would you like to be alone?
- Yes.

323
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,867
Is there anything I can do for you?

324
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,565
- Yes.
- You want me to leave?

325
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,039
- Sorry.
- It's all right. Maybe we can talk sometime.

326
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,941
It's nice territory.

327
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,059
My bedroom, Father.

328
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,603
My bed, too.

329
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:06,838
No!

330
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:53,897
Here's the sprinkler.

331
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:56,898
- From which the blood emerged?
- That is correct.

332
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,668
Well, what do you want of me?

333
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:03,507
I may need approval for an exorcism.

334
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,510
- An exorcism?
- After what happened in the house...

335
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,134
Wait a minute.

336
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,212
Do you believe in ghosts, Frank?

337
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,808
I saw a ghost once.

338
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,919
Or, at least, what appeared to be a ghost.

339
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,123
Although I thought I saw a ghost...

340
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,321
there may have been another explanation.

341
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,186
Likewise, in the matter at hand...

342
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,962
we must start with you.

343
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,598
Make sure you're seeing
what you think you are.

344
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:39,243
The worst thing in this whole area,
and you know this, Father...

345
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,345
is to rush into anything.

346
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:44,471
- Frankly, I don't think we have time.
- Father...

347
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,741
I will be touch in with you.

348
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,146
We will take our time.

349
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:18,608
"For we wrestle not
against the flesh or the blood..."

350
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,109
Hi.

351
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,626
Well, come on in. How are you?

352
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,059
I'm fine.

353
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,500
You're fine?

354
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:47,108
I think we should discuss your behavior
at confession.

355
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,643
I'm sorry about that, Father.

356
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,284
I apologize.

357
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,087
- I'll try again next week.
- Good.

358
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,925
- How's your mother?
- She's okay.

359
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:15,898
By the way, we're having a birthday party
for my brother Sonny this afternoon.

360
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:19,436
Can you come? Please?

361
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:25,709
I have to work on my sermon for Sunday.

362
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:28,348
I'm sorry.

363
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:31,786
Thank you for asking me, though.

364
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,589
Maybe I could stop by
on Monday or Tuesday.

365
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,925
You'll feel better when you confess.

366
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:59,047
Just a minute. Hello.

367
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:05,116
I'm terribly sorry.

368
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:09,991
- Father, I have to talk to you about Sonny.
- 327 Clay. I'll be there right away.

369
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:14,627
That's too bad. Mr. Conner had a stroke.

370
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,623
Hi.

371
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:22,973
- Did you see a young girl in the hallway?
- She was in a big hurry, too.

372
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,200
She almost knocked me down.

373
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:27,867
Camping, anyone?

374
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:33,517
- One of my parishioners is dying.
- Sorry to hear that.

375
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,318
- Here, let me help.
- I'll be right back.

376
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,409
Okay. I'll be here.

377
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:42,426
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

378
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:46,263
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

379
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:50,732
<i>Happy birthday dear Sonny</i>

380
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:54,704
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

381
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:58,262
<i>Happy Birthday to you</i>

382
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:01,545
<i>You live in a zoo</i>

383
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:04,347
<i>You smell like a monkey</i>

384
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:07,250
<i>And you look like one, too!</i>

385
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,443
Come on, let's cut that cake!

386
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,879
- Oh, my God. Look at this.
- Make a wish and blow out the candle.

387
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,757
Make a wish?

388
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:29,003
- It's magic!
- It's magic?

389
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,509
Did you do that, monkey-face?

390
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:35,579
You trying to make a fool
of your big brother?

391
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,078
You rascal.

392
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,912
Or was it you?

393
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,350
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

394
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,118
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

395
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,066
- I love you, Ma.
- Oh, son.

396
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:15,707
Happy birthday.

397
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:18,986
Thank you.

398
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,347
It's very nice.

399
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:14,010
<i>Look at them, they're pathetic animals.</i>

400
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,874
<i>They'd be better off if you killed them.</i>

401
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,644
<i>Don't you think so?</i>

402
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:24,080
<i>Yes, you think so.</i>

403
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,490
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi!

404
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,783
- Hi, Danielle.
- Hi. Hello.

405
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,427
Hi, Sonny.

406
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,002
- Happy birthday, Sonny.
- Thank you.

407
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,662
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you very much.

408
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,106
Happy birthday, Sonny.

409
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:51,280
Happy birthday.

410
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,431
Anthony, let me get you and Jody together.

411
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,800
Hurry up, honey.
They're waiting for you down there.

412
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,767
- Wait. I missed it.
- Come on, I'm busy.

413
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,733
Everybody hungry?

414
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,909
You're gross!

415
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,055
That's wonderful.

416
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,125
So? I'm ready.

417
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,997
I ran out of film.
I have to go get some more film.

418
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:12,421
Sonny, I'm here.

419
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,192
So what?

420
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,796
I thought you were calling me.

421
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,102
I changed my mind.

422
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:30,638
What's the matter with you?

423
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,281
Are you feeling guilty?

424
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:40,148
- I'm not.
- Stop it!

425
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,963
You act like you hate me sometimes.

426
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:53,636
I'm confused. Please talk to me...

427
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,966
Go away, damn bitch!

428
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:09,284
Don't you ever talk to me again!

429
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:11,581
Don't you touch me!

430
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:36,709
<i>I'm sorry, the number you've...</i>

431
00:59:00,434 --> 00:59:02,664
Please, Father, answer me.

432
00:59:04,171 --> 00:59:08,005
Answer me! Father, I know you're there.

433
00:59:08,976 --> 00:59:11,706
- I don't want to answer it.
- Good idea.

434
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:17,941
<i>Hello?</i>

435
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,154
Now let's hit the trail.

436
00:59:20,254 --> 00:59:22,484
Come on, let's go.

437
00:59:34,368 --> 00:59:37,098
I was just going to get some ice cubes.

438
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:44,468
- What have you done with your brother?
- Me?

439
00:59:45,746 --> 00:59:48,613
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

440
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:50,810
Mom!

441
00:59:52,419 --> 00:59:54,979
Do you understand what you've done?

442
01:00:27,254 --> 01:00:28,448
No.

443
01:00:30,624 --> 01:00:32,023
No!

444
01:00:35,629 --> 01:00:38,265
<i>You must do it.</i>

445
01:00:38,365 --> 01:00:40,765
<i>You must do it now.</i>

446
01:01:33,654 --> 01:01:36,790
- Come on, spit it out. What's on your mind?
- I don't...

447
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:40,986
- You don't want to do it anymore?
- Just let's...

448
01:01:44,565 --> 01:01:46,934
- Come on, answer!
- It's a shame.

449
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:49,436
- What's a shame?
- Everything.

450
01:01:49,536 --> 01:01:51,138
Are you nuts?

451
01:01:51,238 --> 01:01:53,240
Our family is shameful.
Don't you understand?

452
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:56,070
What's it got to do with our family?

453
01:03:00,107 --> 01:03:01,597
Mommy!

454
01:03:15,222 --> 01:03:16,917
Mommy!

455
01:04:51,752 --> 01:04:54,243
Mark, hide.

456
01:04:57,224 --> 01:04:58,521
Hide.

457
01:05:56,249 --> 01:05:57,773
No!

458
01:06:01,054 --> 01:06:04,512
What are you doing? No, please.

459
01:06:07,327 --> 01:06:09,022
What are you doing?

460
01:06:11,698 --> 01:06:14,792
Please don't. No.

461
01:06:18,972 --> 01:06:20,803
Don't!

462
01:06:23,176 --> 01:06:25,872
Frank, wake up, you're having a dream.

463
01:06:26,413 --> 01:06:28,438
You're having a dream.

464
01:06:31,852 --> 01:06:33,911
Frank, what are you doing?

465
01:06:36,423 --> 01:06:39,415
Frank, wait a minute. You're still asleep.

466
01:06:41,061 --> 01:06:42,961
Frank, hold on a minute!

467
01:06:43,897 --> 01:06:46,366
- Would you tell me where we're going?
- Amityville.

468
01:06:46,466 --> 01:06:49,836
- Why?
- Something horrible has happened.

469
01:06:49,936 --> 01:06:51,972
Frank, you had a dream.

470
01:06:52,072 --> 01:06:55,309
It might have had a powerful effect
on you, but it was just a dream.

471
01:06:55,409 --> 01:06:57,400
I pray to God you're right.

472
01:07:28,942 --> 01:07:31,638
Hi. I'm their priest. He's with me.

473
01:07:33,213 --> 01:07:36,917
- Hold it, gentlemen.
- Okay, let them in. He was their priest.

474
01:07:37,017 --> 01:07:38,484
Okay, Father.

475
01:08:06,813 --> 01:08:09,611
- Who are they?
- Two parents and their kids.

476
01:08:15,722 --> 01:08:17,952
- I'm a priest.
- It's okay.

477
01:09:03,336 --> 01:09:06,305
Okay, you guys can take off.
You're too late.

478
01:09:09,142 --> 01:09:13,010
Father, please. Don't touch those things.

479
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,309
It's a crime scene.

480
01:09:17,284 --> 01:09:21,448
- Everything's going to be all right.
- Take it easy, kid.

481
01:09:26,493 --> 01:09:28,324
I don't remember.

482
01:09:33,867 --> 01:09:36,961
Let's get him out of here
and calm him down.

483
01:09:37,103 --> 01:09:38,570
Okay, Chief.

484
01:09:56,323 --> 01:09:59,918
- Lieutenant.
- He hasn't said a word. He's still in shock.

485
01:10:01,895 --> 01:10:04,264
- What about the doctor?
- He's on his way.

486
01:10:04,364 --> 01:10:05,956
May I go in now?

487
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:10,394
Turner, take the Father in to see the boy.

488
01:10:48,508 --> 01:10:50,442
Did you kill them, Sonny?

489
01:11:15,835 --> 01:11:17,496
Who is inside you?

490
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:30,375
In the name of the Father, and the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

491
01:11:33,086 --> 01:11:37,853
It was Patricia on the phone that night.
She was trying to reach me.

492
01:12:05,819 --> 01:12:07,411
I'm responsible.

493
01:12:27,107 --> 01:12:29,166
You loved them, didn't you?

494
01:12:30,977 --> 01:12:32,877
Do you hear me, Sonny?

495
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:39,145
Help me to help you.

496
01:12:50,296 --> 01:12:52,389
"The Lord is my shepherd...

497
01:12:55,668 --> 01:12:57,295
"I shall not want.

498
01:13:06,446 --> 01:13:09,415
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures...

499
01:13:11,684 --> 01:13:14,380
"he leadeth me beside the still waters.

500
01:13:18,391 --> 01:13:20,416
"He restoreth my soul...

501
01:13:26,966 --> 01:13:28,934
"he leadeth me..."

502
01:13:30,136 --> 01:13:31,933
No!

503
01:13:51,624 --> 01:13:54,058
- Did he hurt you, Father?
- No.

504
01:13:55,361 --> 01:13:57,454
Anyway, it's not his fault.

505
01:13:58,231 --> 01:14:00,256
What do you mean, Father?

506
01:14:02,135 --> 01:14:03,864
He can't help it.

507
01:14:05,738 --> 01:14:09,230
He is dominated by another force.

508
01:14:13,046 --> 01:14:14,411
What force?

509
01:14:16,382 --> 01:14:18,179
The boy is possessed.

510
01:14:20,253 --> 01:14:22,414
I saw one once in Puerto Rico.

511
01:14:23,656 --> 01:14:26,591
He was shouting and kicking.

512
01:14:42,141 --> 01:14:43,733
Show yourself...

513
01:14:45,245 --> 01:14:47,179
unclean spirit.

514
01:14:50,383 --> 01:14:52,146
Kiss the crucifix...

515
01:14:52,952 --> 01:14:55,477
and beg the Almighty for forgiveness.

516
01:15:16,209 --> 01:15:19,303
I must take him to church.
This is impossible.

517
01:15:20,546 --> 01:15:22,639
In church, I could succeed.

518
01:15:24,984 --> 01:15:27,452
Please understand. Help me.

519
01:15:32,225 --> 01:15:35,661
- Are you asking me to let him go?
- It's the only way.

520
01:15:52,979 --> 01:15:57,211
No, Father, you've got three more minutes
to talk to the boy. That's all.

521
01:15:58,885 --> 01:16:00,113
Officer.

522
01:16:24,577 --> 01:16:27,205
I told you, you'd have to leave.

523
01:16:27,981 --> 01:16:31,747
- You want to destroy this boy's life?
- I do what I want.

524
01:16:32,285 --> 01:16:36,745
You must leave this boy's body
which your foul presence occupies.

525
01:16:38,558 --> 01:16:41,083
Why should I leave? I like it here.

526
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:45,421
- I will cast you out.
- Oh? How?

527
01:16:46,499 --> 01:16:48,433
With an exorcism.

528
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:53,705
You can't do that. You're not authorized.

529
01:16:54,007 --> 01:16:57,067
- How do you know?
- We know everything.

530
01:16:59,445 --> 01:17:03,347
Is it your intention
not to show yourself again?

531
01:17:04,283 --> 01:17:05,682
I could.

532
01:17:06,619 --> 01:17:07,779
When?

533
01:17:08,287 --> 01:17:10,118
When I please.

534
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:38,741
Father, what are you doing here?

535
01:18:40,446 --> 01:18:42,243
Are you all right?

536
01:18:42,582 --> 01:18:44,573
Can I give you a lift?

537
01:18:52,892 --> 01:18:54,826
Yes. Thank you.

538
01:18:56,462 --> 01:18:59,659
I know some strange stories
about that house.

539
01:19:07,607 --> 01:19:10,610
I've been working here for 25 years.

540
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:13,201
- Here, let me help you.
- Thank you.

541
01:19:15,081 --> 01:19:17,982
At first, I thought
it would be very boring.

542
01:19:18,417 --> 01:19:22,751
But these records are more interesting
than any novel.

543
01:19:24,857 --> 01:19:27,760
A woman expelled
from Salem for witchcraft...

544
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:32,263
violated the Indians' laws against
building on an ancient burial ground.

545
01:19:33,933 --> 01:19:36,302
Since then, it's been desecrated...

546
01:19:36,402 --> 01:19:39,633
by people who have no right to live there.

547
01:20:03,062 --> 01:20:05,257
- Hello.
- <i>Hello.</i>

548
01:20:06,365 --> 01:20:10,358
- Who is this?
- <i>Father Adamsky?</i>

549
01:20:16,275 --> 01:20:17,742
<i>Father?</i>

550
01:20:19,478 --> 01:20:20,843
<i>I'm worried.</i>

551
01:20:22,315 --> 01:20:24,306
<i>I'm worried about Sonny.</i>

552
01:20:25,685 --> 01:20:27,243
<i>Afraid of him.</i>

553
01:20:29,789 --> 01:20:34,453
<i>I don't know why,
but I think he wants to kill us.</i>

554
01:20:49,642 --> 01:20:52,078
Your Honor, it is my intention
to prove at the trial...

555
01:20:52,178 --> 01:20:54,914
that Sonny is a victim
of demonic possession, and therefore...

556
01:20:55,014 --> 01:20:56,743
Of what, Mr. Booth?

557
01:20:58,284 --> 01:21:01,685
Demonic possession, Your Honor.
Possession by demons.

558
01:21:03,022 --> 01:21:05,691
And therefore innocent
of the charges placed against him.

559
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:07,760
Your Honor, this is highly irregular.

560
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:10,420
Will counsel please approach the bench?

561
01:21:13,899 --> 01:21:16,035
Your Honor, there is no precedent...

562
01:21:16,135 --> 01:21:19,502
Mr. Booth, I admire your originality.

563
01:21:19,972 --> 01:21:24,677
If I accept your plea, regardless of verdict,
every courtroom in this country...

564
01:21:24,777 --> 01:21:27,712
would be inundated
with pleas of possession.

565
01:21:28,281 --> 01:21:32,118
Nobody will be guilty of anything.
"The devil made him do it."

566
01:21:32,218 --> 01:21:35,984
No, Mr. Booth. I cannot accept your plea.

567
01:21:36,722 --> 01:21:39,213
You have three days to submit another.

568
01:22:15,928 --> 01:22:19,989
Father Adamsky, the Chancellor
would like to have a word with you.

569
01:22:31,944 --> 01:22:33,379
Monsignor, it's good to see you.

570
01:22:33,479 --> 01:22:36,482
I've more to tell you about the Montelli
case. Won't you come in?

571
01:22:36,582 --> 01:22:39,619
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.
But I want to talk to you.

572
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:43,022
Who gave you permission to let
the people in a court of law believe...

573
01:22:43,122 --> 01:22:46,489
that the church was preparing to perform
an exorcism?

574
01:22:46,692 --> 01:22:50,263
- You told me.
- I told you I was going to talk to the Bishop.

575
01:22:50,363 --> 01:22:54,459
But you anticipated his decision
and put the church in a bad light.

576
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:57,203
Now, the Bishop is very worried about you.

577
01:22:57,303 --> 01:22:59,505
He would like you to take
a leave of absence.

578
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:02,441
- A leave of absence now?
- You are not listening to me!

579
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:04,844
I am listening to my own conscience!

580
01:23:04,944 --> 01:23:09,815
The facts, the sprinkler,
the diabolical influence in that house...

581
01:23:09,915 --> 01:23:11,644
You didn't listen!

582
01:23:17,123 --> 01:23:21,219
Now I understand why all the parishioners
are complaining about him.

583
01:23:22,595 --> 01:23:24,256
He's coming back.

584
01:23:24,997 --> 01:23:29,568
I ask one thing: The authority
to perform an exorcism on Sonny Montelli.

585
01:23:29,668 --> 01:23:33,973
The Bishop does not think
you are qualified, nor, above all...

586
01:23:34,073 --> 01:23:38,976
- have the correct steadiness of character.
- Too much prudence could be cowardice.

587
01:23:39,378 --> 01:23:43,382
You are not only forgetting obedience,
you're forgetting humility, as well.

588
01:23:43,482 --> 01:23:46,319
- Let me talk to the Bishop.
- The Bishop wants to talk to you.

589
01:23:46,419 --> 01:23:50,456
But we'll tell you when.
Now, you are to go home and remain there.

590
01:23:50,556 --> 01:23:54,193
Do not do anything on your own initiative,
and wait for our call.

591
01:23:54,293 --> 01:23:57,057
God be with you, Father. Let's go, please.

592
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:05,771
How's the boy?

593
01:24:05,871 --> 01:24:08,274
They're gonna try electroshock therapy
again tomorrow.

594
01:24:08,374 --> 01:24:12,078
- That's just torturing him.
- I'm sorry, Father. He's probably insane.

595
01:24:12,178 --> 01:24:15,875
That's why I suggested we plead insanity
in the first place.

596
01:24:20,586 --> 01:24:21,951
Let him in.

597
01:24:26,792 --> 01:24:28,521
He won't eat anything.

598
01:24:43,442 --> 01:24:45,069
He's dying.

599
01:24:53,118 --> 01:24:56,576
Are you crazy?
They're taking the best care of him here.

600
01:25:16,442 --> 01:25:18,535
I should call the doctor.

601
01:25:21,213 --> 01:25:25,377
You understand, the only way we can
save him is by taking him out of here.

602
01:25:25,484 --> 01:25:29,318
- Look, let me get the doctor.
- That's pointless, and you know it.

603
01:25:29,989 --> 01:25:32,116
Now, you're a good man.

604
01:25:38,697 --> 01:25:40,927
Don't ask this of me, Father.

605
01:25:42,268 --> 01:25:46,398
- I could lose my job. I could go to jail.
- You want to let him die?

606
01:26:27,079 --> 01:26:28,341
Father...

607
01:26:29,281 --> 01:26:32,273
this is the key to the door of this ward.

608
01:26:33,052 --> 01:26:37,614
When you get to the unlocked door,
turn left. You'll find the fire escape.

609
01:26:43,228 --> 01:26:44,820
Take it, Father.

610
01:26:54,173 --> 01:26:55,936
The butt, right here.

611
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:07,444
Go on, Father, hit me,
before I change my mind.

612
01:27:16,695 --> 01:27:18,060
Forgive me.

613
01:28:23,128 --> 01:28:24,425
No!

614
01:29:22,654 --> 01:29:24,323
- Yes, sir.
- Excuse me.

615
01:29:24,423 --> 01:29:27,449
Yeah, that crazy priest
pulled him out of here.

616
01:29:28,227 --> 01:29:29,956
We know he's gone.

617
01:29:31,296 --> 01:29:33,321
We got an APB out on him.

618
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:36,801
Yeah, Turner's fine. Okay, bye-bye.

619
01:31:34,186 --> 01:31:35,517
Dear God...

620
01:31:36,521 --> 01:31:38,716
let your powerful strength...

621
01:31:39,992 --> 01:31:44,622
force the serpent to release
your servant...

622
01:31:46,431 --> 01:31:48,167
so it no longer possesses him...

623
01:31:48,267 --> 01:31:51,634
whom you deign to make in your own image.

624
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:45,781
If you can hear me, pray, my son!

625
01:32:47,859 --> 01:32:49,224
Pray!

626
01:32:53,098 --> 01:32:55,566
Fight the evil inside you!

627
01:33:17,456 --> 01:33:20,050
"He who commands you...

628
01:33:20,625 --> 01:33:23,762
"is he who ordered you
to be thrown down...

629
01:33:23,862 --> 01:33:28,356
"from the highest Heaven
into the depths of Hell.

630
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:34,534
"He who commands you...

631
01:33:36,575 --> 01:33:39,444
"is he who dominated the sea...

632
01:33:39,544 --> 01:33:42,012
"and the winds, and the storms.

633
01:33:46,752 --> 01:33:48,151
"Fear...

634
01:33:50,322 --> 01:33:53,189
"him who was crucified as a man...

635
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,351
"and who rose from death."

636
01:34:59,357 --> 01:35:02,627
Most unchaste spirit,
in the name of our Almighty Lord...

637
01:35:02,727 --> 01:35:05,321
I command you to tell me who you are.

638
01:35:06,164 --> 01:35:07,995
Tell me your name.

639
01:35:09,468 --> 01:35:10,935
Your name.

640
01:35:18,777 --> 01:35:20,369
You know my name.

641
01:35:20,879 --> 01:35:24,280
You know my name very well, Father.

642
01:35:28,787 --> 01:35:31,221
Now you must confess, mustn't you?

643
01:35:33,325 --> 01:35:34,690
Look at me.

644
01:35:37,162 --> 01:35:41,394
When I was making my confession,
you thought about making love to me.

645
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,999
Didn't you?

646
01:35:45,337 --> 01:35:46,395
No.

647
01:35:46,805 --> 01:35:48,204
Look at me!

648
01:35:48,874 --> 01:35:51,672
Confess! Dirty priest.

649
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:53,805
You wanted it.

650
01:35:59,017 --> 01:36:01,420
"Creator of Heaven and Earth.
You are the true king.

651
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:03,155
"Your kingdom is without end.

652
01:36:03,255 --> 01:36:05,991
"Humbly, I supplicate your majesty
and your glory...

653
01:36:06,091 --> 01:36:09,895
"that you deign to free
this your servant...

654
01:36:09,995 --> 01:36:12,463
"from unclean spirits!"

655
01:36:13,465 --> 01:36:18,266
Prince of lies,
return to the depths of darkness!

656
01:36:27,846 --> 01:36:31,145
I like you, Adamsky. I understand you.

657
01:36:32,184 --> 01:36:35,517
You want to dominate,
like your Bishops and more.

658
01:36:36,655 --> 01:36:39,920
- I can give it to you, Adamsky.
- Sonny...

659
01:36:42,227 --> 01:36:44,058
if you can hear me...

660
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:47,389
resist the unclean spirit.

661
01:36:49,801 --> 01:36:52,531
Will it to leave your body.

662
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:57,375
You've decided to do this on your own,
without the support of the church.

663
01:36:57,475 --> 01:36:59,909
You are disobeying the church.

664
01:37:01,646 --> 01:37:04,342
Now you are alone, Adamsky.

665
01:37:15,126 --> 01:37:18,152
Flee, evil spirit.

666
01:37:20,365 --> 01:37:23,869
Depart from this servant of God.

667
01:37:23,969 --> 01:37:25,459
No!

668
01:37:28,106 --> 01:37:30,870
Flee, evil spirit.

669
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:33,471
I command you.

670
01:37:35,247 --> 01:37:37,181
In the name of God.

671
01:38:14,586 --> 01:38:17,248
Let it be me, my God.

672
01:38:19,124 --> 01:38:20,751
Not him.

673
01:38:24,362 --> 01:38:27,092
Let it be me!

674
01:38:38,243 --> 01:38:41,440
My God, let it be me!

675
01:39:47,479 --> 01:39:49,470
Take him away from here.

676
01:39:50,348 --> 01:39:53,283
- What about you?
- Take him away, now!

677
01:39:54,786 --> 01:39:57,914
Sonny, you come with me.

678
01:40:02,093 --> 01:40:03,355
Come on.

679
01:40:24,249 --> 01:40:27,047
It's all right, Sonny. Now, come on.

680
01:40:28,887 --> 01:40:31,481
They'll understand it wasn't your fault.

681
01:40:31,823 --> 01:40:33,950
We'll make them understand.

682
01:42:08,486 --> 01:42:11,580
Blessed Lord. Lord of my life!

683
01:42:13,391 --> 01:42:15,222
Do not forsake me!
