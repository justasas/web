1
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,174
They say that women change.

2
00:00:46,277 --> 00:00:48,643
'Tis so,

3
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:52,774
but you are ever-constant
in your changefulness.

4
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,183
Like that still thread
of falling river,

5
00:00:56,254 --> 00:01:00,486
one from source to last embrace
in the still pool.

6
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,756
Ever-anewed
and ever-moving on.

7
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:06,854
From first to last.
"From first to last,

8
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:09,399
a myriad water drops.
"A myriad water drops.

9
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:12,595
"And you...
I love you for it...

10
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,664
are the force that moves
and holds the form."

11
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:21,508
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
you've just heard a snippet...

12
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:25,538
from one of only two copies
of this poem...

13
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:28,278
by Mr. Randolph Henry Ash,

14
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:32,755
poet laureate
to Queen Victoria herself.

15
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:36,419
And this gorgeous ode
to his nuptial bliss,

16
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:40,760
written in his own hand,
begins our bidding today.

17
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:45,292
May we start the bidding
please at £40,000.

18
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:16,632
- Bit of an old monster.
- Yeah.

19
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:20,569
But an important monster.
It's Randolph Ash's.

20
00:02:20,638 --> 00:02:22,663
Yes. Who are you
with again?

21
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:28,142
I'm, uh, Roland Michell.
Who?

22
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:32,308
- Professor Blackadder's research assistant.
- Isn't that Dr. Wolfe?

23
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:36,479
Was. Fergus got the lectureship
at Saint John’s... over me.

24
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:41,651
Of course he did. Oh, yes,
Dr. Wolfe mentioned you.

25
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:44,320
You're that American
who's over here.

26
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:46,522
Well, I'm sure
there are others.

27
00:02:46,597 --> 00:02:48,758
I mean, after all,
you are our favorite colony.

28
00:02:56,674 --> 00:03:01,043
£ 10,000. Any further
offers on £ 10,000?

29
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:03,046
£ 11,000.

30
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:06,413
So when do your little suffragist
trinkets come up for the...

31
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:09,009
Look, Maud,
it's Mortimer Cropper.

32
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:11,111
Oh, yes. That's someone
you should know.

33
00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:13,419
- You know him?
- Of him.

34
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:15,789
Suffered through a lecture or two.
That sort of thing. Really.

35
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,226
Mm-hmm. He's a voracious
collector from what I hear.

36
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:21,390
Yes. His penchant for
conquests is well documented.

37
00:03:21,465 --> 00:03:23,626
It's a very male quality. Mm.

38
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,692
I know it's vulgar,
but I have to introduce myself.

39
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,704
Oh, all right.

40
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:31,708
Oh, uh... Damn. Let's begin
the bidding please at £ 4,000.

41
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:36,372
£ 4,000. £ 4,000.
Excuse me. Sorry.

42
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:39,678
£ 4,500. Um, Professor
Cropper, Fergus Wolfe.

43
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,346
Um, we spoke actually after one
of your papers at, uh, at Trinity.

44
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:47,687
You wouldn't remember. I'm
sorry, I don't. Nice coat though.

45
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:51,023
Oh, thank you. Uh, James
Blackadder. You're with?

46
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:54,428
Ah, you're one of Blackadder's
boys from the British Museum.

47
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:57,023
Hello.
Hildebrand Ash,

48
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,662
man of leisure.
Oh, hello.

49
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:02,763
I don't know why Blackadder
comes to these things.

50
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,536
He hasn't got any money.

51
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,478
Well, he's Irish, you see.
He enjoys feeling persecuted.

52
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,004
Dear Madame:

53
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:38,940
Since our pleasant conversation,
I have thought of little else.

54
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:42,111
I write with a strong sense
of the necessity...

55
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:44,238
of continuing our talk.

56
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:57,184
Dear Madame: I know that you came
only to honor Crabb-Robinson...

57
00:04:57,261 --> 00:05:00,287
at his small,
informal party...

58
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:03,162
because he had been of assistance
to your illustrious father.

59
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:05,896
Excuse me, sir.

60
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,904
Meal is served.

61
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:12,133
Thank you.

62
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:52,809
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

63
00:06:52,877 --> 00:06:55,607
Ah, my tenant.
Your evening sherry.

64
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:57,909
Thank you.

65
00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:00,246
Candy, this is Roland.
Roland, Candy.

66
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:04,083
- Hello again.
- Be a love and check on the duck, eh?

67
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:08,353
- Okay.
- So, coming in?

68
00:07:09,393 --> 00:07:11,327
So how do you
always know it's me?

69
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:14,296
I'm a solicitor.
I know everything.

70
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:16,890
- Candy, huh?
- Oh, no, no, no, please.

71
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:20,664
Candy's just a friend.
Why, are you interested?

72
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:23,400
- I told you I'm off women.
- Yeah, but...

73
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:25,999
it isn't a reason
to be off women.

74
00:07:31,282 --> 00:07:33,807
Why do we always
sit in your hall?

75
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:37,684
'Cause it's the best room in the house,
really. I bought this place for the hallway.

76
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,392
So, I found something today I think is
pretty incredible in the London Library.

77
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:46,726
- A place to sit.
- No.

78
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:49,561
I found something of Ash's.
You know Randolph Ash?

79
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:53,660
Ash. Oh, doesn't he have
some sort of celebration going?

80
00:07:53,737 --> 00:07:56,638
It's the centenary of his love
poems. Terribly mushy ones.

81
00:07:56,707 --> 00:07:58,902
Found after his death
or something, weren't they?

82
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:01,069
Is the table laid,
darling?

83
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:03,375
Listen.
What's it cost an hour?

84
00:08:03,447 --> 00:08:05,381
No, no, Candy's a friend
I told you.

85
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:09,476
Not her, you. What do you
charge an hour, roughly?

86
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:12,488
Oh, uh, I don't know.
Five hundred.

87
00:08:12,556 --> 00:08:15,150
- Pounds?
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:17,717
- Jesus, no wonder you have a nice hallway.
- Thank you.

89
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:21,595
Okay, I wanna buy seven minutes of
attorney/client privilege right now.

90
00:08:21,665 --> 00:08:23,758
Step into my office.

91
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,872
Ash wrote those.
They're not the originals.

92
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:40,883
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

93
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:43,715
How much time we got left? I've
got to think of a defense for you.

94
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:46,449
They're practically
love letters.

95
00:08:46,524 --> 00:08:48,719
Well, they're racy, actually.
See, Ash...

96
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:50,760
supposedly never even looked
at another woman.

97
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:53,353
I mean, not even glanced at one
his entire marriage.

98
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,194
Can you imagine what would
happen if I could prove...

99
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:59,794
that Mr. Perfect Husband had this, like,
Shakespearean-type dark lady thing going?

100
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,471
Darling, the duck's done.

101
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,475
Would you be a sweetheart
and do the sauce?

102
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,602
Yes, yes.

103
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:12,514
- Duck, huh?
- Yeah, Peking.

104
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,450
It's from around the corner.

105
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,579
Yeah, but that
would be extraordinary.

106
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,385
It would be rewriting
history, old chap.

107
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:26,959
Yeah, it would be.

108
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,766
Morning.
Morning.

109
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:14,709
Roland.
Professor.

110
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,383
I think
I made a discovery.

111
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:23,147
It'll turn out to have been
discovered 20 times already.

112
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,712
- I don't think so.
- Surprise me.

113
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:30,018
Ash's copy of Vico
in the London Library.

114
00:10:30,094 --> 00:10:32,892
It's full of his own notes on loose
bits of paper all the way through.

115
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:34,897
- Useful?
- Very.

116
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:38,298
Better have a look.
See what's what before...

117
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:40,894
people turn up with his checkbook.
I also found... Professor.

118
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:44,964
They made a mockery over at Sotheby's
yesterday. £ 1900 for a toothpick.

119
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:48,239
Fergus. Where is Fergus?

120
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:51,679
- He's supposed to be teaching.
- I'll come with you.

121
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:54,479
No need. The novice
blunders on the discovery.

122
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:56,985
The scholar investigates.

123
00:10:57,054 --> 00:11:01,252
You get on with those wretched
requests for Ellen's stuff.

124
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:03,316
I'll go straight from there
to my class.

125
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:11,059
Thank you, Roland. What a wonderful
discovery. They're magically delicious.

126
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:15,128
- He's a meany.
- That's a very nice name for what he is.

127
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:17,400
Wretched requests, please.

128
00:11:17,474 --> 00:11:20,671
"How many jars
of gooseberry jam...

129
00:11:20,744 --> 00:11:24,578
did Ash's wife, Ellen,
make in 1850?"

130
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:28,015
Hmm. This is not
a job for a grown-up.

131
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:35,616
Gooseberry.

132
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:41,988
Cooking.
Gooseberry jam.

133
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:46,699
Cooking, 143.

134
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:08,554
What about a small,
informal party?

135
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,684
1859.

136
00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:28,278
My headache last night prevented
me from accompanying Randolph...

137
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:31,007
to dear Crabb-Robinson's...

138
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:33,914
for a dinner honoring
the poetess Christabel LaMotte.

139
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:37,545
He was reluctant to attend
without me, but I was persistent...

140
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:39,555
and finally persuaded him.

141
00:12:39,623 --> 00:12:41,557
Ash, you know
Professor Spear.

142
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,650
I'm delighted.

143
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,355
Mrs. Jameson.
Mrs. Jameson.

144
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,364
Charmed.

145
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:50,662
Miss Glover.

146
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:52,725
Oh, Miss Glover.

147
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:55,829
- And Miss LaMotte.
- Miss LaMotte.

148
00:12:57,741 --> 00:13:00,938
The highest pleasure.

149
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:04,139
Randolph reported the party went
off very well, indeed.

150
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:06,682
The discussion of poetry
was animated,

151
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,346
with Miss LaMotte speaking more
forcibly than anyone expected.

152
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:14,652
Surprises me, Madame, that a lady
who lives as quietly as you do...

153
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:18,991
wouldn't be aware
of my modest success.

154
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:22,691
Oh, I'm very aware that the
papers herald you weekly.

155
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:26,196
It is you, however,
who surprise me.

156
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:30,570
- And why is that?
- Judging from your work,

157
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:32,700
I'm surprised you'd even
acknowledge my existence...

158
00:13:32,776 --> 00:13:36,576
or any woman's for that matter since you
show us such small regard on the page.

159
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:40,540
You cut me, Madame.

160
00:13:40,617 --> 00:13:42,551
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:44,849
I only meant to scratch.

162
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:49,658
Hey, Fergus.

163
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:53,287
Ah, hello, Roland.

164
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:56,332
What is it you chaps always say,
"How's it hanging?"

165
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,801
Well, we usually just say
"hey." Unless you're gay.

166
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,134
Oh.
Listen.

167
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:04,606
Let me ask you something.
Do you know a Dr. Maud Bailey?

168
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:06,609
Maud! Oh, yes,
I know Maud very well.

169
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,872
She teaches Gender Studies
at Lincoln.

170
00:14:08,946 --> 00:14:13,906
Oh. Would she be helpful? I'm
checking out Christabel LaMotte.

171
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:15,975
She's a poet,
writing around about 1859.

172
00:14:16,053 --> 00:14:17,987
Yes, yes. Why would you
be interested in her?

173
00:14:18,055 --> 00:14:21,923
Oh, nothing. It's just I had some
requests about Ellen Ash's papers.

174
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:23,926
But LaMotte's name
came up, so...

175
00:14:23,994 --> 00:14:27,725
The keeper of Ellen's flame. I mean, that's
the bottom of the food chain, old sport.

176
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:31,359
Yeah, but I got to stay on the food
chain, old sport. That's why I do it.

177
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,960
Right. Well, "Publish
or perish," as they say.

178
00:14:34,037 --> 00:14:36,562
Or in your case,
"Perish or perish."

179
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:41,643
So would she...
this Maud Bailey person?

180
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,010
Oh, yes, but I'd be careful
if I were you.

181
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:47,744
Why? What's she like? Well, she
thicks men's blood with cold.

182
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:51,447
Oh, great. Or if you prefer
the American vernacular...

183
00:14:51,521 --> 00:14:53,989
she's a regular ball breaker.

184
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:06,165
Mr. Michell?

185
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:10,663
What? I'm sorry.
Roland Michell.

186
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:12,675
Yes.

187
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:16,076
You're Maud.
Bailey. Dr. Bailey, yes.

188
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:19,877
There's nothing in my index.
No mention of Ash at all.

189
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,884
Well, Ash and LaMotte
definitely met.

190
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:24,978
Really? When?
June, 1859.

191
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:27,182
At a dinner party
given by Crabb-Robinson.

192
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,420
And you jumped from that to
the idea that they corresponded.

193
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,727
I found an unfinished draft
of a letter in a book...

194
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,960
Addressed to LaMotte?
No, just "Dear Madame."

195
00:15:38,035 --> 00:15:40,003
But there were three women at
Crabb-Robinson's dinner party,

196
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,197
and out of the three
it's likeliest to be LaMotte.

197
00:15:42,272 --> 00:15:45,139
So maybe there's something
in LaMotte's letters.

198
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,769
There aren't many from the Richmond
period... the time you're interested in.

199
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:53,746
I'm descended from Christabel,
actually. I'm her niece, thrice removed.

200
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:58,713
Three grades. That's what
"thrice" usually means.

201
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:03,189
Oh, maybe
I shouldn't have come.

202
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,195
It does seem
rather pointless.

203
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:10,595
Well, I supposed since you're here, you
could have a look through Blanche's diary.

204
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:13,033
Who's Blanche?
Blanche Glover.

205
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:16,072
Christabel's companion.
Her lover.

206
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,266
Oh, you look surprised.

207
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:20,503
I didn't know she was...
Didn't know she was a lesbian.

208
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:22,636
No. I mean, don't get me
wrong, I like lesbians.

209
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:25,204
Yes, well, unfortunately, they didn't
have video cameras in those days,

210
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:27,512
so you're out of luck.

211
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:29,779
Now I see why you think
it's so unlikely.

212
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:33,084
Not from that point of view. I mean,
God, she could have been bisexual.

213
00:16:33,156 --> 00:16:35,181
There's no evidence she was,
but in theory...

214
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:38,091
Did you not do any reading
before you came?

215
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:40,391
Is this like an oral exam?
Yes, I suppose it is.

216
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:44,127
I mean, you don't know the first thing
about her, and yet you make these leaps.

217
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:47,261
Hey, you're the one who
called her a lesbian, not me.

218
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:02,409
Letters, letters, letters.

219
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:04,420
Not for me.

220
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:07,651
Letters I am not meant
to know or see.

221
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:23,637
Thank you, Jane.

222
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:34,975
- You do not have to hide them from me.
- I'm not hiding them.

223
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,356
You say they are not hidden,
but they are.

224
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:43,985
Tucked away... as if they
were from Cupid himself.

225
00:17:46,997 --> 00:17:48,931
What does he want?

226
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:52,093
To be my friend.
Friend.

227
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:57,139
They always try and give
what they want a decent name.

228
00:17:57,207 --> 00:18:01,166
Blanche, no.
No, Blanche, listen.

229
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:07,512
What we have...
is ours.

230
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:09,643
No one can change that.

231
00:18:16,726 --> 00:18:18,660
'Tis already changed.

232
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:38,105
- Find anything?
- Maybe.

233
00:19:02,072 --> 00:19:04,165
So what are
those bookmarks then?

234
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:07,342
Blanche writes about letters.

235
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,402
Letters, letters that Christabel
wrote and received.

236
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,505
And it nearly
drove Blanche crazy.

237
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:14,516
Where are they?

238
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:17,678
Lost. Destroyed. Who knows?
There's lots we haven't got.

239
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:20,723
Not one of Blanche's paintings
has ever turned up, for instance.

240
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,892
So who do you think
wrote the letters?

241
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,394
We've never been able
to verify who he was,

242
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:28,863
but Ash certainly
isn't one of the candidates.

243
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:33,165
You've got nothing. I
mean, it's just a thought.

244
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:35,170
Of course, I've thrown out
a lot of thoughts today,

245
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:37,706
and you've pretty much
shot them all down, so...

246
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:41,540
Yes, well, it seems like a bit
of a wild-goose chase to me.

247
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:43,545
I'd like to do
some more reading.

248
00:19:43,613 --> 00:19:47,049
I suppose you'll wish to
stay here overnight then?

249
00:19:47,117 --> 00:19:49,745
Well, I can't really afford
to stay overnight.

250
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:52,720
Unless you want me huddled
downstairs in your doorway.

251
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,690
I suppose I could put up with
you for one evening, couldn't I?

252
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:07,861
No doubt you know
Fergus Wolfe then.

253
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:11,271
I'm sorry. Uh, yeah, we're
in the same department.

254
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:14,037
I imagine that
he told you that we're...

255
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,044
occasionally
on together.

256
00:20:16,112 --> 00:20:20,776
- No, he didn't.
- Well, did he...

257
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,217
Did he say anything...
about me?

258
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:26,346
Uh...

259
00:20:27,257 --> 00:20:29,191
No.

260
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:33,893
Right. I'll use the bathroom
first. Get out of your way.

261
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:37,058
Please. I'm just sort of a brush
and flush kind of guy, so...

262
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,464
Forget I said that.

263
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,530
Maud.

264
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:46,667
Can I show you something?

265
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,093
Are these... How did you
get... Those are the originals.

266
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,094
I took them. I sort of
stole them. Took them?

267
00:21:06,162 --> 00:21:08,130
Where from?
The London Library.

268
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:10,996
How could you do that?
It was on impulse.

269
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:13,865
Impulse?

270
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:16,269
Right. I've seen that
take-what-you-want attitude in other...

271
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:18,273
What, in other Americans?

272
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:22,300
God, what is it with
you people and Americans?

273
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:24,779
Look, I know that I shouldn't
have taken them. I know that.

274
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:27,078
But, Maud, I want to
find out what happened?

275
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,981
Did he or didn't he
send the letter?

276
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:30,986
You might not buy into
my theory, but to me,

277
00:21:31,054 --> 00:21:33,181
Blanche's diary
suggests that it's possible.

278
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:35,850
Wouldn't someone have
unearthed a thing like this?

279
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:39,224
- That's what makes it so big.
- Potentially so big.

280
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:42,857
- Well, no one has.
- Probably because those were never sent.

281
00:22:11,361 --> 00:22:13,591
Are you doing your homework?

282
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:17,857
No, I'm just...
writing stuff.

283
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:19,868
Stuff for me.
It's nothing.

284
00:22:19,936 --> 00:22:23,030
You're a closet poet.
Uh...

285
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:25,574
more like basement,
really.

286
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:28,236
I'm just, uh,
just fooling around.

287
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:30,438
Is that what you want
to be when you grow up?

288
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:34,040
No, I'm gonna be safe and
teach like everybody else.

289
00:22:35,952 --> 00:22:39,513
Besides, there's no such
thing as poets anymore.

290
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:43,025
Well... poet,

291
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:47,291
do you want a secret about
his family home before you go?

292
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:50,060
Michell's late again.

293
00:22:52,268 --> 00:22:54,532
Roland asked for
another day off, Fergus.

294
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:56,538
Oh, really?
Where's he gone?

295
00:22:56,606 --> 00:23:00,007
I didn't ask,
and he didn't say.

296
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:03,534
He's American, for God's sake.
He's probably off trafficking drugs.

297
00:23:03,613 --> 00:23:06,776
Did his new discovery
lead to anything?

298
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,216
Ash's Vico.
Are you dreaming?

299
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:13,278
Vico? No, no, this had something
to do with Christabel LaMotte.

300
00:23:13,356 --> 00:23:16,757
He went to see Dr. Bailey
in Lincoln... a woman.

301
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:20,262
LaMotte. Hmm. No.

302
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,265
- Well, it probably came to nothing then.
- Exactly.

303
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,893
Or he would have told you.

304
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:31,663
Wouldn't he?

305
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,141
Seal Court's
over there.

306
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:45,949
So how long did Christabel
live at this Seal Court place?

307
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:49,150
Ages. The last 20
or so years of her life.

308
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:52,327
Excuse me.
Sorry.

309
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:55,796
"To a dusty shelf we aspire."

310
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:00,768
You should drop by Seal Court
before the train.

311
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,000
And what do you do
in London, Mr. Michell?

312
00:24:07,076 --> 00:24:10,603
Are you a teacher as well? No,
not yet. I'm doing a fellowship.

313
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,480
- Which means what exactly?
- On the dole.

314
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,118
Um, my field's
Victorian poetry.

315
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:21,885
We had ourselves a poet
in this house once.

316
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:26,622
Terrible, sentimental stuff about
God and death and the dew and fairies.

317
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:30,132
Why don't you show this young
man Christabel's room, Maud?

318
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,397
And why don't you
stay tonight?

319
00:24:34,804 --> 00:24:36,738
You're under no obligation
to stay, of course.

320
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:39,400
It's just Joan’s way.
Misses our daughter.

321
00:24:39,476 --> 00:24:41,774
Quite a drive back,
actually. No, we're fine.

322
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:43,836
Oh, well.

323
00:24:43,913 --> 00:24:46,507
Hardly ever come up here.

324
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:51,213
With the wheelchair, of course,
we bunk down on the ground floor.

325
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,619
I haven't been up here
since I was a child.

326
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:05,991
Maud, is this the photograph
at your house?

327
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:08,230
Yes, that's
Christabel's niece, May.

328
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:10,238
That's my
great-great-grandmother.

329
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:15,274
Christabel wrote dozens of poems
about this place.

330
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:24,710
"Haunted are they who haunt our
dreams and weaken our desires...

331
00:25:24,787 --> 00:25:26,721
"and turn us
from a solid face.

332
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:31,852
"And in the depth of wintery night,
they slumber in the night and bright.

333
00:25:31,928 --> 00:25:36,695
"Dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend.

334
00:25:36,766 --> 00:25:39,633
"Dolly's silent sympathy
lasts without end.

335
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:43,798
"No rush of action,
this is our doom.

336
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:48,810
To live a long life out
in a dark room."

337
00:25:51,147 --> 00:25:53,775
Maud.

338
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,909
It's pretty
incredible, huh?

339
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,226
Fergus, it's me.

340
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:10,323
I-I'm out of town tonight
on business.

341
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,063
I've stumbled onto a connection
between Christabel and Randolph Ash...

342
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:16,071
and have a few questions
for you.

343
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:21,441
Call me on 015-22632416.

344
00:26:32,488 --> 00:26:34,547
Roland.

345
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:39,387
Roland.

346
00:26:39,462 --> 00:26:42,863
Roland. Roland.
No!

347
00:26:42,932 --> 00:26:46,129
Roland, it's me.
It's Maud.

348
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:50,372
- What is it?
- Listen.

349
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:55,271
"Dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend.

350
00:26:55,345 --> 00:26:59,941
Dolly's silent sympathy
lasts without end."

351
00:27:38,054 --> 00:27:40,454
God.

352
00:27:41,891 --> 00:27:43,984
I was so sure.

353
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,689
Sympathy.
Sympathy.

354
00:27:47,764 --> 00:27:49,823
Sympathy, meaning what?

355
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,192
Mutual affection
or understanding.

356
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:57,467
Favor pity or even accord.
But that's not it, is it?

357
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:01,176
That's what she told her.

358
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:06,137
She uses silent sympathy
in a more classical context.

359
00:28:06,215 --> 00:28:09,343
Like structural support.
Dolly conceals it.

360
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:12,911
Yes, but not within,
beneath.

361
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:21,053
There's a door.
There's a door.

362
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,606
- I can't believe it.
- Let me see.

363
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:41,616
Be-Be careful. They're very
precious. I'll be very careful.

364
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:43,618
Oh, God, we shouldn't
be doing this.

365
00:28:43,686 --> 00:28:47,554
What do you mean, we shouldn't be doing
this? Why'd you drag me up here then?

366
00:28:47,623 --> 00:28:49,818
What are you doing?
I'm going to read.

367
00:28:49,892 --> 00:28:51,826
Stop. We've got to
ask the Baileys.

368
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:54,795
You ask, and the next time you see
these is under glass in New Mexico.

369
00:28:54,864 --> 00:28:56,695
Stop it. Stop. Stop.
Stop. All right. All right.

370
00:28:56,766 --> 00:28:58,734
But can we please
at least do it properly?

371
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:01,235
Let me run downstairs and get
some note cards and some pencils.

372
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:03,431
All right.
Go, go! Hurry!

373
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,871
Look at this. We've got Ash
and Christabel's letters here.

374
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:44,879
- Look. Come here. Listen.
- What?

375
00:29:44,947 --> 00:29:47,643
"Dear Miss LaMotte:

376
00:29:47,717 --> 00:29:49,651
"It was a great pleasure
to talk to you...

377
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:52,620
"at dear
Crabb-Robinson's party.

378
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:56,857
"May I hope that you too
enjoyed our talk.

379
00:29:56,926 --> 00:30:00,327
And may I have the pleasure
of calling on you."

380
00:30:02,632 --> 00:30:05,999
She says, " No,
but you may write.

381
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:10,061
"Would you rather not have
a letter, however imperfect,

382
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:13,108
"than a plate
of cucumber sandwiches,

383
00:30:13,176 --> 00:30:16,168
"however exquisitely
fine cut?

384
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:19,009
Know you would,
and so would I."

385
00:30:22,552 --> 00:30:27,216
"I was entranced and moved by your
brief portrait of your father."

386
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,191
"I write nonsense,
but if you can't write again,

387
00:30:30,259 --> 00:30:32,921
"you shall have a sober essay
on what you will.

388
00:30:32,995 --> 00:30:36,522
"Yours to command
in some things.

389
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,533
"Where I was born,
Christabel Lamotte."

390
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:40,796
"Was a small place too.

391
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,338
"Not like this.
Not bare.

392
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:45,704
"A brilliant, dusty hutch
of mystery"...

393
00:30:45,775 --> 00:30:48,869
is a cabinet of curiosities.

394
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,914
What did my eyes
first light on?

395
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:55,542
I am a creature of my pen.

396
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:58,781
My pen is the best part
of me.

397
00:30:58,855 --> 00:31:01,619
I send you now
two more poems.

398
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:04,751
I eagerly read
your mythic tales of mire...

399
00:31:04,827 --> 00:31:07,921
and found them
both charming and sad.

400
00:31:07,997 --> 00:31:12,024
Your verse is rich, but
perhaps the metaphor is richer.

401
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:14,035
Dear Mr. Ash:

402
00:31:14,103 --> 00:31:17,231
I live circumscribed
and self-communing.

403
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:19,240
It is best so.

404
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:23,472
Not like a princess in the thicket,
more like a spider in her web.

405
00:31:23,546 --> 00:31:28,006
"Inclined to snap at visitors
or trespassers,

406
00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:31,645
"not perceiving the distinction
until too late.

407
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:34,121
Thus, it is unwise to call."

408
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,556
I know you live very quietly.

409
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:38,753
But I could be very quiet.

410
00:31:38,828 --> 00:31:41,262
I only want to discuss
Dante and Shakespeare,

411
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,060
Wordsworth, Coleridge,
and Goethe.

412
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:48,263
Not forgetting, of course,
Christabel LaMotte...

413
00:31:48,337 --> 00:31:51,670
and the ambitious
fairy project.

414
00:32:06,255 --> 00:32:09,486
Oh, sir, things flicker and shift.

415
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:13,255
All spangle and sparkle
and flashes.

416
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:16,787
I have sat all this long evening
by my fireside,

417
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:19,630
turning towards
a caving in,

418
00:32:19,702 --> 00:32:22,136
the crumbling
of the consumed coals,

419
00:32:22,204 --> 00:32:25,002
to where I am leading myself...

420
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:27,872
to lifeless dust, sir.

421
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:33,644
My dear friend... for I may
call myself a friend, may I not?

422
00:32:35,017 --> 00:32:37,281
I speak to you as I would
speak to any person...

423
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:40,550
who possesses my true thoughts.

424
00:32:40,623 --> 00:32:42,955
For my true thoughts have spent
more time in your company...

425
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:47,257
than in anyone else's
these last few weeks.

426
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,798
Where my thoughts are,

427
00:32:49,865 --> 00:32:51,924
there am I in truth.

428
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:57,699
"My dear friend:
It has been borne in upon me...

429
00:32:57,773 --> 00:33:01,641
that there are dangers
in our continued conversation."

430
00:33:01,711 --> 00:33:03,975
The world would not look well
upon letters...

431
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:07,311
between a woman living
in shared solitude as I do...

432
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:09,374
and a man.

433
00:33:09,452 --> 00:33:13,650
Even if that man
were a great poet.

434
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:16,317
And if one is to live
in this way,

435
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:20,795
it is imperative to appear respectable
in the eyes of that world...

436
00:33:20,863 --> 00:33:23,058
and your wife.

437
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,536
It is a sealed pact.

438
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:31,437
It is a chosen way of life in which
I have been wondrously happy...

439
00:33:31,507 --> 00:33:34,738
and not alone in being so.

440
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:37,540
"I have chosen a way,
dear friend,

441
00:33:37,613 --> 00:33:40,605
"I must hold to it.

442
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:43,447
"Be patient.
Be generous. Forgive.

443
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:48,422
"May I also request that you
return my correspondence to me.

444
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:52,120
"In this way, at least our
letters will remain together.

445
00:33:52,194 --> 00:33:55,789
"I have known incandescence...

446
00:33:55,865 --> 00:33:58,766
"and must decline
to sample it any further.

447
00:34:00,102 --> 00:34:02,434
"This now goes to the post.

448
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:06,236
Forgive its faults and
forgive me. Christabel. "

449
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:10,635
My dear Christabel:

450
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:13,614
Your letter came as a shock
to me, I will confess.

451
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:20,154
I was at first not only shocked,
but angry that you should write so.

452
00:34:21,991 --> 00:34:25,586
As you've asked about my wife,
however, I will tell you.

453
00:34:27,063 --> 00:34:30,123
I love Ellen,
but not as I love you.

454
00:34:32,902 --> 00:34:35,894
There are good reasons which I
cannot discuss why my love for you...

455
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:38,531
may not hurt her.

456
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:41,633
I do not feel I have been
a proper wife to you, Randolph.

457
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,235
Without children, without
ever any kind of physical...

458
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:46,747
Nonsense, Ellen.

459
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:48,875
Nonsense.

460
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:53,646
There are many
types of love.

461
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:56,791
All sorts.

462
00:34:56,859 --> 00:35:02,456
And ours
are good between us.

463
00:35:04,834 --> 00:35:06,859
It has been most profound.

464
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:13,335
I must say to you
what is in my mind.

465
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:16,640
I have called you my muse,
and so you are.

466
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:19,704
I could call you
with even greater truth...

467
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:22,307
my love.

468
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:26,887
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
What? Don't do that. What?

469
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:29,424
So he sends his response.
He sends her more letters.

470
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:31,858
She doesn't answer them.
She ignores them.

471
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:34,487
Typical.

472
00:35:34,563 --> 00:35:37,464
No. She-She chose her life
with Blanche.

473
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:41,025
It's not typical.
It's remarkable.

474
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:49,002
"I shall hope against hope
that this note is the dove...

475
00:35:49,078 --> 00:35:51,842
"which will return with
the wished-for olive branch.

476
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:55,577
My letters are like Noah's ravens...
they have sped out across the Thames "

477
00:35:55,651 --> 00:36:00,850
They have sped out across the
Thames and yet have not returned.

478
00:36:00,923 --> 00:36:04,381
I send this note by hand in the
hope that you might receive it.

479
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:14,197
Where are the letters?

480
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,329
They're gone.

481
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:22,341
I tore them up.
I burned them.

482
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:24,743
And the others
from my desk?

483
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:27,839
The same.

484
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:33,020
I beg for us to be as
we were, Christabel.

485
00:36:33,088 --> 00:36:36,182
Sweetheart, please.

486
00:36:42,464 --> 00:36:45,126
This house, so happy once,

487
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:49,137
is full of weeping and wailing
and black headaches.

488
00:36:49,205 --> 00:36:51,730
I ask myself
to whom I may turn...

489
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:55,243
and think of you,
my friend...

490
00:36:55,311 --> 00:36:59,042
the unwitting cause
of all this grief.

491
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:09,150
I shan't forget the first
glimpse of your form...

492
00:37:10,392 --> 00:37:14,226
illuminated as it was
by flashes of sunlight.

493
00:37:14,296 --> 00:37:17,697
I have dreamt nightly
of your face.

494
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:22,169
To walk to the landscape of my life
with the rhythms of your writing...

495
00:37:22,238 --> 00:37:24,172
ringing in my ears.

496
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,708
I shall never forget
our shining progress...

497
00:37:26,775 --> 00:37:29,505
towards one another.

498
00:37:29,578 --> 00:37:34,675
Never have I felt such a
concentration of my entire being.

499
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:38,447
I cannot let you
burn me up,

500
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,080
nor can I resist you.

501
00:37:41,156 --> 00:37:46,458
No mere human can stand in
a fire and not be consumed.

502
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:55,165
You mind reading that last
part out one more time?

503
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,931
"I cannot let you
burn me up,

504
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:05,009
"nor can I resist you.

505
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,480
"No mere human
can stand in a fire...

506
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:09,983
and not be consumed."

507
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:14,252
- That?
- Yeah.

508
00:38:19,194 --> 00:38:21,822
Thank you and...

509
00:38:21,897 --> 00:38:26,766
"And I took your hand.
Mine rested in yours...

510
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:29,963
with trust and relief."

511
00:38:40,316 --> 00:38:42,477
Do you have regrets?

512
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:48,485
I should regret venturing out to
Crabb-Robinson's party that evening.

513
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:55,023
I should regret it,
but I do not.

514
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:58,897
Not even in that most
sensible corner of my heart.

515
00:39:02,604 --> 00:39:04,868
What are we to do?

516
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:12,937
"I do not wish to
damage your life.

517
00:39:13,015 --> 00:39:16,280
"Nonetheless, I shall be in
the church at noon tomorrow,

518
00:39:17,586 --> 00:39:20,885
"with what strikes me
as the holiest of prayers...

519
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:25,921
"that you should join me
on a journey to Yorkshire...

520
00:39:25,994 --> 00:39:30,397
and journey out of time beyond
our lives here on Earth."

521
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,198
This is unbelievable.
That was the last one.

522
00:39:41,276 --> 00:39:43,403
You're kidding me.
No.

523
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,049
Well, did she go with
him or not? Hands up!

524
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:50,813
You two?

525
00:39:53,822 --> 00:39:58,282
- What's this then? - There's
been no harm done, George.

526
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,260
How do we know
if harm's been done?

527
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:03,992
I think it was very clever
of Maud to find your treasure.

528
00:40:04,066 --> 00:40:09,470
Yes. Well, must
take advice, Joanie.

529
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,301
How long before Sir George
takes advice?

530
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:17,311
He'll dither around for
a while, but not long.

531
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:20,439
Blanche's diary has nothing
for that period.

532
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:22,609
What about Ellen Ash?
Did she keep a journal?

533
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:25,983
Yeah, in London, but it's mostly
just boring housewife stuff.

534
00:40:26,054 --> 00:40:30,150
God is in the boring housewife
stuff. We should check it.

535
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,704
Bailey here.
Bailey.

536
00:40:43,772 --> 00:40:45,933
Is that Dr. Heath?

537
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:49,341
No. Um, I'm a friend
of Maud Bailey's.

538
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:51,345
I was wondering,
is she there?

539
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:55,941
No, she isn't. Could you get off
the line? I'm expecting the doctor.

540
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:58,316
Oh, um, have you seen
Roland Michell?

541
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:01,823
Not since
this morning, no.

542
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,824
But his work
went well, did it?

543
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:08,022
The fairy poem?
I haven't the foggiest idea.

544
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:10,030
Do you mean
Christabel LaMotte?

545
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:12,760
Get off the line!

546
00:41:28,283 --> 00:41:31,377
I looked in Ellen's diary.
There's nothing.

547
00:41:31,453 --> 00:41:36,083
But, uh, this should
cheer you up.

548
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:40,994
It's in her correspondence.

549
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:43,054
I'm not going to ask
if this is the original.

550
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:45,429
I wouldn't.

551
00:41:46,668 --> 00:41:48,602
"Dear Mrs. Ash:

552
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,604
"I'm at present
totally unknown to you,

553
00:41:50,672 --> 00:41:53,869
"but I have something
to impart to which...

554
00:41:53,942 --> 00:41:59,380
"closely concerns both of us and is
in my case a matter of life and death.

555
00:41:59,448 --> 00:42:04,511
"May I trespass on your time
and come to see you?

556
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:09,546
"You would do wrong to keep this
evidence which I send to you now.

557
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:12,185
"It is not mine,
it is also not yours.

558
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:16,027
"What I say is true and urgent
as you will come to see.

559
00:42:16,098 --> 00:42:18,828
Yours sincerely,
Blanche Glover."

560
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:28,375
Mrs. Ash.

561
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:36,383
Maybe Blanche didn't tear the letters
but kept them and showed them to Ellen.

562
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:39,420
It all fits beautifully.

563
00:42:39,488 --> 00:42:43,982
Well, perhaps, um, both of our
departments should work on this together.

564
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:46,789
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know. Do you?

565
00:42:46,862 --> 00:42:49,262
No. I wanna go after them.
I wanna find out what happened.

566
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:53,062
I wanna go to Yorkshire and
follow their trail. I need to know.

567
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:57,663
I thought you were mad when you came
to Lincoln with your stolen letter.

568
00:42:59,308 --> 00:43:02,243
Now I feel
exactly the same.

569
00:43:05,647 --> 00:43:07,581
I haven't really thanked you.

570
00:43:07,649 --> 00:43:11,483
I mean, properly,
for all of this.

571
00:43:11,553 --> 00:43:15,080
I have difficulty
with compliments and such.

572
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,892
Giving or receiving?

573
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,019
Both, actually.

574
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,264
Well, I won't tell you
you're amazing-looking then.

575
00:43:23,332 --> 00:43:26,961
You're probably sick of
hearing it. Thank you. It's...

576
00:43:27,035 --> 00:43:29,367
I'm the last guy who'd act
on it, with Fergus and all.

577
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:35,138
- What does "and all" mean? - Nothing.
Just a little problem that I have socially.

578
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:37,701
Do you take anything for it?

579
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:40,805
It's not that kind
of a problem.

580
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:45,410
It's just relationships on the
whole. They're not really for me.

581
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:50,356
- Anyway...
- Yes...

582
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:54,293
anyway... thank you.

583
00:43:54,363 --> 00:43:56,661
You're welcome.

584
00:44:03,472 --> 00:44:05,963
Thank you for agreeing
to meet me, Professor.

585
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:07,975
Well, you made me rather
curious. Drink, sir?

586
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:10,102
Scotch with
just a dash of soda.

587
00:44:10,178 --> 00:44:12,703
Sir? Thank you. Uh, I'll
have the same. Thank you.

588
00:44:14,416 --> 00:44:16,816
Um, I wanted to learn
of the connection...

589
00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:19,877
between Ash
and Christabel LaMotte.

590
00:44:20,856 --> 00:44:22,790
LaMotte and Ash?
There isn't any.

591
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:24,792
Well, Roland Michell
has made a discovery...

592
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,192
with a colleague of mine,
Maud Bailey.

593
00:44:27,262 --> 00:44:29,594
I'm sorry. Who the
hell is Roland Michell?

594
00:44:29,665 --> 00:44:33,761
Oh, Blackadder's research
assistant. American.

595
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:37,828
Blondish. Well, anyway,
he seems to know you.

596
00:44:37,906 --> 00:44:39,840
And he thinks
it's important.

597
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:42,376
And does Blackadder agree?

598
00:44:42,444 --> 00:44:44,844
I don't believe
he knows anything about it.

599
00:45:17,012 --> 00:45:19,981
Do you wish to
be lunched separately?

600
00:45:21,817 --> 00:45:23,751
Respectably,
elsewhere from me?

601
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:26,686
I want to be with you.

602
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:30,418
I understood that was
what we had decided.

603
00:45:30,492 --> 00:45:35,725
These four weeks
only are ours...

604
00:45:35,797 --> 00:45:38,231
but ours alone.

605
00:45:45,807 --> 00:45:47,866
Oh, I, uh...

606
00:45:53,181 --> 00:45:55,115
I hope you will
accept this ring.

607
00:45:55,183 --> 00:45:57,708
I have brought a ring too.

608
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:01,551
You see?

609
00:46:01,623 --> 00:46:03,853
Proof of my resolution.

610
00:46:20,542 --> 00:46:22,976
You take my breath away.

611
00:46:46,301 --> 00:46:48,235
Not yet.

612
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,104
No. Not yet.

613
00:46:57,379 --> 00:47:00,610
Shall we go out,
then, to explore?

614
00:47:19,868 --> 00:47:21,927
There's your bathroom.

615
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:26,431
Bluebirds.

616
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,569
Your lovely view.

617
00:47:32,848 --> 00:47:35,078
And, of course, the bed.

618
00:47:41,857 --> 00:47:43,791
We'll look
for another hotel.

619
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:45,793
But this is
where Ash stayed.

620
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:47,795
Well, then we'll
have to share a room.

621
00:47:47,863 --> 00:47:51,264
I can bring up a folding bed for
one of you, if that's your problem.

622
00:47:53,735 --> 00:47:55,669
We work together, actually.
It's not...

623
00:47:55,737 --> 00:47:57,671
- We were expecting two rooms.
- Right.

624
00:47:57,739 --> 00:48:00,572
I'm sure it's more complicated
than I can imagine.

625
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,352
That's a lovely brooch
you're wearing, miss.

626
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:24,955
I reckon it could be one of
Isaac Greenberg's designs.

627
00:48:25,033 --> 00:48:29,060
I'll, uh, get the book
and see if I can tell.

628
00:48:36,745 --> 00:48:38,736
Where did you get this?

629
00:48:38,813 --> 00:48:42,078
I've had it for ages. It was
in the family dress-up box.

630
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:48,822
Don't you see? Ash bought
the brooch for Ellen.

631
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:53,793
The clasped hands. Here
in Whitby. We knew that.

632
00:48:53,862 --> 00:48:55,921
And this for Christabel.
Oh, right.

633
00:48:55,997 --> 00:48:58,363
So while he was buying this,
he said, um,

634
00:48:58,433 --> 00:49:00,697
"Yes, I'll have the eternal
embrace for my wife."

635
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:04,728
No, he wouldn't have said anything.
He would have just bought the brooch.

636
00:49:04,806 --> 00:49:07,604
Christabel would have seen.
It was accepted between them.

637
00:49:07,676 --> 00:49:10,577
Are you writing
fiction now?

638
00:49:12,981 --> 00:49:15,040
Maybe.

639
00:49:16,618 --> 00:49:19,086
I'm having fun.

640
00:49:19,154 --> 00:49:21,145
Are you?

641
00:49:22,157 --> 00:49:24,216
Yes, I suppose I am.

642
00:49:26,027 --> 00:49:28,518
Don't grimace when you say
it. It's more convincing.

643
00:49:29,564 --> 00:49:32,192
I suppose
I can be a touch...

644
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:35,896
empirical at times.

645
00:49:35,971 --> 00:49:38,030
Just a touch.

646
00:49:40,275 --> 00:49:42,209
Hey, you wanna go for
a walk or something?

647
00:49:42,277 --> 00:49:44,211
I mean,
out in the hills.

648
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:47,305
For sure it's earlier than
the death of Victoria's Albert.

649
00:49:47,382 --> 00:49:51,148
Probably late '50s.
1860s maybe.

650
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:53,278
1859?

651
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:56,948
Ish?

652
00:50:08,503 --> 00:50:11,768
I think we're getting
near Thomason Falls.

653
00:50:12,874 --> 00:50:14,808
Cropper mentions it...
Mortimer Cropper?

654
00:50:14,876 --> 00:50:18,937
Yeah, Ash's biographer.
All-purpose asshole.

655
00:50:19,014 --> 00:50:21,346
He's literally trekked
every step of Ash's life.

656
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:24,112
He's happy to tell you that
too. More than happy, I'm sure.

657
00:50:24,185 --> 00:50:26,949
You know him, huh?

658
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:44,163
That is beautiful.

659
00:50:47,275 --> 00:50:50,142
Maud. What?

660
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:53,442
I think Christabel
did come here.

661
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:57,846
Listen.

662
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:02,117
"Three elements combined
to make the fourth.

663
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:05,626
"But above the water and
the light, together made...

664
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:08,355
a halo in the darkened cave."

665
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:12,196
That poem's dated
1859, July.

666
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:16,537
See if there's
a cave behind it.

667
00:51:16,604 --> 00:51:18,970
That might be
all the proof we need.

668
00:51:25,246 --> 00:51:27,271
Ah...

669
00:51:27,348 --> 00:51:31,546
I know this is an awfully repressed
sort of English thing to say,

670
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:33,678
but what the hell
are you doing?

671
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:35,655
There's only one way
to find out.

672
00:51:42,297 --> 00:51:45,357
Of course, we could
have just asked someone.

673
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:14,019
Whoo! Maud! Maud!

674
00:52:14,095 --> 00:52:16,825
I found it!

675
00:54:07,075 --> 00:54:10,340
Your hands are shaking.

676
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:12,436
Are you afraid?

677
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:15,606
No.

678
00:54:16,684 --> 00:54:18,675
A little.

679
00:54:50,385 --> 00:54:53,411
"These are and were there.

680
00:54:53,488 --> 00:54:58,084
"The garden and the tree,
the serpent at its root.

681
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:03,028
"The fruit of gold, the woman
in the shadow of the boughs.

682
00:55:03,097 --> 00:55:07,227
"The running water
and the grassy space.

683
00:55:07,302 --> 00:55:10,601
They are and were there."

684
00:55:14,208 --> 00:55:16,301
I don't mind that.

685
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:23,111
See, you could grow
to like Ash.

686
00:55:23,184 --> 00:55:26,950
Yes.

687
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:29,489
He's sort of a soft-core
misogynist.

688
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:42,735
Why do you always
tie your hair up like that?

689
00:55:46,808 --> 00:55:49,868
It has to do
with Fergus Wolfe mostly.

690
00:55:49,944 --> 00:55:53,209
Fergus?
How to do with Fergus?

691
00:55:56,184 --> 00:56:00,314
When we met,
he drove me mad quoting Yeats.

692
00:56:00,388 --> 00:56:03,949
"Who could love you for yourself
alone and not your yellow hair?"

693
00:56:04,025 --> 00:56:06,152
Yes.

694
00:56:06,227 --> 00:56:10,186
And then I was accused once by my
sister feminists at a conference...

695
00:56:10,264 --> 00:56:12,528
of dyeing it
to attract men.

696
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,727
Really?
Yes.

697
00:56:14,802 --> 00:56:18,135
So I shaved it off,
all of it.

698
00:56:18,206 --> 00:56:21,369
And did he?

699
00:56:21,442 --> 00:56:25,776
Did who what? Fergus love
you without your yellow hair?

700
00:56:25,847 --> 00:56:28,247
No.

701
00:56:28,316 --> 00:56:30,307
We thought of that.

702
00:56:31,786 --> 00:56:35,051
We drove each other mad.
I don't even like him,

703
00:56:35,123 --> 00:56:38,058
but I can't seem to...
Freud.

704
00:56:38,126 --> 00:56:40,287
"On the other side of attraction
lies repulsion."

705
00:56:41,763 --> 00:56:43,822
Or was that Calvin Klein?

706
00:56:49,837 --> 00:56:53,432
- Do you believe that?
- Uh, I wouldn't know.

707
00:56:53,508 --> 00:56:58,571
I don't really allow myself to do that
Ash/Christabel grand passion kind of thing.

708
00:56:58,646 --> 00:57:00,546
Allow?
Yeah.

709
00:57:00,615 --> 00:57:04,881
Jealousy, obsession, all that.
Not anymore.

710
00:57:04,952 --> 00:57:08,388
You're lucky then.

711
00:57:08,456 --> 00:57:12,552
It all gets so...
just such a tangle.

712
00:57:12,627 --> 00:57:15,619
It's a tangle
most people want.

713
00:57:17,298 --> 00:57:19,232
Not me though.

714
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,498
My antics made
a lot of people unhappy.

715
00:57:25,072 --> 00:57:27,404
One horribly so.

716
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:33,570
For me,

717
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:40,516
whenever I feel
anything for anyone, I...

718
00:57:40,588 --> 00:57:42,783
I go cold all over.

719
00:57:42,857 --> 00:57:47,851
- What makes you do that?
- Fear, I suppose.

720
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:53,595
Fear of being burned up...
by love.

721
00:57:54,969 --> 00:57:57,961
Listen to us.

722
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:03,602
Yes. Aren't we just maudlin?

723
00:58:04,779 --> 00:58:07,179
Maud, you should
let your hair out.

724
00:58:07,248 --> 00:58:10,115
You should let it breathe.
And don't do the ice thing,

725
00:58:10,184 --> 00:58:12,652
'cause you have nothing
to worry about from me.

726
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,417
Christabel said,
"Fear all men."

727
00:58:16,491 --> 00:58:19,949
Well, Christabel
didn't know me.

728
00:58:21,562 --> 00:58:23,826
I don't want to take
anything from you.

729
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:30,228
So, then, we're both...
perfectly safe.

730
00:58:30,304 --> 00:58:32,568
Right.

731
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:23,818
How can we bear it?

732
00:59:23,891 --> 00:59:26,951
Every day
we will have less.

733
00:59:34,302 --> 00:59:36,930
Would you rather
have had nothing?

734
00:59:37,004 --> 00:59:38,938
No.

735
00:59:39,006 --> 00:59:43,375
I thank God that if there
had to be a dragon it was you.

736
01:00:31,959 --> 01:00:34,757
Wait. Wait.

737
01:00:41,936 --> 01:00:46,464
- No. I was just trying to get out
from under the covers. - No. No.

738
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:50,271
This is... We shouldn't be
doing this. It's dangerous.

739
01:00:52,947 --> 01:00:56,439
Well, I really... No, because
I like you. I like you a lot.

740
01:00:56,517 --> 01:01:00,977
I just don't want
to blow it here, and...

741
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,455
Well, it doesn't matter
to me, honestly.

742
01:01:03,524 --> 01:01:05,924
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

743
01:01:12,967 --> 01:01:17,063
Sorry. I think
we're probably just...

744
01:01:17,138 --> 01:01:20,403
In these cramped quarters.
It was a mistake.

745
01:01:22,576 --> 01:01:26,103
Maud. Maud!

746
01:01:28,549 --> 01:01:30,881
I didn't mean that.

747
01:02:01,716 --> 01:02:04,947
Let's not beat
the thing dead.

748
01:02:05,019 --> 01:02:08,113
It happened, it's over
and we're adults.

749
01:02:08,189 --> 01:02:10,953
Speak for yourself.

750
01:02:11,025 --> 01:02:15,223
I can't imagine what you're like
after you actually sleep with someone.

751
01:02:19,567 --> 01:02:24,732
Maud, I think
that you are very...

752
01:02:24,805 --> 01:02:27,239
You know?

753
01:02:27,308 --> 01:02:29,674
No, I don't know.

754
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,643
So, what, we're friends
now, is that it?

755
01:02:38,252 --> 01:02:41,312
Yeah. That's a lot.

756
01:02:41,388 --> 01:02:43,356
No, I agree.
It's fine.

757
01:02:43,424 --> 01:02:48,259
Yeah. It's perfect.

758
01:02:48,329 --> 01:02:52,095
Anyway, we're getting
off the track here.

759
01:02:52,166 --> 01:02:55,533
We came to investigate
them, not us.

760
01:03:08,249 --> 01:03:12,117
So what ever happened to
Blanche? Blanche drowned.

761
01:03:12,186 --> 01:03:14,120
Oh.

762
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:18,686
Where was Christabel? We
don't know where she was.

763
01:03:18,759 --> 01:03:21,091
The year before's
a bit blank too.

764
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:23,995
You don't know where she was
that entire year?

765
01:03:24,064 --> 01:03:26,862
There's some speculation
that she went to France,

766
01:03:26,934 --> 01:03:29,232
but I have nothing
to support that.

767
01:03:31,038 --> 01:03:36,806
Okay, so... Christabel comes
here with Ash and then disappears.

768
01:03:36,877 --> 01:03:38,902
On paper, at least.

769
01:03:38,979 --> 01:03:42,881
Yes.
And Blanche suicides.

770
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:45,384
Jesus.

771
01:03:53,027 --> 01:03:55,359
What are you doing?

772
01:03:55,429 --> 01:03:58,728
It's a poem. I've been
writing it as I've watched you.

773
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,960
You're not pleased with it?

774
01:04:01,035 --> 01:04:05,597
On the contrary. I think it perfectly
expresses the joy I have felt with you.

775
01:04:05,673 --> 01:04:07,903
Then why that?

776
01:04:07,975 --> 01:04:11,001
These feelings...
I want them to survive.

777
01:04:11,078 --> 01:04:14,104
I know I can never
declare all this...

778
01:04:14,181 --> 01:04:17,048
this love.

779
01:04:17,117 --> 01:04:21,952
There. I've said it. I know it
cannot be declared to the world.

780
01:04:22,022 --> 01:04:25,082
What I may do is scatter
these words from the train...

781
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:27,423
and hope that
they somehow take root.

782
01:04:27,494 --> 01:04:32,329
They will flourish.
I swear it.

783
01:05:21,315 --> 01:05:24,648
So... what next?

784
01:05:24,718 --> 01:05:26,743
I mean, for you.

785
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:29,254
I suppose I'll check
through the archives...

786
01:05:29,323 --> 01:05:32,258
and see if there's any clue at all where
Christabel might have been that year.

787
01:05:32,326 --> 01:05:34,487
Good.

788
01:05:34,561 --> 01:05:38,395
I guess I'll just, uh...

789
01:05:38,465 --> 01:05:41,093
hell, I don't know...

790
01:05:41,168 --> 01:05:44,160
go look up shit
on the microfiche.

791
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:46,263
Suffer over you.

792
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,831
Good-bye.

793
01:05:48,909 --> 01:05:50,900
See ya.

794
01:07:00,114 --> 01:07:02,844
Lost your way?
Don't do tours here.

795
01:07:02,916 --> 01:07:05,316
Sir George Bailey?
Who wants to know?

796
01:07:05,386 --> 01:07:07,980
Professor Mortimer Cropper,
curator of the Stan Collection,

797
01:07:08,055 --> 01:07:10,956
Robert De Leon University,
Harmony City, New Mexico.

798
01:07:11,025 --> 01:07:13,084
And this is Dr. Wolfe.
Good morning.

799
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,027
I'm a busy man.
My wife's ill.

800
01:07:16,096 --> 01:07:18,860
I can quite understand
that, sir.

801
01:07:18,932 --> 01:07:21,924
Sources have led me to believe
that you may be in possession...

802
01:07:22,002 --> 01:07:26,996
of some documentation
by Randolph Henry Ash.

803
01:07:27,074 --> 01:07:29,542
Whoa.
Don't shoot, please.

804
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:32,272
Get off my land.

805
01:07:32,346 --> 01:07:35,213
Do you have any idea
what we're talking about here?

806
01:07:35,282 --> 01:07:37,978
Do you? Do you have
any idea how much...

807
01:07:38,052 --> 01:07:40,714
such pieces,
if they existed,

808
01:07:40,788 --> 01:07:43,621
how much
they would be worth?

809
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:45,715
Worth?

810
01:07:54,234 --> 01:07:56,862
Do you mind if we swing
past the university?

811
01:07:56,937 --> 01:07:59,030
Bit of unfinished
business.

812
01:07:59,106 --> 01:08:03,202
Miss Bailey, I presume.
The accomplice.

813
01:08:03,277 --> 01:08:05,677
The very same.

814
01:08:05,746 --> 01:08:09,580
Good God, you're
like Bonnie and Clyde.

815
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:11,914
Come on.
I need a picture of her.

816
01:08:11,985 --> 01:08:15,045
I've never seen you
like this. Just go.

817
01:08:15,122 --> 01:08:18,523
Take the Porsche
and go.

818
01:08:47,554 --> 01:08:49,488
Fergus, what?

819
01:08:51,425 --> 01:08:56,590
Uh, if Fergus went out to get Indian food,
I'm gonna... I'm gonna feel really stupid.

820
01:08:56,663 --> 01:09:00,190
No, he didn't.

821
01:09:00,267 --> 01:09:02,758
India wouldn't be
far enough away, actually.

822
01:09:06,607 --> 01:09:08,734
Come inside. I'll explain.

823
01:09:08,809 --> 01:09:12,973
You sure? I mean,
about me coming in.

824
01:09:13,046 --> 01:09:16,743
Yes, very.

825
01:09:16,817 --> 01:09:19,945
So I left Fergus a message
from Seal Court,

826
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:22,989
which apparently
put him on our trail,

827
01:09:23,056 --> 01:09:27,618
and he came here looking for answers...
he and Cropper from the sound of it.

828
01:09:27,694 --> 01:09:30,390
So that was Cropper's
car outside?

829
01:09:30,464 --> 01:09:32,955
I think Fergus
has found something.

830
01:09:33,033 --> 01:09:35,558
He's been spooking
around the museum,

831
01:09:35,636 --> 01:09:39,333
sending out
a bunch of faxes.

832
01:09:39,406 --> 01:09:44,070
I wouldn't be
so quick to do that.

833
01:09:44,144 --> 01:09:46,578
Yeah.

834
01:09:48,048 --> 01:09:52,109
The British Museum
fax log sheet.

835
01:09:52,186 --> 01:09:55,087
"To the University of Muntz
from Fergus Wolfe.

836
01:09:55,155 --> 01:09:58,852
"Subject: Christabel LaMotte.
Information on LaMotte genealogy.

837
01:09:58,926 --> 01:10:03,192
Request loan of journal
of Sabine de Concasse."

838
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:05,493
Unfortunately for Fergus,
we have to log our faxes.

839
01:10:05,566 --> 01:10:08,626
You're shameless.

840
01:10:20,414 --> 01:10:23,042
So what are we
gonna do now?

841
01:10:23,116 --> 01:10:26,517
We gonna try to beat 'em
to France, or...

842
01:10:29,723 --> 01:10:32,556
or are we just
gonna stare at each other?

843
01:10:32,626 --> 01:10:34,856
That is the question,
isn't it?

844
01:10:34,928 --> 01:10:36,862
Mm-hmm.

845
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:39,524
- I have another one for you.
- What's that?

846
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,898
What are you really
doing here?

847
01:10:41,969 --> 01:10:44,870
Well, I, uh...

848
01:10:49,776 --> 01:10:51,710
I needed to see your face.

849
01:10:59,253 --> 01:11:03,952
I just want to let you know
that whatever happened in Whitby,

850
01:11:04,024 --> 01:11:07,926
which unfortunately
was not much,

851
01:11:10,664 --> 01:11:14,156
is not because
anything that you did.

852
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:18,304
Not at all.

853
01:11:21,008 --> 01:11:23,909
I just didn't want
to jump into something.

854
01:11:25,112 --> 01:11:29,947
I mean, I did
and I do... want to.

855
01:11:31,285 --> 01:11:33,276
Badly.

856
01:11:36,790 --> 01:11:39,953
I just didn't
want to mess this up.

857
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:46,588
And I just want to see...

858
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:52,264
I want to see if there's
an us in you and me.

859
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:59,872
Would-Would you like that?

860
01:12:09,423 --> 01:12:11,891
I'll take that
as a yes.

861
01:12:41,021 --> 01:12:46,084
Ah, oui. Excusez-moi.
Nous sommes confreres.

862
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:48,093
When will she be back?

863
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:52,362
Could you check for us?

864
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:21,723
- She will return on Thursday.
- Okay.

865
01:13:21,795 --> 01:13:23,729
Au revoir.
Merci.

866
01:13:23,797 --> 01:13:28,894
You and your shoplifting, huh?
I can't take you anywhere.

867
01:13:42,416 --> 01:13:47,285
Since I wrote to you last,
I've made another discovery.

868
01:13:47,354 --> 01:13:49,822
"Amongst Sabine's papers
was her journal...

869
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:53,917
"in which she writes about LaMotte's
visit to Brittany in 1859...

870
01:13:53,994 --> 01:13:57,430
and the subsequent arrival
of a mysterious visitor."

871
01:15:02,095 --> 01:15:07,431
I know how things are.
I wish to help you.

872
01:15:07,501 --> 01:15:10,265
You know how things are, do you?
Tell me, Cousin Sabine,

873
01:15:10,337 --> 01:15:13,795
how do you think
things are with me?

874
01:15:13,874 --> 01:15:16,001
I'm a grown woman.
You are a girl.

875
01:15:16,076 --> 01:15:18,340
I do not desire
any help from you.

876
01:15:26,686 --> 01:15:30,247
Christabel's condition
became worse...

877
01:15:30,323 --> 01:15:33,918
after she received word
from London...

878
01:15:33,994 --> 01:15:37,395
that her close friend
had died.

879
01:16:11,998 --> 01:16:14,967
She left England
because she was pregnant,

880
01:16:15,035 --> 01:16:16,969
and Blanche
committed suicide.

881
01:16:22,776 --> 01:16:24,835
What happened to the baby?

882
01:16:24,911 --> 01:16:27,402
It must have been stillborn.

883
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:29,414
Or died.

884
01:16:29,482 --> 01:16:31,712
Maybe it was taken in
by nuns or a local family.

885
01:16:31,785 --> 01:16:35,118
And brought up here.

886
01:16:35,188 --> 01:16:39,249
I'd like to think that,
but I wonder.

887
01:16:39,326 --> 01:16:43,524
- You wonder what?
- I don't know. I just...

888
01:16:43,597 --> 01:16:49,558
She comes here alone, hears
that Blanche has killed herself.

889
01:16:49,636 --> 01:16:51,831
She's pregnant, distraught.

890
01:16:54,774 --> 01:16:56,708
Geez.

891
01:16:56,776 --> 01:16:59,336
I mean, I've no
evidence for it.

892
01:16:59,412 --> 01:17:02,108
Can you imagine
how she must have felt?

893
01:17:03,516 --> 01:17:06,178
Yes, I can.

894
01:17:17,731 --> 01:17:20,928
So when do we see
Christabel next?

895
01:17:21,001 --> 01:17:25,404
Autumn, 1860, in her
references to the Vestal Lights.

896
01:17:25,472 --> 01:17:29,408
It was a group of women who used to
meet with mediums on a regular basis.

897
01:17:29,476 --> 01:17:33,572
Really? You know, Ash hated
spiritualists. Pretty openly.

898
01:17:33,647 --> 01:17:36,582
You think that's a connection
we're tracking down?

899
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,641
I don't know.

900
01:17:48,028 --> 01:17:51,657
Please, make a circle
with your hands.

901
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:59,104
Close your eyes.

902
01:18:04,477 --> 01:18:07,674
White earth. Valley.

903
01:18:07,747 --> 01:18:11,046
A waterfall.

904
01:18:11,117 --> 01:18:14,280
A child. Love.

905
01:18:14,354 --> 01:18:18,848
Two people. Deception.

906
01:18:18,925 --> 01:18:23,487
Letters. Two people.

907
01:18:24,931 --> 01:18:28,332
Words. Death.

908
01:18:28,401 --> 01:18:30,995
What have you done?

909
01:18:31,071 --> 01:18:33,869
A field.

910
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:36,909
Where is the child?

911
01:18:42,182 --> 01:18:46,118
What have you done
with the child?

912
01:18:46,186 --> 01:18:49,519
You have made
a murderess of me.

913
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:00,290
"I understood at the time
that Mr. Ash was inquiring...

914
01:19:00,366 --> 01:19:03,802
"after the spirit of
a departed child of his own,

915
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:06,862
"but I am told that
this could not be the case...

916
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:09,670
as Mr. Ash is childless."

917
01:19:14,347 --> 01:19:19,614
Was there any mention
of Heloise in your research?

918
01:19:19,686 --> 01:19:23,622
I don't know...
nor do I care.

919
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:26,454
Look, I've got to get back.

920
01:19:28,228 --> 01:19:33,165
What's going on? Nothing. I'm just
tired, that's all, so I should...

921
01:19:33,233 --> 01:19:35,599
Come on.
What's wrong, seriously?

922
01:19:37,203 --> 01:19:40,730
I don't actually want to
discover anything else about them.

923
01:19:40,807 --> 01:19:43,708
You know?

924
01:19:43,777 --> 01:19:47,076
I'm finding things out
that are just...

925
01:19:47,147 --> 01:19:51,049
It's horrible when you think about
it really... men and women together.

926
01:19:53,486 --> 01:19:56,387
She gave up her life,
didn't she?

927
01:19:56,456 --> 01:19:59,892
A perfectly decent life that I've always
admired. And for what? For nothing.

928
01:19:59,959 --> 01:20:02,587
No. Not nothing.

929
01:20:02,662 --> 01:20:07,725
Oh, really? For what then? A child who
died, a lover drowned, and to what end?

930
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:11,635
She and Ash,
my own parents...

931
01:20:11,704 --> 01:20:15,037
and every relationship
I've ever had...

932
01:20:15,108 --> 01:20:20,205
It's all doomed. We can't seem to
help but just tear each other apart.

933
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:24,444
Well, what about us? You didn't
include us. What about that?

934
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:27,552
Look, I...

935
01:20:29,122 --> 01:20:31,590
I can't think about
anything right now.

936
01:20:34,661 --> 01:20:36,595
So, okay.

937
01:20:36,663 --> 01:20:39,996
So this is the, uh... this is
the icy pull-back part then, huh?

938
01:20:40,066 --> 01:20:44,196
- What? - You know, you get close,
you pull away, you get...

939
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:46,636
I mean, this is part
of the pattern, right?

940
01:20:46,706 --> 01:20:51,109
- What are you talking about?
- Your fear of men mantra from Yorkshire.

941
01:20:51,177 --> 01:20:53,805
That's what
I'm talking about.

942
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,974
I get it. It's cool. If that's the way
you play it, that's the way play it.

943
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:59,484
Do you honestly believe that?

944
01:20:59,552 --> 01:21:04,854
Is that what you think
this is to me? A game? Is it?

945
01:21:09,429 --> 01:21:13,263
Well, finally, then, all this talk of
us really comes to nothing, doesn't it?

946
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:16,166
Yes, I guess you're right.
It's nothing.

947
01:21:53,206 --> 01:21:56,266
Dear Professor Blackadder:

948
01:21:56,342 --> 01:21:59,709
I did try to tell you
about my discovery before...

949
01:21:59,779 --> 01:22:02,714
but found that I couldn't.

950
01:22:02,782 --> 01:22:06,411
Please read these two letters,

951
01:22:06,486 --> 01:22:09,785
and you will begin
to understand.

952
01:22:09,856 --> 01:22:13,451
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

953
01:22:13,526 --> 01:22:17,121
Sincerely, Roland Michell.

954
01:22:33,246 --> 01:22:37,546
And it's well documented that Ellen
Ash set a box on Ash's coffin...

955
01:22:37,617 --> 01:22:39,778
a kind of sealed container.

956
01:22:39,852 --> 01:22:41,979
We'd always imagined
it was just trinkets,

957
01:22:42,055 --> 01:22:45,752
but in the light of Michell's discovery, who
knows what treasures might be buried there.

958
01:22:45,825 --> 01:22:48,726
That box is mine, isn't it?
It's my property.

959
01:22:48,795 --> 01:22:51,593
Once you get it from Lord Ash,
it's absolutely yours.

960
01:22:51,664 --> 01:22:53,962
Until then,
we keep it a secret.

961
01:22:54,033 --> 01:22:56,866
Any discovery amongst
Lord Ash's things,

962
01:22:56,936 --> 01:23:00,736
and, uh...
and I purchase it from you.

963
01:23:00,807 --> 01:23:03,742
It's all above board,
no one the wiser.

964
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:06,005
Cropper, are you
absolutely sure of that?

965
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:08,570
Listen.
Uh, where is it?

966
01:23:08,648 --> 01:23:10,775
Yeah. "I place this
letter in his hands,

967
01:23:10,850 --> 01:23:13,284
"and if ghouls
dig it up again,

968
01:23:13,353 --> 01:23:16,720
then perhaps justice will be done
when I am not here to see it."

969
01:23:26,299 --> 01:23:32,033
Dear Madam: We are older now
and my fires at last are out.

970
01:23:32,105 --> 01:23:35,905
I know that you are
more than aware of my name,

971
01:23:35,975 --> 01:23:39,672
but I find you must see it
in print one last time.

972
01:23:39,746 --> 01:23:44,206
It has been made known to me that
your husband is near to death,

973
01:23:44,283 --> 01:23:49,118
so I have writ down,
for his eyes only, some things.

974
01:23:49,188 --> 01:23:54,285
I find I cannot say what things
and have sealed the letter.

975
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:58,763
If you wish to read it,
it is in your hands,

976
01:23:58,831 --> 01:24:02,995
though I must hope that he
will see it first and decide.

977
01:24:03,069 --> 01:24:08,371
I have done great harm,
though I meant none to you.

978
01:25:02,628 --> 01:25:06,189
I'll see they get back,
no questions asked.

979
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,562
You're more enterprising
than I gave you credit for.

980
01:25:10,636 --> 01:25:12,729
Was there a compliment
in there somewhere?

981
01:25:12,805 --> 01:25:16,002
Hmm? Yes, probably.

982
01:25:18,177 --> 01:25:22,136
What I can't believe is Fergus
Wolfe conniving with Cropper.

983
01:25:22,215 --> 01:25:24,376
I thought I was
a better judge of men.

984
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:28,011
Well, see, that's where you went wrong.
You gave him credit for being one.

985
01:25:30,823 --> 01:25:33,621
Thank you.

986
01:25:37,163 --> 01:25:39,757
Hi.
Hi.

987
01:25:39,832 --> 01:25:42,357
Thank you for coming. Sure.

988
01:25:42,435 --> 01:25:46,633
I believe
that may be her.

989
01:25:46,706 --> 01:25:49,937
I, uh... I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

990
01:25:50,009 --> 01:25:53,604
No, listen. I lost it
totally. It wasn't you.

991
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:58,048
So, why don't we all
talk some strategy?

992
01:25:58,117 --> 01:26:00,847
Let me introduce you
to, uh... All right.

993
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:05,084
Professor Blackadder, Paola,
this is Dr. Bailey.

994
01:26:05,158 --> 01:26:07,649
Maud.
Maud.

995
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:10,093
How do you do?

996
01:26:10,163 --> 01:26:15,066
So, do we really think that Cropper's capable
of something like this, of robbing a grave?

997
01:26:20,406 --> 01:26:23,603
It's creepy, the idea
of opening a grave.

998
01:26:23,676 --> 01:26:25,610
Let's just keep going.

999
01:26:25,678 --> 01:26:28,977
Jesus.

1000
01:26:29,048 --> 01:26:32,506
"The moping owl does to the
moon complain." Complain.

1001
01:26:34,854 --> 01:26:37,186
Are you ready?

1002
01:26:37,256 --> 01:26:40,453
Yeah.
Hold the light up.

1003
01:26:57,276 --> 01:27:00,177
Fergus! Fergus!
Is that it?

1004
01:27:00,246 --> 01:27:03,647
Yes. It's gotta be.

1005
01:27:03,716 --> 01:27:07,117
I found it, Fergus.
I found it.

1006
01:27:13,993 --> 01:27:18,692
Oh, my God.
I found it, Fergus.

1007
01:27:18,764 --> 01:27:20,664
Great!

1008
01:27:22,235 --> 01:27:25,227
Hey, Cropper!
Cropper!

1009
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:34,208
This has nothing
to do with you people.

1010
01:27:42,722 --> 01:27:46,385
Wait! Get off of me! Get off of me!

1011
01:27:46,459 --> 01:27:49,394
No you don't!

1012
01:27:49,462 --> 01:27:52,488
Traitor! Bloody conniver! Please!

1013
01:27:56,168 --> 01:27:57,931
Wait!

1014
01:27:59,672 --> 01:28:03,506
What are you doin'?

1015
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:22,022
Oh, shit.

1016
01:28:26,098 --> 01:28:28,293
Are you sure
we should be doing this?

1017
01:28:28,367 --> 01:28:30,927
I told Blackadder
we'd just take a look...

1018
01:28:31,003 --> 01:28:33,631
before we handed it over
to the museum.

1019
01:28:33,706 --> 01:28:36,197
Can you hold that there?

1020
01:28:53,326 --> 01:28:55,886
Maud, look at this.

1021
01:29:11,711 --> 01:29:13,941
It's her handwriting.

1022
01:29:42,274 --> 01:29:45,675
"My dear, my dear:

1023
01:29:45,745 --> 01:29:48,145
"They tell me
you are very ill.

1024
01:29:48,214 --> 01:29:51,081
"Perhaps I am wrong
to disturb you at this time...

1025
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:54,950
"with unseasonable memories,

1026
01:29:55,020 --> 01:30:00,390
"but I find I have, after all,
a thing which I must tell you.

1027
01:30:02,094 --> 01:30:04,756
"You will say it should have
been told 20 years ago,

1028
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:07,799
"but I could, or would, not.

1029
01:30:09,268 --> 01:30:11,896
"You have a daughter...

1030
01:30:13,205 --> 01:30:15,935
"who is well and married...

1031
01:30:16,008 --> 01:30:19,136
"and the mother
of a beautiful boy.

1032
01:30:19,211 --> 01:30:21,975
"I've sent you a picture.

1033
01:30:26,986 --> 01:30:30,183
"You will see she resembles
both her parents,

1034
01:30:30,256 --> 01:30:33,885
"neither of whom she knows
to be her parent.

1035
01:30:33,959 --> 01:30:39,556
"When I said at that terrible séance
that you had made a murderess of me,

1036
01:30:39,632 --> 01:30:44,399
"I was speaking of poor Blanche,
who then torments me daily,

1037
01:30:45,671 --> 01:30:49,163
"and I thought,
'Let him think so then...

1038
01:30:49,241 --> 01:30:51,766
"if he knows me so little.'

1039
01:30:53,779 --> 01:30:56,043
"I had a secret fear, you see.

1040
01:30:56,115 --> 01:30:58,549
"I was afraid that
you would wish to take her...

1041
01:30:58,617 --> 01:31:01,051
"you and your wife...
for your own.

1042
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:03,418
But I could not let her go."

1043
01:31:03,489 --> 01:31:06,754
Over here.

1044
01:31:06,826 --> 01:31:08,885
And so I hid her from you...

1045
01:31:08,961 --> 01:31:11,429
and you from her.

1046
01:31:12,932 --> 01:31:16,424
She loves her adoptive
parents most deeply.

1047
01:31:16,502 --> 01:31:19,096
Me, she does not love.

1048
01:31:19,171 --> 01:31:24,404
So I am punished now, living at Seal
Court with them and watching her grow.

1049
01:31:24,477 --> 01:31:27,776
I have been angry
for so long...

1050
01:31:27,847 --> 01:31:29,974
with all of us,

1051
01:31:30,049 --> 01:31:32,347
and now, near the end,

1052
01:31:32,418 --> 01:31:36,081
I think of you again
with clear love.

1053
01:31:36,155 --> 01:31:39,124
Did we not...

1054
01:31:39,191 --> 01:31:43,560
Did you not flame
and I catch fire?

1055
01:31:43,629 --> 01:31:46,860
Was not the love
that we found...

1056
01:31:46,932 --> 01:31:49,730
worth the tempest
that it brewed?

1057
01:31:49,802 --> 01:31:53,602
I feel it was.
I know it was.

1058
01:31:53,672 --> 01:31:58,405
"If you are able or willing, please
send me a sign that you have read this.

1059
01:31:58,477 --> 01:32:02,914
"I dare not ask
if you forgive.

1060
01:32:04,049 --> 01:32:06,313
Christabel LaMotte."

1061
01:32:09,522 --> 01:32:12,457
Ash had never read this.

1062
01:32:12,525 --> 01:32:15,426
He never knew
he had a child.

1063
01:32:15,494 --> 01:32:19,021
You're descended from both
Christabel and Ash.

1064
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:25,167
My God.

1065
01:32:25,237 --> 01:32:31,005
All these clues,
they're for you.

1066
01:32:32,945 --> 01:32:34,970
For us.

1067
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:50,485
You're so beautiful.

1068
01:33:20,926 --> 01:33:26,193
There are things that happen,
not spoken or written of.

1069
01:33:26,265 --> 01:33:28,961
A poet walked out
one summer's day...

1070
01:33:29,034 --> 01:33:32,435
seeking forgiveness
from a love long lost.

1071
01:33:33,939 --> 01:33:36,635
He found
something else instead.

1072
01:33:38,077 --> 01:33:40,841
This is how it was.

1073
01:33:49,154 --> 01:33:52,214
Morning.
Good morning.

1074
01:33:52,291 --> 01:33:54,225
What's your name?

1075
01:33:54,293 --> 01:33:58,696
May Bailey, but I have
another name I don't like.

1076
01:33:58,764 --> 01:34:03,758
Do you? What's that?

1077
01:34:03,836 --> 01:34:06,202
Maya Thomason Bailey.

1078
01:34:11,744 --> 01:34:13,735
Well...

1079
01:34:16,048 --> 01:34:19,950
Maya was the, uh...

1080
01:34:20,019 --> 01:34:22,715
the mother of Hermes,

1081
01:34:22,788 --> 01:34:25,052
and I know a waterfall
called Thomason.

1082
01:34:25,124 --> 01:34:28,423
A waterfall? Really?
Yes.

1083
01:34:28,494 --> 01:34:33,898
In Yorkshire. With a lovely
cave hidden behind it.

1084
01:34:36,001 --> 01:34:37,935
Where do you live?

1085
01:34:38,003 --> 01:34:39,971
I live in that house
down there.

1086
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:43,736
And my mother lives there
and my father...

1087
01:34:43,809 --> 01:34:45,834
and my two brothers.

1088
01:34:45,911 --> 01:34:48,573
Oh, and my Aunt Christabel too.

1089
01:34:50,349 --> 01:34:52,977
Yes, I think
I know your mother.

1090
01:34:56,722 --> 01:34:59,088
You have
the true look of her.

1091
01:34:59,158 --> 01:35:04,255
No one else says that.
I think I look like my father.

1092
01:35:06,198 --> 01:35:08,689
You look like
your father too.

1093
01:35:11,403 --> 01:35:13,667
Can you make daisy chains?

1094
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:16,606
Yes.

1095
01:35:19,445 --> 01:35:22,414
Yes, I'll make you a crown.

1096
01:35:24,249 --> 01:35:29,084
But, um... will you
give me a lock of your hair?

1097
01:35:30,889 --> 01:35:33,551
Like fairy story.

1098
01:35:35,394 --> 01:35:37,624
Just so.

1099
01:35:48,707 --> 01:35:52,643
Now, would you
take this note...

1100
01:35:52,711 --> 01:35:55,009
to your aunt.

1101
01:35:56,648 --> 01:35:59,549
Tell her that
you saw a poet...

1102
01:35:59,618 --> 01:36:01,984
who was coming
to meet her...

1103
01:36:02,054 --> 01:36:04,284
but met you instead.

1104
01:36:04,356 --> 01:36:06,483
I'll try to remember.

1105
01:36:08,293 --> 01:36:10,284
Thank you.
