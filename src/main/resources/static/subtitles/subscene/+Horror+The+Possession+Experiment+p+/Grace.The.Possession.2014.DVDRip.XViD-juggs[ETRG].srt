Goddamn. Vodka.

Take your time.

165
00:15:56,302 --> 00:16:00,830
Now, we were talking about love.

166
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:02,702
- Hi.
- Hi.

167
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:06,174
lt seems to me that an awful lot of you
really believe in it.

168
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,907
Well, l hate to break it to you,
especially the ladies,

169
00:16:12,084 --> 00:16:16,714
but love is merely a byproduct
of evolution.

170
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:22,053
And over the course of this term,
we앏l be learning about how

171
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:26,562
all of our behaviors when it comes
to sex, whether it be cheating

172
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:32,295
or jealousy, monogamy,
are all motivated by simple biology.

173
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:39,174
And we앏l get into that
over the course of this term.

174
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,444
Go long! Go long!

175
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:43,741
Yeah.

176
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,178
Yes.

00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:50,347
My God. You did it.
That is awesome.

178
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:51,820

179
00:16:51,991 --> 00:16:54,255

Why would you do that?

Do you even know what it feels like
to be touched, little girl?

305
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:01,962
Just like your mother.

306
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,862
How do you know about my mom?

307
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:06,436

That압 fucked up for you to do.

Any pain?

331
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:51,801
What happened?
Were still trying to figure that out.

332
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:53,968
You lost consciousness.

333
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:56,811
Jessica. ls she okay?

334
00:28:56,982 --> 00:28:59,849
Who?
The-- The girl that fell.

335
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:01,417
She--

336
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,619
Did you take anything?

337
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,589
Other than alcohol?

338
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,125
No.

339
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:12,960
You on any medication?

340
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,325
No.

341
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:18,196
- Has this ever happened to you before?
- No.

342
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,838
What about family? Follow me.

343
00:29:21,006 --> 00:29:22,871
What do you mean?

344
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,532
Any history of mental illness?

345
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:29,278
My mother was on antipsychotics.

346
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:31,609
What압 her condition like now?

347
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,481
She died.

348
00:29:33,652 --> 00:29:34,949
How?

349
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:37,382
Giving birth to me.

350
00:29:37,556 --> 00:29:39,888
And your father?

351
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:42,983
l-- l never knew him.

352
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:45,086
l앐 sorry.

353
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:51,959
Well, aside from a nasty bump
on the head, you appear to be fine.

354
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:55,766
But l should tell you
mental lllness is often hereditary.

355
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:58,273
Early diagnosis and treatment
are critical.

356
00:29:58,443 --> 00:30:01,412
So l recommend you see
a psychiatrist as soon as you can.

357
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,343
You understand me?

358
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:06,441
Yes.
Good.

359
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:12,785
Wait, is there a phone l can use?

360
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:16,860
lf youre looking for your ride, we already
called your emergency contact.

361
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:41,311
Coming up,

362
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:43,511
we have a nasty stretch
of weather coming your way.

363
00:30:43,688 --> 00:30:46,418
Break out the umbrellas
as it is going to be wet.

364
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,030
Did you have sex?

365
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:55,797
No.

366
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:57,328
Don앖 lie to me.

367
00:30:57,502 --> 00:31:01,165
l앐 not lying.
And look at me when you answer.

368
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:04,838
l앐 not lying.

369
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,337
Okay.

370
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:14,545
But you drank?

371
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:17,681
Yes.
Yes, of course.

372
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:20,753
l앐 sorry.

373
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,297
l think l need to see a doctor.

374
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:30,798
Grace. Why?

375
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:34,029
Because l앐 worried
l might be sick like Mom was.

376
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:36,572
Now압 not the time for making excuses.

377
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:42,111
l앐 not. The doctor told me--
l don앖 care what the doctor told you.

378
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,147
Your mother suffered
from sickness of the soul.

379
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:49,048
That is not something a doctor can fix.

380
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,119
Pull your skirt down.

381
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:01,864
There압 a jacket in the back,
and l want you to put it on.

382
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:06,368
l don앖 want them seeing you
in that clown suit.

383
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:08,005
Who?

384
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,039
Get in here.

385
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:19,206
Coffee압 ready.

386
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:27,754
Come on in, Grace.
Don앖 be rude, say hello.

387
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:30,886
Hello, Father John.

388
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:32,620
Have a seat.

389
00:32:37,736 --> 00:32:40,830
You look more like your mother
every time l see you.

390
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:43,436
l guess so.

391
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:50,338
l want you to meet the newest member
of our congregation.

392
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:54,576
He comes to us
from St. James Seminary.

393
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:57,244
lt압 good to finally meet you, Grace.

394
00:32:57,422 --> 00:32:59,322
You as well, Father.

395
00:32:59,491 --> 00:33:02,517
Well, l앐 still a deacon.

396
00:33:02,694 --> 00:33:06,721
But l plan on taking my vow
to priesthood very soon.

397
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:09,799
With Father John압 approval,
of course.

398
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:11,959
There you go, Father.

399
00:33:13,305 --> 00:33:14,738
Yes.

400
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,333
Well, until he압 ready,

401
00:33:20,578 --> 00:33:23,069
Luke will be assisting me

402
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:26,684
with those who need guidance.

403
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,723
Now that youre back, l expect you앏l be
spending more time with the church.

404
00:33:34,626 --> 00:33:36,355
Um...

405
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:39,155
Actually, l앐 just gonna be here
for a few days,

406
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:41,196
and then l앐 gonna go back.

407
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:45,326
What?

408
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:48,662
Youre not going back.

409
00:33:49,507 --> 00:33:51,304
Wh--? Wh--?

410
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:53,944
l pulled you out of school.

411
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:55,773
Why would you do that?

412
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:57,505
lt압 done, Grace.

413
00:33:57,682 --> 00:34:00,207
But--
Not another word.

414
00:34:00,985 --> 00:34:04,352
Home is where you need to be right now.

415
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:24,133
Don앖 you speak of it.

416
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:25,734
Understand? Not a word.

417
00:35:27,272 --> 00:35:28,739
Hello?

418
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:31,736
Grandma?

419
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,502
Keep quiet.

420
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,710
Listen to yourself.

421
00:35:46,224 --> 00:35:48,488
- Grace!
- Grandma.

422
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,094
You know to keep away from there.

423
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:53,822
Grandma, there압 somebody in there.

424
00:35:53,998 --> 00:35:57,024
Ridiculous. Nobody압 been
in your mother압 room for years.

425
00:35:57,202 --> 00:36:00,035
What?
Go back to your room.

426
00:36:00,205 --> 00:36:03,663
No, but, Grandma,
l heard somebody in there.

427
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:05,901
Grace, now!

428
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,979
Grace.

429
00:36:11,716 --> 00:36:16,085
You stay away from that room,
do you understand me?

430
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:17,846
Yes.

431
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,610
Come on, come on.

432
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,037
Pick up.

433
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:44,340
Is that Grace?

434
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:45,573
Give me that.

435
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,445
- Let me talk to her.
- Hang up.

436
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:48,983
Hello?

437
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:49,164
Grandma?

438
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:52,063
What?

439
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:09,218
Who are you?

440
00:40:12,223 --> 00:40:14,623
Who are you?

441
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:17,050
Make him suffer.

442
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,949
Grace, you better be
getting ready in there.

443
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:47,488
- Grace, do you hear me?
- Yes.

444
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:04,428
- Do l look all right?
- Yeah.

445
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:10,874
Don앖 embarrass me today.
l won앖.

446
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:13,670
But really l앐 just excited
to wear the fancy robes.

447
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:19,039
Did Alicia tell you
were starting up a youth group?

448
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:20,844
L see.

449
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:25,381
- Good morning.
- Morning.

450
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:30,493
Paul. Paul.

451
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:32,189
l have your favorite

452
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:34,695
Chocolate chip cookies.
No, no.

453
00:42:40,004 --> 00:42:43,132
Margaret, Margaret.
Look at you.

454
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:45,400
You look beautiful.

455
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:47,737
Would you--?
Would you care for a sweet?

456
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:51,473
lt압 a little too early for cookies, dear.

457
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:54,845
Lt압 never too early for sweetness.

458
00:42:59,457 --> 00:43:00,947
Um...

459
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:04,459
Where should l put these?

460
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:07,592
Grandma?

461
00:43:08,499 --> 00:43:10,797
ls everything okay?

462
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:13,864
Give me those.

463
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:19,974
Let temptation into your heart

464
00:43:20,144 --> 00:43:22,977
and the devil will destroy it!

465
00:43:25,016 --> 00:43:27,211
We all feel it, every day.

466
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:30,752
Satan압 grasp, calling us,

467
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:35,689
asking us to betray God
for earthly pleasures.

468
00:43:37,161 --> 00:43:40,858
The Bible teaches us to reject this call.

469
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:43,830
To ignore this temptation.

470
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:48,099
But who among us is without sin?

471
00:43:51,475 --> 00:43:55,468
lt압 easy to convince yourself
that youre walking the righteous path.

472
00:43:55,646 --> 00:43:58,547
That you have remained untainted.

473
00:43:59,483 --> 00:44:02,316
Sin is like an open wound.

474
00:44:03,254 --> 00:44:06,246
Left alone, it festers.

475
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:09,882
Spreads, grows before your very eyes.

476
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:16,133
That is why we must confront
our mistakes,

477
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,131
correct them.

478
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:22,068
Grace.

479
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:23,604
Stop it.

480
00:44:23,774 --> 00:44:27,608
Restore the purity of our souls.

481
00:44:29,146 --> 00:44:32,843
lt is the only way into heaven.

482
00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:36,883
Let us pray.

483
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,520
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.

484
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:45,359
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.

485
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:50,431
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.

486
00:44:54,772 --> 00:44:57,673
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.

487
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:27,200
What압 wrong with her?

488
00:45:28,105 --> 00:45:29,163
Grace?

489
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,739
Grace.

490
00:45:32,877 --> 00:45:35,471
You are in church. How dare you?

491
00:45:35,646 --> 00:45:37,807
She압 so sorry.

492
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:41,778
Out. Out. Out.

493
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:48,953
l don앖 know
what has gotten into you.

494
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:54,056
ls this because l took you
out of school?

495
00:45:54,231 --> 00:45:57,530
ls this some sick game youre playing
to hurt your grandmother?

496
00:45:57,701 --> 00:46:00,966
No.
Well, then, what is the problem?

497
00:46:06,143 --> 00:46:09,510
l았e-- l았e been hearing things.

498
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,912
There압 voices inside my head,
and l just...

499
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:17,911
l keep having these nightmares.

500
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,623
But they feel so real

501
00:46:20,791 --> 00:46:25,694
and l앐 just a little scared
to fall asleep.

502
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:28,725
l need to know what happened
to my mother.

503
00:46:28,899 --> 00:46:30,127
Don앖 start, Grace.

504
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:33,270
Everyone said she went crazy.
Drop it. l said drop it.

505
00:46:33,437 --> 00:46:37,635
What if the same thing
is happening to me? l need help.

506
00:46:37,808 --> 00:46:42,336
Your mother disobeyed me,
ran off and got pregnant.

507
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:45,012
You do not need help.

508
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:48,343
You need God.

509
00:50:17,561 --> 00:50:19,290
Mama.

510
00:51:06,877 --> 00:51:08,310
How did you get in there?

511
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:13,583
The-- The door was open.

512
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:15,514
No, it wasn앖.

513
00:51:17,054 --> 00:51:20,615
l told you to stay away
from her room.

514
00:51:22,092 --> 00:51:24,185
l앐-- l앐 sorry.

515
00:51:28,065 --> 00:51:30,295
- What was that?
- What?

516
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:33,265
- That noise?
- Nothing.

517
00:51:34,605 --> 00:51:36,402
- What do you have?
- Nothing.

518
00:51:36,573 --> 00:51:38,973
What압 behind your back?
Nothing.

519
00:51:39,143 --> 00:51:40,508
You show it to me.

520
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:42,838
Leave me alone.
l앐 not gonna ask again.

521
00:51:43,013 --> 00:51:45,277
Grace! Grace!

522
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:47,076
You show me what압 in there!

523
00:51:47,251 --> 00:51:49,981
No!
Show me what압 in there.

524
00:51:51,422 --> 00:51:53,982
Grace! You keep this up,

525
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:56,422
youre gonna be just like your mother.

526
00:51:57,027 --> 00:52:00,121
- Leave me alone!
- Open this door!

527
00:52:00,297 --> 00:52:03,528
Grace!
You stubborn, disobedient child!

528
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,998
You open this goddamn door right now!

529
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,297
You are a bastard child!

530
00:52:08,472 --> 00:52:10,838
Did you know that? A bastard!

531
00:52:11,008 --> 00:52:12,999
You should have never been born!

532
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:15,907
Your only father you ever had was God!

533
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,015
You are just as simple
as your goddamn mother!

534
00:52:20,184 --> 00:52:22,744
l hate you! l hate you!

535
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,480
l hate you!

536
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:47,771
Morning, sunshine.

537

572
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:51,152
Your mother fought with me to leave

Stranger?

You must understand,
the needs of the flesh are very real.

579
00:56:11,214 --> 00:56:14,877
The trials of life,
you are gonna experience.

00:56:15,052 --> 00:56:19,785
But in this room, we can talk about it

The desires of the flesh.

Now, l know it압--
lt압 a tough conversation,

589
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:43,044

And remember,
it압 not temptation that압 the sin.

591
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:50,051
lt압 how you deal with the temptation.

592
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,620
Does anybody want to share?

593
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:54,681

601
00:57:14,911 --> 00:57:17,744

making the same mistakes
that she did.

603
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,374
Okay, Sally--
Or,

604

01:10:57,533 --> 01:11:00,627
l recommend you keep your distance.

718
01:11:06,309 --> 01:11:07,936
She압 awake.

719
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:16,018
Luke?
Grace.

720
01:11:16,185 --> 01:11:19,780
Do not look at him.
You will answer to me only.

721
01:11:20,423 --> 01:11:21,754
Who are you?

722
01:11:21,924 --> 01:11:25,257
l앐 Bishop Michael,
and l앐 here to help you.

723
01:11:26,062 --> 01:11:27,552
What?

724
01:11:31,133 --> 01:11:33,226
Why am l tied down?

725
01:11:33,402 --> 01:11:35,495
Show me the mark.

726
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:39,668
Luke? What--?

727
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:42,709
What are you doing? Stop it.

728
01:11:47,717 --> 01:11:49,309
Please.

729
01:11:52,154 --> 01:11:53,815
Please.

730
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,419
Why are you doing this?

731
01:11:58,594 --> 01:12:00,061
Grace,

732
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:04,165
if this is in fact Grace
that l앐 speaking to,

733
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:11,205
the symbol you possess is a mark
of a dark servant, a demon.

734
01:12:13,643 --> 01:12:15,304
What does that mean?

735
01:12:15,478 --> 01:12:18,606
lt means you are losing possession
of your soul.

736
01:12:19,115 --> 01:12:20,480
What?

737
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:26,352
What압 gonna happen to me?

738
01:12:26,989 --> 01:12:32,985
Grace, the ritual youre about
to experience is very dangerous.

739
01:12:33,162 --> 01:12:38,031
You must understand that l will do
everything in my power to save you.

740
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,327
What are you gonna do?

741
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:48,569
No, please, no.

742
01:12:53,115 --> 01:12:58,314
l speak now directly to the evil
hiding in this body.

743
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:00,482
Reveal yourself.

744
01:13:00,656 --> 01:13:01,918
But l am Grace.

745
01:13:02,091 --> 01:13:04,321
Evil cannot hide in the house of God.

746
01:13:04,493 --> 01:13:06,791
Please, please just let me go.

747
01:13:06,962 --> 01:13:09,590
l feel better. l feel so much better.

748
01:13:11,934 --> 01:13:15,597
- Please, please stop!
- That압 enough. Youre hurting her.

749
01:13:24,146 --> 01:13:26,376
lt압 not Grace that l앐 hurting.

750
01:13:26,549 --> 01:13:28,039
Please.

751
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:35,285
Brothers, we should begin the ritual,
as we았e discussed.

752
01:13:37,093 --> 01:13:40,062
l didn앖 do anything wrong.

753
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,058
Please.

754
01:13:50,473 --> 01:13:52,771
Youre hurting me.

755
01:13:53,476 --> 01:13:56,240
See the cross of the Lord.

756
01:13:56,412 --> 01:14:01,247
Be gone your hostile powers which have
assaulted this servant of God

757
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:03,681
and clouded her with terror.

758
01:14:03,853 --> 01:14:07,550
l cast you out, unclean spirit,

759
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:10,749
along with every satanic power
of the enemy

760
01:14:10,926 --> 01:14:14,123
every apparition from hell
and all your legion,

761
01:14:14,296 --> 01:14:16,230
in the name of Jesus Christ.

762
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:18,127
The Lord be with you

763
01:14:18,334 --> 01:14:21,167
and with your spirits.

764
01:14:25,474 --> 01:14:27,908
For he himself commands you.

765
01:14:28,077 --> 01:14:32,241
He who cast you from the heights
of heaven to the depths of hell.

766
01:14:32,414 --> 01:14:34,109
No one commands me.

767
01:14:34,283 --> 01:14:36,478
Tremble in fear, Satan.

768
01:14:36,652 --> 01:14:38,415
Enemy of the faith.

769
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:41,647
Foe of the human race.
Begetter of death.

770
01:14:41,824 --> 01:14:44,588
Depart, persecutor of the innocent.

771
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:49,527
Depart. For you are guilty
before almighty God.

772
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:53,160
Lord, hear our prayer.

773
01:14:53,335 --> 01:14:56,463
Our cries come before you.

774
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:03,674
ln the name of the spotless lamb,

775
01:15:04,613 --> 01:15:09,107
l adjure you, ancient serpents,

776
01:15:09,285 --> 01:15:14,621
the judge of the living and the dead,
and your creator,

777
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:19,989
he who has the power
to resign you to darkness

778
01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:24,121
that you depart posthaste.

779
01:15:25,534 --> 01:15:27,934
Your soul is marked, priest.

780
01:15:28,103 --> 01:15:30,537
You broke your vow.
Stop.

781
01:15:31,407 --> 01:15:32,465
Silence, silence!

782
01:15:32,641 --> 01:15:34,575
God has forsaken you.

783
01:15:36,011 --> 01:15:38,639
Eternal suffering awaits you.

784
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:49,823
What have you done?

785
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:17,312
Hold her down!

786
01:16:35,037 --> 01:16:37,164
Go, go.

787
01:16:37,907 --> 01:16:40,501
Christ the Lord brings your plans
to nothing!

788
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:42,769
Fear him!

789
01:16:43,545 --> 01:16:46,946
Crucified as man,
yet triumphed over the powers of hell.

790
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:18,871
You cannot run from your sins, priest.

791
01:17:24,219 --> 01:17:26,847
You raped her mother,

792
01:17:27,022 --> 01:17:29,650
abandoned her...

793
01:17:32,995 --> 01:17:37,591
...and left a child for me to take.

794
01:17:39,969 --> 01:17:43,871
Too long have you gone unpunished.

795
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:48,138
l am your retribution.

796
01:17:55,551 --> 01:17:58,850
Do with me what you will.

797
01:17:59,021 --> 01:18:01,819
l go to the hands of God.

798
01:18:03,292 --> 01:18:05,453
Let압 see if he catches you!

799
01:18:24,046 --> 01:18:25,673
Devil!

800
01:18:25,848 --> 01:18:28,578
l command you to leave her.

801
01:18:29,284 --> 01:18:31,616
You can free her,

802
01:18:31,987 --> 01:18:36,981
but only through death!

803
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:48,926
l will not murder for you.

804
01:18:57,212 --> 01:18:58,907
Very well.

805
01:18:59,715 --> 01:19:01,683
Wait, stop.

806
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:08,349
Take me instead.

807
01:19:10,726 --> 01:19:14,025
You give yourself willingly?

808
01:19:14,196 --> 01:19:17,063
Only if you let her live.

809
01:19:19,168 --> 01:19:22,604
Her soul for a priest압?

810
01:19:22,771 --> 01:19:25,331
A worthy trade.

811
01:20:13,088 --> 01:20:14,578
Luke?

812
01:20:16,258 --> 01:20:17,816
Are you okay?

813
01:20:17,993 --> 01:20:20,757
No, go away.

814
01:20:23,866 --> 01:20:25,561
Wait.

815
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:27,895
l앐 sor-- sorry.

816
01:20:30,072 --> 01:20:33,235
Please, please.

817
01:20:33,408 --> 01:20:35,467
You have to go.

818
01:20:38,814 --> 01:20:40,714
Go!

819
01:21:19,354 --> 01:21:22,721
Father, were ready for you.

820
01:21:55,057 --> 01:22:00,051
Hallelujah

821
01:22:06,301 --> 01:22:10,032
Hallelujah

822
01:22:14,843 --> 01:22:19,109
ln the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

823
01:22:19,281 --> 01:22:20,714
Amen.

824
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:23,314
Let us pray.
