1
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,500
Close your eyes - They're closed.

2
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,520
Are you sure?
- Yeah. - Positive?

3
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Okay, open them now.

4
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,640
Look at it! It's great!.

5
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,160
Hey, what do you think Montelli?

6
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,080
Daddy, look at the lake.
- Come on, Mark, let's go to the lake.

7
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,480
Come on, Mark. Let's go!

8
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,880
Oh, look, a motorboat.
It's so nice. I love it!

9
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,160
Hey, kids!

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,200
That's dangerous.

11
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,920
I don't want to see you near the edge.

12
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,320
Do you understand?

13
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,920
Yeah.

14
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,080
What?

15
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,280
Yes, sir!

16
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,120
Oh, look at it!

17
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,640
It's ours, it's ours.

18
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,360
<i>Be it ever so ...
- Stop! - What? - One, two, three ...</i>

19
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,680
<i>Be it ever so humble ...
there's no place like home.</i>

20
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,181
What's this? The Andrew's sisters?

21
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,520
Hi, Daddy. - Yes.
- Where's Sonny?

22
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,400
He's right behind us.
He should be here in a minute.

23
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,360
I thought I told you to stay together.
- Home, sweet home.

24
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,240
Daddy's such a creep.

25
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,680
Be respectful.

26
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,360
Hey Dad.

27
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,880
New car is fantastic.

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,160
You should have see it at
the red light. A guy was
stepping on the accelerator.

29
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,920
So, I put pedal to the metal ...

30
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,240
You should've seen it. It was fantastic!

31
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,120
I left the guy miles ...
- Where the hell were you?

32
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
I told you to back up your mother.

33
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,240
She knows the way.
- Don't be smart, boy.
You’re not too big for a whipping.

34
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,680
I know. You proved that to me.
- Okay.

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,640
You're pushing it.

36
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,840
You're right on the edge.
- I just stopped at the corner for cigarettes.
- Stop your whining.

37
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,160
You're gonna be a man by
smoking cigarettes, now, you're
growing a little fuzz over here?

38
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,120
Learn, how to take some orders.

39
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,800
Do you hear me?

40
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,960
I didn't hear you.

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,120
Yes, sir.

42
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,120
I'm so excited.

43
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,440
Tricia, look at that fireplace.
Look at that staircase!

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,240
Hey ... these windows are stuck.

45
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,160
They're nailed.

46
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,560
Wow! this is a mansion.

47
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,200
Oh, what's going on? What's
this? Peggy Fleming?
- The first and last time you skate in here.

48
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,420
I wonder what idiot nailed all
these windows shut.

49
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:39,521
- Ah, goddamn it. They nailed every window
upstairs the same way. - Oh, no.

50
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,800
I have a good mind to call that
asshole Real Estate guy.

51
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,360
It's here! It's here!

52
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,000
Hello.

53
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,880
What do you think you're doing?

54
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,320
I'm going to introduce you to your new room.
If you don't watch, I'm gonna fall on you.

55
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,080
No nails here. Over.

56
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,280
Isn't it great?

57
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,000
Ah, it's all right.

58
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,600
I love it.

59
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,320
You're getting heavy.

60
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,480
Hey, you used to hug me all the time.
- That was when you were lighter.
- It's 'cause now you're old and snotty.

61
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,640
Well, there is another reason.
- What?

62
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,000
You're not my type.

63
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,200
You like them tall?

64
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,800
Big boobs, right?
- That's none of your business.

65
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,880
How about you? What's your type?

66
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,200
I like them ... sensitive, dark,
and about this high.
- You're ridiculous. - No!

67
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:48,920
Come on.

68
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,600
Let's get to know the house.

69
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,320
Can you feel it?

70
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,280
Yeah.

71
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,320
I was wondering, if there was a girl
here before, like me.

72
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,240
And she was in love with a boy.

73
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah.

74
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,680
But she was unhappy.

75
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,640
Unhappy?

76
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,520
The boy didn't love her.

77
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,120
Why?

78
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,000
Because she was ugly, like you.
- Oh, stupid.

79
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,760
Just ... put that down over there.

80
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,840
Anywhere?

81
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,760
They're my husband's guns.
You better put them in the closet.

82
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,440
Hey, lady.

83
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,400
Looks like you got another room in here.

84
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,400
The realtor didn't tell us about that.

85
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,920
Want me to check it out for you?
- Would you please? - Sure.

86
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,920
Great.

87
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,200
Oh, here's a light over here.

88
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,560
This is a really good one.
- All right. Thank you.

89
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,360
You gotta problem in here, lady.

90
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,400
Must be a busted sewer line or something.

91
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,840
Oh, my.

92
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,560
Lady, it stinks in here.

93
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,160
Hey, are you all right?

94
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,240
Come on out of there.

95
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,240
Oh, my goodness. Oh. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

96
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,040
Oh, what happened?
What is that on your shirt?
- Shit.. Excuse me, ma'am.

97
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,720
There's a lot of flies, a lot of mud.
a lot of everything in there.

98
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,040
If I was you, I'd stay out of there.
- Oh, I'm sorry I had you go in there.
Listen, take this towel ...

99
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,240
and go upstairs and wash up.
There's soap and stuff upstairs.
- Okay, thank you. - Watch out for your head.

100
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,640
Mom? Did I scare you?

101
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,120
Somebody ...

102
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,280
touched me.

103
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,520
What?

104
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,760
Somebody ... touched me.
- Who touched you?

105
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,560
Somebody.

106
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Here.

107
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,680
Now.

108
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,920
You mean you actually felt somebody's hand?

109
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,360
It felt like ...

110
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,800
like ...

111
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,320
like fingers on my arm.

112
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,520
Mom, it must be your imagination.

113
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,720
You put the fork here, stupid.

114
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,120
Shut up. - Don't tell me shut up.
- Come on children, that’s enough.

115
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,840
Sit down, everybody.

116
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,800
Anthony did you wash your hands?

117
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,760
What do you think?

118
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,880
I think we're a very lucky family.

119
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,160
Let's eat. Come on. It's getting cold.

120
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,760
Pass me the string beans.
- Pass me the spaghetti.

121
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,640
Haven't we forgotten something?

122
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,080
Heavenly Father ...

123
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,480
bless our new home.

124
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,880
And watch over us as we become
a part of this community.

125
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,960
We thank thee for this food.

126
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,760
Bless it for the nourishment of our bodies and ...

127
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,480
Goddamn! - Don't even look at me,
I didn't put that mirror up there

128
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:27,181
- No Daddy! - Why does
he always blame me ...

129
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,640
Stop it!

130
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,880
Can't we just eat our first meal
in this house without fighting?

131
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,120
All everybody's been doing
ever since we got here, is fighting!

132
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,160
All right I had enough of it with you!

133
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,120
I don't want to hear any more of it!

134
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,000
Look ...

135
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,880
It's not even broken.

136
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,040
All right, let's continue.

137
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,320
Bless this food for the nourishment ...

138
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,800
of our body in the name of the Father,
the Son, Holy spirit. Amen.

139
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,680
Good night, Trish.

140
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,080
Good night, Sonny.

141
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,840
There better be a good ...

142
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,160
Okay.

143
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,040
Come on back to bed, honey.

144
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,320
Okay.
I see you there.

145
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,520
There's a 12-gauge shotgun waiting
for anybody trespassing.

146
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,480
Anthony ...

147
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,360
somebody is ...
is here.

148
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,520
Don't move.

149
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,640
What happened?

150
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,400
Brushes.

151
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,360
The brushes?

152
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,920
Anthony.

153
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,440
You can't do that to the kids, no!

154
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,440
But Daddy, it was the brushes! We didn't do it!

155
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,880
Mark, you think that's funny?!

156
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,680
He can't even write!- What about her?!
- Don't you touch her!
- Get out of my way! You leave her alone!

157
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,040
I'll kill you.

158
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,760
I'll kill you, you!

159
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,360
Where's your sister? You had
something to do with this?

160
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,840
No! - You stop it!

161
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,880
You think that’s funny?!

162
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,160
That's funny?!

163
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,880
You're a big man!
Don't you hit them.

164
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,600
Daddy, no! No! Daddy don't! Mommy!

165
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,720
Oh, my god.

166
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,560
What's happening to us?

167
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,440
<i>Why didn't you pull the trigger?</i>

168
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,320
<i>Why didn't you shoot ... that ... pig?</i>

169
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,640
We believe in one God,

170
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,240
the Father, the Almighty,

171
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,960
Maker of Heaven and Earth ...

172
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,560
of all things seen and unseen.

173
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,440
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,

174
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,960
the only Son of God,

175
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,480
eternally begotten of the Father,

176
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,720
God from God, Light from Light,

177
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,640
True God from True God,

178
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,080
begotten, not made, one in Being with the Father.

179
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,040
He ascended into Heaven
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.

180
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,440
I'm Dolores Montelli, and I have four children.

181
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,800
Well, that's splendid. Welcome Mrs. Montelli.
- Thank you. Thank you. - Welcome.

182
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,840
And Mr. Montelli?

183
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,040
My husband is a ...

184
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,160
a good man Father, but he's
not a big church go-er.
- Thank you.

185
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,400
I was wondering if  ...

186
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,800
If you would come to our house and bless it.
- Yes certainly. Certainly, I'd be delighted. - Thank you.

187
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,800
Mr. Montelli, I presume.

188
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,760
I'm Father Adamsky.

189
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,080
Your wife asked me to stop by.

190
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,080
Dolores?

191
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,480
May I come in?

192
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,280
Oh, Father.

193
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,560
Oh, you came. - Mrs. Montelli.
- Oh, I'm so glad.

194
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,920
Have you met my husband?
- Yes, yes. We just met. - Oh, good.

195
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,400
Father please come into our living room.

196
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,600
Children. Children take your coats off.

197
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,920
Children this is the man you saw
in church this afternoon.

198
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,200
This is Father Adamsky.
Father, these are our two
youngest children. This is ...

199
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,240
Mark. - Mark, it's good to meet you.
- And this is Jan. Honey?

200
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,080
Jan, pleasure to meet you.
- Honey? Just put your things
down here, Father.

201
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,160
Honey?

202
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,960
Would you please ... go get
Tricia ... and Sonny?

203
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,920
Give us a minute.

204
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,840
Oh, excuse me.

205
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,160
What the hell is the matter with you?

206
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,680
I don't go to church ... and you bring it here?

207
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,160
Yes.

208
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,320
He's going to bless our house.

209
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,200
Sonny?

210
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,960
Hey, what?

211
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,920
Anthony ...

212
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,440
please.

213
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,400
Anthony please go inside.
Please be nice to him, for me.

214
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,880
Please.

215
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,480
Tricia?

216
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,800
There's somebody some place
around here, but we can't find him.
- Oh, you can't find him.- What's that?

217
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,040
This is ...

218
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,400
a surplice.

219
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,800
Oh, I bet you know what this is for.

220
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,760
I've seen it, but I don't know the name.
- It's a stole.

221
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,160
Want a smoke, priest?
- Uh, no. Thank you.

222
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,360
You mind, if I do?

223
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,640
Not at all.

224
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,480
Jan?

225
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Yes, sir.

226
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,280
See if  ...

227
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
the priest wants a drink of something.

228
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,400
A glass of water would be very nice.
- I'll get it. I'll get it!

229
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,440
No, I'll get it! - I'll get it!

230
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,920
You're dead! - You're dead!

231
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,400
You're scaring me. I can't breathe!
It's like a movie. - You're scaring me.

232
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,000
Don't worry, it's okay.

233
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,080
Here, you can take the glass.

234
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,720
I love you.

235
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,080
Father ...

236
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,600
This is my first born.

237
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,640
Sonny.

238
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,920
He hasn't been feeling well, lately.

239
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,680
Good to meet you, Sonny.

240
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,200
What do you kids think this
house is, a playground?!
- We didn't do it!

241
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,000
Don't you lie to me!

242
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,600
Please! Don't hit the child.

243
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,000
Mister, this isn't your business.
Do you hear that?!

244
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,720
I raise my children, the way I see fit!
Now you do what you got to do and go.

245
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,000
Anthony!

246
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,000
You think that's funny, huh?
But dad, we didn't do it.

247
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,240
Father, please forgive my husband.

248
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,200
Please, Father.
- I think there'll be a better
time for this Mrs. Montelli.

249
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,680
Yes of course, Father. Of course.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

250
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,680
No, it's not your fault.

251
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,520
Perhaps one day your husband
and I can meet as friends.
- Of course, Father. Of course.

252
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,480
We are going to get into the car ...

253
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,480
and we're going to go to the church.

254
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,800
And you are going to apologize
to the priest in front of your children.

255
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,800
Or else ...

256
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
Or else?

257
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,920
Or else what?

258
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,400
Or else I'm gonna walk out of this house tonight ...

259
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,440
and I'm not ...

260
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,400
going to come back.
- Jesus Christ, Dolores.

261
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,200
Hey, snotty.

262
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,440
You coming to church?

263
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,920
Hurry up. Come on, hurry up.

264
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Where's Sonny?
- Oh, he's upstairs. He said,
he isn’t feeling well.

265
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,400
Is that you?!

266
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,000
Who's there?!

267
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,920
Patricia?

268
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,520
Jan?

269
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,760
Who's there?

270
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,800
I've got a gun out here.

271
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,640
Come on out!

272
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,240
Oh, my god.

273
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,280
No!

274
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,720
No!

275
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,880
I thought you were asleep.

276
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,520
I was.

277
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,160
When did you get back from church?

278
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,440
Oh, hours ago.

279
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,000
What happened downstairs?
All the windows were open.

280
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,960
I don't know.

281
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,560
Something.

282
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,160
I don't remember.

283
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,960
You look terrible.

284
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,480
Are you okay?

285
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,520
Yeah. I feel all right.

286
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,080
You should see a doctor.

287
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
You've got dark rings around your eyes.

288
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,960
What happened at church?

289
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,800
Oh, it was unbelievable.

290
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,280
Daddy made his apologies.
But then he took us out for a ...

291
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,320
steak dinner.

292
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,960
Yeah.

293
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,600
He tried to get mommy drunk,
but she wouldn't go for it.

294
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
You know ...

295
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,520
There's something strange.

296
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,960
I think mommy doesn't want
to make love to daddy anymore.

297
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,480
I think ... he tries to force her.

298
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,480
I heard her crying.

299
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,320
Why're you looking at me like that?

300
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,360
Because you're beautiful.

301
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,240
I'm beautiful?

302
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,560
Hey, come on, stop teasing me, huh?
- No, I mean it.

303
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,760
Sit on the bed.

304
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,480
Come on, strike a pose for me on the bed.

305
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,560
We're gonna play a game.

306
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,920
Where you're the beautiful model.

307
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,560
And I'm the famous photographer.

308
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,840
Pose for me.

309
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,080
You know, Trish ...

310
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,560
I think that you are probably ...

311
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,720
the most beautiful girl in the world.

312
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,920
Oh, probably?

313
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,360
You're not sure?

314
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,120
I'm sure.

315
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,760
Take off your nightgown.

316
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
What?

317
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,320
Just for a second.

318
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,200
Okay, just for a second.

319
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,680
There.

320
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,000
I think.

321
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,480
Now I can say.
You are the most beautiful girl in the world.

322
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,520
Put your hair up.

323
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,840
Oh, now I put my hair up?

324
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,560
You have a beautiful neck.

325
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,040
Enough.

326
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,000
No.

327
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,840
I have a secret I want to tell you.

328
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
What?

329
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,440
They're mine.

330
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,440
My panties.

331
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,360
I took them from the laundry.

332
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,240
But ... but why?

333
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,200
It's a big sin.

334
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,360
Don't be afraid.

335
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,280
I ...

336
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,800
went all the way ...

337
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,960
with ...

338
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,760
my friend.

339
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,040
You must ...

340
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,080
resist this temptation.

341
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,760
One day perhaps you'll ...
meet someone.

342
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,680
Marry. Raise a family.

343
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,680
Even if you love him very much,
you must resist.
- We don't love each other.

344
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,960
You don't love each other?

345
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,640
Then this is ...

346
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,360
This is only a sexual matter?

347
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,040
He does it ...

348
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,920
just ...

349
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,520
to hurt.

350
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:52,960
Well ...

351
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,360
to hurt who?

352
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,480
Hurt you?

353
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,720
To hurt God.

354
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,720
My child you shouldn't say that.

355
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,000
Now tell me everything from the beginning.

356
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,680
No!

357
00:42:29,281 --> 00:42:30,281
I try, and pray at home ...

358
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,880
<i>He's here. Stay away from him.</i>

359
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,720
The words won't come.

360
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,840
I'm sorry.

361
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,560
I didn't know.

362
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,040
That's all right.

363
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,760
You're here now and ... and ...

364
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,520
and you'll bless the house and
everything will be all right.

365
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,560
Won't it?

366
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,000
Of course.

367
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,600
Sprinkle me with hyssop O Lord ...

368
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,040
and I shall be clean.

369
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
Wash me.

370
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,440
And I shall be whiter ...

371
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,040
than snow.

372
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,840
Hear us Holy Lord,

373
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,440
almighty Father. Make us ...

374
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,520
Upstairs too, Father.

375
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,440
Be merciful to me, my God ...

376
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,080
for great is thy goodness.

377
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,600
Glory be to the Father, the Son,
the Holy Spirit. Amen.

378
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,000
You're not coming with me?

379
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
My son is upstairs and ...

380
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,720
Well, he hasn't been  ...

381
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,480
happy to see us lately.

382
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,040
Well, I don't want to disturb him.

383
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,240
Oh, you must go Father.

384
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,840
Oh, please.

385
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,440
Please.
- It's all right.

386
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,560
Hear us Holy Lord,

387
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,280
Almighty Father,

388
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,640
Eternal God.

389
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,280
And then send us thy Holy Angel from Heaven.

390
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,120
To guard, cherish, protect, visit and defend ...

391
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240
all who dwell in this house.

392
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,000
Hello, Sonny.

393
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,360
Sprinkle me with hyssop O Lord
and make me clean.

394
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,800
Why are you hiding?

395
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,120
I'm not.

396
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,040
I just don't want to talk to anyone.
This is my room. I want to be alone.

397
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,480
Your ... your mother ask me to come.

398
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,360
So?

399
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,800
Bless my mother's room.

400
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,040
Would you like to be alone?

401
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,720
Yes.

402
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,160
Is there anything I can do for you?

403
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,160
Yes.

404
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,560
You want me to leave?

405
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,120
Sorry.
- It's all right.

406
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,000
Maybe we can talk sometime.

407
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,240
It's nice territory.

408
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,920
Oh, my bedroom, Father.

409
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,640
Oh, my bed too.

410
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,320
No!

411
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,600
Here's the sprinkler.
- From which the blood emerged.

412
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,960
That is correct.

413
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,560
Well, what do you want of me?

414
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,080
Well, I may need approval for an exorcism.

415
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,120
An exorcism?
- After what happened in the house ..
- Wait a minute.

416
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,480
Do you believe in ghost, Frank?

417
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,080
I saw a ghost once.

418
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,160
Or at least ...

419
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,960
what appeared to be a ghost.

420
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,160
Although I thought I saw a ghost.....

421
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,320
There may have been another explanation.

422
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,120
Likewise, in the matter at hand.

423
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,560
We must start with you.

424
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,360
Make sure, you're seeing
what you think you are.

425
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,600
The worst thing in this whole area ...
and you know this, Father ...

426
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,320
is to rush into anything.
- Frankly, I don't think we have time.
- Father ...

427
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,040
I will be in touch with you.

428
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,120
We will take our time.

429
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,520
For we wrestle ...

430
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,440
not against the flesh or the blood.

431
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,400
Hi.

432
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,280
Patricia.

433
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,120
Well, come on in.

434
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,040
How are you?

435
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,760
I'm fine.

436
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:24,920
You're fine?

437
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,040
I think we should discuss your ...

438
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,880
behaviour at confession.

439
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,640
I'm sorry about that, Father.

440
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,400
I apologise.

441
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,800
I'll try again next week.

442
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,360
Good.

443
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,080
How's your mother?

444
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,720
Oh, she's okay.

445
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,920
Oh, by the way we're having a birthday party
for my brother Sonny...

446
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,400
This afternoon.

447
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,040
Can you come?

448
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,320
Please.
- Well, I ...

449
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,880
have to work on ...
my sermon for Sunday.

450
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
I'm sorry.

451
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:13,680
Thank you.

452
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,320
For asking me though.

453
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,800
Maybe I could stop by on Monday or Tuesday.

454
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,760
You'll feel better.

455
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,560
When you confess.

456
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,840
Just a minute.

457
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:41,920
Hello?

458
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,200
I'm terribly sorry.

459
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,080
Father, I have to talk to you about Sonny.
- 327 Clay.

460
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,320
I'll be there right away.

461
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,480
Oh, that's too bad.

462
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,320
Mr. Conner had a stroke.

463
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,280
Hi.

464
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,440
Did you ...

465
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,960
see a young girl in the hallway?

466
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,600
Yeah. She's in a big hurry too.
She almost knocked me down.

467
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,000
I don't have time to deal ...
- Camping anyone?

468
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,520
One of my parishioners is dying.

469
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,760
Sorry to hear that.

470
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,720
Here, let me help you.
- I'll be right back. - Okay?

471
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,640
I'll be here.

472
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,120
<i>Happy birthday to you ... </i>

473
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,760
<i>happy birthday to you ...</i>

474
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,240
<i>Happy birthday, dear Sonny ...</i>

475
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:38,400
<i>Happy birthday to you ...
Happy birthday to you ...</i>

476
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,440
<i>You live in a zoo.</i>

477
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:47,120
<i>You smell like a monkey ...
and you look like one too.</i>

478
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,520
Oh, god.

479
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,560
Look at this.
- Make a wish and then
blow out the candle.

480
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,920
Make a wish?

481
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,360
It's magic!
- It's magic. Did you do that?

482
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,800
Huh, monkey-face?

483
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,880
You trying to make a fool of your big brother?

484
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,200
Or it was you?

485
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,160
It was you?

486
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,560
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

487
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,040
I love you.
- I love you, too.

488
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,600
I love you, mom.
- Oh, Sonny.

489
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,600
Happy birthday.

490
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,360
Thank you.

491
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,760
It's very nice.

492
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,600
<i>Look at them. They're pathetic animals.</i>

493
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,320
<i>They'd be better off, if you killed them.</i>

494
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,240
<i>Don't you think so?</i>

495
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,800
<i>Yes. You think so.</i>

496
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,560
Hi. - Hi everybody. - Oh, hi Danielle. - Hello.

497
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,000
Hi, Sonny.

498
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,080
Happy birthday, Sonny. - Thank you. Hi.
- Happy birthday. - Thank you very much.

499
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
How're you doing?

500
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,360
Happy birthday.

501
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,160
Anthony, let me get you and Jody together.
- Hurry up, honey.

502
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,800
They're waiting for you down there.
- Wait, wait, wait. Oh, I missed it.

503
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,400
Everybody hungry?
- Yeah.

504
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,000
... it's great, I love it. It's wonderful ...

505
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,200
So? I'm ready.

506
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,600
I ran out of film. I have
to go get some more film.

507
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,880
Sonny, I'm here.

508
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,400
So what?

509
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,200
I thought you ... were calling me.

510
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,960
I changed my mind.

511
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,360
What's the matter with you?

512
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,760
Are you feeling guilty?

513
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,680
I'm not.
- Stop it!

514
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,040
You act like you hate me sometimes.

515
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,760
I'm confused.

516
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,200
Please, talk to me.
- Go away, damn bitch!

517
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,200
Don't you ever talk to me again!

518
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,680
<i>I'm sorry. The number you ...</i>

519
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,880
Please, Father answer me.

520
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,720
Answer me!

521
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,160
Oh, Father I know you're there.

522
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,880
I don't want to answer it.

523
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,400
Oh, good idea.

524
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,360
<i>Hello?</i>

525
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,480
Now ... let's hit the trail

526
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,240
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

527
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,000
I was just going to get some ice cubes.

528
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,920
What have you done with your brother?

529
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,040
Me?

530
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,960
What have you done?

531
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,080
Nothing! Mom!

532
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,960
Do you understand what you've done?

533
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,680
No.

534
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,440
No!

535
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:59,360
<i>You must do it.</i>

536
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,120
<i>You must do it now.</i>

537
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,280
Answer me. What is that?!

538
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,360
Answer me!

539
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:54,480
Don't you understand? Don't you see anything?
- What?! Spit it out, what's on your mind!

540
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,040
I don't ...
- You don't want to do it anymore?!
- Just, lets ...

541
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,760
Just, see it.
- Every time I touch you, you get sick.

542
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,160
What makes you sick? Come on, answer!

543
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,280
It's a shame!

544
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,520
What's a shame?!

545
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,960
Everything.
- Are you nuts?

546
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,160
Our family is shameful. Don't you understand?
- What's it got to do with our family!?

547
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,040
I just don't want to wake up anymore!

548
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,680
Let's go away.

549
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,760
Mommy!

550
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,800
Mommy.

551
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,680
Mommy!

552
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,440
Mommy!

553
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,600
Mommy!

554
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,760
No!

555
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,920
Mommy!

556
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,840
No!

557
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,520
Mark.

558
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:57,680
Mark, hide.

559
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,840
Hide.

560
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,280
No! No!

561
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,120
What are you doing?

562
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,520
No! No.

563
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:05,400
Please.

564
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,680
I wouldn't tell anyone.

565
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,200
Oh, no!

566
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,880
Frank, wake up. You're having a dream.

567
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,760
You're having a dream.

568
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,680
Frank, what're you doing?

569
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,440
Frank?

570
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,640
Frank! Wait a minute. You're still asleep.

571
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,120
Frank?

572
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,040
Frank, hold on a minute!

573
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,200
Would you at least tell me where
we're going? - Amityville.

574
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,240
Why?

575
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,320
Something horrible has happened.

576
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,400
Frank, you had a dream.

577
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:55,440
It might have had a powerful
effect on you, but it was just
a dream. - I pray to god you're right.

578
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:05,760
Did you see that?

579
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,320
Hi. I'm their priest.
He's with me.

580
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,040
Hold it, gentlemen.

581
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,720
Okay, let them in. He was their priest.
- Okay, Father.

582
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,040
Who are they?

583
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,640
Two parents and their kids.

584
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,520
I'm a priest.

585
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:12,640
It's okay.

586
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,800
Okay. You guys can take off.
You're too late.

587
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,440
Oh, Father. Please.

588
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,840
Don't touch those things.

589
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:07,120
It's a crime scene.

590
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,960
Everything's going to be all right.

591
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:13,600
Take it easy, kid.

592
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,680
I don't remember.

593
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,680
I don't. I don't remember.

594
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,800
Let's get him out of here.

595
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,400
And calm him down.

596
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,760
Okay Chief.

597
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,800
Lieutenant. He hasn't said a word.
He's still in shock.

598
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,400
What about the doctor?
- He's on his way.

599
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:55,920
May I go in now?

600
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,480
Lieutenant Turner,

601
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,640
take the Father in to see the boy.

602
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,560
Did you kill them, Sonny?

603
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,000
Sonny ...

604
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:55,520
Sonny ...

605
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,880
Who is inside you?

606
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:16,160
In the name of the Father and the
Son and the Holy Spirit.

607
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,360
Amen.

608
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,120
It was Patricia on the phone that night.

609
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,560
She was trying to reach me.

610
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,640
I'm responsible.

611
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,120
You loved them, didn't you?

612
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,360
Do you hear me? Sonny.

613
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,080
Help me to help you.

614
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,600
The Lord is my Shepherd.

615
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,400
I shall not want.

616
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,840
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

617
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,800
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

618
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,400
He restoreth my soul.

619
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,040
He leadeth me...

620
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,280
No! No!

621
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,160
No!

622
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,080
Did he hurt you Father?

623
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,080
No.

624
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,840
Anyway, it's not his fault.

625
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,400
What do you mean, Father?

626
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,840
He can't help it.

627
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,760
He's dominated by ...

628
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,840
another force.

629
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,400
What force?

630
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,160
The boy is possessed.

631
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,160
I saw one once in Puerto Rico.

632
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,640
He was shouting ...

633
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,240
kicking ...

634
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,560
Show yourself.

635
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,080
Unclean spirit.

636
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,480
Kiss the crucifix.

637
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,840
And beg the Almighty for forgiveness.

638
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,280
I must take him to church.

639
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,800
That is impossible.

640
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,520
In church, I could succeed.

641
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,680
Please, understand.

642
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,800
Help me.

643
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:10,720
Are you asking me to let him go?!

644
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,480
It's the only way.

645
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:31,000
No, Father. You got three minutes
to talk to the boy.

646
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:32,640
That's all.

647
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,280
Officer.

648
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,680
I told you, you'd have to leave.

649
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,640
You want to destroy this boy's life?

650
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,120
I do what I want.

651
01:13:06,240 --> 01:13:11,040
You must leave this boy's body,
which your foul presence occupies.

652
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,920
Why should I leave?
I like it here.

653
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,440
I will cast you out.

654
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,080
Oh ...

655
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,200
How?

656
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,480
With an exorcism.

657
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:25,160
You can't do that.

658
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,840
You're not authorized.

659
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:28,240
How do you know?

660
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,600
We know everything.

661
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,920
Is it your intention

662
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,440
not to show yourself again?

663
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,080
I could.

664
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:40,160
When?

665
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:42,720
When I please.

666
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,960
Father, what are you doing here?

667
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,800
Are you all right?

668
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,360
Can I give you a lift?

669
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,120
Yes.

670
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,520
Yes. Thank you.

671
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:28,120
I know some strange stories about that house.

672
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:39,120
I've been working here for 25 years.
- Here, let me help you.

673
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,480
Thank you.

674
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,680
At first I thought it would be very boring.

675
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,240
But these records are more
interesting than any novel.

676
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:59,560
A woman expelled from Salem for
witchcraft violated the Indians law against
building on an ancient burial ground.

677
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:06,280
Since then. It's been desecrated by people,
who have no right to live there.

678
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:29,400
Hello?

679
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,120
<i>Hello?</i>

680
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,960
Who is this?

681
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:35,840
<i>Father Adamsky?</i>

682
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,280
<i>Father?</i>

683
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,560
<i>I'm worried.</i>

684
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,840
<i>I'm worried about Sonny.</i>

685
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,720
<i>Afraid of him.</i>

686
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:56,720
<i>I don't know why, but ...</i>

687
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,160
<i>I think he wants to kill us.</i>

688
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,560
Your honour its my attention to
prove to the trial that ...

689
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:19,720
Sonny Montelli is a victim of
demonic possession and therefore ...
- Of what Mr. Booth?

690
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,160
Demonic possession, your Honour.
Possession by demons?

691
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,400
And therefore innocent.

692
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:33,040
The charges placed against him.
- Your honour. This is highly irregular.
- Will Council, please approach the bench?

693
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,240
Your honour, there is no precedent ...

694
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,680
Mr. Booth ...

695
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,160
I admire your originality.

696
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,840
If I accept your plea,
regardless of verdict ...

697
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,920
Every courtroom in this country would be
in inundated with pleas of possession.

698
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,200
Nobody will be guilty of anything.

699
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:55,640
"The devil made them do it."
No, no, no, no, Mr. Booth.

700
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,200
I cannot accept your plea.

701
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,520
You have three days to submit another.

702
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,160
Father Adamsky?

703
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,400
The Chancellor would like to
have a word with you.

704
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,000
Monsignor, it's good to see you.

705
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,720
I've more to tell you about the Montelli case.

706
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,480
Wont you come in?
- Sorry. I'm in a hurry. But I want talk to you.

707
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:05,240
Who gave you permission to let the people
in the court of law believe that the church
was preparing to perform an exorcism?

708
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,760
You told me.
- I told you I was going to talk to the Bishop.

709
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,480
But you anticipated his decision
and put the church in a bad light.

710
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,240
Now, the Bishop is very worried about you.

711
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:20,360
He would like you to take a leave of absence.
- A leave of absence now?
- You are not listening to me!

712
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,760
I'm listening to my own conscience!

713
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:29,080
The facts, the sprinkler, the diabolical
influence in that house! You didn't listen.

714
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:37,680
Now I understand why all the
prisoners are complaining about him.

715
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,960
He's coming back.

716
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,720
I ask one thing.

717
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:49,080
Your authority to perform an exorcism
on Sonny Montelli.
- The Bishop does not think you are qualified.

718
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:55,880
Nor above all, have the correct steadiness
of character. - Too much prudence
could be cowards, Monsignor.

719
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,760
You are not only forgetting obedience.
You're forgetting humility as well!

720
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:02,520
Let me talk to the Bishop!
- The Bishop wants to talk to you!

721
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,360
But we'll tell you when!

722
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,600
Now you are to go home and remained there ...

723
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:10,120
Do not do anything on your own
initiative, and wait for our call.

724
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,760
God be with you, Father. Let's go, please.

725
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,080
How's the boy?

726
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:27,360
They're gonna try electroshock therapy again tomorrow.
- That's just torturing him.
- I'm sorry, Father. He's probably insane.

727
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:30,560
That's why I suggested we plea
insanity in the first place.

728
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,520
Let him in.

729
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,760
He won't eat anything.

730
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,760
He's dying.

731
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:07,880
Are you crazy?

732
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,040
They're taking the best care of him here.

733
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,640
I should call the doctor.

734
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:37,440
You understand, the only way we can
save him is by taking him out of here.

735
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:40,880
Look, let me get the doctor!
- That's pointless and you know it!

736
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:42,840
Now you're ...

737
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:43,920
a good man.

738
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:52,080
Don't ask me this, Father.

739
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,120
I could lose my job, I could go to jail.
- You want to let him die?

740
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:37,920
Father ...

741
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,720
this is the key to the door ...

742
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,120
of this ward.

743
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,200
When you got there, unlock the door.

744
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,480
Turn left.

745
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,280
You'll find the fire escape.

746
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,200
Take it.

747
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,680
Take it, Father.

748
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,120
The butt, right here.

749
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,000
Go on, Father, hit me,
before I change my mind.

750
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,640
Forgive me.

751
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,040
No.

752
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:50,680
Sonny.

753
01:25:06,120 --> 01:25:07,080
Sonny?

754
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:13,080
Sonny?

755
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,080
Sonny.

756
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:26,000
Yes, sir.

757
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:29,000
Excuse me.
- Yeah, that crazy priest pulled him out of here.

758
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,760
We know he's gone.

759
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,080
We got an APB out on him.

760
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,400
Yeah. Turner's fine, okay. Bye, bye.

761
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:38,920
Sonny?

762
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:32,680
Dear God.

763
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,920
Let your powerful strength ...

764
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:38,720
force the serpent ...

765
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,120
to release ...

766
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,120
your servant.

767
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,400
So it no longer possesses him ..
whom you deign to make

768
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:48,680
in your own image.

769
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,440
Sonny ...

770
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:38,160
if you can hear me ...

771
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,440
pray, my son.

772
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,160
Pray!

773
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,600
Fight the evil inside you.

774
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,840
"He who commands you"

775
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:17,840
"Is he who ordered you to be thrown
down from the highest heaven ...

776
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,640
into the depths
of hell."

777
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,160
"He who commands you ...

778
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:34,080
is he, who dominated the sea
and the winds and the storms."

779
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:39,120
"Fear ...

780
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,400
him who was crucified as a man.

781
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,720
and who rose from death."

782
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:53,600
Most unchased spirit, in the name of our
Almighty Lord, I command you to tell me who you are.

783
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,000
Tell me your name.

784
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,640
Your name.

785
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:02,800
Your name.

786
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,720
Your name!

787
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:08,000
You know my name.

788
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:10,160
You know my name very well.

789
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,000
Father ...

790
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,240
Now, you must confess, mustn't you?

791
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,440
Look at me.

792
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:27,760
When I was making my confession,
you thought about making love to me.

793
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,280
Didn't you?

794
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,640
No.

795
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:34,480
Look at me!

796
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,400
Confess!

797
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,240
Dirty priest.

798
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,160
You wanted it.

799
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:42,960
You wanted it!

800
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,800
"Creator of Heaven and Earth you are the
true king. Your kingdom is without end."

801
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:53,200
"Humbly, I supplicate your majesty and
your glory that you deign to free ...

802
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:58,080
this your servant from unclean spirits!"

803
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,640
Prince of lies! ...

804
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:04,320
return to the depths of darkness!

805
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,080
I like you, Adamsky.

806
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,000
I understand you.

807
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,800
You want to dominate, like your Bishops.

808
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,160
And more.

809
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:23,200
I can give it to you, Adamsky.

810
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,480
Sonny ...

811
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,760
If you can hear me ...

812
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,680
resist the unclean spirit.

813
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,560
Will it ...

814
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:36,640
to leave your body.

815
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:38,960
You've decided to do this on your own.

816
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,800
Without the support of the church.

817
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,280
You are disobeying the church.

818
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,120
Now you are alone, Adamsky.

819
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:58,960
Flee ...

820
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,200
evil spirit.

821
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,080
Depart ...

822
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:08,160
from this servant of God.
- No!

823
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,360
Flee ...

824
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,360
evil spirit.

825
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,520
I command you.

826
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:18,880
In the name of God.

827
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,400
In the name of God.

828
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,120
In the name of God!

829
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,280
Let it be me, my God.

830
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,800
Not him.

831
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:07,040
Let it be me!

832
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:15,040
Let it be me!

833
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:21,040
My God, let it be me!

834
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,600
Take him away from here.

835
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:27,680
What about you?

836
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,680
Take him away, now!

837
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,080
Sonny ...

838
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,240
you come with me.

839
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:38,960
Come on.

840
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,480
It's all right, Sonny.

841
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:02,160
It's all right. Come on.

842
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,600
They'll understand it wasn't your fault.

843
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,160
We'll make them understand.

844
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:42,400
Blessed Lord, Lord of my life!

845
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,720
Do not forsake me!
