1
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:45,176
They say that women change.

2
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,645
'Tis so,

3
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,776
but you are ever-constant
in your changefulness.

4
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:56,185
Like that still thread
of falling river,

5
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:00,488
one from source to last embrace
in the still pool.

6
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,758
Ever-anewed
and ever-moving on.

7
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,856
From first to last.
" From first to last,

8
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,401
a myriad water drops.
"a myriad water drops.

9
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,597
"And you...
I love you for it...

10
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:17,666
are the force that moves
and holds the form."

11
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,510
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
you've just heard a snippet...

12
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,540
from one of only two copies
of this poem...

13
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,280
by Mr. Randolph Henry Ash,

14
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:32,757
poet laureate
to Queen Victoria herself.

15
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:36,421
And this gorgeous ode
to his nuptial bliss,

16
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:40,762
written in his own hand,
begins our bidding today.

17
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:45,294
May we start the bidding
please at £40,000.

18
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,634
- Bit of an old monster.
- Yeah.

19
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:20,571
But an important monster.
It's Randolph Ash's.

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,665
Yes. Who are you
with again?

21
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,144
I'm, uh, Roland Michell.
Who?

22
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:32,310
- Professor Blackadder's
research assistant.
- Isn't that Dr. Wolfe?

23
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:36,481
Was. Fergus got the lectureship
at SaintJohn's... over me.

24
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:41,653
Of course he did.
Oh, yes, Dr. Wolfe
mentioned you.

25
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,322
You're that American
who's over here.

26
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,524
Well, I'm sure
there are others.

27
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,760
I mean, after all,
you are our favorite colony.

28
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:01,045
£ 1 0,000. Any further
offers on £ 1 0,000?

29
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,048
£ 1 1,000.

30
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:06,415
So when do your little
suffragist trinkets
come up for the...

31
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,011
Look, Maud,
it's Mortimer Cropper.

32
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,113
Oh,yes. That's someone
you should know.

33
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,421
- You know him?
- Of him.

34
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,791
Suffered through
a lecture or two.
That sort of thing.
Really.

35
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,228
Mm-hmm.
He's a voracious collector
from what I hear.

36
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,392
Yes. His penchant
for conquests
is well documented.

37
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,628
It's
a very male quality.
Mm.

38
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,694
I know it's vulgar,
but I have to introduce myself.

39
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,706
Oh, all right.

40
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:31,710
Oh, uh... Damn.
Let's begin the bidding
please at £ 4,000.

41
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:36,374
£ 4,000. £ 4,000.
Excuse me. Sorry.

42
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,680
£ 4,500.
Um, Professor Cropper,
Fergus Wolfe.

43
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:44,348
Um, we spoke actually
after one of your papers
at, uh, at Trinity.

44
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,689
You wouldn't remember.
I'm sorry, I don't.
Nice coat though.

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,025
Oh, thank you.
Uh,James Blackadder.
You're with?

46
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,430
Ah, you're one of
Blackadder's boys
from the British Museum.

47
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,025
Hello.
Hildebrand Ash,

48
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,664
man of leisure.
Oh, hello.

49
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,765
I don't know why Blackadder
comes to these things.

50
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:05,538
He hasn't got any money.

51
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:09,480
Well, he's Irish, you see.
He enjoys feeling persecuted.

52
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,006
Dear Madame:

53
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:38,942
Since our pleasant conversation,
I have thought oflittle else.

54
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,113
I write with a strong sense
of the necessity...

55
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,240
of continuing our talk.

56
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,186
Dear Madame:
I know that you came only
to honor Crabb-Robinson...

57
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:00,289
at his small,
informal party...

58
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,164
because he had been
of assistance
to your illustrious father.

59
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,898
Excuse me, sir.

60
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,906
Meal is served.

61
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,135
Thank you.

62
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:52,811
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

63
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,609
Ah, my tenant.
Your evening sherry.

64
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,911
Thank you.

65
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,248
Candy, this is Roland.
Roland, Candy.

66
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,085
- Hello again.
- Be a love
and check on the duck, eh?

67
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:08,355
- Okay.
- So, coming in?

68
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,329
So how do you
always know it's me?

69
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,298
I'm a solicitor.
I know everything.

70
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,892
Candy, huh?
Oh, no, no, no,
please.

71
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,666
Candy's just a friend.
Why, are you interested?

72
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,402
I told you
I'm off women.
Yeah, but...

73
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,001
it isn't a reason
to be off women.

74
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,809
Why do we always
sit in your hall?

75
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,686
'Cause it's the best room
in the house, really. I bought
this place for the hallway.

76
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:43,394
So, I found something today
I think is pretty incredible
in the London Library.

77
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,728
- A place to sit.
- No.

78
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,563
I found something of Ash's.
You know Randolph Ash?

79
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:53,662
Ash. Oh, doesn't he have
some sort of celebration going?

80
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,640
It's the centenary
of his love poems.
Terribly mushy ones.

81
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,904
Found after his death
or something, weren't they?

82
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,071
Is the table laid,
darling?

83
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,377
Listen.
What's it cost an hour?

84
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,383
No, no, Candy's a friend
I told you.

85
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:09,478
Not her, you.
What do you charge an hour,
roughly?

86
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,490
Oh, uh, I don't know.
Five hundred.

87
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,152
- Pounds?
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,719
-Jesus, no wonder
you have a nice hallway.
- Thank you.

89
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,597
Okay, I wanna buy seven minutes
of attorneyl client privilege
right now.

90
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,760
Step into my office.

91
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,874
Ash wrote those.
They're not the originals.

92
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,885
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

93
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,717
How much time we got left?
I've got to think of
a defense for you.

94
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,451
They're practically
love letters.

95
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,721
Well, they're racy,
actually.
See, Ash...

96
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,762
supposedly never even looked
at another woman.

97
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,355
I mean, not even glanced at one
his entire marriage.

98
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,196
Can you imagine
what would happen
if I could prove...

99
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,796
that Mr. Perfect Husband had
this, like, Shakespearean-type
dark lady thing going?

100
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,473
Darling, the duck's done.

101
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,477
Would you be a sweetheart
and do the sauce?

102
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,604
Yes, yes.

103
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,516
- Duck, huh?
- Yeah, Peking.

104
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,452
- It's from around the corner.

105
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:18,581
Yeah, but that
would be extraordinary.

106
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,387
It would be rewriting
history, old chap.

107
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,961
Yeah, it would be.

108
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,768
Morning.
Morning.

109
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,711
Roland.
Professor.

110
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,385
I think
I made a discovery.

111
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,149
It'll turn out to have been
discovered 20 times already.

112
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,714
- I don't think so.
- Surprise me.

113
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,020
Ash's copy of Vico
in the London Library.

114
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,894
It's full of his own notes
on loose bits of paper
all the way through.

115
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,899
- Useful?
- Very.

116
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,300
Better have a look.
See what's what before...

117
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,896
people turn up
with his checkbook.
I also found... Professor.

118
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,966
They made a mockery
over at Sotheby's yesterday.
£ 1 900 for a toothpick.

119
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,241
- Fergus. Where is Fergus?

120
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,681
- He's supposed to be teaching.
- I'll come with you.

121
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,481
No need.
The novice blunders
on the discovery.

122
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,987
The scholar investigates.

123
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:01,254
You get on with
those wretched requests
for Ellen's stuff.

124
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,318
I'll go straight from there
to my class.

125
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:11,061
Thank you, Roland.
What a wonderful discovery.
They're magically delicious.

126
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:15,130
- He's a meany.
- That's a very nice name
for what he is.

127
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,402
Wretched requests, please.

128
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,673
" How many jars
of gooseberry jam...

129
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,580
did Ash's wife, Ellen,
make in 1 850?"

130
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,017
Hmm. This is not
a job for a grown-up.

131
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,618
Gooseberry.

132
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,990
Cooking.
Gooseberry jam.

133
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,701
Cooking, 1 43.

134
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,556
What about a small,
informal party?

135
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,686
1 859.

136
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,280
My headache
last night prevented me
from accompanying Randolph...

137
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,009
to dear Crabb-Robinson's...

138
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,916
for a dinner honoring
the poetess Christabel LaMotte.

139
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,547
He was reluctant
to attend without me,
but I was persistent...

140
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,557
and finally persuaded him.

141
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,559
Ash,you know
Professor Spear.

142
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,652
I'm delighted.

143
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,357
Mrs.Jameson.
Mrs.Jameson.

144
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,366
Charmed.

145
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,664
Miss Glover.

146
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:52,727
Oh, Miss Glover.

147
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,831
- And Miss LaMotte.
- Miss LaMotte.

148
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,940
The highest pleasure.

149
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,141
Randolph reported the party went
off very well, indeed.

150
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,684
The discussion of poetry
was animated,

151
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:11,348
with Miss LaMotte
speaking more forcibly
than anyone expected.

152
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,654
Surprises me, madame,
that a lady who lives
as quietly as you do...

153
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:18,993
wouldn't be aware
of my modest success.

154
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:22,693
Oh, I'm very aware
that the papers
herald you weekly.

155
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,198
It is you, however,
who surprise me.

156
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:30,572
- And why is that?
-Judging from your work,

157
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,702
I'm surprised you'd even
acknowledge my existence...

158
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:36,578
or any woman's for that matter
since you show us such
small regard on the page.

159
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,542
You cut me, madame.

160
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,553
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,851
I only meant to scratch.

162
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,660
Hey, Fergus.

163
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,289
Ah, hello, Roland.

164
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,334
What is it you chaps always say,
" How's it hanging?"

165
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,803
Well, we usually
just say "hey."
Unless you're gay.

166
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,136
Oh.
Listen.

167
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,608
Let me ask you something.
Do you know a Dr. Maud Bailey?

168
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,611
Maud! Oh, yes,
I know Maud very well.

169
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,874
She teaches Gender Studies
at Lincoln.

170
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:13,908
Oh. Would she be helpful?
I'm checking out
Christabel LaMotte.

171
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,977
She's a poet,
writing around about 1 859.

172
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,989
Yes, yes. Why would you
be interested in her?

173
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,925
Oh, nothing. It's just
I had some requests
about Ellen Ash's papers.

174
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,928
But LaMotte's name
came up, so...

175
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:27,727
The keeper of Ellen's flame.
I mean, that's the bottom
of the food chain, old sport.

176
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,361
Yeah, but I got to stay
on the food chain, old sport.
That's why I do it.

177
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,962
Right. Well,
" Publish or perish,"
as they say.

178
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,564
Or in your case,
" Perish or perish."

179
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,645
So would she...
this Maud Bailey person?

180
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,012
Oh, yes, but I'd be careful
if I were you.

181
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,746
Why? What's she like?
Well, she thicks men's blood
with cold.

182
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,449
Oh, great.
Or if you prefer
the American vernacular...

183
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,991
she's a regular ballbreaker.

184
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,167
Mr. Michell?

185
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,665
What? I'm sorry.
Roland Michell.

186
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,677
Yes.

187
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,078
You're Maud.
Bailey. Dr. Bailey, yes.

188
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:19,879
There's nothing in my index.
No mention of Ash at all.

189
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,886
Well, Ash and LaMotte
definitely met.

190
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,980
Really? When?
June, 1 859.

191
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,184
At a dinner party
given by Crabb-Robinson.

192
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,422
And you jumped
from that to the idea
that they corresponded.

193
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,729
I found an unfinished draft
of a letter in a book...

194
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,962
Addressed to LaMotte?
No,just " Dear Madame."

195
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,005
But there were three women
at Crabb-Robinson's
dinner party,

196
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,199
and out of the three
it's likeliest to be LaMotte.

197
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,141
So maybe there's something
in LaMotte's letters.

198
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,771
There aren't many
from the Richmond period...
the time you're interested in.

199
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,748
I'm descended
from Christabel, actually.
I'm her niece, thrice removed.

200
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,715
Three grades.
That's what "thrice"
usually means.

201
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,191
Oh, maybe
I shouldn't have come.

202
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:06,197
It does seem
rather pointless.

203
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:10,597
Well, I supposed since you're
here, you could have a look
through Blanche's diary.

204
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,035
Who's Blanche?
Blanche Glover.

205
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,074
Christabel's companion.
Her lover.

206
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,268
Oh, you look surprised.

207
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,505
I didn't know she was...
Didn't know
she was a lesbian.

208
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,638
No. I mean,
don't get me wrong,
I like lesbians.

209
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,206
Yes, well, unfortunately,
they didn't have
video cameras in those days,

210
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,514
so you're out of luck.

211
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,781
Now I see why you think
it's so unlikely.

212
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:33,086
Not from that point of view.
I mean, God, she could
have been bisexual.

213
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,183
There's no evidence she was,
but in theory...

214
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,093
Did you not do any reading
before you came?

215
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,393
Is this like an oral exam?
Yes, I suppose it is.

216
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,129
I mean, you don't know
the first thing about her,
and yet you make these leaps.

217
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:47,263
Hey, you're the one
who called her a lesbian,
not me.

218
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,411
Letters, letters, letters.

219
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,422
Not for me.

220
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,653
Letters I am not meant
to know or see.

221
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,639
Thank you,Jane.

222
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,977
- You do not have to
hide them from me.
- I'm not hiding them.

223
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:40,358
You say they are not hidden,
but they are.

224
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,987
Tucked away...
as if they were
from Cupid himself.

225
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,933
What does he want?

226
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,095
To be my friend.
Friend.

227
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,141
They always try
and give what they want
a decent name.

228
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:01,168
Blanche, no.
No, Blanche, listen.

229
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:07,514
What we have...
is ours.

230
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,645
No one can change that.

231
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,662
'Tis already changed.

232
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:38,107
- Find anything?
- Maybe.

233
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,167
So what are
those bookmarks then?

234
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,344
Blanche writes about letters.

235
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,404
Letters, letters that Christabel
wrote and received.

236
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,507
And it nearly
drove Blanche crazy.

237
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,518
Where are they?

238
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,680
Lost. Destroyed. Who knows?
There's lots we haven't got.

239
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,725
Not one of Blanche's
paintings has ever
turned up, for instance.

240
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,894
So who do you think
wrote the letters?

241
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,396
We've never been able
to verify who he was,

242
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,865
but Ash certainly
isn't one of the candidates.

243
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,167
You've got nothing.
I mean,
it's just a thought.

244
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,172
Of course, I've thrown out
a lot of thoughts today,

245
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,708
and you've pretty much
shot them all down, so...

246
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,542
Yes, well,
it seems like a bit of
a wild-goose chase to me.

247
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,547
I'd like to do
some more reading.

248
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,051
I suppose you'll wish to
stay here overnight then?

249
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,747
Well, I can't really afford
to stay overnight.

250
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,722
Unless you want me huddled
downstairs in your doorway.

251
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,692
I suppose I could put up
with you for one evening,
couldn't I?

252
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,863
No doubt you know
Fergus Wolfe then.

253
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,273
I'm sorry.
Uh, yeah, we're in
the same department.

254
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:14,039
I imagine that
he told you that we're...

255
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,046
occasionally
on together.

256
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:20,778
- No, he didn't.
- Well, did he...

257
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:24,219
Did he say anything...
about me?

258
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,348
Uh...

259
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,193
No.

260
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,895
Right. I'll use
the bathroom first.
Get out of your way.

261
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,060
Please. I'm just sort of
a brush and flush
kind of guy, so...

262
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,466
Forget I said that.

263
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,532
Maud.

264
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,669
Can I show you something?

265
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:04,095
Are these...
How did you get...
Those are the originals.

266
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,096
I took them.
I sort of stole them.
Took them?

267
00:21:06,164 --> 00:21:08,132
Where from?
The London Library.

268
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,998
How could you do that?
It was on impulse.

269
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,867
Impulse?

270
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,271
Right. I've seen that
take-what-you-want attitude
in other...

271
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,275
What, in other Americans?

272
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:22,302
God, what is it with
you people and Americans?

273
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,781
Look, I know that
I shouldn't have taken them.
I know that.

274
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,080
But, Maud, I want to
find out what happened?

275
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,983
Did he or didn't he
send the letter?

276
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,988
You might not buy
into my theory,
but to me,

277
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:33,183
Blanche's diary
suggests that it's possible.

278
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,852
Wouldn't someone
have unearthed
a thing like this?

279
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:39,226
- That's what makes it so big.
- Potentially so big.

280
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,859
- Well, no one has.
- Probably because
those were never sent.

281
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,593
Are you doing your homework?

282
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,859
No, I'm just...
writing stuff.

283
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,870
Stuff for me.
It's nothing.

284
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,032
You're a closet poet.
Uh...

285
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,576
more like basement,
really.

286
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,238
I'm just, uh,
just fooling around.

287
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,440
Is that what
you want to be
when you grow up?

288
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:34,042
No, I'm gonna
be safe and teach
like everybody else.

289
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,515
Besides,
there's no such thing
as poets anymore.

290
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:43,027
Well... poet,

291
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:47,293
do you want a secret
about his family home
before you go?

292
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,062
Michell's late again.

293
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,534
Roland asked for
another day off, Fergus.

294
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,540
Oh, really?
Where's he gone?

295
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:00,009
I didn't ask,
and he didn't say.

296
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,536
He's American, for God's sake.
He's probably off
trafficking drugs.

297
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,778
Did his new discovery
lead to anything?

298
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,218
Ash's Vico.
Are you dreaming?

299
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:13,280
Vico?
No, no, this had something
to do with Christabel LaMotte.

300
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:16,759
He went to see
Dr. Bailey in Lincoln...
a woman.

301
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:20,264
LaMotte. Hmm. No.

302
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,267
- Well, it probably came
to nothing then.
- Exactly.

303
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,895
Or he would have told you.

304
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,665
Wouldn't he?

305
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,143
Seal Court's
over there.

306
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,951
So how long
did Christabel live at
this Seal Court place?

307
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:49,152
Ages. The last 20
or so years of her life.

308
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,329
Excuse me.
Sorry.

309
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,798
"To a dusty shelf
we aspire."

310
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,770
You should drop by Seal Court
before the train.

311
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,002
And what do you do
in London, Mr. Michell?

312
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:10,605
Are you a teacher as well?
No, not yet.
I'm doing a fellowship.

313
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:14,482
- Which means what exactly?
- On the dole.

314
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,120
Um, my field's
Victorian poetry.

315
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,887
We had ourselves a poet
in this house once.

316
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,624
Terrible, sentimental stuff
about God and death
and the dew and fairies.

317
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:30,134
Why don't you show
this young man
Christabel's room, Maud?

318
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,399
And why don't you
stay tonight?

319
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,740
You're under no obligation
to stay, of course.

320
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,402
It's justJoan's way.
Misses our daughter.

321
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,776
Quite a drive back,
actually.
No, we're fine.

322
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,838
Oh, well.

323
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:46,509
Hardly ever come up here.

324
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:51,215
With the wheelchair,
of course, we bunk down
on the ground floor.

325
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:59,621
I haven't been up here
since I was a child.

326
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,993
Maud, is this the photograph
at your house?

327
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:08,232
Yes, that's
Christabel's niece, May.

328
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,240
That's my
great-great-grandmother.

329
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,276
Christabel wrote dozens of poems
about this place.

330
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:24,712
"Haunted
are they who haunt our dreams
and weaken our desires...

331
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,723
"and turn us
from a solid face.

332
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:31,854
"And in the depth
of wintery night, they slumber
in the night and bright.

333
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,697
"Dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend.

334
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,635
"Dolly's silent sympathy
lasts without end.

335
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,800
"No rush of action,
this is our doom.

336
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,812
To live a long life out
in a dark room. "

337
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,777
Maud.

338
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,911
It's pretty
incredible, huh?

339
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,228
Fergus, it's me.

340
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:10,325
l-I'm out of town tonight
on business.

341
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:14,065
I've stumbled onto a connection
between Christabel
and Randolph Ash...

342
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,073
and have a few questions
for you.

343
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:21,443
Call me on 0 1 5-2263 2 4 1 6.

344
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,549
Roland.

345
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,389
- Roland.

346
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,865
Roland. Roland.
No!

347
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,131
Roland, it's me.
It's Maud.

348
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,374
- What is it?
- Listen.

349
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:55,273
" Dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend.

350
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:59,943
Dolly's silent sympathy
lasts without end. "

351
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,456
God.

352
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,986
I was so sure.

353
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,691
Sympathy.
Sympathy.

354
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,825
Sympathy, meaning what?

355
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,194
Mutual affection
or understanding.

356
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:57,469
Favor pity or even accord.
But that's not it, is it?

357
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,178
That's what she told her.

358
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,139
She uses silent sympathy
in a more classical context.

359
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,345
Like structural support.
Dolly conceals it.

360
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,913
Yes, but not within,
beneath.

361
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,055
There's a door.
There's a door.

362
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,608
- I can't believe it.
- Let me see.

363
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,618
Be-Be careful.
They're very precious.
I'll be very careful.

364
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,620
Oh, God, we shouldn't
be doing this.

365
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:47,556
What do you mean,
we shouldn't be doing this?
Why'd you drag me up here then?

366
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,820
What are you doing?
I'm going to read.

367
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,828
Stop. We've got to
ask the Baileys.

368
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,797
You ask,
and the next time you see these
is under glass in New Mexico.

369
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,697
Stop it.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
All right. All right.

370
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,736
But can we please
at least do it properly?

371
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,237
Let me run downstairs
and get some note cards
and some pencils.

372
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,433
All right.
Go, go! Hurry!

373
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,873
Look at this. We've got
Ash and Christabel's
letters here.

374
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,881
Look. Come here.
Listen.
What?

375
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,645
"Dear Miss LaMotte:

376
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,653
"It was a great pleasure
to talk to you...

377
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:52,622
"at dear
Crabb-Robinson's party.

378
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,859
" May I hope that you too
enjoyed our talk.

379
00:29:56,928 --> 00:30:00,329
And may I have the pleasure
of calling on you."

380
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,001
She says, " No,
but you may write.

381
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,063
"Would you rather
not have a letter,
however imperfect,

382
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,110
"than a plate
of cucumber sandwiches,

383
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,170
"however exquisitely
fine cut?

384
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:19,011
Know you would,
and so would I. "

385
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:27,218
 "I was entranced
and moved by your brief
portrait of your father. "

386
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,193
"I write nonsense,
but if you can't write again,

387
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,923
"you shall have a sober essay
on what you will.

388
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,524
"Yours to command
in some things.

389
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,535
"Where I was born,
Christabel Lamotte."

390
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,798
"was a small place too.

391
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:43,340
" Not like this.
Not bare.

392
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,706
"A brilliant, dusty hutch
of mystery"...

393
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:48,871
 Randolph]
is a cabinet of curiosities.

394
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,916
What did my eyes
first light on?

395
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,544
I am a creature of my pen.

396
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,783
My pen is the best part
of me.

397
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,621
I send you now
two more poems.

398
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,753
I eagerly read
your mythic tales of mire...

399
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,923
and found them
both charming and sad.

400
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:12,026
Your verse is rich,
but perhaps the metaphor
is richer.

401
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,037
Dear Mr. Ash:

402
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:17,233
I live circumscribed
and self-communing.

403
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,242
It is best so.

404
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:23,474
Not like a princess
in the thicket, more like
a spider in her web.

405
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:28,008
"Inclined to snap at visitors
or trespassers,

406
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:31,647
"not perceiving the distinction
until too late.

407
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,123
Thus, it is unwise to call. "

408
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,558
I know you live very quietly.

409
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,755
but I could be very quiet.

410
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,264
I only want to discuss
Dante and Shakespeare,

411
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,062
Wordsworth, Coleridge,
and Goethe.

412
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:48,265
Not forgetting, of course,
Christabel LaMotte...

413
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,672
and the ambitious
fairy project.

414
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,488
 Christabel]
Oh, sir, things flicker
and shift.

415
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,257
All spangle and sparkle
and flashes.

416
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,789
I have sat all this long evening
by my fireside,

417
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,632
turning towards
a caving in,

418
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:22,138
the crumbling
of the consumed coals,

419
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:25,004
to where I am leading myself...

420
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,874
to lifeless dust, sir.

421
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:33,646
My dear friend... for I may
call myself a friend, may I not?

422
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,283
I speak to you as I would
speak to any person...

423
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,552
who possesses my true thoughts.

424
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,957
For my true thoughts
have spent more time
in your company...

425
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:47,259
than in anyone else's
these last few weeks.

426
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,800
Where my thoughts are,

427
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,926
there am I in truth.

428
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,701
"My dear friend:
It has been borne in upon me...

429
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:01,643
that there are dangers
in our continued conversation."

430
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,977
The world would not look well
upon letters...

431
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:07,313
between a woman living
in shared solitude as I do...

432
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,376
and a man.

433
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:13,652
Even if that man
were a great poet.

434
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,319
And if one is to live
in this way,

435
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:20,797
it is imperative
to appear respectable
in the eyes of that world...

436
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,060
and your wife.

437
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,538
It is a sealed pact.

438
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:31,439
It is a chosen way oflife
in which I have been
wondrously happy...

439
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,740
and not alone in being so.

440
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:37,542
"I have chosen a way,
dear friend,

441
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,607
"I must hold to it.

442
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,449
" Be patient.
Be generous. Forgive.

443
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:48,424
"May I also request
that you return
my correspondence to me.

444
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:52,122
"In this way,
at least our letters
will remain together.

445
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,791
"I have known incandescence...

446
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,768
"and must decline
to sample it any further.

447
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,436
"This now goes to the post.

448
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:06,238
Forgive its faults
and forgive me.
Christabel."

449
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,637
My dear Christabel:

450
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,616
Your letter came as a shock
to me, I will confess.

451
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:20,156
I was at first
not only shocked, but angry
that you should write so.

452
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,588
As you've asked about my wife,
however, I will tell you.

453
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,125
I love Ellen,
but not as I love you.

454
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,896
There are good reasons
which I cannot discuss
why my love for you...

455
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,533
may not hurt her.

456
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:41,635
I do not feel I have been
a proper wife to you, Randolph.

457
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:44,237
Without children,
without ever
any kind of physical...

458
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,749
Nonsense, Ellen.

459
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,877
Nonsense.

460
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,648
There are many
types of love.

461
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,793
All sorts.

462
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:02,458
And ours
are good between us.

463
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,861
It has been most profound.

464
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:13,337
 I must say to you
what is in my mind.

465
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,642
I have called you my muse,
and so you are.

466
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,706
I could call you
with even greater truth...

467
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,309
my love.

468
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,889
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? What?
Don't do that. What?

469
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,426
So he sends his response.
He sends her more letters.

470
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,860
She doesn't answer them.
She ignores them.

471
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,489
Typical.

472
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,466
No. She-She chose her life
with Blanche.

473
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:41,027
It's not typical.
It's remarkable.

474
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:49,004
"I shall hope against hope
that this note is the dove...

475
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,844
"which will return with
the wished-for olive branch.

476
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:55,579
My letters are like
Noah's ravens... they have
sped out across the Thames. "

477
00:35:55,653 --> 00:36:00,852
They have
sped out across the Thames
and yet have not returned.

478
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,383
I send this note by hand
in the hope that
you might receive it.

479
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:14,199
Where are the letters?

480
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,331
They're gone.

481
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:22,343
I tore them up.
I burned them.

482
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:24,745
And the others
from my desk?

483
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,841
The same.

484
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:33,022
I beg for us
to be as we were,
Christabel.

485
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,184
Sweetheart, please.

486
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:45,128
This house, so happy once,

487
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:49,139
is full of weeping and wailing
and black headaches.

488
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,732
I ask myself
to whom I may turn...

489
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:55,245
and think of you,
my friend...

490
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:59,044
the unwitting cause
of all this grief.

491
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,152
I shan't forget the first
glimpse of your form...

492
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:14,228
illuminated as it was
by flashes of sunlight.

493
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:17,699
I have dreamt nightly
of your face.

494
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:22,171
To walk to the landscape
of my life with the rhythms
of your writing...

495
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,174
ringing in my ears.

496
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,710
 I shall never forget
our shining progress...

497
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,507
towards one another.

498
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:34,677
Never have I felt
such a concentration
of my entire being.

499
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,449
I cannot let you
burn me up,

500
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:41,082
nor can I resist you.

501
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:46,460
No mere human
can stand in a fire
and not be consumed.

502
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:55,167
You mind reading
that last part out
one more time?

503
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,933
"I cannot let you
burn me up,

504
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:05,011
"nor can I resist you.

505
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:07,482
"No mere human
can stand in a fire...

506
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:09,985
and not be consumed."

507
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:14,254
- That?
- Yeah.

508
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:21,824
Thank you and...

509
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:26,768
"And I took your hand.
Mine rested in yours...

510
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:29,965
with trust and relief."

511
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,479
Do you have regrets?

512
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:48,487
I should regret venturing out
to Crabb-Robinson's party
that evening.

513
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,025
I should regret it,
but I do not.

514
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,899
Not even in that
most sensible corner
of my heart.

515
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,870
What are we to do?

516
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:12,939
"I do not wish to
damage your life.

517
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,282
"Nonetheless, I shall
be in the church
at noon tomorrow,

518
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,887
"with what strikes me
as the holiest of prayers...

519
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:25,923
"that you should join me
on a journey to Yorkshire...

520
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:30,399
and journey out of time
beyond our lives
here on Earth."

521
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,200
This is unbelievable.
That was the last one.

522
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,405
You're kidding me.
No.

523
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:48,051
Well, did she go
with him or not?
Hands up.!

524
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,815
You two?

525
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:58,284
- What's this then?
There's been
no harm done, George.

526
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,262
How do we know
if harm's been done?

527
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,994
I think it was very clever
of Maud to find your treasure.

528
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:09,472
Yes. Well, must
take advice,Joanie.

529
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,303
How long before Sir George
takes advice?

530
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:17,313
He'll dither around for
a while, but not long.

531
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:20,441
Blanche's diary has nothing
for that period.

532
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,611
What about Ellen Ash?
Did she keep a journal?

533
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,985
Yeah, in London,
but it's mostly just
boring housewife stuff.

534
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:30,152
God is in the boring
housewife stuff.
We should check it.

535
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,706
Bailey here.
Bailey.

536
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,935
Is that Dr. Heath?

537
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,343
No. Um, I'm a friend
of Maud Bailey's.

538
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,347
I was wondering,
is she there?

539
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:55,943
No, she isn't.
Could you get off the line?
I'm expecting the doctor.

540
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,318
Oh, um, have you seen
Roland Michell?

541
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:01,825
Not since
this morning, no.

542
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,826
But his work
went well, did it?

543
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:08,024
The fairy poem?
I haven't the foggiest idea.

544
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,032
Do you mean
Christabel LaMotte?

545
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,762
Get off the line!

546
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:31,379
I looked in Ellen's diary.
There's nothing.

547
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:36,085
But, uh, this should
cheer you up.

548
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,996
It's in her correspondence.

549
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,056
I'm not going to ask
if this is the original.

550
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,431
I wouldn't.

551
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,604
" Dear Mrs. Ash:

552
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,606
"I'm at present
totally unknown to you,

553
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,871
"but I have something
to impart to which...

554
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:59,382
"closely concerns both of us
and is in my case a matter
of life and death.

555
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:04,513
"May I trespass on your time
and come to see you?

556
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:09,548
"You would do wrong
to keep this evidence
which I send to you now.

557
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,187
"It is not mine,
it is also not yours.

558
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:16,029
"What I say is true and urgent
as you will come to see.

559
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,830
Yours sincerely,
Blanche Glover. "

560
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,377
Mrs. Ash.

561
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:36,385
Maybe Blanche didn't
tear the letters but kept them
and showed them to Ellen.

562
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:39,422
 Roland]
It all fits beautifully.

563
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:43,984
Well, perhaps, um,
both of our departments
should work on this together.

564
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,791
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know. Do you?

565
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,264
No. I wanna go after them.
I wanna find out what happened.

566
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:53,064
I wanna go to Yorkshire
and follow their trail.
I need to know.

567
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:57,665
I thought you were mad
when you came to Lincoln
with your stolen letter.

568
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,245
Now I feel
exactly the same.

569
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:07,583
I haven't really thanked you.

570
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:11,485
I mean, properly,
for all of this.

571
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:15,082
I have difficulty
with compliments and such.

572
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,894
Giving or receiving?

573
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:20,021
Both, actually.

574
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,266
Well, I won't tell you
you're amazing-looking then.

575
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,963
You're probably
sick of hearing it.
Thank you. It's...

576
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,369
I'm the last guy
who'd act on it,
with Fergus and all.

577
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,140
- What does "and all" mean?
- Nothing.Just a little
problem that I have socially.

578
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,703
Do you take anything for it?

579
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,807
It's not that kind
of a problem.

580
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:45,412
It's just relationships
on the whole. They're
not really for me.

581
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:50,358
- Anyway...
- Yes...

582
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:54,295
anyway... thank you.

583
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,663
You're welcome.

584
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,965
Thank you for agreeing
to meet me, Professor.

585
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,977
Well, you made me
rather curious.
Drink, sir?

586
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,104
Scotch with
just a dash of soda.

587
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,705
Sir? Thank you.
Uh, I'll have the same.
Thank you.

588
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:16,818
Um, I wanted to learn
of the connection...

589
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,879
between Ash
and Christabel LaMotte.

590
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,792
LaMotte and Ash?
There isn't any.

591
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,794
Well, Roland Michell
has made a discovery...

592
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,194
with a colleague of mine,
Maud Bailey.

593
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:29,596
I'm sorry.
Who the hell
is Roland Michell?

594
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,763
Oh, Blackadder's
research assistant.
American.

595
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,830
Blondish.
Well, anyway,
he seems to know you.

596
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,842
And he thinks
it's important.

597
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,378
And does Blackadder agree?

598
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,846
I don't believe
he knows anything about it.

599
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,983
Do you wish to
be lunched separately?

600
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,753
Respectably,
elsewhere from me?

601
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,688
I want to be with you.

602
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:30,420
I understood that was
what we had decided.

603
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:35,727
These four weeks
only are ours...

604
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,233
but ours alone.

605
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,868
Oh, l, uh...

606
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,117
I hope you will
accept this ring.

607
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,710
I have brought a ring too.

608
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,553
You see?

609
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,855
Proof of my resolution.

610
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,978
You take my breath away.

611
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,237
Not yet.

612
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,106
No. Not yet.

613
00:46:57,381 --> 00:47:00,612
Shall we go out,
then, to explore?

614
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,929
There's your bathroom.

615
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:26,433
Bluebirds.

616
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,571
Your lovely view.

617
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,080
And, of course, the bed.

618
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,793
We'll look
for another hotel.

619
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:45,795
But this is
where Ash stayed.

620
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,797
Well, then we'll
have to share a room.

621
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,266
I can bring up
a folding bed for one of you,
if that's your problem.

622
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,671
We work together, actually.
It's not...

623
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,673
We were expecting
two rooms.
Right.

624
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:00,574
I'm sure it's more complicated
than I can imagine.

625
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:22,354
That's a lovely brooch
you're wearing, miss.

626
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,957
I reckon it could be one of
Issac Greenberg's designs.

627
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:29,062
I'll, uh, get the book
and see if I can tell.

628
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,738
Where did you get this?

629
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:42,080
I've had it for ages.
It was in the family
dress-up box.

630
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,824
Don't you see?
Ash bought the brooch
for Ellen.

631
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:53,795
The clasped hands.
Here in Whitby.
We knew that.

632
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,923
And this for Christabel.
Oh, right.

633
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:58,365
So while he was buying this,
he said, um,

634
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,699
"Yes, I'll have
the eternal embrace
for my wife."

635
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,730
No, he wouldn't have said
anything. He would have
just bought the brooch.

636
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:07,606
Christabel would have seen.
It was accepted between them.

637
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,579
Are you writing
fiction now?

638
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:15,042
Maybe.

639
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,088
I'm having fun.

640
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,147
Are you?

641
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,218
Yes, I suppose I am.

642
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,520
Don't grimace
when you say it.
It's more convincing.

643
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:32,194
I suppose
I can be a touch...

644
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:35,898
empirical at times.

645
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,032
Just a touch.

646
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:42,211
Hey, you wanna
go for a walk
or something?

647
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:44,213
I mean,
out in the hills.

648
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:47,307
 For sure
it's earlier than the death
of Victoria's Albert.

649
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:51,150
Probably late '50s.
1 860s maybe.

650
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,280
1 859?

651
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,950
Ish?

652
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,770
I think we're getting
near Thomason Falls.

653
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,810
Cropper mentions it...
Mortimer Cropper?

654
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:18,939
Yeah, Ash's biographer.
All-purpose asshole.

655
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,348
He's literally trekked
every step of Ash's life.

656
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,114
He's happy to tell you
that too.
More than happy, I'm sure.

657
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,951
You know him, huh?

658
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:44,165
That is beautiful.

659
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:50,144
Maud. What?

660
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,444
I think Christabel
did come here.

661
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,848
Listen.

662
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:02,119
"Three elements combined
to make the fourth.

663
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,628
" But above the water
and the light,
together made...

664
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,357
a halo
in the darkened cave. "

665
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:12,198
That poem's dated
1 859,July.

666
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,539
See if there's
a cave behind it.

667
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,972
That might be
all the proof we need.

668
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,273
Ah...

669
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,548
I know this is
an awfully repressed
sort of English thing to say,

670
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,680
but what the hell
are you doing?

671
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,657
There's only one way
to find out.

672
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:45,359
Of course, we could
have just asked someone.

673
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,021
Whoo! Maud! Maud!

674
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:16,827
 Laughing Continues]
I found it.!

675
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,342
Your hands are shaking.

676
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,438
Are you afraid?

677
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,608
No.

678
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,677
A little.

679
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:53,413
"These are and were there.

680
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:58,086
"The garden and the tree,
the serpent at its root.

681
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:03,030
"The fruit of gold, the woman
in the shadow of the boughs.

682
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:07,229
"The running water
and the grassy space.

683
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,603
They are and were there."

684
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,303
I don't mind that.

685
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:23,113
See, you could grow
to like Ash.

686
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:26,952
Yes.

687
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,491
He's sort of a soft-core
misogynist.

688
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,737
Why do you always
tie your hair up like that?

689
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,870
It has to do
with Fergus Wolfe mostly.

690
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:53,211
Fergus?
How to do with Fergus?

691
00:55:56,186 --> 00:56:00,316
When we met,
he drove me mad quoting Yeats.

692
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,951
"Who could love you
for yourself alone
and not your yellow hair?"

693
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,154
Yes.

694
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:10,188
And then I was accused once
by my sister feminists
at a conference...

695
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,530
of dyeing it
to attract men.

696
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,729
Really?
Yes.

697
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:18,137
So I shaved it off,
all of it.

698
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,371
And did he?

699
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:25,778
Did who what?
Fergus love you
without your yellow hair?

700
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,249
No.

701
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,309
We thought of that.

702
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:35,053
We drove each other mad.
I don't even like him,

703
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:38,060
but I can't seem to...
Freud.

704
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:40,289
"On the other side of attraction
lies repulsion."

705
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,824
Or was that Calvin Klein?

706
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,434
- Do you believe that?
- Uh, I wouldn't know.

707
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:58,573
I don't really allow myself
to do that AshlChristabel
grand passion kind of thing.

708
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,548
Allow?
Yeah.

709
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:04,883
Jealousy, obsession, all that.
Not anymore.

710
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:08,390
You're lucky then.

711
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:12,554
It all gets so...
just such a tangle.

712
00:57:12,629 --> 00:57:15,621
It's a tangle
most people want.

713
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,234
Not me though.

714
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:23,500
My antics made
a lot of people unhappy.

715
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,406
One horribly so.

716
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,572
For me,

717
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:40,518
whenever I feel
anything for anyone, l...

718
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,785
I go cold all over.

719
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:47,853
- What makes you do that?
- Fear, I suppose.

720
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:53,597
Fear of being burned up...
by love.

721
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,963
Listen to us.

722
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:03,604
Yes. Aren't we just maudlin?

723
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:07,181
Maud, you should
let your hair out.

724
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,117
You should let it breathe.
And don't do the ice thing,

725
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:12,654
'cause you have nothing
to worry about from me.

726
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:16,419
Christabel said,
" Fear all men."

727
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,951
Well, Christabel
didn't know me.

728
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,828
I don't want to take
anything from you.

729
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:30,230
So, then, we're both...
perfectly safe.

730
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,570
Right.

731
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:23,820
How can we bear it?

732
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:26,953
Every day
we will have less.

733
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,932
Would you rather
have had nothing?

734
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:38,940
No.

735
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:43,377
I thank God
that if there had to be
a dragon it was you.

736
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:34,759
Wait. Wait.

737
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:46,466
No. I was just trying to get out
from under the covers.
No. No.

738
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,273
This is... We shouldn't
be doing this.
It's dangerous.

739
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:56,441
Well, I really...
No, because I like you.
I like you a lot.

740
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:00,979
I just don't want
to blow it here, and...

741
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:03,457
Well, it doesn't matter
to me, honestly.

742
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:05,926
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

743
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:17,065
Sorry. I think
we're probably just...

744
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,405
In these cramped quarters.
It was a mistake.

745
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:26,105
Maud. Maud.!

746
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,883
I didn't mean that.

747
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,949
Let's not beat
the thing dead.

748
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:08,115
It happened, it's over
and we're adults.

749
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:10,955
Speak for yourself.

750
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:15,225
I can't imagine
what you're like after you
actually sleep with someone.

751
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:24,734
Maud, I think
that you are very...

752
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:27,241
You know?

753
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,676
No, I don't know.

754
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:35,645
So, what, we're friends
now, is that it?

755
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:41,314
Yeah. That's a lot.

756
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:43,358
No, I agree.
It's fine.

757
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:48,261
Yeah. It's perfect.

758
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:52,097
Anyway, we're getting
off the track here.

759
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:55,535
We came to investigate
them, not us.

760
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:12,119
So what ever happened
to Blanche?
Blanche drowned.

761
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,122
Oh.

762
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:18,688
Where was Christabel?
We don't know
where she was.

763
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:21,093
The year before's
a bit blank too.

764
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:23,997
You don't know where she was
that entire year?

765
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:26,864
There's some speculation
that she went to France,

766
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:29,234
but I have nothing
to support that.

767
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:36,808
Okay, so... Christabel
comes here with Ash
and then disappears.

768
01:03:36,879 --> 01:03:38,904
On paper, at least.

769
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,883
Yes.
And Blanche suicides.

770
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:45,386
Jesus.

771
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,361
- What are you doing?

772
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:58,730
It's a poem.
I've been writing it
as I've watched you.

773
01:03:58,801 --> 01:04:00,962
You're not pleased with it?

774
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:05,599
On the contrary.
I think it perfectly expresses
thejoy I have felt with you.

775
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,905
Then why that?

776
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:11,003
These feelings...
I want them to survive.

777
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,106
I know I can never
declare all this...

778
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:17,050
this love.

779
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,954
There. I've said it.
I know it cannot be declared
to the world.

780
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:25,084
What I may do is scatter
these words from the train...

781
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:27,425
and hope that
they somehow take root.

782
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:32,331
They will flourish.
I swear it.

783
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:24,650
So... what next?

784
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,745
I mean, for you.

785
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:29,256
I suppose I'll check
through the archives...

786
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:32,260
and see if there's
any clue at all where Christabel
might have been that year.

787
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,489
Good.

788
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:38,397
I guess I'll just, uh...

789
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:41,095
hell, I don't know...

790
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,162
go look up shit
on the microfiche.

791
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,265
Suffer over you.

792
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,833
Good-bye.

793
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:50,902
See ya.

794
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:02,846
Lost your way?
Don't do tours here.

795
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,318
Sir George Bailey?
Who wants to know?

796
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,982
Professor Mortimer Cropper,
curator of the Stan Collection,

797
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:10,958
Robert De Leon University,
Harmony City, New Mexico.

798
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,086
And this is Dr. Wolfe.
Good morning.

799
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:16,029
I'm a busy man.
My wife's ill.

800
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:18,862
I can quite understand
that, sir.

801
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:21,926
Sources have led me to believe
that you may be in possession...

802
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:26,998
of some documentation
by Randolph Henry Ash.

803
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,544
Whoa.
Don't shoot, please.

804
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:32,274
Get off my land.

805
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,215
Do you have any idea
what we're talking about here?

806
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:37,980
Do you? Do you have
any idea how much...

807
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,716
such pieces,
if they existed,

808
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,623
how much
they would be worth?

809
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,717
Worth?

810
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:56,864
Do you mind if we swing
past the university?

811
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:59,032
Bit of unfinished
business.

812
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:03,204
Miss Bailey, I presume.
The accomplice.

813
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:05,679
The very same.

814
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:09,582
Good God,you're
like Bonnie and Clyde.

815
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,916
Come on.
I need a picture of her.

816
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:15,047
I've never seen you
like this.Just go.

817
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:18,525
Take the Porsche
and go.

818
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,490
Fergus, what?

819
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:56,592
Uh, if Fergus went out
to get Indian food, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna feel really stupid.

820
01:08:56,665 --> 01:09:00,192
No, he didn't.

821
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:02,760
India wouldn't be
far enough away, actually.

822
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,736
Come inside. I'll explain.

823
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:12,975
You sure? I mean,
about me coming in.

824
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:16,745
Yes, very.

825
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:19,947
So I left Fergus a message
from Seal Court,

826
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:22,991
which apparently
put him on our trail,

827
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:27,620
and he came here looking
for answers... he and Cropper
from the sound of it.

828
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:30,392
So that was Cropper's
car outside?

829
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,957
I think Fergus
has found something.

830
01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:35,560
He's been spooking
around the museum,

831
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:39,335
sending out
a bunch of faxes.

832
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:44,072
I wouldn't be
so quick to do that.

833
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:46,580
Yeah.

834
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:52,111
The British Museum
fax log sheet.

835
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,089
"To the University of Muntz
from Fergus Wolfe.

836
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:58,854
"Subject: Christabel LaMotte.
Information on LaMotte
genealogy.

837
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:03,194
Request loan of journal
of Sabine de Concasse."

838
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:05,495
Unfortunately for Fergus,
we have to log our faxes.

839
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:08,628
You're shameless.

840
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:23,044
So what are we
gonna do now?

841
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:26,519
We gonna try to beat 'em
to France, or...

842
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:32,558
or are we just
gonna stare at each other?

843
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,858
That is the question,
isn't it?

844
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:36,864
Mm-hmm.

845
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:39,526
I have another one
for you.
What's that?

846
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:41,900
What are you really
doing here?

847
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,872
Well, l, uh...

848
01:10:49,778 --> 01:10:51,712
I needed to see your face.

849
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:03,954
I just want to let you know
that whatever happened
in Whitby,

850
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:07,928
which unfortunately
was not much,

851
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:14,158
is not because
anything that you did.

852
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,306
Not at all.

853
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,911
I just didn't want
to jump into something.

854
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:29,949
I mean, I did
and I do... want to.

855
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,278
Badly.

856
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,955
I just didn't
want to mess this up.

857
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,590
And I just want to see...

858
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:52,266
I want to see if there's
an us in you and me.

859
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:59,874
Would-Would you like that?

860
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,893
I'll take that
as a yes.

861
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:46,086
Ah, oui. Excusez-moi.
Nous sommes confreres.

862
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:48,095
When will she be back?

863
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:52,364
Could you check for us?

864
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:21,725
- She will return on Thursday.
- Okay.

865
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:23,731
Au revoir.
Merci.

866
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:28,896
You and your shoplifting, huh?
I can't take you anywhere.

867
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:47,287
" Dear Professor Wolfe:
Since I wrote to you last,
I've made another discovery.

868
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,824
"Amongst Sabine's papers
was her journal...

869
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:53,919
"in which she writes
about LaMotte's visit
to Brittany in 1 859...

870
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:57,432
and the subsequent arrival
of a mysterious visitor. "

871
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:07,433
I know how things are.
I wish to help you.

872
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,267
You know how things are, do you?
Tell me, Cousin Sabine,

873
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:13,797
how do you think
things are with me?

874
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:16,003
I'm a grown woman.
You are a girl.

875
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:18,342
I do not desire
any help from you.

876
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:30,249
 Christabel's condition
became worse...

877
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:33,920
after she received word
from London...

878
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:37,397
that her close friend
had died.

879
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,969
She left England
because she was pregnant,

880
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,971
and Blanche
committed suicide.

881
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,837
What happened to the baby?

882
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,404
It must have been stillborn.

883
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:29,416
Or died.

884
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:31,714
Maybe it was taken in
by nuns or a local family.

885
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:35,120
And brought up here.

886
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:39,251
I'd like to think that,
but I wonder.

887
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:43,526
- You wonder what?
- I don't know. I just...

888
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:49,560
She comes here alone, hears
that Blanche has killed herself.

889
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:51,833
She's pregnant, distraught.

890
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,710
Geez.

891
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:59,338
I mean, I've no
evidence for it.

892
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:02,110
Can you imagine
how she must have felt?

893
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:06,180
Yes, I can.

894
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:20,930
So when do we see
Christabel next?

895
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:25,406
Autumn, 1 860,
in her references
to the Vestal Lights.

896
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:29,410
It was a group of women
who used to meet with mediums
on a regular basis.

897
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:33,574
Really? You know,
Ash hated spiritualists.
Pretty openly.

898
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:36,584
You think
that's a connection
we're tracking down?

899
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,643
I don't know.

900
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,659
Please, make a circle
with your hands.

901
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,106
Close your eyes.

902
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:07,676
White earth. Valley.

903
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:11,048
A waterfall.

904
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,282
A child. Love.

905
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:18,850
Two people. Deception.

906
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:23,489
Letters. Two people.

907
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:28,334
Words. Death.

908
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:30,997
What have you done?

909
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:33,871
A field.

910
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:36,911
Where is the child?

911
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:46,120
What have you done
with the child?

912
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:49,521
You have made
a murderess of me.

913
01:18:57,232 --> 01:19:00,292
"I understood at the time
that Mr. Ash was inquiring...

914
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:03,804
"after the spirit of
a departed child ofhis own,

915
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:06,864
"but I am told that
this could not be the case...

916
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:09,672
as Mr. Ash is childless."

917
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:19,616
Was there any mention
of Heloise in your research?

918
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:23,624
I don't know...
nor do I care.

919
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:26,456
Look, I've got to get back.

920
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:33,167
What's going on?
Nothing. I'm just tired,
that's all, so I should...

921
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:35,601
Come on.
What's wrong, seriously?

922
01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:40,732
I don't actually
want to discover
anything else about them.

923
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:43,710
You know?

924
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:47,078
I'm finding things out
that are just...

925
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:51,051
It's horrible when you
think about it really...
men and women together.

926
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:56,389
She gave up her life,
didn't she?

927
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:59,894
A perfectly decent life
that I've always admired.
And for what? For nothing.

928
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,589
No. Not nothing.

929
01:20:02,664 --> 01:20:07,727
Oh, really? For what then?
A child who died, a lover
drowned, and to what end?

930
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:11,637
She and Ash,
my own parents...

931
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:15,039
and every relationship
I've ever had...

932
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:20,207
It's all doomed.
We can't seem to help but
just tear each other apart.

933
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:24,446
Well, what about us?
You didn't include us.
What about that?

934
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,554
Look, l...

935
01:20:29,124 --> 01:20:31,592
I can't think about
anything right now.

936
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,597
So, okay.

937
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,998
So this is the, uh...
this is the icy pull-back
part then, huh?

938
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:44,198
- What?
- You know, you get close,
you pull away, you get...

939
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:46,638
I mean, this is part
of the pattern, right?

940
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:51,111
- What are you talking about?
- Your fear of men mantra
from Yorkshire.

941
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:53,807
That's what
I'm talking about.

942
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:56,976
I get it. It's cool.
If that's the way you play it,
that's the way play it.

943
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:59,486
Do you honestly believe that?

944
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:04,856
Is that what you think
this is to me? A game? Is it?

945
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:13,265
Well, finally, then,
all this talk of us really
comes to nothing, doesn't it?

946
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:16,168
Yes, I guess you're right.
It's nothing.

947
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:56,268
Dear Professor Blackadder:

948
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:59,711
I did try to tell you
about my discovery before...

949
01:21:59,781 --> 01:22:02,716
but found that I couldn't.

950
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:06,413
Please read these two letters,

951
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:09,787
and you will begin
to understand.

952
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:13,453
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

953
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:17,123
Sincerely, Roland Michell.

954
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:37,548
And it's well documented
that Ellen Ash set a box
on Ash's coffin...

955
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,780
a kind of sealed container.

956
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:41,981
We'd always imagined
it was just trinkets,

957
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:45,754
but in the light of Michell's
discovery, who knows what
treasures might be buried there.

958
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:48,728
That box is mine, isn't it?
It's my property.

959
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:51,595
 Cropper]
Once you get it from Lord Ash,
it's absolutely yours.

960
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:53,964
Until then,
we keep it a secret.

961
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:56,868
Any discovery amongst
Lord Ash's things,

962
01:22:56,938 --> 01:23:00,738
and, uh...
and I purchase it from you.

963
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:03,744
It's all above board,
no one the wiser.

964
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,007
Cropper, are you
absolutely sure of that?

965
01:23:06,081 --> 01:23:08,572
Listen.
Uh, where is it?

966
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,777
Yeah. "I place this
letter in his hands,

967
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:13,286
"and if ghouls
dig it up again,

968
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:16,722
then perhaps justice
will be done when I am
not here to see it. "

969
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:32,035
Dear Madam: We are older now
and my fires at last are out.

970
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:35,907
I know that you are
more than aware of my name,

971
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:39,674
but I find you must see it
in print one last time.

972
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:44,208
It has been made known to me
that your husband
is near to death,

973
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:49,120
so I have writ down,
for his eyes only, some things.

974
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:54,287
I find I cannot say what things
and have sealed the letter.

975
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:58,765
If you wish to read it,
it is in your hands,

976
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:02,997
though I must hope that he
will see it first and decide.

977
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:08,373
I have done great harm,
though I meant none to you.

978
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:06,191
I'll see they get back,
no questions asked.

979
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:10,564
You're more enterprising
than I gave you credit for.

980
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:12,731
Was there a compliment
in there somewhere?

981
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:16,004
Hmm? Yes, probably.

982
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:22,138
What I can't believe
is Fergus Wolfe
conniving with Cropper.

983
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:24,378
I thought I was
a better judge of men.

984
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:28,013
Well, see, that's
where you went wrong. You
gave him credit for being one.

985
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:33,623
Thank you.

986
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:39,759
Hi.
Hi.

987
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:42,359
Thank you
for coming.
Sure.

988
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:46,635
I believe
that may be her.

989
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:49,939
l, uh... I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

990
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:53,606
No, listen.
I lost it totally.
It wasn't you.

991
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:58,050
So, why don't we all
talk some strategy?

992
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:00,849
Let me introduce
you to, uh...
All right.

993
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:05,086
Professor Blackadder, Paola,
this is Dr. Bailey.

994
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,651
Maud.
Maud.

995
01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:10,095
How do you do?

996
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:15,068
So, do we really think that
Cropper's capable of something
like this, of robbing a grave?

997
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:23,605
It's creepy, the idea
of opening a grave.

998
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,612
Let's just keep going.

999
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,979
Jesus.

1000
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:32,508
"The moping owl does
to the moon complain."
Complain.

1001
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,188
Are you ready?

1002
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:40,455
Yeah.
Hold the light up.

1003
01:26:57,278 --> 01:27:00,179
Fergus! Fergus!
 Is that it?

1004
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:03,649
Yes. It's gotta be.

1005
01:27:03,718 --> 01:27:07,119
I found it, Fergus.
I found it.

1006
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:18,694
Oh, my God.
I found it, Fergus.

1007
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:20,666
Great!

1008
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:25,229
Hey, Cropper.!
Cropper.!

1009
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:34,210
This has nothing
to do with you people.

1010
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:46,387
Wait!
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

1011
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:49,396
No you don't!

1012
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:52,490
Traitor!
Bloody conniver!
Please!

1013
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:57,933
Wait!

1014
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:03,508
What are you doin'?

1015
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:22,024
Oh, shit.

1016
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,295
Are you sure
we should be doing this?

1017
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:30,929
I told Blackadder
we'd just take a look...

1018
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:33,633
before we handed it over
to the museum.

1019
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:36,199
Can you hold that there?

1020
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,888
Maud, look at this.

1021
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:13,943
It's her handwriting.

1022
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:45,677
" My dear, my dear:

1023
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:48,147
"They tell me
you are very ill.

1024
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,083
"Perhaps I am wrong
to disturb you at this time...

1025
01:29:51,152 --> 01:29:54,952
"with unseasonable memories,

1026
01:29:55,022 --> 01:30:00,392
"but I find I have, after all,
a thing which I must tell you.

1027
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:04,758
"You will say it should have
been told 20 years ago,

1028
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:07,801
"but I could, or would, not.

1029
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:11,898
"You have a daughter...

1030
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:15,937
"who is well and married...

1031
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:19,138
"and the mother
of a beautiful boy.

1032
01:30:19,213 --> 01:30:21,977
"I've sent you a picture.

1033
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:30,185
"You will see she resembles
both her parents,

1034
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:33,887
"neither of whom she knows
to be her parent.

1035
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:39,558
"When I said
at that terrible seance that
you had made a murderess of me,

1036
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:44,401
"I was speaking of poor Blanche,
who then torments me daily,

1037
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:49,165
"and I thought,
'Let him think so then...

1038
01:30:49,243 --> 01:30:51,768
"ifhe knows me so little. '

1039
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:56,045
"I had a secret fear, you see.

1040
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,551
"I was afraid that
you would wish to take her...

1041
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:01,053
"you and your wife...
for your own.

1042
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:03,420
But I could not let her go."

1043
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:06,756
Over here.

1044
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:08,887
And so I hid her from you...

1045
01:31:08,963 --> 01:31:11,431
and you from her.

1046
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:16,426
She loves her adoptive
parents most deeply.

1047
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:19,098
Me, she does not love.

1048
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:24,406
So I am punished now,
living at Seal Court with them
and watching her grow.

1049
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,778
I have been angry
for so long...

1050
01:31:27,849 --> 01:31:29,976
with all of us,

1051
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:32,349
and now, near the end,

1052
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:36,083
I think of you again
with clear love.

1053
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:39,126
Did we not...

1054
01:31:39,193 --> 01:31:43,562
Did you not flame
and I catch fire?

1055
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:46,862
Was not the love
that we found...

1056
01:31:46,934 --> 01:31:49,732
worth the tempest
that it brewed?

1057
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:53,604
I feel it was.
I know it was.

1058
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:58,407
"If you are able or willing,
please send me a sign
that you have read this.

1059
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:02,916
"I dare not ask
if you forgive.

1060
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:06,315
Christabel LaMotte."

1061
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:12,459
Ash had never read this.

1062
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:15,428
He never knew
he had a child.

1063
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:19,023
You're descended from both
Christabel and Ash.

1064
01:32:21,335 --> 01:32:25,169
My God.

1065
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:31,007
All these clues,
they're for you.

1066
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:34,972
For us.

1067
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:50,487
You're so beautiful.

1068
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:26,195
There are things that happen,
not spoken or written of.

1069
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:28,963
Apoet walked out
one summer's day...

1070
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:32,437
seeking forgiveness
from a love long lost.

1071
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:36,637
He found
something else instead.

1072
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:40,843
This is how it was.

1073
01:33:49,156 --> 01:33:52,216
Morning.
Good morning.

1074
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:54,227
What's your name?

1075
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:58,698
May Bailey, but I have
another name I don't like.

1076
01:33:58,766 --> 01:34:03,760
Do you? What's that?

1077
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:06,204
Maya Thomason Bailey.

1078
01:34:11,746 --> 01:34:13,737
Well...

1079
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:19,952
Maya was the, uh...

1080
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:22,717
the mother of Hermes,

1081
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:25,054
and I know a waterfall
called Thomason.

1082
01:34:25,126 --> 01:34:28,425
A waterfall? Really?
Yes.

1083
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:33,900
In Yorkshire.
With a lovely cave
hidden behind it.

1084
01:34:36,003 --> 01:34:37,937
Where do you live?

1085
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:39,973
I live in that house
down there.

1086
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:43,738
And my mother lives there
and my father...

1087
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:45,836
and my two brothers.

1088
01:34:45,913 --> 01:34:48,575
Oh, and my Aunt Christabel too.

1089
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,979
Yes, I think
I know your mother.

1090
01:34:56,724 --> 01:34:59,090
You have
the true look of her.

1091
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:04,257
No one else says that.
I think I look like my father.

1092
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,691
You look like
your father too.

1093
01:35:11,405 --> 01:35:13,669
Can you make daisy chains?

1094
01:35:13,741 --> 01:35:16,608
Yes.

1095
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:22,416
Yes, I'll make you a crown.

1096
01:35:24,251 --> 01:35:29,086
But, um... will you
give me a lock of your hair?

1097
01:35:30,891 --> 01:35:33,553
Like fairy story.

1098
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:37,626
Just so.

1099
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:52,645
Now, would you
take this note...

1100
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:55,011
to your aunt.

1101
01:35:56,650 --> 01:35:59,551
Tell her that
you saw a poet...

1102
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:01,986
who was coming
to meet her...

1103
01:36:02,056 --> 01:36:04,286
but met you instead.

1104
01:36:04,358 --> 01:36:06,485
I'll try to remember.

1105
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:10,286
Thank you.
