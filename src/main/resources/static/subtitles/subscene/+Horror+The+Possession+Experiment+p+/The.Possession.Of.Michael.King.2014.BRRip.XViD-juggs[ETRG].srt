1
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,359
Oh, my God.
Enough, camera addict.

2
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,903
Man: Okay, okay.
Just a second, though.

3
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,037
Before I turn it off, what is
your New Year's resolution?

4
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,664
Ha! Really?

5
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,041
Yeah, I want to get it on tape
so that I can hold you to it.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,452
Please, you don't keep those.

7
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,666
That is a fantastic attitude
you have right there.

8
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,171
We're going to this time.

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,674
Yeah? All right, fine.
( clears throat )

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,130
I solemnly swear

11
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,716
on this New Year's resolution

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,473
to go to the gym
and get in shape.

13
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,804
Oh, hell, yeah.

14
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,095
How about you, ladybug?
What's your New Year's resolution?

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,478
What's that?

16
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:57,312
It's like a vow or a promise that
you make to be a better person.

17
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,568
Yeah, or always eat
your spinach.

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,478
- Yuck.
- Okay, I got one for you.

19
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,068
How about you tell your mommy
that you love her at least once a day?

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,450
- Okay.
- You can start right now.

21
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,736
- I love you, Mom.
- How about you, Fishbone?

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,495
What's your resolution?

23
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,702
- Your turn.
- My resolution.

24
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,832
To make a documentary
about this family

25
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,710
so that I can show
the whole world

26
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,415
what a lucky guy I am.

27
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,126
- Woman: You are a lucky guy.
- That's right.

28
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,291
And I thank God every day.

29
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,050
If only you believed in God.

30
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,677
Yeah, that'd probably help
a little bit.

31
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,258
Oh, crap.
You know what?

32
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,219
I didn't put change in that meter.
We're gonna get a ticket.

33
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,600
- Dad, can you help me?
- What's up?

34
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,759
- Here, I got it.
- You sure?

35
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,303
- Yup.
- Thanks, babe.

36
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,687
So, Beverly,
your psychic powers,

37
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,652
when did you first
discover them?

38
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,533
Well, everyone's born
with them, you know.

39
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,117
But most folks don't know
how to develop them.

40
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,656
Man:
And your predictions,

41
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,199
how many of them you think
have come true?

42
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,788
Well, all of them.

43
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,328
( laughs )

44
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,462
Man: Have you ever felt like
you were preying

45
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,340
on someone's superstitions?

46
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,171
Or their emotions?

47
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,336
You know, for example,
like telling a mother

48
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,880
that her missing son
would return alive

49
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,017
or breaking up a family
by advising for divorce.

50
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,552
You know what I mean?
Have you ever felt like

51
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,062
you led somebody down
the wrong path?

52
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,393
No, I don't think so.

53
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,308
You know, it's interesting,

54
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,898
my wife, she's always
wanted to go to Europe.

55
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,029
I finally put
this big trip together,

56
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,862
then at the last second,
she cancels.

57
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,901
She says that she needed
to be here

58
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,742
for this big break
in her acting career.

59
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,204
A break that you told her
was coming.

60
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,368
I did.

61
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,005
And I'm guessing
it hasn't, huh?

62
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,916
No.

63
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,215
It will.

64
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:50,925
Yeah, I don't think so.

65
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,261
And why is that?

66
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,765
She's dead.

67
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,975
Her name was Samantha.
Samantha King.

68
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,143
Yeah. She'd been coming
to you for years.

69
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,363
Oh, Sa_.

70
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,900
Oh, Samantha.
Oh, gosh.

71
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,319
Fluke accident.
Wrong place, wrong time.

72
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,954
But, you know,
the funny thing is

73
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:20,459
is that if we'd been
on that trip,

74
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,837
if she hadn't listened to you
and we'd gone to Europe,

75
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,668
she'd still be alive.

76
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,708
Oh, God.

77
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,467
Oh, you can't think that I had--

78
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,051
You were giving her
spiritual guidance.

79
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,966
Guidance based on visions
you were receiving

80
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,852
from beyond the veil,
from higher powers, right?

81
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,182
And these visions,

82
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,474
they interfered
with her life, Beverly.

83
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,689
And she is dead
as a direct result.

84
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:50,277
I am deeply sorry
for your loss.

85
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,191
Okay, then admit it.
Admit it.

86
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,201
Admit that all this,
this is just a scam.

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,456
That what you claim to do,
your psychic routine--

88
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,491
this is just a show, right?

89
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,660
This is a performance here.

90
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,333
Come on, Beverly.
Come on.

91
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,878
I'm afraid that I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

92
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,632
Please?

93
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,520
Man:
What happens when you die?

94
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,225
I mean, everybody
has a theory, a guess,

95
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,018
a story that they'd like
to believe.

96
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:31,405
But at the end of the day,
we don't know.

97
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,191
Our ancestors worshiped fire

98
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,406
and sacrificed children
to vengeful gods.

99
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,872
We didn't know any better
back then.

100
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,284
What's our excuse now?

101
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,872
It's the 21st century,

102
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,914
yet we're still arguing evolution
versus creationism.

103
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,752
And Why?

104
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,885
Because the truth
scares people.

105
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,296
Nobody wants to die.

106
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,216
Nobody wants to cease to exist.

107
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,602
We want to believe
that if we follow a set of rules,

108
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:06,186
rules that were laid out
by some ancient, made-up god,

109
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,522
we're gonna continue on
in heaven as a spirit.

110
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,561
We're gonna be
reincarnated.

111
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,399
While all that sounds great,

112
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,442
is any of it authentic?

113
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,327
I mean, what's the truth?

114
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,240
See, the truth is
that religion and spiritualism

115
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,706
are the most profitable
businesses in the world.

116
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,415
That throughout history,

117
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,751
there's never been
a single shred of evidence

118
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,008
that any of it is real.

119
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,795
Well, I've decided
to prove it.

120
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,431
I want to test
the most authentic spells,

121
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,138
rituals, and summonings
that I can find.

122
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:46,513
I'm only going after the blackest
of the black magic.

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,479
The stuff that people
are scared of.

124
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,234
So that when they don't work,

125
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,020
people will pay attention.

126
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,733
And maybe, just maybe,

127
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:58,776
the world can take a step forward
collectively into reality.

128
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,823
The cameras will be rolling
on me 24/7

129
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,493
in the hopes that
if I uncover anything,

130
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,252
anything at all,

131
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:13,837
I'll have found the first ever
documented proof.

132
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,427
I'm the testing ground.

133
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,180
Me, Michael King.

134
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,184
So, God or the devil,

135
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,310
if you're out there,

136
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,971
prove it.

137
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,015
Come and get me.

138
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,856
Ladybug, what are you doing?

139
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,650
Why are you up?

140
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,448
I had a scary dream.

141
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,831
Uh-oh. Come here.
What was it about?

142
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,491
A monster.

143
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,206
A monster? Okay.

144
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,623
Well, I wouldn't be surprised
if this particular monster

145
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,009
is a tickle monster.

146
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,340
'(growls )
-( laughing )

147
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,879
Come on.
Come here, come here.

148
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,639
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no.

149
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,845
See, Fishbone's right.
Old Crowley here--

150
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,386
old Crowley here is the best defense
against tickle monsters.

151
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,805
- Get away! Get away!
- What are you doing?

152
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,097
- Hey, sis.
- What's going on?

153
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,188
Oh, we are--
she had a nightmare.

154
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,773
Yeah, take Crowley with you.

155
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,609
Hey, listen.

156
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,865
Why don't I get
in bed with you

157
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,696
and make sure that there are
no more monsters?

158
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,030
- Okay,
- Qkay?

159
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,490
I think that's a great idea.

160
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,371
I'm really good
at fending off monsters.

161
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,531
Aunt Beth is the best.
Hey, young lady.

162
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,200
Where do you think
you're going?

163
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,745
Are you okay?
All right, give me kisses.

164
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,539
- I love you.
- I love you, too, Dad.

165
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,922
Crowley's gonna
take care of you, okay?

166
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,675
- And Fishbone.
- Okay.

167
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,882
What is all this stuff, Michael?

168
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,548
I mean, you wonder why
she's getting all these nightmares?

169
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,136
Seriously?

170
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,927
It's my new project.

171
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:51,563
Oh, right.

172
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,064
What?

173
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,396
I thought that you would
be happy, of all people,

174
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,402
to see me, you know, getting back
to work and moving on.

175
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,316
This isn't really
moving on, Michael.

176
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,325
- Well, it is for me.
- Okay.

177
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,955
I'm gonna go put her to bed.

178
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,617
Okay, so last night
I posted an ad.

179
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,582
Documentary filmmaker seeks
proof of the supernatural.

180
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,089
There must be, I don't know,
over 300 hits on this thing already.

181
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,626
We've got Satanists,
voodoo, necromancy.

182
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,419
I even have a priest on here.

183
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,679
I guess that's Los Angeles
for you, right?

184
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,011
We're gonna have no shortage
of material, that's for sure.

185
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,392
Cameraman: What if one of these
fucking Satanists is a serial killer?

186
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:30,848
- What then?
- Are you serious?

187
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,514
Don't be such a pussy.

188
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,183
So, Father Gibbons,

189
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,727
the Church won't talk
about it publically,

190
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,692
but behind closed doors
you claim

191
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,607
they're performing exorcisms.

192
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,159
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

193
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,288
Okay. And these demons
that they're exercising,

194
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,745
is there any proof
that they're real?

195
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,284
A physical proof?

196
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,954
Like horns and brimstone?

197
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,122
Fire, that kind of thing?

198
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,462
Well, any kind of thing.

199
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,126
I just don't understand
why there's never been

200
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,295
any documented evidence.

201
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,965
What makes you think
there's not?

202
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,055
I haven't seen any.

203
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,719
Well, I mean, of course
you haven't.

204
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,684
You haven't been allowed to.

205
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,560
Okay, listen,
you stated in your e-mail

206
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:24,448
that you had a real experience,
real proof,

207
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,485
but you don't, do you?

208
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,243
<i>Okay</i> '

209
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,497
When I was 10,

210
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,202
my father...

211
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,411
he started
to take advantage of me.

212
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,248
Every night he would
come into my room...

213
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,836
( bells tolling )

214
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,001
...close the door...

215
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,261
My mother,
she must have known.

216
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,676
She prayed all the time.

217
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,970
That was her remedy.

218
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,355
God.

219
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,107
Well, I prayed to God,

220
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,690
but He never stopped
my father, not once.

221
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,776
So I gave up on God.

222
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,446
Started to pray to the devil.
( coughs )

223
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,279
Told him I would do anything

224
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,539
if he'd just make
my father stop.

225
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,877
Well, one night
not long after,

226
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,879
in the middle of one
of his visits,

227
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,042
my father had a heart attack.

228
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,461
Died on the spot.

229
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,593
Wow.

230
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,429
That's awful.

231
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,811
I mean, what happened to you,
it's awful.

232
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,517
But come on.

233
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,652
I mean, how is that anything more
than just a strange coincidence?

234
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,689
Well, not long after, I...

235
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,570
began to hear him

236
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,612
calling out to me,

237
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,156
saying things.

238
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,075
I mean,
awful, awful things.

239
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,244
The devil?

240
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,127
You hear him...

241
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,589
you don't answer.

242
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,305
Because if you do,
he will know you're listening

243
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:16,434
and he will never let you go.

244
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,264
Michael:
Hmm.

245
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,273
Right.

246
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,436
Thank you for your time.
Appreciate it.

247
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,700
I ordered a demon summoning kit
off the Internet.

248
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,285
I lit the traditionally
evil-looking black candles.

249
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,449
I even sprung
for the expensive incense

250
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,165
because their Internet site said

251
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,331
that the demons get insulted
by the cheap stuff.

252
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:50,427
Got one plastic ritual altar.

253
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,303
Nice. Very nice.

254
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,557
And one photocopied booklet.

255
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,685
A lot of money went
into that guy right there, huh?

256
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,063
I also used Ellie's coloring set
to draw my symbols.

257
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,066
Somehow crayons
seemed appropriate.

258
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,943
So basically
what you do is this.

259
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,229
You draw the symbol

260
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,524
for the demon
that you wish to summon.

261
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,192
All right?

262
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,112
You read the spell from this.

263
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,662
Then you light it,

264
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,497
put it in the altar.

265
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,333
Voila.

266
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,543
( French accent )
Instant demon.

267
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,383
Well, surprise, surprise,

268
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,669
the demons were a no-show.

269
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,514
Although...

270
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,643
( groans )
...something's happening.

271
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,977
( Growls )

272
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,141
Okay, there's no demon.

273
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,185
It was worth a shot.

274
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,946
So we got in touch
with a demonologist.

275
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,488
And after negotiating a small--
well, smallish-- fee,

276
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,157
we've convinced him
to summon a demon for us.

277
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,325
-( Knocks )
- Man: Just a sec.

278
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,879
Hi. Michael King.

279
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,960
This is Jordan.

280
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,875
So why do people
always summon demons,

281
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,793
never angels?

282
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,088
People summon angels
all the time.

283
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,847
They just don't want
to interfere.

284
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,680
Now, demons,
on the other hand,

285
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,095
they're just dying
to come here.

286
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,434
It's most tempting to do that
when we're kind of weak,

287
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,939
out of sorts.

288
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,817
Some people meditate for years
to achieve the proper mind set,

289
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:33,321
but we use tricks...

290
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,574
to get us there faster.

291
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,740
- Michael: Uh, grape juice?
- With LSD.

292
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,745
How much LSD?

293
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,872
If you're nervous
about this part,

294
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,126
we should stop right now.

295
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,918
There are two prevalent methods
for summoning demons.

296
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,084
The first is by offering
the demon something up front.

297
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,424
A human life,
continued servitude,

298
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,430
your own soul.

299
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,717
I don't recommend those paths

300
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,136
as once performed
they're very hard to undo.

301
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,396
The second method entails
creating the type

302
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,478
of frenetic atmosphere
demons are drawn to--

303
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,268
chaos, blood,

304
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,109
sex, violence.

305
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,898
I'll need some of your essence.

306
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,817
Uh, saliva?

307
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,906
Semen.

308
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,954
( Chuckles )
You're kidding, right?

309
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,793
And I have to get it
in this cup?

310
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,204
- Bathroom's right over there.
- Okay.

311
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,545
Ever hear of auto writing?
Scrying? Psychography?

312
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,210
It's how we're going
to pick your demon,

313
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,345
- the one we're going to summon.
- Okay.

314
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,632
Close your eyes.

315
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,269
Now, clear your mind.

316
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,480
Open yourself up
to the beyond.

317
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,728
Allow their energy
to flow through you,

318
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,113
to use you.

319
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,284
Let their energy flow.

320
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,787
Breathe.

321
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,041
Breathe.

322
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,669
I'm sorry, I'm not very susceptible
to this kind of stuff.

323
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,081
- I'm sorry.
- You did just fine.

324
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,682
Just a minute here.

325
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,310
So what are we looking for here?
What's this?

326
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,562
To see if the image
that you drew

327
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,223
matches up
with one of the demons.

328
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,484
And you think
that I drew this?

329
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,440
Look.

330
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,071
Daungore.

331
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,278
"Commander of 37 legions.

332
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,819
Seeker of the defenseless,
the weak-spirited,

333
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,737
the nonbeliever.

334
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,281
Known also
as the Great Mocker,

335
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,201
Destroyer of Thought,
Breeder of Ants,

336
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,459
Stealer of Children.

337
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,121
He comes accompanied by
the sound of cacophonous music,

338
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,881
staying with the conjurer

339
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,758
until tormentum
in dum demens."

340
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,511
It's Latin for

341
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,594
"torture until madness."

342
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,437
I feel pretty weird, man.

343
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,733
( laughs )
Okay, look at this, man.

344
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,442
This look safe to you?
This is fucked up.

345
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,073
This is fucked up.
Look at all this plastic.

346
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,407
They're gonna kill me in here.
That's what they're gonna do.

347
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,617
Oh, my God.

348
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,998
I'm losing my mind.
This is a bad idea.

349
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,536
This is bad.
Jordan, check this out.

350
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,045
Dude, maybe we should
get the fuck out of here.

351
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,926
Oh, my God, what the fuck
have we gotten ourselves into?

352
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,348
(speaking Latin )

353
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,151
Oh, shit.

354
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,821
These are real.

355
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,611
( Continues speaking Latin )

356
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,076
( laughs )

357
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,825
Satan. Lucifer.

358
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,793
( Continues speaking Latin,
snaps fingers )

359
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,300
Michael: Okay, so what
are you doing here?

360
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,382
Michael:
I'm freaking out a little bit.

361
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,719
( Both speaking Latin )

362
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,181
Michael:
Oh, God. Oh, God.

363
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,971
Jordan? Jordan, what the fuck
is going on, man?

364
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,139
Jordan: Something's
fucking up the camera.

365
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,526
- I can't see shit.
- ( groaning )

366
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,313
( continues speaking Latin )

367
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,027
Jordan:
Hey, hey, hey!

368
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,784
Michael, are you okay?
Are you all right?

369
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,820
Oh, shit.

370
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,740
( Continues speaking Latin )

371
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,331
Jordan:
She's got a knife.

372
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,130
Get that fucking knife
off of him!

373
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,011
- Get it off of him!
- ( shouting )

374
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,467
Jesus Christ!

375
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,509
( Grunting, screaming )

376
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:44,045
(sighs )

377
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,262
Well...

378
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:53,300
that was, like, some kind of
satanic porn shoot.

379
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,728
The smell in there, right?

380
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,231
And you paid him.
( laughs )

381
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,892
Come on, man, shh.
Seriously, turn that off.

382
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,989
So you want me
to order you some chili?

383
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,900
Runny eggs?

384
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,035
Or how about a cup
of bloody jizz?

385
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,743
Don't. Don't. Don't.
I'm never eating again.

386
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,492
At least enjoy the acid.
Ready?

387
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,081
You're running through a forest.
You're running through a forest.

388
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,587
Don't, dude. Don't.
Seriously, come on.

389
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,623
I hate you.
Turn it off.

390
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,235
( Screams )

391
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:57,906
So necromancy is considered
the blackest of the black arts.

392
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,915
Why is that?

393
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,701
Well...

394
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:07,461
I think it gets most of its bad rap

395
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,718
because of the method employed
in performing it.

396
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,755
You mean dealing with corpses,
graves, funeral rites.

397
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,015
Right, right.
That kind of creeps people out.

398
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,470
Sure.

399
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,806
But as a mortician,

400
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,812
it's all part of my day job.

401
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,729
And as far as the magic goes...

402
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,986
it's really no different

403
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,694
than what any of these
mediums are doing

404
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,326
except we just employ
a slightly different method

405
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,488
in raising the dead.

406
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,291
Teeth taken from
our little friend over there.

407
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,833
Mortician:
A freshly deceased body

408
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:54,049
works best because the soul
may still be lingering.

409
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,804
Then we can kind of confuse it.

410
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,967
You know, make it think
that it's still alive

411
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:02,012
and that all it needs to do is just
get back inside of its living body.

412
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,397
<i>Okay</i> '

413
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,354
This is a mild anesthetic

414
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,520
similar to Novocain.

415
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,531
- Okay. Doing all right?
- Yeah.

416
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,947
Okay, it'll start to numb
in just a couple minutes.

417
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,411
The more that we can
make you appear

418
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,169
like that body the soul
once inhabited,

419
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:29,797
the better our chances.

420
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,500
You feel that?

421
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,384
- No.
- Okay.

422
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,716
Mortician:
The astral corpse,

423
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,177
it wants to keep living.

424
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,718
Living is what it knows.

425
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,058
You know? And unless
it's already grown accustomed

426
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,441
to the afterlife,
it's what's normal.

427
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,320
And it's desperate
to cling on to that.

428
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,950
The Sonoran Desert toad

429
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,861
contains dimethyltryptamine,

430
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,497
or DMT,

431
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,377
the most powerful psychedelic
on the planet.

432
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,090
The human body
produces DMT.

433
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,216
It's released when we die.

434
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,174
It helps us pass
to the other side.

435
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,589
But taking it
while we're still living

436
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,259
simulates a near-death
experience.

437
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,269
I'm going to need
to let it dry.

438
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,520
Prepare it.

439
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,059
It's gonna take some time.

440
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,273
We need to wait
until it's dark anyhow.

441
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,783
This Novocain is wearing off
on my stomach,

442
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,445
so this is starting to hurt
like a bitch, man.

443
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,623
Oh, there he is.

444
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,410
Hey, sorry we're late.
I got all turned around in here.

445
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,706
Jesus Christ.
Did you kill these--

446
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,294
did you kill these things?

447
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,458
The toads, their pain,

448
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,255
agony, it creates
this sort of energy

449
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,265
that draws in the spirits.

450
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,768
Assume the position.

451
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,394
On your back.

452
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,521
Right.

453
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,024
The smell of burning DMT

454
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,401
can be intensely nauseating.

455
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,235
Like burning plastic.

456
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,402
Now, as it takes effect,

457
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,321
the world will shatter

458
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,331
and your body
will quickly follow.

459
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,834
You may feel like
you're starting to die,

460
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,496
like you don't know
how to breathe at all.

461
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,380
But it's okay.

462
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,507
You just need to let go

463
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,670
- and go with it.
- ( groaning )

464
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,175
To Almighty God

465
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,345
we commend
our brother Michael...

466
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,143
and commit his body
to the ground.

467
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,526
<i>Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.</i>

468
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,903
Roland Sykes.

469
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,235
Roland Sykes,

470
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:04,072
reclaim your physical body.

471
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,328
- Take this body. Shit!
- ( sirens wail )

472
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,455
- Cop: You, hey!
- Mortician: Get the fuck out of here.

473
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,537
- Cop: Get on your knees!
- Jordan: Michael.

474
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,701
- Where are you?
- Cop #2: They're running.

475
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,253
Oh, fuck me.

476
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,713
( Panting )

477
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,799
Cop: He's making
a break for it. Hey!

478
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,598
- There he goes!
- Jordan: Michael.

479
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,226
( Door squeaks )

480
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,612
Jordan:
Hey, you in here?

481
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,652
Michael, you in here?

482
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:46,110
Michael.

483
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,507
- Strange voice: Crawl.
- ( Jordan gasps )

484
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,670
- Crawl!
- ( door slams )

485
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,224
( Jordan grunting )

486
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:11,226
Fuck!

487
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,438
- Crawl.
- Jordan: What is that?

488
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,694
What the fuck
is going on here?

489
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,605
Crawl.

490
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,240
Shit. Michael.

491
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:26,821
Michael.

492
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,032
Come on, get down, man.

493
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,447
Get down from there.
Let's get out of here.

494
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,786
Come on.
Are you okay?

495
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,250
Strange voice:
I don't want to be dead.

496
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,836
- ( Growls)
- Get off, Mike!

497
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,843
-( Panting )
- Oh, Jesus.

498
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,803
Jordan? Jordan?

499
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,309
Jordan: You're tripping out, man.
It's just the drugs.

500
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,890
Dude, just chill.

501
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,978
Oh, no. No, no.

502
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,689
Fuck. She's gone.

503
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,353
Jordan:
Who's gone?

504
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,819
Sam.

505
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,234
I was with her, man.

506
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,323
I was with Sam.

507
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,284
But she's fucking gone.

508
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,574
Jordan: Come on, let's just get
the fuck out of here.

509
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,500
- Michael: Steal it!
- How did we get so lucky?

510
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,832
- Ellie: Come on!
- Michael: I know, she's amazing.

511
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,838
Fishbone, eh.

512
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,544
He doesn't come
when he's called so much.

513
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,835
- Michael: Yeah.
- Ew, this is gross now, too.

514
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,095
- Here you go. ( gasps )
- No, no, don't give it to me.

515
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,893
( Clears throat )

516
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,396
My wife Samantha was...

517
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,143
I mean,
I fucking touched her.

518
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,313
You know,
and I felt her with--

519
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,528
( clears throat )

520
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,192
And she was trying
to tell me something.

521
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,703
It was--

522
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,613
there was all this interference.

523
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,657
It was like static.

524
00:26:56,824 --> 00:27:00,419
And I couldn't make out
what she was saying.

525
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,413
But she was...

526
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,636
Took a shower.
Got rid of these fucking teeth.

527
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:13,970
Look at this.

528
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,806
I feel like I'm still
coming down from the drugs

529
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,346
or something.

530
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,731
And that static sound,

531
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,563
it's, like, still there.

532
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,443
( Sniffles )

533
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,275
I've got to get some sleep.

534
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,358
I can't sleep.
( groans )

535
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:35,246
Man, it's like 4:30, 5:00.
Something like that.

536
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,248
Sun's gonna be
coming up soon.

537
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,205
I'm just past the point.

538
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,504
And that noise, it's, like,

539
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:47,416
now that I've noticed it, I'm--

540
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,927
I'm fixated on it.

541
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,302
Hey there.

542
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,429
We're at this reading
by Erica Bell.

543
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,842
She's a relatively
well-known medium.

544
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,807
And then afterwards
we get to interview her.

545
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,767
So come on,
let's <i>check</i> it out.

546
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,181
( <i>Crowd gasps</i> )

547
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,520
Okay, was there something
with her throat?

548
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,185
Her breathing?

549
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,103
She had esophageal cancer.

550
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,272
She wants you to know
she's okay.

551
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,157
- ( Applause )
- She's watching over you.

552
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:15,445
And you're--
no, hang on.

553
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,034
No, wait a minute.
Someone else is butting in here.

554
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,665
Lots of spirits
want to talk today.

555
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,541
This is good. Okay.

556
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,122
All right, somewhere over here.

557
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,414
Yes.
Yes, this is a very strong signal.

558
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,957
Female, I think.

559
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,125
She really,
really wants to talk.

560
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,090
Right, she passed recently.

561
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,846
Happened kind of quickly,
an accident maybe.

562
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,303
Okay, she has a message.

563
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,060
No, that can't be right.
She wants to--

564
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,392
Michael, listen to me.

565
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,306
You need to--

566
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:45,725
( screams )

567
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,859
- Whoa, whoa.
- ( gasping )

568
00:28:48,018 --> 00:28:50,487
Easy, easy, easy.
Jesus Christ.

569
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,695
What happened?
We're not really sure.

570
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,652
Erica was about
to tell us something

571
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,241
and then she went into
that seizure.

572
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,702
I mean, was she actually
channeling Sam?

573
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,873
Or was that just all
part of her show?

574
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,666
And then the seizure

575
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,176
was just like a strange
coincidence or something.

576
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,587
I don't know.

577
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,051
Ellie: Dad, Fishy peed
on the floor again.

578
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,511
Michael:
Huh? Okay, baby.

579
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,517
Daddy will take care of it
after dinner, all right?

580
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:25,598
- Thanks. Oh, fuck!
- Jeez.

581
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,732
Why the fuck would you
hand me something like that?

582
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,689
It's scalding hot.

583
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,195
God damn it.

584
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,197
Michael, that's a salad.

585
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,000
Um, I'm sorry.
I'm just--

586
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,910
Daddy's a little tense.
I'm sorry about that.

587
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:50,001
You okay?
I scared you.

588
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,040
( Clears throat )

589
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,630
You Okay?

590
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,795
Yeah.

591
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:59,886
Have some salad, Ellie.

592
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,984
(sighs )

593
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,570
(sighs )

594
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,243
I thought if I went out today

595
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,454
that I could shake
this noise in my head,

596
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,710
that it would just go away.

597
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,997
( Groans )

598
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,382
( <i>Cracks</i> )

599
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,886
But now that I'm home
and it's quiet, it's like...

00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,218
( <i>Cracks</i> )

601
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,592
I wish I could
describe for you

602
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,386
what this is.

603
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,431
It's this constant barrage,

604
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,645
this cacophony of sound.

605
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,275
It's like--

606
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,938
it's like--

-( Roaring )
<i>'</i> ( digital squealing )

610
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,881
Okay, so what's
the deal again?

611
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:25,301
Like I said,
it came out of my mouth.

612
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,970
Uh-huh. Yeah, no.

613
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,638
Why not?

614
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,729
There's multiple layers
of overtone singing.

615
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,438
Overtone?
What does that mean?

616
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,978
It's when a singer
manipulates their voice

617
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,896
to have multiple pitches
at the same time.

618
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,158
Okay, good.
So then maybe I did it accidentally.

619
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:45,696
Well, even if I bought that,
which I don't, there's more.

620

Here. Let's see.

621
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,325
- This is a B2.
-( note plays )

622
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,371
- Okay.
- And this is a C# 7.

623
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,414
( Note plays )

624
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,049
That's a Guinness Book
vocal range right there.

625
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,085

Some of it's not even audible.

631

Just barely registering
on my stuff.

632
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,233
Let me ask you this.
Is it possible

633
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,569
that my vocal cords
could have made this?

634
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,699
Not a chance.

635
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,452
If you're not fucking with me,

636
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,738
then there's something wrong
with the audio in your camera.

637
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,281
A defect or something.

638
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,917
It's not the camera.

639
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,952

Chronic ringing of the ears.

657
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,776
It's a very common condition.
It's called tinnitus.

658
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,866
- You should see an internist.
- I did. I did.

659
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,871
He gave me
a clean bill of health.

660
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,532
Said that it must be
psychosomatic,

661
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,543
that I should see a psychiatrist,
which is why I'm here.

662
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,040
I understand, Michael,
that your wife died recently.

Six months ago, yeah.

664

Ellie, uh-huh.

666
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,383
You might be going through
some extreme stress

feelings, emotions,

668

things that consciously you might
not think you can handle.

669
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,480
And so then they become
side effects.

00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,192
All right, so you think you can,
I don't know,

671

Bullshit.

00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,798
do you miss your mommy?

888
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,925
Yeah.

889
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,049
You can be with her,
you know.

890
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:13,265
Beth:
Hey, Ellie, come on.

891
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,604
Let's go get a bath.

892
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,852
So long.

893
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,605
Ladybug-

894
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,948
Come on, let's go.

895
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,796
Michael:
I don't feel like myself at all

896
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,257
anymore.

897
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,672
I'm starting to have
these crazy thoughts.

898
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,431
( laughs )

899
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,059
I feel compelled.

900
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:57,097
Like I have to.
Like I have to fucking do it.

901
00:50:57,263 --> 00:51:00,233
( laughing )

902
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,855
( static hissing )

903
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,742
( growling )

904
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,458
Eyes are throbbing like mad.

905
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,999
Can you see this?

906
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:09,385
Aw, it hurts like hell.

907
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,466
I'm fucking slipping.

908
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,757
What?
Oh, my God.

909
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,674
No, God damn it, no!

910
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,763
What the fuck?

911
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,608
What the fuck is that?

912
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,769
Oh, my God.

913
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:30,444
( Beth screaming )

914
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:33,234
What happened?
Beth? Ellie?

915
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,282
Fuck!

916
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,743
( Sobbing )

917
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,500
( panting )

918
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,508
Ellie! Ellie!

919
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,769
- Doll: Crowley loves you.
- Ellie.

920
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,975
- ( Doll cackles )
- Ellie.

921
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,639
Is that Fishy?

922
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:06,309
- No, baby.
- Are you okay?

923
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,944
- Ellie, sweetheart.
- No, no.

924
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:11,735
Beth, you don't think--

925
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,365
Beth, I didn't.

926
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,822
- Ellie: I don't want to leave Fishy!
- Ellie.

927
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,487
- Let me go!
- Ellie.

928
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:20,372
Oh, God.

929
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,367
Oh.

930
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,832
( Sobbing )
What have I done?

931
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,377
Fish.

932
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,712
You--

933
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,721
you don't have
power over me.

934
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,632
You don't.

935
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,893
You think you do,
but you don't.

936
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,849
This isn't what I wanted.

937
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,228
This isn't what
I wanted at all.

938
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,267
I'm sorry, Sam.

939
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,647
You can't make me
do anything.

940
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,986
Shh.
Couldn't make me lower.

941
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:58,119
You are just in my fucking head.
Get out of my head!

942
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,053
( Panting )

943
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,885
( screams )

944
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:32,569
I thought I almost
killed Ellie.

945
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,899
Fishbone was Sam's dog.

946
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,495
- Fuck.
- ( strange voices whispering )

947
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,245
Beth and Ellie,

948
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,081
they're staying with one
of Beth's friends for a few days.

949
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,746
It's getting too hard
to fucking concentrate.

950
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,005
- ( Growling )
- ( strange voices whispering )

951
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,584
Quiet!

952
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,846
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

953
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,257
Stop saying that,
God damn it!

954
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,517
Shit! Stop!

955
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,928
"I command you,
unclean spirit.

956
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,064
You shall not be emboldened
to harm this creature of God.

957
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:11,521
You shall not harm him
or those he touches.

958
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,981
I command you,
release this body.

959
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,865
Release this body--"
( screams )

960
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:21,239
"Turn back this evil
upon my soul.

961
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:24,245
I beseech you, Lord.
I beseech you."

962
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,500
Strange voice:
Burn! Burn!

963
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,128
- Burn!
- Fuck! God damn it!

964
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:34,335
You can't have this body.

965
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,546
No! No, God damn it!

966
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,760
(groaning )

967
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,801
Fuck! Fuck!

968
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,311
( Screams )

969
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:52,479
God, please!

970
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:56,020
- ( Screaming )
- ( voice gibbering )

971
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,325
- ( glass shatters )
- ( cacophony stops )

972
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,127
I've tried everything.

973
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,669
Protective spells,
banishments,

974
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:05,214
charms,
every incantation I can find.

975
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,516
Nothing's worked.

976
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:12,851
The more I try and fight it,
the more it takes over.

977
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,562
Forcing me to do things.

978
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,238
Laughing at me.

979
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,649
It's fucking laughing at me.

980
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,242
You'd think
this really hurts, right?

981
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,045
Funny thing is

982
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,172
I can hardly feel it.

983
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:45,254
It's getting harder and harder
to feel anything.

984
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,591
It's like...

985
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,724
none of this is real anymore.

986
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,401
( laughs )

987
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,944
It's not real.
( laughing )

988
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,961
Nothing is real.

989
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,927
See this?

990
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,184
Look at that.

991
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,279
No matter
how many times I kill it--

992
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,399
ah, there.

993
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,656
Oh, yeah.
See this? See?

994
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:56,917
Another one. Okay.

995
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:02,547
I've been doing this
all day long.

996
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,674
Look at that bastard.

997
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,177
You son of a bitch.

998
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,087
Fuck. Another one.

999
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,015
God damn it.

1000
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:20,357
If I let it crawl on my body,
there's only one.

1001
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:24,152
The second I kill it,

1002
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:26,530
another one shows up.

1003
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:33,071
- ( Voice whispers ) The girl.
- ( winces )

1004
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,409
I know, okay?
I know what you want!

1005
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,451
(voice whispering )
We want the girl.

1006
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:42,121
- You can't have her.
- We can make you do it.

1007
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,415
- You can't have her.
- Someone else.

1008
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,380
- Someone else.
- Okay. Okay.

1009
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:51,046
I'll do it. I'll do it.

1010
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,886
But you can't have Ellie.

1011
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,800
You hear me?

1012
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,344
You can't have Ellie.

1013
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,114
( Strange voices whispering )

1014
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,276
( dog barking )

1015
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,164
( strange voices whispering )

1016
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,739
( knife scraping )

1017
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,944
(voice whispering )
Kill her. Now. Kill her.

1018
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,284
Kill her. Kill her.

1019
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,120
- ( Groans )
- Kill her!

1020
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,838
We want you to kill her.

1021
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:10,092
( Growling )

1022
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:22,813
Kill.

1023
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:24,814
Kill him.

1024
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:33,107
( Door closes )

1025
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,655
(sighs )

1026
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:46,832
Sorry, Ellie.

1027
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:49,498
I just-- I couldn't do it.

1028
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,166
I just...

1029
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,546
I have to fucking
get some sleep.

1030
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,714
Goddamn rest.

1031
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,009
You're not going anywhere!

1032
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:02,849
Okay, we're not
going anywhere.

1033
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,888
We're fuckin' sleeping.

1034
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,558
No, we're not going out.

1035
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,694
( Strange voices whispering )

1036
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:16,780
- ( screams )
- Yes, you will!

1037
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,158
( Screams )

1038
01:02:24,324 --> 01:02:26,918
(groaning )

1039
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,316
( growls )

1040
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,165
What the fuck?

1041
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:17,924
Oh, no.

1042
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,922
( Distant static hissing )

1043
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:36,275
( static hissing )

1044
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:54,923
Jordan:
Michael.

1045
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,755
- Jordan, I'm in here.
- Michael?

1046
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,554
- Michael.
- Yeah.

1047
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:04,341
Jesus Christ, what the fuck
is going on in here?

1048
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,976
Your place is a dis-- Jesus.

1049
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:15,485
Key is over there.
Do you mind getting it for me?

1050
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:18,317
Oh, fuck.

1051
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,905
We need to get you
some serious help, all right?

1052
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:25,446
You gonna check
into a facility?

1053
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,410
I'm serious, man.
If I unlock you,

1054
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,496
we are going there right now.

1055
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,038
Answer the fucking--
what am I doing?

1056
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:37,173
( Phone ringing )

1057
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,890
Jordan?

1058
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,187
( Phone continues ringing )

1059
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:06,111
(stops ringing )

1060
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,545
Oh! Oh, fuck!

1061
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,252
There was a being

1062
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,009
inside a light and...

1063
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:25,464
I don't know
if it was an angel or...

1064
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,133
( chuckles )
God.

1065
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:34,898
It asked me if I was
prepared to move on.

1066
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:41,526
All I needed to do
was let go.

1067
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,411
And I wanted to.

1068
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,625

1069
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:56,036

and tell you

1070

was gonna be okay,

1071

The interference,

the real singing.

1144
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:55,176
Because once you hear it,

1145
