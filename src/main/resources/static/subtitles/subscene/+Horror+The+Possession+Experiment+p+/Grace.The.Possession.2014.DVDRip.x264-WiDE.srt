1
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:43,188
Mary, I need you to push.

2
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,199
Come on, Mary. Don't do this
to yourself. Just push. Come on.

3
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:54,462
I won't have this child!

4
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:04,708
- Please, God. Please help her.
- I have no god.

5
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:38,045
She's arresting!

6
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:39,746
We need to get the baby out now.

7
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:43,238
- Prep for emergency C-section. Scalpel.
- Ma'am, step back.

8
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:48,188
- Prepare for incision.
- Please, you have to save her.

9
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,691
- How we doing on the mother?
- No improvement.

10
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:53,360
Please, God. Please help her.

11
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,896
She is only 18.

12
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:58,091
Okay, got the head.

13
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,692
Stand by on paddles.

14
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:07,141
I absolve you from your sins.

15
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:08,972
Clear.

16
00:02:11,044 --> 00:02:13,469
- In the name of the Father...
- Again.

17
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:17,518
...and of the Son...

18
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:19,280
Clear.

19
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,411
...and of the Holy Spirit.

20
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:27,995
By the grace of God.

21
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:30,224
Amen.

22
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:56,378
Come on.

23
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:58,907
Come on.

24
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:08,323
Come on, let's go!

25
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,290
I'm late.

26
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:35,716
My God. I can't believe he went.

27
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:38,118
What's in style?

28
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:40,051
Hey.

29
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:43,056
- Sorry.
- I'm gonna miss you, honey.

30
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:46,320
I love you, Mom.
I'm a phone call away.

31
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:56,530
Later, guys.

32
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,740
Seriously, I'm going shopping.

33
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,400
Okay, Mom.

34
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:10,784
Excuse me.

35
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:13,684
- Hey, wait up.
- Lots of time.

36
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:57,953
Bless you.

37
00:06:58,098 --> 00:06:59,332
Thanks.

38
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:02,702
- What's up? Jessica.
- Grace.

39
00:07:02,802 --> 00:07:05,405
- Nice to meet you, roomie.
- You too.

40
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:07,941
Fuck me.

41
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:11,378
What's in the bottle?

42
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:16,249
A little water, a little vodka.
Mostly vodka.

43
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:17,984
Want a swig?

44
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:21,312
No, thanks.

45
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:23,947
Suit yourself.

46
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,391
Yes.

47
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:41,633
Hello?

48
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:47,681
Grandma?

49
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,274
Did you find your Bible?

50
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:53,577
I had to pack it for you.

51
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,823
I was going to, I just...

52
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:59,960
I... forgot.

53
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,830
Grace, you need to
keep God in your life.

54
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,435
- That place is full of sin and sex.
- It's not like that.

55
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:12,005
- If you came here, you would see.
- I know exactly what it's like.

56
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:15,208
Are you trying to hurt me?
Is that why you left?

57
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:18,311
No, it's just I had to
move out eventually.

58
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,515
That's exactly how it
started with your mother.

59
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:26,509
You are becoming more like her
every single day, do you know that?

60
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,915
I've made up my mind.

61
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,514
Sorry.

62
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,829
- What was that?
- It's just my roommate. I should go.

63
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,992
No. We pray first.

64
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:44,163
Grace?

65
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:48,008
- I pray, Lord,
- Lord, that you enlighten my mind,

66
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:51,811
purify my heart and sanctify my soul.

67
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:54,176
- Amen.
- Amen.

68
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,608
Don't forget to pray.

69
00:09:02,122 --> 00:09:05,292
So, all that praying and shit,

70
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:08,094
what are you, like, super religious?

71
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:10,687
I suppose so.

72
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:14,895
Well, to each their own.

73
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:19,198
Where you going?

74
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,833
Wherever this takes me.

75
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:32,252
Hey, wait.

76
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:35,455
So was that your mom
on the phone earlier?

77
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:38,024
No, I live with my grandma.

78
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:40,527
Why was she being such a tight-ass?

79
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:42,362
I don't know.

80
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:43,730
What? Mark.

81
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,265
- Jessica.
- What's up, dude?

82
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:47,434
- My God. How you doing?
- Long time.

83
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:50,036
- I didn't know you go to MSU.
- Yeah, of course.

84
00:09:50,136 --> 00:09:52,539
- This is my roommate, Michael.
- Hey, Jessica.

85
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,341
This is my new roommate, Grace.

86
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:55,542
Hey. Grace?

87
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:57,711
- What's up, Grace?
- Hi, Grace. Michael.

88
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:59,746
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too.

89
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:03,516
- Isn't this campus amazing?
- Yeah.

90
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:05,986
So, what are you and
your friend up to later?

91
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:07,687
- I don't know.
- Sigma Phi Delta,

92
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:11,791
they're having this angels and
demons party. It's gonna be sweet.

93
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:14,725
Personally, I think you'd
make a pretty sexy demon.

94
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:21,468
- I've been wondering if you could purr...
- Shut up. Get out.

95
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:24,137
- Yeah. Where is it?
- You gotta come with us.

96
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:26,366
- Yo, check this out.
- Get in here.

97
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,477
Come on, let's do it.
All you guys, all right.

98
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:31,778
- You gonna go?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:35,148
- Nice to meet you, get in here.
- We need one more person.

100
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,081
One more.

101
00:10:38,518 --> 00:10:41,021
- You. Come on in here.
- Me?

102
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:42,922
- Come on, come on.
- No, it's okay.

103
00:10:43,022 --> 00:10:44,824
- You're gonna do awesome.
- What?

104
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:47,794
- You're gonna do awesome. Here you go.
- Okay.

105
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,763
- I'm on the wrong side.
- You ready?

106
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:51,831
- I'm ready. You ready?
- I don't know.

107
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:55,268
- What do I do?
- Just tug as hard as you possibly can.

108
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:57,565
- Tug. Ready?
- Okay. No!

109
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:00,140
Come on, guys!

110
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,608
Come on, come on, come on.

111
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:02,809
Come on!

112
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:05,245
Come on. You can do better than that.

113
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,542
Come on.

114
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,708
Come on, guys. This is not...
Oof! Whoa!

115
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:15,351
That did not work.

116
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:17,824
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

117
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:20,393
- I'm Brad, by the way.
- Hi, I'm Grace.

118
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:21,728
Nice to meet you.

119
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:24,164
Beer pong? Did I hear
beer pong? Wanna play?

120
00:11:24,264 --> 00:11:25,999
- Beer pong?
- New girl, come on.

121
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,500
No. I'm fine.

122
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,735
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

123
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:31,438
It's not really her thing.
I'll be your teammate.

124
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:35,375
Okay. All right. All right, well,
really nice to meet you, Grace.

125
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,876
Hope to see you around.

126
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:39,713
- Are you sure you don't wanna come?
- No, it's fine.

127
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:42,048
Okay, all right.

128
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:44,017
- Okay.
- Bye.

129
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:47,087
- Here's your towel, bro.
- Who wants vodka?

130
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:49,111
Child.

131
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:03,186
Come on, man.

132
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:26,386
Bless me with your infinite graces
so that I may remain pure

133
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:28,988
and protect my soul
against daily struggles.

134
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:36,018
Defend me from the forces of evil,
and I am yours, forever and ever.

135
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,832
Amen.

136
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:10,751
What?

137
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:25,278
Grace. Grace.
Holy shit, wake up, dude.

138
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,480
What is wrong with you?

139
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,005
Sorry.

140
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,579
Jesus. Freaked me out.

141
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:37,315
What were you dreaming about?

142
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:42,789
Goddamn. Vodka.

143
00:14:42,996 --> 00:14:44,831
What time is it?

144
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:48,425
Ten-thirty.

145
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:51,229
No, no, no.

146
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:55,167
- Why didn't my alarm go off?
- I don't know.

147
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:58,973
- How'd you get that?
- What?

148
00:15:00,713 --> 00:15:04,550
I... I don't know.

149
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,746
I... I'm late for class. I gotta go.

150
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,068
Moods.

151
00:15:26,773 --> 00:15:27,907
Who is that?

152
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:32,445
Well, so nice of you to fit
us into your busy schedule.

153
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:34,814
- I'm sorry.
- Have a seat.

154
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:37,946
- Who is that?
- That's Grace.

155
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:48,587
Take your time.

156
00:15:56,102 --> 00:16:00,707
Now, we were talking about love.

157
00:16:00,807 --> 00:16:02,575
- Hi.
- Hi.

158
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:06,374
It seems to me that an awful
lot of you really believe in it.

159
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,784
Well, I hate to break it to you,
especially the ladies,

160
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:16,914
but love is merely a
byproduct of evolution.

161
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:21,928
And over the course of this term,
we'll be learning about how

162
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:26,432
all of our behaviors when it comes
to sex, whether it be cheating

163
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:32,495
or jealousy, monogamy, are all
motivated by simple biology.

164
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:39,374
And we'll get into that over
the course of this term.

165
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:42,315
Go long! Go long!

166
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:43,941
Yeah.

167
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,378
Yes.

168
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:50,223
My God. You did it. That is awesome.

169
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:51,691
- Good job.
- Thanks.

170
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,127
We just won the game.
Nice shot. Dickhead.

171
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:57,323
- Is that what you wanna play?
- What? What? No.

172
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:02,168
My God. You are so disgusting.

173
00:17:02,268 --> 00:17:05,972
How is that disgusting? Next you'll
tell me you don't watch porn.

174
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:09,175
Yeah, of course I watch porn,
and, yeah, I masturbate,

175
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:12,345
but you hitting yourself in
the face with your own spunk,

176
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:13,913
I don't need to hear that.

177
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:16,816
It's not disgusting.
You're disgusting.

178
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,551
I'm wounded.

179
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:20,119
Thank you.

180
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:22,588
If I don't masturbate
once a week, I get anxious.

181
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:25,558
- Once a week? Try twice a day.
- I'm okay. Here.

182
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,193
That does not surprise me.

183
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:30,287
- What about you, Grace?
- What?

184
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:33,763
How often do you... You know?

185
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,032
It's gonna come out eventually.

186
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:46,446
I don't really do that.

187
00:17:46,546 --> 00:17:49,949
Maybe she just doesn't wanna
talk about it, guys. Drop it.

188
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:53,316
Like, ever?

189
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:56,222
You...

190
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:59,325
Yo, are you a virgin?

191
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:01,360
Dude, come on. Don't say that shit.

192
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,765
No, I'm just... I'm just asking.
It's a legitimate question.

193
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:08,501
- Come on, you're just being rude.
- Yeah, come on.

194
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:11,270
- No, Grace.
- Don't listen to him. He's an idiot.

195
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,069
No, it's fine. I just have to
go to class. I'll see you guys.

196
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:19,909
Grace. I'm sorry.

197
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,747
Yeah.

198
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,042
Stop it.

199
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:48,100
Grace. You made it.

200
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,169
- Brad.
- Nice to see you. How are you?

201
00:19:50,269 --> 00:19:53,103
- Hey.
- So glad you made it.

202
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:56,375
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

203
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:58,778
- No, I'm fine.
- You look great, by the way.

204
00:19:58,878 --> 00:20:01,547
And I've had a lot of these.
You need to catch up.

205
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:04,750
So I'm taking this. Can I take this?
Thank you so much.

206
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,717
Okay. Ahem.

207
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:10,353
- There you go.
- Thanks.

208
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:15,419
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

209
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:21,167
You okay?

210
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:23,803
Yeah, it just...
It kind of tastes like hay.

211
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:28,341
What? I thought all you small-town kids
drink your faces off, got shitfaced, no?

212
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:30,076
- Hey, Brad.
- Yeah, what's up?

213
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:33,272
I am freezing my balls off out here.

214
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:36,882
Yeah, it's pretty cold.
Do you want to head inside?

215
00:20:36,982 --> 00:20:39,952
- Sure.
- Yeah? Follow me, let's go inside.

216
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:41,721
- Okay.
- Nice outfit.

217
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,688
Thanks.

218
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:48,123
I hope it's okay I borrowed
some of your stuff.

219
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:51,197
Yeah, sure. Anytime.

220
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:53,130
Okay.

221
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:03,309
Okay, so it's pretty insane in there,
so just follow me and it'll all be good.

222
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:04,510
- Okay.
- Ready?

223
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,410
- Yeah.
- Let's do it. Whoo!

224
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,675
Yeah!

225
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:18,948
Excuse me.

226
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:21,382
Sorry.

227
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:26,724
Nice.

228
00:21:28,033 --> 00:21:30,736
Excuse me, coming through.
Coming through.

229
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,726
Excuse me.

230
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,441
- You into this kind of music?
- Yeah.

231
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:38,744
Yeah? Here, I don't
want you getting lost.

232
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:41,906
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Coming through.

233
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:44,950
Got a train going on, or something.

234
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,686
Nice.

235
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,788
I don't know. Whatever.

236
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:52,058
- Excuse me, bro. Cheers. Cheers.
- Cheers.

237
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:55,220
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

238
00:21:59,098 --> 00:22:01,801
- Watch your head here too.
- Okay.

239
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:05,871
Joel, where are you?
Where are you? There you are.

240
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:07,707
Come get liquor in your system.

241
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:09,265
Okay.

242
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:12,301
That guy just threw up.

243
00:22:13,546 --> 00:22:15,538
Okay.

244
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:17,850
Me, you.

245
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,685
The little lady.

246
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:23,356
Whoa, whoa. If you didn't like beer,
you're not gonna like that. Powerful shit.

247
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:26,158
- It's like gasoline.
- No, I can try it. Seriously.

248
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:27,560
Hey, thattagirl.

249
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,662
- Okay. All right.
- Bottoms up.

250
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:31,720
Cheers, cheers.

251
00:22:32,932 --> 00:22:34,900
- I spilled it on my chest.
- You okay?

252
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,002
- You all right?
- Yeah.

253
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:39,038
All right! We're good.

254
00:22:39,138 --> 00:22:40,940
More. More.

255
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,808
Round two, bitches!

256
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:44,741
Round two.

257
00:22:45,311 --> 00:22:47,941
My aim is so pro.

258
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:50,182
Round two. Ding, ding.

259
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:51,851
- Round two.
- Okay.

260
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:54,615
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

261
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:59,590
I love the poison.

262
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,551
Don't worry, we're gonna turn
you into one of us in no time.

263
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,033
One of us, one of us, one of us.

264
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:11,570
Yes! I just have to go to the
bathroom, but can you wait here?

265
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,971
- Sure. Yes, yes, yes, we can.
- No. No...

266
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:17,941
- Yes.
- Thanks.

267
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,348
- Hey, Grace.
- Hi.

268
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:25,217
I just want to say that
I'm really glad you came,

269
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:28,521
and I'm just happy to have you here.

270
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:32,388
- Thanks, me too.
- All right, cool.

271
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,400
Three-thirty.

272
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,367
Pardon me.

273
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:50,976
Do you know where the bathroom is?

274
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:54,036
- Over there.
- Thanks.

275
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:37,480
Wha...?

276
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,494
Brad?

277
00:25:31,477 --> 00:25:33,401
Excuse me.

278
00:26:02,207 --> 00:26:05,098
Hey. Come dance.

279
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:08,508
Crazy bitch.

280
00:26:26,598 --> 00:26:28,556
Grace.

281
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:32,605
- You see how easy that was?
- What?

282
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:35,874
How I can just take him like that?

283
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:37,676
Why would you do that?

284
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:40,946
You steal my clothes,
you wear my makeup.

285
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:44,313
- I'm sorry.
- And for what?

286
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:47,476
You're still a child.

287
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:51,624
Nobody wants you.

288
00:26:51,724 --> 00:26:53,853
Leave me alone.

289
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,326
Do you even know what it feels
like to be touched, little girl?

290
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:03,736
- Just like your mother.
- How do you know about my mom?

291
00:27:03,836 --> 00:27:06,305
- Another worthless...
- I'm not like my mother.

292
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:07,973
- ...ugly...
- Stop talking!

293
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:11,101
- ...child!
- Stop it!

294
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:16,939
No.

295
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:27,393
My God.

296
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:31,260
Grace! Been looking
everywhere for you.

297
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:33,320
What's up?

298
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:35,668
- What's up?
- I...

299
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:40,105
- I didn't mean to do it.
- Okay, do what? You're freaking me out.

300
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:43,836
- What are you talking about? What?
- Jessica fell off the roof.

301
00:27:48,514 --> 00:27:51,083
Is this some kind of a joke?
I don't understand.

302
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:53,847
- What?
- There's...

303
00:27:54,353 --> 00:27:56,880
There's no one there, Grace.

304
00:27:57,022 --> 00:28:00,426
But I just saw her there.

305
00:28:00,526 --> 00:28:02,928
Okay, all right.

306
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:05,264
- But...
- That's fucked up for you to do.

307
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:07,266
Jesus.

308
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:09,268
Which one did I put my weed in?

309
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:11,036
- There she is.
- Jessica.

310
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,663
Hey, guys.

311
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,575
Whoa, are you okay?

312
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:19,168
Whoa, Grace, whoa!

313
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:43,433
How are you feeling?

314
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:45,927
Any pain?

315
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:51,677
- What happened?
- We're still trying to figure that out.

316
00:28:51,777 --> 00:28:54,168
You lost consciousness.

317
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,682
Jessica. Is she okay?

318
00:28:56,782 --> 00:28:59,718
- Who?
- The... The girl that fell.

319
00:28:59,818 --> 00:29:01,617
She...

320
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,460
Did you take anything?
Other than alcohol?

321
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,325
No.

322
00:29:10,963 --> 00:29:14,199
- You on any medication?
- No.

323
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:18,070
- Has this ever happened to you before?
- No.

324
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,706
What about family? Follow me.

325
00:29:20,806 --> 00:29:22,741
What do you mean?

326
00:29:22,841 --> 00:29:25,732
Any history of mental illness?

327
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:29,148
My mother was on antipsychotics.

328
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:31,809
What's her condition like now?

329
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,352
She died.

330
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:35,149
How?

331
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:40,088
- Giving birth to me.
- And your father?

332
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:43,183
I... I never knew him.

333
00:29:43,328 --> 00:29:45,286
I'm sorry.

334
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:51,837
Well, aside from a nasty bump on
the head, you appear to be fine.

335
00:29:51,937 --> 00:29:55,641
But I should tell you mental
illness is often hereditary.

336
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:58,143
Early diagnosis and
treatment are critical.

337
00:29:58,243 --> 00:30:01,280
So I recommend you see a
psychiatrist as soon as you can.

338
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,543
You understand me?

339
00:30:04,216 --> 00:30:06,641
- Yes.
- Good.

340
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:12,658
Wait, is there a phone I can use?

341
00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:17,060
If you're looking for your ride, we
already called your emergency contact.

342
00:30:39,985 --> 00:30:41,186
Coming up,

343
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:43,388
we have a nasty stretch of
weather coming your way.

344
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:46,618
Break out the umbrellas
as it is going to be wet.

345
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,132
Did you have sex?

346
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:55,868
No.

347
00:30:55,968 --> 00:30:57,202
Don't lie to me.

348
00:30:57,302 --> 00:31:01,365
- I'm not lying.
- And look at me when you answer.

349
00:31:02,374 --> 00:31:05,038
I'm not lying.

350
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:09,537
Okay.

351
00:31:12,684 --> 00:31:14,745
But you drank?

352
00:31:14,853 --> 00:31:17,881
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.

353
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:20,953
I'm sorry.

354
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,166
I think I need to see a doctor.

355
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:30,669
Grace. Why?

356
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:33,906
Because I'm worried I might
be sick like Mom was.

357
00:31:34,006 --> 00:31:36,441
Now's not the time
for making excuses.

358
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:41,980
- I'm not. The doctor told me...
- I don't care what the doctor told you.

359
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,017
Your mother suffered from
sickness of the soul.

360
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:49,248
That is not something
a doctor can fix.

361
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,319
Pull your skirt down.

362
00:31:58,263 --> 00:32:02,064
There's a jacket in the back,
and I want you to put it on.

363
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:06,238
I don't want them seeing
you in that clown suit.

364
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:08,205
Who?

365
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:17,239
Get in here.

366
00:32:17,516 --> 00:32:19,406
Coffee's ready.

367
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:27,954
Come on in, Grace.
Don't be rude, say hello.

368
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:30,762
Hello, Father John.

369
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:32,820
Have a seat.

370
00:32:37,536 --> 00:32:40,906
You look more like your
mother every time I see you.

371
00:32:41,006 --> 00:32:43,636
I guess so.

372
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:50,215
I want you to meet the newest
member of our congregation.

373
00:32:50,315 --> 00:32:54,453
He comes to us from
St. James Seminary.

374
00:32:54,553 --> 00:32:59,191
- It's good to finally meet you, Grace.
- You as well, Father.

375
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:02,394
Well, I'm still a deacon.

376
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:06,598
But I plan on taking my vow
to priesthood very soon.

377
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:09,668
With Father John's
approval, of course.

378
00:33:09,768 --> 00:33:12,159
There you go, Father.

379
00:33:13,105 --> 00:33:14,938
Yes.

380
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,533
Well, until he's ready,

381
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:22,948
Luke will be assisting me

382
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:26,884
with those who need guidance.

383
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,923
Now that you're back, I expect you'll
be spending more time with the church.

384
00:33:36,361 --> 00:33:39,031
Actually, I'm just gonna be
here for a few days, Father,

385
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:41,396
and then I'm gonna go back.

386
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:45,526
What?

387
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:48,862
You're not going back.

388
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:51,176
Wh...? Wh...?

389
00:33:51,276 --> 00:33:53,812
I pulled you out of school.

390
00:33:53,912 --> 00:33:57,382
- Why would you do that?
- It's done, Grace.

391
00:33:57,482 --> 00:34:00,407
- But...
- Not another word.

392
00:34:00,785 --> 00:34:04,552
Home is where you
need to be right now.

393
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:24,035
Don't you speak of it.

394
00:35:24,135 --> 00:35:25,934
Understand? Not a word.

395
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:28,939
Hello?

396
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:31,610
Grandma?

397
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,702
Keep quiet.

398
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,910
Listen to yourself.

399
00:35:46,024 --> 00:35:48,360
- Grace!
- Grandma.

400
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,962
You know to keep away from there.

401
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:53,698
Grandma, there's somebody in there.

402
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:56,902
Ridiculous. Nobody's been in
your mother's room for years.

403
00:35:57,002 --> 00:35:59,905
- What?
- Go back to your room.

404
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:03,542
No, but, Grandma,
I heard somebody in there.

405
00:36:03,642 --> 00:36:06,101
Grace, now!

406
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,179
Grace.

407
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:15,954
You stay away from that room,
do you understand me?

408
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:18,046
Yes.

409
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,810
Come on, come on.

410
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:42,914
Pick up.

411
00:36:43,014 --> 00:36:44,249
Is that Grace?

412
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:45,450
Give me that.

413
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,352
- Let me talk to her.
- Hang up.

414
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:49,183
Hello?

415
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:49,364
Grandma?

416
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,263
What?

417
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:09,418
Who are you?

418
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:14,823
Who are you?

419
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:17,250
Make him suffer.

420
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:43,149
Grace, you better be
getting ready in there.

421
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:47,688
- Grace, do you hear me?
- Yes.

422
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:04,628
- Do I look all right?
- Yeah.

423
00:42:06,738 --> 00:42:10,742
- Don't embarrass me today.
- I won't.

424
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:13,870
But really I'm just excited
to wear the fancy robes.

425
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:18,917
Did Alicia tell you we're
starting up a youth group?

426
00:42:19,017 --> 00:42:21,044
I see.

427
00:42:23,054 --> 00:42:25,581
- Good morning.
- Morning.

428
00:42:27,392 --> 00:42:30,693
Paul. Paul.

429
00:42:30,795 --> 00:42:32,063
I have your favorite

430
00:42:32,163 --> 00:42:34,895
- chocolate chip cookies.
- No, no.

431
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:43,007
Margaret, Margaret. Look at you.

432
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:45,276
You look beautiful.

433
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:47,612
Would you...?
Would you care for a sweet?

434
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:51,382
It's a little too early
for cookies, dear.

435
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:55,045
It's never too early for sweetness.

436
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:04,659
Where should I put these?

437
00:43:05,697 --> 00:43:07,792
Grandma?

438
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:10,997
Is everything okay?

439
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:14,064
Give me those.

440
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:19,844
Let temptation into your heart

441
00:43:19,944 --> 00:43:23,177
and the devil will destroy it!

442
00:43:24,816 --> 00:43:27,085
We all feel it, every day.

443
00:43:27,185 --> 00:43:30,622
Satan's grasp, calling us,

444
00:43:30,722 --> 00:43:35,889
asking us to betray God
for earthly pleasures.

445
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:40,732
The Bible teaches
us to reject this call.

446
00:43:40,832 --> 00:43:44,030
To ignore this temptation.

447
00:43:44,736 --> 00:43:48,299
But who among us is without sin?

448
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:55,346
It's easy to convince yourself that
you're walking the righteous path.

449
00:43:55,446 --> 00:43:58,747
That you have remained untainted.

450
00:43:59,283 --> 00:44:02,516
Sin is like an open wound.

451
00:44:03,054 --> 00:44:06,124
Left alone, it festers.

452
00:44:06,224 --> 00:44:10,082
Spreads, grows before your very eyes.

453
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:16,000
That is why we must
confront our mistakes,

454
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,331
correct them.

455
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:21,939
Grace.

456
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:23,474
Stop it.

457
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:27,808
Restore the purity of our souls.

458
00:44:28,946 --> 00:44:33,043
It is the only way into heaven.

459
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:37,083
Let us pray.

460
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,720
- The body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

461
00:44:42,827 --> 00:44:45,559
- The body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

462
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:50,631
- The body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

463
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:57,873
- The body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

464
00:45:25,203 --> 00:45:27,400
What's wrong with her?

465
00:45:27,905 --> 00:45:30,939
- Grace?
- Grace.

466
00:45:32,677 --> 00:45:35,346
You are in church. How dare you?

467
00:45:35,446 --> 00:45:37,849
She's so sorry.

468
00:45:37,949 --> 00:45:41,978
Out. Out. Out.

469
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:49,153
I don't know what
has gotten into you.

470
00:45:51,729 --> 00:45:53,931
Is this because I took
you out of school?

471
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:57,401
Is this some sick game you're
playing to hurt your grandmother?

472
00:45:57,501 --> 00:46:01,166
- No.
- Well, then, what is the problem?

473
00:46:05,943 --> 00:46:09,380
I've... I've been hearing things.

474
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,112
There's voices inside
my head, and I just...

475
00:46:15,186 --> 00:46:18,111
I keep having these nightmares.

476
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,491
But they feel so real

477
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:25,894
and I'm just a little
scared to fall asleep.

478
00:46:26,364 --> 00:46:28,599
I need to know what
happened to my mother.

479
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:30,001
Don't start, Grace.

480
00:46:30,101 --> 00:46:33,137
- Everyone said she went crazy.
- Drop it. I said drop it.

481
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:37,508
What if the same thing is
happening to me? I need help.

482
00:46:37,608 --> 00:46:42,536
Your mother disobeyed me,
ran off and got pregnant.

483
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:45,212
You do not need help.

484
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,543
You need God.

485
00:50:17,361 --> 00:50:19,490
Mama.

486
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:08,510
How did you get in there?

487
00:51:10,915 --> 00:51:13,451
The... The door was open.

488
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:15,714
No, it wasn't.

489
00:51:16,854 --> 00:51:20,815
I told you to stay
away from her room.

490
00:51:21,892 --> 00:51:24,385
I'm... I'm sorry.

491
00:51:27,865 --> 00:51:30,167
- What was that?
- What?

492
00:51:30,267 --> 00:51:33,465
- That noise?
- Nothing.

493
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:36,273
- What do you have?
- Nothing.

494
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:38,843
- What's behind your back?
- Nothing.

495
00:51:38,943 --> 00:51:40,377
You show it to me.

496
00:51:40,477 --> 00:51:42,713
- Leave me alone.
- I'm not gonna ask again.

497
00:51:42,813 --> 00:51:45,149
Grace! Grace!

498
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:46,951
You show me what's in there!

499
00:51:47,051 --> 00:51:50,181
- No!
- Show me what's in there.

500
00:51:51,222 --> 00:51:53,858
Grace! You keep this up,

501
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:56,622
you're gonna be just
like your mother.

502
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:59,997
- Leave me alone!
- Open this door!

503
00:52:00,097 --> 00:52:03,400
Grace! You stubborn,
disobedient child!

504
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,870
You open this goddamn door right now!

505
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,172
You are a bastard child!

506
00:52:08,272 --> 00:52:12,877
Did you know that? A bastard!
You should have never been born!

507
00:52:12,977 --> 00:52:15,779
Your only father you
ever had was God!

508
00:52:15,879 --> 00:52:19,884
You are just as simple
as your goddamn mother!

509
00:52:19,984 --> 00:52:22,620
I hate you! I hate you!

510
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,680
I hate you!

511
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:47,971
Morning, sunshine.

512
00:52:48,412 --> 00:52:50,336
Brad?

513
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:52,883
What are you doing here?

514
00:52:52,983 --> 00:52:55,686
Well, I came to see
if you were all right.

515
00:52:55,786 --> 00:52:58,245
I came to visit you.

516
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:01,320
I missed you.

517
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:05,396
I thought I'd be back soon, but...

518
00:53:05,496 --> 00:53:08,091
Well, I guess I couldn't wait, then.

519
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:17,671
You look great in the morning,
by the way.

520
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:21,145
You think I look...?

521
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:23,875
I think you look beautiful.

522
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:31,646
This can't be real.

523
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:35,214
You can't be real.

524
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:40,323
If I wasn't real,

525
00:53:40,698 --> 00:53:43,532
would I be able to do this?

526
00:53:57,147 --> 00:53:59,216
Would I be able to do this?

527
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:01,018
What are you doing?

528
00:54:01,118 --> 00:54:03,115
Trust me.

529
00:54:17,468 --> 00:54:19,529
My God.

530
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:24,268
Brad.

531
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:27,571
Brad, Brad, slow down,
slow down, slow down.

532
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:30,174
Brad. Stop!

533
00:54:30,914 --> 00:54:32,383
Doesn't that feel good?

534
00:54:32,483 --> 00:54:34,282
Grace?

535
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:41,680
My God.

536
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:49,433
I'm sorry.

537
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:52,834
You need to learn that
what you did is wrong.

538
00:54:52,936 --> 00:54:54,672
No! No! Grandma! Grandma, please!

539
00:54:54,772 --> 00:54:56,507
Filthy! Filthy! Filthy!

540
00:54:56,607 --> 00:54:58,108
- Turn over.
- Please stop!

541
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:01,312
Filth! Filthy! Filthy!

542
00:55:01,412 --> 00:55:04,781
Filthy! Filthy! Filthy!

543
00:55:33,377 --> 00:55:37,039
Grace? Look at me, Grace.

544
00:55:41,218 --> 00:55:43,487
If you can't control yourself,

545
00:55:43,587 --> 00:55:47,218
how are you going to stop
men from controlling you?

546
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:51,028
Your mother fought with me to leave
this church, look what happened to her.

547
00:55:51,128 --> 00:55:54,732
- She let some filthy stranger.
- Stranger?

548
00:55:54,832 --> 00:55:58,135
- open her up to sin
- What?

549
00:55:58,235 --> 00:56:01,035
...and that is what is
gonna happen to you.

550
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:03,540
Here's your stranger.

551
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,770
Grace. Grace, get back here!

552
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:10,914
You must understand, the needs
of the flesh are very real.

553
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:14,752
The trials of life,
you are gonna experience.

554
00:56:14,852 --> 00:56:19,656
But in this room, we can talk about
it in, you know, a casual...

555
00:56:19,756 --> 00:56:22,059
Grace. Hey.

556
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:25,429
I'm so glad you came.
Come on, please join the circle.

557
00:56:25,529 --> 00:56:27,197
Everybody, this is Grace.

558
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:29,800
- Hey.
- Hi, Grace.

559
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,404
Now, we're talking a lot
about the pressures outside,

560
00:56:33,504 --> 00:56:35,839
but what about inside?

561
00:56:35,939 --> 00:56:38,208
The desires of the flesh.

562
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:40,844
Now, I know it's...
It's a tough conversation,

563
00:56:40,944 --> 00:56:42,913
but sexual desires are real.

564
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:47,351
And remember, it's not
temptation that's the sin.

565
00:56:47,451 --> 00:56:49,920
It's how you deal
with the temptation.

566
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,820
Does anybody want to share?

567
00:56:52,923 --> 00:56:54,881
Grace?

568
00:56:54,992 --> 00:56:57,360
Anything you want to share?

569
00:56:57,961 --> 00:57:01,064
- No.
- Okay, no pressure.

570
00:57:01,164 --> 00:57:04,201
I want you to know that whenever
you do feel like sharing,

571
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:06,904
- this is a...
- Really?

572
00:57:07,004 --> 00:57:09,706
I heard that you were
pretty busy at school.

573
00:57:09,806 --> 00:57:12,109
I thought that you'd
have lots to share.

574
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:14,474
- All right.
- What?

575
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:17,614
I only thought maybe
she could help us avoid

576
00:57:17,714 --> 00:57:20,083
making the same
mistakes that she did.

577
00:57:20,183 --> 00:57:22,252
- Okay, Sally...
- Or,

578
00:57:22,352 --> 00:57:24,254
the same mistakes as her mother.

579
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:26,523
All right, that's enough.

580
00:57:26,623 --> 00:57:29,890
Get off me! Get off!

581
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:33,464
You're crazy!
You're just like your mother!

582
00:57:33,564 --> 00:57:35,864
Grace, what are you doing?

583
00:57:53,584 --> 00:57:55,679
Father John?

584
00:57:57,487 --> 00:57:59,878
- No.
- Grace.

585
00:58:00,157 --> 00:58:03,293
What was that? Are you crazy?

586
00:58:03,393 --> 00:58:05,295
I am crazy.

587
00:58:05,395 --> 00:58:08,495
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
it like that. I just...

588
00:58:08,966 --> 00:58:11,603
You can't haul off
and hit people, okay?

589
00:58:11,703 --> 00:58:14,137
Stop. Calm down.

590
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:17,572
You're gonna be fine.
I'm here for you.

591
00:58:18,842 --> 00:58:22,473
- Do you really mean that?
- Of course I do.

592
00:58:28,018 --> 00:58:30,087
I think you have the wrong idea.

593
00:58:30,187 --> 00:58:33,657
I... I don't know why I did that.

594
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:36,026
- Grace, calm down.
- I'm sorry.

595
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:37,461
- Listen...
- I'm sorry.

596
00:58:37,561 --> 00:58:39,292
Grace.

597
00:58:45,102 --> 00:58:49,573
Grace? Grace. Grace,
please, get in the car.

598
00:58:49,673 --> 00:58:51,241
Grace, get in the car.

599
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:54,311
- Get away from me!
- Grace, get in the car.

600
00:58:54,411 --> 00:58:56,713
Where are you going? Stop!

601
00:58:56,813 --> 00:58:59,816
- Grace, I need to talk to you.
- Leave me alone!

602
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:02,147
Grace!

603
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:51,932
Made me filthy.

604
00:59:52,569 --> 00:59:54,838
- It's not real.
- He made me filthy.

605
00:59:54,938 --> 00:59:58,034
He made me filthy.

606
00:59:58,341 --> 00:59:59,643
It won't come off.

607
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:03,246
- Get out of my head.
- It won't come off.

608
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:05,616
He needs to be punished.

609
01:00:05,716 --> 01:00:08,085
- He needs to be punished.
- What do you want?

610
01:00:08,185 --> 01:00:11,955
What do you want from me?
What? What did he do to you?

611
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:15,253
Look what he did to me.

612
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:20,626
Just tell me. Just tell
me what happened, please.

613
01:00:25,802 --> 01:00:27,635
You'll see.

614
01:02:24,687 --> 01:02:28,154
- You're hurting me.
- Stop crying.

615
01:02:52,349 --> 01:02:54,651
God forgive us. God forgive her.

616
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:56,419
Grace?

617
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:59,387
- Mama?
- Please.

618
01:02:59,756 --> 01:03:02,225
- Help me, please.
- God forgive her.

619
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:05,061
God forgive her. God forgive her.
God forgive her.

620
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:07,330
- Please, help me.
- God forgive her.

621
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,230
- No. Mama?
- God forgive her.

622
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:15,505
God forgive her. God forgive her.
God forgive her.

623
01:03:15,605 --> 01:03:17,974
God forgive her. God forgive her.

624
01:03:18,074 --> 01:03:20,343
- Let go!
- God forgive her.

625
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:22,333
Let me go.

626
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:25,634
Hello, Grandma.

627
01:05:28,938 --> 01:05:32,175
Grace. Thank God.

628
01:05:32,275 --> 01:05:35,872
I've been looking everywhere for you.

629
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:40,807
Why are you wearing that?

630
01:05:47,457 --> 01:05:49,688
Sweet girl.

631
01:05:49,826 --> 01:05:53,423
I'm sorry.

632
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:55,463
Don't cry.

633
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,275
Hello?

634
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:48,817
Is anybody there?

635
01:07:03,366 --> 01:07:07,127
Grace. Are you okay?

636
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:10,470
Can I come in, please?

637
01:07:11,074 --> 01:07:14,534
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come. Come in.

638
01:07:18,681 --> 01:07:20,717
Is Father John here?

639
01:07:20,817 --> 01:07:24,118
I, I think he stepped out.

640
01:07:26,055 --> 01:07:29,359
Hey, does your grandma
know you're here?

641
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:32,020
She was calling earlier.

642
01:07:32,262 --> 01:07:34,531
I already talked to her.

643
01:07:34,631 --> 01:07:38,568
Grace, look, what's going on?

644
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:42,138
She told me not to come home,
says she doesn't want me anymore.

645
01:07:42,238 --> 01:07:44,741
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

646
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:48,142
Stop, you're fine.

647
01:07:48,811 --> 01:07:51,781
I shouldn't have
come here. I'm sorry.

648
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:55,011
Come on. Come sit down.

649
01:07:55,518 --> 01:07:58,655
Look, let's talk.

650
01:07:58,755 --> 01:08:03,760
I know that you've been under
a lot of pressure recently.

651
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:09,926
I've just felt so out of place,
like I don't belong.

652
01:08:10,233 --> 01:08:13,970
I think we can all feel like
that from time to time.

653
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:17,207
In fact, I've felt a
little bit of that myself.

654
01:08:17,307 --> 01:08:19,809
Well, I guess we're
not that different.

655
01:08:19,909 --> 01:08:22,971
You know what it
feels like to be alone.

656
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:25,545
Don't you?

657
01:08:25,982 --> 01:08:27,747
Yeah.

658
01:08:28,818 --> 01:08:30,685
I do.

659
01:08:36,192 --> 01:08:38,828
Well, it's very late.

660
01:08:38,928 --> 01:08:41,097
Why don't we get you home?

661
01:08:41,197 --> 01:08:44,998
If I ask you something,
would you be honest with me?

662
01:08:45,935 --> 01:08:48,826
Do you think I'm beautiful?

663
01:08:50,073 --> 01:08:52,142
Grace, I...

664
01:08:52,242 --> 01:08:55,111
Of course, you're beautiful, but...

665
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:59,012
Would you love me if you could?

666
01:08:59,616 --> 01:09:03,042
God can't always fill that void.

667
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:11,789
I cannot give you what
you're looking for.

668
01:09:12,595 --> 01:09:15,156
Don't you want me?

669
01:09:15,365 --> 01:09:18,996
Just once before taking the vow?

670
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:22,405
Please.

671
01:09:22,505 --> 01:09:24,641
- It's okay.
- Please stop.

672
01:09:24,741 --> 01:09:27,544
- Nobody has to know.
- Please.

673
01:09:27,644 --> 01:09:30,171
You don't understand.

674
01:09:32,015 --> 01:09:33,950
No, no.

675
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,618
- Just take me.
- No, I can't.

676
01:09:35,718 --> 01:09:38,054
- I want you to.
- Stop, I can't.

677
01:09:38,154 --> 01:09:40,715
You will.

678
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:47,897
- Stop, stop.
- It's all right.

679
01:09:47,997 --> 01:09:50,567
God will forgive you.

680
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:54,702
- Stop.
- Devil! Leave her.

681
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:18,826
She's coming to.

682
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:23,462
Bind her.

683
01:10:52,795 --> 01:10:54,628
Grace?

684
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:57,233
Grace, wake up.

685
01:10:57,333 --> 01:11:00,827
I recommend you keep your distance.

686
01:11:06,109 --> 01:11:08,136
She's awake.

687
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:15,885
- Luke?
- Grace.

688
01:11:15,985 --> 01:11:19,980
Do not look at him.
You will answer to me only.

689
01:11:20,223 --> 01:11:21,624
Who are you?

690
01:11:21,724 --> 01:11:25,457
I'm Bishop Michael,
and I'm here to help you.

691
01:11:25,862 --> 01:11:27,752
What?

692
01:11:30,933 --> 01:11:33,102
Why am I tied down?

693
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:35,695
Show me the mark.

694
01:11:37,807 --> 01:11:39,542
Luke? What...?

695
01:11:39,642 --> 01:11:42,909
What are you doing? Stop it.

696
01:11:47,517 --> 01:11:49,509
Please.

697
01:11:51,954 --> 01:11:54,015
Please.

698
01:11:55,591 --> 01:11:58,294
Why are you doing this?

699
01:11:58,394 --> 01:11:59,929
Grace,

700
01:12:00,029 --> 01:12:04,033
if this is in fact Grace
that I'm speaking to,

701
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:11,405
the symbol you possess is a mark
of a dark servant, a demon.

702
01:12:13,443 --> 01:12:15,178
What does that mean?

703
01:12:15,278 --> 01:12:18,806
It means you are losing
possession of your soul.

704
01:12:18,915 --> 01:12:20,680
What?

705
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:26,552
What's gonna happen to me?

706
01:12:26,789 --> 01:12:32,862
Grace, the ritual you're about
to experience is very dangerous.

707
01:12:32,962 --> 01:12:37,900
You must understand that I will do
everything in my power to save you.

708
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,527
What are you gonna do?

709
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:48,769
No, please, no.

710
01:12:52,915 --> 01:12:58,514
I speak now directly to
the evil hiding in this body.

711
01:12:58,621 --> 01:13:01,791
- Reveal yourself.
- But I am Grace.

712
01:13:01,891 --> 01:13:04,193
Evil cannot hide in the house of God.

713
01:13:04,293 --> 01:13:09,790
Please, please just let me go.
I feel better. I feel so much better.

714
01:13:11,734 --> 01:13:15,797
- Please, please stop!
- That's enough. You're hurting her.

715
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:26,249
It's not Grace that I'm hurting.

716
01:13:26,349 --> 01:13:28,239
Please.

717
01:13:28,885 --> 01:13:35,485
Brothers, we should begin
the ritual, as we've discussed.

718
01:13:36,893 --> 01:13:40,262
I didn't do anything wrong.

719
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,258
Please.

720
01:13:50,273 --> 01:13:52,971
You're hurting me.

721
01:13:53,276 --> 01:13:56,112
See the cross of the Lord.

722
01:13:56,212 --> 01:14:01,117
Be gone your hostile powers which
have assaulted this servant of God

723
01:14:01,217 --> 01:14:03,553
and clouded her with terror.

724
01:14:03,653 --> 01:14:07,423
I cast you out, unclean spirit,

725
01:14:07,523 --> 01:14:10,626
along with every satanic
power of the enemy

726
01:14:10,726 --> 01:14:13,996
every apparition from
hell and all your legion,

727
01:14:14,096 --> 01:14:16,098
in the name of Jesus Christ.

728
01:14:16,198 --> 01:14:21,367
The Lord be with you
and with your spirits.

729
01:14:25,274 --> 01:14:27,777
For he himself commands you.

730
01:14:27,877 --> 01:14:32,114
He who cast you from the heights
of heaven to the depths of hell.

731
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:33,983
No one commands me.

732
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:38,287
Tremble in fear, Satan.
Enemy of the faith.

733
01:14:38,387 --> 01:14:41,524
Foe of the human race.
Begetter of death.

734
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:44,460
Depart, persecutor of the innocent.

735
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:50,227
Depart. For you are guilty
before almighty God.

736
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:53,035
Lord, hear our prayer.

737
01:14:53,135 --> 01:14:56,663
Our cries come before you.

738
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:03,874
In the name of the spotless lamb,

739
01:15:04,413 --> 01:15:08,985
I adjure you, ancient serpents,

740
01:15:09,085 --> 01:15:14,490
the judge of the living and
the dead, and your creator,

741
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:19,862
he who has the power to
resign you to darkness

742
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:24,321
that you depart posthaste.

743
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:27,803
Your soul is marked, priest.

744
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:30,737
- You broke your vow.
- Stop.

745
01:15:31,207 --> 01:15:34,775
- Silence, silence!
- God has forsaken you.

746
01:15:35,811 --> 01:15:38,839
Eternal suffering awaits you.

747
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:50,023
What have you done?

748
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:17,512
Hold her down!

749
01:16:34,837 --> 01:16:37,364
Go, go.

750
01:16:37,707 --> 01:16:40,376
Christ the Lord brings
your plans to nothing!

751
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:42,969
Fear him!

752
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:47,146
Crucified as man, yet triumphed
over the powers of hell.

753
01:17:14,143 --> 01:17:19,071
You cannot run from
your sins, priest.

754
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:26,722
You raped her mother,

755
01:17:26,822 --> 01:17:29,850
abandoned her...

756
01:17:32,795 --> 01:17:37,791
and left a child for me to take.

757
01:17:39,769 --> 01:17:44,071
Too long have you gone unpunished.

758
01:17:44,673 --> 01:17:48,338
I am your retribution.

759
01:17:55,351 --> 01:17:58,721
Do with me what you will.

760
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:02,219
I go to the hands of God.

761
01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:05,653
Let's see if he catches you!

762
01:18:23,846 --> 01:18:28,778
Devil! I command you to leave her.

763
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:31,687
You can free her,

764
01:18:31,787 --> 01:18:37,181
but only through death!

765
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:49,126
I will not murder for you.

766
01:18:57,012 --> 01:18:59,107
Very well.

767
01:18:59,515 --> 01:19:01,883
Wait, stop.

768
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,549
Take me instead.

769
01:19:10,526 --> 01:19:13,896
You give yourself willingly?

770
01:19:13,996 --> 01:19:17,263
Only if you let her live.

771
01:19:18,968 --> 01:19:22,471
Her soul for a priest's?

772
01:19:22,571 --> 01:19:25,531
A worthy trade.

773
01:20:12,888 --> 01:20:14,778
Luke?

774
01:20:16,058 --> 01:20:17,693
Are you okay?

775
01:20:17,793 --> 01:20:20,957
No, go away.

776
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:25,434
Wait.

777
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:28,095
I'm sor... sorry.

778
01:20:29,872 --> 01:20:33,108
Please, please.

779
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,667
You have to go.

780
01:20:38,614 --> 01:20:40,914
Go!

781
01:21:19,154 --> 01:21:22,921
Father, we're ready for you.

782
01:21:54,857 --> 01:22:00,251
Hallelujah

783
01:22:06,101 --> 01:22:10,232
Hallelujah

784
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:18,981
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

785
01:22:19,081 --> 01:22:20,914
Amen.

786
01:22:21,283 --> 01:22:23,514
Let us pray.
