1
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,700
Subjects wanted!

2
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,200
Profits: 4000 mark, 
for a 14 day during experiment.

3
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,200
..in a spurious jail.

4
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,900
Crown Plaza, please.

5
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,200
THE EXPERIMENT

6
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,600
- Take care.
- You too.

7
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,000
Fighting dogs, fighting dogs?
Where for does someone need fighting dogs?

8
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,700
In former days the Romans used to have fighting dogs.

9
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,600
Sorry, don't I know you?

10
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,600
Hold on, B&S, cola, Spiegel and
don't take me wrong...

11
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,100
...Hubba Bubba, right or am I right?

12
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,300
Right.

13
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,300
Hey, now I know. Aren't you from 
that booth down Aachenerstrasse?

14
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,600
And you are Tarek, right or am I right?

15
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,600
Yeah, that's right.

16
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
Yes, I know every cabdriver in this town.
Cabdriver?

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
I was one either some day.

18
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,100
Good day gentleman.

19
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,300
I am doctor Grimm, the scientific 
assistant of this experiment.

20
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,700
You all know what you are here for?
Subjects.

21
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,100
The experiment is painless.
There's no need for medication.

22
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,100
It's about group-behaviour in an 
imprisoned situation.

23
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Are we playing guards or imprisoners?

24
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,100
You are divided into groups. 
The computer will decide that.

25
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,100
We are doing a series of tests to 
examine your psychic condition.

26
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
Previously I need to make the following remark:

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Willing to participate in this experiment

28
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,100
means you will renounce 
your private life and fundamental rights.

29
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,000
Anyone having problems with that?

30
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,100
Ok, then let's start.

31
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,200
Steward? 
No, ground personnel.

32
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,100
then it's about time!

33
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,100
Mr. Faahd?.. 
Fahd.

34
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,900
come with me please.

35
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,100
It says here you drive a cab.
Yes.

36
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,900
Is that your real job or just temporary?

37
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
What you mean, temporary?

38
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,800
I mean, aren't you having any other jobs 
besides driving a cab?

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No.

40
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm just asking, because it says here also that
you have studied philosophy, architecture and sociology.

41
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,900
Yes, that is correct, it's true..... 

42
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,700
temporarily.

43
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Good Mr. Fahd, your moral values are almost all
within the norms and you have a good condition.

44
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,700
That is important,
you can during the experiment

45
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,200
being exposed to very extreme situations.

46
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
Extreme situations?

47
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
But you will watch over me, don't you?

48
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
Uhm, the experiment will be guarded 24 hours 
a day by video.

49
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,000
So nothing will happen to me.

50
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,034
Oh no!
- Yes!

51
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,912
He lives!

52
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,116
You've owed me 500 for two years.

53
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,992
l know, you'll get it.

54
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,396
Sounds interesting.
They say the army is behind it.

55
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,072
With plenty of money.

56
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,793
What do you want?

57
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,708
Start again? Say "sorry"?
Kind of late after two years!

58
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,592
l had stress.

59
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,672
You drive a taxi.

60
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,118
Yes.

61
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,516
And you want to be
locked up for two weeks!

62
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,472
But it's a good story.

63
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,194
Ten thousand. lncluding photos.
No expenses.

64
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,748
Thanks.

65
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,348
Yes?
-Hi, Fahd. l called.

66
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,513
l told you, don't jump on the sofa!

67
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,758
1 lux, 250 by 268 pixels.

68
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,749
Press right: freeze frame.
Press left: continuous motion.

69
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,553
Receiver and recorder disguised
as a Walkman. The transmitter...

70
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,353
...has a range of a 100 meters.

71
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,511
Cool.

72
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,552
Ready for tomorrow?
- Sure.

73
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,760
This is a reference test.
We'll do it again after the experiment.

74
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,830
Don't worry. lt's not unpleasant.

75
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,912
Don't you feeI weII?

76
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,392
lt's okay.

77
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,673
Do you have a probIem
with encIosed spaces?

78
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,552
Everything okay, no problem.

79
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,792
Shit.

80
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,872
Shit, shit, shit!

81
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,152
Are you injured?

82
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,193
You had red!
You could've been dead!

83
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,472
This is my father's car.

84
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,632
He'll be happy you're alive.

85
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,948
l'm coming from his funeral.

86
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,992
What?

87
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,630
Where were you going?
- To Zandvoort.

88
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,472
Maybe you shouldn't go there.

89
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,313
What?

90
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,989
l don't believe in coincidences.
Nothing just happens in life.

91
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,835
Even the worst things somehow
make sense.

92
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,558
l, for example,
should no longer drive a taxi.

93
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,799
This will hurt a little.

94
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,039
Funny, it seems to be deep,
but there's no blood.

95
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,118
lf you're right, why is he dead?

96
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,872
What sense does that make?

97
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,432
Don't know.

98
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,678
Worst thing is, l couldn't
talk to him anymore.

99
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,676
Didn't see him for four years,
couldn't talk to him anymore.

100
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,552
Maybe that wasn't necessary.

101
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,712
He was 65. He had a good life.

102
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,038
'Dora, be glad, he had a nice death.'

103
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,312
But l'm not glad.

104
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,955
l'm not here any more.

105
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,831
Sometimes life doesn't go on.
That's okay.

106
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,512
Can l lie down somewhere?

107
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,832
Are you going to stay here?

108
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,749
Yes, l'll be next door.
- No, l mean here.

109
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,915
Please meet Professor Thon,
the director of this experiment.

110
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,709
Gentlemen, l would like to thank
all of you for participating.

111
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,112
You are brave men.

112
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,432
You laugh, but l'm serious.

113
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,518
The next two weeks will be
a new experience for you.

114
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,074
You'll undergo and exert pressure.

115
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,149
Some of you will have
no civil rights for two weeks.

116
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,752
Do not underestimate that.

117
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,036
lf anyone wants to go now,
it's your last chance.

118
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,910
Your safety is number one priority.

119
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,235
Violence must not be used!
Whoever gets violent...

120
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,318
...is out of the experiment.
ls that clear?

121
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,678
Fine. Would the following
gentlemen please stand up:

122
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,553
Are we prisoners or guards?

123
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,112
Please, gentlemen.

124
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,752
Guards! Cool!

125
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,312
Please put on your uniforms.

126
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,435
But we get 4000 too?

127
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,432
Four? l get 8000!

128
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,358
No, we have to pay.

129
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,550
Hands on your back, legs spread!

130
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,669
Gentlemen.

131
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,995
You are now guards
at a penitentiary.

132
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,315
Your job is to maintain
peace and order,

133
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,556
to make sure the rules are obeyed.

134
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,990
Take it seriously! The experiment
succeeds or fails with you!

135
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,350
lf you don't do your job right...

136
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,632
...the experiment makes no sense
and we can stop it right now.

137
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,830
You don't play guards,
you are guards!

138
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,679
Your first task: to explain
the situation to the prisoners.

139
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,350
Please turn around!

140
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,549
Thanks.

141
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,512
Next one, please!

142
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,432
Go over there!

143
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,909
Put on the dress!

144
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,352
What about underwear?
- No underwear!

145
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,072
Can l have number 69?
- Quiet!

146
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,270
l hope it's a mixed sauna!

147
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,077
They're crazy, women's coats!
Maybe we have to piss sitting down!

148
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,032
Quiet, 69!

149
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,632
Let's go!

150
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,832
Everyone out, please!

151
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,353
Really cool!

152
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,232
The 1st day

153
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,150
Keep going! Everyone in line!

154
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,592
ls there Pay-TV?

155
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,912
They're nuts, look at this!

156
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,192
Keep going, please. Quickly!

157
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,910
Did you imagine this?
- No. Quite a professional slammer!

158
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,554
Now we're in deep shit.

159
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,113
Stand in a row on the marker line!

160
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,792
What happens now?

161
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:58,719
Prison rules. One: The prisoners
address each other by numbers only.

162
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,517
Two: The prisoners address
the guards as "Mr Prison Guard".

163
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,110
Three: At "lights out",
the prisoners must not talk.

164
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,310
Then we'll sing!
- Quiet!

165
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,837
Four: Meals are to be
eaten up completely.

166
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,832
Read the menu to us!

167
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,229
Quiet!

168
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,832
Five: Each order of the guards
is to be obeyed immediately.

169
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,716
Six: Failure to obey the rules
will result in punishment.

170
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,592
What kind of punishment?

171
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,516
We'll see to that. We're flexible.
And now cell assignments.

172
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,359
When l call out your number
go to the cells!

173
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,234
21, 74, 86 - cell 1 .

174
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,433
82, 15, 94 - cell 2.

175
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,716
77, 69, 38 - cell 3.

176
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,116
53, 40, 11 - cell 4.

177
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,196
l'll tell you, l snore.
- Great.

178
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,711
You get the bottom bunk.
- Alright.

179
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,592
l'm Joe.
- Tarek.

180
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,790
And you?
- Thirty-eight.

181
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,918
Why do you want to take
part in this experiment?

182
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,315
Because l think it
can be very interesting.

183
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,755
4000 marks is a lot of money.

184
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,790
You can really relax and
experience something new.

185
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,872
You have to be open to ideas
and l need the money.

186
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,390
lt might be lots of fun.

187
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,672
Because of the bucks.

188
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,594
General interest.

189
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,995
l was never in prison.

190
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,713
Me? No!

191
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,757
No.

192
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,714
No, really.

193
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,710
Jeez! l'm a regular guy!

194
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,912
l have a kiosk, corner of
Brussels and Aachen Street.

195
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,272
Executive.

196
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,631
l have a few people
working under me.

197
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,108
l'm a school teacher.

198
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,038
l perform as Elvis.

199
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,918
l work for an airline.

200
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,830
Here's my card.

201
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,077
ln seven years l was never late.

202
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,352
Where's the next cigarette machine?

203
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,872
Downstairs and to the right!

204
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,312
Hey, Elvis.

205
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,950
Sing something!

206
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,872
Yes, sing a song!

207
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,592
When do we get to eat?

208
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,792
We're hungry!

209
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,031
Do you have something
against anal burning?

210
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,553
What do you do in real life?
- l'm an electrician. High voltage.

211
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,956
Them with the big cables. You?
- Taxi driver.

212
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,672
And you, 38?
- You ask too much, 77.

213
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,908
l guess something with numbers.

214
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,912
Bus driver.

215
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,555
Numbers and staring straight
ahead silently, right?

216
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,232
Life guard!

217
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,632
Really?

218
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,912
You know this one?

219
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,153
Which animal has only
one lip on the vulva?

220
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,152
Half a roasted chicken.

221
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,511
What do the Arabs call
a cow barn? Moobarrac!

222
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,078
Why do women always watch
porn films to the end?

223
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,712
They think they'll get married.

224
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,314
l know one that's a bit longer.
Three guys in front of a sauna.

225
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,195
One of them goes in and there is
a giant, fat woman with a huge...

226
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,072
Three against three!

227
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,952
Come on, you coward!

228
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,717
The cheese is so dry
you could smoke it.

229
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,275
l've got a kiosk, there's
always something going on.

230
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,755
l've got an open ear for everyone.

231
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,317
Listening you can't learn.
You're born with it.

232
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,954
Drink your milk, 82.
- l don't drink milk.

233
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,117
l get postcards from Jamaica,
Sri Lanka...

234
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,912
Rule number four, 82.
Consume all your food!

235
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,110
l never drink milk. l hate milk.

236
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,675
Go on, a rule is a rule!

237
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,629
Milk makes me sick.
- Drink. Your. Milk.

238
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,233
One to zero for us, Schutte!

239
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,675
Eat up! You have two minutes.

240
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,592
Back to your cells!

241
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,472
ldiot!

242
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,752
ls there a problem?

243
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,632
Away from the doors!

244
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,670
Now: Shut up! Bedtime!

245
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,592
Anyone hurt?

246
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,032
Quiet! Whoever talks now...

247
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,912
...does push-ups.

248
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,632
Good night, ladies!

249
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,595
Can you live from that?
- Sure.

250
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,916
You can't let them push you around!

251
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,350
What should l do?

252
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,789
They have to take us seriously
or we can forget it.

253
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,879
lf you say he has to drink
his milk, then he has to.

254
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,752
Yeah, sure.

255
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,309
But the Elvis number is good!
- Cool hip swing!

256
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,435
My wife made that.
- No, thanks. Do you have kids?

257
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,313
A son, four months.

258
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,795
Sweet! These are my rug rats.

259
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,712
Twins? Cute, too.

260
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,513
Can l see them as well?
- Sure.

261
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,555
What about you, Berus?
- A daughter.

262
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,198
How old?
- She'll be twelve in three days.

263
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,552
Do you have a photo?

264
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,271
No photo?
What kind of a father are you?

265
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,152
l'm a good father!

266
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,714
Eckert? Do you have kids?

267
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,712
What's up now?

268
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,952
Out you come, 77.

269
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,472
Why?
- l said, out!

270
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,752
Push-ups!

271
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,074
Can't you say that friendlier?
- Push-ups!

272
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,595
l heard you the first time, homo.

273
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,958
Very easy - just say please once.

274
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,834
What?

275
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,793
Fine, the whole cell, out!
38, 69, out!

276
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,036
Wait a sec, did you sleep
on your Superman comics?

277
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,515
They're not involved. Talk to me!

278
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,392
And down! Twenty!

279
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,350
l didn't do anything!

280
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,072
Remember who
you have to thank for this.

281
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,598
Jerk!

282
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,472
And another twenty for that!

283
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,200
l had no idea
you could be so hard!

284
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,072
Great show!

285
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,595
Did you see that?
They're doing everything.

286
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,276
Get up! Out of the cells!
Line up!

287
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,239
The 2nd day

288
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,395
Get moving!

289
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,273
The ladies in cell three,
sore muscles?

290
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,592
Morning.

291
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,159
lf l installed a taxi radio
the drivers could order some meat...

292
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,158
...and l have it deep fried on time.

293
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,032
Gentlemen, finish breakfast!

294
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,232
82,

295
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,112
you didn't drink your milk.

296
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,998
l said that l don't drink milk.

297
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,190
Well, milk or push-ups.

298
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,439
But l miss some enzyme!

299
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,518
Wonderful, let's do push-ups
instead of milk.

300
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,954
All together, right? Let's do
push-ups for Schutte.

301
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,672
Sure we'll do push-ups!

302
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,870
Excuse me, Mr. Prison Guard!

303
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,798
One, two, three...

304
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,789
...four, five, six...

305
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,199
...seven, eight, nine...

306
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,672
That's clever.

307
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,355
What if he really is allergic to milk?
- Nonsense. The problem is 77.

308
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,352
Come on, bed check!

309
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,312
He really stinks!

310
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,069
You learn that as a lifeguard?
- The very first thing.

311
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,714
77, made your bed yet?

312
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,552
That's mean.

313
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,870
You'll have to do it again!

314
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,352
Do it again, l said!

315
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,719
l'll count to three
and the bed is made.

316
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,592
And one!

317
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,592
And two!

318
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,432
And three!

319
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,592
Shall l call the guards?

320
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,189
Jutta, quickly!

321
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,034
Come on, l'll help you.

322
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,515
We don't want to get out
of here anyway, do we?

323
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,830
We want gummy bears!
And cable TV.

324
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,551
That's a walkie-talkie, no phone!

325
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,750
What about pizza?
- Yeah, pizza.

326
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,199
And porn magazines!

327
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,752
What about basketball?

328
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,036
Admit it! You lost!
lt's just a game!

329
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,753
Here we go now, here we go now!

330
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,152
Piss off, cocksucker!

331
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,790
Barricades, barricades!

332
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,358
What's going on there?
- We didn't do anything!

333
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,552
ln two hours they're exhausted.

334
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,310
We have to react or
they do what they want!

335
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,634
77, the asshole.

336
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,077
Professor, what shouId we do now?

337
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,270
Bosch, that won't do any good!

338
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,674
We can't use vioIence.

339
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,473
We stick together.
They're tweIve, we're eight.

340
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,314
Suggestions?

341
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,793
Berus, what about you?
Don't you ever say anything?

342
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,278
l once read...

343
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,152
What? l can't understand you.

344
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,750
l once read that you get
control in such a situation...

345
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,277
...with humiliation.

346
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,359
We don't want to hurt anyone,
they just have to respect us.

347
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,470
After 36 hours - it's incredible!

348
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,032
Undress!

349
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,828
Get up! Strip off your coats!

350
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,712
We give up!

351
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,712
Hey, they gave up!

352
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,992
Seventy-seven!

353
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,396
Keep calm, it's all a game, okay?
- Go, Berus!

354
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,272
Undress!

355
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,152
Your hand!

356
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,672
And down!

357
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,194
Wasn't that a bit too hard?

358
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,073
No, as long as they don't say
anything up there, we're doing fine.

359
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,872
They do want
some action down here!

360
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,558
Bosch, it wasn't violence.

361
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,753
Fire extinguishers, Berus, cooI.

362
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:33,759
Gentlemen, you've restored peace
and order, solved your problem.

363
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,278
Keep going! But please remember
to act appropriate.

364
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,469
Perhaps the next conflict can be
solved differently. Thank you.

365
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,993
This is Tarek Fahd,
messages after the beep.

366
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,992
What happens next?

367
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,115
Nothing happens. Stay calm,
that's the best strategy.

368
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,392
You can get the bed.

369
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,192
Get out!

370
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,194
The 3rd day

371
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,312
Good morning, gentlemen!

372
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,316
l think no-one wants
to repeat last night.

373
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,558
We still have eleven days to go.
Suggestion:

374
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,593
We stay reasonable...

375
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,156
...then we all get our money
and that's it.

376
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,151
Okay?
Or does anyone like stress?

377
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,876
Good. ls that okay, 77?

378
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,032
Yeah.

379
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,594
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

380
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,394
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.
- Fine.

381
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,830
See! lt wasn't that bad.

382
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,279
82, if you have to puke,
then go to the loo.

383
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,709
That's the rule.
He has to drink. We can't help it.

384
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,953
We thought we'd restore
order, make them obey us.

385
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,436
So it runs smoother for us.

386
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,073
That we have them in our hands,
that we're at the helm again.

387
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,952
After all, it wasn't violence.

388
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,592
We'll see what happens.

389
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,515
Hi, Schutte
- No names!

390
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,554
Tell me, why are you doing this?

391
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,797
l do it often. Guinea pig.

392
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,919
Once l got an intestinal probe.
lt was worse than this here.

393
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,430
The people were nicer,
but l got only 900 marks for it.

394
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,630
What do you do with the money?

395
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,555
l've got sort of a dream.
- Yeah, what?

396
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,118
No, you'll laugh at me.
- l won't laugh at you. l promise.

397
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,516
A Ferrari.
- Do you know what a Ferrari costs?

398
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,755
Not a new one.
l know a dealer, he likes me.

399
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,189
Maybe a '89
if the bank plays along.

400
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,869
Fine. But to fill her up
you'll need another loan.

401
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,513
A yellow one.

402
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,598
l'd park it at my kiosk
so that everyone can see it.

403
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,029
l dreamed of it all my life.

404
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,833
lt's important to have a dream.

405
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,996
l read that somewhere.
lt's true. What's your dream?

406
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,428
Does anyone have drugs here?
l think this is a jail!

407
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,632
Keep your trap shut today, 77!
- What do you want?

408
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,034
Kiss my ass!

409
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,470
Mr Prison Guard Berus,
l've got a question.

410
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,914
That number yesterday,
could it be that it turned you on a bit?

411
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,555
l think l saw it clearly.
Did you fuck your wife hard at home?

412
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,070
Shut up, you idiot!
- Or don't you have a wife?

413
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,952
Could be.

414
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,998
Ground staff, right? You're all gay!

415
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,195
And Mr Prison Guard,
there's something else.

416
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,472
You smell a bit strong.

417
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,109
Yes! Has anyone ever told you
that you stink, man!

418
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,351
There's something,
people call it soap.

419
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,029
lf you'd use it you wouldn't
stink any more. Although -

420
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,400
l reckon for some people
even that doesn't work.

421
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,193
Shut up!
- Yeah, hit me, girlie!

422
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,870
Hit me and you're out of here!

423
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,155
No, you won't hit me.
You're really hot for this job here!

424
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,599
Tarek, stop it!

425
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,157
Don't spoil it! There's so much
more you could do with us!

426
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,152
What's going on here?

427
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,554
Nothing. 77 is going back to his cell.

428
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,912
Not bad.

429
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,952
Give me that thing!

430
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,150
What are they paying for the story?

431
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,475
Phase 3: Prisoner attacks prisoner.
You're pushing it on purpose!

432
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,953
Kiss my ass!

433
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,672
They pay more if it really gets wild!

434
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,271
And what are you doing here,
soldier?! Name, rank, outfit!

435
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,230
Come on, you can't fool me!

436
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,955
Steinhoff, Air Force, Major.

437
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,152
Pilot?
- Yes. Who are you working for?

438
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,955
'Reporter'. What else
is going to happen?

439
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,478
They're going to provoke
a series of stress situations.

440
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,353
What is your job?
- Observe and report.

441
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,837
And not let myself be manipulated.

442
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,518
So that's it.

443
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,710
Yes, that's the way it is.

444
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:05,637
86,

445
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,115
...21, 74, 94, 15, 82...

446
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,192
...38, 77, 69, 53, 40, 11 .

447
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,790
Whoever talks now sleeps in the
yard without a blanket. Clear?

448
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,672
Dismissed.

449
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,109
Surprise!

450
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,552
We can't do that!

451
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,752
What do we have here?

452
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,475
Guys! lt's just to warm up!

453
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,635
Sorry, l wanted to ask if
l could go a bit earlier today.

454
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,797
l thought we'll deal with 77!
- Yeah, l know.

455
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,391
What "l know"? No, Bosch!
"When?"... then everyone.

456
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,789
Yes.

457
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,959
l brought something else!

458
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,109
Are you crazy?
- lt's only a gas gun with blanks.

459
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,318
Dennis, it's me.
l'm not selling the house.

460
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,870
l have to go back to Cologne.
l'll call you.

461
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,158
You got along well, didn't you?

462
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,519
He was the most clever person
l've known. Showed me everything.

463
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,072
Ain't easy having such a father.

464
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,072
My father...

465
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,152
...is an asshole.

466
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,590
The greatest asshole in the world.

467
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,632
We had this little game.

468
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,113
He said don't do that and l did it.

469
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,468
What?

470
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,352
Everything. Always.

471
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,432
He's a photographer.

472
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,870
When l was eight he locked me
in his darkroom. For a whole day.

473
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,070
l was really afraid in there.

474
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,872
l cried, whined, begged for hours.

475
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,393
My mother didn't dare to let me out.

476
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,512
At some point...

477
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,156
...l didn't have the strength
to scream any more.

478
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,994
Then everything got really quiet.

479
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,035
l thought l was going to die.

480
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,478
But l only pissed my pants.

481
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,991
Fasten your seat belt, sweetie!

482
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,198
You stupid little asshole!
You think you're smart!

483
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,392
No cameras!

484
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,599
We're all alone here.
- We just want to talk to you.

485
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,157
You're not saying anything!

486
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,310
Make sure to leave no marks!

487
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,436
How sweet he can look!

488
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,755
l'm not sure if
l should hit him or fuck him!

489
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,992
Enough!

490
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,550
Sit still or it's gonna hurt!

491
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,755
Give it to me!

492
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,553
Do it properly! Got to look right.

493
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,076
lf it's gonna be cold,
we'll knit you a cap.

494
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,235
You will no longer
endanger the experiment.

495
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,957
We'll say you applied for release,
then you're out by tomorrow.

496
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,310
We don't want you any more.
- Did you get that, 77?

497
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,432
Hey, dickhead!
- Let me hear you understood, 77!

498
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,915
l understand.
- Say it right!

499
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,072
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

500
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,633
l've got to piss.
- Did it hurt?

501
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,395
l think l have to piss, too.

502
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,954
Well, who stinks now?

503
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,875
You can sing him a lullaby, Bosch.

504
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,239
You asked the guards?
- Yes.

505
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:13,997
The 4th day

506
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,680
Why?
- lt itched.

507
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:19,392
How do you feel?

508
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,312
Fine, thank you.

509
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,479
You made an application?
- What kind of application?

510
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,752
The guards told us that you
would like to leave, Mr. Fahd.

511
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,312
That's complete nonsense.

512
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:50,517
Listen! 77 has decided to
stay with us to our great joy.

513
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,191
Now: lf 77 gets out of line
everyone has to pay for it!

514
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,272
l don't hear anything.

515
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,152
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

516
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,432
You're so stupid.

517
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,517
l'm getting out of here,
but not this way.

518
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,392
What's your plan?

519
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,793
Head down, 94!
Chin to your chest!

520
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,397
No lies, no dirty words!
We'll read each letter.

521
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,672
Why aren't you writing?

522
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,593
Who to?
- Your pals from the kiosk.

523
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,478
l just made all that up.

524
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,752
l don't have any pals. l might know
what they smoke, but...

525
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,672
Don't talk, write!

526
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,830
...l don't really know them.

527
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,634
Write: Bilker Strasse 278,

528
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,113
50300 Cologne.

529
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,992
Are you gonna be quiet there?

530
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,992
Write to me!

531
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,836
From there on there are no cameras.
- And you didn't see any of that?

532
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,359
l was changing the tapes.

533
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,232
Someone always has to watch!

534
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,911
l don't like it. A serious
assault on the fourth day!

535
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,510
lt's the power struggle between
Berus and 77, as expected.

536
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,916
The lock in the basement door
has to be changed!

537
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,719
Put the letters into the envelopes.

538
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,592
And don't seal them.

539
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,991
Just a moment! 77, step out!

540
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,554
You're not interested in
writing letters?

541
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,116
So it was your last one!
Back in line!

542
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,552
Turn left!

543
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,432
Now the song!

544
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,549
Whoever doesn't know the words
by tomorrow really has it coming!

545
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,838
Dismissed.

546
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,195
Thanks.

547
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:10,199
You want to bust it? Maybe the
others just want their money!

548
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,830
You think what's happening
here is okay?

549
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,832
That's not the point.

550
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,918
l can't manage it by myself.
You're the only one l can ask.

551
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,110
Are you going to help me, pilot?

552
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,271
Are you going to help me, Steinhoff?
- No.

553
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,152
Go fuck yourself.
- You too.

554
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,909
You're a soldier! Embarrassing,
if you broke it off!

555
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,519
l reject any escalation.
- But you forgot one thing:

556
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,428
lt's not a war, it's a simulation!
- ls it?

557
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,995
You always do what they tell you!

558
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,192
You really think Berus
wanted to get rid of you?

559
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,393
He wanted to see if you'd come back.
You did what they expected you to do.

560
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,990
You're endangering the whole
group. So l won't help you.

561
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,872
Let me out!

562
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,948
What's wrong with you? Stay calm!

563
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,516
From now on 69 is called Sissy.

564
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,992
Calm down!

565
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,230
13,...

566
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,078
14, 15...

567
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,079
lt's only an experiment, a joke!
You apply, tomorrow you're out!

568
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,232
You want to leave us?

569
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,238
Yes, it's too much for me.

570
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,388
You know you won't get paid?
- Yes.

571
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,838
But you said you did it
because of the money?

572
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,235
That's right.

573
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,079
And now you don't care
about the money any more?

574
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,713
l want to go!

575
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,195
Mr. Maier, how do you feel now?

576
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:34,916
l want out!

577
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,759
l couldn't live without cigarettes.

578
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,995
What if we decided
not to release you?

579
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,472
But l can go any time!
You said it's voluntary!

580
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,392
Or isn't it?

581
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,195
Tomorrow we'll let you know
our decision.

582
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,073
Tomorrow?

583
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:18,115
l'm not going back in there.
l want to go now!

584
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,519
Klaus? This man worries me.

585
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,952
No, he's only faking.

586
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,193
The man has had it!

587
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,552
SlSSY

588
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,632
Sixty-nine!

589
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,632
Leave me alone, damn it!

590
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,430
What the hell am l doing here?

591
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,035
What's the matter there?
- Number 53 doesn't feel well!

592
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,912
Guards!
- Guards!

593
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,272
l want out!

594
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,993
The man has a serious concussion.
Berus hit him in cold blood.

595
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,669
He acted his role. But l don't
approve of the accident.

596
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,234
lf we don't take Berus out,
we are forcing the escalation.

597
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,715
lntervention, yes.
That was our approach.

598
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,239
This is going too far!

599
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,397
We need 77, we need Berus.
These are dynamic factors.

600
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,399
lf we take Berus out, it means
aborting. Do you want that?

601
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,436
lf l see you hit a prisoner again,
you're out.

602
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:16,629
That was necessary to restore
peace and order in the prison.

603
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,759
Don't tell me how to do my job.
lf there are problems...

604
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,348
...l want to hear it from
Professor Thon personally.

605
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,232
Good day, Doctor.

606
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,755
What? l can't understand you!

607
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,958
You have to speak louder, Dora.
l can't hear you.

608
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,592
Hold your breath!

609
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:49,439
This is a panic attack.
lf you hyperventilate you'll pass out.

610
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:54,112
Breathe shallowly, calm down.

611
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:00,512
Never had anything like that before.
- Sit down. Real slow.

612
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,156
Everything all right?

613
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:08,513
lt's fine. lt's a joke.
Everything's just a game.

614
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,471
That's your mistake!
You're lost with that attitude.

615
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,670
lt's never a game, get that!

616
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,152
What do they know about you?

617
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,675
No idea.

618
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,152
What are you looking at?

619
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,552
Do l look like shit?

620
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,752
l got Dumbo ears, right?

621
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,512
You asshole!

622
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,397
What are you going to do
when you're out?

623
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,999
Fly away!

624
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,910
Are you going to help me now?

625
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,832
l can't!

626
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,758
Okay 69, time's up,
back to your cell!

627
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,672
Move it!

628
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,672
l'm scared shitless.

629
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,236
l keep my mouth shut.

630
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,998
l don't wanna...

631
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,038
get beaten up in there.

632
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:08,472
Did you see that on video?

633
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,797
He hit him full tilt!

634
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:12,875
ls the man well?

635
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,073
l'll still go in there,
see that nothing happens.

636
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:22,479
But l don't wanna talk
about obvious feelings.

637
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,357
lt was right
he got one, the jerk!

638
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:32,598
We could get insulted
or injured any time.

639
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,554
lf they do what we say,
no problems, good feeling.

640
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,388
We gotta be more careful...

641
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:44,038
...opposite the prisoners.

642
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,589
Nobody comes near me any more!

643
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:48,912
The 5th day

644
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,952
What is it?

645
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,595
Oh, God. Shit, how do you look?

646
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,871
Guards, we need help!
- Not the guards!

647
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,070
No, please don't, not the guards!

648
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,470
We need someone who can help us!

649
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,395
No! They want to kill me! No!

650
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,636
You just have to go to a doctor.

651
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,718
No! Help me! l don't want to!

652
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,434
86, 23, 74, 94, 15...

653
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,836
...82, 38, 77, 40, 11 .

654
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,912
We have two losses today:

655
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:57,751
69...

656
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,997
and 53.
ln exchange we have a new cell.

657
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,396
All light- and sound-proof,
but you can get air inside.

658
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,670
l hope no-one has a problem
with enclosed spaces?

659
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,632
No, Mr Prison Guard.

660
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,789
Fine. Today is visiting day.
You may put on your good coats.

661
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:17,559
Don't get them dirty. Understood?

662
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,432
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

663
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,875
Do you get a visitor too, 82?

664
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,752
No, Mr Prison Guard.

665
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,953
Why not? Don't you have
a wife, kids, relatives?

666
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,590
No, Mr Prison Guard.

667
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:39,508
And no friends! No visitor!

668
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:48,554
"Dear Tarek, you are the only one
l can write a letter to...

669
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,750
...because you're my only friend."

670
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,669
"l hope
l can do something for you someday."

671
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,679
"You can always count
on me. Your Gunter."

672
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,072
Are you a faggot, 82?

673
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,552
Yes, 77?

674
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,955
Was that attempted assault
on a prison guard?

675
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,958
Definitely.

676
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,834
Because 77 still hasn't got the rules...

677
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,269
...he'll clean the toilet with his dress.

678
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,439
No visitors until everything
is impeccable!

679
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,632
l didn't know about that.

680
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,757
We agreed not to use the black box!

681
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,110
lt's for psychological pressure only.

682
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,030
53 and 69 are in hospital.

683
01:12:58,160 --> 01:12:59,878
82 is depressive.

684
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,230
We have extreme helplessness,
loss of sense for reality...

685
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,033
And disorientation, yes!
That's our field of research.

686
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,628
ln five days we had submission to
authority, subliminal violence...

687
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,194
...and complete de-individualisation.

688
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,920
Exactly! We achieved our goal.
Stop and present the results!

689
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,077
No! We have a stable moment.

690
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,958
So far nothing is happening
which we didn't expect.

691
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,789
There's no comparable data
anywhere in the world.

692
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,588
We have nine more days.

693
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:29,235
lf we stop now, we're giving away
the chance of a lifetime.

694
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,432
Perhaps it's a mistake.

695
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,553
l didn't realise what we were in for.

696
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,715
l have the feeling we're losing control.

697
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:48,718
Jutta, what can happen?
We can intervene any time.

698
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,397
l can no longer be responsible.
- What is that supposed to mean?

699
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,638
l'll meet the committee in three hours.
l need a clear decision from you.

700
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,718
Do you still stand behind
the project? Yes or no?

701
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:07,038
Our nude cleaning lady!

702
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,995
There's still something
sticking to the edge.

703
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,235
lt will not work like this, 77.

704
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,832
Very nice!

705
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,832
Enough!

706
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:45,232
What about the coat?
- lt's your coat, 77. Put it on!

707
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,792
On the line!

708
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,912
Very nice.

709
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,433
Let's make a good impression.
No lies and no complaints to visitors!

710
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,630
We all feel very comfortable,
don't we?

711
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:05,833
We all want to earn our money
in peace and quiet. Right?

712
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:15,632
ls that you, 77?

713
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,912
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

714
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,920
Whoever stinks gets no visitor.

715
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:29,589
All prisoners to the visiting room,
77 back to the cell!

716
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,839
l wanted to help you...

717
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,030
Then help me now!
- What?

718
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,270
My visitor, you have to
give him something from me.

719
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,470
That's impossible!
- lt's possible!

720
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,554
Go to the cafÚ
and give this to him!

721
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,750
What is it?
- Doesn't matter.

722
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,110
l can't do it when the other
guards are watching.

723
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,310
Yes, you can, Bosch. Please!

724
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,952
You don't look good!

725
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,676
How did you find me?
- l saw the contract...

726
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,516
...and talked Ziegler
into letting me take his place.

727
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,428
l live at your place.

728
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,433
How much longer will this last?
- Nine days.

729
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,915
l have to go back to Canada.

730
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,630
You can leave here any time, right?

731
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,679
Yes.

732
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,552
So, let's go!

733
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,157
There's a cafÚ above us. A guard
will give you something from me.

734
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,032
Visiting time is over!

735
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,632
Take it to Ziegler.

736
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,912
Wait for me!

737
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,792
Don't worry so much.

738
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:05,075
lt'll be alright. lt's just a game.
Tomorrow we're out.

739
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,749
l've got everything organised.
And we're gonna get the money!

740
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,837
Then we'll all drive over
to your kiosk...

741
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,315
...and drink a nice cold beer.

742
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,073
All of us.
No stress or anything.

743
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,592
l promise!

744
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,832
You're off already?

745
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,153
No. Have to make a call, private.

746
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,077
Nervous, Bosch? Got something?
- Me? No!

747
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,430
Yes, you've got something!

748
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,440
Are you the friend of Mr. Fahd?
- Yes.

749
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:22,509
You have something for me?
- No. Tarek, he changed his mind.

750
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:25,513
l guess you know
what he's talking about.

751
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,556
He didn't say anything else?
- No.

752
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:31,829
Yeah...

753
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,952
Then...

754
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,192
Thanks.
- Don't worry.

755
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,558
l'll make sure nothing happens
to him. Bye.

756
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,158
ls that necessary, Mr. Eckert?
- lt is.

757
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,909
l'm a cuddly bear. You'll find out.
We got enough time!

758
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,076
l wouldn't be sure about that.
lf it goes on like this...

759
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,952
...l can stop the experiment any time.

760
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,593
l thought only the professor
could do so.

761
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,996
He won't be back until
tomorrow. l'm responsible now.

762
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:51,750
What's up?

763
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,395
The late shift should have
taken us out for the count.

764
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,272
Your sense of time smells!

765
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,199
Something else smells here!

766
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,230
l'll summarise.

767
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,909
77 is trying to bust the experiment
with Bosch and the girl.

768
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,474
Dr Grimm threatens
to stop the whole thing.

769
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,717
And Professor Thon went away.
- What are you trying to say?

770
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:36,116
l think this is a test. How we react to
outside disturbances.

771
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,355
Nonsense!

772
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,755
77 has made trouble
from the very beginning.

773
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,552
He might even be
a calculated disturbing factor.

774
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:43,750
The asshole gets more than 4000?

775
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,234
What should we do now?

776
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,954
We seal ourselves off until
Professor Thon returns.

777
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:48,637
Cool!

778
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:52,389
We do our jobs, stick to the rules!

779
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:57,390
The rules say to react to
all events appropriately.

780
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,552
Shut your mouth!

781
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,629
Professor, Lars here. The guards
have beaten up Bosch.

782
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:55,231
And l can't reach Jutta. l don't
know what to do, it's urgent!

783
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:00,189
No connection.

784
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,715
We're going to take a little trip.

785
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,992
77 to the line!

786
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:35,910
77 and a guard attempted
to attack the penitentiary.

787
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,229
Thanks to the alertness
of the guards...

788
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:40,636
...this threat to the internal
security could be prevented.

789
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,152
The guard has been suspended
from duty. He's one of you now.

790
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,032
lnto the cell!

791
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,748
Dora was worried about you, 77.

792
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:01,193
We had a long talk.

793
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:04,395
l took her home. Nice place.

794
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:10,114
She smells so good. l'll take
care of her personally later on.

795
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:21,038
Professor Thon, this is against
the law and violates human rights!

796
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,270
I demand to abort this experiment!

797
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,989
77 into the black box!

798
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,237
This is torture!
Stop the experiment!

799
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,950
77 will stay in the black box
until his behaviour is corrected.

800
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,799
You stinking pig! You coward!

801
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,999
You dirty, rotten, shitty
fucking Nazi pig!

802
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,752
Come out!

803
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,632
Are you finished?

804
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,032
Good.

805
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,352
lnto the black box!

806
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:40,952
Look at me!

807
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:20,992
Good evening, Doctor.

808
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,755
Please call Professor Thon.

809
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:27,792
What's going on here?

810
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,272
Call him!

811
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,595
Professor Thon is unavailable.
- Nonsense!

812
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:35,075
What?
- This is just a test.

813
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:38,631
You don't fool me!
This is just a test.

814
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:42,275
No, Mr. Berus!
The experiment is over now.

815
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,992
lt has just been terminated.

816
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,031
Bring her downstairs.
- Come along, Doctor.

817
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:54,675
What do you think you're doing?

818
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,870
Come!
- Don't touch me!

819
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,712
Everything!

820
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,910
No! Give me the coat.

821
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:14,832
Undress!

822
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,272
Everything, please.

823
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:40,473
Well, Jutta, you shave your pussy!

824
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,795
Eckert, stop that! Go downstairs!

825
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:45,072
Put this on.

826
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:57,918
lt went well.

827
01:31:58,040 --> 01:32:00,554
Sometimes one just has to
remind people of simple things.

828
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:02,796
Lars here. The guards
have beaten up Bosch.

829
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:07,391
And I can't reach Jutta. I don't
know what to do, it's urgent!

830
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,552
Quickly, my car!

831
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:34,118
This mess you'll have to clean up
yourself later, 82.

832
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,715
Out, the cell belongs to the lady!

833
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,193
Listen! Whoever touches the tape...

834
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:55,675
...will be sitting next to 82.

835
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:58,030
This applies especially
to the new prisoners!

836
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:01,709
How long this state of emergency
lasts depends also on you!

837
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:08,948
Don't tell me about some stupid
test! They said no violence!

838
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,832
Stay calm!

839
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:12,868
Shit!

840
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,117
This is an emergency. We'll wait
until Professor Thon is back.

841
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,832
They want to see
if we can keep it up.

842
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,554
l just can't!

843
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:26,914
lf you want to go, go! No need
to be afraid. Think about it!

844
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:23,992
l have to speak to Mr. Fahd!
- lt's against the rules.

845
01:35:24,120 --> 01:35:26,475
l insist or l'll call the police.

846
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:32,313
Come on!
You'll see everything is okay.

847
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:36,353
l'll try to arrange a meeting
with Tarek.

848
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:40,473
But you must promise
not to tell anyone.

849
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,950
Take care of Schutte!

850
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,355
Schutte! lt'll be alright.

851
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,912
Stop it!

852
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:07,953
Unlock the cells,
let the people out! Now!

853
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,752
He's dead.

854
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:41,069
Tarek, the man is dead.

855
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:45,512
We're going out now.

856
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,919
We're going through this door.

857
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:01,989
We can't get out of here.
We don't have a key for the elevator!

858
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:04,509
They'll just beat us up!

859
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:08,315
Nonsense! What's back there?
- The basement.

860
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:11,353
Supply corridors. You can go
directly to the Medical School.

861
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,591
Be quiet please or
l'll get into trouble.

862
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:33,472
Yeah, sure.

863
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,478
lf you wait here for a moment,
l'll see if l can get Tarek.

864
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,550
Would you like a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

865
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,795
Fine.

866
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:46,196
Do you have a cell phone?
Mine's got no power.

867
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,760
Thanks, l'll make it quick.

868
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,152
No!

869
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,072
To the left!

870
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,910
We can't leave him lying there!

871
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:01,712
Bosch! You're one of us!
Stop them! That's an order!

872
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,634
You traitor pig!
l'll get you all!

873
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,152
They're breaking out! Come!

874
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,632
l'll get you!

875
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,752
The back way!

876
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:40,874
Mr. Berus, please be reasonable!
- Shut up!

877
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:44,277
Mr. Kamps, the experiment...
- Quiet! Tie them to the bars.

878
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:51,998
The others must be
in the Medical School.

879
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:55,669
There's only one way out.
They don't stand a chance.

880
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,032
Mr. Eckert, what happened here?

881
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,315
l didn't want this! l wanted...

882
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:40,992
l thought that...

883
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:05,872
Wait, Bosch!

884
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:16,792
lt's over! l have...

885
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,672
Can you hear me?

886
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,712
There you are!

887
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,350
l told you, l'll get you!

888
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,352
On the floor, hands back!

889
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:51,832
No!

890
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:20,712
Stop it!

891
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,358
Give me the gun!
lt's not real anyway!

892
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:27,076
Bitch!

893
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:37,232
The key, quick!

894
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,072
You started this!

895
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:36,638
You damned pig!
You killed Schutte!

896
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,752
Stop it.

897
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,112
lt's over!

898
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:07,669
The sad outcome:
two dead, three injured...

899
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:11,315
...among them project Ieader
Professor KIaus Thon.

900
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:14,956
ObviousIy the experiment got
out of controI after two days.

901
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:19,076
The district attorney is investigating
2 cases of suspected mansIaughter...

902
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:22,671
...and severaI cases of mistreatment
and faiIure to provide assistance.

903
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:25,030
One of the test persons
has been arrested.

904
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:28,709
The project directors wiII probabIy
have to answer to a court.

905
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,276
According to statements by one
of the scientists invoIved...

906
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,277
...the escaIation
couId've been prevented...

907
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:36,073
...by earIier aborting the experiment.
