1
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:46,791
Subjects wanted!

2
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:50,437
Profits: 4000 mark,
for a 14 day during experiment.

3
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:52,510
..in a spurious jail.

4
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,823
Crown Plaza, please.

5
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:40,427
THE EXPERIMENT

6
00:01:51,573 --> 00:01:53,343
- Take care.
- You too.

7
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:05,625
Fighting dogs, fighting dogs?
Where does someone need fighting dogs for?

8
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,438
In former days the Romans used to have fighting dogs.

9
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,458
Sorry, don't I know you?

10
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,625
Hold on, B&S, Cola, Spiegel and
don't take me wrong...

11
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,229
...Hubba Bubba, right or am I right?

12
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,604
Right.

13
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,729
Hey, now I know. Aren't you from
that booth down Aachenerstrasse?

14
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,083
And you are Tarek, right or am I right?

15
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:28,125
Yeah, that's right.

16
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,208
Yes, I know every cabdriver in this town.
Cabdriver?

17
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:31,458
I was one either some day.

18
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:41,146
Good day gentleman.

19
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:44,479
I am Doctor Grimm, the scientific
assistant of this experiment.

20
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:46,979
You all know what you are here for?
Subjects.

21
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:50,521
The experiment is painless.
There's no need for medication.

22
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:53,646
It's about group-behaviour in an
imprisoned situation.

23
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:55,938
Are we playing guards or imprisoners?

24
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,854
You are divided into groups.
The computer will decide that.

25
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:03,021
We are doing a series of tests to
examine your psychic condition.

26
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,938
First I need to make the following remark:

27
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:09,167
Participation in this experiment

28
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:13,428
means you will renounce
your private life and fundamental rights.

29
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:15,407
Does anyone have a problem with that?

30
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,719
Ok, then let's start.

31
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:55,198
Steward?
No, ground personnel.

32
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:57,178
then it's about time!

33
00:05:00,198 --> 00:05:02,386
Mr. Faahd?..
Fahd.

34
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:04,261
come with me please.

35
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:10,719
It says here you drive a cab.
Yes.

36
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:13,636
Is that your real job or just temporary?

37
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:16,344
What you mean, temporary?

38
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:18,740
I mean, do you have any job
besides driving a cab?

39
00:05:18,948 --> 00:05:19,990
No.

40
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:24,157
I'm just asking, because it says here also that
you have studied philosophy, architecture and sociology.

41
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:27,178
Yes, that is correct, it's true.....

42
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:29,053
temporarily.

43
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:33,948
Good Mr. Fahd, your moral values are almost all
within the norm and you have a good condition.

44
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:36,344
That is important,
you can during the experiment

45
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:38,948
being exposed to very extreme situations.

46
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:40,198
Extreme situations?

47
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:43,532
But you will watch over me, won't you?

48
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,907
Uhm, the experiment will be guarded 24 hours
a day by video.

49
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:51,230
So nothing will happen to me.

50
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:06,543
Oh no!
- Yes!

51
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:08,522
He lives!

52
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:11,751
You've owed me 500 for two years.

53
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:13,626
I know, you'll get it.

54
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:26,543
Sounds interesting.
They say the army is behind it.

55
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,480
With plenty of money.

56
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,293
What do you want?

57
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:39,459
Start again? Say "sorry"?
Kind of late after two years!

58
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:41,334
l was stressed.

59
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,522
You drive a taxi.

60
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:46,126
Yes.

61
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,668
And you want to be
locked up for two weeks!

62
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,647
But it's a good story.

63
00:06:53,626 --> 00:06:57,584
Ten thousand. lncluding photos.
No expenses.

64
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,251
Thanks.

65
00:07:28,522 --> 00:07:31,116
Yes?
-Hi, Fahd. l called.

66
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:34,449
l told you, don't jump on the sofa!

67
00:07:38,928 --> 00:07:41,949
1 lux, 250 by 268 pixels.

68
00:07:43,303 --> 00:07:47,158
Press right: freeze frame.
Press left: continuous motion.

69
00:07:47,262 --> 00:07:50,074
Receiver and recorder disguised
as a Walkman. The transmitter...

70
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,991
...has a range of 100 meters.

71
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:22,357
Cool.

72
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:27,565
Ready for tomorrow?
- Sure.

73
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:34,024
This is a reference test.
We'll do it again after the experiment.

74
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,336
Don't worry. It's not unpleasant.

75
00:09:25,472 --> 00:09:27,347
Don't you feel well?

76
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:29,847
It's okay.

77
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,243
Do you have a problem
with enclosed spaces?

78
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:34,222
Everything's okay, no problem.

79
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:02,555
Shit.

80
00:10:06,097 --> 00:10:07,868
Shit, shit, shit!

81
00:10:23,076 --> 00:10:24,847
Are you injured?

82
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:31,097
The light was red!
You could've died!

83
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:33,493
This is my father's car.

84
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:35,784
He'll be happy you're alive.

85
00:10:36,618 --> 00:10:39,222
I'm coming from his funeral.

86
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:41,305
What?

87
00:11:00,566 --> 00:11:02,858
Where were you going?
- To Zandvoort.

88
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:05,774
Maybe you shouldn't go there.

89
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:07,754
What?

90
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:11,504
I don't believe in coincidences.
Nothing just happens in life.

91
00:11:12,024 --> 00:11:14,524
Even the worst things somehow
make sense.

92
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:18,379
l, for example,
should no longer drive a taxi.

93
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:33,170
This will hurt a little.

94
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:37,649
Funny, it seems to be deep,
but there's no blood.

95
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:40,879
lf you're right, why is he dead?

96
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,691
What sense does that make?

97
00:11:44,524 --> 00:11:46,399
Don't know.

98
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:49,733
Worst thing is, l couldn't
talk to him anymore.

99
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,941
Didn't see him for four years,
couldn't talk to him anymore.

100
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,920
Maybe that wasn't necessary.

101
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:06,504
He was 65. He had a good life.

102
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:10,983
'Dora, be glad, he had a nice death.'

103
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,379
But I'm not glad.

104
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:19,212
I'm not here anymore.

105
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:26,399
Sometimes life doesn't go on.
That's okay.

106
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:35,452
Can l lie down somewhere?

107
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:43,056
Are you going to stay here?

108
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:48,160
Yes, I'll be next door.
- No, l mean here.

109
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:00,139
Please meet Professor Thon,
the director of this experiment.

110
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,379
Gentlemen, l would like to thank
all of you for participating.

111
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:13,879
You are brave men.

112
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,275
You laugh, but I'm serious.

113
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:19,504
The next two weeks will be
a new experience for you.

114
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,109
You'll undergo and exert pressure.

115
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:26,379
Some of you will have
no civil rights for two weeks.

116
00:14:27,317 --> 00:14:29,088
Do not forget that.

117
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:34,609
lf anyone wants to go now,
it's your last chance.

118
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,754
Your safety is number one priority.

119
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:46,275
Violence must not be used!
Whoever gets violent...

120
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:49,504
...is out of the experiment.
Is that clear?

121
00:14:50,963 --> 00:14:53,984
Fine. Would the following
gentlemen please stand up:

122
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,713
Are we prisoners or guards?

123
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,629
Please, gentlemen.

124
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,421
Guards! Cool!

125
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,296
Please put on your uniforms.

126
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,525
But we get 4000 too?

127
00:15:37,734 --> 00:15:39,609
Four? I get 8000!

128
00:15:39,817 --> 00:15:41,588
No, we have to pay.

129
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:43,879
Hands on your back, legs spread!

130
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:53,349
Gentlemen.

131
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:57,828
You are now guards
at a penitentiary.

132
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:01,369
Your job is to maintain
peace and order,

133
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,661
to make sure the rules are obeyed.

134
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:07,203
Take it seriously! The experiment
succeeds or fails with you!

135
00:16:07,411 --> 00:16:09,703
lf you don't do your job right...

136
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:14,182
...the experiment is useless
and we can stop it right now.

137
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:18,557
You don't play guards,
you are guards!

138
00:16:19,182 --> 00:16:24,599
Your first task: to explain
the situation to the prisoners.

139
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:30,536
Please turn around!

140
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:34,911
Thanks.

141
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,994
Next one, please!

142
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,015
Go over there!

143
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:43,661
Put on the dress!

144
00:16:50,432 --> 00:16:53,453
What about underwear?
- No underwear!

145
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:58,349
Can l have number 69?
- Quiet!

146
00:16:58,557 --> 00:17:00,640
I hope it's a mixed sauna!

147
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:16,057
They're crazy, women's coats!
Maybe we have to piss sitting down!

148
00:17:16,265 --> 00:17:18,140
Quiet, 69!

149
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:27,099
Let's go!

150
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:29,390
Everyone out, please!

151
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,943
Really cool!

152
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,964
The 1st day

153
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:36,984
Keep going! Everyone in line!

154
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:39,484
Is there Pay-TV?

155
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:00,734
They're nuts, look at this!

156
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:04,068
Keep going, please. Quickly!

157
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:20,526
Did you imagine this?
- No. Quite a professional slammer!

158
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:23,234
Now we're in deep shit.

159
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:34,276
Stand in a row on the marker line!

160
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:38,026
What happens now?

161
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:45,318
Prison rules. One: The prisoners
address each other by numbers only.

162
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:51,359
Two: The prisoners address
the guards as "Mr Prison Guard".

163
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:55,109
Three: At "lights out",
the prisoners must not talk.

164
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:57,401
Then we'll sing!
- Quiet!

165
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:03,130
Four: Meals are to be
eaten up completely.

166
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:05,214
Read the menu to us!

167
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:07,714
Quiet!

168
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:13,537
Five: Each order of the guards
is to be obeyed immediately.

169
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:17,599
Six: Failure to obey the rules
will result in punishment.

170
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:19,474
What kind of punishment?

171
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:24,683
We'll see about that. We're flexible.
And now cell assignments.

172
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:27,599
When l call out your number
go to the cells!

173
00:19:27,704 --> 00:19:31,662
21, 74, 86 - cell 1 .

174
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:34,995
82, 15, 94 - cell 2.

175
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:39,474
77, 69, 38 - cell 3.

176
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:41,974
53, 40, 11 - cell 4.

177
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,058
I'll warn you, l snore.
- Great.

178
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,724
You get the bottom bunk.
- Alright.

179
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:12,599
I'm Joe.
- Tarek.

180
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,933
And you?
- Thirty-eight.

181
00:20:19,474 --> 00:20:22,391
Why do you want to take
part in this experiment?

182
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:24,891
Because l think it
can be very interesting.

183
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:29,474
4000 marks is a lot of money.

184
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:34,683
You can really relax and
experience something new.

185
00:20:34,995 --> 00:20:42,079
You have to be open to ideas
and I need the money.

186
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:44,683
It might be lots of fun.

187
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:47,079
Because of the bucks.

188
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:49,058
General interest.

189
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,509
l was never in prison.

190
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:52,381
Me? No!

191
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:54,464
No.

192
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,589
No, really.

193
00:20:57,902 --> 00:21:02,798
Jeez! I'm a regular guy!

194
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:10,298
I have a kiosk, corner of
Brussels and Aachen Street.

195
00:21:10,923 --> 00:21:12,694
Executive.

196
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:16,235
I have a few people
working under me.

197
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:17,798
I'm a school teacher.

198
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,777
I perform as Elvis.

199
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:21,756
l work for an airline.

200
00:21:22,902 --> 00:21:23,735
Here's my card.

201
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,069
In seven years I was never late.

202
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:37,694
Where's the nearest cigarette machine?

203
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,339
Downstairs and to the right!

204
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,985
Hey, Elvis.

205
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:46,652
Sing something!

206
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,631
Yes, sing a song!

207
00:21:49,673 --> 00:21:51,444
When do we get to eat?

208
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,860
We're hungry!

209
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:05,506
Do you have something
against anal burning?

210
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:15,402
What do you do in real life?
- I'm an electrician. High voltage.

211
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:18,944
Them with the big cables. You?
- Taxi driver.

212
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:25,923
And you, 38?
- You ask too much, 77.

213
00:22:26,756 --> 00:22:29,360
I guess something with numbers.

214
00:22:29,569 --> 00:22:31,434
Bus driver.

215
00:22:31,746 --> 00:22:34,142
Numbers and staring straight
ahead silently, right?

216
00:22:37,163 --> 00:22:39,038
Life guard!

217
00:22:39,663 --> 00:22:41,538
Really?

218
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,975
You know this one?

219
00:22:45,496 --> 00:22:48,309
Which animal has only
one lip on the vulva?

220
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,475
Half a roasted chicken.

221
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:06,434
What do the Arabs call
a cow barn? Moobarrac!

222
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:12,163
Why do women always watch
porn films to the end?

223
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,975
They think they'll get married.

224
00:23:18,204 --> 00:23:20,809
I know one that's a bit longer.
Three guys in front of a sauna.

225
00:23:20,913 --> 00:23:25,809
One of them goes in and there is
a giant, fat woman with a huge...

226
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:18,819
Three to three!

227
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,882
Come on, you coward!

228
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:57,049
The cheese is so dry
you could smoke it.

229
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,653
I've got a kiosk, there's
always something going on.

230
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:02,248
I've got an open ear for everyone.

231
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,040
Listening you can't learn.
You're born with it.

232
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:09,748
Drink your milk, 82.
- I don't drink milk.

233
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:13,081
I get postcards from Jamaica,
Sri Lanka...

234
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:18,081
Rule number four, 82.
Consume all your food!

235
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,373
I never drink milk. I hate milk.

236
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:22,977
Go on, a rule is a rule!

237
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,269
Milk makes me sick.
- Drink. Your. Milk.

238
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,842
One to zero for us, Schutte!

239
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,425
Eat up! You have two minutes.

240
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:02,446
Back to your cells!

241
00:26:09,946 --> 00:26:11,717
Idiot!

242
00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:14,113
Is there a problem?

243
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:16,092
Away from the doors!

244
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:21,300
Now: Shut up! Bedtime!

245
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:39,946
Anyone hurt?

246
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:43,592
Quiet! Whoever talks now...

247
00:26:47,863 --> 00:26:49,738
...does push-ups.

248
00:26:51,717 --> 00:26:53,592
Good night, ladies!

249
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,446
Can you live from that?
- Sure.

250
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:19,946
You can't let them push you around!

251
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:21,405
What should I do?

252
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,905
They have to take us seriously
or we can forget it.

253
00:27:24,113 --> 00:27:28,175
If you say he has to drink
his milk, then he has to.

254
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,155
Yeah, sure.

255
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:34,936
But the Elvis number is good!
- Cool hip swing!

256
00:27:37,645 --> 00:27:41,290
My wife made that.
- No, thanks. Do you have kids?

257
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:44,311
A son, four months.

258
00:27:44,415 --> 00:27:46,811
Sweet! These are my rug rats.

259
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:50,978
Twins? Cute, too.

260
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:53,895
Can I see them as well?
- Sure.

261
00:27:55,665 --> 00:27:58,061
What about you, Berus?
- A daughter.

262
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,811
How old?
- She'll be twelve in three days.

263
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,311
Do you have a photo?

264
00:28:05,145 --> 00:28:07,124
No photo?
What kind of a father are you?

265
00:28:07,332 --> 00:28:09,103
I'm a good father!

266
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:14,936
Eckert? Do you have kids?

267
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:23,270
What's up now?

268
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:34,936
Out you come, 77.

269
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:38,582
Why?
- I said, out!

270
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:46,186
Push-ups!

271
00:28:46,811 --> 00:28:50,665
Can't you say that friendlier?
- Push-ups!

272
00:28:50,874 --> 00:28:53,270
I heard you the first time, homo.

273
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,811
Very easy - just say please once.

274
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,790
What?

275
00:28:58,895 --> 00:29:01,811
Fine, the whole cell, out!
38, 69, out!

276
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,207
Wait a sec, did you sleep
on your Superman comics?

277
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:06,811
They're not involved. Talk to me!

278
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,764
And down! Twenty!

279
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:24,197
I didn't do anything!

280
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:25,968
Remember who
you have to thank for this.

281
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:26,489
Jerk!

282
00:29:26,697 --> 00:29:28,468
And another twenty for that!

283
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,468
I had no idea
you could be so hard!

284
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,343
Great show!

285
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:38,989
Did you see that?
They're doing everything.

286
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:12,010
Get up! Out of the cells!
Line up!

287
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:14,093
The 2nd day

288
00:30:14,197 --> 00:30:15,239
Get moving!

289
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:18,260
The ladies in cell three,
sore muscles?

290
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,655
Morning.

291
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:58,770
If I installed a taxi radio
the drivers could order some meat...

292
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:01,895
...and I could have it deep fried on time.

293
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,875
Gentlemen, finish breakfast!

294
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,166
82,

295
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,145
you didn't drink your milk.

296
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:12,104
I said that I don't drink milk.

297
00:31:12,312 --> 00:31:14,395
Well, milk or push-ups.

298
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:17,833
But I'm missing some enzyme!

299
00:31:17,937 --> 00:31:21,062
Wonderful, let's do push-ups
instead of milk.

300
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,729
All together, right? Let's do
push-ups for Schutte.

301
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,500
Sure we'll do push-ups!

302
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:31,791
Excuse me, Mr. Prison Guard!

303
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:36,895
One, two, three...

304
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:40,020
...four, five, six...

305
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,562
...seven, eight, nine...

306
00:31:48,562 --> 00:31:50,333
That's clever.

307
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:56,270
What if he really is allergic to milk?
- Nonsense. The problem is 77.

308
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,604
Come on, bed check!

309
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:09,812
He really stinks!

310
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:25,125
You learn that as a lifeguard?
- The very first thing.

311
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,344
77, made your bed yet?

312
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:46,469
That's mean.

313
00:32:46,781 --> 00:32:48,865
You'll have to do it again!

314
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,510
Do it again, I said!

315
00:33:06,781 --> 00:33:09,594
I'll count to three
and the bed will be made.

316
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:11,469
And one!

317
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,552
And two!

318
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,615
And three!

319
00:33:28,448 --> 00:33:30,219
Shall I call the guards?

320
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:36,052
Jutta, quickly!

321
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:39,073
Come on, I'll help you.

322
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:41,677
We don't want to get out
of here anyway, do we?

323
00:33:44,906 --> 00:33:47,198
We want gummy bears!
And cable TV.

324
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:51,052
That's a walkie-talkie, not a phone!

325
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:53,344
What about pizza?
- Yeah, pizza.

326
00:33:54,385 --> 00:33:55,844
And porn magazines!

327
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:58,552
What about basketball?

328
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,438
Admit it! You lost!
It's just a game!

329
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,667
Here we go now, here we go now!

330
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:41,667
Piss off, cocksucker!

331
00:34:46,146 --> 00:34:49,584
Barricades, barricades!

332
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:55,417
What's going on there?
- We didn't do anything!

333
00:34:55,938 --> 00:34:57,709
In two hours they'll be exhausted.

334
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:01,667
We have to react or
they do what they want!

335
00:35:01,771 --> 00:35:03,021
77, the asshole.

336
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,563
Professor, what should we do now?

337
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,855
Bosch, that won't do any good!

338
00:35:10,105 --> 00:35:11,355
We can't use violence.

339
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:14,271
We stick together.
They're twelve, we're eight.

340
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,250
Suggestions?

341
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,875
Berus, what about you?
Don't you ever say anything?

342
00:35:22,709 --> 00:35:24,480
I once read...

343
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:26,459
What? I can't understand you.

344
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:32,292
I once read that you get
control in such a situation...

345
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:36,980
...with humiliation.

346
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:49,584
We don't want to hurt anyone,
they just have to respect us.

347
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,803
After 36 hours - it's incredible!

348
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,511
Undress!

349
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:25,511
Get up! Strip off your coats!

350
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:27,490
We give up!

351
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:37,907
Hey, they gave up!

352
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,157
Seventy-seven!

353
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:10,720
Keep calm, it's all a game, okay?
- Go, Berus!

354
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,699
Undress!

355
00:37:18,115 --> 00:37:19,886
Your hand!

356
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:29,782
And down!

357
00:37:45,814 --> 00:37:46,960
Wasn't that a bit too harsh?

358
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:49,980
No, as long as they don't say
anything up there, we're doing fine.

359
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:51,855
They do want
some action down here!

360
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:53,626
Bosch, it wasn't violence.

361
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,960
Fire extinguishers, Berus, cool.

362
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:06,335
Gentlemen, you've restored peace
and order, solved your problem.

363
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:11,022
Keep going! But please remember
to act appropriate.

364
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:15,397
Perhaps the next conflict can be
solved differently. Thank you.

365
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:02,158
This is Tarek Fahd,
leave a message after the beep.

366
00:40:48,304 --> 00:40:50,075
What happens now?

367
00:40:50,588 --> 00:40:54,440
Nothing happens. Stay calm,
that's the best strategy.

368
00:41:11,627 --> 00:41:13,398
You can get the bed.

369
00:41:38,502 --> 00:41:40,273
Get out!

370
00:41:40,484 --> 00:41:44,431
The 3rd day

371
00:41:46,931 --> 00:41:48,806
Good morning, gentlemen!

372
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:54,014
I don't think anyone wants
to repeat last night.

373
00:41:55,368 --> 00:41:58,389
We still have eleven days to go.
Suggestion:

374
00:41:58,806 --> 00:42:01,514
We stay reasonable...

375
00:42:01,826 --> 00:42:05,264
...then we all get our money
and that's it.

376
00:42:07,243 --> 00:42:10,472
Okay?
Or does anyone like stress?

377
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:15,368
Good. Is that okay, 77?

378
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,701
Yeah.

379
00:42:18,806 --> 00:42:21,306
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

380
00:42:25,785 --> 00:42:28,389
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.
- Fine.

381
00:42:35,046 --> 00:42:37,233
See! It wasn't that bad.

382
00:42:39,941 --> 00:42:43,900
82, if you have to puke,
then go to the loo.

383
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:53,796
That's the rule.
He has to drink. We can't help it.

384
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,171
We thought we'd restore
order, make them obey us.

385
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,816
So it runs smoother for us.

386
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:07,650
That we have them in our hands,
that we're at the helm again.

387
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,671
After all, it wasn't violence.

388
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,421
We'll see what happens.

389
00:43:43,171 --> 00:43:45,671
Hi, Schutte
- No names!

390
00:43:48,066 --> 00:43:51,921
Tell me, why are you doing this?

391
00:43:52,025 --> 00:43:55,254
I do it often. Guinea pig.

392
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,671
Once I got an intestinal probe.
It was worse than this here.

393
00:44:00,775 --> 00:44:04,316
The people were nicer,
but I got only 900 marks for it.

394
00:44:04,421 --> 00:44:06,608
What do you do with the money?

395
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:11,702
I've got sort of a dream.
- Yeah, what?

396
00:44:12,223 --> 00:44:16,494
No, you'll laugh at me.
- I won't laugh at you. I promise.

397
00:44:16,598 --> 00:44:20,036
A Ferrari.
- Do you know how much a Ferrari costs?

398
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:24,411
Not a new one.
l know a dealer, he likes me.

399
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:26,911
Maybe a '89
if the bank plays along.

400
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,765
Fine. But to fill her up
you'll need another loan.

401
00:44:30,973 --> 00:44:32,536
A yellow one.

402
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,661
I'd park it at my kiosk
so that everyone can see it.

403
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:38,265
I dreamed of it all my life.

404
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:41,181
It's important to have a dream.

405
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:45,452
I read that somewhere.
It's true. What's your dream?

406
00:45:03,056 --> 00:45:05,661
Does anyone have drugs here?
I think this is a jail!

407
00:45:05,765 --> 00:45:08,994
Keep your trap shut today, 77!
- What do you want?

408
00:45:09,098 --> 00:45:10,452
Kiss my ass!

409
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:13,994
Mr Prison Guard Berus,
I've got a question.

410
00:45:17,744 --> 00:45:21,806
That number yesterday,
could it be that it turned you on a bit?

411
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:25,556
I think I saw it clearly.
Did you fuck your wife hard at home?

412
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:29,202
Shut up, you idiot!
- Or don't you have a wife?

413
00:45:29,411 --> 00:45:31,181
Could be.

414
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:34,306
Ground staff, right? You're all gay!

415
00:45:35,244 --> 00:45:37,640
And Mr Prison Guard,
there's something else.

416
00:45:38,265 --> 00:45:40,036
You smell a bit strong.

417
00:45:41,181 --> 00:45:44,931
Yes! Has anyone ever told you
that you stink, man!

418
00:45:48,473 --> 00:45:50,346
There's something
that people call soap.

419
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:54,192
If you'd use it you wouldn't
stink anymore. Although -

420
00:45:55,026 --> 00:45:57,734
I reckon for some people
even that doesn't work.

421
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,546
Shut up!
- Yeah, hit me, girlie!

422
00:46:01,276 --> 00:46:03,359
Hit me and you're out of here!

423
00:46:08,984 --> 00:46:14,088
No, you won't hit me.
You're really hot for this job here!

424
00:46:14,192 --> 00:46:15,546
Tarek, stop it!

425
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:20,338
Don't spoil it! There's so much
more you could do with us!

426
00:46:23,776 --> 00:46:25,546
What's going on here?

427
00:46:30,442 --> 00:46:34,296
Nothing. 77 is going back to his cell.

428
00:47:09,296 --> 00:47:11,171
Not bad.

429
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:15,338
Give me that!

430
00:47:15,442 --> 00:47:17,630
What are they paying for the story?

431
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:24,192
Phase 3: Prisoner attacks prisoner.
You're pushing it on purpose!

432
00:47:24,401 --> 00:47:25,755
Kiss my ass!

433
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:27,526
They pay more if it really gets wild!

434
00:47:27,734 --> 00:47:32,307
And what are you doing here,
soldier?! Name, rank, outfit!

435
00:47:33,245 --> 00:47:35,432
Come on, you can't fool me!

436
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:44,495
Steinhoff, Air Force, Major.

437
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:47,828
Pilot?
- Yes. Who are you working for?

438
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:50,745
'Reporter'. What else
is going to happen?

439
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:54,391
They're going to provoke
a series of stress situations.

440
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:57,411
What is your job?
- Observe and report.

441
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:00,016
And not let myself be manipulated.

442
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,786
So that's it.

443
00:48:01,891 --> 00:48:04,078
Yes, that's the way it is.

444
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:04,391
86,

445
00:49:04,495 --> 00:49:06,995
...21, 74, 94, 15, 82...

446
00:49:07,099 --> 00:49:10,120
...38, 77, 69, 53, 40, 11 .

447
00:49:10,326 --> 00:49:13,860
Whoever talks now sleeps in the
yard without a blanket. Clear?

448
00:49:14,068 --> 00:49:15,839
Dismissed.

449
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,610
Surprise!

450
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:25,110
We can't do that!

451
00:49:25,631 --> 00:49:27,401
What do we have here?

452
00:49:27,818 --> 00:49:30,214
Guys! It's just to warm up!

453
00:49:31,047 --> 00:49:33,547
Sorry, l wanted to ask if
I could go a bit earlier today.

454
00:49:33,651 --> 00:49:36,776
l thought we'll deal with 77!
- Yeah, I know.

455
00:49:36,985 --> 00:49:41,568
What "I know"? No, Bosch!
"When?"... then everyone.

456
00:49:41,881 --> 00:49:43,026
Yes.

457
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,401
I brought something else!

458
00:49:49,068 --> 00:49:52,818
Are you crazy?
- It's only a gas gun with blanks.

459
00:50:10,735 --> 00:50:13,860
Dennis, it's me.
I'm not selling the house.

460
00:50:14,276 --> 00:50:16,464
I have to go back to Cologne.
I'll call you.

461
00:50:32,714 --> 00:50:34,485
You got along well, didn't you?

462
00:50:36,047 --> 00:50:40,110
He was the most clever person
I've ever known. Showed me everything.

463
00:50:43,026 --> 00:50:44,797
Ain't easy having such a father.

464
00:50:47,193 --> 00:50:48,964
My father...

465
00:50:51,454 --> 00:50:53,225
...is an asshole.

466
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:57,808
The greatest asshole in the world.

467
00:50:59,162 --> 00:51:01,037
We had this little game.

468
00:51:02,704 --> 00:51:05,725
He said don't do that and I did it.

469
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,079
What?

470
00:51:07,287 --> 00:51:09,058
Everything. Always.

471
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:12,287
He's a photographer.

472
00:51:14,162 --> 00:51:18,954
When I was eight he locked me
in his darkroom. For a whole day.

473
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:21,246
l was really afraid in there.

474
00:51:22,183 --> 00:51:25,204
I cried, whined, begged for hours.

475
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:30,933
My mother didn't dare to let me out.

476
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:34,266
At some point...

477
00:51:35,621 --> 00:51:39,058
...I didn't have the strength
to scream any more.

478
00:51:41,558 --> 00:51:44,058
Then everything got really quiet.

479
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:52,496
I thought I was going to die.

480
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,121
But I only pissed my pants.

481
00:53:05,298 --> 00:53:07,277
Fasten your seat belt, sweetie!

482
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:10,611
You stupid little asshole!
You think you're smart!

483
00:53:11,131 --> 00:53:12,902
No cameras!

484
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:16,236
We're all alone here.
- We just want to talk to you.

485
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,986
You're not saying anything!

486
00:53:22,173 --> 00:53:24,361
Make sure to leave no marks!

487
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:27,590
How sweet he can look!

488
00:53:27,694 --> 00:53:29,986
I'm not sure if
I should hit him or fuck him!

489
00:53:31,548 --> 00:53:33,319
Enough!

490
00:53:50,506 --> 00:53:52,694
Sit still or it's gonna hurt!

491
00:53:59,048 --> 00:54:00,194
Give it to me!

492
00:54:00,298 --> 00:54:03,111
Do it properly! Got to look right.

493
00:54:19,038 --> 00:54:22,371
lf it's gonna be cold,
we'll knit you a cap.

494
00:54:28,413 --> 00:54:30,913
You will no longer
endanger the experiment.

495
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,767
We'll say you applied for release,
then you're out by tomorrow.

496
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:37,267
We don't want you any more.
- Did you get that, 77?

497
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:40,496
Hey, dickhead!
- Let me hear you understood, 77!

498
00:54:40,601 --> 00:54:43,101
I understand.
- Say it right!

499
00:54:43,517 --> 00:54:45,288
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

500
00:54:53,517 --> 00:54:56,330
I've got to piss.
- Did it hurt?

501
00:54:59,871 --> 00:55:02,267
I think I have to piss, too.

502
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,059
Well, who stinks now?

503
00:55:46,226 --> 00:55:48,621
You can sing him a lullaby, Bosch.

504
00:56:26,945 --> 00:56:29,653
You asked the guards?
- Yes.

505
00:56:29,757 --> 00:56:30,382
The 4th day

506
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:33,195
Why?
- It itched.

507
00:56:34,236 --> 00:56:36,007
How do you feel?

508
00:56:38,299 --> 00:56:40,174
Fine, thank you.

509
00:56:40,695 --> 00:56:43,403
You made an application?
- What kind of application?

510
00:56:43,611 --> 00:56:47,882
The guards told us that you
would like to leave, Mr. Fahd.

511
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:52,674
That's complete nonsense.

512
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:08,507
Listen! 77 has decided to
stay with us, to our great joy.

513
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:13,299
Now: if 77 gets out of line
everyone has to pay for it!

514
00:57:14,861 --> 00:57:16,528
I don't hear anything.

515
00:57:16,736 --> 00:57:18,507
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

516
00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:24,028
You're so stupid.

517
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:26,216
I'm getting out of here,
but not this way.

518
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,091
What's your plan?

519
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,988
Head down, 94!
Chin to your chest!

520
00:58:40,676 --> 00:58:45,155
No lies, no dirty words!
We'll read each letter.

521
00:59:11,812 --> 00:59:13,582
Why aren't you writing?

522
00:59:15,978 --> 00:59:18,687
Who to?
- Your pals from the kiosk.

523
00:59:21,082 --> 00:59:22,749
I just made all that up.

524
00:59:22,957 --> 00:59:27,228
I don't have any pals. I might know
what they smoke, but...

525
00:59:27,437 --> 00:59:29,207
Don't talk, write!

526
00:59:31,395 --> 00:59:33,582
...I don't really know them.

527
00:59:35,978 --> 00:59:38,582
Write: Bilker Strasse 278,

528
00:59:38,687 --> 00:59:40,145
50300 Cologne.

529
00:59:40,249 --> 00:59:42,020
Are you gonna be quiet there?

530
00:59:43,374 --> 00:59:45,145
Write to me!

531
00:59:52,957 --> 00:59:56,499
From there on there are no cameras.
- And you didn't see any of that?

532
00:59:56,603 --> 00:59:58,062
I was changing the tapes.

533
00:59:58,166 --> 01:00:00,041
Someone always has to watch!

534
01:00:00,457 --> 01:00:03,895
I don't like it. A serious
assault on the fourth day!

535
01:00:03,999 --> 01:00:07,645
It's the power struggle between
Berus and 77, as expected.

536
01:00:07,749 --> 01:00:11,187
The lock in the basement door
has to be changed!

537
01:00:12,645 --> 01:00:14,103
Put the letters into the envelopes.

538
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,978
And don't seal them.

539
01:00:45,874 --> 01:00:49,207
Just a moment! 77, step out!

540
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:57,010
You're not interested in
writing letters?

541
01:00:57,322 --> 01:01:00,760
So it was your last one!
Back in line!

542
01:01:01,593 --> 01:01:03,260
Turn left!

543
01:01:03,364 --> 01:01:05,239
Now the song!

544
01:01:19,406 --> 01:01:23,052
Whoever doesn't know the words
by tomorrow really has it coming!

545
01:01:25,864 --> 01:01:27,531
Dismissed.

546
01:01:34,093 --> 01:01:35,135
Thanks.

547
01:01:35,343 --> 01:01:39,302
You want to bust it? Maybe the
others just want their money!

548
01:01:40,968 --> 01:01:43,156
You think what's happening
here is okay?

549
01:01:43,364 --> 01:01:45,239
That's not the point.

550
01:01:45,447 --> 01:01:48,468
I can't manage it by myself.
You're the only one I can ask.

551
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:50,760
Are you going to help me, pilot?

552
01:01:53,052 --> 01:01:55,031
Are you going to help me, Steinhoff?
- No.

553
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:57,010
Go fuck yourself.
- You too.

554
01:01:57,114 --> 01:02:00,968
You're a soldier! Embarrassing,
if you broke it off!

555
01:02:01,072 --> 01:02:02,635
I reject any escalation.
- But you forgot one thing:

556
01:02:02,739 --> 01:02:06,697
It's not a war, it's a simulation!
- Is it?

557
01:02:08,989 --> 01:02:11,385
You always do what they tell you!

558
01:02:11,697 --> 01:02:14,718
You really think Berus
wanted to get rid of you?

559
01:02:14,927 --> 01:02:19,093
He wanted to see if you'd come back.
You did what they expected you to do.

560
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:22,843
You're endangering the whole
group. So l won't help you.

561
01:02:23,052 --> 01:02:24,822
Let me out!

562
01:02:26,802 --> 01:02:28,052
What's wrong with you? Stay calm!

563
01:02:28,156 --> 01:02:31,792
From now on 69 is called Sissy.

564
01:02:32,521 --> 01:02:34,292
Calm down!

565
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:35,646
13,...

566
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,521
14, 15...

567
01:02:37,729 --> 01:02:41,687
It's only an experiment, a joke!
You apply, tomorrow you're out!

568
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,021
You want to leave us?

569
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:48,146
Yes, it's too much for me.

570
01:02:48,562 --> 01:02:52,417
You know you won't get paid?
- Yes.

571
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:57,104
But you said you did it
because of the money?

572
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:58,562
That's right.

573
01:02:58,667 --> 01:03:01,479
And now you don't care
about the money any more?

574
01:03:01,687 --> 01:03:03,250
I want to go!

575
01:03:03,354 --> 01:03:05,750
Mr. Maier, how do you feel now?

576
01:03:06,687 --> 01:03:07,625
I want out!

577
01:03:07,729 --> 01:03:10,542
l couldn't live without cigarettes.

578
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:34,812
What if we decided
not to release you?

579
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:39,500
But l can go at any time!
You said it's voluntary!

580
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,521
Or isn't it?

581
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:45,437
Tomorrow we'll let you know
our decision.

582
01:03:45,854 --> 01:03:47,417
Tomorrow?

583
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:52,729
I'm not going back in there.
I want to go now!

584
01:04:18,448 --> 01:04:21,261
Klaus? This man worries me.

585
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:26,886
No, he's only faking.

586
01:04:27,615 --> 01:04:29,177
The man has had it!

587
01:05:50,115 --> 01:05:51,876
SlSSY

588
01:05:54,272 --> 01:05:56,147
Sixty-nine!

589
01:05:57,397 --> 01:05:59,272
Leave me alone, damn it!

590
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:15,730
What the hell am I doing here?

591
01:06:20,105 --> 01:06:22,605
What's the matter there?
- Number 53 doesn't feel well!

592
01:06:22,709 --> 01:06:24,584
Guards!
- Guards!

593
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:29,063
I want out!

594
01:07:13,855 --> 01:07:16,667
The man has a serious concussion.
Berus hit him in cold blood.

595
01:07:16,876 --> 01:07:20,522
He acted his role. But I don't
approve of the accident.

596
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:23,230
If we don't take Berus out,
we are forcing the escalation.

597
01:07:23,334 --> 01:07:25,834
Intervention, yes.
That was our approach.

598
01:07:25,938 --> 01:07:27,397
This is going too far!

599
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:30,618
We need 77, we need Berus.
These are dynamic factors.

600
01:07:30,824 --> 01:07:34,782
If we take Berus out, it means
aborting. Do you want that?

601
01:07:53,324 --> 01:07:56,762
If I see you hit a prisoner again,
you're out.

602
01:07:57,387 --> 01:08:01,137
That was necessary to restore
peace and order in the prison.

603
01:08:01,345 --> 01:08:05,407
Don't tell me how to do my job.
If there are problems...

604
01:08:05,512 --> 01:08:08,116
...I want to hear it from
Professor Thon personally.

605
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,095
Good day, Doctor.

606
01:08:46,762 --> 01:08:49,157
What? l can't understand you!

607
01:08:54,991 --> 01:08:56,657
You have to speak louder, Dora.
I can't hear you.

608
01:09:28,835 --> 01:09:30,606
Hold your breath!

609
01:09:33,731 --> 01:09:37,793
This is a panic attack.
lf you hyperventilate you'll pass out.

610
01:09:40,814 --> 01:09:42,689
Breathe slowly, calm down.

611
01:09:44,981 --> 01:09:49,356
Never had anything like that before.
- Sit down. Real slow.

612
01:09:51,335 --> 01:09:52,168
Everything all right?

613
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:57,793
It's fine. It's a joke.
Everything's just a game.

614
01:09:57,897 --> 01:09:59,772
That's your mistake!
You're lost with that attitude.

615
01:09:59,981 --> 01:10:02,064
It's never a game, understand that!

616
01:10:04,981 --> 01:10:06,752
What do they know about you?

617
01:10:07,377 --> 01:10:08,314
No idea.

618
01:10:18,522 --> 01:10:20,293
What are you looking at?

619
01:10:23,106 --> 01:10:24,877
Do I look like shit?

620
01:10:27,481 --> 01:10:29,252
I've got Dumbo ears, right?

621
01:10:31,335 --> 01:10:33,210
You asshole!

622
01:10:43,627 --> 01:10:45,502
What are you going to do
when you're out?

623
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:47,168
Fly away!

624
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:17,367
Are you going to help me now?

625
01:11:18,512 --> 01:11:20,387
I can't!

626
01:11:25,596 --> 01:11:28,617
Okay 69, time's up,
back to your cell!

627
01:11:32,992 --> 01:11:34,762
Move it!

628
01:11:45,492 --> 01:11:47,262
I'm scared shitless.

629
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:49,971
I keep my mouth shut.

630
01:11:50,075 --> 01:11:51,742
I don't wanna...

631
01:11:53,617 --> 01:11:58,096
get beaten up in there.

632
01:11:58,408 --> 01:12:02,679
Did you see that on video?

633
01:12:02,887 --> 01:12:06,117
He hit him really hard!

634
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:07,262
Is the man ok?

635
01:12:07,471 --> 01:12:11,637
I'll still go in there,
see that nothing happens.

636
01:12:11,846 --> 01:12:17,262
But I don't wanna talk
about obvious feelings.

637
01:12:20,075 --> 01:12:23,408
It was right
he got one, the jerk!

638
01:12:23,512 --> 01:12:27,783
We could get insulted
or injured any time.

639
01:12:27,992 --> 01:12:31,940
If they do what we say,
no problems, it's a good feeling.

640
01:12:32,357 --> 01:12:34,857
We gotta be more careful...

641
01:12:36,836 --> 01:12:39,752
...opposite the prisoners.

642
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:42,357
Nobody comes near me any more!

643
01:12:42,982 --> 01:12:44,857
The 5th day

644
01:12:59,752 --> 01:13:01,523
What is it?

645
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:04,232
Oh, God. Shit, how do you look?

646
01:13:06,627 --> 01:13:08,711
Guards, we need help!
- Not the guards!

647
01:13:08,919 --> 01:13:11,002
No, please don't, not the guards!

648
01:13:13,294 --> 01:13:15,586
We need someone who can help us!

649
01:13:16,315 --> 01:13:18,607
No! They want to kill me! No!

650
01:13:18,815 --> 01:13:21,002
You just have to go to a doctor.

651
01:13:21,107 --> 01:13:24,232
No! Help me! I don't want to!

652
01:13:46,419 --> 01:13:48,919
86, 23, 74, 94, 15...

653
01:13:49,023 --> 01:13:52,461
...82, 38, 77, 40, 11 .

654
01:13:52,773 --> 01:13:54,648
We have two losses today:

655
01:13:55,794 --> 01:13:56,523
69...

656
01:13:56,627 --> 01:13:59,857
and 53.
In exchange we have a new cell.

657
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:03,398
All light- and sound-proof,
but you can get air inside.

658
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:05,794
I hope no-one has a problem
with enclosed spaces?

659
01:14:07,044 --> 01:14:08,919
No, Mr Prison Guard.

660
01:14:09,232 --> 01:14:14,222
Fine. Today is visiting day.
You may put on your good coats.

661
01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:17,138
Don't get them dirty. Understood?

662
01:14:17,242 --> 01:14:19,117
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

663
01:14:21,305 --> 01:14:23,701
Do you get a visitor too, 82?

664
01:14:27,138 --> 01:14:28,805
No, Mr Prison Guard.

665
01:14:28,909 --> 01:14:33,180
Why not? Don't you have
a wife, kids, relatives?

666
01:14:33,805 --> 01:14:35,888
No, Mr Prison Guard.

667
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:40,055
And no friends! No visitor!

668
01:14:44,117 --> 01:14:49,430
"Dear Tarek, you are the only one
I can write a letter to...

669
01:14:49,534 --> 01:14:51,722
...because you're my only friend."

670
01:14:52,242 --> 01:14:54,742
"I hope
I can do something for you someday."

671
01:14:54,951 --> 01:14:58,909
"You can always count
on me. Your Gunter."

672
01:14:59,742 --> 01:15:01,400
Are you a faggot, 82?

673
01:15:04,317 --> 01:15:06,088
Yes, 77?

674
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:17,963
Was that attempted assault
on a prison guard?

675
01:15:18,275 --> 01:15:20,046
Definitely.

676
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:24,108
Because 77 still hasn't got the rules...

677
01:15:24,213 --> 01:15:26,608
...he'll clean the toilet with his dress.

678
01:15:26,817 --> 01:15:30,983
No visitors until everything
is impeccable!

679
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,775
I didn't know about that.

680
01:15:53,265 --> 01:15:55,244
We agreed not to use the black box!

681
01:15:55,348 --> 01:15:57,744
It's for psychological pressure only.

682
01:15:59,619 --> 01:16:01,807
53 and 69 are in the hospital.

683
01:16:01,911 --> 01:16:03,682
82 is depressive.

684
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:06,182
We have extreme helplessness,
loss of sense for reality...

685
01:16:06,286 --> 01:16:09,098
And disorientation, yes!
That's our field of research.

686
01:16:09,203 --> 01:16:11,807
In five days we had submission to
authority, subliminal violence...

687
01:16:11,911 --> 01:16:14,411
...and complete de-individualization.

688
01:16:14,619 --> 01:16:17,328
Exactly! We achieved our goal.
Stop and present the results!

689
01:16:17,432 --> 01:16:20,557
No! We have a stable moment.

690
01:16:21,703 --> 01:16:24,723
So far nothing is happening
that we didn't expect.

691
01:16:24,828 --> 01:16:28,682
There's no comparable data
anywhere in the world.

692
01:16:29,307 --> 01:16:30,557
We have nine more days.

693
01:16:30,765 --> 01:16:34,411
If we stop now, we're giving away
the chance of a lifetime.

694
01:16:40,036 --> 01:16:41,911
Perhaps it's a mistake.

695
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:47,223
I didn't realize what we were in for.

696
01:16:48,057 --> 01:16:50,557
I have the feeling we're losing control.

697
01:16:51,598 --> 01:16:54,723
Jutta, what can happen?
We can intervene at any time.

698
01:16:56,286 --> 01:16:59,515
I can no longer be responsible.
- What is that supposed to mean?

699
01:16:59,723 --> 01:17:03,994
I'll meet the committee in three hours.
I need a clear answer from you.

700
01:17:04,098 --> 01:17:07,223
Do you still stand behind
the project? Yes or no?

701
01:17:12,119 --> 01:17:13,786
Our nude cleaning lady!

702
01:17:17,536 --> 01:17:19,932
There's still something
sticking to the edge.

703
01:17:23,994 --> 01:17:26,494
It will not work like this, 77.

704
01:17:32,526 --> 01:17:34,401
Very nice!

705
01:17:38,776 --> 01:17:40,651
Enough!

706
01:17:49,193 --> 01:17:53,568
What about the coat?
- It's your coat, 77. Put it on!

707
01:17:55,443 --> 01:17:57,213
On the line!

708
01:17:57,630 --> 01:17:59,505
Very nice.

709
01:18:02,213 --> 01:18:06,276
Let's make a good impression.
No lies and no complaints to visitors!

710
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:08,568
We all feel very comfortable,
don't we?

711
01:18:09,505 --> 01:18:15,026
We all want to earn our money
in peace and quiet. Right?

712
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:25,234
Is that you, 77?

713
01:18:27,838 --> 01:18:29,713
Yes, Mr Prison Guard.

714
01:18:31,172 --> 01:18:33,880
Anyone who stinks gets no visitor.

715
01:18:36,068 --> 01:18:39,713
All prisoners to the visiting room,
77 back to the cell!

716
01:19:50,433 --> 01:19:51,891
I wanted to help you...

717
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:54,183
Then help me now!
- What?

718
01:19:55,433 --> 01:19:57,516
My visitor, you have to
give him something from me.

719
01:19:57,724 --> 01:19:59,808
That's impossible!
- It's possible!

720
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:03,037
Go to the café
and give this to him!

721
01:20:03,141 --> 01:20:05,328
What is it?
- Doesn't matter.

722
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:07,828
I can't do it while the other
guards are watching.

723
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:10,120
Yes, you can, Bosch. Please!

724
01:20:35,016 --> 01:20:36,787
You don't look good!

725
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:42,724
How did you find me?
- I saw the contract...

726
01:20:43,349 --> 01:20:46,787
...and talked Ziegler
into letting me take his place.

727
01:20:48,245 --> 01:20:50,839
I live at your place.

728
01:20:53,131 --> 01:20:56,048
How much longer will this last?
- Nine days.

729
01:20:56,152 --> 01:20:58,652
I have to go back to Canada.

730
01:21:00,318 --> 01:21:02,506
You can leave here whenever, right?

731
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:05,631
Yes.

732
01:21:05,839 --> 01:21:07,610
So, let's go!

733
01:21:20,631 --> 01:21:23,860
There's a café above us. A guard
will give you something from me.

734
01:21:23,964 --> 01:21:25,839
Visiting time is over!

735
01:21:27,714 --> 01:21:29,589
Take it to Ziegler.

736
01:21:35,318 --> 01:21:37,193
Wait for me!

737
01:22:16,881 --> 01:22:18,652
Don't worry so much.

738
01:22:20,423 --> 01:22:24,173
It'll be alright. It's just a game.
Tomorrow we're out.

739
01:22:24,381 --> 01:22:28,027
I've got everything organized.
And we're gonna get the money!

740
01:22:29,798 --> 01:22:34,371
Then we'll all drive over
to your kiosk...

741
01:22:34,475 --> 01:22:36,975
...and drink a nice cold beer.

742
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:40,829
All of us.
No stress or anything.

743
01:22:43,746 --> 01:22:45,517
I promise!

744
01:23:09,058 --> 01:23:10,933
You're off already?

745
01:23:11,558 --> 01:23:14,371
No. Have to make a call, private.

746
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:18,433
Nervous, Bosch? Got something?
- Me? No!

747
01:23:19,683 --> 01:23:21,975
Yes, you've got something!

748
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:39,683
Are you the friend of Mr. Fahd?
- Yes.

749
01:23:39,788 --> 01:23:44,996
You have something for me?
- No. Tarek, he changed his mind.

750
01:23:45,308 --> 01:23:48,121
I guess you know
what he's talking about.

751
01:23:49,267 --> 01:23:51,246
He didn't say anything else?
- No.

752
01:23:53,538 --> 01:23:54,683
Yeah...

753
01:23:56,142 --> 01:23:57,913
Then...

754
01:24:00,517 --> 01:24:02,288
Thanks.
- Don't worry.

755
01:24:02,808 --> 01:24:05,829
I'll make sure nothing happens
to him. Bye.

756
01:24:35,715 --> 01:24:38,736
Is that necessary, Mr. Eckert?
- It is.

757
01:24:41,028 --> 01:24:44,778
I'm a cuddly bear. You'll find out.
We've got enough time!

758
01:24:44,882 --> 01:24:46,965
I wouldn't be sure about that.
If it goes on like this...

759
01:24:47,173 --> 01:24:48,944
...I can stop the experiment any time.

760
01:24:49,048 --> 01:24:50,611
I thought only the professor
could do so.

761
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:54,153
He won't be back until
tomorrow. I'm responsible now.

762
01:25:17,069 --> 01:25:17,903
What's up?

763
01:25:18,007 --> 01:25:21,653
The late shift should have
taken us out for the count.

764
01:25:21,861 --> 01:25:23,632
Your sense of time stinks!

765
01:25:25,298 --> 01:25:26,653
Something else stinks here!

766
01:25:49,778 --> 01:25:50,705
I'll summarize.

767
01:25:50,809 --> 01:25:54,559
77 is trying to bust the experiment
with Bosch and the girl.

768
01:25:54,663 --> 01:25:57,163
Dr Grimm is threatening
to stop the whole thing.

769
01:25:57,372 --> 01:26:00,601
And Professor Thon went away.
- What are you trying to say?

770
01:26:00,705 --> 01:26:04,143
I think this is a test. How we react to
outside disturbances.

771
01:26:04,247 --> 01:26:05,393
Nonsense!

772
01:26:05,497 --> 01:26:07,893
77 has made trouble
from the very beginning.

773
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:09,768
He might even be
a calculated disturbing factor.

774
01:26:09,872 --> 01:26:12,059
The asshole gets more than 4000?

775
01:26:12,372 --> 01:26:13,622
What should we do now?

776
01:26:13,726 --> 01:26:16,434
We seal ourselves off until
Professor Thon returns.

777
01:26:16,538 --> 01:26:17,163
Cool!

778
01:26:17,268 --> 01:26:21,018
We do our jobs, stick to the rules!

779
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:26,226
The rules say to react to
all events appropriately.

780
01:27:08,413 --> 01:27:10,184
Shut your mouth!

781
01:27:19,351 --> 01:27:21,747
Professor, Lars here. The guards
have beaten up Bosch.

782
01:27:21,851 --> 01:27:26,538
And I can't reach Jutta. l don't
know what to do, it's urgent!

783
01:27:30,592 --> 01:27:31,633
No connection.

784
01:27:32,883 --> 01:27:35,383
We're going to take a little trip.

785
01:27:56,737 --> 01:27:58,508
77 to the line!

786
01:28:03,924 --> 01:28:08,924
77 and a guard attempted
to attack the penitentiary.

787
01:28:09,133 --> 01:28:10,278
Thanks to the alertness
of the guards...

788
01:28:10,383 --> 01:28:13,820
...this threat to the internal
security was prevented.

789
01:28:14,237 --> 01:28:18,508
The guard has been suspended
from duty. He's one of you now.

790
01:28:22,778 --> 01:28:24,653
Into the cell!

791
01:28:29,028 --> 01:28:31,633
Dora was worried about you, 77.

792
01:28:32,258 --> 01:28:35,174
We had a long talk.

793
01:28:36,112 --> 01:28:38,508
I took her home. Nice place.

794
01:28:39,341 --> 01:28:44,549
She smells so good. I'll take
care of her personally later on.

795
01:28:51,424 --> 01:28:55,903
Professor Thon, this is against
the law and violates human rights!

796
01:28:56,112 --> 01:28:58,195
I demand to abort this experiment!

797
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,966
77 into the black box!

798
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:03,403
This is torture!
Stop the experiment!

799
01:29:03,612 --> 01:29:07,258
77 will stay in the black box
until his behavior is corrected.

800
01:29:07,362 --> 01:29:10,174
You stinking pig! You coward!

801
01:29:10,582 --> 01:29:14,539
You dirty, rotten, shitty
fucking Nazi pig!

802
01:29:15,685 --> 01:29:17,456
Come out!

803
01:29:28,081 --> 01:29:29,956
Are you finished?

804
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:34,539
Good.

805
01:29:51,831 --> 01:29:53,602
Into the black box!

806
01:31:19,946 --> 01:31:21,717
Look at me!

807
01:34:06,594 --> 01:34:08,364
Good evening, Doctor.

808
01:34:08,885 --> 01:34:11,271
Please call Professor Thon.

809
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:15,438
What's going on here?

810
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:18,042
Call him!

811
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:20,438
Professor Thon is unavailable.
- Nonsense!

812
01:34:20,646 --> 01:34:23,042
What?
- This is just a test.

813
01:34:23,459 --> 01:34:26,792
You don't fool me!
This is just a test.

814
01:34:26,896 --> 01:34:30,542
No, Mr. Berus!
The experiment is over now.

815
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:32,313
It has just been terminated.

816
01:34:38,667 --> 01:34:40,750
Bring her downstairs.
- Come along, Doctor.

817
01:34:42,521 --> 01:34:43,459
What do you think you're doing?

818
01:34:43,667 --> 01:34:45,750
Come!
- Don't touch me!

819
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:00,229
Everything!

820
01:35:00,334 --> 01:35:02,521
No! Give me the coat.

821
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:04,500
Undress!

822
01:35:14,604 --> 01:35:16,375
Everything, please.

823
01:35:28,354 --> 01:35:31,167
Well, Jutta, you shave your pussy!

824
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:33,563
Eckert, stop that! Go downstairs!

825
01:35:34,188 --> 01:35:35,959
Put this on.

826
01:35:47,834 --> 01:35:49,500
It went well.

827
01:35:49,604 --> 01:35:52,199
Sometimes one just has to
remind people of simple things.

828
01:35:52,303 --> 01:35:54,490
Lars here. The guards
have beaten up Bosch.

829
01:35:54,699 --> 01:35:59,282
And I can't reach Jutta. I don't
know what to do, it's urgent!

830
01:36:10,219 --> 01:36:11,990
Quickly, my car!

831
01:36:24,282 --> 01:36:27,199
You'll have to clean this mess up
yourself later, 82.

832
01:36:29,490 --> 01:36:31,990
Out, the cell belongs to the lady!

833
01:36:42,928 --> 01:36:46,990
Listen! Whoever touches the tape...

834
01:36:47,199 --> 01:36:49,594
...will be sitting next to 82.

835
01:36:49,803 --> 01:36:52,094
This applies especially
to the new prisoners!

836
01:36:52,199 --> 01:36:55,949
How long this state of emergency
lasts depends also on you!

837
01:38:00,730 --> 01:38:05,939
Don't tell me about some stupid
test! They said no violence!

838
01:38:06,043 --> 01:38:07,918
Stay calm!

839
01:38:08,751 --> 01:38:10,001
Shit!

840
01:38:10,209 --> 01:38:13,439
This is an emergency. We'll wait
until Professor Thon is back.

841
01:38:13,543 --> 01:38:15,209
They want to see
if we can keep it up.

842
01:38:15,314 --> 01:38:18,022
I just can't!

843
01:38:19,376 --> 01:38:24,689
If you want to go, go! No need
to be afraid. Think about it!

844
01:39:21,033 --> 01:39:24,054
I have to speak to Mr. Fahd!
- It's against the rules.

845
01:39:24,262 --> 01:39:26,658
I insist or I'll call the police.

846
01:39:29,991 --> 01:39:32,804
Come on!
You'll see that everything is okay.

847
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:36,970
I'll try to arrange a meeting
with Tarek.

848
01:39:38,533 --> 01:39:41,241
But you must promise
not to tell anyone.

849
01:41:42,481 --> 01:41:44,669
Take care of Schutte!

850
01:41:46,856 --> 01:41:49,252
Schutte! It'll be alright.

851
01:42:06,752 --> 01:42:08,627
Stop it!

852
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:14,877
Unlock the cells,
let the people out! Now!

853
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,971
He's dead.

854
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:49,450
Tarek, the man is dead.

855
01:42:52,263 --> 01:42:54,138
We're going out now.

856
01:43:05,492 --> 01:43:07,054
We're going through this door.

857
01:43:07,367 --> 01:43:11,221
We can't get out of here.
We don't have a key for the elevator!

858
01:43:11,429 --> 01:43:13,929
They'll just beat us up!

859
01:43:14,034 --> 01:43:17,888
Nonsense! What's back there?
- The basement.

860
01:43:18,096 --> 01:43:21,013
Supply corridors. You can go
directly to the Medical School.

861
01:43:40,075 --> 01:43:42,054
Be quiet please or
I'll get in trouble.

862
01:43:42,263 --> 01:43:44,034
Yeah, sure.

863
01:43:44,242 --> 01:43:47,159
If you wait here for a moment,
I'll see if I can get Tarek.

864
01:43:50,284 --> 01:43:52,471
Would you like a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

865
01:43:52,575 --> 01:43:53,721
Fine.

866
01:43:53,929 --> 01:43:57,263
Do you have a cell phone?
Mine's got no power.

867
01:44:01,534 --> 01:44:04,138
Thanks, I'll make it quick.

868
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:33,711
No!

869
01:44:51,628 --> 01:44:53,399
To the left!

870
01:44:57,357 --> 01:44:59,544
We can't leave him lying there!

871
01:45:11,628 --> 01:45:16,003
Bosch! You're one of us!
Stop them! That's an order!

872
01:45:17,149 --> 01:45:21,107
You traitor pig!
I'll get you all!

873
01:45:36,524 --> 01:45:38,294
They're breaking out! Come!

874
01:45:42,149 --> 01:45:44,024
I'll get you!

875
01:45:45,482 --> 01:45:47,253
The back way!

876
01:46:56,722 --> 01:46:59,222
Mr. Berus, please be reasonable!
- Shut up!

877
01:46:59,534 --> 01:47:02,764
Mr. Kamps, the experiment...
- Quiet! Tie them to the bars.

878
01:47:09,014 --> 01:47:10,784
The others must be
in the Medical School.

879
01:47:10,993 --> 01:47:14,639
There's only one way out.
They don't stand a chance.

880
01:48:49,099 --> 01:48:50,974
Mr. Eckert, what happened here?

881
01:48:59,203 --> 01:49:01,703
I didn't want this! I wanted...

882
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:04,411
I thought that...

883
01:49:28,568 --> 01:49:30,339
Wait, Bosch!

884
01:49:39,922 --> 01:49:41,693
It's over! I have...

885
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,630
Can you hear me?

886
01:51:05,225 --> 01:51:07,100
There you are!

887
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,850
I told you, I'll get you!

888
01:51:12,204 --> 01:51:13,975
On the floor, hands back!

889
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:20,745
No!

890
01:51:48,975 --> 01:51:50,850
Stop it!

891
01:51:52,620 --> 01:51:55,641
Give me the gun!
It's not real anyway!

892
01:51:56,579 --> 01:51:57,412
Bitch!

893
01:52:06,162 --> 01:52:08,037
The key, quick!

894
01:52:42,506 --> 01:52:44,277
You started this!

895
01:53:06,777 --> 01:53:09,902
You damned pig!
You killed Schutte!

896
01:53:15,527 --> 01:53:17,298
Stop it.

897
01:53:22,090 --> 01:53:23,965
It's over!

898
01:54:42,288 --> 01:54:44,684
The sad outcome:
two dead, three injured...

899
01:54:44,892 --> 01:54:48,538
...among them project leader
Professor Klaus Thon.

900
01:54:48,850 --> 01:54:52,288
Obviously the experiment got
out of control after two days.

901
01:54:53,225 --> 01:54:56,559
The district attorney is investigating
2 cases of suspected manslaughter...

902
01:54:56,975 --> 01:55:00,309
...and several cases of mistreatment
and failure to provide assistance.

903
01:55:00,517 --> 01:55:02,809
One of the test subjects
has been arrested.

904
01:55:02,913 --> 01:55:06,663
The project directors will probably
have to answer to a court.

905
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:09,267
According to statements by one
of the scientists involved...

906
01:55:09,475 --> 01:55:11,350
...the escalation
could've been prevented...

907
01:55:11,663 --> 01:55:14,371
...by aborting the experiment earlier.
