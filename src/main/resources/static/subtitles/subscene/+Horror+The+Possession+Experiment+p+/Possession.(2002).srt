1
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:44,392
They say that women change.

2
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,719
'Tis so,

3
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:51,681
but you are ever-constant
in your changefulness.

4
00:00:51,754 --> 00:00:54,951
Like that still thread
of falling river,

5
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,078
one from source to last embrace
in the still pool.

6
00:00:59,147 --> 00:01:03,174
Ever-anewed
and ever-moving on.

7
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:05,185
From first to last.
"From first to last,

8
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,626
a myriad water drops.
"A myriad water drops.

9
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:10,692
"And you...
I love you for it...

10
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:15,553
are the force that moves
and holds the form."

11
00:01:15,628 --> 00:01:19,241
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
you've just heard a snippet...

12
00:01:19,309 --> 00:01:23,105
from one of only two copies
of this poem...

13
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,733
by Mr. Randolph Henry Ash,

14
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:30,028
poet laureate
to Queen Victoria herself.

15
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:33,542
And this gorgeous ode
to his nuptial bliss,

16
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:37,706
written in his own hand,
begins our bidding today.

17
00:01:37,775 --> 00:01:42,051
May we start the bidding
please at £40,000.

18
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:12,111
- Bit of an old monster.
- Yeah.

19
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:15,886
But an important monster.
It's Randolph Ash's.

20
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:17,895
Yes. Who are you
with again?

21
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:23,150
I'm, uh, Roland Michell.
Who?

22
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:27,146
- Professor Blackadder's research assistant.
- Isn't that Dr. Wolfe?

23
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:31,146
Was. Fergus got the lectureship
at Saint John’s... over me.

24
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:36,107
Of course he did. Oh, yes,
Dr. Wolfe mentioned you.

25
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:38,667
You're that American
who's over here.

26
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:40,780
Well, I'm sure
there are others.

27
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:42,924
I mean, after all,
you are our favorite colony.

28
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:54,706
£ 10,000. Any further
offers on £ 10,000?

29
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:56,628
£ 11,000.

30
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:59,857
So when do your little suffragist
trinkets come up for the...

31
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:02,346
Look, Maud,
it's Mortimer Cropper.

32
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,363
Oh, yes. That's someone
you should know.

33
00:03:04,437 --> 00:03:06,576
- You know him?
- Of him.

34
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,849
Suffered through a lecture or two.
That sort of thing. Really.

35
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:11,187
Mm-hmm. He's a voracious
collector from what I hear.

36
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:14,221
Yes. His penchant for
conquests is well documented.

37
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,366
It's a very male quality. Mm.

38
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:18,348
I know it's vulgar,
but I have to introduce myself.

39
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:20,278
Oh, all right.

40
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:24,117
Oh, uh... Damn. Let's begin
the bidding please at £ 4,000.

41
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:28,591
£ 4,000. £ 4,000.
Excuse me. Sorry.

42
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:31,762
£ 4,500. Um, Professor
Cropper, Fergus Wolfe.

43
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:36,239
Um, we spoke actually after one
of your papers at, uh, at Trinity.

44
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:39,443
You wouldn't remember. I'm
sorry, I don't. Nice coat though.

45
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:42,643
Oh, thank you. Uh, James
Blackadder. You're with?

46
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:45,909
Ah, you're one of Blackadder's
boys from the British Museum.

47
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,397
Hello.
Hildebrand Ash,

48
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:51,888
man of leisure.
Oh, hello.

49
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:53,903
I don't know why Blackadder
comes to these things.

50
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:56,562
He hasn't got any money.

51
00:03:56,633 --> 00:04:00,344
Well, he's Irish, you see.
He enjoys feeling persecuted.

52
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,825
Dear Madame:

53
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:28,602
Since our pleasant conversation,
I have thought of little else.

54
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:31,643
I write with a strong sense
of the necessity...

55
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,683
of continuing our talk.

56
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:46,099
Dear Madame: I know that you came
only to honor Crabb-Robinson...

57
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:49,075
at his small,
informal party...

58
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:51,833
because he had been of assistance
to your illustrious father.

59
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:54,454
Excuse me, sir.

60
00:04:54,525 --> 00:04:56,380
Meal is served.

61
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:00,437
Thank you.

62
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:36,997
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

63
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,681
Ah, my tenant.
Your evening sherry.

64
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,889
Thank you.

65
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,131
Candy, this is Roland.
Roland, Candy.

66
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,810
- Hello again.
- Be a love and check on the duck, eh?

67
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,906
- Okay.
- So, coming in?

68
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:54,758
So how do you
always know it's me?

69
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:57,605
I'm a solicitor.
I know everything.

70
00:06:57,672 --> 00:07:00,094
- Candy, huh?
- Oh, no, no, no, please.

71
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:03,713
Candy's just a friend.
Why, are you interested?

72
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:06,338
- I told you I'm off women.
- Yeah, but...

73
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:08,830
it isn't a reason
to be off women.

74
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:16,319
Why do we always
sit in your hall?

75
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:20,038
'Cause it's the best room in the house,
really. I bought this place for the hallway.

76
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:25,513
So, I found something today I think is
pretty incredible in the London Library.

77
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,710
- A place to sit.
- No.

78
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,429
I found something of Ash's.
You know Randolph Ash?

79
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:35,360
Ash. Oh, doesn't he have
some sort of celebration going?

80
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:38,216
It's the centenary of his love
poems. Terribly mushy ones.

81
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,388
Found after his death
or something, weren't they?

82
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:42,466
Is the table laid,
darling?

83
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,678
Listen.
What's it cost an hour?

84
00:07:44,748 --> 00:07:46,603
No, no, Candy's a friend
I told you.

85
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:50,530
Not her, you. What do you
charge an hour, roughly?

86
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,419
Oh, uh, I don't know.
Five hundred.

87
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:55,972
- Pounds?
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:58,434
- Jesus, no wonder you have a nice hallway.
- Thank you.

89
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:02,154
Okay, I wanna buy seven minutes of
attorney/client privilege right now.

90
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:04,228
Step into my office.

91
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:18,725
Ash wrote those.
They're not the originals.

92
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,654
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

93
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:23,370
How much time we got left? I've
got to think of a defense for you.

94
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,992
They're practically
love letters.

95
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:28,168
Well, they're racy, actually.
See, Ash...

96
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:30,126
supposedly never even looked
at another woman.

97
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:32,613
I mean, not even glanced at one
his entire marriage.

98
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:35,338
Can you imagine what would
happen if I could prove...

99
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:38,791
that Mr. Perfect Husband had this, like,
Shakespearean-type dark lady thing going?

100
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,317
Darling, the duck's done.

101
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:44,241
Would you be a sweetheart
and do the sauce?

102
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:46,280
Yes, yes.

103
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,991
- Duck, huh?
- Yeah, Peking.

104
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:53,807
It's from around the corner.

105
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:56,807
Yeah, but that
would be extraordinary.

106
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,418
It would be rewriting
history, old chap.

107
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,845
Yeah, it would be.

108
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,821
Morning.
Morning.

109
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:50,643
Roland.
Professor.

110
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:56,086
I think
I made a discovery.

111
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:58,736
It'll turn out to have been
discovered 20 times already.

112
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,156
- I don't think so.
- Surprise me.

113
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:05,326
Ash's copy of Vico
in the London Library.

114
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,082
It's full of his own notes on loose
bits of paper all the way through.

115
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:10,006
- Useful?
- Very.

116
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:13,268
Better have a look.
See what's what before...

117
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:15,758
people turn up with his checkbook.
I also found... Professor.

118
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:19,662
They made a mockery over at Sotheby's
yesterday. £ 1900 for a toothpick.

119
00:10:19,737 --> 00:10:22,803
Fergus. Where is Fergus?

120
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:26,102
- He's supposed to be teaching.
- I'll come with you.

121
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,787
No need. The novice
blunders on the discovery.

122
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:31,191
The scholar investigates.

123
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:35,283
You get on with those wretched
requests for Ellen's stuff.

124
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:37,263
I'll go straight from there
to my class.

125
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:44,689
Thank you, Roland. What a wonderful
discovery. They're magically delicious.

126
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:48,592
- He's a meany.
- That's a very nice name for what he is.

127
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,772
Wretched requests, please.

128
00:10:50,843 --> 00:10:53,909
"How many jars
of gooseberry jam...

129
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:57,656
did Ash's wife, Ellen,
make in 1850?"

130
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,952
Hmm. This is not
a job for a grown-up.

131
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:08,243
Gooseberry.

132
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:14,354
Cooking.
Gooseberry jam.

133
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:18,873
Cooking, 143.

134
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:39,834
What about a small,
informal party?

135
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:41,877
1859.

136
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:58,751
My headache last night prevented
me from accompanying Randolph...

137
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:01,369
to dear Crabb-Robinson's...

138
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,157
for a dinner honoring
the poetess Christabel LaMotte.

139
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,641
He was reluctant to attend
without me, but I was persistent...

140
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:09,568
and finally persuaded him.

141
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:11,488
Ash, you know
Professor Spear.

142
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:13,496
I'm delighted.

143
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:16,090
Mrs. Jameson.
Mrs. Jameson.

144
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:18,018
Charmed.

145
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:20,220
Miss Glover.

146
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:22,199
Oh, Miss Glover.

147
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,177
- And Miss LaMotte.
- Miss LaMotte.

148
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:30,077
The highest pleasure.

149
00:12:30,147 --> 00:12:33,147
Randolph reported the party went
off very well, indeed.

150
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,585
The discussion of poetry
was animated,

151
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:40,059
with Miss LaMotte speaking more
forcibly than anyone expected.

152
00:12:40,131 --> 00:12:43,230
Surprises me, Madame, that a lady
who lives as quietly as you do...

153
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,392
wouldn't be aware
of my modest success.

154
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,940
Oh, I'm very aware that the
papers herald you weekly.

155
00:12:52,197 --> 00:12:54,302
It is you, however,
who surprise me.

156
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:58,498
- And why is that?
- Judging from your work,

157
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:00,541
I'm surprised you'd even
acknowledge my existence...

158
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:04,257
or any woman's for that matter since you
show us such small regard on the page.

159
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,060
You cut me, Madame.

160
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:09,988
I'm sorry.

161
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:12,192
I only meant to scratch.

162
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,805
Hey, Fergus.

163
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,285
Ah, hello, Roland.

164
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:23,205
What is it you chaps always say,
"How's it hanging?"

165
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:26,533
Well, we usually just say
"hey." Unless you're gay.

166
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,770
Oh.
Listen.

167
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,142
Let me ask you something.
Do you know a Dr. Maud Bailey?

168
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,063
Maud! Oh, yes,
I know Maud very well.

169
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:35,234
She teaches Gender Studies
at Lincoln.

170
00:13:35,305 --> 00:13:40,062
Oh. Would she be helpful? I'm
checking out Christabel LaMotte.

171
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:42,046
She's a poet,
writing around about 1859.

172
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,975
Yes, yes. Why would you
be interested in her?

173
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,751
Oh, nothing. It's just I had some
requests about Ellen Ash's papers.

174
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:49,671
But LaMotte's name
came up, so...

175
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:53,316
The keeper of Ellen's flame. I mean, that's
the bottom of the food chain, old sport.

176
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:56,801
Yeah, but I got to stay on the food
chain, old sport. That's why I do it.

177
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:59,296
Right. Well, "Publish
or perish," as they say.

178
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,792
Or in your case,
"Perish or perish."

179
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,665
So would she...
this Maud Bailey person?

180
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:08,936
Oh, yes, but I'd be careful
if I were you.

181
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:12,516
Why? What's she like? Well, she
thicks men's blood with cold.

182
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:16,068
Oh, great. Or if you prefer
the American vernacular...

183
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,506
she's a regular ball breaker.

184
00:14:28,013 --> 00:14:30,185
Mr. Michell?

185
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:34,497
What? I'm sorry.
Roland Michell.

186
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,428
Yes.

187
00:14:36,493 --> 00:14:39,689
You're Maud.
Bailey. Dr. Bailey, yes.

188
00:14:39,757 --> 00:14:43,336
There's nothing in my index.
No mention of Ash at all.

189
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:45,260
Well, Ash and LaMotte
definitely met.

190
00:14:45,326 --> 00:14:48,229
Really? When?
June, 1859.

191
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:50,342
At a dinner party
given by Crabb-Robinson.

192
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,325
And you jumped from that to
the idea that they corresponded.

193
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,537
I found an unfinished draft
of a letter in a book...

194
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,679
Addressed to LaMotte?
No, just "Dear Madame."

195
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:02,639
But there were three women at
Crabb-Robinson's dinner party,

196
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:04,744
and out of the three
it's likeliest to be LaMotte.

197
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,565
So maybe there's something
in LaMotte's letters.

198
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:11,047
There aren't many from the Richmond
period... the time you're interested in.

199
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:15,820
I'm descended from Christabel,
actually. I'm her niece, thrice removed.

200
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:20,584
Three grades. That's what
"thrice" usually means.

201
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,877
Oh, maybe
I shouldn't have come.

202
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:27,760
It does seem
rather pointless.

203
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:31,980
Well, I supposed since you're here, you
could have a look through Blanche's diary.

204
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:34,319
Who's Blanche?
Blanche Glover.

205
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:37,233
Christabel's companion.
Her lover.

206
00:15:37,298 --> 00:15:39,338
Oh, you look surprised.

207
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:41,484
I didn't know she was...
Didn't know she was a lesbian.

208
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:43,530
No. I mean, don't get me
wrong, I like lesbians.

209
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:45,991
Yes, well, unfortunately, they didn't
have video cameras in those days,

210
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:48,205
so you're out of luck.

211
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:50,380
Now I see why you think
it's so unlikely.

212
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,550
Not from that point of view. I mean,
God, she could have been bisexual.

213
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,561
There's no evidence she was,
but in theory...

214
00:15:55,635 --> 00:15:58,352
Did you not do any reading
before you came?

215
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,558
Is this like an oral exam?
Yes, I suppose it is.

216
00:16:00,628 --> 00:16:04,141
I mean, you don't know the first thing
about her, and yet you make these leaps.

217
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:07,146
Hey, you're the one who
called her a lesbian, not me.

218
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:21,676
Letters, letters, letters.

219
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,605
Not for me.

220
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:26,704
Letters I am not meant
to know or see.

221
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:42,036
Thank you, Jane.

222
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:52,910
- You do not have to hide them from me.
- I'm not hiding them.

223
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:58,071
You say they are not hidden,
but they are.

224
00:16:58,137 --> 00:17:01,552
Tucked away... as if they
were from Cupid himself.

225
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,296
What does he want?

226
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:09,328
To be my friend.
Friend.

227
00:17:10,874 --> 00:17:14,169
They always try and give
what they want a decent name.

228
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:18,031
Blanche, no.
No, Blanche, listen.

229
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,118
What we have...
is ours.

230
00:17:24,187 --> 00:17:26,161
No one can change that.

231
00:17:32,955 --> 00:17:34,810
'Tis already changed.

232
00:17:50,525 --> 00:17:53,460
- Find anything?
- Maybe.

233
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:18,454
So what are
those bookmarks then?

234
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:21,501
Blanche writes about letters.

235
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:24,437
Letters, letters that Christabel
wrote and received.

236
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,454
And it nearly
drove Blanche crazy.

237
00:18:26,526 --> 00:18:28,383
Where are they?

238
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:31,415
Lost. Destroyed. Who knows?
There's lots we haven't got.

239
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:34,335
Not one of Blanche's paintings
has ever turned up, for instance.

240
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:37,375
So who do you think
wrote the letters?

241
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,774
We've never been able
to verify who he was,

242
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,142
but Ash certainly
isn't one of the candidates.

243
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:46,269
You've got nothing. I
mean, it's just a thought.

244
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:48,192
Of course, I've thrown out
a lot of thoughts today,

245
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,624
and you've pretty much
shot them all down, so...

246
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:54,301
Yes, well, it seems like a bit
of a wild-goose chase to me.

247
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,225
I'd like to do
some more reading.

248
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,585
I suppose you'll wish to
stay here overnight then?

249
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:02,171
Well, I can't really afford
to stay overnight.

250
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:05,025
Unless you want me huddled
downstairs in your doorway.

251
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:07,873
I suppose I could put up with
you for one evening, couldn't I?

252
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:19,546
No doubt you know
Fergus Wolfe then.

253
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:22,817
I'm sorry. Uh, yeah, we're
in the same department.

254
00:19:22,884 --> 00:19:25,471
I imagine that
he told you that we're...

255
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,395
occasionally
on together.

256
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,933
- No, he didn't.
- Well, did he...

257
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,233
Did he say anything...
about me?

258
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:37,276
Uh...

259
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:40,004
No.

260
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,514
Right. I'll use the bathroom
first. Get out of your way.

261
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,550
Please. I'm just sort of a brush
and flush kind of guy, so...

262
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:52,735
Forget I said that.

263
00:19:52,807 --> 00:19:54,717
Maud.

264
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:56,767
Can I show you something?

265
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:13,479
Are these... How did you
get... Those are the originals.

266
00:20:13,544 --> 00:20:15,400
I took them. I sort of
stole them. Took them?

267
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,352
Where from?
The London Library.

268
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,100
How could you do that?
It was on impulse.

269
00:20:20,168 --> 00:20:22,851
Impulse?

270
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,158
Right. I've seen that
take-what-you-want attitude in other...

271
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:27,080
What, in other Americans?

272
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:30,941
God, what is it with
you people and Americans?

273
00:20:31,018 --> 00:20:33,320
Look, I know that I shouldn't
have taken them. I know that.

274
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:35,525
But, Maud, I want to
find out what happened?

275
00:20:35,594 --> 00:20:37,350
Did he or didn't he
send the letter?

276
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:39,273
You might not buy into
my theory, but to me,

277
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,378
Blanche's diary
suggests that it's possible.

278
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,937
Wouldn't someone have
unearthed a thing like this?

279
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,174
- That's what makes it so big.
- Potentially so big.

280
00:20:47,243 --> 00:20:50,659
- Well, no one has.
- Probably because those were never sent.

281
00:21:17,997 --> 00:21:20,136
Are you doing your homework?

282
00:21:21,326 --> 00:21:24,228
No, I'm just...
writing stuff.

283
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:26,156
Stuff for me.
It's nothing.

284
00:21:26,222 --> 00:21:29,190
You're a closet poet.
Uh...

285
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:31,629
more like basement,
really.

286
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:34,182
I'm just, uh,
just fooling around.

287
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:36,294
Is that what you want
to be when you grow up?

288
00:21:36,366 --> 00:21:39,750
No, I'm gonna be safe and
teach like everybody else.

289
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,999
Besides, there's no such
thing as poets anymore.

290
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:48,367
Well... poet,

291
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,458
do you want a secret about
his family home before you go?

292
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:55,114
Michell's late again.

293
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,403
Roland asked for
another day off, Fergus.

294
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:01,327
Oh, really?
Where's he gone?

295
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:04,655
I didn't ask,
and he didn't say.

296
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:08,037
He's American, for God's sake.
He's probably off trafficking drugs.

297
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:11,147
Did his new discovery
lead to anything?

298
00:22:11,218 --> 00:22:13,486
Ash's Vico.
Are you dreaming?

299
00:22:13,553 --> 00:22:17,384
Vico? No, no, this had something
to do with Christabel LaMotte.

300
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:20,720
He went to see Dr. Bailey
in Lincoln... a woman.

301
00:22:20,786 --> 00:22:24,081
LaMotte. Hmm. No.

302
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:26,961
- Well, it probably came to nothing then.
- Exactly.

303
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,482
Or he would have told you.

304
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:35,017
Wouldn't he?

305
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:46,026
Seal Court's
over there.

306
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,719
So how long did Christabel
live at this Seal Court place?

307
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:51,789
Ages. The last 20
or so years of her life.

308
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:54,836
Excuse me.
Sorry.

309
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:58,163
"To a dusty shelf we aspire."

310
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,932
You should drop by Seal Court
before the train.

311
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:08,909
And what do you do
in London, Mr. Michell?

312
00:23:08,982 --> 00:23:12,365
Are you a teacher as well? No,
not yet. I'm doing a fellowship.

313
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:16,083
- Which means what exactly?
- On the dole.

314
00:23:18,328 --> 00:23:20,532
Um, my field's
Victorian poetry.

315
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,186
We had ourselves a poet
in this house once.

316
00:23:23,256 --> 00:23:27,730
Terrible, sentimental stuff about
God and death and the dew and fairies.

317
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,095
Why don't you show this young
man Christabel's room, Maud?

318
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:34,227
And why don't you
stay tonight?

319
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:37,431
You're under no obligation
to stay, of course.

320
00:23:37,496 --> 00:23:39,985
It's just Joan’s way.
Misses our daughter.

321
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:42,261
Quite a drive back,
actually. No, we're fine.

322
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:44,239
Oh, well.

323
00:23:44,313 --> 00:23:46,801
Hardly ever come up here.

324
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:51,314
With the wheelchair, of course,
we bunk down on the ground floor.

325
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:59,377
I haven't been up here
since I was a child.

326
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,488
Maud, is this the photograph
at your house?

327
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:07,636
Yes, that's
Christabel's niece, May.

328
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,561
That's my
great-great-grandmother.

329
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,392
Christabel wrote dozens of poems
about this place.

330
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:23,443
"Haunted are they who haunt our
dreams and weaken our desires...

331
00:24:23,517 --> 00:24:25,371
"and turn us
from a solid face.

332
00:24:25,436 --> 00:24:30,292
"And in the depth of wintery night,
they slumber in the night and bright.

333
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:34,938
"Dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend.

334
00:24:35,005 --> 00:24:37,755
"Dolly's silent sympathy
lasts without end.

335
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:41,750
"No rush of action,
this is our doom.

336
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:46,556
To live a long life out
in a dark room."

337
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:51,318
Maud.

338
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,365
It's pretty
incredible, huh?

339
00:25:00,992 --> 00:25:03,261
Fergus, it's me.

340
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:07,190
I-I'm out of town tonight
on business.

341
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:10,778
I've stumbled onto a connection
between Christabel and Randolph Ash...

342
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:12,703
and have a few questions
for you.

343
00:25:12,768 --> 00:25:17,853
Call me on 015-22632416.

344
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:30,424
Roland.

345
00:25:32,546 --> 00:25:35,066
Roland.

346
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:38,400
Roland. Roland.
No!

347
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:41,532
Roland, it's me.
It's Maud.

348
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:45,602
- What is it?
- Listen.

349
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:50,301
"Dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend.

350
00:25:50,372 --> 00:25:54,780
Dolly's silent sympathy
lasts without end."

351
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:33,637
God.

352
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:37,023
I was so sure.

353
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:40,576
Sympathy.
Sympathy.

354
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:42,622
Sympathy, meaning what?

355
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:45,854
Mutual affection
or understanding.

356
00:26:45,928 --> 00:26:49,954
Favor pity or even accord.
But that's not it, is it?

357
00:26:51,657 --> 00:26:53,512
That's what she told her.

358
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:58,270
She uses silent sympathy
in a more classical context.

359
00:26:58,345 --> 00:27:01,344
Like structural support.
Dolly conceals it.

360
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:04,767
Yes, but not within,
beneath.

361
00:27:10,634 --> 00:27:12,577
There's a door.
There's a door.

362
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:30,370
- I can't believe it.
- Let me see.

363
00:27:30,444 --> 00:27:32,298
Be-Be careful. They're very
precious. I'll be very careful.

364
00:27:32,363 --> 00:27:34,218
Oh, God, we shouldn't
be doing this.

365
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:37,993
What do you mean, we shouldn't be doing
this? Why'd you drag me up here then?

366
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,165
What are you doing?
I'm going to read.

367
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:42,091
Stop. We've got to
ask the Baileys.

368
00:27:42,157 --> 00:27:44,939
You ask, and the next time you see
these is under glass in New Mexico.

369
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:46,761
Stop it. Stop. Stop.
Stop. All right. All right.

370
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:48,716
But can we please
at least do it properly?

371
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,115
Let me run downstairs and get
some note cards and some pencils.

372
00:27:51,181 --> 00:27:53,222
All right.
Go, go! Hurry!

373
00:28:28,977 --> 00:28:31,050
Look at this. We've got Ash
and Christabel's letters here.

374
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,975
- Look. Come here. Listen.
- What?

375
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,626
"Dear Miss LaMotte:

376
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:37,552
"It was a great pleasure
to talk to you...

377
00:28:37,617 --> 00:28:40,399
"at dear
Crabb-Robinson's party.

378
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:44,463
"May I hope that you too
enjoyed our talk.

379
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,791
And may I have the pleasure
of calling on you."

380
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:53,232
She says, " No,
but you may write.

381
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:57,127
"Would you rather not have
a letter, however imperfect,

382
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,049
"than a plate
of cucumber sandwiches,

383
00:29:00,116 --> 00:29:02,985
"however exquisitely
fine cut?

384
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:05,710
Know you would,
and so would I."

385
00:29:09,108 --> 00:29:13,582
"I was entranced and moved by your
brief portrait of your father."

386
00:29:13,653 --> 00:29:16,435
"I write nonsense,
but if you can't write again,

387
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,053
"you shall have a sober essay
on what you will.

388
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:22,507
"Yours to command
in some things.

389
00:29:22,581 --> 00:29:24,436
"Where I was born,
Christabel Lamotte."

390
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:26,606
"Was a small place too.

391
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:29,044
"Not like this.
Not bare.

392
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:31,313
"A brilliant, dusty hutch
of mystery"...

393
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:34,349
is a cabinet of curiosities.

394
00:29:35,862 --> 00:29:38,229
What did my eyes
first light on?

395
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:40,749
I am a creature of my pen.

396
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,856
My pen is the best part
of me.

397
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:46,577
I send you now
two more poems.

398
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:49,581
I eagerly read
your mythic tales of mire...

399
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,621
and found them
both charming and sad.

400
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:56,558
Your verse is rich, but
perhaps the metaphor is richer.

401
00:29:56,631 --> 00:29:58,487
Dear Mr. Ash:

402
00:29:58,552 --> 00:30:01,552
I live circumscribed
and self-communing.

403
00:30:01,624 --> 00:30:03,479
It is best so.

404
00:30:03,544 --> 00:30:07,538
Not like a princess in the thicket,
more like a spider in her web.

405
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:11,886
"Inclined to snap at visitors
or trespassers,

406
00:30:11,961 --> 00:30:15,376
"not perceiving the distinction
until too late.

407
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:17,751
Thus, it is unwise to call."

408
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:20,086
I know you live very quietly.

409
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:22,194
But I could be very quiet.

410
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:24,601
I only want to discuss
Dante and Shakespeare,

411
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:27,284
Wordsworth, Coleridge,
and Goethe.

412
00:30:27,354 --> 00:30:31,314
Not forgetting, of course,
Christabel LaMotte...

413
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:34,582
and the ambitious
fairy project.

414
00:30:48,571 --> 00:30:51,670
Oh, sir, things flicker and shift.

415
00:30:51,739 --> 00:30:55,285
All spangle and sparkle
and flashes.

416
00:30:55,356 --> 00:30:58,672
I have sat all this long evening
by my fireside,

417
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:01,400
turning towards
a caving in,

418
00:31:01,469 --> 00:31:03,802
the crumbling
of the consumed coals,

419
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:06,552
to where I am leading myself...

420
00:31:06,621 --> 00:31:09,305
to lifeless dust, sir.

421
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:14,841
My dear friend... for I may
call myself a friend, may I not?

422
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:18,329
I speak to you as I would
speak to any person...

423
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,464
who possesses my true thoughts.

424
00:31:21,534 --> 00:31:23,771
For my true thoughts have spent
more time in your company...

425
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:27,898
than in anyone else's
these last few weeks.

426
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:30,333
Where my thoughts are,

427
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,373
there am I in truth.

428
00:31:34,431 --> 00:31:37,912
"My dear friend:
It has been borne in upon me...

429
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:41,693
that there are dangers
in our continued conversation."

430
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,932
The world would not look well
upon letters...

431
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,132
between a woman living
in shared solitude as I do...

432
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:49,110
and a man.

433
00:31:49,185 --> 00:31:53,211
Even if that man
were a great poet.

434
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:55,769
And if one is to live
in this way,

435
00:31:55,841 --> 00:32:00,064
it is imperative to appear respectable
in the eyes of that world...

436
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:02,235
and your wife.

437
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:06,529
It is a sealed pact.

438
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:10,271
It is a chosen way of life in which
I have been wondrously happy...

439
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:13,437
and not alone in being so.

440
00:32:13,506 --> 00:32:16,124
"I have chosen a way,
dear friend,

441
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:19,065
"I must hold to it.

442
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:21,790
"Be patient.
Be generous. Forgive.

443
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:26,562
"May I also request that you
return my correspondence to me.

444
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:30,109
"In this way, at least our
letters will remain together.

445
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,627
"I have known incandescence...

446
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,483
"and must decline
to sample it any further.

447
00:32:37,764 --> 00:32:40,001
"This now goes to the post.

448
00:32:40,069 --> 00:32:43,647
Forgive its faults and
forgive me. Christabel. "

449
00:32:45,478 --> 00:32:47,866
My dear Christabel:

450
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:50,723
Your letter came as a shock
to me, I will confess.

451
00:32:52,294 --> 00:32:56,996
I was at first not only shocked,
but angry that you should write so.

452
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:02,206
As you've asked about my wife,
however, I will tell you.

453
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:06,558
I love Ellen,
but not as I love you.

454
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:12,092
There are good reasons which I
cannot discuss why my love for you...

455
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,622
may not hurt her.

456
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:17,597
I do not feel I have been
a proper wife to you, Randolph.

457
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:20,093
Without children, without
ever any kind of physical...

458
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,502
Nonsense, Ellen.

459
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,543
Nonsense.

460
00:33:26,184 --> 00:33:29,120
There are many
types of love.

461
00:33:30,281 --> 00:33:32,136
All sorts.

462
00:33:32,201 --> 00:33:37,569
And ours
are good between us.

463
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,791
It has been most profound.

464
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:48,003
I must say to you
what is in my mind.

465
00:33:48,074 --> 00:33:51,173
I have called you my muse,
and so you are.

466
00:33:51,242 --> 00:33:54,112
I could call you
with even greater truth...

467
00:33:54,187 --> 00:33:56,609
my love.

468
00:33:56,810 --> 00:34:01,001
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
What? Don't do that. What?

469
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:03,435
So he sends his response.
He sends her more letters.

470
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,769
She doesn't answer them.
She ignores them.

471
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,290
Typical.

472
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:11,145
No. She-She chose her life
with Blanche.

473
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:14,561
It's not typical.
It's remarkable.

474
00:34:20,204 --> 00:34:22,213
"I shall hope against hope
that this note is the dove...

475
00:34:22,285 --> 00:34:24,936
"which will return with
the wished-for olive branch.

476
00:34:25,006 --> 00:34:28,518
My letters are like Noah's ravens...
they have sped out across the Thames "

477
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:33,575
They have sped out across the
Thames and yet have not returned.

478
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:36,962
I send this note by hand in the
hope that you might receive it.

479
00:34:44,238 --> 00:34:46,377
Where are the letters?

480
00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:48,423
They're gone.

481
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:54,188
I tore them up.
I burned them.

482
00:34:54,255 --> 00:34:56,492
And the others
from my desk?

483
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,462
The same.

484
00:35:00,655 --> 00:35:04,431
I beg for us to be as
we were, Christabel.

485
00:35:04,496 --> 00:35:07,463
Sweetheart, please.

486
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:16,042
This house, so happy once,

487
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,889
is full of weeping and wailing
and black headaches.

488
00:35:19,955 --> 00:35:22,375
I ask myself
to whom I may turn...

489
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:25,745
and think of you,
my friend...

490
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:29,389
the unwitting cause
of all this grief.

491
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:39,084
I shan't forget the first
glimpse of your form...

492
00:35:40,275 --> 00:35:43,952
illuminated as it was
by flashes of sunlight.

493
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:47,281
I have dreamt nightly
of your face.

494
00:35:47,347 --> 00:35:51,571
To walk to the landscape of my life
with the rhythms of your writing...

495
00:35:51,637 --> 00:35:53,491
ringing in my ears.

496
00:35:53,557 --> 00:35:55,923
I shall never forget
our shining progress...

497
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,606
towards one another.

498
00:35:58,676 --> 00:36:03,565
Never have I felt such a
concentration of my entire being.

499
00:36:03,637 --> 00:36:07,182
I cannot let you
burn me up,

500
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,708
nor can I resist you.

501
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:14,866
No mere human can stand in
a fire and not be consumed.

502
00:36:20,567 --> 00:36:23,218
You mind reading that last
part out one more time?

503
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,788
"I cannot let you
burn me up,

504
00:36:29,047 --> 00:36:32,658
"nor can I resist you.

505
00:36:32,727 --> 00:36:35,029
"No mere human
can stand in a fire...

506
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:37,430
and not be consumed."

507
00:36:38,327 --> 00:36:41,524
- That?
- Yeah.

508
00:36:46,264 --> 00:36:48,785
Thank you and...

509
00:36:48,856 --> 00:36:53,527
"And I took your hand.
Mine rested in yours...

510
00:36:53,593 --> 00:36:56,593
with trust and relief."

511
00:37:06,522 --> 00:37:08,595
Do you have regrets?

512
00:37:10,265 --> 00:37:14,357
I should regret venturing out to
Crabb-Robinson's party that evening.

513
00:37:18,522 --> 00:37:20,628
I should regret it,
but I do not.

514
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:24,345
Not even in that most
sensible corner of my heart.

515
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:30,071
What are we to do?

516
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:37,810
"I do not wish to
damage your life.

517
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:41,016
"Nonetheless, I shall be in
the church at noon tomorrow,

518
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:45,433
"with what strikes me
as the holiest of prayers...

519
00:37:46,717 --> 00:37:50,263
"that you should join me
on a journey to Yorkshire...

520
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:54,556
and journey out of time beyond
our lives here on Earth."

521
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,916
This is unbelievable.
That was the last one.

522
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,031
You're kidding me.
No.

523
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:11,487
Well, did she go with
him or not? Hands up!

524
00:38:12,512 --> 00:38:14,138
You two?

525
00:38:17,024 --> 00:38:21,301
- What's this then? - There's
been no harm done, George.

526
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:23,198
How do we know
if harm's been done?

527
00:38:23,265 --> 00:38:26,777
I think it was very clever
of Maud to find your treasure.

528
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:32,031
Yes. Well, must
take advice, Joanie.

529
00:38:33,153 --> 00:38:35,706
How long before Sir George
takes advice?

530
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:39,552
He'll dither around for
a while, but not long.

531
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:42,552
Blanche's diary has nothing
for that period.

532
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:44,634
What about Ellen Ash?
Did she keep a journal?

533
00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:47,869
Yeah, in London, but it's mostly
just boring housewife stuff.

534
00:38:47,937 --> 00:38:51,867
God is in the boring housewife
stuff. We should check it.

535
00:39:03,012 --> 00:39:04,867
Bailey here.
Bailey.

536
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:07,005
Is that Dr. Heath?

537
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:10,272
No. Um, I'm a friend
of Maud Bailey's.

538
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,196
I was wondering,
is she there?

539
00:39:12,261 --> 00:39:16,602
No, she isn't. Could you get off
the line? I'm expecting the doctor.

540
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:18,881
Oh, um, have you seen
Roland Michell?

541
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:22,244
Not since
this morning, no.

542
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:24,164
But his work
went well, did it?

543
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:28,190
The fairy poem?
I haven't the foggiest idea.

544
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:30,116
Do you mean
Christabel LaMotte?

545
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:32,734
Get off the line!

546
00:39:47,623 --> 00:39:50,590
I looked in Ellen's diary.
There's nothing.

547
00:39:50,663 --> 00:39:55,104
But, uh, this should
cheer you up.

548
00:39:57,512 --> 00:39:59,815
It's in her correspondence.

549
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:01,790
I'm not going to ask
if this is the original.

550
00:40:01,863 --> 00:40:04,068
I wouldn't.

551
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:07,111
"Dear Mrs. Ash:

552
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:09,031
"I'm at present
totally unknown to you,

553
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:12,163
"but I have something
to impart to which...

554
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:17,448
"closely concerns both of us and is
in my case a matter of life and death.

555
00:40:17,513 --> 00:40:22,370
"May I trespass on your time
and come to see you?

556
00:40:22,442 --> 00:40:27,199
"You would do wrong to keep this
evidence which I send to you now.

557
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:29,730
"It is not mine,
it is also not yours.

558
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,415
"What I say is true and urgent
as you will come to see.

559
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:36,101
Yours sincerely,
Blanche Glover."

560
00:40:43,403 --> 00:40:45,258
Mrs. Ash.

561
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:52,939
Maybe Blanche didn't tear the letters
but kept them and showed them to Ellen.

562
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:55,852
It all fits beautifully.

563
00:40:55,917 --> 00:41:00,227
Well, perhaps, um, both of our
departments should work on this together.

564
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:02,920
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know. Do you?

565
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,290
No. I wanna go after them.
I wanna find out what happened.

566
00:41:05,356 --> 00:41:08,936
I wanna go to Yorkshire and
follow their trail. I need to know.

567
00:41:09,006 --> 00:41:13,350
I thought you were mad when you came
to Lincoln with your stolen letter.

568
00:41:14,926 --> 00:41:17,741
Now I feel
exactly the same.

569
00:41:21,006 --> 00:41:22,861
I haven't really thanked you.

570
00:41:22,926 --> 00:41:26,605
I mean, properly,
for all of this.

571
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:30,054
I have difficulty
with compliments and such.

572
00:41:30,895 --> 00:41:32,751
Giving or receiving?

573
00:41:32,816 --> 00:41:34,791
Both, actually.

574
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:37,903
Well, I won't tell you
you're amazing-looking then.

575
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:41,449
You're probably sick of
hearing it. Thank you. It's...

576
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,757
I'm the last guy who'd act
on it, with Fergus and all.

577
00:41:43,825 --> 00:41:49,291
- What does "and all" mean? - Nothing.
Just a little problem that I have socially.

578
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,750
Do you take anything for it?

579
00:41:51,825 --> 00:41:54,727
It's not that kind
of a problem.

580
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:59,144
It's just relationships on the
whole. They're not really for me.

581
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:03,888
- Anyway...
- Yes...

582
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:07,663
anyway... thank you.

583
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,935
You're welcome.

584
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,856
Thank you for agreeing
to meet me, Professor.

585
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:20,786
Well, you made me rather
curious. Drink, sir?

586
00:42:20,851 --> 00:42:22,826
Scotch with
just a dash of soda.

587
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:25,321
Sir? Thank you. Uh, I'll
have the same. Thank you.

588
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:29,266
Um, I wanted to learn
of the connection...

589
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:32,201
between Ash
and Christabel LaMotte.

590
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:34,995
LaMotte and Ash?
There isn't any.

591
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:36,915
Well, Roland Michell
has made a discovery...

592
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,217
with a colleague of mine,
Maud Bailey.

593
00:42:39,285 --> 00:42:41,522
I'm sorry. Who the
hell is Roland Michell?

594
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:45,518
Oh, Blackadder's research
assistant. American.

595
00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:49,419
Blondish. Well, anyway,
he seems to know you.

596
00:42:49,494 --> 00:42:51,349
And he thinks
it's important.

597
00:42:51,414 --> 00:42:53,781
And does Blackadder agree?

598
00:42:53,847 --> 00:42:56,149
I don't believe
he knows anything about it.

599
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,848
Do you wish to
be lunched separately?

600
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,465
Respectably,
elsewhere from me?

601
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,280
I want to be with you.

602
00:43:36,346 --> 00:43:39,859
I understood that was
what we had decided.

603
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:44,949
These four weeks
only are ours...

604
00:43:45,018 --> 00:43:47,352
but ours alone.

605
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:56,593
Oh, I, uh...

606
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:03,546
I hope you will
accept this ring.

607
00:44:03,611 --> 00:44:06,033
I have brought a ring too.

608
00:44:07,548 --> 00:44:09,718
You see?

609
00:44:09,788 --> 00:44:11,927
Proof of my resolution.

610
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:30,268
You take my breath away.

611
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,494
Not yet.

612
00:44:57,953 --> 00:45:00,124
No. Not yet.

613
00:45:03,265 --> 00:45:06,364
Shall we go out,
then, to explore?

614
00:45:24,834 --> 00:45:26,810
There's your bathroom.

615
00:45:29,155 --> 00:45:31,129
Bluebirds.

616
00:45:33,123 --> 00:45:35,098
Your lovely view.

617
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:39,422
And, of course, the bed.

618
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,780
We'll look
for another hotel.

619
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,699
But this is
where Ash stayed.

620
00:45:49,764 --> 00:45:51,619
Well, then we'll
have to share a room.

621
00:45:51,685 --> 00:45:54,947
I can bring up a folding bed for
one of you, if that's your problem.

622
00:45:57,317 --> 00:45:59,172
We work together, actually.
It's not...

623
00:45:59,237 --> 00:46:01,092
- We were expecting two rooms.
- Right.

624
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,875
I'm sure it's more complicated
than I can imagine.

625
00:46:21,414 --> 00:46:24,765
That's a lovely brooch
you're wearing, miss.

626
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,261
I reckon it could be one of
Isaac Greenberg's designs.

627
00:46:27,336 --> 00:46:31,197
I'll, uh, get the book
and see if I can tell.

628
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:40,478
Where did you get this?

629
00:46:40,552 --> 00:46:43,684
I've had it for ages. It was
in the family dress-up box.

630
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:50,152
Don't you see? Ash bought
the brooch for Ellen.

631
00:46:50,217 --> 00:46:54,920
The clasped hands. Here
in Whitby. We knew that.

632
00:46:54,986 --> 00:46:56,961
And this for Christabel.
Oh, right.

633
00:46:57,034 --> 00:46:59,303
So while he was buying this,
he said, um,

634
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:01,541
"Yes, I'll have the eternal
embrace for my wife."

635
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:05,408
No, he wouldn't have said anything.
He would have just bought the brooch.

636
00:47:05,483 --> 00:47:08,166
Christabel would have seen.
It was accepted between them.

637
00:47:08,235 --> 00:47:11,017
Are you writing
fiction now?

638
00:47:13,323 --> 00:47:15,298
Maybe.

639
00:47:16,811 --> 00:47:19,178
I'm having fun.

640
00:47:19,243 --> 00:47:21,153
Are you?

641
00:47:22,123 --> 00:47:24,098
Yes, I suppose I am.

642
00:47:25,836 --> 00:47:28,225
Don't grimace when you say
it. It's more convincing.

643
00:47:29,228 --> 00:47:31,749
I suppose
I can be a touch...

644
00:47:31,821 --> 00:47:35,301
empirical at times.

645
00:47:35,373 --> 00:47:37,348
Just a touch.

646
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:41,356
Hey, you wanna go for
a walk or something?

647
00:47:41,422 --> 00:47:43,276
I mean,
out in the hills.

648
00:47:43,341 --> 00:47:46,244
For sure it's earlier than
the death of Victoria's Albert.

649
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:49,930
Probably late '50s.
1860s maybe.

650
00:47:49,998 --> 00:47:51,973
1859?

651
00:47:53,517 --> 00:47:55,492
Ish?

652
00:48:06,576 --> 00:48:09,706
I think we're getting
near Thomason Falls.

653
00:48:10,767 --> 00:48:12,622
Cropper mentions it...
Mortimer Cropper?

654
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:16,583
Yeah, Ash's biographer.
All-purpose asshole.

655
00:48:16,657 --> 00:48:18,893
He's literally trekked
every step of Ash's life.

656
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,546
He's happy to tell you that
too. More than happy, I'm sure.

657
00:48:21,617 --> 00:48:24,267
You know him, huh?

658
00:48:38,322 --> 00:48:40,777
That is beautiful.

659
00:48:43,762 --> 00:48:46,511
Maud. What?

660
00:48:46,578 --> 00:48:49,677
I think Christabel
did come here.

661
00:48:51,316 --> 00:48:53,901
Listen.

662
00:48:53,971 --> 00:48:57,998
"Three elements combined
to make the fourth.

663
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,363
"But above the water and
the light, together made...

664
00:49:01,428 --> 00:49:03,980
a halo in the darkened cave."

665
00:49:04,052 --> 00:49:07,665
That poem's dated
1859, July.

666
00:49:09,461 --> 00:49:11,828
See if there's
a cave behind it.

667
00:49:11,892 --> 00:49:14,162
That might be
all the proof we need.

668
00:49:20,181 --> 00:49:22,123
Ah...

669
00:49:22,197 --> 00:49:26,223
I know this is an awfully repressed
sort of English thing to say,

670
00:49:26,293 --> 00:49:28,268
but what the hell
are you doing?

671
00:49:28,342 --> 00:49:30,164
There's only one way
to find out.

672
00:49:36,534 --> 00:49:39,469
Of course, we could
have just asked someone.

673
00:50:03,065 --> 00:50:06,960
Whoo! Maud! Maud!

674
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:09,652
I found it!

675
00:51:55,394 --> 00:51:58,526
Your hands are shaking.

676
00:51:58,594 --> 00:52:00,536
Are you afraid?

677
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:03,577
No.

678
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:06,520
A little.

679
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:39,836
"These are and were there.

680
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:44,319
"The garden and the tree,
the serpent at its root.

681
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:49,059
"The fruit of gold, the woman
in the shadow of the boughs.

682
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:53,087
"The running water
and the grassy space.

683
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:56,323
They are and were there."

684
00:52:59,782 --> 00:53:01,790
I don't mind that.

685
00:53:04,776 --> 00:53:08,322
See, you could grow
to like Ash.

686
00:53:08,392 --> 00:53:12,003
Yes.

687
00:53:12,071 --> 00:53:14,439
He's sort of a soft-core
misogynist.

688
00:53:24,361 --> 00:53:27,144
Why do you always
tie your hair up like that?

689
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:33,985
It has to do
with Fergus Wolfe mostly.

690
00:53:34,058 --> 00:53:37,190
Fergus?
How to do with Fergus?

691
00:53:40,043 --> 00:53:44,004
When we met,
he drove me mad quoting Yeats.

692
00:53:44,075 --> 00:53:47,490
"Who could love you for yourself
alone and not your yellow hair?"

693
00:53:47,563 --> 00:53:49,603
Yes.

694
00:53:49,674 --> 00:53:53,473
And then I was accused once by my
sister feminists at a conference...

695
00:53:53,548 --> 00:53:55,719
of dyeing it
to attract men.

696
00:53:55,787 --> 00:53:57,827
Really?
Yes.

697
00:53:57,899 --> 00:54:01,096
So I shaved it off,
all of it.

698
00:54:01,164 --> 00:54:04,198
And did he?

699
00:54:04,268 --> 00:54:08,424
Did who what? Fergus love
you without your yellow hair?

700
00:54:08,493 --> 00:54:10,795
No.

701
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:12,771
We thought of that.

702
00:54:14,189 --> 00:54:17,321
We drove each other mad.
I don't even like him,

703
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,204
but I can't seem to...
Freud.

704
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,343
"On the other side of attraction
lies repulsion."

705
00:54:23,758 --> 00:54:25,733
Or was that Calvin Klein?

706
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:34,950
- Do you believe that?
- Uh, I wouldn't know.

707
00:54:35,023 --> 00:54:39,879
I don't really allow myself to do that
Ash/Christabel grand passion kind of thing.

708
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:41,773
Allow?
Yeah.

709
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,931
Jealousy, obsession, all that.
Not anymore.

710
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:49,295
You're lucky then.

711
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,288
It all gets so...
just such a tangle.

712
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,231
It's a tangle
most people want.

713
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,696
Not me though.

714
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:03,787
My antics made
a lot of people unhappy.

715
00:55:05,297 --> 00:55:07,534
One horribly so.

716
00:55:11,537 --> 00:55:13,447
For me,

717
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:20,110
whenever I feel
anything for anyone, I...

718
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:22,283
I go cold all over.

719
00:55:22,354 --> 00:55:27,145
- What makes you do that?
- Fear, I suppose.

720
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:32,653
Fear of being burned up...
by love.

721
00:55:33,972 --> 00:55:36,841
Listen to us.

722
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:42,252
Yes. Aren't we just maudlin?

723
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,682
Maud, you should
let your hair out.

724
00:55:45,748 --> 00:55:48,498
You should let it breathe.
And don't do the ice thing,

725
00:55:48,564 --> 00:55:50,931
'cause you have nothing
to worry about from me.

726
00:55:50,996 --> 00:55:54,543
Christabel said,
"Fear all men."

727
00:55:54,614 --> 00:55:57,930
Well, Christabel
didn't know me.

728
00:55:59,477 --> 00:56:01,649
I don't want to take
anything from you.

729
00:56:03,446 --> 00:56:07,790
So, then, we're both...
perfectly safe.

730
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:10,034
Right.

731
00:56:56,602 --> 00:56:59,188
How can we bear it?

732
00:56:59,258 --> 00:57:02,193
Every day
we will have less.

733
00:57:09,243 --> 00:57:11,764
Would you rather
have had nothing?

734
00:57:11,835 --> 00:57:13,690
No.

735
00:57:13,756 --> 00:57:17,946
I thank God that if there
had to be a dragon it was you.

736
00:58:04,543 --> 00:58:07,227
Wait. Wait.

737
00:58:14,113 --> 00:58:18,455
- No. I was just trying to get out
from under the covers. - No. No.

738
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:22,107
This is... We shouldn't be
doing this. It's dangerous.

739
00:58:24,674 --> 00:58:28,023
Well, I really... No, because
I like you. I like you a lot.

740
00:58:28,098 --> 00:58:32,375
I just don't want
to blow it here, and...

741
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:34,751
Well, it doesn't matter
to me, honestly.

742
00:58:34,817 --> 00:58:37,120
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

743
00:58:43,875 --> 00:58:47,804
Sorry. I think
we're probably just...

744
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:51,007
In these cramped quarters.
It was a mistake.

745
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:56,474
Maud. Maud!

746
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,057
I didn't mean that.

747
00:59:30,631 --> 00:59:33,730
Let's not beat
the thing dead.

748
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:36,766
It happened, it's over
and we're adults.

749
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:39,491
Speak for yourself.

750
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:43,586
I can't imagine what you're like
after you actually sleep with someone.

751
00:59:47,753 --> 00:59:52,706
Maud, I think
that you are very...

752
00:59:52,776 --> 00:59:55,110
You know?

753
00:59:55,177 --> 00:59:57,446
No, I don't know.

754
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:03,172
So, what, we're friends
now, is that it?

755
01:00:05,674 --> 01:00:08,608
Yeah. That's a lot.

756
01:00:08,681 --> 01:00:10,569
No, I agree.
It's fine.

757
01:00:10,634 --> 01:00:15,271
Yeah. It's perfect.

758
01:00:15,339 --> 01:00:18,951
Anyway, we're getting
off the track here.

759
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:22,248
We came to investigate
them, not us.

760
01:00:34,445 --> 01:00:38,154
So what ever happened to
Blanche? Blanche drowned.

761
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:40,075
Oh.

762
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:44,455
Where was Christabel? We
don't know where she was.

763
01:00:44,525 --> 01:00:46,761
The year before's
a bit blank too.

764
01:00:46,829 --> 01:00:49,546
You don't know where she was
that entire year?

765
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:52,296
There's some speculation
that she went to France,

766
01:00:52,366 --> 01:00:54,569
but I have nothing
to support that.

767
01:00:56,301 --> 01:01:01,834
Okay, so... Christabel comes
here with Ash and then disappears.

768
01:01:01,902 --> 01:01:03,844
On paper, at least.

769
01:01:03,918 --> 01:01:07,660
Yes.
And Blanche suicides.

770
01:01:07,726 --> 01:01:10,061
Jesus.

771
01:01:17,392 --> 01:01:19,628
What are you doing?

772
01:01:19,695 --> 01:01:22,859
It's a poem. I've been
writing it as I've watched you.

773
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:25,000
You're not pleased with it?

774
01:01:25,072 --> 01:01:29,448
On the contrary. I think it perfectly
expresses the joy I have felt with you.

775
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:31,659
Then why that?

776
01:01:31,727 --> 01:01:34,631
These feelings...
I want them to survive.

777
01:01:34,705 --> 01:01:37,607
I know I can never
declare all this...

778
01:01:37,681 --> 01:01:40,431
this love.

779
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:45,134
There. I've said it. I know it
cannot be declared to the world.

780
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,136
What I may do is scatter
these words from the train...

781
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:50,382
and hope that
they somehow take root.

782
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:55,087
They will flourish.
I swear it.

783
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:45,266
So... what next?

784
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,276
I mean, for you.

785
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,685
I suppose I'll check
through the archives...

786
01:02:49,751 --> 01:02:52,566
and see if there's any clue at all where
Christabel might have been that year.

787
01:02:52,631 --> 01:02:54,704
Good.

788
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:58,451
I guess I'll just, uh...

789
01:02:58,518 --> 01:03:01,040
hell, I don't know...

790
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,981
go look up shit
on the microfiche.

791
01:03:04,056 --> 01:03:05,998
Suffer over you.

792
01:03:06,072 --> 01:03:08,461
Good-bye.

793
01:03:08,536 --> 01:03:10,446
See ya.

794
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:19,449
Lost your way?
Don't do tours here.

795
01:04:19,518 --> 01:04:21,819
Sir George Bailey?
Who wants to know?

796
01:04:21,886 --> 01:04:24,375
Professor Mortimer Cropper,
curator of the Stan Collection,

797
01:04:24,447 --> 01:04:27,229
Robert De Leon University,
Harmony City, New Mexico.

798
01:04:27,295 --> 01:04:29,270
And this is Dr. Wolfe.
Good morning.

799
01:04:29,343 --> 01:04:32,092
I'm a busy man.
My wife's ill.

800
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,810
I can quite understand
that, sir.

801
01:04:34,879 --> 01:04:37,749
Sources have led me to believe
that you may be in possession...

802
01:04:37,824 --> 01:04:42,613
of some documentation
by Randolph Henry Ash.

803
01:04:42,688 --> 01:04:45,056
Whoa.
Don't shoot, please.

804
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,674
Get off my land.

805
01:04:47,745 --> 01:04:50,494
Do you have any idea
what we're talking about here?

806
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,147
Do you? Do you have
any idea how much...

807
01:04:53,218 --> 01:04:55,770
such pieces,
if they existed,

808
01:04:55,841 --> 01:04:58,558
how much
they would be worth?

809
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,567
Worth?

810
01:05:08,738 --> 01:05:11,259
Do you mind if we swing
past the university?

811
01:05:11,331 --> 01:05:13,337
Bit of unfinished
business.

812
01:05:13,411 --> 01:05:17,339
Miss Bailey, I presume.
The accomplice.

813
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:19,712
The very same.

814
01:05:19,779 --> 01:05:23,456
Good God, you're
like Bonnie and Clyde.

815
01:05:23,523 --> 01:05:25,695
Come on.
I need a picture of her.

816
01:05:25,763 --> 01:05:28,698
I've never seen you
like this. Just go.

817
01:05:28,772 --> 01:05:32,034
Take the Porsche
and go.

818
01:05:59,878 --> 01:06:01,733
Fergus, what?

819
01:06:03,591 --> 01:06:08,544
Uh, if Fergus went out to get Indian food,
I'm gonna... I'm gonna feel really stupid.

820
01:06:08,613 --> 01:06:11,997
No, he didn't.

821
01:06:12,071 --> 01:06:14,461
India wouldn't be
far enough away, actually.

822
01:06:18,152 --> 01:06:20,192
Come inside. I'll explain.

823
01:06:20,264 --> 01:06:24,257
You sure? I mean,
about me coming in.

824
01:06:24,327 --> 01:06:27,874
Yes, very.

825
01:06:27,944 --> 01:06:30,945
So I left Fergus a message
from Seal Court,

826
01:06:31,016 --> 01:06:33,864
which apparently
put him on our trail,

827
01:06:33,929 --> 01:06:38,304
and he came here looking for answers...
he and Cropper from the sound of it.

828
01:06:38,377 --> 01:06:40,963
So that was Cropper's
car outside?

829
01:06:41,034 --> 01:06:43,423
I think Fergus
has found something.

830
01:06:43,498 --> 01:06:45,920
He's been spooking
around the museum,

831
01:06:45,995 --> 01:06:49,540
sending out
a bunch of faxes.

832
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:54,084
I wouldn't be
so quick to do that.

833
01:06:54,155 --> 01:06:56,489
Yeah.

834
01:06:57,899 --> 01:07:01,794
The British Museum
fax log sheet.

835
01:07:01,868 --> 01:07:04,650
"To the University of Muntz
from Fergus Wolfe.

836
01:07:04,715 --> 01:07:08,261
"Subject: Christabel LaMotte.
Information on LaMotte genealogy.

837
01:07:08,332 --> 01:07:12,424
Request loan of journal
of Sabine de Concasse."

838
01:07:12,492 --> 01:07:14,630
Unfortunately for Fergus,
we have to log our faxes.

839
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:17,636
You're shameless.

840
01:07:28,942 --> 01:07:31,462
So what are we
gonna do now?

841
01:07:31,533 --> 01:07:34,795
We gonna try to beat 'em
to France, or...

842
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:40,587
or are we just
gonna stare at each other?

843
01:07:40,654 --> 01:07:42,793
That is the question,
isn't it?

844
01:07:42,862 --> 01:07:44,717
Mm-hmm.

845
01:07:44,782 --> 01:07:47,271
- I have another one for you.
- What's that?

846
01:07:47,343 --> 01:07:49,547
What are you really
doing here?

847
01:07:49,615 --> 01:07:52,397
Well, I, uh...

848
01:07:57,104 --> 01:07:58,958
I needed to see your face.

849
01:08:06,193 --> 01:08:10,700
I just want to let you know
that whatever happened in Whitby,

850
01:08:10,768 --> 01:08:14,511
which unfortunately
was not much,

851
01:08:17,137 --> 01:08:20,486
is not because
anything that you did.

852
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:24,465
Not at all.

853
01:08:27,058 --> 01:08:29,841
I just didn't want
to jump into something.

854
01:08:30,995 --> 01:08:35,632
I mean, I did
and I do... want to.

855
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,825
Badly.

856
01:08:42,196 --> 01:08:45,229
I just didn't
want to mess this up.

857
01:08:48,276 --> 01:08:51,592
And I just want to see...

858
01:08:51,668 --> 01:08:57,036
I want to see if there's
an us in you and me.

859
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:04,334
Would-Would you like that?

860
01:09:13,495 --> 01:09:15,860
I'll take that
as a yes.

861
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:48,656
Ah, oui. Excusez-moi.
Nous sommes confreres.

862
01:09:48,728 --> 01:09:50,583
When will she be back?

863
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,677
Could you check for us?

864
01:10:20,187 --> 01:10:22,839
- She will return on Thursday.
- Okay.

865
01:10:22,908 --> 01:10:24,763
Au revoir.
Merci.

866
01:10:24,828 --> 01:10:29,716
You and your shoplifting, huh?
I can't take you anywhere.

867
01:10:42,685 --> 01:10:47,356
Since I wrote to you last,
I've made another discovery.

868
01:10:47,422 --> 01:10:49,788
"Amongst Sabine's papers
was her journal...

869
01:10:49,854 --> 01:10:53,716
"in which she writes about LaMotte's
visit to Brittany in 1859...

870
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:57,086
and the subsequent arrival
of a mysterious visitor."

871
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:04,224
I know how things are.
I wish to help you.

872
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:06,942
You know how things are, do you?
Tell me, Cousin Sabine,

873
01:12:07,011 --> 01:12:10,329
how do you think
things are with me?

874
01:12:10,405 --> 01:12:12,444
I'm a grown woman.
You are a girl.

875
01:12:12,516 --> 01:12:14,688
I do not desire
any help from you.

876
01:12:22,692 --> 01:12:26,109
Christabel's condition
became worse...

877
01:12:26,181 --> 01:12:29,629
after she received word
from London...

878
01:12:29,702 --> 01:12:32,964
that her close friend
had died.

879
01:13:06,152 --> 01:13:09,000
She left England
because she was pregnant,

880
01:13:09,065 --> 01:13:10,921
and Blanche
committed suicide.

881
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:18,464
What happened to the baby?

882
01:13:18,537 --> 01:13:20,926
It must have been stillborn.

883
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:22,856
Or died.

884
01:13:22,922 --> 01:13:25,061
Maybe it was taken in
by nuns or a local family.

885
01:13:25,131 --> 01:13:28,326
And brought up here.

886
01:13:28,394 --> 01:13:32,290
I'd like to think that,
but I wonder.

887
01:13:32,363 --> 01:13:36,390
- You wonder what?
- I don't know. I just...

888
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:42,176
She comes here alone, hears
that Blanche has killed herself.

889
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,357
She's pregnant, distraught.

890
01:13:47,179 --> 01:13:49,034
Geez.

891
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,555
I mean, I've no
evidence for it.

892
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:54,214
Can you imagine
how she must have felt?

893
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:58,117
Yes, I can.

894
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:12,264
So when do we see
Christabel next?

895
01:14:12,334 --> 01:14:16,557
Autumn, 1860, in her
references to the Vestal Lights.

896
01:14:16,622 --> 01:14:20,397
It was a group of women who used to
meet with mediums on a regular basis.

897
01:14:20,463 --> 01:14:24,391
Really? You know, Ash hated
spiritualists. Pretty openly.

898
01:14:24,463 --> 01:14:27,279
You think that's a connection
we're tracking down?

899
01:14:27,344 --> 01:14:29,253
I don't know.

900
01:14:38,257 --> 01:14:41,737
Please, make a circle
with your hands.

901
01:14:47,025 --> 01:14:48,880
Close your eyes.

902
01:14:54,033 --> 01:14:57,099
White earth. Valley.

903
01:14:57,169 --> 01:15:00,333
A waterfall.

904
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:03,435
A child. Love.

905
01:15:03,506 --> 01:15:07,817
Two people. Deception.

906
01:15:07,891 --> 01:15:12,266
Letters. Two people.

907
01:15:13,651 --> 01:15:16,913
Words. Death.

908
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:19,466
What have you done?

909
01:15:19,539 --> 01:15:22,223
A field.

910
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:25,139
Where is the child?

911
01:15:30,196 --> 01:15:33,972
What have you done
with the child?

912
01:15:34,037 --> 01:15:37,234
You have made
a murderess of me.

913
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:47,565
"I understood at the time
that Mr. Ash was inquiring...

914
01:15:47,638 --> 01:15:50,932
"after the spirit of
a departed child of his own,

915
01:15:50,997 --> 01:15:53,867
"but I am told that
this could not be the case...

916
01:15:53,942 --> 01:15:56,561
as Mr. Ash is childless."

917
01:16:01,046 --> 01:16:06,098
Was there any mention
of Heloise in your research?

918
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:09,942
I don't know...
nor do I care.

919
01:16:10,008 --> 01:16:12,658
Look, I've got to get back.

920
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:19,096
What's going on? Nothing. I'm just
tired, that's all, so I should...

921
01:16:19,161 --> 01:16:21,430
Come on.
What's wrong, seriously?

922
01:16:22,968 --> 01:16:26,352
I don't actually want to
discover anything else about them.

923
01:16:26,425 --> 01:16:29,208
You know?

924
01:16:29,274 --> 01:16:32,438
I'm finding things out
that are just...

925
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:36,248
It's horrible when you think about
it really... men and women together.

926
01:16:38,585 --> 01:16:41,368
She gave up her life,
didn't she?

927
01:16:41,434 --> 01:16:44,729
A perfectly decent life that I've always
admired. And for what? For nothing.

928
01:16:44,794 --> 01:16:47,315
No. Not nothing.

929
01:16:47,387 --> 01:16:52,242
Oh, really? For what then? A child who
died, a lover drowned, and to what end?

930
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:55,992
She and Ash,
my own parents...

931
01:16:56,058 --> 01:16:59,255
and every relationship
I've ever had...

932
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:04,212
It's all doomed. We can't seem to
help but just tear each other apart.

933
01:17:04,284 --> 01:17:08,278
Well, what about us? You didn't
include us. What about that?

934
01:17:09,404 --> 01:17:11,259
Look, I...

935
01:17:12,764 --> 01:17:15,132
I can't think about
anything right now.

936
01:17:18,077 --> 01:17:19,932
So, okay.

937
01:17:19,997 --> 01:17:23,194
So this is the, uh... this is
the icy pull-back part then, huh?

938
01:17:23,261 --> 01:17:27,223
- What? - You know, you get close,
you pull away, you get...

939
01:17:27,294 --> 01:17:29,563
I mean, this is part
of the pattern, right?

940
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:33,852
- What are you talking about?
- Your fear of men mantra from Yorkshire.

941
01:17:33,918 --> 01:17:36,439
That's what
I'm talking about.

942
01:17:36,511 --> 01:17:39,478
I get it. It's cool. If that's the way
you play it, that's the way play it.

943
01:17:39,551 --> 01:17:41,885
Do you honestly believe that?

944
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:47,035
Is that what you think
this is to me? A game? Is it?

945
01:17:51,424 --> 01:17:55,100
Well, finally, then, all this talk of
us really comes to nothing, doesn't it?

946
01:17:55,168 --> 01:17:57,885
Yes, I guess you're right.
It's nothing.

947
01:18:33,412 --> 01:18:36,346
Dear Professor Blackadder:

948
01:18:36,419 --> 01:18:39,648
I did try to tell you
about my discovery before...

949
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:42,530
but found that I couldn't.

950
01:18:42,596 --> 01:18:46,076
Please read these two letters,

951
01:18:46,148 --> 01:18:49,312
and you will begin
to understand.

952
01:18:49,381 --> 01:18:52,829
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

953
01:18:52,901 --> 01:18:56,349
Sincerely, Roland Michell.

954
01:19:11,814 --> 01:19:15,939
And it's well documented that Ellen
Ash set a box on Ash's coffin...

955
01:19:16,007 --> 01:19:18,080
a kind of sealed container.

956
01:19:18,151 --> 01:19:20,191
We'd always imagined
it was just trinkets,

957
01:19:20,264 --> 01:19:23,809
but in the light of Michell's discovery, who
knows what treasures might be buried there.

958
01:19:23,879 --> 01:19:26,661
That box is mine, isn't it?
It's my property.

959
01:19:26,727 --> 01:19:29,411
Once you get it from Lord Ash,
it's absolutely yours.

960
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,683
Until then,
we keep it a secret.

961
01:19:31,751 --> 01:19:34,469
Any discovery amongst
Lord Ash's things,

962
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:38,180
and, uh...
and I purchase it from you.

963
01:19:38,248 --> 01:19:41,063
It's all above board,
no one the wiser.

964
01:19:41,129 --> 01:19:43,234
Cropper, are you
absolutely sure of that?

965
01:19:43,305 --> 01:19:45,694
Listen.
Uh, where is it?

966
01:19:45,769 --> 01:19:47,809
Yeah. "I place this
letter in his hands,

967
01:19:47,881 --> 01:19:50,215
"and if ghouls
dig it up again,

968
01:19:50,281 --> 01:19:53,511
then perhaps justice will be done
when I am not here to see it."

969
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:08,199
Dear Madam: We are older now
and my fires at last are out.

970
01:20:08,267 --> 01:20:11,912
I know that you are
more than aware of my name,

971
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:15,525
but I find you must see it
in print one last time.

972
01:20:15,596 --> 01:20:19,873
It has been made known to me that
your husband is near to death,

973
01:20:19,947 --> 01:20:24,584
so I have writ down,
for his eyes only, some things.

974
01:20:24,651 --> 01:20:29,541
I find I cannot say what things
and have sealed the letter.

975
01:20:29,613 --> 01:20:33,834
If you wish to read it,
it is in your hands,

976
01:20:33,901 --> 01:20:37,894
though I must hope that he
will see it first and decide.

977
01:20:37,965 --> 01:20:43,050
I have done great harm,
though I meant none to you.

978
01:21:35,089 --> 01:21:38,505
I'll see they get back,
no questions asked.

979
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:42,700
You're more enterprising
than I gave you credit for.

980
01:21:42,771 --> 01:21:44,777
Was there a compliment
in there somewhere?

981
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:47,917
Hmm? Yes, probably.

982
01:21:50,003 --> 01:21:53,800
What I can't believe is Fergus
Wolfe conniving with Cropper.

983
01:21:53,876 --> 01:21:55,949
I thought I was
a better judge of men.

984
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:59,434
Well, see, that's where you went wrong.
You gave him credit for being one.

985
01:22:02,132 --> 01:22:04,815
Thank you.

986
01:22:08,212 --> 01:22:10,700
Hi.
Hi.

987
01:22:10,772 --> 01:22:13,194
Thank you for coming. Sure.

988
01:22:13,269 --> 01:22:17,296
I believe
that may be her.

989
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:20,465
I, uh... I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry.

990
01:22:20,534 --> 01:22:23,981
No, listen. I lost it
totally. It wasn't you.

991
01:22:24,053 --> 01:22:28,244
So, why don't we all
talk some strategy?

992
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:30,928
Let me introduce you
to, uh... All right.

993
01:22:30,998 --> 01:22:34,991
Professor Blackadder, Paola,
this is Dr. Bailey.

994
01:22:35,062 --> 01:22:37,452
Maud.
Maud.

995
01:22:37,527 --> 01:22:39,796
How do you do?

996
01:22:39,863 --> 01:22:44,566
So, do we really think that Cropper's capable
of something like this, of robbing a grave?

997
01:22:49,688 --> 01:22:52,754
It's creepy, the idea
of opening a grave.

998
01:22:52,824 --> 01:22:54,679
Let's just keep going.

999
01:22:54,744 --> 01:22:57,908
Jesus.

1000
01:22:57,976 --> 01:23:01,292
"The moping owl does to the
moon complain." Complain.

1001
01:23:03,544 --> 01:23:05,781
Are you ready?

1002
01:23:05,849 --> 01:23:08,915
Yeah.
Hold the light up.

1003
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:27,832
Fergus! Fergus!
Is that it?

1004
01:23:27,898 --> 01:23:31,161
Yes. It's gotta be.

1005
01:23:31,227 --> 01:23:34,489
I found it, Fergus.
I found it.

1006
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:45,591
Oh, my God.
I found it, Fergus.

1007
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:47,482
Great!

1008
01:23:48,989 --> 01:23:51,859
Hey, Cropper!
Cropper!

1009
01:23:57,789 --> 01:24:00,472
This has nothing
to do with you people.

1010
01:24:08,638 --> 01:24:12,151
Wait! Get off of me! Get off of me!

1011
01:24:12,222 --> 01:24:15,037
No you don't!

1012
01:24:15,102 --> 01:24:18,004
Traitor! Bloody conniver! Please!

1013
01:24:21,535 --> 01:24:23,225
Wait!

1014
01:24:24,895 --> 01:24:28,572
What are you doin'?

1015
01:24:42,754 --> 01:24:46,331
Oh, shit.

1016
01:24:50,241 --> 01:24:52,346
Are you sure
we should be doing this?

1017
01:24:52,417 --> 01:24:54,872
I told Blackadder
we'd just take a look...

1018
01:24:54,945 --> 01:24:57,465
before we handed it over
to the museum.

1019
01:24:57,537 --> 01:24:59,927
Can you hold that there?

1020
01:25:16,357 --> 01:25:18,811
Maud, look at this.

1021
01:25:33,989 --> 01:25:36,128
It's her handwriting.

1022
01:26:03,303 --> 01:26:06,565
"My dear, my dear:

1023
01:26:06,632 --> 01:26:08,934
"They tell me
you are very ill.

1024
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,750
"Perhaps I am wrong
to disturb you at this time...

1025
01:26:11,816 --> 01:26:15,461
"with unseasonable memories,

1026
01:26:15,528 --> 01:26:20,679
"but I find I have, after all,
a thing which I must tell you.

1027
01:26:22,313 --> 01:26:24,866
"You will say it should have
been told 20 years ago,

1028
01:26:24,937 --> 01:26:27,785
"but I could, or would, not.

1029
01:26:29,193 --> 01:26:31,714
"You have a daughter...

1030
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:35,588
"who is well and married...

1031
01:26:35,658 --> 01:26:38,658
"and the mother
of a beautiful boy.

1032
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:41,381
"I've sent you a picture.

1033
01:26:46,188 --> 01:26:49,254
"You will see she resembles
both her parents,

1034
01:26:49,323 --> 01:26:52,804
"neither of whom she knows
to be her parent.

1035
01:26:52,875 --> 01:26:58,243
"When I said at that terrible séance
that you had made a murderess of me,

1036
01:26:58,316 --> 01:27:02,888
"I was speaking of poor Blanche,
who then torments me daily,

1037
01:27:04,108 --> 01:27:07,458
"and I thought,
'Let him think so then...

1038
01:27:07,533 --> 01:27:09,954
"if he knows me so little.'

1039
01:27:11,884 --> 01:27:14,056
"I had a secret fear, you see.

1040
01:27:14,125 --> 01:27:16,460
"I was afraid that
you would wish to take her...

1041
01:27:16,525 --> 01:27:18,859
"you and your wife...
for your own.

1042
01:27:18,925 --> 01:27:21,129
But I could not let her go."

1043
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:24,329
Over here.

1044
01:27:24,398 --> 01:27:26,373
And so I hid her from you...

1045
01:27:26,446 --> 01:27:28,814
and you from her.

1046
01:27:30,254 --> 01:27:33,604
She loves her adoptive
parents most deeply.

1047
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,167
Me, she does not love.

1048
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:41,258
So I am punished now, living at Seal
Court with them and watching her grow.

1049
01:27:41,328 --> 01:27:44,492
I have been angry
for so long...

1050
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,600
with all of us,

1051
01:27:46,672 --> 01:27:48,876
and now, near the end,

1052
01:27:48,944 --> 01:27:52,457
I think of you again
with clear love.

1053
01:27:52,528 --> 01:27:55,376
Did we not...

1054
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:59,631
Did you not flame
and I catch fire?

1055
01:27:59,697 --> 01:28:02,796
Was not the love
that we found...

1056
01:28:02,865 --> 01:28:05,549
worth the tempest
that it brewed?

1057
01:28:05,617 --> 01:28:09,262
I feel it was.
I know it was.

1058
01:28:09,329 --> 01:28:13,868
"If you are able or willing, please
send me a sign that you have read this.

1059
01:28:13,937 --> 01:28:18,194
"I dare not ask
if you forgive.

1060
01:28:19,282 --> 01:28:21,454
Christabel LaMotte."

1061
01:28:24,531 --> 01:28:27,346
Ash had never read this.

1062
01:28:27,411 --> 01:28:30,193
He never knew
he had a child.

1063
01:28:30,259 --> 01:28:33,641
You're descended from both
Christabel and Ash.

1064
01:28:35,859 --> 01:28:39,537
My God.

1065
01:28:39,604 --> 01:28:45,136
All these clues,
they're for you.

1066
01:28:46,996 --> 01:28:48,939
For us.

1067
01:29:01,877 --> 01:29:03,819
You're so beautiful.

1068
01:29:33,017 --> 01:29:38,068
There are things that happen,
not spoken or written of.

1069
01:29:38,137 --> 01:29:40,723
A poet walked out
one summer's day...

1070
01:29:40,793 --> 01:29:44,055
seeking forgiveness
from a love long lost.

1071
01:29:45,497 --> 01:29:48,083
He found
something else instead.

1072
01:29:49,465 --> 01:29:52,117
This is how it was.

1073
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:03,025
Morning.
Good morning.

1074
01:30:03,098 --> 01:30:04,953
What's your name?

1075
01:30:05,019 --> 01:30:09,242
May Bailey, but I have
another name I don't like.

1076
01:30:09,308 --> 01:30:14,096
Do you? What's that?

1077
01:30:14,172 --> 01:30:16,441
Maya Thomason Bailey.

1078
01:30:21,756 --> 01:30:23,666
Well...

1079
01:30:25,885 --> 01:30:29,627
Maya was the, uh...

1080
01:30:29,693 --> 01:30:32,278
the mother of Hermes,

1081
01:30:32,348 --> 01:30:34,520
and I know a waterfall
called Thomason.

1082
01:30:34,589 --> 01:30:37,753
A waterfall? Really?
Yes.

1083
01:30:37,821 --> 01:30:43,005
In Yorkshire. With a lovely
cave hidden behind it.

1084
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:46,877
Where do you live?

1085
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,830
I live in that house
down there.

1086
01:30:48,895 --> 01:30:52,441
And my mother lives there
and my father...

1087
01:30:52,511 --> 01:30:54,453
and my two brothers.

1088
01:30:54,527 --> 01:30:57,080
Oh, and my Aunt Christabel too.

1089
01:30:58,783 --> 01:31:01,304
Yes, I think
I know your mother.

1090
01:31:04,896 --> 01:31:07,165
You have
the true look of her.

1091
01:31:07,232 --> 01:31:12,120
No one else says that.
I think I look like my father.

1092
01:31:13,984 --> 01:31:16,373
You look like
your father too.

1093
01:31:18,977 --> 01:31:21,148
Can you make daisy chains?

1094
01:31:21,217 --> 01:31:23,967
Yes.

1095
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:29,537
Yes, I'll make you a crown.

1096
01:31:31,297 --> 01:31:35,935
But, um... will you
give me a lock of your hair?

1097
01:31:37,666 --> 01:31:40,219
Like fairy story.

1098
01:31:41,987 --> 01:31:44,126
Just so.

1099
01:31:54,756 --> 01:31:58,531
Now, would you
take this note...

1100
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,800
to your aunt.

1101
01:32:02,372 --> 01:32:05,155
Tell her that
you saw a poet...

1102
01:32:05,221 --> 01:32:07,489
who was coming
to meet her...

1103
01:32:07,558 --> 01:32:09,696
but met you instead.

1104
01:32:09,765 --> 01:32:11,805
I'll try to remember.

1105
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:15,451
Thank you.
