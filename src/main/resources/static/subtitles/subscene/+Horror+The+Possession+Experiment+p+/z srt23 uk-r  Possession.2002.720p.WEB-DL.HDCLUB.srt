00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,518
I deliver perfection...
and don't brag about it! :D

4
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,130
<i>They say that women change</i>

5
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,591
<i>'Tis so</i>

6
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:53,637
<i>But you are ever constant</i>
<i>In your changefulness</i>

7
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,974
<i>Like that still thread</i>
<i>Of falling river</i>

8
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:01,311
<i>One from source to last embrace</i>
<i>In the still pool</i>

9
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,567
<i>Ever-renewed and ever-moving on</i>
<i>From first to last</i>

10
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,571
<i>From first to last</i>
<i>A myriad of water drops</i>

11
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,448
<i>And you, I love you for it</i>

12
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,495
<i>Are the force that moves</i>
<i>And holds the form</i>

13
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,457
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've just heard a snippet...

14
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:29,339
...from one of only two copies of this
poem by Mr. Randolph Henry Ash...

15
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,968
...poet laureate to Queen Victoria
herself.

16
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:39,433
And this gorgeous ode to his nuptial
bliss, written in his own hand...

17
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,810
...begins our bidding today.

18
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,942
May we start the bidding,
please, at 40,000 pounds?

19
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,554
- Bit of an old monster.
- Yeah.

20
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,973
But an important monster.

21
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,601
- It's Randolph Ash's.
- Yes.

22
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,853
Who are you with again?

23
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:29,066
- I'm Roland Michell.
- Who?

24
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:33,362
- Professor Blackadder's assistant.
- Isn't that Dr. Wolfe?

25
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:37,533
Was. Fergus got the lectureship
at St. John's over me.

26
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:39,493
Of course he did.

27
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:45,958
Yes, Dr. Wolfe mentioned you.
You're that American who's over here.

28
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:52,965
I'm sure there are others.
After all, you are our favorite colony.

29
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:03,392
Any further offers on 10,000 pounds?
11,000 pounds.

30
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:07,187
So when do your little suffragist
trinkets come up?

31
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,065
Look! Maud, it's Mortimer Cropper.

32
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,485
- That's someone you should know.
- You know him?

33
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,364
Of him. Suffered through a lecture,
that sort of thing.

34
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,366
He's a voracious collector.

35
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:24,788
Yes, his penchant for conquest is well
documented. A very male quality.

36
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:30,335
- It's vulgar, but I have to introduce myself.
- All right.

37
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,005
Damn.

38
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:38,844
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you.

39
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,221
Professor Cropper? Fergus Wolfe.

40
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,100
We spoke actually after one
of your papers at Trinity.

41
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,979
- You wouldn't remember.
- Sorry, I don't. Nice coat.

42
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,939
- Thank you.
- You're with?

43
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,482
James Blackadder.

44
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,485
One of his boys from
the British Museum.

45
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,323
Hello. Hildebrand Ash, man of leisure.

46
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,866
Hello.

47
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,620
I don't know why Blackadder
comes to these things.

48
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,663
He hasn't got any money.

49
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:12,127
He's Irish, you see.
He enjoys feeling persecuted.

50
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,068
<i>Dear Madam:</i>

51
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:41,156
<i>Since our pleasant conversation,</i>
<i>I have thought of little else.</i>

52
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:47,621
<i>I write with a strong sense of the</i>
<i>necessity of continuing our talk.</i>

53
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,380
<i>Dear Madam:</i>

54
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:01,051
<i>I know that you came to honor</i>
<i>Crabb-Robinson at his small party...</i>

55
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,388
<i>... because he'd assisted</i>
<i>your illustrious father.</i>

56
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,974
Excuse me, sir.

57
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:10,477
Meal is served.

58
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,439
Thank you.

59
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,121
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

60
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,667
My tenant. Your evening sherry.

61
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,252
Thank you.

62
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:01,463
Candi, this is Roland. Roland, Candi.

63
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:05,175
- Hello again.
- Be a love and check on the duck.

64
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,136
Okay.

65
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,180
Coming in?

66
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,519
- How do you always know it's me?
- I'm a solicitor, I know everything.

67
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,481
- Candi, huh?
- No, please. Candi's just a friend.

68
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,360
- Why, are you interested?
- I told you, I'm off women.

69
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,699
Yeah, but there's no reason
to be off women.

70
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:36,290
- Why do we sit in your hall?
- It's the best room.

71
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,169
I bought this place for the hallway.

72
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,464
I found something pretty
incredible in the London Library.

73
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:47,634
- A place to sit?
- No.

74
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,637
I found something of Ash's.
Randolph Ash?

75
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:54,725
Ash? Doesn't he have
some sort of celebration going?

76
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:59,813
- It's a centenary of his love poems.
- Mushy ones? Found after his death?

77
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:04,568
- Is the table laid, darling?
- What's it cost an hour?

78
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,363
- Candi's a friend, I told you.
- Not her, you.

79
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:12,284
What do you charge an hour, roughly?

80
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,454
- I don't know, 500.
- Pounds?

81
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,541
- No wonder you have a nice hallway.
- Thank you.

82
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,420
I want seven minutes
of attorney-client privilege.

83
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,174
Step into my office.

84
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,393
Ash wrote those.

85
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,021
- They're not the originals?
- Yeah.

86
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,775
How much time is left?
I gotta think of a defense.

87
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,570
- They're practically love letters.
- Rather racy.

88
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:54,451
Ash supposedly never even looked
at another woman his entire marriage.

89
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,330
Can you imagine if I proved
that Mr. Perfect Husband...

90
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,125
...had this Shakespearean
dark-lady thing going?

91
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:06,547
The duck's done. Would you
be a sweetheart and do the sauce?

92
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,842
Yeah, sure.

93
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,345
- Duck, huh?
- Yeah, Peking.

94
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:17,266
No, it's from around the corner.

95
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:21,603
Yeah, but that would be extraordinary.

96
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:25,607
It'd be rewriting history, old chap.

97
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:29,278
Yeah, it would be.

98
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,821
- Morning.
- Morning.

99
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:17,159
- Roland.
- Professor.

100
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:24,499
- I think I made a discovery.
- It's been discovered 20 times already.

101
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,462
- I don't think so.
- Surprise me.

102
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:33,967
Ash's copy of "Vico" in the library is
full of his own notes on bits of paper.

103
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,595
- Useful?
- Very.

104
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:41,975
Better have a look before Cropper
turns up with his checkbook.

105
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:46,813
He made a mockery yesterday.
1900 pounds for a toothpick.

106
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:51,276
- Fergus? Where is Fergus?
- He's supposed to be teaching.

107
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,737
- I'll come with you.
- No need.

108
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:58,283
The novice blunders on the discovery,
the scholar investigates.

109
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:01,537
You do those requests
for Ellen's stuff.

110
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:06,333
I'll go straight from there
to my class.

111
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,840
"Thank you, what a wonderful discovery.
They're magically delicious."

112
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,134
- He's a meanie.
- That's a nice name for him.

113
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:20,055
Wretched requests, please.

114
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:26,103
"How many jars of gooseberry jam did
Ash's wife, Ellen, make in 1850?"

115
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:30,399
This is not a job for a grownup.

116
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,990
Gooseberry.

117
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,076
Cooking.

118
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,746
Gooseberry jam.

119
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,251
Cooking, 142.

120
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:13,150
What about a small,
informal party, 1859?

121
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:31,168
<i>My headache kept me from accompanying</i>
<i>Randolph to Crabb-Robinson's...</i>

122
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,963
<i>... for a dinner honoring the poetess,</i>
<i>Christabel LaMotte.</i>

123
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:40,219
<i>He was reluctant to attend without me.</i>
<i>I was persistent and persuaded him.</i>

124
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:44,806
- Ash, do you know Professor Spear?
- I'm delighted.

125
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,433
Mrs. Jameson.

126
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,228
- Mrs. Jameson.
- Charmed.

127
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,605
Miss Glover.

128
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,649
Miss Glover.

129
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:57,986
- And Miss LaMotte.
- Miss LaMotte.

130
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:01,156
The highest pleasure.

131
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,993
<i>Randolph reported the party went off</i>
<i>very well indeed.</i>

132
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,829
<i>The discussion of poetry</i>
<i>was animated...</i>

133
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,417
<i>... with Miss LaMotte speaking more</i>
<i>forcibly than anyone expected.</i>

134
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:16,296
It surprises me that a lady
who lives as quietly as you...

135
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:20,008
...would be aware
of my modest success.

136
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:24,805
I am very aware of it.
The papers herald you weekly.

137
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:28,725
- It is you, however, who surprise me.
- Why is that?

138
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:33,981
Judging from your work, I'm surprised
you acknowledge my existence...

139
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:39,653
...or any woman's, since you show us
such small regard on the page.

140
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,738
You cut me, madam.

141
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:47,494
Then I'm sorry.
I only meant to scratch.

142
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,790
Hey, Fergus!

143
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:57,796
Hello, Roland. What is it you chaps
always say? How's it hanging?

144
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:01,675
We usually just say "Hey".
I mean, unless you're gay.

145
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:05,596
Listen. Let me ask you.
Do you know a Dr. Maud Bailey?

146
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:11,351
Yes. I know Maud very well.
She teaches gender studies at Lincoln.

147
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:17,232
Would she be helpful? I'm checking out
Christabel LaMotte, a poet from 1859.

148
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,234
Why are you interested?

149
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:24,740
I had some requests about Ellen Ash's
papers and LaMotte's name came up.

150
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,785
The keeper of Ellen's flame,
that's bottom of the food chain.

151
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:32,414
But I gotta stay on the food chain.
That's why I do it.

152
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:40,047
Right. Publish or perish, as they say.
Or in your case, perish or perish.

153
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,716
So would she, this Maud Bailey?

154
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:46,595
- Yes, but I'd be careful.
- Why? What's she like?

155
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:50,557
- She thicks men's blood with cold.
- Great.

156
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:57,231
If you prefer the American vernacular,
she's a regular ball-breaker.

157
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,824
Mr. Michell?

158
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,828
- What? I'm sorry.
- Roland Michell?

159
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,872
Yes.

160
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,125
- You're Maud.
- Bailey. Dr. Bailey. Yes.

161
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:20,963
There's nothing in my index,
no mention of Ash at all.

162
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:24,216
- Ash and LaMotte definitely met.
- When?

163
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:31,139
June 1859. At a dinner party given
by Crabb-Robinson. It's in his diary.

164
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,726
You jump from that to the idea
they corresponded?

165
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,563
- I found an unfinished letter...
- To LaMotte?

166
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,106
No, "Dear Madam".

167
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:43,735
But of the three women at that party,
LaMotte is likeliest.

168
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:50,868
- LaMotte's letters may have something.
- There aren't many from that period.

169
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:55,956
I'm descended from Christabel.
I'm her niece, thrice removed.

170
00:15:56,206 --> 00:16:01,670
- Three greats.
- That's what thrice usually means.

171
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:07,843
- Maybe I shouldn't have come.
- Does seem rather pointless.

172
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,388
You could have a look
through Blanche's diary.

173
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,057
- Who's Blanche?
- Blanche Glover...

174
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:19,188
...Christabel's companion?
Her lover? You look surprised.

175
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,690
- I didn't know...
- She was a lesbian?

176
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:28,447
- Don't get me wrong. I like lesbians.
- Unfortunately, they didn't have video then.

177
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:33,952
- I see why you think it's so unlikely.
- No. She could have been bisexual.

178
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:39,041
There's no evidence she was, but...
Did you not read before you came?

179
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,919
- Is this an oral exam?
- I suppose it is.

180
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:45,797
You don't know about her,
and yet you make these leaps.

181
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:50,594
You called her a lesbian, not me.

182
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:05,442
<i>Letters, letters, letters. Not for me.</i>

183
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:10,447
<i>Letters I am not meant to know or see.</i>

184
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,088
Thank you, Jane.

185
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:37,224
- You do not have to hide them from me.
- I'm not hiding them.

186
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:41,353
You say they are not hidden,
but they are.

187
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:47,401
Tucked away.
As if they were from Cupid himself.

188
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,487
What does he want?

189
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:54,741
- To be my friend.
- Friend?

190
00:17:56,076 --> 00:18:00,497
- They give what they want a decent name.
- Blanche, no.

191
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,834
No, Blanche, listen.

192
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:08,714
What we have is ours.

193
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:13,385
No one can change that.

194
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:22,477
It is already changed.

195
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,993
Find anything?

196
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:41,496
Maybe.

197
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,146
So, what are those bookmarks, then?

198
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:11,443
Blanche writes about letters. Letters
that Christabel wrote and received.

199
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,072
And it nearly drove Blanche crazy.
Where are they?

200
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:19,034
Lost, destroyed, who knows.
There's lots we haven't got.

201
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:23,163
Not one of Blanche's paintings
has ever turned up.

202
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,499
So who wrote the letters?

203
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:30,671
We've never verified it, but Ash
certainly isn't one of the candidates.

204
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:34,341
- You've got nothing.
- I mean, it's just a thought.

205
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:38,804
I've had many thoughts today,
and you've shot them all down.

206
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:42,474
It seems like a bit
of a wild-goose chase to me.

207
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,935
I'd like to do some more reading.

208
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,938
I suppose you'll wish
to stay overnight.

209
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:53,360
I can't afford to stay.
Unless I huddle in your doorway.

210
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:59,449
I suppose I could put up with you
for one evening, couldn't I?

211
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,959
No doubt you know Fergus Wolfe, then?

212
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:15,215
- Sorry. We're in the same department.
- I imagine he told you that we're...

213
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:19,178
...occasionally on together.
- No, he didn't.

214
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,847
What did he...?

215
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:26,894
Did he say anything about me?

216
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,481
No.

217
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,736
I'll use the bathroom.
Get out of your way.

218
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:40,699
I'm just a brush and flush
kind of guy, so...

219
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,535
Forget I said that.

220
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:48,957
Maud. Can I show you something?

221
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:04,765
- Are these...?
- The originals.

222
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,017
- How did you get?
- I stole them.

223
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,770
- Where from?
- The London Library.

224
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,105
- How could you do that?
- Impulse.

225
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:16,693
Impulse? I've seen that
take-what-you-want attitude...

226
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:19,821
What? In other Americans?

227
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:23,283
God, what is it with you people
and Americans?

228
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:26,954
I know I shouldn't have taken them.

229
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:30,040
I want to find out
if he sent the letter.

230
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:34,711
You don't buy it, but Blanche's
diary suggests that it's possible.

231
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:38,715
- Wouldn't someone have unearthed it?
- That's why it's big.

232
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:42,052
- Potentially so big.
- Well, no one has.

233
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:46,640
Probably because those
were never sent.

234
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:15,836
Are you doing your homework?

235
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:20,924
No, I was just writing stuff.
Stuff for me. It's nothing.

236
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:26,513
- You're a closet poet.
- More like basement, really.

237
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:31,518
- Just fooling around.
- So is that what you want to be?

238
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:36,690
No, I'll be safe and teach
like everybody else.

239
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:40,736
Besides, there's no such thing
as poets anymore.

240
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,739
Well, poet.

241
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:48,660
Do you want to see Christabel's
family home before you go?

242
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:52,748
Michell's late again.

243
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:56,335
Roland asked for another day off,
Fergus.

244
00:22:56,585 --> 00:23:01,006
- Really? Where's he gone?
- I didn't ask. And he didn't say.

245
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,676
He's an American.
He's probably trafficking drugs.

246
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:07,804
Did his new discovery
lead to anything?

247
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:12,226
- Ash's "Vico"? Are you dreaming?
<i>- Vico.</i>

248
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:17,814
No, it's about Christabel LaMotte.
He went to see Dr. Bailey. A woman.

249
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,442
LaMotte.

250
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:23,028
- No.
- It probably came to nothing.

251
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:28,534
- Exactly.
- Or he would have told you.

252
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:34,081
Wouldn't he?

253
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:44,049
Seal Court's over there.

254
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,927
So how long did Christabel live there?

255
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:51,390
Ages. Last 20 or so years of her life.

256
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,392
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

257
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:58,021
"To a dusty shelf we aspire."

258
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:03,277
You should drop by Seal Court
before your train.

259
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:09,324
What do you do in London, Mr. Michell?
Are you a teacher?

260
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:13,704
- No, not yet. I'm doing a fellowship.
- Which means what?

261
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:17,124
On the dole.

262
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:23,005
- My field's Victorian poetry.
- We had a poet in this house once.

263
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:27,676
Terrible sentimental stuff about God.
Death. The dew. And fairies.

264
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:31,763
Show this young man
Christabel's room, Maud.

265
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:35,225
And why don't you stay tonight?

266
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:40,522
You're under no obligation to stay.
Just Joan's way, misses our daughter.

267
00:24:40,772 --> 00:24:45,152
- It's quite a drive back.
- No, we're fine.

268
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,654
Hardly ever come up here.

269
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:53,535
With the wheelchair, of course,
we bunk down on the ground floor.

270
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:02,044
I haven't been up here
since I was a child.

271
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:05,130
Maud.

272
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,052
- Is this the photograph at your house?
- Yes, Christabel's niece, May...

273
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,346
...my great-great grandmother.

274
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:17,726
Christabel wrote dozens of poems
about this place.

275
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:25,943
<i>What are they, who haunt our dreams</i>
<i>And weaken our desires</i>

276
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:30,489
<i>And turn us from a solid face</i>
<i>And in the depth of wintry night</i>

277
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,908
<i>They slumber open-eyed and bright</i>

278
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:37,663
<i>Dolly keeps a secret</i>
<i>Safer than a friend</i>

279
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,624
<i>Dolly's silent sympathy</i>
<i>Lasts without end</i>

280
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:44,670
<i>No rush of action</i>
<i>This is our doom</i>

281
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:51,093
<i>To live a long life out</i>
<i>In a dark room</i>

282
00:25:52,636 --> 00:25:54,847
Maud.

283
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:58,559
It's pretty incredible.

284
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:11,405
Fergus, it's me.
I'm out of town tonight on business.

285
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:16,994
<i>I'd like to ask you about a connection</i>
<i>between Christabel and Randolph Ash.</i>

286
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:24,501
<i>Call me on 015-226-32416.</i>

287
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,555
Roland.

288
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,937
- Roland.
- No.

289
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:47,941
Roland, it's me. It's Maud.

290
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:52,487
- What is it?
- Listen.

291
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:57,034
<i>Dolly keeps a secret</i>
<i>Safer than a friend</i>

292
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:02,581
<i>Dolly's silent sympathy</i>
<i>Lasts without end</i>

293
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,704
God.

294
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:45,332
I was so sure.

295
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:51,880
Sympathy. Sympathy. Sympathy.
Meaning what?

296
00:27:52,130 --> 00:28:00,097
Mutual affection or understanding.
Favor, pity or accord. That's not it.

297
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:03,600
That's not it at all.

298
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,229
She uses silent sympathy
in a more classical context.

299
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:14,736
Like structure or support. Dolly
conceals it, but not within, beneath.

300
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,704
There's a door.

301
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:40,345
- I can't believe it.
- Let me see.

302
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:43,557
- Be careful. They're precious.
- I will be.

303
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:48,103
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- Why'd you drag me up here then?

304
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,981
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna read.

305
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:56,111
- We've got to ask the Baileys!
- Ask, and you'll see these under glass.

306
00:28:56,361 --> 00:28:59,573
Stop! Stop! All right.
Can we do it properly?

307
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:06,872
- Let me get notecards and pencils...
- All right. Go, go. Hurry!

308
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:46,537
Look at this. We got Ash
and Christabel's letters. Listen.

309
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:48,539
"Dear Miss LaMotte:

310
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:54,670
It was a great pleasure to talk to you
at dear Crabb-Robinson's party."

311
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,840
"May I hope that you too
enjoyed our talk?"

312
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:03,387
"And may I have the pleasure
of calling on you?"

313
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:05,722
She says no.

314
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:07,766
"But you may write."

315
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:11,812
<i>"Would you rather not have a letter,</i>
<i>however imperfect...</i>

316
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:17,067
<i>... than a plate of cucumber sandwiches,</i>
<i>however exquisitely fine cut?"</i>

317
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:21,655
<i>"You know you would, and so would I."</i>

318
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,828
"I was entranced and moved
by your portrait of your father."

319
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:29,788
"I write nonsense."

320
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:34,334
"If you write again, you shall
have an essay on what you will."

321
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:36,795
"Yours to command, in some things."

322
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,214
- "I was born...
- Christabel LaMotte.

323
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:44,386
...in a small place too."
Not like this, not bare.

324
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:51,268
<i>A brilliant, dusty hutch of mysteries.</i>
<i>A cabinet of curiosities.</i>

325
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,729
<i>What did my eyes first light on?</i>

326
00:30:53,979 --> 00:31:00,444
<i>I am a creature of my pen.</i>
<i>My pen is the best part of me.</i>

327
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,738
<i>I send you now two more poems.</i>

328
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:09,369
<i>I read your mythic tales of Maia and</i>
<i>found them both charming and sad.</i>

329
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,040
<i>Your verse is rich</i>
<i>but the metaphor is richer.</i>

330
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:18,003
<i>Dear Mr. Ash: I live circumscribed</i>
<i>and self-communing.</i>

331
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:19,796
<i>It is best so.</i>

332
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:24,551
<i>Not like a princess in a thicket.</i>
<i>More like a spider in her web.</i>

333
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:29,056
"Inclined to snap at visitors
or trespassers...

334
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:34,436
...not perceiving the distinction until
too late. Thus it is unwise to call."

335
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:39,358
<i>I know you live very quietly</i>
<i>but I could be very quiet.</i>

336
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:42,319
<i>I only want to discuss Dante.</i>
<i>Shakespeare.</i>

337
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:45,364
<i>Wordsworth. Coleridge. Goethe.</i>

338
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:53,914
<i>Not forgetting, of course, Christabel</i>
<i>LaMotte and the ambitious fairy project.</i>

339
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:14,226
<i>Sir, things flicker and shift</i>
<i>all spangle and sparkle and flashes.</i>

340
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:20,649
<i>I have sat all this long evening by my</i>
<i>fireside, turning towards a caving in...</i>

341
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:25,988
<i>... the crumbling of the consumed coals</i>
<i>to where I am leading myself...</i>

342
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:28,824
<i>... to lifeless dust, sir.</i>

343
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:35,914
<i>My dear friend, for I may</i>
<i>call myself a friend, may I not?</i>

344
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:41,670
<i>I speak to you as I would to any person</i>
<i>who possesses my true thoughts...</i>

345
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:48,177
<i>... my thoughts have spent more time in</i>
<i>your company than anyone else's lately.</i>

346
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:54,725
<i>Where my thoughts are,</i>
<i>there am I in truth.</i>

347
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:58,729
"My dear friend,
it has been borne in upon me...

348
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:02,691
...that there are dangers
in our continued conversation."

349
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,027
<i>The world would not approve...</i>

350
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:10,449
<i>... of letters between a woman living in</i>
<i>shared solitude as I do, and a man.</i>

351
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:14,661
<i>Even if that man were a great poet.</i>

352
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:17,372
<i>And if one is to live in this way...</i>

353
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:25,672
<i>... it's imperative to appear respectable</i>
<i>in the eyes of that world and your wife.</i>

354
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,258
<i>It is a sealed pact.</i>

355
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:32,513
<i>It is a chosen life in which I</i>
<i>have been wondrously happy...</i>

356
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:35,807
<i>... and not alone in being so.</i>

357
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:41,522
"I have chosen a way, dear friend.
I must hold to it."

358
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:45,317
"Be patient, be generous, forgive."

359
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:49,321
"May I also request that you
return my correspondence."

360
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:53,200
"In this way at least our letters
shall remain together."

361
00:33:53,450 --> 00:34:00,958
"I have known incandescence and must
decline to sample it any further."

362
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:08,757
"This goes to the post. Forgive its faults
and forgive me. Christabel."

363
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:16,139
<i>My dear Christabel, your letter came</i>
<i>as a shock to me, I will confess.</i>

364
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:22,688
<i>I was at first not only shocked,</i>
<i>but angry that you should write so.</i>

365
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:27,317
<i>As you have asked about my wife,</i>
<i>however, I will tell you.</i>

366
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:29,987
<i>I love Ellen...</i>

367
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:32,781
<i>... but not as I love you.</i>

368
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:39,204
<i>There are good reasons I cannot discuss</i>
<i>why my love for you may not hurt her.</i>

369
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:42,749
I do not feel I have been
a proper wife to you...

370
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,796
...without children or any physical...
- Nonsense, Ellen.

371
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:51,049
Nonsense.

372
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:56,263
There are many types of love.

373
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:58,390
All sorts.

374
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,809
And ours...

375
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:05,063
...that good between us...

376
00:35:06,148 --> 00:35:10,277
...has been most profound.

377
00:35:11,945 --> 00:35:17,492
<i>I must say to you what is in my mind.</i>
<i>I've called you my muse, and so you are.</i>

378
00:35:17,743 --> 00:35:23,707
<i>I could call you,</i>
<i>with even greater truth, my love.</i>

379
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:26,627
- Whoa, whoa.
- What?

380
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:28,253
Don't do that. What?

381
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:33,634
He sends her more letters and she
doesn't answer him. She ignores him.

382
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:35,511
Typical.

383
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:43,977
No. She chose her life with Blanche.
It's not typical. It's remarkable.

384
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:50,234
"I hope this note is the dove...

385
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:53,862
...which will return with
the wished-for olive branch."

386
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:56,573
<i>"My letters are like Noah's ravens..."</i>

387
00:35:56,823 --> 00:36:01,537
<i>They have sped out across the Thames,</i>
<i>and yet have not returned.</i>

388
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:07,459
<i>I send this note by hand,</i>
<i>in the hope you might receive it.</i>

389
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:19,221
- Where are the letters?
- They're gone.

390
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:24,101
I tore them up. Burned them.

391
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:29,189
- And the others from my desk?
- The same.

392
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:34,027
I beg for us to be as we were,
Christabel.

393
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:37,406
Sweetheart, please.

394
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,454
<i>This house...</i>

395
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:50,294
<i>... so happy once, is full of weeping</i>
<i>and wailing and black headaches.</i>

396
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:56,175
<i>I ask myself to whom I may turn</i>
<i>and think of you, my friend...</i>

397
00:36:56,425 --> 00:37:01,221
<i>... the unwitting cause</i>
<i>of all this grief.</i>

398
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:11,190
<i>I shan't forget the first glimpse</i>
<i>of your form.</i>

399
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,444
<i>Illuminated as it was</i>
<i>by flashes of sunlight.</i>

400
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:18,322
<i>I have dreamt nightly of your face...</i>

401
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:23,368
<i>... and walked the landscape of my life</i>
<i>with the rhythms of your writing...</i>

402
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,412
<i>... ringing in my ears.</i>

403
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:30,501
<i>I shall never forget our shining</i>
<i>progress towards one another.</i>

404
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:36,173
<i>Never have I felt such a concentration</i>
<i>of my entire being.</i>

405
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:42,012
<i>I cannot let you burn me up.</i>
<i>Nor can I resist you.</i>

406
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:49,603
<i>No mere human can stand in a fire</i>
<i>and not be consumed.</i>

407
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:58,570
Mind reading that last part out
one more time?

408
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:06,036
"I cannot let you burn me up.
Nor can I resist you."

409
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,792
"No mere human can stand in a fire
and not be consumed."

410
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,961
That?

411
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:17,172
Yeah.

412
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:23,595
Thank you, and...

413
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:26,056
"And I took your hand."

414
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:32,813
"Mine rested in yours
with trust and belief."

415
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:44,950
Do you have regrets?

416
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:52,249
I should regret venturing out
to Crabb-Robinson's party that evening.

417
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:56,086
I should regret it, but I do not.

418
00:38:56,336 --> 00:39:01,550
Not even in that most sensible
corner of my heart.

419
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:07,514
What are we to do?

420
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:13,937
<i>"I do not wish to damage your life."</i>

421
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:18,442
<i>"Nonetheless, I shall be in the church</i>
<i>at noon tomorrow...</i>

422
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:22,863
...with what strikes me
as the holiest of prayers...

423
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:26,992
...that you should join me
on a journey to Yorkshire...

424
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:33,999
...a journey out of time
beyond our lives here on earth."

425
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:42,090
- This is unbelievable.
- That was the last one.

426
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:45,886
- You're kidding me.
- No.

427
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:48,138
Did she go with him or not?

428
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:50,098
Hands up!

429
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:54,520
You two?

430
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,813
What's this, then?

431
00:39:57,064 --> 00:40:01,318
- There's been no harm done, George.
- How do we know?

432
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:04,947
It was very clever of Maud
to find your treasure.

433
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:07,533
Yes, well...

434
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:11,620
Must take advice, Joanie.

435
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,289
How long before he takes advice?

436
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,210
He'll dither around for a while,
but not long.

437
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,338
Blanche's diary has nothing
for that period.

438
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,508
- Did Ellen keep a journal?
- Yeah, in London...

439
00:40:24,758 --> 00:40:29,054
...but it's mostly housewife stuff.
- Gold is in that stuff.

440
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:32,808
We should check it.

441
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,778
<i>- Bailey here.</i>
- Bailey?

442
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:46,989
Is that Dr. Heath?

443
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,868
No. I'm a friend of Maud Bailey's.

444
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,912
- Is she there?
- No, she isn't.

445
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:57,666
Could you get off the line?
I'm expecting the doctor.

446
00:40:57,916 --> 00:41:03,005
- Have you seen Roland Michell?
<i>- Not since this morning, no.</i>

447
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:04,882
But his work went well?

448
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:09,094
The fairy poet?
I haven't the foggiest idea.

449
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:14,349
- Do you mean Christabel LaMotte?
<i>- Get off the line!</i>

450
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:35,078
I looked in Ellen's diary
and there's nothing.

451
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:38,874
But this should cheer you up.

452
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:41,877
It's in her correspondence.

453
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:47,424
- I won't ask if this is the original.
- I wouldn't.

454
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:51,678
"Dear Mrs. Ash: I am at present
totally unknown to you...

455
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:56,183
...but I have something to impart
to which concerns both of us...

456
00:41:56,433 --> 00:42:00,938
...and is, in my case,
a matter of life and death."

457
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:06,109
<i>"May I trespass on your time</i>
<i>and come to see you?"</i>

458
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,697
<i>"You would do wrong to keep this</i>
<i>evidence which I send to you now."</i>

459
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:13,784
<i>"It is not mine, it is also not yours."</i>

460
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:17,079
<i>"What I say is true and urgent,</i>
<i>as you will see."</i>

461
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:22,501
<i>"Yours sincerely, Blanche Glover."</i>

462
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,009
Mrs. Ash...

463
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,432
<i>Maybe Blanche kept the letters</i>
<i>and showed them to Ellen.</i>

464
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:40,978
<i>It all fits beautifully.</i>

465
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:45,315
Perhaps both of our departments
should work on this together.

466
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:47,860
- Is that what you want?
- Do you?

467
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:52,739
No. I want to find out what happened.
I wanna follow their trail.

468
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,992
I need to know.

469
00:42:55,242 --> 00:43:00,497
I thought you were mad when you came
to Lincoln with your stolen letter.

470
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:04,877
Now I feel exactly the same.

471
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:12,509
I haven't really thanked you.
I mean, properly, for all of this.

472
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:16,847
I have difficulty with compliments
and such.

473
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:22,144
- Giving or receiving?
- Both, actually.

474
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:26,023
Well, I won't tell you
you're amazing-looking then.

475
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:29,359
- Thank you...
- I wouldn't act on it anyway...

476
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,237
...with Fergus and all.
- What does "and all" mean?

477
00:43:32,487 --> 00:43:37,117
Nothing. It's just a little problem
that I have, socially.

478
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:43,040
- Do you take anything for it?
- It's not that kind of a problem.

479
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:47,878
It's just relationships on the whole,
they're not really for me.

480
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:51,298
- Anyway...
- Yes.

481
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:59,181
- Anyway, thank you.
- You're welcome.

482
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:08,982
- Thank you for agreeing to meet me.
- You made me rather curious.

483
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:15,364
- Scotch with just a dash of soda.
- I'll have the same.

484
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:21,703
I wanted to learn of the connection
between Ash and Christabel LaMotte.

485
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:23,914
LaMotte and Ash?
There isn't any.

486
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:29,127
Roland Michell has made a discovery
with a colleague of mine, Maud Bailey.

487
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:33,131
- Who is Roland Michell?
- Blackadder's research assistant.

488
00:44:33,382 --> 00:44:36,426
American. Blondish...

489
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:40,973
Well, he seems to know you.
And he thinks it's important.

490
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:47,479
- Does Blackadder agree?
- I don't believe he knows about it.

491
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:22,639
Do you wish to be lodged separately?

492
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:27,644
- Respectably, elsewhere from me?
- I want to be with you.

493
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:31,481
I understood that was
what we had decided.

494
00:45:31,732 --> 00:45:36,653
These four weeks only are ours.

495
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:41,325
But ours alone.

496
00:45:54,338 --> 00:46:00,093
- I hope you will accept this ring.
- I brought a ring too.

497
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:07,351
You see? Proof of my resolution.

498
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:25,953
You take my breath away.

499
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:50,853
Not yet.

500
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:57,192
No, no. Not yet.

501
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:03,991
Shall we go out then, to explore?

502
00:47:20,883 --> 00:47:24,845
Here's your bathroom.

503
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:29,224
Cupboards.

504
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,645
Your lovely view.

505
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:38,358
And, of course, the bed.

506
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:46,200
- We'll look for another hotel.
- But this is where Ash stayed.

507
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:50,329
- Then we'll have to share.
- I can bring up a folding bed...

508
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:54,499
...if that's your problem.

509
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:58,128
- We work together.
- We were expecting two rooms.

510
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:04,259
I'm sure it's more complicated
than I can imagine.

511
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:23,362
That's a lovely brooch
you're wearing, miss.

512
00:48:23,612 --> 00:48:26,782
It could be one of
Isaac Greenburg's designs.

513
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:31,745
I'll get the book
and see if I can tell.

514
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:39,628
Where did you get this?

515
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:45,968
I've had it for ages.
It was in the family dress-up box.

516
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:48,679
Don't you see?

517
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:54,726
Ash bought the brooch for Ellen,
the clasped hands, here. We know that.

518
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:57,354
- And this for Christabel.
- Right.

519
00:48:57,604 --> 00:49:01,817
So he bought this and said, "I'll have
the eternal embrace for my wife."

520
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:05,946
He wouldn't have said anything,
he would have just bought it.

521
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,740
It was accepted between them.

522
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:13,871
Are you writing fiction now?

523
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:17,583
Maybe.

524
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:23,088
But I'm having fun. Are you?

525
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:26,925
Yes, I suppose I am.

526
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:30,596
Don't grimace when you say it,
it's more convincing.

527
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:37,102
I suppose I can be
a touch empirical at times.

528
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:41,148
Just a touch.

529
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:44,943
You want to go for a walk?
I mean, after this?

530
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:50,908
For sure it's earlier than the death
of Victoria's Albert. Probably late '50s.

531
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:56,622
- 1860s, maybe.
- 1859...

532
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:59,625
...ish?

533
00:50:10,219 --> 00:50:13,847
I think we're getting
near Thomason Foss.

534
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:16,183
- Cropper mentions it...
- Mortimer Cropper?

535
00:50:16,433 --> 00:50:20,187
Ash's biographer.
All-purpose asshole.

536
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:23,607
He's tracked Ash's entire life.
He's happy to tell you that.

537
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:29,279
- More than happy, I'm sure.
- You know him?

538
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:46,839
That is beautiful.

539
00:50:48,549 --> 00:50:50,175
Maud.

540
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:52,010
What?

541
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:56,098
I think Christabel did come here.

542
00:50:56,348 --> 00:50:58,809
Listen:

543
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:03,188
<i>Three elements combine</i>
<i>To make the fourth</i>

544
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:06,567
<i>But above the water and the light</i>
<i>Together made</i>

545
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:09,444
<i>A halo in the darkened cave</i>

546
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:14,408
That poem is dated 1859, July.

547
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:21,623
See, if there's a cave behind it,
that might be all the proof we need.

548
00:51:28,547 --> 00:51:32,843
I know it's an awfully repressed
English thing to say...

549
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:39,516
...but what the hell are you doing?
- There's only one way to find out.

550
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:49,151
Of course, we could have
just asked someone.

551
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:20,849
I found it!

552
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:11,710
Your hands are shaking.

553
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,838
Are you afraid?

554
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:17,674
No.

555
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:21,345
A little.

556
00:54:51,792 --> 00:54:56,547
<i>These are and were there</i>
<i>The garden and the tree</i>

557
00:54:56,797 --> 00:55:01,176
<i>The serpent at its root</i>
<i>The fruit of gold</i>

558
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:08,475
<i>The woman in the shadow of the boughs</i>
<i>The running water and the grassy space</i>

559
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:14,565
<i>They are and were there</i>

560
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:19,278
I don't mind that.

561
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:25,784
See? You could grow to like Ash.

562
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:32,165
Yes. He's sort of
a soft-core misogynist.

563
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:46,138
Why do you always tie
your hair up like that?

564
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:55,898
- It's to do with Fergus Wolfe mostly.
- Fergus? How to do with Fergus?

565
00:55:57,482 --> 00:56:01,570
When we met, he drove me mad
quoting Yeats:

566
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:07,117
<i>Who could love you for yourself alone</i>
<i>And not your yellow hair?</i>

567
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:13,207
Then I was accused by feminists at a
conference of dyeing it to attract men.

568
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:16,210
- Really?
- Yes.

569
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,923
So I shaved it off. All of it.

570
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:23,675
- And did he?
- Did who what?

571
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:27,012
Fergus love you
without your yellow hair?

572
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:29,431
No.

573
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:32,851
With or without.

574
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:36,772
I don't even like him.
But I can't seem to...

575
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:38,982
It's Freud:

576
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:43,320
On the other side of attraction
lies repulsion.

577
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:47,866
Or was that Calvin Klein?

578
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,331
- Do you believe that?
- I wouldn't know.

579
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:59,670
I don't allow myself to do that
Ash-Christabel grand passion thing.

580
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,630
- Allow?
- No.

581
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,343
Jealousy. Obsession. All that.
Not anymore.

582
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:09,263
You're lucky, then.

583
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:14,268
It all gets so...
Just such a tangle.

584
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:18,814
It's a tangle most people want.

585
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:21,608
Not me, though.

586
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:26,238
My antics made
a lot of people unhappy.

587
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:29,157
One horribly so.

588
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:36,331
For me...

589
00:57:36,582 --> 00:57:41,295
...whenever I feel anything
for anyone...

590
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:43,964
...I go cold all over.

591
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:49,511
- What makes you do that?
- Fear, I suppose.

592
00:57:49,761 --> 00:57:55,976
Fear of being burned up by love.

593
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:00,772
- Listen to us.
- Yes.

594
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:05,861
Aren't we just modern?

595
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:10,365
Maud, you should let your hair out.
You should let it breathe.

596
00:58:10,616 --> 00:58:14,286
Don't do the icy thing. You have
nothing to worry about from me.

597
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:22,628
- Christabel said, "Fear all men."
- Yeah, well, Christabel didn't know me.

598
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:26,924
I don't want to take anything from you.

599
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:29,760
So then we're both...

600
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:35,307
...perfectly safe.
- Right.

601
00:59:22,312 --> 00:59:30,070
How can we bear it?
Every day we will have less.

602
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:40,831
- Would you rather have had nothing?
- Oh, no.

603
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:47,296
I thank God that if there
had to be a dragon, it was you.

604
01:00:33,258 --> 01:00:34,843
Wait.

605
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:38,138
Wait.

606
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:49,107
- I was trying to get out from the covers.
- No.

607
01:00:49,107 --> 01:00:53,987
We shouldn't be doing this.
It's dangerous.

608
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:57,616
- I don't...
- Because I like you. I like you a lot.

609
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:02,329
I just don't want to blow it here.

610
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:08,669
- It doesn't matter to me, honestly.
- What do you mean?

611
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:18,762
It's all right. We're probably just...

612
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:23,976
These cramped quarters.
It was a mistake.

613
01:01:29,439 --> 01:01:33,944
I didn't mean that.

614
01:02:03,098 --> 01:02:06,560
Let's not beat the thing dead.

615
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:12,733
- It happened. It's over. We're adults.
- Speak for yourself.

616
01:02:12,983 --> 01:02:19,364
I can't imagine what you're like after
you actually sleep with someone.

617
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:26,079
Maud, I think that you are very...

618
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:29,249
You know?

619
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:33,587
No, I don't know.

620
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:39,718
So we're friends now, is that it?

621
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:44,515
- Yeah, but that's a lot.
- I agree, it's fine.

622
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:47,017
Yeah.

623
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:50,270
It's perfect.

624
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:53,106
Anyway, we're getting off the track.

625
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:59,071
We came to investigate them,
not us.

626
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:14,878
- So whatever happened to Blanche?
- Blanche drowned.

627
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:20,133
- Where was Christabel?
- We don't know where she was.

628
01:03:20,384 --> 01:03:24,930
- The year before is a bit blank too.
- That entire year?

629
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:32,187
There's speculation she went to France.
But I've nothing to support that.

630
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:35,357
Okay, so...

631
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:39,862
Christabel comes here with Ash,
then disappears. On paper, at least.

632
01:03:40,112 --> 01:03:42,447
Yes.

633
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:48,120
- And Blanche suicides.
- Jesus.

634
01:03:54,418 --> 01:03:56,712
What are you doing?

635
01:03:56,962 --> 01:04:01,425
- It's a poem I've been writing.
- You're not pleased with it?

636
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:07,222
On the contrary, I think it perfectly
expresses the joy I have felt with you.

637
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:09,516
Then why that?

638
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:12,978
These feelings,
I want them to survive.

639
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:16,273
I know I can never declare
all this...

640
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:18,317
This love.

641
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:22,905
There, I've said it. I know it cannot
be declared to the world.

642
01:04:23,155 --> 01:04:29,620
All I may do is scatter these words from
the train and hope that they take root.

643
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:35,083
They will flourish. I swear it.

644
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:27,553
So, what next? I mean, for you?

645
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:33,433
I'll check the archives to see where
Christabel might have been that year.

646
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:35,602
Good.

647
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:39,398
I guess I'll just...

648
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:42,067
I don't know.

649
01:05:42,317 --> 01:05:48,407
Go look up shit on the microfiche.
Suffer over you.

650
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:50,742
Goodbye.

651
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:54,621
See you.

652
01:07:01,313 --> 01:07:03,774
Lost your way? Don't do tours here.

653
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:06,276
- Sir George Bailey?
- Who wants to know?

654
01:07:06,527 --> 01:07:09,029
Professor Cropper,
curator of the Stant Collection...

655
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:12,074
...Robert Owen University
in New Mexico.

656
01:07:12,324 --> 01:07:14,243
And this is Dr. Wolfe.

657
01:07:14,493 --> 01:07:19,873
- I'm a busy man. My wife's ill.
- I can quite understand that, sir.

658
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:23,794
I believe you may be in possession
of some documents...

659
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:28,966
...by Randolph Henry Ash.

660
01:07:29,633 --> 01:07:34,012
- Don't shoot.
- Get off my land.

661
01:07:34,638 --> 01:07:37,266
Do you have any idea
what we're talking about?

662
01:07:37,516 --> 01:07:43,146
Do you have any idea how much
such pieces, if they existed...

663
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:48,485
...how much they would be worth?
- Worth?

664
01:07:55,576 --> 01:07:59,997
Mind if we swing past the university?
Bit of unfinished business.

665
01:08:00,247 --> 01:08:04,459
Miss Bailey, I presume.
The accomplice.

666
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:07,504
The very same.

667
01:08:07,754 --> 01:08:12,676
- God! You're like Bonnie and Clyde.
- I needed a picture of her.

668
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:16,096
I've never seen you like this.
Just go.

669
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:21,268
Take the Porsche and go.

670
01:08:48,795 --> 01:08:53,008
Fergus, what?

671
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:59,640
If Fergus went out to get Indian food,
I'm gonna feel really stupid.

672
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:01,683
No, he didn't.

673
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:06,980
India wouldn't be
far enough away, actually.

674
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:10,817
Come inside, I'll explain.

675
01:09:11,068 --> 01:09:15,072
You sure? I mean,
about me coming in?

676
01:09:15,322 --> 01:09:18,242
Yes, very.

677
01:09:18,492 --> 01:09:21,119
I left Fergus a message
from Seal Court...

678
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:26,166
...which put him on our trail.
And he came here looking for answers.

679
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:31,547
- He and Cropper from the sound of it.
- So that was Cropper's car outside.

680
01:09:31,797 --> 01:09:36,510
I think Fergus found something.
He's been spooking around the museum.

681
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,514
Sending out a bunch of faxes.

682
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:45,185
I wouldn't be so quick to do that.

683
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:53,151
The British Museum fax log sheet.

684
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:57,698
"To University of Nantes from Wolfe.
Subject: Christabel LaMotte."

685
01:09:57,948 --> 01:10:03,579
"Information on LaMotte genealogy.
Request journal of Sabine de Kercoz."

686
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:07,457
Unfortunately for Fergus,
we have to log our faxes.

687
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:11,378
You're shameless.

688
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:24,016
So, what are we gonna do now?

689
01:10:24,266 --> 01:10:28,979
Are we gonna try
to beat him to France or...

690
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:33,859
Or are we just gonna
stare at each other?

691
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:37,529
That is the question, isn't it?

692
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:40,532
- I have another one for you.
- What's that?

693
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:45,120
What are you really doing here?

694
01:10:51,335 --> 01:10:55,797
I needed to see your face.

695
01:11:00,677 --> 01:11:05,182
I just want to let you know
whatever happened in Whitby...

696
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:10,896
...which, unfortunately,
was not much...

697
01:11:12,105 --> 01:11:17,528
...it's not because anything
that you did.

698
01:11:17,778 --> 01:11:21,532
Not at all.

699
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:26,245
I just didn't want
to jump into something.

700
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:30,249
I mean, I did and I do...

701
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:32,459
...want to.

702
01:11:32,709 --> 01:11:36,380
Badly.

703
01:11:38,173 --> 01:11:42,719
I just didn't want to mess this up.

704
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:47,558
And I just want to see...

705
01:11:47,808 --> 01:11:51,979
I want to see if there's an us...

706
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:56,525
...in you and me.

707
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:02,614
Would you like that?

708
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:15,169
I'll take that as a "yes".

709
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:50,621
When will she be back?

710
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:55,626
Could you check for us?

711
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:24,321
She will return on Thursday.

712
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:32,788
What about you and your shoplifting?
I can't take you anywhere.

713
01:13:43,841 --> 01:13:45,300
"Dear Professor Wolfe:

714
01:13:45,551 --> 01:13:50,597
I have made another discovery.
Among Sabine's papers was her journal."

715
01:13:50,848 --> 01:13:54,768
"She writes about LaMotte's visit
to Brittany in 1859...

716
01:13:55,018 --> 01:14:00,190
<i>... and the subsequent arrival</i>
<i>of a mysterious visitor."</i>

717
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:08,592
I know how things are.
I wish to help you.

718
01:15:08,842 --> 01:15:14,973
You know? Tell me, Cousin Sabine,
how do you think things are with me?

719
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:22,189
I am a grown woman, you are a girl.
I do not desire any help from you.

720
01:15:28,695 --> 01:15:34,243
<i>Christabel's condition became worse</i>
<i>after she received word from London...</i>

721
01:15:34,493 --> 01:15:40,123
<i>... that her close friend had died.</i>

722
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,118
She left England
because she was pregnant...

723
01:16:16,368 --> 01:16:20,956
...and Blanche committed suicide.

724
01:16:24,334 --> 01:16:30,841
- What happened to the baby?
- Must've been stillborn. Or died.

725
01:16:31,091 --> 01:16:36,346
- Maybe it was taken in by a local family.
- And brought up here?

726
01:16:36,597 --> 01:16:39,266
I'd like to think that...

727
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:42,352
...but I wonder.
- You wonder what?

728
01:16:42,603 --> 01:16:45,105
I don't know, I just...

729
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:50,569
She comes here alone,
hears that Blanche has killed herself.

730
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:55,741
She's pregnant, distraught.

731
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:04,625
- I mean, I've no evidence for it...
- Can you imagine how she felt?

732
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:08,879
Yes, I can.

733
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:21,892
So when do we see Christabel next?

734
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:26,355
Autumn, 1860. In the references
to the Vestal Lights.

735
01:17:26,605 --> 01:17:30,234
It was a group of women who
met with mediums regularly.

736
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:34,738
Really? You know Ash
hated spiritualists, pretty openly.

737
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:41,662
- Is it a connection worth tracking down?
- I don't know.

738
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:55,425
Please, make a circle with your hands.

739
01:17:58,554 --> 01:18:02,516
Close your eyes.

740
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:09,565
White earth. Valley.

741
01:18:09,815 --> 01:18:12,150
Waterfall.

742
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:15,821
Child laughing.

743
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:18,949
Two people.

744
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,993
Deception.

745
01:18:21,243 --> 01:18:23,453
Letters.

746
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:26,081
Two people.

747
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:28,625
Words.

748
01:18:28,876 --> 01:18:32,171
- Death.
- What have you done?

749
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:35,424
A field.

750
01:18:35,465 --> 01:18:39,219
Where is the child?

751
01:18:43,765 --> 01:18:48,228
What have you done with the child?

752
01:18:48,478 --> 01:18:53,192
You have made a murderess of me.

753
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:04,912
"I understood that Mr. Ash was inquiring
about the spirit of his departed child."

754
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:12,419
"But I am told that this could not be
the case as Mr. Ash is childless."

755
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:21,428
Was there any mention
of Hella Lees in your research?

756
01:19:21,678 --> 01:19:23,805
I don't know.

757
01:19:24,056 --> 01:19:29,645
Nor do I care.
Look, I've got to get back.

758
01:19:29,728 --> 01:19:34,316
- What's going on?
- Nothing, I'm just tired. I should...

759
01:19:34,566 --> 01:19:38,278
Come on. What's wrong, seriously?

760
01:19:38,529 --> 01:19:42,699
I don't actually want to discover
anything else about them.

761
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:46,161
Do you know?

762
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:48,539
I'm finding things out
that are...

763
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:54,628
It's horrible, when you think about it,
really. Men and women together.

764
01:19:54,878 --> 01:19:57,422
She gave up her life, didn't she?

765
01:19:57,673 --> 01:20:02,427
A perfectly decent life I've always
admired. And for what? For nothing.

766
01:20:02,678 --> 01:20:05,180
- Not nothing.
- Really? For what, then?

767
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:09,893
A child who died. A lover drowned.
And to what end?

768
01:20:10,143 --> 01:20:16,191
She and Ash. My own parents.
And every relationship I've ever had.

769
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:21,363
It's all doomed. We can't seem to help
but just tear each other apart.

770
01:20:21,613 --> 01:20:26,827
Well, what about us? You didn't
include us. What about that?

771
01:20:27,077 --> 01:20:30,372
Look, l...

772
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:35,669
I can't think about anything right now.

773
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:41,216
So okay. So this is the icy,
pull back part then?

774
01:20:41,466 --> 01:20:46,054
- What?
- You get close. You pull away. You get...

775
01:20:46,305 --> 01:20:49,433
- It's the pattern, right?
- What are you talking about?

776
01:20:49,683 --> 01:20:54,563
Your "fear men" mantra from Yorkshire,
that's what I'm talking about.

777
01:20:54,813 --> 01:20:58,150
If that's the way you play it,
that's the way you play it.

778
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:01,320
Do you honestly believe that?

779
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:04,865
Is that what you think this is to me,
a game?

780
01:21:05,115 --> 01:21:08,785
Is it?

781
01:21:11,288 --> 01:21:15,167
All this talk of us
really comes to nothing, doesn't it?

782
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:20,297
Yes, I guess you're right.
It's nothing.

783
01:21:54,623 --> 01:21:57,417
<i>Dear Professor Blackadder:</i>

784
01:21:57,668 --> 01:22:01,004
<i>I did try to tell you</i>
<i>about my discovery before...</i>

785
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:03,715
<i>... but found that I couldn't.</i>

786
01:22:03,966 --> 01:22:07,719
<i>Please read these two letters...</i>

787
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:11,056
<i>... and you will begin to understand.</i>

788
01:22:11,306 --> 01:22:14,560
<i>I'm sorry for deceiving you.</i>

789
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:17,020
<i>Sincerely...</i>

790
01:22:17,271 --> 01:22:21,233
<i>... Roland Michell.</i>

791
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:38,458
It's well-documented that Ellen
set a box on Ash's coffin.

792
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:42,713
A sealed container. We'd always
imagined it was just trinkets.

793
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:46,925
But in light of Michell's discovery,
who knows what may be in it.

794
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:49,344
Morally, that box is mine.

795
01:22:49,595 --> 01:22:52,764
Once you become Lord Ash,
it's absolutely yours.

796
01:22:53,015 --> 01:22:59,897
Until then, we keep it secret. Then you
discover it among old Lord Ash's things.

797
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:04,818
Then I purchase it from you. It's all
aboveboard, no one the wiser.

798
01:23:05,068 --> 01:23:08,947
Cropper, you absolutely sure of that?

799
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:10,157
Where is it?

800
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:14,369
"I place this letter in his hands,
and if ghouls dig it up again...

801
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:20,834
...then perhaps justice will be done
when I am not here to see it."

802
01:23:27,633 --> 01:23:29,051
<i>Dear Madam:</i>

803
01:23:29,301 --> 01:23:33,347
<i>We are older now,</i>
<i>and my fires, at last, are out.</i>

804
01:23:33,597 --> 01:23:36,975
<i>I know that you are</i>
<i>more than aware of my name...</i>

805
01:23:37,226 --> 01:23:40,979
<i>... but I find you must see it</i>
<i>in print one last time.</i>

806
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:45,484
<i>It has been made known to me</i>
<i>that your husband is near to death.</i>

807
01:23:45,734 --> 01:23:50,656
<i>So I have writ down,</i>
<i>for his eyes only, some things.</i>

808
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:56,036
<i>I find I cannot say what things</i>
<i>and have sealed the letter.</i>

809
01:23:56,286 --> 01:23:59,873
<i>If you wish to read it,</i>
<i>it is in your hands...</i>

810
01:24:00,123 --> 01:24:04,378
<i>... though I must hope</i>
<i>that he will see it first and decide.</i>

811
01:24:04,628 --> 01:24:11,385
<i>I have done great harm,</i>
<i>though I meant none to you.</i>

812
01:25:04,146 --> 01:25:08,942
I'll see they get back,
no questions asked.

813
01:25:09,193 --> 01:25:11,987
You're more enterprising
than I gave you credit for.

814
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:15,073
Was there a compliment
in there somewhere?

815
01:25:15,324 --> 01:25:18,744
Yes. Probably.

816
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:23,457
What I can't believe is Fergus Wolfe
conniving with Cropper.

817
01:25:23,707 --> 01:25:26,793
- I thought I was a better judge of men.
- That's where you went wrong.

818
01:25:27,044 --> 01:25:30,756
You gave him credit for being one.

819
01:25:31,965 --> 01:25:35,427
Thank you.

820
01:25:41,308 --> 01:25:43,894
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

821
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:48,982
I believe that may be her.

822
01:25:49,525 --> 01:25:55,322
- I'm sorry, I lost it totally.
- No, I'm sorry. Honestly, it wasn't you.

823
01:25:55,572 --> 01:26:00,035
So why don't we all talk
some strategy?

824
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:04,790
Let me introduce you to...
Professor Blackadder, Paola...

825
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,836
...this is Dr. Bailey.
- Maud.

826
01:26:09,086 --> 01:26:11,088
How do you do?

827
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:17,845
So do we really think that Cropper's
capable of robbing a grave?

828
01:26:22,099 --> 01:26:28,438
- The idea of opening a grave's creepy.
- Let's just keep going.

829
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:30,232
Jesus.

830
01:26:30,482 --> 01:26:36,071
<i>Moping owl doth to moon complain</i>

831
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:39,449
Are you ready?

832
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:43,620
Hold the light up.

833
01:26:57,926 --> 01:27:00,512
Fergus! Fergus!

834
01:27:00,762 --> 01:27:04,808
- That it?
- Yes. It's gotta be.

835
01:27:05,058 --> 01:27:08,979
I found it, Fergus. I found it.

836
01:27:15,444 --> 01:27:18,322
Oh, my God.

837
01:27:18,572 --> 01:27:20,699
I found it, Fergus.

838
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:22,743
Great!

839
01:27:22,993 --> 01:27:24,912
Hey, Cropper.

840
01:27:25,162 --> 01:27:27,956
Cropper!

841
01:27:32,753 --> 01:27:36,965
This has nothing to do
with you people.

842
01:27:45,724 --> 01:27:48,101
Get off of me! Get off!

843
01:27:48,352 --> 01:27:50,395
No, you don't!

844
01:27:50,646 --> 01:27:55,234
You traitor, you! Bloody conniver!

845
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:04,701
What are you doing?

846
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:30,936
- Are you sure we should do this?
- I said we'd take a look...

847
01:28:31,186 --> 01:28:34,481
...before we handed it over
to the museum.

848
01:28:34,731 --> 01:28:38,277
Can you hold that there?

849
01:28:54,668 --> 01:28:57,713
Maud, look at this.

850
01:29:13,312 --> 01:29:16,690
It's her handwriting.

851
01:29:43,842 --> 01:29:46,720
"My dear, my dear:

852
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:49,806
They tell me you are very ill."

853
01:29:50,057 --> 01:29:56,104
"Perhaps I am wrong to disturb you at
this time with unseasonable memories."

854
01:29:56,355 --> 01:29:58,482
"But I find I have...

855
01:29:58,732 --> 01:30:03,362
...after all, a thing
which I must tell you."

856
01:30:03,445 --> 01:30:10,536
"You will say it should've been told
20 years ago but I could, or would not."

857
01:30:10,661 --> 01:30:14,581
"You have a daughter...

858
01:30:14,581 --> 01:30:20,462
...who is well and married
and the mother of a beautiful boy."

859
01:30:20,712 --> 01:30:25,050
"I sent you her picture."

860
01:30:28,303 --> 01:30:31,306
"You will see she resembles
both her parents...

861
01:30:31,557 --> 01:30:35,060
...neither of whom she knows
to be her parent."

862
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:40,732
<i>"When I said at that terrible sance</i>
<i>that you had made a murderess of me...</i>

863
01:30:40,983 --> 01:30:46,822
<i>... I was speaking of poor Blanche,</i>
<i>whose end torments me daily."</i>

864
01:30:47,072 --> 01:30:54,955
<i>"And I thought, let him think so then,</i>
<i>if he knows me so little."</i>

865
01:30:55,247 --> 01:30:57,207
"I had a secret fear, you see."

866
01:30:57,457 --> 01:31:02,045
"I was afraid you would take her,
you and your wife, for your own."

867
01:31:02,296 --> 01:31:06,175
"But I could not let her go."

868
01:31:08,093 --> 01:31:10,512
<i>And so I hid her from you.</i>

869
01:31:10,762 --> 01:31:14,183
<i>And you from her.</i>

870
01:31:14,433 --> 01:31:18,145
<i>She loves her adoptive parents</i>
<i>most deeply.</i>

871
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:20,522
<i>Me, she does not love.</i>

872
01:31:20,772 --> 01:31:26,028
<i>So I am punished, living at Seal Court</i>
<i>with them and watching her grow.</i>

873
01:31:26,278 --> 01:31:30,908
<i>I have been angry</i>
<i>for so long with all of us.</i>

874
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:37,748
<i>And now near the end,</i>
<i>I think of you again with clear love.</i>

875
01:31:37,998 --> 01:31:40,292
<i>Did we not?</i>

876
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:45,422
<i>Did you not flame and I catch fire?</i>

877
01:31:45,672 --> 01:31:50,802
<i>Was not the love that we found</i>
<i>worth the tempest that it brought?</i>

878
01:31:51,053 --> 01:31:55,057
<i>I feel it was. I know it was.</i>

879
01:31:55,307 --> 01:31:59,478
"If you are able, please send me a sign
that you have read this."

880
01:31:59,728 --> 01:32:04,233
"I dare not ask if you forgive."

881
01:32:05,484 --> 01:32:09,363
"Christabel LaMotte."

882
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:14,159
Ash never read this.

883
01:32:14,409 --> 01:32:17,538
He never knew he had a child.

884
01:32:17,788 --> 01:32:22,501
You're descended from
both Christabel and Ash.

885
01:32:22,751 --> 01:32:26,672
My God!

886
01:32:27,506 --> 01:32:30,175
All these clues...

887
01:32:30,425 --> 01:32:33,762
...they're for you.

888
01:32:34,304 --> 01:32:37,724
For us.

889
01:32:49,862 --> 01:32:53,949
You're so beautiful.

890
01:33:22,186 --> 01:33:27,357
<i>There are things that happen</i>
<i>not spoken or written of.</i>

891
01:33:27,608 --> 01:33:30,027
<i>A poet walked out</i>
<i>one summer's day...</i>

892
01:33:30,277 --> 01:33:35,199
<i>... seeking forgiveness</i>
<i>from a love long lost.</i>

893
01:33:35,532 --> 01:33:39,995
<i>He found something else instead.</i>

894
01:33:40,454 --> 01:33:44,499
<i>This is how it was.</i>

895
01:33:50,547 --> 01:33:52,174
Morning.

896
01:33:52,424 --> 01:33:55,385
- Good morning.
- What's your name?

897
01:33:55,636 --> 01:33:59,848
May Bailey. But I have
another name I don't like.

898
01:34:00,098 --> 01:34:03,018
Do you?

899
01:34:03,268 --> 01:34:04,937
What's that?

900
01:34:05,187 --> 01:34:08,941
Maia Thomason Bailey.

901
01:34:13,237 --> 01:34:16,657
Well...

902
01:34:17,866 --> 01:34:20,994
Maia was the...

903
01:34:21,245 --> 01:34:23,872
The mother of Hermes.

904
01:34:24,122 --> 01:34:29,002
- And I know a waterfall called Thomason.
- A waterfall? Really?

905
01:34:29,253 --> 01:34:32,548
Yes, in Yorkshire.

906
01:34:32,798 --> 01:34:37,219
With a lovely cave hidden behind it.

907
01:34:37,469 --> 01:34:38,971
Where do you live?

908
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:42,850
I live in the house there.
And my mother lives there...

909
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:47,145
...and my father and my two brothers.

910
01:34:47,396 --> 01:34:51,316
And my Aunt Christabel too.

911
01:34:51,817 --> 01:34:55,904
Yes, I think I know your mother.

912
01:34:58,073 --> 01:35:00,659
You have the true look of her.

913
01:35:00,909 --> 01:35:06,999
No one else says that.
I think I look like my father.

914
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:11,461
You look like your father too.

915
01:35:12,921 --> 01:35:15,841
Can you make daisy chains?

916
01:35:16,091 --> 01:35:19,344
Yes.

917
01:35:20,762 --> 01:35:25,058
Yes, I'll make you a crown.

918
01:35:25,517 --> 01:35:28,312
But...

919
01:35:28,562 --> 01:35:32,149
...would you give me
a lock of your hair?

920
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:36,320
Like fairy story.

921
01:35:36,904 --> 01:35:40,073
Just so.

922
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,460
Now...

923
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:53,879
Would you take this note...

924
01:35:54,129 --> 01:35:57,549
...give it to your aunt?

925
01:35:58,091 --> 01:36:03,388
Tell her that you saw a poet
who was coming to meet her...

926
01:36:03,639 --> 01:36:05,390
...but met you instead.

927
01:36:05,641 --> 01:36:09,561
I'll try to remember.

928
01:36:09,645 --> 01:36:12,940
Thank you.
