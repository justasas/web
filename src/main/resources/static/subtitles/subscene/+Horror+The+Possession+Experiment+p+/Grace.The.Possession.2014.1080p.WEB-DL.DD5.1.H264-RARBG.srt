1
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:42,232
Mary, I need you to push.

2
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:51,243
Come on, Mary. Don't do this
to yourself. Just push. Come on.

3
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,506
I won't have this child!

4
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:03,752
- Please, God. Please help her.
- I have no god.

5
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:37,089
She's arresting!

6
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:38,790
We need to get the baby out now.

7
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,282
- Prep for emergency C-section. Scalpel.
- Ma'am, step back.

8
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:47,232
- Prepare for incision.
- Please, you have to save her.

9
00:01:47,332 --> 00:01:49,735
- How we doing on the mother?
- No improvement.

10
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:52,404
Please, God. Please help her.

11
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:54,940
She is only 18.

12
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,135
Okay, got the head.

13
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,736
Stand by on paddles.

14
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:06,185
I absolve you from your sins.

15
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:08,016
Clear.

16
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,513
- In the name of the Father...
- Again.

17
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:16,562
...and of the Son...

18
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:18,324
Clear.

19
00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:22,455
...and of the Holy Spirit.

20
00:02:24,236 --> 00:02:27,039
By the grace of God.

21
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:29,268
Amen.

22
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:55,422
Come on.

23
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,951
Come on.

24
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,367
Come on, let's go!

25
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,334
I'm late.

26
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,760
My God. I can't believe he went.

27
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,162
What's in style?

28
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:39,095
Hey.

29
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:42,100
- Sorry.
- I'm gonna miss you, honey.

30
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,364
I love you, Mom.
I'm a phone call away.

31
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:55,574
Later, guys.

32
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:58,784
Seriously, I'm going shopping.

33
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:00,444
Okay, Mom.

34
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,828
Excuse me.

35
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:12,728
- Hey, wait up.
- Lots of time.

36
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:56,997
Bless you.

37
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:58,376
Thanks.

38
00:06:58,476 --> 00:07:01,746
- What's up? Jessica.
- Grace.

39
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:04,449
- Nice to meet you, roomie.
- You too.

40
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:06,985
Fuck me.

41
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:10,422
What's in the bottle?

42
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:15,293
A little water, a little vodka.
Mostly vodka.

43
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,028
Want a swig?

44
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:20,356
No, thanks.

45
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,991
Suit yourself.

46
00:07:31,443 --> 00:07:33,435
Yes.

47
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,677
Hello?

48
00:07:44,623 --> 00:07:46,725
Grandma?

49
00:07:46,825 --> 00:07:49,318
Did you find your Bible?

50
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:52,621
I had to pack it for you.

51
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,867
I was going to, I just...

52
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:59,004
I... forgot.

53
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,874
Grace, you need to
keep God in your life.

54
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:07,479
- That place is full of sin and sex.
- It's not like that.

55
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:11,049
- If you came here, you would see.
- I know exactly what it's like.

56
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:14,252
Are you trying to hurt me?
Is that why you left?

57
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:17,355
No, it's just I had to
move out eventually.

58
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,559
That's exactly how it
started with your mother.

59
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:25,553
You are becoming more like her
every single day, do you know that?

60
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:27,959
I've made up my mind.

61
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,558
Sorry.

62
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:34,873
- What was that?
- It's just my roommate. I should go.

63
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:39,036
No. We pray first.

64
00:08:41,112 --> 00:08:43,207
Grace?

65
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:47,052
- I pray, Lord,
- Lord, that you enlighten my mind,

66
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,855
purify my heart and sanctify my soul.

67
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:53,220
- Amen.
- Amen.

68
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,652
Don't forget to pray.

69
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,336
So, all that praying and shit,

70
00:09:04,436 --> 00:09:07,138
what are you, like, super religious?

71
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:09,731
I suppose so.

72
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:13,939
Well, to each their own.

73
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:18,242
Where you going?

74
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:21,877
Wherever this takes me.

75
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,296
Hey, wait.

76
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:34,499
So was that your mom
on the phone earlier?

77
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:37,068
No, I live with my grandma.

78
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:39,571
Why was she being such a tight-ass?

79
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:41,406
I don't know.

80
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:42,774
What? Mark.

81
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,309
- Jessica.
- What's up, dude?

82
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,478
- My God. How you doing?
- Long time.

83
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:49,080
- I didn't know you go to MSU.
- Yeah, of course.

84
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,583
- This is my roommate, Michael.
- Hey, Jessica.

85
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:53,385
This is my new roommate, Grace.

86
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:54,586
Hey. Grace?

87
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:56,755
- What's up, Grace?
- Hi, Grace. Michael.

88
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:58,790
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too.

89
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,560
- Isn't this campus amazing?
- Yeah.

90
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,030
So, what are you and
your friend up to later?

91
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,731
- I don't know.
- Sigma Phi Delta,

92
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:10,835
they're having this angels and
demons party. It's gonna be sweet.

93
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:13,769
Personally, I think you'd
make a pretty sexy demon.

94
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:20,512
- I've been wondering if you could purr...
- Shut up. Get out.

95
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:23,181
- Yeah. Where is it?
- You gotta come with us.

96
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,410
- Yo, check this out.
- Get in here.

97
00:10:26,684 --> 00:10:29,521
Come on, let's do it.
All you guys, all right.

98
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:30,822
- You gonna go?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:34,192
- Nice to meet you, get in here.
- We need one more person.

100
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,125
One more.

101
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:40,065
- You. Come on in here.
- Me?

102
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:41,966
- Come on, come on.
- No, it's okay.

103
00:10:42,066 --> 00:10:43,868
- You're gonna do awesome.
- What?

104
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:46,838
- You're gonna do awesome. Here you go.
- Okay.

105
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,807
- I'm on the wrong side.
- You ready?

106
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:50,875
- I'm ready. You ready?
- I don't know.

107
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:54,312
- What do I do?
- Just tug as hard as you possibly can.

108
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:56,609
- Tug. Ready?
- Okay. No!

109
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,184
Come on, guys!

110
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,652
Come on, come on, come on.

111
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:01,853
Come on!

112
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,289
Come on. You can do better than that.

113
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,586
Come on.

114
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:09,752
Come on, guys. This is not...
Oof! Whoa!

115
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,395
That did not work.

116
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,868
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

117
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,437
- I'm Brad, by the way.
- Hi, I'm Grace.

118
00:11:19,537 --> 00:11:20,772
Nice to meet you.

119
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:23,208
Beer pong? Did I hear
beer pong? Wanna play?

120
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,043
- Beer pong?
- New girl, come on.

121
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,544
No. I'm fine.

122
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,779
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

123
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,482
It's not really her thing.
I'll be your teammate.

124
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:34,419
Okay. All right. All right, well,
really nice to meet you, Grace.

125
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,920
Hope to see you around.

126
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,757
- Are you sure you don't wanna come?
- No, it's fine.

127
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:41,092
Okay, all right.

128
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:43,061
- Okay.
- Bye.

129
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,131
- Here's your towel, bro.
- Who wants vodka?

130
00:11:46,231 --> 00:11:48,155
Child.

131
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,230
Come on, man.

132
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,430
Bless me with your infinite graces
so that I may remain pure

133
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,032
and protect my soul
against daily struggles.

134
00:13:28,132 --> 00:13:35,062
Defend me from the forces of evil,
and I am yours, forever and ever.

135
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:39,876
Amen.

136
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:09,795
What?

137
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,322
Grace. Grace.
Holy shit, wake up, dude.

138
00:14:24,422 --> 00:14:26,524
What is wrong with you?

139
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:29,049
Sorry.

140
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:33,623
Jesus. Freaked me out.

141
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:36,359
What were you dreaming about?

142
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:41,833
Goddamn. Vodka.

143
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,875
What time is it?

144
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:47,469
Ten-thirty.

145
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,273
No, no, no.

146
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:54,211
- Why didn't my alarm go off?
- I don't know.

147
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:58,017
- How'd you get that?
- What?

148
00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:03,594
I... I don't know.

149
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,790
I... I'm late for class. I gotta go.

150
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,112
Moods.

151
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:26,951
Who is that?

152
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:31,489
Well, so nice of you to fit
us into your busy schedule.

153
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:33,858
- I'm sorry.
- Have a seat.

154
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,990
- Who is that?
- That's Grace.

155
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,631
Take your time.

156
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:59,751
Now, we were talking about love.

157
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:01,619
- Hi.
- Hi.

158
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:05,418
It seems to me that an awful
lot of you really believe in it.

159
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:10,828
Well, I hate to break it to you,
especially the ladies,

160
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:15,958
but love is merely a
byproduct of evolution.

161
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,972
And over the course of this term,
we'll be learning about how

162
00:16:21,072 --> 00:16:25,476
all of our behaviors when it comes
to sex, whether it be cheating

163
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:31,539
or jealousy, monogamy, are all
motivated by simple biology.

164
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:38,418
And we'll get into that over
the course of this term.

165
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,359
Go long! Go long!

166
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,985
Yeah.

167
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,422
Yes.

168
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:49,267
My God. You did it. That is awesome.

169
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:50,735
- Good job.
- Thanks.

170
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:53,171
We just won the game.
Nice shot. Dickhead.

171
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:56,367
- Is that what you wanna play?
- What? What? No.

172
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:01,212
My God. You are so disgusting.

173
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:05,016
How is that disgusting? Next you'll
tell me you don't watch porn.

174
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:08,219
Yeah, of course I watch porn,
and, yeah, I masturbate,

175
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,389
but you hitting yourself in
the face with your own spunk,

176
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,957
I don't need to hear that.

177
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:15,860
It's not disgusting.
You're disgusting.

178
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,595
I'm wounded.

179
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:19,163
Thank you.

180
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:21,632
If I don't masturbate
once a week, I get anxious.

181
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:24,602
- Once a week? Try twice a day.
- I'm okay. Here.

182
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:26,237
That does not surprise me.

183
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,331
- What about you, Grace?
- What?

184
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,807
How often do you... You know?

185
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,076
It's gonna come out eventually.

186
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,490
I don't really do that.

187
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,993
Maybe she just doesn't wanna
talk about it, guys. Drop it.

188
00:17:49,093 --> 00:17:52,360
Like, ever?

189
00:17:54,098 --> 00:17:55,266
You...

190
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,369
Yo, are you a virgin?

191
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:00,404
Dude, come on. Don't say that shit.

192
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:04,809
No, I'm just... I'm just asking.
It's a legitimate question.

193
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:07,545
- Come on, you're just being rude.
- Yeah, come on.

194
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:10,314
- No, Grace.
- Don't listen to him. He's an idiot.

195
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:14,113
No, it's fine. I just have to
go to class. I'll see you guys.

196
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:18,953
Grace. I'm sorry.

197
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,791
Yeah.

198
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,086
Stop it.

199
00:19:45,443 --> 00:19:47,144
Grace. You made it.

200
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:49,213
- Brad.
- Nice to see you. How are you?

201
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,147
- Hey.
- So glad you made it.

202
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,419
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

203
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,822
- No, I'm fine.
- You look great, by the way.

204
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:00,591
And I've had a lot of these.
You need to catch up.

205
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:03,794
So I'm taking this. Can I take this?
Thank you so much.

206
00:20:03,894 --> 00:20:05,761
Okay. Ahem.

207
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:09,397
- There you go.
- Thanks.

208
00:20:11,435 --> 00:20:14,463
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

209
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:20,211
You okay?

210
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:22,847
Yeah, it just...
It kind of tastes like hay.

211
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:27,385
What? I thought all you small-town kids
drink your faces off, got shitfaced, no?

212
00:20:27,485 --> 00:20:29,120
- Hey, Brad.
- Yeah, what's up?

213
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,316
I am freezing my balls off out here.

214
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:35,926
Yeah, it's pretty cold.
Do you want to head inside?

215
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,996
- Sure.
- Yeah? Follow me, let's go inside.

216
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:40,765
- Okay.
- Nice outfit.

217
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,732
Thanks.

218
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:47,167
I hope it's okay I borrowed
some of your stuff.

219
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:50,241
Yeah, sure. Anytime.

220
00:20:50,341 --> 00:20:52,174
Okay.

221
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:02,353
Okay, so it's pretty insane in there,
so just follow me and it'll all be good.

222
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:03,554
- Okay.
- Ready?

223
00:21:03,654 --> 00:21:06,454
- Yeah.
- Let's do it. Whoo!

224
00:21:06,624 --> 00:21:08,719
Yeah!

225
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,992
Excuse me.

226
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:20,426
Sorry.

227
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,768
Nice.

228
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,780
Excuse me, coming through.
Coming through.

229
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,770
Excuse me.

230
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:34,485
- You into this kind of music?
- Yeah.

231
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,788
Yeah? Here, I don't
want you getting lost.

232
00:21:37,888 --> 00:21:40,950
- Okay.
- Excuse me. Coming through.

233
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:43,994
Got a train going on, or something.

234
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,730
Nice.

235
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,832
I don't know. Whatever.

236
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:51,102
- Excuse me, bro. Cheers. Cheers.
- Cheers.

237
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:54,264
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

238
00:21:58,142 --> 00:22:00,845
- Watch your head here too.
- Okay.

239
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:04,915
Joel, where are you?
Where are you? There you are.

240
00:22:05,015 --> 00:22:06,751
Come get liquor in your system.

241
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:08,309
Okay.

242
00:22:09,353 --> 00:22:11,345
That guy just threw up.

243
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,582
Okay.

244
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,894
Me, you.

245
00:22:16,994 --> 00:22:18,729
The little lady.

246
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:22,400
Whoa, whoa. If you didn't like beer,
you're not gonna like that. Powerful shit.

247
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,202
- It's like gasoline.
- No, I can try it. Seriously.

248
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,604
Hey, thattagirl.

249
00:22:26,704 --> 00:22:28,706
- Okay. All right.
- Bottoms up.

250
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,764
Cheers, cheers.

251
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,944
- I spilled it on my chest.
- You okay?

252
00:22:34,044 --> 00:22:36,046
- You all right?
- Yeah.

253
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,082
All right! We're good.

254
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:39,984
More. More.

255
00:22:40,084 --> 00:22:41,852
Round two, bitches!

256
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:43,785
Round two.

257
00:22:44,355 --> 00:22:46,985
My aim is so pro.

258
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,226
Round two. Ding, ding.

259
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,895
- Round two.
- Okay.

260
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,659
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

261
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,634
I love the poison.

262
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:02,595
Don't worry, we're gonna turn
you into one of us in no time.

263
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:07,077
One of us, one of us, one of us.

264
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:10,614
Yes! I just have to go to the
bathroom, but can you wait here?

265
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:14,015
- Sure. Yes, yes, yes, we can.
- No. No...

266
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,985
- Yes.
- Thanks.

267
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:21,392
- Hey, Grace.
- Hi.

268
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:24,261
I just want to say that
I'm really glad you came,

269
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,565
and I'm just happy to have you here.

270
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:31,432
- Thanks, me too.
- All right, cool.

271
00:23:38,409 --> 00:23:40,444
Three-thirty.

272
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,411
Pardon me.

273
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:50,020
Do you know where the bathroom is?

274
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,080
- Over there.
- Thanks.

275
00:24:34,031 --> 00:24:36,524
Wha...?

276
00:25:23,614 --> 00:25:25,538
Brad?

277
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:32,445
Excuse me.

278
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:04,142
Hey. Come dance.

279
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,552
Crazy bitch.

280
00:26:25,642 --> 00:26:27,600
Grace.

281
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,649
- You see how easy that was?
- What?

282
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:34,918
How I can just take him like that?

283
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:36,720
Why would you do that?

284
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,990
You steal my clothes,
you wear my makeup.

285
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,357
- I'm sorry.
- And for what?

286
00:26:44,027 --> 00:26:46,520
You're still a child.

287
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:50,668
Nobody wants you.

288
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:52,897
Leave me alone.

289
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:58,370
Do you even know what it feels
like to be touched, little girl?

290
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:02,780
- Just like your mother.
- How do you know about my mom?

291
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,349
- Another worthless...
- I'm not like my mother.

292
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,017
- ...ugly...
- Stop talking!

293
00:27:07,117 --> 00:27:10,145
- ...child!
- Stop it!

294
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:15,983
No.

295
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,437
My God.

296
00:27:26,537 --> 00:27:30,304
Grace! Been looking
everywhere for you.

297
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,364
What's up?

298
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:34,712
- What's up?
- I...

299
00:27:34,812 --> 00:27:39,149
- I didn't mean to do it.
- Okay, do what? You're freaking me out.

300
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:42,880
- What are you talking about? What?
- Jessica fell off the roof.

301
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:50,127
Is this some kind of a joke?
I don't understand.

302
00:27:50,227 --> 00:27:52,891
- What?
- There's...

303
00:27:53,397 --> 00:27:55,924
There's no one there, Grace.

304
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:59,470
But I just saw her there.

305
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,972
Okay, all right.

306
00:28:02,072 --> 00:28:04,308
- But...
- That's fucked up for you to do.

307
00:28:04,408 --> 00:28:06,310
Jesus.

308
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,312
Which one did I put my weed in?

309
00:28:08,412 --> 00:28:10,080
- There she is.
- Jessica.

310
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,707
Hey, guys.

311
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:15,619
Whoa, are you okay?

312
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:18,212
Whoa, Grace, whoa!

313
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,477
How are you feeling?

314
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:44,971
Any pain?

315
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,721
- What happened?
- We're still trying to figure that out.

316
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:53,212
You lost consciousness.

317
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:55,726
Jessica. Is she okay?

318
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:58,762
- Who?
- The... The girl that fell.

319
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,661
She...

320
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:07,504
Did you take anything?
Other than alcohol?

321
00:29:07,604 --> 00:29:09,369
No.

322
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:13,243
- You on any medication?
- No.

323
00:29:13,343 --> 00:29:17,114
- Has this ever happened to you before?
- No.

324
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,750
What about family? Follow me.

325
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,785
What do you mean?

326
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,776
Any history of mental illness?

327
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:28,192
My mother was on antipsychotics.

328
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:30,853
What's her condition like now?

329
00:29:30,994 --> 00:29:32,396
She died.

330
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:34,193
How?

331
00:29:34,531 --> 00:29:39,132
- Giving birth to me.
- And your father?

332
00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:42,227
I... I never knew him.

333
00:29:42,372 --> 00:29:44,330
I'm sorry.

334
00:29:45,342 --> 00:29:50,881
Well, aside from a nasty bump on
the head, you appear to be fine.

335
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:54,685
But I should tell you mental
illness is often hereditary.

336
00:29:54,785 --> 00:29:57,187
Early diagnosis and
treatment are critical.

337
00:29:57,287 --> 00:30:00,324
So I recommend you see a
psychiatrist as soon as you can.

338
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,587
You understand me?

339
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,685
- Yes.
- Good.

340
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:11,702
Wait, is there a phone I can use?

341
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:16,104
If you're looking for your ride, we
already called your emergency contact.

342
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:40,230
Coming up,

343
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,432
we have a nasty stretch of
weather coming your way.

344
00:30:42,532 --> 00:30:45,662
Break out the umbrellas
as it is going to be wet.

345
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,176
Did you have sex?

346
00:30:53,276 --> 00:30:54,912
No.

347
00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:56,246
Don't lie to me.

348
00:30:56,346 --> 00:31:00,409
- I'm not lying.
- And look at me when you answer.

349
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:04,082
I'm not lying.

350
00:31:06,623 --> 00:31:08,581
Okay.

351
00:31:11,728 --> 00:31:13,789
But you drank?

352
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:16,925
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.

353
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:19,997
I'm sorry.

354
00:31:24,274 --> 00:31:27,210
I think I need to see a doctor.

355
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,713
Grace. Why?

356
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:32,950
Because I'm worried I might
be sick like Mom was.

357
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,485
Now's not the time
for making excuses.

358
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:41,024
- I'm not. The doctor told me...
- I don't care what the doctor told you.

359
00:31:41,124 --> 00:31:44,061
Your mother suffered from
sickness of the soul.

360
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:48,292
That is not something
a doctor can fix.

361
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:56,363
Pull your skirt down.

362
00:31:57,307 --> 00:32:01,108
There's a jacket in the back,
and I want you to put it on.

363
00:32:01,845 --> 00:32:05,282
I don't want them seeing
you in that clown suit.

364
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,249
Who?

365
00:32:14,291 --> 00:32:16,283
Get in here.

366
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,450
Coffee's ready.

367
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:26,998
Come on in, Grace.
Don't be rude, say hello.

368
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:29,806
Hello, Father John.

369
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,864
Have a seat.

370
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,950
You look more like your
mother every time I see you.

371
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,680
I guess so.

372
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:49,259
I want you to meet the newest
member of our congregation.

373
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,497
He comes to us from
St. James Seminary.

374
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:58,235
- It's good to finally meet you, Grace.
- You as well, Father.

375
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:01,438
Well, I'm still a deacon.

376
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:05,642
But I plan on taking my vow
to priesthood very soon.

377
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:08,712
With Father John's
approval, of course.

378
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:11,203
There you go, Father.

379
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:13,982
Yes.

380
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:18,577
Well, until he's ready,

381
00:33:19,422 --> 00:33:21,992
Luke will be assisting me

382
00:33:22,092 --> 00:33:25,928
with those who need guidance.

383
00:33:27,664 --> 00:33:32,967
Now that you're back, I expect you'll
be spending more time with the church.

384
00:33:35,405 --> 00:33:38,075
Actually, I'm just gonna be
here for a few days, Father,

385
00:33:38,175 --> 00:33:40,440
and then I'm gonna go back.

386
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,570
What?

387
00:33:45,515 --> 00:33:47,906
You're not going back.

388
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:50,220
Wh...? Wh...?

389
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,856
I pulled you out of school.

390
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:56,426
- Why would you do that?
- It's done, Grace.

391
00:33:56,526 --> 00:33:59,451
- But...
- Not another word.

392
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,596
Home is where you
need to be right now.

393
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,079
Don't you speak of it.

394
00:35:23,179 --> 00:35:24,978
Understand? Not a word.

395
00:35:26,116 --> 00:35:27,983
Hello?

396
00:35:29,352 --> 00:35:30,654
Grandma?

397
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,746
Keep quiet.

398
00:35:33,723 --> 00:35:35,954
Listen to yourself.

399
00:35:45,068 --> 00:35:47,404
- Grace!
- Grandma.

400
00:35:47,504 --> 00:35:50,006
You know to keep away from there.

401
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,742
Grandma, there's somebody in there.

402
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:55,946
Ridiculous. Nobody's been in
your mother's room for years.

403
00:35:56,046 --> 00:35:58,949
- What?
- Go back to your room.

404
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:02,586
No, but, Grandma,
I heard somebody in there.

405
00:36:02,686 --> 00:36:05,145
Grace, now!

406
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:09,223
Grace.

407
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,998
You stay away from that room,
do you understand me?

408
00:36:15,098 --> 00:36:17,090
Yes.

409
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:39,854
Come on, come on.

410
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,958
Pick up.

411
00:36:42,058 --> 00:36:43,293
Is that Grace?

412
00:36:43,393 --> 00:36:44,494
Give me that.

413
00:36:44,594 --> 00:36:46,396
- Let me talk to her.
- Hang up.

414
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,227
Hello?

415
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:48,408
Grandma?

416
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:51,307
What?

417
00:40:06,162 --> 00:40:08,462
Who are you?

418
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:13,867
Who are you?

419
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,294
Make him suffer.

420
00:40:38,494 --> 00:40:42,193
Grace, you better be
getting ready in there.

421
00:40:43,499 --> 00:40:46,732
- Grace, do you hear me?
- Yes.

422
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:03,672
- Do I look all right?
- Yeah.

423
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:09,786
- Don't embarrass me today.
- I won't.

424
00:42:09,886 --> 00:42:12,914
But really I'm just excited
to wear the fancy robes.

425
00:42:14,857 --> 00:42:17,961
Did Alicia tell you we're
starting up a youth group?

426
00:42:18,061 --> 00:42:20,088
I see.

427
00:42:22,098 --> 00:42:24,625
- Good morning.
- Morning.

428
00:42:26,436 --> 00:42:29,737
Paul. Paul.

429
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,107
I have your favorite

430
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:33,939
- chocolate chip cookies.
- No, no.

431
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:42,051
Margaret, Margaret. Look at you.

432
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:44,320
You look beautiful.

433
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,656
Would you...?
Would you care for a sweet?

434
00:42:46,756 --> 00:42:50,426
It's a little too early
for cookies, dear.

435
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:54,089
It's never too early for sweetness.

436
00:43:00,903 --> 00:43:03,703
Where should I put these?

437
00:43:04,741 --> 00:43:06,836
Grandma?

438
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:10,041
Is everything okay?

439
00:43:11,013 --> 00:43:13,108
Give me those.

440
00:43:15,985 --> 00:43:18,888
Let temptation into your heart

441
00:43:18,988 --> 00:43:22,221
and the devil will destroy it!

442
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,129
We all feel it, every day.

443
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,666
Satan's grasp, calling us,

444
00:43:29,766 --> 00:43:34,933
asking us to betray God
for earthly pleasures.

445
00:43:36,005 --> 00:43:39,776
The Bible teaches
us to reject this call.

446
00:43:39,876 --> 00:43:43,074
To ignore this temptation.

447
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,343
But who among us is without sin?

448
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,390
It's easy to convince yourself that
you're walking the righteous path.

449
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,791
That you have remained untainted.

450
00:43:58,327 --> 00:44:01,560
Sin is like an open wound.

451
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:05,168
Left alone, it festers.

452
00:44:05,268 --> 00:44:09,126
Spreads, grows before your very eyes.

453
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:15,044
That is why we must
confront our mistakes,

454
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:17,375
correct them.

455
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:20,983
Grace.

456
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,518
Stop it.

457
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:26,852
Restore the purity of our souls.

458
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:32,087
It is the only way into heaven.

459
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,127
Let us pray.

460
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:40,764
- The body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

461
00:44:41,871 --> 00:44:44,603
- The body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

462
00:44:46,442 --> 00:44:49,675
- The body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

463
00:44:53,616 --> 00:44:56,917
- The body of Christ.
- The body of Christ.

464
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:26,444
What's wrong with her?

465
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:29,983
- Grace?
- Grace.

466
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:34,390
You are in church. How dare you?

467
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,893
She's so sorry.

468
00:45:36,993 --> 00:45:41,022
Out. Out. Out.

469
00:45:45,101 --> 00:45:48,197
I don't know what
has gotten into you.

470
00:45:50,773 --> 00:45:52,975
Is this because I took
you out of school?

471
00:45:53,075 --> 00:45:56,445
Is this some sick game you're
playing to hurt your grandmother?

472
00:45:56,545 --> 00:46:00,210
- No.
- Well, then, what is the problem?

473
00:46:04,987 --> 00:46:08,424
I've... I've been hearing things.

474
00:46:08,524 --> 00:46:13,156
There's voices inside
my head, and I just...

475
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,155
I keep having these nightmares.

476
00:46:18,034 --> 00:46:19,535
But they feel so real

477
00:46:19,635 --> 00:46:24,938
and I'm just a little
scared to fall asleep.

478
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,643
I need to know what
happened to my mother.

479
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,045
Don't start, Grace.

480
00:46:29,145 --> 00:46:32,181
- Everyone said she went crazy.
- Drop it. I said drop it.

481
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:36,552
What if the same thing is
happening to me? I need help.

482
00:46:36,652 --> 00:46:41,580
Your mother disobeyed me,
ran off and got pregnant.

483
00:46:41,991 --> 00:46:44,256
You do not need help.

484
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:47,587
You need God.

485
00:50:16,405 --> 00:50:18,534
Mama.

486
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:07,554
How did you get in there?

487
00:51:09,959 --> 00:51:12,495
The... The door was open.

488
00:51:12,595 --> 00:51:14,758
No, it wasn't.

489
00:51:15,898 --> 00:51:19,859
I told you to stay
away from her room.

490
00:51:20,936 --> 00:51:23,429
I'm... I'm sorry.

491
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:29,211
- What was that?
- What?

492
00:51:29,311 --> 00:51:32,509
- That noise?
- Nothing.

493
00:51:33,449 --> 00:51:35,317
- What do you have?
- Nothing.

494
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:37,887
- What's behind your back?
- Nothing.

495
00:51:37,987 --> 00:51:39,421
You show it to me.

496
00:51:39,521 --> 00:51:41,757
- Leave me alone.
- I'm not gonna ask again.

497
00:51:41,857 --> 00:51:44,193
Grace! Grace!

498
00:51:44,293 --> 00:51:45,995
You show me what's in there!

499
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:49,225
- No!
- Show me what's in there.

500
00:51:50,266 --> 00:51:52,902
Grace! You keep this up,

501
00:51:53,002 --> 00:51:55,666
you're gonna be just
like your mother.

502
00:51:55,871 --> 00:51:59,041
- Leave me alone!
- Open this door!

503
00:51:59,141 --> 00:52:02,444
Grace! You stubborn,
disobedient child!

504
00:52:02,544 --> 00:52:04,914
You open this goddamn door right now!

505
00:52:05,014 --> 00:52:07,216
You are a bastard child!

506
00:52:07,316 --> 00:52:11,921
Did you know that? A bastard!
You should have never been born!

507
00:52:12,021 --> 00:52:14,823
Your only father you
ever had was God!

508
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:18,928
You are just as simple
as your goddamn mother!

509
00:52:19,028 --> 00:52:21,664
I hate you! I hate you!

510
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:24,724
I hate you!

511
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,015
Morning, sunshine.

512
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,380
Brad?

513
00:52:49,758 --> 00:52:51,927
What are you doing here?

514
00:52:52,027 --> 00:52:54,730
Well, I came to see
if you were all right.

515
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,289
I came to visit you.

516
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,364
I missed you.

517
00:53:01,036 --> 00:53:04,440
I thought I'd be back soon, but...

518
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,135
Well, I guess I couldn't wait, then.

519
00:53:11,914 --> 00:53:16,715
You look great in the morning,
by the way.

520
00:53:17,553 --> 00:53:20,189
You think I look...?

521
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:22,919
I think you look beautiful.

522
00:53:27,696 --> 00:53:30,690
This can't be real.

523
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,258
You can't be real.

524
00:53:36,772 --> 00:53:39,367
If I wasn't real,

525
00:53:39,742 --> 00:53:42,576
would I be able to do this?

526
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,260
Would I be able to do this?

527
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,062
What are you doing?

528
00:54:00,162 --> 00:54:02,159
Trust me.

529
00:54:16,512 --> 00:54:18,573
My God.

530
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,312
Brad.

531
00:54:23,485 --> 00:54:26,615
Brad, Brad, slow down,
slow down, slow down.

532
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,218
Brad. Stop!

533
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,427
Doesn't that feel good?

534
00:54:31,527 --> 00:54:33,326
Grace?

535
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:40,724
My God.

536
00:54:46,675 --> 00:54:48,477
I'm sorry.

537
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:51,878
You need to learn that
what you did is wrong.

538
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,716
No! No! Grandma! Grandma, please!

539
00:54:53,816 --> 00:54:55,551
Filthy! Filthy! Filthy!

540
00:54:55,651 --> 00:54:57,152
- Turn over.
- Please stop!

541
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,356
Filth! Filthy! Filthy!

542
00:55:00,456 --> 00:55:03,825
Filthy! Filthy! Filthy!

543
00:55:32,421 --> 00:55:36,083
Grace? Look at me, Grace.

544
00:55:40,262 --> 00:55:42,531
If you can't control yourself,

545
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:46,262
how are you going to stop
men from controlling you?

546
00:55:46,435 --> 00:55:50,072
Your mother fought with me to leave
this church, look what happened to her.

547
00:55:50,172 --> 00:55:53,776
- She let some filthy stranger.
- Stranger?

548
00:55:53,876 --> 00:55:57,179
- open her up to sin
- What?

549
00:55:57,279 --> 00:56:00,079
...and that is what is
gonna happen to you.

550
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:02,584
Here's your stranger.

551
00:56:02,684 --> 00:56:05,814
Grace. Grace, get back here!

552
00:56:06,555 --> 00:56:09,958
You must understand, the needs
of the flesh are very real.

553
00:56:10,058 --> 00:56:13,796
The trials of life,
you are gonna experience.

554
00:56:13,896 --> 00:56:18,700
But in this room, we can talk about
it in, you know, a casual...

555
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,103
Grace. Hey.

556
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:24,473
I'm so glad you came.
Come on, please join the circle.

557
00:56:24,573 --> 00:56:26,241
Everybody, this is Grace.

558
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,844
- Hey.
- Hi, Grace.

559
00:56:28,944 --> 00:56:32,448
Now, we're talking a lot
about the pressures outside,

560
00:56:32,548 --> 00:56:34,883
but what about inside?

561
00:56:34,983 --> 00:56:37,252
The desires of the flesh.

562
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,888
Now, I know it's...
It's a tough conversation,

563
00:56:39,988 --> 00:56:41,957
but sexual desires are real.

564
00:56:42,057 --> 00:56:46,395
And remember, it's not
temptation that's the sin.

565
00:56:46,495 --> 00:56:48,964
It's how you deal
with the temptation.

566
00:56:49,064 --> 00:56:51,864
Does anybody want to share?

567
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,925
Grace?

568
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:56,404
Anything you want to share?

569
00:56:57,005 --> 00:57:00,108
- No.
- Okay, no pressure.

570
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,245
I want you to know that whenever
you do feel like sharing,

571
00:57:03,345 --> 00:57:05,948
- this is a...
- Really?

572
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:08,750
I heard that you were
pretty busy at school.

573
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:11,153
I thought that you'd
have lots to share.

574
00:57:11,253 --> 00:57:13,518
- All right.
- What?

575
00:57:13,755 --> 00:57:16,658
I only thought maybe
she could help us avoid

576
00:57:16,758 --> 00:57:19,127
making the same
mistakes that she did.

577
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,296
- Okay, Sally...
- Or,

578
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,298
the same mistakes as her mother.

579
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,567
All right, that's enough.

580
00:57:25,667 --> 00:57:28,934
Get off me! Get off!

581
00:57:30,205 --> 00:57:32,508
You're crazy!
You're just like your mother!

582
00:57:32,608 --> 00:57:34,908
Grace, what are you doing?

583
00:57:52,628 --> 00:57:54,723
Father John?

584
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:58,922
- No.
- Grace.

585
00:57:59,201 --> 00:58:02,337
What was that? Are you crazy?

586
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,339
I am crazy.

587
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,539
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
it like that. I just...

588
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:10,647
You can't haul off
and hit people, okay?

589
00:58:10,747 --> 00:58:13,181
Stop. Calm down.

590
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:16,616
You're gonna be fine.
I'm here for you.

591
00:58:17,886 --> 00:58:21,517
- Do you really mean that?
- Of course I do.

592
00:58:27,062 --> 00:58:29,131
I think you have the wrong idea.

593
00:58:29,231 --> 00:58:32,701
I... I don't know why I did that.

594
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:35,070
- Grace, calm down.
- I'm sorry.

595
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:36,505
- Listen...
- I'm sorry.

596
00:58:36,605 --> 00:58:38,336
Grace.

597
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:48,617
Grace? Grace. Grace,
please, get in the car.

598
00:58:48,717 --> 00:58:50,285
Grace, get in the car.

599
00:58:50,385 --> 00:58:53,355
- Get away from me!
- Grace, get in the car.

600
00:58:53,455 --> 00:58:55,757
Where are you going? Stop!

601
00:58:55,857 --> 00:58:58,860
- Grace, I need to talk to you.
- Leave me alone!

602
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,191
Grace!

603
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,976
Made me filthy.

604
00:59:51,613 --> 00:59:53,882
- It's not real.
- He made me filthy.

605
00:59:53,982 --> 00:59:57,078
He made me filthy.

606
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:58,687
It won't come off.

607
00:59:58,787 --> 01:00:02,290
- Get out of my head.
- It won't come off.

608
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,660
He needs to be punished.

609
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,129
- He needs to be punished.
- What do you want?

610
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:10,999
What do you want from me?
What? What did he do to you?

611
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:14,297
Look what he did to me.

612
01:00:14,936 --> 01:00:19,670
Just tell me. Just tell
me what happened, please.

613
01:00:24,846 --> 01:00:26,679
You'll see.

614
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:27,198
- You're hurting me.
- Stop crying.

615
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,695
God forgive us. God forgive her.

616
01:02:53,795 --> 01:02:55,463
Grace?

617
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:58,431
- Mama?
- Please.

618
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,269
- Help me, please.
- God forgive her.

619
01:03:01,369 --> 01:03:04,105
God forgive her. God forgive her.
God forgive her.

620
01:03:04,205 --> 01:03:06,374
- Please, help me.
- God forgive her.

621
01:03:06,474 --> 01:03:09,274
- No. Mama?
- God forgive her.

622
01:03:11,212 --> 01:03:14,549
God forgive her. God forgive her.
God forgive her.

623
01:03:14,649 --> 01:03:17,018
God forgive her. God forgive her.

624
01:03:17,118 --> 01:03:19,387
- Let go!
- God forgive her.

625
01:03:19,487 --> 01:03:21,377
Let me go.

626
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:24,678
Hello, Grandma.

627
01:05:27,982 --> 01:05:31,219
Grace. Thank God.

628
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:34,916
I've been looking everywhere for you.

629
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:39,851
Why are you wearing that?

630
01:05:46,501 --> 01:05:48,732
Sweet girl.

631
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:52,467
I'm sorry.

632
01:05:52,674 --> 01:05:54,507
Don't cry.

633
01:06:43,224 --> 01:06:45,319
Hello?

634
01:06:45,493 --> 01:06:47,861
Is anybody there?

635
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:06,171
Grace. Are you okay?

636
01:07:06,714 --> 01:07:09,514
Can I come in, please?

637
01:07:10,118 --> 01:07:13,578
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come. Come in.

638
01:07:17,725 --> 01:07:19,761
Is Father John here?

639
01:07:19,861 --> 01:07:23,162
I, I think he stepped out.

640
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:28,403
Hey, does your grandma
know you're here?

641
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:31,064
She was calling earlier.

642
01:07:31,306 --> 01:07:33,575
I already talked to her.

643
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:37,612
Grace, look, what's going on?

644
01:07:37,712 --> 01:07:41,182
She told me not to come home,
says she doesn't want me anymore.

645
01:07:41,282 --> 01:07:43,785
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

646
01:07:43,885 --> 01:07:47,186
Stop, you're fine.

647
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,825
I shouldn't have
come here. I'm sorry.

648
01:07:50,925 --> 01:07:54,055
Come on. Come sit down.

649
01:07:54,562 --> 01:07:57,699
Look, let's talk.

650
01:07:57,799 --> 01:08:02,804
I know that you've been under
a lot of pressure recently.

651
01:08:02,904 --> 01:08:08,970
I've just felt so out of place,
like I don't belong.

652
01:08:09,277 --> 01:08:13,014
I think we can all feel like
that from time to time.

653
01:08:13,114 --> 01:08:16,251
In fact, I've felt a
little bit of that myself.

654
01:08:16,351 --> 01:08:18,853
Well, I guess we're
not that different.

655
01:08:18,953 --> 01:08:22,015
You know what it
feels like to be alone.

656
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,589
Don't you?

657
01:08:25,026 --> 01:08:26,791
Yeah.

658
01:08:27,862 --> 01:08:29,729
I do.

659
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,872
Well, it's very late.

660
01:08:37,972 --> 01:08:40,141
Why don't we get you home?

661
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:44,042
If I ask you something,
would you be honest with me?

662
01:08:44,979 --> 01:08:47,870
Do you think I'm beautiful?

663
01:08:49,117 --> 01:08:51,186
Grace, I...

664
01:08:51,286 --> 01:08:54,155
Of course, you're beautiful, but...

665
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:58,056
Would you love me if you could?

666
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:02,086
God can't always fill that void.

667
01:09:06,167 --> 01:09:10,833
I cannot give you what
you're looking for.

668
01:09:11,639 --> 01:09:14,200
Don't you want me?

669
01:09:14,409 --> 01:09:18,040
Just once before taking the vow?

670
01:09:20,348 --> 01:09:21,449
Please.

671
01:09:21,549 --> 01:09:23,685
- It's okay.
- Please stop.

672
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:26,588
- Nobody has to know.
- Please.

673
01:09:26,688 --> 01:09:29,215
You don't understand.

674
01:09:31,059 --> 01:09:32,994
No, no.

675
01:09:33,094 --> 01:09:34,662
- Just take me.
- No, I can't.

676
01:09:34,762 --> 01:09:37,098
- I want you to.
- Stop, I can't.

677
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:39,759
You will.

678
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:46,941
- Stop, stop.
- It's all right.

679
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:49,611
God will forgive you.

680
01:09:49,711 --> 01:09:53,746
- Stop.
- Devil! Leave her.

681
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:17,870
She's coming to.

682
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:22,506
Bind her.

683
01:10:51,839 --> 01:10:53,672
Grace?

684
01:10:54,108 --> 01:10:56,277
Grace, wake up.

685
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:59,871
I recommend you keep your distance.

686
01:11:05,153 --> 01:11:07,180
She's awake.

687
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:14,929
- Luke?
- Grace.

688
01:11:15,029 --> 01:11:19,024
Do not look at him.
You will answer to me only.

689
01:11:19,267 --> 01:11:20,668
Who are you?

690
01:11:20,768 --> 01:11:24,501
I'm Bishop Michael,
and I'm here to help you.

691
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:26,796
What?

692
01:11:29,977 --> 01:11:32,146
Why am I tied down?

693
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,739
Show me the mark.

694
01:11:36,851 --> 01:11:38,586
Luke? What...?

695
01:11:38,686 --> 01:11:41,953
What are you doing? Stop it.

696
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:48,553
Please.

697
01:11:50,998 --> 01:11:53,059
Please.

698
01:11:54,635 --> 01:11:57,338
Why are you doing this?

699
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:58,973
Grace,

700
01:11:59,073 --> 01:12:03,077
if this is in fact Grace
that I'm speaking to,

701
01:12:03,177 --> 01:12:10,449
the symbol you possess is a mark
of a dark servant, a demon.

702
01:12:12,487 --> 01:12:14,222
What does that mean?

703
01:12:14,322 --> 01:12:17,850
It means you are losing
possession of your soul.

704
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:19,724
What?

705
01:12:22,864 --> 01:12:25,596
What's gonna happen to me?

706
01:12:25,833 --> 01:12:31,906
Grace, the ritual you're about
to experience is very dangerous.

707
01:12:32,006 --> 01:12:36,944
You must understand that I will do
everything in my power to save you.

708
01:12:37,044 --> 01:12:39,571
What are you gonna do?

709
01:12:43,784 --> 01:12:47,813
No, please, no.

710
01:12:51,959 --> 01:12:57,558
I speak now directly to
the evil hiding in this body.

711
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:00,835
- Reveal yourself.
- But I am Grace.

712
01:13:00,935 --> 01:13:03,237
Evil cannot hide in the house of God.

713
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:08,834
Please, please just let me go.
I feel better. I feel so much better.

714
01:13:10,778 --> 01:13:14,841
- Please, please stop!
- That's enough. You're hurting her.

715
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:25,293
It's not Grace that I'm hurting.

716
01:13:25,393 --> 01:13:27,283
Please.

717
01:13:27,929 --> 01:13:34,529
Brothers, we should begin
the ritual, as we've discussed.

718
01:13:35,937 --> 01:13:39,306
I didn't do anything wrong.

719
01:13:43,344 --> 01:13:45,302
Please.

720
01:13:49,317 --> 01:13:52,015
You're hurting me.

721
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,156
See the cross of the Lord.

722
01:13:55,256 --> 01:14:00,161
Be gone your hostile powers which
have assaulted this servant of God

723
01:14:00,261 --> 01:14:02,597
and clouded her with terror.

724
01:14:02,697 --> 01:14:06,467
I cast you out, unclean spirit,

725
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:09,670
along with every satanic
power of the enemy

726
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:13,040
every apparition from
hell and all your legion,

727
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,142
in the name of Jesus Christ.

728
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:20,411
The Lord be with you
and with your spirits.

729
01:14:24,318 --> 01:14:26,821
For he himself commands you.

730
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:31,158
He who cast you from the heights
of heaven to the depths of hell.

731
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:33,027
No one commands me.

732
01:14:33,127 --> 01:14:37,331
Tremble in fear, Satan.
Enemy of the faith.

733
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:40,568
Foe of the human race.
Begetter of death.

734
01:14:40,668 --> 01:14:43,504
Depart, persecutor of the innocent.

735
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:49,271
Depart. For you are guilty
before almighty God.

736
01:14:49,877 --> 01:14:52,079
Lord, hear our prayer.

737
01:14:52,179 --> 01:14:55,707
Our cries come before you.

738
01:14:58,252 --> 01:15:02,918
In the name of the spotless lamb,

739
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:08,029
I adjure you, ancient serpents,

740
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:13,534
the judge of the living and
the dead, and your creator,

741
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:18,906
he who has the power to
resign you to darkness

742
01:15:19,006 --> 01:15:23,365
that you depart posthaste.

743
01:15:24,378 --> 01:15:26,847
Your soul is marked, priest.

744
01:15:26,947 --> 01:15:29,781
- You broke your vow.
- Stop.

745
01:15:30,251 --> 01:15:33,819
- Silence, silence!
- God has forsaken you.

746
01:15:34,855 --> 01:15:37,883
Eternal suffering awaits you.

747
01:15:46,767 --> 01:15:49,067
What have you done?

748
01:16:13,494 --> 01:16:16,556
Hold her down!

749
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,408
Go, go.

750
01:16:36,751 --> 01:16:39,420
Christ the Lord brings
your plans to nothing!

751
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,013
Fear him!

752
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:46,190
Crucified as man, yet triumphed
over the powers of hell.

753
01:17:13,187 --> 01:17:18,115
You cannot run from
your sins, priest.

754
01:17:23,063 --> 01:17:25,766
You raped her mother,

755
01:17:25,866 --> 01:17:28,894
abandoned her...

756
01:17:31,839 --> 01:17:36,835
and left a child for me to take.

757
01:17:38,813 --> 01:17:43,115
Too long have you gone unpunished.

758
01:17:43,717 --> 01:17:47,382
I am your retribution.

759
01:17:54,395 --> 01:17:57,765
Do with me what you will.

760
01:17:57,865 --> 01:18:01,263
I go to the hands of God.

761
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,697
Let's see if he catches you!

762
01:18:22,890 --> 01:18:27,822
Devil! I command you to leave her.

763
01:18:28,128 --> 01:18:30,731
You can free her,

764
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:36,225
but only through death!

765
01:18:44,778 --> 01:18:48,170
I will not murder for you.

766
01:18:56,056 --> 01:18:58,151
Very well.

767
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,927
Wait, stop.

768
01:19:03,564 --> 01:19:07,593
Take me instead.

769
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:12,940
You give yourself willingly?

770
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:16,307
Only if you let her live.

771
01:19:18,012 --> 01:19:21,515
Her soul for a priest's?

772
01:19:21,615 --> 01:19:24,575
A worthy trade.

773
01:20:11,932 --> 01:20:13,822
Luke?

774
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:16,737
Are you okay?

775
01:20:16,837 --> 01:20:20,001
No, go away.

776
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:24,478
Wait.

777
01:20:24,578 --> 01:20:27,139
I'm sor... sorry.

778
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:32,152
Please, please.

779
01:20:32,252 --> 01:20:34,711
You have to go.

780
01:20:37,658 --> 01:20:39,958
Go!

781
01:21:18,198 --> 01:21:21,965
Father, we're ready for you.

782
01:21:53,902 --> 01:21:59,296
Hallelujah

783
01:22:05,146 --> 01:22:09,277
Hallelujah

784
01:22:13,688 --> 01:22:18,026
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

785
01:22:18,126 --> 01:22:19,959
Amen.

786
01:22:20,328 --> 01:22:22,559
Let us pray.
