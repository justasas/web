1
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:01,193
Oh, what did we drink?

2
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,862
I can barely see.

3
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,632
Where are we?

4
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,469
Come on. We gotta move.

5
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,811
Do you remember coming out here?

6
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,379
This is way too creepy.

7
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,947
I'd never let you take me here.

8
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,831
Did you hear that?

9
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,688
I can barely see,
but there's something.

10
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,291
Come on.
Let's get to town.

11
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,784
You are not the one.

12
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,620
There's no help for you here.

13
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,492
<i>Mein Gott.</i>

14
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,051
Yeah?

15
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,087
This morning?

16
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,589
Shit.

17
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,760
You know what this means,
don't you?

18
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,228
Fuck...

19
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,431
We're gonna have to talk to Sam.

20
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:02,534
Uh-huh.

21
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,904
You at the hotel
for the ferry drop off?

22
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,040
Right.

23
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,377
I'll be there to help
and so will Sam.

24
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,447
We'll talk to him tomorrow.

25
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,062
- Good?
- Yep.

26
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,034
Nice town.

27
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,103
I can see why this is
such a popular tourist spot.

28
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,807
It's better for us.

29
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:45,377
There's no hassle with people
getting in our shots.

30
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,045
Do they have a bar around here?

31
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,248
For food, you guys.

32
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,384
- Right.
- Right.

33
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,152
We need to see the sheriff
as soon as possible,

34
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:57,789
so... let's check in
and get on with it.

35
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,019
Morning, neighbor!

36
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,021
Jesus Christ, Lucas!
You scared the shit outta me.

37
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,023
Obviously.

38
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,225
You need to stop
sneakin' up on people.

39
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,926
You're starting
to creep 'em out.

40
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:38,130
Really?
You think that's what it is?

41
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,098
What the fuck do you want?

42
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,433
You called me.

43
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,237
Shit. Right.

44
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,838
We got our message today.

45
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,642
That is nothing but good news.

46
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,879
You're a sick fuck, Lucas.

47
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,914
You need to control yourself...
- yeah...

48
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,249
and just what are you

49
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,352
or anybody else
gonna do about that, Jacob?

50
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:03,121
Last time I checked,
you can't control your wife,

51
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,324
and that kid of yours still isn't
straight about what we do here.

52
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,528
So mind your own goddamn
backyard, you weak fuck!

53
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,697
Don't judge me.

54
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:25,911
We can ditch everyone
and go to the beach.

55
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:27,746
I'll bring a blanket...

56
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,549
It wasn't easy explaining
how I got sand all over me.

57
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,217
I still can't believe
my dad bought that.

58
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,821
I'm starting to think
they know what we do.

59
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,991
Actually, I don't.

60
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,761
My dad would be way too pissed
not to say anything.

61
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,665
I'm more worried
about your mom and dad.

62
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,934
What's to worry about?

63
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:52,103
My mom is cool with us for sure,

64
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,805
and my dad...

65
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,475
I don't know.

66
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,177
Lately he seems distracted.

67
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,079
He keeps walking away from me...

68
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,380
and he's always busy.

69
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,117
He's got a lot on his mind.

70
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,819
There's that film crew coming,

71
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,789
and my dad's really uptight
about that for some reason.

72
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,225
Yeah... that could be it.

73
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,206
So, do you have something special
planned for us at the beach?

74
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,342
Something to really
take me by surprise?

75
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,444
Um, maybe.

76
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,380
I hope you think
it's a good idea, but...

77
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,717
You always come up
with something good, Sam.

78
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,996
I had no fuckin' idea.

79
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,931
There were no pictures.

80
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,601
Well, this is the only hotel
on the island.

81
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:02,741
Hello.
How can I help you?

82
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:06,211
Hi, um, we have a reservation
for two rooms.

83
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,646
Right. The film crew.

84
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:09,414
The Ryersons and miss Caine,
was it?

85
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,516
- That's us.
- Okay.

86
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,191
Well, I'm headed over to the bar

87
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,761
to finish cleaning up
from last night.

88
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,963
I'll be back later.

89
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:28,433
But don't worry, Sam is
on his way to help you.

90
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,435
Fine.
I'm helping customers here.

91
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,105
Yeah, you're a big fuckin' help.

92
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,517
Um...

93
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,019
I'm sorry, you can pay
with cash or credit card.

94
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,423
Usually we pay when we leave.

95
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,358
We require you to pay up front,
sir.

96
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,796
Okay.

97
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,868
Okay.

98
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,843
All right, we have three
for the Ryersons,

99
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,479
and room two for April Caine.

100
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,018
If you guys need anything,
give me a call.

101
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,486
Thanks.

102
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,254
My son, Sam will help you
with your bags.

103
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,624
Sam?

104
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

105
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:29,928
I'll take that stuff for ya.

106
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,064
- Oh, thank you very much!
- Of course. Of course.

107
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:34,432
Just follow me, folks.

108
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,935
April, we're gonna meet
at the bar for drinks at seven.

109
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:39,270
Stace, we gotta go
meet the sheriff.

110
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,409
All right, this is the room.

111
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,144
Right over here.

112
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:46,878
Thanks, man.

113
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,246
Of course.

114
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,388
Hey, I know this is not
the Marriott or anything,

115
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,790
but if you need help,
look for me.

116
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,558
My dad's almost never here.

117
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,993
Cool, Sam.

118
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,863
Thanks, dude.

119
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,265
Thanks much.
You folks have a good visit.

120
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,712
This place
is an absolute shithole.

121
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,016
I don't know if I can sleep
in this bed, hon.

122
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,152
The bathroom's even worse.

123
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,687
What the hell?

124
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,989
Stace.
- What?

125
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,726
There's some stains in here
that look very... peculiar.

126
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,495
Ew. How's the shower?

127
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:40,565
Ugh!

128
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,400
Plan on taking a shower
after your shower.

129
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,769
Oh, that sucks.

130
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,507
Ugh, I stink.

131
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,015
Well, I'm just gonna
make the best of it

132
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,850
and try to get clean.

133
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,755
Sweaty...

134
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:11,596
Oh, babe, really?
In here?

135
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,164
This is nasty.

136
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,167
Yeah, I see your point.

137
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,048
Hello Jacob.
How can I help you?

138
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,983
<i>We got our message today.</i>

139
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,918
What message?

140
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,820
Oh, right.

141
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,155
There's always a payday.

142
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,389
<i>All right.
When do we start?</i>

143
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,758
As soon as possible.

144
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,092
I let Heidegger know.

145
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,727
He was overjoyed, of course.

146
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,996
Oh, and he absolutely
had to know?

147
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:48,500
Don't you think we're just
better off without him?

148
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,868
<i>This gets ugly, Jon,</i>

149
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,103
and Lucas
has the temperament for it.

150
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,938
Hey, you know where we are
on this, right?

151
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,673
This new girl
is our best chance.

152
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,442
Otherwise, there's only
one person left.

153
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,278
You know I'll do
whatever I have to...

154
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,780
to a point.

155
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,216
See, I keep my word...

156
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,452
<i>but not my Brooke.</i>

157
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,287
Nuh-uh, Jacob.

158
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,688
<i>We'll all die first.</i>

159
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,023
I know, Jon.

160
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,625
<i>We're all gonna do our best.</i>

161
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:14,692
Mm-hmm.

162
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,454
Welcome to elder island!

163
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,022
I'm sheriff Ree.

164
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,457
You're the Ryerson film crew?

165
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,092
Pleased to meet you, sheriff.

166
00:14:21,094 --> 00:14:22,393
Nice to meet you, sheriff.

167
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,695
My pleasure.

168
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,530
Is now a good time to talk

169
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,066
about our shooting schedule
and the island?

170
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,903
Well, yeah, you pretty much
can shoot anywhere you want,

171
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:35,106
but beware,
this island can throw people.

172
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:39,577
They get lost and we've had a few
incidents where they don't get back.

173
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,246
I can come by tomorrow at noon

174
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,414
and we can conduct
that interview...

175
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,883
but I gotta be honest.

176
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,385
I don't have a lot to tell you.

177
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,820
But as we discussed,

178
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:51,756
you can go, ask Wiggenstein,

179
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,391
he's the owner of the island,

180
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,627
well, he's actually the owner of
the hotel that you're staying at.

181
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,795
So I'll see you
tomorrow at noon.

182
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:58,730
- Great.
- Great.

183
00:14:58,732 --> 00:14:59,797
All right.

184
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,932
Thanks for the warning,
sheriff, I appreciate it.

185
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,233
- My pleasure.
- Thank you, sheriff.

186
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,935
- All right.
- Have a good day.

187
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,639
You folks be careful
out in the woods.

188
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:17,348
Honey, you're going to need
a lot more than that!

189
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,084
Excuse me, friend.

190
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:24,122
So good to see you.

191
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,224
Professor.

192
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,892
Good to see you.

193
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,829
This was in the fifties
on this island,

194
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:34,432
so you can imagine that there
was no forensic technology.

195
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,634
- This is an old native legend?
- Yes.

196
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:37,969
When I was doing my research

197
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:41,439
I invariably had to go to the
local natives to get anything.

198
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:45,443
Even people on the mainland are
tight-lipped about this place.

199
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,512
Some of my evidence
seems to suggest

200
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,781
that the reason
everyone is so...

201
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,449
closed off to outsiders

202
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,885
is that the islanders
actually have had a hand

203
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:57,188
in some of the deaths that have
taken place over the years

204
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,923
on this island.

205
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,660
Look at some of the documents
I brought with me.

206
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,470
The Wiggenstein family's
mentioned here.

207
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,072
The ones that own the hotel.

208
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,341
Yes. Uncomfortable, isn't it?

209
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,977
And this reverend really lived
here and called himself king?

210
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,011
Indeed, he did.

211
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,479
Leave him.

212
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,082
God will decide
if he lives or dies.

213
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,860
It's over, reverend!

214
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,697
You and yours must answer
for the murder of Hans Schultz!

215
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,802
Come out peacefully,
and surrender!

216
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,171
<i>You've pushed them too far,
my love.</i>

217
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,240
No, my dear wife.

218
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:51,242
I haven't pushed them enough.

219
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:54,112
And now they mean to arrest me
without justification?

220
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,680
For their sins?!

221
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,383
See it through their eyes.

222
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:01,686
It will be days before
the Mainlanders can get here.

223
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,354
The boys and I
will gather the flock

224
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,123
and set things right,

225
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,325
but not if they begin to shoot.

226
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,929
Show them that you are better.

227
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,732
That yours is the way of truth,

228
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,402
and the rest of the congregation
will follow.

229
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,604
No one will oppose you then.

230
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,675
My wife...

231
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,178
you are so wise.

232
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,849
You heathens!

233
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,834
You will pay for this!

234
00:18:56,836 --> 00:19:01,739
I will tear out your hearts
like you tore out mine!

235
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,044
Your family
will never have peace!

236
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,856
That could explain why he
didn't have many followers.

237
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,526
Preaching through fear
has never lost its appeal.

238
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,861
Oh, look at the time.

239
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,763
Look, I...

240
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,832
I have to go and
meet with some locals,

241
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,667
but I will be back.

242
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,137
Let's get together for a drink
and share some stories.

243
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,442
I'll be back later
for that drink.

244
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,312
Sounds good. See you later
tonight, professor.

245
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,847
Bye, professor.

246
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,726
The info he had seemed legit.

247
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,799
Some of it makes the families
on this island a little inbred.

248
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:03,901
Slim pickings for April.

249
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,103
I'm hungry.

250
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:09,073
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

251
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,813
Where is April?
It's after seven.

252
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:16,813
I don't know.

253
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,849
Do you think she got lost
finding the restaurant?

254
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,586
This is a restaurant?

255
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:22,887
It is!

256
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,922
It is a restaurant slash bar...

257
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,592
slash post office.

258
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,960
What?

259
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,466
Well, to answer your question,

260
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:38,236
no, I think she's just
taking a nap.

261
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,537
We'll give her
a few more minutes

262
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,972
and then we'll give her a call.

263
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:43,674
She'll never forgive us
if she misses dinner.

264
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,912
Hey you guys, I am totally
freaking out right now.

265
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,180
What happened?

266
00:20:49,182 --> 00:20:52,416
I swear I just saw something
in my bathroom.

267
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,318
C'mon, April,
don't lose it on us now.

268
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,487
No, I'm not! I was just...

269
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,222
in there, and...

270
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,461
This place sucks, okay?

271
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:06,097
I mean, are you both
sufficiently disgusted

272
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,598
by our lodging circumstances?

273
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,101
That was the grossest shower
I have ever taken.

274
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,003
I feel dirtier now
than I did before.

275
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,438
April, don't be scared, but...

276
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,641
Oh my god, what is it?!
What is it?!

277
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,843
Ned, not funny.

278
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:21,412
He's just being a jackass.
There's nothing on you.

279
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,546
I thought it was funny.

280
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:23,948
Time and a place, Ned.

281
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,351
Yeah, Ned.
Come on, isn't this bad enough?

282
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:30,121
Yeah, Ned, and we're hungry.
Let's order, huh?

283
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,657
This is a restaurant, too?

284
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:35,159
And a post office.

285
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:42,667
How are you folks?

286
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,402
Can I take your order?

287
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:47,571
Um, we haven't
seen the menus yet.

288
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,607
Suit yourselves, but...

289
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,509
there's only four things we got.

290
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:54,145
Chicken fingers, little pizzas,

291
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,514
beer, and hard liquor.

292
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,216
The rest of that menu

293
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:01,552
stopped being real
in the eighties.

294
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,589
Okay, um...

295
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,458
can you give us a second?

296
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,696
Suit yourselves.

297
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,731
Thank you.

298
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:21,405
Chicken fingers for me, I guess.

299
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:22,440
Same.

300
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,308
I'll take the little pizza.

301
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:26,877
And a shot.

302
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:28,779
And a beer.

303
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,649
That's a beer for me too.

304
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,721
Oh. Okay, I'll...

305
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,456
I'll go get the drinks.

306
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,793
You folks decide what you want?

307
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,295
Yes.

308
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:46,397
Two orders of chicken fingers,
one pizza,

309
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:49,066
three beers and a shot of Jack.

310
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:51,969
Got it.

311
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,406
It'll be about an hour
for the food.

312
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,608
An hour...

313
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,510
to microwave food?

314
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:04,281
Our microwave is very old.

315
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,991
Okay, uh...

316
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,926
Open a tab for us?

317
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,194
Already did.

318
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,064
Thanks.

319
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,732
Hey, hey.

320
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,734
How are you, my hippie friend?

321
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,640
What makes you think
I'm a hippie, captain?

322
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,976
I don't give a fuck
if you are or not.

323
00:23:31,978 --> 00:23:34,111
I'm just making conversation.

324
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,114
You look like one.

325
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,050
No. No, I'm...

326
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,420
not a hippie.
There's nothing...

327
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,487
wrong with that, is there?

328
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,822
Yes there is.

329
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:47,525
A bunch of
free-lovin' assholes,

330
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:52,596
doin' drugs, and generally
being weak human beings.

331
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:53,864
Like Manson.

332
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,566
He was a hippie, too, right?

333
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:58,636
No, not like Manson,
you ignorant fuck!

334
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,638
Manson was a hippie

335
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,540
but at least he had a plan.

336
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,810
He just... fucked it up.

337
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:09,447
The hippie in him fucked it up.

338
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,984
All right! Yeah.
Cool, man.

339
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,686
Well, uh...

340
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,988
You have a good night, too.

341
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,292
Where there is love...

342
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,527
let me seed hate.

343
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:37,041
Jesus, this place
cleared out fast of its...

344
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:38,542
four other people.

345
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,916
Oh shit! Hey, it's late.

346
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:47,651
We gotta go to bed.

347
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:50,554
April... you gotta
come with us.

348
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,492
We gotta go now...

349
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,628
I can't believe
I got this drunk.

350
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,164
Aw, come on you guys, one more!

351
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,500
No. Fuck no!

352
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,401
I'm going to bed.
Tab's paid.

353
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:06,637
Let's go.
Come on.

354
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,850
God damn, I knew
I stayed out here too long.

355
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,502
God damnit!

356
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,441
What the fuck is that?

357
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,078
Who's out there?!

358
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,081
Okay...

359
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:18,836
Uh-oh, baby.

360
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,070
No birth control.

361
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:22,539
We might've gotten pregnant.

362
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:37,221
Why the fuck would you say
something like that?

363
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,751
No. This will not pass.

364
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,221
He cannot rest here.

365
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:15,292
Those on the island
will bear this burden.

366
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,292
Oh... that's good.

367
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,799
You were so young...

368
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,768
and so sweet.

369
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,405
You begged me.

370
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,074
You cried.

371
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:15,078
You gave me so much more
than I gave you.

372
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,987
It's just not fair
to make me wait twenty years!

373
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,790
It's not my fault there's
no one left on this island,

374
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,725
you weak motherfuckers!

375
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:31,328
"Don't make it tough on us,
Lucas.",

376
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,532
"don't make it worse for us."
Fuck you, Wiggenstein!

377
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,235
I do all the hard work
on this island,

378
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:41,004
and all's you do
is kiss 'em goodnight.

379
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,711
Well, I'm ready for him
this time.

380
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,882
<i>So this has been your job
for the last twenty years?</i>

381
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:52,884
Just about.

382
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:58,455
And how many unusual deaths
have occurred here since then?

383
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,357
Boy, um...

384
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,925
Maybe seven to ten?

385
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,194
And what about the tales
of the, uh...

386
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,997
the reverend king
on this island?

387
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:10,834
Do you think the deaths could
have anything to do with that?

388
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,604
Every time I hear that story
I just have to chuckle.

389
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:16,740
An island king!
King of who?

390
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,742
Well, his followers,

391
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,078
who supposedly gunned him down.

392
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,548
That story's gotta be at least
a 150 years old.

393
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,318
I was talking
with professor Moore...

394
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,622
and not only did he claim
the legends were true, but...

395
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:33,790
he also inferred that some of
the natives on this island

396
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,225
have seen
the reverend's presence

397
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,295
more than once
over the past century.

398
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,931
Do you have any comment
on that, sheriff?

399
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:44,902
Look, there's no connection between
the deaths and the reverend.

400
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:49,940
That is an old native tale
and it's ridiculous!

401
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:51,909
You know,
this has been a good time,

402
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,477
but I gotta get back to work.

403
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,583
Okay...

404
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,952
Well, thank you, sheriff,
you did a great job.

405
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,856
You know, there's a lot of crazy
stories about this island..

406
00:32:05,858 --> 00:32:08,358
Some true... most not.

407
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,295
You know, somebody embellishes
an old tale

408
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:12,796
and credits it to natives,

409
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,032
and you got yourselves
the truth.

410
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:18,368
It's true that people gonna believe
what they want to believe.

411
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,838
But what's also true that if
you look too deep into this,

412
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,408
you're gonna find
more than you bargained for.

413
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,878
You folks have a safe stay.

414
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,680
You can let yourselves out.

415
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:07,050
<i>"...it is believed that some
of the families on the island</i>

416
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,585
<i>have been part of
the horrendous crimes</i>

417
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,153
<i>that have been committed.</i>

418
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,556
<i>Heiddegger, Ree...</i>

419
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,958
<i>and Wiggenstein."</i>

420
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,527
This can't be real.

421
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,795
We really need that interview.

422
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,230
What was with the sheriff guy?

423
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:22,532
One minute he's fine
and then the next minute

424
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,569
he was freaking out 'cause you
started talking about the reverend.

425
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:28,171
Wasn't that forever ago?

426
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,606
I dunno, maybe...

427
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:31,975
one of his ancestors
was involved.

428
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,643
I don't know.

429
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:36,780
Why was he so adamant that this has
nothing to do with the island's history?

430
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,749
We weren't even asking him that.

431
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:41,184
Did he misunderstand
the question

432
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,053
or were we insinuating it?

433
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,589
Maybe...

434
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,090
Well, let's not worry about it.

435
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,592
When we get back we'll just
look at the footage and...

436
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:50,794
Oh, shit!

437
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:52,029
Oh, my god.

438
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,967
That's the professor's hat.

439
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,038
Hey, you're okay.
You're okay. Hold on.

440
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,939
I gotta get this.
- Oh, god.

441
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,842
Don't touch anything.

442
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,948
Be careful.

443
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,023
Let's get the hell outta here.

444
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,027
Go on.
- Oh, my god.

445
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,302
Sheriff! Sheriff!

446
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:35,238
We found a body in the woods!

447
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,074
We think it's our friend,
professor Moore.

448
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:40,043
Take it easy.
Take a deep breath.

449
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,679
Now, tell me what you saw.

450
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,082
We're pretty sure.

451
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:48,518
It was bad, but it was his hat.

452
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,820
It was definitely his hat.

453
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:51,788
That does not sound good.

454
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,124
Why don't you show me.

455
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,160
Follow me.

456
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,930
Then...

457
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,898
they shot the reverend's family!

458
00:35:06,205 --> 00:35:07,804
I don't believe it.

459
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,540
I mean, my dad
is the sheriff here.

460
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,142
How could he not
know about this?

461
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,178
He must know.

462
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,082
Don't get me wrong, Sam.
I believe you, but...

463
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:20,817
still...

464
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,323
What?

465
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,792
There's more...

466
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,162
but my dad said
he'd tell me later.

467
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:33,864
God, I hate this place.

468
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,434
We have to get off this island.

469
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,512
I know how crazy
all this sounds...

470
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,214
but I have a plan...

471
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,016
to get us out of this.

472
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,353
Actually, I've had a plan...

473
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:58,822
I just didn't know
when we could use it...

474
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,257
until now.

475
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,207
Wow, you have been planning.

476
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,377
New York...

477
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,580
Oh my god, Sam,
you know that's my dream.

478
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:24,915
I know.

479
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,249
That's why I picked it.

480
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,386
We can leave Sunday night
on the ferry.

481
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,291
How are we just gonna disappear?

482
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:37,894
I'm working on that.

483
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,740
So this is just
how you found him?

484
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:54,411
You didn't touch him
or take anything off the body?

485
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,381
No, that's, uh...

486
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,650
That's how we left him.

487
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:01,952
Looks bad.

488
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,262
I'm gonna have to get you folks
back into town.

489
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,498
I've suddenly got
a lot of work to do.

490
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,969
Jesus Christ, you guys.

491
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,406
I signed up
to be in a documentary,

492
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,276
not deal with this crazy shit!

493
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:31,848
I've never seen anything
like that before!

494
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,383
We haven't either.

495
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:40,257
I really wanna get out of here.

496
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,092
I know you do, April,

497
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,693
but it's too late
to get a boat back tonight.

498
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,328
We're gonna have to
try tomorrow.

499
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,964
I've just never seen
a dead body before.

500
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,666
I don't know if I can take this.

501
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,135
I'm gonna go...

502
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,237
go back to my room
and lay down and...

503
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:59,876
if you guys go anywhere, you
promise you'll come get me, right?

504
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:01,444
- Absolutely.
- Sure.

505
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:02,746
Okay.

506
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,987
I think we should get the hell
out of here.

507
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,491
I wanna finish this
just as bad as you do,

508
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:17,193
but something
does not feel right.

509
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:19,396
Plus, April didn't sign on
for this.

510
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,799
But it was an accident.

511
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,568
His leg got caught in a trap
and an animal got him.

512
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,137
If we're careful,
we stick together...

513
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,240
Stacy, something doesn't
feel right.

514
00:38:30,242 --> 00:38:32,442
We need to get out of here.

515
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:34,811
Oh, come on.

516
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,546
They warned us about those woods

517
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:37,647
over and over again.

518
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:40,483
He shouldn't have been
out there by himself.

519
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,786
I don't think he would want us
to give up this easily.

520
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:44,721
This is his work...

521
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:46,956
Stacy, I think he was murdered.

522
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,093
I saw the body up close.

523
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:51,861
No animal does that!

524
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:55,098
His head was cut clean off,
his arms were cut clean off!

525
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,567
There wasn't a bite mark
on him...

526
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:01,905
plus, his fucking heart
was ripped out!

527
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:06,242
I would've told you sooner, but I've
been trying to process it myself.

528
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,378
It doesn't feel right.

529
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,014
We need to get the hell
out of here.

530
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,834
Looks like something
got to the body.

531
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,271
Someone.
He was hacked apart.

532
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,410
Heidegger.

533
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:42,812
Did you contact
the mainland authorities?

534
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:44,080
Not a chance.

535
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,850
Good. Still...

536
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:50,754
we're losing control of him.

537
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:05,935
Ugh.

538
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,180
I'm going out.

539
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,667
Where the hell are all the men?

540
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,439
I've been asking myself
that question for years.

541
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,107
Oh, man!

542
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:46,509
So, what'cha havin', girlie?

543
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,212
Um, I don't know...

544
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,449
You got any Tequila?

545
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:55,485
Damn! Hittin' the hard stuff!

546
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:56,820
You know...

547
00:40:56,822 --> 00:40:59,889
So, you're gonna
have one with me, right?

548
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,860
All right.

549
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,195
Nice.

550
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,032
You like worms?

551
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:10,366
Sure.

552
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,477
- You ready for this?
- Oh, yeah.

553
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,245
Bottoms up!

554
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,519
That's good.
Let's do one more.

555
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,223
- You gotta chase
that cough away.

556
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:35,225
Yeah, that's quite the burn.

557
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,407
Okay, sweetie...

558
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,742
I gotta close up.

559
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:55,311
No, Maria, no...

560
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,615
I can't go back to that hotel.

561
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,285
That place is so creepy.

562
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,258
That's my family's hotel.

563
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,929
Yeah, I didn't mean like...

564
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:14,597
I didn't mean like creepy,

565
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:17,567
like creepy, creepy, I just...

566
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:20,770
Oh, it's just this island
has me freaked out,

567
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:25,775
and the professor today
was more than I could take.

568
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:28,111
It's just too much.

569
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:32,916
That must've been so scary,
sweetie...

570
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:35,785
seein' him all cut-up.

571
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:38,655
Yeah.
It was horrible.

572
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:41,124
It was the fucking worst.

573
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:46,033
Can I just stay here?
Like, sleep right here?

574
00:42:46,058 --> 00:42:47,230
No, no, no, no.

575
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,966
Come on, time to go.

576
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:52,101
I gotta close up now.

577
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:55,004
Okay... okay...

578
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:58,641
Okay.

579
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,044
I'm fine.

580
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,379
Yeah.

581
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:08,318
- Come on, girlie.
- Okay, I'm coming.

582
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,322
Thank you.

583
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,629
Thanks for talking to me, Maria.

584
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:21,164
See you tomorrow.

585
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,800
- Good night.
- Thanks.

586
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,147
Hello, Maria.

587
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:39,682
What the fuck
are you doing here?

588
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:43,319
What your husband should have
long ago.

589
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,157
Now, let's see...

590
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,161
if we can find some niceness
pm the inside.

591
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:25,061
Ned?

592
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,332
Stacy?

593
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,389
Heya.

594
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,475
You've gotta be shitting me.

595
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:54,577
This is way too easy.

596
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,583
Please, somebody help me!
Please!

597
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:02,318
Please help me!
- Hey!

598
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,687
You weren't planning
on leaving just yet, were you,

599
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,222
you little fucking slut!?

600
00:47:06,224 --> 00:47:07,890
Get your jacket off!
Get it off!

601
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:09,158
Get it off!

602
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,395
Okay! Okay! I'll do
whatever you want, just...

603
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:16,365
Oh, I know you'll do anything.
Blah, blah, blah, blah!

604
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:18,267
Let me just tell you this.

605
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:21,370
By the time I'm done,

606
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:24,173
you're going to be dying
for him.

607
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,542
Shh!

608
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:32,048
We're gonna get real close.

609
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,818
Sam, you want some breakfast?

610
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,521
Sam... where are you going?

611
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,157
Be right back.

612
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,327
Where's mom?

613
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:26,495
I don't know.
You know your mom.

614
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,098
Yeah, I thought so.

615
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:34,603
April!

616
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,773
April, are you in there?

617
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,245
Where the hell is she?

618
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:49,185
This is so fucked up.

619
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:50,586
We gotta find her.

620
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:51,921
Let's go to the sheriff.

621
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,039
Oh, fuck.

622
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:20,016
Hey, nice backpack!
Is that new?

623
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:22,451
Yeah, my folks
just got it for me.

624
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:24,387
How you doing this morning, bud?

625
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:26,889
So far, so good.

626
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:28,891
You look a little worried man,

627
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:30,192
and I'll tell you what,

628
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:33,195
there's much in this world
to be nervous about...

629
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,031
and friends and family
aren't two of 'em.

630
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:37,066
And we are
friends and family, eh?

631
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:40,102
Look, don't get too agitated.

632
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:42,371
You stick with us
and we'll stick with you.

633
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,639
Right?

634
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,208
Sure, got it.

635
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,344
Thatta boy!

636
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:50,079
You're gonna get
along just great.

637
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:51,680
So, you looking for Brooke?

638
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:53,649
Yeah, I was actually
just headed over there.

639
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:55,051
Hop in.

640
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:12,468
Ah!

641
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,414
Hey, Sam. Hi, dad.

642
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,582
What's up?

643
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:27,817
I was gonna get some ice cream

644
00:51:27,819 --> 00:51:29,118
and wanted to see
if you'd come along.

645
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,619
Is that cool with you, dad?

646
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:34,190
Sure sweetheart.
Have fun.

647
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:36,125
You look after my girl, Sam.

648
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:37,159
Yes, sir.

649
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,295
Come on.

650
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,305
You're not gonna believe this.

651
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,125
Oh, my god.

652
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:11,060
I got that in the woods.

653
00:52:11,062 --> 00:52:13,496
It was that professor's
that was staying at the hotel.

654
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:15,898
He's dead.

655
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,703
Do you know what this means?

656
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,639
Things are gonna get
a lot worse around here.

657
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:27,877
Well... if it isn't
the island pups.

658
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:35,951
Oh, my, you have grown
into a beautiful woman.

659
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,221
You're a lucky boy, Sam.

660
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,690
Thank you.

661
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,926
I wanted you
to tell your father...

662
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:46,529
that I took care of April.

663
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,297
He'll know what that means.

664
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,499
I'll let him know.

665
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,500
Thank you, Mr. Heidegger.

666
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,102
I'm sure you will, dear.

667
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,371
You know,

668
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:57,573
it was such a pleasure
to see you again.

669
00:52:57,575 --> 00:53:01,277
I would like to deliver more
messages through you in the future.

670
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,947
A treasure like you...

671
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,751
Have a nice day, sweetie.

672
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:09,852
Sam.

673
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,527
I contacted
the mainland sheriff's office

674
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,896
and I reported you finding
the professor's body.

675
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:22,031
We're sorry to disturb you,
sheriff.

676
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:23,499
It doesn't have to do with that.

677
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:25,000
We can't find April.

678
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,837
Please, have a seat.

679
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,574
That cute little girl
you came with...

680
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,609
When's the last time
you saw her?

681
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:37,413
- Last night.
- Yeah.

682
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:39,014
We waited for her
to come down for breakfast,

683
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:40,816
but she never showed up,

684
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:43,185
so we went to her room,
but she wasn't there.

685
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:45,454
Is it possible
that she's still asleep?

686
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:48,023
No, we checked. Room's empty.

687
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:50,993
I have to get this.

688
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,097
Hello. Sheriff Ree, here.

689
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,699
<i>Where the fuck is Maria, Jon?</i>

690
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:58,300
How the hell
am I supposed to know?

691
00:53:58,302 --> 00:53:59,602
She's your wife.

692
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:02,271
<i>Fuck you, Jon.
I know what's up.</i>

693
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:03,539
<i>I haven't seen her all day.</i>

694
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,040
<i>She didn't come home last night.</i>

695
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,976
All right, all right, already.

696
00:54:06,978 --> 00:54:09,778
Fine, I'll be over soon.

697
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:13,782
Look...

698
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,453
I know you're disconcerted
about what you saw...

699
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:20,222
Sheriff, with all due respect,
we already had one person die...

700
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:25,160
And you honestly think there
were two killings in two nights?

701
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:26,629
- Well...
- Look...

702
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:30,232
Why don't you two go look
for your friend?

703
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:33,269
It's a small town and she could
go missing for hours.

704
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:36,338
And if you don't find her
by six,

705
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,140
you come back and see me.

706
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:39,942
I'll keep an eye out

707
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:43,145
and leave a message at your
hotel if I hear anything, okay?

708
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,049
Thank you, sheriff.

709
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,951
Of course.

710
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,486
You folks be careful now.

711
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,257
Hi, darlin'!

712
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,492
Hey, daddy.

713
00:54:56,494 --> 00:54:58,060
What's on your mind, girl?

714
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:00,095
Mr. Heidegger just spoke to me.

715
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:02,898
- He did?
- Yeah, just now.

716
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,734
He said that you would
know what he meant

717
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:09,004
if I told you that April
had been taken care of.

718
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:10,406
Who's April?

719
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:13,242
What the f...

720
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:16,812
Jesus Christ, he's gonna
screw this whole thing up.

721
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,959
Afternoon, sheriff...

722
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,562
Jacob.

723
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,432
What can I do for you?

724
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:38,033
Cut the shit.

725
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:40,135
You got the girl in there
or what?

726
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:41,437
We don't have time for games,
Lucas.

727
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:43,072
She's none of your concern.

728
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:47,910
I told your lovely daughter
it was taken care of.

729
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:51,914
Let's not forget, your Brooke
may be our last hope.

730
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:57,152
Don't you mention my daughter.
Don't you look at my daughter!

731
00:55:57,154 --> 00:56:00,022
To you, my daughter
doesn't exist!

732
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,690
Jon, let him go.

733
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:03,926
Jon, this won't do us any good.

734
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,568
Do you know where she is?

735
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,570
I took care of it.

736
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:25,547
Lucas, what have you done?

737
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,249
What had to be done.

738
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:29,551
I shouldn't have to
explain myself to you!

739
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,887
She could have been the one,
you fool!

740
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,789
- You've put us all at risk...
- No!

741
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,457
I dealt with it!

742
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:37,459
She was way too much
of a whore for him!

743
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:39,161
He'd have never taken her!

744
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:40,596
Besides...

745
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:43,265
now she can't go back
and start asking questions.

746
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:47,369
Everyone is off-limits to you!

747
00:56:47,371 --> 00:56:48,837
Nobody would have started
asking anything at all

748
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:50,539
if you'd just let it be.

749
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,008
Where's the body?

750
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,484
He's fucking lost it.

751
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:03,986
I mean,

752
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:05,754
who chops a body
into little pieces

753
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,656
and buries them
next to his tomatoes?

754
00:57:07,658 --> 00:57:09,458
A psychopath, that's who!

755
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,594
- We all know Lucas's deficits...
- oh, cut it out.

756
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,130
That's unnecessary and...

757
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,632
he enjoys it.

758
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,301
I need to have
a serious talk with him.

759
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:20,369
Good.

760
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:22,971
Where's Maria?

761
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:40,122
I still can't believe that my folks
have anything to do with this.

762
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,790
I'm freaking out.

763
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:42,991
I know.

764
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:45,093
I couldn't get to sleep
last night,

765
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,361
and when I did,
I had this awful dream

766
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:48,664
about being chased
into the woods by something

767
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,966
and running as fast as I could.

768
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:53,435
I am so scared Sam.

769
00:57:53,437 --> 00:57:54,903
What are we gonna do?

770
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,406
We have to leave today,

771
00:57:57,408 --> 00:57:58,841
tonight....

772
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,543
but I have to warn that couple.

773
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,381
Okay, spend the rest of the day
getting some stuff,

774
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:08,350
only the most important stuff,

775
00:58:08,352 --> 00:58:10,672
and wait 'til your dad's left
the house to get it together.

776
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,956
Put your stuff in
a waterproof bag for our trip.

777
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:16,391
Tonight, we'll split off

778
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:17,893
and into the docks.

779
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,162
Okay...

780
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,565
but I'm still scared.

781
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:27,269
Hey... me too.

782
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,239
We just have to
keep it together for today.

783
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:39,781
We can do this.

784
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:41,450
Watch and listen.

785
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:42,951
I'll do the same.

786
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:47,256
Maybe we can get some info
that might help us.

787
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:50,092
And that couple at the hotel?
You can warn them?

788
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:53,262
I have to try.

789
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,767
I'll see you later.
Be careful, okay?

790
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,068
You, too.

791
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:11,079
- Great.
- Jesus.

792
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:14,082
No sign of April anywhere
and now, no sheriff.

793
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:17,386
I can't fucking believe this
island has no cell service.

794
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,357
Where the hell is he?

795
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,597
This is bad in so many ways.

796
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:31,800
Did you find April?

797
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,338
Yes, I found her body.

798
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,375
Are you tellin' us
that April's dead?

799
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:41,677
That's what I'm telling you.

800
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,879
What the hell is going on here?

801
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:47,015
That has to be wrong.

802
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:50,452
You need to explain this
to us, sheriff.

803
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:52,721
Yeah, we're responsible
for her, sheriff.

804
00:59:52,723 --> 00:59:54,656
Hey, I warned you
about the woods.

805
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:56,658
These things happen!

806
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,697
Is that some kind of
fucking joke?

807
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:04,166
You might wanna watch it here,
Mr. Ryerson.

808
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:06,301
Don't you make my job
any harder.

809
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,274
You two get back to your room
and wait for my call.

810
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,676
This whole mess could be over
for you soon.

811
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:18,714
Come on.

812
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:20,182
Come on.

813
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:28,924
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Make sure you get all our stuff.

814
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:31,093
Don't leave anything behind.
- All right, hurry!

815
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:32,694
We're gettin' the hell
outta here.

816
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:35,530
God, that sheriff
scared the shit out of me!

817
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:37,833
Don't worry, we're not gonna
see his ass again!

818
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:42,704
Who the hell is that?

819
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:50,245
Careful. You be careful.

820
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,481
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

821
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:54,282
Hey, hey, I'm here to help, man!
I'm here to help!

822
01:00:54,284 --> 01:00:55,884
I'm just hear to help.

823
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:58,553
Okay, okay, okay.

824
01:00:58,555 --> 01:01:00,389
Okay, okay.

825
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,193
You folks need
to get off this island.

826
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:07,496
Tell us something
we don't know, kid.

827
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:08,797
I know a way outta here.

828
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,433
Oh, my god, that's great!

829
01:01:11,435 --> 01:01:14,736
But, you have to take me
and my girlfriend with you.

830
01:01:14,738 --> 01:01:16,371
We don't know anyone
on the mainland

831
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,640
and we need help
once we get there.

832
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:20,042
That's no problem, man.

833
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:22,044
We get off this island, Sam,
you have no worries.

834
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:23,445
No worries!

835
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:25,547
Okay, then we have to get going.

836
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:26,782
We'll pack everything up.

837
01:01:26,784 --> 01:01:29,184
We'll meet you out front in ten minutes.
Ten minutes!

838
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,019
Okay, I'll get my girlfriend and
a few things and be right back!

839
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:33,221
Okay, let's go. Go.

840
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:35,624
Let's go.
- Okay. Okay.

841
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:41,296
You folks plan on checkin' gout?

842
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,946
Hey.
We have to go now.

843
01:01:57,948 --> 01:01:59,514
Grab some stuff quick. We're
gonna leave with the Ryersons.

844
01:01:59,516 --> 01:02:01,083
The Ryersons?

845
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:03,485
Yeah. They're here
staying at the hotel.

846
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:05,954
They had another woman
with them...

847
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:07,189
but she's gone.

848
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:08,191
Gone where?

849
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,158
I don't think I wanna know.

850
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,827
Let's get your stuff
and get out of here.

851
01:02:23,807 --> 01:02:25,674
I'm really sorry
about this, folks.

852
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,777
Then why do it?

853
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,545
We know too much.

854
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:34,082
You think we're worried
about prosecution?

855
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:37,052
I can't speak for the sheriff
here, but I'd gladly go to jail.

856
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:38,754
So, what,

857
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:41,022
everyone in this town
has something on you?

858
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,827
Sheriff, for Christ's sakes,
what the hell is going on?!

859
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:48,663
Hell, there's a reason
I've been here for 20 years.

860
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:50,532
One day, many years ago,

861
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,000
I came home
and found my wife in bed.

862
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:54,202
And no, she wasn't alone.

863
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,173
And he was
my best fucking friend.

864
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,676
I took matters
into my own hands.

865
01:03:01,678 --> 01:03:02,744
They're both gone now.

866
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:07,749
I moved here, and became part
of the family, you could say.

867
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:10,752
The Ree family's
part of the original deal.

868
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:14,256
I changed my name
and I became and islander.

869
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:17,726
And my daughter and his son...
Are quite close.

870
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:22,464
Relax. The reverend's...

871
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:24,166
well, he's not overly cruel.

872
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,335
The reverend?

873
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,839
What the fuck are
you guys talking about?

874
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:33,375
What, some reverend's
going around killing people?

875
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,446
Do you mean the reverend?

876
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:40,982
From the legend?!

877
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:45,187
You know, it doesn't matter
how you see him...

878
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:46,888
he's always been here.

879
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,858
The Reverend'd kill them all
in one way or the other,

880
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,459
and we have to help him.

881
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:54,329
You see, the original families
on the island,

882
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,730
we're all cursed.

883
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,833
Over a century and a half ago

884
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:00,836
our families worked out
an agreement with the reverend.

885
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,738
An agreement that my family's
been paying for ever since.

886
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,774
An agreement that puts you
where you are now.

887
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:09,411
The reverend came
to my ancestor,

888
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:10,846
Peter Wiggenstein's house,

889
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:13,181
the very night he was
resurrected from the grave,

890
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:15,183
and told him we were to...

891
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,719
well, find him a new wife,

892
01:04:17,721 --> 01:04:19,955
to rebuild his family
when the time came.

893
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,325
I know it seems
hard to understand.

894
01:04:23,327 --> 01:04:26,394
Believe me, it's total insanity
if you aren't living it.

895
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:28,296
Our families had no choice.

896
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:30,832
The reverend
had become something...

897
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:33,401
inhuman and unreal.

898
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,977
So this freak...

899
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,846
and the rest of you

900
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:47,549
are responsible for April
and the professor's deaths?

901
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,718
Not so directly this time.

902
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,921
But you could say we all
took part in some way.

903
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:56,625
I just can't tell anymore.

904
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:01,630
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no.

905
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:03,064
Like this, like this.
You gotta do it like this.

906
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,933
- Stop shoving!
- Okay, then go left! Go left!

907
01:05:04,935 --> 01:05:06,468
Go left!
- This is where left is!

908
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,969
- Look at my hands!
- You said go left and that's what I'm doing!

909
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:09,371
Oh, I'm supposed to look at your hands?!
- Don't look at my hands!

910
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:10,705
Look at the road!
What are you doing?

911
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:12,674
First rule,
keep our eyes on the road!

912
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:16,978
Do you see them?

913
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,848
No.
They were supposed to be here.

914
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,286
All right, stay here and move
the car if anyone comes.

915
01:05:24,288 --> 01:05:25,654
I'm gonna sneak around back.

916
01:05:25,656 --> 01:05:27,122
Be fast.

917
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,513
Hey!

918
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:53,348
What?

919
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:54,816
They're gone...

920
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:56,184
or taken.

921
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,821
This means we have to
go to the woods.

922
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:01,323
Yeah.

923
01:06:01,325 --> 01:06:02,924
I think I know where.
Move over.

924
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,593
Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

925
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,629
- Okay.
- You're driving now?

926
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,965
Yeah, yeah.
"R" right?

927
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:12,300
- Are you kidding me?
- You back up with "r" right?

928
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,970
That's a thing. That's a thing.
I was asking to make sure.

929
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:16,304
Oh, my god.

930
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:56,845
Think about
what you're doing, Jacob.

931
01:06:56,847 --> 01:07:00,415
It was a long time ago.
What does it even matter?

932
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:03,018
They buried the reverend
on graves island,

933
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:06,221
where the Indians buried
their dead for centuries.

934
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:08,223
Nobody knows
why he came back to life.

935
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:15,130
Come on, guys, this way!
This way!

936
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:16,598
Oh, my god!

937
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,768
This way. This way.

938
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,506
What happened?

939
01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:26,007
What happened?
Where'd they go?

940
01:07:26,009 --> 01:07:28,643
- I don't know.
- Get up, you wussy-ass son of a bitch!

941
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:29,611
Where'd they go?!

942
01:07:29,613 --> 01:07:31,246
- Uh, I don't...
- Go!

943
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,252
Go, go, go, go!

944
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:39,954
Where are the keys?!
- They're in there!

945
01:07:42,626 --> 01:07:43,992
Hurry!

946
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:46,795
Go, go!
- Why isn't it going?!

947
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:47,896
Shit!

948
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:51,800
Shit! It's the reverend!

949
01:07:51,802 --> 01:07:53,201
Why isn't it going?!

950
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:55,904
Why isn't it going?!
- The fucking parking brake!

951
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:57,305
Shit!

952
01:07:57,307 --> 01:07:59,074
- Shit! Shit!
- - Go, go, go, go!

953
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:11,586
I'd never let anything like you
happen to my Brooke!

954
01:08:15,625 --> 01:08:18,860
Your death means nothing to me.

955
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:41,182
You can't even save
your own soul, heathen.

956
01:08:41,184 --> 01:08:44,419
You'll certainly not
save your daughter's!

957
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:51,926
Holy shit!

958
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:55,296
Okay, okay,
keep driving to the Marina.

959
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,868
He's gone. He's gone.

960
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,169
Oh, my god.

961
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:03,505
Won't they be looking for us?

962
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,708
I have a plan.

963
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,042
We can take my family's boat.

964
01:09:08,044 --> 01:09:10,345
All we have to do is get
to the dock before they do.

965
01:09:10,347 --> 01:09:11,779
The boat's moored there
and the keys are in it,

966
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:14,716
so if get down to the dock,
we're good.

967
01:09:14,718 --> 01:09:16,117
If we get stuck here...

968
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:18,920
we're dead.

969
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:20,955
Okay, okay.

970
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:22,190
And don't forget, you promised

971
01:09:22,192 --> 01:09:23,525
that once we get
to the mainland,

972
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:26,461
you would help us and not just
ditch when we get there, okay?

973
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:28,897
We would never dream
of leaving you guys, all right?

974
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:31,533
You can stay with us
as long as you want.

975
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:33,501
Sam, if you get us outta here,
man,

976
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:35,203
I'll build you
a guest-house myself!

977
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:36,738
Okay, okay.

978
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:46,881
Follow me, follow me.

979
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:48,416
Go, go, go, go, go!

980
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,058
Get in, get in, get in.

981
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:04,966
Come on!

982
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,474
Sam! Get back here!

983
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:16,044
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

984
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:17,245
Fuck you!
You almost killed my son!

985
01:10:17,247 --> 01:10:18,947
Fucking coward!

986
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,652
Oh, oh, oh!

987
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:26,054
Oh, my god!

988
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:28,456
You fucking idiot.

989
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:30,225
We're both dead now!

990
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:33,027
Yeah... we probably are.

991
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,731
You haven't got the courage.

992
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,603
Your mistake, Lucas.

993
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,206
No, no, no, no, no.

994
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,207
No, no, no, no.

995
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:48,509
You're okay.

996
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:50,445
You're okay. Please.

997
01:10:50,447 --> 01:10:52,513
Ned! Ned!

998
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,033
Ah.

999
01:11:45,035 --> 01:11:47,235
At last,

1000
01:11:47,237 --> 01:11:50,338
the circle, is broken.

1001
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,143
I've waited for so long.

1002
01:11:56,078 --> 01:12:00,815
The reckoning has finally come
for you all.

1003
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,650
I'm not Peter.

1004
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:06,054
He knew what to do with you.

1005
01:12:06,056 --> 01:12:09,023
I'd like you to thank your son
for me,

1006
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:13,294
but unfortunately,
that's not gonna be possible.

1007
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,718
Help me.

1008
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,659
Help!
