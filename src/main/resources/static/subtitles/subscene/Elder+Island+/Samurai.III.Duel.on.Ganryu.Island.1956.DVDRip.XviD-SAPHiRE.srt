Young Kojiro Sasaki is determined
to win a match...

18
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:19,001
with Musashi Miyamoto, his lifelong
rival in love and swordsmanship,

19
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,405
to become Japan's No. 1 fencer

20
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,519
"Clothes Rod" my poor sword

21
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:40,317
Your owner, such a fencer,
is still unrecognized

22
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:44,259
Despite his great skill

23
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,766
His dream remains
unattained!

24
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,539
Blind fools!

25
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,485
Poor swallow

26
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,091
Not just anyone can do that

27
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,834
"Swallow turn" swing.
I'll kill Musashi with it

28
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,135
Why must you fight him?

29
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,738
My long cherished dream

30
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:36,740
He has nothing against you.
Why must you kill him?

31
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,076
Tell me!

32
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,415
You're a devil!

33
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,594
Why get excited about him?

34
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,699
Please.
Forget him

35
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:59,066
I won't mention him from now on.
So please. -Conceited girl!

36
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,639
I'm not after him because of you

37
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:08,845
He's good. He's my only match
in this country today

38
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,986
My dream is to fight him.
He must dream it too

39
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,793
Akemi, stop!
-I won't

40
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,397
You scare me.
You horrify me

41
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,160
Looking for Musashi?

42
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:36,039
Go - then.
If you see him...

43
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:41,374
tell him not to trifle with
his life till we fight

44
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,232
Mu-sa-shi!

Come on!

49
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:03,294
You?
-No, pass

50
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,502
If no one sallies forth,
I'll leave

51
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:17,405
I'll call myself
today's winner!

52
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,169
Any objections?

53
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,411
Speak up!

54
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,810
You may come in a group

55
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,585
No one?

56
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:39,193
No contender?
Oh, well

57
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:46,763
Let's go

58
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:54,208
Hang it!
-Wait, kid!

59
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:02,347
I like your spirit.
You insulted me audaciously

60
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,956
You challenged

61
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,560
Fight with you?
-You can't?

62
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:15,934
Then why did you say that?

63
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,738
He's only a child.
Forgive him

64
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:24,101
Who are you?
-His companion

65
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:28,777
You urged him?
-No, my own idea

66
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,849
Then you'll fight with me

67
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,145
You may attack me together,
if you wish

68
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,253
Please.
-I won't forgive him

69
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,993
I apologize in his place.
-No!

70
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,500
I was insulted publicly

71
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:55,607
I won't swallow it

72
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,841
Fool

73
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,144
Prize fool Agon!

74
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:44,384
Agon, stop it.
-No!

75
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,420
Stop!

76
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,560
You're no match for him at all

77
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:57,431
He's peerless. Hasn't lost in
60 odd matches

78
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,734
Stop it!
-Musashi?

79
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,141
This is no fight

80
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:16,213
The winner of the tourney is
Priest Agon here!

81
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:28,057
I remembered your old self
in Priest Agon

82
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,902
I marvel at your perfection

83
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,565
Power alone won't make an
accomplished samurai

84
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:42,208
He must be strong. At the
same time he must be just

85
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,985
I want to be able to fight
without regrets

86
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:51,186
My past encounters were
full of them

87
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:56,050
Errantry has its points

88
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,595
Your suffering will polish you

89
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,290
I feel so pleased tonight

90
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,367
Have you ever fallen in love?

91
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:13,006
I know a person who's longing
for you

92
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,477
Want to meet this person?

93
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,211
So you've somebody in your heart

94
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:26,824
Don't worry.
I mean a man

95
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:31,225
A man longing...?
-Yes, for a man

96
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:37,461
Besides, he hasn't seen you
even once, mind you!

97
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,698
Who is he?
-Lord Yagyu

98
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:44,810
What? Lord Shogun's teacher?

99
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,936
Why don't you go to Edo and
see Yagyu?

100
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:08,064
You brought a letter from
Lord Karasumaru? I see

101
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:15,139
So your name's Otsu

102
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,901
Are you connected with
Musashi Miyamoto?

103
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:26,877
Yes, Your Grace.
I'm looking for him

104
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,816
Too late

105
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:35,355
He was here until this morning.
-Was he?

106
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:39,260
But he left for Edo

107
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,864
Stop.
Don't chase him

108
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:54,637
I must see him.
-I see, you care for him

109
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:17,198
The city of Edo had become
Japan's most crowded city

110
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:22,203
It was the Shogun's political and
military headquarters

111
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,036
His captains maintained villas here...

112
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:28,044
to serve him
and to recruit their forces.

113
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,944
Many ambitious samurai sought
employment...

114
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,917
coming to this large city
with high hopes.

115
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,965
I am Okaya.
-One moment

116
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,642
Why cover your spearhead?

117
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,870
Don't worry about hurting me,
please

118
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,276
Take it off

119
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,490
See his assurance, my Lord

120
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:24,734
Now that I use it uncovered,
use a sword yourself

121
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,772
No. This will do
-I won't fight like this

122
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:33,378
It's all right.
-Use your sword

123
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,073
I am only an unemployed samurai

124
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:42,448
Use of my sword will offend
His Lordship

125
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:49,059
Full of confidence, sir.
-Okaya, let him have his way

126
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:41,443
He overdid it

127
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,178
I was embarrassed

128
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,650
Was the audience successful?

129
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:55,416
Well... I fear not

130
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:59,792
Why? A man of your ability!
-It's true

131
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:06,302
My opponent was not very strong.
I should have been gentle

132
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,064
Did you win?
-I did

133
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:15,480
True, he will live.
As a cripple

134
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:21,310
Nobody will hire one who
cripples his vassal

135
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:29,217
I overdid it.
-I like it. You always mean business

136
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:36,594
I think I did nothing wrong.
But people disagree

137
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,641
Why are you doing that?

138
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,551
Still like me after I tore
your present?

139
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,349
I did the same thing today

140
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,685
I'll stay unemployed

141
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:15,796
I like it. I like
your straightforward character

142
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,535
Omitsu

143
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,040
Elope with me

144
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,985
I love you.
-Please!

145
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,919
Don't you want freedom?

146
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,925
Don't you love me?
If you do, follow me

147
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,730
I am leaving Edo

148
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,251
Where are you going?

149
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:13,629
These young men of today!
Impertinence!

150
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,996
Conceited!
-Please

151
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:22,039
You don't know how worried he is
about today's match

152
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:26,143
Did he tell you that?
-No, Father

153
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:30,807
Only...
I can sense it

154
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:41,123
Very painful, Okaya?
-lt is

155
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,319
I was lucky...

156
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,625
it was not...

157
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,233
a sword

158
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:57,373
I am very sorry, believe me.
-I was just no match for you

159
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:01,969
I may be sorry but
it was my fault

160
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,985
Did you get the job?

161
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,786
Take good care of yourself

162
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,999
I thought he was arrogant

163
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:34,874
But he's fine.
I never knew it

164
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:43,818
Kojiro visited Okaya?
-Okaya told me so, sir

165
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:49,724
What do you suggest? -lf he
really meant to console Okaya...

166
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,093
he must be somebody.
I am for employing him

167
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,826
Who is better, your Musashi or him?

168
00:18:56,001 --> 00:19:02,372
I hear Musashi is a matchless
swordsman. -I must see Musashi

169
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:09,139
Try and find him for me.
-And Kojiro?

170
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,042
I'll think it over

171
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:32,761
Hey, kid! Your master's been
carving images for days

172
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:37,204
Quit fencing? Is he a fencer?
-None of your business!

173
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,486
Keeper, is this an inn?

174
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:16,846
Master. When will you see
the Shogun's teacher?

175
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,885
I won't. -Really? Where's
the letter that monk gave you?

176
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,917
Threw it away.
-You shouldn't have!

177
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:31,293
Lord Yagyu might've recommended
you to the Shogun

178
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,196
You disgust me.
-Why?

179
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,596
If you succeed in life,
so will l

180
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:46,171
Jotaro, is that why
you've followed me?

181
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,211
But why stay here then?

182
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,320
Waiting for her?
-Who?

183
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:00,254
Otsu.
-Fool!

184
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:04,452
I know you want to see her.
I'm positive

185
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:10,524
Sure. Look.
This is her face

186
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,729
Please. Mercy

187
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,695
Why?
-No

188
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,604
Don't

189
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,670
You mustn't

190
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,508
Yes, I want to see her.
But she'll refuse to see me

191
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:30,876
Why?

192
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,246
I did something shameful to her

193
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:54,467
It's four to one.
-And he's winning

194
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:25,331
What skill!
Where is he?

195
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,304
He left a note

196
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:37,575
"The four are students of
Obana Strategic School

197
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:43,052
He who is responsible for it is
Kojiro Sasaki of lsarago."

198
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,650
I appreciate...

199
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,021
your kind deed

200
00:23:55,467 --> 00:24:01,838
However, Miyamoto,
the bodies you brought...

201
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,909
have nothing to do
with my school

202
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:11,845
But I hear that they drew
when he slandered you

203
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:17,785
Please. None of my students
are as weak as that

204
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,119
You call me a meddler, then?

205
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:28,492
Miyamoto, I teach the Shogun.
Mine is an honorable family

206
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:34,799
My 100 students are
accomplished men

207
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:43,138
I see. Forgive my rudeness for
bringing the corpses

208
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,047
Let me pass

209
00:24:55,293 --> 00:25:00,526
Professor Obana told me they
could not be his men

210
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:04,465
Don't be offended.
Please give them up to us

211
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:08,664
I will not.
The dead men won't like it

212
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:14,945
Fortunately I know several sutras.
I'll bury them

213
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,639
I learned a lesson today

214
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:36,323
"Here lie four unknown samurai"

215
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,262
So it is you

216
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,964
I thought it was one of them

217
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,563
Thank you for your help
last year

218
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:57,080
You fought marvelously.
I saw it

219
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:01,709
I learned of your ability today
for the first time

220
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:11,891
Those four. One stroke each!
-Try it?

221
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,434
Kid. Go away awhile

222
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,600
Be calm no matter what you see

223
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:37,978
I've always wanted to meet you

224
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,592
Stop.
-Scared?

225
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,492
No.
Postpone it

226
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:52,397
Elsewhere.
If we fight here...

227
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,698
they may say I fought for Obana

228
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,476
Which is not true

229
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:04,747
Let us fix it properly
and fight freely

230
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:13,383
You are right.
Tomorrow evening...

231
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:17,962
I'll be at the East Gate.
Right? -Very good

232
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:15,147
You have been evading me.
Scared of me? -No

233
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:20,052
However, I won't elope with you

234
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,723
You think I am joking?

235
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,689
You meant it

236
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:35,573
You are a darling.
I meant it

237
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,971
But I've changed my mind.
-Why?

238
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,873
Tomorrow night you'll know

239
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:46,916
I'll do or die!
You won't be seeing me, anyway

240
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:00,956
If I win I'll seek a much
larger fortune

241
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:07,528
If I lose...
I'll be dead

242
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:17,006
In either case, you'll always
remember me as your lover

243
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,052
His Lordship

244
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:49,439
What was it?
-Well, he was delighted

245
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,777
He wants to hire Kojiro
as his teacher

246
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:58,952
Kojiro did something big.
Where is he?

247
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,954
I'll bring him here

248
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,391
Did you come back?
-I bring good news!

249
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,509
My Master heard about you
and Obana's students

250
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:31,019
Please. They were just weaklings.
It did me no credit

251
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:36,457
However, their master is
Lord Shogun's teacher

252
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:41,629
Vengeance will be sought.
-I'll fight

253
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:46,736
Listen to me.
You are too full of youthful vigor

254
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:52,968
My Master said "Such animosity
must be stopped"

255
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:57,673
He suddenly decided to employ
you as a retainer

256
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,984
Well? If you become Lord
Hosokawa's teacher...

257
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:07,147
they dare not attack you.
-I decline

258
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:12,520
I dislike seeking protection.
-Don't be silly

259
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:19,869
If they challenge,
fight as Lord Hosokawa's teacher

260
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,838
It's not like you.
Another thing

261
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:27,411
Chief Retainer Sado is recommending
Musashi

262
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:33,308
Musashi?
-He is being sought quietly

263
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:37,582
We must decide this
before they find him

264
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:41,851
Taking an initiative is always
advantageous

265
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:46,656
Listen.
I duel with Musashi tomorrow

266
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:51,132
What! With him?
-So your worry is over

267
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,973
His dream is too vast

268
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,533
What noise!

269
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,066
Hey, quiet you!

270
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:35,840
Thanks

271
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:51,787
They became quiet.
You are persuasive. -Sure!

272
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,504
Excuse me

273
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:14,782
Samurai! Stop eating

274
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:21,714
Confess you're scared.
Don't pretend you're calm at heart

275
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:25,761
Stop!

276
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,932
Who are you?
-Don't know me?

277
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:37,270
Those who don't know me here,
must be deaf

278
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:42,545
Speak loudly, as I am
hard of hearing

279
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,213
Who?
-Shut up!

280
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:51,113
I'm Kumagoro the horse-dealer,
a tough guy

281
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:55,919
And when I say tough I mean tough.
-Horse-dealer, eh?

282
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:01,191
I deal with samurai.
I handle live horses, mind you

283
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:05,802
So what?
-You sent this kid to me...

284
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:10,101
to tell me to be quiet,
didn't you?

285
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:16,339
I have a big voice.
You don't own this inn, do you?

286
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,782
So, what?
-Apologize

287
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:25,054
Write a letter of apology
addressed to us all

288
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:29,751
Or I'll take you out into
the yard and punish you

289
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,831
Amusing.
Very interesting

290
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:39,426
Fresh! You heard me.
Now answer me!

291
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:43,062
Answer me at once, or else...!

292
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,677
Which would be better?

293
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:32,552
Too many.
Wash these sticks

294
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,668
He's terrific!

295
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,780
Training for revenge?

296
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:12,623
I'm his pupil now.
Musashi Miyamoto! No wonder!

297
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,391
Are you out of your head?
-Of course not!

298
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:24,464
Horse-dealer.
Did you say Musashi?

299
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,513
Does he live here?

300
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,721
Now I fully understand you

301
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,158
I will not force my ideas on you

302
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:49,223
However, will you be good enough
to see my Master?

303
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:56,199
But, I am to fight a duel tonight.
-A duel?

304
00:37:56,474 --> 00:38:01,309
It will be the memorable match
of my life. -Who's your man?

305
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,876
Kojiro Sasaki.
-Sasaki?

306
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,507
You mean it?

307
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:16,450
I hear he may be employed
by my Master

308
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,459
What? Is Kojiro...

309
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:23,663
Miyamoto, if you win...

310
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:28,631
...please certainly accept my offer

311
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,281
Must you fight?

312
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:24,761
Hey, kid!
Where is Musashi?

313
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:41,210
"l have decided to leave
on a journey

314
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:46,472
Let me please postpone the
promised match for a year

315
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:51,886
When we meet again, I will be
quite ready...

316
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:56,755
to vie with you.
Yours truly"

317
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:26,149
Why do you cry?
-I don't like it

318
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,889
That Kojiro as Hosokawa's teacher!

319
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,525
I dreamt of worldly success once

320
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:39,331
I thought it was natural
to settle down

321
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,670
But now I want to train
myself further

322
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:22,109
Jotaro, I'm hungry.
Let's eat, shall we?

323
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:27,878
Kuma.
I'm your senior, am I not?

324
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,115
Call me Master Jotaro

325
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:38,391
I say... Master Jotaro.
-What is it?

326
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:42,330
A man should be kind to his juniors

327
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,233
Let's eat, shall we?
Shall we?

328
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:23,301
Drop the reins.
Or we'll shoot

329
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,840
Surrender your swords

330
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,558
Step back

331
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:22,556
How did you reach here safely?
-We met brigands

332
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,966
Nothing happened?
-We won a horse

333
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:35,502
They appear often?
-More than often, sir. They ruin us

334
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,241
They steal our crops,
they steal our women

335
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,147
We're at their tender mercy

336
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,983
Many have left this village
for safety

337
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:51,788
Imagine. They won a horse!
Isn't it something?

338
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:58,800
Have you an axe to cut down trees?

339
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:21,283
Master.
Why fell trees?

340
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:24,722
Build a hut.
-What for, Master?

341
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:30,030
We'll live here.
And plough

342
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:37,936
What about fencing practice?
-We'll continue as we plough

343
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,541
Brace up!

344
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,979
Hurry up will you, girls?
They'll be angry

345
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:26,385
Hurry! They seem like rich people.
We'll get rich!

346
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:31,422
Rich - nothing!
The keeper'll become rich

347
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:35,429
We'll become thinner.
-The greedy pimp!

348
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,660
Hurry up!

349
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:44,998
You're free, Hanagiri?
-Let me breathe

350
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:51,011
We're short of one girl for
five customers. Hanagiri!

351
00:45:55,219 --> 00:46:00,156
Keeper.
Do all your girls wear bells?

352
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:05,990
No, sir, she's the only one.
Tinkles around like a kitten

353
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:11,430
Hanagiri, you say?
Bring her. At once

354
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:19,341
You have a quick ear.
-Reminded of someone?

355
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:23,002
You win!
We'll stick to drinks then

356
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:41,492
So it's you

357
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:57,775
You laugh at me.
Don't you?

358
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:04,650
I'm not that heartless.
-I know you. Worse than that

359
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:09,052
I didn't even touch you.
-lt was your vanity

360
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,856
Had I not loved him,
you'd have...

361
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:19,533
Probably.
Come here and pour us drinks

362
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,005
She cares for Musashi

363
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:31,877
Unrequited love.
See her now!

364
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:33,875
Stop!

365
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:42,454
I may be soiled
but my heart is pure

366
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:48,693
Is it?
I'll tell you where he is now

367
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:56,402
He ploughs at Hoten Field
in Shimosa

368
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,168
Care to go?
-No joking, sir

369
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,110
If she goes, I'll suffer a big loss.
-Keeper

370
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,616
Enough?

371
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,106
Just a farmer

372
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:52,053
A woman?
-What?

373
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:07,807
What a find!

374
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:13,671
Stop!
I saw her first. Didn't l?

375
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:31,291
A girl.
-Brigands again!

376
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,858
Why - Otsu!

377
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,835
Why - Jotaro!

378
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,205
More loot

379
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:23,278
Master!
-What, we eat now?

380
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:28,086
Big news! Otsu came!
-Otsu?

381
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:33,527
Lord Yagyu of Edo told her, she
says. How did he know about us?

382
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,330
Bring me something to wear

383
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:42,032
She's washing her face now
to make herself presentable

384
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,695
Will you hurry?

385
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,396
I missed you

386
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:46,061
I thought you were mad at me.
-But why?

387
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,600
I was to blame

388
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:00,616
It was sudden.
So...

389
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,650
You forgive me?

390
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:09,548
I won't leave you again!

391
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:17,331
That's the hut we built

392
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,926
We three live in it

393
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:26,439
And we have tilled those
patches of land

394
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:33,447
It was barren. But it is yielding
crops lately thanks to our labor

395
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:40,015
In the old days
I hated farm work

396
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:44,016
And was daydreaming always

397
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:49,996
Wanting to become famous
and successful

398
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,399
Vainly and at random

399
00:52:54,671 --> 00:53:00,701
Now I'm tilling again.
Isn't it strange?

400
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:05,641
I'm beginning to learn
the value of life

401
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,279
The soil has taught me that

402
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,428
Jotaro

403
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:31,297
Cook something for Otsu.
I'll ask old Gen to house her

404
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,276
Are you very happy
to see him again?

405
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:46,114
He's still angry about me.
-What happened?

406
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,360
Listen, Jotaro.
-Master Jotaro

407
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:05,133
Y es, sir.
I don't understand him at all

408
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:09,642
Me, neither.
He's carving again

409
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:44,169
He told me he'd done
something bad to her

410
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:51,543
Can't be true! If so,
why would she come here? -Y es

411
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:56,347
Who goes there?

412
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:21,729
I hate to leave this village.
I'll stick to it...

413
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:25,102
even if I may be killed
on that account

414
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:28,369
Please, sir, teach us how to fight

415
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:31,844
We must fight the brigands
away from here!

416
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,575
Please, Master!

417
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,183
It's no use teaching you
how to fight

418
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:45,221
If you must learn to run

419
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:49,921
Away from them, sir?
-And laugh last

420
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:57,896
You're going there by yourself?
-Yes. I have come alone so far

421
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:00,304
It's dangerous from here

422
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:05,437
The way to the next village
is infested with bandits

423
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,948
I've known bandits
since I was a baby

424
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:13,053
My father was a brigand, too

425
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:18,983
Isn't my lunch ready yet?
-lt is

426
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:23,355
Better disguise yourself as a man

427
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,060
They'll stop any girl

428
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:33,808
Men have made a plaything of me.
I don't mind anything now

429
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:40,439
If I can see him,
I'll die content

430
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:52,357
One moment. Men come here regularly
to buy oil and salt

431
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:57,899
Wait till then and go with them.
-A good idea

432
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,695
That may be them

433
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,268
Give us drinks!

434
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:22,183
It's bad since those samurai came

435
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:27,455
I hear they're teaching them
fencing. -Who are they?

436
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,626
We've got to destroy them, anyway

437
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:37,372
This is too small.
Bring bigger bowls!

438
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:46,443
Keeper, that your daughter?

439
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:50,518
Hey, girlie!
Come here!

440
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,857
Why - you're Akemi!

441
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:11,639
You're Toji!
-Yes, I am

442
01:00:11,808 --> 01:00:15,266
Know her?
-She's Oko's daughter.

443
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,913
What happened to my mother?

444
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,714
Where is she?
-I killed her

445
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:33,518
You were there when
she was killed!

446
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:38,429
You surrendered to save your skin!
-Shut up!

447
01:00:38,601 --> 01:00:42,628
I avenged my brother's death.
-Avenged?

448
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:46,673
Your mother had killed him.
I'm Kohei

449
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:52,213
But you two had killed my father!
-You'll be with him

450
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,095
That's the village

451
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:24,741
Tell them the brigands were all
arrested by the officials

452
01:01:24,914 --> 01:01:26,245
Understand?

453
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:31,375
And set Musashi's hut on fire
tomorrow evening

454
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:35,388
We'll attack then.
Right?

455
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:41,259
I can't. Never! No!
-Don't be a fool!

456
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:47,362
Musashi is his enemy.
Also mine

457
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:52,098
He spared you.
You must do it

458
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:59,675
If you won't...
I'll have to kill you

459
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,235
Don't. You're still sick

460
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:31,439
But I can't stay idle here.
-Stop!

461
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:41,421
Tell me.
Tell me what to do now

462
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:46,489
Must I leave?
-Well, no

463
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:52,023
Tell me then.
Why do you evade me?

464
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:56,165
You dislike me?
Hate me?

465
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:01,202
Have I been erased from your heart?

466
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:03,542
Please!

467
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:11,878
You're heartless! Stony-hearted!
I hate such a man! -But...

468
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:14,888
I can't live!

469
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:23,827
I wish I were dead!
-Don't be stupid

470
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:29,895
I am stupid!
Watch what a stupid girl does!

471
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:44,709
What are you doing?

472
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:02,727
So. She's here

473
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:26,319
This is because of her.
That dame!

474
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:33,391
I'm sorry. -Old Gen
can accommodate another person

475
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:39,803
Otsu won't like it.
Neither will Akemi

476
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:44,240
I think I'll go ask Aunt Oseki

477
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,213
I'll do that for you.
-Me, too

478
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:22,948
At last we're alone

479
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:30,386
Why don't you like it?

480
01:05:31,694 --> 01:05:34,162
You have changed, Akemi

481
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:38,458
But I like your tone.
I'm so glad

482
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:43,669
Darling! I have loved you since
we lived in the hills

483
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:47,740
I really cared for you.
-You don't mean that

484
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:54,441
But I mean it. I tried to tell you
when you were trapped last time

485
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:58,385
I didn't understand you

486
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:02,715
Darling... elope with me

487
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:05,258
Won't you?
-Stop it

488
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:13,129
Oko, your mother, asked me to do
that once

489
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:16,971
Her blood is in your veins

490
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:23,578
No. I'm different.
I'm not like her at all

491
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:30,382
I never loved men
till I met you

492
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:36,655
I've never loved anybody
but you, darling

493
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,691
That's why I came here

494
01:06:58,214 --> 01:06:59,977
I'm sorry

495
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,811
It's not your fault

496
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:15,987
You have Otsu.
I shouldn't be unreasonable

497
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,042
I will leave in the morning

498
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:35,673
Be happy with her.
Good luck

499
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:58,330
Darling.
It's hard!

500
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:05,302
But I give you up!
I promise

501
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:09,542
So hold me tightly before I go!

502
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:16,790
Choke me to death!
In your arms!

503
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:22,193
As your last favor!

504
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:56,026
Men!
I heard on my way here...

505
01:08:56,165 --> 01:09:00,033
that all the brigands
were arrested. -Really?

506
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:14,975
The whole town's talking.
-lf they're arrested, we are safe

507
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:27,888
Akemi said that?
-Serves 'em right. -Now we're saved

508
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:37,795
Akemi, are you sure about
the brigands?

509
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:45,010
Akemi! Is it true?

510
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,582
You wouldn't believe me

511
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:57,118
I'll stay here awhile.
I like it here

512
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:04,493
Master, did you hear it?
Very good news, eh?

513
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:18,245
Did you hear? -Yes, I did.
-Let's stop work and celebrate!

514
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:29,945
She'll signal to us with a fire.
Set houses afire!

515
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,247
You kill the villagers

516
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:38,984
Don't take on Musashi.
I'll handle him

517
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:54,932
Come with me.
We'll talk alone

518
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:14,260
Where's Otsu?

519
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:18,767
She's at my home.
-She'll play the flute

520
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:21,297
I'll fetch her

521
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:33,470
Otsu.
You know how a girl feels

522
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:38,449
I'm in love with him.
-Akemi

523
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:43,453
You are a terrible girl

524
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:48,724
Why must you come between us two?

525
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,871
Take it up

526
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:06,874
If you want him...
fight!

527
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:13,154
How horrible!
-Take it up

528
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,113
Help! Somebody!

529
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:55,262
Fire! Fire!

530
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,098
Brigands! Brigands!

531
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:47,311
Calm down! Quiet!
Take women and kids to Old Gen's.

532
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:28,155
Musashi! Come out!
Fight with me!

533
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:39,498
Musashi, I'm here to avenge
my brother's death!

534
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:11,560
Brace up, Kuma!

535
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:18,499
Jotaro... you're... truly my senior

536
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,713
Akemi!

537
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:35,985
Well done!

538
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,630
What are you doing?

539
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:18,299
Akemi! Brace up!

540
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:25,936
Otsu. I'm dying now

541
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:33,375
I've been so wicked.
-Oh, no!

542
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:39,919
You saved my life!
Don't die! Akemi!

543
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,464
Darling!

544
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:57,371
At last...

545
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,105
you hold me...

546
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:06,845
in your arms.
-Brace up, Akemi!

547
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:11,982
It's all over with me

548
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:20,591
I can't even...
see you

549
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:36,477
Be happy together, you two

550
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:36,200
Musashi!
Where is Master Musashi?

551
01:19:56,024 --> 01:20:02,054
"l have been officially employed
as Lord Hosokawa's teacher...

552
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,393
and will leave for Kokura,
his Castle Town

553
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:13,163
I am desirous to have the match
at Kokura, April next."

554
01:20:56,351 --> 01:21:01,414
My Master's so unreasonable
to leave you like this

555
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:08,326
After all,
he prefers fencing to me

556
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:31,308
Kokura Town, Lord Hosokawa's
country seat

557
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:42,059
"Our Lord's Retainer Kojiro Sasaki
will fight by command...

558
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:46,793
with Musashi Miyamoto of
Mimasaku Province."

559
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:50,638
Musashi.
In five days, eh?

560
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:57,471
Fight fair and square,
like a real samurai

561
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:06,115
He is a peerless match, sir.
I will not spoil your honorable name

562
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:10,551
In four days

563
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:16,554
He's busy.
But I am his childhood friend

564
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:18,723
An intimate friend

565
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:21,859
I was with him at the fencing school

566
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:25,439
He'll remember my name without fail

567
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:39,783
They ignored me while I was jobless

568
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:46,056
But today even strangers
want to see me

569
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:54,927
Such is life.
-But it's something for rejoicing

570
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:59,798
Your prowess will be acknowledged,
definitely

571
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:06,279
After the match,
another big event

572
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:11,780
My daughter is impatient

573
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:25,555
Please, Otsu!
Let me find my Master

574
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:30,068
Please.
Why have I come all this way?

575
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:36,604
In this match
he might meet the worst

576
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:42,307
If so, I'll gather his remains

577
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:49,556
So I must see him.
I must speak to him!

578
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:38,634
From Musashi, sir?

579
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:45,775
"l will arrive in my own boat
in time

580
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:48,415
I hope this is satisfactory"

581
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:56,079
I see.
He didn't come here out of respect

582
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:59,855
He'll go directly to the isle

583
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,728
But where is he?

584
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:11,867
Brace up, Otsu

585
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:23,147
What happened?
-She's sick

586
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:54,646
Omitsu

587
01:25:57,418 --> 01:25:58,908
You look pensive

588
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:04,683
Think I'll lose?
-Oh, no

589
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:09,525
You may not expect it
but you're afraid

590
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:19,133
I'll win.
To defeat him has been my ambition

591
01:26:24,045 --> 01:26:27,412
I'll defeat him with my own ability

592
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:35,350
Prayers of those who wish me victory
and talismans...

593
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,617
are useless to me

594
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,691
Therefore don't pray for me, dear

595
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:52,462
Sympathy harms my
mental tranquility

596
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:55,874
I want to fight alone

597
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:18,623
Return to the castle

598
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,744
Now I feel relieved

599
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,769
Hey, Sasuke. Is it ready?
-Sure

600
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:08,542
It's an honor for a boatman
to row for Master Musashi

601
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:11,378
The boat's been purified

602
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:24,363
Thank you for the kind gift
I wear now

603
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:29,797
I feel so refreshed.
-Good luck, sir

604
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:38,340
One moment. I want you to see
someone before you leave. -Me?

605
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:42,746
Don't bother to get up

606
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:52,783
Otsu!

607
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:58,997
I can't see him like this

608
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,406
Master!

609
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:28,155
Don't come in!
I'm coming!

610
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:07,431
Otsu.
-At last we meet again

611
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:15,738
You look weak. Very ill?
-I'm cured now

612
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:20,839
My illness is so whimsical, you know

613
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:28,980
Let's take a walk, shall we, Otsu?

614
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:36,357
This is the first time
you ever asked me

615
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:41,860
Let's. Of course

616
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:12,763
Until today
I've walked my own way...

617
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:16,502
and made you suffer a lot

618
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:23,875
Forgive me. But I'm not
as heartless as I may seem

619
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:28,510
I know.
-You do?

620
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:32,414
That's why I've loved you

621
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:38,120
Darling!

622
01:31:43,431 --> 01:31:45,763
What a lucky day it is today!

623
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,664
I can fight with clear conscience now

624
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:54,207
Why do you cry?

625
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:57,473
I hate it

626
01:31:58,312 --> 01:32:03,773
I wish you weren't a samurai!

627
01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:19,694
Darling, abandon your sword.
Don't fight!

628
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:26,864
Let them call you a coward!
I crave for happiness, just us two!

629
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:30,738
That's impossible now, Otsu

630
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:39,049
Please! I won't let you go!
Oh no!

631
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,988
Don't be unreasonable

632
01:32:43,524 --> 01:32:45,685
I'm a woman

633
01:32:46,627 --> 01:32:51,257
I wish you had been an ordinary man

634
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:56,003
Otsu, don't demoralize me, please

635
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:00,731
A samurai's wife sends off
her man with a smile

636
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:07,740
Especially when it might be
for good

637
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:23,116
Is that the lsland?
-No, sir, that's not it

638
01:35:23,284 --> 01:35:27,050
Our island lies beyond that.
A smaller one

639
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:31,583
Is this where a sea-battle was
fought in olden times?

640
01:35:36,697 --> 01:35:38,756
What is that for, sir?

641
01:35:40,468 --> 01:35:42,095
For the duel

642
01:35:44,305 --> 01:35:48,036
Fight with a wooden one?
-I like the size

643
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:56,073
Listen.
If I lose and fall...

644
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:59,185
take my dead body back...

645
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:04,146
to Otsu
-Dear God!

646
01:36:04,325 --> 01:36:08,125
Don't talk rot!
-Take this as my memento

647
01:36:19,273 --> 01:36:21,764
Musashi's boat is sighted!

648
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:32,578
Musashi is coming!
-Musashi has come!

649
01:36:41,395 --> 01:36:43,886
Don't be nervous

650
01:36:44,999 --> 01:36:48,491
You'll see the mysterious
power of my sword

651
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:52,162
Watch me

652
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:19,350
Musashi!

653
01:42:33,647 --> 01:42:38,107
Mr. Miyamoto.
That was splendid

654
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:46,281
He was the best fencer
I will ever encounter

655
01:43:32,573 --> 01:43:36,168
I'm so glad.
I'm so glad!

656
01:43:37,578 --> 01:43:43,141
I was praying
so I wouldn't bring you back dead

657
01:43:44,184 --> 01:43:49,019
I'm so glad about it all.
I'm so happy!

658
01:44:20,153 --> 01:44:29,789
THE END
