to win a match...

18
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:19,292
with Musashi Miyamoto, his lifelong
rival in love and swordsmanship,

19
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:23,695
to become Japan's No. 1 fencer

20
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,810
"Clothes Rod" my poor sword

21
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:40,608
Your owner, such a fencer,
is still unrecognized

22
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:44,550
Despite his great skill

23
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:51,057
His dream remains
unattained!

24
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:55,829
Blind fools!

25
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,776
Poor swallow

26
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,382
Not just anyone can do that

27
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:24,124
"Swallow turn" swing.
I'll kill Musashi with it

28
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:27,426
Why must you fight him?

29
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:30,029
My long cherished dream

30
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:37,030
He has nothing against you.
Why must you kill him?

31
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:38,367
Tell me!

32
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:45,705
You're a devil!

33
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:50,884
Why get excited about him?

34
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,989
Please.
Forget him

35
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:59,357
I won't mention him from now on.
So please. -Conceited girl!

36
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:02,930
I'm not after him because of you

37
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:09,135
He's good. He's my only match
in this country today

38
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,276
My dream is to fight him.
He must dream it too

39
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:23,084
Akemi, stop!
-I won't

40
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,688
You scare me.
You horrify me

41
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:29,451
Looking for Musashi?

42
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:36,330
Go - then.
If you see him...

43
00:04:36,466 --> 00:04:41,665
tell him not to trifle with
his life till we fight

44
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:00,522
Mu-sa-shi!

Come on!

49
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:03,584
You?
-No, pass

50
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:12,792
If no one sallies forth,
I'll leave

51
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:17,695
I'll call myself
today's winner!

52
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:19,459
Any objections?

53
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,701
Speak up!

54
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,100
You may come in a group

55
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:29,876
No one?

56
00:06:36,252 --> 00:06:39,483
No contender?
Oh, well

57
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:47,054
Let's go

58
00:06:49,265 --> 00:06:54,498
Hang it!
-Wait, kid!

59
00:06:57,507 --> 00:07:02,638
I like your spirit.
You insulted me audaciously

60
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:05,247
You challenged

61
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:08,850
Fight with you?
-You can't?

62
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:16,225
Then why did you say that?

63
00:07:17,126 --> 00:07:21,028
He's only a child.
Forgive him

64
00:07:21,264 --> 00:07:24,392
Who are you?
-His companion

65
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:29,067
You urged him?
-No, my own idea

66
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:32,139
Then you'll fight with me

67
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:34,436
You may attack me together,
if you wish

68
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:39,543
Please.
-I won't forgive him

69
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:49,284
I apologize in his place.
-No!

70
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:51,791
I was insulted publicly

71
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:55,897
I won't swallow it

72
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,131
Fool

73
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:39,434
Prize fool Agon!

74
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:44,675
Agon, stop it.
-No!

75
00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:47,711
Stop!

76
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:52,851
You're no match for him at all

77
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:57,721
He's peerless. Hasn't lost in
60 odd matches

78
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,024
Stop it!
-Musashi?

79
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,431
This is no fight

80
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:16,504
The winner of the tourney is
Priest Agon here!

81
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:28,347
I remembered your old self
in Priest Agon

82
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:32,193
I marvel at your perfection

83
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:35,855
Power alone won't make an
accomplished samurai

84
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:42,498
He must be strong. At the
same time he must be just

85
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,276
I want to be able to fight
without regrets

86
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:51,477
My past encounters were
full of them

87
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:56,340
Errantry has its points

88
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:59,885
Your suffering will polish you

89
00:10:00,056 --> 00:10:02,581
I feel so pleased tonight

90
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,657
Have you ever fallen in love?

91
00:10:09,065 --> 00:10:13,297
I know a person who's longing
for you

92
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:15,768
Want to meet this person?

93
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:21,501
So you've somebody in your heart

94
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:27,115
Don't worry.
I mean a man

95
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:31,515
A man longing...?
-Yes, for a man

96
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:37,751
Besides, he hasn't seen you
even once, mind you!

97
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:41,988
Who is he?
-Lord Yagyu

98
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:45,100
What? Lord Shogun's teacher?

99
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:49,227
Why don't you go to Edo and
see Yagyu?

100
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:08,355
You brought a letter from
Lord Karasumaru? I see

101
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:15,429
So your name's Otsu

102
00:11:17,733 --> 00:11:21,191
Are you connected with
Musashi Miyamoto?

103
00:11:22,104 --> 00:11:27,167
Yes, Your Grace.
I'm looking for him

104
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:29,106
Too late

105
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:35,646
He was here until this morning.
-Was he?

106
00:11:35,785 --> 00:11:39,551
But he left for Edo

107
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:49,155
Stop.
Don't chase him

108
00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:54,927
I must see him.
-I see, you care for him

109
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:17,489
The city of Edo had become
Japan's most crowded city

110
00:12:19,228 --> 00:12:22,493
It was the Shogun's political and
military headquarters

111
00:12:22,665 --> 00:12:25,327
His captains maintained villas here...

112
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:28,335
to serve him
and to recruit their forces.

113
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:31,234
Many ambitious samurai sought
employment...

114
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:35,207
coming to this large city
with high hopes.

115
00:12:50,626 --> 00:12:54,255
I am Okaya.
-One moment

116
00:12:56,032 --> 00:12:58,933
Why cover your spearhead?

117
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:03,161
Don't worry about hurting me,
please

118
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,567
Take it off

119
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:13,780
See his assurance, my Lord

120
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:25,025
Now that I use it uncovered,
use a sword yourself

121
00:13:25,161 --> 00:13:29,063
No. This will do
-I won't fight like this

122
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:33,668
It's all right.
-Use your sword

123
00:13:34,804 --> 00:13:37,364
I am only an unemployed samurai

124
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,739
Use of my sword will offend
His Lordship

125
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:49,350
Full of confidence, sir.
-Okaya, let him have his way

126
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:41,734
He overdid it

127
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:45,468
I was embarrassed

128
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,940
Was the audience successful?

129
00:14:51,247 --> 00:14:55,707
Well... I fear not

130
00:14:55,885 --> 00:15:00,083
Why? A man of your ability!
-It's true

131
00:15:00,723 --> 00:15:06,593
My opponent was not very strong.
I should have been gentle

132
00:15:07,363 --> 00:15:10,355
Did you win?
-I did

133
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:15,770
True, he will live.
As a cripple

134
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:21,601
Nobody will hire one who
cripples his vassal

135
00:15:24,046 --> 00:15:29,507
I overdid it.
-I like it. You always mean business

136
00:15:31,787 --> 00:15:36,884
I think I did nothing wrong.
But people disagree

137
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:44,932
Why are you doing that?

138
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:55,841
Still like me after I tore
your present?

139
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:58,640
I did the same thing today

140
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:03,975
I'll stay unemployed

141
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:16,087
I like it. I like
your straightforward character

142
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,825
Omitsu

143
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,331
Elope with me

144
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:30,275
I love you.
-Please!

145
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:33,210
Don't you want freedom?

146
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:38,216
Don't you love me?
lf you do, follow me

147
00:16:38,654 --> 00:16:41,020
I am leaving Edo

148
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,542
Where are you going?

149
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:13,919
These young men of today!
lmpertinence!

150
00:17:14,056 --> 00:17:16,286
Conceited!
-Please

151
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:22,330
You don't know how worried he is
about today's match

152
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:26,434
Did he tell you that?
-No, Father

153
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:31,097
Only...
I can sense it

154
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:41,413
Very painful, Okaya?
-It is

155
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:45,610
I was lucky...

156
00:17:45,754 --> 00:17:47,915
it was not...

157
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,523
a sword

158
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:57,663
I am very sorry, believe me.
-I was just no match for you

159
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,260
I may be sorry but
it was my fault

160
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:07,275
Did you get the job?

161
00:18:08,244 --> 00:18:11,077
Take good care of yourself

162
00:18:26,695 --> 00:18:29,289
I thought he was arrogant

163
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:35,164
But he's fine.
I never knew it

164
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:44,108
Kojiro visited Okaya?
-Okaya told me so, sir

165
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:50,014
What do you suggest? -If he
really meant to console Okaya...

166
00:18:50,152 --> 00:18:53,383
he must be somebody.
I am for employing him

167
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:56,116
Who is better, your Musashi or him?

168
00:18:56,292 --> 00:19:02,663
I hear Musashi is a matchless
swordsman. -I must see Musashi

169
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:09,429
Try and find him for me.
-And Kojiro?

170
00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:12,333
I'll think it over

171
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:33,052
Hey, kid! Your master's been
carving images for days

172
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:37,494
Quit fencing? Is he a fencer?
-None of your business!

173
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:48,777
Keeper, is this an inn?

174
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:17,137
Master. When will you see
the Shogun's teacher?

175
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,176
I won't. -Really? Where's
the letter that monk gave you?

176
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,208
Threw it away.
-You shouldn't have!

177
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,584
Lord Yagyu might've recommended
you to the Shogun

178
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:35,486
You disgust me.
-Why?

179
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,887
If you succeed in life,
so will I

180
00:20:40,796 --> 00:20:46,462
Jotaro, is that why
you've followed me?

181
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:53,502
But why stay here then?

182
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,611
Waiting for her?
-Who?

183
00:20:57,746 --> 00:21:00,544
Otsu.
-Fool!

184
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:04,743
I know you want to see her.
I'm positive

185
00:21:05,854 --> 00:21:10,814
Sure. Look.
This is her face

186
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:42,019
Please. Mercy

187
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:45,986
Why?
-No

188
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:48,895
Don't

189
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:52,961
You mustn't

190
00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:28,798
Yes, I want to see her.
But she'll refuse to see me

191
00:22:29,938 --> 00:22:31,166
Why?

192
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,537
I did something shameful to her

193
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:54,757
It's four to one.
-And he's winning

194
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:25,621
What skill!
Where is he?

195
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:29,594
He left a note

196
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:37,865
"The four are students of
Obana Strategic School

197
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:43,342
He who is responsible for it is
Kojiro Sasaki of Isarago."

198
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,941
I appreciate...

199
00:23:52,321 --> 00:23:54,312
your kind deed

200
00:23:55,757 --> 00:24:02,128
However, Miyamoto,
the bodies you brought...

201
00:24:02,297 --> 00:24:06,199
have nothing to do
with my school

202
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:12,136
But I hear that they drew
when he slandered you

203
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:18,076
Please. None of my students
are as weak as that

204
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:21,409
You call me a meddler, then?

205
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:28,782
Miyamoto, I teach the Shogun.
Mine is an honorable family

206
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:35,090
My 100 students are
accomplished men

207
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:43,429
I see. Forgive my rudeness for
bringing the corpses

208
00:24:52,848 --> 00:24:54,338
Let me pass

209
00:24:55,584 --> 00:25:00,817
Professor Obana told me they
could not be his men

210
00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:04,755
Don't be offended.
Please give them up to us

211
00:25:04,893 --> 00:25:08,954
I will not.
The dead men won't like it

212
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:15,235
Fortunately I know several sutras.
I'll bury them

213
00:25:15,871 --> 00:25:17,930
I learned a lesson today

214
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:36,614
"Here lie four unknown samurai"

215
00:26:39,187 --> 00:26:40,552
So it is you

216
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,254
I thought it was one of them

217
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:50,853
Thank you for your help
last year

218
00:26:52,434 --> 00:26:57,371
You fought marvelously.
I saw it

219
00:26:58,006 --> 00:27:01,999
I learned of your ability today
for the first time

220
00:27:06,448 --> 00:27:12,182
Those four. One stroke each!
-Try it?

221
00:27:17,425 --> 00:27:20,724
Kid. Go away awhile

222
00:27:21,763 --> 00:27:23,890
Be calm no matter what you see

223
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:38,269
I've always wanted to meet you

224
00:27:41,516 --> 00:27:43,882
Stop.
-Scared?

225
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:46,783
No.
Postpone it

226
00:27:48,523 --> 00:27:52,687
Elsewhere.
If we fight here...

227
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:55,989
they may say I fought for Obana

228
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,767
Which is not true

229
00:28:00,168 --> 00:28:05,037
Let us fix it properly
and fight freely

230
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:13,674
You are right.
Tomorrow evening...

231
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:18,252
I'll be at the East Gate.
Right? -Very good

232
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:15,438
You have been evading me.
Scared of me? -No

233
00:29:16,611 --> 00:29:20,342
However, I won't elope with you

234
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:26,013
You think I am joking?

235
00:29:27,455 --> 00:29:28,979
You meant it

236
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:35,863
You are a darling.
I meant it

237
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:39,262
But I've changed my mind.
-Why?

238
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:41,163
Tomorrow night you'll know

239
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:47,206
I'll do or die!
You won't be seeing me, anyway

240
00:29:57,185 --> 00:30:01,246
If I win I'll seek a much
larger fortune

241
00:30:02,824 --> 00:30:07,818
If I lose...
I'll be dead

242
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:17,296
In either case, you'll always
remember me as your lover

243
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:26,343
His Lordship

244
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:49,729
What was it?
-Well, he was delighted

245
00:30:49,904 --> 00:30:53,067
He wants to hire Kojiro
as his teacher

246
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:59,243
Kojiro did something big.
Where is he?

247
00:30:59,414 --> 00:31:01,245
I'll bring him here

248
00:31:06,154 --> 00:31:09,681
Did you come back?
-I bring good news!

249
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:24,799
My Master heard about you
and Obana's students

250
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:31,310
Please. They were just weaklings.
It did me no credit

251
00:31:31,446 --> 00:31:36,748
However, their master is
Lord Shogun's teacher

252
00:31:37,085 --> 00:31:41,920
Vengeance will be sought.
-I'll fight

253
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:47,027
Listen to me.
You are too full of youthful vigor

254
00:31:47,228 --> 00:31:53,258
My Master said "Such animosity
must be stopped"

255
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:57,963
He suddenly decided to employ
you as a retainer

256
00:31:59,441 --> 00:32:03,275
Well? lf you become Lord
Hosokawa's teacher...

257
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:07,438
they dare not attack you.
-I decline

258
00:32:08,316 --> 00:32:12,810
I dislike seeking protection.
-Don't be silly

259
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:20,159
If they challenge,
fight as Lord Hosokawa's teacher

260
00:32:20,328 --> 00:32:24,128
It's not like you.
Another thing

261
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:27,701
Chief Retainer Sado is recommending
Musashi

262
00:32:29,537 --> 00:32:33,598
Musashi?
-He is being sought quietly

263
00:32:34,175 --> 00:32:37,872
We must decide this
before they find him

264
00:32:38,046 --> 00:32:42,142
Taking an initiative is always
advantageous

265
00:32:42,317 --> 00:32:46,947
Listen.
I duel with Musashi tomorrow

266
00:32:47,088 --> 00:32:51,422
What! With him?
-So your worry is over

267
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:59,263
His dream is too vast

268
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:25,824
What noise!

269
00:33:29,297 --> 00:33:31,356
Hey, quiet you!

270
00:33:34,903 --> 00:33:36,131
Thanks

271
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:52,078
They became quiet.
You are persuasive. -Sure!

272
00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:02,794
Excuse me

273
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:15,072
Samurai! Stop eating

274
00:34:16,044 --> 00:34:22,005
Confess you're scared.
Don't pretend you're calm at heart

275
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,051
Stop!

276
00:34:27,855 --> 00:34:31,222
Who are you?
-Don't know me?

277
00:34:31,826 --> 00:34:37,560
Those who don't know me here,
must be deaf

278
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,836
Speak loudly, as I am
hard of hearing

279
00:34:43,137 --> 00:34:45,503
Who?
-Shut up!

280
00:34:46,808 --> 00:34:51,404
I'm Kumagoro the horse-dealer,
a tough guy

281
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:56,209
And when I say tough I mean tough.
-Horse-dealer, eh?

282
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:01,481
I deal with samurai.
I handle live horses, mind you

283
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:06,093
So what?
-You sent this kid to me...

284
00:35:06,227 --> 00:35:10,391
to tell me to be quiet,
didn't you?

285
00:35:10,531 --> 00:35:16,629
I have a big voice.
You don't own this inn, do you?

286
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,072
So, what?
-Apologize

287
00:35:21,442 --> 00:35:25,344
Write a letter of apology
addressed to us all

288
00:35:25,513 --> 00:35:30,041
Or I'll take you out into
the yard and punish you

289
00:35:31,185 --> 00:35:35,121
Amusing.
Very interesting

290
00:35:35,256 --> 00:35:39,716
Fresh! You heard me.
Now answer me!

291
00:35:39,894 --> 00:35:43,352
Answer me at once, or else...!

292
00:35:48,736 --> 00:35:51,967
Which would be better?

293
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:32,843
Too many.
Wash these sticks

294
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,959
He's terrific!

295
00:37:04,612 --> 00:37:08,070
Training for revenge?

296
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:12,913
I'm his pupil now.
Musashi Miyamoto! No wonder!

297
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:17,681
Are you out of your head?
-Of course not!

298
00:37:21,262 --> 00:37:24,754
Horse-dealer.
Did you say Musashi?

299
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,804
Does he live here?

300
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,011
Now I fully understand you

301
00:37:40,581 --> 00:37:43,448
I will not force my ideas on you

302
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:49,513
However, will you be good enough
to see my Master?

303
00:37:51,392 --> 00:37:56,489
But, I am to fight a duel tonight.
-A duel?

304
00:37:56,764 --> 00:38:01,599
It will be the memorable match
of my life. -Who's your man?

305
00:38:01,903 --> 00:38:04,167
Kojiro Sasaki.
-Sasaki?

306
00:38:06,274 --> 00:38:07,798
You mean it?

307
00:38:08,776 --> 00:38:16,740
I hear he may be employed
by my Master

308
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:18,749
What? Is Kojiro...

309
00:38:19,187 --> 00:38:23,954
Miyamoto, if you win...

310
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:28,922
...please certainly accept my offer

311
00:38:37,672 --> 00:38:39,572
Must you fight?

312
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:25,052
Hey, kid!
Where is Musashi?

313
00:39:37,565 --> 00:39:41,501
"l have decided to leave
on a journey

314
00:39:41,802 --> 00:39:46,762
Let me please postpone the
promised match for a year

315
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:52,176
When we meet again, I will be
quite ready...

316
00:39:52,313 --> 00:39:57,046
to vie with you.
Yours truly"

317
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:26,440
Why do you cry?
-I don't like it

318
00:40:26,881 --> 00:40:30,180
That Kojiro as Hosokawa's teacher!

319
00:40:31,652 --> 00:40:34,815
I dreamt of worldly success once

320
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:39,622
I thought it was natural
to settle down

321
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:42,960
But now I want to train
myself further

322
00:41:16,564 --> 00:41:22,400
Jotaro, I'm hungry.
Let's eat, shall we?

323
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:28,168
Kuma.
I'm your senior, am I not?

324
00:41:28,776 --> 00:41:32,405
Call me Master Jotaro

325
00:41:33,914 --> 00:41:38,681
I say... Master Jotaro.
-What is it?

326
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,621
A man should be kind to his juniors

327
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:47,523
Let's eat, shall we?
Shall we?

328
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:23,592
Drop the reins.
Or we'll shoot

329
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:31,130
Surrender your swords

330
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:44,848
Step back

331
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:22,847
How did you reach here safely?
-We met brigands

332
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:27,256
Nothing happened?
-We won a horse

333
00:43:30,297 --> 00:43:35,792
They appear often?
-More than often, sir. They ruin us

334
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:40,532
They steal our crops,
they steal our women

335
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:43,438
We're at their tender mercy

336
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:47,274
Many have left this village
for safety

337
00:43:47,414 --> 00:43:52,078
Imagine. They won a horse!
Isn't it something?

338
00:43:55,189 --> 00:43:59,091
Have you an axe to cut down trees?

339
00:44:17,978 --> 00:44:21,573
Master.
Why fell trees?

340
00:44:21,816 --> 00:44:25,013
Build a hut.
-What for, Master?

341
00:44:25,986 --> 00:44:30,320
We'll live here.
And plough

342
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:38,227
What about fencing practice?
-We'll continue as we plough

343
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:39,832
Brace up!

344
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:21,269
Hurry up will you, girls?
They'll be angry

345
00:45:21,408 --> 00:45:26,675
Hurry! They seem like rich people.
We'll get rich!

346
00:45:27,514 --> 00:45:31,712
Rich - nothing!
The keeper'll become rich

347
00:45:31,886 --> 00:45:35,720
We'll become thinner.
-The greedy pimp!

348
00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:38,951
Hurry up!

349
00:45:40,794 --> 00:45:45,288
You're free, Hanagiri?
-Let me breathe

350
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:51,302
We're short of one girl for
five customers. Hanagiri!

351
00:45:55,509 --> 00:46:00,446
Keeper.
Do all your girls wear bells?

352
00:46:00,614 --> 00:46:06,280
No, sir, she's the only one.
Tinkles around like a kitten

353
00:46:06,987 --> 00:46:11,720
Hanagiri, you say?
Bring her. At once

354
00:46:15,696 --> 00:46:19,632
You have a quick ear.
-Reminded of someone?

355
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,292
You win!
We'll stick to drinks then

356
00:46:40,054 --> 00:46:41,783
So it's you

357
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:58,066
You laugh at me.
Don't you?

358
00:46:59,206 --> 00:47:04,940
I'm not that heartless.
-I know you. Worse than that

359
00:47:05,179 --> 00:47:09,343
I didn't even touch you.
-It was your vanity

360
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:14,146
Had I not loved him,
you'd have...

361
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:19,824
Probably.
Come here and pour us drinks

362
00:47:21,962 --> 00:47:25,295
She cares for Musashi

363
00:47:27,434 --> 00:47:32,167
Unrequited love.
See her now!

364
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:34,165
Stop!

365
00:47:38,512 --> 00:47:42,744
I may be soiled
but my heart is pure

366
00:47:44,752 --> 00:47:48,984
Is it?
I'll tell you where he is now

367
00:47:52,926 --> 00:47:56,692
He ploughs at Hoten Field
in Shimosa

368
00:47:57,898 --> 00:48:00,458
Care to go?
-No joking, sir

369
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:04,401
If she goes, I'll suffer a big loss.
-Keeper

370
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:08,906
Enough?

371
00:48:37,337 --> 00:48:39,396
Just a farmer

372
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,344
A woman?
-What?

373
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:08,097
What a find!

374
00:49:10,504 --> 00:49:13,962
Stop!
I saw her first. Didn't l?

375
00:49:27,054 --> 00:49:31,582
A girl.
-Brigands again!

376
00:50:03,557 --> 00:50:05,149
Why - Otsu!

377
00:50:05,759 --> 00:50:08,125
Why - Jotaro!

378
00:50:10,697 --> 00:50:13,495
More loot

379
00:50:18,939 --> 00:50:23,569
Master!
-What, we eat now?

380
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:28,377
Big news! Otsu came!
-Otsu?

381
00:50:28,515 --> 00:50:33,817
Lord Yagyu of Edo told her, she
says. How did he know about us?

382
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:37,620
Bring me something to wear

383
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:42,323
She's washing her face now
to make herself presentable

384
00:50:42,496 --> 00:50:43,986
Will you hurry?

385
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:40,687
I missed you

386
00:51:41,722 --> 00:51:46,352
I thought you were mad at me.
-But why?

387
00:51:52,899 --> 00:51:54,890
I was to blame

388
00:51:57,471 --> 00:52:00,907
It was sudden.
So...

389
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:03,940
You forgive me?

390
00:52:05,879 --> 00:52:09,838
I won't leave you again!

391
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:17,621
That's the hut we built

392
00:52:18,725 --> 00:52:21,216
We three live in it

393
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:26,729
And we have tilled those
patches of land

394
00:52:27,901 --> 00:52:33,737
It was barren. But it is yielding
crops lately thanks to our labor

395
00:52:35,676 --> 00:52:40,306
In the old days
I hated farm work

396
00:52:41,315 --> 00:52:44,307
And was daydreaming always

397
00:52:45,952 --> 00:52:50,286
Wanting to become famous
and successful

398
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:53,690
Vainly and at random

399
00:52:54,961 --> 00:53:00,991
Now I'm tilling again.
Isn't it strange?

400
00:53:01,835 --> 00:53:05,931
I'm beginning to learn
the value of life

401
00:53:08,408 --> 00:53:10,569
The soil has taught me that

402
00:53:21,955 --> 00:53:23,718
Jotaro

403
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:31,588
Cook something for Otsu.
I'll ask old Gen to house her

404
00:53:35,335 --> 00:53:38,566
Are you very happy
to see him again?

405
00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:46,405
He's still angry about me.
-What happened?

406
00:53:57,591 --> 00:54:00,651
Listen, Jotaro.
-Master Jotaro

407
00:54:00,827 --> 00:54:05,423
Yes, sir.
I don't understand him at all

408
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,933
Me, neither.
He's carving again

409
00:55:40,193 --> 00:55:44,459
He told me he'd done
something bad to her

410
00:55:44,631 --> 00:55:51,833
Can't be true! lf so,
why would she come here? -Yes

411
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:56,637
Who goes there?

412
00:57:16,957 --> 00:57:22,020
I hate to leave this village.
I'll stick to it...

413
00:57:22,162 --> 00:57:25,393
even if I may be killed
on that account

414
00:57:25,532 --> 00:57:28,660
Please, sir, teach us how to fight

415
00:57:28,835 --> 00:57:32,134
We must fight the brigands
away from here!

416
00:57:32,305 --> 00:57:34,865
Please, Master!

417
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,473
It's no use teaching you
how to fight

418
00:57:41,848 --> 00:57:45,511
If you must learn to run

419
00:57:46,252 --> 00:57:50,211
Away from them, sir?
-And laugh last

420
00:57:52,726 --> 00:57:58,187
You're going there by yourself?
-Yes. I have come alone so far

421
00:57:58,365 --> 00:58:00,595
It's dangerous from here

422
00:58:00,734 --> 00:58:05,728
The way to the next village
is infested with bandits

423
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:09,238
I've known bandits
since I was a baby

424
00:58:09,976 --> 00:58:13,343
My father was a brigand, too

425
00:58:15,315 --> 00:58:19,274
Isn't my lunch ready yet?
-It is

426
00:58:19,653 --> 00:58:23,646
Better disguise yourself as a man

427
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:26,350
They'll stop any girl

428
00:58:28,728 --> 00:58:34,098
Men have made a plaything of me.
I don't mind anything now

429
00:58:35,702 --> 00:58:40,730
If I can see him,
I'll die content

430
00:58:46,913 --> 00:58:52,647
One moment. Men come here regularly
to buy oil and salt

431
00:58:52,786 --> 00:58:58,190
Wait till then and go with them.
-A good idea

432
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,985
That may be them

433
00:59:08,001 --> 00:59:09,559
Give us drinks!

434
00:59:18,878 --> 00:59:22,473
It's bad since those samurai came

435
00:59:22,649 --> 00:59:27,746
I hear they're teaching them
fencing. -Who are they?

436
00:59:29,756 --> 00:59:31,917
We've got to destroy them, anyway

437
00:59:33,727 --> 00:59:37,663
This is too small.
Bring bigger bowls!

438
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:46,733
Keeper, that your daughter?

439
00:59:46,906 --> 00:59:50,808
Hey, girlie!
Come here!

440
01:00:02,122 --> 01:00:05,148
Why - you're Akemi!

441
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,929
You're Toji!
-Yes, I am

442
01:00:12,098 --> 01:00:15,556
Know her?
-She's Oko's daughter.

443
01:00:19,405 --> 01:00:22,203
What happened to my mother?

444
01:00:22,342 --> 01:00:26,005
Where is she?
-I killed her

445
01:00:29,816 --> 01:00:33,809
You were there when
she was killed!

446
01:00:33,987 --> 01:00:38,720
You surrendered to save your skin!
-Shut up!

447
01:00:38,892 --> 01:00:42,919
I avenged my brother's death.
-Avenged?

448
01:00:43,096 --> 01:00:46,964
Your mother had killed him.
I'm Kohei

449
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:52,504
But you two had killed my father!
-You'll be with him

450
01:01:15,395 --> 01:01:17,386
That's the village

451
01:01:19,365 --> 01:01:25,031
Tell them the brigands were all
arrested by the officials

452
01:01:25,205 --> 01:01:26,536
Understand?

453
01:01:28,208 --> 01:01:31,666
And set Musashi's hut on fire
tomorrow evening

454
01:01:31,845 --> 01:01:35,679
We'll attack then.
Right?

455
01:01:36,783 --> 01:01:41,550
I can't. Never! No!
-Don't be a fool!

456
01:01:43,022 --> 01:01:47,652
Musashi is his enemy.
Also mine

457
01:01:48,361 --> 01:01:52,388
He spared you.
You must do it

458
01:01:53,366 --> 01:01:59,965
If you won't...
I'll have to kill you

459
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:26,525
Don't. You're still sick

460
01:02:27,133 --> 01:02:31,729
But I can't stay idle here.
-Stop!

461
01:02:36,409 --> 01:02:41,711
Tell me.
Tell me what to do now

462
01:02:42,582 --> 01:02:46,780
Must I leave?
-Well, no

463
01:02:47,353 --> 01:02:52,313
Tell me then.
Why do you evade me?

464
01:02:53,293 --> 01:02:56,456
You dislike me?
Hate me?

465
01:02:57,864 --> 01:03:01,493
Have I been erased from your heart?

466
01:03:02,535 --> 01:03:03,832
Please!

467
01:03:05,138 --> 01:03:12,169
You're heartless! Stony-hearted!
I hate such a man! -But...

468
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,179
I can't live!

469
01:03:20,386 --> 01:03:24,117
I wish I were dead!
-Don't be stupid

470
01:03:25,692 --> 01:03:30,186
I am stupid!
Watch what a stupid girl does!

471
01:03:43,509 --> 01:03:44,999
What are you doing?

472
01:04:00,026 --> 01:04:03,018
So. She's here

473
01:04:23,049 --> 01:04:26,610
This is because of her.
That dame!

474
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:33,682
I'm sorry. -Old Gen
can accommodate another person

475
01:04:35,395 --> 01:04:40,094
Otsu won't like it.
Neither will Akemi

476
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:44,531
I think I'll go ask Aunt Oseki

477
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,503
I'll do that for you.
-Me, too

478
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:23,238
At last we're alone

479
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,676
Why don't you like it?

480
01:05:31,984 --> 01:05:34,452
You have changed, Akemi

481
01:05:34,687 --> 01:05:38,748
But I like your tone.
I'm so glad

482
01:05:39,158 --> 01:05:43,959
Darling! I have loved you since
we lived in the hills

483
01:05:44,197 --> 01:05:48,031
I really cared for you.
-You don't mean that

484
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:54,731
But I mean it. I tried to tell you
when you were trapped last time

485
01:05:55,808 --> 01:05:58,675
I didn't understand you

486
01:05:58,978 --> 01:06:03,005
Darling... elope with me

487
01:06:03,182 --> 01:06:05,548
Won't you?
-Stop it

488
01:06:09,222 --> 01:06:13,420
Oko, your mother, asked me to do
that once

489
01:06:14,794 --> 01:06:17,262
Her blood is in your veins

490
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:23,868
No. I'm different.
I'm not like her at all

491
01:06:26,372 --> 01:06:30,672
I never loved men
till I met you

492
01:06:32,645 --> 01:06:36,945
I've never loved anybody
but you, darling

493
01:06:37,116 --> 01:06:38,981
That's why I came here

494
01:06:58,504 --> 01:07:00,267
I'm sorry

495
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:07,101
It's not your fault

496
01:07:10,316 --> 01:07:16,277
You have Otsu.
I shouldn't be unreasonable

497
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:28,332
I will leave in the morning

498
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:35,964
Be happy with her.
Good luck

499
01:07:54,126 --> 01:07:58,620
Darling.
It's hard!

500
01:08:02,134 --> 01:08:05,592
But I give you up!
I promise

501
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:09,832
So hold me tightly before I go!

502
01:08:11,711 --> 01:08:17,081
Choke me to death!
In your arms!

503
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:22,483
As your last favor!

504
01:08:51,584 --> 01:08:56,317
Men!
I heard on my way here...

505
01:08:56,455 --> 01:09:00,323
that all the brigands
were arrested. -Really?

506
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:15,265
The whole town's talking.
-If they're arrested, we are safe

507
01:09:23,582 --> 01:09:28,178
Akemi said that?
-Serves 'em right. -Now we're saved

508
01:09:34,593 --> 01:09:38,085
Akemi, are you sure about
the brigands?

509
01:09:41,967 --> 01:09:45,300
Akemi! Is it true?

510
01:09:47,506 --> 01:09:49,872
You wouldn't believe me

511
01:09:53,312 --> 01:09:57,408
I'll stay here awhile.
I like it here

512
01:09:58,617 --> 01:10:04,783
Master, did you hear it?
Very good news, eh?

513
01:10:07,193 --> 01:10:18,536
Did you hear? -Yes, I did.
-Let's stop work and celebrate!

514
01:11:25,070 --> 01:11:30,235
She'll signal to us with a fire.
Set houses afire!

515
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,537
You kill the villagers

516
01:11:34,747 --> 01:11:39,275
Don't take on Musashi.
I'll handle him

517
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:55,223
Come with me.
We'll talk alone

518
01:12:13,152 --> 01:12:14,551
Where's Otsu?

519
01:12:15,621 --> 01:12:19,057
She's at my home.
-She'll play the flute

520
01:12:20,326 --> 01:12:21,588
I'll fetch her

521
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:33,761
Otsu.
You know how a girl feels

522
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:38,740
I'm in love with him.
-Akemi

523
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:43,744
You are a terrible girl

524
01:12:45,284 --> 01:12:49,015
Why must you come between us two?

525
01:12:59,932 --> 01:13:02,162
Take it up

526
01:13:03,536 --> 01:13:07,165
If you want him...
fight!

527
01:13:08,507 --> 01:13:13,444
How horrible!
-Take it up

528
01:13:42,675 --> 01:13:44,404
Help! Somebody!

529
01:13:52,618 --> 01:13:55,553
Fire! Fire!

530
01:14:28,921 --> 01:14:31,389
Brigands! Brigands!

531
01:14:42,868 --> 01:14:47,601
Calm down! Quiet!
Take women and kids to Old Gen's.

532
01:15:23,509 --> 01:15:28,446
Musashi! Come out!
Fight with me!

533
01:15:34,953 --> 01:15:39,788
Musashi, I'm here to avenge
my brother's death!

534
01:16:10,155 --> 01:16:11,850
Brace up, Kuma!

535
01:16:13,659 --> 01:16:18,790
Jotaro... you're... truly my senior

536
01:16:31,877 --> 01:16:33,003
Akemi!

537
01:16:35,013 --> 01:16:36,275
Well done!

538
01:16:43,522 --> 01:16:44,921
What are you doing?

539
01:17:14,153 --> 01:17:18,590
Akemi! Brace up!

540
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:26,227
Otsu. I'm dying now

541
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:33,665
I've been so wicked.
-Oh, no!

542
01:17:33,872 --> 01:17:40,209
You saved my life!
Don't die! Akemi!

543
01:17:51,957 --> 01:17:53,754
Darling!

544
01:17:55,727 --> 01:17:57,661
At last...

545
01:17:59,131 --> 01:18:02,396
you hold me...

546
01:18:02,801 --> 01:18:07,135
in your arms.
-Brace up, Akemi!

547
01:18:09,007 --> 01:18:12,272
It's all over with me

548
01:18:14,613 --> 01:18:20,882
I can't even...
see you

549
01:18:30,863 --> 01:18:36,768
Be happy together, you two

550
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:36,490
Musashi!
Where is Master Musashi?

551
01:19:56,315 --> 01:20:02,345
"l have been officially employed
as Lord Hosokawa's teacher...

552
01:20:02,521 --> 01:20:05,684
and will leave for Kokura,
his Castle Town

553
01:20:05,991 --> 01:20:13,454
I am desirous to have the match
at Kokura, April next."

554
01:20:56,641 --> 01:21:01,704
My Master's so unreasonable
to leave you like this

555
01:21:04,282 --> 01:21:08,616
After all,
he prefers fencing to me

556
01:21:24,669 --> 01:21:31,598
Kokura Town, Lord Hosokawa's
country seat

557
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:42,349
"Our Lord's Retainer Kojiro Sasaki
will fight by command...

558
01:21:42,487 --> 01:21:47,083
with Musashi Miyamoto of
Mimasaku Province."

559
01:21:47,959 --> 01:21:50,928
Musashi.
In five days, eh?

560
01:21:53,665 --> 01:21:57,761
Fight fair and square,
like a real samurai

561
01:21:59,704 --> 01:22:06,405
He is a peerless match, sir.
I will not spoil your honorable name

562
01:22:06,711 --> 01:22:10,841
In four days

563
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:16,844
He's busy.
But I am his childhood friend

564
01:22:16,988 --> 01:22:19,013
An intimate friend

565
01:22:19,157 --> 01:22:22,149
I was with him at the fencing school

566
01:22:22,294 --> 01:22:25,730
He'll remember my name without fail

567
01:22:36,775 --> 01:22:40,074
They ignored me while I was jobless

568
01:22:41,079 --> 01:22:46,346
But today even strangers
want to see me

569
01:22:48,653 --> 01:22:55,217
Such is life.
-But it's something for rejoicing

570
01:22:55,527 --> 01:23:00,089
Your prowess will be acknowledged,
definitely

571
01:23:02,167 --> 01:23:06,570
After the match,
another big event

572
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:12,071
My daughter is impatient

573
01:23:21,887 --> 01:23:25,846
Please, Otsu!
Let me find my Master

574
01:23:26,024 --> 01:23:30,358
Please.
Why have I come all this way?

575
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:36,895
In this match
he might meet the worst

576
01:23:38,069 --> 01:23:42,597
If so, I'll gather his remains

577
01:23:44,442 --> 01:23:49,846
So I must see him.
I must speak to him!

578
01:24:36,695 --> 01:24:38,925
From Musashi, sir?

579
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:46,066
"l will arrive in my own boat
in time

580
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:48,706
I hope this is satisfactory"

581
01:24:50,909 --> 01:24:56,370
I see.
He didn't come here out of respect

582
01:24:56,948 --> 01:25:00,145
He'll go directly to the isle

583
01:25:02,721 --> 01:25:05,019
But where is he?

584
01:25:09,928 --> 01:25:12,158
Brace up, Otsu

585
01:25:18,637 --> 01:25:23,438
What happened?
-She's sick

586
01:25:53,571 --> 01:25:54,936
Omitsu

587
01:25:57,709 --> 01:25:59,199
You look pensive

588
01:26:00,445 --> 01:26:04,973
Think I'll lose?
-Oh, no

589
01:26:05,116 --> 01:26:09,815
You may not expect it
but you're afraid

590
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:19,423
I'll win.
To defeat him has been my ambition

591
01:26:24,336 --> 01:26:27,703
I'll defeat him with my own ability

592
01:26:30,475 --> 01:26:35,640
Prayers of those who wish me victory
and talismans...

593
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:37,907
are useless to me

594
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:42,981
Therefore don't pray for me, dear

595
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:52,753
Sympathy harms my
mental tranquility

596
01:26:53,765 --> 01:26:56,165
I want to fight alone

597
01:27:16,888 --> 01:27:18,913
Return to the castle

598
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:31,034
Now I feel relieved

599
01:27:59,431 --> 01:28:03,060
Hey, Sasuke. Is it ready?
-Sure

600
01:28:03,201 --> 01:28:08,833
It's an honor for a boatman
to row for Master Musashi

601
01:28:09,007 --> 01:28:11,669
The boat's been purified

602
01:28:20,752 --> 01:28:24,654
Thank you for the kind gift
I wear now

603
01:28:25,423 --> 01:28:30,087
I feel so refreshed.
-Good luck, sir

604
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:38,631
One moment. I want you to see
someone before you leave. -Me?

605
01:28:41,206 --> 01:28:43,037
Don't bother to get up

606
01:28:51,516 --> 01:28:53,074
Otsu!

607
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:59,287
I can't see him like this

608
01:29:06,297 --> 01:29:07,696
Master!

609
01:29:24,282 --> 01:29:28,446
Don't come in!
I'm coming!

610
01:30:03,388 --> 01:30:07,722
Otsu.
-At last we meet again

611
01:30:10,795 --> 01:30:16,028
You look weak. Very ill?
-I'm cured now

612
01:30:17,068 --> 01:30:21,129
My illness is so whimsical, you know

613
01:30:25,743 --> 01:30:29,270
Let's take a walk, shall we, Otsu?

614
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:36,647
This is the first time
you ever asked me

615
01:30:39,057 --> 01:30:42,151
Let's. Of course

616
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:13,054
Until today
I've walked my own way...

617
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:16,793
and made you suffer a lot

618
01:31:18,329 --> 01:31:24,165
Forgive me. But I'm not
as heartless as I may seem

619
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:28,801
I know.
-You do?

620
01:31:28,973 --> 01:31:32,704
That's why I've loved you

621
01:31:37,148 --> 01:31:38,410
Darling!

622
01:31:43,721 --> 01:31:46,053
What a lucky day it is today!

623
01:31:46,791 --> 01:31:49,954
I can fight with clear conscience now

624
01:31:52,563 --> 01:31:54,497
Why do you cry?

625
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,763
I hate it

626
01:31:58,603 --> 01:32:04,064
I wish you weren't a samurai!

627
01:32:13,785 --> 01:32:19,985
Darling, abandon your sword.
Don't fight!

628
01:32:21,659 --> 01:32:27,154
Let them call you a coward!
I crave for happiness, just us two!

629
01:32:27,331 --> 01:32:31,028
That's impossible now, Otsu

630
01:32:33,071 --> 01:32:39,340
Please! I won't let you go!
Oh no!

631
01:32:39,811 --> 01:32:42,279
Don't be unreasonable

632
01:32:43,815 --> 01:32:45,976
I'm a woman

633
01:32:46,918 --> 01:32:51,548
I wish you had been an ordinary man

634
01:32:51,856 --> 01:32:56,293
Otsu, don't demoralize me, please

635
01:32:56,994 --> 01:33:01,021
A samurai's wife sends off
her man with a smile

636
01:33:02,967 --> 01:33:08,030
Especially when it might be
for good

637
01:35:18,469 --> 01:35:23,406
Is that the Island?
-No, sir, that's not it

638
01:35:23,574 --> 01:35:27,340
Our island lies beyond that.
A smaller one

639
01:35:28,779 --> 01:35:31,873
Is this where a sea-battle was
fought in olden times?

640
01:35:36,988 --> 01:35:39,047
What is that for, sir?

641
01:35:40,758 --> 01:35:42,385
For the duel

642
01:35:44,595 --> 01:35:48,326
Fight with a wooden one?
-I like the size

643
01:35:49,867 --> 01:35:56,363
Listen.
If I lose and fall...

644
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:59,475
take my dead body back...

645
01:36:00,978 --> 01:36:04,436
to Otsu
-Dear God!

646
01:36:04,615 --> 01:36:08,415
Don't talk rot!
-Take this as my memento

647
01:36:19,563 --> 01:36:22,054
Musashi's boat is sighted!

648
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:32,869
Musashi is coming!
-Musashi has come!

649
01:36:41,686 --> 01:36:44,177
Don't be nervous

650
01:36:45,289 --> 01:36:48,781
You'll see the mysterious
power of my sword

651
01:36:50,895 --> 01:36:52,453
Watch me

652
01:38:18,582 --> 01:38:19,640
Musashi!

653
01:42:33,937 --> 01:42:38,397
Mr. Miyamoto.
That was splendid

654
01:42:40,611 --> 01:42:46,572
He was the best fencer
I will ever encounter

655
01:43:32,863 --> 01:43:36,458
I'm so glad.
I'm so glad!

656
01:43:37,868 --> 01:43:43,431
I was praying
so I wouldn't bring you back dead

657
01:43:44,475 --> 01:43:49,310
I'm so glad about it all.
I'm so happy!

658
01:44:20,444 --> 01:44:30,080
THE END
