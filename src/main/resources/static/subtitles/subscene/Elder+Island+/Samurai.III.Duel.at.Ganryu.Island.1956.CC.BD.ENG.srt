<i>How long must he remain a ronin?</i>

22
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,636
<i>Will Kojiro Sasaki's dream
remain unattained?</i>

23
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,266
Blind fools!

24
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,201
Poor swallow.

25
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,664
Not just anyone can do that.

26
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,419
The "swallow turn" swing.
I'll kill Musashi with it.

27
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,172
Why must you fight him?

28
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,633
It's my long cherished dream.

29
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:44,265
He's got nothing against you.
Why must you kill him?

30
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,850
Tell me!

31
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,024
You're a devil!

32
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:58,279
Why get excited about him?

33
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,407
Please. Forget him.

34
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,536
I won't mention him from now on.
So please.

35
00:04:05,621 --> 00:04:07,246
Conceited girl!

36
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:10,207
I'm not after him because of you.

37
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,710
He's good.

38
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,422
He's my only match
in this country today.

39
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,885
My dream is to fight him.

40
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,096
He must dream of it too.

41
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,477
Akemi, stop!

42
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,145
I won't.

43
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,899
You scare me.
You horrify me.

44
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,734
You'll go looking for Musashi?

45
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,404
Go, then.

46
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,658
If you see him,

47
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,243
remind him that he is to duel
with Kojiro Sasaki.

48
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,162
He must not lose his life before then.

49
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,099
Musashi!

00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,608
Come on!

54
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,075
You?

55
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,162
No, I pass.

56
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:14,623
- How about you?
- Maybe some other time.

57
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:20,212
If no one sallies forth,
I'll leave.

58
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,467
I'll call myself today's winner!

59
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,886
Any objections?

60
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,139
Speak up!

61
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,518
You may come in a group.

62
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,021
No one?

63
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,906
No contenders? Oh, well.

64
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,497
Let's go.

65
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,459
Damn monks!

66
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,254
What? Wait, kid!

67
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:09,845
I like your spirit.
You insulted me audaciously.

68
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,389
You challenged me. Let's go!

69
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,142
Fight with you?

70
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,984
You can't?
Then why did you say that?

71
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,487
He's only a child.

72
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,739
Forgive him.

73
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:32,326
- Who are you?
- His companion.

74
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,413
- You urged him?
- No, it was my own idea.

75
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,458
Then you'll fight with me.

76
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,419
You may attack me together,
if you wish.

77
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,507
- Please.
- I won't forgive him.

78
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,474
I apologize in his place.

79
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,767
No!

80
00:07:56,852 --> 00:08:00,896
I was insulted publicly.

81
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,233
I won't swallow it.

82
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,023
Fool.

83
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,026
You're a prize fool, Agon.

84
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:51,071
Agon, stop it.

85
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,740
No!

86
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,491
Stop!

87
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,247
You're no match for him at all.

88
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:05,127
He's peerless.
Hasn't lost in 60 odd matches.

89
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,838
Stop it!

90
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,007
Musashi Miyamoto?

91
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,015
This is no fight.

92
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:24,063
The winner of the tournament
is Priest Agon here!

93
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:36,158
Priest Agon reminded me
of your old self.

94
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,745
- Yes.
- I marvel at your improvement.

95
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,916
Strength alone won't make
an accomplished swordsman.

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,964
He must be strong.
At the same time, he must be just.

97
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,843
I want to be able to fight
without regrets.

98
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,514
My past encounters
were full of them.

99
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,894
"One can only smile contentedly
after 10 years of pilgrimage."

100
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,522
Musashi, you still have much to learn.

101
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,150
I feel so pleased tonight.

102
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,905
Have you ever fallen in love?

103
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,828
I know a person
who's madly in love with you.

104
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,330
Do you want to meet this person?

105
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:24,873
Well...

106
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,378
So there's already
someone in your heart.

107
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,505
Don't worry.

108
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,842
The person I'm talking about is a man.

109
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:39,013
- A man who longs for a man?
- Yes, a man.

110
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:45,102
He wants to meet you
and he hasn't even seen you once.

111
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,521
Who is he?

112
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,440
Lord Yagyu.

113
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,651
What? The Lord Shogun's teacher?

114
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:57,323
Yes. Why don't you go to Edo
and see Yagyu?

115
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:16,592
You brought a letter
from Lord Karasumaru? I see.

116
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,598
So your name's Otsu.

117
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,979
Are you connected
with Musashi Miyamoto?

118
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,484
Yes, Your Grace.
I'm looking for him.

119
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,071
You're too late.

120
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,076
He was here until this morning.

121
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,414
- He was here?
- Yes, but he's left for Edo.

122
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:54,922
Stop.

123
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,174
Don't chase him.

124
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,760
I must see him.

125
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,055
I see, you care for him.

126
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:25,536
EDO

127
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,155
I am Okaya.

128
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,865
One moment.

129
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,785
Why cover the spearhead?

130
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,789
Don't worry about
hurting me, please.

131
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:11,832
But -

132
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,917
Take it off.

133
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,675
Note his assurance, my Lord.

134
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:32,561
Now that I have uncovered it,
use a sword yourself.

135
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,105
No, this will do.

136
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,733
- I won't fight like this.
- It's all right.

137
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,028
No, use your sword!

138
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,779
No.

139
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,240
I am only a masterless ronin.

140
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:50,621
If I use my sword,
it will offend His Lordship.

141
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,082
Full of confidence, sir.

142
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,127
Okaya, let him have his way.

143
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,180
He overdid it.

144
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,517
It's an embarrassment.

145
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,022
Was the audience successful?

146
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,233
Well -

147
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:06,321
I'm afraid not.
- Why? A man of your ability!

148
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,156
It's true.

149
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:14,663
My opponent was not very strong.
I should have been gentle.

150
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,417
- Did you win?
- I did.

151
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,129
True, he will live.

152
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,339
But as a cripple.

153
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:30,470
Nobody will hire a swordsman
who cripples his vassal.

154
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,807
I overdid it.

155
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,561
I like it.
You always mean business.

156
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,943
I feel I've done nothing wrong,
but people disagree.

157
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,993
What are you doing?

158
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:04,129
Still like me
after I tore your present?

159
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,007
I did the same thing today.

160
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,095
I will remain a ronin.

161
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,311
I like it.

162
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:24,316
I like your straightforward character.

163
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,944
Omitsu.

164
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,785
Elope with me.

165
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,162
I love you.

166
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,538
Please, no!

167
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,333
Don't you want freedom?

168
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,880
Don't you love me?
If you do, follow me.

169
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,424
I am leaving Edo.

170
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,278
Where are you going?

171
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,871
These young men of today!

172
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,250
Impertinent. Conceited.

173
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,168
Please.

174
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,590
You don't know how upset
he's been about today's match.

175
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:34,678
- Did he tell you that?
- No, Father.

176
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,349
Only I can sense it.

177
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,316
Okaya, is it very painful?

178
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,277
It is.

179
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,530
I was lucky

180
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,659
it wasn't a sword.

181
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,204
I'm very sorry, believe me.

182
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:05,876
I was just no match for you.

183
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,547
I'm only ashamed of myself,
but I won't blame you.

184
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,552
Did you get the job?

185
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,639
Take good care of yourself.

186
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,574
And I thought he was arrogant.

187
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,369
But he's fine.

188
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,080
I never knew it.

189
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:52,297
- Kojiro visited Okaya?
- Okaya told me so himself, sir.

190
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,216
What do you suggest?

191
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,554
If he really meant to console Okaya,
he must be quite a person.

192
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm for employing him.

193
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,601
Who is better,
your Musashi or him?

194
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,563
Musashi is said to be
a peerless swordsman.

195
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,483
I must see Musashi.

196
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,612
Try to find him for me.

197
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,198
And Kojiro?

198
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,784
I'll think it over.

199
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,671
Watch it, idiot!

200
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,467
Hey, kid!

201
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:41,221
Your master's been
carving images for days.

202
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:45,433
Did he quit? Is he really a swordsman?
- None of your business!

203
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,736
Keeper, is this really an inn?

204
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,845
Master.

205
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:26,224
When will you see
the Shogun's teacher?

206
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,894
- I won't.
- Really?

207
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:32,063
Where's the letter
the monk gave you?

208
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,940
I threw it away.

209
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,192
You shouldn't have.

210
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,614
Lord Yagyu might've
recommended you to the Shogun.

211
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,324
You disgust me.

212
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,159
Why?

213
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,621
If you succeed in life, so will I.

214
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:54,544
Jotaro, is that why
you've followed me?

215
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,968
But why stay here then?

216
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:05,221
Waiting for her?

217
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,641
- Who?
- Otsu.

218
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,100
Fool!

219
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:13,647
I know you want to see her.
I'm positive.

220
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,482
- You are?
- Sure.

221
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,277
Look. This is her face.

222
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,976
Why? Please.

223
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,770
Why not?

224
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,440
No. Don't.

225
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,403
You mustn't.

226
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:36,813
Yes, I want to see her.
But she'll refuse to see me.

227
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,025
Why?

228
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,154
I did something shameful to her.

229
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,417
Fight! Fight!

230
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,754
It's four to one.

231
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,798
And he's winning!

232
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,264
I'm not finished yet!

233
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,035
What skill!

234
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,204
Where is he?

235
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:38,208
Samurai, he posted a declaration.

236
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:46,508
<i>These four men are students
of the Obana Strategic School.</i>

237
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:52,138
<i>The one responsible for killing them
is Kojiro Sasaki of Isaragozaka.</i>

238
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,895
I appreciate

239
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,066
your kind deed.

240
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,945
However, Miyamoto,

241
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,323
the bodies you brought

242
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,828
have nothing to do with my school.

243
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:20,375
But it's said that they drew
when he slandered you.

244
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,335
Please.

245
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:26,840
No student of mine
could be so weak.

246
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,551
You call me a meddler, then?

247
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:34,180
Miyamoto, this school

248
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:37,851
is an honorable school
that has served the Shogun.

249
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:44,149
My 100 students
are accomplished men.

250
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,777
I see.

251
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:52,198
Forgive my rudeness
for bringing the corpses.

252
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,541
Please, wait a minute.

253
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,126
Let me pass.

254
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:09,465
Master Obana told me
they could not be his men.

255
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,469
Do not be offended.
Please give them up to us.

256
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:17,724
I will not.
The dead men won't like it.

257
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:24,105
Fortunately, I know several sutras.
I'll bury them myself.

258
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,816
I learned a lesson today.

259
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:45,501
HERE LIE FOUR UNKNOWN SAMURAI

260
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,066
So it is you.

261
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,945
I thought it was one of them.

262
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,951
Thank you for your help last year.

263
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,539
You fought marvelously
at Ichijoji Temple.

264
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,457
I witnessed it.

265
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:11,421
I learned of your ability today
for the first time.

266
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:18,720
Those four.
One stroke each.

267
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,014
Duel me.

268
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:29,856
Kid. Go away for a while.

269
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,568
Be calm no matter what you see.

270
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:47,415
I've always wanted to meet you.

271
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,627
- Ready?
- Stop.

272
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:56,090
- Are you afraid?
- No, but today's not the day.

273
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,550
What?

274
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,135
Elsewhere.

275
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,679
If we fight here,

276
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:05,558
they may say I fought
for the Obana School,

277
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,895
which is not true.

278
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:14,442
Let us set a proper time
and fight freely.

279
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,031
You're right.

280
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:25,286
Tomorrow evening,
I'll be at the East Gate. Understood?

281
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,872
Very good.

282
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:23,928
You've been evading me.
Are you scared of me?

283
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,596
No.

284
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:29,809
However, I won't elope with you.

285
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,481
You think I'm joking?

286
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,568
You meant it.

287
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,197
You're a darling.

288
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,116
I meant it.

289
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,910
But I've changed my mind.

290
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,788
- Why?
- Tomorrow night you'll know.

291
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,167
I'll succeed or die.

292
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,544
You won't be seeing me either way.

293
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,808
If I win, I'll seek larger fortunes.

294
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:17,273
If I lose, I'll be dead.

295
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,277
In either case,

296
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:26,782
you'll always remember me
as your lover.

297
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,250
<i>His Lordship.</i>

298
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:59,232
- What was it?
- Well, he was delighted.

299
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,485
He wants to hire Kojiro
as his teacher.

300
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,487
That's wonderful.

301
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,658
Kojiro did something bold.
Where is he?

302
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,785
I'll bring him here.

303
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:19,126
- You've returned?
- I bring good news!

304
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,088
Come in.

305
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:34,308
My Master heard about you
and Obana's students.

306
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:38,771
Please.
They were just weaklings.

307
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,940
It brought me no credit.

308
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:46,195
However, their master
is the Lord Shogun's teacher.

309
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:49,282
Vengeance will be sought.

310
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,785
- I'll fight.
- Listen to me.

311
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,789
You are too full of youthful vigor.

312
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:02,753
"Such personal feuds must be stopped,"
my master said.

313
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:07,883
He suddenly decided to employ you.

314
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,763
Well? If you become
Lord Hosokawa's teacher,

315
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:15,808
they dare not attack you.

316
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,893
- I decline.
- What?

317
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,396
I dislike seeking protection.

318
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,898
Don't be silly.

319
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:26,027
If the Obana School challenges you,

320
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:29,655
you can fight
as Lord Hosokawa's teacher.

321
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,074
It's not like you to decline.

322
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,659
Another thing.

323
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:36,829
Chief Retainer Sado
is recommending Musashi.

324
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,458
Musashi?

325
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,294
He's being sought quietly.

326
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:47,423
We must decide this
before they find him.

327
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:51,719
Taking the initiative
is always advantageous.

328
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:56,515
Listen.
I duel with Musashi tomorrow.

329
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,726
What! With him?

330
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,395
So your worries are over.

331
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,778
This man's dreams are too grand.

332
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,113
Place your bets!

333
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,824
Game!

334
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,638
What noise!

335
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,976
Hey, be quiet!

336
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,148
Thanks.

337
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,494
They got quiet.

338
00:33:58,829 --> 00:34:02,289
You're persuasive.
- Sure!

339
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,883
Excuse me.

340
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,727
Hey, ronin.

341
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,729
Stop eating.

342
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,149
Admit you're scared.

343
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:31,777
Don't pretend you're calm at heart.

344
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,448
Stop!

345
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,493
Who are you?

346
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,495
Don't know me?

347
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:47,209
Those who don't know me here,
must be deaf.

348
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:52,965
Speak loudly,
as I'm hard of hearing.

349
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,718
Who are you?
- Shut up!

350
00:34:56,636 --> 00:35:01,182
I'm Kumagoro the horse-dealer,
a real tough guy.

351
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,976
And when I say tough,
I mean tough.

352
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,020
Horse-dealer, eh?

353
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:11,317
I deal with samurai.
I handle live horses, mind you.

354
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,152
So what?

355
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,905
You sent this kid to me

356
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:20,034
to tell me to be quiet, didn't you?

357
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,661
<i>I have a big voice.</i>

358
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:26,457
<i>You don't own this inn, do you?</i>

359
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,253
- So what?
- Apologize.

360
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:35,174
Write a letter of apology
addressed to us all.

361
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:39,887
Or I'll take you out in the yard
and wash your face with horse piss.

362
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,765
- Amusing.
- What?

363
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,433
Very interesting indeed.

364
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:49,563
Don't talk back to me!
Now answer me at once!

365
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:53,192
Depending on how you answer,
you could get this!

366
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,784
Let's see, what shall I do?

367
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,615
There are too many.

368
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,450
Wash these sticks.

369
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:59,800
He's terrific!

370
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,818
Training for revenge?

371
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,740
I'm his pupil now.
Musashi Miyamoto! No wonder!

372
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:27,703
- Are you out of your head?
- Of course not!

373
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:34,793
Horse-dealer.
Did you say Musashi?

374
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,175
Does he live here?

375
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,558
Now I fully understand you.

376
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,479
I will not force my ideas on you.

377
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:59,568
However, will you be good enough
to see my Master?

378
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,782
But I am to fight a duel tonight.

379
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,533
A duel?

380
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,995
It will be the most memorable fight
of my life.

381
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,914
Who's your man?

382
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,625
- Kojiro Sasaki.
- Sasaki?

383
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,253
- Is that true?
- Yes.

384
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:23,676
In fact, Sasaki has been referred
to my colleague Iwaoka

385
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,595
and is to meet my master
either today or tomorrow.

386
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,764
What? Kojiro?

387
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:34,061
Miyamoto, if you win,

388
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:38,941
do not fail to accept my offer.

389
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,077
Must you fight?

390
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,621
Hey, kid.
Where is Musashi?

391
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:51,680
<i>I have decided
to leave on a journey.</i>

392
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:56,977
<i>Let me please postpone
the promised match for a year.</i>

393
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,606
<i>When we meet again,</i>

394
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,194
<i>I will be quite ready to vie with you.</i>

395
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,404
<i>Musashi Miyamoto.</i>

396
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,224
Why do you cry?

397
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,017
I don't like it.

398
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:40,729
That Kojiro
as Hosokawa's teacher!

399
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,317
I dreamt of worldly success once.

400
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:49,822
I thought it was natural
to settle down.

401
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,575
But now I want
to train myself further.

402
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,694
Jotaro.

403
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:33,198
I'm hungry.
Let's eat, shall we?

404
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,868
- Kuma.
- What?

405
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,619
I was here before you, wasn't I?

406
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:40,539
Yes, that's right.

407
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,749
Call me Master Jotaro.

408
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:47,921
I say, Master Jotaro.

409
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,548
What is it?

410
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,968
A man should be kind
to those who follow him.

411
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,764
It's time for lunch, isn't it?

412
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,522
Get down!

413
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,342
- Drop the reins.
- Or we'll shoot.

414
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:40,807
Surrender your swords.

415
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:55,364
Step back.

416
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:31,650
How did you make it here safely?

417
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,861
- We met bandits.
- Nothing happened?

418
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,781
We won a horse.

419
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,828
Do they appear often?

420
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:46,331
More than often, sir.
They're ruining us.

421
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,961
They steal our crops,
they steal our women.

422
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,964
We're completely at their mercy.

423
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,801
Many have left the village
for safety.

424
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,512
Imagine.
They won a horse!

425
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,597
Isn't that something?

426
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:09,604
Do you have an ax
to cut down trees?

427
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,250
Master.

428
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:31,626
Why are we felling trees?

429
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,754
To build a hut.

430
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,006
What for, Master?

431
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,384
- We'll live here.
- Here?

432
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,011
And plow.

433
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:44,056
What about training
for sword fighting?

434
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:48,769
As we plow, we will learn
the way of the sword.

435
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,520
Let's get to it.

436
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,425
Welcome!

437
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,643
Hurry up, will you, girls?

438
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,771
They'll be angry. Hurry!

439
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:36,441
They seem like rich people.
We'll get rich!

440
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,110
Hurry, hurry.

441
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,820
Oh, really?

442
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:44,241
The keeper will get rich.
And we'll get thinner.

443
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,368
The greedy pimp!

444
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,621
Hurry up!

445
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,418
Hanagiri, are you free?

446
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:55,836
Let me have a moment.

447
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,215
We're short one girl
for five customers. Hanagiri!

448
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,722
Keeper.

449
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,392
Do all your girls wear bells?

450
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,979
No, sir, she's the only one.

451
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,898
Jingles around like a kitten.

452
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,110
Hanagiri, you say?

453
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,362
Bring her at once.

454
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,326
You have a sharp ear.

455
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,162
Reminded of someone?

456
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:34,166
You win.
We'll stick to drinks then.

457
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,880
She's here. Come in.

458
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,344
Hanagiri.

459
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,809
So it is you.

460
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:07,949
You're mocking me, aren't you?

461
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,579
I'm not that heartless.

462
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,707
I know you.
You're worse than that.

463
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,959
I didn't even touch you.

464
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,420
Because of your vanity.

465
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:24,799
Had I not loved him,
you would have.

466
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,802
Probably.

467
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,888
Come here and serve us drinks.

468
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,936
This girl cares deeply for Musashi.

469
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,023
Unrequited love.

470
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,984
See her now.

471
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:44,986
Stop!

472
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:53,620
I may be soiled,
but my heart is pure.

473
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,415
Is it?

474
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,335
I'll tell you where he is now.

475
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:06,633
He plows at Hoten Field
in Shimosa.

476
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:09,803
Care to go?

477
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:14,307
Please don't kid around, sir.
If she leaves, I'll suffer a big loss.

478
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:15,517
Keeper.

479
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:19,980
Is this enough?

480
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,843
Just a farmer.

481
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,314
- A woman?
- What?

482
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,734
Stop!

483
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:18,455
What a find!

484
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,666
Stop!

485
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,710
I saw her first, didn't I?

486
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,887
Somebody, help!

487
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:38,808
A girl.

488
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,895
Damn, it's those bandits again.
Let's go!

489
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,193
Help!

490
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,553
Why, Otsu!

491
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,473
Why, Jotaro!

492
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,479
More loot.

493
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,319
Master!

494
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:36,324
- What, is it time to eat?
- Big news! Otsu came!

495
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,868
Otsu?

496
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,246
Lord Yagyu of Edo told her,
she says.

497
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,998
They already know that you live here.

498
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:48,044
Bring me something to wear.

499
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:52,799
She's washing her face now
to make herself presentable.

500
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,843
Will you hurry?

501
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,232
I missed you.

502
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,153
I thought you were mad at me.

503
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,572
But why?

504
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:05,413
I was to blame.

505
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,044
It was sudden, so -

506
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,464
You forgive me?

507
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:20,386
I won't leave you again.

508
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:28,061
That's the hut we built.

509
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,773
We three live in it.

510
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:37,487
And we've tilled those patches of land.

511
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,198
It was barren.

512
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:44,619
But it's yielding crops lately
thanks to our labor.

513
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:50,834
In the old days,
I used to hate farm work.

514
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,838
I was always daydreaming,

515
00:52:56,632 --> 00:53:00,802
longing for victory and renown.

516
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,222
I could think of nothing else.

517
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,142
Now I'm tilling the fields again.

518
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:11,646
Isn't it strange?

519
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:16,484
I'm beginning to learn
the value of life.

520
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,155
The soil has taught me that.

521
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:34,335
Jotaro.

522
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,382
Cook something for Otsu.

523
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:42,218
I'll ask Old Gen to house her.

524
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:49,183
Otsu, aren't you happy
to see him again?

525
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:54,856
He's still upset with me.

526
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,692
What happened?

527
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,205
- Listen, Jotaro.
- Master Jotaro.

528
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,166
Yes, sir.

529
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,002
I don't understand him at all.

530
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,587
Me neither.

531
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,548
He's started carving again.

532
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:55,393
He told me he'd done
something bad to her.

533
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,311
It can't be true.

534
00:55:57,396 --> 00:56:01,691
If that were so,
why would she come here?

535
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,484
You're right.

536
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:07,739
Who goes there?

537
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:31,405
I hate to leave the village.

538
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,990
I'll stick by it,

539
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:36,327
even if I may be killed
on account of it.

540
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,497
Please, sir,
teach us how to fight.

541
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:43,042
We must drive the bandits
away from here!

542
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,795
Please, Master!

543
00:57:48,257 --> 00:57:51,884
It's no use teaching you
how to fight.

544
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:56,430
You must learn to run.

545
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,267
Run away from them, sir?

546
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,769
Lose today, win tomorrow.

547
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:06,691
You're going there by yourself?

548
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:09,193
Yes. I made it here alone.

549
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:11,529
But It's dangerous from here on.

550
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:16,659
The way to the next village
is infested with bandits.

551
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,788
I've been around bandits
since I was a child.

552
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:24,834
My father was a bandit, too.

553
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,380
Isn't my lunch ready yet?

554
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:30,798
It is.

555
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:34,594
It's best you disguise yourself as a man.

556
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,096
They'll stop any girl.

557
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:43,227
Men have already
made a plaything of me.

558
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:45,062
I don't mind anything now.

559
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:52,486
If I can see him,
I'll die content.

560
00:58:58,202 --> 00:58:59,744
One moment.

561
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:03,789
Men come here regularly
to buy oil and salt.

562
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:07,919
Wait till then
and go with them.

563
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:10,338
A good idea.

564
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,300
That may be them.

565
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,848
Give us drinks!

566
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:33,611
It's been bad since
those ronin got here.

567
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:37,281
I hear they're teaching them
how to wield a sword.

568
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:39,033
Who are they?

569
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:43,204
We've got to
destroy them, anyway.

570
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,583
This is too small.

571
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,628
Bring bigger bowls!

572
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:54,382
Keeper.

573
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,467
That your daughter?

574
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,843
No.

575
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:01,222
Hey, girlie! Come here!

576
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,435
What are you doing?

577
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:16,404
Why, it's Akemi.

578
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,032
Toji.

579
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:23,202
Yes, it's me.

580
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,912
Know her?

581
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:27,164
She's Oko's daughter.

582
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,001
I see.

583
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:32,920
What happened to my mother?

584
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:35,840
Where is she?

585
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:37,258
I killed her.

586
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:45,099
Toji, you were there
when she was killed!

587
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,769
You joined up with them
to save your own skin!

588
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:49,979
Shut up!

589
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:54,025
I was avenging my brother's death.
- Your brother?

590
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:56,777
Your mother and a man
killed my brother, Temma Tsujikaze.

591
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,196
I'm Kohei Tsujikaze
- What are you talking about?

592
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:02,199
It was the two of you
who killed my father!

593
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:03,617
I'll do the same to you.

594
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,642
There. That's the village.

595
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:36,233
Tell them the bandits
were all arrested by the officials.

596
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:37,818
Understand?

597
01:01:39,488 --> 01:01:42,907
And tomorrow evening,
you set fire to Musashi's hut.

598
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:46,952
That's when we'll attack. Got it?

599
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,956
That's horrible.
I can't do it.

600
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,084
Don't be a fool!

601
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:58,923
Musashi is Kohei's enemy.
He's mine as well.

602
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:03,677
Kohei spared your life.
You must do it.

603
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:07,890
If you don't,

604
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,477
I'll have to kill you.

605
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:37,837
Don't. You're still sick.

606
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:42,091
But I can't stay idle here.

607
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,717
Stop!

608
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,723
Tell me.

609
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,018
Tell me what to do now.

610
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:56,313
Must I leave?

611
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,023
Well, no.

612
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,651
Tell me then.

613
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,737
Why do you evade me?

614
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:07,867
Do you dislike me?
Do you hate me?

615
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:12,913
Have I been erased
from your heart?

616
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,249
Please!

617
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:20,129
You're hard-hearted, unfeeling.

618
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,173
I hate it!

619
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:24,049
But -

620
01:03:25,177 --> 01:03:27,094
I can't go on living!

621
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:33,601
I wish I were dead!

622
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:35,895
Don't be foolish.

623
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:41,609
I am foolish!
Watch what a foolish girl does!

624
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,615
Stop!

625
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:56,415
What are you doing?

626
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:14,433
So, she's here.

627
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:38,290
This is because of her.
That dame!

628
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,751
I'm sorry.

629
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:45,089
Old Gen can accommodate
another person.

630
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,134
Otsu won't like it.

631
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,512
Neither will Akemi.

632
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,849
I think I'll go ask Aunt Oseki.

633
01:04:55,934 --> 01:04:58,978
- I'll do that for you.
- Me, too.

634
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:35,139
At last we're alone.

635
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,229
Why don't you like it?

636
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:46,025
You've changed, Akemi.

637
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:49,903
You do remember me.
I'm so glad.

638
01:05:50,739 --> 01:05:55,659
Takezo, I've loved you
since we lived in the hills.

639
01:05:55,744 --> 01:05:57,828
I really cared for you.

640
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:59,496
You don't mean that.

641
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,665
But I do mean it.

642
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:06,754
That's what I tried to tell you
when you were trapped at Ichijoji.

643
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:10,257
I didn't understand then.

644
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:14,511
Takezo, let's go away together.

645
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:16,930
Won't you?
- Stop it.

646
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:24,980
Oko, your mother,
asked me to do that once.

647
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:28,734
Her blood runs in your veins.

648
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:33,489
No, I'm not like her.

649
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:35,449
Not at all.

650
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:42,247
I never loved a man
till I met you.

651
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:48,379
I've never loved anyone but you.

652
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:50,547
That's why I came here.

653
01:07:10,068 --> 01:07:11,819
I'm sorry.

654
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:18,992
It's not your fault.

655
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:24,415
You have Otsu.

656
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,377
I shouldn't be unreasonable.

657
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:39,888
I will leave in the morning.

658
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:44,852
Be happy with her.

659
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:47,521
Take care.

660
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,541
Takezo.

661
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,711
It's so hard.

662
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,799
But I'll give you up.

663
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:17,551
I promise.

664
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:21,388
Just hold me tightly before I go.

665
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:28,645
Crush me to death in your arms.

666
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:34,067
That's all I ask, then I'll give up.

667
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,264
Men!

668
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:10,145
I heard on my way here that
all the bandits were arrested.

669
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,815
- Really?
- Yes.

670
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,322
The whole town's talking.

671
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:24,201
If they've been arrested,
we're safe.

672
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,912
Now we can finally relax.

673
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,380
Akemi said that?

674
01:09:36,464 --> 01:09:39,758
- Serves 'em right.
- Now we're saved.

675
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:48,934
Akemi, are you sure
about the bandits?

676
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:54,398
Akemi!

677
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:56,233
Is it true?

678
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,988
You wouldn't believe me.

679
01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:08,370
I'll stay here for a while.
I like it here.

680
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:13,750
Master, did you hear it?

681
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:15,836
Very good news, eh?

682
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:20,924
Old Gen, did you hear?

683
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:24,845
Yes, I did.

684
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:29,516
Let's stop work and celebrate!

685
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:46,450
<i>When the sun rises, let's work
When the sun sets, let's relax</i>

686
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:53,457
<i>Heave-ho, hey, hey
Heave-ho, hey, hey</i>

687
01:10:53,541 --> 01:11:00,464
<i>Let's dig a well and drink the water
Plow a field and eat the crops</i>

688
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:07,512
<i>Heave-ho, hey, hey
Heave-ho, hey, hey</i>

689
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:14,561
<i>Not even birds would visit our village
But we live here and it's our heaven</i>

690
01:11:14,646 --> 01:11:21,443
<i>Heave-ho, hey, hey
Heave-ho, hey, hey</i>

691
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:29,701
<i>For a thousand years and forever
May our rice fields give us food</i>

692
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,877
She'll signal to us with a fire.

693
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:41,213
You set the houses on fire!

694
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,257
You kill the villagers.

695
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,844
Don't take on Musashi.

696
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:49,930
I'll handle him.

697
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:06,405
You and I need to talk, and alone.

698
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,709
Let's have a drink.

699
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:25,298
Where's Otsu?

700
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:29,636
- She's at my house.
- She can play the flute.

701
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:31,138
Good idea.

702
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,056
I'll fetch her.

703
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:40,063
Otsu.

704
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,566
You're a woman, too.

705
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,735
You should know
what a woman feels.

706
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,404
I'm in love with him.

707
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:50,240
Akemi.

708
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:54,911
You're terrible.

709
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:59,875
Why must you come
between the two of us?

710
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,793
Otsu.

711
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:13,472
Take it up.

712
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:17,851
If you want him, fight!

713
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:20,854
How horrible!

714
01:13:21,355 --> 01:13:24,191
Take it up.
Here I come!

715
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,680
Help! Somebody!

716
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,649
Fire!

717
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,583
Go!

718
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,183
Bring water!

719
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:43,186
Bandits! Bandits!

720
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:56,283
Calm down! Quiet!

721
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:58,785
Take the women and children
to Old Gen's.

722
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,657
Musashi Miyamoto!
Come out!

723
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:39,743
Fight me!

724
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:51,046
Musashi! I'm here to avenge
my brother's death!

725
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,186
Run!

726
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:09,189
Bastards!

727
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,612
Kuma!

728
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,197
Bastard!

729
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:18,907
Damn kid!

730
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,119
Hold on, Kuma.

731
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:27,624
Jotaro, you're...

732
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:30,043
truly my master.

733
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:44,766
Akemi!

734
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:48,228
Well done!

735
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,653
What are you doing?

736
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:29,936
Akemi! Hold on!

737
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:34,607
Otsu.

738
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:37,777
I'm dying now.

739
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:43,616
I've been so wicked.

740
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:45,035
Oh, no!

741
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:48,580
You saved my life.

742
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:52,250
Don't die, Akemi.

743
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:58,465
Akemi.

744
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:05,263
Takezo.

745
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,142
At last

746
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:15,857
you hold me in your arms.

747
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:18,902
Hold on, Akemi.

748
01:18:20,488 --> 01:18:23,782
It's all over for me.

749
01:18:26,577 --> 01:18:32,374
I can't even see you.

750
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:44,677
Be happy together,

751
01:18:46,263 --> 01:18:48,431
you two.

752
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:45,488
Musashi!

753
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:47,991
Where is Master Musashi?

754
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:13,683
<i>I have been officially engaged
as Lord Hosokawa's teacher</i>

755
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:17,353
<i>and will leave for Kokura,
his Castle Town.</i>

756
01:20:17,438 --> 01:20:21,608
<i>I am desirous to have our match</i>

757
01:20:21,692 --> 01:20:25,528
<i>at Kokura, April next.</i>

758
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:13,201
My Master's so unreasonable
to leave you like this.

759
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:20,500
After all, his heart has chosen
the way of the sword.

760
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:40,353
KOKURA TOWN

761
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:53,366
"By permission of Our Lord,
Retainer Kojiro Sasaki will duel

762
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:57,912
with Musashi Miyamoto
of Mimasaku Province."

763
01:21:57,997 --> 01:21:59,455
Musashi.

764
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:02,333
In five days, eh?

765
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:09,132
Fight fair and square,
like a true samurai.

766
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:14,012
He is a peerless match, sir.

767
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,765
I will not spoil
your honorable name.

768
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:20,518
In four days.

769
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:22,562
I can hardly wait.

770
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,440
He's busy.

771
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:30,194
But I'm his childhood friend.
An intimate friend.

772
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:33,156
I was with him
at the school of Master Ito.

773
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,242
I'm Ichinomiya from Yamazaki Dojo.
He'll know who I am.

774
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:38,661
Please, calm down!

775
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:51,633
They ignored me
while I was a ronin.

776
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:57,930
But today even strangers
want to meet me.

777
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,769
Such is life.

778
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:06,773
But that's something to rejoice over.

779
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:11,653
Your prowess will be
acknowledged, definitely.

780
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:18,117
And after the match,
another big event.

781
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:19,786
Another big event?

782
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,623
My daughter is impatient.

783
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:37,261
Don't go, Otsu!
Let me find my Master.

784
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:41,933
Please.
Why have I come all this way?

785
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:47,730
In this match
he might meet the worst fate.

786
01:23:49,650 --> 01:23:54,153
If so, I'll gather his remains.

787
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:59,492
So I must see him.

788
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:01,703
I must speak to him!

789
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,914
All right.

790
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:43,202
Out of the way!

791
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,501
From Musashi, sir?

792
01:24:52,963 --> 01:24:57,467
"I will arrive in my own boat
at the appointed hour.

793
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:00,261
I hope this is satisfactory."

794
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:04,682
I see.

795
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:08,311
He stayed away from here
out of respect.

796
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,731
He'll go directly to the island.

797
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:16,569
But at what inn is he staying?

798
01:25:21,492 --> 01:25:23,743
Hold on, Otsu.

799
01:25:25,204 --> 01:25:26,746
What's wrong?

800
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,626
Help!

801
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:35,254
- What happened?
- She's sick.

802
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,257
Sick? Come this way.

803
01:26:05,536 --> 01:26:07,036
Omitsu.

804
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:11,207
You look pensive.

805
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:16,379
Concerned I'll be defeated?
- Oh, no.

806
01:26:16,463 --> 01:26:18,840
You may not expect it to happen,

807
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:21,425
but you're still worried.

808
01:26:24,888 --> 01:26:26,889
I'll defeat Musashi.

809
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:31,185
That has long been my ambition.

810
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:39,610
I'll defeat him
through my own ability.

811
01:26:42,072 --> 01:26:47,159
The prayers of those
who wish me victory and talismans

812
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:49,495
are useless to me.

813
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:54,584
Therefore, do not pray for me.

814
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:04,343
Affection and attachments
disturb my inner tranquillity.

815
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:08,264
I want to fight alone.

816
01:27:28,619 --> 01:27:30,703
Return to the castle.

817
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:42,715
Now I feel relieved.

818
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:14,705
- Hey, Sasuke. Is it ready?
- Sure.

819
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:20,378
It's an honor for a boatman
to row for Master Musashi.

820
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:22,880
The boat's been purified.

821
01:28:22,965 --> 01:28:24,882
Good.

822
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:26,801
He's ready to depart.

823
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:36,936
Thank you for the kind gift
I wear now.

824
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,647
I feel so refreshed.

825
01:28:39,731 --> 01:28:42,274
Good luck, sir.

826
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:45,695
One moment.

827
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:50,199
I want you to see someone
before you leave.

828
01:28:50,283 --> 01:28:51,784
Me?

829
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:54,996
Don't bother to get up.

830
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:04,880
Otsu!

831
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:11,095
I can't see him like this.

832
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:19,603
Master!

833
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,830
Don't come in!

834
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:41,167
I'm coming!

835
01:30:15,202 --> 01:30:16,744
Otsu.

836
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:19,997
At last we meet again.

837
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:25,920
You look weak. Are you very ill?

838
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:28,380
I'm cured now.

839
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:32,927
My illness is so whimsical,
you know.

840
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:41,143
Otsu, let's take a walk,
shall we?

841
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:48,818
This is the first time
you ever asked me.

842
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:54,031
Of course I'll go with you.

843
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:25,229
Until today
I've walked my own way

844
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:28,649
and made you suffer a lot.

845
01:31:30,193 --> 01:31:31,986
Forgive me.

846
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:36,574
But I'm not as heartless
as I may seem.

847
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:40,619
- I know.
- You do?

848
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:44,748
That's why I've loved you.

849
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:50,504
Otsu!

850
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:58,262
What an auspicious day.

851
01:31:58,555 --> 01:32:01,807
I can fight
with a clear conscience now.

852
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:06,353
Why do you cry?

853
01:32:07,731 --> 01:32:08,898
I hate samurai.

854
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:16,113
I wish you were still the Takezo
who I used to know.

855
01:32:25,832 --> 01:32:29,919
Musashi, abandon your sword.

856
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:32,463
Don't fight!

857
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,716
Let them call you a coward!

858
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,719
I long for happiness,
just us two together.

859
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:40,429
Otsu.

860
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:42,890
That's impossible now.

861
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:46,518
Please!

862
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:49,438
I won't let you go.

863
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:51,190
I won't.

864
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:54,151
Don't be unreasonable.

865
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:57,863
I'm a woman.

866
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:03,410
I wish you had been
an ordinary man.

867
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:08,290
Otsu, don't demoralize me, please.

868
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:13,045
A samurai's wife sends off
her man with a smile.

869
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:20,052
Especially when it might be
for the last time.

870
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:27,893
Of course.

871
01:35:30,642 --> 01:35:32,643
Is that Funa Island?

872
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:35,562
No, sir, that's Hiko Island.

873
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:39,525
Funa Island lies beyond that.
It's a smaller one.

874
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:44,029
Isn't this where a sea battle
was fought in olden times?

875
01:35:44,114 --> 01:35:45,114
Yes.

876
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,787
What's that for, sir?

877
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:54,373
For the duel.

878
01:35:56,876 --> 01:35:59,086
You'll fight with a wooden one?

879
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:00,838
I like the size.

880
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:03,674
Listen.

881
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:08,470
If I lose and fall,

882
01:36:08,555 --> 01:36:11,473
take my dead body back

883
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:14,059
to Otsu.

884
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:18,105
Dear God. Don't say that.

885
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:20,649
Take this as a memento of me.

886
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:34,413
Musashi's boat is sighted!

887
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:45,174
- Musashi is coming!
- Musashi has come!

888
01:36:53,975 --> 01:36:56,477
Don't be nervous.

889
01:36:57,604 --> 01:37:01,106
You'll see the mysterious
power of my sword.

890
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:04,985
Watch me.

891
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:31,613
Musashi!

892
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:48,411
Mr. Miyamoto.

893
01:42:49,455 --> 01:42:51,414
That was splendid.

894
01:42:53,251 --> 01:42:59,214
He was the best swordsman
I will ever encounter.

895
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:47,012
I'm so glad.

896
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,472
I'm so glad!

897
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:56,062
I was praying I wouldn't bring
Master Musashi back dead.

898
01:43:57,106 --> 01:44:01,943
I'm so glad about it all.
I'm so happy!

899
01:44:32,391 --> 01:44:41,399
THE END
