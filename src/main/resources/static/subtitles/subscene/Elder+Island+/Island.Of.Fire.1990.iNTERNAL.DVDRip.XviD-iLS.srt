1
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,318
Andrew!

2
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,395
I missed you so much!

3
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,198
Hey, everyone's looking.

4
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,236
Let them look.

5
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,799
OK, let's go.

6
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,273
- Welcome back, Andy.
- Thanks.

7
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,635
To your good health, Professor.

8
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,311
I had you transferred from Hong Kong,
because I need your help on a case.

9
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,393
It might involve a high ranking
officer in the police department.

10
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,712
I need someone with a new face
to go undercover.

11
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,268
- You'll be reporting to Jerry.
- OK.

12
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,511
Papa, stop talking business
and start eating,

13
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,433
or all the food will go to waste.

14
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,388
All right, we'll discuss this
tomorrow. Come on now, dig in.

15
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,833
Yes, sir.

16
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,033
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,350
He's only been home a few hours

18
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,954
and already you're trying
to get him drunk.

19
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,870
Sally cares about you.

20
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,674
I should be the one
proposing the toast.

21
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,914
I used to just hang around here
until Jerry sent me to reform school.

22
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,678
Then the Professor helped me and sent
me to study at the police academy.

23
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,311
If it wasn't for you two,
I wouldn't be here today.

24
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,279
To both of you. Thank you, sir.

25
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,352
- Shall I walk you to your car?
- No, thanks. It's just there.

26
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,351
- Good night, Professor.
- Good night, Jerry.

27
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,432
I'll take Andy back to his hotel.
You get to bed.

28
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,196
Good night, Professor. I'll see you
tomorrow. I'd better get going.

29
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,394
You'd better get back
and get some rest. Come on.

30
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,078
All right.

31
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,469
Who's visiting the Professor
so late?

32
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,238
Hold it!

33
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,192
"Fingerprint of Suspect"

34
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,350
"Fingerprint Number:"

35
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,878
"Match Number:"

36
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,189
"Carl Chan,
executed January 10th, 1987."

37
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,873
Strange, how could our murderer
have been executed three months ago?

38
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,953
How could this be, Jerry?

39
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,235
It was a well-planned hit.

40
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,750
Using a supposed dead man
to commit a murder.

41
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,479
Either someone's been messing
with the computer,

42
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,994
or there's something up at the jail.

43
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,396
Don't dwell on it, Andy.

44
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,638
I'm OK. You go home if you want.

45
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,154
I want to be alone for a while.

46
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,478
OK, then.

47
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,798
I'll head off, then. Bye. See you.

48
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,710
Give me some stuff, Ronnie.

49
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,109
- Got the money?
- It's all gone.

50
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,033
That's bullshit!
Sell your body, then.

51
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,078
- I can't stand it!
- Get lost!

52
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,592
Boss, someone's looking at you.

53
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,432
What are you looking at?

54
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,996
Do you think it's worth it?

55
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,710
We've checked it out.
The computer is secure.

56
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,469
The prison is our only clue.
I've got to do it.

57
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,438
You might get killed.

58
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,430
I'll take the risk.

59
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,675
And what about Sally?

60
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,197
Don't tell her anything
until I've finished this case.

61
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,069
I won't. But assault
and battery is serious.

62
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,913
You'll be in for two years.

63
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,275
For your safety in prison,

64
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,797
no one can know who you are,
apart from you and me.

65
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,110
Operation - Hunter.

66
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,873
Take these.
I'll inform you of the rules here.

67
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,476
On your clothing is a number - forget
it and it's ten days in the hole.

68
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,391
Fighting is on Saturday afternoons.

69
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,472
Any unsupervised fighting -
ten days in the hole.

70
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,030
First bell rings at 7:55,
second bell rings at 8:00.

71
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,237
Never go against the officers.
Never try to escape.

72
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,357
No raping other inmates.
No breaking of fixtures.

73
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,829
Six months hard labor
for these offences.

74
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,230
If you smoke in bed,
it's ten days in the hole.

75
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,959
Every Saturday,
you'll receive one clean sheet.

76
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,393
Change the bottom one.

77
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,637
If you get it wrong -
ten days in the hole.

78
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,999
You'll memorize these rules. If you
forget any - ten days in the hole.

79
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,878
All right, this is your cell.

80
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,999
All right, guys. That's enough.
Now back off, all of you.

81
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,271
Sorry, that's my bed.
Yours is the lower one.

82
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,717
The last guy in that bunk
was in here for forgery.

83
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,439
He couldn't take it,
so he killed himself.

84
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,879
Hey, is this your first time in?

85
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,833
Don't be like that.
A guy needs a friend in this place.

86
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,393
Charlie.

87
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,797
I'm Andy.

88
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,397
Bed check! Hand over that cigarette!

89
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,037
- A whole cigarette - rich man!
- You scared me!

90
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,473
Who's gonna win?

91
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,553
- What are the odds?
- 20-1 he won't last 30 seconds.

92
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,989
What's going on, Charlie?

93
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,232
The new guy is fighting the prison
champ and the new guy is you!

94
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,072
And if I don't?

95
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,709
Everyone will be out for your blood.
Am I right, Charlie?

96
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,313
Yeah, that's right.

97
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,959
This way. Excuse me, thank you.

98
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,952
Hey, kid. We're all betting on you.

99
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,953
If you stay in for 30 seconds
we'll be rich.

100
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,238
Get back in there!

101
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,875
Get him!

102
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,275
There's five seconds to go!

103
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,158
He's still in!

104
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,028
Get him! Get him!

105
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,952
I'll get him!

106
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,079
It's over.

107
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,355
Come on.

108
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,511
- 20453?
- Here!

109
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,194
- 15783?
- Yo!

110
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,111
- 11795?
- Yeah!

111
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,870
- A letter from your son?
- His mother remarried.

112
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,478
She sent Joey to a boarding school.
His birthday's in two days.

113
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,711
But she's on her honeymoon
with her new husband.

114
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,839
Boarding school's not so bad -
it makes a kid more independent.

115
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,317
I've some fresh meat in the kitchen.
Shall I cook it for you?

116
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,439
It would go well with your wine.
Would you like some?

117
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,476
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,154
Bill, open the gate.

119
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,839
Thanks.

120
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,749
Hey, cap,
are you going to be a cop forever?

121
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,239
Why do you ask?

122
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,598
Well, if you ever open a restaurant,
I'll be your cook.

123
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,910
What a laugh!

124
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,074
Who's laughing? Don't blame me
when all you have to eat is dog meat.

125
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,079
Hey! What's there to know?

126
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,991
Plenty! I'll show you.

127
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,359
Fry the onion.

128
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,110
Add the meat.

129
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,673
Hold this.

130
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,159
Hey!

131
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,313
You got a light?

132
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,076
Thanks a lot.

133
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,351
It's almost New Year again.
I hope I'm not working this holiday.

134
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,557
My wife will run off
with another man.

135
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,037
What's up with you?

136
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,510
On my salary,
I can't even afford new shoes.

137
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,595
Get out, come on.
I've got to check the car.

138
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,317
What is it, officer?

139
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,152
Doesn't your mother feed you?

140
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,196
She's thinner than I am.

141
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,999
What's going on?

142
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,354
This is all your fault.

143
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,230
It's mine! It's mine!
Get the ball, Joey!

144
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,399
- Joey.
- Papa!

145
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,877
Headquarters,
we've located the stolen car.

146
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,509
We're outside the Lawrence
boarding school. Requesting back-up.

147
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,953
Headquarters -

148
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,715
we've located the prisoner,
requesting immediate back-up.

149
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,512
Listen to your teachers.
I'll visit again soon.

150
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,192
Do you promise?

151
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,271
OK.

152
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,151
Papa loves you always.

153
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,559
Now go back to school.
Your teachers will miss you.

154
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,790
But I don't want to.

155
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,872
Listen to Papa.
Run inside and don't look back.

156
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,678
Why not?

157
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:20,471
If you do I'll turn into stone. Now
on you go or you won't see me again.

158
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,835
Promise you'll come visit
on New Years'?

159
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,678
I'll count to three and you go in.
One, two, three!

160
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,275
Don't move! Hands up!

161
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,550
Heaven's up there. I'm here.
Then come the dogs.

162
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,634
You're worse than a dog.

163
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,518
Don't go against me again.

164
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,514
Apologize! Go on!

165
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,431
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

166
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,268
My boss's business card.
I believe you've heard of him.

167
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,478
He'll give you half a million
to lose the championship tomorrow.

168
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,551
Be a good boy.

169
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,997
He could beat me...
if he's good enough.

170
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,398
Be a good kid and I'll guarantee you
plenty of dough.

171
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,514
- How was it?
- A great success.

172
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,833
Your shoes.

173
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,992
You know better
than to wear these with me.

174
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,708
Not bad. I've got the touch today.

175
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,192
Think about it.

176
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,673
Kiki!

177
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,629
I'm sorry. I ran all the way.
Don't be mad at me.

178
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,280
I'm so sorry, really.

179
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,556
- I'm sorry.
- I forgive you.

180
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,434
Let's grab a bite to eat.

181
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,113
So you think you're a big shot?

182
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,594
- What do you want?
- No, Kiki.

183
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,399
Let go of her!

184
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,431
Let's go.

185
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,719
Kiki!

186
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,639
Kiki!

187
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,231
Someone help!

188
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,278
Her kidney is badly damaged.

189
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,397
You'll need $200,000
to cover her bills.

190
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,031
If we don't operate now,
we may not be able to save her.

191
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,793
Where can I get it at this hour?

192
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,235
Doctor, can you do
the operation first?

193
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,710
I'm sorry. Hospital policy.
I can't help you.

194
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,631
Do what you can to raise the money.

195
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,918
I'm out!

196
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,678
What's your bet?

197
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,431
It's all I've got.

198
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,673
I call.

199
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,678
I see you. Full house. I win.

200
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,110
- See you.
- Hold it! Play a couple more.

201
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,238
I've got to go.

202
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,312
Bastard! You're a cheat!
You're a cheat!

203
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,630
Hey, my brother says you're a cheat.

204
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,272
Don't let him get away!

205
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,679
I need this money.
Don't make me do it.

206
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,273
You win.

207
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,993
Boss, telephone.

208
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,751
- Get back!
- Please cooperate. Stay back!

209
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,845
- Back!
- He's my brother.

210
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,190
- It's a police matter.
- Let me through!

211
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,193
- Who did it?
- He's in the car.

212
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,036
Boss! Boss!

213
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,194
- What are you doing?
- You! Get out here! I said out!

214
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,959
I'm going to kill you! Get out here!

215
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,715
Come back here! Come back here! OK.

216
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,479
- He killed Teddy.
- Quiet!

217
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,310
No matter where he goes, he's dead.
Come on!

218
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,116
On your clothing is a number. If you
forget it, it's ten days in the hole.

219
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,713
Fighting is on Saturday afternoons.

220
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,792
Any unsupervised fighting,
ten days in the hole.

221
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,156
First bell rings at 7:55,
second bell rings at 8:00.

222
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,118
Never go against the officers!
Never try to escape!

223
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,952
No raping of other inmates...

224
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,157
Charlie, what are the odds
for tonight?

225
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,192
No bet. Not tonight.

226
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,633
Why not?

227
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,635
That guy killed Boss Li's brother
Those other guys are in Li's gang.

228
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,550
They're in the Ghost Shadow Gang.

229
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,155
Word is they're going to kill
that guy Steve tonight.

230
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,032
Those two!

231
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,517
Let go of me! Let me at him!

232
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,074
Calm down, Steve!

233
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,072
- Let go!
- It's all right.

234
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,233
Let me go.

235
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,638
Let me go!

236
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,431
- Take him to the sickroom.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,275
Superintendent,
those guys were trying to kill Steve.

238
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,192
No way, sir. Those guys were
fighting, we tried to separate them.

239
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,748
Better tell the truth.

240
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,994
It is the truth.
He's got the knife on him.

241
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,036
- You're lying.
- No, he's not, Superintendent.

242
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,554
I can prove he's telling the truth.

243
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,631
Here's the knife they used.

244
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,393
Listen up, no screwing up
in my place.

245
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,874
- Take them in.
- Get going!

246
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,237
Write me a report.

247
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,991
You can come out now.

248
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,153
Lucas.

249
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:16,079
Don't screw up again. Going against
me is like going against God.

250
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,789
We respect our God.

251
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,316
We don't respect you.
There's no comparison.

252
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,311
You're back!

253
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,231
My brothers, never surrender!

254
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,472
Come in.

255
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,673
You asked for me, boss?

256
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,273
Sit down.

257
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,717
I hear you've been asking
about Carl Chan.

258
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,192
- Are you an informer?
- No.

259
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,316
I was looking at your hands.

260
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,358
You've got a well developed
trigger finger.

261
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,275
No one's heard of you.
So the way I see it, you're a snitch.

262
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,634
I'm not!

263
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,233
Talk! What is it with you?

264
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,318
In the service, I was selected
for the Olympic shooting competition.

265
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,680
- That's why I have strong hands.
- And Carl Chan?

266
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:12,240
We served together in the army.

267
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,880
He owes me some money.

268
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,712
You're lying.

269
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,318
Lucas! I won't yell out.
I won't get the guards after you.

270
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,317
Please, believe me.

271
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,713
Enough!

272
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,473
If you're really here to settle a
debt, Carl Chan's dead so forget it.

273
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,678
His slate is clean.
You watch what you're doing.

274
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,712
Your life is in my hands.

275
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,671
- Andy! Over here.
- Right.

276
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,193
Oh, sorry.

277
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,110
- Use your spoon.
- Yeah.

278
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,877
What's wrong with your hand?

279
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,710
I cut it in the shop.

280
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,156
Oh, yeah?
No more food till I get the truth.

281
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,152
Come get it
when you're ready to talk.

282
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,873
Thanks, Lucas, but I'm being watched.

283
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,759
- So you're great friends?
- No appetite.

284
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,315
- Bring the rice pot.
- Yes, sir.

285
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,197
Move!

286
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,994
Now let's have some fun.

287
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,670
You'd better eat it all,
or it's another ten days in the hole.

288
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,555
Lucas, save some for me.

289
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,438
You've all come here to work,
not to sunbathe!

290
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,150
I won't tolerate any goofing around.

291
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,319
If you're not able to complete the
road, there'll be no dinner tonight.

292
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,791
Officer Chang, what if we finish
early? Can we break then?

293
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,958
Finish early! And I'm a pig!

294
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,272
There's no way you'll finish early.
Now get to work!

295
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,513
Hey, friend, take it easy.
It's a long road.

296
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:11,594
You heard what he said. If we finish
early, he'll turn into a pig.

297
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,828
Hey, listen up.

298
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,317
If we finish early, somebody
will turn into a pig! Come on!

299
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,357
Come on! Come on!

300
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,950
Come on, guys. Let's move it!

301
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,319
Hurry it up!

302
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,749
Some water, sir?

303
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,910
- Are they crazy?
- I don't know.

304
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,951
OK, let's go!

305
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,278
Come on, brothers! We're almost done.

306
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,110
Are they on drugs?
They're two hours ahead of schedule.

307
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,949
Anyone here see an angry pig?

308
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,271
Get in there, hurry up.

309
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,078
Hey, did you see your son?

310
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,878
Yeah.

311
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,237
He's growing up so fast,
I hardly recognized him.

312
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,471
I promised I'd visit him
at New Years'.

313
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,875
Next time don't get caught.

314
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,919
Every time they bring you back
and they give you another year.

315
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,956
At this rate, you'll never get out.

316
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,114
One day I'll escape for good. My son
and I will sail away on a boat.

317
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,838
Where will you go?

318
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,592
The Philippines.

319
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,151
Living costs are low there.
A few dollars will get you a virgin.

320
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,109
Keep her for a month and you get a
discount, and she does the housework.

321
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,952
What do you want her for?

322
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,431
The usual stuff, you know, cooking
and cleaning... that kind of thing.

323
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,719
No wonder you want to escape. Let me
know if you get another chance.

324
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,793
A live-in maid!
Now that's good for your health.

325
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,117
Boss, sir. Glasses on.

326
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,753
She's not wearing any bra.

327
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,434
Boss, sir! Cleaning glasses.

328
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:47,030
Dear Lord, whatever I've done wrong,
please don't strike me blind now.

329
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,478
Oh, shit! I can't see anything
with these glasses.

330
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,074
Boss, sir! Taking off glasses.

331
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,750
Why don't any of you help me?

332
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,950
Hey, John! Go help her.

333
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,871
Yes, sir!

334
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,276
- Hi, miss.
- Thank you.

335
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,079
Don't mention it. It's no bother!

336
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,110
- Are you all right?
- I'm OK.

337
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,158
You can break my bones,
but don't strike me blind.

338
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,798
Don't stand there. I need you
to push the car from over there.

339
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,235
Lean against the window and rock it.

340
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,593
All right, place your bets, gentlemen
on one, two or three.

341
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,030
Hurry up, the race is about to start.

342
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,192
Come on, place your bets,
then stand back.

343
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,511
Come on, everyone,
place your bets here.

344
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,635
Come on...

345
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,996
Hey, John, how'd that girl look
up close? Was she fine?

346
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,389
She was better than fine,
she was inspiring.

347
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,552
I didn't need a jack
to change her tire.

348
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,959
Really?

349
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,598
Of course not.

350
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,514
All right, all bets in. Ready...

351
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,953
Go!

352
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,476
You bet on number two
and you lost it all.

353
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,391
Johnny, can I have just two?

354
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,199
Two? Here!

355
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,156
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

356
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,673
Li's man is out!

357
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:25,153
In here I'm the boss.
I know all about you and Boss Li.

358
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:29,028
But what happens on the outside
stays on the outside. Understand?

359
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,716
When you're in here,
it doesn't matter who you are.

360
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,316
We're all together in this.

361
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,113
I don't want any feuds in here.

362
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,034
Lucas, Boss Li's brother's dead.
It's blood for blood.

363
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,759
I'll bleed for him.

364
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,992
Andy, have you seen my mouse?

365
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,355
Maybe he's asleep
in the mattress again.

366
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,396
I'll help you look after we eat.

367
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,551
- Thanks.
- Hey, that's not enough.

368
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,672
Why?

369
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,278
Why? Why? Why did you do it?
Why did you do it to him?

370
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,193
He cooked my mouse!

371
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,872
In the hole with him.

372
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,831
Here, I got it!

373
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,877
Better keep away from him.

374
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,553
Here, take this. I'm not hungry.

375
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,795
Boss? I got to do the business.

376
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,997
Great timing!
Make sure you go downwind.

377
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,072
- Let me know where you are.
- Yes, sir.

378
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,789
Shoot.

379
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,670
I'm here! I'm here!

380
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,314
I'm still here! I'm still shitting!

381
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,676
Don't tell me that, just shake
the grass. We're eating here!

382
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,594
OK, I'm moving the grass now, boss.

383
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,593
Don't let him get away! After him!

384
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,197
Maybe we can find ourselves
a boat at dawn.

385
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,798
I heard your son broke his leg
playing football. Is he all right?

386
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,952
He's a kid.
He'll be fine in a few days.

387
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,115
It's almost New Year. Time flies.

388
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,919
Yeah, time flies.

389
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,309
Why?

390
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,350
I'm sorry. I had to see my son.
I promised I'd see him at New Years'.

391
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,036
They said I could if we turned
ourselves in. Nothing will happen.

392
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,240
Lucas! Lucas!

393
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,195
Why? Why? You said we'd just get
a few days in the hole!

394
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,431
I don't negotiate with convicts.

395
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,511
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,757
I'll report you!

397
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,674
I don't think
you'll be seeing your son.

398
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,436
And if anyone hears you sold Lucas
out, you'll die a terrible death.

399
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,273
- Get him out of here!
- Come on!

400
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,432
Wake up! Everybody up! Wake up!

401
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,198
Come on!

402
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,838
This is what happens
when you break the rules.

403
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,151
Even though John went along
with Lucas' escape plan,

404
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,119
when we caught up with him,
he surrendered and said he was sorry.

405
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,029
He went for the sake
of his son's broken leg.

406
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,795
We forgive him. We are not
as unreasonable as you think.

407
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,351
We'll be watching him closely and if
he behaves, we'll forget about this.

408
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,958
A potato a day won't make you fat,

409
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,998
but will keep you healthy to fight
another day - Charlie.

410
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,712
Boss, Eddie's out of jail.
He's in the back room.

411
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,831
I'll go talk to him.

412
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:41,430
Sit down. How's everything?

413
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,991
Steve's not dead, he's injured so
they're keeping him in the sickroom.

414
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,433
We couldn't get him.

415
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,872
What are my men doing?

416
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,633
It seems as if Lucas got involved.

417
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,919
Brother, Eddie just got out of jail.
Make him comfortable.

418
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,594
Alfred, get Eddie set up
in the casino.

419
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,398
- Enjoy yourself.
- Thanks.

420
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,113
Well?

421
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,470
- What is it?
- That bastard Steve.

422
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:14,949
He's still alive and walking around.

423
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,071
God dammit!

424
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,910
Teddy died for nothing.

425
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,195
That bastard!

426
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,116
Boss, let me do it!

427
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,832
Some water, sir?

428
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,949
Here, boss, have some more noodles.

429
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,959
You eat. I'll do this.

430
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,758
Snake! Snake!

431
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,153
Go!

432
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,471
Freddy's dead.

433
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,234
- Get him out, hurry!
- Yes, sir.

434
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,992
Prisoner John Liu escaped three times
during his incarceration.

435
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:24,514
Additional punishment
proved no deterrent.

436
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:29,754
Furthermore, he caused the death
of corrections officer, Freddy Tang.

437
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,515
The judgment of this court
is that he be executed forthwith.

438
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,394
ID cards everyone. Come on.

439
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,953
Get in line.

440
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,110
Lieutenant, what's up?

441
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,316
Inspector, what's all this about?

442
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,231
Routine check.

443
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,992
Oh, yeah? Why now?

444
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:36,871
You only gave my daughter $5,000
as a wedding gift.

445
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,549
If I check here often,
you lose business.

446
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,870
You lose business, you lose money.

447
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:52,708
This is a nice place. It'd be a real
shame to have to close it down.

448
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,552
Really sad.

449
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,558
OK, how much do you want?

450
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,952
Five hundred dollars and two zeros.

451
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:11,319
All right, I'll pay you.
Come with me.

452
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:22,436
Hey, brother, what's up?

453
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,233
- Make him out a cheque for $50,000.
- Right.

454
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,593
We're all good friends here.
You can't come between us.

455
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:04,229
Now, listen. Choose a day
and I'll take you out to dinner.

456
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,433
I, ah...

457
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,750
I think I'll come back tomorrow.

458
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,239
What did you do that for?
I thought we were friends.

459
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,518
No need to fight. A zero here
or there, what does it matter?

460
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,316
I'm sorry we made you suffer.

461
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,513
I just need to get into the jail.
Thank you.

462
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,357
The cheque.

463
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:53,110
$50,000- less a zero or two. You're
going to do this favor for me.

464
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,430
- All right?
- All right.

465
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,679
Lock him up.

466
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,874
- Let's go.
- Move out.

467
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,158
Wait a second.

468
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,791
- Brother, look after the place.
- Be careful.

469
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,113
It's over.

470
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,118
Open up.

471
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,511
These are the rules.

472
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:30,071
On your clothing is a number, forget
it and it's ten days in the hole.

473
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,045
Fighting is on Saturday afternoon.

474
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,459
Any unsupervised fighting -
ten days in the hole.

475
01:06:35,494 --> 01:06:38,839
First bell rings at 7:55,
second bell rings at 8:00.

476
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,117
Never go against the officers.
never try to escape.

477
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,839
No raping of other inmates.
No breaking of fixtures.

478
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,036
Six months hard labor
for these offences.

479
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,396
Ten days in the hole
for smoking in bed.

480
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,040
Every Saturday,
you'll receive one clean sheet.

481
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,509
Send your bottom sheet
to the laundry.

482
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,068
Make a mistake -
ten days in the hole.

483
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,676
Memorize these rules. If you forget
them, ten days in the hole.

484
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,797
This is your cell.
Any questions, ask me.

485
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,153
He's still alive
because of your cowardice.

486
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,708
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.

487
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,116
My bet's on you.
Eat and get strong for the fight.

488
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:18,148
Mr. Li, your brother's death was
an accident. I want to apologize.

489
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:25,275
My little brother is dead.
Nothing you say can change that.

490
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:31,557
I had intended killing
your girlfriend to get in here.

491
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,670
But she couldn't wait around.
She's already dead.

492
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,713
You're lying.

493
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,394
They wouldn't tell you
cos it's not good for morale.

494
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,393
It was up to me to let you know.

495
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:56,518
I want you to feel the agony.
I'll kill you when I'm ready.

496
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,192
Who are you betting on?

497
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,032
Kill him!

498
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,111
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

499
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:50,875
Go on, you can do it. Kill again.

500
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,950
Don't do it, Steve!

501
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,558
Don't do it!

502
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,230
Kill him!

503
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,715
Stand back.

504
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:38,558
Don't! If you do, I'll report you.

505
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,189
- Take him away!
- Yes, sir.

506
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,951
"Happy New Year"

507
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,713
Sit down.

508
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,797
Try your luck.

509
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:30,791
I'll get some money.

510
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,199
Take mine.

511
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,352
- Thanks. I'll get my own.
- OK, but hurry.

512
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:02,831
Charlie! Let me go!

513
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,520
Let me go! Let me go!

514
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,079
You bastard!

515
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,032
Why? Why? Why?

516
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,436
Why? Why did you do it?
Why did you kill him?

517
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,478
It was him...

518
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:54,196
- Get this murderer out of here.
- Yes, sir.

519
01:15:54,280 --> 01:16:00,992
No! No! You're just trying to shut
me up! You told me to kill Andy.

520
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:05,551
Charlie was a mistake.
You're trying to frame me!

521
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:26,149
Inmate Andy Wong was cited for bad
conduct during his prison term.

522
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,994
He has been found guilty of murder
in the first degree.

523
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,470
It is the high court's decision

524
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:36,269
that Andy Wong shall be executed
by firing squad.

525
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,795
This is your funeral.

526
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,677
That's where you're buried.

527
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:45,999
Here's your death certificate.

528
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,428
We've kept you alive to work for us.

529
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,552
You're now a member
of the Executive Committee.

530
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,240
We've been watching you
for a long time.

531
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,756
You're a survivor with a strong sense
of justice, though misguided.

532
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:06,676
Society is becoming complex. There
are too many criminals on the street.

533
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,035
And too many loopholes.

534
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,829
They always seem to find a way
to escape punishment.

535
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,229
The Executive Committee
is in existence

536
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,788
solely to deal with these criminals.

537
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,759
Blood begets blood,
filth begets filth.

538
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:26,719
Your Government has given you
the honor of joining this team.

539
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,031
When your assignment is through,

540
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,396
we'll give you a passport
and a new identity.

541
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:37,239
You can go anywhere you want -
start all over again.

542
01:19:37,274 --> 01:19:41,398
In fact, you don't have a choice.
You're already dead.

543
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:44,790
This is your only chance.
This mission is your life.

544
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,799
This assignment is an assassination.
The target is Colonel Sama.

545
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:18,394
The biggest drug dealer
in Southeast Asia.

546
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,675
He's being brought in to stand trial.

547
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,752
But we know he's paid off
all the judges.

548
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,197
Before he boards his plane,
we must execute him.

549
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:32,034
Each of you has been issued two guns.

550
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,111
When you have accomplished
your mission,

551
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:40,469
you'll find a jeep waiting for you
directly behind you, 800 meters away.

552
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,949
Leave immediately.

553
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,635
Someone will meet you at the gate

554
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:48,439
and give you your passports
and airline tickets.

555
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,599
Let's go!

556
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,516
Come on, get in!

557
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,637
There's a bomb in the car. Jump!

558
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:42,159
Hey! Hold it! If I...
I promised my son I'd see him again.

559
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,790
Move it! You piece of shit!

560
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,118
Come on!

561
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,558
Hurry! Get in!

562
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,677
Tell him to slow down.

563
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:58,070
- Tell them to hurry up!
- Hurry! Quickly!

564
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,352
Faster!

565
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,434
Hey, Chief, looking for your gun?

566
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:11,032
Executive Committee member
number 24 reporting.

567
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,793
Well done, good job.

568
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,950
I'll get you your new passport.

569
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,315
You're free.

570
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,992
Using dead convicts to work for you.

571
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,594
Then killing them
when they're through.

572
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,510
A very clever plan.

573
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,592
You didn't realize
I'd come back alive.

574
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:38,232
I knew you would. I'll give you some
money, you can go wherever you want.

575
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,596
No one will be the wiser.
What do you say?

576
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,875
That's a real good plan.

577
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,716
There's just one thing...

578
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,917
Why did you do it?

579
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,998
That drug dealer was my partner.
I'd be dead if he testified.

580
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:02,917
What about Professor Leung?
Why did you kill him?

581
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,992
He was investigating me
and he was getting too close.

582
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,630
Here they are.

583
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:34,275
It's a lot of money. And tomorrow
I can send you a lot more.

584
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:35,793
It's all yours, Andy.

585
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,677
You make me sick.

586
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,591
So many good men killed.

587
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,638
Aw, Andy, don't be stupid.

588
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,473
You couldn't earn this much money
in a lifetime.

589
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:48,597
Thousands die every day, what
difference does a few more make?

590
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:52,673
What difference?
Can you pay for all of them?

591
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,671
The price is too high!

592
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:00,951
Bastard! I serve God, not you.
I'm going to kill you!

593
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:04,077
Andy! Don't.

594
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:50,953
