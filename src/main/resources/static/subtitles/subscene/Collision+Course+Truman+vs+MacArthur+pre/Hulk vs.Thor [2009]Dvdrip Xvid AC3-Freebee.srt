forever.

557
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,077
Your fate
is inescapable.

558
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,063
We shall see.

559
00:40:08,856 --> 00:40:11,724
[#]

560
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:40,153
Thus, the cycle begins anew.

561
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,189
Asgard is safe once again,

562
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:46,059
defended to the end
by its heroes.

563
00:40:46,127 --> 00:40:49,396
I am proud of each of you
that stand before me.

564
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:53,399
The day was saved by loyalty
and sacrifice.

565
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:57,253
<i>We honor those</i>
<i>who fought beside us,</i>

566
00:40:57,321 --> 00:41:00,924
<i>those who are no longer</i>
<i>with us.</i>

567
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:04,961
<i>And we defy those who would</i>
<i>see us brought to ruin.</i>

568
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:08,665
And while the rewards
of Valhalla

569
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,367
await all of Asgard's heroes,

570
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:15,037
this day we honor
a hero of Midgard.

571
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,474
A mortal who
sacrificed everything

572
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,677
for a land
not his own.

573
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:24,881
This day, a human
showed the gods

574
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,883
what legends
are made of.

575
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:31,070
Hail the mortal, Bruce Banner.
