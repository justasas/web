01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,500
[LAUGHING]

1074
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,600
BRAVO.

1075
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,600
THAT WAS A REALLY GREAT
EXPERIENCE.

1076
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,400
Tech:
CONGRATULATIONS.

1077
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,600
OK, QUIET DOWN.
LET'S CONCENTRATE.

1078
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,400
Chloe:
THAT WAS GOOD WORK.

1079
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:47,700
WHOO!

1080
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,800
Tech: LET'S GET
SOME CHAMPAGNE UP HERE.

1081
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,500
CONGRATULATIONS.

1082
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,600
Moses: BRILLIANT, CHRISTOF.
JUST BRILLIANT.

1083
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,600
Roman:
IT JUST BROKE MY HEART.

1084
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,700
WELL DONE, EVERYONE!

1085
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,100
BRAVO!

1086
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,500
Announcer: 1.7 BILLION
WERE THERE FOR HIS BIRTH.

1087
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,500
220 COUNTRIES TUNED IN
FOR HIS FIRST STEP.

1088
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
THE WORLD STOOD STILL
FOR THAT STOLEN KISS,

1089
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,200
AND AS HE GREW,
SO DID THE TECHNOLOGY.

1090
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,100
AN ENTIRE HUMAN LIFE

1091
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,400
RECORDED ON AN INTRICATE
NETWORK OF HIDDEN CAMERAS

1092
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,700
AND BROADCAST LIVE AND
UNEDITED 24 HOURS A DAY,

1093
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,600
7 DAYS A WEEK TO AN AUDIENCE
AROUND THE GLOBE.

1094
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,300
COMING TO YOU NOW
FROM SEAHAVEN ISLAND,

1095
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,500
ENCLOSED IN THE LARGEST
STUDIO EVER CONSTRUCTED,

1096
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,800
AND ALONG WITH
THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA,

1097
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,200
ONE OF ONLY 2 MANMADE STRUCTURES
VISIBLE FROM SPACE,

1098
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,200
NOW IN ITS 30th GREAT YEAR,

1099
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,500
IT'S...

1100
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,100
WHAT A WEEK IT'S BEEN.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU--

1101
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,900
I WAS ON PINS AND NEEDLES
THE ENTIRE TIME.

1102
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,200
HELLO AND GOOD EVENING.
I'M YOUR HOST MIKE MICHAELSON,

1103
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,900
  AND WELCOME TO  TRU-TALK,

1104
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,800
OUR FORUM FOR ISSUES
GROWING OUT OF THE SHOW.

1105
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,900
BUT TONIGHT,
SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL INDEED,

1106
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,200
A RARE AND
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

1107
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,700
WITH THE SHOW'S
CONCEIVER AND CREATOR.

1108
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,000
SO, COME WITH US NOW AS WE
GO LIVE TO THE LUNAR ROOM

1109
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,200
ON THE 221st FLOOR
OF THE OMNI CAM ECHOSPHERE,

1110
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,900
WHERE WE'LL FIND THE WORLD'S
GREATEST TELE-VISIONARY--

1111
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,300
THE DESIGNER AND ARCHITECT
OF THE WORLD WITHIN A WORLD

1112
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,300
THAT IS SEAHAVEN ISLAND--
CHRISTOF.

1113
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,000
BEFORE WE BEGIN,
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU

1114
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,700
ON BEHALF OF OUR AUDIENCE
FOR GRANTING THIS INTERVIEW.

1115
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,700
WE KNOW HOW DEMANDING
YOUR SCHEDULE IS,

1116
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,000
AND WE ALL KNOW HOW JEALOUSLY
YOU GUARD YOUR PRIVACY.

1117
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,600
THIS, SIR,
IS INDEED AN HONOR.

1118
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,300
DON'T MENTION IT.

1119
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,700
WELL, THE CATALYST FOR
THE RECENT DRAMATIC EVENTS

1120
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,800
ON THE SHOW HAS BEEN
TRUMAN'S FATHER, KIRK,

1121
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,300
AND HIS ATTEMPTS
TO INFILTRATE THE SHOW.

1122
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,700
BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT,
I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING

1123
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,100
THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME
SOMEONE FROM THE OUTSIDE

1124
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,500
HAS ATTEMPTED
TO REACH TRUMAN, IS IT?

1125
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,100
Christof: WE HAVE HAD
CLOSE CALLS IN THE PAST.

1126
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,000
Man: TRUMAN!
IT'S TELEVISION!

1127
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,400
YES!

1128
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,100
YES! I DID IT!

1129
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,500
  I'M ON  THE TRUMAN SHOW!

1130
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,200
Mike: BUT THERE'S NEVER
BEEN ANYTHING TO COMPARE

1131
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,800
WITH THIS MOST RECENT
BREACH IN SECURITY--

1132
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
THE FIRST INTRUDER TO BE
A FORMER CAST MEMBER.

1133
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,100
A DEAD ONE AT THAT.

1134
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,300
GOTTA SAY, WRITING KIRK
BACK IN--MASTERSTROKE.

1135
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,100
SINCE KIRK STARTED THIS
CRISIS IN TRUMAN'S LIFE,

1136
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:47,200
I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT ONLY HE COULD END IT.

1137
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,900
TRUMAN! TRUMAN! NO!

1138
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,300
[CONSTRUCTION NOISES]

1139
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,400
THAT'S OFF LIMITS!

1140
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,600
WHY? WHAT'S
OVER THERE?

1141
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,700
NOTHING. IT'S DANGEROUS.
THAT'S ALL.

1142
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,600
YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW
YOUR LIMITATIONS, TRUMAN.

1143
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,200
Mike: BUT LET'S REMIND
VIEWERS EXACTLY WHY

1144
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,600
DAD WAS WRITTEN OUT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1145
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,600
Christof: AS TRUMAN GREW UP,
WE WERE FORCED

1146
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,800
TO MANUFACTURE WAYS
TO KEEP HIM ON THE ISLAND.

1147
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,900
I'D LIKE TO BE
AN EXPLORER,

1148
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,600
LIKE THE GREAT
MAGELLAN.

1149
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,300
YOU'RE TOO LATE.

1150
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,300
THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING LEFT TO EXPLORE.

1151
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,800
[SNARLING]

1152
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,500
Christof: FINALLY, I CAME UP
WITH KIRK'S DROWNING.

1153
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,200
Mike: MOST EFFECTIVE.

1154
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,100
TRUMAN'S BEEN TERRIFIED
OF THE WATER EVER SINCE.

1155
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,400
Christof: WHEN KIRK READ
THE SYNOPSIS OF THE EPISODE,

1156
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,300
HE WAS DISAPPOINTED
TO SAY THE LEAST.

1157
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,000
JESUS!

1158
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,300
I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT CAUSED
HIM TO BREAK ONTO THE SET.

1159
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,700
BUT HOW DO YOU INTEND TO
EXPLAIN HIS 22-YEAR ABSENCE?

1160
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:41,600
AMNESIA.

1161
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,800
BRILLIANT. LET'S TAKE
SOME VIEWER PHONE CALLS.

1162
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,400
CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA,
YOU'RE ON WITH CHRISTOF.

1163
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,500
Man: UH, YEAH,
HI, CHRISTOF.

1164
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,800
I WAS WONDERING HOW MANY
CAMERAS YOU GOT IN THAT TOWN.

1165
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,400
SOMEWHERE IN
THE VICINITY OF 5,000.

1166
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,100
Man: THAT'S
A LOT OF CAMERAS.

1167
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,100
REMEMBER, WE STARTED
WITH JUST ONE.

1168
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,900
HE WAS CURIOUS
FROM BIRTH.

1169
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,900
PREMATURE BY 2 WEEKS.

1170
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,800
ALMOST AS IF HE COULDN'T
WAIT TO GET STARTED.

1171
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Mike: HIS EAGERNESS
TO LEAVE HIS MOTHER'S WOMB

1172
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,700
WAS THE VERY REASON
HE WAS THE ONE SELECTED.

1173
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,500
IN COMPETITION WITH 5 OTHER
UNWANTED PREGNANCIES,

1174
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,700
THE CASTING OF A SHOW,
DETERMINED BY AN AIR DATE,

1175
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,600
TRUMAN WAS THE ONE
WHO ARRIVED ON CUE.

1176
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,000
Mike: INCIDENTALLY, I BELIEVE
TRUMAN IS THE FIRST CHILD

1177
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,200
TO HAVE BEEN LEGALLY ADOPTED
BY A CORPORATION.

1178
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,400
THAT'S CORRECT.

1179
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,600
THE SHOW HAS GENERATED
ENORMOUS REVENUES NOW,

1180
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,100
EQUIVALENT TO THE GROSS NATIONAL
PRODUCT OF A SMALL COUNTRY.

1181
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,200
PEOPLE FORGET IT TAKES
THE POPULATION

1182
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,900
OF AN ENTIRE COUNTRY TO
KEEP THE SHOW RUNNING.

1183
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,800
SINCE THE SHOW IS ON
24-HOURS A DAY

1184
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,300
WITHOUT COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTION,
ALL THOSE STAGGERING REVENUES

1185
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,900
ARE GENERATED
BY PRODUCT PLACEMENT.

1186
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,400
THAT'S TRUE. EVERYTHING
ON THE SHOW IS FOR SALE.

1187
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,000
FROM THE ACTOR'S WARDROBE,
FOOD PRODUCTS,

1188
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,100
TO THE VERY HOMES
THEY LIVE IN.

1189
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,400
Mike: AND ALL OF IT AVAILABLE
IN THE TRUMAN CATALOG.

1190
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,900
OPERATORS ARE STANDING BY.

1191
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,700
CHRISTOF, LET ME ASK YOU,

1192
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,900
WHY DO YOU THINK TRUMAN
HAS NEVER COME CLOSE

1193
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,300
TO DISCOVERING THE TRUE NATURE
OF HIS WORLD UNTIL NOW?

1194
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,500
WE ACCEPT THE REALITY
OF THE WORLD

1195
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,600
WITH WHICH WE ARE
PRESENTED.

1196
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,900
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

1197
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,800
THE HAGUE FOR CHRISTOF.

1198
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,500
HELLO? THE HAGUE?

1199
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,600
ALL RIGHT,
WE'VE LOST THAT CALL.

1200
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,800
  LET'S GO TO HOLLYWOOD.
YOU'RE ON  TRU-TALK.

1201
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,600
HI, CHRISTOF. I'D JUST
LIKE TO SAY ONE THING.

1202
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,100
YOU'RE A LIAR
AND A MANIPULATOR,

1203
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,200
AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE
TO TRUMAN IS SICK!

1204
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,300
WELL, WE REMEMBER
THIS VOICE, DON'T WE?

1205
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:39,700
HOW COULD WE FORGET?

1206
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,200
Mike: LET'S GO
TO ANOTHER CALL.

1207
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,100
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S FINE, MIKE.

1208
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,700
I LOVE TO REMINISCE WITH
FORMER MEMBERS OF THE CAST.

1209
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,900
SYLVIA...

1210
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,200
AS YOU ANNOUNCED SO
MELODRAMATICALLY TO THE WORLD,

1211
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,700
YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU BATTED
YOUR EYES AT TRUMAN ONCE...

1212
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,900
FLIRTED WITH HIM...

1213
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,400
STOLE A FEW MINUTES
OF AIR TIME WITH HIM...

1214
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,900
TO THRUST YOURSELF AND YOUR
POLITICS INTO THE LIMELIGHT...

1215
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,900
THAT YOU KNOW HIM?

1216
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,900
THAT YOU KNOW
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR HIM?

1217
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,200
YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE
IN A POSITION TO JUDGE HIM?

1218
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,300
WHAT RIGHT DO YOU HAVE
TO TAKE A BABY

1219
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,400
AND TURN HIS LIFE INTO
SOME KIND OF MOCKERY?

1220
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,200
DON'T YOU EVER
FEEL GUILTY?

1221
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,100
I HAVE GIVEN TRUMAN A CHANCE
TO LEAD A NORMAL LIFE.

1222
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,900
THE WORLD...

1223
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,000
THE PLACE YOU LIVE IN...

1224
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,700
IS THE SICK PLACE.

1225
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,300
SEAHAVEN'S THE WAY
THE WORLD SHOULD BE.

1226
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,000
HE'S NOT A PERFORMER.
HE'S A PRISONER.

1227
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,500
LOOK AT HIM! LOOK AT
WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO HIM!

1228
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,700
HE CAN LEAVE AT ANY TIME.

1229
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,400
IF HIS WAS MORE
THAN JUST A VAGUE AMBITION,

1230
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,700
IF HE WAS ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED
TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH,

1231
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
THERE'S NO WAY
WE COULD PREVENT HIM.

1232
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,200
I THINK WHAT DISTRESSES
YOU REALLY, CALLER,

1233
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,100
IS THAT ULTIMATELY...

1234
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,200
TRUMAN PREFERS HIS CELL,
AS YOU CALL IT.

1235
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,500
THAT'S WHERE

I CAN HEAR YOU.

1584
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,000
WHO ARE YOU?

1585
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,200
I AM THE CREATOR
OF A TELEVISION SHOW

1586
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,600
THAT GIVES HOPE AND JOY
AND INSPIRATION TO MILLIONS.

1587
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,500
THEN WHO AM I?

1588
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:40,100
YOU'RE THE STAR.

1589
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,100
WAS NOTHING REAL?

1590
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,100
YOU WERE REAL.

1591
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:51,100
THAT'S WHAT MADE YOU
SO GOOD TO WATCH.

1592
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:54,200
LISTEN TO ME, TRUMAN.

1593
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,800
THERE'S NO MORE TRUTH
OUT THERE...

1594
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
THAN THERE IS IN THE WORLD
I CREATED FOR YOU.

1595
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,000
THE SAME LIES.

1596
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,600
THE SAME DECEIT.

1597
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,300
BUT IN MY WORLD...

1598
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:14,200
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO FEAR.

1599
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,500
I KNOW YOU BETTER
THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF.

1600
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,600
YOU NEVER HAD
A CAMERA IN MY HEAD.

1601
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:24,800
YOU'RE AFRAID.

1602
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,700
THAT'S WHY
YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

1603
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:33,700
IT'S OK, TRUMAN.

1604
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,900
I UNDERSTAND.

1605
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:40,000
I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

1606
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,200
I WAS WATCHING
WHEN YOU WERE BORN.

1607
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:49,800
I WAS WATCHING WHEN YOU
TOOK YOUR FIRST STEP.

1608
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I WATCHED YOU ON YOUR
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

1609

THE EPISODE WHEN YOU
LOST YOUR FIRST TOOTH.

1611
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:09,300
YOU CAN'T LEAVE, TRUMAN.

1612
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,200
PLEASE, GOD.

1613
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,400
Christof:
YOU BELONG HERE...

1614
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,000
YOU CAN DO IT.

1615
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:19,000

WELL, SAY SOMETHING,
GODDAMN IT.
