1
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,605
<i>My name is Wolverine.</i>

2
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:15,645
<i>I'm the best there is at what I do.</i>
<i>But what I do isn't very nice.</i>

3
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,490
What the?

4
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,648
What the hell happened?

5
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,771
Oh, yeah.

6
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,389
Sir, I know I'm not supposed
to ask questions...

7
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:40,007
but... who are you?

8
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,632
No one you wanna know, kid.

9
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,415
Looks like someone had a bad day.

10
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,424
<i>Copy.</i>
<i>We're still searching for any survivors.</i>

11
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,266
It happened about four hours ago,
just before dawn.

12
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:29,032
The creature was sighted
crossing the U.S. -Canadian border.

13
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,336
This is what happened
when it reached civilization.

14
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,876
Creature?

15
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,414
The Americans call it "the Hulk."
Intel's sketchy.

16
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,781
Department H thinks the U.S. military
is covering something up.

17
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,101
It smells toxic.

18
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,142
Gunpowder too.

19
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:07,802
Well, someone tried to fight back.

20
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,044
Guess they didn't fight hard enough.

21
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,552
Department H wants you to find
and stop the Hulk...

22
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,883
...before he reaches another town
or city.

23
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,226
And if you can't stop it, kill it.

24
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,696
Sounds like fun.

25
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,372
Sir, I think we got something.

26
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,789
- Do you want us to try for a landing?
- Don't bother.

27
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,638
Oh, my God.

28
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,834
Hey, bub.

29
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:56,644
You haven't seen a big monster
running around anywhere, have you?

30
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,007
No. Stay back.

31
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,415
Stay away from me. Stay back.

32
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,388
Relax, crybaby. I ain't gonna...

33
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,366
You smell toxic.

34
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,537
Who are you?

35
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,178
Please, I'm begging you,
leave me alone.

36
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,679
For your own sake, please, go.
You're in terrible danger.

37
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,155
Here's the deal, misty.

38
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,220
There's a third claw
that's gonna come out...

39
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,686
...if you don't start talking.

40
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,768
Oh, hell.

41
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,112
I don't suppose you got any interest
in talking this out.

42
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,561
What the hell happened?

43
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,900
Oh, yeah.

44
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,743
Let's do this.

45
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,639
Come on.

46
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,217
Hulk smash little man.

47
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,914
Little man, leave Hulk alone.

48
00:09:54,527 --> 00:10:00,295
Hulk is strongest there is!

49
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:37,658
Okay, bub. Let's try that again.

50
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:28,075
Thanks, runt.

51
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,222
We've been trying to take him down
for weeks.

52
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,291
Logan, buddy, it's me, Deadpool.

53
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,053
I shot you.

54
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,640
What are you looking at?

55
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:04,013
Prepare the lab. We're on our way.

56
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,630
His vital signs are increasing.
He's waking up.

57
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,500
Now, Miss Hines,
begin the adamantium bonding process.

58
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,142
- Yes, professor.
- Commencing infusion.

59
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,278
- His vitals are erratic but holding.
- Excellent.

60
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,288
Increase to maximum.

61
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,560
Weapon X's mental conditioning
and reprogramming are at stage five.

62
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,734
Begin combat assessment.

63
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,806
I don't care how long you've had him,
professor.

64
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,381
This is a mistake.
I know him. He can't be controlled.

65
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,280
You have his DNA,
so just let me kill him.

66
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,979
I'll take that under advisement,
Sabretooth.

67
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:49,525
- Prepare your team for the mission.
- Your funeral.

68
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,807
What do you say after the mission,
we kill all those floating babies?

69
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,377
Do you ever shut up, Wilson?

70
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,973
What? Babies creep me out.

71
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,087
He's fighting the programming.

72
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,486
We are losing control.
Increase the dosage.

73
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:31,227
Initiate lockdown procedures.
And someone activate Sabretooth.

74
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,878
Guards! Guards!

75
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:15,247
Wakey-wakey time.

76
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,809
Logan, we missed you.

77
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,543
And Weapon X just hasn't been
the same without you.

78
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,120
Nobody calls me "bub" anymore.

79
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,553
And Omega Red's a bed wetter.

80
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,664
One day I will tear out
your flippant tongue, Wilson.

81
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,267
He's very ashamed.

82
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,265
Despite Deadpool's idiocy...

83
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,999
...Weapon X is indeed pleased
to have you back, Logan.

84
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,973
We put considerable time
and money into you.

85
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:51,741
- And pointy things.
- You were our best operative, Wolverine.

86
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,010
So disappointing.

87
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,210
But you did lead us to Dr. Banner.

88
00:15:56,422 --> 00:16:00,222
Of course,
you know him better as the Hulk.

89
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,553
I shot him in the ass.
With one of these.

90
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,219
What? I did.

91
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:08,730
Weapon X has been pursuing the Hulk
for weeks.

92
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:30,545
Unfortunately,
there was some collateral damage.

93
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,021
If only Department H
had sent you in sooner...

94
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,787
...who knows how much destruction
could have been avoided?

95
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,897
What do you want with the Hulk?

96
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,926
We just wanna help him
find his happy place.

97
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,830
Did you see how angry he was?

98
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,097
I mean, I'm sorry, but come on.

99
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,470
I think his pants are too tight...

100
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:55,837
We want the same thing
we wanted with you, Logan:

101
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,345
a weapon.

102
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,677
I'll erase Banner's memories
and reprogram him...

103
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,649
...just like I did you.

104
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,049
And then Weapon X...

105
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,851
...will have the most powerful creature
on the planet...

106
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,994
...at our disposal.

107
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,597
You should've killed me
when you had the chance...

108
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,961
...because I'm gonna get out of here...

109
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,330
...l'm gonna kill all of them...

110
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:23,099
...and then I'm gonna cut out your heart.

111
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,314
Wolverine, after I'm done with you...

112
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,313
...you won't even remember
this conversation.

113
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:37,012
I've erased your life before,
and I'm going to do it again.

114
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:41,420
All you'll know
is that you belong to Weapon X...

115
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:45,222
...now and forever.

116
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,466
Oh, that is so not cool.

117
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,469
I hate that guy.

118
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,971
Wolverine, you look so sad.

119
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:03,171
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,
Lady Deathstrike tried to kill you...

120
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,644
...while you were asleep.

121
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,048
- Better than having to listen to you.
- Man, does she hate you.

122
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,721
I mean, we all hate you...

123
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:15,792
...but Deathstrike really, really,
really hates you.

124
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,555
Hey,
still have that unbreakable skull?

125
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,791
Damn it.

126
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,178
You will die today, Logan-san.

127
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:43,147
It does not matter
what the Professor says.

128
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,017
These are your last breaths.

129
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,096
What are you doing here, Deathstrike?

130
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,931
I'm about to start
Wolverine's reprogramming.

131
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,732
He has to die.

132
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,809
How many times do I have to have
this conversation with you?

133
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,707
He's more valuable alive than...

134
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,962
Sorry, Prof.
Gotta go with the lady on this one.

135
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,316
You've gotta love our healing factors.

136
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,691
I'm gonna enjoy killing you for days.

137
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:04,460
And then I think we'll drop the Hulk
on an orphanage or something...

138
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,230
...just for fun.

139
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,300
<i>Gaijin</i> dog.

140
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:15,469
For the dishonor you caused my family,
you will suffer.

141
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,673
And then you will die.

142
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:25,020
Sweetheart, you and your family
can take your honor...

143
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,284
...and shove it up your bony little...

144
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,292
Deathstrike, don't!

145
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:27,242
Target located in Cell 23.
Take him down.

146
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,268
Backup. We need backup!

147
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,470
Well, he's alive...

148
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:01,084
...but I think he's gonna need
some serious TLC.

149
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:04,585
The last thing the Professor said
before the runt gutted him...

150
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,418
...was for us to kill Wolverine.

151
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,423
Really?

152
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,426
Do you buy that?

153
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,191
Yeah, you know, I would think
the last thing he said was, "Sabretooth!"

154
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,598
We kill Wolverine now.
That is all that matters.

155
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,933
Whatever you say, ponytail.
Who am I to say no to a little murder?

156
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:25,439
Strike a pose.

157
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,005
Get it together.
We're gonna have company soon.

158
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:59,007
Please. Please, I'm begging you.

159
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,408
You have to help me.
You have to get me out of here.

160
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,242
If these people turn the Hulk
into a weapon...

161
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,816
...millions of people will die.

162
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:12,149
So I should just kill you now.
That's what you're saying, right?

163
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,086
Come on, weepy.

164
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,758
You don't know what it's like.

165
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,163
I've been hunted
for as long as I can remember.

166
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,838
And I can't control it. The monster, it...

167
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,531
Look, do I look like I give a...?

168
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,125
Please, struggle.

169
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:57,131
It will make your death
taste so much sweeter.

170
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,501
- No!
- Yes.

171
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,506
As in, "Yes, you're going to die."

172
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,473
I'm just kidding.

173
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,748
No. That was my favorite gun.

174
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,831
What the hell's the matter with you?
Do your thing.

175
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,831
We need your big green friend out here
right freaking now.

176
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,231
What? No.

177
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:37,468
What do you mean, "no"?

178
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,736
Even if that was a good idea, I can't.

179
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:45,610
The transformation happens
when I feel angry or stressed.

180
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,978
No, they must have drugged me.

181
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:50,848
Something's suppressing
my adrenaline.

182
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:53,251
It comes from the cortex.

183
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,357
Maybe that will help speed things up.

184
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:04,591
If you wanna cry now, I'd say go for it.

185
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,406
End of the line, runt.

186
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,769
Got any last words?

187
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,707
Yeah, two.

188
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:22,610
Let's dance.

189
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:33,529
I've been waiting for this a long time.

190
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,467
Yeah, well, you can keep waiting.

191
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:59,119
Dude, that is just not cool.

192
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,857
Look at that.

193
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,362
Could you give me a hand?

194
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,862
I'm kidding. All right, I'll go get it.

195
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,942
There we go. No, that's not right.
What the hell?

196
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,883
Oh, God, now it's upside down.

197
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,191
There she is. Sweet.

198
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,080
You will die.

199
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,527
Gonna kill you.

200
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:35,351
Hulk smash claw people.

201
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,110
Come on, come on. Come on, now.
Come on, come on, come on.

202
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,783
Come on, come on, come on.

203
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:16,589
The next one will be
through your brain stem, Logan-san.

204
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:26,894
Little man.

205
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:37,411
Hey. Hey, hey, I'm on your side,
you flaming idiot.

206
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,328
Hey, wait for me.

207
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,929
Who wants snacks? You do.

208
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,465
Logan, I think we lost him.

209
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:13,210
And they lived happily ever after,
except the Hulk.

210
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,546
Bub, you just made him angrier.

211
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:28,524
Talking man hurt Hulk.

212
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:33,727
Hulk rip off talking man's head!

213
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,605
My head? Oh, crap.

214
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,470
He's all yours, Einstein.

215
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:43,613
No, Logan, we're friends. No. No!

216
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,196
Ugly girl scratch Hulk.

217
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,801
Go for it, big guy.

218
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,175
Tear this whole godforsaken place
down to the ground.

219
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,853
Do it.

220
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:26,966
Great.

221
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:41,491
All right, bub. Where were we?

222
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:39,087
Guys? Red? Deathstrike?

223
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,765
I can't believe it. I'm alive.

224
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,594
I'm alive!

225
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:57,595
