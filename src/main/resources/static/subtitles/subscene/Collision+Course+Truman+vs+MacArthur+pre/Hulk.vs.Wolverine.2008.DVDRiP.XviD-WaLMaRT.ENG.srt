00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,520
<i>My name is Wolverine.</i>

2
00:00:09,873 --> 00:00:15,310
<i>I'm the best there is at what I do,
but what I do isn't very nice.</i>

3
00:00:26,788 --> 00:00:27,590
What the...?

4
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:49,730
What the hell happened?

5
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,260
Oh, yeah.

6
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:12,202
Hulk vs. Wolverine
Subtitles by Darkopal

7
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,010
Four Hours Ago

8
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:38,462
Sir, I know I'm not supposed
to ask questions...

9
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:39,751
...but who are you?

10
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,283
No one you wanna know, kid.

11
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,386
Looks like someone had a bad day.

12
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,450
<i>Copy. Still searching for any survivors.</i>

13
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:25,060
It happened about 4 hours ago,
just before dawn.

14
00:03:25,646 --> 00:03:28,600
A creature has sighted
crossing US-Canadian border.

15
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,400
This is what happened
when it reached civilization.

16
00:03:32,663 --> 00:03:33,725
Creature?

17
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,021
The Americans call it the Hulk.

18
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:38,212
Intel sketchy.

19
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:41,876
Department H. thinks the US military
is covering something up.

20
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:01,244
He smells toxic.

21
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:04,178
Gun powder too.

22
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:07,720
Well... Someone tried to fight back.

23
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,513
<i>Welcome Elkford.</i>

24
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:13,868
Guess they didn't fight hard enough.

25
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:16,271
Department H. wants you
to find and stop the Hulk...

26
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,464
...before he reaches
another town or city.

27
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:21,285
And if you can't stop it, kill it!

28
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:24,731
Sounds like fun.

29
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,510
Sir, I think we got something.

30
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:49,905
- Do you want us try for a landing?
- Don't bother.

31
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:46,934
Why always that?

32
00:06:48,749 --> 00:06:50,700
Hey, Bub.

33
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,846
You haven't seen a big monster
running around anywhere, have you?

34
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:00,393
No! Stay back!
Stay away from me!

35
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:01,725
Stay back!

36
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,625
Relax, cry baby.
I ain't gonna...

37
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:13,939
You smell toxic!

38
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:22,005
Who are you?

39
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:25,991
Please, I'm begging you.
Leave me alone!

40
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:28,928
For your own sake, please, go!

41
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,780
You are in terrible danger!

42
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:36,080
Here is the deal, misty.

43
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:39,831
There is a third claw that's gonna come out
if you don't start talking.

44
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,131
Oh, hell!

45
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,159
I don't suppose you got any interest
to talking this out.

46
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:19,672
What the hell happened?

47
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:28,147
Oh, yeah.

48
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:32,136
Let's do this!

49
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:34,475
Come on!

50
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:47,016
Hulk smash little man!

51
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:51,038
Little man leave Hulk alone!

52
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:59,979
Hulk is strongest there is!

53
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:36,912
Okay, Bub.
Let's try that again.

54
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,008
Thanks runt.

55
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,219
We've been trying
to take him down for weeks.

56
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:32,600
Logan, buddy!

57
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:35,939
It's me, Deadpool!
I shot you!

58
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,495
What are you looking at?

59
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,165
Prepare the lab.
We are on our way.

60
00:12:07,902 --> 00:12:10,940
His vital signs are increasing.
He's waking up.

61
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:22,771
Now, Mrs. Hynes, begin
the adamantium bonding process.

62
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:24,733
- Yes, professor.
- Commencing infusion.

63
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:36,979
- The vitals are erratic but holding.
- Excellent!

64
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:39,374
Increase to maximum.

65
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:20,712
Weapon-X's mental conditioning
and reprogramming are at stage 5.

66
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:22,968
Begin combat assessment.

67
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:36,083
I don't care how long you had him
professor, this is a mistake.

68
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,558
I know him.
He can't be controlled.

69
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,156
You have his DNA,
so just let me kill him.

70
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:45,059
I'll take that
under advisement, Sabertooth.

71
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,866
Prepare your team for the mission.

72
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:48,637
Your funeral.

73
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:05,133
What do you say after the mission
we kill all those flooding babies?

74
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:08,270
Do you ever shut up, Wilson?

75
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,087
What? Babies creep me out.

76
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:13,340
Good bye, bamm!

77
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:21,028
He's fighting to programming.

78
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:26,394
We are losing control!
Increase the dosage!

79
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:30,310
Initiate lock down procedures
and someone activate Sabertooth!

80
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:39,924
Guards! Guards!

81
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,195
Wakey wakey time!

82
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:18,612
Logan!
We missed you!

83
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:21,460
The Weapon-X just hasn't been
the same without you.

84
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:26,929
Nobody calls me Bub anymore.
And Omega Red is a bed wetter.

85
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:33,398
One day I will tear up
your flipping tongue, Wilson.

86
00:15:34,565 --> 00:15:36,291
He's very ashamed.

87
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:40,236
Despite Deadpool's idiocy,...

88
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:43,857
...Weapon-X is indeed pleased
to have you back, Logan.

89
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:47,201
We put considerable time
and money into you.

90
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:48,642
And pointy things.

91
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:53,947
You're our best operative, Wolverine.
So disappointing.

92
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,214
But you did lead us to Dr. Banner.

93
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,785
Of course, you know him better as,...

94
00:15:58,869 --> 00:16:00,120
...the Hulk.

95
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:02,822
I shot him in the ass.
With one of these.

96
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,628
What? I did.

97
00:16:05,488 --> 00:16:08,595
Weapon-X has been pursuing
the Hulk for weeks.

98
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:30,534
Unfortunately, there was
some collateral damage.

99
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,064
If only Department H.
had sent you in sooner...

100
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,383
...who knows how much destruction
could have been avoided?

101
00:16:37,934 --> 00:16:39,827
What do you want with the Hulk?

102
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,020
We just wanna help him
find his happy place.

103
00:16:43,305 --> 00:16:44,883
Did you see how angry he was?

104
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,359
I'm sorry, but come on.
I think his fancy...

105
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:55,530
We want the same thing
we wanted with you, Logan.

106
00:16:55,858 --> 00:16:57,230
A weapon.

107
00:16:57,612 --> 00:17:00,697
I'll erase Banner's memories
and reprogram him...

108
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,500
...just like I did you.

109
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:07,725
And then Weapon-X will have the most
powerful creature on the planet.

110
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:10,013
At our disposal.

111
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,356
You shoulda kill me,
when you had a chance.

112
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:16,899
Because I'm gonna get out of here.

113
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:19,238
I'm gonna kill all of them.

114
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,047
And then I'm gonna cut out your heart.

115
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,233
Wolverine, after I'm done with you...

116
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:32,425
...you won't even remember
this conversation.

117
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:36,608
I've erased your life before,
and I'm gonna do it again.

118
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:41,434
All you'll know is that you
belong to Weapon-X.

119
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,693
Now and forever.

120
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,795
That was so not cool.

121
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:53,768
I hate that guy.

122
00:17:55,336 --> 00:17:56,801
Ah, Wolverine.

123
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:58,568
You look so sad.

124
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:01,479
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,...

125
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,520
...Lady Deathstrike tried to kill you
while you were asleep.

126
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:07,251
Better than having listen to you.

127
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:09,167
Man, she hates you.

128
00:18:09,516 --> 00:18:11,028
I mean, we all hate you.

129
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:15,409
But Deathstrike really, really,
really hates you.

130
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:18,977
Hey, still have that unbreakable skull?

131
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:23,301
Ow, damn it!

132
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,795
You will die today, Logan-san.

133
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,313
It does not matter
what the professor says.

134
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:45,935
These are your last breaths.

135
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,089
What are you doing here, Deathstrike?

136
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:00,929
I'm about to start
Wolverine's reprogramming.

137
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,811
He has to die!

138
00:19:02,828 --> 00:19:06,729
How many times do I have to have
this conversation with you?

139
00:19:07,122 --> 00:19:08,736
He's more valuable alive and...

140
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,677
Sorry Prof, gotta go
with the lady on this one.

141
00:19:52,952 --> 00:19:55,490
I gotta love our healing factors.

142
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:59,481
I'm gonna enjoy killing you for days.

143
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:04,382
And then I think we'll drop the Hulk
on an orphanage or something...

144
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:06,470
...just for fun.

145
00:20:08,265 --> 00:20:10,075
Gaijin dog!

146
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,346
For the dishonour you've caused
my family, you will suffer.

147
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:18,633
And then you will die.

148
00:20:20,244 --> 00:20:21,807
Sweetheart...

149
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,165
...you and your family can take your honour
and shove it up your bony little...

150
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:32,070
Deathstrike, don't!

151
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,273
Target located in Zone-23.

152
00:21:26,022 --> 00:21:26,902
Take him down!

153
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:43,812
Back up! We need back up!

154
00:21:56,494 --> 00:22:00,655
Well, he's alive but I think
he's gonna need some serious TLC.

155
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,507
The last thing the professor said
before the runt cutted him,...

156
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,393
...was for us to kill Wolverine.

157
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:08,839
Really?

158
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:11,113
You buy that?

159
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:14,102
Yeah, you know, I would think
the last thing he said was...

160
00:22:14,308 --> 00:22:15,517
..."Ah, Sabretooth!"

161
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,320
We kill Wolverine now.
That is all that matters.

162
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,227
Whatever you say ponytail.
I'm in the mood for a little murder.

163
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:25,140
Strike a pose!

164
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:54,922
Get it together.
We're gonna have company soon.

165
00:22:55,894 --> 00:22:58,525
Please!
Please, I'm begging you.

166
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,267
You have to help me.
You have to get me outta here!

167
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:07,548
If these people turn Hulk into a weapon
millions of people will die.

168
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:11,239
So I should just kill you now,
that's what your saying right?

169
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,031
Come on, weepy.

170
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:22,246
You don't know what it's like.

171
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:25,069
I've been hunted
for as long as I can remember.

172
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,765
And I can't control it.

173
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,769
- The monster, it...
- Bub, do I look like I give a...

174
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:53,075
Please, struggle....

175
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:56,790
...until make your death taste
so much sweeter.

176
00:23:58,742 --> 00:24:02,042
- No!
- Yes, as in yes.

177
00:24:02,126 --> 00:24:03,587
You're going to die.

178
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,683
Bang! Just kidding.

179
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,009
Click, click.

180
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,099
No! That was my favourite gun.

181
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:27,795
What the hell is the matter with you?
Do your thing!

182
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,928
We need your big green friend
out here right frigging now!

183
00:24:30,998 --> 00:24:31,967
What?

184
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:33,063
No!

185
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:36,824
What do you mean, no?

186
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,292
Even if that was a good idea, I can't.

187
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:44,879
The transformation happens
when I feel angry or stressed.

188
00:24:45,887 --> 00:24:47,927
Now, they...
They must have drugged me.

189
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:52,148
Something's suppressing my adrenaline.
It comes from the cortex.

190
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,593
Maybe that will help speed things up.

191
00:25:00,577 --> 00:25:04,331
If you wanna cry now,
I say go for it.

192
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,812
Gaijin!

193
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:09,012
End of the line runt.

194
00:25:09,678 --> 00:25:13,880
- Got any last words?
- Yeah. Two.

195
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:22,415
Let's dance.

196
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,483
I've been waiting for this a long time.

197
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:36,058
Yeah, well you can keep waiting!

198
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,100
Banzai!

199
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:58,226
Dude, that is just not cool.

200
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:02,568
Wow! Look at that.

201
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:05,156
Could you give me a hand?

202
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:08,424
I'm kidding.
Alright, I'll go get it.

203
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:21,854
Alright, there we go.
No, that's... That's not right.

204
00:26:22,055 --> 00:26:23,124
What the hell?

205
00:26:26,898 --> 00:26:28,658
Oh god, now it's upside down.

206
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:39,790
There she is.

207
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:41,324
Sweet.

208
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:12,127
I'm gonna kill you!

209
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:35,241
Hulk smash claw people!

210
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:40,487
Oh, no! Why me?

211
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:16,322
The next one will be through
your brain stem, Logan-san.

212
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,917
Little man.

213
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,571
Hey!

214
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,455
Hey, I'm on your side
you flaming idiot.

215
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,250
Hey, wait for me!

216
00:28:53,612 --> 00:28:56,112
Who wants snacks?
You do.

217
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,248
Logan, I think we lost him.

218
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:13,250
And they lived happily ever after,
except the Hulk.

219
00:29:13,388 --> 00:29:16,500
Bub, you just made him angrier.

220
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:28,480
Talking man hurt Hulk!

221
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,668
Hulk rip-off talking man's head!

222
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,569
My head? Oh, crap.

223
00:29:37,851 --> 00:29:41,055
- He's all yours, Einstein.
- No, Logan. We're friends.

224
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:43,476
No, no!

225
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,481
Ugly girl scratch Hulk!

226
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:57,260
Go for it big guy, tear this whole
god forsaken place down to the ground.

227
00:32:00,926 --> 00:32:02,446
Do it!

228
00:32:26,063 --> 00:32:26,959
Great.

229
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,692
Alright Bub, where were we?

230

231
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,137
Guys?

232
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:38,709
Hey, Red! Deathstrike!

233
00:36:39,825 --> 00:36:42,600
I can't believe it.
I'm alive!

234
00:36:43,459 --> 00:36:45,861
I'm ali...

235
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,344
Ouch!
