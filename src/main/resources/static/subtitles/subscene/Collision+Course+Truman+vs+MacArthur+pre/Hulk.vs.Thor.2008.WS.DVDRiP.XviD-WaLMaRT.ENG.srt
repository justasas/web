1
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:26,153
<i>Outside of the world you know,
there exists the realm eternal...</i>

2
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:28,561
<i>...Asgard.</i>

3
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:32,018
<i>The shining light of the Nine Worlds.</i>

4
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:36,442
<i>Asgard is home to the gods.</i>

5
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:43,346
<i>All of whom bow down
before the all father...</i>

6
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:46,243
<i>...Odin.</i>

7
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:53,662
<i>Odin's life blood flows through Asgard,
and Asgard is Odin.</i>

8
00:01:54,476 --> 00:01:59,628
<i>His power is all and he keeps
the Asgardian realm safe.</i>

9
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:04,602
<i>But once each winter
the all father must rest...</i>

10
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:07,929
<i>...and enter the Odin sleep.</i>

11
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:14,291
<i>While Odin slumbers, his absence
leaves Asgard vulnerable.</i>

12
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:19,623
<i>And this is when the wicked
descend upon his kingdom.</i>

13
00:02:40,747 --> 00:02:44,306
<i>For seven days
an onslaught of trolls,...</i>

14
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:47,595
<i>...giants, dark elves and demons...</i>

15
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,985
<i>...seek to take control
of the Nine Worlds.</i>

16
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:56,474
<i>But they are
eternally defeated by him!</i>

17
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:03,798
<i>My arrogant, oafish,
brute of a step brother...</i>

18
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:05,969
<i>...Thor.</i>

19
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:16,068
I don't understand.

20
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,922
Where... Where am I?

21
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:32,091
Hear me, human.

22
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:36,506
You have been brought to Asgard,
because in all the universe...

23
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:43,098
...only you have ever brought
near defeat to the mighty Thor.

24
00:03:44,744 --> 00:03:48,744
What?
I... I couldn't.

25
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:54,800
Not thee, Bruce Banner.
You are but a snivelling, sad creature.

26
00:03:55,363 --> 00:04:00,436
I speak of your other half.
I speak of the Hulk.

27
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:07,427
There is one day left of the Odin sleep.
The cycle is nearly complete.

28
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:15,910
As always the Asgardians will emerge
victorious against the siege of darkness.

29
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:19,584
My brother will seek peace,
and then...

30
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,004
Then I shall destroy him.

31
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:43,657
Verily thee must say that was
far better than the last winter.

32
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:48,127
Tell us, Volstagg, are you going to
dispatch that troll beneath you...

33
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:50,363
...or you saving him for dinner?

34
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:56,278
That all depends on how much
mead I partake in.

35
00:04:56,313 --> 00:05:00,930
Did my ears deceive me?
Did Hogun the Grim make a joke?

36
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:03,429
And here we thought
you are still in a foul mood...

37
00:05:03,473 --> 00:05:05,677
...because you didn't
get to slay a frost giant.

38
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:09,392
I've still slain more than thee, Fandral.

39
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:12,686
Well we shall see
whom the maidens reward more.

40
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:28,667
In mere hours the all father will awaken
and then we may rejoice.

41
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:38,961
Your Lady Sif,
would know what vexes thee.

42
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:44,503
Aye, we won the day.
All is well in the realm of Asgard.

43
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:51,426
- But only until the next Odin sleep.
- It is, as it has always been.

44
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:54,967
We must learn to savour
the moments of peace.

45
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:57,126
And accept the cycle of death?

46
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,335
How many of our brothers and sisters
have fallen to this madness?

47
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,377
Must we be chained
to this eternal struggle?

48
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:06,850
Be careful what you wish for my love.

49
00:06:07,238 --> 00:06:11,135
When the cycle does break,
when things do change...

50
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,660
...then comes the end of days.
Then comes Ragnarok.

51
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:20,566
Perhaps our fates are not ours to choose.

52
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:25,313
Thee come, let us return to
my fathers palace...

53
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:27,082
...and prepare for his awakening.

54
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:36,899
Please, I'm begging you.
Don't do this.

55
00:06:37,134 --> 00:06:40,254
I've fought all my life
to keep the Hulk inside.

56
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:44,039
You don't know
the destruction he can cause.

57
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:52,117
Don't know? You fool.
I'm counting on it.

58
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:56,039
Look at you, so weak.

59
00:06:56,074 --> 00:07:00,853
Where it not for you inside the Hulk's mind,
suppressing his power...

60
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,990
...he would rule Midgard
with his rage.

61
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:07,633
I won't let him out.
I won't let you do this.

62
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,914
You won't let me?

63
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:13,170
How amusing you mortals are.

64
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:16,277
Now let me see if I recall correctly.

65
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:20,350
It is anger that unleashes the beast?

66
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:34,074
I seem to have forgotten
the frailty of mortals.

67
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:38,353
Look Amora, I do believe
he's going to weep.

68
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:05,369
No, that is impossible.

69
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,167
Now.

70
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:55,463
And so begins the end of Thor.

71
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:10,500
Oh, yeah. What do you think, thee Balder?
One last troll with dreams of conquest?

72
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:13,842
Perhaps.

73
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:22,528
Come Hogun, Fandral.

74
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:27,168
Let us given to this scoundrel
the gift of battle.

75
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:09,316
The creature's power is incredible.

76
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:13,263
Take care Loki.
My spell bonds you to the creature...

77
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:17,621
...and while you are master to it
I can feel him fighting you.

78
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:21,839
You have to listen to me.
It can't be controlled.

79
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,077
Do not try my patience worm.
Lest I turn my attentions to thee.

80
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:26,490
You are no troll, monster.

81
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:45,629
It is Balder's horn.
But this is not right.

82
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:50,264
- Asgard's enemies are all defeated.
- And yet the alarm has sounded.

83
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:52,992
Stay at Odin's side.

84
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:56,963
Should I fail to meet this threat,
you must protect him.

85
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:09,893
But if Thor should fall,
what hope has Asgard?

86
00:13:19,904 --> 00:13:23,097
You will have to kill me monster...

87
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:26,668
...for I shall not yield.

88
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:59,416
Thor, the creature like nothing
I've ever seen.

89
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:04,841
Aye, my friend.
This is no immortal evil that we face now.

90
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,859
The Hulk has come to Asgard.

91
00:14:20,374 --> 00:14:24,175
Dr. Banner, can you hear me
inside the beast?

92
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,499
Why have you come here?

93
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:34,604
Why to kill you of course,
dear step brother.

94
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:35,675
Loki?

95
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,901
I have waited an eternity for this.

96
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,340
To crush you with my bare hands.

97
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:50,811
To match your might.

98
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:54,305
To feel your life fade away...

99
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:57,693
...as my hands
wrap around your throat.

100
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:08,483
Never!

101
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:12,775
Come to your new master, Mjolnir...

102
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:15,348
...and let us smite my step brother.

103
00:16:15,598 --> 00:16:19,026
For there are none stronger than Loki now.

104
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:32,284
Rise cursed hammer!

105
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:35,881
Loki enough.
Your own rage fuels the beast.

106
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:38,002
I can feel the spell breaking.

107
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:43,837
I will have this hammer!

108
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:58,099
Neh, you will have it's thunder!

109
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:17,261
For Odin!
For Asgard!

110
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:37,669
The monster, it is raging carnage.
It has shattered the spell.

111
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,993
The Hulk is free.

112
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:55,626
Will thou yield, Loki?

113
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:20,139
Truly this is the best of both worlds.

114
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:24,302
I need not control the beast
to enjoy it's wrath.

115
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,619
Goodbye, brother.

116
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:30,032
This...
This is not what I wanted.

117
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:35,323
There's no going back Amora.

118
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:39,760
After all, if not for your
black broken heart...

119
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:41,973
...none of this
would have been possible.

120
00:18:46,362 --> 00:18:48,595
You don't know what you've done.

121
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,180
With no one to bring the Hulk in,
he'll tear down your entire world.

122
00:18:54,832 --> 00:18:59,900
I find your prattling useless mortal,
just as you are now useless to me.

123
00:19:56,548 --> 00:20:00,996
For Odin!
For Asgard!

124
00:21:16,087 --> 00:21:19,775
Thor, my love.

125
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:25,668
I... I was angered when you chose
Sif over me, I did not...

126
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:29,565
I wanted thou love, not your death.

127
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:34,240
Please.
Please come back to me.

128
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:47,109
- Amora?
- Yes my love?

129
00:21:56,876 --> 00:22:01,430
Where is Loki?

130
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:46,881
What is that monster doing?
He travels towards Odin.

131
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:59,629
Loki, I would have words with thee.

132
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:03,986
No, you were at Hela's door,
I defeated you.

133
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,236
You! You dare cross the god of...

134
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:36,184
The Hulk will be send back to Midgard
and then you will answer to Odin.

135
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:39,992
Fine, take the creature.
It provided me with amusement enough.

136
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:42,769
Seeing it pummel you nion to death.

137
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:46,435
Loki, you fool.
You killed him.

138
00:23:46,596 --> 00:23:48,196
Do you know what you've done?

139
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:53,226
Because the mortal died here,
Hela claimed his soul.

140
00:23:53,326 --> 00:23:56,253
Without his soul, I cannot
return him to Midgard.

141
00:23:56,407 --> 00:24:01,385
Without Bruce Banner,
the Hulk cannot leave Asgard.

142
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:39,258
Valkeries, warriors!
Your seats in Valhalla are promised.

143
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,849
Protect Odin with your lives!

144
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:46,139
For Asgard!

145
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,958
I saw the beast's eyes brother.

146
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:59,945
It will not stop until all of Asgard
is destroyed, until Odin is broken.

147
00:25:00,043 --> 00:25:03,015
You have brought a new Ragnarok
down upon us all.

148
00:25:04,364 --> 00:25:08,125
It's possible I made
a poor choice.

149
00:25:12,548 --> 00:25:17,099
Amora, I need you by Odin's side.
Protect him along with Lady Sif.

150
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,780
As you wish.

151
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:31,489
Loki, you will send whatever dark forces
you have left to battle the Hulk.

152
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:36,065
Then you and I,
we go out to help destiny.

153
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:54,010
Rest your weapons, shield men.

154
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:58,957
I've come to aid thee in Odin's defence,
at Thor's request.

155
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:03,818
His request you say?
More likely his penance, witch.

156
00:26:04,053 --> 00:26:07,073
No doubt he saw your hand
in this attack.

157
00:26:08,631 --> 00:26:12,439
A punishment more cruel
than you can imagine, cow.

158
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:44,584
Loki, the god of mischief
bids you death mortal creature.

159
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,640
Long have I wished
never to see this realm.

160
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:11,245
I always forget what a busy time
the Odin sleep is for my daughter.

161
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:14,495
Does thou see any newly arrived
friends here, brother?

162
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,653
Have a care, Loki,
lest thee stay here.

163
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,691
Where am I?

164
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:58,788
No, this doesn't make any sense.

165
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,722
Bruce?
Are you okay?

166
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:06,538
Betty?

167
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,480
I... I thought...
I don't understand.

168
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,820
- I was alone, and then...
- You're not alone Bruce.

169
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,520
Not any more.

170
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:23,612
Daddy!

171
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:29,911
Come play with me.

172
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Hail, Hela, goddess of the dead.

173
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,440
We seek an audience.

174
00:28:57,381 --> 00:29:02,122
The sons of Odin
risk much entering my realm.

175
00:29:02,665 --> 00:29:06,165
The Nine Worlds of Asgard
are in great peril, mistress...

176
00:29:06,285 --> 00:29:08,285
...including Hell and Niflheim.

177
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,800
A new Ragnarok is upon us
and we need your help.

178
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
We need Bruce Banner.

179
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,900
The mortal's soul is mine, Asgardian.

180
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:27,333
As yours nearly was this very day.

181
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,626
And may well be again.

182
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,523
You would risk everything
for the sake of one soul?

183
00:29:32,624 --> 00:29:35,836
Just as you would, Odin's son.

184
00:29:37,064 --> 00:29:41,994
But you do not have one soul daughter.
You have half a soul.

185
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:43,752
You have Bruce Banner.

186
00:29:43,852 --> 00:29:47,059
You need the Hulk
to complete your prize.

187
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,000
Are you alright?

188
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:37,293
I feel...
I feel great.

189
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:43,571
I can't imagine anything better.

190
00:30:47,087 --> 00:30:49,087
<i>Bruce Banner.</i>

191
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:06,195
<i>Awake from this dream.</i>

192
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:12,496
Betty?

193
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,855
Betty? Where are you?

194
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:22,996
The world of the living has need of you.

195
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:29,614
Who are you?
What do you want with me?

196
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,570
Not I, he.

197
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:36,540
Friend Banner,
for the sake of all of Asgard...

198
00:31:36,874 --> 00:31:38,949
...you must become the Hulk once more.

199
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:45,288
Betty? What?
Where? Where is...

200
00:31:47,689 --> 00:31:48,889
No.

201
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,510
No!

202
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:45,512
No. No, you can't ask me to do that.

203
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:48,702
I finally had peace.

204
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:51,716
You don't know what your asking.

205
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:56,121
Your time in Hell certainly has not
made you less of a worm, mortal.

206
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:32,136
Bruce Banner, I know
thee to be a man of honour.

207
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:34,365
I know thee to be a hero.

208
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:38,014
The lives at stake are not
your concern, not even human.

209
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:43,103
But I ask you anyway,
be that hero now.

210
00:33:47,218 --> 00:33:50,465
No, I can't.

211
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Die beast!

212
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,804
The Hulk's soul
is rightfully yours, daughter.

213
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:08,829
Take it, bring the Hulk to hell.

214
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:12,910
Merge the two halves
of his soul and claim him.

215
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:35,481
I will not force you to forsake
the rewards of the after life...

216
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:40,318
...but you must be whole.
- No, I won't.

217
00:34:41,028 --> 00:34:42,789
You don't understand.

218
00:34:54,282 --> 00:34:55,782
No!

219
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:45,467
Curse you Loki, for convincing me
to bring this creature to my realm.

220
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:49,121
Stay thy hand Hela.
We shall retrieve the Hulk.

221
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:53,304
We? The Hulk's fists have addled
your mind thunderer?

222
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,985
Fight with me brother, or die alone.

223
00:35:57,435 --> 00:36:00,635
Not much of a threat,
considering we're already in hell.

224
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:05,324
Have that thee!

225
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:03,206
My apologies.
I was enjoying the performance.

226
00:37:30,591 --> 00:37:33,663
Let them go.
I'm the one you want.

227
00:37:40,316 --> 00:37:41,516
Come on.

228
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:04,448
Hulk tired.

229
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:16,924
You called him weak, Loki.

230
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:21,244
But there is more strength and courage
in that man than you will ever know.

231
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:24,556
This soul is too dangerous
to keep in Hell...

232
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:27,642
...and to valuable to lose to Valhalla.

233
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:31,827
I will return him to Midgard.

234
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:41,343
Enough of this ridiculousness.

235
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:45,056
To think that Loki,
prince of darkness,...

236
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:48,229
...should waste his time
with defending Asgard.

237
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:54,535
Nay brother, we leave together.
For you still have much to answer for.

238
00:38:54,824 --> 00:38:58,063
Indeed you both do.

239
00:38:58,098 --> 00:39:01,082
For today Hela has relinquished a soul...

240
00:39:01,182 --> 00:39:04,378
...and she demands one in exchange.

241
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:08,979
You may try to take my soul death Goddess,
but I will make you fight for it.

242
00:39:09,158 --> 00:39:12,387
And your realm has suffered
much already this day.

243
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:21,062
You speak the truth.
So I shall take his soul instead.

244
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:22,063
What?

245
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:27,401
Thor!

246
00:39:27,512 --> 00:39:31,569
Thor, I've helped you. I...

247
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,690
- I could fight you for Loki's soul.
- Will you?

248
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:41,207
No.

249
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,470
He is my father.
His stay will not be eternal.

250
00:39:45,642 --> 00:39:51,242
But know this Odin's son,
your soul will be mine.

251
00:39:51,364 --> 00:39:53,618
And I will keep it forever.

252
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:57,488
Your fate is inescapable.

253
00:39:58,125 --> 00:39:59,825
We shall see.

254
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:39,826
Thus the cycle begins anew.

255
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:45,908
Asgard is safe once again,
defended to the end by it's heroes.

256
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:49,169
I am proud of each of you
that stand before me.

257
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:52,875
The day was saved by loyalty and sacrifice.

258
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,297
We honour those who fought beside us.

259
00:40:57,336 --> 00:40:59,974
Those who are know longer with us.

260
00:41:00,507 --> 00:41:04,628
And we defy those
who would see us brought to ruin.

261
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:11,208
And while the rewards of Valhalla
await all of Asgard's heroes,...

262
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:14,179
...this day we honour a hero of Midgard.

263
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:19,834
A mortal who sacrificed everything
for a land not his own.

264
00:41:22,382 --> 00:41:26,882
This day a human showed the gods
what legends are made of.

265
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:30,669
Hail the mortal, Bruce Banner.

266
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:48,039
