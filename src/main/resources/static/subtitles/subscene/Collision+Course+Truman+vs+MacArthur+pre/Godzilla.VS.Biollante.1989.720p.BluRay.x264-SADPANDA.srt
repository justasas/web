00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,870
I've found something!

12
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,880
Who's there? This area is off-limits!!

13
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,340
REPUBLIC OF SARADIA

14
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,220
Where are you going at
this time of night?

15
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,799
I have to go to the lab.

16
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,649
I just received a call saying that
the Godzilla cells have arrived.

17
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,630
They must be quick-frozen.
I'll be back for dinner.

18
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,099
You didn't have to come with me, Erika.

19
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,460
Dad, it's okay. You know you
can't do anything without me.

SARADIA INSTITUTE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY

21
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,760
See you later, Dad.
I'll meet you in the lab.

22
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,499
Erika!

23
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,799
Miki Saegusa, age 17...

24
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,799
She is the best psychic we have at the
Mental Science Exploration Center.

25
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,999
It has been shown
through numerous tests...

26
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,349
...that plants have their own
fields of mental energy.

27
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:05,299
It comes as no surprise, that we've finally
found someone who can communicate with them.

{\an8}FIVE YEARS LATER

29
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,799
Tell me doctor,

30
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,399
why do you suddenly wish to
hear the voice of a rose?

31
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
I guess it's a sign of old age.

32
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,499
I've lived here alone for
over five years now.

33
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,699
I guess solitude has given
me some strange ideas.

34
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,949
Has it really been five years?

35
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,949
Erika said that one day,

36
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,749
the desert would come to life,
carpeted with all kinds of wild flowers.

37
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,599
How is your father, Asuku?

38
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,699
He's fine.

39
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,700
His latest project is to start a bio-bank.
He's trying to get the Foundation to fund it.

40
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,999
Yes, I've heard of your father's project

41
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,449
and how he wants to preserve the
sperm of Nobel Prize winners

42
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,949
for the production of future geniuses.

43
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,999
There's been a lot of opposition to
his project, but it's still going ahead.

44
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,949
It won't be easy to get
his work accepted.

45
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:08,749
You see, those same kinds of attitudes
forced me to leave the country.

46
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,399
Some things haven't
changed in five years.

47
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,899
How did you do?

48
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,049
It wasn't any good. I got nothing.

49
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,349
We'll see you later.

50
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,149
Thanks for stopping by.

51
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,000
Did you hear something just now?

52
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,949
A girl was calling you, Asuka.
It was your name, I'm sure of it.

53
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,849
Goodbye...

54
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,399
Have you ever heard of a chimera?

55
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,099
Chimera?

56
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,549
It's a legendary monster
that breathes fire.

57
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,699
It's supposed to appear
from the ocean's depths,

58
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,499
causing storms and
destroying human beings.

59
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,850
It has a lion's head, a goat's
body and a dragon's tail.

60
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,649
But wasn't it a mythical creature?

61
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,499
If genetic engineers
keep playing with cells,

62
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,499
they may create their
very own chimera.

63
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,499
A new like form, totally
alien, and completely

64
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,299
different from what God
intended for earth.

65
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,999
Frightening, huh?

66
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,899
I understand how you
feel about my father's

67
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,299
work and many people are
against it as well.

68
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,099
But I can't help it if my father is the
head of the Ecology Foundation.

69
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,749
I don't see how our relationship
has anything to do with it.

70
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,649
You're right, but I'm still
uneasy about my work.

71
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,849
After all, the Foundation
supports the labs.

72
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:52,749
Yes, but that doesn't
affect our being together.

73
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,099
You act like Romeo,
from Shakespeare's play.

74
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,949
Well, you won't catch me
portraying your Juliet...

75
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,799
Massachusetts sent me an answer.
They want me to study there.

76
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,699
Asuka, will you come with me?

77
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,649
I don't know what to say...

78
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,650
I can't give you an answer now.

79
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,449
Last night, a series of violent tremors has shaken
the area around Mt. Mihara, on Oshima Island.

80
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,699
Early this morning, smoke has
been seen rising from the crater.

81
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,349
The Central Seismic Bureau is
monitoring the situation...

82
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,999
But at this stage, they are
unsure if a full eruption is likely.

83
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,899
I first heard it from two
children a few days ago.

84
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,599
Now, they all say they had the
same dream last night.

85
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,799
Did you?

86
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,199
It started a week ago,

87
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,299
and every night since then,
it has become more clear.

88
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,399
Well, have you finished?

89
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,799
Yes!

90
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,049
Well then, show us what
you've dreamed about!

91
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,549
Yes!

This is Gondo...

95
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,649
It's you, Colonel!

96
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,499
Yes, it's really exciting to wait
for a lizard that never shows up!

97
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,350
You must be joking, Colonel!

98
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,599
They must be trying to replace me!

99
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,799
The most exciting thing
that happens around here,

100
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,199
is betting on who kills
the most mosquitoes!

101
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,499
Sure! God only knows why I
accepted this assignment.

102
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,199
By the way... I called you because I
wanted to conduct some research,

103
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,749
and for that I'll need your cooperation.

104
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,849
I understand, tomorrow at 10:30.

105
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,749
Godzilla's awake!

PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE

109
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,499
I don't think the Prime
Minister believes her story.

110
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,599
No, of course not.
She's just a nobody.

111
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,099
If he started believing girls
talking about dreams and ESP...

112
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,049
...he wouldn't be Prime
Minister for too long.

113
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,449
So Gondo, do you believe
what she's saying?

114
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,849
The truth is, I hope it shows up...

115
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,799
If it doesn't,
I'll be out of a job...

...including ESP.

121
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,849
The army is really up to date.

122
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,899
- Aren't they?
- You've forgotten one thing.

123
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,899
- What's that?
- You didn't mention our bio-weapons.

124
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,799
Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria?

125
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,299
{\an8}TSUKUBA LABORATORY
OF BIOTECHNOLOGY

126
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,700
Already in the United States...

127
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,749
...they've created a bacteria
that can eat crude oil.

128
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,449
It's been successfully
tested on the oil spills.

129
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,099
Likewise... bacteria that
can eat nuclear material

130
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,299
has been developed by
our scientists here.

131
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,299
In case of a nuclear accident...

132
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,899
...the bacteria would clean
up any radioactive pollution.

133
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,999
It eats...nuclear material?

134
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:33,349
Of course, and that's why it would work against
Godzilla, who feeds upon nuclear energy.

135
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,199
Well, the situation isn't critical, yet.

136
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,799
True, an orange alert has been issued
and the bacteria must be readied...

137
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,099
But the bacteria wasn't meant
to be used as a weapon.

138
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,599
Not yet...

139
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,799
Well, the problem is that the bacteria can't
be produced in this laboratory on its own...

140
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,399
We need a Godzilla cell to create it.

141
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,399
A Godzilla cell?

142
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,299
Godzilla feeds on nuclear energy...

143
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,199
Somewhere in its cell structure, lies
a nuclear-digesting set of genes.

144
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,399
We need that set of genes
to make the bacteria.

145
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,049
So, you're saying that...

146
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,049
...something taken
from Godzilla's cells,

147
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,599
can be made into something
that can destroy it?

148
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,899
The Godzilla cells were
found five years ago.

149
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,299
They were collected by
an army special unit.

150
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,299
They're stored at the Okochi Foundation.

151
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,249
Will you need anything else, Doctor?

152
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,449
Just a few scientists...

153
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,699
I'm sorry to disappoint you, gentlemen,

154
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,799
but I vowed never to work
with Godzilla cells again.

155
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,799
I understand how you
must feel, Doctor...

156
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,999
...but it's vital for the defense
of our country against Godzilla.

157
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,599
My daughter was more important
to me than my country.

158
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,649
I lost her because of my
work with Godzilla cells.

159
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:59,449
Now, I have nothing left to live for.

160
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,649
Thank you, but I must refuse.

161
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,499
OKOCHI FOUNDATION

162
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,949
So, you're Dr. Kirishima?
My daughter has told me a lot about you.

163
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,149
I'm glad that we could finally meet.

164
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,949
My daughter also told me that you're
a little critical about our work here.

165
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,150
Extremely...

166
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,899
Well, at least you're honest.

167
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,699
However, I feel that you, like the other
scientists, don't know what I'm doing here.

168
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,499
I do realize the dangers involved,
after all, every coin has two sides...

169
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,649
In that case,

170
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,649
you must realize what kind of weapon
the Anti-Nuclear Bacteria would be.

171
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,749
Are you aware of it?

172
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,649
I know that it could neutralize
nuclear missiles.

173
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,299
Nuclear weapons would be
rendered useless overnight.

174
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,999
If we create that bacteria,
the balance of power...

175
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,300
Kirishima, reality is reality.

176
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,449
This Foundation now has the
technology to make that bacteria.

177
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,499
The superpowers of the world would do
anything to get hold of the Godzilla cells.

178
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,799
If any country succeeded, I'd have
to use force to recover the cells.

179
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,299
The same way the
AmErikan Bio-Major...

180
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,699
...attacked and destroyed
Shiragami's lab, 5 years ago.

181
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,399
The government decided
to store the Godzilla

182
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,399
cells here in this
vault as a precaution.

183
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,399
They would remain in here
and only be used...

184
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,799
...in case of a nuclear emergency
that would threaten the country.

185
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,699
And only under strict control!
But then, Godzilla came along...

186
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,399
...and the rest is history.

187
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,049
As for myself, I hate the idea
of the cells being locked up.

188
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,799
These are the Godzilla cells?

189
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,949
Japan was devastated by nuclear
bombs, and we now have Godzilla...

190
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:12,249
It's only fair that we use it as a weapon,
that will protect us from our enemies.

191
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,549
An earthquake?

192
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,299
A powerful eruption occurred at Mt. Mihara,
on Oshima Island, a short time ago...

193
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,199
It caused a series of tremors that
were felt throughout the Kanto region.

194
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,749
The eruptions are still occurring...

195
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,249
...throwing lava high into the night sky
and giving the scene an eerie glow...

196
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,099
I must do something, or Erika will die!

197
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,899
I see...

198
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,399
Dr. Shiragami, welcome to the team!

199
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,199
Thank you.

200
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,849
Shiragami has accepted the position?

201
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,299
Really? He's coming here tomorrow?

202
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,349
What?

203
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,799
Yes, on one condition.

204
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,749
He wants to keep the Godzilla
cells in his lab for seven days.

205
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,849
Of course, I told him it was okay.

206
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,399
So, what are you going to be doing?

207
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,050
Will you be creating the
bacteria with Dr. Shiragami?

208
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,599
Yes, to destroy Godzilla
when it returns.

209
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,799
It sounds as if you want
Godzilla to show up.

210
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,899
Maybe, but who knows if
Godzilla will ever appear again...

211
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,049
What if we create the bacteria,
and it's just a false alarm?

212
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,749
I'd be happy if I never
saw Godzilla again!

213
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,299
I'm not joking. We would have created
something as terrible as Godzilla.

214
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:33,649
I know that it's just a simple bacteria
we're creating via genetic engineering...

215
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,399
But, if the research continues
at its present course...

216
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,199
...genetic technology will produce
something far worse than Godzilla!

217
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,999
Kirishima...

218
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,899
If we don't produce this bacteria,
someone else is sure to do it!

219
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,399
Just look at what humans have done
in the past centuries and you'll see.

220
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,649
I know that! But our responsibility...

221
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,450
Kirishima, I don't believe you
understand science very well.

222
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,749
You can see there's not a lot of movement,
but something is happening down there!

223
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,399
{\an7}Alert Level 2:

224
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,499
In case any physical sign of G's action,
such as voice and motion is confirmed.

225
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,249
The Super-X2 has been substantially
improved with the installation of...

226
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,549
...the latest on-board supercomputer, that
controls automatic and remote functions.

227
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:12,699
It's also submersible, capable of operating
at such extreme depths as 10,000 meters.

228
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,999
Its armor is also the latest, TA-32.

229
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,199
It's twice as durable as the
titanium-alloy on the Super-X.

230
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,949
Right. This way, please.

231
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,449
That is called the Fire-Mirror.

232
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,399
It was completely constructed
with synthetic diamonds.

233
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,599
If the mirror is hit with
Godzilla's radioactive breath...

234
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,099
...it will return its
attack a thousand-fold.

235
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,899
Pretty powerful!

236
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,099
Yes, it is.

237
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,645
It's already started.

238
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,199
I've always been fascinated
with cell division.

239
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,399
Two cells in 30 minutes,
doubling to 4 in an hour...

240
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,400
32 cells in two hours.

241
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,899
In one day, 4 million cells.

242
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,099
Terrifying, isn't it?

243
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:35,999
This is Kirishima...

244
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,499
What?! Dr. Shiragami's lab?!

245
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,749
The bodies belong to two
of Bio-Major's agents.

246
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,749
They broke in to steal the
Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria data.

247
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,699
God only knows how they died...

248
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,499
Is this why you've been keeping the
Godzilla cells in your lab all this week?

249
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,149
During the experiment, I thought I
created an immortal plant species.

250
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,949
I gave it self-reproducing
abilities using Godzilla cells.

251
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,599
You did what?!

252
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,999
I thought...

253
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,899
I think I may have made a mistake.

254
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,149
"And demand that you turn over all
Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria data..."

255
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,949
"...to us no later than 2:00,
on Tuesday the 31st..."

256
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,049
"...or we will cause an explosion..."

257
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:59,049
"on Mt. Mihara that will destroy
it completely and free Godzilla."

258
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,549
It was faxed to us.
We received it this morning.

259
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,899
The name of the
organization is "ALIEN"?

260
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,299
Unbelievable...It's Bio-Major!

261
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,699
They're the only ones who would know
about the Anti-Nuclear Energy Bacteria.

262
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,999
Yeah, it's a bluff.

263
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,849
The Prime Minister?

264
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,399
He's been too busy and more worried
about the opposition parties than Godzilla.

265
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,849
Well, they're not bluffing.

266
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,699
That was a call from Mt. Mihara.

267
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,399
There was an explosion,
but it was just a warning.

268
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,249
A warning?

269
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:46,150
Read the rest, you'll understand.

270
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,849
There's more to the message.

271
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:56,449
"We've already made preparations
to prove that we mean business..."

272
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,299
"We shall set off a warning explosion by remote
control at 2:00, 24 hours before the deadline."

273
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,199
They're holding the entire
country for ransom!

274
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,550
And Godzilla is their hostage...

275
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,749
Slow down... This looks like the place.

276
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:26,249
Deliver the bacteria to Bio-Major?

277
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,249
I understand...

278
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,649
If that's what the
government has decided...

279
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,049
Whatever you say, sir.

280
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,649
Doctor...

281
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,149
You see? Science is just
another host for politicians.

282
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,549
So you're going to leave it to them?

283
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,299
We can't just sit here and do nothing!

284
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,599
Dr. Shiragami!

285
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,649
Come to the lake!

286
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,549
I don't believe it!

287
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,099
What you see is no ordinary plant.

288
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,199
That is Biollante.

289
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,999
Biollante?

290
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,349
The spirit of a plant that
appears in Norse mythology.

291
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,399
But that plant, has a human spirit.

292
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,549
A human spirit?

293
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,799
Doctor, I believe Erika's
spirit is in there!

294
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,099
How do you know?

295
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,699
I can hear her calling me.

296
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,649
Asuka, I'll need your help.

297
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,549
You did it.

298
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,849
You spliced one of Godzilla's cells...

299
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,599
...with one of the plant's cells.

300
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,599
Are you proud of this?

301
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,349
What kind of science do you call it?!

302
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,549
What was he doing?

303
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:10,149
He was crazy to start playing
with the Godzilla cells.

304
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,149
I don't know what scientists
are trying to do nowadays.

305
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,449
It's way beyond me.

306
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,099
You have it?

307
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,649
You'd better get moving, 'ALIEN".

308
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,399
The switch is in the container.

309
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,449
So, it's a double-cross?!

310
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,449
You damned idiot!
We've got to throw the switch!

311
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,899
There's no time left!

312
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,249
Saradia?

313
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,349
We've got to get this open!

314
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,749
I know! The key!

315
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,199
- He got away with the bacteria!
- Forget it! The switch is broken!

316
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,099
Amen!

317
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,999
{\an8}Alert Level 3:

318
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,999
In case G appears.

319
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,349
Godzilla is back again...

320
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,150
And we lose the
anti-nuclear energy bacteria.

321
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,099
I guess things are about
as bad as they can get.

322
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,399
Well, you miserable people of Tokyo...

323
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,099
I'm glad you tuned in,
because this show has...

324
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,849
We have a special report,
please stay tuned.

325
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:51,999
In the United States, new laws were...
Just a moment...

326
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,098
This just in...An explosion
has occurred on Mt. Mihara.

327
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,898
Godzilla has escaped
and is still at large.

328
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,399
So, Godzilla is back again?

329
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,949
Doctor, we must return to Tokyo!

330
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,049
Biollante is crying,

331
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,049
I can hear her.

332
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:20,049
The Coast Guard in the Tokyo Bay area...

333
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:23,349
...is warning the residents in Godzilla's
path and is evacuating the area.

334
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:28,550
We have just received these pictures.
Godzilla is slowly on the move.

335
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:34,974
It has left Oshima Island and is
heading in the direction of Tokyo.

336
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,599
{\an8}OPERATIONS CENTER SELF-DEFENSE AGENCY

337
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,299
Ansyaki has just been destroyed!

338
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,299
Control on standby,
awaiting instructions. Over.

339
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,648
At this rate, Godzilla will reach
Tokyo in 24 hours.

340
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,548
Super-X2, proceed to runway. Confirmed.

341
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,249
Super-X2, proceed to runway.

342
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:37,699
Colonel Kuruki reporting for duty, sir!

343
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,399
Super-X2 was assigned to me in
our operation against Godzilla.

344
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:49,224
I see you're from a
new youth-elite corp.

345
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:50,774
Yes, sir!

346
00:44:00,835 --> 00:44:03,634
All on-board systems showing
normal speed, Mach 1.

347
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:06,074
It will be arriving in ten minutes.

348
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,499
Switch to the X2 cameras.

349
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,599
Roger.

350
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:21,399
Activate the Fire-Mirrors.
Home in on the sensors.

351
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,199
Fire-Mirrors set, on.

352
00:45:31,425 --> 00:45:33,125
Godzilla is turning west!

353
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,974
Colonel Kuruki, a phone call for you.

354
00:45:35,975 --> 00:45:38,473
Seems Godzilla has given
up heading for Tokyo.

355
00:45:38,475 --> 00:45:40,974
Yes, this is Kuruki. Oh, it's you Gondo.

356
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,974
Should we sound the all-clear
for the Tokyo Bay area, sir?

357
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:47,374
What?! They stole the
anti-nuclear bacteria?!

358
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,699
Close all the airports?
I understand. Alright.

359
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,374
I recommend waiting before
giving the all-clear.

360
00:45:56,375 --> 00:46:00,724
Inform the press that we're still
fighting Godzilla in the Yuraga Channel.

361
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:03,924
Kuruki, are you suggesting
that we should lie?

362
00:46:08,625 --> 00:46:11,224
This is an announcement for the
airport management office.

363
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:13,499
The airport is closing down
and shall be evacuated

364
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,324
due to the advance of
Godzilla off Tateyama.

365
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:22,274
All flights have been cancelled.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

366
00:46:22,725 --> 00:46:25,924
Here is a late-news bulletin.

367
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:28,649
Godzilla has stalled its advance and is
stationary between Miura and Tateyama.

368
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:35,749
Haneda and the regional airports have been
closed to all traffic further notice.

369
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,649
Standby for the next update in one hour.

370
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,599
The agent's car has been spotted!

371
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,224
He's on the Tomei highway, heading west!

372
00:46:53,225 --> 00:46:54,424
Tomei?

373
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,749
Where could he be going?

374
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:02,049
Saradian National Oil Corporation.

375
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:05,849
The only company the Saradians
have in the country

376
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,459
and a front for their spying activities.

377
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:12,599
Based in Osaka and managed
by an ex-secret agent of theirs.

378
00:47:14,275 --> 00:47:17,774
Every week, a freighter in
Kobe leaves for Saradia.

379
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,009
So you think they'll
smuggle it out by sea?

380
00:47:23,775 --> 00:47:26,899
If we could retrieve the bacteria,
we can defeat Godzilla.

381
00:47:27,825 --> 00:47:31,953
Then, we'll have an almost
endless supply of Godzilla cells.

382
00:47:33,825 --> 00:47:36,625
I see, but Dr. Shiragami is...

383
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:39,674
Dr. Shiragami...

384
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:43,874
Excuse me, I'm from TNN TV.

385
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:46,374
I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

386
00:47:47,025 --> 00:47:50,199
I've heard that your experiment
successfully combined the

387
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,474
cells of a plant with Godzilla
cells to create a super-plant.

388
00:47:53,475 --> 00:47:54,474
Dr. Shiragami!

389
00:47:55,975 --> 00:48:00,199
You people always criticize scientific experiments
without understanding their true value.

390
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,799
Scientists must look toward the future!

391
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,449
It's no longer Erika's spirit, Doctor.

392
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,949
I can't read it anymore. I'm shut out.

393
00:48:24,825 --> 00:48:26,424
Then Biollante is...

394
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,550
Biollante is just a cross
between a plant and Godzilla.

395
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:37,749
- What is it?
- Godzilla?

396
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:43,424
Godzilla!

397
00:48:43,425 --> 00:48:45,074
Biollante is calling for Godzilla!

398
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:55,074
Godzilla is turning north toward Adowara.
What shall I do, sir?

399
00:48:55,075 --> 00:48:57,474
Keep it in the water,
away from the coast.

400
00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:00,749
Understood...
Begin underwater attack.

401
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:56,924
The mirror's reflection
rate has dropped to 40%.

402
00:49:56,925 --> 00:49:59,274
The Fire-Mirror is melting!

403
00:49:59,275 --> 00:50:01,374
We can't control the lasers as well!

404
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:03,724
Incredible!

405
00:50:03,725 --> 00:50:07,149
The mirror is heat-proof,
but not like the TA-32 armor.

406
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,949
Switching to missile attack.

407
00:50:29,675 --> 00:50:30,849
It's out of control!

408
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:33,248
I think Super X-2 is out of action.

409
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,850
Can you bring it home?

410
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,799
I'll try my best.

411
00:50:40,775 --> 00:50:46,424
Godzilla has finally landed on the east
coast and is heading toward Lake Hashi.

412
00:50:46,425 --> 00:50:50,124
Repeating, Godzilla has landed on the
coast and is heading toward Lake Hashi.

413
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,673
The 31st and 34th regiments have
arrived at the southern end of the lake...

414
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:20,374
They are taking up defensive positions.

415
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:13,424
Doctor!

416
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:15,523
Get inside, it's too dangerous out here!

417
00:52:15,525 --> 00:52:17,424
Miki, hurry! Doctor!

418
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,899
What's going on?

419
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,874
Our opponent thinks it will win easily.

420
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,499
I wonder...

421
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,699
Did Godzilla come to
see Biollante because

422
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,200
it knew they were made
from the same cells?

423
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,723
Yes, it's possible...

424
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:16,574
They're both from the same family.

425
00:53:16,575 --> 00:53:18,174
More than just the same family...

426
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,599
They're both made from
the same cells.

427
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:23,798
They're identical, two of a kind.

428
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,399
Not brother and sister,
they're the same creature.

429
00:54:00,175 --> 00:54:01,174
Biollante is dying!

430
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,799
Godzilla's attack must have had an
abnormal effect on Biollante's cell division.

431
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,199
I guess it's not immortal after all.

432
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,599
Godzilla is in Sagami Bay?

433
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,700
So, it's out to sea?

434
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,899
Yes, we're trying to fix it.

435
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,199
Sure...Right.

436
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:17,624
Well?

437
00:57:18,825 --> 00:57:20,623
The computers tested out okay.

438
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:23,673
The remote control needs to be
replaced, but that's expected.

439
00:57:23,675 --> 00:57:25,774
However, the fire mirror is out of action.

440
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:29,799
We can patch up the armor,
but the fire mirror is a problem.

441
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,898
Can't you fix it?

442
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,999
It's badly deformed in too many areas.

443
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,848
Godzilla's melted a mirror
of synthetic diamond!

444
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,949
That's beyond our technological limits!

445
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,749
This is Chopper Three,
no signal on radar or sonar.

446
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,500
This is Chopper One,
Godzilla is nowhere to be found.

447
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,849
Roger...All units standby.

448
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,698
I want another sweep of Saraga
Bay and the surrounding area.

449
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,899
Understood.

450
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:58,649
If we lose Godzilla this time,
we won't have another chance.

451
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,649
We are currently over the sea...

452
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:06,798
We will continue to search the bay and
coastal areas for as long as possible.

453
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,673
Roger...

454
00:58:07,675 --> 00:58:11,674
Continue your search pattern
at reference point 4-2-0-9-6-4.

455
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:21,049
Doctor...

456
00:58:27,175 --> 00:58:28,174
Miss Okochi,

457
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:31,224
Colonel Kuruki wants you on the phone.

458
00:58:31,225 --> 00:58:33,499
Is it possible that Miki
can detect Godzilla

459
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,799
under water the way she
did at the volcano?

460
00:58:44,525 --> 00:58:48,323
I'm low on fuel. If we go any further,
we won't make it back to Tokyo.

461
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:50,999
- A little further, please.
- Okay, we'll head for Osaka.

462
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:51,999
Okay.

463
00:58:53,925 --> 00:58:57,424
It's here, below us! It's moving slowly.

464
00:59:05,425 --> 00:59:08,274
Godzilla is heading west,
100 kilometers off Hamamatsu.

465
00:59:08,275 --> 00:59:11,399
The last time Godzilla attacked,
it ate a lot of nuclear material...

466
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,699
...from an atomic plant to store energy.

467
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:19,423
This time it doesn't have a
supply of nuclear material...

468
00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:23,475
...and its battles with X2 and
Biollante used up a lot of its energy.

469
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,574
Do you think it will head
for an atomic plant?

470
00:59:26,575 --> 00:59:28,899
Yes. What plants are nearest to it?

471
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:39,149
There's one at Maizuru, one at Obana,
and there are three at Tsuruga.

472
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:43,898
That makes five total, a third
of all the plants in Japan.

473
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,123
If Godzilla went that way...

474
00:59:46,125 --> 00:59:48,925
It would be a disaster if even
one of those plants is destroyed!

475
00:59:49,425 --> 00:59:52,724
Judging by Godzilla's latest position,
the nearest one would be here.

476
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:55,824
Nagoya!

477
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:00,248
We must organize our defenses.
Send a message...

478
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,024
I want Super-X2 sent into the bay.

479
01:00:02,025 --> 01:00:04,049
I want air cover at
all times, and ground

480
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,890
troops on the three
peninsulas around the bay.

481
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:11,874
Here, is where we'll launch
our attack against Godzilla.

482
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:51,049
An all-out attack at Ise Bay?

483
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,449
Godzilla is just as likely to
come from Wakasa Bay.

484
01:00:55,825 --> 01:00:59,324
What if they send everyone
in and it doesn't show?

485
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:05,625
It's an interesting question,
but an important one.

486
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,199
22nd and 23rd battalion,
prepare to move into position.

487
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,699
- Immediate mobilization.
- Godzilla has surfaced!

488
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,299
It's heading for Osaka!

489
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:28,248
- Send Super-X2 after it.
- Understood.

490
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,823
Send the fleet to the
channel for battle.

491
01:01:29,825 --> 01:01:30,924
Understood!

492
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:34,973
We must close the expressway
and send all troops to Osaka.

493
01:01:34,975 --> 01:01:36,798
It's too late. There's no time for that.

494
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,149
I know it's too late,
but what else can we do?!

495
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:41,949
We must move all troops along
the Mishimi expressway...

496
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:44,299
...to prepare for a counterattack
in Wakasa against Godzilla.

497
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,499
If we go to Osaka,
we won't have a chance...

498
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,673
But, if we go to Wakasa,
we might be able to beat it.

499
01:01:49,675 --> 01:01:53,699
- What happens to Osaka?!
- My mission is to defeat Godzilla!

500
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,098
Its advance on Osaka
must be delayed.

501
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,399
You'll have to evacuate Osaka.

502
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:03,499
Contact Miss Okochi in Osaka.

503
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,499
Yes, sir!

504
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,599
KANSAI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
CONSTRUCTION BASE

505
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:50,899
Miki!

506
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:56,824
Leave here, please!

507
01:02:56,825 --> 01:02:59,423
It's too dangerous! Please do as I ask!

508
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:02,108
- We were ordered to stay with you!
- I insist! Hurry and get away!

509
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:39,274
What is this, telepathy?
It's all in her mind!

510
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:42,673
It's absurd to think she
can defeat Godzilla!

511
01:03:42,675 --> 01:03:45,023
This girl has been a great help to us.

512
01:03:45,025 --> 01:03:48,223
She might be able to delay
Godzilla's landing in Osaka!

513
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:50,424
I trust her ESP ability.

514
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:10,249
Miki!

515
01:05:37,025 --> 01:05:39,224
The Navy has made it to the channel.

516
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:43,998
- Sir, the naval force--
- They'll never make it.

517
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,899
It's too close to Osaka for
them to use their cannons.

518
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,899
{\an7}Alert Level 4:

519
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,899
In case G's landing on any
specific coast of Japan.

520
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:19,673
Ladies and Gentlemen, we must cancel
the concert due to an emergency.

521
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:22,398
Godzilla is approaching Osaka!

522
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,699
Please follow the Marshall’s
instruction and evacuate the building!

523
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:34,449
Godzilla is expected to arrive
in Osaka from Osaka Bay.

524
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:37,948
All civilians are required
to evacuate in accordance

525
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:41,450
with the instructions they
receive on radio and TV.

526
01:06:41,975 --> 01:06:45,774
Evacuate calmly and do not panic.

527
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:47,849
Repeating...

528
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,699
Godzilla is expected to arrive
in Osaka from Osaka Bay.

529
01:06:53,225 --> 01:06:55,299
All civilians are required
to evacuate in accordance

530
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,399
with the instructions they
receive on radio and TV.

531
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:24,649
Is anyone here?

532
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,799
What do you want?

533
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,899
We're criminals...

534
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,499
Yeah, we're robbing this place.

535
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,499
And you...

536
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,499
There's only one way
to deal with his kind.

537
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:54,699
Run!

538
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,848
Godzilla is passing the
north side of Osaka park.

539
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,549
It's heading for the business district!

540
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:20,749
Colonel Gondo has just left
with a loaded ANB Rocket Gun.

541
01:10:20,751 --> 01:10:22,700
- He's on his way, sir.
- Good...

542
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,799
SuperX-2?

543
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,600
It's waiting at the business district.

544
01:11:05,025 --> 01:11:06,024
Let's go!

545
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:39,449
- Let's go!
- Right!

546
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,124
Attack Godzilla from the front.

547
01:12:46,125 --> 01:12:48,324
Try to lure it over to the
tall building on its right.

548
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,999
Can you do that without
using the Fire-Mirror?

549
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,999
Ready missiles and Gatling-guns!

550
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,499
I'll do my best...

551
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:20,825
Good! Keep it going!

552
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:23,624
We're out of missiles!

553
01:15:02,825 --> 01:15:05,348
Colonel Gondo and his bazooka
troop are in position!

554
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:06,549
A little more...

555
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:08,899
Ready the Fire-Mirror.

556
01:15:09,975 --> 01:15:10,974
What did you say?

557
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,524
The Fire-Mirror isn't
functioning properly!

558
01:15:12,525 --> 01:15:14,524
Godzilla's not in the
proper position yet!

559
01:15:45,825 --> 01:15:46,824
Fire!

560
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,599
We did it!

561
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,099
Okay, pull out!

562
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,298
Come in, Colonel! Colonel Gondo!
Godzilla is approaching your position!

563
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,999
Repeat, Godzilla is approaching
your position! Come in, Colonel!

564
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:44,449
All of this intravenous
stuff is bad for you, Godzilla!

565
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,694
Gondo!

566
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:28,199
After landing in Osaka and
devastating the city...

567
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:31,298
...Godzilla has moved north
to the Tappa mountains.

568
01:17:33,075 --> 01:17:37,774
She used as much energy as Godzilla.
It's no wonder why she's exhausted.

569
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:40,349
She shouldn't have done it.
She could have died...

570
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:48,749
Yes?

571
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,699
- It's a call for Mr. Kirishima.
- He'll be right there.

572
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:53,149
Thanks.

573
01:17:58,725 --> 01:17:59,724
Oh, Kuruki...

574
01:18:01,675 --> 01:18:04,424
Right...Right...

575
01:18:04,425 --> 01:18:06,449
It's been over fourteen hours now...

576
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:09,099
There still doesn't seem to be
any change in Godzilla yet.

577
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:12,500
If the bacteria doesn't work in the
next eight hours, we've had it.

578
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:16,939
Is that right? I understand...
I'll get a chopper and see you in Tokyo.

579
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:25,048
The Anti-Nuclear Bacteria should take
effect within six to twelve hours.

580
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,848
On the average, it's only eight hours.

581
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:29,098
I don't understand why
nothing's happened yet.

582
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,274
Maybe Godzilla is too large
for the dose we gave it.

583
01:18:31,275 --> 01:18:34,899
No, one should have been enough,
and Godzilla got three.

584
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:38,173
One of them was fired in its mouth!
The dose was lethal...

585
01:18:38,175 --> 01:18:39,174
I don't understand it.

586
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,299
Neither do I...

587
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,048
Just up-- right there.
Get to the biochemistry lab.

588
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:48,974
Ice blocks...?
The refrigeration is off.

589
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:51,673
When Godzilla attacked yesterday,
it destroyed the power plant.

590
01:18:52,175 --> 01:18:54,774
The hospital's generators
couldn't handle it.

591
01:18:57,175 --> 01:18:58,174
What's wrong?

592
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,299
I wonder...

593
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:05,449
Godzilla's temperature?

594
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:08,474
Yes, I think it has a
low body temperature.

595
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,999
Is that important?

596
01:19:10,575 --> 01:19:15,174
We have no data concerning Godzilla's
body temperature, so we don't know.

597
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:17,449
But, why?

598
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:21,098
Bacteria breeds slower
in low temperatures,

599
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:23,699
so the lower the temperature,
the slower the reaction.

600
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:29,774
You mean the bacteria won't work
because it's a cold-blooded creature?

601
01:19:29,775 --> 01:19:31,099
Yes, it's possible.

602
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,299
So, if we can raise
Godzilla's temperature...

603
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:35,299
Yes, but how...?

604
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:38,612
The M-6000 TC system.

605
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:39,949
Kuruki!

606
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,274
TC system?

607
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,948
Thunder-control system.
It creates artificial thunder...

608
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:48,149
...causing high frequency waves
to create clouds, then heat.

609
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,223
Like a giant microwave oven!

610
01:19:50,225 --> 01:19:53,724
Kuruki, we can't use that system
since it's still in its research stage!

611
01:20:02,175 --> 01:20:05,174
Tower One to base. Silver-Iodine
seeding is completed.

612
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,399
Expect clouds in two hours.

613
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:17,399
The ground troops
are nearly in position!

614
01:20:21,425 --> 01:20:22,424
Go!

615
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,724
B-4 installation, ready!

616
01:20:33,575 --> 01:20:35,448
B-8 installation, ready!

617
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:37,950
F-2 installation, ready!

618
01:20:38,925 --> 01:20:40,398
Mobile war room...

619
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:43,799
...installation of all 100 generators
should be done within the hour.

620
01:21:17,075 --> 01:21:19,624
It's hard to believe by
looking at his face...

621
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,424
...that he has such a huge
responsibility on his shoulders.

622
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,524
I guess it's time for my
generation to step down.

623
01:21:28,525 --> 01:21:30,425
From now on, it's up to you guys.

624
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,323
There's nothing special
about our generation.

625
01:21:35,325 --> 01:21:37,225
We make mistakes, just like everyone.

626
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:49,250
All units now coming out, sir

627
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:43,899
Godzilla has reached Wakasa Bay!
Godzilla approaching--

628
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,499
The generators have been completed.
Now, they have to be charged.

629
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:47,499
Good.

630
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,699
TC System, standby.

631
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:45,049
Godzilla is entering the TC field!

632
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:46,499
B-2!

633
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,099
You see? That must have raised
its temperature a little!

634
01:25:09,575 --> 01:25:10,749
How hot is that?

635
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:12,649
So hot, it could melt
an A-1 tank easily!

636
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:15,098
Godzilla's gone outside the TC field!

637
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:16,923
Keep it in! It must not escape!

638
01:25:16,925 --> 01:25:18,924
Understood! Commence firing!

639
01:25:47,150 --> 01:25:49,123
- It's back in the field now!
- Good.

640
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:50,124
G-4!

641
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,599
Doctor?

642
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:08,799
You better start hoping
this idea will work.

643
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,999
If we can get Godzilla's temperature
high enough, the bacteria should work.

644
01:26:24,325 --> 01:26:26,449
Konaki, what should we do?

645
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:28,449
Contact Yohama, the nuclear plant.

646
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:29,949
Yes, sir!

647
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,248
Takahama plant?
This is an emergency.

648
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:34,773
What are you two doing here?!

649
01:26:34,775 --> 01:26:36,774
Biollante is still alive! Ask Miki!

650
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:37,949
What?!

651
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:39,448
- Godzilla!
- Chopper force, maintain position.

652
01:26:39,450 --> 01:26:40,872
Kamatsu Bay, stand by to scramble.

653
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,049
It's working!
The bacteria's spreading!

654
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,599
It's true!

655
01:26:58,500 --> 01:26:59,699
Bring in the helicopters.

656
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:15,649
This is incredible!

657
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:17,398
Line three, move in.

658
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,123
Could Godzilla be immune
to the bacteria?

659
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:21,324
It isn't possible!

660
01:29:05,975 --> 01:29:06,974
Miki!

661
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:11,049
Hey, where are you going?

662
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:16,386
- Hey, where is she going?
- I don't know! Come on!

663
01:29:16,388 --> 01:29:18,024
It's dangerous! Stay here!

664
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:53,898
What's going on?

665
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,399
Something's jamming the system!

666
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,299
Biollante...

667
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,399
Biollante...

668
01:31:10,075 --> 01:31:11,374
She's evolving!

669
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:14,799
Biollante...

670
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:47,999
Look at Godzilla!

671
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,299
The bacteria has taken effect!

672
01:35:14,675 --> 01:35:17,274
Congratulations, Dr. Shiragami!

673
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,499
One day, we'll put all of
this to good use.

674
01:35:21,275 --> 01:35:23,724
Now we have to isolate
samples of the genes,

675
01:35:23,725 --> 01:35:25,524
and put them into production at once.

676
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:33,624
I'm not continuing my work on bacteria.

677
01:35:33,625 --> 01:35:35,625
Biollante has convinced me of that.

678
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:37,349
What's the matter?

679
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:40,399
You must continue your work, doctor.

680
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:43,949
You've got all the Godzilla
cells you'll ever need!

681
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,199
Godzilla and Biollante aren't monsters,

682
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:50,774
it's the arrogant scientists
that create them.

683
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:55,624
Biollante!

684
01:36:48,775 --> 01:36:49,774
Thank you...

685
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:55,249
Biollante said it.

686
01:36:58,300 --> 01:36:59,299
Erika!

687
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:07,249
Doctor!

688
01:37:16,525 --> 01:37:17,524
It's him!

689
01:39:20,475 --> 01:39:22,174
You look like Hell.

690
01:39:23,825 --> 01:39:24,824
How is the doctor?

691
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,199
The water must have
lowered its temperature!

692
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:08,249
Godzilla's going back to the sea...
Biollante has gone to the sky.

693
01:40:09,175 --> 01:40:11,174
And this lucky couple
is going to America!

694
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,499
Thanks, but I'm not going to America.

695
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:17,673
Why not?

696
01:40:17,675 --> 01:40:20,349
Because wherever you go,
people are the same.

697
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:22,449
There's good and bad in every country.

698
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:25,050
Then, where will you go?

699
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:27,099
First...

700
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:31,449
...to bed, I think.
I haven't slept for days!

701
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:33,900
Shall we go together?

702
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:36,100
From here on?

703
01:40:37,175 --> 01:40:38,174
Always!

704
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:40,800
How long have we been
living in such an age?

705
01:41:42,650 --> 01:41:44,998
Maybe it started when man...

706
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,499
first stepped out of the Garden of
Eden, and left his innocence behind.

707
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:54,799
Man would do well to
remember this day, forever.
