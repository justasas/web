2
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,877
Prepare Nautilus
for orbit capture.

3
00:00:31,436 --> 00:00:34,146
Computer:
Orbit capture trajectory confirmed.

4
00:00:34,314 --> 00:00:35,898
Engage main thrusters.

5
00:00:39,569 --> 00:00:43,572
Disengaging artificial gravity
for Mercury approach.

6
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,742
Someone forget
to secure their tablet?

7
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,952
Oh.

8
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:51,121
Remind me to fire the maid.

9
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:00,048
Computer:
Approaching coordinates.

10
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:03,843
- Awaiting manual override.
- All right, Natalie.

11
00:01:05,387 --> 00:01:08,222
Manual flight
controls engaged.

12
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:14,520
We're going in.

13
00:01:31,455 --> 00:01:34,207
Computer:
Warning, solar event detected.

14
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:36,876
What's happening?

15
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:41,297
We have an electromagnetic
radiation spike, a big one.

16
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:43,341
- Are we within safe levels?
- So far.

17
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,572
- Lee, stay on course.
- Entering orbit in 20 seconds.

18
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:05,588
Computer: Warning...

19
00:02:07,174 --> 00:02:09,884
- radiation shields activated.
- What the hell was that?

20
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:12,721
Radiation levels
are spiking off the charts.

21
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:14,222
Abort orbit capture.

22
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,099
- Lee, get us out of here.
- Roger that.

23
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,814
Engaging artificial gravity.

24
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:27,235
Computer: Alarm,

25
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:29,904
- system failure.
- Everything is spiking.

26
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:32,782
- Heat, magnetics--
- Magnetics, that can't be.

27
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,951
- Are you sure?
- That's what l'm reading.

28
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:39,622
- lncrease thrusters to maximum.
- Come on, darlin'.

29
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:48,381
Hang in there.

30
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:56,473
Computer: Warning,
radiation levels at maximum.

31
00:02:58,184 --> 00:02:59,685
My God.

32
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:12,322
Computer: Alarm, system failure.

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,658
Damage report!

00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:18,662
System failures across the board.
l can't hold anything online.

35
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:31,508
Computer: Alarm, system failure.

36
00:03:31,676 --> 00:03:34,845
- Losing power to engines.
- Victoria, check out backup systems.

37
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:36,805
l'm on it.

38
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:39,308
There's a fire in the comm.

39
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:41,310
Computer: Warning,
engine power critical.

40
00:03:41,477 --> 00:03:43,478
Come on.

41
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,317
No!

42
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,534
Chaos.

43
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,607
Destruction.

44
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:13,860
Unpredictability.

45
00:04:22,953 --> 00:04:24,662
Our universe...

46
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:27,373
is a dangerous place.

47
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:30,668
ln our solar system,
there are over

48
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:33,296
a thousand asteroids
and comets

49
00:04:33,464 --> 00:04:36,132
that are classified
as threatening to hit the earth.

50
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:40,595
But you should also know

51
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:43,639
that those are just the ones
we know about.

52
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:47,894
Just last year,
an asteroid

53
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,855
200 feet in diameter

54
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:53,649
passed within
40,000 miles of us.

55
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:56,235
Now in planetary terms,

56
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,404
that is like, uh--

57
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:01,532
it's like someone
shooting at you

58
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,285
and having a bullet
part your hair

59
00:05:05,913 --> 00:05:08,164
without touching your skin.

60
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:12,877
Now, if it had hit us,

61
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:17,548
it would have exploded
with the force of a hydrogen bomb.

62
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:20,301
Do you know how much
advance warning we had?

63
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:25,014
Three days.

64
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,811
The good news is,
we have the technology

65
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:33,648
to deflect these objects.

66
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:35,858
lt's called Project 7.

67
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:38,611
The most advanced,
most powerful,

68
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:41,447
most ambitious planetary
defense system

69
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:42,907
ever conceived.

70
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:45,660
lt's equipped
with an energy field

71
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:48,412
that allows it to deflect objects
many times its size.

72
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,915
The bad news?

73
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,501
There's always bad news.

74
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:56,754
Our government pulled funding
from Project 7

75
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:58,548
just before it came online.

76
00:05:58,715 --> 00:06:02,218
So right now
it floats dormant in space.

77
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:08,057
The earth's been struck before,
it'll be struck again.

78
00:06:09,977 --> 00:06:12,103
The only question

79
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,397
is whether
we're gonna be ready.

80
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:17,900
Do your part
in protecting the planet.

81
00:06:18,068 --> 00:06:20,570
Write to your congressman,
tell your friends.

82
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,906
Spread the word.

83
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,035
Our lives may depend on it.

84
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:32,608
We need Project 7.

85
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:34,551
You.

86
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:36,637
You need Project 7.

87
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:40,724
Thank you very much.

88
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:44,144
Dr. Preston, Brad Walker.

89
00:06:44,312 --> 00:06:46,271
Your liaison officer
with Mission Ops.

90
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,190
Can l speak with you
for a moment?

91
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:51,693
- Yeah.
- As you know, it is our policy

92
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:55,280
to, uh, notify
family members immediately

93
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,658
of any situation involving
the mission that may arise.

94
00:06:57,826 --> 00:07:00,661
- l know the protocol.
- Now, l've been sent here

95
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,455
to make sure you don't hear
anything through the media

96
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,833
that may make you worry
unnecessarily.

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,169
Now, having said that, um,

98
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:13,006
early this morning, we did
lose contact with the Nautilus.

99
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:15,968
Dr. Preston.
Dr. Preston, wait.

100
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:18,095
Dr. Preston.

101
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,899
Dr. Preston: Come on, pick up.

102
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,778
Recording: We're sorry,

103
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:36,697
your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

104
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:38,866
Please check the number
and dial again...

105
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,784
- Damn it!
- ...or call your oper--

106
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,708
Okay.

107
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:49,793
All right.

108
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,390
- Hello?
- Hey, it's James.

109
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,476
l can't talk to you.
l'm at work.

110
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:08,562
- lf Edward finds out--
- l'm worried about Victoria.

111
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,647
Today was orbit capture.

112
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:14,151
They lost contact with the Nautilus.
l can't reach Mission Ops.

113
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,111
Do you know anything?

114
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,780
l don't, but Houston
doesn't call the military

115
00:08:18,948 --> 00:08:20,824
every time they have a glitch.
You know that.

116
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:23,577
lt's probably nothing.
l'm sure Victoria's fine.

117
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:27,581
l know you have eyes in the sky.
Just check it out for me, okay?

118
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:29,583
Call me back
if you find anything.

119
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:31,877
You know l can't talk to you
about this stuff.

120
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,670
Edward doesn't even like
that we're friends.

121
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:40,052
- What the hell?
- What?

122
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:45,182
Jennifer, did SPEAR
just activate Project 7?

123
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,184
What are you talking about?
lt's dead.

124
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:48,352
lt's been dead for three years.

125
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,855
Oh, uh, it's sending me data.

126
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:54,024
Jennifer:
lt's sending data to you?

127
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:55,651
lf Edward finds out that
you've been monitoring it,

128
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:57,778
he'll throw you in jail so fast
that you won't know--

129
00:08:57,946 --> 00:09:01,114
Okay, uh, something weird
is happening.

130
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:04,785
Project 7
is picking up a strange--

131
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:10,707
Hello?
Hello?

132
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,169
Okay.

133
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:19,132
Oh, that's impossible.

134
00:10:00,952 --> 00:10:03,370
- Status report.
- The EM wave knocked out

135
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:05,956
virtually every civilian satellite
and most government ones as well.

136
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:07,499
We're the only major agency

137
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:10,210
fully functioning right now.

138
00:10:10,378 --> 00:10:13,255
- But that's not our only problem.
- Three sets of images,

139
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:15,424
all pulled from
the deep-sky orbital telescope

140
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:17,217
before it went down
completely.

141
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:19,261
These were all taken
only five minutes apart.

142
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:20,929
What's that spot?

143
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:23,849
That spot, sir,

144
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:26,226
- is Mercury.
- That can't be right.

145
00:10:26,394 --> 00:10:28,645
- That would mean that--
- Mercury's on the move.

146
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:31,106
- How's that possible?
- We don't have all the data yet.

147
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:33,275
We still don't know.

148
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:36,611
Figure out where it's headed.

149
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,363
l want to know if that thing
is coming anywhere near us.

150
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,532
Jennifer:
We're already on it.

151
00:10:57,884 --> 00:11:00,010
Marshall?

152
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:02,137
Oh, thank God.

153
00:11:02,305 --> 00:11:04,306
Breathe.

154
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:09,811
Check Lee.

155
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:32,417
Go, l'll take care of Lee.

156
00:11:37,465 --> 00:11:40,217
Mercury will miss the Earth
by a distance of 500,000 miles.

157
00:11:40,385 --> 00:11:42,970
Roughly twice as far away
as the moon.

158
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:44,722
- That's not good.
- Exactly.

159
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:46,682
Even at that distance,

160
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,601
its gravitational field
will wreak havoc.

161
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:52,229
Extreme tides,
electrical disturbances at a minimum.

162
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:56,275
Well, our primary concern at this point
has gotta be the political fallout.

163
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:58,819
Put our defense systems
on high alert.

164
00:11:58,987 --> 00:12:02,156
l've also had Michelle working
to get in touch with the Nautilus,

165
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:03,949
but we haven't had
any success.

166
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:06,493
Nautilus is the least
of our concerns at this point.

167
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:09,038
But they were right there.

168
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:11,290
lf the Nautilus
did manage to pull through,

169
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:13,167
they may be able
to fill in the blanks.

170
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:17,796
Fine, but you keep
James Preston out of it.

171
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:19,340
Yes, sir.

172
00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:29,141
Man over radio: We are continuing
to receive some frantic reports

173
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:31,727
of massive power failures
around the world.

174
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:33,979
Global communications
continue to be affected,

175
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:36,482
as most satellites
seem to be off-line.

176
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,943
All air transportation
is being grounded until further notice.

177
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:42,321
We'll continue to bring you
details as they develop.

178
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:44,073
Oh man.

179
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:53,123
l've normalized our oxygen levels,
but most of our systems are damaged.

180
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:56,919
Communication is down,
as is navigation.

181
00:12:57,087 --> 00:13:00,881
Right.
What the hell hit us?

182
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:04,760
lt seemed like a solar flare,
but it was massive.

183
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:07,304
All of the energy readings
are wrong.

184
00:13:07,472 --> 00:13:08,764
Well, we'll have to worry
about that later.

185
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:10,557
Right now we've got
bigger problems.

186
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,476
l've managed
to stabilize us.

187
00:13:12,644 --> 00:13:14,520
Do what you can with communication.
l'll work on navigation.

188
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:16,021
Okay.

189
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:19,274
We need to figure out
where the hell we are.

190
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:36,164
- Hey.
- Hey.

191
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:37,749
Check it out.

192
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,460
A little Sumatra blend.
You want some?

193
00:13:40,628 --> 00:13:42,921
l need you to take a look
at this, okay?

194
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,298
lt's about Victoria.
Something happened up there

195
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,717
and l need to know how
it's gonna affect the Nautilus.

196
00:13:47,885 --> 00:13:50,220
Well, it was a massive solar flare
that hit us this morning.

197
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:52,138
Biggest one on record,
but the Nautilus should be prepared

198
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:54,807
- for that kind of event.
- lt's not a solar flare.

199
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,851
Okay, look.

200
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,438
lts magnetic signature,
it's off the charts.

201
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,151
Oh, my God.

202
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:17,080
Are you okay?

203
00:14:17,248 --> 00:14:19,916
Yeah, just a headache.

204
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:24,754
Any luck on the comm?

205
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:26,798
Well, we'll only be able
to transmit

206
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,175
and receive
on a very narrow band.

207
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:31,136
But they'll be able
to hear us?

208
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,181
lf they're listening.

209
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,812
Woman on radio:
Power blackouts.

210
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,232
Communication failures.
Airplanes grounded.

211
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,568
The government wants you
to think it's a solar flare,

212
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:48,570
but we are here
to give you the truth.

213
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:52,282
Brooke Adamson's
"Conspiracy Report" is back on the air.

214
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,242
Nice.

215
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,162
What's wrong?

216
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:01,708
No, it's just, uh,
getting some interference.

217
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:03,710
- lt's not us.
- lt's the Feds.

218
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:05,211
- lt's not the Feds.
- lt's the Feds.

219
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,339
Victoria over radio: This is
Victoria Preston of the USS Nautilus

220
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:09,132
making an emergency
distress call.

221
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,885
Can anybody read?

222
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:14,054
No way.

223
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:18,308
What?

224
00:15:18,476 --> 00:15:22,395
This is Victoria Preston
on the USS Nautilus. Come in.

225
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,151
lsn't the Nautilus the spacecraft
that's on the Mercury mission?

226
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:30,862
- Yeah, yeah.
- Well, it's gotta be a joke.

227
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,114
Well, we'll find out.

228
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:35,575
First we'll lock on her signal.
Here.

229
00:15:35,743 --> 00:15:37,911
Um...

230
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:41,748
copy that, Nautilus.
You're breaking up.

231
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,250
- Do you read?
- Copy that.

232
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:47,420
This is Victoria Preston on
the Nautilus. We are in distress.

233
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:54,803
Before we proceed,
please encrypt

234
00:15:54,971 --> 00:15:56,346
this transmission using

235
00:15:56,514 --> 00:15:59,474
security protocol 27-46-32.

236
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:02,352
- What are you doing?
- lf it's a hoax, they'll play along.

237
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,271
- How can you be so sure?
- Because that's what l would do.

238
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:08,316
Victoria: There's no such protocol.
Who exactly am l speaking with?

239
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:09,943
Give me that.

240
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:13,321
This is Christopher Weaver
and Brooke Adamson.

241
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,615
We're seniors
at North Bay University.

242
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:19,244
You've managed to connect
with our pirate radio station.

243
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,960
Victoria, do you copy that?

244
00:16:27,128 --> 00:16:29,379
Come in.

245
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:32,507
- What happened?
- We gotta get that signal back.

246
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:35,760
Let's go to the car.
We'll try new batteries.

247
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,267
Before my telescope went off-line,
l was able to pull these images.

248
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,186
Look at these sun-spots.
They're starting to disappear here,

249
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:48,732
and here, here, and here.

250
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,443
- What does that mean?
- Magnetism.

251
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,945
lt all makes sense now.

252
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:58,575
For one brief millisecond,

253
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:01,077
our humble little sun
became a magnetar,

254
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:03,913
the most powerful source
of magnetic energy in the universe.

255
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,126
A magnetar?

256
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,254
Yeah, it's extremely rare,

257
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:12,756
but it's the only thing
that could explain it.

258
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:16,176
The sun-spots, the blackouts,
the magnetic wave, everything.

259
00:17:16,343 --> 00:17:19,054
What was that?

260
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:35,862
Whoa.

261
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:39,616
This should not be happening.

262
00:17:39,784 --> 00:17:41,326
There's no way our database
could have missed

263
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,536
this many meteors
approaching Earth.

264
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,708
Buddy,
either you're wrong

265
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:50,877
or that's not a meteor.

266
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:55,548
That impact site can't be
more than a mile or two, tops.

267
00:17:57,968 --> 00:18:01,137
Let's take my car. l don't want
to have to ride on your handlebars.

268
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:03,515
Very funny.

269
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:09,020
- Get in the car.
- l enjoy riding my bike to work.

270
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,523
- lt's something that l like to do.
- Get in the car.

271
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:17,904
Uh, this is not good.

272
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:20,156
Do you know
where we are yet?

273
00:18:20,324 --> 00:18:22,033
No.

274
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,911
But we're accelerating

275
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,246
without engine power.

276
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,752
Well, you check autopilot and see
if there's been any false commands

277
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,921
and l'll see what l can do.

278
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:39,384
Yes, ma'am.

279
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:43,263
Wow.

280
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:45,974
Something's definitely wrong.

281
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,656
- There's still no signal.
- l don't know.

282
00:19:01,824 --> 00:19:03,616
Do you think that
was really the Nautilus?

283
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:06,411
Yeah, l do.
l do.

284
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:10,123
Whoa!

285
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:13,459
- What the hell was that?
- l don't know,

286
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:15,461
but there's more coming.
Get in the car.

287
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:17,505
Get in the car!

288
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,507
James?

289
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:22,010
Run. Run!

290
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,563
Get down!

291
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,198
Oh, boy.

292
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:57,962
ls it over?

293
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,756
l think so.

294
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:01,925
What the hell happened?

295
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,282
Matthew: Whoa.

296
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,417
Computer:
Navigation systems initializing.

297
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:41,130
Flight path compromised.

298
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:45,760
Marshall, l've checked everything.
l can't find anything wrong.

299
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:47,428
Get up here.
l need your help with navigation.

300
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:50,556
We need to figure out
where we're headed now.

301
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,279
- And we are back up.
- Computer: Plotting Nautilus location.

302
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:07,448
- Marshall: Wait, this can't be right.
- What is it?

303
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,617
We're not where we should be.

304
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:15,032
Neither is Mercury.

305
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,361
How is that possible?

306
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,529
Marshall:
l don't know. lt's out of orbit.

307
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:24,033
No. We're accelerating
towards the planet.

308
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,745
Mercury is dragging us in?

309
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:29,914
But we're not close enough
to be in its gravity.

310
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,749
Whatever it is,
l don't want to be any closer.

311
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:35,336
Computer:
Reverse thrusters engaged.

312
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,052
Victoria, we need
to get a hold of Mission Ops.

313
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,970
Right.

314
00:22:20,378 --> 00:22:22,296
Okay.

315
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:24,381
Maybe.

316
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,842
Ground, do you copy?

317
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,468
Can you hear me?

318
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:32,848
Ground, this is Victoria.
Do you copy?

319
00:22:34,017 --> 00:22:36,310
Thrusters are at 70%.
l don't like this.

320
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:41,231
Ground, this is Victoria. Do you copy?

321
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:45,402
- Yeah, Victoria. We're here.
- Oh, thank God.

322
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,239
l need you to get in touch
with Mission Control. lt's urgent.

323
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:51,617
Well, if you're trying to warn us
about meteors,

324
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:54,995
- you're a little late for that.
- Christopher, the Nautilus

325
00:22:55,163 --> 00:22:57,789
has been knocked off course.
l need Mission Ops to guide us.

326
00:22:57,957 --> 00:22:59,958
Marshall: Come on.

327
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:05,255
Mission Ops is in Houston.
We're in Oregon and the phones are down.

328
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:07,549
Oregon, okay.

329
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:11,219
l need you to get to a facility
south of Seattle called SPEAR.

330
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:14,264
SPEAR. l know that.
My cousin lives nearby.

331
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,476
Okay, great. When you get there,
ask for a person named Jennifer Kelly.

332
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:20,187
Tell her what l've told you,
that we need Mission Ops

333
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,898
to guide Nautilus, and give her
this frequency to get in touch.

334
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:26,902
And, please,
our lives depend on it.

335
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,570
We're on it.
Let's go.

336
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:40,332
lt has an extremely high
iron content.

337
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,835
Way too high for
an ordinary piece of meteorite.

338
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:47,506
This might sound crazy,
but l think this is a piece of Mercury.

339
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:58,058
lt's a magnetized piece
of Mercury.

340
00:23:58,432 --> 00:24:01,267
lf it was hit
by the magnetar wave,

341
00:24:01,435 --> 00:24:02,810
that would explain
why it's magnetic.

342
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:04,937
Even so,

343
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:07,106
how are pieces of it
down here?

344
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:11,360
l don't know.

345
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:26,125
Thrusters are at maximum.

346
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:29,587
- We're still being pulled in.
- l can do a manual override

347
00:24:29,755 --> 00:24:31,380
in the engine room
to boost the thrusters,

348
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:33,758
but it's a temporary fix at best.

349
00:24:33,926 --> 00:24:35,718
- Do it!
- Got it!

350
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:45,519
This is weird.

351
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:47,772
You want to read me
those coordinates again?

352
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,483
Yeah. Uh...

353
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:52,276
- right ascension...
- Mm-hmm.

354
00:24:52,444 --> 00:24:55,196
- ...13 hours...
- Mm-hmm.

355
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:57,031
- ...17 minutes.
- Mm-hmm.

356
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,407
- Declination...
- Yeah.

357
00:24:58,575 --> 00:25:00,493
..negative-7 degrees...

358
00:25:00,661 --> 00:25:03,663
- Yeah.
- ...2 arcminutes.

359
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,707
lt's not there.

360
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:11,087
What are you talking about?

361
00:25:11,255 --> 00:25:12,880
- lt's not there.
- Where is it?

362
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:14,924
l don't know.
lt's just-- it's gone.

363
00:25:15,092 --> 00:25:17,760
- Do you mind?
- lt's just gone.

364
00:25:17,928 --> 00:25:19,428
Okay.

365
00:25:21,265 --> 00:25:22,473
They were right there.

366
00:25:25,018 --> 00:25:28,396
Mercury was right--

367
00:25:36,196 --> 00:25:37,780
they were right there.

368
00:25:40,158 --> 00:25:43,536
All right, that--
that's impossible.

369
00:25:45,664 --> 00:25:47,748
A planet doesn't just move.

370
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:51,460
What are you gonna do?

371
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:57,717
l'm gonna get some answers.

372
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,607
Marshall, l got you another 20% ,

373
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,026
but that's the best l could do.

374
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,986
Let's hope it's enough.

375
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,834
There's not enough power
in the reverse thrusters.

376
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,712
l need to flip us around
and engage the main engine.

377
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,424
That's too risky.
We can't use the reverse thrusters

378
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,385
and turn the ship at the same time.
We'd be pulled in immediately.

379
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,638
- Not if we do it fast enough.
- We?

380
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,723
lt's a two-man job, Victoria.

381
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,560
But l'm not a pilot.

382
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,728
Welcome to your promotion.

383
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:55,822
Victoria, reduce power by 20%
when l boost the main engines.

384
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,615
Copy that.

385
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,742
Now!

386
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,911
Reducing power.

387
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,462
We're being
pulled in sideways.

388
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,301
Marshall?
Marshall?!

389
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,906
Maneuver successfully executed.

390
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,956
Okay, l need you
to take over for a while.

391
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:49,083
What's wrong?

392
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,546
What's the matter?

393
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,007
l think l might have got hit hard--

394
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,844
Marshall!

395
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:11,147
Yes?

396
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,774
We need to see
Jennifer Kelly right away.

397
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,026
- And you are?
- We have an urgent message

398
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,195
from Victoria Preston
and the Nautilus spacecraft.

399
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,947
- ls that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

400
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,949
- So if you could just please--
- Excuse me, sir,

401
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,743
the Nautilus is having
severe mechanical malfunctions

402
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,078
and they can't
get a hold of Mission Ops,

403
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:26,788
but they can
get a hold of my radio.

404
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,916
- We were sent here to see Jennifer--
- This is a secure facility.

405
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:32,335
No one gets in without
an appointment or a pass.

406
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,712
- Yeah, l understand that, but--
- That was me telling you nicely.

407
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,716
Don't make me tell you again.
Let's go.

408
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,301
- Great.
- Guard: Let's go.

409
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:15,670
James, l know what must be
going through your head right now.

410
00:29:17,006 --> 00:29:19,007
Then you'll stop
the small talk.

411
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:23,011
lt's just we don't know
anything for sure yet.

412
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,389
There's a very good chance
that she's alive.

413
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:29,642
Mercury didn't disappear.
lt was knocked out of orbit.

414
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,395
- l tracked its gravity--
- And my wife...

415
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:35,815
probably should be walking
on Mercury right now.

416
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:39,736
Now pieces of it
are landing on the Earth.

417
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,031
You understand?

418
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:20,485
They didn't believe us.

419
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,071
- The guard wouldn't even call Jennifer.
- Fascist.

420
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,239
What should we do now?

421
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:36,831
Find my husband,
Dr. James Preston.

422
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,917
He'll be at our home
in Pacific Grove.

423
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:43,087
433 Ocean Beach Drive.

424
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:47,842
Come on, James.

425
00:30:52,848 --> 00:30:55,641
Look, l don't care if your facility's
on lockdown, okay?

426
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:58,603
Try her number again
'cause l need to talk to her.

427
00:30:58,771 --> 00:31:01,606
- Sir, you need to calm down.
- Oh, l need to calm down?

428
00:31:01,774 --> 00:31:03,566
l used to work here, okay?
l can't call her

429
00:31:03,734 --> 00:31:06,235
because my phone doesn't work.
lt's urgent.

430
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,739
Stand down.

431
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:13,618
James, you need to leave.
You know you can't be here.

432
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:15,578
l can't share
classified information with you.

433
00:31:15,746 --> 00:31:18,748
What about Mercury?
ls that classified?

434
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:22,627
- Look, we know all about Mercury.
- Do you?

435
00:31:22,795 --> 00:31:26,130
Do you also know
it's magnetized?

436
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:31,636
He's with me.

437
00:31:31,804 --> 00:31:34,639
You, stay there.

438
00:31:46,193 --> 00:31:49,028
- What the hell is he doing here?
- Show him.

439
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:02,667
Nice trick.
So what?

440
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:06,504
This thing,
this was attached to Mercury.

441
00:32:14,221 --> 00:32:17,765
You have to recalculate
the planet's trajectory

442
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:19,809
based on magnetism.

443
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,771
What exactly
are you trying to tell me?

444
00:32:24,773 --> 00:32:27,316
Massive magnetar wave
hit Mercury.

445
00:32:27,484 --> 00:32:29,819
lt is now
extremely magnetized.

446
00:32:29,987 --> 00:32:31,487
lf it's anywhere near Earth,

447
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:33,865
it'll lock on to our magnetic field--

448
00:32:34,842 --> 00:32:36,634
it'll come straight for us.

449
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:41,222
Well, we've tracked its trajectory,

450
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,641
and while it is headed our way,

451
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:47,186
we're comfortably certain
that it will miss us.

452
00:32:47,354 --> 00:32:50,064
You're not factoring in
the magnetism.

453
00:32:50,232 --> 00:32:52,150
You have to recalculate.

454
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,037
Based on our new data,
the calculations show

455
00:33:05,122 --> 00:33:06,998
the trajectory has changed.

456
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,334
Oh, my God.

457
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,377
Mercury's on
a collision course with Earth.

458
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:12,795
Look at the distance
it's covered.

459
00:33:12,963 --> 00:33:16,591
- lt's moving faster.
- lt's locked on to us.

460
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,384
Earth's magnetic field
is drawing it in.

461
00:33:18,552 --> 00:33:20,094
lt's like two magnets
pulling it together.

462
00:33:20,262 --> 00:33:22,472
This is beyond
an extinction level event.

463
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:26,017
- This is the end of the world.
- How long have we got?

464
00:33:32,566 --> 00:33:34,233
Just over 18 hours.

465
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:38,696
Okay, people, this is why
we have a contingency plan.

466
00:33:38,864 --> 00:33:42,658
lnitiate Operation Recourse.
l wanna be online in 30 minutes.

467
00:33:42,826 --> 00:33:44,827
Jennifer: Yes, sir.

468
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:48,623
Edward...

469
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:50,833
Operation Recourse won't work.

470
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:55,254
Your missiles aren't strong enough
to stop a planet.

471
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:58,674
We are not trying
to stop Mercury.

472
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:00,426
We're gonna deflect it.

473
00:34:00,594 --> 00:34:03,096
The missiles will cause
coordinated standoff explosions

474
00:34:03,263 --> 00:34:05,681
in front of the planet
and drive it off course.

475
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:07,767
l already know
what your plan is.

476
00:34:07,935 --> 00:34:09,811
You're assuming
that your guidance system

477
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:11,854
will withstand
a magnetic interference

478
00:34:12,022 --> 00:34:14,774
and synchronize the blast.

479
00:34:14,942 --> 00:34:16,442
They can go off course.

480
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,069
They could explode
before they get there.

481
00:34:18,237 --> 00:34:20,738
Worse, they get sucked back
into the planet,

482
00:34:20,906 --> 00:34:23,741
they blow it to fragments,
they wipe us out anyway!

483
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:27,203
Our missiles
are properly shielded.

484
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:30,415
Not against this.

485
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:34,043
Going ahead with this launch,

486
00:34:34,211 --> 00:34:37,213
you're choosing suicide
over a firing squad.

487
00:34:40,884 --> 00:34:43,553
Your sarcasm
is really better suited

488
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,638
to your community
college lectures.

489
00:34:45,806 --> 00:34:48,474
You don't have a say
in what we do here.

490
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,091
We launch as soon as Mercury
is within our firing range.

491
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,648
James:
Edward, Edward, listen.

492
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,108
What about Project 7?

493
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,068
This is exactly
what it was designed for.

494
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,446
The deflector never worked
in field testing, not once.

495
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,366
Without that,
it's just a big rock with engines.

496
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,536
We've been modifying the software,
we've been working out the bugs.

497
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,122
You pulled it so you
can give your contracts

498
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,207
to your rocket
manufacturing buddies.

499
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,835
Well, if that's the way you want to see
your failure, that's your business,

500
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,295
but, regardless,
we don't have time to dust it off now.

501
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,798
l can get
the deflector field to work.

502
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,552
l've been uploading
the software since l left.

503
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,762
l'm sorry.
You've been doing what?

504
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,974
- Hacking into a government weapon?
- That's my weapon.

505
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,185
lt hasn't been your weapon
since l fired you three years ago.

506
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,981
l could have you thrown
in prison for this.

507
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,066
lt'll work.

508
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,530
Just gotta let me
upload the fixes.

509
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,282
We don't have the time

510
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,659
or resources
to launch two programs.

511
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,495
We're only gonna get
one shot at this...

512
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,832
and l am not gonna risk
the fate of humanity

513
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,667
on your unproven technology.

514
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,254
l think you know
the way out.

515
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,423
Okay.

516
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,555
Chris: Wait.

517
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,058
- Which way?
- l don't know.

518
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,852
ls this North Coast Road?

519
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,645
l don't know.
There's no road signs.

520
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,439
Let's try this way.

521
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,666
And you're sure P-7 is the key
to stopping Mercury?

522
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,793
- Stake my life on it.
- Sounds like you'll be staking

523
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,421
- everyone's life on it, James.
- My software updates will work.

524
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,965
We just need to upload them
to get P-7 fully online.

525
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:02,427
- That sounds easy enough.
- We just need to go to my office,

526
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,805
get the software, then we need
a secure SPEAR computer.

527
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:08,475
Did you say we?

528
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,051
Hello?
Mr. Preston?

529
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,976
Whoa.

530
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,970
- Hey, hey, keep the car straight.
- lt's not me.

531
00:37:55,723 --> 00:37:57,724
lt's the ground that's moving.

532
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:01,520
Whoa.

533
00:38:07,944 --> 00:38:09,945
Oh, my God.

534
00:38:43,771 --> 00:38:46,356
- lt's metal.
- What?

535
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,608
lt's not trees,
it's not telephone poles.

536
00:38:48,776 --> 00:38:52,863
Whatever that is,
it only affected metal.

537
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:58,785
This must all be
connected to Mercury.

538
00:38:59,996 --> 00:39:01,371
lt has to be.

539
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:09,588
Jennifer: That's not good.
That's not good at all.

540
00:39:10,756 --> 00:39:12,841
We've just received report--
Seattle's been devastated

541
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:14,968
by a massive magnetic event.

542
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,389
- How far are we from launching?
- We've had to recalculate.

543
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:22,225
Mercury's speeding up and we're having
a hard time keeping a lock on it.

544
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,311
We have a very small window
to launch these missiles

545
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:26,229
and we're running
out of time.

546
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,358
What happened
to your security pass?

547
00:39:34,113 --> 00:39:36,490
- Find Preston.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:40,577
Just follow me.

549
00:39:44,457 --> 00:39:46,833
Oh, wait.
l read on the lnternet somewhere

550
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:49,711
that you can open up any door
with a credit card.

551
00:39:52,632 --> 00:39:54,883
l think, eh,
yeah, you just--

552
00:39:55,885 --> 00:39:57,886
l don't know.

553
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,891
People never leave
these things locked.

554
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:04,893
Right.

555
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:07,729
Mr. Preston?

556
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:10,774
ls anyone home?

557
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:15,820
Hello?

558
00:40:18,991 --> 00:40:20,575
Hey, come here.

559
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:24,439
God, the phones
still aren't working.

560
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:30,278
There's nothing here.
Nothing useful anyways.

561
00:40:39,163 --> 00:40:41,665
- What is that?
- l don't know.

562
00:40:42,834 --> 00:40:45,335
Looks like some kind of weapon.

563
00:40:55,138 --> 00:40:57,139
Whose car is that?

564
00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:05,313
What kind of guy keeps plans
for a top secret weapon on his computer?

565
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:08,358
Brooke: lf he were here right now,
l'd give him a piece of my mind.

566
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,987
What the hell
are you doing in my house?

567
00:41:12,155 --> 00:41:14,281
- Look, your wife sent us.
- What are you talking about?

568
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:16,366
We talked to her.
She's in trouble.

569
00:41:16,534 --> 00:41:17,993
- Brooke: We can prove it.
- Yeah.

570
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:20,287
What?

571
00:41:20,455 --> 00:41:22,039
Well, it's just over there.

572
00:41:22,206 --> 00:41:23,915
Please?

573
00:41:26,294 --> 00:41:29,880
So l used
some of today's engineering

574
00:41:30,048 --> 00:41:32,382
with yesterday's
analog technology

575
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:36,553
with a few experimental bits
here and there and voilà.

576
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:40,474
lt broadcasts and receives
farther than you can imagine.

577
00:41:43,561 --> 00:41:45,353
Well, it's a work of art.

578
00:41:46,522 --> 00:41:48,398
lt's how we heard
Victoria's mayday.

579
00:41:52,502 --> 00:41:55,504
- You wanna turn it on?
- Yeah, sorry.

580
00:42:06,808 --> 00:42:09,602
Okay.
Yeah, cool.

581
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,109
Vic, you there?

582
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:24,158
Victoria?

583
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:28,287
Victoria:
Ground, can you please repeat?

584
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:32,875
Vic, it's me.
Um...

585
00:42:35,212 --> 00:42:37,838
- you safe?
- l'm alive,

586
00:42:38,006 --> 00:42:39,965
but l'm the only one left.

587
00:42:43,887 --> 00:42:45,930
James: What happened?
Are you okay?

588
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:49,475
Something crazy has happened
and l can't really explain it,

589
00:42:49,643 --> 00:42:52,353
but l'm being pulled
into Mercury.

590
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:54,939
Oh, my God,
the magnetism.

591
00:42:56,399 --> 00:43:00,277
Vic, there's been
a huge magnetic event.

592
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:03,447
Yes, l know.
We were right in the middle of it.

593
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:07,618
Mercury's been magnetized
and is being pushed out of its orbit.

594
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,997
Magnetism.
Why didn't l think of this?

595
00:43:12,165 --> 00:43:14,041
Okay,
if l can recalculate,

596
00:43:14,209 --> 00:43:16,418
if l can account
for the difference in force,

597
00:43:16,586 --> 00:43:19,171
l might be able to break free
and come home.

598
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:24,009
Vic, there might not be a home
to come back to.

599
00:43:27,264 --> 00:43:29,974
Mercury's on
a collision course with Earth.

600
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,945
Can you keep me posted on this
and just double-check these?

601
00:43:43,113 --> 00:43:44,780
Woman:
l just lost everything.

602
00:43:44,948 --> 00:43:46,865
What is going on?

603
00:43:47,033 --> 00:43:48,993
This facility should be impervious
to power surges.

604
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,661
Mercury's interference
is increasing.

605
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,205
lt's becoming more
than our shielding can handle.

606
00:43:53,373 --> 00:43:55,916
Get the emergency generators
back online.

607
00:43:56,084 --> 00:43:59,545
The moment they stabilize,
l want those missiles in the air!

608
00:43:59,713 --> 00:44:01,380
Edward,
what if James is right?

609
00:44:05,552 --> 00:44:06,927
Move aside.

610
00:44:09,431 --> 00:44:12,016
Project 7 is the only thing
that can save us from Mercury.

611
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:13,892
You need to get the hell
out of there before we launch.

612
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,061
Victoria:
Okay, l've done everything l can

613
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:18,022
to recalculate
for the change in force.

614
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:20,232
l've tried to boost the engines
as much as possible,

615
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,277
but it's just not enough thrust.

616
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:32,077
Wait a minute.
What if l let it pull me in?

617
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:37,333
- What do you mean?
- A slingshot maneuver.

618
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:42,755
Yes, yes, yes.
She lets the planet pull her in,

619
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:45,799
accelerating around Mercury.
That will give her the extra momentum

620
00:44:45,967 --> 00:44:48,552
she needs to break free.

621
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,679
That's a suicide mission.

622
00:44:50,847 --> 00:44:54,308
- Magnetism is too unpredictable.
- Victoria: l've been trained for this.

623
00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:58,854
Honey, honey.

624
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:01,649
You're not a pilot.
You've never done this before.

625
00:45:02,651 --> 00:45:05,027
l have to try.
lf l stay here, l'm dead.

626
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:07,237
lt's my only chance.

627
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:11,742
No, no, no, no.

628
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,370
Vic?
Vic?!

629
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:16,747
James, can you hear me?

630
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,582
Sorry, it's fragile.

631
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:21,168
lt wasn't built
to be dragged around like this.

632
00:45:29,094 --> 00:45:31,095
Can you hear me?

633
00:45:43,805 --> 00:45:47,933
- Disengage autopilot.
- Computer: Autopilot disengaged.

634
00:45:51,103 --> 00:45:53,104
Here goes nothing.

635
00:45:57,527 --> 00:45:59,820
She'll make it, she'll make it.

636
00:45:59,987 --> 00:46:02,447
She's gonna make it.
She's gonna be all right.

637
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,951
What is that?

638
00:46:10,832 --> 00:46:13,250
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- What's wrong?

639
00:46:14,794 --> 00:46:17,045
Project 7's guidance systems
are damaged.

640
00:46:17,213 --> 00:46:19,172
- Can't you fix it?
- lt's not a software problem,

641
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,883
it's hardware.
You can't fix it from the ground.

642
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:26,972
- So that's it?
- Um, the Nautilus.

643
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:29,641
The Nautilus has
an amazing guidance system.

644
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:32,519
lf Victoria can pilot the ship
to Project 7,

645
00:46:32,687 --> 00:46:34,187
tether onto its system,

646
00:46:34,355 --> 00:46:37,649
we can then use it to manually guide
the asteroid straight into Mercury.

647
00:46:37,817 --> 00:46:39,401
We still have to do
the software updates.

648
00:46:39,569 --> 00:46:41,278
Without the energy field,
you won't have enough force

649
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:43,029
to knock Mercury off course.

650
00:46:43,197 --> 00:46:45,240
- So send them.
- l can't do it from here.

651
00:46:45,408 --> 00:46:47,200
Can monitor the systems,

652
00:46:47,368 --> 00:46:48,702
but to change anything,
l need a computer

653
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,954
that has top-level
classified access.

654
00:46:51,122 --> 00:46:53,164
And you need to fix that radio.

655
00:46:53,332 --> 00:46:55,208
That's another power surge.

656
00:47:00,798 --> 00:47:02,340
Come on.

657
00:47:02,508 --> 00:47:04,301
Come on,
come on, come on.

658
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,151
Here we go,
here we go.

659
00:47:22,737 --> 00:47:24,738
l got it.

660
00:47:27,116 --> 00:47:28,158
Whoa.

661
00:47:28,326 --> 00:47:31,328
Yes, Mr. President. Believe me,
we're doing everything we can.

662
00:47:33,331 --> 00:47:35,165
No, sir. These are
limited range missiles.

663
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:37,250
The timing is crucial.

664
00:47:37,418 --> 00:47:39,544
lf we launch too early
the missiles will fall short,

665
00:47:39,712 --> 00:47:43,256
too late, and Mercury won't be
knocked off course enough to miss Earth.

666
00:47:45,176 --> 00:47:47,093
Mr. President, are you there?

667
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:49,262
Mr. President?

668
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,237
- l'm gonna need a new relay.
- There's an old airstrip.

669
00:48:06,405 --> 00:48:08,198
One of the radio planes
might have what you need.

670
00:48:08,366 --> 00:48:09,783
Right, l saw it on the way in.

671
00:48:09,951 --> 00:48:12,327
Here, once we get the radio up
and running, we'll call you on it.

672
00:48:12,495 --> 00:48:15,246
Okay. ls this even gonna work
with all the interference?

673
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:18,416
Trust me, we reached Mercury
with this thing. lt'll work.

674
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:21,044
You gonna tell me
where we're going?

675
00:48:21,212 --> 00:48:22,462
The fallback facility.

676
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:25,131
- Which is what exactly?
- Designed when l was working at SPEAR.

677
00:48:25,299 --> 00:48:27,175
They should have access
to every weapon,

678
00:48:27,343 --> 00:48:30,220
- including Project 7.
- Should have access?

679
00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:32,097
The coordinates
are in records storage.

680
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:34,766
- We don't even know where it is?
- That's why we're hurrying.

681
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:02,810
Hello?

682
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:05,855
Anybody here?

683
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:08,483
lf we're gonna find
that relay switch,

684
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:11,861
- we better start looking for it.
- l don't know. This place is creepy.

685
00:49:12,029 --> 00:49:14,238
- l don't like it.
- lt's a creepy old airstrip.

686
00:49:14,406 --> 00:49:17,283
What did you expect?

687
00:49:17,451 --> 00:49:19,577
- Here, this looks like the hangar.
- Okay.

688
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,000
Hello?

689
00:49:27,044 --> 00:49:29,087
- l think this is the hangar.
- Okay.

690
00:49:29,254 --> 00:49:31,464
- Let's check the yard here.
- Okay.

691
00:49:33,968 --> 00:49:36,094
- Anything?
- No.

692
00:49:36,261 --> 00:49:38,096
- Here.
- What exactly are we looking for?

693
00:49:38,263 --> 00:49:40,348
We're looking for a radio
that's still intact.

694
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:42,517
Okay.

695
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:55,780
No, these are all shells.

696
00:49:55,948 --> 00:49:57,949
- We need to get to that hangar.
- Okay.

697
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,958
Hey.

698
00:50:18,345 --> 00:50:20,263
- Quick.
- What's happening?

699
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:23,224
- l don't know.
- ls it more meteors?

700
00:50:23,392 --> 00:50:25,184
l don't think so.
lt feels more like an earthquake.

701
00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:28,521
- Earthquake?
- Worse, we're being hit by

702
00:50:28,689 --> 00:50:30,606
massive waves
of electromagnetic energy.

703
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:32,400
We still can't risk
launching too early.

704
00:50:32,568 --> 00:50:34,152
lf this EM interference
increases,

705
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,403
you won't be able
to launch the missiles.

706
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:37,530
You can't fire
when the interference is spiking.

707
00:50:37,698 --> 00:50:40,366
Okay, then calculate intervals
in between the wavelengths

708
00:50:40,534 --> 00:50:42,660
- and we'll fire in between.
- Yes, sir.

709
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:47,832
- ls it over?
- l think so.

710
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:51,252
Okay, maybe this plane
will have what we need.

711
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,337
Let's find out.

712
00:50:53,505 --> 00:50:56,466
Computer:
Trajectory calculations complete.

713
00:50:58,761 --> 00:51:00,428
Warning,

714
00:51:00,596 --> 00:51:02,388
possible
collision course detected.

715
00:51:02,556 --> 00:51:05,183
Recommend
replotting trajectory.

716
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,037
Project 7.
Stupid.

717
00:51:26,205 --> 00:51:28,039
What were
Projects 1 through 6?

718
00:51:28,129 --> 00:51:30,130
l don't even want to know.

719
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:35,344
- Any luck?
- l think l got it.

720
00:51:40,976 --> 00:51:43,268
Yes.

721
00:51:43,436 --> 00:51:46,981
We're in business.
Okay, let's get out of here.

722
00:51:47,148 --> 00:51:49,149
Okay.

723
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,446
Stop where you are
or l'll drop you where you stand.

724
00:51:54,614 --> 00:51:57,324
What the hell are you doing
with my plane?

725
00:51:58,535 --> 00:52:00,536
- Sir--
- Shut up!

726
00:52:00,704 --> 00:52:03,205
Here's what's gonna happen.

727
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:06,875
You're gonna drop that,
you're just gonna--

728
00:52:07,043 --> 00:52:09,837
you're gonna slowly
put that down on the ground.

729
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:12,131
- Yeah.
- And you're gonna put

730
00:52:12,298 --> 00:52:13,674
- your hands in the air.
- Right, okay.

731
00:52:13,842 --> 00:52:15,384
Sir, we needed one part.

732
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:17,928
We've been communicating
with the spacecraft Nautilus.

733
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:19,638
Sure, you have.
Hands in the air now!

734
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:22,558
Brooke: You don't understand.
This is a matter of life and death.

735
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:25,936
- We can't leave without that radio.
- You're gonna leave without the radio

736
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:28,981
because it's my radio.

737
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:31,233
You know what l mean?

738
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:33,402
lt's my radio.

739
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:40,576
Hurry!
Go, go!

740
00:52:42,245 --> 00:52:43,787
Say your prayers,
you little bastard!

741
00:52:50,837 --> 00:52:52,671
How are we
supposed to get inside?

742
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:54,840
There's no way
to sneak around that guard.

743
00:53:02,557 --> 00:53:05,726
- How'd you get that?
- l borrowed it.

744
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:08,979
- Nice.
- Yeah.

745
00:53:15,737 --> 00:53:17,404
- Morning.
- Hi there.

746
00:53:17,572 --> 00:53:19,531
Hey,
stop right there.

747
00:53:22,494 --> 00:53:24,411
Gonna need to see
that lD again, sir.

748
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:27,289
Yeah, here you go.
Here you go.

749
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:46,767
G-g-g-g-gun!

750
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:49,353
Get the gun!
Get the gun!

751
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:52,439
Help, help!

752
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:07,287
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey.

753
00:54:07,455 --> 00:54:10,457
- Ow!
- Back it up. Over there, over there.

754
00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:13,377
Sorry about that.
You okay?

755
00:54:13,545 --> 00:54:14,753
- Yeah.
- Over there, over there, over there.

756
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:16,380
What do we do?
What do we do now?

757
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:18,048
- Give me the gun.
- Okay, huh?

758
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:20,759
Just give me the gun.

759
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,637
Hey, hey, hey!
Back up!

760
00:54:23,805 --> 00:54:26,431
Back up!

761
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,851
Okay, there's rope in the car.

762
00:54:29,018 --> 00:54:31,019
Go get the rope.

763
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:34,690
- Keys.
- The car is open!

764
00:54:44,534 --> 00:54:46,660
Whoa! Get down!

765
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:49,621
Get down,
get down!

766
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:54,626
Wait, can you just--

767
00:54:59,215 --> 00:55:00,549
Come on,
let's go!

768
00:55:06,184 --> 00:55:07,935
- You okay?
- Yeah.

769
00:55:16,528 --> 00:55:18,987
Okay, he's reloading.
Come on, come on, let's go.

770
00:55:19,155 --> 00:55:21,156
Go, go, go!

771
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,126
What?

772
00:55:40,802 --> 00:55:42,427
Brooke:
Oh, God.

773
00:55:42,595 --> 00:55:44,888
We need to get out of here now.

774
00:55:48,434 --> 00:55:50,435
- Brooke, come on!
- l'm coming!

775
00:55:57,569 --> 00:55:59,611
Let's go, go, go!

776
00:56:02,532 --> 00:56:04,408
Brooke:
l'm hurrying!

777
00:56:19,299 --> 00:56:20,632
Matthew: Whoa.

778
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,427
So, uh, where do we start?

779
00:56:23,595 --> 00:56:25,470
Hang on, these-- aren't file cabinets

780
00:56:25,638 --> 00:56:27,389
supposed to have letters on them?

781
00:56:28,641 --> 00:56:32,394
Secret codes, secret files,

782
00:56:32,562 --> 00:56:34,479
they get bar codes.

783
00:56:35,732 --> 00:56:39,026
So how are we supposed to
find the one we're looking for?

784
00:56:41,196 --> 00:56:43,155
You take that side,
l'll take this side.

785
00:56:43,323 --> 00:56:45,365
- Okay, all right.
- Just look for things

786
00:56:45,533 --> 00:56:48,744
that have structures, buildings,
things grouped together.

787
00:56:48,912 --> 00:56:50,913
- Stuff like that.
- Okay.

788
00:56:55,293 --> 00:56:57,127
- Matthew?
- Yes.

789
00:56:57,295 --> 00:56:59,504
- You don't have to be neat.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, well.

790
00:56:59,672 --> 00:57:01,548
Fast.

791
00:57:01,716 --> 00:57:03,592
Just want to keep
some semblance of organization.

792
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,469
This took somebody
a long time.

793
00:57:05,637 --> 00:57:09,181
Computer: Warning, planetary gravity
affecting course trajectory.

794
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:11,683
That's the plan, girl.

795
00:57:11,851 --> 00:57:13,852
Computer:
lnitiating emergency autopilot

796
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:17,189
failsafe in five, four--

797
00:57:18,775 --> 00:57:20,776
Override accepted.

798
00:57:21,321 --> 00:57:23,406
lmpact risk imminent.

799
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:46,095
l think l got it.

800
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:02,695
Down on the ground now!

801
00:58:04,823 --> 00:58:06,449
Where's your buddy?

802
00:58:09,244 --> 00:58:11,078
Oh, about time.

803
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,081
Where's the file?

804
00:58:16,306 --> 00:58:18,224
Next time,
l'll tie him up.

805
00:58:18,392 --> 00:58:21,185
l'm sorry, they don't teach you how
to tie people up in astronomy school.

806
00:58:21,353 --> 00:58:23,604
l still saved your butt.

807
00:58:31,738 --> 00:58:34,323
- Brooke?
- Brooke: Go ahead, James.

808
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:36,075
l have the location.

809
00:58:36,243 --> 00:58:37,994
Where should we meet you?

810
00:58:40,455 --> 00:58:42,164
Take Highway 37.

811
00:58:42,332 --> 00:58:45,251
We'll meet you
at the junction at Highway 12.

812
00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:48,421
- Brooke: Okay.
- Oh, and l picked this up for later.

813
00:58:48,588 --> 00:58:50,840
Figured we might need it.

814
00:58:52,676 --> 00:58:56,470
- You want a hug?
- Yeah, yeah, l would.

815
00:58:59,516 --> 00:59:02,184
l need those wave calculations.
We're approaching the launch window.

816
00:59:02,352 --> 00:59:05,271
We're working on it.
We just got systems back up.

817
00:59:05,439 --> 00:59:09,108
- We're running out of time.
- l know the time table!

818
00:59:09,276 --> 00:59:11,277
Sir.

819
00:59:13,013 --> 00:59:16,140
Look, Jen,

820
00:59:16,308 --> 00:59:17,558
get a team ready

821
00:59:17,726 --> 00:59:20,436
and take them
over to the fallback facility.

822
00:59:20,603 --> 00:59:22,730
We gotta cover our bases.
lf the systems go down here,

823
00:59:22,897 --> 00:59:24,398
l'm not gonna
be able to launch.

824
00:59:24,566 --> 00:59:27,192
l need you over there
to launch from there.

825
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,112
l'll get you the launch codes.

826
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,365
Michelle, please stay
on those wavelengths.

827
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:34,908
Michelle: Yes, sir.

828
00:59:39,581 --> 00:59:42,041
Matthew: Whoa, stop. Stop the car.
He looks like he's alive.

829
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:45,419
- James: We don't have time for this.
- We can't just leave him here.

830
00:59:45,587 --> 00:59:47,880
- Matthew, get back in the car.
- We can't leave him here.

831
00:59:50,258 --> 00:59:53,552
Matthew, get back in the car!

832
00:59:55,055 --> 00:59:56,680
lt'll be fine.

833
01:00:01,686 --> 01:00:03,354
- Oh, come on.
- Hey, buddy. You okay?

834
01:00:03,989 --> 01:00:06,574
We gotta get you--
we gotta get you--

835
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:11,245
- Get up, nice and slow.
- Hey.

836
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:15,082
- Easy.
- Step away from the car!

837
01:00:16,335 --> 01:00:17,668
- Step away from the car!
- Take it easy, man.

838
01:00:17,836 --> 01:00:19,086
Just take it easy.
Don't do it, James!

839
01:00:19,254 --> 01:00:21,506
Shut up!
You think l'm kidding around?

840
01:00:21,673 --> 01:00:22,882
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Huh?!

841
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:24,592
- Easy, easy.
- Get the hell away from the car!

842
01:00:25,928 --> 01:00:27,345
- Buddy, l can't give you the keys.
- Shut up!

843
01:00:27,513 --> 01:00:29,514
- l can't give you the keys!
- Don't be stupid, man!

844
01:00:29,681 --> 01:00:32,141
- l'll cut his throat!
- l can't give you the car.

845
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:34,310
Oh, you're gonna
give me the car.

846
01:00:35,479 --> 01:00:38,105
- Hey!
- What's this, huh?

847
01:00:38,273 --> 01:00:40,066
What are you doing?

848
01:00:40,234 --> 01:00:42,109
What's this, huh?

849
01:00:42,277 --> 01:00:44,237
- Okay, okay, okay!
- The keys!

850
01:00:44,404 --> 01:00:46,197
- l'm gonna give you the keys.
- Yeah, you will.

851
01:00:46,365 --> 01:00:47,281
- l'll give you the keys.
- Give me the keys.

852
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:49,242
That's good.

853
01:00:53,038 --> 01:00:55,748
- Don't move.
- Dude.

854
01:01:07,386 --> 01:01:09,428
We need to call the kids.

855
01:01:14,268 --> 01:01:16,519
The radio's in the car.

856
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:24,402
lt's happening again.

857
01:01:49,428 --> 01:01:51,304
Hang in there, girl.

858
01:01:54,308 --> 01:01:56,976
Computer: Warning,

859
01:01:57,144 --> 01:01:59,312
Multiple objects
approaching.

860
01:02:03,609 --> 01:02:05,276
We're almost there, girl!

861
01:02:05,444 --> 01:02:07,445
Hold on!

862
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,992
Computer: Warning,

01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:24,164
Computer: All systems critical.

865
01:02:24,332 --> 01:02:26,333
Abort maneuver.

866
01:02:27,752 --> 01:02:30,462
Repeat, abort maneuver.

867
01:02:56,656 --> 01:02:59,033
Where's Matthew?

868
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,368
- You get the part?
- Yeah, but we haven't heard anything

869
01:03:01,536 --> 01:03:02,828
from Victoria yet.

870
01:03:02,996 --> 01:03:04,997
Let's hope she's in the middle
of the maneuver.

871
01:03:05,165 --> 01:03:07,249
We gotta get out of here.
Go!

872
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:14,882
Hold it together
a little longer!

873
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:16,508
Computer:
Trajectory compromised.

874
01:03:16,676 --> 01:03:19,345
Change course immediately.

875
01:03:37,088 --> 01:03:38,630
l have all
the wave patterns mapped

876
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:41,549
and the systems are all up,
and there's still a lot of interference.

877
01:03:44,345 --> 01:03:46,721
Okay, get ready, everyone.

878
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,182
We launch the second
we have a clear shot.

879
01:04:11,372 --> 01:04:13,039
Computer:
Course trajectory complete.

880
01:04:13,207 --> 01:04:15,041
Calculating Nautilus location.

881
01:04:44,196 --> 01:04:45,655
We'll never get through here.

882
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,533
We gotta back up.

883
01:04:48,701 --> 01:04:51,077
We gotta find another way.

884
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:59,544
All right.

885
01:04:59,712 --> 01:05:02,505
- Damn it.
- You're kidding me.

886
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,178
Okay, we are go for launch.

887
01:05:21,776 --> 01:05:25,069
Three, two...

888
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,160
Missiles are away.

889
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:38,458
Alternator's shot.

890
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:40,126
What are we gonna do?

891
01:05:40,294 --> 01:05:42,962
How are we supposed to
get around this thing?

892
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:44,964
Guess we have to walk.

893
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,453
- What are you doing?
- What?

894
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:59,747
l've already been shot at
once today.

895
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,403
This thing goes on
for miles.

896
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,030
Yeah, James.

897
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,699
At this rate, l don't think
we're gonna make it on time.

898
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:42,373
Magnetism is increasing.

899
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:46,252
Mercury is forcing
the missiles off course.

900
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:01,976
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
lt's leaking gas.

901
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:05,479
- You gotta go across to the other side.
- Okay.

902
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,455
No.

903
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:30,587
James?
James, can you hear me?

904
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:33,382
- James.
- Victoria: James?

905
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,553
- Okay, go.
- Hey, Vic.

906
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:41,390
- lt's me.
- Thank God.

907
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:43,642
- Are you safe?
- l am,

908
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,728
and l'm heading away
from Mercury as fast as l can.

909
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:49,690
Have you launched P-7 yet?

910
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,653
We can't.

911
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:57,114
Guidance system's
been damaged.

912
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,659
Hey, honey?
l, uh--

913
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:04,580
l need you
to do something.

914
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:08,500
l don't want to ask you
to do this,

915
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:12,379
but l need you to take
the Nautilus to Project 7

916
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:16,675
and you have to guide it
to Mercury.

917
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,972
l guess l won't be going home
as fast as l thought.

918
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,683
lt's the only chance
we have, honey.

919
01:08:27,062 --> 01:08:28,771
l'll do it.

920
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,773
Now listen to me.

921
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,735
You have to tether in
the Nautilus guidance system to P-7's.

922
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,780
l understand, James.

923
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,866
Now we still have to
do the fixes to P-7.

924
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,869
We have to do that
at the facility.

925
01:08:43,901 --> 01:08:45,944
There's really
not that much time.

926
01:08:47,446 --> 01:08:49,990
l'll get there in time.

927
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:52,826
- l swear to you.
- l trust you.

928
01:08:52,994 --> 01:08:54,703
Go, be safe.

Hey!
Hey, hey!

936
01:09:23,551 --> 01:09:26,345
Great.

937
01:09:26,512 --> 01:09:28,513
- Hey, look.
- Hey, hey.

938
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:33,560
Hey, stop!

939
01:09:33,728 --> 01:09:35,729
Stop!

940
01:09:36,773 --> 01:09:40,025
- Get out of the road.
- We need a ride.

941
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:44,404
Look, l'm not
gonna tell you again.

942
01:09:44,572 --> 01:09:47,532
Listen, l need a ride
to fallback facility.

943
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:51,620
Edward Rex,
he gave me his lD as proof.

944
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:54,623
Just take a look--
just take a look at it.

945
01:09:54,791 --> 01:09:58,210
This lD was stolen this morning.
Get on the ground, Dr. Preston.

946
01:10:01,506 --> 01:10:03,548
Hey.

947
01:10:11,015 --> 01:10:13,100
Back off!

948
01:10:13,267 --> 01:10:15,268
You heard me.

949
01:10:20,233 --> 01:10:23,026
Thank you.

950
01:10:23,194 --> 01:10:25,195

- Yup.

954
01:11:25,631 --> 01:11:27,632

Oh, my God.
Look.

965
01:12:59,433 --> 01:13:01,059
Not again.

966
01:13:23,666 --> 01:13:25,667

James,
she's not breathing, man.

977
01:14:26,047 --> 01:14:27,964
l'm sorry.

978
01:14:28,132 --> 01:14:30,217

- l'm sorry.

979
01:14:38,059 --> 01:14:40,602
Brooke?
Brooke, l'm so sorry.

980
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:43,980
Christopher, we gotta go.

981
01:14:44,148 --> 01:14:46,816
No.

982
01:14:46,984 --> 01:14:49,069
- Christopher.
- Just wait!

983
01:14:49,237 --> 01:14:51,238
Brooke.

984
01:14:55,785 --> 01:15:03,124
l'm sorry.

985
01:15:15,721 --> 01:15:17,722
Wow.

James, can you hear me?

998
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:39,260
l don't see a facility. Are you sure
we got the right coordinates?

999
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:42,347
Yeah, we're here.
The dam is camouflage.

1000
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:45,558
lt's also the power source
for the facility.

1001
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,727
Wow.

1002
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:56,361

- Okay.

1003
01:16:56,528 --> 01:16:58,321
Here.

1004
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,365
- Vic, are you all right?
- Yes,

1005
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:02,200
and l'm tethered
to Project 7's systems.

1006
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:04,327
As soon as l get the updates,
l'm ready to launch.

1007
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:06,746
You have to check
the targeting systems.

1008
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:10,416
lt'll automatically be scanning
an impact threat the size of Mercury.

1009
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:13,920
Oh, no.

1010
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:17,298
- What's the launch window?
- lf l don't get Project 7 moving,

1011
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,842
l'll never close
the gap to Mercury.

1012
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,428
Without the updates,
the shield won't work.

1013
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:26,641
- Then you better hurry.
- We gotta go.

1024
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,970
- Where's the control room?
- lt's directly underneath the dam.

1025
01:18:46,138 --> 01:18:48,306

01:20:20,269 --> 01:20:21,519
Good boy.

1041
01:20:23,564 --> 01:20:26,065
Vic, it's updating right now.

1042
01:20:26,233 --> 01:20:28,276
James, it's too late.

1043
01:20:35,909 --> 01:20:38,077
Hey, don't give up on me!

1044
01:20:38,245 --> 01:20:40,246
Hang in there, okay?

1045
01:20:42,249 --> 01:20:45,001
We need to go!

1046
01:20:45,169 --> 01:20:47,920
- James, listen.
- We need to get out of here!

1047
01:20:48,088 --> 01:20:50,089
Go, go!

1048
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:53,134
Victoria:
Listen to me.

1049
01:20:53,302 --> 01:20:55,845
l love you.

1050
01:20:56,013 --> 01:20:58,765
l love you, too.

Energy field initiating.

1053
01:21:13,906 --> 01:21:17,492
When the shield activates,
get the hell out of there!

1054
01:21:17,659 --> 01:21:20,244
- You hear me?!
- We need to go now!

1055
01:21:20,412 --> 01:21:22,413
Let's go!

1060
01:21:50,943 --> 01:21:52,652
This way, come on!

1061
01:22:08,126 --> 01:22:09,877
Hey, you okay?

1062
01:22:10,045 --> 01:22:11,879
Come on, get up.
We gotta go.

1063
01:22:12,047 --> 01:22:15,049
Get up.
Get up, now.

Computer: Warning,

1065
01:22:22,266 --> 01:22:24,183
Time to go home.

1066
01:22:46,748 --> 01:22:49,250
Oh, my God.

1067
01:22:58,969 --> 01:23:00,887
Yeah!

1068
01:23:15,235 --> 01:23:17,194
James, you were right.

1069
01:23:17,362 --> 01:23:19,614
About everything.

1070
01:23:26,413 --> 01:23:28,205
Victoria knew
what she was doing.

1071
01:23:32,336 --> 01:23:34,629
lf it wasn't for her,
we wouldn't be here, right?

1072
01:23:36,340 --> 01:23:38,507
None of us would.

1073
01:23:41,595 --> 01:23:42,970
Try her.

1074
01:23:44,097 --> 01:23:45,848
- What?
- Try her.

1075
01:23:48,852 --> 01:23:50,853
- Try her.
- Yeah.

1076
01:23:54,942 --> 01:23:56,943
Here.

1077
01:24:00,989 --> 01:24:03,449
Okay.

1078
01:24:04,812 --> 01:24:06,897
Vic, you there?

1079
01:24:11,402 --> 01:24:13,862
Vic, it's James.

1080
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:22,079
Vic, you copy?

1081
01:24:36,219 --> 01:24:38,845
Victoria:
James, do you read?

1082
01:24:45,228 --> 01:24:47,604
You made it.

1083
01:24:47,772 --> 01:24:49,940
Looks like the world did, too.

1084
01:24:58,783 --> 01:25:00,409
Why don't you come on down

1085
01:25:00,576 --> 01:25:03,036
and enjoy the view?

1086
01:25:03,204 --> 01:25:05,414
Victoria:
l'm already on my way.

1087
01:25:12,296 --> 01:25:14,381
And for the record,

1088
01:25:14,549 --> 01:25:16,967
the view up here
isn't so bad either.
