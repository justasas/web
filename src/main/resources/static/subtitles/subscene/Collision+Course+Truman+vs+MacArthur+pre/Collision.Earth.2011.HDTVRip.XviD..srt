7
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:57,737
Someone forget
to secure their tabIet?

8
00:00:57,905 --> 00:00:58,947
Oh.

9
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:02,116
Remind me to fire the maid.

10
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:07,997

- ( eIectronics beeping )
- What's happening?

17
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:52,792
We have an eIectromagnetic
radiation spike, a big one.

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,836
- Are we within safe IeveIs?
- So far.

19
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:01,467
- Lee, stay on course.
- Entering orbit in 20 seconds.

20
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:17,483

- What the heII was that?

22
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:24,616
Radiation levels
are spiking off the charts.

23
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:26,117
Abort orbit capture.

24
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:27,994

00:02:44,845 --> 00:02:46,846
- Are you sure?
- That's what I'm reading.

30
00:02:48,223 --> 00:02:51,517
- Increase thrusters to maximum.
- Come on, darlin'.

31
00:02:58,734 --> 00:03:00,276
Hang in there.

00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:47,240
- Losing power to engines.
- Victoria, check out backup systems.

39
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm on it.

No!

44
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:22,817
Chaos.

45
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:24,902
Destruction.

46
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,155
UnpredictabiIity.

47
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:37,957
Our universe...

48
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,668
is a dangerous pIace.

49
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:43,963
In our soIar system,
there are over

50
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:46,591
a thousand asteroids
and comets

51
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,427
that are cIassified
as threatening to hit the earth.

52
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,890
But you shouId aIso know

53
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:56,934
that those are just the ones
we know about.

54
00:04:58,187 --> 00:05:01,189
Just Iast year,
an asteroid

55
00:05:01,356 --> 00:05:04,150
200 feet in diameter

56
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:06,944
passed within
40,000 miIes of us.

57
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:09,530
Now in pIanetary terms,

58
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:11,699
that is Iike, uh--

59
00:05:13,118 --> 00:05:14,827
it's Iike someone
shooting at you

60
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:17,580
and having a buIIet
part your hair

61
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,459
without touching your skin.

62
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:26,172
Now, if it had hit us,

63
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,843
it would have exploded
with the force of a hydrogen bomb.

64
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:33,596
Do you know how much
advance warning we had?

65
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,309
Three days.

66
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:44,106
The good news is,
we have the technoIogy

67
00:05:44,274 --> 00:05:46,943
to defIect these objects.

68
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,153
It's caIIed Project 7.

69
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,906
The most advanced,
most powerful,

70
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:54,742
most ambitious pIanetary
defense system

71
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,202
ever conceived.

72
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,955
It's equipped
with an energy fieId

73
00:05:59,122 --> 00:06:01,707
that aIIows it to defIect objects
many times its size.

74
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,210
The bad news?

75
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:06,796
- There's aIways bad news.
- ( students Iaugh )

76
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:10,049
Our government puIIed funding
from Project 7

77
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:11,843
just before it came onIine.

78
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,513
So right now
it fIoats dormant in space.

79
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:21,352
The earth's been struck before,
it'II be struck again.

80
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:25,398
The onIy question

81
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:27,692
is whether
we're gonna be ready.

82
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,195
Do your part
in protecting the pIanet.

83
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:33,865
Write to your congressman,
teII your friends.

84
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,201
Spread the word.

85
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,330
Our Iives may depend on it.

86
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:46,210
We need Project 7.

87
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,046
You.

88
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:51,132
You need Project 7.

89
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,219
- Thank you very much.
- ( applause )

90
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:58,639
Dr. Preston, Brad WaIker.

91
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:00,766
Your Iiaison officer
with Mission Ops.

92
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,685
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

93
00:07:02,853 --> 00:07:06,188
- Yeah.
- As you know, it is our poIicy

94
00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:09,775
to, uh, notify
famiIy members immediateIy

95
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:12,153
of any situation invoIving
the mission that may arise.

96
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:15,156
- I know the protocoI.
- Now, I've been sent here

97
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:17,950
to make sure you don't hear
anything through the media

98
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:20,328
that may make you worry
unnecessariIy.

99
00:07:20,495 --> 00:07:23,664
Now, having said that, um,

100
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:27,501
earIy this morning, we did
Iose contact with the NautiIus.

101
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:30,463
Dr. Preston.
Dr. Preston, wait.

102
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:32,590
Dr. Preston.

103
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:45,394
- ( Iine ringing )
- Dr. Preston: Come on, pick up.

104
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:49,273
- ( phone chimes )
- Recording: We're sorry,

105
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,192
your caII cannot
be compIeted as diaIed.

106
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,361
PIease check the number
and dial again...

107
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:55,279
- Damn it!
- ...or caII your oper--

108
00:08:00,285 --> 00:08:02,203
Okay.

109
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:04,288
AII right.

110
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,293
( touch tones beeping )

111
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:12,380
( Iine ringing )

112
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:15,174
( phone rings )

113
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:17,885
- HeIIo?
- Hey, it's James.

114
00:08:18,053 --> 00:08:19,971
I can't taIk to you.
l'm at work.

115
00:08:20,138 --> 00:08:23,057
- lf Edward finds out--
- I'm worried about Victoria.

116
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:25,142
Today was orbit capture.

117
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,646
They Iost contact with the NautiIus.
l can't reach Mission Ops.

118
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:30,606
Do you know anything?

119
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:33,275
l don't, but Houston
doesn't caII the miIitary

120
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:35,319
every time they have a gIitch.
You know that.

121
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:38,072
It's probabIy nothing.
I'm sure Victoria's fine.

122
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,076
I know you have eyes in the sky.
Just check it out for me, okay?

123
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:44,078
CaII me back
if you find anything.

124
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:46,372
You know I can't taIk to you
about this stuff.

125
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,165
Edward doesn't even Iike
that we're friends.

126
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,459
( modem screeching )

127
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:54,547
- What the heII?
- What?

128
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,677
Jennifer, did SPEAR
just activate Project 7?

129
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:01,679
What are you taIking about?
lt's dead.

130
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:02,847
It's been dead for three years.

131
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:06,350
Oh, uh, it's sending me data.

132
00:09:06,518 --> 00:09:08,519
Jennifer:
It's sending data to you?

133
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:10,146
lf Edward finds out that
you've been monitoring it,

134
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:12,273
he'II throw you in jaiI so fast
that you won't know--

135
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:15,609
Okay, uh, something weird
is happening.

136
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:19,280
Project 7
is picking up a strange--

137
00:09:22,284 --> 00:09:25,202
HeIIo?
HeIIo?

138
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:28,664
Okay.

139
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:33,627
Oh, that's impossibIe.

140
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:46,390
( sateIIite beeping )

141
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:07,578
( bridge creaking )

142
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:19,465
- Status report.
- The EM wave knocked out

143
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:22,051
virtually every civilian satellite
and most government ones as weII.

144
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:23,594
We're the onIy major agency

145
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:26,305
fuIIy functioning right now.

146
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:29,350
- But that's not our onIy probIem.
- Three sets of images,

147
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:31,519
aII puIIed from
the deep-sky orbitaI teIescope

148
00:10:31,686 --> 00:10:33,312
before it went down
compIeteIy.

149
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,356
These were all taken
onIy five minutes apart.

150
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:37,024
What's that spot?

151
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:39,944
That spot, sir,

152
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:42,321
- is Mercury.
- That can't be right.

153
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:44,740
- That wouId mean that--
- Mercury's on the move.

154
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:47,201
- How's that possibIe?
- We don't have aII the data yet.

155
00:10:47,369 --> 00:10:49,370
We stiII don't know.

156
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:52,706
( sighs )
Figure out where it's headed.

157
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:54,458
I want to know if that thing
is coming anywhere near us.

158
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:56,627
Jennifer:
We're aIready on it.

159
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:01,590
( computer beeps )

160
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:12,935
( coughs )

161
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:16,105
MarshaII?

162
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,232
Oh, thank God.

163
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,401
Breathe.

164
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:25,906
Check Lee.

165
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,843
( aIarms beeping )

166
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:48,512
Go, I'II take care of Lee.

167
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,683
- ( eIectricity buzzing )
- ( coughs )

168
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,812
Mercury will miss the Earth
by a distance of 500,000 miIes.

169
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,565
RoughIy twice as far away
as the moon.

170
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,317
- That's not good.
- ExactIy.

171
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:03,277
Even at that distance,

172
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:05,196
its gravitationaI fieId
wiII wreak havoc.

173
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:08,824
Extreme tides,
eIectricaI disturbances at a minimum.

174
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:12,870
WeII, our primary concern at this point
has gotta be the poIiticaI faIIout.

175
00:12:13,038 --> 00:12:15,414
Put our defense systems
on high aIert.

176
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:18,751
l've also had Michelle working
to get in touch with the NautiIus,

177
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,544
but we haven't had
any success.

178
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:23,088
Nautilus is the least
of our concerns at this point.

179
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:25,633
But they were right there.

180
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,885
If the NautiIus
did manage to puII through,

181
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:29,762
they may be able
to fiII in the bIanks.

182
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:34,391
Fine, but you keep
James Preston out of it.

183
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,935
Yes, sir.

184
00:12:40,398 --> 00:12:42,399
( static hissing )

185
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:45,736
Man over radio: We are continuing
to receive some frantic reports

186
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:48,322
of massive power faiIures
around the world.

187
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,574
GIobaI communications
continue to be affected,

188
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:53,077
as most sateIIites
seem to be off-Iine.

189
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:56,538
All air transportation
is being grounded untiI further notice.

190
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:58,916
We'II continue to bring you
details as they develop.

191
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:00,668
Oh man.

192
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:09,718
l've normalized our oxygen levels,
but most of our systems are damaged.

193
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:13,514
Communication is down,
as is navigation.

194
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:17,476
Right.
What the heII hit us?

195
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:21,355
It seemed Iike a soIar fIare,
but it was massive.

196
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:23,899
AII of the energy readings
are wrong.

197
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:25,359
WeII, we'II have to worry
about that Iater.

198
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:27,152
Right now we've got
bigger probIems.

199
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,071
I've managed
to stabiIize us.

200
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:31,115
Do what you can with communication.
I'II work on navigation.

201
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:32,616
Okay.

202
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:35,869
We need to figure out
where the heII we are.

203
00:13:36,037 --> 00:13:39,331
- ( beeps )
- ( cIears throat )

204
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:47,965
( footsteps )

205
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:53,262
- Hey.
- Hey.

206
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,847
Check it out.

207
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:57,558
A IittIe Sumatra bIend.
You want some?

208
00:13:57,726 --> 00:14:00,019
I need you to take a Iook
at this, okay?

209
00:14:00,186 --> 00:14:02,396
It's about Victoria.
Something happened up there

210
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:04,815
and l need to know how
it's gonna affect the NautiIus.

211
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:07,318
WeII, it was a massive soIar fIare
that hit us this morning.

212
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:09,236
Biggest one on record,
but the NautiIus shouId be prepared

213
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:11,905
- for that kind of event.
- It's not a soIar fIare.

214
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:13,949
Okay, Iook.

215
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:17,536
Its magnetic signature,
it's off the charts.

216
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:22,249
Oh, my God.

217
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,418
( sizzIing )

218
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:34,553
Are you okay?

219
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:37,389
Yeah, just a headache.

220
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:42,227
Any Iuck on the comm?

221
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:44,271
WeII, we'II onIy be abIe
to transmit

222
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:46,648
and receive
on a very narrow band.

223
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:48,609
But they'II be abIe
to hear us?

224
00:14:50,653 --> 00:14:52,654
If they're Iistening.

225
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,285
Woman on radio:
Power bIackouts.

226
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:01,705
Communication faiIures.
AirpIanes grounded.

227
00:15:01,873 --> 00:15:04,041
The government wants you
to think it's a solar flare,

228
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:06,043
but we are here
to give you the truth.

229
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:09,755
Brooke Adamson's
"Conspiracy Report" is back on the air.

230
00:15:09,923 --> 00:15:11,715
Nice.

231
00:15:11,883 --> 00:15:14,635
- ( static hissing )
- What's wrong?

232
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:16,011
- ( grumbles )
- ( eIectricity buzzing )

233
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:19,181
No, it's just, uh,
getting some interference.

234
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:21,183
- It's not us.
- It's the Feds.

235
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:22,684
- It's not the Feds.
- It's the Feds.

236
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,812
Victoria over radio: This is
Victoria Preston of the USS NautiIus

237
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:26,605
making an emergency
distress call.

238
00:15:26,773 --> 00:15:29,358
Can anybody read?

239
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:31,527
No way.

240
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:35,781
- What?
- ( static hissing )

241
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:39,868
This is Victoria Preston
on the USS NautiIus. Come in.

242
00:15:42,997 --> 00:15:45,624
Isn't the NautiIus the spacecraft
that's on the Mercury mission?

243
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:48,335
- Yeah, yeah.
- WeII, it's gotta be a joke.

244
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:50,587
WeII, we'II find out.

245
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:53,048
First we'II Iock on her signaI.
Here.

246
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:55,384
Um...

247
00:15:57,804 --> 00:15:59,221
copy that, NautiIus.
You're breaking up.

248
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:01,723
- Do you read?
- Copy that.

249
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:04,893
This is Victoria Preston on
the NautiIus. We are in distress.

250
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:12,276
Before we proceed,
please encrypt

251
00:16:12,444 --> 00:16:13,819
this transmission using

252
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:16,947
security protocoI 27-46-32.

253
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:19,825
- What are you doing?
- If it's a hoax, they'II pIay aIong.

254
00:16:19,993 --> 00:16:22,744
- How can you be so sure?
- Because that's what I wouId do.

255
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:25,789
Victoria: There's no such protocoI.
Who exactIy am I speaking with?

256
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:27,416
Give me that.

257
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:30,794
This is Christopher Weaver
and Brooke Adamson.

258
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:33,088
We're seniors
at North Bay University.

259
00:16:33,256 --> 00:16:36,717
You've managed to connect
with our pirate radio station.

260
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:44,433
Victoria, do you copy that?

261
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,852
Come in.

262
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:49,980
- What happened?
- We gotta get that signaI back.

263
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:53,233
Let's go to the car.
We'II try new batteries.

264
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:59,740
Before my teIescope went off-Iine,
l was able to pull these images.

265
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:02,659
Look at these sun-spots.
They're starting to disappear here,

266
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:06,205
and here, here, and here.

267
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:08,916
- What does that mean?
- Magnetism.

268
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:11,418
It aII makes sense now.

269
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:16,048
For one brief miIIisecond,

270
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:18,550
our humbIe IittIe sun
became a magnetar,

271
00:17:18,718 --> 00:17:21,386
the most powerful source
of magnetic energy in the universe.

272
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,599
A magnetar?

273
00:17:26,601 --> 00:17:28,727
Yeah, it's extremeIy rare,

274
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:30,229
but it's the onIy thing
that could explain it.

275
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:33,649
The sun-spots, the bIackouts,
the magnetic wave, everything.

276
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:36,527
- ( Ioud thud )
- What was that?

277
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:53,335
Whoa.

278
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:57,089
This shouId not be happening.

279
00:17:57,257 --> 00:17:58,799
There's no way our database
could have missed

280
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,009
this many meteors
approaching Earth.

281
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:06,181
Buddy,
either you're wrong

282
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:08,350
- or that's not a meteor.
- ( Ioud boom )

283
00:18:10,061 --> 00:18:13,021
That impact site can't be
more than a miIe or two, tops.

284
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:18,610
Let's take my car. I don't want
to have to ride on your handIebars.

285
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:20,988
Very funny.

286
00:18:23,575 --> 00:18:26,493
- Get in the car.
- I enjoy riding my bike to work.

287
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:28,996
- It's something that I Iike to do.
- Get in the car.

288
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,377
Uh, this is not good.

289
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:37,629
Do you know
where we are yet?

290
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,506
No.

291
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:42,384
But we're acceIerating

292
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:43,719
without engine power.

293
00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:50,225
Well, you check autopilot and see
if there's been any faIse commands

294
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:52,394
and I'II see what I can do.

295
00:18:54,856 --> 00:18:56,857
Yes, ma'am.

296
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:00,736
Wow.

297
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:03,447
Something's definiteIy wrong.

298
00:19:04,449 --> 00:19:06,450
( expIosions )

299
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,129
- There's stiII no signaI.
- I don't know.

300
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:21,089
Do you think that
was reaIIy the NautiIus?

301
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:23,884
Yeah, I do.
I do.

302
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:27,596
- ( gasps )
- Whoa!

303
00:19:27,764 --> 00:19:30,932
- What the heII was that?
- l don't know,

304
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,934
but there's more coming.
Get in the car.

305
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:34,978
Get in the car!

306
00:19:35,146 --> 00:19:36,980
- ( expIosions continue )
- James?

307
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:39,483
Run. Run!

308
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:51,036
Get down!

309
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:00,671
Oh, boy.

310
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:15,435
Is it over?

311
00:20:15,603 --> 00:20:17,229
I think so.

312
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:19,398
What the heII happened?

313
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:26,196
( sizzIing )

314
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:43,755
Matthew: Whoa.

315
00:20:51,806 --> 00:20:53,890
Computer:
Navigation systems initiaIizing.

316
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:58,603
- ( beeps )
- FIight path compromised.

317
00:21:00,106 --> 00:21:03,233
MarshaII, I've checked everything.
l can't find anything wrong.

318
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:04,901
Get up here.
I need your heIp with navigation.

319
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:08,029
We need to figure out
where we're headed now.

320
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:21,752
- And we are back up.
- Computer: PIotting NautiIus Iocation.

321
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,921
- MarshaII: Wait, this can't be right.
- What is it?

322
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:27,090
We're not where we shouId be.

323
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:33,138
Neither is Mercury.

324
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,475
How is that possibIe?

325
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:38,643
Marshall:
I don't know. It's out of orbit.

326
00:21:38,811 --> 00:21:42,147
No. We're acceIerating
towards the pIanet.

327
00:21:43,232 --> 00:21:45,859
Mercury is dragging us in?

328
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:48,028
But we're not cIose enough
to be in its gravity.

329
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:49,863
Whatever it is,
I don't want to be any cIoser.

330
00:21:51,741 --> 00:21:53,450
Computer:
Reverse thrusters engaged.

331
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:01,166
Victoria, we need
to get a hoId of Mission Ops.

332
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:03,084
Right.

333
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,248
Okay.

334
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:43,333
Maybe.

335
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:45,794
- ( static hissing )
- Ground, do you copy?

336
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:47,420
Can you hear me?

337
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,800
Ground, this is Victoria.
Do you copy?

338
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:55,262
Thrusters are at 70%.
I don't Iike this.

339
00:22:57,431 --> 00:23:00,183
- ( static hissing )
- Ground, this is Victoria. Do you copy?

340
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:04,354
- Yeah, Victoria. We're here.
- Oh, thank God.

341
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:08,191
I need you to get in touch
with Mission ControI. It's urgent.

342
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:10,569
WeII, if you're trying to warn us
about meteors,

343
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:13,947
- you're a IittIe Iate for that.
- Christopher, the NautiIus

344
00:23:14,115 --> 00:23:16,741
has been knocked off course.
I need Mission Ops to guide us.

345
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:18,910
MarshaII: Come on.
( grunts )

346
00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:24,207
Mission Ops is in Houston.
We're in Oregon and the phones are down.

347
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,501
Oregon, okay.

348
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:30,171
I need you to get to a faciIity
south of SeattIe caIIed SPEAR.

349
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:33,216
SPEAR. l know that.
My cousin Iives nearby.

350
00:23:33,384 --> 00:23:36,428
Okay, great. When you get there,
ask for a person named Jennifer KeIIy.

351
00:23:36,596 --> 00:23:39,139
TeII her what I've toId you,
that we need Mission Ops

352
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:41,850
to guide NautiIus, and give her
this frequency to get in touch.

353
00:23:42,018 --> 00:23:45,854
And, please,
our Iives depend on it.

354
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:47,522
We're on it.
Let's go.

355
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:59,284
It has an extremeIy high
iron content.

356
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:02,787
Way too high for
an ordinary piece of meteorite.

357
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:06,458
This might sound crazy,
but I think this is a piece of Mercury.

358
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:17,010
It's a magnetized piece
of Mercury.

359
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,014
lf it was hit
by the magnetar wave,

360
00:24:21,182 --> 00:24:22,557
that wouId expIain
why it's magnetic.

361
00:24:22,725 --> 00:24:24,684
Even so,

362
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:26,853
how are pieces of it
down here?

363
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:31,107
I don't know.

364
00:24:43,245 --> 00:24:45,872
- ( beeping )
- Thrusters are at maximum.

365
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,334
- We're stiII being puIIed in.
- I can do a manuaI override

366
00:24:49,502 --> 00:24:51,127
in the engine room
to boost the thrusters,

367
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:53,505
but it's a temporary fix at best.

368
00:24:53,673 --> 00:24:55,465
- Do it!
- Got it!

369
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:05,266
This is weird.

370
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:07,519
You want to read me
those coordinates again?

371
00:25:07,687 --> 00:25:10,230
Yeah. Uh...

372
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:12,023
- right ascension...
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:14,943
- ...13 hours...
- Mm-hmm.

374
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:16,778
- ...17 minutes.
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:18,154
- DecIination...
- Yeah.

376
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:20,240
..negative-7 degrees...

377
00:25:20,408 --> 00:25:23,410
- Yeah.
- ...2 arcminutes.

378
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:26,454
It's not there.

379
00:25:28,332 --> 00:25:30,834
What are you taIking about?

380
00:25:31,002 --> 00:25:32,627
- It's not there.
- Where is it?

381
00:25:32,795 --> 00:25:34,671
l don't know.
It's just-- it's gone.

382
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:37,507
- Do you mind?
- lt's just gone.

383
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:39,175
Okay.

384
00:25:41,012 --> 00:25:42,220
They were right there.

385
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:48,143
Mercury was right--

386
00:25:55,943 --> 00:25:57,527
they were right there.

387
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:03,283
All right, that--
that's impossibIe.

388
00:26:05,411 --> 00:26:07,495
A pIanet doesn't just move.

389
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:11,207
What are you gonna do?

390
00:26:15,588 --> 00:26:17,464
I'm gonna get some answers.

391
00:26:25,139 --> 00:26:28,266
MarshaII, I got you another 20% ,

392
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:30,685
but that's the best I couId do.

393
00:26:30,853 --> 00:26:32,645
Let's hope it's enough.

394
00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:46,493
There's not enough power
in the reverse thrusters.

395
00:26:47,703 --> 00:26:50,371
l need to flip us around
and engage the main engine.

396
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:53,083
That's too risky.
We can't use the reverse thrusters

397
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,044
and turn the ship at the same time.
We'd be puIIed in immediateIy.

398
00:26:57,588 --> 00:26:59,297
- Not if we do it fast enough.
- We?

399
00:26:59,465 --> 00:27:01,382
It's a two-man job, Victoria.

400
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,219
But I'm not a piIot.

401
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:06,387
WeIcome to your promotion.

402
00:27:12,561 --> 00:27:16,481
Victoria, reduce power by 20%
when I boost the main engines.

403
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:18,274
Copy that.

404
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:20,401
Now!

405
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:22,570
Reducing power.

406
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:31,121
We're being
puIIed in sideways.

407
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,960
Marshall?
MarshaII?!

408
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:44,801
( growIs )

409
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:58,565
Maneuver successfuIIy executed.

410
00:28:04,655 --> 00:28:07,615
Okay, I need you
to take over for a whiIe.

411
00:28:07,783 --> 00:28:09,742
What's wrong?

412
00:28:12,496 --> 00:28:14,205
What's the matter?

413
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:16,666
I think I might have got hit hard--

414
00:28:18,752 --> 00:28:20,503
MarshaII!

415
00:28:30,723 --> 00:28:31,806
Yes?

416
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:33,433
We need to see
Jennifer KeIIy right away.

417
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:35,685
- And you are?
- We have an urgent message

418
00:28:35,853 --> 00:28:37,854
from Victoria Preston
and the NautiIus spacecraft.

419
00:28:38,022 --> 00:28:39,606
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

420
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:41,608
- So if you couId just pIease--
- Excuse me, sir,

421
00:28:41,775 --> 00:28:44,402
the NautiIus is having
severe mechanicaI maIfunctions

422
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,737
and they can't
get a hoId of Mission Ops,

423
00:28:45,905 --> 00:28:47,447
but they can
get a hoId of my radio.

424
00:28:47,615 --> 00:28:50,575
- We were sent here to see Jennifer--
- This is a secure facility.

425
00:28:50,743 --> 00:28:52,994
No one gets in without
an appointment or a pass.

426
00:28:53,162 --> 00:28:55,371
- Yeah, I understand that, but--
- That was me teIIing you niceIy.

427
00:28:55,539 --> 00:28:59,375
Don't make me teII you again.
Let's go.

428
00:28:59,543 --> 00:29:00,960
- Great.
- Guard: Let's go.

429
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,771
( ship creaking )

430
00:29:32,952 --> 00:29:36,329
James, I know what must be
going through your head right now.

431
00:29:37,665 --> 00:29:39,666
Then you'II stop
the small talk.

432
00:29:40,668 --> 00:29:43,670
It's just we don't know
anything for sure yet.

433
00:29:43,837 --> 00:29:47,048
There's a very good chance
that she's alive.

434
00:29:47,216 --> 00:29:50,301
Mercury didn't disappear.
It was knocked out of orbit.

435
00:29:50,469 --> 00:29:53,054
- I tracked its gravity--
- And my wife...

436
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:56,474
probabIy shouId be waIking
on Mercury right now.

437
00:29:56,642 --> 00:30:00,395
Now pieces of it
are Ianding on the Earth.

438
00:30:02,189 --> 00:30:03,690
You understand?

439
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:41,144
They didn't beIieve us.

440
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:43,730
- The guard wouIdn't even caII Jennifer.
- Fascist.

441
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:45,898
What shouId we do now?

442
00:30:56,035 --> 00:30:58,828
Find my husband,
Dr. James Preston.

443
00:30:58,996 --> 00:31:01,914
He'II be at our home
in Pacific Grove.

444
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:05,084
433 Ocean Beach Drive.

445
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:09,839
Come on, James.

446
00:31:14,845 --> 00:31:17,638
Look, I don't care if your faciIity's
on lockdown, okay?

447
00:31:17,806 --> 00:31:20,600
Try her number again
'cause I need to taIk to her.

448
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:23,603
- Sir, you need to caIm down.
- Oh, I need to caIm down?

449
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:25,563
I used to work here, okay?
l can't call her

450
00:31:25,731 --> 00:31:28,232
because my phone doesn't work.
lt's urgent.

451
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:31,736
Stand down.

452
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:35,615
James, you need to leave.
You know you can't be here.

453
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:37,575
l can't share
cIassified information with you.

454
00:31:37,743 --> 00:31:40,745
What about Mercury?
ls that classified?

455
00:31:42,706 --> 00:31:44,624
- Look, we know aII about Mercury.
- Do you?

456
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:48,127
Do you aIso know
it's magnetized?

457
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:53,633
He's with me.

458
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:56,636
You, stay there.

459
00:32:00,724 --> 00:32:02,725
( woman speaking over P.A. )

460
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:11,025
- What the heII is he doing here?
- Show him.

461
00:32:22,955 --> 00:32:24,664
Nice trick.
So what?

462
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:28,501
This thing,
this was attached to Mercury.

463
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:39,762
You have to recaIcuIate
the planet's trajectory

464
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,806
based on magnetism.

465
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:45,768
What exactly
are you trying to teII me?

466
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,313
Massive magnetar wave
hit Mercury.

467
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:51,816
lt is now
extremeIy magnetized.

468
00:32:51,984 --> 00:32:53,484
If it's anywhere near Earth,

469
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:55,862
it'II Iock on to our magnetic fieId--

470
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,782
it'II come straight for us.

471
00:33:02,536 --> 00:33:04,370
WeII, we've tracked its trajectory,

472
00:33:04,538 --> 00:33:06,789
and whiIe it is headed our way,

473
00:33:06,957 --> 00:33:10,334
we're comfortabIy certain
that it will miss us.

474
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:13,212
You're not factoring in
the magnetism.

475
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,298
You have to recaIcuIate.

476
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:27,185
Based on our new data,
the caIcuIations show

477
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,146
the trajectory has changed.

478
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:32,482
Oh, my God.

479
00:33:32,649 --> 00:33:34,525
Mercury's on
a coIIision course with Earth.

480
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:35,943
Look at the distance
it's covered.

481
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:39,739
- lt's moving faster.
- It's Iocked on to us.

482
00:33:39,907 --> 00:33:41,532
Earth's magnetic fieId
is drawing it in.

483
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,242
It's Iike two magnets
puIIing it together.

484
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,620
This is beyond
an extinction IeveI event.

485
00:33:45,787 --> 00:33:49,165
- This is the end of the worId.
- How Iong have we got?

486
00:33:55,714 --> 00:33:57,381
Just over 18 hours.

487
00:33:59,176 --> 00:34:01,844
Okay, people, this is why
we have a contingency pIan.

488
00:34:02,012 --> 00:34:05,806
Initiate Operation Recourse.
I wanna be onIine in 30 minutes.

489
00:34:05,974 --> 00:34:07,975
Jennifer: Yes, sir.

490
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:11,771
Edward...

491
00:34:11,939 --> 00:34:13,981
Operation Recourse won't work.

492
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:18,402
Your missiIes aren't strong enough
to stop a planet.

493
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,822
We are not trying
to stop Mercury.

494
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,574
We're gonna defIect it.

495
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:26,244
The missiIes wiII cause
coordinated standoff expIosions

496
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:28,829
in front of the pIanet
and drive it off course.

497
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:30,915
l already know
what your pIan is.

498
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,959
You're assuming
that your guidance system

499
00:34:33,126 --> 00:34:35,002
will withstand
a magnetic interference

500
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,922
and synchronize the bIast.

501
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,590
They can go off course.

502
00:34:39,758 --> 00:34:41,217
They couId expIode
before they get there.

503
00:34:41,385 --> 00:34:43,886
Worse, they get sucked back
into the planet,

504
00:34:44,054 --> 00:34:46,889
they bIow it to fragments,
they wipe us out anyway!

505
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:50,351
Our missiles
are properIy shieIded.

506
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:53,563
Not against this.

507
00:34:54,565 --> 00:34:57,191
Going ahead with this Iaunch,

508
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,361
you're choosing suicide
over a firing squad.

509
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:06,701
Your sarcasm
is reaIIy better suited

510
00:35:06,868 --> 00:35:08,786
to your community
college lectures.

511
00:35:08,954 --> 00:35:11,622
You don't have a say
in what we do here.

512
00:35:15,085 --> 00:35:18,296
We Iaunch as soon as Mercury
is within our firing range.

513
00:35:19,756 --> 00:35:22,466
( technicians murmuring )

514
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,853
James:
Edward, Edward, Iisten.

515
00:35:34,021 --> 00:35:35,313
What about Project 7?

516
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,273
This is exactIy
what it was designed for.

517
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:40,651
The defIector never worked
in fieId testing, not once.

518
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:43,571
Without that,
it's just a big rock with engines.

519
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:46,741
We've been modifying the software,
we've been working out the bugs.

520
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:49,327
You pulled it so you
can give your contracts

521
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:51,412
to your rocket
manufacturing buddies.

522
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,040
WeII, if that's the way you want to see
your faiIure, that's your business,

523
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:56,500
but, regardIess,
we don't have time to dust it off now.

524
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:59,003
I can get
the defIector fieId to work.

525
00:36:00,005 --> 00:36:02,757
l've been uploading
the software since I Ieft.

526
00:36:02,924 --> 00:36:04,967
l'm sorry.
You've been doing what?

527
00:36:05,135 --> 00:36:08,179
- Hacking into a government weapon?
- That's my weapon.

528
00:36:08,347 --> 00:36:11,390
lt hasn't been your weapon
since I fired you three years ago.

529
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:15,186
I couId have you thrown
in prison for this.

530
00:36:15,354 --> 00:36:17,271
It'II work.

531
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:22,735
Just gotta Iet me
upIoad the fixes.

532
00:36:22,903 --> 00:36:24,487
We don't have the time

533
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:26,864
or resources
to Iaunch two programs.

534
00:36:27,032 --> 00:36:29,700
We're onIy gonna get
one shot at this...

535
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:33,037
and I am not gonna risk
the fate of humanity

536
00:36:33,205 --> 00:36:34,872
on your unproven technoIogy.

537
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:38,459
I think you know
the way out.

538
00:36:38,627 --> 00:36:40,628
Okay.

539
00:36:44,758 --> 00:36:47,760
- Chris: Wait.
- ( tires screech )

540
00:36:49,513 --> 00:36:51,263
- Which way?
- I don't know.

541
00:36:51,431 --> 00:36:53,057
Is this North Coast Road?

542
00:36:53,225 --> 00:36:54,850
l don't know.
There's no road signs.

543
00:36:55,018 --> 00:36:56,644
Let's try this way.

544
00:37:13,245 --> 00:37:15,871
And you're sure P-7 is the key
to stopping Mercury?

545
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,998
- Stake my life on it.
- Sounds Iike you'II be staking

546
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:20,626
- everyone's life on it, James.
- My software updates wiII work.

547
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:23,170
We just need to upIoad them
to get P-7 fully online.

548
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:26,632
- That sounds easy enough.
- We just need to go to my office,

549
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,010
get the software, then we need
a secure SPEAR computer.

550
00:37:30,178 --> 00:37:32,680
Did you say we?

551
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,256
HeIIo?
Mr. Preston?

552
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:11,218
- ( tires screeching )
- ( rumbling )

553
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,181
Whoa.

554
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,351
- Hey, hey, keep the car straight.
- lt's not me.

555
00:38:21,104 --> 00:38:23,105
It's the ground that's moving.

556
00:38:25,108 --> 00:38:26,901
Whoa.

557
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:35,326
Oh, my God.

558
00:38:43,126 --> 00:38:45,127
( car horns honking )

559
00:39:04,147 --> 00:39:05,606
( car aIarms bIaring )

560
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:11,737
- It's metaI.
- What?

561
00:39:11,905 --> 00:39:13,989
lt's not trees,
it's not teIephone poIes.

562
00:39:14,157 --> 00:39:18,244
Whatever that is,
it onIy affected metaI.

563
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:24,166
This must aII be
connected to Mercury.

564
00:39:25,377 --> 00:39:26,752
It has to be.

565
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,969
Jennifer: That's not good.
That's not good at all.

566
00:39:36,137 --> 00:39:38,222
We've just received report--
SeattIe's been devastated

567
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,349
by a massive magnetic event.

568
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:44,770
- How far are we from Iaunching?
- We've had to recalculate.

569
00:39:44,938 --> 00:39:47,606
Mercury's speeding up and we're having
a hard time keeping a lock on it.

570
00:39:47,774 --> 00:39:49,692
We have a very smaII window
to launch these missiles

571
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,610
and we're running
out of time.

572
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,739
What happened
to your security pass?

573
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:01,871
- Find Preston.
- Yes, sir.

574
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:05,958
- Just follow me.
- ( distant dog barking )

575
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:12,214
Oh, wait.
I read on the Internet somewhere

576
00:40:12,382 --> 00:40:15,092
that you can open up any door
with a credit card.

577
00:40:18,013 --> 00:40:20,264
I think, eh,
yeah, you just--

578
00:40:21,266 --> 00:40:23,267
I don't know.

579
00:40:26,521 --> 00:40:28,272
PeopIe never Ieave
these things Iocked.

580
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,274
Right.

581
00:40:30,442 --> 00:40:33,110
Mr. Preston?

582
00:40:33,278 --> 00:40:36,155
Is anyone home?

583
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,201
HeIIo?

584
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:45,956
Hey, come here.

585
00:40:48,293 --> 00:40:50,377
God, the phones
stiII aren't working.

586
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:56,216
There's nothing here.
Nothing usefuI anyways.

587
00:40:56,384 --> 00:40:58,260
( Iights buzzing )

588
00:40:58,428 --> 00:41:00,429
( computer, modem
beeping and buzzing )

589
00:41:05,101 --> 00:41:07,603
- What is that?
- I don't know.

590
00:41:08,772 --> 00:41:11,273
Looks Iike some kind of weapon.

591
00:41:21,076 --> 00:41:23,077
Whose car is that?

592
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:31,251
What kind of guy keeps pIans
for a top secret weapon on his computer?

593
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:34,296
Brooke: If he were here right now,
I'd give him a piece of my mind.

594
00:41:36,508 --> 00:41:37,925
What the hell
are you doing in my house?

595
00:41:38,093 --> 00:41:40,219
- Look, your wife sent us.
- What are you taIking about?

596
00:41:40,387 --> 00:41:42,304
We taIked to her.
She's in trouble.

597
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:43,931
- Brooke: We can prove it.
- Yeah.

598
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:46,225
What?

599
00:41:46,393 --> 00:41:47,977
WeII, it's just over there.

600
00:41:48,144 --> 00:41:49,853
PIease?

601
00:41:52,232 --> 00:41:55,818
So l used
some of today's engineering

602
00:41:55,986 --> 00:41:58,320
with yesterday's
anaIog technoIogy

603
00:41:58,488 --> 00:42:02,491
with a few experimentaI bits
here and there and voiIà.

604
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:06,412
lt broadcasts and receives
farther than you can imagine.

605
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:11,291
WeII, it's a work of art.

606
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,336
lt's how we heard
Victoria's mayday.

607
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,052
- You wanna turn it on?
- Yeah, sorry.

608
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,931
( static hissing )

609
00:42:33,356 --> 00:42:36,150
Okay.
Yeah, cooI.

610
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,657
Vic, you there?

611
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:50,706
Victoria?

612
00:42:53,209 --> 00:42:54,835
Victoria:
Ground, can you pIease repeat?

613
00:42:57,672 --> 00:42:59,423
Vic, it's me.
Um...

614
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,386
- you safe?
- I'm aIive,

615
00:43:04,554 --> 00:43:06,513
but I'm the onIy one Ieft.

616
00:43:10,435 --> 00:43:12,478
James: What happened?
Are you okay?

617
00:43:12,645 --> 00:43:16,023
Something crazy has happened
and l can't really explain it,

618
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:18,901
but I'm being puIIed
into Mercury.

619
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:21,487
Oh, my God,
the magnetism.

620
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:26,825
Vic, there's been
a huge magnetic event.

621
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:29,995
Yes, l know.
We were right in the middIe of it.

622
00:43:30,163 --> 00:43:34,166
Mercury's been magnetized
and is being pushed out of its orbit.

623
00:43:35,668 --> 00:43:38,545
Magnetism.
Why didn't I think of this?

624
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:40,589
Okay,
if I can recaIcuIate,

625
00:43:40,757 --> 00:43:42,966
if l can account
for the difference in force,

626
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:45,719
I might be abIe to break free
and come home.

627
00:43:47,847 --> 00:43:50,557
Vic, there might not be a home
to come back to.

628
00:43:53,812 --> 00:43:56,522
Mercury's on
a coIIision course with Earth.

629
00:44:05,907 --> 00:44:09,493
Can you keep me posted on this
and just double-check these?

630
00:44:09,661 --> 00:44:11,328
Woman:
I just Iost everything.

631
00:44:11,496 --> 00:44:13,413
What is going on?

632
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:15,541
This faciIity shouId be impervious
to power surges.

633
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:17,209
Mercury's interference
is increasing.

634
00:44:17,377 --> 00:44:19,753
It's becoming more
than our shieIding can handIe.

635
00:44:19,921 --> 00:44:22,464
Get the emergency generators
back online.

636
00:44:22,632 --> 00:44:26,093
The moment they stabilize,
I want those missiIes in the air!

637
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:27,928
Edward,
what if James is right?

638
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,475
Move aside.

639
00:44:35,979 --> 00:44:38,564
Project 7 is the only thing
that can save us from Mercury.

640
00:44:38,731 --> 00:44:40,440
You need to get the heII
out of there before we Iaunch.

641
00:44:40,608 --> 00:44:42,609
Victoria:
Okay, I've done everything I can

642
00:44:42,777 --> 00:44:44,570
to recaIcuIate
for the change in force.

643
00:44:44,737 --> 00:44:46,780
I've tried to boost the engines
as much as possible,

644
00:44:46,948 --> 00:44:49,825
but it's just not enough thrust.

645
00:44:55,707 --> 00:44:58,625
Wait a minute.
What if I Iet it puII me in?

646
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,881
- What do you mean?
- A sIingshot maneuver.

647
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:09,303
Yes, yes, yes.
She Iets the pIanet puII her in,

648
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,347
acceIerating around Mercury.
That wiII give her the extra momentum

649
00:45:12,515 --> 00:45:15,100
she needs to break free.

650
00:45:15,268 --> 00:45:17,227
That's a suicide mission.

651
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:20,856
- Magnetism is too unpredictable.
- Victoria: I've been trained for this.

652
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:25,402
Honey, honey.

653
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:28,197
You're not a piIot.
You've never done this before.

654
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:31,575
I have to try.
If I stay here, I'm dead.

655
00:45:31,743 --> 00:45:33,785
It's my onIy chance.

656
00:45:36,122 --> 00:45:38,290
No, no, no, no.

657
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:40,918
Vic?
Vic?!

658
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:43,295
- James, can you hear me?
- ( static hissing )

659
00:45:43,463 --> 00:45:45,130
Sorry, it's fragiIe.

660
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:47,716
lt wasn't built
to be dragged around Iike this.

661
00:45:55,642 --> 00:45:57,643
- Can you hear me?
- ( static hissing )

662
00:46:11,241 --> 00:46:15,369
- Disengage autopilot.
- Computer: AutopiIot disengaged.

663
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:20,540
Here goes nothing.

664
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:27,256
- She'II make it, she'II make it.
- ( modem screeching )

665
00:46:27,423 --> 00:46:29,883
She's gonna make it.
She's gonna be aII right.

666
00:46:31,386 --> 00:46:33,387
What is that?

667
00:46:38,268 --> 00:46:40,686
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- What's wrong?

668
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:44,481
Project 7's guidance systems
are damaged.

669
00:46:44,649 --> 00:46:46,608
- Can't you fix it?
- It's not a software probIem,

670
00:46:46,776 --> 00:46:49,319
it's hardware.
You can't fix it from the ground.

671
00:46:50,738 --> 00:46:54,408
- So that's it?
- Um, the NautiIus.

672
00:46:54,575 --> 00:46:57,077
The NautiIus has
an amazing guidance system.

673
00:46:57,245 --> 00:46:59,955
If Victoria can piIot the ship
to Project 7,

674
00:47:00,123 --> 00:47:01,623
tether onto its system,

675
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:05,085
we can then use it to manuaIIy guide
the asteroid straight into Mercury.

676
00:47:05,253 --> 00:47:06,837
We stiII have to do
the software updates.

677
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:08,714
Without the energy fieId,
you won't have enough force

678
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:10,465
to knock Mercury off course.

679
00:47:10,633 --> 00:47:12,676
- So send them.
- I can't do it from here.

680
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:14,636
Can monitor the systems,

681
00:47:14,804 --> 00:47:16,138
but to change anything,
I need a computer

682
00:47:16,306 --> 00:47:18,390
that has top-level
cIassified access.

683
00:47:18,558 --> 00:47:20,600
- And you need to fix that radio.
- ( electricity buzzing )

684
00:47:20,768 --> 00:47:22,644
That's another power surge.

685
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:29,776
- ( buzzes )
- Come on.

686
00:47:29,944 --> 00:47:31,737
Come on,
come on, come on.

687
00:47:46,586 --> 00:47:48,587
Here we go,
here we go.

688
00:47:50,173 --> 00:47:52,174
- ( beeps )
- l got it.

689
00:47:54,552 --> 00:47:55,594
Whoa.

690
00:47:55,762 --> 00:47:58,764
Yes, Mr. President. Believe me,
we're doing everything we can.

691
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,601
No, sir. These are
Iimited range missiIes.

692
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:04,686
The timing is cruciaI.

693
00:48:04,854 --> 00:48:06,980
If we Iaunch too earIy
the missiIes wiII faII short,

694
00:48:07,148 --> 00:48:10,692
too late, and Mercury won't be
knocked off course enough to miss Earth.

695
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,444
( feedback )

696
00:48:12,612 --> 00:48:14,529
- Mr. President, are you there?
- ( dial tone )

697
00:48:14,697 --> 00:48:16,698
Mr. President?

698
00:48:30,296 --> 00:48:33,673
- I'm gonna need a new reIay.
- There's an oId airstrip.

699
00:48:33,841 --> 00:48:35,634
One of the radio planes
might have what you need.

700
00:48:35,802 --> 00:48:37,219
Right, I saw it on the way in.

701
00:48:37,387 --> 00:48:39,763
Here, once we get the radio up
and running, we'II caII you on it.

702
00:48:39,931 --> 00:48:42,682
Okay. Is this even gonna work
with all the interference?

703
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:45,852
Trust me, we reached Mercury
with this thing. lt'll work.

704
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,480
You gonna tell me
where we're going?

705
00:48:48,648 --> 00:48:49,898
The faIIback faciIity.

706
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:52,567
- Which is what exactIy?
- Designed when I was working at SPEAR.

707
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,611
They shouId have access
to every weapon,

708
00:48:54,779 --> 00:48:57,656
- incIuding Project 7.
- ShouId have access?

709
00:48:57,824 --> 00:48:59,533
The coordinates
are in records storage.

710
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,202
- We don't even know where it is?
- That's why we're hurrying.

711
00:49:29,313 --> 00:49:31,314
HeIIo?

712
00:49:32,775 --> 00:49:34,359
Anybody here?

713
00:49:35,445 --> 00:49:36,987
If we're gonna find
that reIay switch,

714
00:49:37,155 --> 00:49:40,365
- we better start looking for it.
- I don't know. This pIace is creepy.

715
00:49:40,533 --> 00:49:42,742
- l don't like it.
- It's a creepy oId airstrip.

716
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:45,787
What did you expect?

717
00:49:45,955 --> 00:49:48,081
- Here, this Iooks Iike the hangar.
- Okay.

718
00:49:53,004 --> 00:49:54,504
HeIIo?

719
00:49:55,548 --> 00:49:57,591
- I think this is the hangar.
- Okay.

720
00:49:57,758 --> 00:49:59,968
- Let's check the yard here.
- Okay.

721
00:50:02,472 --> 00:50:04,598
- Anything?
- No.

722
00:50:04,765 --> 00:50:06,600
- Here.
- What exactIy are we Iooking for?

723
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:08,852
We're Iooking for a radio
that's stiII intact.

724
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,021
Okay.

725
00:50:22,033 --> 00:50:24,284
No, these are aII sheIIs.

726
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:26,453
- We need to get to that hangar.
- Okay.

727
00:50:33,544 --> 00:50:35,462
Hey.

728
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:45,847
( rumbIing )

729
00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:48,767
- Quick.
- What's happening?

730
00:50:48,935 --> 00:50:51,728
- I don't know.
- Is it more meteors?

731
00:50:51,896 --> 00:50:53,688
l don't think so.
It feeIs more Iike an earthquake.

732
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:57,025
- Earthquake?
- Worse, we're being hit by

733
00:50:57,193 --> 00:50:59,110
massive waves
of eIectromagnetic energy.

734
00:50:59,278 --> 00:51:00,904
We still can't risk
Iaunching too earIy.

735
00:51:01,072 --> 00:51:02,656
If this EM interference
increases,

736
00:51:02,823 --> 00:51:03,907
you won't be abIe
to Iaunch the missiIes.

737
00:51:04,075 --> 00:51:06,034
You can't fire
when the interference is spiking.

738
00:51:06,202 --> 00:51:08,870
Okay, then caIcuIate intervaIs
in between the wavelengths

739
00:51:09,038 --> 00:51:11,164
- and we'II fire in between.
- Yes, sir.

740
00:51:13,834 --> 00:51:16,336
- Is it over?
- I think so.

741
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:19,756
Okay, maybe this plane
wiII have what we need.

742
00:51:19,924 --> 00:51:21,841
Let's find out.

743
00:51:22,009 --> 00:51:24,970
Computer:
Trajectory caIcuIations compIete.

744
00:51:27,265 --> 00:51:28,932
- ( beeping )
- Warning,

745
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,892
possible

746
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,687
Recommend
repIotting trajectory.

747
00:51:51,414 --> 00:51:54,541
Project 7.
Stupid.

748
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:56,543
What were
Projects 1 through 6?

749
00:51:57,753 --> 00:51:59,754
I don't even want to know.

750
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:04,968
- Any luck?
- I think I got it.

751
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,892
- ( static hissing )
- Yes.

752
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:16,605
We're in business.
Okay, Iet's get out of here.

753
00:52:16,772 --> 00:52:18,773
Okay.

754
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:24,070
Stop where you are
or I'II drop you where you stand.

755
00:52:24,238 --> 00:52:26,948
What the heII are you doing
with my pIane?

756
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:30,160
- Sir--
- Shut up!

757
00:52:30,328 --> 00:52:32,829
Here's what's gonna happen.

758
00:52:32,997 --> 00:52:36,499
You're gonna drop that,
you're just gonna--

759
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:39,461
you're gonna slowly
put that down on the ground.

760
00:52:39,629 --> 00:52:41,755
- Yeah.
- And you're gonna put

761
00:52:41,922 --> 00:52:43,298
- your hands in the air.
- Right, okay.

762
00:52:43,466 --> 00:52:45,008
Sir, we needed one part.

763
00:52:45,176 --> 00:52:47,552
We've been communicating
with the spacecraft NautiIus.

764
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,262
Sure, you have.
Hands in the air now!

765
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:52,182
Brooke: You don't understand.
This is a matter of Iife and death.

766
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:55,560
- We can't leave without that radio.
- You're gonna Ieave without the radio

767
00:52:55,728 --> 00:52:58,605
because it's my radio.

768
00:52:58,773 --> 00:53:00,857
You know what I mean?

769
00:53:01,025 --> 00:53:03,026
It's my radio.

770
00:53:08,199 --> 00:53:10,200
Hurry!
Go, go!

771
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:13,411
Say your prayers,
you little bastard!

772
00:53:20,461 --> 00:53:22,295
How are we
supposed to get inside?

773
00:53:22,463 --> 00:53:24,464
There's no way
to sneak around that guard.

774
00:53:32,181 --> 00:53:35,350
- How'd you get that?
- I borrowed it.

775
00:53:36,602 --> 00:53:38,603
- Nice.
- Yeah.

776
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:47,028
- Morning.
- Hi there.

777
00:53:47,196 --> 00:53:49,155
Hey,
stop right there.

778
00:53:52,118 --> 00:53:54,035
Gonna need to see
that lD again, sir.

779
00:53:54,203 --> 00:53:56,913
Yeah, here you go.
Here you go.

780
00:54:13,973 --> 00:54:16,391
G-g-g-g-gun!

781
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,977
Get the gun!
Get the gun!

782
00:54:20,062 --> 00:54:22,063
- ( gunshots )
- Help, help!

783
00:54:26,777 --> 00:54:28,445
( screams )

784
00:54:34,702 --> 00:54:36,911
- ( gunshots )
- Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey.

785
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:40,081
- Ow!
- Back it up. Over there, over there.

786
00:54:40,249 --> 00:54:43,001
Sorry about that.
You okay?

787
00:54:43,169 --> 00:54:44,377
- Yeah.
- Over there, over there, over there.

788
00:54:44,545 --> 00:54:46,004
What do we do?
What do we do now?

789
00:54:46,172 --> 00:54:47,672
- Give me the gun.
- Okay, huh?

790
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,383
Just give me the gun.

791
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:53,261
Hey, hey, hey!
Back up!

792
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:56,055
Back up!

793
00:54:56,223 --> 00:54:58,475
Okay, there's rope in the car.

794
00:54:58,642 --> 00:55:00,643
Go get the rope.

795
00:55:01,729 --> 00:55:04,314
- Keys.
- The car is open!

796
00:55:14,158 --> 00:55:16,284
- Whoa! Get down!
- ( screams )

797
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,245
Get down,
get down!

798
00:55:22,917 --> 00:55:24,250
Wait, can you just--

799
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:30,173
Come on,
let's go!

800
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:38,640
- You okay?
- Yeah.

801
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:49,692
Okay, he's reloading.
Come on, come on, Iet's go.

802
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,861
Go, go, go!

803
00:55:58,118 --> 00:56:00,119
( metaI creaking )

804
00:56:01,205 --> 00:56:02,831
What?

805
00:56:11,507 --> 00:56:13,132
Brooke:
Oh, God.

806
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,593
We need to get out of here now.

807
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:21,140
- Brooke, come on!
- l'm coming!

808
00:56:23,227 --> 00:56:25,228
( Iow rumbIing )

809
00:56:28,274 --> 00:56:30,316
Let's go, go, go!

810
00:56:33,237 --> 00:56:35,113
Brooke:
I'm hurrying!

811
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:37,323
( tires screeching )

812
00:56:50,004 --> 00:56:51,337
Matthew: Whoa.

813
00:56:51,505 --> 00:56:54,132
So, uh, where do we start?

814
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,175
Hang on, these-- aren't fiIe cabinets

815
00:56:56,343 --> 00:56:58,094
supposed to have Ietters on them?

816
00:56:59,346 --> 00:57:03,099
Secret codes, secret fiIes,

817
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:05,184
they get bar codes.

818
00:57:06,437 --> 00:57:09,731
So how are we supposed to
find the one we're Iooking for?

819
00:57:11,901 --> 00:57:13,860
You take that side,
I'II take this side.

820
00:57:14,028 --> 00:57:16,070
- Okay, aII right.
- Just Iook for things

821
00:57:16,238 --> 00:57:19,449
that have structures, buiIdings,
things grouped together.

822
00:57:19,617 --> 00:57:21,618
- Stuff Iike that.
- Okay.

823
00:57:25,998 --> 00:57:27,832
- Matthew?
- Yes.

824
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,209
- You don't have to be neat.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, well.

825
00:57:30,377 --> 00:57:32,253
Fast.

826
00:57:32,421 --> 00:57:34,297
Just want to keep
some sembIance of organization.

827
00:57:34,465 --> 00:57:36,174
This took somebody
a Iong time.

828
00:57:36,342 --> 00:57:39,886
Computer: Warning, pIanetary gravity

829
00:57:40,054 --> 00:57:42,388
That's the pIan, girI.

Impact risk imminent.

834
00:58:15,631 --> 00:58:17,632
I think I got it.

835
00:58:31,855 --> 00:58:34,232
Down on the ground now!

836
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,986
Where's your buddy?

837
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:42,615
Oh, about time.

838
00:58:43,617 --> 00:58:45,618
Where's the fiIe?

839
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:50,248
Next time,
I'II tie him up.

840
00:58:50,416 --> 00:58:53,209
I'm sorry, they don't teach you how
to tie peopIe up in astronomy schooI.

841
00:58:53,377 --> 00:58:55,628
I stiII saved your butt.

842
00:59:03,762 --> 00:59:06,347
- Brooke?
- Brooke: Go ahead, James.

843
00:59:06,515 --> 00:59:08,099
I have the Iocation.

844
00:59:08,267 --> 00:59:10,018
Where shouId we meet you?

845
00:59:12,479 --> 00:59:14,188
Take Highway 37.

846
00:59:14,356 --> 00:59:17,275
We'II meet you
at the junction at Highway 12.

847
00:59:17,443 --> 00:59:20,445
- Brooke: Okay.
- Oh, and I picked this up for Iater.

848
00:59:20,612 --> 00:59:22,864
Figured we might need it.

849
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,494
- You want a hug?
- Yeah, yeah, I wouId.

850
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:34,208
l need those wave calculations.
We're approaching the Iaunch window.

851
00:59:34,376 --> 00:59:37,295
We're working on it.
We just got systems back up.

852
00:59:37,463 --> 00:59:41,132
- We're running out of time.
- l know the time table!

853
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,301
Sir.

854
00:59:45,763 --> 00:59:48,890
Look, Jen,

855
00:59:49,058 --> 00:59:50,308
get a team ready

856
00:59:50,476 --> 00:59:53,186
and take them
over to the faIIback faciIity.

857
00:59:53,353 --> 00:59:55,480
We gotta cover our bases.
If the systems go down here,

858
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:57,148
l'm not gonna
be abIe to Iaunch.

859
00:59:57,316 --> 00:59:59,942
I need you over there
to Iaunch from there.

860
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,862
I'II get you the Iaunch codes.

861
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:06,115
Michelle, please stay
on those waveIengths.

862
01:00:06,283 --> 01:00:07,658
MicheIIe: Yes, sir.

863
01:00:12,331 --> 01:00:14,791
Matthew: Whoa, stop. Stop the car.
He looks like he's alive.

864
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:18,169
- James: We don't have time for this.
- We can't just Ieave him here.

865
01:00:18,337 --> 01:00:20,630
- Matthew, get back in the car.
- We can't leave him here.

866
01:00:23,008 --> 01:00:26,302
- Matthew, get back in the car!
- ( man groaning )

867
01:00:27,805 --> 01:00:29,430
It'II be fine.

868
01:00:34,436 --> 01:00:36,104
- Oh, come on.
- Hey, buddy. You okay?

869
01:00:37,314 --> 01:00:39,899
We gotta get you--
we gotta get you--

870
01:00:41,026 --> 01:00:44,570
- Get up, nice and sIow.
- Hey.

871
01:00:46,115 --> 01:00:48,407
- Easy.
- Step away from the car!

872
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,993
- Step away from the car!
- Take it easy, man.

873
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:52,411
Just take it easy.
Don't do it, James!

874
01:00:52,579 --> 01:00:54,831
Shut up!
You think I'm kidding around?

875
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:56,207
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Huh?!

876
01:00:56,375 --> 01:00:57,917
- Easy, easy.
- Get the heII away from the car!

877
01:00:59,253 --> 01:01:00,670
- Buddy, I can't give you the keys.
- Shut up!

878
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:02,839
- I can't give you the keys!
- Don't be stupid, man!

879
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:05,466
- I'II cut his throat!
- I can't give you the car.

880
01:01:05,634 --> 01:01:07,635
Oh, you're gonna
give me the car.

881
01:01:08,804 --> 01:01:11,430
- Hey!
- What's this, huh?

882
01:01:11,598 --> 01:01:13,391
What are you doing?

883
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:15,434
What's this, huh?

884
01:01:15,602 --> 01:01:17,562
- Okay, okay, okay!
- The keys!

885
01:01:17,729 --> 01:01:19,522
- I'm gonna give you the keys.
- Yeah, you wiII.

886
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:20,606
- I'II give you the keys.
- Give me the keys.

887
01:01:20,774 --> 01:01:22,567
That's good.

888
01:01:26,363 --> 01:01:29,073
- Don't move.
- Dude.

889
01:01:40,711 --> 01:01:42,753
We need to caII the kids.

890
01:01:47,593 --> 01:01:49,844
The radio's in the car.

891
01:01:55,684 --> 01:01:57,727
It's happening again.

892
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,041

893
01:02:22,753 --> 01:02:24,629

Where's Matthew?

904
01:03:33,573 --> 01:03:35,741
- You get the part?
- Yeah, but we haven't heard anything

905
01:03:35,909 --> 01:03:37,201
from Victoria yet.

906
01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:39,370
Let's hope she's in the middIe
of the maneuver.

907
01:03:39,538 --> 01:03:41,622
We gotta get out of here.
Go!

908
01:03:47,254 --> 01:03:49,255

913
01:04:18,994 --> 01:04:21,370

We'II never get through here.

919
01:05:20,472 --> 01:05:23,182
We gotta back up.

920
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:25,726
We gotta find another way.

921
01:05:30,857 --> 01:05:34,193
- All right.
- ( engine chokes )

922
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:37,154
- Damn it.
- You're kidding me.

923
01:05:40,617 --> 01:05:42,827
Okay, we are go for Iaunch.

924

01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:13,107
AIternator's shot.

928
01:06:13,275 --> 01:06:14,775
What are we gonna do?

929
01:06:14,943 --> 01:06:17,611
How are we supposed to
get around this thing?

930
01:06:17,779 --> 01:06:19,613
Guess we have to waIk.

931
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:32,710
- What are you doing?
- What?

932
01:06:32,878 --> 01:06:35,004
I've aIready been shot at
once today.

933
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,759
( rumbIing )

934
01:07:04,993 --> 01:07:06,660
This thing goes on
for miIes.

935
01:07:06,828 --> 01:07:08,287
Yeah, James.

936
01:07:08,455 --> 01:07:10,956
At this rate, I don't think
we're gonna make it on time.

937
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,630
Magnetism is increasing.

938
01:07:17,797 --> 01:07:21,509
Mercury is forcing
the missiIes off course.

939
01:07:34,231 --> 01:07:37,233
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
lt's leaking gas.

940
01:07:38,902 --> 01:07:40,736

942
01:07:57,212 --> 01:07:58,712
No.

943
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:05,844
James?
James, can you hear me?

944
01:08:06,012 --> 01:08:08,639
- James.
- Victoria: James?

945
01:08:08,807 --> 01:08:11,267
( static hissing )

946
01:08:11,434 --> 01:08:12,810
- Okay, go.
- Hey, Vic.

947
01:08:12,978 --> 01:08:16,647
- It's me.
- Thank God.

948
01:08:16,815 --> 01:08:18,899
- Are you safe?
- I am,

949
01:08:19,067 --> 01:08:20,985
and l'm heading away
from Mercury as fast as I can.

950
01:08:21,152 --> 01:08:24,947
Have you Iaunched P-7 yet?

951
01:08:27,075 --> 01:08:29,910
We can't.

952
01:08:30,078 --> 01:08:32,371
Guidance system's
been damaged.

953
01:08:33,832 --> 01:08:35,916
Hey, honey?
I, uh--

954
01:08:36,084 --> 01:08:39,837
I need you
to do something.

955
01:08:40,005 --> 01:08:43,757
I don't want to ask you
to do this,

956
01:08:43,925 --> 01:08:47,636
but I need you to take
the NautiIus to Project 7

957
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:51,932
and you have to guide it
to Mercury.

958
01:08:54,269 --> 01:08:57,229
I guess I won't be going home
as fast as l thought.

959
01:08:57,397 --> 01:08:59,940
It's the onIy chance
we have, honey.

960
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:04,028
I'II do it.

961
01:09:04,195 --> 01:09:06,030
Now Iisten to me.

962
01:09:06,197 --> 01:09:09,992
You have to tether in
the NautiIus guidance system to P-7's.

963
01:09:11,202 --> 01:09:13,037
I understand, James.

964
01:09:13,204 --> 01:09:16,123
Now we stiII have to
do the fixes to P-7.

965
01:09:16,291 --> 01:09:19,126
We have to do that
at the faciIity.

966
01:09:20,378 --> 01:09:22,421
There's really
not that much time.

967
01:09:23,923 --> 01:09:26,467
I'II get there in time.

968
01:09:26,635 --> 01:09:29,303

( banging )

1018
01:14:36,444 --> 01:14:39,571
- Everybody all right?
- Better than the car, I guess.

1019
01:14:41,282 --> 01:14:43,867
Brooke?
Brooke?

1020
01:14:45,411 --> 01:14:47,454

James,
she's not breathing, man.

1024
01:15:04,514 --> 01:15:06,431
I'm sorry.

1025
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:08,684

Brooke, I'm so sorry.

1028
01:15:19,237 --> 01:15:22,447
Christopher, we gotta go.

1029
01:15:22,615 --> 01:15:25,283
No.

1030
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:27,536
- Christopher.
- Just wait!

1031
01:15:27,704 --> 01:15:29,705
Brooke.

1032
01:15:34,252 --> 01:15:41,591
I'm sorry.

1033
01:15:54,188 --> 01:15:56,189
Wow.

1034
01:16:00,069 --> 01:16:01,570
SPEAR car.

1035
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:08,326
It's Jennifer.

1036
01:16:23,509 --> 01:16:26,178
We're close.
We gotta get out of here.

1037
01:16:33,436 --> 01:16:35,395
Executing Ianding procedure.

1038
01:16:35,563 --> 01:16:38,315
Prepare to tether
NautiIus' navigation system

1039
01:16:38,483 --> 01:16:41,401

1044
01:17:08,262 --> 01:17:10,430
System tether executed.

1045
01:17:13,059 --> 01:17:15,060
James, can you hear me?

1046
01:17:16,312 --> 01:17:18,438
I don't see a faciIity. Are you sure
we got the right coordinates?

1047
01:17:18,606 --> 01:17:21,525
Yeah, we're here.
The dam is camoufIage.

1048
01:17:22,527 --> 01:17:24,736
It's aIso the power source
for the faciIity.

1049
01:17:24,904 --> 01:17:26,905
Wow.

1050
01:17:32,286 --> 01:17:35,539

- Okay.

1051
01:17:35,706 --> 01:17:37,499

- Here.

1052
01:17:37,667 --> 01:17:39,543
- Vic, are you aII right?
- Yes,

1053
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:41,378
and I'm tethered
to Project 7's systems.

1054
01:17:41,546 --> 01:17:43,505
As soon as I get the updates,
l'm ready to launch.

1055
01:17:43,673 --> 01:17:45,924
You have to check
the targeting systems.

1056
01:17:46,092 --> 01:17:49,594
It'II automaticaIIy be scanning
an impact threat the size of Mercury.

1057
01:17:49,762 --> 01:17:53,098
Oh, no.

1058
01:17:53,266 --> 01:17:56,476
- What's the Iaunch window?
- If I don't get Project 7 moving,

1059
01:17:56,644 --> 01:17:59,020
l'll never close
the gap to Mercury.

1060
01:17:59,188 --> 01:18:01,606
Without the updates,
the shieId won't work.

1061
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:05,819
- Then you better hurry.
- We gotta go.

1062
01:18:12,785 --> 01:18:14,786
Engaging main engines.

1063
01:18:24,881 --> 01:18:26,673

1066
01:18:42,315 --> 01:18:44,065
We gotta move!

1067
01:18:50,698 --> 01:18:52,699
We're aImost there.

- Whoa!

1073
01:19:22,605 --> 01:19:25,148
- Where's the control room?
- It's directIy underneath the dam.

1074
01:19:25,316 --> 01:19:27,484
It's the onIy pIace
safe enough.

1075
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:31,613
Increase engines
to maximum.

1076
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:42,958
What are we Iooking for?

1077
01:19:45,294 --> 01:19:46,461
There it is!

Come on, James.

1086
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:38,638
What can l do?
What do you need?

1087
01:20:38,806 --> 01:20:40,598
l'm gonna get
the system up and running.

1088
01:20:40,766 --> 01:20:43,184

- Right.

1089
01:20:50,151 --> 01:20:51,735

Good boy.

1093
01:21:04,165 --> 01:21:06,666
Vic, it's updating right now.

1094
01:21:06,834 --> 01:21:08,877
James, it's too Iate.

1095

Hey, don't give up on me!

1096

Hang in there, okay?

1097
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:25,602
We need to go!

1098
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:28,521

1099
01:21:28,689 --> 01:21:30,690
Go, go!

1100
01:21:32,068 --> 01:21:33,735
Victoria:

1101
01:21:33,903 --> 01:21:36,446
I Iove you.

1102
01:21:36,614 --> 01:21:39,366

1122
01:23:57,963 --> 01:24:00,215
About everything.

1123
01:24:07,014 --> 01:24:08,806
Victoria knew
what she was doing.

1124
01:24:12,937 --> 01:24:15,230
lf it wasn't for her,
we wouIdn't be here, right?

1125
01:24:16,941 --> 01:24:19,108
None of us wouId.

1126
01:24:22,196 --> 01:24:23,571
Try her.

James, do you read?

1135
01:25:27,136 --> 01:25:29,512
- You made it.
- ( laughs )

1136
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,848
Looks Iike the worId did, too.

1137
01:25:40,691 --> 01:25:42,317
Why don't you come on down

1138

Victoria:
I'm aIready on my way.

1140
01:25:54,204 --> 01:25:56,289
And for the record,
