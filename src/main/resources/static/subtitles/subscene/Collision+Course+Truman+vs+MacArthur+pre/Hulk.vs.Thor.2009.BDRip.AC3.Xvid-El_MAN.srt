1
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:26,113
<i>Outside of the world you know,
there exists the realm eternal...</i>

2
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:28,521
<i>...Asgard.</i>

3
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:31,978
<i>The shining light of the Nine Worlds.</i>

4
00:01:32,972 --> 00:01:36,402
<i>Asgard is home to the gods.</i>

5
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:43,306
<i>All of whom bow down
before the all father...</i>

6
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:46,203
<i>...Odin.</i>

7
00:01:47,622 --> 00:01:53,622
<i>Odin's life blood flows through Asgard,
and Asgard is Odin.</i>

8
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:59,588
<i>His power is all and he keeps
the Asgardian realm safe.</i>

9
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:04,562
<i>But once each winter
the all father must rest...</i>

10
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:07,889
<i>...and enter the Odin sleep.</i>

11
00:02:09,223 --> 00:02:14,251
<i>While Odin slumbers, his absence
leaves Asgard vulnerable.</i>

12
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,583
<i>And this is when the wicked
descend upon his kingdom.</i>

13
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:44,266
<i>For seven days
an onslaught of trolls,...</i>

14
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:47,555
<i>...giants, dark elves and demons...</i>

15
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,945
<i>...seek to take control
of the Nine Worlds.</i>

16
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:56,434
<i>But they are
eternally defeated by him!</i>

17
00:02:58,184 --> 00:03:03,758
<i>My arrogant, oafish,
brute of a step brother...</i>

18
00:03:04,429 --> 00:03:05,929
<i>...Thor.</i>

19
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:16,028
I don't understand.

20
00:03:17,827 --> 00:03:19,882
Where... Where am I?

21
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:32,051
Hear me, human.

22
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:36,466
You have been brought to Asgard,
because in all the universe...

23
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:43,058
...only you have ever brought
near defeat to the mighty Thor.

24
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:48,704
What?
I... I couldn't.

25
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:54,760
Not thee, Bruce Banner.
You are but a snivelling, sad creature.

26
00:03:55,323 --> 00:04:00,396
I speak of your other half.
I speak of the Hulk.

27
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:07,387
There is one day left of the Odin sleep.
The cycle is nearly complete.

28
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:15,870
As always the Asgardians will emerge
victorious against the siege of darkness.

29
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:19,544
My brother will seek peace,
and then...

30
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:23,964
Then I shall destroy him.

31
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:43,617
Verily thee must say that was
far better than the last winter.

32
00:04:44,086 --> 00:04:48,087
Tell us, Volstagg, are you going to
dispatch that troll beneath you...

33
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:50,323
...or you saving him for dinner?

34
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:56,238
That all depends on how much
mead I partake in.

35
00:04:56,273 --> 00:05:00,890
Did my ears deceive me?
Did Hogun the Grim make a joke?

36
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:03,389
And here we thought
you are still in a foul mood...

37
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,637
...because you didn't
get to slay a frost giant.

38
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:09,352
I've still slain more than thee, Fandral.

39
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:12,646
Well we shall see
whom the maidens reward more.

40
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:28,627
In mere hours the all father will awaken
and then we may rejoice.

41
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:38,921
Your Lady Sif,
would know what vexes thee.

42
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,463
Aye, we won the day.
All is well in the realm of Asgard.

43
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:51,386
- But only until the next Odin sleep.
- It is, as it has always been.

44
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:54,927
We must learn to savour
the moments of peace.

45
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,086
And accept the cycle of death?

46
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,295
How many of our brothers and sisters
have fallen to this madness?

47
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,337
Must we be chained
to this eternal struggle?

48
00:06:04,372 --> 00:06:06,810
Be careful what you wish for my love.

49
00:06:07,198 --> 00:06:11,095
When the cycle does break,
when things do change...

50
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,620
...then comes the end of days.
Then comes Ragnarok.

51
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:20,526
Perhaps our fates are not ours to choose.

52
00:06:21,787 --> 00:06:25,273
Thee come, let us return to
my fathers palace...

53
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:27,042
...and prepare for his awakening.

54
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,859
Please, I'm begging you.
Don't do this.

55
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:40,214
I've fought all my life
to keep the Hulk inside.

56
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,999
You don't know
the destruction he can cause.

57
00:06:46,245 --> 00:06:52,077
Don't know? You fool.
I'm counting on it.

58
00:06:52,783 --> 00:06:55,999
Look at you, so weak.

59
00:06:56,034 --> 00:07:00,813
Where it not for you inside the Hulk's mind,
suppressing his power...

60
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:03,950
...he would rule Midgard
with his rage.

61
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:07,593
I won't let him out.
I won't let you do this.

62
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,874
You won't let me?

63
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:13,130
How amusing you mortals are.

64
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:16,237
Now let me see if I recall correctly.

65
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:20,310
It is anger that unleashes the beast?

66
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:34,034
I seem to have forgotten
the frailty of mortals.

67
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:38,313
Look Amora, I do believe
he's going to weep.

68
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:05,329
No, that is impossible.

69
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:21,127
Now.

70
00:09:51,212 --> 00:09:55,423
And so begins the end of Thor.

71
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:10,460
Oh, yeah. What do you think, thee Balder?
One last troll with dreams of conquest?

72
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:13,802
Perhaps.

73
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:22,488
Come Hogun, Fandral.

74
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:27,128
Let us given to this scoundrel
the gift of battle.

75
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:09,276
The creature's power is incredible.

76
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:13,223
Take care Loki.
My spell bonds you to the creature...

77
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:17,581
...and while you are master to it
I can feel him fighting you.

78
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:21,799
You have to listen to me.
It can't be controlled.

79
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:27,037
Do not try my patience worm.
Lest I turn my attentions to thee.

80
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:26,450
You are no troll, monster.

81
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:45,589
It is Balder's horn.
But this is not right.

82
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:50,224
- Asgard's enemies are all defeated.
- And yet the alarm has sounded.

83
00:12:51,452 --> 00:12:52,952
Stay at Odin's side.

84
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:56,923
Should I fail to meet this threat,
you must protect him.

85
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:09,853
But if Thor should fall,
what hope has Asgard?

86
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:23,057
You will have to kill me monster...

87
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,628
...for I shall not yield.

88
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:59,376
Thor, the creature like nothing
I've ever seen.

89
00:13:59,461 --> 00:14:04,801
Aye, my friend.
This is no immortal evil that we face now.

90
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:07,819
The Hulk has come to Asgard.

91
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:24,135
Dr. Banner, can you hear me
inside the beast?

92
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:30,459
Why have you come here?

93
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,564
Why to kill you of course,
dear step brother.

94
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:35,635
Loki?

95
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:44,861
I have waited an eternity for this.

96
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,300
To crush you with my bare hands.

97
00:14:48,357 --> 00:14:50,771
To match your might.

98
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:54,265
To feel your life fade away...

99
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:57,653
...as my hands
wrap around your throat.

100
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:08,443
Never!

101
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,735
Come to your new master, Mjolnir...

102
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,308
...and let us smite my step brother.

103
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,986
For there are none stronger than Loki now.

104
00:16:29,244 --> 00:16:32,244
Rise cursed hammer!

105
00:16:32,427 --> 00:16:35,841
Loki enough.
Your own rage fuels the beast.

106
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:37,962
I can feel the spell breaking.

107
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:43,797
I will have this hammer!

108
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,059
Neh, you will have it's thunder!

109
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:17,221
For Odin!
For Asgard!

110
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:37,629
The monster, it is raging carnage.
It has shattered the spell.

111
00:17:39,953 --> 00:17:42,953
The Hulk is free.

112
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,586
Will thou yield, Loki?

113
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:20,099
Truly this is the best of both worlds.

114
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:24,262
I need not control the beast
to enjoy it's wrath.

115
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:26,579
Goodbye, brother.

116
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:29,992
This...
This is not what I wanted.

117
00:18:32,597 --> 00:18:35,283
There's no going back Amora.

118
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:39,720
After all, if not for your
black broken heart...

119
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:41,933
...none of this
would have been possible.

120
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:48,555
You don't know what you've done.

121
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:53,140
With no one to bring the Hulk in,
he'll tear down your entire world.

122
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:59,860
I find your prattling useless mortal,
just as you are now useless to me.

123
00:19:56,508 --> 00:20:00,956
For Odin!
For Asgard!

124
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:19,735
Thor, my love.

125
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:25,628
I... I was angered when you chose
Sif over me, I did not...

126
00:21:26,091 --> 00:21:29,525
I wanted thou love, not your death.

127
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:34,200
Please.
Please come back to me.

128
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:47,069
- Amora?
- Yes my love?

129
00:21:56,836 --> 00:22:01,390
Where is Loki?

130
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:46,841
What is that monster doing?
He travels towards Odin.

131
00:22:55,632 --> 00:22:59,589
Loki, I would have words with thee.

132
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:03,946
No, you were at Hela's door,
I defeated you.

133
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:13,196
You! You dare cross the god of...

134
00:23:31,604 --> 00:23:36,144
The Hulk will be send back to Midgard
and then you will answer to Odin.

135
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,952
Fine, take the creature.
It provided me with amusement enough.

136
00:23:40,243 --> 00:23:42,729
Seeing it pummel you nion to death.

137
00:23:42,764 --> 00:23:46,395
Loki, you fool.
You killed him.

138
00:23:46,556 --> 00:23:48,156
Do you know what you've done?

139
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:53,186
Because the mortal died here,
Hela claimed his soul.

140
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:56,213
Without his soul, I cannot
return him to Midgard.

141
00:23:56,367 --> 00:24:01,345
Without Bruce Banner,
the Hulk cannot leave Asgard.

142
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:39,218
Valkeries, warriors!
Your seats in Valhalla are promised.

143
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,809
Protect Odin with your lives!

144
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,099
For Asgard!

145
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:53,918
I saw the beast's eyes brother.

146
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:59,905
It will not stop until all of Asgard
is destroyed, until Odin is broken.

147
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:02,975
You have brought a new Ragnarok
down upon us all.

148
00:25:04,324 --> 00:25:08,085
It's possible I made
a poor choice.

149
00:25:12,508 --> 00:25:17,059
Amora, I need you by Odin's side.
Protect him along with Lady Sif.

150
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,740
As you wish.

151
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:31,449
Loki, you will send whatever dark forces
you have left to battle the Hulk.

152
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:36,025
Then you and I,
we go out to help destiny.

153
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:53,970
Rest your weapons, shield men.

154
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:58,917
I've come to aid thee in Odin's defence,
at Thor's request.

155
00:25:58,952 --> 00:26:03,778
His request you say?
More likely his penance, witch.

156
00:26:04,013 --> 00:26:07,033
No doubt he saw your hand
in this attack.

157
00:26:08,591 --> 00:26:12,399
A punishment more cruel
than you can imagine, cow.

158
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,544
Loki, the god of mischief
bids you death mortal creature.

159
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,600
Long have I wished
never to see this realm.

160
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:11,205
I always forget what a busy time
the Odin sleep is for my daughter.

161
00:27:11,855 --> 00:27:14,455
Does thou see any newly arrived
friends here, brother?

162
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:17,613
Have a care, Loki,
lest thee stay here.

163
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:31,651
Where am I?

164
00:27:55,248 --> 00:27:58,748
No, this doesn't make any sense.

165
00:28:01,682 --> 00:28:04,682
Bruce?
Are you okay?

166
00:28:05,298 --> 00:28:06,498
Betty?

167
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,440
I... I thought...
I don't understand.

168
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,780
- I was alone, and then...
- You're not alone Bruce.

169
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,480
Not any more.

170
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:23,572
Daddy!

171
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:29,871
Come play with me.

172
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,460
Hail, Hela, goddess of the dead.

173
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,400
We seek an audience.

174
00:28:57,341 --> 00:29:02,082
The sons of Odin
risk much entering my realm.

175
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:06,125
The Nine Worlds of Asgard
are in great peril, mistress...

176
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,245
...including Hell and Niflheim.

177
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,760
A new Ragnarok is upon us
and we need your help.

178
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,060
We need Bruce Banner.

179
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,860
The mortal's soul is mine, Asgardian.

180
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:27,293
As yours nearly was this very day.

181
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:29,586
And may well be again.

182
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:32,483
You would risk everything
for the sake of one soul?

183
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:35,796
Just as you would, Odin's son.

184
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:41,954
But you do not have one soul daughter.
You have half a soul.

185
00:29:42,203 --> 00:29:43,712
You have Bruce Banner.

186
00:29:43,812 --> 00:29:47,019
You need the Hulk
to complete your prize.

187
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,960
Are you alright?

188
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:37,253
I feel...
I feel great.

189
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:43,531
I can't imagine anything better.

190
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:49,047
<i>Bruce Banner.</i>

191
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:06,155
<i>Awake from this dream.</i>

192
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:12,456
Betty?

193
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,815
Betty? Where are you?

194
00:31:19,431 --> 00:31:22,956
The world of the living has need of you.

195
00:31:27,074 --> 00:31:29,574
Who are you?
What do you want with me?

196
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:32,530
Not I, he.

197
00:31:32,565 --> 00:31:36,500
Friend Banner,
for the sake of all of Asgard...

198
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:38,909
...you must become the Hulk once more.

199
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:45,248
Betty? What?
Where? Where is...

200
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:48,849
No.

201
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,470
No!

202
00:32:41,981 --> 00:32:45,472
No. No, you can't ask me to do that.

203
00:32:46,662 --> 00:32:48,662
I finally had peace.

204
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:51,676
You don't know what your asking.

205
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:56,081
Your time in Hell certainly has not
made you less of a worm, mortal.

206
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:32,096
Bruce Banner, I know
thee to be a man of honour.

207
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:34,325
I know thee to be a hero.

208
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:37,974
The lives at stake are not
your concern, not even human.

209
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:43,063
But I ask you anyway,
be that hero now.

210
00:33:47,178 --> 00:33:50,425
No, I can't.

211
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,460
Die beast!

212
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,764
The Hulk's soul
is rightfully yours, daughter.

213
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:08,789
Take it, bring the Hulk to hell.

214
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:12,870
Merge the two halves
of his soul and claim him.

215
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:35,441
I will not force you to forsake
the rewards of the after life...

216
00:34:35,626 --> 00:34:40,278
...but you must be whole.
- No, I won't.

217
00:34:40,988 --> 00:34:42,749
You don't understand.

218
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:55,742
No!

219
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:45,427
Curse you Loki, for convincing me
to bring this creature to my realm.

220
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:49,081
Stay thy hand Hela.
We shall retrieve the Hulk.

221
00:35:49,116 --> 00:35:53,264
We? The Hulk's fists have addled
your mind thunderer?

222
00:35:53,299 --> 00:35:56,945
Fight with me brother, or die alone.

223
00:35:57,395 --> 00:36:00,595
Not much of a threat,
considering we're already in hell.

224
00:36:03,784 --> 00:36:05,284
Have that thee!

225
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:03,166
My apologies.
I was enjoying the performance.

226
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,623
Let them go.
I'm the one you want.

227
00:37:40,276 --> 00:37:41,476
Come on.

228
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:04,408
Hulk tired.

229
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,884
You called him weak, Loki.

230
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:21,204
But there is more strength and courage
in that man than you will ever know.

231
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:24,516
This soul is too dangerous
to keep in Hell...

232
00:38:24,651 --> 00:38:27,602
...and to valuable to lose to Valhalla.

233
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:31,787
I will return him to Midgard.

234
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:41,303
Enough of this ridiculousness.

235
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:45,016
To think that Loki,
prince of darkness,...

236
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,189
...should waste his time
with defending Asgard.

237
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:54,495
Nay brother, we leave together.
For you still have much to answer for.

238
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:58,023
Indeed you both do.

239
00:38:58,058 --> 00:39:01,042
For today Hela has relinquished a soul...

240
00:39:01,142 --> 00:39:04,338
...and she demands one in exchange.

241
00:39:04,439 --> 00:39:08,939
You may try to take my soul death Goddess,
but I will make you fight for it.

242
00:39:09,118 --> 00:39:12,347
And your realm has suffered
much already this day.

243
00:39:15,497 --> 00:39:21,022
You speak the truth.
So I shall take his soul instead.

244
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:22,023
What?

245
00:39:26,361 --> 00:39:27,361
Thor!

246
00:39:27,472 --> 00:39:31,529
Thor, I've helped you. I...

247
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,650
- I could fight you for Loki's soul.
- Will you?

248
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:41,167
No.

249
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:45,430
He is my father.
His stay will not be eternal.

250
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:51,202
But know this Odin's son,
your soul will be mine.

251
00:39:51,324 --> 00:39:53,578
And I will keep it forever.

252
00:39:54,403 --> 00:39:57,448
Your fate is inescapable.

253
00:39:58,085 --> 00:39:59,785
We shall see.

254
00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:39,786
Thus the cycle begins anew.

255
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:45,868
Asgard is safe once again,
defended to the end by it's heroes.

256
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:49,129
I am proud of each of you
that stand before me.

257
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,835
The day was saved by loyalty and sacrifice.

258
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:56,257
We honour those who fought beside us.

259
00:40:57,296 --> 00:40:59,934
Those who are know longer with us.

260
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:04,588
And we defy those
who would see us brought to ruin.

261
00:41:06,379 --> 00:41:11,168
And while the rewards of Valhalla
await all of Asgard's heroes,...

262
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:14,139
...this day we honour a hero of Midgard.

263
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:19,794
A mortal who sacrificed everything
for a land not his own.

264
00:41:22,342 --> 00:41:26,842
This day a human showed the gods
what legends are made of.

265
00:41:27,229 --> 00:41:30,629
Hail the mortal, Bruce Banner.
