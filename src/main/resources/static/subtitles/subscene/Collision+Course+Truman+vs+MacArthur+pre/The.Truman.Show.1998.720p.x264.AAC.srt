00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,300
We've become bored
With watching actors

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,900
Give us phony emotions.

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,000
We're tired
Of pyrotechnics

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,100
And special effects.

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,300
While the world
He inhabits...

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,300
Is, in some respects,
Counterfeit,

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,900
There's nothing fake
About truman himself--

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,300
No scripts,

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,600
  No cue cards.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,800
It isn't always shakespeare,
But it's genuine.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,800
It's a life.

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,600
I'm not going to make it.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,700
You're going to have
To go on without me.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,500
No way, mister.

15
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,300
You're going to the top
Of this mountain,

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,000
Broken legs and all.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,900
We find many viewers
Leave him on

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,700
All night for comfort.

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,200
You're crazy,
You know that?

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,300
Well, for me,
There is no difference

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,400
Between a private life
And a public life.

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,700
  My life...is my life,
Is  the truman show.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,000
  The truman show
Is...   A lifestyle.

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,600
It's a noble life.

25
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,100
It is...

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,100
A truly blessed life.

27
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,500
  Yeah, tell me something
I  don't   know.

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,400
All right. Promise me
One thing, though.

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,400
If i die before i reach
The summit,

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,600
You'll use me as
An alternative source of food.

31
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,700
Ew. Gross.

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,600
It's all true.
It's all real.

33
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,300
Nothing here is fake.

34
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,400
Nothing you see
On this show is fake.

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,100
It's merely controlled.

36
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,500
Eat me, damn it.

37
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,000
That's an order.

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,900
Maybe just
Your love handles.

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,100
I have love handles?

40
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
Yeah.

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,300

To be late.

Out of my job,

187
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
  Out of seahaven.

188
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,900
Off this island. Out.

189
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,500
Out of your job?

190
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,000
What the hell's wrong
With your job?

191
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
You have a great job,
Truman.

192
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,000
You have a desk job.

193
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,800
I'd kill for a desk job.

194
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,600
Here you go.

195
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,100
You should try stocking
Vending machines for a living.

196
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,900
No, thanks.

197
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
Now, there's excitement.

198
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,300
[both laugh]

199
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,800
Don't you ever
Get antsy?

200
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,400
Itchy feet?

201
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,600
Where's there to go?

202
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,200
Fiji.

203
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,800
[laughs]

204
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,200
Where the hell's fiji?

205
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,800
Near florida?

206
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,600
Hmm.

207
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,900
See here?

208
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,800
Yeah.

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,400
This is us...

210
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,600
And all the way
Around here...

211
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,300
Fiji.

212
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,900
You can't get
Any further away

213
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,400
Before you start
Coming back.

214
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,100
You know, there are
Still islands in fiji

215
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,600
Where no human being
Has ever set foot.

216
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,100
Whoo.

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,700
So, when are you
Going to go?

218
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,400
It's not that simple.

219
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,200
  It takes...

220
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,700
Money,

221
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,000
Planning.

222
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,700
I can't just up and go.

223
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,900
Right.

224
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm going to do it.

225
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Don't worry about that.

226
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,300
Bonus time is just
Around the corner.

227
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,300
Hmm.

228
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,800
Hey, you coming
For a drink?

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,500
No. I can't tonight.

230
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,600
I don't like the look
Of that weather, son.

231
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
I think we should
Head back.

232
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,100
Oh, no, dad.
Not yet.

233
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,400
No, come on.
We should go back.

234
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,400
A bit farther.
Listen--

235
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,500
Please?

236
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,000
Ok.

237
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,500
Yes.

238
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,900
[thunder]

239
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,300
Daddy!

240
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,900
[thunder]

241
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,400
Ohh!

242
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,800
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
 Oh 

244
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,800
[thunder]

245
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,600
You're soaked.
Where have you been?

246
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,000
I figure if we can
Scrape together 8,000--

247
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,600
Every time you and marlon
Get together--

248
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,000
We can bum around the world
For a year on that.

249
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,000
And then what, truman?

250
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,400
We'd be where we were
5 years ago.

251
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,400
You're talking
Like a teenager.

252
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,300
Well, maybe i feel
Like a teenager.

253
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,400
We have mortgage payments,
Truman.

254
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,000
We have car payments.

255
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
What, we're just going
To walk away

256
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,600
From our financial
Obligations?

257
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,700
It would be
An adventure.

258
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,900
I thought we were going
To try for a baby.

259
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,700
Isn't that enough
Of an adventure?

260
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,500
That can wait.

261
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,000
I want to get away--

262
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,600
See some of the world,

263
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,500
Explore.

264
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,500
Honey, you want to be
An explorer?

265
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,400
This'll pass.

266
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,500
We all think like this
Now and then.

267
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,300
Let's get you out of
These wet clothes, hmm?

268
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,100
Come to bed.

269
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,200
You never
See anything anyway.

270
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,300
They always...

271
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,300
Turn the camera
And play music and...

272
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,900
You know,
The wind blows in,

273
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,700
And the curtains move,

274
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,600
And you don't
See anything.

275
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,400
  Dog fancy,  please.

276
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,100
  Dog fancy.

277
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you.

278
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,500
[dog barks]

279
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
Paper, earl, please.

280
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,500
Paper.

281
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,400
Oh...

282
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
I might as well
Pick one of these up.

283
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,600
For the wife?

284
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,500
She's got to have them.

285
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,400
Anything else, truman?

286
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,300
That's the whole
Ball of wax.

287
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
Catch you later.

288
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,900
Ok.

289
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,200
Dad?

290
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,200
Ohh!

291
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,600
Hey, what are you
Doing?

292
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,200
Hey! What the--

293
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,700
Get out of the way!

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Stop them!

295
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,400
Ohh!

296
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,700
Stop those people!

297
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,300
  Stop! Stop!

298
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,900
Hey! Open the doors!

299
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Somebody
Stop the bus!

300
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,200
  Stop the bus!

301
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,900
Somebody stop it!

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,900
Somebody stop the bus!

303
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,600
Stop the bus!

304
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,100
Aah!

305
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,700
It doesn't sound insane
At all, truman.

306
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,100
I see him 10 times a week

307
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,600
In a hundred
Different faces.

308
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,600
I almost hugged
A perfect stranger

309
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,200
In the salon
Last thursday.

310
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,700
It was dad.

311
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,800
I swear. Dressed like
A homeless man.

312
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
And you know what else
Was strange?

313
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,700
A businessman and a woman
With a little dog

314
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,800
Came out of nowhere

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,500
And forced him
Onto a bus.

316
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,600
Well, it's about time

317
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,900
They cleaned up
The trash downtown

318
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,800
Before we become just like
The rest of the country.

319
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,800
They never found
Dad's body.

320
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,300
Maybe somehow--
Oh, god.

321
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,300
I'm telling you,
If it wasn't him,

322
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,900
It was his twin.

323
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,200
Did dad have
A brother?

324
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,100
Truman, you know
Perfectly well

325
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,700
That your father
Was an only child,

326
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,200
Just like you.

327
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,000
Now, sweetie...

328
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,200
You're just feeling bad
Because of what happened--

329
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,500
You sailing off
Into that storm.

330
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,000
But i've never
Blamed you, truman...

331
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,600
And i don't blame you now.

332
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,400
[door opens]

333
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,200
Meryl: truman?

334
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,900
[objects clatter]

335
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,700
What are you doing
Down here?

336
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
Fixing the mower.

337
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,200
[objects clatter]

338
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,200
[blows]

339
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,800
Saw my father
Today.

340
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,300
I know.

341
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,000
Your mother called.

342
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,300
You really shouldn't
Upset her like that.

343
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,300
Did you want--
What did you want?

344
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
I made macaroni.

345
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,600
I'm not hungry.

346
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,200
You know...

347
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,700
You really ought
To throw out that mower.

348
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,700
Get one of those new
Elk rotaries.

349
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,400
[meryl leaves]

350
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,200
[footsteps upstairs]

351
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,200
What's he doing?

352
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,300
See, they
Got rid of her,

353
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,000
But they couldn't erase
The memory.

354
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,300
The memory of who?

355
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,700
Shh.

356
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Man: hey, hey.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

358
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,100

[marlon playing trumpet]

361
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,800
Oh! Ow!

362
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
  Whoa.
Ow!

363
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Excuse me.

364
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,200
Hi.

365
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:15,600
Hi.

366
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,500
I'm so sorry
I fell on you like that.

367
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,000
It's ok.

368
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,800
I'm just--i've been
Such a klutz all day.

369
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,300
It's all right.

370
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,000
Sprained this ankle.
Oh, my goodness.

371
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,300

Yeah. Well,
I can understand that.

437
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I'm a pretty dangerous
Character.

438
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,800
I'm sorry.
It's not up to me.

439

A girl's
Got to be careful.

00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,600
You have a boyfriend,
Right?

441
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,700
No, it's not that.

442
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,300
Was it meryl, that girl
That was with me?

443
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,200
We're not--we don't--

444
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
  We're not--we're just--
We're friends.

445
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,200
It's nothing like that.

446
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,800
It's how i look?

447
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,400
Not your type?

448
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,900
No.

449
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,200
I like your pin.

450
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,500
I was wondering that
Myself.

451
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,300
Mmm.

452
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,600
Would you want to...

453
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,200
Maybe possibly...

454
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,300
Sometime go out for
Some pizza or something?

455
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,500
Like, friday?

456
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,800

I can't.

457
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,600
Sunday, monday,

Yeah, i know.

460
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,200
If we don't go now,
It won't happen.

461
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Do you understand?

462
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,300
So, what do you want to do?

463
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,000

465
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,700
Whoo-hoo!

466
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,600
Please keep your hands
Inside the car!

467
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,600
This is my favorite
Pizza place.

We have so little time.

471

They're going to be here
Any minute.

472
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,300
Who are?

473
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,100
They don't want me
Talking to you.

474
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,700
Then don't talk.

475
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,800
[car approaching]

476
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,300
They're here.

477
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,000
Truman.

478
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,700
What do they want?

479
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,700
Listen to me.
Everybody knows about you.

480
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,900
  Everybody knows
Everything you do.

481
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,600
They're pretending, truman.
Do you understand?

482
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,600
Everybody's pretending.

483
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,600
Lauren,
I don't know--

484
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,500
No, my name's not lauren.

Hey, wait a minute.
Who are you?

489
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm her father!

490
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,500
What?

491
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,900
I've never even
Seen him before.

492
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,700
Honey, please.

493
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,500
He's lying. Truman, please,
Don't listen to him.

494
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,100
Everything i've told you
Is the truth.

495
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,700
This, it's fake.
It's all for you.

496
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,400
I don't understand.

497
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
The sky and the sea,
Everything--it's a set.

498
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,100
It's a show.

499
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,300
Everybody's watching you.
Please don't listen to him.

500
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,900
He's gonna lie to you.
They're watching us now.

501
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,800
What's going on?

502
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,600
Schizophrenia.
She has episodes.

503
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,500
Please. Oh, no!

504
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,100
Father: we've tried
Everything.

[honking horn]

506
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,700
Hypnotism,
Shock therapy.

507
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,000
Don't worry.
You're not the first.

508
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,300
Sylvia: truman!

509
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,800
She brings all her
Boyfriends down here.

510
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
Sylvia: what's he saying?
Truman, he's lying!

511
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,400
Get out of here.
Come and find me.

512
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,800
Don't worry.

513
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,200
We're going
To fiji.

514
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
Fiji. We're
Moving to fiji.

515
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,900
Fiji?

516
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Sylvia!

517
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,800
Hey!

518
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Why didn't he just
Follow her to fiji?

519
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,100
His mother got sick,
Really sick.

520
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,500
He couldn't leave her.
He's kind.

521
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,300
Maybe he's too kind.

522
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,500
I can't believe he married
Meryl on the rebound.

523
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,300
Excuse me.

524
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:07,900
Come on, sal.

525
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,100

Frequency or something.

554
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,400
It sometimes happens,
And it can drive you crazy.

555
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,300
Ok, it's classical clive
Back in here,

556
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,400
And we've still got
Some great music up ahead,

557
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,700
But hey,
Don't forget to buckle up.

558
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,900
Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.

559
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,700
A safe driver is what?
Yes.

560
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,900
[turns radio off]

561
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,500
Morning, ma'am.

562
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,100
[electrical buzzing]

563
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,100
I love that idea.

564
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,300
It's pretty cool,
Isn't it?

565
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,000
Yeah, i love it.

566
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,400
[speaking spanish]

567
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,700
[ding]

568
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,500
Can i help?

569
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,900
Yeah. I have
An appointment

570
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,100
At gable
Enterprises.

571
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,800
That's impossible.

572
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,900
What's happening?

573
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,000
Guard: nothing.

574
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,500
Just tell me
What's happening.

575
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,400
Got to go, sir.
We're remodeling.

576
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,000
No, you're not.

577
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,700
What are those people
Doing back there?

578
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,500
It's none of
Your business.

579
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,400
If you don't tell me what's
Happening, i'll report you!

580
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,000
You're trespassing.

581
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,000
Right.

582
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,700
Marlon!

583
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,500
Truman.

584
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,400
What are you
Doing here?

585
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,500
[whispering]
I gotta talk to you.

586
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,000
It's a bad time, ok?
I'm way behind.

587
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,100
I'm onto something, marlon.
Something big.

588
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,300
You ok?
You look like shit.

589
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
I think i'm mixed up
In something.

590
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,000
Mixed up in what?

591
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,200
There's no point
Trying to explain it,

592
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,400
But a lot of strange things
Have been happening.

593
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,700
[stammering]

594
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
The people on the elevator.

595
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,200
There was
No backing on it.

596
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,200
I looked out.
There was people there.

597
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,700
And on the radio
On the way to work,

598
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,100
It starts
Following me along,

599
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,100
Talking about everything
That i'm doing.

600
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,800
You know what i mean?

601
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,100
Truman, look, this is
One of your fantasies.

602
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,700
I think
This is about my dad.

603
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,900
Your dad?

604
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,900
I think he's alive.

605
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,500
Yeah. I'll tell you
About it later.

606
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,400
I'm definitely
Being followed.

607
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,900
Who?

608
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,700
It's hard to tell.

609
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,800
They look just like
Regular people.

610
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,800
How about those two?

611
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,500
Truman: i don't know.

612
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,000
Could be.

613
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,300
It's when i'm unpredictable,
That's--they can't...

614
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,800
Did anything happen?

615
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,200
No.

616
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,500
Mm-hmm. We gotta
Get out of here.

617
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,200
You ready to go?

618
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,700
No. I just
Came here. Come on.

619
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,900
I told you i can't.

620
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,400
[growls]

621
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,100
You're gonna get both our asses
Fired. You know that.

622
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,900
Ok, man,
Let's do it.

623
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,600
What?
Whatever you say.

624
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,600
I'm game.

625
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,600
Marlon: what are you
Talking about?

626
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Yes, siree. Your birthday
Comes but once a year.

627
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,500
Truman: maybe i'm being
Set up for something.

628
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,500
You ever think
About that, marlon?

629
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,500
Like your whole life

630
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,100
Has been building
Towards something?

631
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,600
Mmm, no.

632
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,400
When you were
Hauling chickens

633
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,400
In the summer
For kaiser,

634
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,800
What was
The furthest

635
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,100
You ever got
Off the island?

636
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,500
Went all over.

637
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,600
Never found a place
Like this, though.

638
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,500
Look at that sunset,
Truman.

639
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,500
It's perfect.

640
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,600
Yeah.

641
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,900
That's the big guy.

642
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,400
Quite a paintbrush
He's got.

643
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,900
Yup.

644
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,700
Just between you
And me, marlon...

645
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,700
I'm going away
For a while.

646
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,200
Really?

647
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,400
Yeah.

648
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,300
Mother: oh, little angel.

649
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,200
[women laugh]

650
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,300
Oh, my little clown.

651
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,300
Old carrot top.

652
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,900
The best photos.

653
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,100
Ohh.
Ohh.

654
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,900
We should be getting you
Home, mother.

655
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,000
Hold on a minute.
Here's us at mount rushmore.

656
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,700
Do you remember, truman,
When dad was still with us?

657
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,300
That was quite a drive.

658
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,300
You slept
The whole way there.

659
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
Truman:
It looks so small.

660
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,100
Things always do
When you look back, darling.

661
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:34,900
Oh, look, truman.

662
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,800
The happiest day
Of our lives.

663
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,000
Oh, look.

664
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,100
Jean, jodie, joanne.

665
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,900
Doesn't she look
Beautiful, truman?

666
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,800
Well, she still does.

667
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,100
And there's lots of pages
Left over for baby photos.

668
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,300
I would like to hold
A grandchild in my arms

669
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:54,900
Before i go.

670
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,400
Angela, we really should
Be getting you home.

671
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,100
I'll take her.

672
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
No, no, no.
You stay, relax.

673
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,000
Enjoy yourself.

674
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Your favorite show
Will be coming on.

675
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,000
Besides, we have
Something to discuss.

676
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,900
A certain person's
Birthday.

677
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,500
Oh, i see.

678
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,000
Tv announcer: and there'll be
Another episode

679
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,000
  Of  i love lucy
Same time tomorrow.

680
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,400
  But right now it's time
For   golden oldies.

681
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,400
Tonight, we present
The enduring, much-loved classic

682
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,500
  Show me the way to go home.

683
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,500
A hymn of praise
To small-town life,

684
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Where we learn that you don't
Have to leave home

685
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,500
To discover
What the world's all about,

686
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,600
And that no one is poor
Who has friends.

687
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,700
Full of laughter and love,
Pain and sadness,

688
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,800
But ultimately redemption,

689
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,800
We share the trials
And tribulations

690
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,600
Of the abbott family.

691
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,800
Note the touching performance of
Ronald brierly as uncle buddy.

692
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,800
And that scene with the bowl
Of cherries is gonna have you

693
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,600
Splitting your sides
With laughter all over again.

694
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,900
And there'll be tears, too,

695
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,000
When david and jennifer
Are reunited.

696
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,100
But enough from me.
Let's join the abbotts

697
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,700
In camden village.

698
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,000
[birds chirping]

699
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,800
[radio static]

700
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,400
Oh.

701
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,100
Thank you, sweetie.

702
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,400
I need to talk to you,

703
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,100
But let's go outside.

704
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,300
Oh, sweetie, i'd love to,
But i'm really late.

705
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,000
What's your rush?

706
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,300
Surgery.

707
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,200
There was that elevator
Disaster downtown.

708
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,700
It was on the news
Last night.

709
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,900
This cable just snapped.
This elevator,

710
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,300
It just plummeted down
10 flights.

711
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,400
The non-union workers.

712
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Just monsters.
You know, that building,

713
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,100
It's right next door
To where you work.

714
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,200
Can you imagine if you
Had been in there?

715
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,100
It's not even worth
Thinking about.

716
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,100
Anyway,
I have an amputation

717
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,300
On one of the young
Women in that elevator.

718
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,400
She's very young.

719
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,300
It's very sad.

720
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,400
Anyway, wish me luck.

721
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,300
I'll cross my fingers
For you.

722
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,600
[brakes squeal]

723
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,200
Uh, excuse me.
Hi. Excuse me.

724
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,100
May i help you?

725
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:53,600
Oh, uh...

726
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Yes. I'm looking for my wife,
Nurse burbank.

727
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,600
It's very important.

728
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,200
I'm afraid that
That's not possible.

729
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
She's in pre-op.

730
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,100
Sure.

731
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,000
Ok, fine.

732
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,600
Can you pass along a message?

733
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,400
I'll try.

734
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,300
Can you tell her
I had to go to fiji

735
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,100
And that i'll call her
When i get there?

736
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,000
When you--
When you get to fiji?

737
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,900
You got it.

738
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,600
Fine. I'll tell her.

739
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,100
Thank you so much.

740
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,700
Sorry.

741
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,300
It's ok.

742
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,300
He's here.

743
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,700
Meryl: i know, i know.
Shh, shh, shh.

744
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,300
Scalpel.

745
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,400
Ahem.

746
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,000
I'm now making
My primary incision

747
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,900
Just above the right knee.

748
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,900
[loud clang]

749
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,000
Nicely done.

750
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,000
This isn't
Going to be pretty.

751
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,700
It's just
Beautiful.

752
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,100
Beautiful job.

753
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,300
I'll just let someone else
Tidy up here.

754
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,300
I'm sorry to keep you.

755
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,700
Oh, that's ok.

756
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,200
How can i help?

757
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,500
I would like to book
A flight to fiji.

758
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,500
When would you like
To leave?

759
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,500
Today.

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,100
I'm sorry.

764
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:34,300
I don't have anything
For at least a month.

765
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,800
A month?

766
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,500
It's the busy season.

767
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,300
You want to book the flight?

768
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
It doesn't matter.

769
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,500
I'll make other
Arrangements, ok?

770
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,300
Man:
Last call for chicago!

771
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,900
All aboard!

[whistles]

773
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,400
Thank you.

774
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,900
Windy city, here we come.

775
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,400
Hi.
Hi.

776
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,800
Hello.

777
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,200
Hi.

778
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,400
Truman: sisters.

779
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,100
Hey, mom, isn't that--

780
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,200
Mom: shh.
Face the front.

[radiator hissing]

786
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,400
Everybody off.
We've got a problem.

787
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,500
I'm sorry, son.

788
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,100
His father was from
Chicago, wasn't he?

789
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,700
No. His dentist
Was from pensacola.

790
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,200
His father
Was from des moines.

791
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,300
But how come he wants
To go to chicago?

792
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,600
He's not going to chicago.
He's not going anywhere.

793
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,400
  He has to have it out
With meryl.

794
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,000
[pluto barks]

795
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,200
Truman?

796
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,600
Honey, are you ok?

797
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,100
Get in.

798
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,600
Truman.

799
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,200
Look.

800
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,100
What?
Shh.

801
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:20,900
I predict

802
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,700
That in just a moment

803
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,700
We will see a lady
On a red bike,

804
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,100
Followed by a man
With flowers

805
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,900
And a volkswagen beetle

806
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,400
With a dented fender.

807
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,100
Truman, please.

808
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,700
Truman: look.

809
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,600
Lady...

810
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,800
Flowers...

811
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,300
Both: and...

812
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,500
Truman, this is silly.

813
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,000
There it is!
There it is!

814
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,100
  There's that dented
Beetle! Yes!

815
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,700
Aaaaaah!

816
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,100
Ha ha ha!

817
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,900
Don't you want to know
How i did that?

818
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,800
I'll tell you.

819
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,800
They're on a loop.

820
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,400
They go around the block.

821
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,300
They come back.

822
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,600
They go around again.

823
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,000
They just go
Round and round.

824
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:12,500
Round and round.

825
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,800
I invited rita and marlon
For a barbecue on sunday.

826
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,200
I won't be here
Sunday.

827
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,100
And i need you to remind me
That we need more charcoal.

828
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,300
Are you listening
To a word i'm saying?

829
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,600
You're upset because
You want to go to fiji.

830
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,600
Is that it?

831
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,100
Ok, ok, go.

832
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:38,000
I think you should save
For a few months

833
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,500
And then go. There.

834
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,500
Are you happy now?

835
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,400
I want to go take a shower.

836
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,300
Let's go now.

837
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,000
I'm ready to go now.
Why wait?

838
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,200
Early bird
Gathers no moss.

839
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,300
Rolling stone catches
The worm, right?

840
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,700
[laughs]

841
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,700
Meryl: truman,
What are you doing?

842
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,100
Oh!

843
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:03,700
Truman!

844
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,800
Where shall we go?
Where shall we go?

845
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,200
Truman, where
Are we going?

846
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:12,500
I don't really know.
I guess i'm being spontaneous.

847
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,100
Somebody help me!

848
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,300
I'm being spontaneous!

849
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,600
Meryl: truman.

850
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,300
Forget fiji.

851
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,800
Can't very well drive
To fiji, can we?

852
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,200
No.

853
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,300
What about
Atlantic city?

854
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,400
Oh, no, you hate
To gamble.

855
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,400
That's right,
I do, don't i?

856
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,300
So why would you want
To go there?

857
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,600
Because i never have.

858
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,700
That's why people
Go places, isn't it?

859
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,900
Truman, truman,
I think i'm gonna throw up.

860
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,700
Me, too.

861
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,700
Blocked at every turn.

862
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,400
Beautifully synchronized,
Don't you agree?

863
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,800
You're blaming me
For the traffic?

864
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,300
Should i?

865
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,200
Truman...

866
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,400
Let's go home.

867
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,300
You're right.

868
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,800
We could be stuck
Here for hours.

869
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,800
It could be like this
All the way to atlantic city.

870
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Let's go back.

871
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,100
I'm sorry. I don't know
What got into me.

872
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,700
Meryl: can you
Please slow down?

873
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,500
Yes, i can.

874
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,900
Truman! Truman!
That's our turnoff!

875
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,200
I changed my mind again.

876
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,300
What's new orleans like
This time of year?

877
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,100
Mardi gras! Whoo!
Ha ha ha!

878
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,500
[honking]

879
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,000
Whoo!

880
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,100
Look, meryl, same road,
No cars. It's magic.

881
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:49,900
Ha ha ha!

882
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,300
You let me out. You're
Not right in the head.

883
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,700
You want to destroy
Yourself, do it on your own.

884
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,700
I think i'd like
A little company.

885
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,700
Oh, truman...

886
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,500
You knew
This would happen.

887
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
  You know you can't
Drive over water.

888
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,000
Let's go home
Where you'll feel safe.

889
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,800
Give me your hand.

890
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,600
Sweetie--

891
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,600
Drive.

892
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,800
Truman!

893
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,100
We shouldn't be doing this!
We're breaking the law!

894
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,900
Oh, my!
You can do it!

895
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,500
Please, don't!

896
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,500
You can make it!
Truman!

897
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,800
Aah! Oh, we're over!

898
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,900
We're over the bridge!
We're over the bridge!

899
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,300
We're over?

900
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,600
We're over the bridge.
We're over the bridge.

901
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,600
We're over!

902
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,200
Ha ha ha ha!

903
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,900
Truman! What
About that sign?

904
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,700
They're exaggerating.
We'll be fine.

905
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,800
  Exaggerating?
Do you believe that?

906
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,000
[yelling]

907
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,000
Oh, my! Oh, my!
Truman, we're on fire!

908
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,200
It's ok.
We're on fire!

909
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,600
  It's ok.
It's just smoke.

910
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,100
You ok?
Yes.

911
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,200
Want to do it again?
No!

912
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,300
Ha ha ha ha!

913
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,100
Truman, stop!
Oh, god!

914
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,400
Oh!

915
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,400
So, what are we going
To do for money

916
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,200
  When we get
To new orleans?

917
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,100
I have my seahaven
Bank card.

918
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,700
We're just going to eat
Into our savings, is that it?

919
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,600
I'm going to have to call
Your mother when we get there.

920
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,900
She's going
To be worried sick.

921
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,100
I don't know how
She's going to take this.

922
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,500
What now?

923
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,600
Loudspeaker: red alert!
This is a red alert!

924
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,400
[people yelling]

925
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,600
[car horns honking]

926
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,400
Truman, it looks like
A leak at the plant.

927
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,500
Back up! Back up!
Leak at the plant.

928
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,900
We had to shut her down.

929
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,400
Is there
Any way around?

930
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,400
Whole area's
Being evacuated.

931
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,900
Is there
Anything i can do?

932
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:02,600
No, ma'am.

933
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,600
Thank you
For your help.

934
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,400
You're welcome,
Truman.

935
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,700
Truman.

936
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Truman! Truman!

937
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,700
Truman, come back!

938
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,500
Truman! Truman!
Stop him!

939
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,400
Unh!

940
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,300
Truman!

941
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,200
[whistles blowing]

942
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,800
Head to the left!

943
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,900
Aah! Aah!

944
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,700
Stay away!

945
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,700
Unh! Aah!

946
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,200
Unh! No!

947
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,200
No!

948
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,000
Radio:
...now in custody.

949
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,700
[truman groaning]

950
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,200
Thank you both so much
For your help.

951
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,800
I really appreciate it.

952
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,100
He's lucky to be
Alive, ma'am.

953
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,200
Next time, we'll have
To file charges.

954
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,800
I understand.

955
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,900
Thanks again.

956
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,500
Good night.

957
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,500
Let me get you
Some help, truman.

958
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,500
You're not well.

959
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,700
Why do you want
To have a baby with me?

960
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,500
You can't stand me.

961
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,800
That's not true.

962
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,300
[scoffs]

963
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,600
Why don't you let me fix you
Some of this new mococoa drink?

964
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,100
All natural cocoa beans
From the upper slopes

965
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,400
Of mount nicaragua.
No artificial sweeteners.

966
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,400
What the hell
Are you talking about?

967
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,100
Who are you talking to?

968
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,400
I've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.

969
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,200
What the hell does this
Have to do with anything?

970
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,300
Tell me what's happening!

971
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,500
You're having a nervous
Breakdown, that's what.

972
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,700
You're part of this,
Aren't you?

973
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,000
Truman!
Meryl!

974
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,800
You...are...scaring me!

975
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,300
No, you're scaring me, meryl.

976
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,300
What are you going to do?
Dice me?

977
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,400
Slice me
And peel me?

978
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,300
There are
So many choices!

979
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,900
Aah! Do something!

980
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,100
What?

981
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,900
What did you say?
Who are you talking to?

982
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:42,500
Nothing. I didn't
Say anything.

983
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,300
I didn't
Say anything.

984
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,700
You said,
"do something."

985
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,700
No, i didn't. I wasn't
Talking to anybody.

986
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,000
Talk to me!

987
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:49,600
[banging]

988
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,500
I don't know anything!
Please stop!

989
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,800
Stay where
You are!

990
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,300
Truman?

991
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,400
Truman?

992
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,300
Oh, thank god!
Oh, thank god!

993
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,300
[sobbing]

994
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,600
How can anyone
Expect me

995
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,600
To carry on under
These conditions?

996
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,100
It's unprofessional!

997
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,700
Shh, it's ok.

998
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,500
Everything's
Gonna be ok.

999
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,600
Oh, god!

1000
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,400
It's all
Gonna be fine.

1001
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,100
I don't know what
To think, marlon.

1002
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,300
Maybe i'm losing
My mind, but...

1003
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,000
It feels like the whole world
Revolves around me somehow.

1004
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:46,200
That's a lot of world
For one man, truman.

1005
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,100
Sure that's not
Wishful thinking?

1006
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,800
You wishing you'd made

1007
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Something more
Out of yourself?

1008
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,000
Come on, who hasn't
Sat in the john,

1009
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,400
  Had an imaginary interview
On  seahaven tonight?

1010
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,800
Who hasn't wanted
To be somebody?

1011
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
This is different.
Everybody seems to be in on it.

1012
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,000
I've been your best friend
Since we were 7 years old.

1013
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,500
The only way you and i ever
Made it through school

1014
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,700
Was by cheating off
Each other's test papers.

1015
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,300
Jesus, they were identical.

1016
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,300
But i always felt safe
Knowing that.

1017
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,800
'Cause whatever
The answer was,

1018
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
We were right together
And we were wrong together.

1019
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,600
Remember when i stayed up
All night in your tent

1020
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,700
'Cause you wanted
To play north pole?

1021
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,500
And i got pneumonia?

1022
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,400
[laughing]

1023
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,300
You remember that?

1024
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,400
You were out of school
For about a month.

1025
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,900
You're the closest thing
I ever had to a brother.

1026
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:06,100
I know that things...

1027
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,800
Haven't really worked
Out for either of us

1028
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,800
Like we used to
Dream they would.

1029
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:12,700
I know that feeling,

1030
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,900
When it's like everything's
Slipping away...

1031
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,600
You don't want
To believe it,

1032
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,700
So you look for answers
Somewhere else, but...

1033
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,100
Well...

1034
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,200
Christof:
But, well, the point is...

1035
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,200
I'd gladly walk in front
Of traffic for you.

1036
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,500
Marlon: well...

1037
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,100
The point is,
I would gladly

1038
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,800
Step in front of traffic
For you, truman.

1039
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And the last thing
I'd ever do is lie to you.

1040
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,800
And the last thing
That i would ever do...

1041
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,200
Is lie to you.

1042
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,900
I mean, think about it,
Truman.

1043
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,600
If everybody
Is in on it...

1044
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:09,500
I'd have to be
In on it, too.

1045
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,000
I'm not in on it,
Truman, because...

1046
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,200
There is no "it."

1047
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,000
You were right about
One thing, though.

1048
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,000
What's that?

1049
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,000
The thing that
Started all this.

1050
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,500
Yep. I found him
For you, truman.

1051
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,400
That's why
I came by tonight.

1052
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,500
I'm sure he's got
Quite a story to tell.

1053
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,200
Go to him.

1054
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,300
Easy on the fog.

1055
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,800
[keyboard clicking]

1056
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,500
Stand by, crane cam.

1057
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,600
Crane cam.

1058
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,900
Button cam 3.

1059
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,300
I never stopped believing.

1060
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:49,100
Christof:
And wide, curb cam 8.

1061
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,500
My son! Oh!

1062
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,200
Move in
For a closeup?

1063
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,800
No, no, no.

1064
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,000
Move back and...
Fade up music.

1065
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,500
[music swells]

1066
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And now go in close.

1067
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,800
All those
Years wasted.

1068
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,700
I'll make it up
To you, son.

1069
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,400
I swear.

1070
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,000
[music swells]

1071
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,100
Dad.

1072
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:29,000
Yes!

1073
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,500
[laughing]

1074
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,600
Bravo.

1075
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,600
That was a really great
Experience.

1076
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,400
Tech:
Congratulations.

1077
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,600
Ok, quiet down.
Let's concentrate.

1078
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,400
Chloe:
That was good work.

1079
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:47,700
Whoo!

1080
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,800
Tech: let's get
Some champagne up here.

1081
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,500
Congratulations.

1082
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,600
Moses: brilliant, christof.
Just brilliant.

1083
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,600
Roman:
It just broke my heart.

1084
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,700
Well done, everyone!

1085
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,100
Bravo!

1086
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:23,500
Announcer: 1.7 billion
Were there for his birth.

1087
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,500
220 countries tuned in
For his first step.

1088
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
The world stood still
For that stolen kiss,

1089
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,200
And as he grew,
So did the technology.

1090
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,100
An entire human life

1091
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,400
Recorded on an intricate
Network of hidden cameras

1092
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,700
And broadcast live and
Unedited 24 hours a day,

1093
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,600
7 days a week to an audience
Around the globe.

1094
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,300
Coming to you now
From seahaven island,

1095
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,500
Enclosed in the largest
Studio ever constructed,

1096
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,800
And along with
The great wall of china,

1097
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,200
One of only 2 manmade structures
Visible from space,

1098
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,200
Now in its 30th great year,

1099
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,500
It's...

1100
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,100
What a week it's been.
I don't know about you--

1101
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,900
I was on pins and needles
The entire time.

1102
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,200
Hello and good evening.
I'm your host mike michaelson,

1103
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:21,900
  And welcome to  tru-talk,

1104
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,800
Our forum for issues
Growing out of the show.

1105
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,900
But tonight,
Something very special indeed,

1106
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,200
A rare and
Exclusive interview

1107
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,700
With the show's
Conceiver and creator.

1108
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,000
So, come with us now as we
Go live to the lunar room

1109
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,200
On the 221st floor
Of the omni cam echosphere,

1110
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,900
Where we'll find the world's
Greatest tele-visionary--

1111
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:45,300
The designer and architect
Of the world within a world

1112
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,300
That is seahaven island--
Christof.

1113
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,000
Before we begin,
I'd like to thank you

1114
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,700
On behalf of our audience
For granting this interview.

1115
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,700
We know how demanding
Your schedule is,

1116
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,000
And we all know how jealously
You guard your privacy.

1117
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,600
This, sir,
Is indeed an honor.

1118
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:03,300
Don't mention it.

1119
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,700
Well, the catalyst for
The recent dramatic events

1120
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,800
On the show has been
Truman's father, kirk,

1121
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,300
And his attempts
To infiltrate the show.

1122
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,700
But before we get into that,
I think it's worth noting

1123
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,100
That this is not the first time
Someone from the outside

1124
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,500
Has attempted
To reach truman, is it?

1125
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,100
Christof: we have had
Close calls in the past.

1126
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,000
Man: truman!
It's television!

1127
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,400
Yes!

1128
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,100
Yes! I did it!

1129
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,500
  I'm on  the truman show!

1130
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,200
Mike: but there's never
Been anything to compare

1131
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,800
With this most recent
Breach in security--

1132
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
The first intruder to be
A former cast member.

1133
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,100
A dead one at that.

1134
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,300
Gotta say, writing kirk
Back in--masterstroke.

1135
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,100
Since kirk started this
Crisis in truman's life,

1136
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:47,200
I came to the conclusion
That only he could end it.

1137
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,900
Truman! Truman! No!

1138
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,300
[construction noises]

1139
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,400
That's off limits!

1140
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,600
Why? What's
Over there?

1141
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,700
Nothing. It's dangerous.
That's all.

1142
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,600
You've got to know
Your limitations, truman.

1143
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,200
Mike: but let's remind
Viewers exactly why

1144
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,600
Dad was written out
In the first place.

1145
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,600
Christof: as truman grew up,
We were forced

1146
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,800
To manufacture ways
To keep him on the island.

1147
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,900
I'd like to be
An explorer,

1148
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,600
Like the great
Magellan.

1149
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,300
You're too late.

1150
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,300
There's really
Nothing left to explore.

1151
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,800
[snarling]

1152
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,500
Christof: finally, i came up
With kirk's drowning.

1153
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,200
Mike: most effective.

1154
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,100
Truman's been terrified
Of the water ever since.

1155
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,400
Christof: when kirk read
The synopsis of the episode,

1156
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,300
He was disappointed
To say the least.

1157
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,000
Jesus!

1158
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,300
I'm sure that's what caused
Him to break onto the set.

1159
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,700
But how do you intend to
Explain his 22-year absence?

1160
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:41,600
Amnesia.

1161
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,800
Brilliant. Let's take
Some viewer phone calls.

1162
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:48,400
Charlotte, north carolina,
You're on with christof.

1163
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,500
Man: uh, yeah,
Hi, christof.

1164
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,800
I was wondering how many
Cameras you got in that town.

1165
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:57,400
Somewhere in
The vicinity of 5,000.

1166
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,100
Man: that's
A lot of cameras.

1167
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,100
Remember, we started
With just one.

1168
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,900
He was curious
From birth.

1169
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,900
Premature by 2 weeks.

1170
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,800
Almost as if he couldn't
Wait to get started.

1171
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Mike: his eagerness
To leave his mother's womb

1172
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,700
Was the very reason
He was the one selected.

1173
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,500
In competition with 5 other
Unwanted pregnancies,

1174
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,700
The casting of a show,
Determined by an air date,

1175
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,600
Truman was the one
Who arrived on cue.

1176
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,000
Mike: incidentally, i believe
Truman is the first child

1177
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,200
To have been legally adopted
By a corporation.

1178
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,400
That's correct.

1179
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,600
The show has generated
Enormous revenues now,

1180
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,100
Equivalent to the gross national
Product of a small country.

1181
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,200
People forget it takes
The population

1182
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,900
Of an entire country to
Keep the show running.

1183
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,800
Since the show is on
24-hours a day

1184
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,300
Without commercial interruption,
All those staggering revenues

1185
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,900
Are generated
By product placement.

1186
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,400
That's true. Everything
On the show is for sale.

1187
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,000
From the actor's wardrobe,
Food products,

1188
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,100
To the very homes
They live in.

1189
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,400
Mike: and all of it available
In the truman catalog.

1190
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:02,900
Operators are standing by.

1191
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,700
Christof, let me ask you,

1192
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,900
Why do you think truman
Has never come close

1193
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,300
To discovering the true nature
Of his world until now?

1194
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,500
We accept the reality
Of the world

1195
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:15,600
With which we are
Presented.

1196
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,900
It's as simple as that.

1197
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,800
The hague for christof.

1198
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,500
Hello? The hague?

1199
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,600
All right,
We've lost that call.

1200
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,800
  Let's go to hollywood.
You're on  tru-talk.

1201
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,600
Hi, christof. I'd just
Like to say one thing.

1202
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,100
You're a liar
And a manipulator,

1203
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,200
And what you've done
To truman is sick!

1204
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,300
Well, we remember
This voice, don't we?

1205
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:39,700
How could we forget?

1206
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,200
Mike: let's go
To another call.

1207
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,100
No, no, no.
It's fine, mike.

1208
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,700
I love to reminisce with
Former members of the cast.

1209
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,900
Sylvia...

1210
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,200
As you announced so
Melodramatically to the world,

1211
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,700
You think because you batted
Your eyes at truman once...

1212
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,900
Flirted with him...

1213
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,400
Stole a few minutes
Of air time with him...

1214
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,900
To thrust yourself and your
Politics into the limelight...

1215
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,900
That you know him?

1216
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,900
That you know
What's right for him?

1217
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,200
You really think you're
In a position to judge him?

1218
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,300
What right do you have
To take a baby

1219
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,400
And turn his life into
Some kind of mockery?

1220
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:22,200
Don't you ever
Feel guilty?

1221
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,100
I have given truman a chance
To lead a normal life.

1222
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,900
The world...

1223
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:33,000
The place you live in...

1224
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,700
Is the sick place.

1225
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,300
Seahaven's the way
The world should be.

1226
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,000
He's not a performer.
He's a prisoner.

1227
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,500
Look at him! Look at
What you've done to him!

1228
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,700
He can leave at any time.

1229
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,400
If his was more
Than just a vague ambition,

1230
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,700
If he was absolutely determined
To discover the truth,

1231
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
There's no way
We could prevent him.

1232
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,200
I think what distresses
You really, caller,

1233
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,100
Is that ultimately...

1234
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,200
Truman prefers his cell,
As you call it.

1235
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,500
That's where
You're wrong.

1236
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,700
You're so wrong, and
He'll prove you wrong.

1237
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,500
Mike: well, aside from
The heated comments

1238
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,400
Of a very
Vocal minority,

1239
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,100
It's been an overwhelmingly
Positive experience.

1240
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,600
Yes. For truman and
For the viewing public.

1241
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,500
Well, christof,
I can't thank you enough

1242
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,300
For giving so generously
Of your time tonight.

1243
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:28,700
I think it's safe to say now
That this crisis is behind us

1244
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:30,300
And truman is back
To his old self,

1245
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,000
We can look forward to some
Exciting new developments?

1246
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,800
Well, mike, the big news

1247
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Is that meryl
Will be leaving truman

1248
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,700
In an upcoming episode,

1249
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:41,900
And a new romantic interest
Will be introduced.

1250
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:42,400
Mike: aha.

1251
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,000
I'm determined television's
First on-air conception

1252
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,400
Will still take place.

1253
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,600
Well, another television
Milestone straight ahead.

1254
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,500
You heard it here first.

1255
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,900
It has been a singular honor
And pleasure, sir.

1256
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,600
Christof...thank you.

1257

Christof: what's he doing
In the basement?

01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,800
He moved down there after
Meryl packed up and left.

Why wasn't i told?

1338
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,700
Any unpredictable behavior
Has to be reported.

Uh, he--he's just sleeping,
I thought.

But halfway through,

He gave up,
And he fell asleep.

01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,800
He can't disappear.

1437
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,600
[siren]

1438
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,100
[pluto barking, snarling]

1439
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,800
Spencer: go.

1440
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,100
Hunt him. Hunt him.
Yeah.

1441
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,500
Go find him, pluto.

1442
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:59,200
Good dog! Good dog!

1443
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,300
All this fuss.

1444
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,200
If he could just
Hear my voice.

1445
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:07,200
Truman!

1446
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:08,900
Truman!

1447
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:10,700
Let me try.

1448
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,300
Truman!

1449
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,000
It's me! Dad!

1450
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:19,100
Let's talk!

1451
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:22,300
Yeah, i know.

1452
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,700
Just about done
With the square.

1453
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,900
Got to go back to barrymore,
Check the interiors.

1454
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,100
He's got to be in there.

1455
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,600
Simeon:
Barrymore, huh?

1456
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,000
Uh-huh.

1457
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,100
But what about the college?
Who's watching that?

1458
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:32,700
I don't know.

1459
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,200
Send somebody
Over there, ok?

1460
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:36,800
All right.

1461
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,700
Take another man and get
Down there now, all right?

1462
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,800
I don't give a damn. Just
Find the son of a bitch.

1463
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Get some batteries. This guy's
Not gonna glow in the dark.

1464
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:47,800
Just get 'em down here.

1465
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,100
I don't know what's going
On. Reroute it back to me.

1466
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,000
We need more light.

1467
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,900
We'll never find him
This way.

1468
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,300
What time is it?

1469
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:04,200
It's way too early
For that.

1470
01:20:10,700 --> 01:20:13,100
Cue the sun.

1471
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,600
[people gasp]

1472
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:18,400
Jeez!

1473
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,700
What time is it?

1474
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,700
Christof,
What's going on?

1475
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,300
Did you know that there's
A rumor circulating

1476
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,600
That he's dead?
You hear me?

1477
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,300
The media is having
A feeding frenzy over this.

1478
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,900
All the phone lines
Are jammed,

1479
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,900
And every network has
A pirated shot of marlon

1480
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,500
Making an ass of himself
In front of the camera.

1481
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:36,800
The sponsors are threatening
To rip up their contracts.

1482
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,700
Why? We're getting higher
Ratings with this graphic

1483
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,700
Than we've ever had
On this show.

1484
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:45,900
No sign of him.

1485
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:49,000
Why don't you head back
To town and join the others?

1486
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:52,100
Everyone else is
At first positions, ok?

1487
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:52,900
Thank you.

1488
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,000
Everyone's at first
Positions, right?

1489
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,700
Simeon:
We've got the light.

1490
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:15,700
So he's got to
Be there somewhere.

1491
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,200
We're not
Watching the sea.

1492
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,500
Simeon: hang on a minute.
Why would we watch the sea?

1493
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,200
Sweep the harbor.

1494
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,100
Bring up the harbor cameras.

1495
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,900
Shift all harbor cameras
To computer, please.

1496
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,600
Some of those are out,
Aren't they?

1497
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,000
Operator: yeah.
We have 4 of them down,

1498
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,300
But we have
The lighthouse cameras up.

1499
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,800
All buoy cams, please.

1500
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:35,600
Moses:
What's happening?

1501
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,700
Operator: ok. Long lens,
Short base cameras.

1502
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,400
Moses: why are we
Looking at the water?

1503
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,400
Operator: pan it,
Will you, please?

1504
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,900
Truman...

1505
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,400
Where are you going?

1506
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,600
How can he sail?
He's in insurance.

1507
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,200
Operator: isn't he
Terrified of the water?

1508
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:57,200
Resume transmission.

1509
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,900
Resuming transmission.

1510
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:05,800
I got 2 to 1
He doesn't make it.

1511
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,900
Man: hey, i want
A piece of that.

1512
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:09,900
2 to 1
He doesn't make it.

1513
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,500
[key tapping]

1514
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,000
Just leave 'em
In the car.

1515
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,500
Shh.

1516
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,800
Let's get off
This mast shot.

1517
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,400
We can't see his face.
Go to the cabin cam.

1518
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,900
Cabin cam.

1519
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:36,000
There. Perfect.

1520
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,700
That's our hero shot.

1521
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,400
Let's get another boat
Out there.

1522
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,400
Ok. Listen, gus, i need you to
Talk to the guys on the ferry.

1523
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,600
Come on. Get it moving.
Get it out of here.

1524
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,900
[grinding]

1525
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:15,100
Gus: come on.

1526
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:16,200
I'm just a bus driver.

1527
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,300
Bottom line is,
They can't drive the boat.

1528
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,900
They're actors.

1529
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,000
How do we stop him?

1530
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,500
Ok, uh...

1531
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,200
We're going to be accessing
The weather program now.

1532
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,800
So hold on to your hats.

1533
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,300
You got that?

1534
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:51,600
No. I think we're gonna
Want to localize the storm

1535
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,900
Over the boat.

1536
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,900
You can get
The coordinates for that.

1537
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,900
There's no rescue boat.
He won't know what to do.

1538
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:04,000
He'll turn back.
He'll be too afraid.

1539
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,300
[whispering]

1540
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:09,000
There she blows.

1541
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,300
[motor stalling]

1542
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,800
Come on.

1543
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,400
Give me some lightning.

1544
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,900
[thunder]

1545
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,500
Again!

1546
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:52,100
Hit him again!

1547
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,600
For god's sake, christof,
The whole world is watching.

1548
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,300
We can't let him die
In front of a live audience.

1549
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,400
He was born in front
Of a live audience.

1550
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,700
[cheering]

1551
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,200
Truman!

1552
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,700
You can do it!
Hold on!

1553
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:13,000
Is that the best
You can do?

1554
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:16,600
You're gonna have
To kill me!

1555
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,000
 What shall we do
With a drunken sailor 

1556
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:20,700
On behalf of the studio,

1557
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,300
I demand that you
Cease transmission.

1558
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:23,000
Keep running.

1559
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,200
 What shall we do
With a drunken sailor 

1560
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,500
 Early in the mornin'? 

1561
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:29,500
Increase the wind.

1562
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:30,300
Increase the wind!

1563
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,200
[truman
Continues singing]

1564
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,700
I'm telling you
For the last time.

1565
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:35,900
How close is he?
Very.

1566
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,300
Capsize him.
Tip him over.

1567
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,100
Damn you,
Christof!

1568
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,900
You can't. He's tied
Himself to the boat!

1569
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:40,300
Shut up!

1570
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,700
He's gonna drown,
And he doesn't even care.

1571
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,400
Do it.
No.

1572
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,800
Do it!

1573
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,100
[thunder]

1574
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:41,700
That's enough.

1575
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,700
[gagging]

1576
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,500
[crash]

1577
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,500
Oh.

1578
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,900
Oh.

1579
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:54,200
Christof:
I want to talk to him.

1580
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,300
Truman.

1581
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,300
[gasps]

1582
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,900
You can speak.

1583
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:20,400
[over speaker]
I can hear you.

1584
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:25,000
Who are you?

1585
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,200
I am the creator
Of a television show

1586
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:30,600
That gives hope and joy
And inspiration to millions.

1587
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,500
Then who am i?

1588
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:40,100
You're the star.

1589
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,100
Was nothing real?

1590
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,100
You were real.

1591
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:51,100
That's what made you
So good to watch.

1592
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:54,200
Listen to me, truman.

1593
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,800
There's no more truth
Out there...

1594
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Than there is in the world
I created for you.

1595
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,000
The same lies.

1596
01:33:05,900 --> 01:33:07,600
The same deceit.

1597
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,300
But in my world...

1598
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:14,200
You have nothing
To fear.

1599
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,500
I know you better
Than you know yourself.

1600
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,600
You never had
A camera in my head.

1601
01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:24,800
You're afraid.

1602
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,700
That's why
You can't leave.

1603
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:33,700
It's ok, truman.

1604
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,900
I understand.

1605
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:40,000
I have been watching you
Your whole life.

1606
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,200
I was watching
When you were born.

1607
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:49,800
I was watching when you
Took your first step.

1608
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
I watched you on your
First day of school.

1609
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,100
[laughs]

1610
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,300
The episode when you
Lost your first tooth.

1611
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:09,300
