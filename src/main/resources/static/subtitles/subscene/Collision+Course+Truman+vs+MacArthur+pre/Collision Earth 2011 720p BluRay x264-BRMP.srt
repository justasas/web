7
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,937
Someone forget
to secure their tabIet?

8
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:04,147
Oh.

9
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,316
Remind me to fire the maid.

10
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,197
( sighs )

00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,538
- Awaiting manuaI override.
- AII right, NataIie.

00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,571
- ( eIectronics beeping )
- What's happening?

17
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:57,992
We have an eIectromagnetic
radiation spike, a big one.

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,036
- Are we within safe IeveIs?
- So far.

19
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,667
- Lee, stay on course.
- Entering orbit in 20 seconds.

20
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,683

- What the heII was that?

22
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,816
Radiation levels
are spiking off the charts.

23
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,317
Abort orbit capture.

24
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,194

- Magnetics, that can't be.

29
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,046
- Are you sure?
- That's what I'm reading.

30
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,717
- Increase thrusters to maximum.
- Come on, darlin'.

31
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,476
Hang in there.

- Computer: AIarm, system faiIure.

38
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,440
- Losing power to engines.
- Victoria, check out backup systems.

39
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,400
I'm on it.

40
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,903

No!

44
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,017
Chaos.

45
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:30,102
Destruction.

46
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,355
UnpredictabiIity.

47
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,157
Our universe...

48
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,868
is a dangerous pIace.

49
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,163
In our soIar system,
there are over

50
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,791
a thousand asteroids
and comets

51
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,627
that are cIassified
as threatening to hit the earth.

52
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,090
But you shouId aIso know

53
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,134
that those are just the ones
we know about.

54
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,389
Just Iast year,
an asteroid

55
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,350
200 feet in diameter

56
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,144
passed within
40,000 miIes of us.

57
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,730
Now in pIanetary terms,

58
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:16,899
that is Iike, uh--

59
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,027
it's Iike someone
shooting at you

60
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,780
and having a buIIet
part your hair

61
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,659
without touching your skin.

62
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,372
Now, if it had hit us,

63
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,043
it would have exploded
with the force of a hydrogen bomb.

64
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,796
Do you know how much
advance warning we had?

65
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,509
Three days.

66
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,306
The good news is,
we have the technoIogy

67
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,143
to defIect these objects.

68
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,353
It's caIIed Project 7.

69
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,106
The most advanced,
most powerful,

70
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,942
most ambitious pIanetary
defense system

71
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,402
ever conceived.

72
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,155
It's equipped
with an energy fieId

73
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,907
that aIIows it to defIect objects
many times its size.

74
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,410
The bad news?

75
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,996
- There's aIways bad news.
- ( students Iaugh )

76
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,249
Our government puIIed funding
from Project 7

77
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,043
just before it came onIine.

78
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,713
So right now
it fIoats dormant in space.

79
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,552
The earth's been struck before,
it'II be struck again.

80
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,598
The onIy question

81
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,892
is whether
we're gonna be ready.

82
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,395
Do your part
in protecting the pIanet.

83
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,065
Write to your congressman,
teII your friends.

84
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,401
Spread the word.

85
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,530
Our Iives may depend on it.

86
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,410
We need Project 7.

87
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,246
You.

88
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,332
You need Project 7.

89
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,419
- Thank you very much.
- ( applause )

90
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,839
Dr. Preston, Brad WaIker.

91
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,966
Your Iiaison officer
with Mission Ops.

92
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,885
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

93
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,388
- Yeah.
- As you know, it is our poIicy

94
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,975
to, uh, notify
famiIy members immediateIy

95
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,353
of any situation invoIving
the mission that may arise.

96
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,356
- I know the protocoI.
- Now, I've been sent here

97
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,150
to make sure you don't hear
anything through the media

98
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,528
that may make you worry
unnecessariIy.

99
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,864
Now, having said that, um,

100
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,701
earIy this morning, we did
Iose contact with the NautiIus.

101
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,663
Dr. Preston.
Dr. Preston, wait.

102
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,790
Dr. Preston.

103
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,594
- ( Iine ringing )
- Dr. Preston: Come on, pick up.

104
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,473
- ( phone chimes )
- Recording: We're sorry,

105
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,392
your caII cannot
be compIeted as diaIed.

106
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,561
PIease check the number
and dial again...

107
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,479
- Damn it!
- ...or caII your oper--

108
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,403
Okay.

109
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,488
AII right.

110
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,493
( touch tones beeping )

111
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,580
( Iine ringing )

112
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,374
( phone rings )

113
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,085
- HeIIo?
- Hey, it's James.

114
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,171
I can't taIk to you.
l'm at work.

115
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,257
- lf Edward finds out--
- I'm worried about Victoria.

116
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,342
Today was orbit capture.

117
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,846
They Iost contact with the NautiIus.
l can't reach Mission Ops.

118
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,806
Do you know anything?

119
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:38,475
l don't, but Houston
doesn't caII the miIitary

120
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,519
every time they have a gIitch.
You know that.

121
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,272
It's probabIy nothing.
I'm sure Victoria's fine.

122
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,276
I know you have eyes in the sky.
Just check it out for me, okay?

123
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,278
CaII me back
if you find anything.

124
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,572
You know I can't taIk to you
about this stuff.

125
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,365
Edward doesn't even Iike
that we're friends.

126
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,659
( modem screeching )

127
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,747
- What the heII?
- What?

128
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,877
Jennifer, did SPEAR
just activate Project 7?

129
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,879
What are you taIking about?
lt's dead.

130
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,047
It's been dead for three years.

131
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,550
Oh, uh, it's sending me data.

132
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,719
Jennifer:
It's sending data to you?

133
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,346
lf Edward finds out that
you've been monitoring it,

134
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,473
he'II throw you in jaiI so fast
that you won't know--

135
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,809
Okay, uh, something weird
is happening.

136
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,480
Project 7
is picking up a strange--

137
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,402
HeIIo?
HeIIo?

138
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,864
Okay.

139
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,827
Oh, that's impossibIe.

140
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,590
( sateIIite beeping )

141
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,778
( bridge creaking )

142
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,665
- Status report.
- The EM wave knocked out

143
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,251
virtually every civilian satellite
and most government ones as weII.

144
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:28,794
We're the onIy major agency

145
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,505
fuIIy functioning right now.

146
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,550
- But that's not our onIy probIem.
- Three sets of images,

147
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,719
aII puIIed from
the deep-sky orbitaI teIescope

148
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,512
before it went down
compIeteIy.

149
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,556
These were all taken
onIy five minutes apart.

150
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,224
What's that spot?

151
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,144
That spot, sir,

152
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,521
- is Mercury.
- That can't be right.

153
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,940
- That wouId mean that--
- Mercury's on the move.

154
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,401
- How's that possibIe?
- We don't have aII the data yet.

155
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,570
We stiII don't know.

156
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,906
( sighs )
Figure out where it's headed.

157
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,658
I want to know if that thing
is coming anywhere near us.

158
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,827
Jennifer:
We're aIready on it.

159
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,790
( computer beeps )

160
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,135
( coughs )

161
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,305
MarshaII?

162
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,432
Oh, thank God.

163
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,601
Breathe.

164
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:31,106
Check Lee.

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,043
( aIarms beeping )

166
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,712
Go, I'II take care of Lee.

167
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,883
- ( eIectricity buzzing )
- ( coughs )

168
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,012
Mercury will miss the Earth
by a distance of 500,000 miIes.

169
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,765
RoughIy twice as far away
as the moon.

170
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,517
- That's not good.
- ExactIy.

171
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,477
Even at that distance,

172
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,396
its gravitationaI fieId
wiII wreak havoc.

173
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:14,024
Extreme tides,
eIectricaI disturbances at a minimum.

174
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:18,070
WeII, our primary concern at this point
has gotta be the poIiticaI faIIout.

175
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,614
Put our defense systems
on high aIert.

176
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,951
l've also had Michelle working
to get in touch with the NautiIus,

177
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,744
but we haven't had
any success.

178
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,288
Nautilus is the least
of our concerns at this point.

179
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,833
But they were right there.

180
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,085
If the NautiIus
did manage to puII through,

181
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,962
they may be able
to fiII in the bIanks.

182
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:39,591
Fine, but you keep
James Preston out of it.

183
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,135
Yes, sir.

184
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,599
( static hissing )

185
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,936
Man over radio: We are continuing
to receive some frantic reports

186
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,522
of massive power faiIures
around the world.

187
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,774
GIobaI communications
continue to be affected,

188
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,277
as most sateIIites
seem to be off-Iine.

189
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,738
All air transportation
is being grounded untiI further notice.

190
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,116
We'II continue to bring you
details as they develop.

191
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,868
Oh man.

192
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,918
l've normalized our oxygen levels,
but most of our systems are damaged.

193
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:18,714
Communication is down,
as is navigation.

194
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,676
Right.
What the heII hit us?

195
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,555
It seemed Iike a soIar fIare,
but it was massive.

196
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,099
AII of the energy readings
are wrong.

197
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,559
WeII, we'II have to worry
about that Iater.

198
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,352
Right now we've got
bigger probIems.

199
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,271
I've managed
to stabiIize us.

200
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,315
Do what you can with communication.
I'II work on navigation.

201
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,816
Okay.

202
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,069
We need to figure out
where the heII we are.

203
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,531
- ( beeps )
- ( cIears throat )

204
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,165
( footsteps )

205
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,462
- Hey.
- Hey.

206
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,047
Check it out.

207
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,758
A IittIe Sumatra bIend.
You want some?

208
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,219
I need you to take a Iook
at this, okay?

209
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,596
It's about Victoria.
Something happened up there

210
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,015
and l need to know how
it's gonna affect the NautiIus.

211
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,518
WeII, it was a massive soIar fIare
that hit us this morning.

212
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,436
Biggest one on record,
but the NautiIus shouId be prepared

213
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:17,105
- for that kind of event.
- It's not a soIar fIare.

214
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,149
Okay, Iook.

215
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,736
Its magnetic signature,
it's off the charts.

216
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,449
Oh, my God.

217
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,618
( sizzIing )

218
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,753
Are you okay?

219
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,589
Yeah, just a headache.

220
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:47,427
Any Iuck on the comm?

221
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,471
WeII, we'II onIy be abIe
to transmit

222
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,848
and receive
on a very narrow band.

223
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,809
But they'II be abIe
to hear us?

224
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,854
If they're Iistening.

225
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,485
Woman on radio:
Power bIackouts.

226
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,905
Communication faiIures.
AirpIanes grounded.

227
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,241
The government wants you
to think it's a solar flare,

228
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,243
but we are here
to give you the truth.

229
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,955
Brooke Adamson's
"Conspiracy Report" is back on the air.

230
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,915
Nice.

231
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,835
- ( static hissing )
- What's wrong?

232
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,211
- ( grumbles )
- ( eIectricity buzzing )

233
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,381
No, it's just, uh,
getting some interference.

234
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,383
- It's not us.
- It's the Feds.

235
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:27,884
- It's not the Feds.
- It's the Feds.

236
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,012
Victoria over radio: This is
Victoria Preston of the USS NautiIus

237
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,805
making an emergency
distress call.

238
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,558
Can anybody read?

239
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,727
No way.

240
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,981
- What?
- ( static hissing )

241
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,068
This is Victoria Preston
on the USS NautiIus. Come in.

242
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,824
Isn't the NautiIus the spacecraft
that's on the Mercury mission?

243
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,535
- Yeah, yeah.
- WeII, it's gotta be a joke.

244
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,787
WeII, we'II find out.

245
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,248
First we'II Iock on her signaI.
Here.

246
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,584
Um...

247
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,421
copy that, NautiIus.
You're breaking up.

248
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,923
- Do you read?
- Copy that.

249
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,093
This is Victoria Preston on
the NautiIus. We are in distress.

250
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,476
Before we proceed,
please encrypt

251
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,019
this transmission using

252
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,147
security protocoI 27-46-32.

253
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,025
- What are you doing?
- If it's a hoax, they'II pIay aIong.

254
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,944
- How can you be so sure?
- Because that's what I wouId do.

255
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,989
Victoria: There's no such protocoI.
Who exactIy am I speaking with?

256
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,616
Give me that.

257
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:35,994
This is Christopher Weaver
and Brooke Adamson.

258
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,288
We're seniors
at North Bay University.

259
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:41,917
You've managed to connect
with our pirate radio station.

260
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,633
Victoria, do you copy that?

261
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,052
Come in.

262
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,180
- What happened?
- We gotta get that signaI back.

263
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,433
Let's go to the car.
We'II try new batteries.

264
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,940
Before my teIescope went off-Iine,
l was able to pull these images.

265
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,859
Look at these sun-spots.
They're starting to disappear here,

266
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,405
and here, here, and here.

267
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,116
- What does that mean?
- Magnetism.

268
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,618
It aII makes sense now.

269
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,248
For one brief miIIisecond,

270
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,750
our humbIe IittIe sun
became a magnetar,

271
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:26,586
the most powerful source
of magnetic energy in the universe.

272
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,799
A magnetar?

273
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,927
Yeah, it's extremeIy rare,

274
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,429
but it's the onIy thing
that could explain it.

275
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,849
The sun-spots, the bIackouts,
the magnetic wave, everything.

276
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,727
- ( Ioud thud )
- What was that?

277
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,535
Whoa.

278
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,289
This shouId not be happening.

279
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,999
There's no way our database
could have missed

280
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,209
this many meteors
approaching Earth.

281
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,381
Buddy,
either you're wrong

282
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,550
- or that's not a meteor.
- ( Ioud boom )

283
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,221
That impact site can't be
more than a miIe or two, tops.

284
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,810
Let's take my car. I don't want
to have to ride on your handIebars.

285
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,188
Very funny.

286
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,693
- Get in the car.
- I enjoy riding my bike to work.

287
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,196
- It's something that I Iike to do.
- Get in the car.

288
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,577
Uh, this is not good.

289
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,829
Do you know
where we are yet?

290
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,706
No.

291
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,584
But we're acceIerating

292
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,919
without engine power.

293
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,425
Well, you check autopilot and see
if there's been any faIse commands

294
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,594
and I'II see what I can do.

295
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,057
Yes, ma'am.

296
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,936
Wow.

297
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,647
Something's definiteIy wrong.

298
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,650
( expIosions )

299
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,329
- There's stiII no signaI.
- I don't know.

300
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,289
Do you think that
was reaIIy the NautiIus?

301
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,084
Yeah, I do.
I do.

302
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:32,796
- ( gasps )
- Whoa!

303
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:36,132
- What the heII was that?
- l don't know,

304
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,134
but there's more coming.
Get in the car.

305
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,178
Get in the car!

306
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,180
- ( expIosions continue )
- James?

307
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,683
Run. Run!

308
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,236
Get down!

309
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,871
Oh, boy.

310
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,635
Is it over?

311
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,429
I think so.

312
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:24,598
What the heII happened?

313
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,396
( sizzIing )

314
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,955
Matthew: Whoa.

315
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,090
Computer:
Navigation systems initiaIizing.

316
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,803
- ( beeps )
- FIight path compromised.

317
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,433
MarshaII, I've checked everything.
l can't find anything wrong.

318
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,101
Get up here.
I need your heIp with navigation.

319
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,229
We need to figure out
where we're headed now.

320
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,952
- And we are back up.
- Computer: PIotting NautiIus Iocation.

321
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,121
- MarshaII: Wait, this can't be right.
- What is it?

322
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,290
We're not where we shouId be.

323
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,338
Neither is Mercury.

324
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,675
How is that possibIe?

325
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,843
Marshall:
I don't know. It's out of orbit.

326
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,347
No. We're acceIerating
towards the pIanet.

327
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,059
Mercury is dragging us in?

328
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,228
But we're not cIose enough
to be in its gravity.

329
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,063
Whatever it is,
I don't want to be any cIoser.

330
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,650
Computer:
Reverse thrusters engaged.

331
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,366
Victoria, we need
to get a hoId of Mission Ops.

332
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,284
Right.

333
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,448
Okay.

334
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,533
Maybe.

335
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,994
- ( static hissing )
- Ground, do you copy?

336
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:52,620
Can you hear me?

337
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,000
Ground, this is Victoria.
Do you copy?

338
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,462
Thrusters are at 70%.
I don't Iike this.

339
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,383
- ( static hissing )
- Ground, this is Victoria. Do you copy?

340
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,554
- Yeah, Victoria. We're here.
- Oh, thank God.

341
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,391
I need you to get in touch
with Mission ControI. It's urgent.

342
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,769
WeII, if you're trying to warn us
about meteors,

343
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,147
- you're a IittIe Iate for that.
- Christopher, the NautiIus

344
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,941
has been knocked off course.
I need Mission Ops to guide us.

345
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,110
MarshaII: Come on.
( grunts )

346
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,407
Mission Ops is in Houston.
We're in Oregon and the phones are down.

347
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,701
Oregon, okay.

348
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:35,371
I need you to get to a faciIity
south of SeattIe caIIed SPEAR.

349
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,416
SPEAR. l know that.
My cousin Iives nearby.

350
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,628
Okay, great. When you get there,
ask for a person named Jennifer KeIIy.

351
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,339
TeII her what I've toId you,
that we need Mission Ops

352
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:47,050
to guide NautiIus, and give her
this frequency to get in touch.

353
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:51,054
And, please,
our Iives depend on it.

354
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,722
We're on it.
Let's go.

355
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,484
It has an extremeIy high
iron content.

356
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:07,987
Way too high for
an ordinary piece of meteorite.

357
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,658
This might sound crazy,
but I think this is a piece of Mercury.

358
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,210
It's a magnetized piece
of Mercury.

359
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,214
lf it was hit
by the magnetar wave,

360
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,757
that wouId expIain
why it's magnetic.

361
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,884
Even so,

362
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,053
how are pieces of it
down here?

363
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,307
I don't know.

364
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:51,072
- ( beeping )
- Thrusters are at maximum.

365
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,534
- We're stiII being puIIed in.
- I can do a manuaI override

366
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,327
in the engine room
to boost the thrusters,

367
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,705
but it's a temporary fix at best.

368
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,665
- Do it!
- Got it!

369
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,466
This is weird.

370
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,719
You want to read me
those coordinates again?

371
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,430
Yeah. Uh...

372
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,223
- right ascension...
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,143
- ...13 hours...
- Mm-hmm.

374
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,978
- ...17 minutes.
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,354
- DecIination...
- Yeah.

376
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,440
..negative-7 degrees...

377
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,610
- Yeah.
- ...2 arcminutes.

378
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,654
It's not there.

379
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,034
What are you taIking about?

380
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:37,827
- It's not there.
- Where is it?

381
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,871
l don't know.
It's just-- it's gone.

382
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,707
- Do you mind?
- lt's just gone.

383
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,375
Okay.

384
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,420
They were right there.

385
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,343
Mercury was right--

386
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,727
they were right there.

387
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,483
All right, that--
that's impossibIe.

388
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,695
A pIanet doesn't just move.

389
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,407
What are you gonna do?

390
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,664
I'm gonna get some answers.

391
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,466
MarshaII, I got you another 20% ,

392
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,885
but that's the best I couId do.

393
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:37,845
Let's hope it's enough.

394
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,693
There's not enough power
in the reverse thrusters.

395
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,571
l need to flip us around
and engage the main engine.

396
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,283
That's too risky.
We can't use the reverse thrusters

397
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,244
and turn the ship at the same time.
We'd be puIIed in immediateIy.

398
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,497
- Not if we do it fast enough.
- We?

399
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,582
It's a two-man job, Victoria.

400
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,419
But I'm not a piIot.

401
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,587
WeIcome to your promotion.

402
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:21,681
Victoria, reduce power by 20%
when I boost the main engines.

403
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,474
Copy that.

404
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,601
Now!

405
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,770
Reducing power.

406
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,321
We're being
puIIed in sideways.

407
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,160
Marshall?
MarshaII?!

408
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,001
( growIs )

409
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,765
Maneuver successfuIIy executed.

410
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,815
Okay, I need you
to take over for a whiIe.

411
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,942
What's wrong?

412
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,405
What's the matter?

413
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,866
I think I might have got hit hard--

414
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,703
MarshaII!

415
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,006
Yes?

416
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,633
We need to see
Jennifer KeIIy right away.

417
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,885
- And you are?
- We have an urgent message

418
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,054
from Victoria Preston
and the NautiIus spacecraft.

419
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,806
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

420
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,808
- So if you couId just pIease--
- Excuse me, sir,

421
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,602
the NautiIus is having
severe mechanicaI maIfunctions

422
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,937
and they can't
get a hoId of Mission Ops,

423
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:52,647
but they can
get a hoId of my radio.

424
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,775
- We were sent here to see Jennifer--
- This is a secure facility.

425
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,194
No one gets in without
an appointment or a pass.

426
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,571
- Yeah, I understand that, but--
- That was me teIIing you niceIy.

427
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,575
Don't make me teII you again.
Let's go.

428
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,160
- Great.
- Guard: Let's go.

429
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,971
( ship creaking )

430
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:41,529
James, I know what must be
going through your head right now.

431
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,866
Then you'II stop
the small talk.

432
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,870
It's just we don't know
anything for sure yet.

433
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,248
There's a very good chance
that she's alive.

434
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,501
Mercury didn't disappear.
It was knocked out of orbit.

435
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:58,254
- I tracked its gravity--
- And my wife...

436
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,674
probabIy shouId be waIking
on Mercury right now.

437
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:05,595
Now pieces of it
are Ianding on the Earth.

438
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,890
You understand?

439
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,344
They didn't beIieve us.

440
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,930
- The guard wouIdn't even caII Jennifer.
- Fascist.

441
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,098
What shouId we do now?

442
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:04,028
Find my husband,
Dr. James Preston.

443
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:07,114
He'II be at our home
in Pacific Grove.

444
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,284
433 Ocean Beach Drive.

445
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,039
Come on, James.

446
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,838
Look, I don't care if your faciIity's
on lockdown, okay?

447
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,800
Try her number again
'cause I need to taIk to her.

448
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,803
- Sir, you need to caIm down.
- Oh, I need to caIm down?

449
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:30,763
I used to work here, okay?
l can't call her

450
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,432
because my phone doesn't work.
lt's urgent.

451
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:36,936
Stand down.

452
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,815
James, you need to leave.
You know you can't be here.

453
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,775
l can't share
cIassified information with you.

454
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:45,945
What about Mercury?
ls that classified?

455
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,824
- Look, we know aII about Mercury.
- Do you?

456
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:53,327
Do you aIso know
it's magnetized?

457
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,833
He's with me.

458
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,836
You, stay there.

459
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,925
( woman speaking over P.A. )

460
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,225
- What the heII is he doing here?
- Show him.

461
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,864
Nice trick.
So what?

462
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:33,701
This thing,
this was attached to Mercury.

463
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,962
You have to recaIcuIate
the planet's trajectory

464
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,006
based on magnetism.

465
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,968
What exactly
are you trying to teII me?

466
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,513
Massive magnetar wave
hit Mercury.

467
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,016
lt is now
extremeIy magnetized.

468
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,684
If it's anywhere near Earth,

469
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,062
it'II Iock on to our magnetic fieId--

470
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,982
it'II come straight for us.

471
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,570
WeII, we've tracked its trajectory,

472
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,989
and whiIe it is headed our way,

473
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:15,534
we're comfortabIy certain
that it will miss us.

474
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,412
You're not factoring in
the magnetism.

475
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,498
You have to recaIcuIate.

476
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,385
Based on our new data,
the caIcuIations show

477
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,346
the trajectory has changed.

478
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,682
Oh, my God.

479
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,725
Mercury's on
a coIIision course with Earth.

480
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,143
Look at the distance
it's covered.

481
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,939
- lt's moving faster.
- It's Iocked on to us.

482
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,732
Earth's magnetic fieId
is drawing it in.

483
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,442
It's Iike two magnets
puIIing it together.

484
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,820
This is beyond
an extinction IeveI event.

485
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,365
- This is the end of the worId.
- How Iong have we got?

486
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,581
Just over 18 hours.

487
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:07,044
Okay, people, this is why
we have a contingency pIan.

488
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:11,006
Initiate Operation Recourse.
I wanna be onIine in 30 minutes.

489
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,175
Jennifer: Yes, sir.

490
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,971
Edward...

491
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,181
Operation Recourse won't work.

492
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,602
Your missiIes aren't strong enough
to stop a planet.

493
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,022
We are not trying
to stop Mercury.

494
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,774
We're gonna defIect it.

495
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,444
The missiIes wiII cause
coordinated standoff expIosions

496
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,029
in front of the pIanet
and drive it off course.

497
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,115
l already know
what your pIan is.

498
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,159
You're assuming
that your guidance system

499
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,202
will withstand
a magnetic interference

500
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,122
and synchronize the bIast.

501
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,790
They can go off course.

502
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,417
They couId expIode
before they get there.

503
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,086
Worse, they get sucked back
into the planet,

504
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,089
they bIow it to fragments,
they wipe us out anyway!

505
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,551
Our missiles
are properIy shieIded.

506
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,763
Not against this.

507
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,391
Going ahead with this Iaunch,

508
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,561
you're choosing suicide
over a firing squad.

509
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,901
Your sarcasm
is reaIIy better suited

510
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,986
to your community
college lectures.

511
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,822
You don't have a say
in what we do here.

512
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,496
We Iaunch as soon as Mercury
is within our firing range.

513
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,666
( technicians murmuring )

514
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,053
James:
Edward, Edward, Iisten.

515
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,513
What about Project 7?

516
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,473
This is exactIy
what it was designed for.

517
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,851
The defIector never worked
in fieId testing, not once.

518
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,771
Without that,
it's just a big rock with engines.

519
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,941
We've been modifying the software,
we've been working out the bugs.

520
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,527
You pulled it so you
can give your contracts

521
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,612
to your rocket
manufacturing buddies.

522
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,240
WeII, if that's the way you want to see
your faiIure, that's your business,

523
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,700
but, regardIess,
we don't have time to dust it off now.

524
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,203
I can get
the defIector fieId to work.

525
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,957
l've been uploading
the software since I Ieft.

526
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,167
l'm sorry.
You've been doing what?

527
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,379
- Hacking into a government weapon?
- That's my weapon.

528
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,590
lt hasn't been your weapon
since I fired you three years ago.

529
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,386
I couId have you thrown
in prison for this.

530
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,471
It'II work.

531
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:27,935
Just gotta Iet me
upIoad the fixes.

532
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:29,687
We don't have the time

533
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,064
or resources
to Iaunch two programs.

534
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,900
We're onIy gonna get
one shot at this...

535
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,237
and I am not gonna risk
the fate of humanity

536
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:40,072
on your unproven technoIogy.

537
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,659
I think you know
the way out.

538
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,828
Okay.

539
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:52,960
- Chris: Wait.
- ( tires screech )

540
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,463
- Which way?
- I don't know.

541
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,257
Is this North Coast Road?

542
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,050
l don't know.
There's no road signs.

543
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,844
Let's try this way.

544
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,071
And you're sure P-7 is the key
to stopping Mercury?

545
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,198
- Stake my life on it.
- Sounds Iike you'II be staking

546
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,826
- everyone's life on it, James.
- My software updates wiII work.

547
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,370
We just need to upIoad them
to get P-7 fully online.

548
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,832
- That sounds easy enough.
- We just need to go to my office,

549
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,210
get the software, then we need
a secure SPEAR computer.

550
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,880
Did you say we?

551
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,456
HeIIo?
Mr. Preston?

552
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,418
- ( tires screeching )
- ( rumbling )

553
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,381
Whoa.

554
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,551
- Hey, hey, keep the car straight.
- lt's not me.

555
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,305
It's the ground that's moving.

556
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,101
Whoa.

557
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,526
Oh, my God.

558
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,327
( car horns honking )

559
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,806
( car aIarms bIaring )

560
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,937
- It's metaI.
- What?

561
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,189
lt's not trees,
it's not teIephone poIes.

562
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,444
Whatever that is,
it onIy affected metaI.

563
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,366
This must aII be
connected to Mercury.

564
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,952
It has to be.

565
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,169
Jennifer: That's not good.
That's not good at all.

566
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,422
We've just received report--
SeattIe's been devastated

567
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,549
by a massive magnetic event.

568
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,970
- How far are we from Iaunching?
- We've had to recalculate.

569
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,806
Mercury's speeding up and we're having
a hard time keeping a lock on it.

570
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,892
We have a very smaII window
to launch these missiles

571
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,810
and we're running
out of time.

572
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,939
What happened
to your security pass?

573
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,071
- Find Preston.
- Yes, sir.

574
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,158
- Just follow me.
- ( distant dog barking )

575
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,414
Oh, wait.
I read on the Internet somewhere

576
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,292
that you can open up any door
with a credit card.

577
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:25,464
I think, eh,
yeah, you just--

578
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,467
I don't know.

579
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,472
PeopIe never Ieave
these things Iocked.

580
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,474
Right.

581
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:38,310
Mr. Preston?

582
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,355
Is anyone home?

583
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,401
HeIIo?

584
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,156
Hey, come here.

585
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,577
God, the phones
stiII aren't working.

586
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:01,416
There's nothing here.
Nothing usefuI anyways.

587
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,460
( Iights buzzing )

588
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,629
( computer, modem
beeping and buzzing )

589
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,803
- What is that?
- I don't know.

590
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,473
Looks Iike some kind of weapon.

591
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,277
Whose car is that?

592
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:36,451
What kind of guy keeps pIans
for a top secret weapon on his computer?

593
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,496
Brooke: If he were here right now,
I'd give him a piece of my mind.

594
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,125
What the hell
are you doing in my house?

595
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,419
- Look, your wife sent us.
- What are you taIking about?

596
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:47,504
We taIked to her.
She's in trouble.

597
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,131
- Brooke: We can prove it.
- Yeah.

598
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,425
What?

599
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,177
WeII, it's just over there.

600
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,053
PIease?

601
00:41:57,432 --> 00:42:01,018
So l used
some of today's engineering

602
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,520
with yesterday's
anaIog technoIogy

603
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:07,691
with a few experimentaI bits
here and there and voiIà.

604
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,612
lt broadcasts and receives
farther than you can imagine.

605
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,491
WeII, it's a work of art.

606
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,536
lt's how we heard
Victoria's mayday.

607
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,252
- You wanna turn it on?
- Yeah, sorry.

608
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,131
( static hissing )

609
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,350
Okay.
Yeah, cooI.

610
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,857
Vic, you there?

611
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,906
Victoria?

612
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,035
Victoria:
Ground, can you pIease repeat?

613
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,623
Vic, it's me.
Um...

614
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,586
- you safe?
- I'm aIive,

615
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:11,713
but I'm the onIy one Ieft.

616
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,678
James: What happened?
Are you okay?

617
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,223
Something crazy has happened
and l can't really explain it,

618
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:24,101
but I'm being puIIed
into Mercury.

619
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,687
Oh, my God,
the magnetism.

620
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:32,025
Vic, there's been
a huge magnetic event.

621
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:35,195
Yes, l know.
We were right in the middIe of it.

622
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:39,366
Mercury's been magnetized
and is being pushed out of its orbit.

623
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,745
Magnetism.
Why didn't I think of this?

624
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:45,789
Okay,
if I can recaIcuIate,

625
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,166
if l can account
for the difference in force,

626
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,919
I might be abIe to break free
and come home.

627
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,757
Vic, there might not be a home
to come back to.

628
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,722
Mercury's on
a coIIision course with Earth.

629
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:14,693
Can you keep me posted on this
and just double-check these?

630
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:16,528
Woman:
I just Iost everything.

631
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,613
What is going on?

632
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,741
This faciIity shouId be impervious
to power surges.

633
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,409
Mercury's interference
is increasing.

634
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,953
It's becoming more
than our shieIding can handIe.

635
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,664
Get the emergency generators
back online.

636
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:31,293
The moment they stabilize,
I want those missiIes in the air!

637
00:44:31,461 --> 00:44:33,128
Edward,
what if James is right?

638
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,675
Move aside.

639
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:43,764
Project 7 is the only thing
that can save us from Mercury.

640
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,640
You need to get the heII
out of there before we Iaunch.

641
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,809
Victoria:
Okay, I've done everything I can

642
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:49,770
to recaIcuIate
for the change in force.

643
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,980
I've tried to boost the engines
as much as possible,

644
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:55,025
but it's just not enough thrust.

645
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:03,825
Wait a minute.
What if I Iet it puII me in?

646
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,081
- What do you mean?
- A sIingshot maneuver.

647
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:14,503
Yes, yes, yes.
She Iets the pIanet puII her in,

648
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,547
acceIerating around Mercury.
That wiII give her the extra momentum

649
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,300
she needs to break free.

650
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,427
That's a suicide mission.

651
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:26,056
- Magnetism is too unpredictable.
- Victoria: I've been trained for this.

652
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,602
Honey, honey.

653
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,397
You're not a piIot.
You've never done this before.

654
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,775
I have to try.
If I stay here, I'm dead.

655
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,985
It's my onIy chance.

656
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,490
No, no, no, no.

657
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:46,118
Vic?
Vic?!

658
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,495
- James, can you hear me?
- ( static hissing )

659
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,330
Sorry, it's fragiIe.

660
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:52,916
lt wasn't built
to be dragged around Iike this.

661
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:02,843
- Can you hear me?
- ( static hissing )

662
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:20,569
- Disengage autopilot.
- Computer: AutopiIot disengaged.

663
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,740
Here goes nothing.

664
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:32,456
- She'II make it, she'II make it.
- ( modem screeching )

665
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,083
She's gonna make it.
She's gonna be aII right.

666
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,587
What is that?

667
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,886
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- What's wrong?

668
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,681
Project 7's guidance systems
are damaged.

669
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,808
- Can't you fix it?
- It's not a software probIem,

670
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,519
it's hardware.
You can't fix it from the ground.

671
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,608
- So that's it?
- Um, the NautiIus.

672
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,277
The NautiIus has
an amazing guidance system.

673
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:05,155
If Victoria can piIot the ship
to Project 7,

674
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,823
tether onto its system,

675
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:10,285
we can then use it to manuaIIy guide
the asteroid straight into Mercury.

676
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,037
We stiII have to do
the software updates.

677
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:13,914
Without the energy fieId,
you won't have enough force

678
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,665
to knock Mercury off course.

679
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,876
- So send them.
- I can't do it from here.

680
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,836
Can monitor the systems,

681
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,338
but to change anything,
I need a computer

682
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,590
that has top-level
cIassified access.

683
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:25,800
- And you need to fix that radio.
- ( electricity buzzing )

684
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,844
That's another power surge.

685
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:34,976
- ( buzzes )
- Come on.

686
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,937
Come on,
come on, come on.

687
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,787
Here we go,
here we go.

688
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,374
- ( beeps )
- l got it.

689
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:00,794
Whoa.

690
00:48:00,962 --> 00:48:03,964
Yes, Mr. President. Believe me,
we're doing everything we can.

691
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,801
No, sir. These are
Iimited range missiIes.

692
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:09,886
The timing is cruciaI.

693
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,180
If we Iaunch too earIy
the missiIes wiII faII short,

694
00:48:12,348 --> 00:48:15,892
too late, and Mercury won't be
knocked off course enough to miss Earth.

695
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,644
( feedback )

696
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,729
- Mr. President, are you there?
- ( dial tone )

697
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,898
Mr. President?

698
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,873
- I'm gonna need a new reIay.
- There's an oId airstrip.

699
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,834
One of the radio planes
might have what you need.

700
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:42,419
Right, I saw it on the way in.

701
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,963
Here, once we get the radio up
and running, we'II caII you on it.

702
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,882
Okay. Is this even gonna work
with all the interference?

703
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,052
Trust me, we reached Mercury
with this thing. lt'll work.

704
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,680
You gonna tell me
where we're going?

705
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,098
The faIIback faciIity.

706
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,767
- Which is what exactIy?
- Designed when I was working at SPEAR.

707
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,811
They shouId have access
to every weapon,

708
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,856
- incIuding Project 7.
- ShouId have access?

709
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,733
The coordinates
are in records storage.

710
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,402
- We don't even know where it is?
- That's why we're hurrying.

711
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,514
HeIIo?

712
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,559
Anybody here?

713
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,187
If we're gonna find
that reIay switch,

714
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:45,565
- we better start looking for it.
- I don't know. This pIace is creepy.

715
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,942
- l don't like it.
- It's a creepy oId airstrip.

716
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,987
What did you expect?

717
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,281
- Here, this Iooks Iike the hangar.
- Okay.

718
00:49:58,204 --> 00:49:59,704
HeIIo?

719
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,791
- I think this is the hangar.
- Okay.

720
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,168
- Let's check the yard here.
- Okay.

721
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:09,798
- Anything?
- No.

722
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,800
- Here.
- What exactIy are we Iooking for?

723
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,052
We're Iooking for a radio
that's stiII intact.

724
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,221
Okay.

725
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,484
No, these are aII sheIIs.

726
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,653
- We need to get to that hangar.
- Okay.

727
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,662
Hey.

728
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,047
( rumbIing )

729
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,967
- Quick.
- What's happening?

730
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:56,928
- I don't know.
- Is it more meteors?

731
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:58,888
l don't think so.
It feeIs more Iike an earthquake.

732
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:02,225
- Earthquake?
- Worse, we're being hit by

733
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,310


massive waves
of eIectromagnetic energy.

734
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,104
We still can't risk
Iaunching too earIy.

735
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,856
If this EM interference
increases,

736
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,107
you won't be abIe
to Iaunch the missiIes.

737
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,234
You can't fire
when the interference is spiking.

738
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:14,070
Okay, then caIcuIate intervaIs
in between the wavelengths

739
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,364
- and we'II fire in between.
- Yes, sir.

740
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,536
- Is it over?
- I think so.

741
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,956
Okay, maybe this plane
wiII have what we need.

742
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:27,041
Let's find out.

743
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:30,170
Computer:
Trajectory caIcuIations compIete.

744
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:34,132
- ( beeping )
- Warning,

745
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,092
possible

746
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,887
Recommend
repIotting trajectory.

747
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:59,741
Project 7.
Stupid.

748
00:51:59,909 --> 00:52:01,743
What were
Projects 1 through 6?

749
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,954
I don't even want to know.

750
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,168
- Any luck?
- I think I got it.

751
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,092
- ( static hissing )
- Yes.

752
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,805
We're in business.
Okay, Iet's get out of here.

753
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,973
Okay.

754
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,270
Stop where you are
or I'II drop you where you stand.

755
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,148
What the heII are you doing
with my pIane?

756
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,360
- Sir--
- Shut up!

757
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:38,029
Here's what's gonna happen.

758
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:41,699
You're gonna drop that,
you're just gonna--

759
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,661
you're gonna slowly
put that down on the ground.

760
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,955
- Yeah.
- And you're gonna put

761
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,498
- your hands in the air.
- Right, okay.

762
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,208
Sir, we needed one part.

763
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:52,752
We've been communicating
with the spacecraft NautiIus.

764
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,462
Sure, you have.
Hands in the air now!

765
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,382
Brooke: You don't understand.
This is a matter of Iife and death.

766
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,760
- We can't leave without that radio.
- You're gonna Ieave without the radio

767
00:53:00,928 --> 00:53:03,805
because it's my radio.

768
00:53:03,973 --> 00:53:06,057
You know what I mean?

769
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:08,226
It's my radio.

770
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,400
Hurry!
Go, go!

771
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,611
Say your prayers,
you little bastard!

772
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:27,495
How are we
supposed to get inside?

773
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,664
There's no way
to sneak around that guard.

774
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,550
- How'd you get that?
- I borrowed it.

775
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,803
- Nice.
- Yeah.

776
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,228
- Morning.
- Hi there.

777
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,355
Hey,
stop right there.

778
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,235
Gonna need to see
that lD again, sir.

779
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:02,113
Yeah, here you go.
Here you go.

780
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,591
G-g-g-g-gun!

781
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,177
Get the gun!
Get the gun!

782
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,263
- ( gunshots )
- Help, help!

783
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,645
( screams )

784
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,111
- ( gunshots )
- Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey.

785
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,281
- Ow!
- Back it up. Over there, over there.

786
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:48,201
Sorry about that.
You okay?

787
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:49,577
- Yeah.
- Over there, over there, over there.

788
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,204
What do we do?
What do we do now?

789
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:52,872
- Give me the gun.
- Okay, huh?

790
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,583
Just give me the gun.

791
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:58,461
Hey, hey, hey!
Back up!

792
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,255
Back up!

793
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,675
Okay, there's rope in the car.

794
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,843
Go get the rope.

795
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:09,514
- Keys.
- The car is open!

796
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,484
- Whoa! Get down!
- ( screams )

797
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,445
Get down,
get down!

798
00:55:28,117 --> 00:55:29,450
Wait, can you just--

799
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,373
Come on,
let's go!

800
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,840
- You okay?
- Yeah.

801
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,892
Okay, he's reloading.
Come on, come on, Iet's go.

802
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,061
Go, go, go!

803
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,319
( metaI creaking )

804
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:08,031
What?

805
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,332
Brooke:
Oh, God.

806
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,793
We need to get out of here now.

807
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,340
- Brooke, come on!
- l'm coming!

808
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,428
( Iow rumbIing )

809
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:35,516
Let's go, go, go!

810
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,313
Brooke:
I'm hurrying!

811
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,523
( tires screeching )

812
00:56:55,204 --> 00:56:56,537
Matthew: Whoa.

813
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:59,332
So, uh, where do we start?

814
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,375
Hang on, these-- aren't fiIe cabinets

815
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,294
supposed to have Ietters on them?

816
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:08,299
Secret codes, secret fiIes,

817
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,384
they get bar codes.

818
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,931
So how are we supposed to
find the one we're Iooking for?

819
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,060
You take that side,
I'II take this side.

820
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,270
- Okay, aII right.
- Just Iook for things

821
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,649
that have structures, buiIdings,
things grouped together.

822
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:26,818
- Stuff Iike that.
- Okay.

823
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,032
- Matthew?
- Yes.

824
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,409
- You don't have to be neat.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, well.

825
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,453
Fast.

826
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:39,497
Just want to keep
some sembIance of organization.

827
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,374
This took somebody
a Iong time.

828
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:45,086
Computer: Warning, pIanetary gravity

829
00:57:45,254 --> 00:57:47,588
That's the pIan, girI.

Impact risk imminent.

834
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,832
I think I got it.

835
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,432
Down on the ground now!

836
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,186
Where's your buddy?

837
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,815
Oh, about time.

838
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:50,818
Where's the fiIe?

839
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,448
Next time,
I'II tie him up.

840
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:58,409
I'm sorry, they don't teach you how
to tie peopIe up in astronomy schooI.

841
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,828
I stiII saved your butt.

842
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,547
- Brooke?
- Brooke: Go ahead, James.

843
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,299
I have the Iocation.

844
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,218
Where shouId we meet you?

845
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,388
Take Highway 37.

846
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,475
We'II meet you
at the junction at Highway 12.

847
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:25,645
- Brooke: Okay.
- Oh, and I picked this up for Iater.

848
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,064
Figured we might need it.

849
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,694
- You want a hug?
- Yeah, yeah, I wouId.

850
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,408
l need those wave calculations.
We're approaching the Iaunch window.

851
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,495
We're working on it.
We just got systems back up.

852
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:46,332
- We're running out of time.
- l know the time table!

853
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,501
Sir.

854
00:59:50,963 --> 00:59:54,090
Look, Jen,

855
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,508
get a team ready

856
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:58,386
and take them
over to the faIIback faciIity.

857
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,680
We gotta cover our bases.
If the systems go down here,

858
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,348
l'm not gonna
be abIe to Iaunch.

859
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,142
I need you over there
to Iaunch from there.

860
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,062
I'II get you the Iaunch codes.

861
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,315
Michelle, please stay
on those waveIengths.

862
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:12,858
MicheIIe: Yes, sir.

863
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,991
Matthew: Whoa, stop. Stop the car.
He looks like he's alive.

864
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:23,369
- James: We don't have time for this.
- We can't just Ieave him here.

865
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,830
- Matthew, get back in the car.
- We can't leave him here.

866
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:31,502
- Matthew, get back in the car!
- ( man groaning )

867
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:34,630
It'II be fine.

868
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,304
- Oh, come on.
- Hey, buddy. You okay?

869
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:45,099
We gotta get you--
we gotta get you--

870
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:49,770
- Get up, nice and sIow.
- Hey.

871
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,607
- Easy.
- Step away from the car!

872
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,193
- Step away from the car!
- Take it easy, man.

873
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,611
Just take it easy.
Don't do it, James!

874
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,031
Shut up!
You think I'm kidding around?

875
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,407
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Huh?!

876
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,117
- Easy, easy.
- Get the heII away from the car!

877
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:05,870
- Buddy, I can't give you the keys.
- Shut up!

878
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:08,039
- I can't give you the keys!
- Don't be stupid, man!

879
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,666
- I'II cut his throat!
- I can't give you the car.

880
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,835
Oh, you're gonna
give me the car.

881
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,630
- Hey!
- What's this, huh?

882
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,591
What are you doing?

883
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:20,634
What's this, huh?

884
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,762
- Okay, okay, okay!
- The keys!

885
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,722
- I'm gonna give you the keys.
- Yeah, you wiII.

886
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:25,806
- I'II give you the keys.
- Give me the keys.

887
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:27,767
That's good.

888
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:34,273
- Don't move.
- Dude.

889
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,953
We need to caII the kids.

890
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:55,044
The radio's in the car.

891
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:02,927
It's happening again.

892
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,241

893
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,829

Where's Matthew?

904
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,941
- You get the part?
- Yeah, but we haven't heard anything

905
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,401
from Victoria yet.

906
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,570
Let's hope she's in the middIe
of the maneuver.

907
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,822
We gotta get out of here.
Go!

908
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,455

We'II never get through here.

919
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:28,382
We gotta back up.

920
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,926
We gotta find another way.

921
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:39,393
- All right.
- ( engine chokes )

922
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,354
- Damn it.
- You're kidding me.

923
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:48,027
Okay, we are go for Iaunch.

AIternator's shot.

928
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:19,975
What are we gonna do?

929
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,811
How are we supposed to
get around this thing?

930
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,813
Guess we have to waIk.

931
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,910
- What are you doing?
- What?

932
01:06:38,078 --> 01:06:40,204
I've aIready been shot at
once today.

933
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,959
( rumbIing )

934
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,860
This thing goes on
for miIes.

935
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,487
Yeah, James.

936
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:16,156
At this rate, I don't think
we're gonna make it on time.

937
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,830
Magnetism is increasing.

938
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:26,709
Mercury is forcing
the missiIes off course.

939
01:07:39,431 --> 01:07:42,433
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
lt's leaking gas.

940
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,936

942
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,912
No.

943
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:11,044
James?
James, can you hear me?

944
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:13,839
- James.
- Victoria: James?

945
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,467
( static hissing )

946
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,010
- Okay, go.
- Hey, Vic.

947
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:21,847
- It's me.
- Thank God.

948
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,099
- Are you safe?
- I am,

949
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,185
and l'm heading away
from Mercury as fast as I can.

950
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:30,147
Have you Iaunched P-7 yet?

951
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:35,110
We can't.

952
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,571
Guidance system's
been damaged.

953
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:41,116
Hey, honey?
I, uh--

954
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:45,037
I need you
to do something.

955
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:48,957
I don't want to ask you
to do this,

956
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,836
but I need you to take
the NautiIus to Project 7

957
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:57,132
and you have to guide it
to Mercury.

958
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:02,429
I guess I won't be going home
as fast as l thought.

959
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,140
It's the onIy chance
we have, honey.

960
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:09,228
I'II do it.

961
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,230
Now Iisten to me.

962
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:15,192
You have to tether in
the NautiIus guidance system to P-7's.

963
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,237
I understand, James.

964
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:21,323
Now we stiII have to
do the fixes to P-7.

965
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:24,326
We have to do that
at the faciIity.

966
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,621
There's really
not that much time.

967
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,667
I'II get there in time.

968
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,503

( banging )

1018
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:44,771
- Everybody all right?
- Better than the car, I guess.

1019
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,067
Brooke?
Brooke?

1020
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:52,654

James,
she's not breathing, man.

1024
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,631
I'm sorry.

1025
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,884

Brooke, I'm so sorry.

1028
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:27,647
Christopher, we gotta go.

1029
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:30,483
No.

1030
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,736
- Christopher.
- Just wait!

1031
01:15:32,904 --> 01:15:34,905
Brooke.

1032
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:46,791
I'm sorry.

1033
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,389
Wow.

1034
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,770
SPEAR car.

1035
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:13,526
It's Jennifer.

1036
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:31,378
We're close.
We gotta get out of here.

1037
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,595
Executing Ianding procedure.

1038
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:43,515
Prepare to tether
NautiIus' navigation system

1039
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:46,601

1044
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,630
System tether executed.

1045
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:20,260
James, can you hear me?

1046
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:23,638
I don't see a faciIity. Are you sure
we got the right coordinates?

1047
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:26,725
Yeah, we're here.
The dam is camoufIage.

1048
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:29,936
It's aIso the power source
for the faciIity.

1049
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:32,105
Wow.

1050
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,739
- Victoria: James, can you hear me?
- Okay.

1051
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,699

- Here.

1052
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:44,743
- Vic, are you aII right?
- Yes,

1053
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:46,578
and I'm tethered
to Project 7's systems.

1054
01:17:46,746 --> 01:17:48,705
As soon as I get the updates,
l'm ready to launch.

1055
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:51,124
You have to check
the targeting systems.

1056
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:54,794
It'II automaticaIIy be scanning
an impact threat the size of Mercury.

1057
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:58,298
Oh, no.

1058
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:01,676
- What's the Iaunch window?
- If I don't get Project 7 moving,

1059
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,220
l'll never close
the gap to Mercury.

1060
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,806
Without the updates,
the shieId won't work.

1061
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,019
- Then you better hurry.
- We gotta go.

1062
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:19,986
Engaging main engines.

1063
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:31,873

1066
01:18:47,515 --> 01:18:49,265
We gotta move!

1067
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,899
We're aImost there.

- Whoa!

1073
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:30,348
- Where's the control room?
- It's directIy underneath the dam.

1074
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,684
It's the onIy pIace
safe enough.

1075
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,813
Increase engines
to maximum.

1076
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:48,158
What are we Iooking for?

1077
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:51,661
There it is!

Come on, James.

1086
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,838
What can l do?
What do you need?

1087
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:45,798
l'm gonna get
the system up and running.

1088
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,384

- Right.

1089
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:56,935

Good boy.

1093
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:11,866
Vic, it's updating right now.

1094
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:14,077
James, it's too Iate.

1095

Hey, don't give up on me!

1096
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:26,047
Hang in there, okay?

1097
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:30,802
We need to go!

1098
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:33,721

1099
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,890
Go, go!

1100
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:38,935
Victoria:
Listen to me.

1101
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:41,646
I Iove you.

1102
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:44,566
I Iove you, too.

About everything.

1123
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,006
Victoria knew
what she was doing.

1124
01:24:18,137 --> 01:24:20,430
lf it wasn't for her,
we wouIdn't be here, right?

1125
01:24:22,141 --> 01:24:24,308
None of us wouId.

1126
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:28,771
Try her.

James, do you read?

1135
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,712
- You made it.
- ( laughs )

1136
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,048
Looks Iike the worId did, too.

1137

Why don't you come on down

1138

Victoria:
I'm aIready on my way.

1140
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:01,489
