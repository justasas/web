1
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:23,942
We've become bored with watching
actors give us phony emotions.

2
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:28,405
We're tired of pyrotechnics
and special effects.

3
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:33,785
While the world he inhabits is,
in some respects, counterfeit,

4
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:37,664
there's nothing fake about
Truman himself.

5
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:40,959
No scripts, no cue cards.

6
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:44,796
It isn't always Shakespeare,
but it's genuine.

7
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:46,965
It's a life.

8
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:52,763
<i>I'm not going to make it.</i>

9
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:55,974
<i>You're going to have to go on
without me.</i>

10
00:01:01,313 --> 00:01:02,814
<i>No way, mister.</i>

11
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:07,486
<i>You're going to the top of this mountain,
broken legs and all.</i>

12
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,160
We find many viewers leave him on
all night for comfort.

13
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:19,164
<i>You're crazy, you know that?</i>

14
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:26,588
For me, there is no difference
between a private life and a public life.

15
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:30,008
My life, is my life, is <i>The Truman Show.</i>

16
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:32,427
<i>The Truman Show</i> is a lifestyle.

17
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:34,846
It's a noble life. It is

18
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:39,309
a truly blessed life.

19
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:42,020
<i>Yeah, tell me something I don't know.</i>

20
00:01:43,397 --> 00:01:46,149
<i>All right. Promise me one thing, though.</i>

21
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:49,444
<i>If I die before I reach the summit,</i>

22
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:53,490
<i>you'll use me
as an alternative source of food.</i>

23
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:55,659
<i>Gross.</i>

24
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:01,373
It's all true. It's all real.

25
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:05,294
Nothing here is fake.
Nothing you see on this show is fake.

26
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:07,045
It's merely controlled.

27
00:02:15,304 --> 00:02:18,265
Eat me, damn it. That's an order.

28
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,395
Maybe just your love handles.

29
00:02:24,313 --> 00:02:27,941
I have love handles? Yeah. Little ones.

30
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:30,694
Truman. You're going to be late.

31
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:32,946
Okay!

32
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,962
- Good morning.
- Morning.

33
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:50,213
Good morning.

34
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:54,593
In case I don't see you, good afternoon,
good evening, and good night.

35
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:56,845
Yeah.

36
00:02:56,928 --> 00:02:58,847
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer.

37
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,724
Hey, Pluto. No, get down.

38
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,559
- He won't hurt you.
- Get down.

39
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:04,186
I know.

40
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:06,563
- It's just me.
- Come on, Pluto.

41
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:30,128
What is it?

42
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:55,529
<i>Here's a news flash just in. An aircraft
in trouble began shedding parts</i>

43
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:58,698
<i>as it flew over Seahaven
just a few moments ago.</i>

44
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,492
<i>Luckily, no one was hurt.</i>

45
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:02,661
<i>But, hey, how do you feel today?</i>

46
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,080
<i>That's good.
You thinking of flying somewhere?</i>

47
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,706
- Nope.
<i>- No? Good.</i>

48
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,875
<i>This is Classical Clive
with Classical Drive</i>

49
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,294
<i>so why don't you forget
about the perils of flying,</i>

50
00:04:11,378 --> 00:04:14,381
<i>settle back,
and let this music calm you down?</i>

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,179
<i>- Dog Fancy,</i> please.
<i>- Dog Fancy.</i>

52
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:24,099
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

53
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,018
Give me a paper there, will you, Earl?

54
00:04:27,102 --> 00:04:30,063
And one of these for the wife.

55
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:31,940
Loves her fashion mags.

56
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:33,567
Will that be all for you, Truman?

57
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,027
- That's the whole kit and caboodle.
- Catch you later.

58
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:38,155
Okay. Yeah.

59
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:46,663
Good morning.

60
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:49,833
- Hank.
- Morning, Truman.

61
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,378
- Good morning, Truman.
- How are you guys?

62
00:04:53,462 --> 00:04:55,714
- Beautiful day, isn't it?
- Always.

63
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,424
And how's your lovely wife?

64
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,427
Good. How about yours?

65
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,013
- Couldn't be better.
- Fine.

66
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:04,931
- Nice talking to you, Truman.
- You, too.

67
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:06,141
We must go now.

68
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:09,853
Think about that policy. Okay,
that's two for one. That's a good deal.

69
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:12,147
- Doppelgänger special.
- Right.

70
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,398
Hi.

71
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:18,612
Hey, fellows. You going in? Go ahead.

72
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:21,990
- Go ahead.
- No, you first, please.

73
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,242
I'm not that anxious to get there.

74
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:40,383
Yes, hello.

75
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:44,012
Could I have directory assistance
for Fiji, please? Fiji islands.

76
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,514
Truman, did you see this?

77
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:49,476
I'm sorry, ma'am.

78
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:52,562
If he's in a coma,
he's probably uninsurable.

79
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,691
Hello? Yes. Fiji, please.

80
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,861
Do you have a listing for
Lauren Garland?

81
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,614
Nothing listed?

82
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:06,785
Okay. Do you have a Sylvia Garland?

83
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:08,453
"S" for Sylvia.

84
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:11,164
Nothing?

85
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:14,751
Okay. Thank you.

86
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,539
- Lawrence.
- Hey, Burbank.

87
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:56,042
Got a prospect in Wells Park
I need you to close.

88
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,838
Wells Park?

89
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,969
- On Harbor Island?
- You know another one?

90
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:09,889
I can't do it.
I have an appointment. Dentist.

91
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:16,062
You're going to lose a lot more than
your teeth if you don't meet your quota.

92
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:17,731
Look, Truman,

93
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,442
they're making cutbacks
at the end of this month.

94
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:23,028
- Cutbacks?
- Yeah. Now, you need this.

95
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:28,158
Besides, a half-hour across the bay,
a little sea air would do you good.

96
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:30,744
Thanks.

97
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:41,421
Hello.

98
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:44,674
Ferry's still here.
Thought I might have missed it.

99
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:46,676
One-way or return?

100
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:48,970
Return.

101
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:53,141
There you go, sir.

102
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:54,452
- Do you need any help, sir?
- You go ahead. I'll be fine.

103
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:57,288
Yeah.

104
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:12,137
Hi, honey.

105
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:16,307
Look what I got free at the checkout.

106
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:21,062
It's a Chef's Pal.
It's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in one.

107
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:23,898
Never needs sharpening,
dishwasher-safe.

108
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:24,983
Wow!

109
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:27,652
That's amazing.

110
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,071
Truman,

111
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,283
you missed a spot.

112
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:49,048
That is a beer.

113
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:53,720
You know, I'm thinking
about getting out, Marlon.

114
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,722
Yeah? Out of what?

115
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:58,349
Out of my job, out of Seahaven.

116
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,269
- Off this island. Out.
- Out of your job?

117
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:04,439
What the hell's wrong with your job?
You have a great job, Truman.

118
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,942
You have a desk job.
I'd kill for a desk job.

119
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:11,988
Here you go.

120
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:14,491
You should try stocking
vending machines for a living.

121
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:17,202
- No, thanks.
- Now there's excitement.

122
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:20,497
Don't you ever get antsy? Itchy feet?

123
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,833
Where's there to go?

124
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,795
Fiji.

125
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,840
Where the hell's Fiji? Near Florida?

126
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:37,806
- See here?
- Yeah.

127
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:39,349
This is us,

128
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:43,561
and all the way around here,

129
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,230
Fiji.

130
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:49,901
You can't get any further away
before you start coming back.

131
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,862
You know, there are still islands in Fiji

132
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,989
where no human being
has ever set foot.

133
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,370
So when are you going to go?

134
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:04,749
It's not that simple.

135
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:07,919
It takes money,

136
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,213
planning.

137
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,590
I can't just up and go.

138
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,592
Right.

139
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,221
I'm going to do it.
Don't worry about that.

140
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,516
Bonus time is just around the corner.

141
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:29,524
- You coming for a drink?
- No, I can't tonight.

142
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,422
I don't like the look of that weather, son.
I think we should head back.

143
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:55,049
- No, Dad. Not yet.
- No, come on. We should go back.

144
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,677
- A bit farther, please?
- Son, listen.

145
00:11:58,136 --> 00:11:59,971
- Okay.
- Yes.

146
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,808
Daddy!

147
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,386
You're soaked. Where have you been?

148
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,680
I figure we can
scrape together $8,000...

149
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:25,139
Every time you and Marlon
get together...

150
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:27,308
We can bum around the world
for a year on that.

151
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:31,145
And then what, Truman?
We'd be where we were five years ago.

152
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:35,692
- You're talking like a teenager.
- Maybe I feel like a teenager.

153
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,736
We have mortgage payments, Truman.

154
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:40,405
We have car payments.

155
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:43,616
What, we're just going to walk away
from our financial obligations?

156
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,702
It would be an adventure.

157
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,832
I thought we were going to try for a
baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?

158
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:54,252
That can wait. I want to get away.

159
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:57,088
See some of the world, explore.

160
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,091
Honey, you want to be an explorer?

161
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:02,927
This'll pass.

162
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:06,556
We all think like this now and then.

163
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:11,769
Let's get you out of these wet clothes,

164
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,688
come to bed.

165
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:17,984
You never see anything anyway.
They always

166
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:20,987
turn the camera and play music and,

167
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:24,198
you know, the wind blows in,
and the curtains move

168
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:25,700
and you don't see anything.

169
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,957
<i>- Dog Fancy,</i> please.
<i>- Dog Fancy.</i>

170
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:35,543
Thank you.

171
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:39,589
- Paper, Earl, please.
- Paper.

172
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:44,552
I might as well pick one of these up
while I'm at it.

173
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:47,305
- For the wife?
- She's got to have them.

174
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,975
- Anything else, Truman?
- That's the whole ball of wax.

175
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,394
- Catch you later.
- Okay.

176
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,333
Dad?

177
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,379
What are you doing?

178
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:23,716
What the... Get out of the way!

179
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:25,343
Stop them!

180
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:29,514
Stop those people!

181
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:35,978
Open the doors!
Somebody, stop the bus!

182
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,190
Stop the bus! Somebody, stop it!

183
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:42,276
Somebody, stop the bus!

184
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:58,668
And wasn't it funny...

185
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:07,343
It doesn't sound insane at all, Truman.

186
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:11,305
I see him 10 times a week
in 100 different faces.

187
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:15,309
I almost hugged a perfect stranger
in the salon last Thursday.

188
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:18,980
It was Dad. I swear.
Dressed like a homeless man.

189
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,982
And you know what else was strange?

190
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:23,067
A businessman and a woman
with a little dog

191
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:25,778
came out of nowhere
and forced him onto a bus.

192
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:28,656
It's about time they cleaned up
the trash downtown

193
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,450
before we become
just like the rest of the country.

194
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,078
They never found Dad's body.
Maybe somehow...

195
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:35,163
God!

196
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:38,541
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him,
it was his twin.

197
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:44,046
- Did Dad have a brother?
- Truman, you know perfectly well

198
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:48,801
that your father was an only child,
just like you.

199
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,055
Now, sweetie,

200
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:56,893
you're just feeling bad
because of what happened.

201
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:01,105
You, sailing off into that storm.

202
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,777
But I've never blamed you, Truman,

203
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:09,947
and I don't blame you now.

204
00:17:56,202 --> 00:17:57,411
Truman?

205
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:03,668
What are you doing down here?

206
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,796
Fixing the mower.

207
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,677
- Saw my father today.
- I know.

208
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,765
Your mother called.

209
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,395
You really shouldn't upset her like that.

210
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:25,064
Did you want... What did you want?

211
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,024
I made macaroni.

212
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:29,193
I'm not hungry.

213
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:33,656
You know, you really ought to throw out
that mower.

214
00:18:34,824 --> 00:18:37,243
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

215
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:15,406
What's he doing?

216
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:18,492
See, they got rid of her,
but they couldn't erase the memory.

217
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:20,244
The memory of who?

218
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,299
- You okay? You all right?
- Excuse me. Hi.

219
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:17,635
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry I fell on you like that.

220
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,846
- It's okay.
- I've just been such a klutz all day.

221
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,431
It's all right.

222
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:25,559
Sprained this ankle. Oh, my goodness.
I'm so sorry.

223
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:29,522
- I'm so sorry to fall on you like that.
- That's all right. Don't worry about it.

224
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,982
- I'm Meryl.
- Hi, I'm Truman.

225
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:33,526
Hey, nice to meet you.

226
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:03,532
- Truman, you've studied enough.
- No. I got to commit this to memory.

227
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:05,576
Come on, Truman,
one ice-cold brewski.

228
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:06,911
Come on.

229
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:10,748
You're going to have to copy off me,
so be careful.

230
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:15,377
You're a better person than I am.

231
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:16,712
- See you later.
- Okay.

232
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,172
- Bye.
- Bye.

233
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,799
See you later, loser.

234
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:22,611
Hi.

235
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:30,411
<i>- Konnichi-wa.</i>
- What?

236
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,705
You take Japanese.

237
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,165
Yes.

238
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:39,753
Lauren, right?

239
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:41,463
It's on the...

240
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,675
Lauren. Right.

241
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,845
I'm Truman Burbank.

242
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,556
Yeah, I know.

243
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:54,101
You know, Truman,
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

244
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,394
Really?

245
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:01,817
Yeah. I can understand that.
I'm a pretty dangerous character.

246
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,111
I'm sorry. It's not up to me.

247
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,072
A girl's got to be careful.

248
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:13,037
- You have a boyfriend, right?
- No, it's not that.

249
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,665
Was it Meryl, that girl that was with me?
We're not... We don't...

250
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,168
We're just friends.

251
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:21,920
- It's nothing like that.
- It's how I look?

252
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,505
Not your type?

253
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:25,549
No.

254
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,552
I like your pin.

255
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:31,889
I was wondering that myself.

256
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,893
Would you want to maybe, possibly,

257
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:39,938
sometime go out
for some pizza or something?

258
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:41,649
Like, Friday?

259
00:24:42,775 --> 00:24:44,109
- Saturday?
- I can't.

260
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,153
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

261
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:53,243
- We have finals tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know.

262
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,914
If we don't go now, it won't happen.

263
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:01,460
Do you understand?
So what do you want to do?

264
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:38,622
Please keep your hands inside the car!

265
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:58,392
This is my favorite pizza place.

266
00:25:58,475 --> 00:25:59,518
Tony!

267
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,645
One large, extra plankton.

268
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:05,774
We have so little time.
They're going to be here any minute.

269
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,819
- Who are?
- They don't want me talking to you.

270
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,946
Then don't talk.

271
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:26,670
They're here.

272
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,506
- Truman.
- What do they want?

273
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,717
Listen to me.
Everybody knows about you.

274
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,510
Everybody knows everything you do.

275
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:35,596
They're pretending, Truman.
Do you understand?

276
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,264
- Everybody's pretending.
- I don't know.

277
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,266
No, my name's not Lauren. It's Sylvia.

278
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:40,642
- My name's Sylvia.
- Sylvia?

279
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:43,103
- Yeah.
- Lauren, sweetheart, not again.

280
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:46,106
- Wait a minute. Who are you?
- I'm her father.

281
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:49,109
- I've never even seen him before.
- We weren't doing anything.

282
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:51,945
He's lying.
Truman, please don't listen to him.

283
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:56,784
Everything I've told you is the truth.
This, it's fake. It's all for you.

284
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:59,703
- I don't understand.
- The sky and sea, everything, it's a set.

285
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:00,788
It's a show.

286
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,248
Everybody's watching you.
Please don't listen to him.

287
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,459
He's going to lie to you.
They're watching us now.

288
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,545
- I want to know what's going on.
- Schizophrenia. She has episodes.

289
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:09,963
We've tried everything.

290
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:13,383
Hypnotism, shock therapy. Don't worry.

291
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,511
- Truman!
- You're not the first.

292
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:18,972
You're not the first. She brings
all her boyfriends down here.

293
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:21,642
What's he saying? Truman, he's lying.

294
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,895
- Get out of here. Come and find me.
- Don't worry.

295
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:28,440
We're going to Fiji.
Fiji. We're moving to Fiji.

296
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:29,608
Fiji?

297
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:42,788
Sylvia!

298
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:43,872
Hey!

299
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,926
Why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?

300
00:27:56,009 --> 00:28:00,472
His mother got sick, really sick.
He couldn't leave her. He's kind.

301
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:02,307
Maybe he's too kind.

302
00:28:02,891 --> 00:28:05,519
I can't believe he married Meryl
on the rebound.

303
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:06,937
Excuse me.

304
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:08,313
Come on, Sal.

305
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:11,483
We've already got this
on the greatest hits tape.

306
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:12,609
Can I borrow that?

307
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:01,575
Close, but no cigar.

308
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:32,606
<i>And it's another beautiful day
in paradise, folks,</i>

309
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:35,442
<i>but don't forget to buckle up
out there in radioland.</i>

310
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:37,653
<i>Remember, a good driver...</i>

311
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:48,121
<i>...wait for the cue.</i>

312
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:51,416
<i>Stand by, one.</i>

313
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:53,835
<i>Countdown to action.</i>

314
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,462
<i>Stand by, one.</i>

315
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:01,510
<i>He's heading west on Stewart.
Stand by, all extras.</i>

316
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:05,931
<i>He'll be on you in about 90 seconds.
Props, make sure the coffee's hot.</i>

317
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:09,226
<i>Okay, he's making his turn
onto Lancaster Square.</i>

318
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:13,563
<i>Oh, my God! He nearly hit her.</i>

319
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:15,816
<i>Something's wrong.
Change frequencies.</i>

320
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:22,906
<i>Sorry about that, folks.</i>

321
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,325
<i>I guess we picked up
a police frequency or something.</i>

322
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:28,328
<i>It sometimes happens,
and it can drive you crazy.</i>

323
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:30,539
<i>Okay, it's Classical Clive back in here</i>

324
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:33,166
<i>and we've still got
some great music up ahead,</i>

325
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,501
<i>but don't forget to buckle up.</i>

326
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:37,212
<i>Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.</i>

327
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,423
<i>A safe driver is what? Yes...</i>

328
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:56,940
Morning, ma'am.

329
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:39,042
- I love that idea.
- It's pretty cool, isn't it?

330
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,774
Can I help?

331
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:47,235
Yeah. I have an appointment
at Gable Enterprises.

332
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,778
They went bust.

333
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:55,994
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

334
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:59,206
- Just tell me what's happening.
- Got to go, sir. We're remodeling.

335
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,291
No, you're not.
What are those people doing?

336
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:03,084
It's none of your business!

337
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:05,629
If you don't tell me what's happening,
I'll report you!

338
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,464
You're trespassing.

339
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:39,955
Marlon.

340
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:43,250
- Truman. What are you doing here?
- I got to talk to you.

341
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,210
It's a bad time, okay? I'm way behind.

342
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:47,837
I'm onto something, Marlon.
Something big.

343
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:51,007
- You okay? You look like shit.
- I think I'm mixed up in something.

344
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,133
Mixed up in what?

345
00:34:52,217 --> 00:34:53,969
There's no point trying to explain it,

346
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:57,180
but a lot of strange things
have been happening.

347
00:35:00,558 --> 00:35:04,271
The people on the elevator.
There was no backing on it.

348
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,898
I looked out. There was people there.

349
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:10,193
And on the radio on the way to work,
it starts following me along,

350
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:11,987
talking about everything that I'm doing.

351
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,739
- Know what I mean?
- Truman, this is one of your fantasies...

352
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,241
I think this is about my dad.

353
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,535
- Your dad?
- I think he's alive.

354
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:23,415
Yeah. I'll tell you about it later.
I'm definitely being followed.

355
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:24,916
Who?

356
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,171
It's hard to tell.
They look just like regular people.

357
00:35:33,508 --> 00:35:37,095
- How about those two?
- I don't know. Could be.

358
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:41,891
It's when I'm unpredictable, that's...
They can't, you know.

359
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:45,687
- Did anything happen?
- No.

360
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:47,981
We gotta get out of here.
You ready to go?

361
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,941
- No. I just came here.
- Come on.

362
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,735
I told you I can't.

363
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,907
You're going to get both our asses fired,
you know that?

364
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,160
- Okay, man, let's do it.
- What?

365
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:02,370
Whatever you say, I'm game.

366
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,956
- What are you talking about?
- Yes, sirree.

367
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,584
Your birthday comes but once a year.

368
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,256
Maybe I'm being set up for something.

369
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,508
You ever think about that, Marlon?

370
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:18,678
Like your whole life
has been building toward something?

371
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:19,763
No.

372
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:24,809
When you were hauling chickens
in the summer for Kaiser,

373
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:27,437
what was the furthest
you ever got off the island?

374
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,982
Went all over.
Never found a place like this, though.

375
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:35,320
Look at that sunset, Truman.
It's perfect.

376
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:37,280
Yeah.

377
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:39,991
That's the big guy.

378
00:36:40,867 --> 00:36:43,912
- Quite a paintbrush he's got.
- Yep.

379
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:50,460
Just between you and me, Marlon,

380
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:54,130
I'm going away for a while.

381
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,634
- Really?
- Yeah.

382
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,096
Little angel.

383
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,145
My little clown.

384
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:12,941
Old carrot top.

385
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,318
The best of both of us.

386
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:19,656
We should be
getting you home, Mother.

387
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:23,201
Hold on a minute.
Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.

388
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:25,578
Do you remember, Truman,
when Dad was still with us?

389
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:29,124
That was quite a drive.
You slept the whole way there.

390
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:31,501
It looks so small.

391
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,837
Things always do
when you look back, darling.

392
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,380
Look, Truman.

393
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:38,258
The happiest day of our lives. Look.

394
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:43,096
Jean, Jodie, Joanne.

395
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,682
Doesn't she look beautiful, Truman?

396
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,226
She still does.

397
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:51,020
And there's lots of pages left over
for baby photos.

398
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:54,691
I would like to hold a grandchild
in my arms before I go.

399
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:57,444
Angela, we really should
be getting you home.

400
00:37:57,527 --> 00:38:00,029
- I'll take her.
- No. You stay, relax.

401
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:01,823
Enjoy yourself.
Your favorite show will be coming on.

402
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:02,949
You sure?

403
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:04,951
Besides, we have something
to discuss.

404
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,539
- A certain person's birthday.
- I see.

405
00:38:11,124 --> 00:38:14,627
<i>And there'll be another episode of</i>
I Love Lucy <i>same time tomorrow.</i>

406
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:17,547
<i>But right now,
it's time for</i> Golden Oldies.

407
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,300
<i>Tonight, we present
the enduring, much-loved classic,</i>

408
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:22,469
Show Me the Way to Go Home.

409
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,762
<i>A hymn of praise to small-town life,</i>

410
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:27,140
<i>where we learn
that you don't have to leave home</i>

411
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:31,853
<i>to discover what the world's all about,
and that no one is poor who has friends.</i>

412
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:36,858
<i>Full of laughter and love, pain and
sadness, but ultimately redemption,</i>

413
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,652
<i>we share the trials and tribulations
of the Abbott family.</i>

414
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:42,655
<i>Note the touching performance
of Ronald Brierly as Uncle Bunny.</i>

415
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:45,325
<i>That scene with the bowl of cherries
is going to have you</i>

416
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:48,328
<i>splitting your sides
with laughter all over again.</i>

417
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:52,373
<i>And there'll be tears, too,
when David and Jennifer are reunited.</i>

418
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:56,294
<i>But enough from me.
Let's join the Abbotts in Camden village.</i>

419
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:25,406
Thank you, sweetie.

420
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:32,622
I need to talk to you,
but let's go outside.

421
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:37,460
- Sweetie, I'd love to, but I'm really late.
- What's your rush?

422
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,879
Surgery.

423
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:43,424
There was that elevator disaster
downtown. It was on the news last night.

424
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:45,218
This cable just snapped.

425
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,845
This elevator,
it just plummeted down 10 flights.

426
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:50,390
The non-union workers. Just monsters.

427
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:53,101
That building, it's right next door
to where you work.

428
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:55,186
Can you imagine
if you had been in there?

429
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,813
It's not even worth thinking about.

430
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:59,816
Anyway, I have an amputation
on one of the young women

431
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:03,403
who was in that elevator.
She's very young. It's very sad.

432
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:06,948
- Anyway, wish me luck.
- I'll cross my fingers for you.

433
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,410
Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me.
May I help you?

434
00:40:54,078 --> 00:40:58,207
Yes. I'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. It's very important.

435
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:01,669
I'm afraid that that's not possible.
She's in pre-op.

436
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:05,048
Sure. Okay, fine.

437
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:08,134
- Can you pass along a message?
- I'll try.

438
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:11,971
Can you tell her I had to go to Fiji,
and that I'll call her when I get there?

439
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:15,725
- When you get to Fiji?
- You got it.

440
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:19,270
- Fine. I'll tell her.
- Thank you so much.

441
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:47,924
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

442
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,511
Here, let me help you with that.

443
00:41:55,848 --> 00:41:57,183
He's here.

444
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:00,603
I know.

445
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:02,855
Scalpel.

446
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:13,199
I'm now making my primary incision

447
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:16,869
just above the right knee.

448
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:20,873
Hold her.

449
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:23,334
Nicely done.

450
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:26,713
This isn't going to be pretty.
Unless you're family...

451
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:29,298
It's just beautiful. Beautiful job.

452
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:33,803
I'll just let someone else tidy up here.

453
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:00,830
- I'm sorry to keep you.
- That's okay.

454
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:06,669
- How can I help?
- I would like to book a flight to Fiji.

455
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:11,048
When would you like to leave?

456
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:13,176
Today.

457
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,572
I'm sorry. I don't have anything
for at least a month.

458
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:37,533
- A month?
- It's the busy season.

459
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:41,954
You want to book the flight?

460
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:46,501
It doesn't matter.
I'll make other arrangements, okay?

461
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:52,632
Last call for Chicago!

462
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:55,384
All aboard!

463
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:01,849
Thank you.

464
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:06,729
Windy city, here we come.

465
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:10,066
- Hi.
- Hi.

466
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:15,404
Hello. Hi.

467
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:18,449
Sisters.

468
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:22,245
- Mom, isn't that...
- Face the front.

469
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:52,191
Everybody off. We've got a problem.

470
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:13,296
I'm sorry, son.

471
00:45:27,143 --> 00:45:29,854
His father was from Chicago,
wasn't he?

472
00:45:30,104 --> 00:45:33,816
No. His dentist was from Pensacola.
His father was from Des Moines.

473
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,985
But how come he wants to go
to Chicago?

474
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:38,696
He's not going to Chicago.
He's not going anywhere.

475
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:40,865
He has to have it out with Meryl.

476
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:58,007
Truman?

477
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:06,515
- Honey, are you okay?
- Get in.

478
00:46:10,186 --> 00:46:11,395
Truman.

479
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:13,814
Look.

480
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:18,569
What?

481
00:46:19,737 --> 00:46:22,365
I predict that in just a moment,

482
00:46:24,033 --> 00:46:28,204
we will see a lady on a red bike,
followed by a man with flowers

483
00:46:29,163 --> 00:46:32,208
and a Volkswagen Beetle
with a dented fender.

484
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:34,627
- Truman, please.
- Look.

485
00:46:40,424 --> 00:46:41,634
Lady,

486
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:44,470
flowers,

487
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,765
and...

488
00:46:50,226 --> 00:46:53,145
- Truman, this is silly.
- There it is!

489
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:55,564
There's that dented Beetle! Yes!

490
00:47:02,947 --> 00:47:05,574
Don't you want to know how I did that?
I'll tell you.

491
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:08,077
They're on a loop.
They go around the block.

492
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,998
They come back. They go around again.
They just go round and round.

493
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:13,457
Round and round.

494
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:15,876
I invited Rita and Marlon
for a barbecue on Sunday.

495
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,421
- I'm gonna make my potato salad.
- I won't be here Sunday.

496
00:47:18,504 --> 00:47:20,464
I need you to remind me
we need more charcoal.

497
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:23,426
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

498
00:47:25,428 --> 00:47:28,931
You're upset because
you want to go to Fiji. Is that it?

499
00:47:31,392 --> 00:47:32,810
Okay, go.

500
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:38,774
I think you should save for
a few months, and then go.

501
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:41,610
There. Are you happy now?

502
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:43,779
I'm going to go take a shower.

503
00:47:46,323 --> 00:47:47,867
Let's go now.

504
00:47:48,284 --> 00:47:50,995
I'm ready to go now. Why wait?
Early bird gathers no moss.

505
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:53,706
Rolling stone catches the worm, right?

506
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,877
Truman, what are you doing?

507
00:48:02,006 --> 00:48:03,215
Truman!

508
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:07,136
Where shall we go?

509
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:10,723
- Truman, where are we going?
- I don't really know.

510
00:48:10,806 --> 00:48:13,059
I guess I'm being spontaneous.

511
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:17,021
Somebody, help me!
I'm being spontaneous!

512
00:48:18,022 --> 00:48:19,565
Forget Fiji.

513
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:22,568
- Can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?
- No.

514
00:48:24,612 --> 00:48:28,866
- What about Atlantic City?
- No, you hate to gamble.

515
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:31,952
- That's right, I do, don't I?
- So why would you want to go there?

516
00:48:32,036 --> 00:48:36,248
Because I never have.
That's why people go places, isn't it?

517
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:40,836
- Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
- Me, too.

518
00:48:49,261 --> 00:48:51,639
Blocked at every turn.

519
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:54,642
Beautifully synchronized,
don't you agree?

520
00:48:54,725 --> 00:48:57,728
- You're blaming me for the traffic?
- Should I?

521
00:49:04,693 --> 00:49:08,114
Truman, let's go home.

522
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:12,243
You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.

523
00:49:12,326 --> 00:49:14,662
It could be like this
all the way to Atlantic City.

524
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:16,247
Let's go back.

525
00:49:17,498 --> 00:49:20,292
I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.

526
00:49:24,004 --> 00:49:26,006
Can you please slow down?

527
00:49:26,924 --> 00:49:28,300
Yes, I can.

528
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:33,597
- Truman, that's our turnoff.
- I changed my mind again.

529
00:49:33,681 --> 00:49:37,101
What's New Orleans like
this time of year? Mardi Gras!

530
00:49:43,566 --> 00:49:47,361
Look, Meryl, same road, no cars.

531
00:49:47,486 --> 00:49:48,863
It's magic.

532
00:49:49,363 --> 00:49:52,491
Look, you let me out.
You're not right in the head.

533
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:54,869
You want to destroy yourself,
you do it on your own.

534
00:49:54,952 --> 00:49:57,079
I think I'd like a little company.

535
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:07,840
Truman, you knew this would happen.

536
00:50:09,091 --> 00:50:11,969
You know you can't drive over water.

537
00:50:12,261 --> 00:50:14,889
Let's go home where you'll feel safe.

538
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:19,602
- Give me your hand.
- Sweetie.

539
00:50:20,477 --> 00:50:21,645
Drive.

540
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:23,439
Truman!

541
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:26,942
We shouldn't be doing this!
Truman, we're breaking the law!

542
00:50:27,193 --> 00:50:28,736
- Oh, my!
- You can do it.

543
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:30,863
- Please, don't!
- You can make it.

544
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:32,489
Truman.

545
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:34,533
We're over.

546
00:50:34,617 --> 00:50:37,953
- We're over the bridge.
- We're over?

547
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:40,581
- We're over the bridge.
- We're over.

548
00:50:46,462 --> 00:50:48,214
Truman, what about that sign?

549
00:50:48,297 --> 00:50:50,966
I'm sure they're exaggerating.
We'll be fine.

550
00:50:52,551 --> 00:50:54,970
Exaggerating? Do you believe that?

551
00:50:55,054 --> 00:50:57,014
- Truman, let's go back!
- Can't go back!

552
00:50:57,139 --> 00:50:59,725
Oh, my! Truman, we're on fire!

553
00:50:59,808 --> 00:51:01,227
- It's okay.
- We're on fire!

554
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,229
It's okay. It's just smoke.

555
00:51:03,312 --> 00:51:04,855
- You okay?
- Yes.

556
00:51:05,064 --> 00:51:07,066
- Want to do it again?
- No!

557
00:51:08,484 --> 00:51:11,320
Truman, stop! Oh, God!

558
00:51:13,322 --> 00:51:17,326
So what are we going to do for money
when we get to New Orleans?

559
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,371
I have my Seahaven bank card.

560
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,792
So what? We're just gonna eat
into our savings, is that it?

561
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:27,920
I'm going to have to call your mother
when we get there.

562
00:51:28,003 --> 00:51:32,508
She's going to be worried sick. I don't
know how she's going to take this.

563
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:45,271
What now?

564
00:51:47,273 --> 00:51:48,941
<i>This is a red alert.</i>

565
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,238
Truman, it looks like a leak at the plant.

566
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,448
Back up. Leak at the plant.

567
00:51:56,532 --> 00:51:58,951
- We had to shut her down.
- Is there any way around?

568
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:01,745
- Whole area's being evacuated.
- Is there anything I can do?

569
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:03,789
- No, ma'am.
- Thank you for your help.

570
00:52:03,872 --> 00:52:05,541
You're welcome, Truman.

571
00:52:06,959 --> 00:52:08,335
Truman.

572
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,715
Truman!

573
00:52:13,132 --> 00:52:14,800
Truman, come back!

574
00:52:17,303 --> 00:52:18,721
Stop him!

575
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:21,390
Truman!

576
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:23,559
Catch him on the left!

577
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:41,452
Stay away!

578
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:48,876
No.

579
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:53,422
<i>...now in custody.</i>

580
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,596
Thank you both so much for your help.
I really appreciate it.

581
00:53:00,929 --> 00:53:04,600
He's lucky to be alive, ma'am.
Next time, we'll have to file charges.

582
00:53:04,683 --> 00:53:06,143
I understand.

583
00:53:06,435 --> 00:53:08,604
- Thanks again.
- Good night.

584
00:53:26,455 --> 00:53:29,041
Let me get you some help, Truman.

585
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:31,377
You're not well.

586
00:53:33,837 --> 00:53:36,548
Why do you want to have a baby
with me?

587
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:39,385
You can't stand me.

588
00:53:39,802 --> 00:53:41,428
That's not true.

589
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,811
Why don't you let me fix you
some of this new Mococoa drink?

590
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:52,147
All natural cocoa beans
from the upper slopes of Mt. Nicaragua.

591
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:53,982
No artificial sweeteners.

592
00:53:54,066 --> 00:53:56,610
What the hell are you talking about?

593
00:53:57,152 --> 00:53:58,987
Who are you talking to?

594
00:53:59,071 --> 00:54:02,157
I've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.

595
00:54:02,282 --> 00:54:05,994
What the hell does this have to do
with anything?

596
00:54:06,787 --> 00:54:08,789
Tell me what's happening!

597
00:54:08,956 --> 00:54:12,418
You're having a nervous breakdown,
that's what's happening.

598
00:54:12,501 --> 00:54:14,711
You're part of this, aren't you?

599
00:54:16,922 --> 00:54:18,882
- Truman.
- Meryl!

600
00:54:19,508 --> 00:54:21,969
You are scaring me.

601
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:24,680
No. You're scaring me, Meryl.

602
00:54:25,055 --> 00:54:28,892
What are you going to do? Dice me?
Slice me and peel me?

603
00:54:28,976 --> 00:54:31,395
There are so many choices!

604
00:54:32,187 --> 00:54:33,814
<i>Do something!</i>

605
00:54:35,107 --> 00:54:36,191
<i>What?</i>

606
00:54:37,025 --> 00:54:38,861
<i>What did you say?</i>

607
00:54:39,194 --> 00:54:42,322
- Who were you talking to?
- Nothing. I didn't say anything.

608
00:54:42,406 --> 00:54:44,074
I didn't say anything.

609
00:54:44,158 --> 00:54:47,453
- You said "do something."
- No, I didn't. I wasn't talking to anybody.

610
00:54:47,536 --> 00:54:50,914
- Talk to me!
- I don't know anything. Please stop.

611
00:54:50,998 --> 00:54:52,583
Stay where you are.

612
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:55,252
Truman?

613
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,963
Truman.

614
00:54:58,589 --> 00:55:02,259
Oh, thank God!

615
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:10,184
How can anyone expect me to carry on
under these conditions?

616
00:55:10,476 --> 00:55:12,478
It's unprofessional.

617
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:14,730
It's okay.

618
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:21,862
Everything's going to be okay.
It's all gonna be fine.

619
00:55:25,407 --> 00:55:27,576
I don't know what to think, Marlon.

620
00:55:31,705 --> 00:55:33,916
Maybe I'm losing my mind, but...

621
00:55:38,253 --> 00:55:41,590
It feels like the whole world
revolves around me somehow.

622
00:55:44,009 --> 00:55:46,678
That's a lot of world for one man,
Truman.

623
00:55:48,847 --> 00:55:50,933
Sure that's not wishful thinking?

624
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:54,394
You wishing you'd made something
more out of yourself?

625
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:57,439
Come on, who hasn't sat in the john,

626
00:55:57,523 --> 00:56:00,234
had an imaginary interview
on <i>Seahaven Tonight?</i>

627
00:56:00,692 --> 00:56:03,529
- Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
- This is different.

628
00:56:03,612 --> 00:56:05,614
Everybody seems to be in on it.

629
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:13,455
I've been your best friend
since we were 7 years old, Truman.

630
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:15,749
The only way you and I
ever made it through school

631
00:56:15,832 --> 00:56:18,460
was by cheating off each other's
test papers.

632
00:56:19,503 --> 00:56:21,380
Jesus, they were identical.

633
00:56:23,674 --> 00:56:25,884
But I always felt safe knowing that.

634
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:29,930
'Cause whatever the answer was,
we were right together,

635
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,974
and we were wrong together.

636
00:56:33,642 --> 00:56:36,687
Remember that time I stayed up
with you all night in your tent

637
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:39,064
because you wanted to play North Pole?

638
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:41,233
And I got pneumonia?

639
00:56:43,277 --> 00:56:44,653
You remember that?

640
00:56:45,529 --> 00:56:47,990
You were out of school for
about a month.

641
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:57,165
You're the closest thing I ever had
to a brother, Truman.

642
00:57:03,672 --> 00:57:05,299
I know that things

643
00:57:06,466 --> 00:57:10,554
haven't really worked out for either of us
like we used to dream they would.

644
00:57:11,513 --> 00:57:15,350
I know that feeling, when it's like
everything's slipping away

645
00:57:16,602 --> 00:57:18,729
and you don't want to believe it,

646
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:22,065
so you look for answers
somewhere else, but...

647
00:57:28,572 --> 00:57:30,073
The point is,

648
00:57:30,782 --> 00:57:33,410
I'd gladly walk in front of traffic for you.

649
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:43,253
<i>The point is, I would gladly
step in front of traffic for you, Truman.</i>

650
00:57:44,421 --> 00:57:47,674
And the last thing I'd ever do
is lie to you.

651
00:57:50,135 --> 00:57:52,679
And the last thing that I would ever do

652
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:56,808
is lie to you.

653
00:58:00,062 --> 00:58:02,064
I mean, think about it, Truman.

654
00:58:02,564 --> 00:58:04,358
If everybody is in on it,

655
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,029
I'd have to be in on it, too.

656
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,248
I'm not in on it, Truman, because

657
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:23,043
there is no "it."

658
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:29,549
You were right about one thing, though.

659
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:31,593
What's that?

660
00:58:33,303 --> 00:58:35,347
The thing that started all this.

661
00:58:50,779 --> 00:58:53,573
Yep. I found him for you, Truman.

662
00:58:53,949 --> 00:58:55,867
That's why I came by tonight.

663
00:58:56,743 --> 00:58:59,121
I'm sure he's got quite a story to tell.

664
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:04,292
Go to him.

665
00:59:10,924 --> 00:59:12,467
Easy on the fog.

666
00:59:14,302 --> 00:59:16,179
Stand by, crane cam.

667
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:19,015
Crane cam.

668
00:59:26,982 --> 00:59:28,358
Button cam 3.

669
00:59:40,871 --> 00:59:42,956
I never stopped believing.

670
00:59:46,084 --> 00:59:49,045
And wide, curb cam 8.

671
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:50,881
My son.

672
00:59:52,674 --> 00:59:54,676
- Move in for a close-up?
- No.

673
00:59:56,678 --> 00:59:58,096
Move back

674
00:59:59,264 --> 01:00:00,724
and fade up music.

675
01:00:06,521 --> 01:00:08,148
And now go in close.

676
01:00:09,399 --> 01:00:11,318
<i>All those years wasted.</i>

677
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:16,865
<i>I'll make it up to you, son. I swear.</i>

678
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:24,206
<i>Dad.</i>

679
01:00:25,665 --> 01:00:26,708
Yes!

680
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:37,677
Bravo.

681
01:00:38,094 --> 01:00:40,263
That will win the ratings period.

682
01:00:40,972 --> 01:00:42,057
Congratulations.

683
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,226
Okay, everybody, quiet down.
Let's concentrate.

684
01:00:44,309 --> 01:00:46,102
- Great television.
- That was good work.

685
01:00:46,853 --> 01:00:48,980
Let's get some champagne up here.

686
01:00:49,064 --> 01:00:50,524
Congratulations.

687
01:00:51,817 --> 01:00:55,529
- Well done, Christof.
- It was brilliant. It just broke my heart.

688
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:00,867
- Well done, everyone!
- Bravo!

689
01:01:00,951 --> 01:01:02,244
Congratulations.

690
01:01:20,345 --> 01:01:23,598
<i>1.7 billion were there for his birth.</i>

691
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:31,022
<i>220 countries tuned in for his first step.</i>

692
01:01:31,106 --> 01:01:34,484
<i>The world stood still for that stolen kiss.</i>

693
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,112
<i>And as he grew, so did the technology.</i>

694
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:39,281
<i>An entire human life</i>

695
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:42,367
<i>recorded on an intricate network
of hidden cameras</i>

696
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:46,288
<i>and broadcast live and unedited,
24 hours a day,</i>

697
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:49,457
<i>seven days a week,
to an audience around the globe.</i>

698
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:53,128
<i>Coming to you now
from Seahaven Island,</i>

699
01:01:53,336 --> 01:01:56,590
<i>enclosed in the largest studio
ever constructed,</i>

700
01:01:56,673 --> 01:01:58,925
<i>and along with the Great Wall of China,</i>

701
01:01:59,009 --> 01:02:02,304
<i>one of only two man-made structures
visible from space,</i>

702
01:02:03,013 --> 01:02:06,224
<i>now in its 30th great year,</i>

703
01:02:06,308 --> 01:02:08,226
<i>it's</i> The Truman Show.

704
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:14,858
What a week it's been.
I don't know about you,

705
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:16,902
I was on pins and needles
the entire time.

706
01:02:17,402 --> 01:02:20,155
<i>Hello and good evening.
I'm your host Mike Michaelson,</i>

707
01:02:20,238 --> 01:02:21,615
<i>and welcome to</i> Trutalk.

708
01:02:21,698 --> 01:02:24,200
<i>Our forum for issues growing
out of the show.</i>

709
01:02:24,284 --> 01:02:26,870
<i>But tonight,
something very special indeed.</i>

710
01:02:26,995 --> 01:02:31,249
A rare and exclusive interview
with the show's conceiver and creator.

711
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:35,295
So come with us now as we go live
to the lunar room

712
01:02:35,378 --> 01:02:38,757
<i>on the 221st floor
of the omni-cam ecosphere.</i>

713
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,469
<i>That's where we'll find the world's
greatest tele-visionary.</i>

714
01:02:42,677 --> 01:02:45,597
<i>The designer and architect
of the world within a world</i>

715
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,807
<i>that is Seahaven Island: Christof.</i>

716
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:52,103
<i>Before we begin, I'd like to thank you
on behalf of our audience,</i>

717
01:02:52,187 --> 01:02:54,022
<i>for granting this exclusive interview.</i>

718
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:56,358
<i>We know how demanding
your schedule is</i>

719
01:02:56,441 --> 01:02:59,319
<i>and we all know how jealously
you guard your privacy.</i>

720
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:01,696
<i>This, sir, is indeed an honor.</i>

721
01:03:01,863 --> 01:03:03,239
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

722
01:03:03,323 --> 01:03:06,242
<i>The catalyst for the recent
dramatic events on the show</i>

723
01:03:06,326 --> 01:03:08,411
<i>has been Truman's father, Kirk,</i>

724
01:03:08,495 --> 01:03:11,873
<i>and his attempts to infiltrate the show.
But before we get into that,</i>

725
01:03:11,957 --> 01:03:14,626
<i>I think it's worth noting
this is not the first time</i>

726
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:18,046
<i>someone from the outside
has attempted to reach Truman, is it?</i>

727
01:03:18,129 --> 01:03:20,006
<i>We have had our close calls in the past.</i>

728
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:23,176
Truman! It's television! Yes!

729
01:03:24,052 --> 01:03:27,097
Yes! I did it! I'm on <i>The Truman Show!</i>

730
01:03:27,889 --> 01:03:29,933
<i>But there's never been anything
to compare with</i>

731
01:03:30,016 --> 01:03:31,977
<i>this most recent breach in security.</i>

732
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:35,230
<i>The first intruder
to be a former cast member.</i>

733
01:03:35,855 --> 01:03:36,982
A dead one at that.

734
01:03:37,065 --> 01:03:40,652
<i>Got to say, writing Kirk back in,
masterstroke.</i>

735
01:03:41,111 --> 01:03:43,613
<i>Since Kirk started this whole crisis
in Truman's life,</i>

736
01:03:43,697 --> 01:03:46,992
<i>I came to the conclusion that he was
the only one who could end it.</i>

737
01:03:47,075 --> 01:03:48,201
Truman!

738
01:03:48,284 --> 01:03:49,577
Truman, no!

739
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:51,746
That's off-limits.

740
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:55,542
- Why? What's over there?
- Nothing. It's dangerous. That's all.

741
01:03:55,792 --> 01:03:58,003
You've got to know
your limitations, Truman.

742
01:03:58,086 --> 01:04:02,215
<i>But let's remind viewers of exactly why
Dad was written out in the first place.</i>

743
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,677
<i>As Truman grew up,
we were forced to manufacture ways</i>

744
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:07,512
<i>to keep him on the island.</i>

745
01:04:07,804 --> 01:04:10,515
I'd like to be an explorer,
like the great Magellan.

746
01:04:10,598 --> 01:04:12,100
You're too late.

747
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,561
There's really nothing left to explore.

748
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:21,693
<i>Finally, I came up with the concept
of Kirk's drowning.</i>

749
01:04:21,776 --> 01:04:24,904
<i>Most effective. Truman's been
terrified of the water ever since.</i>

750
01:04:24,988 --> 01:04:27,824
<i>When Kirk read the synopsis
for the </i>Death At Sea <i>episode,</i>

751
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:31,369
<i>he was disappointed, to say the least.</i>

752
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,040
<i>I'm sure that's what caused him
to break back onto the set.</i>

753
01:04:35,123 --> 01:04:38,460
<i>But how do you intend to explain
his 22-year absence?</i>

754
01:04:40,378 --> 01:04:42,672
- Amnesia.
<i>- Brilliant.</i>

755
01:04:43,465 --> 01:04:45,300
<i>Let's take some viewer phone calls.</i>

756
01:04:45,383 --> 01:04:48,303
<i>Charlotte, North Carolina,
you're on with Christof.</i>

757
01:04:49,387 --> 01:04:50,847
<i>Yeah, hi, Christof.</i>

758
01:04:51,139 --> 01:04:54,642
<i>I was just wondering how many
cameras you got there in that town.</i>

759
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:57,228
<i>Somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000.</i>

760
01:04:57,645 --> 01:05:02,358
<i>- That's a lot of cameras.
- Remember, we started with just one.</i>

761
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:06,154
<i>He was curious from birth.</i>

762
01:05:07,155 --> 01:05:10,784
<i>Premature by two weeks. It was almost
as if he couldn't wait to get started.</i>

763
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:13,161
<i>And his eagerness to leave
his mother's womb</i>

764
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:15,747
<i>was the very reason he was the one
who was selected.</i>

765
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:18,541
<i>In competition
with five other unwanted pregnancies,</i>

766
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:21,419
<i>the casting of a show,
determined by an air date,</i>

767
01:05:21,544 --> 01:05:23,838
<i>Truman was the one who
arrived on cue.</i>

768
01:05:28,635 --> 01:05:31,513
<i>Incidentally, I believe
Truman is the first child</i>

769
01:05:31,596 --> 01:05:34,099
<i>to have been legally adopted
by a corporation.</i>

770
01:05:34,182 --> 01:05:35,308
<i>That's correct.</i>

771
01:05:35,391 --> 01:05:37,769
<i>The show has generated
enormous revenues,</i>

772
01:05:37,852 --> 01:05:41,106
<i>now equivalent to the gross national
product of a small country.</i>

773
01:05:41,189 --> 01:05:42,357
<i>People forget it takes</i>

774
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:45,151
<i>the population of an entire country
to keep the show running.</i>

775
01:05:45,235 --> 01:05:48,905
<i>Since the show is on 24 hours a day
without commercial interruption,</i>

776
01:05:48,988 --> 01:05:52,534
<i>all those staggering revenues
are generated by product placement.</i>

777
01:05:52,951 --> 01:05:55,286
<i>That's true.
Everything on the show is for sale.</i>

778
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:58,665
<i>From the actors' wardrobe, food
products, to the very homes they live in.</i>

779
01:05:58,748 --> 01:06:01,084
<i>All of it available in the </i>Truman <i>catalog</i>

780
01:06:01,167 --> 01:06:02,544
<i>and operators are standing by.</i>

781
01:06:02,627 --> 01:06:04,379
<i>Christof, let me ask you.</i>

782
01:06:04,796 --> 01:06:08,049
<i>Why do you think
that Truman has never come close</i>

783
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:11,678
<i>to discovering the true nature
of his world until now?</i>

784
01:06:12,137 --> 01:06:15,181
<i>We accept the reality of the world
with which we are presented.</i>

785
01:06:15,265 --> 01:06:16,891
<i>It's as simple as that.</i>

786
01:06:17,517 --> 01:06:19,144
<i>The Hague for Christof.</i>

787
01:06:19,227 --> 01:06:21,437
<i>Hello? The Hague?</i>

788
01:06:22,939 --> 01:06:26,526
<i>All right, we've lost that call. Let's go
to Hollywood. You're on </i>Trutalk.

789
01:06:26,609 --> 01:06:29,237
Hi, I'd just like to say one thing.

790
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,989
You're a liar and a manipulator.

791
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:33,366
<i>And what you've done to Truman
is sick.</i>

792
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:37,036
<i>We remember this voice, don't we?</i>

793
01:06:38,288 --> 01:06:40,790
<i>- How could we forget?
- Let's go to another call.</i>

794
01:06:40,874 --> 01:06:44,169
<i>No. It's fine, Mike.</i>

795
01:06:44,586 --> 01:06:47,505
<i>I love to reminisce
with former members of the cast.</i>

796
01:06:48,756 --> 01:06:50,008
<i>Sylvia,</i>

797
01:06:50,967 --> 01:06:53,803
<i>as you announced
so melodramatically to the world,</i>

798
01:06:55,096 --> 01:06:58,349
<i>you think because you batted your eyes
at Truman once,</i>

799
01:06:59,726 --> 01:07:01,186
<i>flirted with him,</i>

800
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:03,813
<i>stole a few minutes of airtime with him</i>

801
01:07:03,897 --> 01:07:07,066
<i>to thrust yourself and your politics
into the limelight,</i>

802
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:10,862
<i>that you know him?
That you know what's right for him?</i>

803
01:07:11,362 --> 01:07:13,990
<i>You really think you're in a position
to judge him?</i>

804
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:16,201
What right do you have to take a baby

805
01:07:16,284 --> 01:07:18,953
and turn his life
into some kind of mockery?

806
01:07:19,787 --> 01:07:21,581
Don't you ever feel guilty?

807
01:07:23,249 --> 01:07:27,003
<i>I have given Truman a chance
to lead a normal life.</i>

808
01:07:28,338 --> 01:07:31,382
<i>The world, the place you live in,</i>

809
01:07:32,467 --> 01:07:33,885
<i>is the sick place.</i>

810
01:07:36,012 --> 01:07:38,056
<i>Seahaven is the way
the world should be.</i>

811
01:07:38,139 --> 01:07:41,851
He's not a performer. He's a prisoner.
Look at what you've done to him!

812
01:07:41,935 --> 01:07:43,645
<i>He could leave at any time.</i>

813
01:07:43,853 --> 01:07:46,397
<i>If his was more than
just a vague ambition,</i>

814
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:50,068
<i>if he was absolutely determined
to discover the truth,</i>

815
01:07:51,277 --> 01:07:53,488
<i>there's no way we could prevent him.</i>

816
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:56,449
<i>I think what distresses you,</i>

817
01:07:57,408 --> 01:08:00,662
<i>really, caller, is that ultimately</i>

818
01:08:01,913 --> 01:08:05,541
<i>Truman prefers his cell, as you call it.</i>

819
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:07,669
That's where you're wrong.

820
01:08:08,169 --> 01:08:10,922
You're so wrong,
and he'll prove you wrong.

821
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:15,551
<i>Aside from the heated comments
of a very vocal minority,</i>

822
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:18,471
<i>it's been
an overwhelmingly positive experience.</i>

823
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:21,015
<i>Yes. For Truman
and for the viewing public.</i>

824
01:08:21,099 --> 01:08:23,017
<i>Christof, I can't thank you enough</i>

825
01:08:23,101 --> 01:08:25,561
<i>for giving so generously
of your time tonight.</i>

826
01:08:25,645 --> 01:08:28,523
<i>I think it's safe to say that
now that this crisis is behind us</i>

827
01:08:28,606 --> 01:08:30,275
<i>and that Truman's back to his old self,</i>

828
01:08:30,358 --> 01:08:33,695
<i>we can look forward
to some exciting new developments.</i>

829
01:08:33,778 --> 01:08:37,115
<i>Mike, the big news is
that Meryl will be leaving Truman</i>

830
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:38,783
<i>in an upcoming episode.</i>

831
01:08:38,866 --> 01:08:41,536
<i>And a new romantic interest
will be introduced.</i>

832
01:08:42,203 --> 01:08:46,541
<i>I'm determined that television's first
on-air conception will still take place.</i>

833
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:50,962
<i>Another television milestone
straight ahead. You heard it here first.</i>

834
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:53,798
<i>It has been a singular honor
and a pleasure, sir.</i>

835
01:08:53,881 --> 01:08:56,467
<i>- Christof, thank you.
- Thank you, Mike.</i>

836
01:10:14,921 --> 01:10:16,547
- Simeon.
- What?

837
01:10:20,968 --> 01:10:22,512
Is he looking at us?

838
01:10:22,929 --> 01:10:24,889
Jesus, do you think he knows?

839
01:10:26,307 --> 01:10:27,308
<i>Hello?</i>

840
01:10:27,809 --> 01:10:29,352
Better call Christof.

841
01:10:29,477 --> 01:10:31,479
<i>Hello? Come in, Major Burbank.</i>

842
01:10:43,658 --> 01:10:44,659
Jesus.

843
01:10:48,996 --> 01:10:51,916
- He's back to his old self.
- Thank God.

844
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:02,218
That's an unusual cat, my man.

845
01:11:07,098 --> 01:11:10,351
<i>I hereby proclaim this planet...</i>

846
01:11:15,106 --> 01:11:17,900
<i>Trumania of the Burbank galaxy.</i>

847
01:11:20,361 --> 01:11:22,697
- Is he gonna go?
- Okay, hallway camera ready.

848
01:11:24,574 --> 01:11:25,950
<i>That one's for free.</i>

849
01:11:26,033 --> 01:11:27,994
Keep up with him,
'cause he'll move fast.

850
01:11:28,077 --> 01:11:30,204
Stand by, all house cameras.

851
01:11:31,247 --> 01:11:33,458
- Morning!
- Good morning.

852
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:35,293
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

853
01:11:35,376 --> 01:11:37,044
In case I don't see you...

854
01:11:37,128 --> 01:11:39,672
Good afternoon, good evening,
and good night.

855
01:11:42,091 --> 01:11:44,469
- Good afternoon...
- Good morning.

856
01:11:44,552 --> 01:11:46,679
...evening and good night.

857
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:49,474
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer.

858
01:11:49,557 --> 01:11:51,851
- How's it going?
- Let me check.

859
01:11:52,643 --> 01:11:54,187
Vital signs are good.

860
01:11:56,564 --> 01:11:57,815
Pluto!

861
01:11:58,357 --> 01:11:59,984
Good morning, Truman.

862
01:12:00,067 --> 01:12:02,820
- Look who's here.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

863
01:12:03,112 --> 01:12:04,238
Every single day.

864
01:12:04,322 --> 01:12:07,241
The policy, we've thought about it
and we're gonna take it.

865
01:12:07,325 --> 01:12:08,618
- You're kidding?
- No!

866
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:11,454
Why don't we go up to my office
right now and we'll sign the papers?

867
01:12:11,537 --> 01:12:14,165
Next week would be much better.

868
01:12:14,248 --> 01:12:17,460
- All right. See you guys.
- Okay, bye now. See you next week.

869
01:12:17,543 --> 01:12:20,213
- Give me something to look forward to.
- You got it.

870
01:12:20,296 --> 01:12:22,006
See, this isn't about insurance.

871
01:12:22,423 --> 01:12:26,594
This is about the great variable:
when will death occur?

872
01:12:26,928 --> 01:12:29,013
Could be a week, a month, a year.

873
01:12:30,056 --> 01:12:31,307
Could be today.

874
01:12:33,559 --> 01:12:35,853
"Sunbather, minding his own business,

875
01:12:36,687 --> 01:12:39,774
"stabbed in the heart by the tip
of a runaway beach umbrella."

876
01:12:39,857 --> 01:12:42,401
No way to guard against
that kind of thing.

877
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:46,030
Sorry, excuse me.

878
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,533
Truman, this is Vivien.
Vivien, this is Truman.

879
01:12:48,616 --> 01:12:50,952
The two of you are gonna be neighbors.

880
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:58,751
I guess what I'm saying is that life is

881
01:12:59,544 --> 01:13:00,795
fragile.

882
01:13:02,547 --> 01:13:04,173
- Vivien, your office.
- Sorry.

883
01:13:04,257 --> 01:13:07,301
What's that? I'm sorry.

884
01:13:08,344 --> 01:13:09,470
You do?

885
01:13:10,346 --> 01:13:13,307
Great. Let me take your information.

886
01:13:29,615 --> 01:13:31,242
Ready, 2. Go to 2.

887
01:13:35,705 --> 01:13:37,164
And back to medium.

888
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,585
And wide.

889
01:13:48,593 --> 01:13:51,345
I was just trying to train the kid to...

890
01:13:52,263 --> 01:13:53,598
Never mind.

891
01:13:56,809 --> 01:13:58,853
What's he doing in the basement?

892
01:13:59,145 --> 01:14:01,647
He moved down there
after Meryl packed up and left.

893
01:14:01,731 --> 01:14:03,149
Why wasn't I told?

894
01:14:03,232 --> 01:14:05,860
Any unpredictable behavior
has to be reported.

895
01:14:07,278 --> 01:14:09,155
He's just sleeping, I thought.

896
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:11,782
- This the best shot we've got?
- What's to see?

897
01:14:11,866 --> 01:14:15,494
- What's on the clock cam?
- It's an obstruction.

898
01:14:15,995 --> 01:14:19,749
- What happened down there?
- He was just tidying up his garbage.

899
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:24,712
I was gonna call you, but halfway
through, he gave up, and he fell asleep.

900
01:14:25,087 --> 01:14:28,257
I wanna check on the setups
for the insurance convention tomorrow.

901
01:14:28,341 --> 01:14:29,717
- Yes.
- Yeah.

902
01:14:30,718 --> 01:14:32,053
Nice move.

903
01:14:41,145 --> 01:14:42,396
There you go.

904
01:14:53,366 --> 01:14:54,742
Isolate the audio.

905
01:14:56,077 --> 01:14:58,079
Give me a close-up on his torso.

906
01:15:00,915 --> 01:15:02,416
He's still breathing.

907
01:15:04,627 --> 01:15:06,295
Where's Chloe? Call him.

908
01:15:06,504 --> 01:15:09,757
- What do you want me to say?
- Tell him it's a wrong number.

909
01:15:13,219 --> 01:15:14,804
What took you so long?

910
01:15:15,262 --> 01:15:17,807
Just had to wait for it. They were busy.

911
01:15:18,724 --> 01:15:21,143
Here. What's going on?

912
01:15:21,977 --> 01:15:23,729
I don't know. They're...

913
01:15:23,896 --> 01:15:26,857
He came down into the room. He did
nothing but stand around for a while.

914
01:15:26,941 --> 01:15:28,442
Shut up and watch it.

915
01:15:29,068 --> 01:15:31,153
Then we went to night vision.

916
01:15:31,946 --> 01:15:33,364
He's asleep.

917
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,242
- There!
- What?

918
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:38,411
- Zoom in.
- On which?

919
01:15:38,744 --> 01:15:40,329
Under the chair there.

920
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:44,125
Enhance it.

921
01:15:46,669 --> 01:15:49,171
- Is it...
- My God.

922
01:15:50,965 --> 01:15:54,093
He couldn't have gone up the stairs.
He must still be in the room.

923
01:15:54,176 --> 01:15:55,803
- Get Marlon over there.
- Right away.

924
01:16:11,485 --> 01:16:12,653
Truman!

925
01:16:13,529 --> 01:16:14,822
Surprise party!

926
01:16:16,866 --> 01:16:18,159
Come on, buddy.

927
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:21,537
I got a six-pack of cold brewskis
with our name on them.

928
01:16:21,662 --> 01:16:23,956
Come on, pal. Come on, buddy.

929
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,044
Shit.

930
01:16:32,339 --> 01:16:34,842
Marlon, find him. He's still in the room.

931
01:16:39,221 --> 01:16:41,140
<i>Come out, come out, wherever you are.</i>

932
01:16:41,223 --> 01:16:43,017
That's good. Keep it light.

933
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:46,395
<i>I know you're in here.
I'm gonna find you.</i>

934
01:16:49,982 --> 01:16:51,567
Check under the table.

935
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,612
The closet, behind you.

936
01:16:58,616 --> 01:16:59,617
Huh.

937
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:02,411
Gee.

938
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:05,498
I wonder where he could possibly be.

939
01:17:13,422 --> 01:17:15,674
The lawn cam, get me the lawn cam.

940
01:17:23,349 --> 01:17:26,018
Don't look in the camera.
Say something. Keep it going.

941
01:17:26,101 --> 01:17:27,228
<i>He's gone.</i>

942
01:17:27,728 --> 01:17:29,563
- Cut transmission!
- Cut transmission?

943
01:17:29,647 --> 01:17:30,898
Cut it!

944
01:17:33,275 --> 01:17:35,152
Jesus! God in heaven!

945
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:39,073
- Everything's black.
- Give me the phone.

946
01:17:51,919 --> 01:17:54,129
I don't know where he is, but he's gone.

947
01:18:00,511 --> 01:18:03,597
All right. We've got
every available extra looking for him.

948
01:18:03,681 --> 01:18:07,977
The principals are helping out. The
crew, too. So every sector's covered.

949
01:18:08,644 --> 01:18:11,355
- What about prop cars?
- Yes, they've been accounted for.

950
01:18:11,438 --> 01:18:12,857
He has to be on foot.

951
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:15,860
He has the world's most
recognizable face. He can't disappear.

952
01:18:51,729 --> 01:18:52,813
Go.

953
01:18:53,689 --> 01:18:57,318
Hunt him. Yeah. Go find him, Pluto.

954
01:18:57,902 --> 01:18:59,111
Good dog!

955
01:18:59,194 --> 01:19:00,446
All this fuss.

956
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,282
If he could just hear my voice.

957
01:19:04,241 --> 01:19:05,451
Truman!

958
01:19:08,579 --> 01:19:10,873
Let me try. Truman!

959
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:14,001
It's me, Dad!

960
01:19:16,295 --> 01:19:17,504
Let's talk.

961
01:19:19,173 --> 01:19:20,674
Yeah, I know.

962
01:19:22,384 --> 01:19:24,303
Just about done with the square.

963
01:19:24,386 --> 01:19:26,972
<i>Got to go back to Barrymore,
check the interiors.</i>

964
01:19:27,056 --> 01:19:29,266
<i>- He's got to be in there.</i>
- Barrymore.

965
01:19:29,683 --> 01:19:31,810
But what about the college?
Who's watching that?

966
01:19:31,894 --> 01:19:32,895
<i>I don't know.</i>

967
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:35,314
- Send somebody over there, okay?
<i>- All right.</i>

968
01:19:39,568 --> 01:19:41,946
Take another man
and get down there now, all right?

969
01:19:42,029 --> 01:19:44,281
I don't give a damn.
Just find the son of a bitch.

970
01:19:44,365 --> 01:19:45,324
Get some batteries.

971
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,118
This guy's not gonna glow in the dark.
Get them down here.

972
01:19:48,202 --> 01:19:50,913
I don't know what's going on.
Reroute it back to me.

973
01:19:50,996 --> 01:19:54,208
We need more light.
We'll never find him this way.

974
01:19:59,505 --> 01:20:00,881
What time is it?

975
01:20:01,215 --> 01:20:03,509
It's way too early for that.

976
01:20:10,224 --> 01:20:11,392
Cue the sun.

977
01:20:17,982 --> 01:20:19,358
What time is it?

978
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:22,069
Christof, what's going on?

979
01:20:22,611 --> 01:20:25,572
Did you know there's a rumor
circulating that he's dead?

980
01:20:25,656 --> 01:20:26,824
You hear me?

981
01:20:26,907 --> 01:20:29,201
The media is having a feeding frenzy
over this.

982
01:20:29,284 --> 01:20:31,036
All the phone lines are jammed,

983
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,705
and every network has a pirated shot

984
01:20:32,788 --> 01:20:35,040
of Marlon making an ass of himself
in front of the camera.

985
01:20:35,124 --> 01:20:37,334
The sponsors are threatening
to rip up their contracts.

986
01:20:37,418 --> 01:20:38,836
Why? We're getting higher ratings
with this graphic

987
01:20:38,919 --> 01:20:42,006
than we've ever had on this show.

988
01:20:44,925 --> 01:20:46,218
<i>No sign of him.</i>

989
01:20:46,385 --> 01:20:49,179
Marlon, why don't you head back to town
and join the others?

990
01:20:49,263 --> 01:20:52,224
Everyone else is at first positions, okay?
Thank you.

991
01:20:53,767 --> 01:20:55,978
Everyone's at first positions, right?

992
01:21:11,368 --> 01:21:14,872
We've got the light.
So he's got to be there somewhere.

993
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:19,376
We're not watching the sea.

994
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:22,004
Hang on a minute.
Why would we watch the sea?

995
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:23,964
Sweep the harbor.

996
01:21:24,131 --> 01:21:25,674
Bring up the harbor cameras.

997
01:21:25,758 --> 01:21:28,093
Shift all harbor cameras to computer,
please.

998
01:21:28,177 --> 01:21:29,803
Some of those are out, aren't they?

999
01:21:29,887 --> 01:21:33,307
Yeah. We have four of them down,
but we have the lighthouse cameras up.

1000
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:35,851
- All buoy cams, please.
- What's happening?

1001
01:21:36,977 --> 01:21:38,604
Long-lens, shore-based cameras.

1002
01:21:38,687 --> 01:21:40,731
- Why are we looking at the water?
- Good.

1003
01:21:40,814 --> 01:21:42,649
Pan and zoom please.

1004
01:21:46,111 --> 01:21:47,321
Truman,

1005
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:50,991
where are you going?

1006
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:54,828
How can he sail? He's in insurance.

1007
01:21:54,912 --> 01:21:57,414
- Isn't he terrified of the water?
- Resume transmission.

1008
01:21:57,498 --> 01:21:59,083
Resuming transmission.

1009
01:22:04,296 --> 01:22:07,424
- I got 2-to-1 he doesn't make it.
- I want a piece of that.

1010
01:22:07,508 --> 01:22:09,593
2-to-1 he doesn't make it.

1011
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:13,680
Just leave them in the car.

1012
01:22:26,735 --> 01:22:30,614
Let's get off this mast shot. We can't
see his face. Go to the cabin cam.

1013
01:22:33,617 --> 01:22:35,160
There. Perfect.

1014
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,663
That's our hero shot.

1015
01:23:03,272 --> 01:23:05,065
Let's get another boat out there.

1016
01:23:05,149 --> 01:23:08,402
Okay. Listen, Gus, I need you to talk
to the guys on the ferry.

1017
01:23:08,485 --> 01:23:11,029
Come on. Get it moving.
Get it out of here.

1018
01:23:13,282 --> 01:23:14,533
Come on.

1019
01:23:15,117 --> 01:23:18,745
- I'm usually the bus driver.
- Bottom line is they can't drive the boat.

1020
01:23:18,954 --> 01:23:20,247
They're actors.

1021
01:23:24,710 --> 01:23:26,170
How do we stop him?

1022
01:23:36,597 --> 01:23:37,806
Okay.

1023
01:23:40,309 --> 01:23:43,937
We're going to be accessing
the weather program now.

1024
01:23:44,605 --> 01:23:48,275
So hold onto your hats. You got that?

1025
01:23:48,775 --> 01:23:52,946
No. I think we're gonna want to localize
the storm over the boat.

1026
01:23:56,033 --> 01:23:58,035
You can get the coordinates for that.

1027
01:23:58,118 --> 01:24:00,746
There's no rescue boat.
He won't know what to do.

1028
01:24:00,829 --> 01:24:03,123
He'll turn back. He'll be too afraid.

1029
01:24:06,543 --> 01:24:07,920
Thar she blows.

1030
01:24:19,765 --> 01:24:20,933
Come on.

1031
01:24:44,665 --> 01:24:46,166
Give me some lightning.

1032
01:24:47,334 --> 01:24:48,418
Again.

1033
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:50,212
Hit him again!

1034
01:25:01,932 --> 01:25:04,184
For God's sake,
the whole world is watching.

1035
01:25:04,268 --> 01:25:06,436
We can't let him die
in front of a live audience.

1036
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,355
He was born in front of a live audience.

1037
01:25:36,967 --> 01:25:38,802
Come on, Truman!

1038
01:25:42,389 --> 01:25:44,725
You can do it! Hold on!

1039
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,085
Is that the best you can do?

1040
01:26:13,628 --> 01:26:16,757
You're gonna have to kill me!

1041
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:20,177
<i>What shall we do with a drunken sailor?</i>

1042
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:22,846
- I demand that you cease transmission.
- Keep running.

1043
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:27,267
<i>What shall we do with a drunken sailor
Early in the mornin'?</i>

1044
01:26:27,476 --> 01:26:30,020
Increase the wind.

1045
01:26:32,439 --> 01:26:34,900
- I'm telling you for the last time.
- How close is he?

1046
01:26:34,983 --> 01:26:36,401
- Very close.
- Capsize him. Tip him over.

1047
01:26:36,485 --> 01:26:39,363
- Damn you, Christof!
- You can't. He's tied himself to the boat!

1048
01:26:39,446 --> 01:26:40,447
Shut up!

1049
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:42,324
He's gonna drown,
and he doesn't even care.

1050
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:43,533
- Do it.
- No.

1051
01:26:43,617 --> 01:26:44,618
Do it!

1052
01:27:39,297 --> 01:27:40,549
That's enough.

1053
01:31:51,591 --> 01:31:53,134
I want to talk to him.

1054
01:32:12,112 --> 01:32:13,321
Truman.

1055
01:32:15,115 --> 01:32:16,408
You can speak.

1056
01:32:18,493 --> 01:32:19,786
<i>I can hear you.</i>

1057
01:32:24,332 --> 01:32:25,458
Who are you?

1058
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:28,128
I am the creator of a television show

1059
01:32:28,211 --> 01:32:31,214
that gives hope and joy and inspiration
to millions.

1060
01:32:36,136 --> 01:32:37,387
<i>Then who am I?</i>

1061
01:32:37,804 --> 01:32:39,180
You're the star.

1062
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:46,646
<i>Was nothing real?</i>

1063
01:32:47,272 --> 01:32:48,523
You were real.

1064
01:32:49,983 --> 01:32:52,277
That's what made you so good to watch.

1065
01:32:52,986 --> 01:32:54,529
Listen to me, Truman.

1066
01:32:54,654 --> 01:32:56,823
There's no more truth out there

1067
01:32:57,907 --> 01:33:00,535
than there is in the world
I created for you.

1068
01:33:02,495 --> 01:33:04,038
<i>The same lies,</i>

1069
01:33:05,749 --> 01:33:07,083
<i>the same deceit.</i>

1070
01:33:08,042 --> 01:33:09,461
But in my world

1071
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:13,006
you have nothing to fear.

1072
01:33:16,384 --> 01:33:18,928
<i>I know you better than
you know yourself.</i>

1073
01:33:19,012 --> 01:33:21,139
You never had a camera in my head.

1074
01:33:22,932 --> 01:33:24,184
You're afraid.

1075
01:33:25,477 --> 01:33:27,270
That's why you can't leave.

1076
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:33,359
It's okay, Truman.

1077
01:33:34,486 --> 01:33:35,737
I understand.

1078
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:40,033
I have been watching you
your whole life.

1079
01:33:42,827 --> 01:33:44,954
I was watching when you were born.

1080
01:33:47,373 --> 01:33:49,918
I was watching
when you took your first step.

1081
01:33:54,214 --> 01:33:56,716
<i>I watched you on your first day
of school.</i>

1082
01:33:59,594 --> 01:34:02,138
The episode when you lost
your first tooth.

1083
01:34:06,601 --> 01:34:08,311
You can't leave, Truman.

1084
01:34:09,938 --> 01:34:11,356
Please, God.

1085
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:12,899
<i>You belong here...</i>

1086
01:34:13,107 --> 01:34:14,317
You can do it.

1087
01:34:16,236 --> 01:34:17,445
...with me.

1088
01:34:19,948 --> 01:34:21,241
Talk to me.

1089
01:34:22,617 --> 01:34:23,868
Say something.

1090
01:34:28,289 --> 01:34:31,417
Say something, God damn it.
You're on television.

1091
01:34:31,793 --> 01:34:33,795
<i>You're live to the whole world.</i>

1092
01:34:51,437 --> 01:34:53,273
In case I don't see you,

1093
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,985
good afternoon, good evening,
and good night.

1094
01:35:00,196 --> 01:35:01,239
Yeah.

1095
01:35:24,345 --> 01:35:25,763
Yeah!

1096
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:38,526
- He made it! Yeah!
- All right, Truman!

1097
01:35:48,369 --> 01:35:50,872
- Cease transmission.
- Ceasing transmission.

1098
01:35:55,585 --> 01:35:57,879
- You want another slice?
- No. I'm okay.

1099
01:35:58,713 --> 01:36:00,715
What else is on?
Where's the <i>TV Guide?</i>
