1
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,400
<i>My name is Wolverine.</i>

2
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:15,190
<i>I'm the best there is at what I do,
but what I do isn't very nice.</i>

3
00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:27,470
What the...?

4
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:49,610
What the hell happened?

5
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,140
Oh, yeah.

6
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:12,082
Hulk vs. Wolverine

7
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,890
Four Hours Ago

8
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,342
Sir, I know I'm not supposed
to ask questions...

9
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:39,631
...but who are you?

10
00:02:44,045 --> 00:02:46,163
No one you wanna know, kid.

11
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:10,266
Looks like someone had a bad day.

12
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:17,330
<i>Copy. Still searching for any survivors.</i>

13
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,940
It happened about 4 hours ago,
just before dawn.

14
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:28,480
A creature has sighted
crossing US-Canadian border.

15
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,280
This is what happened
when it reached civilization.

16
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:33,605
Creature?

17
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:35,901
The Americans call it the Hulk.

18
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:38,092
Intel sketchy.

19
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:41,756
Department H. thinks the US military
is covering something up.

20
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:01,124
He smells toxic.

21
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,058
Gun powder too.

22
00:04:04,188 --> 00:04:07,600
Well... Someone tried to fight back.

23
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,393
<i>Welcome Elkford.</i>

24
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:13,748
Guess they didn't fight hard enough.

25
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:16,151
Department H. wants you
to find and stop the Hulk...

26
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,344
...before he reaches
another town or city.

27
00:04:19,148 --> 00:04:21,165
And if you can't stop it, kill it!

28
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:24,611
Sounds like fun.

29
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,390
Sir, I think we got something.

30
00:04:46,748 --> 00:04:49,785
- Do you want us try for a landing?
- Don't bother.

31
00:06:45,303 --> 00:06:46,814
Why always that?

32
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,580
Hey, Bub.

33
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,726
You haven't seen a big monster
running around anywhere, have you?

34
00:06:57,515 --> 00:07:00,273
No! Stay back!
Stay away from me!

35
00:07:00,626 --> 00:07:01,605
Stay back!

36
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,505
Relax, cry baby.
I ain't gonna...

37
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:13,819
You smell toxic!

38
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:21,885
Who are you?

39
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:25,871
Please, I'm begging you.
Leave me alone!

40
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:28,808
For your own sake, please, go!

41
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:30,660
You are in terrible danger!

42
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:35,960
Here is the deal, misty.

43
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:39,711
There is a third claw that's gonna come out
if you don't start talking.

44
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,011
Oh, hell!

45
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:03,039
I don't suppose you got any interest
to talking this out.

46
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:19,552
What the hell happened?

47
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:28,027
Oh, yeah.

48
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:32,016
Let's do this!

49
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:34,355
Come on!

50
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:46,896
Hulk smash little man!

51
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:50,918
Little man leave Hulk alone!

52
00:09:54,473 --> 00:09:59,859
Hulk is strongest there is!

53
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:36,792
Okay, Bub.
Let's try that again.

54
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,888
Thanks runt.

55
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,099
We've been trying
to take him down for weeks.

56
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:32,480
Logan, buddy!

57
00:11:32,952 --> 00:11:35,819
It's me, Deadpool!
I shot you!

58
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,375
What are you looking at?

59
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,045
Prepare the lab.
We are on our way.

60
00:12:07,782 --> 00:12:10,820
His vital signs are increasing.
He's waking up.

61
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:22,651
Now, Mrs. Hynes, begin
the adamantium bonding process.

62
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:24,613
- Yes, professor.
- Commencing infusion.

63
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:36,859
- The vitals are erratic but holding.
- Excellent!

64
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:39,254
Increase to maximum.

65
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:20,592
Weapon-X's mental conditioning
and reprogramming are at stage 5.

66
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:22,848
Begin combat assessment.

67
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,963
I don't care how long you had him
professor, this is a mistake.

68
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,438
I know him.
He can't be controlled.

69
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,036
You have his DNA,
so just let me kill him.

70
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:44,939
I'll take that
under advisement, Sabertooth.

71
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,746
Prepare your team for the mission.

72
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,517
Your funeral.

73
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:05,013
What do you say after the mission
we kill all those flooding babies?

74
00:14:05,824 --> 00:14:08,150
Do you ever shut up, Wilson?

75
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,967
What? Babies creep me out.

76
00:14:12,108 --> 00:14:13,220
Good bye, bamm!

77
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:20,908
He's fighting to programming.

78
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:26,274
We are losing control!
Increase the dosage!

79
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:30,190
Initiate lock down procedures
and someone activate Sabertooth!

80
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:39,804
Guards! Guards!

81
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,075
Wakey wakey time!

82
00:15:16,352 --> 00:15:18,492
Logan!
We missed you!

83
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:21,340
The Weapon-X just hasn't been
the same without you.

84
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:26,809
Nobody calls me Bub anymore.
And Omega Red is a bed wetter.

85
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:33,278
One day I will tear up
your flipping tongue, Wilson.

86
00:15:34,445 --> 00:15:36,171
He's very ashamed.

87
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,116
Despite Deadpool's idiocy,...

88
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:43,737
...Weapon-X is indeed pleased
to have you back, Logan.

89
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:47,081
We put considerable time
and money into you.

90
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:48,522
And pointy things.

91
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:53,827
You're our best operative, Wolverine.
So disappointing.

92
00:15:54,147 --> 00:15:56,094
But you did lead us to Dr. Banner.

93
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:58,665
Of course, you know him better as,...

94
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,000
...the Hulk.

95
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:02,702
I shot him in the ass.
With one of these.

96
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,508
What? I did.

97
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:08,475
Weapon-X has been pursuing
the Hulk for weeks.

98
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:30,414
Unfortunately, there was
some collateral damage.

99
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,944
If only Department H.
had sent you in sooner...

100
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,263
...who knows how much destruction
could have been avoided?

101
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:39,707
What do you want with the Hulk?

102
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,900
We just wanna help him
find his happy place.

103
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:44,763
Did you see how angry he was?

104
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,239
I'm sorry, but come on.
I think his fancy...

105
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,410
We want the same thing
we wanted with you, Logan.

106
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:57,110
A weapon.

107
00:16:57,492 --> 00:17:00,577
I'll erase Banner's memories
and reprogram him...

108
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,380
...just like I did you.

109
00:17:02,794 --> 00:17:07,605
And then Weapon-X will have the most
powerful creature on the planet.

110
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:09,893
At our disposal.

111
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,236
You shoulda kill me,
when you had a chance.

112
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:16,779
Because I'm gonna get out of here.

113
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:19,118
I'm gonna kill all of them.

114
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,927
And then I'm gonna cut out your heart.

115
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,113
Wolverine, after I'm done with you...

116
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:32,305
...you won't even remember
this conversation.

117
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:36,488
I've erased your life before,
and I'm gonna do it again.

118
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:41,314
All you'll know is that you
belong to Weapon-X.

119
00:17:41,557 --> 00:17:44,573
Now and forever.

120
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,675
That was so not cool.

121
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:53,648
I hate that guy.

122
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:56,681
Ah, Wolverine.

123
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:58,448
You look so sad.

124
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:01,359
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,...

125
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,400
...Lady Deathstrike tried to kill you
while you were asleep.

126
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:07,131
Better than having listen to you.

127
00:18:07,562 --> 00:18:09,047
Man, she hates you.

128
00:18:09,396 --> 00:18:10,908
I mean, we all hate you.

129
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:15,289
But Deathstrike really, really,
really hates you.

130
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:18,857
Hey, still have that unbreakable skull?

131
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:23,181
Ow, damn it!

132
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,675
You will die today, Logan-san.

133
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,193
It does not matter
what the professor says.

134
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,815
These are your last breaths.

135
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,969
What are you doing here, Deathstrike?

136
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:00,809
I'm about to start
Wolverine's reprogramming.

137
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:02,691
He has to die!

138
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:06,609
How many times do I have to have
this conversation with you?

139
00:19:07,002 --> 00:19:08,616
He's more valuable alive and...

140
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:25,557
Sorry Prof, gotta go
with the lady on this one.

141
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:55,370
I gotta love our healing factors.

142
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:59,361
I'm gonna enjoy killing you for days.

143
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,262
And then I think we'll drop the Hulk
on an orphanage or something...

144
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,350
...just for fun.

145
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:09,955
Gaijin dog!

146
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,226
For the dishonour you've caused
my family, you will suffer.

147
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:18,513
And then you will die.

148
00:20:20,124 --> 00:20:21,687
Sweetheart...

149
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,045
...you and your family can take your honour
and shove it up your bony little...

150
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:31,950
Deathstrike, don't!

151
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,153
Target located in Zone-23.

152
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:26,782
Take him down!

153
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:43,692
Back up! We need back up!

154
00:21:56,374 --> 00:22:00,535
Well, he's alive but I think
he's gonna need some serious TLC.

155
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:04,387
The last thing the professor said
before the runt cutted him,...

156
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,273
...was for us to kill Wolverine.

157
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:08,719
Really?

158
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:10,993
You buy that?

159
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:13,982
Yeah, you know, I would think
the last thing he said was...

160
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:15,397
..."Ah, Sabretooth!"

161
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:19,200
We kill Wolverine now.
That is all that matters.

162
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,107
Whatever you say ponytail.
I'm in the mood for a little murder.

163
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:25,020
Strike a pose!

164
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:54,802
Get it together.
We're gonna have company soon.

165
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,405
Please!
Please, I'm begging you.

166
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,147
You have to help me.
You have to get me outta here!

167
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,428
If these people turn Hulk into a weapon
millions of people will die.

168
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:11,119
So I should just kill you now,
that's what your saying right?

169
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,911
Come on, weepy.

170
00:23:20,371 --> 00:23:22,126
You don't know what it's like.

171
00:23:22,621 --> 00:23:24,949
I've been hunted
for as long as I can remember.

172
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,645
And I can't control it.

173
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:30,649
- The monster, it...
- Bub, do I look like I give a...

174
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:52,955
Please, struggle....

175
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:56,670
...until make your death taste
so much sweeter.

176
00:23:58,622 --> 00:24:01,922
- No!
- Yes, as in yes.

177
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:03,467
You're going to die.

178
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:06,563
Bang! Just kidding.

179
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,889
Click, click.

180
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,979
No! That was my favourite gun.

181
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:27,675
What the hell is the matter with you?
Do your thing!

182
00:24:27,781 --> 00:24:30,808
We need your big green friend
out here right frigging now!

183
00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:31,847
What?

184
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:32,943
No!

185
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:36,704
What do you mean, no?

186
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:40,172
Even if that was a good idea, I can't.

187
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:44,759
The transformation happens
when I feel angry or stressed.

188
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,807
Now, they...
They must have drugged me.

189
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:52,028
Something's suppressing my adrenaline.
It comes from the cortex.

190
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,473
Maybe that will help speed things up.

191
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:04,211
If you wanna cry now,
I say go for it.

192
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,692
Gaijin!

193
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,892
End of the line runt.

194
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:13,760
- Got any last words?
- Yeah. Two.

195
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:22,295
Let's dance.

196
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,363
I've been waiting for this a long time.

197
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:35,938
Yeah, well you can keep waiting!

198
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,980
Banzai!

199
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:58,106
Dude, that is just not cool.

200
00:25:59,735 --> 00:26:02,448
Wow! Look at that.

201
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:05,036
Could you give me a hand?

202
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,304
I'm kidding.
Alright, I'll go get it.

203
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:21,734
Alright, there we go.
No, that's... That's not right.

204
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:23,004
What the hell?

205
00:26:26,778 --> 00:26:28,538
Oh god, now it's upside down.

206
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:39,670
There she is.

207
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:41,204
Sweet.

208
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:12,007
I'm gonna kill you!

209
00:27:30,621 --> 00:27:35,121
Hulk smash claw people!

210
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:40,367
Oh, no! Why me?

211
00:28:11,665 --> 00:28:16,202
The next one will be through
your brain stem, Logan-san.

212
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:26,797
Little man.

213
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,451
Hey!

214
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,335
Hey, I'm on your side
you flaming idiot.

215
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,130
Hey, wait for me!

216
00:28:53,492 --> 00:28:55,992
Who wants snacks?
You do.

217
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,128
Logan, I think we lost him.

218
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:13,130
And they lived happily ever after,
except the Hulk.

219
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:16,380
Bub, you just made him angrier.

220
00:29:25,438 --> 00:29:28,360
Talking man hurt Hulk!

221
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:33,548
Hulk rip-off talking man's head!

222
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,449
My head? Oh, crap.

223
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:40,935
- He's all yours, Einstein.
- No, Logan. We're friends.

224
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:43,356
No, no!

225
00:30:01,348 --> 00:30:03,361
Ugly girl scratch Hulk!

226
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,140
Go for it big guy, tear this whole
god forsaken place down to the ground.

227
00:32:00,806 --> 00:32:02,326
Do it!

228
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:26,839
Great.

229
00:32:37,468 --> 00:32:40,572
Alright Bub, where were we?

230
00:32:55,055 --> 00:33:01,055
(Not finished! Keep watching)

231
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:36,017
Guys?

232
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,589
Hey, Red! Deathstrike!

233
00:36:39,705 --> 00:36:42,480
I can't believe it.
I'm alive!

234
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:45,741
I'm ali...

235
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:54,224
Ouch!
