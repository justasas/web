00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,440
It's cool!

3
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:43,532
Let the singing begin

4
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:48,230
<i>Sing it out loud</i>

5
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:53,456
<i>I'll sing it to the entire town</i>

6
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,554
<i>Panpipes and lutes get me in the mood</i>

7
00:01:01,672 --> 00:01:03,911
<i>Every time I hear it, it makes me move</i>

8
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:08,260
<i>From your voice heard through the roof</i>

9
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:10,070
<i>My folk-girl, you are amazing</i>

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,840
<i>Your moves are groovy, oh my darling</i>

11
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,440
<i>I'm a city rocker in town...</i>

12
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,081
<i>When I saw you, my heart melted</i>

13
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:31,112
<i>Your crystal voice grips my soul</i>

14
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:34,732
<i>Singing with you would make me whole</i>

15
00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:42,453
<i>I'm right here hoping you'll look at me</i>

16
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,698
<i>Seeing you'd make me very happy</i>

17
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:55,890
<i>I'm falling head over heels, or so it seems</i>

18
00:01:56,177 --> 00:02:01,867
<i>I'd do anything
to see you in my dreams</i>

19
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:15,773
Superb. I'll get it for you.

20
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,234
Cheers! Cheers!

21
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:21,084
Great!

22
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,284
Tao!

23
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:38,921
Hey Tao!

24
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,703
My turn!

25
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:03,710
<i>I have no fear of rain or sky!</i>

26
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:10,239
<i>Always stand tall... up to the sky!</i>

27
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,179
<i>Thunder crashing!</i>

28
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:19,395
<i>Lightning flashing!</i>

29
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:23,653
<i>I still stand tall!</i>

30
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:27,429
<i>Against them all!</i>

31
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:31,934
Hey!

32
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:32,858
What the hell?

33
00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:33,898
Hey!

34
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:38,184
<i>My name is Tao.
I love singing "Lightning Rod".</i>

35
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,800
<i>But I don't know why my singing
annoys some people.</i>

36
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:46,437
Sir, please...

37
00:03:47,155 --> 00:03:48,522
Please don't make this ugly.

38
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:51,439
Who's ugly?!?!

39
00:03:54,942 --> 00:04:01,070
Get out!

40
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:06,621
<i>This is Tun, a good friend of mine.</i>

41
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,655
<i>We've been friends since primary school.</i>

42
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:13,366
<i>His dad's name was "Tai".
I've never seen his mom.</i>

43
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:16,257
<i>According to his dad, she ran off
with a guy when he was young.</i>

44
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:19,317
<i>His dad was a well-known amulet expert.</i>

45
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:21,517
<i>Everyone in the country knew him.</i>

46
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:23,496
<i>But after Guru Tai passed away...</i>

47
00:04:23,744 --> 00:04:27,168
<i>Tun ran his dad's amulet store,
halfheartedly.</i>

48
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:31,100
<i>He's never had faith in the legacy
his dad passed on to him.</i>

49
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:34,108
<i>Instead his faith was in a shell of lust...</i>

50
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,481
<i>The thing which romantics
have beautifully labeled as "Love".</i>

51
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,955
<i>Tun had a deep belief in love.</i>

52
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:42,246
<i>His belief was beyond faith.</i>

53
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:48,613
<i>But one day his faith was
destroyed by a girl.</i>

54
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:57,963
<i>A girl named...</i>

55
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,502
<i>"Maew"</i>

56
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:12,560
<i>He was devastated,
and has since then kept to himself,</i>

57
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,762
<i>disconnected from
his social life and friends.</i>

58
00:05:19,017 --> 00:05:24,955
<i>If he isn't possessed by his dad's spirit,
it must be the environment.</i>

59
00:05:26,296 --> 00:05:28,640
<i>Since then, he has become
an expert on amulets.</i>

60
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:31,205
<i>And turned himself into an amulet guru...</i>

61
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:35,189
<i>widely respected in Pattaya,
just like his dad.</i>

62
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,395
<i>He makes a living from people's beliefs.</i>

63
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:43,028
<i>Frank Edward Muller used to say...</i>

64
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:45,762
<i>"Belief is the cause of faith".</i>

65
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:48,978
<i>And faith is the thing
that makes miracles happen.</i>

66
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:56,439
<i>Sometimes there is a fine line
between miracle and coincidence,</i>

67
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:03,561
<i>as thin as the line between
faith and obsession.</i>

68
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:06,517
It's real.

69
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,304
Can you sign to authenticate it?

70
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:10,749
I can.

71
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:27,390
Thank you.
See you then.

72
00:06:27,676 --> 00:06:28,676
Good luck.

73
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:43,587
Not working today?

74
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:45,423
It's a holiday.

75
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,322
Actually...

76
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:51,100
it's a rich man's holiday.

77
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,207
What's this?

78
00:06:57,272 --> 00:07:00,840
All the money I owe you... 30,000 baht.

79
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,887
Where did you get it?

80
00:07:04,473 --> 00:07:05,473
Oh?

81
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,519
you won the soccer bet.

82
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:11,322
Why? You thought I was
gonna lose forever?

83
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:15,371
Tonight, I'll take you out
for a Thank You Party.

84
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:18,496
Thank You Party?
Like the other night?

85
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:22,468
No, thanks. I don't wanna get hurt.

86
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:29,772
This is a hi-fi karaoke bar
with a great sound system.

87
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,913
It's cool, man.
I've already asked Ped and Kai.

88
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:35,885
No, man.

89
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,895
Don't be a prisoner in your own home.

90
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,252
Just get out and see the world.

91
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:49,460
Maew isn't the only fish in the sea,
you know?

92
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:54,890
Okay. I just wanted to invite you
to a karaoke bar.

93
00:07:55,103 --> 00:07:56,999
You always stay at home.

94
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:00,099
Last time you didn't have
a chance to sing, right?

95
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:04,033
Come on. It's my treat.

96
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:05,405
Where?

97
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,715
Pattaya Karaoke.

98
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:09,955
Can you promise me one thing?

99
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:11,127
What is it?

100
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,653
Don't sing "Lightning Rod".

101
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:18,470
<i>What if I get lost, going alone?</i>

102
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:23,002
<i>I can't fulfill dreams on my own</i>

103
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:27,728
<i>When I'm blue I want someone to talk to</i>

104
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,843
<i>The big question is who.
I don't have a clue</i>

105
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:36,869
<i>Would you be my guy,
if you don't mind</i>

106
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:40,723
<i>I have had a crush on you,
since forever</i>

107
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:45,775
<i>If it's no trouble,
let's put our hearts together</i>

108
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,162
<i>Just think of it as a favor</i>

109
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,270
Your voice is terrific.

110
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,556
No "Lightning Rod"!

111
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:18,858
Okay, bro.

112
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:35,222
That baldy has bad taste.

113
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:37,767
Oh, your taste is fucking good.

114
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:42,051
Who requested this song?

115
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,942
My song.

116
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,350
Fucker.
This damn song again?

117
00:09:57,793 --> 00:10:01,504
<i>Big boob girl, dancing, dangling.
What a beauty!...</i>

118
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:03,861
What the hell is this?

119
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:06,478
<i>Actually, "she's" a "he" with HIV!</i>

120
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:08,106
A troublemaker's song.

121
00:10:09,212 --> 00:10:13,054
<i>Gets his dick cut off.
Trying to be a heart-throb</i>

122
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:13,809
<i>Hate fagots!</i>

123
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:15,617
<i>Hate fagots!</i>

124
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:17,361
<i>Hate fagots!</i>

125
00:10:18,197 --> 00:10:19,655
<i>Hate fagots!
Ahhhhh!</i>

126
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:20,864
<i>Hate fagots!</i>

127
00:10:22,572 --> 00:10:23,572
<i>Hate fagots!</i>

128
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:26,379
Did your father die?

129
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:31,699
I'm just getting in the mood here.

130
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,952
Stop it!
You're scaring the customers away.

131
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,892
Or you want to get me fired?

132
00:10:36,524 --> 00:10:39,564
There'll be no more songs for any of you.

133
00:10:45,393 --> 00:10:46,869
Serves you right.

134
00:10:51,205 --> 00:10:54,421
It's your fault that
I haven't sung yet.

135
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:56,869
I didn't sing "Lightning Rod".

136
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,705
No, you didn't.

137
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,022
This is nastier.

138
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:02,272
That's not it.

139
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:05,423
Chang is prejudiced.

140
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:09,733
If I sang the National Anthem,
he'd still pick on me.

141
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,413
Damn it. Let's get out of here.

142
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:14,785
Whoa! I haven't sung a song yet.

143
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:17,377
If I can't sing, neither can you.

144
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:18,653
Oh!

145
00:11:18,905 --> 00:11:20,723
You're an asshole.

146
00:11:24,929 --> 00:11:29,147
This song again?
Can't you sing any other songs?

147
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:32,012
No, I didn't request it.

148
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,668
If it wasn't you, then who?

149
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:36,436
I don't know.

150
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:37,926
Maybe you?

151
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:39,265
Not me

152
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:41,087
Then who?

153
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:46,257
<i>I'm right here waiting for you</i>

154
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,650
<i>Whenever she makes you so blue</i>

155
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,040
<i>Whenever I see your heart broken</i>

156
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:05,189
<i>My heart's also drowning in pain</i>

157
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:12,598
<i>If her love is mean and unkind</i>

158
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:18,640
<i>I'll wipe your tears away until they dry</i>

159
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:23,275
<i>Give me your bruised heart</i>

160
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:29,017
<i>Let my true love heal it fast</i>

161
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,225
Have you never seen
an airplane before?

162
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,257
What do you mean?

163
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:43,015
Like a dog's eyes on an airplane.

164
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:46,595
Don't you get it?
Beauty and The Beast.

165
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,707
Do you know her?

166
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:55,762
Your stupidity cannot be cured.

167
00:12:56,348 --> 00:12:59,538
Her name is Nok. She's high-class.

168
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:05,241
The daughter of a Pattaya Godfather.

169
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,572
Disappointed, huh dog?

170
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:10,360
I'm not. Cause I'm not a dog.

171
00:13:10,866 --> 00:13:13,561
I'm Ped the duck, with my wings...

172
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,048
I'll fly there to quack-a-boom-boom her.

173
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:17,363
Hey, where're you going?

174
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,666
To quack-a-boom-boom her.

175
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:22,220
Her father is mafia, remember?

176
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:24,525
So what? He isn't my father.

177
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:26,960
You fucking duck, you've gone too far.

178
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:56,180
<i>If her love is mean and unkind</i>

179
00:13:56,205 --> 00:14:02,520
<i>I'll wipe your tears away until they dry</i>

180
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:06,699
<i>Give me your bruised heart</i>

181
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:11,830
<i>Let my true love heal it fast</i>

182
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:18,952
<i>If her love is too mean and unkind</i>

183
00:14:19,056 --> 00:14:25,593
<i>I'll wipe your tears away until they dry</i>

184
00:14:25,684 --> 00:14:29,811
<i>Give me your bruised heart</i>

185
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:34,551
<i>Let my true love heal it fast</i>

186
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:45,528
<i>I'll cherish you with all my heart</i>

187
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:51,957
Can you take me home?

188
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:17,197
What did she tell you, Tun?

189
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:22,467
Tun, what did she say?

190
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:26,647
She asked me to take her home.

191
00:15:28,522 --> 00:15:30,814
Cross it! Cross it fast!

192
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:31,765
Cross what?

193
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:34,199
The bridge of love!

194
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:36,778
It's the bridge of love
that she's extending to you.

195
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:39,328
What the hell are you waiting for?

196
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:44,752
Nok...

197
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:52,311
I want you to know
that I was AWOL.

198
00:15:55,293 --> 00:15:57,181
I mean...

199
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,981
I just wanted to let you know...

200
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,793
You are such a fantastic singer.

201
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:11,087
You like this song too?

202
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,924
I really like it.

203
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:19,221
I've never seen any girl sing...

204
00:16:19,818 --> 00:16:21,738
...as well as you do.

205
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,944
What's your name anyway?

206
00:16:26,973 --> 00:16:30,176
It's "Tun", like a mole, living in a hole.

207
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:33,978
And do you have a car, Tun?

208
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:36,400
For Tun, the "mole in the hole", no.

209
00:16:36,804 --> 00:16:38,522
But for this Tun, yes.

210
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,296
It's a motorcycle, not really a car.

211
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:45,544
Here it is.
It's an old hog, as you can tell.

212
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,625
<i>On the journey that we've taken</i>

213
00:17:15,211 --> 00:17:18,883
<i>Tons of life stories have happened</i>

214
00:17:19,144 --> 00:17:26,149
<i>I've chosen this path as my destiny</i>

215
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:30,094
<i>It's fresh, like teen spirit</i>

216
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:33,948
<i>Though from time to time it can be hectic</i>

217
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:40,900
<i>It's the path of mind I chose myself</i>

218
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:58,371
That's gross.

219
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,809
How is it gross?

220
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,037
I didn't ask you how you did it.

221
00:18:03,453 --> 00:18:05,987
I just wanna know if you did it.

222
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,119
Well, Tao has a good point.

223
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:18,519
I saw you and Nok
on the motorbike together.

224
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,115
Why are you talking
like sex is a big thing?

225
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:26,960
If it isn't, I wouldn't have been born.

226
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:30,641
This mofo comes up with
another lame quote.

227
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:32,711
Whose quote is it this time?

228
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:34,978
Aristotle.

229
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:39,170
Well, is it a "yes" or "no"?

230
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,840
Yes?

231
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:50,107
Voila! That's it!

232
00:18:50,846 --> 00:18:52,326
And how'd you do it?

233
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:57,729
You're getting too nasty.

234
00:19:01,184 --> 00:19:02,624
Which one of you is Tun?

235
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:06,214
Chief Mhee wants to see you.

236
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:43,831
<i>Her name is Nok,
the high-class daughter of a Godfather.</i>

237
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:17,050
Is it you who screwed my daughter?

238
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:19,495
I didn't know she was your daughter.

239
00:20:19,782 --> 00:20:21,880
Put it down. I'm getting a raw deal here.

240
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,547
How dare you step on my toes?

241
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:27,866
I didn't mean it. Besides...

242
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,446
Your daughter started it

243
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:33,822
What's wrong with you?

244
00:20:35,222 --> 00:20:38,032
Didn't you hear what he asked?

245
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:40,537
Are you Guru Tun?

246
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:43,909
Yes.

247
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,344
Yeah, it's genuine.

248
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,993
That's what I wanna hear.

249
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:07,217
I knew your father, quite well.

250
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:11,510
If he wasn't such a skirt chaser,
he wouldn't have died so young.

251
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:16,110
What about you?
Are you a wolf, like your dad?

252
00:21:16,794 --> 00:21:18,154
No, not at all.

253
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:23,126
Klae. Bring my daughter out here.

254
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,420
Do you know him, honey?

255
00:21:48,261 --> 00:21:50,042
Bang! Bang! No, I don't.

256
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:57,450
Is that your daughter?

257
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,675
Yes.

258
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,719
She's nice.

259
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:02,972
I thought you were gonna get zapped.

260
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:06,440
Why was I gonna get zapped?

261
00:22:06,678 --> 00:22:09,008
There's no reason for him to kill me.

262
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:14,960
Don't you know Chief Mhee kills people
for no reason.

263
00:22:15,446 --> 00:22:16,943
How do you know, Ped?

264
00:22:17,112 --> 00:22:19,026
Well, that's what people say.

265
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,440
People say again?

266
00:22:20,862 --> 00:22:24,456
What if they said
your mom was a crocodile?

267
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:27,800
Fucker.
So, I'd run away from home.

268
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:29,120
Enough! Enough!

269
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:32,542
OK guys, let's get
our asses back to work.

270
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:34,860
What's our position tonight?

271
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:37,308
What do you mean?

272
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,756
Usually, we do it missionary style.

273
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:42,985
You think that's funny?

274
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,693
I asked if we're going out tonight.

275
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:51,709
Do you believe that?
Guru Tun asked us to go out.

276
00:22:51,826 --> 00:22:55,797
I made some money
authenticating amulets.

277
00:22:56,058 --> 00:22:57,400
Just wanna give you guys a treat.

278
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:58,474
A treat?

279
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:05,037
If it's on you, it's your call.

280
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:09,730
Pattaya Karaoke.

281
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:36,305
<i>Oh Honey, I've already come to see you</i>

282
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:40,537
<i>I'm here right now.
Come closer to me (A-la-wa)</i>

283
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,640
<i>Oh Honey, we're soul-mates</i>

284
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,539
<i>I don't lie when I say I love you,
oh my dear (ta-la-la)</i>

285
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:48,023
<i>Oh Honey, I've already come to see you...</i>

286
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,993
I'm sorry. Please come back later.

287
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:55,172
<i>Oh Honey, we're soul-mates</i>

288
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:59,547
<i>I don't lie when I say I love you,
oh my dear</i>

289
00:24:00,224 --> 00:24:03,519
<i>I promise I'll love only you,
really only you</i>

290
00:24:03,571 --> 00:24:04,720
<i>I even talk in my sleep about you</i>

291
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,470
<i>Yeah only you</i>

292
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,100
<i>I don't believe you</i>

293
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:22,347
<i>You're a liar baby, a liar talala!</i>

294
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:25,040
<i>A liar baby, Ahhhhhh!</i>

295
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,083
Hey!

296
00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:30,168
What the hell are you singing?

297
00:24:30,246 --> 00:24:31,249
It's "My Honey".

298
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:32,629
My Honey?

299
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:34,986
I thought you were singing "My Ass".

300
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,994
You barked and chased
all my customers away.

301
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:40,435
That's it!

302
00:24:40,616 --> 00:24:41,598
Fuck off!

303
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:43,319
Any problem?

304
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:45,377
When I get rich you'll see!

305
00:24:45,468 --> 00:24:46,735
See what?

306
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:49,962
I'll open up my own place
and you'll be sorry.

307
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,303
I guess I'd be happy.

308
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:53,751
Thank you.

309
00:24:53,803 --> 00:24:56,560
When you happen to get rich,
give me a call.

310
00:24:56,889 --> 00:25:00,093
But for now, get the hell out of here!

311
00:25:00,535 --> 00:25:01,535
Get out!

312
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:12,991
Here, take this number.

313
00:25:14,408 --> 00:25:15,848
Whose number is it?

314
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,392
It's Nok's, your babe.

315
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,007
Where did you get it?

316
00:25:20,714 --> 00:25:22,244
I just got it, okay?

317
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:25,548
Happy Birthday, dude.

318
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,616
I'm really jealous of you.

319
00:25:37,395 --> 00:25:39,481
<i>The entire hectic story starts right here.</i>

320
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:44,858
<i>This girl Nok,
was neither high-class...</i>

321
00:25:45,223 --> 00:25:48,415
<i>nor a daughter of a Pattaya Godfather.</i>

322
00:25:48,836 --> 00:25:50,186
May I speak with Nok, please?

323
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:52,187
Nok?
Who's calling?

324
00:25:52,893 --> 00:25:53,783
I'm Tun.

325
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,978
Tun who?

326
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,373
I'm Tun, Tao's friend.

327
00:25:57,608 --> 00:26:00,080
I see. Tao, friend of a toad!

328
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:03,950
Listen, that bitch no longer works here.

329
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:06,200
What do you mean?

330
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:07,764
What do you think I mean?

331
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:09,860
She doesn't work here anymore.

332
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:11,462
What kind of work?

333
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:12,660
Goddammit!

334
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,691
She's a hooker.

335
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:16,407
Why did you call her anyway?

336
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,840
A hooker?

337
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:29,626
Hello.

338
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:39,209
How can I get to mount her...
uh... meet her.

339
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:42,269
Just give me 100,000 baht...

340
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:43,936
I'll deliver her to your bedroom.

341
00:26:44,074 --> 00:26:45,524
People are trying to sleep here!

342
00:26:50,297 --> 00:26:51,377
100,000?

343
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:01,368
<i>Who would have thought
that love could happen in one night?</i>

344
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,905
What is it, Pla?

345
00:27:02,983 --> 00:27:05,652
<i>But... it actually did.</i>

346
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:08,634
Uh Nok, I need a favor from you.

347
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:11,381
<i>Can you do one last job for me?</i>

348
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:13,278
Another Job?

349
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:17,501
I can't do it. I told you...

350
00:27:17,683 --> 00:27:20,080
Kamnun Moo has already hired me.

351
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,775
Three million baht per year, remember?

352
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,910
Yes, but I... uh...

353
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:26,119
I can't!

354
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:30,808
All right. How about you just go meet him?

355
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:32,866
<i>It's Kamnun Moo we're messing with.</i>

356
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,134
Do you want me to get killed?

357
00:27:36,342 --> 00:27:39,585
I really can't. He's already paid me.

358
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,360
And even worse...

359
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:46,095
I've spent it all. Got to go now.

360
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,090
Tao, the police are here.

361
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:11,746
Hey, stop!

362
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:15,652
Hey you.

363
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,960
Yes, officer.

364
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:20,183
I'm a security guard.

365
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,037
Great.

366
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,582
What movie are you looking for?

367
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:31,538
"Scent of the Night Flower 3".

368
00:28:32,074 --> 00:28:33,348
Oh, c'mon.

369
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:38,269
Part 2 is still in production.
How can I get part 3 for you?

370
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:41,982
How about this one instead?

371
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:49,208
"Sex of the Night Fondler".
Guaranteed orgasm.

372
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:51,277
Guaranteed orgasm?

373
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:54,261
How much?

374
00:28:54,871 --> 00:28:57,445
Hey, where the hell is Tun?

375
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,233
Why hasn't he opened up his stall?

376
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,160
He might have gone crazy by now.

377
00:29:01,316 --> 00:29:02,510
Maybe.

378
00:29:02,723 --> 00:29:05,990
He may not know what
"hooker" really means.

379
00:29:07,358 --> 00:29:10,821
Right! Rotonour Sigford once said...

380
00:29:11,134 --> 00:29:17,553
Sometimes, it's hard to tell the difference
between a genius and an idiot.

381
00:29:18,035 --> 00:29:20,040
Who was this Rotonour Sigford?

382
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,320
Bullshit. This moron doesn't know anything.

383
00:29:24,868 --> 00:29:25,868
Fucker!

384
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,415
Why are you closing your stall up so early?

385
00:29:29,923 --> 00:29:31,190
Heading home for a soccer game.

386
00:29:31,499 --> 00:29:32,696
I have a lot of money on the line.

387
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:34,571
How much did you bet?

388
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:36,056
100,000.

389
00:29:36,155 --> 00:29:37,032
What?

390
00:29:37,463 --> 00:29:38,463
100,000?

391
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:44,457
Fucker! Trying to get a new bike.

392
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,204
What happens if you lose?

393
00:29:47,373 --> 00:29:48,506
Lose?

394
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:50,157
Impossible.

395
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:53,636
Tonight ManU is gonna win.
I'm sure of it.

396
00:29:54,717 --> 00:29:56,346
<i>Kenny Miller is dribbling past Wes Brown.</i>

397
00:29:56,371 --> 00:29:58,640
<i>And he kicks it in! One-Nil!</i>

398
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,320
<i>Miller had a chance and scored.</i>

399
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,790
<i>No chance whatsoever for Tim Howard.</i>

400
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,990
<i>The Wolves had waited for this
counter-attack, and they did it.</i>

401
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,670
<i>Finally, the referee blew the whistle.</i>

402
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:17,295
I don't have it.
If I did, I'd lend you some.

403
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:19,218
What did you spend all your money on?

404
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,870
I transferred 100,000
to a person named Pla.

405
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,320
I have just a bit left.

406
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:34,359
Who the hell is Pla?

407
00:30:34,888 --> 00:30:35,578
Oh,

408
00:30:37,256 --> 00:30:38,680
you gave me his number.

409
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:42,339
Why did you have to give him that much?

410
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:51,080
Tun... Talk to me!

411
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:53,324
Because I wanted to meet Nok.

412
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:54,506
That girl Nok?

413
00:30:55,602 --> 00:30:57,425
Why did it cost so much
to meet that slut?

414
00:30:57,686 --> 00:31:01,790
I don't know.
Pla said it's a security deposit.

415
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:04,647
Security deposit my ass!

416
00:31:07,328 --> 00:31:09,128
You are such a comic genius.

417
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:15,352
I only paid that whore
10,000 baht to do you.

418
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:24,222
You hired her?

419
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:34,880
I thought you knew,
since I gave you that number.

420
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,180
How could you do this to me?

421
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:41,123
I just returned the favor.

422
00:31:41,917 --> 00:31:43,297
What's wrong with that?

423
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,560
Well, did you finally see her?

424
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,870
I didn't fucking see anyone.

425
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:06,640
Don't tell me you got conned
by that ladyboy.

426
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:09,028
If you want that money,

427
00:32:09,248 --> 00:32:11,238
go and get it back from that queer.

428
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:31,084
How dare you trick my friend?

429
00:32:34,405 --> 00:32:36,765
Give the money back now!

430
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:40,209
Hey, what's that? What's happening?

431
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,830
What's happening, Poupee?
I don't know.

432
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:49,310
I thought I'd make money from this shit
and pay him off.

433
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,412
I wasn't trying to cheat your friend.

434
00:32:51,515 --> 00:32:52,865
Sell it then.

435
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:54,779
I want that money right now.

436
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:10,114
Well, you follow him upstairs.

437
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:12,674
And where are you going?

438
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:15,977
I have to pee. I'll come later.

439
00:33:19,153 --> 00:33:19,823
Come on.

440
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:24,632
Just wait here.

441
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,718
Never seen a woman before?

442
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:10,110
Don't you have homes to go to?

443
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,365
I really feel sorry for your parents.

444
00:34:17,476 --> 00:34:18,404
Bring it out.

445
00:34:24,421 --> 00:34:25,381
Give me a knife.

446
00:34:27,738 --> 00:34:28,738
Hey!

447
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,300
I've got a knife.

448
00:34:33,026 --> 00:34:33,986
Gotcha.

449
00:34:34,596 --> 00:34:35,596
I got you.

450
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:38,213
I fucking crack myself up.

451
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:41,646
My joke rocks.

452
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,133
Hey bro.

453
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:57,180
I don't think I can
give you a refund.

454
00:34:59,436 --> 00:35:00,846
Why not?

455
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:02,584
It's fake.

456
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:04,133
How come?

457
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:06,473
Pla said he got these drugs from you.

458
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,397
Taste it for yourself.

459
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
Hey.

460
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:19,901
How can you be sure he didn't fool you?

461
00:35:27,431 --> 00:35:29,732
Dumb ass. He doesn't know anything.

462
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:33,592
Free coke for me.

463
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:35,578
Keep it, Kraroak.

464
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:41,183
What a sucker!
I got him, that knucklehead.

465
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,000
Tell your friend to put her hair up, bitch.

466
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,200
It gives me the creeps.
Have you ever seen 'The Grudge'?

467
00:36:32,263 --> 00:36:34,423
It's me.

468
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,640
P'Arng?

469
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,240
I thought you got whacked.

470
00:36:40,293 --> 00:36:47,994
Y-y-you think t-t-t-they would
recognize me?

471
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,192
Yeah.

472
00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:52,239
I could hardly recognize you
if you didn't stutter.

473
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:58,749
About your soccer-bet debt...
Who's your bookie?

474
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,049
My b-b-bookie is Moo.

475
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:08,671
Oh! Same here!

476
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:12,122
How much did... did you owe him?

477
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,070
100,000.

478
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,260
Look!

479
00:37:17,995 --> 00:37:19,155
Who's this?

480
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,430
The plastic s-s-surgeon...

481
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,080
h-h-have your face made over...

482
00:37:29,739 --> 00:37:32,473
Then you can get away from them.

483
00:37:32,656 --> 00:37:34,518
Change my face and look like you?

484
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:38,480
While you are living,

485
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,486
your looks aren't i-i-important.
Don't cling to them.

486
00:37:42,877 --> 00:37:44,322
Who said such a thing?

487
00:37:44,414 --> 00:37:46,276
Err... Franco.

488
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,476
Anthony Hawkins.

489
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:51,171
Stravinsky.

490
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:55,572
David Fisherman.

491
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:09,674
Next time get your
stammering voice done too.

492
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:38,906
Hey Tun.

493
00:38:40,364 --> 00:38:42,343
Can I crash here tonight?

494
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,080
Tun!

495
00:38:56,328 --> 00:38:58,528
What the fuck is wrong with you?

496
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,247
Are you wasted?

497
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,251
Leave me alone!

498
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,032
Who the hell are you?

499
00:39:12,695 --> 00:39:14,505
I'm Tao, the turtle, your pal.

500
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,356
A fucking turtle that talks?

501
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:18,944
Have you been drinking?

502
00:39:19,582 --> 00:39:25,732
Hell yeah. You think I drank sea water
and got drunk?

503
00:39:26,445 --> 00:39:28,541
Moron!

504
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,447
What part of your fucking brain
gave you that idea?

505
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:34,062
Asshole.

506
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,718
Who did you call asshole?

507
00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:37,539
You!

508
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:39,088
Ouch.

509
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:44,934
My dad never even called me that.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

510
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:47,395
Oh, you wanna play rough?

511
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,158
How about a fist fight? Muay Thai?

512
00:39:51,861 --> 00:39:55,638
Hardcore wrestling? You name it.

513
00:39:56,106 --> 00:39:58,580
Or you want my sidekick to whip your ass?

514
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,640
Who are you talking about?

515
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:04,843
Kit Silencer!

516
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:05,845
Pew!

517
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,505
Take this!

518
00:40:10,963 --> 00:40:14,390
Knocked? Knocked out?

519
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,707
Bleeding... I'll call Gatorade to pay you.

520
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,713
All right!

521
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:22,070
Do you want a piece of me?

522
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,859
Come on.
I'm gonna whip your ass.

523
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,591
When you're drunk, you are a shit.

524
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:55,145
This amulet model is no longer collectable.

525
00:40:55,445 --> 00:40:56,825
You should keep it for yourself.

526
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:59,520
It's dirt cheap.

527
00:41:06,044 --> 00:41:09,470
Fuck! I stole it for nothing.

528
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,956
Sorry. What did you say?

529
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:14,442
Nothing.

530
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,000
Hello. Are you guru Tun?

531
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,280
Kamnun Moo wants to see you.

532
00:41:33,765 --> 00:41:37,020
I don't have any business with Kamnun Moo.

533
00:41:37,124 --> 00:41:39,143
If it's about Tao,
I don't know him personally.

534
00:41:39,442 --> 00:41:43,857
He bought an amulet
and we had a little chit-chat.

535
00:41:43,882 --> 00:41:45,536
And I never bet on soccer games.

536
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,710
- Let me go! I said let me go!
- Where are you rushing to?

537
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,160
I said let me go!

538
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,030
Did you just punch me?

539
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:00,253
Why did you knock him out?

540
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,160
He was trying to run away.

541
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,800
Run away from what?

542
00:42:06,916 --> 00:42:07,893
Wake him up.

543
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,883
Hold up...

544
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:17,944
What the hell is that bucket for?

545
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,730
To wake him up.

546
00:42:20,145 --> 00:42:22,669
Fucking idiot! You watch too many movies.

547
00:42:23,116 --> 00:42:24,506
You're gonna end up drenching him.

548
00:42:25,351 --> 00:42:28,790
I hire henchmen to back me up.

549
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,520
But look at the way you all dress.

550
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,640
You make me look like a dumb-ass jerk.

551
00:42:35,092 --> 00:42:36,839
Koong and Kung,

552
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,923
let me ask you something.

553
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,320
Why do henchmen have to wear wacky outfits,

554
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:44,385
and goofy black sunglasses?

555
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,430
And those stupid hats?
Wanna be a hip-hop star?

556
00:42:46,635 --> 00:42:49,488
Why not pick red, white, orange
or other damn colors?

557
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:55,816
He is awake now.
Put that damn bucket away.

558
00:42:57,314 --> 00:42:58,668
Hey bro...

559
00:42:59,801 --> 00:43:03,173
You checked the amulets
for Chief Mhee, right?

560
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,480
Yes.

561
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,200
<i>A honey tongue, a heart of gall.
I won't buy it</i>

562
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:29,670
<i>I had been warned
to not fall for your bullshit</i>

563
00:43:30,022 --> 00:43:35,800
<i>A honey tongue, a heart of gall,
a hypocrite</i>

564
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:44,440
<i>How many hearts have you broken
to bits and pieces?</i>

565
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:47,928
When can I take this damn thing off?

566
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:49,931
My voice would sound a lot better.

567
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:53,446
Are they all real?

568
00:43:53,996 --> 00:43:55,106
Yes, sir.

569
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,400
Terrific. My own collection,
the Sacred Seven.

570
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,360
You have all seven models?

571
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,280
All but one. Could you find it for me?

572
00:44:06,881 --> 00:44:07,841
Which model?

573
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,217
A Supermodel.

574
00:44:11,781 --> 00:44:13,131
Give me the envelope.

575
00:44:17,118 --> 00:44:19,097
Well, I bid you farewell, sir.

576
00:44:19,163 --> 00:44:22,550
Hold on, bro.
Go tell your buddy Tao that...

577
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,819
Don't even think of running away from me.

578
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:28,538
Hey.

579
00:44:28,798 --> 00:44:30,425
Show the guru out.

580
00:44:53,782 --> 00:44:54,502
Nok.

581
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,230
Let go of me...

582
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,702
Do you know him?

583
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,230
Let me go.

584
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:13,510
Hey.

585
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:15,087
Do you want to die?

586
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:16,941
That's Kamnun Moo's chick.

587
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,480
Get out of here. Move it!

588
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:47,263
Come on!

589
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,080
038-225476.

590
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,640
Your father owns a crocodile farm, huh?

591
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,040
Yes.

592
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,150
So he is rich then.

593
00:45:58,852 --> 00:45:59,775
What's his name?

594
00:46:00,282 --> 00:46:01,185
Poo.

595
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,824
Your dad's Poo. You're Pla.
Your mom'd be 'Puke'?

596
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:07,418
Puke your mother!

597
00:46:08,945 --> 00:46:09,875
Such a dogbreath.

598
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,640
Hello?

599
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:13,850
May I speak to Poo?

600
00:46:13,915 --> 00:46:14,675
Speaking.

601
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:21,350
Listen! I've kidnapped your son, Pla.

602
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,190
If you don't want
something tragic to happen,

603
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,525
Pay me a ransom of one...

604
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:30,514
<i>two...</i>

605
00:46:32,261 --> 00:46:33,212
300,000!

606
00:46:33,317 --> 00:46:34,097
Huh?

607
00:46:34,254 --> 00:46:35,143
300,000!

608
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:37,626
Hey! I only owe you 100,000.

609
00:46:40,178 --> 00:46:41,680
How'd you hear that?
The speaker's off.

610
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:42,962
Good ears.

611
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:44,409
Hello?

612
00:46:44,605 --> 00:46:45,972
Do you hear your son crying?

613
00:46:46,025 --> 00:46:48,525
Guess what.  
I'm not giving you three million!

614
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:51,663
There's no love lost
between me and that sissy.

615
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:55,670
What the fuck bit you?

616
00:46:56,142 --> 00:46:57,209
A film clit-tick.

617
00:46:57,574 --> 00:46:58,600
A clit-tick?

618
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,990
They normally tick. They don't bite.

619
00:47:03,716 --> 00:47:05,803
Yeah, but this damn clit-tick bites.

620
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,910
Hello?

621
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,855
What a fucking father!
How could you disown your son?

622
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,433
Why shouldn't I?

623
00:47:13,824 --> 00:47:16,240
He disowned his own dick.

624
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:17,873
Listen up.

625
00:47:17,978 --> 00:47:21,285
I'm neither a saint nor a
soft-hearted dad of a fag on TV.

626
00:47:21,337 --> 00:47:23,600
That type of father surely has
nothing to do with me.

627
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,798
Cold-blooded motherfucker.

628
00:47:33,264 --> 00:47:34,683
Did you really cut off your fuckstick?

629
00:47:34,748 --> 00:47:36,090
None of your business!

630
00:47:37,392 --> 00:47:38,465
Bitch!

631
00:47:38,932 --> 00:47:40,624
If I don't get my money back,

632
00:47:41,056 --> 00:47:42,150
I'm gonna kill you.

633
00:47:42,411 --> 00:47:44,360
Come on! Shoot me!

634
00:47:44,715 --> 00:47:46,213
I might look like a ladyboy,

635
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:49,160
but I know that gun is fake.

636
00:47:52,957 --> 00:47:57,267
If I noticed it yesterday,
you wouldn't have snatched me.

637
00:47:57,515 --> 00:48:01,053
Oh yeah? Why don't you try this shit first?

638
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,440
Alright. Keep laughing.

639
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,670
Hello.

640
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,310
<i>Tun is hitting the bottle again.</i>

641
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,353
Again?

642
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:23,990
<i>Was it my fickle heart, my fault?</i>

643
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:31,960
<i>Or was it your gullible ears?</i>

644
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,550
<i>Whatever pulled us apart</i>

645
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,870
<i>I just want to tell you the truth</i>

646
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,880
<i>I want you to listen to me for once</i>

647
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,630
<i>I'm confused, going down
because of your changing heart</i>

648
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,950
Your buddy's up there.

649
00:49:15,301 --> 00:49:16,291
What is going on?

650
00:49:16,382 --> 00:49:17,531
He said he's heartbroken.

651
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,800
Heartbroken?

652
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:22,720
Which bitch was riding
past his house this time?

653
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,246
That whore, Nok.

654
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:25,690
What?

655
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:31,000
Told you! That candy-ass
is too sensitive with women.

656
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,200
How much did he drink?

657
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:40,978
About half a bottle.

658
00:49:43,075 --> 00:49:44,898
Why didn't you guys stop him?

659
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,400
How could we?
We got here too fucking late.

660
00:49:49,197 --> 00:49:51,632
Just be honest and say
you didn't dare to.

661
00:49:51,866 --> 00:49:53,676
All right. I didn't dare to.

662
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,325
You know he's a Mad Max
when he's tanked up.

663
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:02,296
Even Chang wouldn't dare to mess with him.

664
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,540
Take it easy, man. Easy.

665
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,538
I've found out Nok is
Kamnun Moo's kept woman.

666
00:50:31,005 --> 00:50:32,005
Hey Tun.

667
00:50:32,804 --> 00:50:34,600
Don't talk bullshit.

668
00:50:34,984 --> 00:50:35,974
That's not funny.

669
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,838
Who the fuck is joking here?

670
00:50:41,176 --> 00:50:42,176
Huh?!

671
00:50:46,188 --> 00:50:47,188
Now...

672
00:50:48,103 --> 00:50:52,640
Kamnun Moo said
don't you even think of escaping.

673
00:50:52,826 --> 00:50:54,716
Hey! Look!

674
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:00,942
Holy shit! He said that?

675
00:51:07,947 --> 00:51:10,043
Tun! Tun! Don't!

676
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,720
Please.
For my life's sake.

677
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:16,905
You are on your own!

678
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,280
But I'm your best friend.

679
00:51:21,684 --> 00:51:22,670
Sit down, you jackass!

680
00:51:22,902 --> 00:51:23,862
No!

681
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:28,728
Tun...

682
00:51:29,705 --> 00:51:32,791
Please.
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

683
00:51:32,816 --> 00:51:35,600
He already said sorry.
Let bygones be bygones.

684
00:51:36,173 --> 00:51:37,173
No!

685
00:51:37,709 --> 00:51:42,709
There's much more between Nok and me.

686
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,316
What the hell is it?

687
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:49,430
It's what you don't have.

688
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,350
And what is that?

689
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:53,464
True love.

690
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,303
Blow me, Tun.

691
00:51:57,903 --> 00:52:00,417
What kind of love grows in one night?

692
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:06,003
It's something you guys
wouldn't understand!

693
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,665
I'd like to hear you sing.

694
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:15,129
Where are you going, Tun?

695
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,320
Didn't your friend tell you?

696
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,000
He did.

697
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,462
Didn't you say you loved me?

698
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:36,570
Are you stupid or what?

699
00:52:39,266 --> 00:52:41,756
Is there a guy who still
believes in such a thing?

700
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,330
Yes.

701
00:52:45,517 --> 00:52:46,907
No, there isn't.

702
00:52:48,227 --> 00:52:52,045
Men don't have the word "Love"
in their hearts.

703
00:52:52,996 --> 00:52:54,845
Meet 100 guys...

704
00:52:55,874 --> 00:52:57,813
and they are all the same.

705
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:17,600
<i>I'm just one of the love choices
she discarded</i>

706
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:24,680
<i>To her I'm only a useless cigarette butt</i>

707
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:31,550
<i>She inhaled all the sweetness
and flicked me away</i>

708
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:38,080
<i>Left me crushed under her feet</i>

709
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:44,480
<i>I'm just one of the love choices
she discarded</i>

710
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,964
<i>It feels like being hit on the head
with a mallet</i>

711
00:53:52,332 --> 00:53:57,813
<i>I'm too sensitive and naive</i>

712
00:53:57,875 --> 00:53:58,865
Sir!

713
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,177
You've just interrupted
in the middle of my song.

714
00:54:06,203 --> 00:54:10,240
I butted in because I'm a dipshit.

715
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,880
I'm an idiot who
doesn't know what love is.

716
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,030
But honestly...

717
00:54:19,035 --> 00:54:21,327
I...

718
00:54:21,352 --> 00:54:28,644
have sincere feelings for this woman.

719
00:54:29,113 --> 00:54:31,480
This son of a gun is a sweet talker.

720
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,150
Award-winning poets should call you daddy.

721
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:36,950
Are you drunk?

722
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,110
I might be drunk.

723
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:44,360
But I know what I'm talking about.

724
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:45,920
Do you know him?

725
00:54:50,766 --> 00:54:52,381
You really love this woman?

726
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,550
If "love" means sincerity,

727
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:58,840
Then the answer is Yes!

728
00:55:00,701 --> 00:55:03,880
Can you put a price on your sincerity?

729
00:55:04,397 --> 00:55:05,557
No, it can't.

730
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:10,840
Then your sincerity and love
are not the same.

731
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:16,840
The love of this woman is worth 3 million.

732
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:18,722
You have it?

733
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:24,320
If you do, go ahead
and take your love back.

734
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,240
Or, is your love worth less than that?

735
00:55:31,509 --> 00:55:32,509
Deal!

736
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,350
I'll give you 3 million baht.

737
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,960
All right. You're the man!

738
00:55:42,915 --> 00:55:45,640
But now, get your ass out of here.

739
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,160
Whenever you have the money,

740
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,360
You can come and get your love.

741
00:55:53,591 --> 00:55:54,591
Alright.

742
00:55:55,297 --> 00:55:56,929
No need to drive me away.

743
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:04,960
<i>- I'm just one of the men she discarded</i>
- What are you gonna do?

744
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,530
Can't do anything until those pricks leave.

745
00:56:12,954 --> 00:56:19,360
<i>She inhaled all the sweetness
and flicked me away</i>

746
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:25,240
<i>Left me crushed under her feet</i>

747
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:32,186
<i>I'm just one of the men she discarded</i>

748
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:38,680
<i>It feels like being hit on the head
with a mallet</i>

749
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:46,360
<i>I'm too sensitive and naive</i>

750
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,440
<i>I'm nothing but a novice
in this game of love</i>

751
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,320
Hey!

752
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:10,600
Is he dead?

753
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:36,976
How much did you pay for it?

754
00:57:37,132 --> 00:57:38,382
3 million baht.

755
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:53,390
It's a fake.

756
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:54,343
What?

757
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:56,828
Really?

758
00:57:57,399 --> 00:57:58,239
Yes, Sir.

759
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,680
There're only 9 genuine ones in the world.

760
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,323
Three belong to Mr. Por, Chief Kwang,
and Big Mod.

761
00:58:05,414 --> 00:58:07,000
One to Tri-Croc Temple.

762
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,150
One to Father Sua.
One to Dr. Keng.

763
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:13,942
And the last one...

764
00:58:14,268 --> 00:58:15,453
 belongs to me.

765
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,950
All besides these, are fakes.

766
00:58:19,815 --> 00:58:21,208
Where did you get it?

767
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,291
From someone I know.

768
00:58:25,843 --> 00:58:28,278
The one that belongs to you...

769
00:58:28,669 --> 00:58:30,211
Can you sell it to me?

770
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:33,800
It was passed down to my dad
from my grandfather.

771
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,200
Actually it belongs to my family.

772
00:58:38,943 --> 00:58:41,182
Three million Baht.

773
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:50,067
<i>Agatha Kinsky once said...</i>

774
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,430
<i>Love makes you do stupid things.</i>

775
00:58:56,889 --> 00:58:59,289
<i>And so does greed.</i>

776
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:06,800
Hey!

777
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:16,540
What's your name?

778
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,000
Nhoo.

779
00:59:19,279 --> 00:59:20,279
You are Nhoo.

780
00:59:21,841 --> 00:59:23,130
You look like a half-breed.

781
00:59:24,232 --> 00:59:25,052
Where do you study?

782
00:59:25,626 --> 00:59:26,586
Bangkok.

783
00:59:29,077 --> 00:59:30,427
What're you doing in Pattaya.

784
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,000
My parents live here.

785
00:59:36,162 --> 00:59:38,545
"Great Butt-siness Company".

786
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,200
It's "Business".

787
00:59:42,295 --> 00:59:43,441
What the fuck are you laughing at?

788
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:45,299
Butt-siness?

789
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,894
Who's your father?

790
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:49,156
Mickey

791
00:59:50,196 --> 00:59:51,226
Mickey Mouse?

792
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,190
Since you think your English is good.

793
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,190
I tell you what...

794
01:00:11,188 --> 01:00:15,230
I'm going to call her father,
and you talk to him.

795
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:21,006
Tell him that his daughter
has been kidnapped for ransom.

796
01:00:26,717 --> 01:00:27,412
Hello.

797
01:00:30,863 --> 01:00:31,863
Hi.

798
01:00:32,464 --> 01:00:33,679
My name is Pla.

799
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,200
Uh... Pla like a fish... Uh... your...

800
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:44,120
Right now... your daughter...
you know, uh...

801
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,886
Your daughter like a... like a kidcracker

802
01:00:50,238 --> 01:00:51,238
Kiss my ass.

803
01:00:53,988 --> 01:00:55,405
What the fuck are you laughing at?

804
01:00:55,547 --> 01:00:57,277
Kidnapper!

805
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,006
Kidcracker?

806
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,117
And you think you're so cool.

807
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,520
My father isn't a foreigner.

808
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,840
My father can speak Thai.

809
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,560
Why didn't you say so, bitch?

810
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,169
You're a bitch.
Want your ass kicked?

811
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:25,411
Oh! You're going to get it, you skunk!

812
01:01:25,436 --> 01:01:26,396
You bitch.

813
01:01:27,293 --> 01:01:28,433
Shut up, faggot!

814
01:01:33,546 --> 01:01:34,406
Hello.

815
01:01:34,705 --> 01:01:35,665
Mr. Mickey?

816
01:01:36,505 --> 01:01:37,664
Listen to me.

817
01:01:37,859 --> 01:01:39,130
This is a ransom call.

818
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,360
Your daughter is beside me right now.

819
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,380
If you don't pay me a ransom of...

820
01:01:43,771 --> 01:01:44,771
of...

821
01:01:46,232 --> 01:01:47,232
of...

822
01:01:47,635 --> 01:01:48,925
of three million baht...

823
01:01:49,093 --> 01:01:49,903
Greedy asshole.

824
01:01:51,726 --> 01:01:52,649
Why not?

825
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:54,448
Her dad is richer than yours.

826
01:01:56,023 --> 01:01:57,200
Hello. Do you hear me?

827
01:01:58,003 --> 01:01:59,680
If you don't send me 3 million,

828
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,094
I'll cut your daughter into pieces
and send her to you.

829
01:02:04,735 --> 01:02:05,750
What the f...

830
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,800
If your father skips out on me...

831
01:02:20,706 --> 01:02:21,386
Hey.

832
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,003
When are you going to release me?

833
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,640
When I get the ransom.

834
01:02:27,937 --> 01:02:31,546
And when?
Seems like her father is ditching you.

835
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:33,608
Shut up, you monkey's ass.
You skunk.

836
01:02:33,953 --> 01:02:34,721
Your mother.

837
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:35,593
You bitch.

838
01:02:35,687 --> 01:02:36,960
You fucking monkey.

839
01:02:37,195 --> 01:02:38,195
You bitch.

840
01:02:39,305 --> 01:02:40,594
Why don't you hit her too?

841
01:02:40,664 --> 01:02:41,664
Serves you right.

842
01:02:41,957 --> 01:02:43,277
You're getting on my nerves.

843
01:02:52,077 --> 01:02:53,144
I can't help it.

844
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:56,354
Your father is aggravating me.

845
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:02,120
You're dead meat, bitch.
Cut her saucy tongue out.

846
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,216
I'd love to see you in pain.

847
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:19,040
I thought you were kidding.

848
01:03:23,014 --> 01:03:23,823
Is it in full?

849
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,480
Yes, Sir.

850
01:03:26,571 --> 01:03:28,016
Ok.

851
01:03:28,849 --> 01:03:31,360
I'm a man of my word.

852
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:35,200
Can I pay you only 2.9 million?

853
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,830
Why?

854
01:03:38,302 --> 01:03:42,677
I want to pay my friend's debt
of 100,000.

855
01:03:45,098 --> 01:03:50,397
What a macho man.
Don't you think you drink to much Red Bull?

856
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:56,258
Anyway you dare to ask,
so I dare to give it to you.

857
01:03:57,332 --> 01:04:00,072
You have the guts
to bring me three million.

858
01:04:00,308 --> 01:04:01,492
I respect you.

859
01:04:04,013 --> 01:04:06,049
-Koong?
-Sir?

860
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:08,720
Do your job.

861
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,351
Miss Nok.

862
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:20,320
Now you've got your love.

863
01:04:21,948 --> 01:04:23,749
Why did you do this?

864
01:04:24,776 --> 01:04:26,440
What did you want to prove?

865
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,878
Nothing.

866
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:36,219
I just wanted you to know
that all men are not bad.

867
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,414
Are you sure you'll set me free?

868
01:04:44,531 --> 01:04:45,594
Yes.

869
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,150
So somebody has already settled my debt?

870
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,190
<i>Yes, but there'll be no next time.</i>

871
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:07,310
No, not anymore.

872
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:10,640
That was my last time. I'm out.

873
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:17,240
Shit. Only 3 Million.
Why don't you give it to them?

874
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:19,430
How could you let them cut off
your daughter's finger.

875
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,200
I'm broke because of that card game,
remember?

876
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,400
You're damn right.

877
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:33,880
I came here to borrow money from you.

878
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,880
Mickey, how long have you known me?

879
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,280
I've known you... for one year.

880
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:47,960
Just one year, and you dare borrow money
from me.

881
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,000
Koong.

882
01:06:50,146 --> 01:06:50,866
Sir.

883
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:53,927
Get Tun's money out here.

884
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,640
There's three million in here.

885
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,880
Take this money to the designated location.

886
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,950
Thank you very much.

887
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,360
And my henchmen will
take care of those creeps.

888
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:20,800
Hello

889
01:07:21,226 --> 01:07:23,354
It's me, Chief Mhee.

890
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,390
I know your amulet is fake.

891
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,180
If I don't get my money today,
you are dead!

892
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,160
You cruel, evil-minded son of a bitch.

893
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,800
Alright. I'm sorry.

894
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,040
Your apology can't
make my finger grow back.

895
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:50,390
Why didn't you cut that skunk's finger off?

896
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:56,480
Well, I wanted a human finger,
not a skunk's.

897
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:00,450
Bastard! You trouser snake!

898
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,870
You already had your dick cut off!

899
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:11,480
This is just a pinky.
Stop screaming like you're gonna die.

900
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:12,680
Fuck you!

901
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:22,273
One more word,
I'll also cut out your tongue.

902
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,480
I'll let you go.

903
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:31,661
If you tell anybody,
I'll cut your lips off.

904
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:33,130
Understood?

905
01:08:42,693 --> 01:08:45,983
Go home now.
Your car's at the back of the building.

906
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,200
Why? Don't you need the money?

907
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:51,114
Not anymore.

908
01:08:52,202 --> 01:08:54,266
By the way,

909
01:08:54,649 --> 01:08:56,836
it seems no one's coming to help you.

910
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:00,770
I knew it.

911
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:09,041
Please don't cut the rope.

912
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,351
Just leave it like that.

913
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,995
It really turns me on.

914
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:39,510
Hey, bro.

915
01:09:40,854 --> 01:09:41,854
Bro!

916
01:09:42,937 --> 01:09:44,632
Your phone's ringing.

917
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:53,560
Tun, where are you?

918
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:57,440
I can't stay in Pattaya.
Chief Mhee will kill me.

919
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,120
Why does he want to kill you?

920
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,030
He found out I sold him a fake amulet.

921
01:10:02,171 --> 01:10:03,531
Why did you do that?

922
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:06,640
How much did you get from him?

923
01:10:07,846 --> 01:10:08,560
Three million.

924
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,011
Three million?

925
01:10:10,177 --> 01:10:11,144
Fuck you!

926
01:10:11,635 --> 01:10:12,760
Yes, fuck me!

927
01:10:13,315 --> 01:10:16,360
I have no idea how
to return his three million.

928
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,800
He wants his money back today.

929
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:22,550
You spent all three million on what?

930
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,470
I paid your debt of a 100,000.

931
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:29,253
Oh, thank you.
What about the other 2.9 Million?

932
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:32,600
Tun.

933
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:34,840
Tun.

934
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,640
Hello.

935
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,390
<i>Hello?
Mickey speaking.</i>

936
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:55,790
<i>I have the three million.
Where do you want it?</i>

937
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:00,125
Yes, yes...

938
01:11:00,581 --> 01:11:03,146
the same place in half an hour.

939
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,030
Hello.

940
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,960
Is that Nhoo?
It's me Tao.

941
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,880
What's up darling?

942
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,080
Where are you now?

943
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:19,790
I'm in front of my house,
about to drive in.

944
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:20,990
Has anyone seen you?

945
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,380
Not yet.
I've just arrived.

946
01:11:23,458 --> 01:11:24,995
-Leave now!
-Where to?

947
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,976
Anywhere.
I'll come to see you

948
01:11:28,055 --> 01:11:29,148
Really?

949
01:11:29,305 --> 01:11:30,945
Yeah. I miss you already.

950
01:11:30,997 --> 01:11:33,800
I'll be at my friend's condo.

951
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:36,080
OK, you go wait there.

952
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:39,331
Don't go anywhere until I call you.

953
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,960
Hey, where is my daughter?

954
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,790
You could call her cell phone.

955
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:16,600
Do you know why your father died?

956
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,550
Because he was a ladies' man.

957
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,960
But you are going to die...

958
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,583
...because of your trickiness.

959
01:12:42,895 --> 01:12:43,945
Whose phone is that?

960
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,390
Is it yours?

961
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,720
No. It's his.

962
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:52,755
Why did you take his phone?

963
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:55,400
Damn. Get it.

964
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,600
- Hello.
- Tun, I've three million baht for you.

965
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:10,280
Sir, the caller said
he has three million.

966
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:12,950
Give me that goddamn phone.

967
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,480
- Hello.
- Who's that?

968
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,658
I'm Chief Mhee.

969
01:13:20,866 --> 01:13:22,728
Where's my friend?

970
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:27,710
He's about to die.
Wanna say some last words to him?

971
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,230
Please don't hurt him.

972
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,390
I'm on my way
to pay you the three million.

973
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,360
You'll bring my money?
Alright.

974
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,320
I'll give you 20 minutes.

975
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,360
Send her in.

976
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:29,240
Klae!

977
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:30,320
Yes, sir.

978
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:32,624
Get her something to drink.

979
01:14:59,442 --> 01:15:01,387
It looks like nobody's coming.

980
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,320
Honey, let's go.

981
01:16:54,921 --> 01:16:55,851
Phra Rod.

982
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,257
Oh shit!

983
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,600
Where do you think you're going?

984
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,940
I'm taking the money to your boss.

985
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,280
You are hours late.
He doesn't want it anymore.

986
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,200
What happened to my friend?

987
01:17:56,673 --> 01:17:58,352
Tell me that you want to die!

988
01:17:59,657 --> 01:18:00,657
Tell me!

989
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,240
Tell me, son of a bitch!

990
01:18:06,637 --> 01:18:07,637
Say it!

991
01:18:16,676 --> 01:18:17,716
What's the matter?

992
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,041
I'm sorry.

993
01:18:21,054 --> 01:18:22,564
I really can't do it.

994
01:18:24,794 --> 01:18:27,372
If you can't, then
give my three million back.

995
01:18:32,545 --> 01:18:34,090
You saved my life, Tun.

996
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:37,142
But, I...

997
01:18:50,032 --> 01:18:50,939
Hey!

998
01:18:55,141 --> 01:18:56,501
Did you steal my amulet?

999
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:58,850
You're still alive?

1000
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:02,437
If I had waited for you,
I'd have been dead by now.

1001
01:19:06,182 --> 01:19:07,657
How'd you escape?

1002
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,593
I beg you. Please don't kill him.

1003
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:37,160
Suppose a woman sells herself
as a sex slave for one year...

1004
01:19:38,854 --> 01:19:40,509
just to save a guy's life.

1005
01:19:40,628 --> 01:19:42,398
If you were that guy,
what would you do?

1006
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,430
What would I do?

1007
01:20:01,694 --> 01:20:02,411
What?

1008
01:20:02,645 --> 01:20:04,011
Three million baht.

1009
01:20:04,384 --> 01:20:05,991
If I were that guy...

1010
01:20:07,164 --> 01:20:09,286
I would give her this money.

1011
01:20:13,961 --> 01:20:15,401
Where did you get this?

1012
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:20,990
ManU.

1013
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:56,679
<i>Someone once said that love only begins
when you have faith.</i>

1014
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:02,200
<i>And where there's faith,
there's always a miracle.</i>

1015
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,630
Sorry. I thought it was Nok's car.

1016
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,600
But now it belongs to Chief Mhee.

1017
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:14,870
What do you mean?

1018
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:18,400
I guess cars are more valuable
than girls.

1019
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,760
So he chose the car instead.

1020
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:29,920
<i>Miracles don't always happen
to people with faith.</i>

1021
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:35,870
<i>Because, since that day
Tun has never seen Nok again.</i>

1022
01:21:45,636 --> 01:21:49,276
<i>We're gonna drink and get drunk to eternity</i>

1023
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:56,560
<i>- No check, no chase, no end of me.</i>
- Take your bitch home. It's closing time.

1024
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:57,680
Get up!

1025
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:02,560
<i>His crying and babbling may sound annoying</i>

1026
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:08,523
<i>But nobody knows my friend's heart...</i>

1027
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:10,250
<i>is broken!</i>

1028
01:22:12,230 --> 01:22:15,680
<i>She's way out of his league</i>

1029
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:21,770
Hey, the pub is closed.

1030
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:25,520
What's your problem?
It's your friend's birthday.

1031
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,910
My friend, not yours.

1032
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,600
You're drunk. Buzz off.
Get out of here!

1033
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,920
I told you to invest in something else.

1034
01:22:41,642 --> 01:22:45,731
What're you looking at?
She's my girlfriend.

1035
01:22:46,281 --> 01:22:47,051
Oh?

1036
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:49,550
He stares at me like this everyday.

1037
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:55,960
Right. Why don't you get used to it?
Fucker.

1038
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,120
Get out.
I'm closing the place.

1039
01:22:59,689 --> 01:23:02,020
Some fucking owner,
always driving customers away.

1040
01:23:02,581 --> 01:23:04,181
Look at Chang over there.

1041
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:08,181
<i>Do you believe in destiny?</i>

1042
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,760
I've quit singing.

1043
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,160
I know.

1044
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:31,825
Think of it as a birthday present
from me.

1045
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:47,360
<i>I'm right here waiting for you</i>

1046
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:53,800
<i>- Whenever she makes you so blue</i>
- Happy birthday, dude.

1047
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:59,240
<i>Whenever I see you heartbroken</i>

1048
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:07,190
<i>My heart is also drowning in pain</i>

1049
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:14,560
<i>If her love is mean and unkind</i>

1050
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:21,160
<i>I'll wipe your tears away until they dry</i>

1051
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:25,120
<i>Give me your bruised heart</i>

1052
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:31,310
<i>Let my true love heal it fast</i>

1053
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:39,320
<i>When two people love the same song,
it shouldn't be called "destiny".</i>

1054
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:44,750
<i>And as for the return of Nok,
it shouldn't be called a "miracle".</i>

1055
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:49,670
<i>Einstein once said there's no such thing
as miracles.</i>

1056
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:54,680
<i>Everything that happens
has a cause and effect.</i>

1057
01:24:55,430 --> 01:25:01,160
<i>The repercussions of an action,
that some religions call "Karma".</i>

1058
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:08,320
<i>If her love is mean and unkind</i>

1059
01:25:08,497 --> 01:25:14,907
<i>I'll wipe your tears away until they dry</i>

1060
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:18,920
<i>Give me your bruised heart</i>

1061
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:24,830
<i>Let my true love heal it fast</i>

1062
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,231
Why don't we use real guns?

1063
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,870
That's too merciful.

1064
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:35,150
The airguns will give him
a slow and painful death.

1065
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:36,590
Ready?

1066
01:25:36,747 --> 01:25:37,720
Ready!

1067
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:41,005
100,000 to the first person
who cuts off his finger!

1068
01:25:41,148 --> 01:25:42,148
Yes!

1069
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:43,023
Charge!

1070
01:25:43,057 --> 01:25:48,096
Yeah!!!!

1071
