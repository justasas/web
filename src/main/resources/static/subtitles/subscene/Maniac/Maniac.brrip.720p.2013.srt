1
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,450
Come on, it wasn't so bad.

2
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,200
- What was that?
- Please remind me, never to go out with you.

3
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,790
- Fine, you don't have to.
- I won't.

4
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,410
Shut up! Stop laughing,
it's not funny.

5
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,370
- Are you okay?
- No.

6
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:05,990
Stupid shoes.

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,000
The fuck are you looking at?

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,280
But seriously, I've never seen
so many douchebags in one place.

9
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,200
- I don't know, that tall one was kinda hot.
- The Marilyn Manson?

10
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,240
- Hot!
- Gross!

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,530
- You take this, I'll take the next one.
- You little freak.

12
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,370
- You're gonna go back in there, aren't you?
- Huh, no.

13
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,370
- Whatever.
- No.

14
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,410
- Bye, Judy.
- Bye, Stephanie.

15
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,570
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You look so pretty.

16
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,820
- I had to just to scare you a little bit.
- Don't touch me.

17
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,330
I'm just trying to say hello,
you have such a pretty dress on.

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,320
Check it out, check it out...
We got a limo, we got weed, champagne.

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,620
<i>Just come hang with us.
Leave her alone.</i>

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,030
Why are you in a such a bad mood?

21
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:55,120
Can I have a cigarette at least?
Or something, a smile?

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,000
Fuck off.

23
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,120
She just threw a cigarette at me.

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,250
Bad vibe, bro.

25
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,120
- Not very nice.
- Not very nice.

26
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,530
Hi! Can you-

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,080
The fuck?!

28
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,120
<i>I see you too.</i>

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,660
That late and still out?

30
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,370
Better go home.

31
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,620
Oh, fuck.

32
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,450
<i>Okay.</i>

33
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,660
<i>I know where you live, Judy.</i>

34
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
<i>See you later.</i>

35
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,370
Yeah, I just got home.

36
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,160
God, I'm glad that's over.

37
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,400
I know.

38
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,780
It was just some old truck driver.

39
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,120
Yeah.

40
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,700
Ugh no, I didn't.
I just...

41
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,450
No, it freaked me out.

42
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,410
I know.

43
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,610
Yeah well, I blame you.

44
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,530
The stupid places you take me to.

45
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,450
Oh crap.

46
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,580
The lights are out on my floor.

47
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,750
Ok, bye.

48
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,740
- Where'd you park the car?
- It's downstairs.

49
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,370
- You got the address?
- Yeah. You better hurry, we're gonna be late.

50
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,530
Please don't scream.

51
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,200
You're so beautiful.

52
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,580
Hello, Redlucie86.

53
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,370
<i>Truly timid?</i>

54
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,040
It's my first time on a dating site.

55
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,530
There's a reason
I'm called timid man.

56
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,780
Picture...

57
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,540
That sounds lovely.

58
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,410
Why didn't you agree?

59
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,780
Of course I have.

60
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,290
- Lucie?
- Frank.

61
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,280
- Hi.
- Hi. It's very nice to meet you.

62
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,830
No charm, I'm sure.

63
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,370
- You are totally not what I imagined.
- Really? What did you imagine?

64
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,950
Umm, like fat, with long black hair

65
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,410
and just greasy skin full of acne.

66
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,500
Huh, you should've seen the other photo
I was going to send you.

67
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,200
I mean people always post
the best pictures of themselves

68
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,160
and then that's what something
is like when you meet them.

69
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,410
I ordered some wine.
I hope you don't mind.

70
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,200
No, I like a man
who takes control.

71
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,450
Thank you.

72
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,500
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

73
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,490
So, how long have you been using
the website?

74
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,750
Uhh, like 6 months, maybe?

75
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,570
But this is my first dinner date,
usually it's just for drinks.

76
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,160
Although I can already tell that
you are a breath of fresh air

77
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,910
for the jugheads I deal
with at the bar every night, ugh.

78
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,240
See, it's really easy to get over
with the testosterone at work, you know?

79
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,120
Yeah.

80
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,950
So, why don't you have
a girlfriend?

81
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,200
- I...
- Are you okay?

82
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,700
I just...

83
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,160
Frank, are you okay?

84
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,740
You look pale.

85
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,530
Is everything okay?

86
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,410
Well, excuse me, I-

87
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,120
I need to find the restroom.

88
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,660
Did that waiter even look Indian to you?
I think he looked more Mexican.

89
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,160
He was such a tool.

90
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,120
You know, it was really sweet
of you to drive me home.

91
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I'm happy to do it.

92
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,330
I had a very lovely evening.

93
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,030
Did you wanna come up
for a drink?

94
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,740
Are you sure?

95
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,320
Uh, like I said
begging really isn't my thing, so...

96
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,040
Right. Okay then.

97
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,660
Sounds nice.

98
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,910
So what's all that stuff
back there?

99
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,660
I thought you were a journalist
or something.

100
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,950
It's for a fashion shoot.

101
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,410
I'm just doing a favor
for a friend.

102
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,660
So where do you live, Frank?

103
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,410
Probably in some trendy loft
or something.

104
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,490
I mean my place isn't much
but it's all mine, so...

105
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,580
I'm done with roommates.

106
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,200
No, thank you.
I still have to drive home.

107
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,700
Yeah, but not now, right?

108
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,450
You should take off your coat
and stay for a little while.

109
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,660
Want me to put on some music?

110
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,360
I love this song.
Dance with me.

111
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,240
I think you're cute.

112
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,990
I'm gonna be right back.
You don't go anywhere.

113
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,160
You take a lot
of pictures of yourself.

114
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,580
Hi...

115
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,700
I wanted to slip into something
a little more comfortable.

116
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,500
So how about that coat?

117
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,450
Now it's your turn to do me.

118
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,110
Why... Why are you hiding?

119
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,950
I don't know.

120
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,610
They're little.

121
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,410
What do you think?
You wanna touch them?

122
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,690
You shouldn't be so scared,
timid man.

123
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,030
Your hands feel warm.

124
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,370
Squeeze them.

125
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,120
You can do it harder.

126
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,360
You wanna get rough playing?

127
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,030
Is that what you're into?

128
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,660
Are you gonna fuck me?

129
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,910
I can't. I can't.

130
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,370
Don't be a pussy.

131
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,240
You like it?

132
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,440
I like to keep the lights on too.

133
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,280
Don't be so horrified.

134
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,660
You just relax.

135
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,200
Why can't you leave them alone?

136
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,330
Why can't you leave any
of them alone?

137
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,620
Can I have just one

138
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,330
without you getting in the way?

139
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,080
Now look...

140
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,450
Look what you made me do.

141
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,240
Look what you made me do!

142
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,910
I hate you.

143
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,280
I hate you.

144
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,030
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

145
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,120
I'll make it better.

146
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,830
I'll make it all better now.

147
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,490
Sorry I missed you today.

148
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,450
I have a surprise for you.

149
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,830
Are you asleep already?

150
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,200
I'm sorry but I just can't wait.

151
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,790
Alright.

152
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,740
Take a look.

153
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,490
I saved the best for last.

154
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,910
Here we go.

155
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,700
Oh, that's nice.

156
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,320
Perfect fit, right?

157
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,990
Okay now, this might
sting a little.

158
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,490
Okay, good.

159
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,830
Good.

160
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,910
Just one more...

161
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,080
Perfect.

162
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,040
Perfect.

163
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,150
Meet Redlucie86.

164
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Redlucie 86,
this is my girlfriend.

165
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,320
I know the two of you will
get along just fine.

166
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,780
Don't worry.

167
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,620
It's fine, it's fine.

168
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,540
What?
She's beautiful.

169
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,700
Why are you ignoring me, huh?

170
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,360
No, wait...

171
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,410
This is impossible.

172
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,870
No!

173
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,660
Why are you doing this to me?

174
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,780
What? You too?

175
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,790
Why?

176
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,620
You're just like her!
You two are the same thing as her!

177
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,620
Why are you doing this?

178
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,610
Why?

179
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,620
Hey.

180
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,450
I'm sorry to disturb you, uhm...

181
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,410
I was just taking pictures
of your mannequins in the window.

182
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,580
I hope that's okay?

183
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
- It's fine, I guess.
- Yeah?

184
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,740
Do you mind if I take pictures of them
with the gate open?

185
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,740
Okay, sure.

186
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,530
Yeah? Cool, thank you.

187
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,280
- What's this for?
- Oh, it's just fine art, I guess.

188
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,200
Here, take a look.

189
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,660
- Is that French? Your accent?
- Oui.

190
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,950
You have a good ear.

191
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,070
- What do you do exactly?
- I take pictures of mannequins.

192
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,910
I try to bring them
to life with light.

193
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,830
Okay, cool. Thank you.

194
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,370
Sorry to have disturbed you.

195
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,620
I'm not usually opened on weekends.

196
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,580
Well, thank you
for opening up for me.

197
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,030
Bye.

198
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,200
Would you like to see my work?

199
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,330
What do you do?

200
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,530
Are you an artist?

201
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,370
I don't know about all that.

202
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,780
Come in, maybe you can tell me.

203
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,740
It's amazing.

204
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,450
They're from all styles and eras.

205
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,160
I've restored most of them myself.

206
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,830
She's beautiful.

207
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,450
I love her.

208
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,950
- What year is this from?
- Thirties.

209
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,740
She's in great condition.

210
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,280
You know what...

211
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,200
I'm having a show for my photos
in a gallery downtown.

212
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,490
Maybe I could use some of your
mannequins for my photoshoot.

213
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,610
That would be incredible, I mean...

214
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,910
They're so much more unique than
the ones I've been shooting with.

215
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,950
- Is this your place?
- Yes.

216
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:34,030
- You bought it?
- It was my family's.

217
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:36,990
Been restoring them
for 3 generations now.

218
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,580
Who's Angela?

219
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,360
The name on the sign.

220
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,160
It was my mother.
She's gone.

221
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,370
I'm sorry.

222
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,830
- Do you live here?
- Thank you for coming.

223
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:07,530
Sorry, I'm a little nosy.

224
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,870
I mean this place is so special.

225
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,910
So what do you think
if I rent them?

226
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,040
Uh, I'm not sure...

227
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,820
I usually try to find permanent
homes for them.

228
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,500
You're funny.

229
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,030
Well, I can adopt them.

230
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,200
What about that?

231
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,530
I'll give you my number.

232
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,280
So if you change your mind,
I promise to have them home before midnight.

233
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,280
I can be a good mother.

234
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,910
- My name's Anna.
- Thank you.

235
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,030
Call me, please.

236
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,830
Oh and by the way...

237
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,950
You have lipstick on your face.

238
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,780
Have a great day.

239
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,780
Oh no. No, no, no.

240
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,870
No. Get out.

241
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,700
Get out.

242
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,780
Get out.

243
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,740
Get out. Go.

244
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,700
Go.

245
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,580
That's disgusting.

246
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,530
- Move it!
- I'm just waiting for my wife.

247
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,570
You have 10 seconds
before I give you a sanitation.

248
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,080
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!

249
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,660
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

250
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,780
I got my stuff.

251
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,410
Ugh, can you turn this on?

252
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,750
- I'm sorry!
- Shit, you scared me!

253
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,740
I forgot my tights.

254
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,660
- Hey, do you mind waiting for me, please?
- Sure, yeah.

255
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,950
Thanks.

256
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,990
I can't believe you shoved me in my locker.

257
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,830
Don't be tight.

258
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,160
- It was just a joke.
- Come on...

259
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,990
I could've broke my ankle.

260
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,490
- It still hurts.
- You're such a prick.

261
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,820
- But seriously.
- Tough it up.

262
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,650
- Come on girl, just come out with us.
- One drink.

263
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,410
- No.
- Come on, hon.

264
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,110
- Why don't you wanna come out?
- I'm going home.

265
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,910
- You never come out with us.
- What's up with that?

266
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,500
- The car's right up there.
- No way.

267
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:59,200
- You guys, I think I really hurt my leg bad today.
- Really?

268
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,700
- How?
- I went so fast with that twitch at.

269
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,240
I really don't think those tights
are any better.

270
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,320
- Good night, girls.
- Good night.

271
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,530
- Get home safe.
- Bye.

272
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,700
Text me, let me know.
Good night.

273
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,790
Oh, fuck.

274
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,410
- You're so beautiful.
- Shit.

275
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,950
Oh, shit.

276
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,330
What the fuck?!

277
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,950
Leave me the fuck alone!

278
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,780
Get away from me.

279
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,330
Somebody! Help me!

280
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,360
What the fuck?
Where is everyone?

281
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,410
Please, help me!

282
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,280
Please! Help me.

283
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,320
Help me!

284
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,740
Somebody! Open it!

285
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,400
Please!

286
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,030
Hey!

287
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,000
Please.

288
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,700
Open the gate, come on!

289
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,070
Oh fuck.

290
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,860
No, no.

291
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,160
Shit.
Oh, shit.

292
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,790
Fuck!

293
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,160
Oh, fuck.

294
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,950
No! No!

295
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,290
Please!

296
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,160
No!

297
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,650
Please.

298
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,990
No!

299
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,490
No!

300
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,780
Stop looking at me,
focus on your work.

301
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:48,070
- Anna, can you give me a hand?
- Yeah, sure. What do you need?

302
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,950
A hand, behind you.

303
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,040
- Which one?
- Second row.

304
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,660
- This one?
- The one on the right.

305
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,410
Oh, sorry.

306
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,110
Doctor Frankenstein, I presume.

307
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,500
- Are you a fan of those old films?
- For sure.

308
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,570
Okay, so what do you think
about my idea

309
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:16,820
of putting the mannequins among
the guests at the show?

310
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,000
You could see them mingling,
like they're real people.

311
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,990
Sometimes I think they have
more personality than most people.

312
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,240
I think we may have some
of the same friends.

313
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:38,820
- So, what do you think?
- I think you're incredibly talented.

314
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,030
- Well, that makes two of us then.
- Not really.

315
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,160
- I'm just a restorer.
- That one's my favorite.

316
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,820
Okay, now you show me.

317
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,370
It's amazing.

318
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,150
- It's gonna be perfect, Frank.
- I'm glad you like them.

319
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,040
- I love them.
- Why did you want them to be faceless?

320
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:10,330
Oh, I have a little idea for the show.
You'll see.

321
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,240
Okay, I'm starving. Are you hungry?
You wanna grab some lunch with me?

322
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,650
It's my third exhibition since
I've graduated from art center.

323
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,000
But it's my first with this gallery.

324
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,700
If it's successful they'll give me a show
in their other galleries in New York.

325
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,160
If something was missing...
Something tangible relating to the concept

326
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,190
The installation of your mannequins
with create the ambiance I was looking for.

327
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,990
You know, when you came into my shop
you looked at them

328
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,000
like no one else ever did.

329
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,700
You seem captivated.

330
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,330
- You must have thought I was crazy.
- No.

331
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,910
You were so soulful with them.
So present.

332
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,990
When my mother died last summer,
I wasn't so sure what to do with our shop.

333
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:56,360
Most stores couldn't care less about restoring antiques.
It's cheaper to buy them new.

334
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,040
And if I closed the shop
I would've had to abandon them.

335
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:02,400
It's like me and my old negatives.

336
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,950
I have boxes full of them but I could
never see myself getting rid of them.

337
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,240
Sometimes it's hard to move on.

338
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,580
So what does your girlfriend
think of your work?

339
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:17,740
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Really? Okay...

340
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,280
I thought you lived with someone.

341
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,990
Frank?

342
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,900
- Are you okay?
- It's nothing. It's just a migraine. It'll pass.

343
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:31,700
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, no, no I'll be fine.

344
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,990
I just need my meds.
I'm used to it.

345
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:39,280
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Are you sure you don't need help here?

346
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,200
No, thanks.
I just need to be alone.

347
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,120
Watch it, fuck face.

348
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,990
Are you suffering from a migraine?

349
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,910
This will have a similar effect
but you won't need a prescription for it.

350
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:09,330
- And it comes in a nasal spray, so it'll work faster.
- Thank you.

351
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,410
<i>We have found links connecting
the two victims in mid-town.</i>

352
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:51,780
<i>But as our investigation
is still developing</i>

353
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,370
<i>I can not give you
any more details.</i>

354
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,570
<i>All I can say is that all
of these women were Caucasian,</i>

355
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,610
between the ages of 20-30.

356
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,910
They can talk all they want.

357
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,120
But they will never understand.

358
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,620
As long as you keep a secret.

359
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,110
But if you can't, it'll find you...

360
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,250
and you'll be alone.

361
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,200
You hear that?!

362
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,870
The lot of you.

363
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,740
Alone.

364
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,160
- Now promise me you won't tell.
- Franky?!

365
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,160
Hey, it's mommy.

366
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:30,700
Franky, honey, where are you?

367
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,660
Franky!

368
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:11,740
Come here.

369
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:40,540
Shh, momma loves you.

370
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:30,990
Hey.

371
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,280
The necklace is beautiful, Frank.
Thank you so much.

372
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,040
- Did you make it?
- I did.

373
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,950
That's original.

374
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,000
Where did you get the stone?

375
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:42,990
It's something I found
in a thrift store.

376
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:45,870
Is that real hair?
What is it?

377
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,160
- I believe it's horse hair.
- That's interesting.

378
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,370
And what about you?
Are you feeling better?

379
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,740
Oh, sure.
I've had migraines since I was a kid.

380
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:59,330
I forgot to take my medicine, so...

381
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:02,910
It's really nothing.
Sorry if I've frightened you.

382
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:05,750
- It's okay.
- I just finished on

383
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,070
Um, you know. Sometimes I feel like
you come from another era.

384
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,780
I love it.
It makes you very different.

385
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,830
One second, Frank.
I'm sorry.

386
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,910
Thank you so much.

387
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,740
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

388
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,280
Sorry Frank, a friend of mine
was helping me and I had to say goodbye.

389
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,490
I sometimes feel like
a slave-driver, you know?

390
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,370
- I hate it.
- I can't say I know what you mean.

391
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,740
I've always worked alone.

392
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:45,030
- You never feel lonely?
- Yeah.

393
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,910
That's why I was calling.

394
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,250
I thought if you weren't
doing anything...

395
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,650
I would love to.

396
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,030
But I have so much to do tonight.

397
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,740
But what about tomorrow?
We could do something.

398
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,750
Okay, yeah.
Tomorrow night works.

399
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:03,580
- What time?
- 9?

400
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,860
- Is that okay?
- 9 is perfect.

401
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:10,290
- I'll pick you up at the gallery?
- Yeah, super.

402
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,000
Cool.

403
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,910
Good night, Frank.

404
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,700
Good night, Anna.

405
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,370
Stop staring.
You're missing a movie.

406
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,030
Franky? Hey, it's mommy.
Franky?

407
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,530
Franky, honey, where are you?

408
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,950
Franky?

409
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,410
Are you alright?

410
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,160
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,150
I'm fine.

412
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,900
So what'd you think?

413
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:00,990
<i>You know, Caligari is
to be the first horror movie.</i>

414
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,450
I really thought she was gonna
get killed at the end.

415
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:06,200
I'm glad that she didn't.

416
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,030
Yeah, but they all end up living
in a mental hospital.

417
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:13,450
I know but at least
it was a happy ending.

418
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,820
I may have just found
the last romantic.

419
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:21,280
Sorry.

420
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:25,570
Hello?

421
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,030
Yeah.

422
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,830
Where are you?

423
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,700
Yeah, okay. Cool.

424
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,700
Yeah, I would love to.

425
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:39,110
Okay, I'll call you back
in 5 minutes. Ciao.

426
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,210
It's my boyfriend.
He's at a bar having a drink.

427
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,580
You wanna have a drink with him?

428
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,540
Frank?
Are you okay?

429
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,450
- It's okay. I'm tired.
- Are you having another migraine?

430
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,610
No, I'm fine.

431
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,870
I just have some more work
I have to do at the shop.

432
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,910
Have fun, though.

433
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,410
- Let's have one drink.
- No.

434
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:03,910
- Just one.
- Really.

435
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,530
Come on.

436
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,410
- I had a very nice evening.
- Okay.

437
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,550
Another time, I guess.

438
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,240
Good night, Frank.

439
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,700
Goodbye, Anna.

440
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,580
<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>

441
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:13,200
Go wait for me in the car, Franky.

442
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,410
Don't just stand there.

443
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,780
Do as I tell you!

444
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,620
Go wait for me in the car,
goddamn it. Franky!

445
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:44,910
- Hey guys.
- Hey. Good show.

446
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,700
- Do you think?
- Absolutely.

447
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,530
- Really?
- It's great.

448
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:56,160
Are you serious?

449
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,110
One second.

450
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,780
- Hey Frank, I'm so happy to see you.
- Hello Anna.

451
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,750
- You look stunning.
- Thank you.

452
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,080
- Really, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

453
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,450
I just feel like I'm in
a carnival costume.

454
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:18,860
This heels make me walk
like an ostrich.

455
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,280
- I'm happy you made it, though.
- Me too.

456
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,200
- Your photos are breathtaking.
- Thank you.

457
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:32,290
The way you made the mannequins
come to life at the projections.

458
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,450
- Yeah.
- It's you, right?

459
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:36,490
Yeah, it's me.

460
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,000
My face on your mannequins.

461
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,990
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Yeah, sure.

462
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:15,330
You lose something?

463
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:20,530
Anna loves to hang out
with her gay friends.

464
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:25,120
I guess it's a way for a man never have to
worry about trying to fuck her.

465
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:32,410
You're the mannequin guy, right?

466
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,160
Lemme ask you something.

467
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,240
Did you play with dolls
when you were a kid?

468
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,490
- I'm not gay.
- What?

469
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,780
Good talk.

470
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:01,290
<i>A famous person once said:</i>

471
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:03,740
<i>An artist is somebody
who produces things,</i>

472
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,620
<i>that people don't need.</i>

473
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,900
You know...

474
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:12,830
Your work might interest
another client of mine,

475
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:18,530
whose general theme is destruction
of completely useless objects.

476
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,820
I'm sure he'd love to smash up
some of your mannequins

477
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,950
at his next photoshoot.

478
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,080
I'm in restoration.

479
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,740
So tell me, Fred

480
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:32,030
How does the restoration
process take place?

481
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:35,870
Do you go dumpster diving,
department stores garbage bins

482
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:37,990
in search of used parts?

483
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,660
They're antiques.
You wouldn't find them in dumpsters.

484
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:45,030
Honestly, I just find
the whole thing really creepy.

485
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,700
You and Anna are the perfect fit.

486
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,240
- Do you have a card?
- No.

487
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:54,070
- Let me see if I have a pen.
- Dominique!

488
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,750
Gorgeous!

489
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:05,070
- Any buyers?
- A few offers.

490
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,410
But don't worry, the real money's
in New York. Okay?

491
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,690
- Okay, should I call you a cab?
- No, I don't live far. I think I'll walk.

492
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:17,660
- I can call you a cab.
- No, no, no. You go have fun, fun, fun.

493
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,490
- Okay.
- And congratulations.

494
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,650
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Bye, sweetheart.

495
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,030
- What's wrong with you?
- I guess I...

496
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,290
Why do you always
have to do this?

497
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:27,530
- Welcome back.
- It's nice to see you.

498
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,570
- Hey Jimmy. Have you been good?
- Excellent.

499
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:40,570
Changing your makeup
and hair style didn't fool me.

500
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:46,870
You didn't think I'd recognize you?

501
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:48,780
Why?

502
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:51,830
Cause you think I'm stupid?

503
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:55,780
Why do you act like
I don't exist?

504
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:02,540
I never wanted to hurt you.

505
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:06,120
But you made me.

506
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:08,320
Didn't you?

507
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,280
Yes.

508
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:17,080
Yes, you did.

509
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:30,120
Did you need to be
with all of them? Huh?

510
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,240
Did you?

511
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,410
Was it the money?

512
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,910
Answer me!

513
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,120
You knew, they didn't love you.

514
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:54,280
Not like I loved you.

515
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,290
Not like me.

516
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,570
I still love you.

517
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,780
You know that?

518
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,530
Please don't kill me.

519
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:26,440
- Please don't kill me.
- Oh. I'm not gonna kill you.

520
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:29,910
I'm gonna keep you.

521
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:35,740
Mommy.

522
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:50,330
You will not go out tonight.
Is that clear?

523
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:53,250
You will stay home with me.

524
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:30,790
Hey, it's Anna.
Leave a message after the tone.

525
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,080
Hi Anna. It's Frank.

526
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,370
I'm sorry to bother you
at this hour.

527
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:39,660
I just wanted to know how long
you wanted to keep the mannequins.

528
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:42,070
I have another client...

529
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,250
Anna? What's wrong?
Are you okay?

530
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:51,030
Rita, my agent...

531
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,320
She was murdered last night
in her apartment.

532
01:05:53,490 --> 01:05:56,200
Murdered?
Oh my god.

533
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,740
Police just called me,
asking me so many questions.

534
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,540
Someone broke into her place.

535
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:06,660
They must have been
waiting for her.

536
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:09,450
Frank, it's awful.

537
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:12,820
I can't believe it.
I swear it's a nightmare.

538
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:17,040
You shouldn't be alone now.
Is your boyfriend with you?

539
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:21,150
No. He's back in New York already.

540
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,320
Do you need company?

541
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:27,120
- No, it's okay.
- No, don't be silly.

542
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:31,200
It's no bother.
That's what friends are for, right?

543
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:35,540
- I don't wanna trouble you with this.
- Anna, I'll be there in 30 minutes.

544
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:55,150
I know.

545
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,530
Me too.
I miss her too.

546
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,610
It's been a long time.

547
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:04,860
I'm gonna get her back.
I promise.

548
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:23,910
Come in.

549
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:28,080
I didn't hear the intercom.

550
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,740
One of your neighbors
was walking out when I got here.

551
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:34,910
I saw your name on the mailbox.
I hope you don't mind.

552
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:38,080
I'm happy to see you.

553
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:45,990
Oh, I didn't know you had company.

554
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,360
I don't mean to intrude.

555
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,660
Martin lives next door.

556
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:54,830
- Did you guys not meet at the show?
- No but I've heard a lot about you.

557
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:58,740
- Martin Nunez.
- Frank.

558
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:06,330
He's a stylist.
He's helping me with the mannequins.

559
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:08,160
Yes but I'm really an actor.

560
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,820
I actually just booked
my first national, so...

561
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:12,830
I don't know what that means.

562
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,490
It's a national commercial.
For Sparkle toothpaste.

563
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:18,620
- See
- Ding!

564
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,700
Alright well...
I'm gonna leave you guys.

565
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:25,780
I actually have an audition
first thing in the morning.

566
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,160
So, if you'll excuse me...

567
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:33,990
- Oh honey. It's gonna be fine.
- Thank you.

568
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:37,280
Take good care of her, Frank.

569
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:39,490
See you.

570
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,870
It must've been
a very long day for you.

571
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:52,660
I know what it feels
like to lose someone.

572
01:08:52,820 --> 01:08:54,870
I'm here for you, Anna.

573
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:00,160
Why would your boyfriend leave
for New York now?

574
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:05,740
Oh, we got into such
a fight after the show.

575
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,000
It's always about him and...

576
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,780
I don't even know what I was thinking
hooking up with that guy.

577
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:15,110
Really. He's such a music guy.

578
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,450
Huh, they can be very pompous.

579
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,740
Yeah.

580
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,120
I'm gonna make us coffee, okay?

581
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:30,500
That was the first day we met.

582
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,610
I didn't take care of her.

583
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,240
I was too busy talking to other people
and she left by herself.

584
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,370
Don't blame yourself.

585
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,860
It's really not your fault.

586
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:05,910
Just try to let go.

587
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:08,410
I know what you need.

588
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:15,500
I'm so tense.

589
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:54,990
You know, hair is the only part
of the body that lasts forever.

590
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,900
I'm sorry, I can't.

591
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:00,490
- I should've sent her home.
- Anna.

592
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:02,780
She knew what she was doing.

593
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:05,080
She lived 3 blocks away.

594
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,830
What were the chances
of her getting attacked?

595
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:13,580
Other girls were killed
and you had nothing to do with them.

596
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:16,450
Believe me, it's not your fault.

597
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:23,740
I asked Rita needed a ride
and that's when she told me.

598
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,990
- Told you what?
- Where she lived.

599
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,330
Isn't that what you were wondering?
How I knew?

600
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:33,790
I was just wondering what other girls
you were talking about.

601
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:37,490
The girls that were mutilated
and murdered.

602
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:41,320
It's all over the news.

603
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,450
Rita had the same profile.

604
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,700
Don't you think?

605
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:50,240
The police never mentioned anything
about other girls.

606
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:54,490
It's probably an ongoing investigation.
That's why.

607
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:02,160
Anna, you need to relax.

608
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:05,660
- Let me massage you again.
- It's okay.

609
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:08,370
I- I would just

610
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:11,290
rather go to sleep, okay?

611
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,910
And we talk tomorrow.

612
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:16,660
I'm very tired.

613
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:18,530
Wait!

614
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:23,780
I came all over across town
to be with you in your time of need.

615
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:28,080
Well, I would rather be alone.

616
01:12:28,990 --> 01:12:30,450
Please.

617
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:32,910
Being alone isn't going
to help you.

618
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:35,610
Believe me. I know.

619
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:39,580
I'm just gonna ask you
to leave now. Please.

620
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:41,700
What's the matter, Anna?

621
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:44,490
I thought we've become friends,
you and I.

622
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:47,450
You sound like a stranger.

623
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:53,330
Why are you scared?

624
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:58,700
Anna, come.

625
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:01,490
I think we need to
have a little talk.

626
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:05,410
Get off me.

627
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:10,780
Just calm down.

628
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:15,160
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

629
01:13:15,990 --> 01:13:18,530
It seems that we need to
iron a few things.

630
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:21,040
You know what I mean, don't you?

631
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,450
Come, I think we need
to have a serious talk.

632
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,410
- Get off me!
- Let me explain it to you!

633
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:37,490
Get off!

634
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:51,030
Martin! Help me!

635
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,030
Help!

636
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:07,490
- What's the matter, Anna?
- Leave me alone.

637
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,580
Go away.
Please, go away.

638
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:12,860
<i>Anna, it's me, Martin.
Open the door.</i>

639
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:16,240
<i>Anna, what's happening in there?
Is everything alright?</i>

640
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,580
<i>Anna, open the door.</i>

641
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:30,700
- Anna?
- Martin!

642
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:33,610
- Anna, where are you?
- In the bathroom.

643
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:44,490
Anna, open up.

644
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,240
I'm sorry.

645
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:49,990
I'm sorry.
Open the door.

646
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,410
Open the door! Anna!

647
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:58,190
- Martin?
- No, it's not Martin.

648
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,330
It's just you and me.

649
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:04,370
Now open up and let me explain!

650
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:07,280
- Martin, are you okay?
- Anna.

651
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:09,370
It's me.

652
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,280
What's happening?

653
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:27,070
I came all across the town
to be with you in your time of need.

654
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,410
I'm sorry. Please.

655
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:33,490
Let's talk first.

656
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:35,540
Leave me alone!

657
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:38,160
- Just go.
- No.

658
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,820
- You need to understand.
- Go, please.

659
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:47,280
Put the knife down.

660
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,030
Put the knife, Anna.
Put the knife down.

661
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:54,410
Put the knife down!

662
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,250
Just calm down.

663
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,620
Calm down.

664
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:14,700
Just relax, just relax.

665
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:17,280
It's okay.

666
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:20,530
It's okay.

667
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:28,290
Okay.

668
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:50,160
<i>Patrol 19, stand by.
Code 4-8.</i>

669
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,870
<i>Possible suicide.
Marian Avenue 728.</i>

670
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:55,450
<i>This is 19, we're on our way.</i>

671
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,700
It's gonna be okay.

672
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:37,240
Anna, please!

673
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:47,700
Help!

674
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,160
Help!

675
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:57,580
Anna!

676
01:17:57,690 --> 01:17:59,540
Somebody?

677
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:07,450
Wait!
Anna!

678
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:39,080
- Help me!
- Anna.

679
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:41,240
- Stop the car!
- What are you doing?

680
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:43,660
- Help!
- No.

681
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:47,200
No! No, no, no!

682
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,580
Oh, no!

683
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:33,570
Anna! Why did you do that?

684
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,580
Didn't you understand?

685
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:44,660
I just wanted to be with you.

686
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:47,870
I just wanted to be with you, Anna.

687
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:51,200
I never touched you.

688
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:52,620
Not once.

689
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,360
Anna, I want to introduce you
to my mother.

690
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:30,900
We'll be together forever, Anna.

691
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:37,950
I promise.

692
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,660
No one will separate us again.

693
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:41,950
Hey Frank.

694
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:46,610
- Do you like my nipples, Frank?
- Shut up!

695
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,740
God, your hands are so warm.

696
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:52,330
- I'm gonna get you back, Frank.
- She's lying.

697
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:54,780
Please don't listen to her.
Don't listen to her.

698
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:58,200
Did you play with dolls
as a child, Fred?

699
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,370
You wanna take a bath?

700
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:02,660
- No.
- You wanna take a bubble bath?

701
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,070
No. I do not.

702
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:07,500
Now leave. Leave!

703
01:22:09,070 --> 01:22:12,070
Oh, Frank. What happened?

704
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:16,120
I knew you were in the locker,
you naughty boy.

705
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,740
Did you like what you saw, Frank?

706
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:21,250
Don't listen to them.
They're lying.

707
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,000
Frank, don't bring
any other girls home.

708
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:26,120
I get jealous.

709
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,870
I'm gonna tear you to pieces, Frank.

710
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:32,070
I don't even know them.
They're lying.

711
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,700
This is our home, Anna.

712
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:39,660
Welcome.

713
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,450
Welcome.

714
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:47,900
This is where we live now, Anna.

715
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:54,070
No, not you! Get out of here!

716
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,450
You hear me? Get out!

717
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:59,990
Don't come near her. She is mine!
Do you hear me?

718
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:01,660
Get away!

719
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:03,450
She belongs to me!

720
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:06,900
You will never understand
what we feel for one another.

721
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,160
Where is she? Where is she?

722
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,910
Answer me!

723
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:13,910
Get your hands off of me!

724
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:15,990
Please. Let go.

725
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:22,070
Ah, my leg!
