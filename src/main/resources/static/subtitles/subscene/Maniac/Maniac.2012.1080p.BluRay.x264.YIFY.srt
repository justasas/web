1
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,100
- What was that?
- Please remind me, never to go out with you.

2
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,690
- Fine, you don't have to.
- I won't.

3
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,310
Shut up! Stop laughing,
it's not funny.

4
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,270
- Are you okay?
- No.

5
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,890
Stupid shoes.

6
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,900
The fuck are you looking at?

7
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,180
But seriously, I've never seen
so many douchebags in one place.

8
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,100
- I don't know, that tall one was kinda hot.
- The Marilyn Manson?

9
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,140
- Hot!
- Gross!

10
00:01:21,205 --> 00:01:23,565
- You take this, I'll take the next one.
- You little freak.

11
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,270
- You're gonna go back in there, aren't you?
- Huh, no.

12
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,270
- Whatever.
- No.

13
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,310
- Bye, Judy.
- Bye, Stephanie.

14
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,470
- What the fuck?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You look so pretty.

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,720
- I had to just to scare you a little bit.
- Don't touch me.

16
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,315
I'm just trying to say hello,
you have such a pretty dress on.

17
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,220
Check it out, check it out...
We got a limo, we got weed, champagne.

18
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,520
<i>Just come hang with us.
Leave her alone.</i>

19
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,930
Why are you in a such a bad mood?

20
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,020
Can I have a cigarette at least?
Or something, a smile?

21
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,900
Fuck off.

22
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,020
She just threw a cigarette at me.

23
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,150
Bad vibe, bro.

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,020
- Not very nice.
- Not very nice.

25
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,430
Hi! Can you-

26
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,980
The fuck?!

27
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,020
<i>I see you too.</i>

28
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,560
That late and still out?

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,270
Better go home.

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,520
Oh, fuck.

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,350
<i>Okay.</i>

32
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,560
<i>I know where you live, Judy.</i>

33
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,640
<i>See you later.</i>

34
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,270
Yeah, I just got home.

35
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,060
God, I'm glad that's over.

36
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,300
I know.

37
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,680
It was just some old truck driver.

38
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,020
Yeah.

39
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,600
Ugh no, I didn't.
I just...

40
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,350
No, it freaked me out.

41
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,310
I know.

42
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,510
Yeah well, I blame you.

43
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,430
The stupid places you take me to.

44
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,350
Oh crap.

45
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,480
The lights are out on my floor.

46
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,650
Ok, bye.

47
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,640
- Where'd you park the car?
- It's downstairs.

48
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,270
- You got the address?
- Yeah. You better hurry, we're gonna be late.

49
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,430
Please don't scream.

50
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,100
You're so beautiful.

51
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:03,190
<b>MANIAC.</b>

52
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,480
Hello, Redlucie86.

53
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,270
<i>Truly timid?</i>

54
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,940
It's my first time on a dating site.

55
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,430
There's a reason
I'm called timid man.

56
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Picture...

57
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,440
That sounds lovely.

58
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,310
Why didn't you agree?

59
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,680
Of course I have.

60
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,190
- Lucie?
- Frank.

61
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,180
- Hi.
- Hi. It's very nice to meet you.

62
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,730
No charm, I'm sure.

63
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,270
- You are totally not what I imagined.
- Really? What did you imagine?

64
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,850
Umm, like fat, with long black hair

65
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,310
and just greasy skin full of acne.

66
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,400
Huh, you should've seen the other photo
I was going to send you.

67
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,100
I mean people always post
the best pictures of themselves

68
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,060
and then that's what something
is like when you meet them.

69
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,310
I ordered some wine.
I hope you don't mind.

70
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,100
No, I like a man
who takes control.

71
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,350
Thank you.

72
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,400
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

73
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,390
So, how long have you been using
the website?

74
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,650
Uhh, like six months, maybe?

75
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,470
But this is my first dinner date,
usually it's just for drinks.

76
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,080
Although I can already tell that
you are a breath of fresh air

77
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,810
for the jugheads I deal
with at the bar every night, ugh.

78
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,140
See, it's really easy to get over
with the testosterone at work, you know?

79
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,020
Yeah.

80
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,850
So, why don't you have
a girlfriend?

81
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,100
- I...
- Are you okay?

82
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,600
I just...

83
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,060
Frank, are you okay?

84
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,640
You look pale.

85
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,430
Is everything okay?

86
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,310
Well, excuse me, I-

87
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,020
I need to find the restroom.

88
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,560
Did that waiter even look Indian to you?
I think he looked more Mexican.

89
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,060
He was such a tool.

90
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,340
You know, it was really sweet
of you to drive me home.

91
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
I'm happy to do it.

92
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,230
I had a very lovely evening.

93
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,930
Did you wanna come up
for a drink?

94
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,640
Are you sure?

95
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,220
Uh, like I said -
begging really isn't my thing, so...

96
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,940
Right. Okay then.

97
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,560
Sounds nice.

98
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,810
So what's all that stuff
back there?

99
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,560
I thought you were a journalist
or something.

100
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,850
It's for a fashion shoot.

101
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,310
I'm just doing a favor
for a friend.

102
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,560
So where do you live, Frank?

103
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,310
Probably in some trendy loft
or something.

104
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,390
I mean my place isn't much
but it's all mine, so...

105
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,480
I'm done with roommates.

106
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,100
No, thank you.
I still have to drive home.

107
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,600
Yeah, but not now, right?

108
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,350
You should take off your coat
and stay for a little while.

109
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,560
Want me to put on some music?

110
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,260
I love this song.
Dance with me.

111
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,140
I think you're cute.

112
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,890
I'm gonna be right back.
You don't go anywhere.

113
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,060
You take a lot
of pictures of yourself.

114
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,480
Hi...

115
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,600
I wanted to slip into something
a little more comfortable.

116
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,400
So how about that coat?

117
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,350
Now it's your turn to do me.

118
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,010
Why... Why are you hiding?

119
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,850
I don't know.

120
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,510
They're little.

121
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,310
What do you think?
You wanna touch them?

122
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,590
You shouldn't be so scared,
timid man.

123
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,930
Your hands feel warm.

124
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,270
Squeeze them.

125
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,020
You can do it harder.

126
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,260
You wanna get rough playing?

127
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,930
Is that what you're into?

128
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,560
Are you gonna fuck me?

129
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,810
I can't. I can't.

130
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,270
Don't be a pussy.

131
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,140
You like it?

132
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,340
I like to keep the lights on too.

133
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,180
Don't be so horrified.

134
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,560
You just relax.

135
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,100
Why can't you leave them alone?

136
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,230
Why can't you leave any
of them alone?

137
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,520
Can I have just one

138
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,230
without you getting in the way?

139
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,980
Now look...

140
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,350
Look what you made me do.

141
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,140
Look what you made me do!

142
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:49,810
I hate you.

143
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,180
I hate you.

144
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,930
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

145
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,020
I'll make it better.

146
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,730
I'll make it all better now.

147
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,390
Sorry I missed you today.

148
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,350
I have a surprise for you.

149
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,730
Are you asleep already?

150
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:41,100
I'm sorry but I just can't wait.

151
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,690
Alright.

152
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,640
Take a look.

153
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,390
I saved the best for last.

154
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,810
Here we go.

155
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,600
Oh, that's nice.

156
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,220
Perfect fit, right?

157
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,890
Okay now, this might
sting a little.

158
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,390
Okay, good.

159
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,730
Good.

160
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,810
Just one more...

161
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,980
Perfect.

162
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,940
Perfect.

163
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,050
Meet Redlucie86.

164
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,260
Redlucie 86,
this is my girlfriend.

165
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,220
I know the two of you will
get along just fine.

166
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,680
Don't worry.

167
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,520
It's fine, it's fine.

168
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,440
What?
She's beautiful.

169
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,600
Why are you ignoring me, huh?

170
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,260
No, wait...

171
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,310
This is impossible.

172
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,770
No!

173
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,560
Why are you doing this to me?

174
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,680
What? You too?

175
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,690
Why?

176
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,520
You're just like her!
You two are the same thing as her!

177
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,520
Why are you doing this?

178
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,510
Why?

179
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,520
Hey.

180
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,350
I'm sorry to disturb you, uhm...

181
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,310
I was just taking pictures
of your mannequins in the window.

182
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,480
I hope that's okay?

183
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
- It's fine, I guess.
- Yeah?

184
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,640
Do you mind if I take pictures of them
with the gate open?

185
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,640
Okay, sure.

186
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,430
Yeah? Cool, thank you.

187
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:30,180
- What's this for?
- Oh, it's just fine art, I guess.

188
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,100
Here, take a look.

189
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,560
- Is that French? Your accent?
- Oui.

190
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,850
You have a good ear.

191
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,970
- What do you do exactly?
- I take pictures of mannequins.

192
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,810
I try to bring them
to life with light.

193
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,730
Okay, cool. Thank you.

194
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,270
Sorry to have disturbed you.

195
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,520
I'm not usually opened on weekends.

196
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,480
Well, thank you
for opening up for me.

197
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,930
Bye.

198
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,100
Would you like to see my work?

199
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,230
What do you do?

200
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,430
Are you an artist?

201
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,270
I don't know about all that.

202
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,680
Come in, maybe you can tell me.

203
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,640
It's amazing.

204
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,350
They're from all styles and eras.

205
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,060
I've restored most of them myself.

206
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,730
She's beautiful.

207
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,350
I love her.

208
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,850
- What year is this from?
- Thirties.

209
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,640
She's in great condition.

210
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,180
You know what...

211
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,100
I'm having a show for my photos
in a gallery downtown.

212
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,390
Maybe I could use some of your
mannequins for my photoshoot.

213
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,510
That would be incredible, I mean...

214
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,810
They're so much more unique than
the ones I've been shooting with.

215
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,850
- Is this your place?
- Yes.

216
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,930
- You bought it?
- It was my family's.

217
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,890
Been restoring them
for three generations now.

218
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,480
Who's Angela?

219
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,260
The name on the sign.

220
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,060
It was my mother.
She's gone.

221
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,270
I'm sorry.

222
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,730
- Do you live here?
- Thank you for coming.

223
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,430
Sorry, I'm a little nosy.

224
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,770
I mean this place is so special.

225
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,810
So what do you think
if I rent them?

226
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,940
Uh, I'm not sure...

227
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:23,720
I usually try to find permanent
homes for them.

228
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,400
You're funny.

229
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,930
Well, I can adopt them.

230
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,100
What about that?

231
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:36,430
I'll give you my number.

232
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:45,180
So if you change your mind, I promise
to have them home before midnight.

233
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,180
I can be a good mother.

234
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,810
- My name's Anna.
- Thank you.

235
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,930
Call me, please.

236
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,730
Oh and by the way...

237
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,850
You have lipstick on your face.

238
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,680
Have a great day.

239
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,680
Oh no. No, no, no.

240
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,770
No. Get out.

241
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,600
Get out.

242
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,680
Get out.

243
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,640
Get out. Go.

244
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,600
Go.

245
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,480
That's disgusting.

246
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,430
- Move it!
- I'm just waiting for my wife.

247
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,470
You have ten seconds
before I give you a sanitation.

248
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,980
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!

249
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,560
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

250
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
I got my stuff.

251
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,310
Ugh, can you turn this on?

252
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,650
- I'm sorry!
- Shit, you scared me!

253
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,640
I forgot my tights.

254
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,560
- Hey, do you mind waiting for me, please?
- Sure, yeah.

255
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,850
Thanks.

256
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,890
I can't believe you shoved me in my locker.

257
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,730
Don't be tight.

258
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,060
- It was just a joke.
- Come on...

259
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,890
I could've broke my ankle.

260
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,390
- It still hurts.
- You're such a prick.

261
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,720
- But seriously.
- Tough it up.

262
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:45,550
- Come on girl, just come out with us.
- One drink.

263
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,310
- No.
- Come on, hun.

264
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,010
- Why don't you wanna come out?
- I'm going home.

265
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,810
- You never come out with us.
- What's up with that?

266
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:54,400
- The car's right up there.
- No way.

267
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,100
- You guys, I think I really hurt
my leg bad today. - Really?

268
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,600
- How?
- I went so fast with that twitch at.

269
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,680
I really don't think those tights
are any better.

270
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,220
- Good night, girls.
- Good night.

271
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,430
- Get home safe.
- Bye.

272
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:13,600
Text me, let me know.
Good night.

273
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,690
Oh, fuck.

274
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:41,310
- You're so beautiful.
- Shit.

275
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,850
Oh, shit.

276
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,230
What the fuck?!

277
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,850
Leave me the fuck alone!

278
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Get away from me.

279
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,230
Somebody! Help me!

280
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,260
What the fuck?
Where is everyone?

281
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,310
Please, help me!

282
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,180
Please! Help me.

283
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,220
Help me!

284
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,640
Somebody! Open it!

285
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,300
Please!

286
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,930
Hey!

287
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,900
Please.

288
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,600
Open the gate, come on!

289
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,970
Oh fuck.

290
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,760
No, no.

291
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,060
Shit.
Oh, shit.

292
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,690
Fuck!

293
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,060
Oh, fuck.

294
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,850
No! No!

295
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,190
Please!

296
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,060
No!

297
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,550
Please.

298
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,890
No!

299
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,390
No!

300
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,680
Stop looking at me,
focus on your work.

301
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:49,970
- Anna, can you give me a hand?
- Yeah, sure. What do you need?

302
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,850
A hand, behind you.

303
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,940
- Which one?
- Second row.

304
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:59,560
- This one?
- The one on the right.

305
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,310
Oh, sorry.

306
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,010
Doctor Frankenstein, I presume.

307
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,400
- Are you a fan of those old films?
- For sure.

308
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,470
Okay, so what do you think
about my idea

309
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,720
of putting the mannequins among
the guests at the show?

310
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,900
You could see them mingling,
like they're real people.

311
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,890
Sometimes I think they have
more personality than most people.

312
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,140
I think we may have some
of the same friends.

313
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:40,720
- So, what do you think?
- I think you're incredibly talented.

314
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,930
- Well, that makes two of us then.
- Not really.

315
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,060
- I'm just a restorer.
- That one's my favorite.

316
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,720
Okay, now you show me.

317
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,270
It's amazing.

318
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:05,050
- It's gonna be perfect, Frank.
- I'm glad you like them.

319
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,940
- I love them.
- Why did you want them to be faceless?

320
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:12,230
Oh, I have a little idea for the show.
You'll see.

321
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,140
Okay, I'm starving. Are you hungry?
You wanna grab some lunch with me?

322
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,550
It's my third exhibition since
I've graduated from art center.

323
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,900
But it's my first with this gallery.

324
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,600
If it's successful they'll give me a show
in their other galleries in New York.

325
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,060
If something was missing...
Something tangible relating to the concept-

326
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,090
The installation of your mannequins
with create the ambiance I was looking for.

327
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:39,890
You know, when you came into my shop
you looked at them

328
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,900
like no one else ever did.

329
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,600
You seem captivated.

330
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,230
- You must have thought I was crazy.
- No.

331
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,810
You were so soulful with them.
So present.

332
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,890
When my mother died last summer,
I wasn't so sure what to do with our shop.

333
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:58,260
Most stores couldn't care less about restoring
antiques. It's cheaper to buy them new.

334
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,940
And if I closed the shop
I would've had to abandon them.

335
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,300
It's like me and my old negatives.

336
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,850
I have boxes full of them but I could
never see myself getting rid of them.

337
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,140
Sometimes it's hard to move on.

338
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,480
So what does your girlfriend
think of your work?

339
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,640
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- Really? Okay...

340
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,180
I thought you lived with someone.

341
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,890
Frank?

342
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,800
- Are you okay? - It's nothing.
- It's just a migraine. It'll pass.

343
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:33,600
- Should I call a doctor?
- No, no, no-I'll be fine.

344
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,890
I just need my meds.
I'm used to it.

345
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:41,180
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Are you sure you don't need help here?

346
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,100
No, thanks.
I just need to be alone.

347
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,020
Watch it, fuck face.

348
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,890
Are you suffering from a migraine?

349
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:07,810
This will have a similar effect
but you won't need a prescription for it.

350
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,230
- And it comes in a nasal spray, so it'll work faster.
- Thank you.

351
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,310
<i>We have found links connecting
the two victims in mid-town.</i>

352
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:53,680
<i>But as our investigation
is still developing.</i>

353
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,270
<i>I can not give you
any more details.</i>

354
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:59,470
<i>All I can say is that all
of these women were Caucasian,</i>

355
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,510
between the ages of 20-30.

356
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,810
They can talk all they want.

357
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,020
But they will never understand.

358
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,520
As long as you keep a secret.

359
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,010
But if you can't, it'll find you...

360
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,150
and you'll be alone.

361
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,100
You hear that?!

362
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,770
The lot of you.

363
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:20,640
Alone.

364
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,060
- Now promise me you won't tell.
- Franky?!

365
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,060
Hey, it's mommy.

366
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,600
Franky, honey, where are you?

367
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,560
Franky!

368
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,640
Come here.

369
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,440
Shh, momma loves you.

370
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,890
Hey.

371
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,180
The necklace is beautiful, Frank.
Thank you so much.

372
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:38,940
- Did you make it?
- I did.

373
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,850
That's original.

374
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,900
Where did you get the stone?

375
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,890
It's something I found
in a thrift store.

376
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,770
Is that real hair?
What is it?

377
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,060
- I believe it's horse hair.
- That's interesting.

378
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,270
And what about you?
Are you feeling better?

379
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:58,640
Oh, sure.
I've had migraines since I was a kid.

380
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,230
I forgot to take my medicine, so...

381
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:04,810
It's really nothing.
Sorry if I've frightened you.

382
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,650
- It's okay.
- I just finished on-

383
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:15,970
Um, you know-Sometimes I feel like
you come from another era.

384
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,680
I love it.
It makes you very different.

385
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,730
One second, Frank.
I'm sorry.

386
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,810
Thank you so much.

387
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:25,640
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

388
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,180
Sorry Frank, a friend of mine
was helping me and I had to say goodbye.

389
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,390
I sometimes feel like
a slave-driver, you know?

390
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,270
- I hate it.
- I can't say I know what you mean.

391
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,640
I've always worked alone.

392
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:46,930
- You never feel lonely?
- Yeah.

393
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,810
That's why I was calling.

394
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,150
I thought if you weren't
doing anything...

395
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,550
I would love to.

396
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,930
But I have so much to do tonight.

397
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:58,640
But what about tomorrow?
We could do something.

398
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,650
Okay, yeah.
Tomorrow night works.

399
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,480
- What time?
- Nine?

400
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,760
- Is that okay?
- Nine is perfect.

401
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:12,190
- I'll pick you up at the gallery?
- Yeah, super.

402
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:13,900
Cool.

403
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:15,810
Good night, Frank.

404
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:17,600
Good night, Anna.

405
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,270
Stop staring.
You're missing a movie.

406
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,930
Franky? Hey, it's mommy.
Franky?

407
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,430
Franky, honey, where are you?

408
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,850
Franky?

409
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,310
Are you alright?

410
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,060
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,050
I'm fine.

412
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,800
So what'd you think?

413
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:02,890
<i>You know, Caligari is -
to be the first horror movie.</i>

414
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,350
I really thought she was gonna
get killed at the end.

415
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,100
I'm glad that she didn't.

416
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,930
Yeah, but they all end up living
in a mental hospital.

417
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:15,350
I know but at least
it was a happy ending.

418
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,720
I may have just found
the last romantic.

419
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,180
Sorry.

420
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:27,470
Hello?

421
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:28,930
Yeah.

422
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,730
Where are you?

423
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:34,600
Yeah, okay. Cool.

424
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,600
Yeah, I would love to.

425
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:41,010
Okay, I'll call you back
in five minutes. Ciao.

426
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,110
It's my boyfriend.
He's at a bar having a drink.

427
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:48,480
You wanna have a drink with him?

428
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:52,440
Frank?
Are you okay?

429
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:55,350
- It's okay. I'm tired.
- Are you having another migraine?

430
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,510
No, I'm fine.

431
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,770
I just have some more work
I have to do at the shop.

432
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:01,810
Have fun, though.

433
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:04,310
- Let's have one drink.
- No.

434
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:05,810
- Just one.
- Really.

435
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:07,430
Come on.

436
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,310
- I had a very nice evening.
- Okay.

437
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,450
Another time, I guess.

438
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,140
Good night, Frank.

439
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:31,600
Goodbye, Anna.

440
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,480
<i>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>

441
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:15,100
Go wait for me in the car, Franky.

442
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,310
Don't just stand there.

443
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:22,680
Do as I tell you!

444
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:33,520
Go wait for me in the car,
goddamn it. Franky!

445
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,810
- Hey guys.
- Hey. Good show.

446
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:48,600
- Do you think?
- Absolutely.

447
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,430
- Really?
- It's great.

448
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:58,060
Are you serious?

449
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:03,010
One second.

450
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,680
- Hey Frank, I'm so happy to see you.
- Hello Anna.

451
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,650
- You look stunning.
- Thank you.

452
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,980
- Really, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

453
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,350
I just feel like I'm in
a carnival costume.

454
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:20,760
This heels make me walk
like an ostrich.

455
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,180
- I'm happy you made it, though.
- Me too.

456
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:30,100
- Your photos are breathtaking.
- Thank you.

457
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,190
The way you made the mannequins
come to life at the projections.

458
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:36,350
- Yeah.
- It's you, right?

459
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,390
Yeah, it's me.

460
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,900
My face on your mannequins.

461
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,890
- Will you excuse me for a moment?
- Yeah, sure.

462
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:17,230
You lose something?

463
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:22,430
Anna loves to hang out
with her gay friends.

464
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:27,020
I guess it's a way for a man never have to
worry about trying to fuck her.

465
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:34,310
You're the mannequin guy, right?

466
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,060
Lemme ask you something.

467
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:39,140
Did you play with dolls
when you were a kid?

468
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:42,390
- I'm not gay.
- What?

469
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,680
Good talk.

470
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,190
<i>A famous person once said:</i>

471
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,640
<i>An artist is somebody
who produces things,</i>

472
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,520
<i>that people don't need.</i>

473
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,800
You know...

474
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:14,730
Your work might interest
another client of mine,

475
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:20,430
whose general theme is destruction
of completely useless objects.

476
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:23,720
I'm sure he'd love to smash up
some of your mannequins

477
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,850
at his next photoshoot.

478
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,980
I'm in restoration.

479
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:30,640
So tell me, Fred-

480
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,930
How does the restoration
process take place?

481
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:37,770
Do you go dumpster diving,
department stores garbage bins

482
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,890
in search of used parts?

483
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:43,560
They're antiques.
You wouldn't find them in dumpsters.

484
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,930
Honestly, I just find
the whole thing really creepy.

485
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:49,600
You and Anna are the perfect fit.

486
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,140
- Do you have a card?
- No.

487
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,970
- Let me see if I have a pen.
- Dominique!

488
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,650
Gorgeous!

489
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:06,970
- Any buyers?
- A few offers.

490
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,310
But don't worry, the real money's
in New York. Okay?

491
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:15,590
- Okay, should I call you a cab?
- No, I don't live far. I think I'll walk.

492
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,560
- I can call you a cab.
- No, no, no. You go have fun, fun, fun.

493
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,390
- Okay.
- And congratulations.

494
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:23,550
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Bye, sweetheart.

495
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,930
- What's wrong with you?
- I guess I...

496
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:29,190
Why do you always
have to do this?

497
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:29,430
- Welcome back.
- It's nice to see you.

498
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:31,470
- Hey Jimmy. Have you been good?
- Excellent.

499
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:42,470
Changing your makeup
and hair style didn't fool me.

500
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,770
You didn't think I'd recognize you?

501
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:50,680
Why?

502
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,730
'Cause you think I'm stupid?

503
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:57,680
Why do you act like
I don't exist?

504
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:04,440
I never wanted to hurt you.

505
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:08,020
But you made me.

506
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:10,220
Didn't you?

507
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,180
Yes.

508
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:18,980
Yes, you did.

509
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,020
Did you need to be
with all of them? Huh?

510
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,140
Did you?

511
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:38,310
Was it the money?

512
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,810
Answer me!

513
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,020
You knew, they didn't love you.

514
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:56,180
Not like I loved you.

515
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,190
Not like me.

516
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:04,470
I still love you.

517
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,680
You know that?

518
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,430
Please don't kill me.

519
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,340
- Please don't kill me.
- Oh. I'm not gonna kill you.

520
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:31,810
I'm gonna keep you.

521
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:37,640
Mommy.

522
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:52,230
You will not go out tonight.
Is that clear?

523
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,150
You will stay home with me.

524
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:32,690
Hey, it's Anna.
Leave a message after the tone.

525
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,980
Hi Anna. It's Frank.

526
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,270
I'm sorry to bother you
at this hour.

527
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:41,560
I just wanted to know how long
you wanted to keep the mannequins.

528
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,970
I have another client...

529
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,150
Anna? What's wrong?
Are you okay?

530
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:52,930
Rita, my agent...

531
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,220
She was murdered last night
in her apartment.

532
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:58,100
Murdered?
Oh my God.

533
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:01,640
Police just called me,
asking me so many questions.

534
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:05,440
Someone broke into her place.

535
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:08,560
They must have been
waiting for her.

536
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,350
Frank, it's awful.

537
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:14,720
I can't believe it.
I swear it's a nightmare.

538
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:18,940
You shouldn't be alone now.
Is your boyfriend with you?

539
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,050
No. He's back in New York already.

540
01:06:23,220 --> 01:06:25,220
Do you need company?

541
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:29,020
- No, it's okay.
- No, don't be silly.

542
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:33,100
It's no bother.
That's what friends are for, right?

543
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:37,440
- I don't wanna trouble you with this.
- Anna, I'll be there in 30 minutes.

544
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:57,050
I know.

545
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,430
Me too.
I miss her too.

546
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,510
It's been a long time.

547
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,760
I'm gonna get her back.
I promise.

548
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:25,810
Come in.

549
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,980
I didn't hear the intercom.

550
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,640
One of your neighbors
was walking out when I got here.

551
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,810
I saw your name on the mailbox.
I hope you don't mind.

552
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,980
I'm happy to see you.

553
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,890
Oh, I didn't know you had company.

554
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:50,260
I don't mean to intrude.

555
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,560
Martin lives next door.

556
01:07:54,025 --> 01:07:56,905
- Did you guys not meet at the show?
- No but I've heard a lot about you.

557
01:07:56,930 --> 01:08:00,640
- Martin Nunez.
- Frank.

558
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:08,230
He's a stylist.
He's helping me with the mannequins.

559
01:08:08,390 --> 01:08:10,060
Yes but I'm really an actor.

560
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,720
I actually just booked
my first national, so...

561
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:14,730
I don't know what that means.

562
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:18,390
It's a national commercial.
For Sparkle toothpaste.

563
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:20,520
- See.
- Ding!

564
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,600
Alright well...
I'm gonna leave you guys.

565
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,680
I actually have an audition
first thing in the morning.

566
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,060
So, if you'll excuse me...

567
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:35,890
- Oh honey. It's gonna be fine.
- Thank you.

568
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,180
Take good care of her, Frank.

569
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:41,390
See you.

570
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:47,770
It must've been
a very long day for you.

571
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:54,560
I know what it feels
like to lose someone.

572
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,770
I'm here for you, Anna.

573
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,060
Why would your boyfriend leave
for New York now?

574
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,640
Oh, we got into such
a fight after the show.

575
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,900
It's always about him and...

576
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:13,680
I don't even know what I was thinking
hooking up with that guy.

577
01:09:13,890 --> 01:09:17,010
Really. He's such a music guy.

578
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,350
Huh, they can be very pompous.

579
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:21,640
Yeah.

580
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:27,020
I'm gonna make us coffee, okay?

581
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:32,400
That was the first day we met.

582
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:42,510
I didn't take care of her.

583
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:50,140
I was too busy talking to other people
and she left by herself.

584
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,270
Don't blame yourself.

585
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,760
It's really not your fault.

586
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:07,810
Just try to let go.

587
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:10,310
I know what you need.

588
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:17,400
I'm so tense.

589
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:56,890
You know, hair is the only part
of the body that lasts forever.

590
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:58,800
I'm sorry, I can't.

591
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:02,390
- I should've sent her home.
- Anna.

592
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:04,680
She knew what she was doing.

593
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:06,980
She lived three blocks away.

594
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,730
What were the chances
of her getting attacked?

595
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:15,480
Other girls were killed
and you had nothing to do with them.

596
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:18,350
Believe me, it's not your fault.

597
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:25,640
I asked Rita needed a ride
and that's when she told me.

598
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,890
- Told you what?
- Where she lived.

599
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:32,230
Isn't that what you were wondering?
How I knew?

600
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:35,690
I was just wondering what other girls
you were talking about.

601
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:39,390
The girls that were mutilated
and murdered.

602
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:43,220
It's all over the news.

603
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,350
Rita had the same profile.

604
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,600
Don't you think?

605
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:52,140
The police never mentioned anything
about other girls.

606
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,390
It's probably an ongoing investigation.
That's why.

607
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:04,060
Anna, you need to relax.

608
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:07,560
- Let me massage you again.
- It's okay.

609
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,270
I- I would just

610
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:13,190
rather go to sleep, okay?

611
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,810
And we talk tomorrow.

612
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:18,560
I'm very tired.

613
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,430
Wait!

614
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:25,680
I came all over across town
to be with you in your time of need.

615
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:29,980
Well, I would rather be alone.

616
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:32,350
Please.

617
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:34,810
Being alone isn't going
to help you.

618
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,510
Believe me. I know.

619
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:41,480
I'm just gonna ask you
to leave now. Please.

620
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,600
What's the matter, Anna?

621
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,390
I thought we've become friends,
you and I.

622
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:49,350
You sound like a stranger.

623
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:55,230
Why are you scared?

624
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:00,600
Anna, come.

625
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:03,390
I think we need to
have a little talk.

626
01:13:05,390 --> 01:13:07,310
Get off me.

627
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,680
Just calm down.

628
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,060
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

629
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:20,430
It seems that we need to
iron a few things.

630
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:22,940
You know what I mean, don't you?

631
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,350
Come, I think we need
to have a serious talk.

632
01:13:33,390 --> 01:13:36,310
- Get off me!
- Let me explain it to you!

633
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:39,390
Get off!

634
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,930
Martin! Help me!

635
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,930
Help!

636
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:09,390
- What's the matter, Anna?
- Leave me alone.

637
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:11,480
Go away.
Please, go away.

638
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,760
<i>Anna, it's me, Martin.
Open the door.</i>

639
01:14:14,970 --> 01:14:18,140
<i>Anna, what's happening in there?
Is everything alright?</i>

640
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:24,480
<i>Anna, open the door.</i>

641
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:32,600
- Anna?
- Martin!

642
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,510
- Anna, where are you?
- In the bathroom.

643
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:46,390
Anna, open up.

644
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:48,140
I'm sorry.

645
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,890
I'm sorry.
Open the door.

646
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:55,310
Open the door! Anna!

647
01:14:56,890 --> 01:15:00,090
- Martin?
- No, it's not Martin.

648
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:02,230
It's just you and me.

649
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:06,270
Now open up and let me explain!

650
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:09,180
- Martin, are you okay?
- Anna.

651
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,270
It's me.

652
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:18,180
What's happening?

653
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:28,970
I came all across the town
to be with you in your time of need.

654
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,310
I'm sorry. Please.

655
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:35,390
Let's talk first.

656
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:37,440
Leave me alone!

657
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,060
- Just go.
- No.

658
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:43,720
- You need to understand.
- Go, please.

659
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:49,180
Put the knife down.

660
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,930
Put the knife, Anna.
Put the knife down.

661
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:56,310
Put the knife down!

662
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:10,150
Just calm down.

663
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,520
Calm down.

664
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:16,600
Just relax, just relax.

665
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,180
It's okay.

666
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,430
It's okay.

667
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:30,190
Okay.

668
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:52,060
<i>Patrol 19, stand by.
Code 4-8.</i>

669
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:54,770
<i>Possible suicide.
Marian Avenue 728.</i>

670
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:57,350
<i>This is 19, we're on our way.</i>

671
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:12,600
It's gonna be okay.

672
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:39,140
Anna, please!

673
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:49,600
Help!

674
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:54,060
Help!

675
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,480
Anna!

676
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:01,440
Somebody?

677
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,350
Wait!
Anna!

678
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,980
- Help me!
- Anna.

679
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:43,140
- Stop the car!
- What are you doing?

680
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,560
- Help!
- No.

681
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:49,100
No! No, no, no!

682
01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:19,480
Oh, no!

683
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:35,470
Anna! Why did you do that?

684
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:43,480
Didn't you understand?

685
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:46,560
I just wanted to be with you.

686
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:49,770
I just wanted to be with you, Anna.

687
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:53,100
I never touched you.

688
01:19:53,470 --> 01:19:54,520
Not once.

689
01:19:57,390 --> 01:20:00,260
Anna, I want to introduce you
to my mother.

690
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:32,800
We'll be together forever, Anna.

691
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:39,850
I promise.

692
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:46,560
No one will separate us again.

693
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,850
Hey Frank.

694
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:48,510
- Do you like my nipples, Frank?
- Shut up!

695
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:51,640
God, your hands are so warm.

696
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:54,230
- I'm gonna get you back, Frank.
- She's lying.

697
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:56,680
Please don't listen to her.
Don't listen to her.

698
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,100
Did you play with dolls
as a child, Fred?

699
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,270
You wanna take a bath?

700
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:04,560
- No.
- You wanna take a bubble bath?

701
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,970
No. I do not.

702
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:09,400
Now leave. Leave!

703
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:13,970
Oh, Frank. What happened?

704
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:18,020
I knew you were in the locker,
you naughty boy.

705
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,640
Did you like what you saw, Frank?

706
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,150
Don't listen to them.
They're lying.

707
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,900
Frank, don't bring
any other girls home.

708
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:28,020
I get jealous.

709
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:30,770
I'm gonna tear you to pieces, Frank.

710
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:33,970
I don't even know them.
They're lying.

711
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:39,600
This is our home, Anna.

712
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,560
Welcome.

713
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,350
Welcome.

714
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:49,800
This is where we live now, Anna.

715
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,970
No, not you! Get out of here!

716
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,350
You hear me? Get out!

717
01:22:58,470 --> 01:23:01,890
Don't come near her. She is mine!
Do you hear me?

718
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:03,560
Get away!

719
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,350
She belongs to me!

720
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:08,800
You will never understand
what we feel for one another.

721
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:11,060
Where is she? Where is she?

722
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:12,810
Answer me!

723
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:15,810
Get your hands off of me!

724
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:17,890
Please. Let go.

725
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:23,970
Ah, my leg!
