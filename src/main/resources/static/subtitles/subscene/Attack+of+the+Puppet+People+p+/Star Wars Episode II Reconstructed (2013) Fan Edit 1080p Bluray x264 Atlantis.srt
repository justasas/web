1
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,554
Cordé.

2
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:42,664
No.

3
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,928
Milady, you're still in danger here.

4
00:03:53,414 --> 00:03:56,679
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

5
00:03:57,725 --> 00:03:59,818
Senator Amidala, please.

6
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:08,022
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

7
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,665
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

8
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:13,599
If they do break away...

9
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:16,968
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

10
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:19,132
be split in two.

11
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:22,211
My negotiations will not fail.

12
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:24,877
If they do, you must realize...

13
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,074
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

14
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,714
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

15
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,883
Master Yoda...

16
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:37,520
do you think it will
really come to war?

17
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:43,329
The dark side clouds everything.

18
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:48,393
Impossible to see the future is.

19
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,471
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.

20
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:54,565
Good.

21
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:59,274
Send them in.

22
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,215
We will discuss this matter later.

23
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:10,291
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform...

24
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,293
terrible.

25
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:16,191
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

26
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:19,029
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

27
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:23,731
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

28
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:26,700
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

29
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,712
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

30
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:33,806
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

31
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,018
But for certain, Senator...

32
00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:40,961
in grave danger you are.

33
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:44,633
Master Jedi, may I suggest...

34
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:48,831
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

35
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,000
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

36
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:54,236
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...

37
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:56,677
The situation is that serious?

38
00:05:57,248 --> 00:05:59,239
No, but I do, Senator.

39
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,683
I realize all too well
that additional security...

40
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:06,279
might be disruptive for you...

41
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,052
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

42
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:13,193
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

43
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:15,589
That's possible.

44
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,430
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

45
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:21,731
Do it for me, milady. Please?

46
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,239
The thought of losing you...

47
00:06:25,777 --> 00:06:27,836
is unbearable.

48
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:31,910
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

49
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,246
Thank you, Master Windu.

50
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:45,407
You seem a little on edge.

51
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:48,596
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

52
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:06,015
Obi? Obi!

53
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,617
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!

54
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,893
Desa Jedi arriven.

55
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,796
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

56
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,395
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

57
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:25,417
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

58
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:30,651
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

59
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,687
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

60
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:38,267
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

61
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:40,427
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

62
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:42,664
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

63
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:45,537
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

64
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:48,338
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

65
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:50,675
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

66
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:54,615
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

67
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:57,118
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

68
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,051
I promise you.

69
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:01,886
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

70
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:04,961
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

71
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:07,563
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

72
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:11,149
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

73
00:08:17,043 --> 00:08:19,068
Perhaps with merely your presence...

74
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:22,113
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

75
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:24,809
Now, if you'll excuse me...

76
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:26,746
I will retire.

77
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:30,180
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

78
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:32,150
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

79
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:33,919
and I'll be in the control center
downstairs.

80
00:08:33,974 --> 00:08:37,102
She hardly even
recognized me, Jar Jar.

81
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:41,198
I've thought about her
every day since we parted and...

82
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:44,387
Shesa happy.

83
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:46,894
Happier den mesa seein her
in a longo time.

84
00:08:46,997 --> 00:08:50,797
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

85
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:53,569
She was pleased to see us.

86
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,638
Now, let's check the security.

87
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:06,542
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

88
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,914
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

89
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,044
My client is getting impatient.

90
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:13,987
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

91
00:09:14,091 --> 00:09:17,527
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

92
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:23,298
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

93
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,334
No assassin would try that way.

94
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:28,462
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

95
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:32,839
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

96
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,475
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

97
00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:39,239
I don't think she liked me
watching her.

98
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:41,249
What is she thinking?

99
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:44,343
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

100
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:47,082
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

101
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,524
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

102
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:07,885
You look tired.

103
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,611
I don't sleep well anymore.

104
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:13,213
Because of your mother?

105
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:21,194
I don't know
why I keep dreaming about her.

106
00:10:23,935 --> 00:10:25,869
Dreams pass in time.

107
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:32,180
It is my experience
that senators focus...

108
00:10:32,321 --> 00:10:35,188
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

109
00:10:35,925 --> 00:10:39,486
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

110
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,790
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

111
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:44,696
At least not
on the economics of politics.

112
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:05,639
Stay here!

113
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:10,582
Are you all right, milady?

114
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:46,246
What the...

115
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:56,556
Jedi poo doo!

116
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:58,721
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

117
00:13:58,826 --> 00:14:01,727
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

118
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,143
Pull up, Anakin.

119
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:39,580
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

120
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:42,952
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.

121
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:45,856
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

122
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,878
How many times
have I told you...

123
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:15,605
stay away from power couplings!

124
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,591
That was good!

125
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:37,118
Where are you going?
He went that way.

126
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,254
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

127
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:41,355
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

128
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:45,767
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

129
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:48,033
This is a shortcut.

130
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:17,226
Well, you've lost him.

131
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,968
If you'll excuse me.

132
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:24,920
I hate it when he does that.

133
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,483
Anakin!

134
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:50,322
She went into the club, Master.

135
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:53,152
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

136
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:57,293
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

137
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,090
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

138
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:01,893
Don't say that, Master.

139
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:04,058
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

140
00:19:04,168 --> 00:19:06,033
Then why don't you listen to me?

141
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:07,729
I am trying.

142
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:21,785
Can you see him?

143
00:19:21,886 --> 00:19:23,854
I think he is a she...

144
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:26,617
and I think she is a changeling.

145
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:29,853
In that case, be extra careful.

146
00:19:31,896 --> 00:19:34,364
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

147
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,932
For a drink.

148
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,341
Thank you.

149
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,538
- You wanna buy some death sticks?
- You don't want to sell me death sticks.

150
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,584
I don't want to
sell you death sticks.

151
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:56,778
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

152
00:19:56,888 --> 00:19:59,220
I want to go home
and rethink my life.

153
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:48,702
Easy.

154
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:50,933
Go back to your drinks.

155
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:59,689
Who hired you? Tell us.

156
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,921
Tell us now!

157
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,331
It was a bounty hunter called...

158
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,100
Wee shahnit... sleemo.

159
00:21:23,688 --> 00:21:25,519
Toxic dart.

160
00:21:35,933 --> 00:21:39,994
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

161
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:43,562
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

162
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:47,576
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

163
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:50,579
Handle that your Padawan will.

164
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,979
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

165
00:21:56,087 --> 00:21:59,818
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

166
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:01,915
Travel as refugees.

167
00:22:02,026 --> 00:22:04,927
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

168
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:07,395
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

169
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:11,199
Until caught this killer is...

170
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:14,362
our judgment she must respect.

171
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:16,932
Anakin, go to the senate...

172
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:20,204
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

173
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,054
I will talk with her.

174
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:34,283
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

175
00:22:34,392 --> 00:22:36,553
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

176
00:22:36,661 --> 00:22:38,720
Thank you, Your Excellency.

177
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:42,196
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

178
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:45,292
Your patience has paid off.

179
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:47,734
Your guidance
more than my patience.

180
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:51,238
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

181
00:22:52,576 --> 00:22:55,568
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

182
00:22:57,515 --> 00:22:59,608
Then you will be invincible.

183
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:04,653
I have said it many times:

184
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:07,519
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

185
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:09,525
Thank you, Your Excellency.

186
00:23:09,627 --> 00:23:13,324
I see you becoming the greatest
of all the Jedi, Anakin...

187
00:23:13,431 --> 00:23:15,956
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.

188
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:19,371
The boy has exceptional skills.

189
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:21,905
But he still has much to learn, Master.

190
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:25,443
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

191
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:27,545
Yes.

192
00:23:27,646 --> 00:23:30,581
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

193
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:35,085
Too sure of themselves they are.

194
00:23:35,187 --> 00:23:38,645
Even the older,
more experienced ones.

195
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:42,318
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true...

196
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:46,057
your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.

197
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:53,002
I'm taking
an extended leave of absence.

198
00:23:53,105 --> 00:23:56,233
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

199
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:59,643
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

200
00:23:59,888 --> 00:24:01,601
I don't wish to hold you up.

201
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:03,392
I'm sure you have
a great deal to do.

202
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,490
Of course.

203
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:07,153
Milady.

204
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,632
I do not like this idea of hiding.

205
00:24:14,404 --> 00:24:15,632
Don't worry.

206
00:24:15,738 --> 00:24:17,933
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

207
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:20,736
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

208
00:24:20,843 --> 00:24:23,744
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

209
00:24:23,846 --> 00:24:25,905
to not be here
when its fate is decided.

210
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:28,074
Sometimes we must
let go of our pride...

211
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:30,744
and do what is requested of us.

212
00:24:30,853 --> 00:24:33,287
Anakin, you've grown up.

213
00:24:35,158 --> 00:24:37,592
Master Obi-Wan manages
not to see it.

214
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:47,095
Don't get me wrong.

215
00:24:47,203 --> 00:24:49,034
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

216
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:51,663
As wise as Master Yoda and...

217
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:53,901
as powerful as Master Windu.

218
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,679
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

219
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,910
In some ways...
a lot of ways...

220
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,923
I'm really ahead of him.

221
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,523
I'm ready for the trials...

222
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:14,027
but he feels that
I'm too unpredictable.

223
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,030
He won't let me move on.

224
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:19,197
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

225
00:25:19,302 --> 00:25:22,100
He's overly critical.
He never listens.

226
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:24,571
He doesn't understand.

227
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:30,060
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

228
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,154
It's the only way we grow.

229
00:25:33,528 --> 00:25:34,961
I know.

230
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:37,922
Anakin...

231
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:42,826
don't try to grow up too fast.

232
00:25:42,937 --> 00:25:44,928
But I am grown up.

233
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:49,009
You said it yourself.

234
00:25:49,143 --> 00:25:51,236
Please don't look at me like that.

235
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:53,703
Why not?

236
00:25:53,814 --> 00:25:55,941
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

237
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:10,838
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

238
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,004
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

239
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,082
He'll be safe with me.

240
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,147
You'll be fine.

241
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:25,452
It's not me, milady.
I worry about you.

242
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:27,890
What if they realize
you've left the capital?

243
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,860
Anakin...

244
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:33,056
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

245
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:35,099
Yes, Master.

246
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:38,794
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

247
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:40,839
You'll be back here in no time.

248
00:26:41,051 --> 00:26:42,951
- It's time to go.
- I know.

249
00:26:43,053 --> 00:26:45,578
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

250
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:47,714
May the Force be with you, Master.

251
00:26:59,002 --> 00:27:00,867
Suddenly I'm afraid.

252
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:04,600
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

253
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,137
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

254
00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:15,810
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

255
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:37,509
Someone to see ya, honey!

256
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:39,852
Jedi, by the looks of him.

257
00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:42,514
Obi-Wan!

258
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:44,888
Hello, Dex.

259
00:27:44,993 --> 00:27:47,587
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

260
00:27:49,998 --> 00:27:52,967
- You wanna cup o'jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

261
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:59,800
Old buddy!

262
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:08,522
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

263
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:10,453
You can tell me what this is.

264
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:15,190
Well, whattaya know!

265
00:28:15,296 --> 00:28:17,696
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

266
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:21,028
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

267
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:23,569
Can you tell me
where it came from?

268
00:28:23,671 --> 00:28:26,640
This baby belongs to them cloners.

269
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,074
What you got here
is a Kamino saberdart.

270
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:34,147
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

271
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:37,547
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

272
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:41,553
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

273
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:43,953
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

274
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:46,390
for the difference
between knowledge and...

275
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,222
wisdom.

276
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,321
Well, if droids could think...

277
00:28:51,432 --> 00:28:53,491
there'd be none of us here,
would there?

278
00:28:54,235 --> 00:28:56,430
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

279
00:28:56,537 --> 00:28:58,505
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

280
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:04,238
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

281
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:08,873
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

282
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:14,583
These Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

283
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:17,555
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

284
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:21,820
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

285
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:24,163
Depends on what, Dex?

286
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:27,132
On how good your manners are...

287
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:31,534
and how big your... pocketbook is.

288
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:44,979
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

289
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:47,212
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

290
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:50,620
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

291
00:29:50,724 --> 00:29:52,988
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

292
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:57,393
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

293
00:29:57,498 --> 00:29:59,864
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

294
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:02,959
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

295
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,129
just south of the Rishi Maze.

296
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,412
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

297
00:30:15,516 --> 00:30:17,211
doesn't exist.

298
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:24,652
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

299
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:27,455
Use your feelings you must.

300
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:34,892
Younglings. Younglings!

301
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,436
A visitor we have.

302
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:39,186
Hello.

303
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:40,812
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

304
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:43,255
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

305
00:30:44,727 --> 00:30:47,628
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

306
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,858
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

307
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,301
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

308
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:57,372
How embarrassing!

309
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,800
Liam, the shades.

310
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:06,647
Gather round the map reader.

311
00:31:06,749 --> 00:31:08,910
Clear your minds...

312
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:12,476
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

313
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:16,852
It ought to be here...

314
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,859
but it isn't.

315
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:22,397
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

316
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:26,092
Gravity's silhouette remains...

317
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:29,170
but the star and all the planets...

318
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:31,262
disappeared they have.

319
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:34,642
Go to the center of gravity's pull...

320
00:31:34,752 --> 00:31:38,210
and find your planet you will.

321
00:31:43,628 --> 00:31:46,620
The data must have been erased.

322
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:51,631
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?

323
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:55,137
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

324
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:59,608
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

325
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:03,112
But who and why, harder to answer.

326
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:11,097
Hey, you! No droids!

327
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,370
Get outta here!

328
00:32:20,212 --> 00:32:22,077
Thank you, R2.

329
00:32:22,881 --> 00:32:25,782
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi...

330
00:32:25,884 --> 00:32:29,786
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

331
00:32:29,888 --> 00:32:32,015
Or be with the people that I love.

332
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:35,144
I thought that was forbidden
for a Jedi.

333
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:39,895
Attachment is forbidden.

334
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:43,601
Possession is forbidden.

335
00:32:43,703 --> 00:32:47,298
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

336
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:49,841
is central to a Jedi's life.

337
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,893
You've changed so much.

338
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,655
You haven't changed a bit.

339
00:32:54,864 --> 00:32:58,031
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

340
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,175
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

341
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,875
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

342
00:33:30,984 --> 00:33:32,952
I'm not sure I was ready.

343
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,577
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

344
00:33:35,989 --> 00:33:38,048
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

345
00:33:38,157 --> 00:33:40,216
so you could stay in office.

346
00:33:40,326 --> 00:33:42,817
I was relieved
when my two terms were up.

347
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:46,626
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

348
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,724
I couldn't refuse her.

349
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:52,369
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

350
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:56,601
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

351
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:07,177
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

352
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:09,151
It's unthinkable!

353
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,656
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

354
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,227
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

355
00:34:15,328 --> 00:34:17,421
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

356
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,725
Not if they feel threatened.

357
00:34:19,832 --> 00:34:23,199
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

358
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:25,270
It's outrageous...

359
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:27,669
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

360
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,574
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

361
00:34:31,678 --> 00:34:35,671
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

362
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:39,978
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

363
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:50,920
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

364
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,426
Let's pray that day never comes.

365
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:07,779
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

366
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:09,717
Our missing planet Kamino.

367
00:35:48,392 --> 00:35:50,257
Master Jedi.

368
00:35:50,895 --> 00:35:53,527
The prime minister is expecting you.

369
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:56,343
Now, please, this way.

370
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:11,619
May I present Lama Su...

371
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,755
prime minister of Kamino.

372
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:17,560
And this is Master Jedi...

373
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:19,703
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

374
00:36:19,805 --> 00:36:23,104
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

375
00:36:24,577 --> 00:36:26,545
Please.

376
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,375
And now to business.

377
00:36:30,483 --> 00:36:34,419
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

378
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:37,421
200,000 units are ready...

379
00:36:37,523 --> 00:36:39,889
with a million more
well on the way.

380
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:43,129
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

381
00:36:43,238 --> 00:36:46,705
that his order will be met on time.

382
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:55,968
Very impressive.

383
00:36:56,076 --> 00:36:58,203
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

384
00:37:01,248 --> 00:37:03,739
Clones can think creatively.

385
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:07,752
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

386
00:37:11,525 --> 00:37:16,929
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

387
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,397
This group was created
about five years ago.

388
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,559
You mentioned growth acceleration.

389
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:24,603
Oh, yes, it's essential.

390
00:37:24,705 --> 00:37:27,731
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

391
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:30,435
Now we can do it in half the time.

392
00:37:31,064 --> 00:37:33,123
We modified their genetic structure...

393
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:36,464
to make them less independent
than the original host.

394
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:39,094
And who was the original host?

395
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,298
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

396
00:37:42,909 --> 00:37:45,002
And where is this bounty hunter now?

397
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:47,238
Oh, we keep him here.

398
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:52,749
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

399
00:37:52,852 --> 00:37:55,343
Fett demanded only one thing:

400
00:37:55,455 --> 00:37:58,049
An unaltered clone for himself.

401
00:37:58,158 --> 00:37:59,792
- Curious, isn't it?

402
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:24,378
Boba, is your father here?

403
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:27,818
Dad, Taun We's here.

404
00:38:41,006 --> 00:38:43,474
Jango, welcome back.

405
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:45,743
Was your trip productive?

406
00:38:45,844 --> 00:38:47,778
Fairly.

407
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,714
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

408
00:38:51,817 --> 00:38:54,615
He's come to check on our progress.

409
00:38:54,953 --> 00:38:57,854
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

410
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:01,624
You must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

411
00:39:06,237 --> 00:39:08,262
Boba, rood eht so-heeck.

412
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:10,873
Master who?

413
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:14,936
Sifo-Dyas.

414
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:17,674
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

415
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:22,517
Never heard of him.

416
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,319
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

417
00:39:31,595 --> 00:39:33,722
Thank you for your time, Jango.

418
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:37,356
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

419
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:56,654
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

420
00:40:01,174 --> 00:40:04,695
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

421
00:40:04,855 --> 00:40:06,818
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

422
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,718
R4!

423
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:29,125
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

424
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:39,036
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.

425
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,042
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.

426
00:40:43,144 --> 00:40:45,612
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...

427
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:47,840
is the assassin we are looking for.

428
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,916
Do you think these cloners
are involved...

429
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:52,076
in the plot to assassinate
Senator Amidala?

430
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:55,087
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.

431
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:58,090
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

432
00:40:58,192 --> 00:41:01,161
Clear your mind must be...

433
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:05,459
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

434
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:07,431
Yes, Master.

435
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:10,595
They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army...

436
00:41:10,705 --> 00:41:14,300
at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.

437
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:20,045
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

438
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:23,639
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?

439
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:25,651
No. Whoever placed that order...

440
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:28,051
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

441
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:31,784
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

442
00:41:33,094 --> 00:41:35,995
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

443
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:41,259
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

444
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:43,495
we could not see.

445
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:48,541
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

446
00:41:57,613 --> 00:41:59,747
Boba, get on board!

447
00:43:15,757 --> 00:43:17,452
Oh, not good.

448
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:56,262
We used to come here
for school retreat.

449
00:44:58,005 --> 00:45:00,098
We would swim
to that island every day.

450
00:45:01,409 --> 00:45:03,377
I love the water.

451
00:45:08,149 --> 00:45:11,778
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us.

452
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:42,947
I don't know.

453
00:45:43,562 --> 00:45:45,723
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

454
00:45:45,831 --> 00:45:48,197
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

455
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,393
They only work on the weak-minded.

456
00:45:51,803 --> 00:45:53,464
All right.

457
00:45:53,572 --> 00:45:56,433
I was 12.
His name was Palo.

458
00:45:56,441 --> 00:45:58,332
We were both
in the Legislative Youth Program.

459
00:45:58,443 --> 00:46:01,503
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

460
00:46:01,613 --> 00:46:04,479
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

461
00:46:04,482 --> 00:46:06,073
All right, I get the picture.

462
00:46:06,451 --> 00:46:08,451
Whatever happened to him?

463
00:46:08,753 --> 00:46:11,483
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

464
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:13,648
Maybe he was the smart one.

465
00:46:13,758 --> 00:46:16,022
You really don't like
politicians, do you?

466
00:46:16,127 --> 00:46:18,288
I like two or three...

467
00:46:18,396 --> 00:46:20,455
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

468
00:46:24,476 --> 00:46:26,671
I don't think the system works.

469
00:46:26,778 --> 00:46:29,372
How would you have it work?

470
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:33,715
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

471
00:46:34,152 --> 00:46:36,677
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

472
00:46:36,788 --> 00:46:38,253
and then do it.

473
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:40,520
That's exactly what we do.

474
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:42,616
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

475
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:44,661
Well, then they should be made to.

476
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:47,823
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

477
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:49,958
- You?
- Of course not me.

478
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:52,970
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

479
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:55,971
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

480
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:07,653
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

481
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:09,789
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

482
00:47:09,899 --> 00:47:13,391
Well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

483
00:47:24,735 --> 00:47:27,863
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

484
00:47:57,235 --> 00:47:59,465
From the moment I met you...

485
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:02,732
all those years ago...

486
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:06,166
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

487
00:48:10,127 --> 00:48:13,619
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

488
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:28,170
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

489
00:48:30,047 --> 00:48:31,947
I can't.

490
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:36,110
We can't.
It's... just not possible.

491
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,212
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

492
00:48:39,323 --> 00:48:41,348
No, you listen.

493
00:48:41,992 --> 00:48:44,287
We live in a real world.

494
00:48:46,308 --> 00:48:49,134
I will not let you give up
your future for me.

495
00:48:49,244 --> 00:48:51,405
You are asking me to be rational.

496
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,465
I will not give in to this.

497
00:49:01,954 --> 00:49:04,184
Well, you know...

498
00:49:04,997 --> 00:49:07,630
We could keep it a secret.

499
00:49:08,585 --> 00:49:10,576
We'd be living a lie...

500
00:49:10,687 --> 00:49:12,985
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

501
00:49:14,091 --> 00:49:16,389
I couldn't do that.

502
00:49:47,815 --> 00:49:49,908
You had another nightmare last night.

503
00:49:51,118 --> 00:49:53,484
Jedi don't have nightmares.

504
00:49:54,021 --> 00:49:56,012
I heard you.

505
00:50:00,961 --> 00:50:02,952
I saw my mother.

506
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:08,025
She is suffering, Padmé.

507
00:50:10,504 --> 00:50:13,701
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

508
00:50:25,019 --> 00:50:27,544
She is in pain.

509
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,350
I have to go.

510
00:50:32,605 --> 00:50:34,630
I have to help her.

511
00:50:36,342 --> 00:50:38,242
I'll go with you.

512
00:51:02,012 --> 00:51:05,072
Dad!
I think we're being tracked!

513
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:08,618
He must have put
a homing device on our hull.

514
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:11,017
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

515
00:51:11,122 --> 00:51:13,955
and we'll have
a couple of surprises for him.

516
00:51:23,426 --> 00:51:25,394
Seismic charges!

517
00:51:25,494 --> 00:51:26,825
Stand by.

518
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:54,487
He doesn't seem
to take a hint, this guy.

519
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,345
Watch out!

520
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,582
Fire!

521
00:52:39,057 --> 00:52:41,617
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

522
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,970
We got him!

523
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:05,106
We'll just have to finish him.

524
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:34,069
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

525
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,983
Fire them now!

526
00:53:53,032 --> 00:53:55,500
We won't be seeing him again.

527
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,391
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

528
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:55,924
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

529
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:33,982
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...

530
00:56:34,093 --> 00:56:36,493
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

531
00:56:36,596 --> 00:56:39,394
What about the senator
from Naboo?

532
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:42,058
Is she dead yet?

533
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:46,728
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

534
00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:49,137
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

535
00:56:49,242 --> 00:56:52,302
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

536
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:55,575
you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy.

537
00:57:06,526 --> 00:57:08,426
As I explained to you earlier...

538
00:57:08,528 --> 00:57:11,759
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...

539
00:57:11,864 --> 00:57:14,662
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

540
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:18,536
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

541
00:57:19,136 --> 00:57:22,663
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

542
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,638
Good. Very good.

543
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:29,177
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

544
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:32,174
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

545
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,308
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

546
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:38,849
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

547
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:43,757
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

548
00:58:29,721 --> 00:58:31,154
Wait right there.

549
00:58:31,256 --> 00:58:33,247
Okey-okey.

550
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:37,388
Chut-chut, Watto.

551
00:58:39,197 --> 00:58:41,358
Let me help you with that.

552
00:58:42,467 --> 00:58:45,834
What? What do you want?

553
00:58:45,937 --> 00:58:48,405
Wait! You're a Jedi!

554
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,703
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

555
00:58:57,415 --> 00:58:59,576
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

556
00:59:02,387 --> 00:59:04,014
Ani?

557
00:59:05,924 --> 00:59:07,687
Little Ani?

558
00:59:10,629 --> 00:59:12,597
Nahhh.

559
00:59:14,399 --> 00:59:17,095
You are Ani! It is you!

560
00:59:18,503 --> 00:59:21,768
You sure sprouted, huh?

561
00:59:22,607 --> 00:59:25,132
A Jedi! Whattaya know!

562
00:59:28,413 --> 00:59:32,315
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

563
00:59:32,417 --> 00:59:33,884
My mother.

564
00:59:33,985 --> 00:59:36,476
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

565
00:59:37,956 --> 00:59:41,187
She's not mine-a no more-a.
I sold her.

566
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:43,590
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

567
00:59:43,695 --> 00:59:46,789
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

568
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:51,698
I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

569
00:59:51,803 --> 00:59:53,828
At least I think it was Lars.

570
00:59:53,938 --> 00:59:57,430
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

571
00:59:57,542 --> 00:59:59,840
Can ya beat that, eh?

572
01:00:02,347 --> 01:00:04,406
Do you know where they are now?

573
01:00:05,483 --> 01:00:07,417
Long way from here.

574
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:12,013
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

575
01:00:12,123 --> 01:00:14,114
I'd like to know.

576
01:00:15,794 --> 01:00:18,524
Sure. Absolutely!

577
01:00:19,631 --> 01:00:21,656
Let's go look at my records, huh?

578
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,257
Stay with the ship, R2.

579
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:47,775
Hello. How might I be
of service? I am C...

580
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:49,777
3PO?

581
01:00:51,647 --> 01:00:53,512
The maker!

582
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,243
Master Ani!

583
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:58,149
I knew you would return.
I knew it!

584
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:00,016
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

585
01:01:00,122 --> 01:01:01,714
Hello, 3PO.

586
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:05,726
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

587
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,796
I've come to see my mother.

588
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,657
I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.

589
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:19,131
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

590
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:21,539
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

591
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,439
Owen Lars.

592
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,742
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

593
01:01:27,237 --> 01:01:29,637
I'm your stepbrother.

594
01:01:29,739 --> 01:01:32,640
I had a feeling
you might show up someday.

595
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:35,139
Is my mother here?

596
01:01:35,245 --> 01:01:36,974
No, she's not.

597
01:01:37,981 --> 01:01:39,710
Cliegg Lars.

598
01:01:39,816 --> 01:01:41,807
Shmi is my wife.

599
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:45,946
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

600
01:01:53,563 --> 01:01:56,657
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

601
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:59,668
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

602
01:02:00,671 --> 01:02:03,572
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

603
01:02:03,674 --> 01:02:07,041
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

604
01:02:07,744 --> 01:02:11,305
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...

605
01:02:11,415 --> 01:02:13,315
when they took her.

606
01:02:14,918 --> 01:02:16,977
Those Tuskens walk like men...

607
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:21,683
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

608
01:02:23,527 --> 01:02:26,553
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

609
01:02:27,531 --> 01:02:31,661
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...

610
01:02:31,768 --> 01:02:37,400
I just couldn't ride anymore
until I heal.

611
01:02:38,275 --> 01:02:40,243
I don't want to give up on her...

612
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:43,211
but she's been gone a month.

613
01:02:43,313 --> 01:02:46,339
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

614
01:02:50,921 --> 01:02:52,889
Where are you going?

615
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:55,415
To find my mother.

616
01:02:56,627 --> 01:02:59,494
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.

617
01:03:21,652 --> 01:03:24,644
You're gonna have to stay here.

618
01:03:24,755 --> 01:03:27,417
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

619
01:03:28,094 --> 01:03:29,394
Anakin.

620
01:03:39,914 --> 01:03:41,882
I won't be long.

621
01:05:15,591 --> 01:05:17,582
Mom?

622
01:05:20,028 --> 01:05:21,996
Ani?

623
01:05:23,232 --> 01:05:25,029
Ani?

624
01:05:26,268 --> 01:05:27,929
Is it you?

625
01:05:28,036 --> 01:05:31,597
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

626
01:05:33,008 --> 01:05:34,721
Ani.

627
01:05:35,452 --> 01:05:39,621
You look so handsome.
My son.

628
01:06:12,456 --> 01:06:14,481
Anakin!

629
01:06:14,926 --> 01:06:16,593
No!

630
01:06:30,819 --> 01:06:32,446
What is it?

631
01:06:32,909 --> 01:06:36,367
Pain, suffering...

632
01:06:36,946 --> 01:06:38,937
death I feel.

633
01:06:43,486 --> 01:06:46,614
Something terrible has happened.

634
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:52,318
Young Skywalker is in pain...

635
01:06:52,428 --> 01:06:54,293
terrible pain.

636
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,708
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.

637
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:42,023
But I couldn't...

638
01:07:43,344 --> 01:07:45,437
Why couldn't I save her?

639
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,605
I know I could have!

640
01:07:50,451 --> 01:07:52,976
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

641
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,809
What's wrong, Ani?

642
01:08:08,563 --> 01:08:10,531
I killed them.

643
01:08:12,267 --> 01:08:14,235
I killed them all.

644
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,970
They're dead.

645
01:08:18,072 --> 01:08:20,165
Every single one of them.

646
01:09:01,462 --> 01:09:03,327
I wasn't strong enough.

647
01:09:07,365 --> 01:09:10,832
But I promise I won't fail again.

648
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,739
I miss you.

649
01:09:27,493 --> 01:09:31,122
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

650
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:33,960
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

651
01:09:35,534 --> 01:09:37,525
We'll have to try something else.

652
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:43,237
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo.

653
01:09:43,575 --> 01:09:45,236
It's much closer.

654
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:49,377
Anakin, do you copy?

655
01:09:49,515 --> 01:09:52,484
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

656
01:09:52,584 --> 01:09:54,916
He's not on Naboo, R4.

657
01:09:56,455 --> 01:09:58,650
I'm going to try and widen the range.

658
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,028
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

659
01:10:11,537 --> 01:10:13,402
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...

660
01:10:13,539 --> 01:10:16,007
but it's coming from Tatooine.

661
01:10:22,278 --> 01:10:24,212
Retransmit this message...

662
01:10:26,281 --> 01:10:28,943
Anakin, do you copy?

663
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:31,416
My long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

664
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:33,851
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

665
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:37,127
R2?
What are you doing here?

666
01:10:39,637 --> 01:10:43,869
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

667
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:48,003
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

668
01:10:50,147 --> 01:10:52,615
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

669
01:10:52,717 --> 01:10:54,947
Retransmit this message
to Coruscant.

670
01:10:59,457 --> 01:11:01,687
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...

671
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:03,953
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.

672
01:11:04,061 --> 01:11:07,690
The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here...

673
01:11:07,798 --> 01:11:09,789
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...

674
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:13,392
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.

675
01:11:13,504 --> 01:11:15,665
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...

676
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:19,436
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming...

677
01:11:19,577 --> 01:11:21,602
Wait.

678
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:37,086
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

679
01:11:37,194 --> 01:11:38,957
I agree.

680
01:11:39,364 --> 01:11:42,062
Anakin.
We will deal with Count Dooku.

681
01:11:42,767 --> 01:11:46,328
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.

682
01:11:46,437 --> 01:11:49,167
Protect the senator at all costs.

683
01:11:49,273 --> 01:11:51,798
That is your first priority.

684
01:11:53,244 --> 01:11:55,212
Understood, Master.

685
01:11:55,312 --> 01:11:57,246
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

686
01:11:57,348 --> 01:12:00,579
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

687
01:12:02,787 --> 01:12:04,880
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

688
01:12:04,989 --> 01:12:06,957
If he's still alive.

689
01:12:08,345 --> 01:12:12,042
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

690
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:15,381
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...

691
01:12:15,487 --> 01:12:17,682
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

692
01:12:19,057 --> 01:12:22,618
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

693
01:12:24,605 --> 01:12:27,768
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

694
01:12:38,052 --> 01:12:41,021
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.

695
01:12:41,121 --> 01:12:43,089
Count Dooku must have made
a treaty with them.

696
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:46,591
The debate is over.

697
01:12:46,693 --> 01:12:49,685
Now we need that clone army.

698
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:52,732
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.

699
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:55,267
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

700
01:12:55,369 --> 01:12:57,132
before the separatists attack.

701
01:12:57,237 --> 01:12:59,137
This is a crisis.

702
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:02,367
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

703
01:13:02,476 --> 01:13:05,536
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

704
01:13:05,879 --> 01:13:08,074
But what senator would have
the courage...

705
01:13:08,182 --> 01:13:10,742
to propose such a radical amendment?

706
01:13:10,851 --> 01:13:14,947
If only Senator Amidala were here.

707
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:27,121
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact...

708
01:13:27,223 --> 01:13:29,885
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

709
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:34,293
Senators, "dellow felagates":

710
01:13:34,397 --> 01:13:38,424
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

711
01:13:38,535 --> 01:13:42,232
mesa propose that the senate...

712
01:13:42,372 --> 01:13:45,967
give immediately emergency powers...

713
01:13:46,075 --> 01:13:48,703
to the supreme chancellor.

714
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:53,809
Palpatine! Palpatine!

715
01:13:58,021 --> 01:14:01,252
Order! We shall have order!

716
01:14:02,959 --> 01:14:06,292
It is with great reluctance...

717
01:14:06,396 --> 01:14:08,489
that I have agreed to this calling.

718
01:14:09,866 --> 01:14:13,825
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.

719
01:14:14,671 --> 01:14:16,866
The power you give me...

720
01:14:16,973 --> 01:14:21,501
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

721
01:14:25,982 --> 01:14:30,817
And as my first act
with this new authority...

722
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:35,323
I will create
a grand army of the Republic...

723
01:14:35,425 --> 01:14:39,191
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

724
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:42,428
It is done, then.

725
01:14:47,737 --> 01:14:51,400
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

726
01:14:51,508 --> 01:14:55,410
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

727
01:14:56,446 --> 01:15:00,343
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

728
01:15:19,117 --> 01:15:20,948
Traitor.

729
01:15:21,453 --> 01:15:24,616
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

730
01:15:24,723 --> 01:15:26,782
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

731
01:15:26,892 --> 01:15:29,520
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.

732
01:15:29,628 --> 01:15:32,222
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

733
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:35,766
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

734
01:15:35,867 --> 01:15:39,530
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

735
01:15:39,638 --> 01:15:43,438
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

736
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:45,975
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

737
01:15:46,077 --> 01:15:48,978
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

738
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,741
Do you know him?

739
01:15:50,849 --> 01:15:53,647
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

740
01:15:53,752 --> 01:15:55,720
The Geonosians don't trust them.

741
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,687
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

742
01:15:59,824 --> 01:16:03,988
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

743
01:16:04,663 --> 01:16:07,131
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.

744
01:16:12,003 --> 01:16:14,028
I wish he were still alive.

745
01:16:15,507 --> 01:16:18,203
I could use his help right now.

746
01:16:19,077 --> 01:16:21,545
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

747
01:16:23,348 --> 01:16:26,249
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

748
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:28,911
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...

749
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:31,045
just as you were once his.

750
01:16:32,023 --> 01:16:34,218
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

751
01:16:34,326 --> 01:16:37,352
but he wouldn't have gone along with it
if he had learned the truth as I have.

752
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:40,226
- The truth?
- The truth.

753
01:16:46,638 --> 01:16:49,937
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

754
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:52,134
of the dark lord of the Sith?

755
01:16:52,243 --> 01:16:55,076
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

756
01:16:55,213 --> 01:16:59,445
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

757
01:17:00,585 --> 01:17:03,145
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

758
01:17:03,254 --> 01:17:07,850
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

759
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,552
I don't believe you.

760
01:17:10,662 --> 01:17:13,028
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

761
01:17:13,131 --> 01:17:16,362
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...

762
01:17:17,235 --> 01:17:21,069
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

763
01:17:21,172 --> 01:17:24,266
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

764
01:17:26,311 --> 01:17:28,370
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

765
01:17:29,581 --> 01:17:33,540
and together we will destroy the Sith!

766
01:17:35,286 --> 01:17:37,584
I will never join you, Dooku.

767
01:17:47,098 --> 01:17:49,999
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

768
01:18:05,294 --> 01:18:07,319
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?

769
01:18:07,463 --> 01:18:09,488
They're exhaust vents of some type.

770
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:21,560
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

771
01:18:21,661 --> 01:18:23,754
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

772
01:18:23,864 --> 01:18:25,525
As a member of the senate...

773
01:18:25,632 --> 01:18:28,326
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

774
01:18:53,475 --> 01:18:56,706
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

775
01:18:56,811 --> 01:18:58,711
they would have asked for it.

776
01:18:58,813 --> 01:19:01,941
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behavior.

777
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,443
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

778
01:19:09,552 --> 01:19:12,112
I am programmed
to understand humans!

779
01:19:15,725 --> 01:19:17,625
"What does that mean?"

780
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:20,457
That means I am in charge here!

781
01:19:20,563 --> 01:19:22,190
Where are you going now?

782
01:19:22,298 --> 01:19:25,790
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

783
01:19:26,169 --> 01:19:27,864
Idiot!

784
01:19:30,073 --> 01:19:31,802
Please wait.

785
01:19:32,609 --> 01:19:34,543
Do you know where you're going?

786
01:21:00,182 --> 01:21:01,911
Oh, my goodness!

787
01:21:02,857 --> 01:21:04,848
Machines making machines.

788
01:21:04,959 --> 01:21:06,426
How perverse!

789
01:21:07,361 --> 01:21:08,794
Calm down, R2!

790
01:21:08,896 --> 01:21:11,387
I almost fell.

791
01:21:11,499 --> 01:21:13,467
You'll get your chance...

792
01:21:15,922 --> 01:21:17,822
What did I do to deserve this?

793
01:21:56,906 --> 01:21:59,101
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

794
01:21:59,209 --> 01:22:01,609
He's always getting himself
into trouble.

795
01:22:02,979 --> 01:22:04,571
Oh, no!

796
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:15,617
Uh-oh.

797
01:24:26,145 --> 01:24:27,578
Don't move, Jedi!

798
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:29,170
Take him away.

799
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,031
Don't be afraid.

800
01:24:51,804 --> 01:24:53,795
I'm not afraid to die.

801
01:24:57,737 --> 01:24:59,796
I love you.

802
01:25:08,711 --> 01:25:12,076
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love.

803
01:25:14,382 --> 01:25:16,942
Before we die,
I want you to know.

804
01:26:13,969 --> 01:26:16,497
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

805
01:26:16,606 --> 01:26:19,666
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

806
01:26:21,596 --> 01:26:23,461
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

807
01:26:37,052 --> 01:26:40,078
Settle down. Settle down.

808
01:26:44,091 --> 01:26:47,822
Let the executions begin.

809
01:27:20,661 --> 01:27:23,596
I've got a bad feeling about this.

810
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:51,658
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

811
01:27:51,759 --> 01:27:53,886
She seems to be on top of things.

812
01:28:53,376 --> 01:28:55,105
She can't do that!

813
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:04,588
Jump!

814
01:30:26,343 --> 01:30:29,404
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

815
01:30:29,413 --> 01:30:31,640
Jango! Finish her off!

816
01:30:31,748 --> 01:30:34,979
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

817
01:31:02,804 --> 01:31:04,271
Master Windu.

818
01:31:04,373 --> 01:31:06,705
How pleasant of you to join us.

819
01:31:06,808 --> 01:31:08,833
This party's over.

820
01:31:22,839 --> 01:31:25,103
Brave...

821
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:27,574
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

822
01:31:27,677 --> 01:31:29,542
You're impossibly outnumbered.

823
01:31:29,646 --> 01:31:31,978
I don't think so.

824
01:31:32,082 --> 01:31:33,515
We'll see.

825
01:32:09,821 --> 01:32:12,415
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

826
01:32:48,017 --> 01:32:50,485
What's all this noise?
A battle!

827
01:32:50,587 --> 01:32:52,782
There's been some terrible mistake!

828
01:32:52,889 --> 01:32:55,619
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

829
01:34:13,837 --> 01:34:17,136
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

830
01:34:21,663 --> 01:34:24,564
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.

831
01:34:38,513 --> 01:34:42,840
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

832
01:35:06,422 --> 01:35:08,686
R2, what are you doing here?

833
01:35:11,694 --> 01:35:13,025
What are you doing?

834
01:35:13,162 --> 01:35:15,590
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.

835
01:35:15,699 --> 01:35:17,462
My neck!

836
01:35:19,396 --> 01:35:21,322
Now where are you taking me?

837
01:35:25,807 --> 01:35:27,832
I'm quite beside myself.

838
01:35:36,351 --> 01:35:39,582
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

839
01:35:41,022 --> 01:35:43,547
Yes, but is my head on straight?

840
01:36:06,114 --> 01:36:07,741
Master Windu...

841
01:36:08,074 --> 01:36:10,065
Surrender...

842
01:36:10,176 --> 01:36:12,872
and your lives will be spared.

843
01:36:13,746 --> 01:36:16,874
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

844
01:36:16,983 --> 01:36:18,007
Then...

845
01:36:19,485 --> 01:36:21,544
I'm sorry, old friend.

846
01:36:32,853 --> 01:36:34,286
Look!

847
01:37:39,267 --> 01:37:42,293
I've had the most peculiar dream!

848
01:37:52,914 --> 01:37:54,905
If Dooku escapes...

849
01:37:55,016 --> 01:37:58,713
rally more systems
to his cause he will.

850
01:38:03,833 --> 01:38:05,664
Hold on!

851
01:38:29,306 --> 01:38:31,638
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

852
01:38:31,741 --> 01:38:33,800
That doesn't seem possible.

853
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:36,606
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

854
01:38:36,713 --> 01:38:40,149
We must send
all available droids into battle.

855
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:42,150
There are too many.

856
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:45,883
Our communications have been jammed.

857
01:38:53,831 --> 01:38:56,132
Land in that assembly area!

858
01:38:56,234 --> 01:38:57,565
Yes, sir.

859
01:39:03,747 --> 01:39:04,809
Sir...

860
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:07,578
I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

861
01:39:08,046 --> 01:39:11,345
To the forward command center
take me.

862
01:39:34,412 --> 01:39:37,142
Attack those Federation starships,
quickly!

863
01:39:47,925 --> 01:39:51,725
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

864
01:39:51,829 --> 01:39:53,694
Very good.

865
01:39:54,332 --> 01:39:55,959
Very good.

866
01:40:24,162 --> 01:40:26,355
This is not looking good at all!

867
01:40:29,531 --> 01:40:33,467
We have to order a retreat.

868
01:40:33,567 --> 01:40:35,933
My master will never allow
the Republic...

869
01:40:36,036 --> 01:40:38,368
to get away with this treachery.

870
01:40:38,506 --> 01:40:41,737
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

871
01:40:41,842 --> 01:40:45,869
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

872
01:40:48,315 --> 01:40:53,617
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

873
01:40:56,857 --> 01:40:59,291
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

874
01:41:00,227 --> 01:41:02,957
They will be much safer there
with my master.

875
01:41:57,485 --> 01:42:02,286
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

876
01:42:02,389 --> 01:42:04,220
Yes, sir.

877
01:42:04,325 --> 01:42:07,783
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

878
01:42:47,935 --> 01:42:49,402
Look over there!

879
01:42:52,873 --> 01:42:55,273
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

880
01:42:55,376 --> 01:42:57,276
We're out of rockets, sir.

881
01:42:57,378 --> 01:43:00,245
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

882
01:43:00,347 --> 01:43:04,408
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

883
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:30,469
Put the ship down!

884
01:43:30,578 --> 01:43:32,478
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

885
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:34,343
Follow that speeder!

886
01:43:40,421 --> 01:43:42,787
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

887
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:46,382
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

888
01:43:46,493 --> 01:43:49,485
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

889
01:43:49,597 --> 01:43:51,895
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

890
01:43:51,999 --> 01:43:55,230
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

891
01:43:55,336 --> 01:43:58,164
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

892
01:44:08,557 --> 01:44:10,616
The droid army is in full retreat.

893
01:44:10,726 --> 01:44:13,820
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

894
01:44:40,823 --> 01:44:43,951
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

895
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:45,755
We'll take him together.

896
01:44:45,861 --> 01:44:47,829
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

897
01:44:54,743 --> 01:44:58,235
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

898
01:44:58,347 --> 01:45:00,281
Now... back down.

899
01:45:06,121 --> 01:45:07,952
I don't think so.

900
01:45:20,774 --> 01:45:24,005
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

901
01:45:24,111 --> 01:45:27,171
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

902
01:45:29,550 --> 01:45:31,984
Surely you can do better.

903
01:45:58,601 --> 01:46:00,466
Brave of you, boy.

904
01:46:01,539 --> 01:46:03,769
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

905
01:46:03,875 --> 01:46:05,467
I am a slow learner.

906
01:47:02,826 --> 01:47:04,589
Master Yoda.

907
01:47:04,695 --> 01:47:07,755
Count Dooku.

908
01:47:07,865 --> 01:47:11,232
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

909
01:47:41,342 --> 01:47:44,277
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

910
01:47:44,779 --> 01:47:47,873
The dark side I sense in you.

911
01:47:47,982 --> 01:47:50,780
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

912
01:47:52,864 --> 01:47:54,491
Even you.

913
01:48:08,938 --> 01:48:11,998
Much to learn you still have.

914
01:48:51,277 --> 01:48:55,043
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

915
01:48:55,147 --> 01:48:56,910
This is just the beginning.

916
01:51:18,117 --> 01:51:20,585
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

917
01:51:20,687 --> 01:51:23,656
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

918
01:51:25,525 --> 01:51:27,857
You have done well.

919
01:51:27,961 --> 01:51:30,327
I have good news for you, my lord.

920
01:51:31,832 --> 01:51:34,858
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

921
01:51:35,469 --> 01:51:38,165
Everything is going as planned.

922
01:51:48,148 --> 01:51:52,107
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

923
01:51:52,652 --> 01:51:54,643
It doesn't feel right.

924
01:51:54,988 --> 01:51:57,957
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

925
01:51:59,259 --> 01:52:00,988
Lies, deceit...

926
01:52:01,094 --> 01:52:04,894
creating mistrust are his ways now.

927
01:52:04,998 --> 01:52:06,431
Nevertheless...

928
01:52:06,533 --> 01:52:09,559
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

929
01:52:09,669 --> 01:52:11,694
I agree.

930
01:52:12,839 --> 01:52:14,704
Where is your apprentice?

931
01:52:14,808 --> 01:52:18,710
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

932
01:52:20,514 --> 01:52:24,143
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

933
01:52:24,251 --> 01:52:26,310
Victory?

934
01:52:27,187 --> 01:52:29,587
Victory, you say?

935
01:52:29,689 --> 01:52:33,386
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

936
01:52:34,928 --> 01:52:38,159
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

937
01:52:39,499 --> 01:52:43,333
Begun the Clone War has.
