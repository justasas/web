1
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:20,387
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:22,636
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,186
We made it.

4
00:03:19,614 --> 00:03:21,357
I guess I was wrong.

5
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,697
There was no danger at all.

6
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:44,178
Cordé.

7
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:48,469
Milady, I'm so sorry.

8
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:51,470
I've failed you, Senator.

9
00:03:51,604 --> 00:03:52,719
No.

10
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,391
Milady, you're still in danger here.

11
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:08,118
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

12
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:12,073
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

13
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,036
Senator Amidala, please.

14
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,725
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

15
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,354
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

16
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,272
If they do break away-

17
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,649
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

18
00:04:39,777 --> 00:04:41,817
be split in two.

19
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,900
My negotiations will not fail.

20
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,567
If they do, you must realize...

21
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:49,778
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

22
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:53,410
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

23
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:56,584
Master Yoda...

24
00:04:57,545 --> 00:05:00,215
do you think it will
really come to war?

25
00:05:01,716 --> 00:05:06,010
The dark side clouds everything.

26
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:11,095
Impossible to see the future is.

27
00:05:12,936 --> 00:05:16,139
<i>The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honour.</i>

28
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:17,268
Good.

29
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:21,940
Send them in.

30
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,905
We will discuss this matter later.

31
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:32,986
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform-

32
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:34,996
terrible.

33
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,868
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

34
00:05:39,003 --> 00:05:41,708
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

35
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,418
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

36
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:49,385
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

37
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:53,381
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

38
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:56,472
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

39
00:05:56,604 --> 00:06:00,056
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

40
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,729
But for certain, Senator...

41
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,692
in grave danger you are.

42
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:10,736
Master Jedi, may I suggest...

43
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:14,949
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

44
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:18,117
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

45
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:20,327
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe-

46
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:22,787
The situation is that serious?

47
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:25,338
No, but I do, Senator.

48
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:28,800
I realize all too well
that additional security...

49
00:06:28,928 --> 00:06:32,380
might be disruptive for you...

50
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:35,184
<i>but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.</i>

51
00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:39,302
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

52
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:41,684
That's possible.

53
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:44,568
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

54
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:47,860
Do it for me, milady. Please?

55
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:50,361
The thought of losing you...

56
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:54,158
is unbearable.

57
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,204
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

58
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:00,574
Thank you, Master Windu.

59
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:13,467
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

60
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,216
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

61
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:19,934
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

62
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,470
and I rescued you, remember?

63
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:24,975
Oh... yes.

64
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:34,493
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

65
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:37,695
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

66
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:55,091
Obi? Obi!

67
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:58,888
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again,Jar Jar.

68
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:00,975
Senator Padmé.

69
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:04,686
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

70
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:07,520
Desa Jedi arriven.

71
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:14,110
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

72
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:16,697
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

73
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,490
Ani?

74
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:22,908
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

75
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:25,414
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

76
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:28,214
Well, for a senator, I mean.

77
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,711
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

78
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:38,756
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

79
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:41,299
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

80
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:43,475
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

81
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:45,727
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

82
00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:48,608
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

83
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:51,404
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

84
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,735
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

85
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:57,649
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

86
00:08:57,785 --> 00:09:00,157
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

87
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:02,115
I promise you.

88
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:04,953
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

89
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:08,002
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

90
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:10,620
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

91
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:12,666
and you will pay attention
to my lead.

92
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,876
- Why?
- What?

93
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:20,463
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

94
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,850
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

95
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:26,813
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

96
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:30,189
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

97
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:35,696
<i>And you will learn
your place, young one.</i>

98
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:41,194
Perhaps with merely your presence...

99
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:44,246
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

100
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,947
Now, if you'll excuse me...

101
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,918
I will retire.

102
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:52,336
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

103
00:09:52,465 --> 00:09:54,588
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

104
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:56,876
and I'll be in the control centre
downstairs.

105
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:01,513
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

106
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:04,760
She hardly even
recognized me,Jar Jar.

107
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:09,313
I've thought about her
every day since we parted and...

108
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:12,649
she's forgotten me completely.

109
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:14,401
Shesa happy.

110
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,901
Happier den mesa seein her
in a longo time.

111
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:20,815
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

112
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,568
She was pleased to see us.

113
00:10:23,704 --> 00:10:25,662
Now, let's check the security.

114
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:36,755
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

115
00:10:36,884 --> 00:10:39,126
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

116
00:10:39,262 --> 00:10:41,254
My client is getting impatient.

117
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:44,224
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

118
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,766
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

119
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:53,515
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

120
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:55,560
No assassin would try that way.

121
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:58,691
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

122
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:03,076
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

123
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:06,703
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

124
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:09,449
I don't think she liked me
watching her.

125
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:11,457
What is she thinking?

126
00:11:11,586 --> 00:11:14,586
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

127
00:11:14,714 --> 00:11:17,287
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

128
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:21,754
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

129
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,966
You're using her as bait.

130
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,140
It was her idea.

131
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:30,807
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

132
00:11:30,938 --> 00:11:33,892
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

133
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,266
Trust me.

134
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:38,276
It's too risky.

135
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,983
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

136
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:44,401
And yours are?

137
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:48,494
Possibly.

138
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:04,802
You look tired.

139
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:07,513
I don't sleep well any more.

140
00:12:07,642 --> 00:12:10,133
Because of your mother?

141
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:18,103
I don't know
why I keep dreaming about her.

142
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,772
Dreams pass in time.

143
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:26,905
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

144
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:31,199
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.

145
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:33,787
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

146
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:36,207
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order...

147
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:38,376
a commitment not easily broken.

148
00:12:38,506 --> 00:12:41,257
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

149
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:43,957
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

150
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:46,218
It is my experience
that senators focus...

151
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:49,217
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

152
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:53,510
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

153
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:55,804
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

154
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,727
At least not
on the economics of politics.

155
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:57,078
And besides, you're generalizing.

156
00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:59,249
The chancellor doesn't appear
to be corrupt.

157
00:13:59,378 --> 00:14:01,003
Palpatine is a politician.

158
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,751
I have observed
that he is very clever...

159
00:14:03,883 --> 00:14:07,832
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

160
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,844
I think he's a good man-

161
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:11,846
I sense it too.

162
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:31,035
Stay here!

163
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:35,363
Are you all right, milady?

164
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:11,022
What the-

165
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,327
<i>Jedi poo doo!</i>

166
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:25,430
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

167
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:28,436
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

168
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:31,938
with the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

169
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:34,860
If you spent as long practising your
sabre techniques as you do your wit...

170
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:36,700
<i>you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman.</i>

171
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:38,487
I thought I already did.

172
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:41,325
Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

173
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:12,226
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

174
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,493
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

175
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:24,825
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.

176
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,746
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

177
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:59,027
Anakin! How many times
have I told you...

178
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:02,367
stay away from power couplings!

179
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,368
That was good!

180
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:23,422
Where are you going?
He went that way.

181
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,551
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

182
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:27,679
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

183
00:18:27,813 --> 00:18:32,060
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

184
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:34,862
This is a short cut... I think.

185
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:04,508
Well, you've lost him.

186
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:07,098
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

187
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:09,101
That was some short cut, Anakin.

188
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:11,637
He went completely the other way.

189
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:13,813
- Once again you've proved-
- If you'll excuse me.

190
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:18,935
I hate it when he does that.

191
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:49,715
Anakin!

192
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:52,635
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

193
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,267
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.

194
00:21:56,396 --> 00:21:59,148
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.

195
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:02,061
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

196
00:22:02,194 --> 00:22:06,108
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

197
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,909
<i>Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?</i>

198
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:10,694
Don't say that, Master.

199
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:12,867
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

200
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:14,823
Then why don't you listen to me?

201
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:16,534
I am trying.

202
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:30,588
Can you see him?

203
00:22:30,722 --> 00:22:32,632
I think he is a she...

204
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:35,435
and I think she is a changeling.

205
00:22:36,061 --> 00:22:38,682
In that case, be extra careful.

206
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:43,140
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

207
00:22:43,277 --> 00:22:44,735
For a drink.

208
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,157
Thank you.

209
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:01,332
- You wanna buy some death sticks?
- You don't want to sell me death sticks.

210
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:03,371
I don't want to
sell you death sticks.

211
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:05,581
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

212
00:23:05,716 --> 00:23:08,041
I want to go home
and rethink my life.

213
00:23:56,224 --> 00:23:57,505
Easy.

214
00:23:57,643 --> 00:23:59,765
Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

215
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:09,023
<i>Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?</i>

216
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:11,488
It was a senator from Naboo.

217
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:14,236
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

218
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:17,610
Who hired you? Tell us.

219
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:21,115
Tell us now!

220
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:23,910
It was a bounty hunter called-

221
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:33,676
<i>Wee shahnit... sleemo.</i>

222
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:45,098
Toxic dart.

223
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:59,578
<i>Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.</i>

224
00:24:59,705 --> 00:25:03,120
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

225
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,117
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

226
00:25:07,254 --> 00:25:10,171
Handle that your Padawan will.

227
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:15,543
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

228
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,379
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

229
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:21,473
Travel as refugees.

230
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:24,472
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

231
00:25:24,604 --> 00:25:26,977
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

232
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:30,776
Until caught this killer is...

233
00:25:30,902 --> 00:25:33,939
our judgement she must respect.

234
00:25:34,406 --> 00:25:36,482
Anakin, go to the senate...

235
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:39,783
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

236
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:50,621
I will talk with her.

237
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:53,840
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

238
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:56,125
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

239
00:25:56,261 --> 00:25:58,301
Thank you, Your Excellency.

240
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,763
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

241
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:04,892
Your patience has paid off.

242
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,309
Your guidance
more than my patience.

243
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:10,807
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

244
00:26:12,152 --> 00:26:15,153
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

245
00:26:17,115 --> 00:26:19,191
Then you will be invincible.

246
00:26:22,329 --> 00:26:24,202
I have said it many times:

247
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:27,082
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

248
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:29,082
Thank you, Your Excellency.

249
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:32,876
I see you becoming the greatest
of all the Jedi, Anakin...

250
00:26:33,006 --> 00:26:35,544
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.

251
00:26:40,722 --> 00:26:42,715
I am concerned for my Padawan.

252
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:45,554
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

253
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:48,889
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

254
00:26:49,022 --> 00:26:50,979
The boy has exceptional skills.

255
00:26:51,107 --> 00:26:53,515
But he still has much to learn, Master.

256
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:57,068
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

257
00:26:57,197 --> 00:26:59,154
Yes.

258
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:02,200
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

259
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:06,701
Too sure of themselves they are.

260
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:10,247
Even the older,
more experienced ones.

261
00:27:10,377 --> 00:27:13,912
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true...

262
00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:17,665
<i>your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.</i>

263
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:24,592
I'm taking
an extended leave of absence.

264
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:27,844
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

265
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:30,848
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

266
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:35,477
Mesa honoured to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

267
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:40,107
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and-

268
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,778
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.

269
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:44,866
I'm sure you have
a great deal to do.

270
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,786
Of course.

271
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,658
Milady.

272
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:55,127
I do not like this idea of hiding.

273
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:57,287
Don't worry.

274
00:27:57,424 --> 00:27:59,630
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

275
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,429
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

276
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:05,424
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

277
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:07,596
to not be here
when its fate is decided.

278
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:09,765
Sometimes we must
let go of our pride...

279
00:28:09,895 --> 00:28:12,432
and do what is requested of us.

280
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:14,971
Anakin, you've grown up.

281
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,267
Master Obi-Wan manages
not to see it.

282
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:27,738
Don't get me wrong.

283
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:30,706
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

284
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:33,323
As wise as Master Yoda and...

285
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,583
as powerful as Master Windu.

286
00:28:37,964 --> 00:28:40,372
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

287
00:28:42,552 --> 00:28:45,589
In some ways-
a lot of ways-

288
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:49,598
I'm really ahead of him.

289
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:52,178
I'm ready for the trials...

290
00:28:52,312 --> 00:28:55,681
but he feels that
I'm too unpredictable.

291
00:28:55,815 --> 00:28:57,725
He won't let me move on.

292
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,852
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

293
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:03,774
He's overly critical.
He never listens.

294
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:06,232
He doesn't understand.

295
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:08,444
It's not fair!

296
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:13,370
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

297
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,492
It's the only way we grow.

298
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:19,040
I know.

299
00:29:20,006 --> 00:29:21,999
Anakin...

300
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:26,877
don't try to grow up too fast.

301
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:28,922
But I am grown up.

302
00:29:31,142 --> 00:29:33,100
You said it yourself.

303
00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:36,305
Please don't look at me like that.

304
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:38,774
Why not?

305
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,023
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

306
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:44,986
Sorry, milady.

307
00:30:00,296 --> 00:30:03,048
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

308
00:30:03,174 --> 00:30:06,211
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

309
00:30:06,344 --> 00:30:08,301
He'll be safe with me.

310
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:14,350
You'll be fine.

311
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:17,644
It's not me, milady.
I worry about you.

312
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:20,098
<i>What if they realize
you've left the capital?</i>

313
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:24,561
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

314
00:30:24,696 --> 00:30:26,570
Anakin...

315
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:29,782
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

316
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:31,819
Yes, Master.

317
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:35,487
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

318
00:30:35,623 --> 00:30:37,533
You'll be back here in no time.

319
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:40,870
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.

320
00:30:41,004 --> 00:30:42,878
- It's time to go.
- I know.

321
00:30:43,006 --> 00:30:45,497
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

322
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:47,673
May the Force be with you, Master.

323
00:30:59,147 --> 00:31:01,021
Suddenly I'm afraid.

324
00:31:01,149 --> 00:31:04,732
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

325
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:09,278
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

326
00:31:14,662 --> 00:31:17,200
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

327
00:31:17,957 --> 00:31:21,409
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

328
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:44,933
Someone to see ya, honey!

329
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:47,275
Jedi, by the looks of him.

330
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:49,940
Obi-Wan!

331
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:52,313
Hello, Dex.

332
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,024
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

333
00:31:57,455 --> 00:32:00,409
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

334
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:07,246
Old buddy!

335
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:19,559
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

336
00:32:19,686 --> 00:32:21,513
You can tell me what this is.

337
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:26,226
Well, whattaya know!

338
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:28,731
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

339
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:32,065
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

340
00:32:32,198 --> 00:32:34,606
Can you tell me
where it came from?

341
00:32:34,742 --> 00:32:37,696
This baby belongs to them cloners.

342
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:42,123
What you got here
is a Kamino sabredart.

343
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,204
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

344
00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:48,586
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

345
00:32:48,715 --> 00:32:52,629
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

346
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,002
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

347
00:32:55,138 --> 00:32:57,463
for the difference
between knowledge and...

348
00:32:58,641 --> 00:33:00,266
wisdom.

349
00:33:00,393 --> 00:33:02,386
Well, if droids could think...

350
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,560
there'd be none of us here,
would there?

351
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:07,473
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

352
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:09,566
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

353
00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:15,281
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

354
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:19,951
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

355
00:33:20,914 --> 00:33:25,622
These Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

356
00:33:25,752 --> 00:33:28,622
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

357
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:32,882
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

358
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:35,210
Depends on what, Dex?

359
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:38,180
On how good your manners are...

360
00:33:38,306 --> 00:33:42,600
and how big your... pocketbook is.

361
00:33:53,446 --> 00:33:56,019
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

362
00:33:56,157 --> 00:33:58,280
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

363
00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:01,659
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

364
00:34:01,788 --> 00:34:04,030
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

365
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:08,459
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

366
00:34:08,586 --> 00:34:10,911
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

367
00:34:11,047 --> 00:34:14,001
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

368
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:16,209
just south of the Rishi Maze.

369
00:34:23,142 --> 00:34:26,476
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

370
00:34:26,604 --> 00:34:28,478
doesn't exist.

371
00:34:28,606 --> 00:34:31,856
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

372
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:35,021
If an item does not appear
in our records...

373
00:34:35,154 --> 00:34:37,230
it does not exist.

374
00:34:59,012 --> 00:35:01,253
Hey, you! No droids!

375
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,513
Get outta here!

376
00:35:10,356 --> 00:35:12,230
Thank you, R2.

377
00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:15,896
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi...

378
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:19,896
<i>not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.</i>

379
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:22,156
Or be with the people that I love.

380
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,112
Are you allowed to love?

381
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:27,073
I thought that was forbidden
for a Jedi.

382
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:32,915
Attachment is forbidden.

383
00:35:34,714 --> 00:35:36,588
Possession is forbidden.

384
00:35:36,716 --> 00:35:40,299
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

385
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:42,836
is central to a Jedi's life.

386
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:49,679
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

387
00:35:49,812 --> 00:35:51,722
You've changed so much.

388
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:54,394
You haven't changed a bit.

389
00:35:54,525 --> 00:35:57,360
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

390
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:13,741
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

391
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:16,547
Use your feelings you must.

392
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:23,969
Younglings. Younglings!

393
00:36:24,097 --> 00:36:26,504
A visitor we have.

394
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:29,511
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

395
00:36:29,644 --> 00:36:31,055
Hello.

396
00:36:31,187 --> 00:36:32,681
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

397
00:36:32,814 --> 00:36:35,139
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

398
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:39,480
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

399
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:42,732
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

400
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:47,160
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

401
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:49,244
How embarrassing!

402
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:54,701
Liam, the shades.

403
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:58,494
Gather round the map reader.

404
00:36:58,631 --> 00:37:00,789
Clear your minds...

405
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:04,376
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

406
00:37:05,596 --> 00:37:08,716
It ought to be here...

407
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,723
but it isn't.

408
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:14,268
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

409
00:37:15,898 --> 00:37:17,974
Gravity's silhouette remains...

410
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:21,026
but the star and all the planets...

411
00:37:21,154 --> 00:37:23,146
disappeared they have.

412
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:25,404
How can this be?

413
00:37:26,617 --> 00:37:28,242
A thought?

414
00:37:29,162 --> 00:37:31,035
Anyone.

415
00:37:31,497 --> 00:37:32,908
Master?

416
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,911
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

417
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:43,122
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

418
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:48,260
The Padawan is right.

419
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:51,425
Go to the centre of gravity's pull...

420
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:55,010
and find your planet you will.

421
00:38:00,443 --> 00:38:03,444
The data must have been erased.

422
00:38:03,863 --> 00:38:08,608
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?

423
00:38:08,743 --> 00:38:12,112
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

424
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:16,576
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

425
00:38:16,709 --> 00:38:20,125
But who and why, harder to answer.

426
00:38:21,214 --> 00:38:24,049
Meditate on this I will.

427
00:38:48,908 --> 00:38:51,197
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

428
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:54,910
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

429
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,948
I'm not sure I was ready.

430
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:59,621
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

431
00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:02,084
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

432
00:39:02,213 --> 00:39:04,252
so you could stay in office.

433
00:39:04,382 --> 00:39:06,837
I was relieved
when my two terms were up.

434
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:10,633
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

435
00:39:10,763 --> 00:39:12,756
I couldn't refuse her.

436
00:39:13,057 --> 00:39:16,391
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

437
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,644
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

438
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:31,190
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

439
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:33,152
It's unthinkable!

440
00:39:33,286 --> 00:39:36,655
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

441
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:39,245
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

442
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,451
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

443
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:43,744
Not if they feel threatened.

444
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,213
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

445
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:49,298
It's outrageous...

446
00:39:49,427 --> 00:39:51,669
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

447
00:39:51,804 --> 00:39:55,588
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

448
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:59,722
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

449
00:40:01,856 --> 00:40:04,014
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

450
00:40:10,906 --> 00:40:14,951
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

451
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:17,747
Let's pray that day never comes.

452
00:40:17,872 --> 00:40:20,541
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

453
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,617
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

454
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:27,086
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.

455
00:40:27,214 --> 00:40:29,041
- But I was thinking-
- Hold on a minute.

456
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:30,420
Excuse me.

457
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:32,959
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

458
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:35,302
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

459
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:38,467
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

460
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:42,222
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

461
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:44,312
I think it would be wise...

462
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,812
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

463
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:50,103
Sorry, milady.

464
00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:55,447
Perfect. It's settled, then.

465
00:41:09,423 --> 00:41:12,128
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

466
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:14,086
Our missing planet Kamino.

467
00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:54,131
Master Jedi.

468
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:57,586
The prime minister is expecting you.

469
00:41:58,848 --> 00:42:01,220
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

470
00:42:02,143 --> 00:42:04,384
He is anxious to meet you.

471
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,678
After all these years...

472
00:42:06,814 --> 00:42:10,397
<i>we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.</i>

473
00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:12,732
Now, please, this way.

474
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:27,997
May I present Lama Su...

475
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:30,166
prime minister of Kamino.

476
00:42:31,922 --> 00:42:33,962
And this is Master Jedi-

477
00:42:34,216 --> 00:42:36,090
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

478
00:42:36,218 --> 00:42:39,504
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

479
00:42:40,973 --> 00:42:42,930
Please.

480
00:42:44,602 --> 00:42:46,760
And now to business.

481
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:50,810
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

482
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:53,816
200,000 units are ready...

483
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:56,270
with a million more
well on the way.

484
00:42:57,448 --> 00:42:59,357
That's good news.

485
00:42:59,492 --> 00:43:02,611
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

486
00:43:02,745 --> 00:43:06,078
that his order will be met on time.

487
00:43:06,207 --> 00:43:08,164
I'm sorry. Master-

488
00:43:09,335 --> 00:43:11,873
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

489
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:15,124
a leading member of the Jedi Council,
is he not?

490
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:19,041
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

491
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:23,005
I'm so sorry to hear that.

492
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,387
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

493
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,845
The army?

494
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,599
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

495
00:43:33,734 --> 00:43:35,940
one of the finest we've ever created.

496
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:38,027
Tell me, Prime Minister...

497
00:43:38,155 --> 00:43:40,611
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

498
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:42,864
did he say who it was for?

499
00:43:42,993 --> 00:43:44,986
Of course he did.

500
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,790
This army is for the Republic.

501
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:52,248
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

502
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:55,877
That's why I'm here.

503
00:44:16,735 --> 00:44:18,858
We used to come here
for school retreat.

504
00:44:20,614 --> 00:44:22,690
We would swim
to that island every day.

505
00:44:24,034 --> 00:44:25,992
I love the water.

506
00:44:30,749 --> 00:44:34,368
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

507
00:44:34,879 --> 00:44:37,833
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

508
00:44:40,718 --> 00:44:42,710
I don't like sand.

509
00:44:43,512 --> 00:44:47,177
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

510
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,557
and it gets everywhere.

511
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,810
Not like here.

512
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,397
Here, everything is soft...

513
00:44:58,569 --> 00:45:00,727
and smooth.

514
00:45:37,316 --> 00:45:38,976
No.

515
00:45:39,652 --> 00:45:41,691
I shouldn't have done that.

516
00:45:43,447 --> 00:45:45,404
I'm sorry.

517
00:45:59,004 --> 00:46:00,629
Very impressive.

518
00:46:00,756 --> 00:46:02,879
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

519
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:08,502
Clones can think creatively.

520
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,506
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

521
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:21,682
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programmes.

522
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:25,152
This group was created
about five years ago.

523
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,320
You mentioned growth acceleration.

524
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:29,359
Oh, yes, it's essential.

525
00:46:29,493 --> 00:46:32,494
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

526
00:46:32,621 --> 00:46:35,195
Now we can do it in half the time.

527
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:37,954
I see.

528
00:46:38,085 --> 00:46:39,959
They are totally obedient...

529
00:46:40,087 --> 00:46:42,756
taking any order without question.

530
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:44,921
We modified their genetic structure...

531
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,253
to make them less independent
than the original host.

532
00:46:48,387 --> 00:46:50,925
And who was the original host?

533
00:46:51,056 --> 00:46:53,132
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

534
00:46:54,727 --> 00:46:56,803
And where is this bounty hunter now?

535
00:46:56,937 --> 00:46:59,060
Oh, we keep him here.

536
00:47:01,734 --> 00:47:04,569
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

537
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:07,150
Fett demanded only one thing:

538
00:47:07,281 --> 00:47:09,854
an unaltered clone for himself.

539
00:47:09,992 --> 00:47:12,399
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

540
00:47:12,536 --> 00:47:15,027
Pure genetic replication.

541
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:18,283
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

542
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:20,955
and no growth acceleration.

543
00:47:21,086 --> 00:47:24,336
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

544
00:47:24,465 --> 00:47:27,715
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

545
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:48,106
Magnificent, aren't they?

546
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:56,071
I don't know.

547
00:47:57,289 --> 00:47:59,447
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

548
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:01,908
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

549
00:48:02,044 --> 00:48:04,120
They only work on the weak-minded.

550
00:48:05,547 --> 00:48:07,172
All right.

551
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:09,457
I was 12.
His name was Palo.

552
00:48:09,593 --> 00:48:12,049
We were both
in the Legislative Youth Programme.

553
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:15,215
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

554
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:17,674
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

555
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,802
All right, I get the picture.

556
00:48:20,187 --> 00:48:22,061
Whatever happened to him?

557
00:48:22,189 --> 00:48:24,894
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

558
00:48:25,025 --> 00:48:27,065
Maybe he was the smart one.

559
00:48:27,194 --> 00:48:29,436
You really don't like
politicians, do you?

560
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:31,694
I like two or three...

561
00:48:31,824 --> 00:48:33,900
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

562
00:48:37,913 --> 00:48:39,989
I don't think the system works.

563
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:42,788
How would you have it work?

564
00:48:43,335 --> 00:48:47,119
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

565
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:50,080
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

566
00:48:50,217 --> 00:48:52,044
and then do it.

567
00:48:52,177 --> 00:48:53,921
That's exactly what we do.

568
00:48:54,054 --> 00:48:56,047
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

569
00:48:56,181 --> 00:48:58,055
Well, then they should be made to.

570
00:48:58,183 --> 00:49:01,220
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

571
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:03,393
- You?
- Of course not me.

572
00:49:03,522 --> 00:49:06,476
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

573
00:49:06,608 --> 00:49:10,392
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

574
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:14,147
Well, if it works.

575
00:49:21,248 --> 00:49:23,039
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

576
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:25,704
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

577
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:07,282
Ani, are you all right?

578
00:50:43,622 --> 00:50:46,658
Boba, is your father here?

579
00:50:47,709 --> 00:50:48,705
Yep.

580
00:50:48,835 --> 00:50:50,875
May we see him?

581
00:50:51,797 --> 00:50:53,789
Sure.

582
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:57,548
Dad, Taun We's here.

583
00:51:10,732 --> 00:51:13,188
Jango, welcome back.

584
00:51:13,527 --> 00:51:15,436
Was your trip productive?

585
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,480
Fairly.

586
00:51:17,614 --> 00:51:21,398
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

587
00:51:21,535 --> 00:51:24,322
He's come to check on our progress.

588
00:51:24,663 --> 00:51:27,533
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

589
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:30,667
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

590
00:51:30,794 --> 00:51:34,459
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

591
00:51:35,424 --> 00:51:37,463
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

592
00:51:39,636 --> 00:51:41,296
Possibly.

593
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,506
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

594
00:51:48,145 --> 00:51:50,137
<i>Boba, rood eht so-heeck.</i>

595
00:51:51,356 --> 00:51:52,767
Master who?

596
00:51:55,235 --> 00:51:56,813
Sifo-Dyas.

597
00:51:56,945 --> 00:51:59,567
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

598
00:52:02,534 --> 00:52:04,408
Never heard of him.

599
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,154
Really?

600
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:13,705
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

601
00:52:13,837 --> 00:52:15,248
Curious.

602
00:52:19,301 --> 00:52:21,507
Do you like your army?

603
00:52:22,346 --> 00:52:24,303
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

604
00:52:25,724 --> 00:52:28,927
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

605
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:31,184
Thank you for your time,Jango.

606
00:52:32,981 --> 00:52:35,057
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

607
00:52:54,461 --> 00:52:56,703
What is it, Dad?

608
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,082
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

609
00:53:05,013 --> 00:53:09,307
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

610
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:11,474
"Aggressive negotiations"?
What's that?

611
00:53:11,895 --> 00:53:15,062
Well, negotiations with a lightsabre.

612
00:53:28,078 --> 00:53:31,198
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

613
00:54:00,569 --> 00:54:02,775
From the moment I met you...

614
00:54:03,905 --> 00:54:06,064
all those years ago...

615
00:54:06,491 --> 00:54:09,492
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

616
00:54:12,247 --> 00:54:14,619
And now that I'm with you again...

617
00:54:15,292 --> 00:54:17,368
I'm in agony.

618
00:54:20,797 --> 00:54:24,629
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

619
00:54:24,759 --> 00:54:27,167
The thought of not being with you-

620
00:54:28,054 --> 00:54:29,964
I can't breathe.

621
00:54:33,852 --> 00:54:35,761
I'm haunted by the kiss...

622
00:54:35,896 --> 00:54:38,850
that you should never have given me.

623
00:54:39,316 --> 00:54:41,604
My heart is beating...

624
00:54:41,735 --> 00:54:44,652
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

625
00:54:46,865 --> 00:54:49,735
You are in my very soul...

626
00:54:49,868 --> 00:54:51,907
tormenting me.

627
00:54:54,372 --> 00:54:57,872
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

628
00:55:08,845 --> 00:55:12,428
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

629
00:55:14,309 --> 00:55:16,183
I can't.

630
00:55:17,312 --> 00:55:20,348
We can't.
It's... just not possible.

631
00:55:20,482 --> 00:55:23,436
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

632
00:55:23,568 --> 00:55:25,608
No, you listen.

633
00:55:26,238 --> 00:55:29,820
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

634
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:33,615
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

635
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:37,994
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

636
00:55:38,124 --> 00:55:40,580
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...

637
00:55:41,878 --> 00:55:44,085
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

638
00:55:44,214 --> 00:55:46,206
Then you do feel something.

639
00:55:46,341 --> 00:55:49,342
<i>I will not let you give up
your future for me.</i>

640
00:55:49,469 --> 00:55:51,628
You are asking me to be rational.

641
00:55:52,764 --> 00:55:55,006
That is something
I know I cannot do.

642
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:59,768
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...

643
00:55:59,896 --> 00:56:01,889
but I can't.

644
00:56:02,857 --> 00:56:05,562
I will not give in to this.

645
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:14,907
Well, you know...

646
00:56:15,036 --> 00:56:17,823
it wouldn't have to be that way.

647
00:56:17,956 --> 00:56:20,791
We could keep it a secret.

648
00:56:22,252 --> 00:56:24,209
We'd be living a lie...

649
00:56:24,337 --> 00:56:26,626
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

650
00:56:27,757 --> 00:56:29,999
I couldn't do that.

651
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:33,005
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

652
00:56:34,973 --> 00:56:37,974
No. You're right.

653
00:56:39,477 --> 00:56:41,435
It would destroy us.

654
00:56:48,945 --> 00:56:52,813
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

655
00:56:53,241 --> 00:56:56,325
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

656
00:56:56,453 --> 00:56:59,572
it will take more time to grow them.

657
00:56:59,706 --> 00:57:01,449
I won't forget, and thank you.

658
00:57:01,583 --> 00:57:03,410
Thank you.

659
00:57:19,809 --> 00:57:21,802
R4!

660
00:57:21,936 --> 00:57:25,222
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

661
00:57:31,821 --> 00:57:35,107
<i>I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.</i>

662
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:39,109
<i>They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.</i>

663
00:57:39,245 --> 00:57:41,701
<i>I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...</i>

664
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:43,907
<i>is the assassin we are looking for.</i>

665
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:45,999
Do you think these cloners
are involved...

666
00:57:46,127 --> 00:57:48,167
in the plot to assassinate
Senator Amidala?

667
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:51,167
<i>No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.</i>

668
00:57:51,299 --> 00:57:54,170
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

669
00:57:54,302 --> 00:57:57,256
Clear your mind must be...

670
00:57:57,389 --> 00:58:01,552
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

671
00:58:01,685 --> 00:58:03,511
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

672
00:58:03,645 --> 00:58:06,681
<i>They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army...</i>

673
00:58:06,815 --> 00:58:10,397
<i>at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.</i>

674
00:58:13,279 --> 00:58:16,115
<i>I was under the impression
he was killed before that.</i>

675
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:19,740
<i>Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?</i>

676
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:21,743
No. Whoever placed that order...

677
00:58:21,871 --> 00:58:24,113
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

678
00:58:24,249 --> 00:58:27,867
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

679
00:58:29,212 --> 00:58:32,083
<i>Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.</i>

680
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,335
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

681
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:39,593
we could not see.

682
00:58:42,976 --> 00:58:45,134
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

683
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:47,309
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

684
00:58:48,189 --> 00:58:52,519
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

685
00:58:52,652 --> 00:58:54,894
If informed the senate is...

686
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,485
multiply our adversaries will.

687
00:58:59,117 --> 00:59:00,741
No.

688
00:59:04,205 --> 00:59:06,162
Mom, no.

689
00:59:34,778 --> 00:59:36,984
Don't go.

690
00:59:39,032 --> 00:59:40,989
I don't want to disturb you.

691
00:59:42,327 --> 00:59:44,284
Your presence is soothing.

692
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:49,283
You had another nightmare last night.

693
00:59:50,502 --> 00:59:52,874
Jedi don't have nightmares.

694
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:55,414
I heard you.

695
01:00:00,345 --> 01:00:02,337
I saw my mother.

696
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:07,426
She is suffering, Padmé.

697
01:00:09,896 --> 01:00:13,099
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

698
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,948
She is in pain.

699
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:31,408
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

700
01:00:31,543 --> 01:00:33,535
but I have to go.

701
01:00:36,506 --> 01:00:38,498
I have to help her.

702
01:00:40,218 --> 01:00:42,127
I'll go with you.

703
01:00:42,262 --> 01:00:44,503
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

704
01:00:55,608 --> 01:00:57,482
Dad, look!

705
01:00:58,111 --> 01:01:00,518
Boba, get on board!

706
01:02:16,814 --> 01:02:18,522
Oh, not good.

707
01:04:28,112 --> 01:04:29,523
Wait right there.

708
01:04:29,655 --> 01:04:31,648
Okey-okey.

709
01:04:34,035 --> 01:04:35,695
<i>Chut-chut, Watto.</i>

710
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:39,947
Let me help you with that.

711
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:44,411
What? What do you want?

712
01:04:44,545 --> 01:04:47,001
Wait! You're a Jedi!

713
01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:50,298
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

714
01:04:56,015 --> 01:04:58,174
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

715
01:05:00,978 --> 01:05:02,603
Ani?

716
01:05:04,524 --> 01:05:06,267
Little Ani?

717
01:05:09,237 --> 01:05:11,194
Nahhh.

718
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,695
You are Ani! It is you!

719
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,370
You sure sprouted, huh?

720
01:05:21,207 --> 01:05:23,745
AJedi! Whattaya know!

721
01:05:27,004 --> 01:05:30,872
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

722
01:05:31,008 --> 01:05:32,467
My mother.

723
01:05:32,593 --> 01:05:35,084
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

724
01:05:36,556 --> 01:05:39,759
She's not mine-a no more-a.
I sold her.

725
01:05:39,892 --> 01:05:42,181
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

726
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:45,396
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

727
01:05:46,524 --> 01:05:50,272
I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

728
01:05:50,403 --> 01:05:52,395
At least I think it was Lars.

729
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:56,029
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

730
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:58,447
Can ya beat that, eh?

731
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:02,995
Do you know where they are now?

732
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:05,992
Long way from here.

733
01:06:06,127 --> 01:06:10,588
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

734
01:06:10,715 --> 01:06:12,707
I'd like to know.

735
01:06:14,385 --> 01:06:17,137
Sure. Absolutely!

736
01:06:18,222 --> 01:06:20,262
Let's go look at my records, huh?

737
01:06:48,669 --> 01:06:51,706
Dad!
I think we're being tracked!

738
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:55,255
He must have put
a homing device on our hull.

739
01:06:55,384 --> 01:06:57,626
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

740
01:06:57,762 --> 01:07:00,597
and we'll have
a couple of surprises for him.

741
01:07:11,609 --> 01:07:13,566
Seismic charges!

742
01:07:13,694 --> 01:07:15,023
Stand by.

743
01:07:40,346 --> 01:07:43,015
He doesn't seem
to take a hint, this guy.

744
01:08:01,492 --> 01:08:02,867
Watch out!

745
01:08:22,638 --> 01:08:25,343
Get him, Dad! Fire!

746
01:08:27,268 --> 01:08:29,806
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

747
01:08:49,874 --> 01:08:51,368
We got him!

748
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,493
We'll just have to finish him.

749
01:09:19,445 --> 01:09:22,980
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

750
01:09:26,994 --> 01:09:29,746
Fire them now!

751
01:09:41,926 --> 01:09:44,381
We won't be seeing him again.

752
01:10:18,254 --> 01:10:20,923
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

753
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:45,436
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

754
01:11:21,609 --> 01:11:23,518
Stay with the ship, R2.

755
01:11:38,167 --> 01:11:42,034
Hello. How might I be
of service? I am C-

756
01:11:42,171 --> 01:11:44,045
3PO?

757
01:11:45,925 --> 01:11:47,751
The maker!

758
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:49,509
Master Ani!

759
01:11:49,637 --> 01:11:52,424
I knew you would return.
I knew it!

760
01:11:52,556 --> 01:11:54,264
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

761
01:11:54,391 --> 01:11:55,969
Hello, 3PO.

762
01:11:56,101 --> 01:11:59,969
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

763
01:12:00,105 --> 01:12:02,063
I've come to see my mother.

764
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:05,940
I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.

765
01:12:08,906 --> 01:12:13,402
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

766
01:12:13,536 --> 01:12:15,824
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

767
01:12:17,081 --> 01:12:18,705
Owen Lars.

768
01:12:18,832 --> 01:12:20,991
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

769
01:12:21,126 --> 01:12:23,119
I'm Padmé.

770
01:12:23,504 --> 01:12:25,876
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

771
01:12:26,006 --> 01:12:28,877
<i>I had a feeling
you might show up someday.</i>

772
01:12:29,677 --> 01:12:31,385
Is my mother here?

773
01:12:31,512 --> 01:12:33,220
No, she's not.

774
01:12:34,431 --> 01:12:36,139
Cliegg Lars.

775
01:12:36,267 --> 01:12:38,259
Shmi is my wife.

776
01:12:39,395 --> 01:12:42,396
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

777
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:53,115
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

778
01:12:53,242 --> 01:12:56,112
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

779
01:12:57,121 --> 01:12:59,991
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

780
01:13:00,124 --> 01:13:03,493
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

781
01:13:04,211 --> 01:13:07,746
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...

782
01:13:07,881 --> 01:13:09,755
when they took her.

783
01:13:11,385 --> 01:13:13,425
Those Tuskens walk like men...

784
01:13:13,554 --> 01:13:18,132
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

785
01:13:19,977 --> 01:13:23,013
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

786
01:13:23,981 --> 01:13:28,109
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...

787
01:13:28,235 --> 01:13:33,858
I just couldn't ride any more
until I heal.

788
01:13:34,742 --> 01:13:36,699
I don't want to give up on her...

789
01:13:36,827 --> 01:13:39,662
but she's been gone a month.

790
01:13:39,788 --> 01:13:42,789
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

791
01:13:47,588 --> 01:13:49,545
Where are you going?

792
01:13:50,049 --> 01:13:52,088
To find my mother.

793
01:13:53,302 --> 01:13:56,137
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.

794
01:14:18,327 --> 01:14:21,281
You're gonna have to stay here.

795
01:14:21,413 --> 01:14:24,083
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

796
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,677
I won't be long.

797
01:16:27,664 --> 01:16:29,657
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...

798
01:16:29,792 --> 01:16:32,164
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

799
01:16:32,294 --> 01:16:35,081
What about the senator
from Naboo?

800
01:16:35,714 --> 01:16:37,754
Is she dead yet?

801
01:16:38,467 --> 01:16:42,381
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

802
01:16:42,513 --> 01:16:44,801
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

803
01:16:44,932 --> 01:16:47,968
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

804
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:51,268
<i>you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy.</i>

805
01:17:02,199 --> 01:17:04,073
As I explained to you earlier...

806
01:17:04,201 --> 01:17:07,404
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...

807
01:17:07,538 --> 01:17:10,325
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

808
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:14,209
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

809
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:16,878
The Techno Union army...

810
01:17:20,133 --> 01:17:22,885
is at your disposal, Count.

811
01:17:23,762 --> 01:17:27,261
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

812
01:17:27,391 --> 01:17:29,264
Good. Very good.

813
01:17:30,394 --> 01:17:33,810
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

814
01:17:34,189 --> 01:17:36,645
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

815
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,937
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

816
01:17:40,779 --> 01:17:43,484
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

817
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:48,359
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

818
01:18:49,222 --> 01:18:51,215
Mom?

819
01:18:53,644 --> 01:18:55,601
Ani?

820
01:18:56,855 --> 01:18:58,646
Ani?

821
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,524
Is it you?

822
01:19:01,652 --> 01:19:05,234
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

823
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,574
You look so handsome.

824
01:19:18,001 --> 01:19:20,077
My son.

825
01:19:20,212 --> 01:19:22,963
My grown-up son.

826
01:19:24,508 --> 01:19:26,750
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

827
01:19:26,885 --> 01:19:28,794
I missed you.

828
01:19:31,556 --> 01:19:33,632
Now I am complete.

829
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:42,690
I love y-

830
01:19:43,902 --> 01:19:47,022
Stay with me, Mom. Everything-

831
01:19:47,155 --> 01:19:49,195
I love-

832
01:19:50,742 --> 01:19:53,198
I love-

833
01:20:50,302 --> 01:20:52,341
<i>Anakin!</i>

834
01:20:52,888 --> 01:20:54,346
<i>No!</i>

835
01:21:14,743 --> 01:21:16,367
What is it?

836
01:21:17,454 --> 01:21:20,905
Pain, suffering...

837
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,492
death I feel.

838
01:21:28,048 --> 01:21:31,168
Something terrible has happened.

839
01:21:33,845 --> 01:21:36,846
Young Skywalker is in pain...

840
01:21:36,973 --> 01:21:38,847
terrible pain.

841
01:21:43,647 --> 01:21:47,265
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

842
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,105
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

843
01:21:51,696 --> 01:21:53,689
We'll have to try something else.

844
01:21:56,618 --> 01:21:59,405
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo.

845
01:21:59,746 --> 01:22:01,406
It's much closer.

846
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:05,533
Anakin, do you copy?

847
01:22:05,669 --> 01:22:08,623
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

848
01:22:08,755 --> 01:22:11,080
He's not on Naboo, R4.

849
01:22:12,634 --> 01:22:14,792
I'm going to try and widen the range.

850
01:22:18,223 --> 01:22:20,180
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

851
01:22:27,691 --> 01:22:29,564
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...

852
01:22:29,693 --> 01:22:32,148
but it's coming from Tatooine.

853
01:22:33,738 --> 01:22:36,312
What in the blazes is he doing there?

854
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:38,407
I told him to stay on Naboo.

855
01:22:41,079 --> 01:22:43,570
We haven't got much time.

856
01:22:43,707 --> 01:22:45,746
Anakin, do you copy?

857
01:22:45,876 --> 01:22:47,915
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

858
01:22:55,844 --> 01:22:57,753
<i>Retransmit this message-</i>

859
01:22:59,848 --> 01:23:02,469
<i>Anakin, do you copy?</i>

860
01:23:02,601 --> 01:23:04,926
<i>My long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.</i>

861
01:23:05,061 --> 01:23:07,387
<i>Retransmit this message to Coruscant.</i>

862
01:23:51,942 --> 01:23:53,934
I brought you something.

863
01:23:54,069 --> 01:23:56,192
Are you hungry?

864
01:23:57,948 --> 01:23:59,905
The shifter broke.

865
01:24:01,785 --> 01:24:04,572
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

866
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,539
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.

867
01:24:12,879 --> 01:24:14,836
But I couldn't-

868
01:24:18,843 --> 01:24:20,753
Why'd she have to die?

869
01:24:24,266 --> 01:24:26,342
Why couldn't I save her?

870
01:24:26,476 --> 01:24:28,516
I know I could have!

871
01:24:31,356 --> 01:24:33,894
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

872
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:38,238
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

873
01:24:40,991 --> 01:24:42,983
Someday I will be.

874
01:24:43,326 --> 01:24:45,948
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

875
01:24:47,664 --> 01:24:49,703
I promise you.

876
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:52,784
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.

877
01:24:56,590 --> 01:25:00,539
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!

878
01:25:00,677 --> 01:25:02,716
He's holding me back!

879
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,140
What's wrong, Ani?

880
01:25:19,904 --> 01:25:21,862
I killed them.

881
01:25:23,617 --> 01:25:25,574
I killed them all.

882
01:25:27,412 --> 01:25:29,286
They're dead.

883
01:25:29,414 --> 01:25:31,490
Every single one of them.

884
01:25:33,668 --> 01:25:35,625
And not just the men...

885
01:25:37,672 --> 01:25:39,581
but the women...

886
01:25:39,716 --> 01:25:41,625
and the children too.

887
01:25:42,594 --> 01:25:44,633
They're like animals...

888
01:25:44,763 --> 01:25:47,088
and I slaughtered them like animals!

889
01:25:48,725 --> 01:25:50,718
I hate them!

890
01:26:08,578 --> 01:26:10,535
To be angry is to be human.

891
01:26:10,663 --> 01:26:12,537
I'm a Jedi.

892
01:26:13,667 --> 01:26:15,540
I know I'm better than this.

893
01:26:29,557 --> 01:26:34,054
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

894
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:39,307
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

895
01:26:42,278 --> 01:26:44,318
Goodbye, my darling wife.

896
01:26:48,326 --> 01:26:50,235
And thank you.

897
01:27:17,564 --> 01:27:19,805
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

898
01:27:22,318 --> 01:27:24,192
I wasn't strong enough.

899
01:27:28,783 --> 01:27:32,117
But I promise I won't fail again.

900
01:27:43,089 --> 01:27:45,129
I miss you...

901
01:27:46,509 --> 01:27:48,418
so much.

902
01:27:55,393 --> 01:27:58,062
R2? What are you doing here?

903
01:28:00,982 --> 01:28:05,194
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

904
01:28:06,196 --> 01:28:09,315
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

905
01:28:11,493 --> 01:28:13,900
<i>Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.</i>

906
01:28:14,037 --> 01:28:16,279
<i>Retransmit this message
to Coruscant.</i>

907
01:28:20,793 --> 01:28:23,000
<i>I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...</i>

908
01:28:23,129 --> 01:28:25,252
<i>to the droid foundries on Geonosis.</i>

909
01:28:25,381 --> 01:28:29,000
<i>The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here...</i>

910
01:28:29,135 --> 01:28:31,128
<i>and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...</i>

911
01:28:31,262 --> 01:28:34,714
<i>is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.</i>

912
01:28:34,849 --> 01:28:36,972
<i>The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...</i>

913
01:28:37,101 --> 01:28:40,767
<i>have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming-</i>

914
01:28:40,897 --> 01:28:42,936
<i>Wait.</i>

915
01:28:53,785 --> 01:28:58,411
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

916
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:00,283
I agree.

917
01:29:01,709 --> 01:29:03,951
<i>We will deal with Count Dooku.</i>

918
01:29:04,087 --> 01:29:07,622
<i>The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.</i>

919
01:29:07,757 --> 01:29:10,462
<i>Protect the senator at all costs.</i>

920
01:29:10,593 --> 01:29:13,131
<i>That is your first priority.</i>

921
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,596
Understood, Master.

922
01:29:16,724 --> 01:29:18,717
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

923
01:29:18,851 --> 01:29:21,888
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

924
01:29:24,107 --> 01:29:26,183
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

925
01:29:26,317 --> 01:29:28,274
If he's still alive.

926
01:29:30,196 --> 01:29:32,818
Are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?

927
01:29:32,949 --> 01:29:35,440
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

928
01:29:36,661 --> 01:29:40,326
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

929
01:29:40,456 --> 01:29:43,660
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...

930
01:29:43,793 --> 01:29:45,999
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

931
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:50,915
<i>If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.</i>

932
01:29:54,971 --> 01:29:58,138
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

933
01:30:08,443 --> 01:30:11,360
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.

934
01:30:11,487 --> 01:30:13,445
Count Dooku must have made
a treaty with them.

935
01:30:13,573 --> 01:30:16,942
The debate is over.

936
01:30:17,076 --> 01:30:20,030
Now we need that clone army.

937
01:30:20,163 --> 01:30:23,080
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.

938
01:30:23,207 --> 01:30:25,615
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

939
01:30:25,752 --> 01:30:27,495
before the separatists attack.

940
01:30:27,629 --> 01:30:29,502
This is a crisis.

941
01:30:29,631 --> 01:30:32,715
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

942
01:30:32,842 --> 01:30:35,926
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

943
01:30:36,262 --> 01:30:38,421
But what senator would have
the courage...

944
01:30:38,556 --> 01:30:41,094
to propose such a radical amendment?

945
01:30:41,225 --> 01:30:45,306
If only Senator Amidala were here.

946
01:31:06,709 --> 01:31:08,536
Traitor.

947
01:31:09,045 --> 01:31:12,212
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

948
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:14,379
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

949
01:31:14,509 --> 01:31:17,082
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.

950
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:19,793
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

951
01:31:19,931 --> 01:31:23,347
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

952
01:31:23,476 --> 01:31:27,094
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

953
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:31,014
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

954
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:33,558
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

955
01:31:33,695 --> 01:31:36,565
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

956
01:31:36,698 --> 01:31:38,571
Do you know him?

957
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:41,237
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

958
01:31:41,369 --> 01:31:43,278
The Geonosians don't trust them.

959
01:31:43,413 --> 01:31:46,283
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

960
01:31:47,417 --> 01:31:51,580
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

961
01:31:52,255 --> 01:31:54,710
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.

962
01:31:59,595 --> 01:32:01,635
I wish he were still alive.

963
01:32:03,099 --> 01:32:05,804
I could use his help right now.

964
01:32:06,936 --> 01:32:09,142
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

965
01:32:11,024 --> 01:32:13,811
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

966
01:32:13,943 --> 01:32:16,481
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...

967
01:32:16,612 --> 01:32:18,652
just as you were once his.

968
01:32:19,615 --> 01:32:21,822
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

969
01:32:21,951 --> 01:32:24,952
but he wouldn't have gone along with
it if he had learned the truth as I have.

970
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:27,831
- The truth?
- The truth.

971
01:32:34,255 --> 01:32:37,541
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

972
01:32:37,675 --> 01:32:39,715
of the dark lord of the Sith?

973
01:32:39,844 --> 01:32:42,679
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

974
01:32:42,805 --> 01:32:47,052
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

975
01:32:48,186 --> 01:32:50,724
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

976
01:32:50,855 --> 01:32:55,433
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

977
01:32:56,569 --> 01:32:58,147
I don't believe you.

978
01:32:58,279 --> 01:33:00,604
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

979
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:03,943
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...

980
01:33:04,827 --> 01:33:08,659
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

981
01:33:08,790 --> 01:33:11,874
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

982
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:15,959
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

983
01:33:17,173 --> 01:33:21,123
and together we will destroy the Sith!

984
01:33:22,887 --> 01:33:25,176
I will never join you, Dooku.

985
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:37,608
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

986
01:33:45,451 --> 01:33:48,322
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact...

987
01:33:48,454 --> 01:33:51,076
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

988
01:33:51,207 --> 01:33:55,501
Senators, "dellow felagates":

989
01:33:55,628 --> 01:33:59,626
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

990
01:33:59,757 --> 01:34:03,422
mesa propose that the senate...

991
01:34:03,553 --> 01:34:07,171
give immediately emergency powers...

992
01:34:07,306 --> 01:34:09,928
to the supreme chancellor.

993
01:34:14,021 --> 01:34:16,144
Palpatine! Palpatine!

994
01:34:19,235 --> 01:34:22,485
Order! We shall have order!

995
01:34:24,198 --> 01:34:27,484
It is with great reluctance...

996
01:34:27,618 --> 01:34:29,694
that I have agreed to this calling.

997
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:35,030
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.

998
01:34:35,918 --> 01:34:38,077
The power you give me...

999
01:34:38,212 --> 01:34:42,708
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

1000
01:34:47,221 --> 01:34:52,013
And as my first act
with this new authority...

1001
01:34:52,143 --> 01:34:56,520
I will create
a grand army of the Republic...

1002
01:34:56,647 --> 01:35:00,396
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1003
01:35:01,777 --> 01:35:03,651
It is done, then.

1004
01:35:08,951 --> 01:35:12,616
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1005
01:35:12,747 --> 01:35:16,614
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1006
01:35:17,668 --> 01:35:21,369
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1007
01:35:42,026 --> 01:35:44,065
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?

1008
01:35:44,195 --> 01:35:46,234
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1009
01:35:47,114 --> 01:35:49,072
That'll do.

1010
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:01,460
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

1011
01:36:01,587 --> 01:36:03,663
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

1012
01:36:03,798 --> 01:36:05,671
As a member of the senate...

1013
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:08,635
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1014
01:36:09,011 --> 01:36:10,968
Don't worry.

1015
01:36:11,222 --> 01:36:13,511
I've given up
trying to argue with you.

1016
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:21,474
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

1017
01:36:21,607 --> 01:36:23,481
they would have asked for it.

1018
01:36:23,609 --> 01:36:26,729
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behaviour.

1019
01:36:52,638 --> 01:36:55,805
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

1020
01:36:57,893 --> 01:37:00,467
I am programmed
to understand humans!

1021
01:37:04,066 --> 01:37:05,940
"What does that mean?"

1022
01:37:06,068 --> 01:37:08,773
That means I am in charge here!

1023
01:37:08,904 --> 01:37:10,529
Where are you going now?

1024
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:14,155
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

1025
01:37:14,535 --> 01:37:16,195
Idiot!

1026
01:37:18,414 --> 01:37:20,157
Please wait.

1027
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:22,867
Do you know where you're going?

1028
01:37:35,514 --> 01:37:37,139
Wait.

1029
01:38:52,925 --> 01:38:54,633
Oh, my goodness!

1030
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:56,302
Shut me down!

1031
01:38:57,429 --> 01:38:59,387
Machines making machines.

1032
01:38:59,515 --> 01:39:00,974
How perverse!

1033
01:39:01,934 --> 01:39:03,345
Calm down, R2!

1034
01:39:03,477 --> 01:39:05,933
I almost fell.

1035
01:39:06,063 --> 01:39:08,020
You'll get your chance-

1036
01:39:10,025 --> 01:39:11,852
I'm scrap.

1037
01:39:12,945 --> 01:39:15,317
It's a nightmare!

1038
01:39:17,116 --> 01:39:19,073
I want to go home!

1039
01:39:20,619 --> 01:39:22,493
What did I do to deserve this?

1040
01:40:02,453 --> 01:40:04,659
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

1041
01:40:04,788 --> 01:40:07,161
He's always getting himself
into trouble.

1042
01:40:08,542 --> 01:40:10,120
Oh, no!

1043
01:40:19,553 --> 01:40:21,178
Uh-oh.

1044
01:40:24,808 --> 01:40:26,766
I'm so confused.

1045
01:42:22,676 --> 01:42:24,503
Not again!

1046
01:42:24,845 --> 01:42:26,802
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1047
01:42:35,939 --> 01:42:37,350
Don't move,Jedi!

1048
01:42:37,483 --> 01:42:38,977
Take him away.

1049
01:42:58,003 --> 01:42:59,830
Don't be afraid.

1050
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:03,583
I'm not afraid to die.

1051
01:43:08,430 --> 01:43:12,558
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1052
01:43:13,852 --> 01:43:16,390
What are you talking about?

1053
01:43:17,898 --> 01:43:19,938
I love you.

1054
01:43:23,737 --> 01:43:25,694
You love me?

1055
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:33,410
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...

1056
01:43:35,165 --> 01:43:38,166
that we would be forced
to live a lie...

1057
01:43:39,044 --> 01:43:42,045
and that it would destroy our lives.

1058
01:43:42,965 --> 01:43:45,207
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1059
01:43:50,347 --> 01:43:52,174
I truly...

1060
01:43:53,183 --> 01:43:55,591
deeply love you...

1061
01:43:56,812 --> 01:43:59,385
and before we die,
I want you to know.

1062
01:44:56,538 --> 01:44:59,160
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1063
01:44:59,291 --> 01:45:02,327
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1064
01:45:04,713 --> 01:45:06,587
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

1065
01:45:07,549 --> 01:45:09,091
Good job.

1066
01:45:21,438 --> 01:45:24,474
Settle down. Settle down.

1067
01:45:28,487 --> 01:45:32,187
Let the executions begin.

1068
01:46:04,982 --> 01:46:07,899
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1069
01:46:33,468 --> 01:46:35,959
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1070
01:46:36,096 --> 01:46:38,219
She seems to be on top of things.

1071
01:47:41,203 --> 01:47:42,911
She can't do that!

1072
01:47:43,038 --> 01:47:44,947
Shoot her... or something!

1073
01:49:03,785 --> 01:49:05,196
Jump!

1074
01:49:29,311 --> 01:49:32,846
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1075
01:49:32,981 --> 01:49:34,606
Jango! Finish her off!

1076
01:49:34,733 --> 01:49:37,936
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

1077
01:50:08,809 --> 01:50:10,267
Master Windu.

1078
01:50:10,393 --> 01:50:12,682
How pleasant of you to join us.

1079
01:50:12,813 --> 01:50:14,805
This party's over.

1080
01:50:28,411 --> 01:50:30,653
Brave...

1081
01:50:30,789 --> 01:50:33,114
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1082
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:35,076
You're impossibly outnumbered.

1083
01:50:35,210 --> 01:50:37,535
I don't think so.

1084
01:50:37,671 --> 01:50:39,081
We'll see.

1085
01:51:17,836 --> 01:51:20,409
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1086
01:52:00,170 --> 01:52:02,625
What's all this noise?
A battle!

1087
01:52:02,756 --> 01:52:04,914
There's been some terrible mistake!

1088
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:07,754
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1089
01:53:35,306 --> 01:53:37,133
Die,Jedi dogs!

1090
01:53:37,267 --> 01:53:39,010
Oh! What did I say?

1091
01:53:48,111 --> 01:53:51,397
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1092
01:53:57,078 --> 01:53:59,996
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.

1093
01:54:14,471 --> 01:54:17,970
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1094
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:25,061
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

1095
01:54:43,249 --> 01:54:45,491
R2, what are you doing here?

1096
01:54:48,713 --> 01:54:50,042
What are you doing?

1097
01:54:50,173 --> 01:54:52,794
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.

1098
01:54:52,926 --> 01:54:54,669
My neck!

1099
01:54:56,971 --> 01:55:00,008
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!

1100
01:55:05,021 --> 01:55:07,061
I'm quite beside myself.

1101
01:55:15,782 --> 01:55:18,985
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1102
01:55:20,453 --> 01:55:22,944
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1103
01:55:45,728 --> 01:55:47,353
Master Windu...

1104
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:49,687
<i>you have fought gallantly...</i>

1105
01:55:50,859 --> 01:55:54,903
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.

1106
01:55:56,865 --> 01:55:58,145
Now...

1107
01:55:59,159 --> 01:56:01,531
it is finished.

1108
01:56:01,661 --> 01:56:03,488
Surrender...

1109
01:56:03,746 --> 01:56:06,451
and your lives will be spared.

1110
01:56:07,333 --> 01:56:10,418
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1111
01:56:10,545 --> 01:56:11,576
Then...

1112
01:56:13,047 --> 01:56:15,123
I'm sorry, old friend.

1113
01:56:25,810 --> 01:56:27,221
Look!

1114
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:43,190
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

1115
01:57:39,759 --> 01:57:42,760
I've had the most peculiar dream!

1116
01:57:53,398 --> 01:57:55,355
If Dooku escapes...

1117
01:57:55,483 --> 01:57:59,184
rally more systems
to his cause he will.

1118
01:58:03,741 --> 01:58:05,568
Hold on!

1119
01:58:10,123 --> 01:58:12,080
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1120
01:58:18,423 --> 01:58:20,664
Good call, my young Padawan.

1121
01:58:34,939 --> 01:58:37,228
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

1122
01:58:37,358 --> 01:58:39,434
That doesn't seem possible.

1123
01:58:39,819 --> 01:58:42,227
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1124
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:45,733
We must send
all available droids into battle.

1125
01:58:45,867 --> 01:58:47,776
There are too many.

1126
01:58:48,745 --> 01:58:51,496
Our communications have been jammed.

1127
01:58:59,714 --> 01:59:02,631
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1128
01:59:02,759 --> 01:59:04,039
Yes, sir.

1129
01:59:12,143 --> 01:59:13,388
Sir...

1130
01:59:13,519 --> 01:59:16,141
I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1131
01:59:17,148 --> 01:59:20,434
To the forward command centre
take me.

1132
01:59:43,758 --> 01:59:46,510
Attack those Federation starships,
quickly!

1133
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:01,264
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1134
02:00:01,401 --> 02:00:03,227
Very good.

1135
02:00:03,903 --> 02:00:05,528
Very good.

1136
02:00:33,725 --> 02:00:35,801
This is not looking good at all!

1137
02:00:37,103 --> 02:00:40,353
We must get the starships
back into space.

1138
02:00:43,401 --> 02:00:47,315
We have to order a retreat.

1139
02:00:47,447 --> 02:00:49,772
My master will never allow
the Republic...

1140
02:00:49,907 --> 02:00:52,196
to get away with this treachery.

1141
02:00:52,368 --> 02:00:55,571
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

1142
02:00:55,705 --> 02:00:59,749
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1143
02:01:02,170 --> 02:01:07,460
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

1144
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:13,127
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1145
02:01:14,098 --> 02:01:16,803
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1146
02:02:11,364 --> 02:02:16,109
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1147
02:02:16,244 --> 02:02:18,070
Yes, sir.

1148
02:02:18,204 --> 02:02:21,655
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

1149
02:03:01,789 --> 02:03:03,248
Look over there!

1150
02:03:06,752 --> 02:03:09,125
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1151
02:03:09,255 --> 02:03:11,129
We're out of rockets, sir.

1152
02:03:11,257 --> 02:03:14,092
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1153
02:03:14,427 --> 02:03:18,259
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1154
02:03:41,746 --> 02:03:44,319
Put the ship down!

1155
02:03:44,457 --> 02:03:46,330
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

1156
02:03:46,459 --> 02:03:48,202
Follow that speeder!

1157
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:56,625
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1158
02:03:56,761 --> 02:04:00,212
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1159
02:04:00,348 --> 02:04:03,348
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1160
02:04:03,476 --> 02:04:05,718
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

1161
02:04:05,853 --> 02:04:09,056
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1162
02:04:09,190 --> 02:04:11,811
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1163
02:04:16,489 --> 02:04:18,481
She would do her duty.

1164
02:04:27,500 --> 02:04:29,539
The droid army is in full retreat.

1165
02:04:29,669 --> 02:04:32,753
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1166
02:04:59,740 --> 02:05:02,860
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1167
02:05:02,993 --> 02:05:04,653
We'll take him together.

1168
02:05:04,787 --> 02:05:06,744
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

1169
02:05:14,922 --> 02:05:18,421
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1170
02:05:18,551 --> 02:05:20,460
Now... back down.

1171
02:05:26,308 --> 02:05:28,135
I don't think so.

1172
02:05:41,115 --> 02:05:43,653
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1173
02:05:43,784 --> 02:05:46,869
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1174
02:05:49,248 --> 02:05:51,656
Surely you can do better.

1175
02:06:02,845 --> 02:06:04,719
Are you all right?

1176
02:06:04,847 --> 02:06:06,507
Uh-huh.

1177
02:06:07,141 --> 02:06:09,383
We'd better get back
to the forward command centre.

1178
02:06:09,518 --> 02:06:11,096
No.

1179
02:06:11,228 --> 02:06:14,728
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1180
02:06:14,857 --> 02:06:16,814
Get a transport. Hurry!

1181
02:06:16,942 --> 02:06:17,974
Right away.

1182
02:06:43,135 --> 02:06:44,962
Brave of you, boy.

1183
02:06:46,263 --> 02:06:48,470
<i>But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.</i>

1184
02:06:48,599 --> 02:06:50,177
I am a slow learner.

1185
02:07:52,663 --> 02:07:54,406
Master Yoda.

1186
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:57,576
Count Dooku.

1187
02:07:57,710 --> 02:08:01,043
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1188
02:08:32,369 --> 02:08:35,287
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1189
02:08:35,789 --> 02:08:38,874
The dark side I sense in you.

1190
02:08:39,001 --> 02:08:41,788
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

1191
02:08:42,922 --> 02:08:44,546
Even you.

1192
02:08:59,939 --> 02:09:02,975
Much to learn you still have.

1193
02:09:03,108 --> 02:09:06,275
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

1194
02:09:06,403 --> 02:09:08,645
by our knowledge of the Force...

1195
02:09:10,699 --> 02:09:13,273
but by our skills with a lightsabre.

1196
02:09:55,077 --> 02:09:58,280
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

1197
02:09:58,414 --> 02:10:00,157
This is just the beginning.

1198
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:35,816
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1199
02:12:36,196 --> 02:12:38,901
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1200
02:12:40,784 --> 02:12:43,109
You have done well.

1201
02:12:43,579 --> 02:12:45,571
I have good news for you, my lord.

1202
02:12:47,082 --> 02:12:50,118
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1203
02:12:50,711 --> 02:12:53,416
Everything is going as planned.

1204
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:07,340
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1205
02:13:07,895 --> 02:13:09,887
It doesn't feel right.

1206
02:13:10,230 --> 02:13:13,184
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1207
02:13:14,526 --> 02:13:16,234
Lies, deceit...

1208
02:13:16,361 --> 02:13:20,110
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1209
02:13:20,240 --> 02:13:21,651
Nevertheless..

1210
02:13:21,783 --> 02:13:24,535
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

1211
02:13:24,912 --> 02:13:26,951
I agree.

1212
02:13:28,081 --> 02:13:29,955
Where is your apprentice?

1213
02:13:30,083 --> 02:13:33,951
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1214
02:13:35,756 --> 02:13:39,125
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1215
02:13:39,509 --> 02:13:41,549
Victory?

1216
02:13:42,429 --> 02:13:44,801
Victory, you say?

1217
02:13:44,932 --> 02:13:48,632
