2
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:19,387
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

3
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:24,388
Very good, Lieutenant.

4
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:18,233
We made it.

5
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,364
I guess I was wrong.

6
00:03:20,365 --> 00:03:25,365
There was no danger at all.

7
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:44,430
Cordé.

8
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:48,267
Milady, I'm so sorry.

9
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:50,478
I've failed you, Senator.

10
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,774
No.

11
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:59,775
Milady, you're still in danger here.

12
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:07,328
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

13
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:12,329
You did your duty. Cordé did hers. Now, come.

14
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:17,834
Senator Amidala, please.

15
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:30,434
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

16
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:33,354
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

17
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:35,314
If they do break away-

18
00:04:35,315 --> 00:04:38,651
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

19
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:40,820
be split in two.

20
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:44,156
My negotiations will not fail.

21
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:46,617
If they do, you must realize...

22
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:49,620
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

23
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:53,791
We're keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

24
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:56,418
Master Yoda...

25
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:00,631
do you think it will really come to war?

26
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:05,010
The dark side clouds everything.

27
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:10,011
Impossible to see the future is.

28
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:15,187
<i>The Loyalist Committee has arrived, Your Honor.</i>

29
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:18,691
Good.

30
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,943
Send them in.

31
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:25,944
We will discuss this matter later.

32
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:31,996
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform-

33
00:05:31,997 --> 00:05:34,165
terrible.

34
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,877
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

35
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:40,713
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

36
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:45,714
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

37
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:48,387
I think that Count Dooku was behind it.

38
00:05:48,388 --> 00:05:52,391
He is a political idealist, not a murderer.

39
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:55,519
You know, milady, Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

40
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,064
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

41
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:01,734
But for certain, Senator...

42
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:06,735
in grave danger you are.

43
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,742
Master Jedi, may I suggest...

44
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:13,954
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

45
00:06:13,955 --> 00:06:17,124
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

46
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,335
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe-

47
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:22,254
The situation is that serious?

48
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:24,340
No, but I do, Senator.

49
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:27,801
I realize all too well
that additional security...

50
00:06:27,802 --> 00:06:31,388
might be disruptive for you...

51
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,433
but perhaps someone you're familiar with.

52
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:39,104
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

53
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:40,689
That's possible.

54
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,610
He'sjust returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

55
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:46,862
Do it for me, milady. Please?

56
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:50,991
The thought of losing you...

57
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:53,786
is unbearable.

58
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:57,206
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

59
00:06:57,207 --> 00:07:02,207
Thank you, Master Windu.

60
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:12,471
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

61
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:16,850
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

62
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,978
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

63
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:21,855
and I rescued you, remember?

64
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:26,856
Oh... yes.

65
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:34,322
You're sweating. Relax. Take a deep breath.

66
00:07:34,452 --> 00:07:39,452
I haven't seen her in ten years, Master.

67
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:54,138
Obi? Obi!

68
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,891
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you agaimjarjar.

69
00:07:57,892 --> 00:07:59,977
Senator Padmé.

70
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:03,689
Mesa palos here! Lookie, lookie, Senator.

71
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,690
Desa Jedi arriven.

72
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:13,115
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

73
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:16,994
It has been far too long, Master Kenobi.

74
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:18,495
<i>Am?</i>

75
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:21,915
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

76
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,418
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

77
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:29,419
Well, for a senator, I mean.

78
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:34,219
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

79
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,765
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

80
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,351
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

81
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:42,519
Queenjamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

82
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,730
I am grateful you are here, Master Kenobi.

83
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:47,608
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

84
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:50,402
I don't need more security. I need answers.

85
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:52,738
I want to know who's trying to kill me.

86
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:56,700
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

87
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:59,161
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

88
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:01,121
I promise you.

89
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:03,957
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

90
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,002
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

91
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:09,630
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

92
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,715
and you will pay attention to my lead.

93
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:15,636
- Why?
- What?

94
00:09:15,637 --> 00:09:19,473
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

95
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:22,893
Protection is a job
for local security, notjedi.

96
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:25,813
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

97
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:30,814
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

98
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:36,569
And you will learn your place, young one.

99
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,244
Perhaps with merely your presence...

100
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:43,247
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

101
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:46,125
Now, if you'll excuse me...

102
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:49,169
I will retire.

103
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,296
I know I'll feel better having you here.

104
00:09:51,297 --> 00:09:53,048
I'll have an officer stationed
on every ﬂoor...

105
00:09:53,049 --> 00:09:57,428
and I'll be in the control center downstairs.

106
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,514
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

107
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:05,310
She hardly even recognized me,jarjar.

108
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:09,606
I've thought about her
every day since we parted...

109
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:11,650
and she's forgotten me completely.

110
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:15,946
Shesa happy.
Happier den mesa seein her in a Iongo time.

111
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:20,033
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

112
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:22,619
She was pleased to see us.

113
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,620
Now, let's check the security.

114
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:35,799
I hit the ship, but they used a decoy.

115
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,177
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

116
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,262
My client is getting impatient.

117
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:43,223
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

118
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:48,224
And, Zam, there can be no mistakes this time.

119
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:52,524
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

120
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:55,027
No assassin would try that way.

121
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:59,156
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

122
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:02,367
I don't likejust waiting here
for something to happen to her.

123
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:06,330
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

124
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,499
I don't think she liked me watching her.

125
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,501
What is she thinking?

126
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:13,587
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

127
00:11:13,588 --> 00:11:16,298
There are many other ways to kill a senator.

128
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:21,299
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

129
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:24,973
You're using her as bait.

130
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:27,184
It was her idea.

131
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:29,853
Don't worry. No harm will come to her.

132
00:11:29,854 --> 00:11:32,898
I can sense everything going on in that room.

133
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,275
Trust me.

134
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:37,694
It's too risky.

135
00:11:37,695 --> 00:11:41,281
Besides, your senses aren't that attuned,
my young apprentice.

136
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:45,536
And yours are?

137
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:50,537
Possibly.

138
00:12:01,761 --> 00:12:04,429
You look tired.

139
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,515
I don't sleep well anymore.

140
00:12:06,516 --> 00:12:11,516
Because of your mother?

141
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:19,232
I don't know why I keep dreaming about her.

142
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:23,240
Dreams pass in time.

143
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:25,909
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

144
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,247
Just being around her again is... intoxicating.

145
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:32,791
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

146
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:35,252
You've made a commitment to thejedi order...

147
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:37,421
a commitment not easily broken.

148
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:40,257
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

149
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:42,968
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

150
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:45,262
It is my experience that senators focus...

151
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:48,849
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

152
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,519
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

153
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,813
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

154
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:59,814
At least not on the economics of politics.

155
00:13:53,247 --> 00:13:56,083
And besides, you're generalizing.

156
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:58,251
The chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.

157
00:13:58,252 --> 00:14:00,003
Palpatine is a politician.

158
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:02,756
I have observed that he is very clever...

159
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:06,843
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

160
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:08,845
I think he's a good man-

161
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:13,846
I sense it too.

162
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Stay here!

163
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:37,370
Are you all right, milady?

164
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:13,698
What the-

165
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:23,541
<i>Jedi poo doo!</i>

166
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:24,481
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

167
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:27,484
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

168
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:30,946
With the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

169
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:33,865
If you spent as long practicing your
saber techniques as you do your wit...

170
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,700
you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.

171
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:37,494
I thought I already did.

172
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:42,495
Only in your mind, my very young apprentice.

173
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:13,693
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

174
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:20,537
You know I don't like it when you do that.

175
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:23,832
Sorry, Master. I forgot you don't like ﬂying.

176
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:28,833
I don't mind ﬂying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

177
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:58,033
Anakin! How many times have I told you...

178
00:17:58,034 --> 00:18:02,913
stay away from power couplings!

179
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:07,914
That was good!

180
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:22,474
Where are you going? He went that way.

181
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:24,601
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

182
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:26,686
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

183
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,107
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

184
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:36,108
This is a shortcut... I think.

185
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:03,974
Well, you've lost him.

186
00:19:03,975 --> 00:19:06,142
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

187
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:08,144
That was some shortcut, Anakin.

188
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:10,647
He went completely the other way.

189
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:15,235
- Once again you've proved-
- If you'll excuse me.

190
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:20,236
I hate it when he does that.

191
00:21:46,846 --> 00:21:48,721
Anakin!

192
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:51,683
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

193
00:21:51,684 --> 00:21:54,769
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.

194
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,148
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.

195
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:01,067
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

196
00:22:01,068 --> 00:22:05,113
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

197
00:22:05,114 --> 00:22:07,907
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

198
00:22:07,908 --> 00:22:09,701
Don't say that, Master.

199
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:11,870
You're the closest thing I have to a father.

200
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:13,872
Then why don't you listen to me?

201
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:18,873
I am trying-

202
00:22:27,553 --> 00:22:29,596
Can you see him?

203
00:22:29,597 --> 00:22:31,681
I think he is a she...

204
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:34,934
and I think she is a changeling.

205
00:22:34,935 --> 00:22:39,606
In that case, be extra careful.

206
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:42,150
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

207
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:47,151
For a drink.

208
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:57,248
Thank you.

209
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:00,376
- You wanna buy some death sticks?
- You don't want to sell me death sticks.

210
00:23:00,377 --> 00:23:02,128
I don't want to sell you death sticks.

211
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:03,963
You want to go home and rethink your life.

212
00:23:03,964 --> 00:23:08,964
I want to go home and rethink my life.

213
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,516
<i>EaSY-</i>

214
00:23:56,517 --> 00:24:01,517
Jedi business. Go back to your drinks.

215
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:08,611
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

216
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:10,446
It was a senator from Naboo.

217
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:14,284
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

218
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:17,996
Who hired you? Tell us.

219
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:20,999
Tell us now!

220
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It was a bounty hunter called-

221
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:33,090
<i>Wee shahnit... sleemo.</i>

222
00:24:42,187 --> 00:24:47,187
Toxic dart.

223
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:58,578
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

224
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:02,123
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

225
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:06,127
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

226
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:10,798
Handle that your Padawan will.

227
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,552
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

228
00:25:14,553 --> 00:25:18,389
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

229
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,475
Travel as refugees.

230
00:25:20,476 --> 00:25:23,519
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

231
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,856
to get Senator Amidala to leave the capital.

232
00:25:26,857 --> 00:25:29,776
Until caught this killer is...

233
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:33,279
ourjudgment she must respect.

234
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,490
Anakin, go to the senate...

235
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:40,491
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

236
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:49,629
I will talk with her.

237
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,882
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

238
00:25:52,883 --> 00:25:55,134
I know her well enough to assure you of that.

239
00:25:55,135 --> 00:25:57,303
Thank you, Your Excellency.

240
00:25:57,304 --> 00:26:01,766
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

241
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,893
Your patience has paid off.

242
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:07,355
Your guidance more than my patience.

243
00:26:07,356 --> 00:26:11,067
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

244
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:15,988
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

245
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:20,989
Then you will be invincible.

246
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:23,246
I have said it many times:

247
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:26,124
You are the most gifted Jedi I have ever met.

248
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,126
Thank you, Your Excellency.

249
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:31,921
I see you becoming the greatest
of all thejedi, Anakin...

250
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:36,922
even more powerful than Master Yoda.

251
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:41,764
I am concerned for my Padawan.

252
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:44,600
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

253
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:47,937
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

254
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,981
The boy has exceptional skills.

255
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:52,525
But he still has much to learn, Master.

256
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:56,112
His abilities have made him, well, arrogant.

257
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:58,156
Yes.

258
00:26:58,157 --> 00:27:03,035
A flaw more and more common amongjedi.

259
00:27:03,036 --> 00:27:05,705
Too sure of themselves they are.

260
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:09,250
Even the older, more experienced ones.

261
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:12,962
Remember, Obi-Wan, if the prophecy is true...

262
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:17,963
your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.

263
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:23,639
I'm taking an extended leave of absence.

264
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,851
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

265
00:27:26,852 --> 00:27:29,854
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

266
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:34,734
Mesa honored to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

267
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:39,113
Mesa accept this with muy, muy humility and-

268
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:41,824
jarjar, I don't wish to hold you up.

269
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:43,868
I'm sure you have a great deal to do.

270
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,995
Of course.

271
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:50,996
Milady.

272
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:55,004
I do not like this idea of hiding.

273
00:27:55,005 --> 00:27:56,339
Don't worry.

274
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,674
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

275
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:01,427
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

276
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:04,430
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

277
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:06,599
to not be here when its fate is decided.

278
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,768
Sometimes we must let go of our pride...

279
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:10,811
and do what is requested of us.

280
00:28:10,812 --> 00:28:15,733
Anakin, you've grown up.

281
00:28:15,734 --> 00:28:20,734
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it.

282
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:29,705
Don't get me wrong.
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

283
00:28:29,706 --> 00:28:32,375
As wise as Master Yoda and...

284
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:36,879
as powerful as Master Windu.

285
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,425
I am truly thankful to be his apprentice.

286
00:28:41,426 --> 00:28:46,426
In some ways- a lot of ways-

287
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:49,267
I'm really ahead of him.

288
00:28:49,268 --> 00:28:51,185
I'm ready for the trials...

289
00:28:51,186 --> 00:28:54,730
but he feels that I'm too unpredictable.

290
00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:57,483
He won't let me move on.

291
00:28:57,484 --> 00:28:59,902
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

292
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:02,780
He's overly critical. He never listens.

293
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:05,241
He doesn't understand.

294
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:07,451
It's not fair!

295
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:12,415
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

296
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:16,502
It's the only way we grow.

297
00:29:16,503 --> 00:29:18,879
I know.

298
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,301
Anakin...

299
00:29:23,302 --> 00:29:25,886
don't try to grow up too fast.

300
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:30,016
But I am grown up.

301
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:33,102
You said it yourself.

302
00:29:33,103 --> 00:29:36,188
Please don't look at me like that.

303
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:37,773
Why not?

304
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:41,944
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

305
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:46,945
Sorry, milady.

306
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:02,048
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

307
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:05,217
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

308
00:30:05,218 --> 00:30:10,218
He'll be safe with me.

309
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:13,351
You'll be fine.

310
00:30:13,352 --> 00:30:16,687
It's not me, milady. I worry about you.

311
00:30:16,688 --> 00:30:20,191
What if they realize you've left the capital?

312
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:23,569
Well, then myjedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

313
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,571
Anakin...

314
00:30:25,572 --> 00:30:28,783
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

315
00:30:28,784 --> 00:30:31,869
Yes, Master.

316
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,538
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

317
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:36,540
You'll be back here in no time.

318
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:39,877
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Masterjedi.

319
00:30:39,878 --> 00:30:41,879
- It's time to go.
- I know.

320
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,548
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

321
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:49,549
May the Force be with you, Master.

322
00:30:58,063 --> 00:31:00,022
Suddenly I'm afraid.

323
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:05,023
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

324
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:11,071
Don't worry. We have R2 with us.

325
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:16,872
I do hope he doesn't try anything foolish.

326
00:31:16,873 --> 00:31:21,873
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

327
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:44,275
Someone to see ya, honey!

328
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:47,194
Jedi, by the looks of him.

329
00:31:47,195 --> 00:31:49,947
Obi-Wan!

330
00:31:49,948 --> 00:31:51,323
Hello, Dex.

331
00:31:51,324 --> 00:31:56,324
Take a seat. I'll be right with ya.

332
00:31:56,329 --> 00:32:01,329
- You wanna cup o'jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

333
00:32:03,962 --> 00:32:08,962
Old buddy!

334
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:18,601
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

335
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:21,937
You can tell me what this is.

336
00:32:21,938 --> 00:32:25,274
Well, whattaya know!

337
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:27,735
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

338
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:31,113
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

339
00:32:31,114 --> 00:32:33,657
Can you tell me where it came from?

340
00:32:33,658 --> 00:32:36,702
This baby belongs to them cloners.

341
00:32:36,703 --> 00:32:41,123
What you got here is a Kamino saberdart.

342
00:32:41,124 --> 00:32:44,210
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

343
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:47,630
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

344
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:51,675
Those analysis droids only focus on symbols.

345
00:32:51,676 --> 00:32:54,011
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

346
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:57,515
for the difference between knowledge and...

347
00:32:57,516 --> 00:32:59,308
wisdom.

348
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:01,101
Well, if droids could think...

349
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:04,188
there'd be none of us here, would there?

350
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:06,524
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

351
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:08,567
No, no. it's beyond the outer rim.

352
00:33:08,568 --> 00:33:13,568
I'd say about 12 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

353
00:33:14,074 --> 00:33:19,074
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

354
00:33:19,704 --> 00:33:24,667
These Kaminoans keep to themselves.

355
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:28,629
They're cloners. Damn good ones too.

356
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:32,216
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

357
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:34,218
Depends on what, Dex?

358
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:37,221
On how good your manners are...

359
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:42,222
and how big your... pocketbook is.

360
00:33:52,237 --> 00:33:55,030
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

361
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:57,283
Are you having a problem, Master Kenobi?

362
00:33:57,284 --> 00:34:00,703
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

363
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:03,080
It doesn't show up on the archive charts.

364
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:07,459
Kamino. it's not a system I'm familiar with.

365
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,920
Are you sure you have the right coordinates?

366
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:13,048
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

367
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:18,049
just south of the Rishi Maze.

368
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:25,477
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

369
00:34:25,478 --> 00:34:27,271
doesn't exist.

370
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:30,900
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

371
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:34,069
If an item does not appear in our records...

372
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:39,070
it does not exist.

373
00:34:57,844 --> 00:35:00,512
Hey, you! No droids!

374
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:05,513
Get outta here!

375
00:35:09,272 --> 00:35:11,941
Thank you, R2.

376
00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:14,944
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to thejedi...

377
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:18,948
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

378
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:21,992
Or be with the people that I love.

379
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:24,161
Are you allowed to love?

380
00:35:24,162 --> 00:35:29,162
I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.

381
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:33,629
Attachment is forbidden.

382
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,631
Possession is forbidden.

383
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:39,301
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

384
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:44,223
is central to a jedi's life.

385
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:48,686
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

386
00:35:48,687 --> 00:35:50,729
You've changed so much.

387
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,399
You haven't changed a bit.

388
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,400
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

389
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,751
Reach out. Sense the Force around you.

390
00:36:12,752 --> 00:36:17,752
Use your feelings you must.

391
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:23,012
Younglings. Younglings!

392
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:25,514
A visitor we have.

393
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:28,517
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

394
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:30,060
Hello.

395
00:36:30,061 --> 00:36:31,687
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

396
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:35,482
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

397
00:36:35,483 --> 00:36:38,485
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

398
00:36:38,486 --> 00:36:43,240
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

399
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:46,201
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

400
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:51,202
How embarrassing. How embarrassing!

401
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:54,960
Liam, the shades.

402
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:57,546
Gather round the map reader.

403
00:36:57,547 --> 00:36:59,590
Clear your minds...

404
00:36:59,591 --> 00:37:04,470
and find Obi-Wan's wayward planet we will.

405
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:07,765
It ought to be here...

406
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,767
but it isn't.

407
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:14,768
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

408
00:37:14,773 --> 00:37:16,982
Gravity's silhouette remains...

409
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:20,069
but the star and all the planets...

410
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,154
disappeared they have.

411
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:25,491
How can this be?

412
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:28,035
A thought?

413
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:30,412
Anyone.

414
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:31,914
Master?

415
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:36,915
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

416
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:43,129
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

417
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:47,262
The Padawan is right.

418
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:50,432
Go to the center of gravity's pull...

419
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:55,433
and find your planet you will.

420
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:02,778
The data must have been erased.

421
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:07,616
But who could empty information from
the archives? isn't that impossible?

422
00:38:07,617 --> 00:38:11,120
Dangerous and disturbing this puzzle is.

423
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:15,624
Only a Jedi could have erased those files.

424
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:19,962
But who and why, harder to answer.

425
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:24,963
Meditate on this I will.

426
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:50,200
I wasn't the youngest queen ever elected...

427
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:53,912
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

428
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:55,998
I'm not sure I was ready.

429
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:58,917
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

430
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:01,086
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

431
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:03,255
so you could stay in office.

432
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:05,841
I was relieved when my two terms were up.

433
00:39:05,842 --> 00:39:09,678
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

434
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,930
I couldn't refuse her.

435
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:16,931
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

436
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:22,395
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

437
00:39:26,446 --> 00:39:30,240
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

438
00:39:30,241 --> 00:39:32,159
It's unthinkable!

439
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,662
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

440
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:38,248
Do you see any way through negotiations...

441
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:40,459
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

442
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,753
Not if they feel threatened.

443
00:39:42,754 --> 00:39:46,256
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

444
00:39:46,257 --> 00:39:48,300
It's outrageous...

445
00:39:48,301 --> 00:39:50,719
but after four trials in the Supreme Court...

446
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,598
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

447
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,599
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

448
00:40:00,772 --> 00:40:05,772
We must keep our faith in the Republic.

449
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:13,951
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

450
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:16,787
Let's pray that day never comes.

451
00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:20,290
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

452
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:22,626
What is your suggestion, Masterjedi?

453
00:40:22,627 --> 00:40:26,129
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.

454
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,090
- But I was thinking-
- Hold on a minute.

455
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:29,466
Excuse me.

456
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:31,969
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

457
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,179
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

458
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,141
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

459
00:40:38,142 --> 00:40:41,228
And this is my home. I know it very well.
That is why we're here.

460
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:43,313
I think it would be wise...

461
00:40:43,314 --> 00:40:47,109
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

462
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:52,110
Sorry, milady.

463
00:40:52,115 --> 00:40:57,115
Perfect. it's settled, then.

464
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:11,174
There it is, R4, right where it should be.

465
00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:16,175
Our missing planet Kamino.

466
00:41:51,174 --> 00:41:54,009
Masterjedi.

467
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,679
The prime minister is expecting you.

468
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,058
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

469
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:03,393
He is anxious to meet you.

470
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:05,687
After all these years...

471
00:42:05,688 --> 00:42:09,399
we were beginning to think you weren't coming.

472
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Now, please, this way.

473
00:42:24,332 --> 00:42:27,042
May I present Lama Su...

474
00:42:27,043 --> 00:42:30,796
prime minister of Kamino.

475
00:42:30,797 --> 00:42:33,090
And this is Masterjedi-

476
00:42:33,091 --> 00:42:35,092
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

477
00:42:35,093 --> 00:42:39,805
I trust you're going to enjoy your stay.

478
00:42:39,806 --> 00:42:43,475
Please.

479
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:45,769
And now to business.

480
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:50,770
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

481
00:42:50,817 --> 00:42:52,818
200,000 units are ready...

482
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:56,279
with a million more well on the way.

483
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,365
That's good news.

484
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:01,618
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

485
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:05,080
that his order will be met on time.

486
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:08,250
I'm sorry. Master-

487
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:10,919
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

488
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,131
a leading member of thejedi Council,
is he not?

489
00:43:14,132 --> 00:43:19,132
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

490
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:22,013
I'm so sorry to hear that.

491
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:26,393
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

492
00:43:26,394 --> 00:43:28,854
The army?

493
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:32,649
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

494
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,943
one of the finest we've ever created.

495
00:43:34,944 --> 00:43:37,028
Tell me, Prime Minister...

496
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:39,656
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

497
00:43:39,657 --> 00:43:41,867
did he say who it was for?

498
00:43:41,868 --> 00:43:43,994
Of course he did.

499
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:47,539
This army is for the Republic.

500
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:52,540
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

501
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:57,712
That's why I'm here.

502
00:44:15,526 --> 00:44:19,529
We used to come here for school retreat.

503
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:22,908
We would swim to that island every day.

504
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:27,909
I love the water.

505
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,752
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

506
00:44:33,753 --> 00:44:38,753
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

507
00:44:39,592 --> 00:44:42,344
I don't like sand.

508
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:46,431
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

509
00:44:46,432 --> 00:44:50,560
and it gets everywhere.

510
00:44:50,561 --> 00:44:53,355
Not like here.

511
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:57,359
Here, everything is soft...

512
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,360
and smooth.

513
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:38,567
No.

514
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:42,320
I shouldn't have done that.

515
00:45:42,321 --> 00:45:47,321
I'm sorry.

516
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,629
Very impressive.

517
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:04,630
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

518
00:46:04,927 --> 00:46:07,512
Clones can think creatively.

519
00:46:07,513 --> 00:46:12,513
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

520
00:46:15,187 --> 00:46:20,187
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

521
00:46:20,693 --> 00:46:24,154
This group was created about five years ago.

522
00:46:24,155 --> 00:46:26,323
You mentioned growth acceleration.

523
00:46:26,324 --> 00:46:28,366
Oh, yes, it's essential.

524
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:31,494
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

525
00:46:31,495 --> 00:46:34,205
Now we can do it in half the time.

526
00:46:34,206 --> 00:46:37,000
I see.

527
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:39,002
They are totally obedient...

528
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:41,796
taking any order without question.

529
00:46:41,797 --> 00:46:43,965
We modified their genetic structure...

530
00:46:43,966 --> 00:46:47,260
to make them less independent
than the original host.

531
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:49,846
And who was the original host?

532
00:46:49,847 --> 00:46:53,516
A bounty hunter called jango Fett.

533
00:46:53,517 --> 00:46:55,727
And where is this bounty hunter now?

534
00:46:55,728 --> 00:47:00,440
Oh, we keep him here.

535
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:03,568
Apart from his pay, which is considerable...

536
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:06,196
Fett demanded only one thing:

537
00:47:06,197 --> 00:47:08,865
an unaltered clone for himself.

538
00:47:08,866 --> 00:47:11,409
- Curious, isn't it?
- “Unaltered”?

539
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:14,037
Pure genetic replication.

540
00:47:14,038 --> 00:47:17,332
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

541
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:19,959
and no growth acceleration.

542
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,380
I should very much like
to meet thisjango Fett.

543
00:47:23,381 --> 00:47:28,381
I would be very happy to arrange it for you.

544
00:47:44,193 --> 00:47:49,193
Magnificent, aren't they?

545
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,079
I don't know.

546
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,456
Sure you do. You just don't want to tell me.

547
00:47:58,457 --> 00:48:00,917
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

548
00:48:00,918 --> 00:48:04,421
They only work on the weak-minded.

549
00:48:04,422 --> 00:48:06,214
All right.

550
00:48:06,215 --> 00:48:08,466
I was 12. His name was Palo.

551
00:48:08,467 --> 00:48:11,094
We were both in the Legislative Youth Program.

552
00:48:11,095 --> 00:48:14,139
He was a few years older than I. Very cute.

553
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,725
Dark, curly hair. Dreamy eyes.

554
00:48:16,726 --> 00:48:19,102
All right, I get the picture.

555
00:48:19,103 --> 00:48:21,104
Whatever happened to him?

556
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:23,940
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

557
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:26,109
Maybe he was the smart one.

558
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,445
You really don't like politicians, do you?

559
00:48:28,446 --> 00:48:30,739
I like two or three...

560
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,740
but I'm not really sure about one of them.

561
00:48:36,662 --> 00:48:39,122
I don't think the system works.

562
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:42,250
How would you have it work?

563
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:46,463
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

564
00:48:46,464 --> 00:48:49,132
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

565
00:48:49,133 --> 00:48:50,967
and then do it.

566
00:48:50,968 --> 00:48:52,969
That's exactly what we do.

567
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,054
The trouble is that people don't always agree.

568
00:48:55,055 --> 00:48:57,056
Well, then they should be made to.

569
00:48:57,057 --> 00:49:00,268
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

570
00:49:00,269 --> 00:49:02,437
- You?
- Of course not me.

571
00:49:02,438 --> 00:49:05,482
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

572
00:49:05,483 --> 00:49:10,483
Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.

573
00:49:10,654 --> 00:49:15,654
Well, if it works.

574
00:49:20,164 --> 00:49:22,040
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

575
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:27,041
I'd be much too frightened to tease a senator.

576
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:08,666
Ani, are you all right?

577
00:50:42,663 --> 00:50:46,583
Boba, is your father here?

578
00:50:46,584 --> 00:50:47,709
Yep.

579
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,420
May we see him?

580
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:54,257
Sure.

581
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:59,258
Dad, Taun We's here.

582
00:51:09,607 --> 00:51:12,442
Jango, welcome back.

583
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:14,444
Was your trip productive?

584
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:16,487
Fairly.

585
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:20,450
This isjedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

586
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:23,578
He's come to check on our progress.

587
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:26,539
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

588
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,667
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

589
00:51:29,668 --> 00:51:34,213
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

590
00:51:34,214 --> 00:51:38,384
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

591
00:51:38,385 --> 00:51:40,136
Possibly.

592
00:51:40,137 --> 00:51:45,137
Then you must know Master Sifo-Dyas.

593
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:50,271
<i>Boba, rood eht so-heeck.</i>

594
00:51:50,272 --> 00:51:53,691
Master who?

595
00:51:53,692 --> 00:51:55,818
Sifo-Dyas.

596
00:51:55,819 --> 00:52:00,819
Is he not thejedi who hired you for thisjob?

597
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:06,204
Never heard of him.

598
00:52:06,205 --> 00:52:08,331
Really?

599
00:52:08,332 --> 00:52:12,502
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

600
00:52:12,503 --> 00:52:17,503
Curious.

601
00:52:18,175 --> 00:52:21,219
Do you like your army?

602
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:24,472
I look forward to seeing them in action.

603
00:52:24,473 --> 00:52:27,934
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

604
00:52:27,935 --> 00:52:31,854
Thank you for your time, jango.

605
00:52:31,855 --> 00:52:36,855
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

606
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,838
What is it, Dad?

607
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:01,839
Pack your things. We're leaving.

608
00:53:03,721 --> 00:53:08,349
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

609
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:10,476
“Aggressive negotiations”? What's that?

610
00:53:10,477 --> 00:53:15,477
Well, negotiations with a lightsaber.

611
00:53:26,952 --> 00:53:31,952
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

612
00:53:59,443 --> 00:54:02,779
From the moment I met you...

613
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,406
all those years ago...

614
00:54:05,407 --> 00:54:10,407
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

615
00:54:11,121 --> 00:54:14,165
And now that I'm with you again...

616
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:19,166
I'm in agony.

617
00:54:19,588 --> 00:54:23,633
The closer I get to you, the worse it gets.

618
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:26,969
The thought of not being with you-

619
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:31,970
I can't breathe.

620
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:34,769
I'm haunted by the kiss...

621
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,189
that you should never have given me.

622
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,650
My heart is beating...

623
00:54:40,651 --> 00:54:45,651
hoping that that kiss will not become a scar.

624
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:48,783
You are in my very soul...

625
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:53,287
tormenting me.

626
00:54:53,288 --> 00:54:58,288
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

627
00:55:07,719 --> 00:55:12,719
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

628
00:55:13,183 --> 00:55:16,018
I can%.

629
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:19,355
We can't. it's...just not possible.

630
00:55:19,356 --> 00:55:22,441
Anything is possible, Padmé. Listen to me.

631
00:55:22,442 --> 00:55:25,027
No, you listen.

632
00:55:25,028 --> 00:55:28,865
We live in a real world. Come back to it.

633
00:55:28,866 --> 00:55:33,866
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

634
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:36,998
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

635
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:40,668
it'll take us to a place we cannot <i>go...</i>

636
00:55:40,669 --> 00:55:43,087
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

637
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:45,214
Then you do feel something.

638
00:55:45,215 --> 00:55:48,384
I will not let you give up your future for me.

639
00:55:48,385 --> 00:55:51,512
You are asking me to be rational.

640
00:55:51,513 --> 00:55:54,015
That is something I know I cannot do.

641
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:58,769
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...

642
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:01,731
but I can't.

643
00:56:01,732 --> 00:56:06,732
I will not give in to this.

644
00:56:11,575 --> 00:56:13,910
Well, you know...

645
00:56:13,911 --> 00:56:16,829
it wouldn't have to be that way.

646
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:21,125
We could keep it a secret.

647
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:23,252
We'd be living a lie...

648
00:56:23,253 --> 00:56:26,631
one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to.

649
00:56:26,632 --> 00:56:29,050
I couldn't do that.

650
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:33,888
Could you, Anakin? Could you live like that?

651
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:38,392
No. You're right.

652
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:43,393
It would destroy us.

653
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:52,114
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

654
00:56:52,115 --> 00:56:55,326
And remind them, if they need more troops...

655
00:56:55,327 --> 00:56:58,579
it will take more time to grow them.

656
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,456
I won't forget, and thank you.

657
00:57:00,457 --> 00:57:05,457
Thank you.

658
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,810
R4!

659
00:57:20,811 --> 00:57:25,811
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

660
00:57:30,612 --> 00:57:34,115
<i>I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.</i>

661
00:57:34,116 --> 00:57:38,119
<i>They are using a bounty hunter named
jango Fett to create a clone army.</i>

662
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,705
<i>I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...</i>

663
00:57:40,706 --> 00:57:42,915
<i>is the assassin we are looking for.</i>

664
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:45,001
Do you think these cloners are involved...

665
00:57:45,002 --> 00:57:47,169
in the plot to assassinate Senator Amidala?

666
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:50,172
<i>No, Master. There appears to be no motive.</i>

667
00:57:50,173 --> 00:57:53,175
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

668
00:57:53,176 --> 00:57:56,304
Clear your mind must be...

669
00:57:56,305 --> 00:58:00,558
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

670
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,518
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

671
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:05,688
<i>They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army...</i>

672
00:58:05,689 --> 00:58:10,689
<i>at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.</i>

673
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:15,114
<i>I was under the impression
he was killed before that.</i>

674
00:58:15,115 --> 00:58:18,743
<i>Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?</i>

675
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:20,745
No. Whoever placed that order...

676
00:58:20,746 --> 00:58:23,122
did not have the authorization
of thejedi Council.

677
00:58:23,123 --> 00:58:28,085
Bring him here. Question him we will.

678
00:58:28,086 --> 00:58:32,548
<i>Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.</i>

679
00:58:32,549 --> 00:58:37,549
Blind we are if creation of this clone army
we could not see.

680
00:58:41,892 --> 00:58:44,185
I think it is time we informed the senate...

681
00:58:44,186 --> 00:58:47,063
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

682
00:58:47,064 --> 00:58:51,567
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

683
00:58:51,568 --> 00:58:53,903
If informed the senate is...

684
00:58:53,904 --> 00:58:58,032
multiply our adversaries will.

685
00:58:58,033 --> 00:59:01,077
No.

686
00:59:01,078 --> 00:59:03,079
<i>Anakin! Help me!</i>

687
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:08,080
<i>- Mom, no.
- Anakin!</i>

688
00:59:33,652 --> 00:59:37,947
Don't go.

689
00:59:37,948 --> 00:59:41,117
I don't want to disturb you.

690
00:59:41,118 --> 00:59:45,955
Your presence is soothing.

691
00:59:45,956 --> 00:59:49,417
You had another nightmare last night.

692
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:52,294
Jedi don't have nightmares.

693
00:59:52,295 --> 00:59:57,295
I heard you.

694
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:04,261
I saw my mother.

695
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:08,769
She is suffering, Padmé.

696
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:13,770
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

697
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:26,912
She is in pain.

698
01:00:26,913 --> 01:00:30,416
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

699
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:35,337
but I have to go.

700
01:00:35,338 --> 01:00:39,091
I have to help her.

701
01:00:39,092 --> 01:00:41,135
<i>I'll</i> go with you.

702
01:00:41,136 --> 01:00:46,136
I'm sorry. I don't have a choice.

703
01:00:54,483 --> 01:00:56,984
Dad, look!

704
01:00:56,985 --> 01:01:01,985
Boba, get on board!

705
01:02:15,689 --> 01:02:20,689
Oh, not good.

706
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:28,529
Wait right there.

707
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:33,492
O key-okey.

708
01:04:33,493 --> 01:04:36,662
<i>Chut-chuz',</i> Watto.

709
01:04:36,663 --> 01:04:39,915
Let me help you with that.

710
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:43,419
What? What do you want?

711
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,922
Wait! You're a Jedi!

712
01:04:46,923 --> 01:04:51,923
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

713
01:04:54,764 --> 01:04:59,764
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

714
01:04:59,853 --> 01:05:03,397
Ani?

715
01:05:03,398 --> 01:05:08,110
Little Ani?

716
01:05:08,111 --> 01:05:11,864
Nahhh.

717
01:05:11,865 --> 01:05:15,993
You are Ani! It is you!

718
01:05:15,994 --> 01:05:20,080
You sure sprouted, huh?

719
01:05:20,081 --> 01:05:25,081
A Jedi! Whattaya know!

720
01:05:25,879 --> 01:05:29,882
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

721
01:05:29,883 --> 01:05:31,467
My mother.

722
01:05:31,468 --> 01:05:35,429
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

723
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:38,766
She's not mine-a no more-a. I sold her.

724
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:41,185
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

725
01:05:41,186 --> 01:05:45,397
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

726
01:05:45,398 --> 01:05:49,276
I sold her to a moisture farmer named Lars.

727
01:05:49,277 --> 01:05:51,403
At least I think it was Lars.

728
01:05:51,404 --> 01:05:55,032
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

729
01:05:55,033 --> 01:05:59,828
Can ya beat that, eh?

730
01:05:59,829 --> 01:06:02,873
Do you know where they are now?

731
01:06:02,874 --> 01:06:05,000
Long way from here.

732
01:06:05,001 --> 01:06:09,588
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

733
01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:13,258
I'd like to know.

734
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:17,095
Sure. Absolutely!

735
01:06:17,096 --> 01:06:22,096
Let's go look at my records, huh?

736
01:06:47,544 --> 01:06:50,712
Dad! I think we're being tracked!

737
01:06:50,713 --> 01:06:54,258
He must have put a homing device on our hull.

738
01:06:54,259 --> 01:06:56,635
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

739
01:06:56,636 --> 01:07:01,636
and we'll have a couple of surprises for him.

740
01:07:10,483 --> 01:07:12,568
Seismic charges!

741
01:07:12,569 --> 01:07:17,569
Stand by.

742
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:44,220
He doesn't seem to take a hint, this guy.

743
01:08:00,366 --> 01:08:05,366
Watch out!

744
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:26,141
Get him, Dad! Fire!

745
01:08:26,142 --> 01:08:31,142
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

746
01:08:48,748 --> 01:08:50,374
We got him!

747
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:55,375
We'll just have to finish him.

748
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:23,319
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

749
01:09:25,868 --> 01:09:30,868
Fire them now!

750
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:45,800
We won't be seeing him again.

751
01:10:17,795 --> 01:10:22,795
Well, R4, I think we've waited long enough.

752
01:10:40,443 --> 01:10:45,443
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

753
01:11:20,483 --> 01:11:25,483
Stay with the ship, R2.

754
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:41,044
Hello. How might I be of service? I am C-

755
01:11:41,045 --> 01:11:44,798
3P0?

756
01:11:44,799 --> 01:11:46,758
The maker!

757
01:11:46,759 --> 01:11:48,510
Master Ani!

758
01:11:48,511 --> 01:11:51,429
I knew you would return. I knew it!

759
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:53,265
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

760
01:11:53,266 --> 01:11:54,975
Hello, 3P0.

761
01:11:54,976 --> 01:11:58,979
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

762
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:02,774
I've come to see my mother.

763
01:12:02,775 --> 01:12:07,775
I think perhaps we'd better go indoors.

764
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:12,409
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

765
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:15,954
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

766
01:12:15,955 --> 01:12:17,706
Owen Lars.

767
01:12:17,707 --> 01:12:20,000
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

768
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:22,377
I'm Padmé.

769
01:12:22,378 --> 01:12:24,880
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

770
01:12:24,881 --> 01:12:28,884
I had a feeling you might show up someday.

771
01:12:28,885 --> 01:12:30,427
Is my mother here?

772
01:12:30,428 --> 01:12:33,180
No, she's not.

773
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:35,140
Cliegg Lars.

774
01:12:35,141 --> 01:12:38,059
Shmi is my wife.

775
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:43,060
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

776
01:12:48,821 --> 01:12:52,073
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

777
01:12:52,074 --> 01:12:55,994
A hunting party ofTusken Raiders.

778
01:12:55,995 --> 01:12:58,997
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

779
01:12:58,998 --> 01:13:03,084
to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporators.

780
01:13:03,085 --> 01:13:06,755
From the tracks, she was about halfway home...

781
01:13:06,756 --> 01:13:10,258
when they took her.

782
01:13:10,259 --> 01:13:12,427
Those Tuskens walk like men...

783
01:13:12,428 --> 01:13:17,428
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

784
01:13:18,768 --> 01:13:22,854
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

785
01:13:22,855 --> 01:13:27,108
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my <i>leg...</i>

786
01:13:27,109 --> 01:13:32,109
I just couldn't ride anymore until I heal.

787
01:13:33,324 --> 01:13:35,700
I don't want to give up on her...

788
01:13:35,701 --> 01:13:38,662
but she's been gone a month.

789
01:13:38,663 --> 01:13:43,663
There's little hope she's lasted this long.

790
01:13:46,337 --> 01:13:48,922
Where are you going?

791
01:13:48,923 --> 01:13:52,133
To find my mother.

792
01:13:52,134 --> 01:13:57,134
Your mother's dead, son. Accept it.

793
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:20,287
You're gonna have to stay here.

794
01:14:20,288 --> 01:14:25,288
These are good people, Padmé. You'll be safe.

795
01:14:35,511 --> 01:14:40,511
I won't be long.

796
01:16:26,539 --> 01:16:28,623
We must persuade the Commerce Guild...

797
01:16:28,624 --> 01:16:31,167
and the Corporate Alliance to sign the treaty.

798
01:16:31,168 --> 01:16:34,587
What about the senator from Naboo?

799
01:16:34,588 --> 01:16:37,298
Is she dead yet?

800
01:16:37,299 --> 01:16:41,386
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

801
01:16:41,387 --> 01:16:43,805
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

802
01:16:43,806 --> 01:16:46,975
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

803
01:16:46,976 --> 01:16:51,976
you'll have the finest army in the galaxy.

804
01:17:01,073 --> 01:17:03,074
As I explained to you earlier...

805
01:17:03,075 --> 01:17:06,411
lam quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...

806
01:17:06,412 --> 01:17:10,165
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

807
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:13,918
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

808
01:17:13,919 --> 01:17:18,919
The Techno Union army...

809
01:17:19,008 --> 01:17:22,635
is at your disposal, Count.

810
01:17:22,636 --> 01:17:26,264
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

811
01:17:26,265 --> 01:17:29,267
Good. Very good.

812
01:17:29,268 --> 01:17:33,021
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

813
01:17:33,022 --> 01:17:35,773
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

814
01:17:35,774 --> 01:17:39,652
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

815
01:17:39,653 --> 01:17:43,448
Thejedi will be overwhelmed.

816
01:17:43,449 --> 01:17:48,449
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

817
01:18:48,097 --> 01:18:52,392
MQIT]?

818
01:18:52,393 --> 01:18:55,728
Ani?

819
01:18:55,729 --> 01:18:58,773
Ani?

820
01:18:58,774 --> 01:19:00,525
LS it you?

821
01:19:00,526 --> 01:19:05,526
I'm here, Morn. You're safe.

822
01:19:10,452 --> 01:19:15,452
You look so handsome.

823
01:19:16,875 --> 01:19:19,085
My son.

824
01:19:19,086 --> 01:19:23,381
MY grown-up son.

825
01:19:23,382 --> 01:19:25,758
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

826
01:19:25,759 --> 01:19:30,430
I missed you.

827
01:19:30,431 --> 01:19:35,431
Now I am complete.

828
01:19:38,564 --> 01:19:42,775
I love y-

829
01:19:42,776 --> 01:19:45,987
Stay with me, Morn. Everything-

830
01:19:45,988 --> 01:19:49,616
I love-

831
01:19:49,617 --> 01:19:54,617
I love-

832
01:20:49,301 --> 01:20:51,719
<i>Anakin!</i>

833
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:56,720
<i>No!</i>

834
01:21:13,742 --> 01:21:16,327
What is it?

835
01:21:16,328 --> 01:21:20,373
Pain, suffering...

836
01:21:20,374 --> 01:21:25,374
death I feel.

837
01:21:26,922 --> 01:21:31,922
Something terrible has happened.

838
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:35,847
Young Skywalker is in pain...

839
01:21:35,848 --> 01:21:40,848
terrible pain.

840
01:21:42,521 --> 01:21:46,274
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

841
01:21:46,275 --> 01:21:50,570
Coruscant's too fa r.
R4, can you boost the power?

842
01:21:50,571 --> 01:21:55,450
We'll have to try something else.

843
01:21:55,451 --> 01:21:58,619
Maybe we can contact Anakin on Naboo.

844
01:21:58,620 --> 01:22:02,081
It's much closer.

845
01:22:02,082 --> 01:22:04,542
Anakin, do you copy?

846
01:22:04,543 --> 01:22:07,628
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

847
01:22:07,629 --> 01:22:11,507
He's not on Naboo, R4.

848
01:22:11,508 --> 01:22:16,508
I'm going to try and widen the range.

849
01:22:17,097 --> 01:22:22,097
I do hope nothings happened to him.

850
01:22:26,565 --> 01:22:28,566
That's Anakin's tracking signal, all right...

851
01:22:28,567 --> 01:22:32,612
but it's coming from Tatooine.

852
01:22:32,613 --> 01:22:35,323
What in the blazes is he doing there?

853
01:22:35,324 --> 01:22:40,324
I told him to stay on Naboo.

854
01:22:40,788 --> 01:22:42,580
We haven't got much time.

855
01:22:42,581 --> 01:22:44,749
Anakin, do you copy?

856
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:49,750
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

857
01:22:54,718 --> 01:22:58,679
<i>Retransmit this message-</i>

858
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:01,474
<i>Anakin, do you copy?</i>

859
01:23:01,475 --> 01:23:03,935
<i>My Ion g-range transmitter
has been knocked out.</i>

860
01:23:03,936 --> 01:23:08,936
<i>Retransmit this message to Coruscant.</i>

861
01:23:50,732 --> 01:23:52,942
I brought you something.

862
01:23:52,943 --> 01:23:56,737
Are you hungry?

863
01:23:56,738 --> 01:24:00,658
The shifter broke.

864
01:24:00,659 --> 01:24:05,659
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

865
01:24:05,914 --> 01:24:10,914
I'm good at fixing things. Always was.

866
01:24:11,753 --> 01:24:16,753
But I couldn't-

867
01:24:17,593 --> 01:24:22,593
Why'd she have to die?

868
01:24:23,098 --> 01:24:25,349
Why couldn't I save her?

869
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:30,104
I know I could have!

870
01:24:30,105 --> 01:24:34,442
Sometimes there are things no one can fix.

871
01:24:34,443 --> 01:24:39,443
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

872
01:24:39,865 --> 01:24:42,199
Someday I will be.

873
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,537
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

874
01:24:46,538 --> 01:24:49,290
I promise you.

875
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:54,291
I will even learn to stop people from dying.

876
01:24:55,339 --> 01:24:59,550
It's all Obi-Wan's fault! He's jealous!

877
01:24:59,551 --> 01:25:04,551
He's holding me back!

878
01:25:05,807 --> 01:25:10,807
What's wrong, Ani?

879
01:25:18,612 --> 01:25:22,323
I killed them.

880
01:25:22,324 --> 01:25:26,118
I killed them all.

881
01:25:26,119 --> 01:25:28,287
They're dead.

882
01:25:28,288 --> 01:25:32,458
Every single one of them.

883
01:25:32,459 --> 01:25:36,420
And not just the men...

884
01:25:36,421 --> 01:25:38,589
but the women...

885
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:41,467
and the children too.

886
01:25:41,468 --> 01:25:43,636
They're like animals...

887
01:25:43,637 --> 01:25:47,598
and I slaughtered them like animals!

888
01:25:47,599 --> 01:25:52,599
I hate them!

889
01:26:07,327 --> 01:26:09,537
To be angry is to be human.

890
01:26:09,538 --> 01:26:12,415
I'm ajedi.

891
01:26:12,416 --> 01:26:17,416
I know I'm better than this.

892
01:26:28,265 --> 01:26:33,060
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

893
01:26:33,061 --> 01:26:38,061
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

894
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:46,069
Good-bye, my darling wife.

895
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:52,200
And thank you.

896
01:27:16,313 --> 01:27:21,192
I wasn't strong enough to save you, Morn.

897
01:27:21,193 --> 01:27:26,193
I wasn't strong enough.

898
01:27:27,616 --> 01:27:32,616
But I promise I won't fail again.

899
01:27:41,838 --> 01:27:45,382
I miss you...

900
01:27:45,383 --> 01:27:50,383
so much.

901
01:27:54,267 --> 01:27:59,267
R2? What are you doing here?

902
01:27:59,731 --> 01:28:04,731
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

903
01:28:04,945 --> 01:28:09,945
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

904
01:28:10,325 --> 01:28:12,910
<i>Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.</i>

905
01:28:12,911 --> 01:28:17,911
<i>Retransmit this message to Coruscant.</i>

906
01:28:19,668 --> 01:28:22,002
<i>I have tracked the bounty hunter,
jango Fett...</i>

907
01:28:22,003 --> 01:28:24,255
<i>to the droid foundries on Geonosis.</i>

908
01:28:24,256 --> 01:28:28,008
<i>The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here...</i>

909
01:28:28,009 --> 01:28:30,136
<i>and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...</i>

910
01:28:30,137 --> 01:28:33,722
<i>is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.</i>

911
01:28:33,723 --> 01:28:35,975
<i>The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...</i>

912
01:28:35,976 --> 01:28:39,770
<i>have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming-</i>

913
01:28:39,771 --> 01:28:44,771
<i>Wait.</i>

914
01:28:52,659 --> 01:28:57,413
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

915
01:28:57,414 --> 01:29:00,583
I agree.

916
01:29:00,584 --> 01:29:02,960
<i>We will deal with Count Dooku.</i>

917
01:29:02,961 --> 01:29:06,630
<i>The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.</i>

918
01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:09,466
<i>Protect the senator at all costs.</i>

919
01:29:09,467 --> 01:29:13,429
<i>That is your first priority.</i>

920
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:15,514
Understood, Master.

921
01:29:15,515 --> 01:29:17,558
They'll never get there in time to save him.

922
01:29:17,559 --> 01:29:22,559
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

923
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:25,191
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

924
01:29:25,192 --> 01:29:29,069
If he's still alive.

925
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:31,822
Are you just gonna sit here and let him die?

926
01:29:31,823 --> 01:29:35,534
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

927
01:29:35,535 --> 01:29:39,330
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

928
01:29:39,331 --> 01:29:42,666
He gave you strict orders to protect me...

929
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:46,253
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

930
01:29:46,254 --> 01:29:51,254
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

931
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:58,720
I'm not worried, R2.
lt'sjust I've never flown before.

932
01:30:07,275 --> 01:30:10,361
The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war.
There can be no doubt of that.

933
01:30:10,362 --> 01:30:12,446
Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.

934
01:30:12,447 --> 01:30:15,950
The debate is over.

935
01:30:15,951 --> 01:30:19,036
Now we need that clone army.

936
01:30:19,037 --> 01:30:22,081
Unfortunately, the debate is not over.

937
01:30:22,082 --> 01:30:24,625
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

938
01:30:24,626 --> 01:30:26,502
before the separatists attack.

939
01:30:26,503 --> 01:30:28,462
This is a crisis.

940
01:30:28,463 --> 01:30:31,715
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

941
01:30:31,716 --> 01:30:35,135
He can then approve the creation of an army.

942
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:37,429
But what senator would have the courage...

943
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:40,099
to propose such a radical amendment?

944
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:45,100
If only Senator Amidala were here.

945
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:07,918
Traitor.

946
01:31:07,919 --> 01:31:11,171
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

947
01:31:11,172 --> 01:31:13,382
They have gone too far. This is madness.

948
01:31:13,383 --> 01:31:16,093
I thought you were the leader here, Dooku.

949
01:31:16,094 --> 01:31:18,804
This had nothing to do with me, I assure you.

950
01:31:18,805 --> 01:31:22,349
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

951
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:26,103
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

952
01:31:26,104 --> 01:31:30,024
May I ask why ajedi knight...

953
01:31:30,025 --> 01:31:32,568
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

954
01:31:32,569 --> 01:31:35,529
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named jango Fett.

955
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:37,323
Do you know him?

956
01:31:37,324 --> 01:31:40,200
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

957
01:31:40,201 --> 01:31:42,286
The Geonosians don't trust them.

958
01:31:42,287 --> 01:31:46,290
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

959
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:51,128
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

960
01:31:51,129 --> 01:31:56,129
Qui-Gon always spoke very highly of you.

961
01:31:58,470 --> 01:32:01,972
I wish he were still alive.

962
01:32:01,973 --> 01:32:05,559
I could use his help right now.

963
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:09,813
Qui-Gon jinn would neverjoin you.

964
01:32:09,814 --> 01:32:12,816
Don't be so sure, my youngjedi.

965
01:32:12,817 --> 01:32:15,486
You forget that he was once my apprentice...

966
01:32:15,487 --> 01:32:18,489
just as you were once his.

967
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:20,783
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

968
01:32:20,784 --> 01:32:23,952
but he wouldn't have gone along with
it if he had learned the truth as I have.

969
01:32:23,953 --> 01:32:28,953
- The truth?
- The truth.

970
01:32:33,088 --> 01:32:35,923
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

971
01:32:35,924 --> 01:32:38,258
of the dark lord of the Sith?

972
01:32:38,259 --> 01:32:41,678
No, that's not possible.
Thejedi would be aware of it.

973
01:32:41,679 --> 01:32:46,679
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

974
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:49,728
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

975
01:32:49,729 --> 01:32:54,729
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

976
01:32:55,276 --> 01:32:57,111
I don't believe you.

977
01:32:57,112 --> 01:32:59,613
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

978
01:32:59,614 --> 01:33:03,700
was once in league with this Darth Sidious...

979
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:07,663
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

980
01:33:07,664 --> 01:33:12,664
He came to me for help. He told me everything.

981
01:33:12,794 --> 01:33:15,879
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

982
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:20,880
and together we will destroy the Sith!

983
01:33:21,636 --> 01:33:26,636
I will neverjoin you, Dooku.

984
01:33:33,398 --> 01:33:38,398
It may be difficult to secure your release.

985
01:33:44,075 --> 01:33:49,075
It's-a clear desa separatists made a pact
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

986
01:33:50,081 --> 01:33:54,501
Senators, “dellow fela gates”:

987
01:33:54,502 --> 01:33:58,630
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

988
01:33:58,631 --> 01:34:02,426
mesa propose that the senate...

989
01:34:02,427 --> 01:34:06,180
give immediately emergency powers...

990
01:34:06,181 --> 01:34:11,181
to the supreme chancellor.

991
01:34:12,896 --> 01:34:17,896
Palpatine! Palpatine!

992
01:34:18,109 --> 01:34:23,030
Order! We shall have order!

993
01:34:23,031 --> 01:34:26,492
It is with great reluctance...

994
01:34:26,493 --> 01:34:29,786
that I have agreed to this calling.

995
01:34:29,787 --> 01:34:34,787
I love democracy. I love the Republic.

996
01:34:34,792 --> 01:34:37,085
The power you give me...

997
01:34:37,086 --> 01:34:42,086
I will lay down when this crisis has abated.

998
01:34:46,095 --> 01:34:51,016
And as my first act with this new authority...

999
01:34:51,017 --> 01:34:55,521
I will create a grand army of the Republic...

1000
01:34:55,522 --> 01:35:00,522
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1001
01:35:00,652 --> 01:35:05,652
It is done, then.

1002
01:35:07,742 --> 01:35:11,620
I will take whatjedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1003
01:35:11,621 --> 01:35:16,542
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1004
01:35:16,543 --> 01:35:21,543
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1005
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,068
See those columns of steam straight ahead?

1006
01:35:43,069 --> 01:35:45,946
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1007
01:35:45,947 --> 01:35:50,947
That'll do.

1008
01:35:57,292 --> 01:36:00,460
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

1009
01:36:00,461 --> 01:36:02,629
I'm not interested in getting into a war here.

1010
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:04,423
As a member of the senate...

1011
01:36:04,424 --> 01:36:07,884
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1012
01:36:07,885 --> 01:36:09,970
Don't worry.

1013
01:36:09,971 --> 01:36:14,971
I've given up trying to argue with you.

1014
01:36:17,145 --> 01:36:20,480
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

1015
01:36:20,481 --> 01:36:22,482
they would have asked for it.

1016
01:36:22,483 --> 01:36:27,483
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behavior.

1017
01:36:51,512 --> 01:36:56,512
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

1018
01:36:56,768 --> 01:37:01,768
I am programmed to understand humans!

1019
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:04,941
“What does that mean?”

1020
01:37:04,942 --> 01:37:07,778
That means I am in charge here!

1021
01:37:07,779 --> 01:37:09,529
Where are you going now?

1022
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:13,367
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

1023
01:37:13,368 --> 01:37:17,204
Idiot!

1024
01:37:17,205 --> 01:37:19,831
Please wait.

1025
01:37:19,832 --> 01:37:24,832
Do you know where you're going?

1026
01:37:34,263 --> 01:37:39,263
Wait.

1027
01:38:51,632 --> 01:38:53,633
Oh, my goodness!

1028
01:38:53,634 --> 01:38:56,136
Shut me down!

1029
01:38:56,137 --> 01:38:58,388
Machines making machines.

1030
01:38:58,389 --> 01:39:00,807
How perverse!

1031
01:39:00,808 --> 01:39:02,350
Calm down, R2!

1032
01:39:02,351 --> 01:39:04,936
I almost fell.

1033
01:39:04,937 --> 01:39:08,774
You'll get your chance-

1034
01:39:08,775 --> 01:39:11,818
I'm scrap.

1035
01:39:11,819 --> 01:39:15,989
It's a nightmare!

1036
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:19,493
I want to go home!

1037
01:39:19,494 --> 01:39:24,494
What did I do to deserve this?

1038
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:03,662
I wonder what happened to poor little R2.

1039
01:40:03,663 --> 01:40:07,374
He's always getting himself into trouble.

1040
01:40:07,375 --> 01:40:12,375
Oh, no!

1041
01:40:18,386 --> 01:40:23,386
Uh-oh.

1042
01:40:23,683 --> 01:40:28,683
I'm so confused.

1043
01:42:21,634 --> 01:42:23,677
Not again!

1044
01:42:23,678 --> 01:42:28,678
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1045
01:42:34,730 --> 01:42:36,356
Don't move,jedi!

1046
01:42:36,357 --> 01:42:41,357
Take him away.

1047
01:42:56,877 --> 01:43:00,463
Don't be afraid.

1048
01:43:00,464 --> 01:43:05,464
I'm not afraid to die.

1049
01:43:07,304 --> 01:43:12,304
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1050
01:43:12,727 --> 01:43:16,646
What are you talking about?

1051
01:43:16,647 --> 01:43:21,647
I love you.

1052
01:43:22,570 --> 01:43:27,570
You love me?

1053
01:43:29,035 --> 01:43:34,035
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...

1054
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:37,917
that we would be forced to live a lie...

1055
01:43:37,918 --> 01:43:41,588
and that it would destroy our lives.

1056
01:43:41,589 --> 01:43:46,589
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1057
01:43:49,096 --> 01:43:52,057
I truly...

1058
01:43:52,058 --> 01:43:55,685
deeply love you...

1059
01:43:55,686 --> 01:44:00,686
and before we die, I want you to know.

1060
01:44:55,412 --> 01:44:58,164
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1061
01:44:58,165 --> 01:45:03,165
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1062
01:45:03,587 --> 01:45:06,422
Then we decided to come and rescue you.

1063
01:45:06,423 --> 01:45:11,423
Good job.

1064
01:45:20,312 --> 01:45:25,312
Settle down. Settle down.

1065
01:45:27,361 --> 01:45:32,361
Let the executions begin.

1066
01:46:03,856 --> 01:46:08,856
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1067
01:46:32,343 --> 01:46:34,969
- Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1068
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:39,970
She seems to be on top of things.

1069
01:47:40,077 --> 01:47:41,911
She can't do that!

1070
01:47:41,912 --> 01:47:46,912
Shoot her... or something!

1071
01:49:02,659 --> 01:49:07,659
Jump!

1072
01:49:28,185 --> 01:49:31,354
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1073
01:49:31,355 --> 01:49:33,606
Jango! Finish her off!

1074
01:49:33,607 --> 01:49:38,607
Patience, Viceroy, patience. She will die.

1075
01:50:07,641 --> 01:50:09,267
Master Windu.

1076
01:50:09,268 --> 01:50:11,686
How pleasant of you to join us.

1077
01:50:11,687 --> 01:50:16,687
This party's over.

1078
01:50:27,286 --> 01:50:29,662
Brave...

1079
01:50:29,663 --> 01:50:32,123
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1080
01:50:32,124 --> 01:50:34,083
You're impossibly outnumbered.

1081
01:50:34,084 --> 01:50:36,502
I don't think so.

1082
01:50:36,503 --> 01:50:41,503
We'll see.

1083
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:21,710
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1084
01:51:58,961 --> 01:52:01,629
What's all this noise? A battle!

1085
01:52:01,630 --> 01:52:03,923
There's been some terrible mistake!

1086
01:52:03,924 --> 01:52:08,924
I'm programmed for etiquette, not destruction!

1087
01:53:34,181 --> 01:53:36,140
Die, Jedi dog-S!

1088
01:53:36,141 --> 01:53:41,141
Oh! What did I say?

1089
01:53:46,985 --> 01:53:51,985
Oh, dear. I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1090
01:53:55,952 --> 01:54:00,952
Excuse me. I'm trapped. I can't get up.

1091
01:54:12,803 --> 01:54:17,803
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1092
01:54:21,978 --> 01:54:26,978
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

1093
01:54:42,124 --> 01:54:47,124
R2, what are you doing here?

1094
01:54:47,587 --> 01:54:49,046
What are you doing?

1095
01:54:49,047 --> 01:54:51,757
Stop that! You're going to strain something.

1096
01:54:51,758 --> 01:54:55,845
My neck!

1097
01:54:55,846 --> 01:55:00,846
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!

1098
01:55:03,895 --> 01:55:08,895
I'm quite beside myself.

1099
01:55:14,656 --> 01:55:19,326
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1100
01:55:19,327 --> 01:55:24,327
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1101
01:55:44,603 --> 01:55:46,353
Master Windu...

1102
01:55:46,354 --> 01:55:49,732
you have fought gallantly...

1103
01:55:49,733 --> 01:55:54,733
worthy of recognition
in the archives of thejedi order.

1104
01:55:55,739 --> 01:55:57,990
<i>Now...</i>

1105
01:55:57,991 --> 01:56:00,534
it is finished.

1106
01:56:00,535 --> 01:56:02,620
Surrender...

1107
01:56:02,621 --> 01:56:06,081
and your lives will be spared.

1108
01:56:06,082 --> 01:56:09,418
We will not be hostages to be bartered, Dooku!

1109
01:56:09,419 --> 01:56:11,921
<i>Then...</i>

1110
01:56:11,922 --> 01:56:16,922
I'm sorry, old friend.

1111
01:56:24,684 --> 01:56:29,684
Look!

1112
01:56:37,864 --> 01:56:42,864
Around the survivors a perimeter create.

1113
01:57:38,592 --> 01:57:43,592
I've had the most peculiar dream!

1114
01:57:52,272 --> 01:57:54,356
If Dooku escapes...

1115
01:57:54,357 --> 01:57:59,357
rally more systems to his cause he will.

1116
01:58:02,616 --> 01:58:07,616
Hold on!

1117
01:58:08,997 --> 01:58:13,997
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1118
01:58:17,297 --> 01:58:22,297
Good call, my young Padawan.

1119
01:58:33,605 --> 01:58:36,231
Thejedi have amassed a huge army.

1120
01:58:36,232 --> 01:58:38,484
That doesn't seem possible.

1121
01:58:38,485 --> 01:58:41,195
How could thejedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1122
01:58:41,196 --> 01:58:44,740
We must send all available droids into battle.

1123
01:58:44,741 --> 01:58:47,409
There are too many.

1124
01:58:47,410 --> 01:58:52,410
Our communications have been jammed.

1125
01:58:58,338 --> 01:59:01,632
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1126
01:59:01,633 --> 01:59:06,633
Yes, sir.

1127
01:59:11,017 --> 01:59:16,017
Sir. I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1128
01:59:16,022 --> 01:59:21,022
To the forward command center take me.

1129
01:59:42,632 --> 01:59:47,632
Attack those Federation starships, quickly!

1130
01:59:56,354 --> 02:00:00,274
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1131
02:00:00,275 --> 02:00:02,735
Very good.

1132
02:00:02,736 --> 02:00:07,736
Very good.

1133
02:00:32,599 --> 02:00:36,268
This is not looking good at all!

1134
02:00:36,269 --> 02:00:41,269
We must get the starships back into space.

1135
02:00:42,275 --> 02:00:46,320
We have to order a retreat.

1136
02:00:46,321 --> 02:00:48,781
My master will never allow the Republic...

1137
02:00:48,782 --> 02:00:51,241
to get away with this treachery.

1138
02:00:51,242 --> 02:00:55,245
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

1139
02:00:55,246 --> 02:01:00,246
Thejedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1140
02:01:01,044 --> 02:01:06,044
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

1141
02:01:09,469 --> 02:01:12,888
I will take the designs with me to Coruscant.

1142
02:01:12,889 --> 02:01:17,889
They will be much safer there with my master.

1143
02:02:10,238 --> 02:02:15,117
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1144
02:02:15,118 --> 02:02:17,077
Yes, sir.

1145
02:02:17,078 --> 02:02:22,078
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

1146
02:03:00,663 --> 02:03:05,626
Look over there!

1147
02:03:05,627 --> 02:03:08,128
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1148
02:03:08,129 --> 02:03:10,130
We're out of rockets, sir.

1149
02:03:10,131 --> 02:03:13,091
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1150
02:03:13,092 --> 02:03:18,092
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1151
02:03:40,620 --> 02:03:43,330
Put the ship down!

1152
02:03:43,331 --> 02:03:45,332
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

1153
02:03:45,333 --> 02:03:50,333
Follow that speeder!

1154
02:03:53,174 --> 02:03:55,634
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1155
02:03:55,635 --> 02:03:59,221
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1156
02:03:59,222 --> 02:04:02,349
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1157
02:04:02,350 --> 02:04:04,726
You will be expelled from thejedi order!

1158
02:04:04,727 --> 02:04:08,063
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1159
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:13,064
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1160
02:04:15,321 --> 02:04:20,321
She would do her duty.

1161
02:04:26,332 --> 02:04:28,417
The droid army is in full retreat.

1162
02:04:28,418 --> 02:04:33,418
Well done, Commander. Bring me a ship.

1163
02:04:58,740 --> 02:05:01,867
You're gonna pay for all thejedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1164
02:05:01,868 --> 02:05:03,660
We'll take him together.

1165
02:05:03,661 --> 02:05:08,661
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

1166
02:05:13,713 --> 02:05:17,382
As you see, myjedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1167
02:05:17,383 --> 02:05:22,383
Now... back down.

1168
02:05:25,183 --> 02:05:30,183
I don't think so.

1169
02:05:39,364 --> 02:05:42,657
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1170
02:05:42,658 --> 02:05:47,658
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1171
02:05:48,122 --> 02:05:53,122
Surely you can do better.

1172
02:06:01,719 --> 02:06:03,720
Are you all right?

1173
02:06:03,721 --> 02:06:06,014
Uh-huh.

1174
02:06:06,015 --> 02:06:08,392
We'd better get back
to the forward command center.

1175
02:06:08,393 --> 02:06:10,102
No.

1176
02:06:10,103 --> 02:06:13,730
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1177
02:06:13,731 --> 02:06:15,774
Get a transport. Hurry!

1178
02:06:15,775 --> 02:06:20,775
Right away.

1179
02:06:42,009 --> 02:06:45,137
Brave of you, boy.

1180
02:06:45,138 --> 02:06:47,472
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1181
02:06:47,473 --> 02:06:52,473
I am a slow learner.

1182
02:07:51,537 --> 02:07:53,413
Master Yoda.

1183
02:07:53,414 --> 02:07:56,583
Count Dooku.

1184
02:07:56,584 --> 02:08:01,584
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1185
02:08:31,077 --> 02:08:34,579
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1186
02:08:34,580 --> 02:08:37,874
The dark side I sense in you.

1187
02:08:37,875 --> 02:08:41,753
I've become more powerful than anyjedi.

1188
02:08:41,754 --> 02:08:46,754
Even you.

1189
02:08:58,604 --> 02:09:01,982
Much to learn you still have.

1190
02:09:01,983 --> 02:09:05,277
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

1191
02:09:05,278 --> 02:09:09,447
by our knowledge of the Force...

1192
02:09:09,448 --> 02:09:14,448
but by our skills with a lightsaber.

1193
02:09:53,659 --> 02:09:57,287
Fought well you have, my old Padawan.

1194
02:09:57,288 --> 02:10:02,288
This is just the beginning.

1195
02:12:32,067 --> 02:12:34,819
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1196
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:39,532
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1197
02:12:39,533 --> 02:12:42,368
You have done well.

1198
02:12:42,369 --> 02:12:45,872
I have good news for you, my lord.

1199
02:12:45,873 --> 02:12:49,459
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1200
02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:54,460
Everything is going as planned.

1201
02:13:02,264 --> 02:13:06,768
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1202
02:13:06,769 --> 02:13:09,103
It doesn't feel right.

1203
02:13:09,104 --> 02:13:13,691
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1204
02:13:13,692 --> 02:13:15,235
Lies, deceit...

1205
02:13:15,236 --> 02:13:19,113
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1206
02:13:19,114 --> 02:13:20,657
Nevertheless...

1207
02:13:20,658 --> 02:13:23,785
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

1208
02:13:23,786 --> 02:13:26,955
I agree.

1209
02:13:26,956 --> 02:13:28,957
Where is your apprentice?

1210
02:13:28,958 --> 02:13:33,958
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1211
02:13:34,630 --> 02:13:38,383
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1212
02:13:38,384 --> 02:13:41,219
Victory?

1213
02:13:41,220 --> 02:13:43,805
Victory, you Say?

1214
02:13:43,806 --> 02:13:48,806
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

1215
02:13:48,936 --> 02:13:53,731
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

1216
02:13:53,732 --> 02:13:58,732
Begun the Clone War has.
