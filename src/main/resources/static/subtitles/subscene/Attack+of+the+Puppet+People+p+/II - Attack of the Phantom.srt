1
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:29,876
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

2
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,109
Very good, Lieutenant.

3
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:49,658
Cordé.

4
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,969
Milady, I'm so sorry.

5
00:03:54,871 --> 00:03:56,964
I've failed you, Senator.

6
00:03:57,073 --> 00:03:58,199
No.

7
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:03,868
Milady, you're still in danger here.

8
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:13,618
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

9
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:17,552
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

10
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:21,522
Senator Amidala, please.

11
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:36,203
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

12
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:39,846
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

13
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,780
If they do break away...

14
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:45,149
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

15
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:47,313
be split in two.

16
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:50,392
My negotiations will not fail.

17
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:53,058
If they do, you must realize...

18
00:04:53,196 --> 00:04:55,255
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

19
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,895
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

20
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:02,064
Master Yoda...

21
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,701
do you think it will
really come to war?

22
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,510
The dark side clouds everything.

23
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:16,574
Impossible to see the future is.

24
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:21,652
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honor.

25
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:22,746
Good.

26
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:27,455
Send them in.

27
00:05:27,563 --> 00:05:30,396
We will discuss this matter later.

28
00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:38,472
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform...

29
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:40,474
terrible.

30
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,210
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

31
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:47,912
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

32
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,881
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

33
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:54,893
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

34
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:57,987
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

35
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:01,556
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

36
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:04,228
But for certain, Senator...

37
00:06:04,337 --> 00:06:08,171
in grave danger you are.

38
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:12,243
Master Jedi, may I suggest...

39
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:16,441
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

40
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,846
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe...

41
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:21,287
The situation is that serious?

42
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:23,349
No, but I do, Senator.

43
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,793
I realize all too well
that additional security...

44
00:06:26,897 --> 00:06:30,389
might be disruptive for you...

45
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,162
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

46
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:37,303
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

47
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:41,341
Do it for me, milady. Please?

48
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:43,849
The thought of losing you...

49
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:47,646
is unbearable.

50
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:51,720
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

51
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:54,056
Thank you, Master Windu.

52
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:06,770
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

53
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:10,986
Relax.
Take a deep breath.

54
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,595
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

55
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:29,193
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

56
00:07:30,572 --> 00:07:32,005
Ani?

57
00:07:32,107 --> 00:07:35,406
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

58
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,911
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

59
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:40,709
Well, for a senator, I mean.

60
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,748
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

61
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,328
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

62
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:51,488
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

63
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:53,725
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

64
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:56,598
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

65
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:59,399
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

66
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:01,736
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

67
00:08:01,842 --> 00:08:05,676
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

68
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,179
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

69
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:10,112
I promise you.

70
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:12,947
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

71
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:16,022
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

72
00:08:17,408 --> 00:08:20,673
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

73
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,172
And you will learn
your place, young one.

74
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:31,712
Perhaps with merely your presence...

75
00:08:31,822 --> 00:08:34,757
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

76
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:37,453
Now, if you'll excuse me...

77
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:39,390
I will retire.

78
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:42,824
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

79
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:45,094
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

80
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:47,363
and I'll be in the control center
downstairs.

81
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:52,237
She hardly even
recognized me, Jar Jar.

82
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:55,153
She's forgotten me completely.

83
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:59,325
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

84
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:02,097
She was pleased to see us.

85
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:04,166
Now, let's check the security.

86
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:15,270
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

87
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:17,642
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

88
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:19,772
My client is getting impatient.

89
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:22,715
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

90
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:26,255
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

91
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:32,026
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

92
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:34,062
No assassin would try that way.

93
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,190
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

94
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:41,567
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

95
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:45,203
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

96
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:47,967
I don't think she liked me
watching her.

97
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:49,977
What is she thinking?

98
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,071
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

99
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:55,810
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

100
00:09:55,918 --> 00:10:00,252
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

101
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:04,485
You're using her as bait.

102
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:06,653
It was her idea.

103
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:09,322
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

104
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:12,401
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

105
00:10:12,502 --> 00:10:14,766
Trust me.

106
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:16,771
It's too risky.

107
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:20,470
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

108
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:22,902
And yours are?

109
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:26,979
Possibly.

110
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,298
You look tired.

111
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:46,024
I don't sleep well anymore.

112
00:10:46,135 --> 00:10:48,626
Because of your mother?

113
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:56,607
I don't know
why I keep dreaming about her.

114
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:01,282
Dreams pass in time.

115
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:05,412
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

116
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:09,719
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.

117
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:12,293
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

118
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:14,727
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order...

119
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,889
a commitment not easily broken.

120
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:19,763
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

121
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:22,463
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

122
00:11:22,572 --> 00:11:24,699
It is my experience
that senators focus...

123
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,707
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

124
00:11:28,444 --> 00:11:32,005
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

125
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:34,309
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

126
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:37,215
At least not
on the economics of politics.

127
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:35,572
And besides, you're generalizing.

128
00:12:35,678 --> 00:12:37,737
The chancellor doesn't appear
to be corrupt.

129
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:39,508
Palpatine is a politician.

130
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:42,243
I have observed
that he is very clever...

131
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:46,344
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

132
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:48,320
I think he's a good man...

133
00:12:48,424 --> 00:12:50,324
I sense it too.

134
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:09,504
Stay here!

135
00:13:11,947 --> 00:13:13,847
Are you all right, milady?

136
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,855
What took you so long?

137
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,211
Anakin!

138
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:09,150
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

139
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:11,680
Use the Force. Think.

140
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,998
I try, Master.

141
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:16,895
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

142
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:18,698
Don't say that, Master.

143
00:15:18,804 --> 00:15:20,863
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

144
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:22,838
Then why don't you listen to me?

145
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:24,534
I am trying.

146
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:38,590
Can you see him?

147
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:40,659
I think he is a she...

148
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,422
and I think she is a changeling.

149
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,658
In that case, be extra careful.

150
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:51,169
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

151
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,737
For a drink.

152
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:09,343
- You wanna buy some death sticks?
- You don't want to sell me death sticks.

153
00:16:09,455 --> 00:16:11,389
I don't want to
sell you death sticks.

154
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,583
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

155
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:16,025
I want to go home
and rethink my life.

156
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,507
Easy.

157
00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:07,738
Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

158
00:17:14,386 --> 00:17:17,014
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

159
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,419
It was a senator from Naboo.

160
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:22,221
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

161
00:17:23,362 --> 00:17:25,592
Who hired you? Tell us.

162
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,090
Tell us now!

163
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:31,900
It was a bounty hunter called...

164
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:41,669
Kamino... system.

165
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:52,588
Toxic dart.

166
00:18:03,002 --> 00:18:07,063
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

167
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:10,631
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

168
00:18:10,743 --> 00:18:14,645
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

169
00:18:14,747 --> 00:18:17,648
Handle that your Padawan will.

170
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:23,048
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

171
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:26,887
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

172
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:28,984
Travel as refugees.

173
00:18:38,689 --> 00:18:40,623
I will talk with her.

174
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:43,852
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

175
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:46,122
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

176
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,289
Thank you, Your Excellency.

177
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:51,765
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

178
00:18:52,836 --> 00:18:54,861
Your patience has paid off.

179
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,303
Your guidance
more than my patience.

180
00:18:58,475 --> 00:19:00,807
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

181
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:05,137
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

182
00:19:07,084 --> 00:19:09,177
Then you will be invincible.

183
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:14,222
I have said it many times:

184
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:17,088
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

185
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:19,094
Thank you, Your Excellency.

186
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:22,893
I see you becoming the greatest
of all the Jedi, Anakin...

187
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,525
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.

188
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:33,615
I'm taking
an extended leave of absence.

189
00:19:33,718 --> 00:19:36,846
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

190
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:38,569
Of course.

191
00:19:38,574 --> 00:19:40,132
Milady.

192
00:19:44,746 --> 00:19:46,611
I do not like this idea of hiding.

193
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,811
Don't worry.

194
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:51,112
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

195
00:19:51,253 --> 00:19:53,915
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

196
00:19:54,022 --> 00:19:56,923
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

197
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:59,084
to not be here
when its fate is decided.

198
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:01,253
Sometimes we must
let go of our pride...

199
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:03,923
and do what is requested of us.

200
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:06,466
Anakin, you've grown up.

201
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,771
Master Obi-Wan manages
not to see it.

202
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:15,890
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

203
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:17,984
It's the only way we grow.

204
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:21,530
I know.

205
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,491
Anakin...

206
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:29,396
don't try to grow up too fast.

207
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:31,498
But I am grown up.

208
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,579
You said it yourself.

209
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:38,807
Please don't look at me like that.

210
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:41,274
Why not?

211
00:20:41,385 --> 00:20:43,512
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

212
00:20:45,523 --> 00:20:47,491
Sorry, milady.

213
00:21:01,773 --> 00:21:04,537
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

214
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:07,703
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

215
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:09,781
He'll be safe with me.

216
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:15,846
You'll be fine.

217
00:21:15,954 --> 00:21:19,151
It's not me, milady.
I worry about you.

218
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:21,589
What if they realize
you've left the capital?

219
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:26,060
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

220
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:28,064
Anakin...

221
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,260
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

222
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:33,303
Yes, Master.

223
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:36,998
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

224
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:39,043
You'll be back here in no time.

225
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:42,375
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, master Jedi.

226
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:44,381
- It's time to go.
- I know.

227
00:21:44,483 --> 00:21:47,008
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

228
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,144
May the Force be with you, Master.

229
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:02,497
Suddenly I'm afraid.

230
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:06,230
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

231
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,767
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

232
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:18,673
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

233
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:22,909
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

234
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,036
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

235
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:43,269
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

236
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:46,677
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

237
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:49,045
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

238
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,450
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

239
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:55,816
It should appear in
this quadrant here...

240
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,186
just south of the Rishi Maze.

241
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:07,969
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

242
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:09,768
doesn't exist.

243
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:13,367
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

244
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:16,538
If an item does not appear
in our records...

245
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:18,707
it does not exist.

246
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:42,735
Hey, you! No droids!

247
00:23:43,108 --> 00:23:45,008
Get outta here!

248
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,715
Thank you, R2.

249
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:57,420
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi...

250
00:23:57,522 --> 00:24:01,424
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

251
00:24:01,526 --> 00:24:03,653
Or be with the people that I love.

252
00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:06,621
Are you allowed to love?

253
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:08,562
I thought that was forbidden
for a Jedi.

254
00:24:12,103 --> 00:24:14,401
Attachment is forbidden.

255
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:18,107
Possession is forbidden.

256
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:21,804
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

257
00:24:21,913 --> 00:24:24,347
is central to a Jedi's life.

258
00:24:26,818 --> 00:24:31,187
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

259
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:33,223
You've changed so much.

260
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:35,885
You haven't changed a bit.

261
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:38,861
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

262
00:24:50,051 --> 00:24:53,251
It appears someone doesn't want
us to know about this Kamino system.

263
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:54,701
Which means that there's something

264
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,826
happening in that system
that we should know about.

265
00:24:57,751 --> 00:25:00,651
Master, do you think a Jedi
could have erased those files?

266
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:02,376
I hope not.

267
00:25:02,777 --> 00:25:06,200
This disturbance in the Force is making
it hard to get a sense of things.

268
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:12,100
I am concerned for my Padawan.

269
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:14,124
He is not ready to be on his own.

270
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,148
If the prophecy is true

271
00:25:18,172 --> 00:25:20,872
he is the one who will
bring balance to the Force.

272
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,396
But he's still has much to learn.

273
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,420
His skills have made him, well

274
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:26,844
arrogant.

275
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:29,068
The boy was too old to start his training.

276
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:33,600
Master, he should not have
been given this assignment.

277
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:37,200
I fear Anakin will not be able
to protect the Senator.

278
00:25:37,224 --> 00:25:38,224
Why?

279
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:41,548
He has an emotional
connection with her.

280
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:43,872
It's been there since he was a boy.

281
00:25:43,896 --> 00:25:45,896
Now he's confused...

282
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,020
Distracted.

283
00:25:50,344 --> 00:25:53,844
Obi-Wan, you must have faith
that he will choose the right path.

284
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,368
We're here.

285
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,916
This is my house.

286
00:26:27,964 --> 00:26:29,964
Ryoo!!

287
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,704
Padmé.

288
00:26:56,228 --> 00:26:58,228
Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.

289
00:26:59,276 --> 00:27:01,276
-Hello.
-Hello.

290
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,600
And this is my mother.

291
00:27:02,624 --> 00:27:04,424
Hello.
You made it just in time for dinner.

292
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:06,772
I hope you're hungry, Anakin.

293
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:07,696
A little.

294
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,520
He's being polite, Mom.
We're starving.

295
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:12,044
Well, you've come to the right
place at the right time.

296
00:27:13,092 --> 00:27:16,392
Honey, it's so good to see
you safe. We were so worried.

297
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:17,416
Dear...

298
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,540
I know, I know... but I had
to say it. Now it's done.

299
00:27:23,564 --> 00:27:27,064
Did you know, Anakin, you're the first
boyfriend my sister's ever brought home?

300
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,112
He's not my boyfriend.

301
00:27:29,636 --> 00:27:32,236
He's a Jedi assigned to me
by the Senate to protect me.

302
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,960
A body guard?!

303
00:27:34,684 --> 00:27:37,184
Oh, Padmé! They didn't
tell us it was that serious.

304
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:39,208
It's not, I promise.

305
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:41,232
I'm not in any danger, mom.

306
00:27:41,756 --> 00:27:43,356
Is she?

307
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,280
Yes.

308
00:27:45,804 --> 00:27:47,804
I'm afraid she is.

309
00:27:50,328 --> 00:27:52,328
Why haven't you told us about him?

310
00:27:52,352 --> 00:27:55,352
What's there to talk about?
He's just a boy.

311
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:56,876
A boy?

312
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,400
Have you seen the way he looks at you?

313
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:01,224
Sola, stop it!

314
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:03,448
Anakin and I are...
friends.

315
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:06,272
Our relationship is strictly professional.

316
00:28:26,408 --> 00:28:29,138
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

317
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:31,076
Our missing planet Kamino.

318
00:29:09,251 --> 00:29:11,116
Master Jedi.

319
00:29:12,254 --> 00:29:14,586
The prime minister is expecting you.

320
00:29:15,825 --> 00:29:18,225
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

321
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:21,392
He is anxious to meet you.

322
00:29:21,497 --> 00:29:23,692
After all these years...

323
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:27,394
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

324
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:29,733
Now, please, this way.

325
00:29:42,518 --> 00:29:45,009
May I present Lama Su...

326
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,145
prime minister of Kamino.

327
00:29:48,891 --> 00:29:50,950
And this is master Jedi...

328
00:29:51,193 --> 00:29:53,093
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

329
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:56,494
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

330
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:59,935
Please.

331
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,765
And now to business.

332
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:07,809
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

333
00:30:09,485 --> 00:30:12,613
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

334
00:30:12,722 --> 00:30:16,089
that his order will be met on time.

335
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:18,160
I'm sorry. Master...

336
00:30:19,328 --> 00:30:21,888
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

337
00:30:21,998 --> 00:30:25,126
a leading member of theJedi Council,
is he not?

338
00:30:25,234 --> 00:30:29,034
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

339
00:30:30,673 --> 00:30:33,005
I'm so sorry to hear that.

340
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:37,409
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

341
00:30:37,513 --> 00:30:39,845
The army?

342
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:43,612
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

343
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,914
one of the finest we've ever created.

344
00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:48,023
Tell me, Prime Minister...

345
00:30:48,124 --> 00:30:50,615
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

346
00:30:50,726 --> 00:30:52,853
did he say who it was for?

347
00:30:52,962 --> 00:30:54,987
Of course he did.

348
00:30:55,097 --> 00:30:57,759
This army is for the Republic.

349
00:30:58,634 --> 00:31:02,229
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

350
00:31:03,806 --> 00:31:05,865
That's why I'm here.

351
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:28,356
We used to come here
for school retreat.

352
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:32,192
We would swim
to that island every day.

353
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:35,471
I love the water.

354
00:32:26,998 --> 00:32:28,625
Very impressive.

355
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:30,860
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

356
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:36,496
Clones can think creatively.

357
00:32:36,607 --> 00:32:40,509
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

358
00:32:44,282 --> 00:32:49,686
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programs.

359
00:32:49,787 --> 00:32:53,154
This group was created
about five years ago.

360
00:32:53,257 --> 00:32:55,316
You mentioned growth acceleration.

361
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:57,360
Oh, yes, it's essential.

362
00:32:57,462 --> 00:33:00,488
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

363
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:03,192
Now we can do it in half the time.

364
00:33:03,301 --> 00:33:05,963
I see.

365
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,970
They are totally obedient...

366
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:10,768
taking any order without question.

367
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,934
We modified their genetic structure...

368
00:33:13,044 --> 00:33:16,275
to make them less independent
than the original host.

369
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,905
And who was the original host?

370
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,109
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

371
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,813
And where is this bounty hunter now?

372
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:27,049
Oh, we keep him here.

373
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:32,560
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

374
00:33:32,663 --> 00:33:35,154
Fett demanded only one thing:

375
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:37,860
An unaltered clone for himself.

376
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:40,403
- Curious, isn't it?
- "Unaltered"?

377
00:33:40,505 --> 00:33:43,030
Pure genetic replication.

378
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:46,304
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

379
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,970
and no growth acceleration.

380
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,311
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

381
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,715
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

382
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:16,102
Magnificent, aren't they?

383
00:34:38,672 --> 00:34:41,698
Boba, is your father here?

384
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:43,732
Yep.

385
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:45,903
May we see him?

386
00:34:46,547 --> 00:34:48,845
Sure.

387
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,578
Dad, Taun We's here.

388
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:08,234
Jango, welcome back.

389
00:35:08,569 --> 00:35:10,503
Was your trip productive?

390
00:35:10,604 --> 00:35:12,538
Fairly.

391
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,474
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

392
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:19,375
He's come to check on our progress.

393
00:35:19,713 --> 00:35:22,614
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

394
00:35:22,716 --> 00:35:25,708
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

395
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,517
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

396
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:32,517
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

397
00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:36,357
Possibly.

398
00:35:36,464 --> 00:35:38,557
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

399
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,195
Boba, rood eht so-heeck.

400
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:47,806
Master who?

401
00:35:49,844 --> 00:35:51,869
Sifo-Dyas.

402
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:54,607
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

403
00:35:57,585 --> 00:35:59,450
Never heard of him.

404
00:36:02,356 --> 00:36:03,448
Really?

405
00:36:04,592 --> 00:36:08,551
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

406
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:10,289
Curious.

407
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:16,565
Do you like your army?

408
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:19,339
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

409
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:24,009
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

410
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:26,238
Thank you for your time, Jango.

411
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:30,108
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

412
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:51,767
What is it, Dad?

413
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,131
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

414
00:37:12,803 --> 00:37:15,033
Don't go.

415
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:19,042
I don't want to disturb you.

416
00:37:20,377 --> 00:37:22,345
Your presence is soothing.

417
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:27,342
You had another nightmare last night.

418
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:30,918
Jedi don't have nightmares.

419
00:37:31,455 --> 00:37:33,446
I heard you.

420
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:40,386
I saw my mother.

421
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,459
She is suffering, Padmé.

422
00:37:47,938 --> 00:37:51,135
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

423
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:04,978
She is in pain.

424
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,491
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

425
00:38:09,593 --> 00:38:11,584
but I have to go.

426
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:16,556
I have to help her.

427
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:20,168
I'll go with you.

428
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,568
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

429
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,873
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

430
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:34,369
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

431
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,641
it will take more time to grow them.

432
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:39,511
I won't forget, and thank you.

433
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,448
Thank you.

434
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,862
R4!

435
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,269
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

436
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:13,180
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.

437
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:17,186
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.

438
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,756
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...

439
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,984
is the assassin we are looking for.

440
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:24,060
Do you think these cloners
are involved...

441
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,220
in the plot to assassinate
Senator Amidala?

442
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,231
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.

443
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,234
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

444
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,305
Clear your mind must be...

445
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:39,603
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

446
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,575
Yes, Master.

447
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,739
They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army...

448
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:48,444
at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.

449
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,189
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

450
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,783
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?

451
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,795
No. Whoever placed that order...

452
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,195
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

453
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,928
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

454
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,139
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

455
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:15,403
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

456
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:17,639
we could not see.

457
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,213
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

458
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,345
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

459
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:30,557
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

460
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,958
If informed the senate is...

461
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,531
multiply our adversaries will.

462
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,794
No.

463
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,015
Dad, look!

464
00:40:44,653 --> 00:40:47,087
Boba, get on board!

465
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,596
Wait right there.

466
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:27,730
Chut-chut, Watto.

467
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,100
Let me help you with that.

468
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:34,176
What do you want?

469
00:42:34,257 --> 00:42:36,418
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

470
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:40,656
Ani?

471
00:42:42,566 --> 00:42:44,329
Little Ani?

472
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:49,239
Nahhh.

473
00:42:51,041 --> 00:42:53,737
You are Ani! It is you!

474
00:42:55,145 --> 00:42:58,410
You sure sprouted, huh?

475
00:42:59,249 --> 00:43:01,774
A Jedi! Whattaya know!

476
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,026
My mother.

477
00:43:04,127 --> 00:43:06,618
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

478
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:11,329
She's not mine-a no more-a.
I sold her.

479
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:13,732
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

480
00:43:13,837 --> 00:43:16,931
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

481
00:43:18,074 --> 00:43:21,840
I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

482
00:43:21,945 --> 00:43:23,970
At least I think it was Lars.

483
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,572
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

484
00:43:27,684 --> 00:43:29,982
Can ya beat that, eh?

485
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:33,048
Do you know where they are now?

486
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,059
Long way from here.

487
00:43:36,161 --> 00:43:40,655
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

488
00:43:40,765 --> 00:43:42,756
I'd like to know.

489
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:47,166
Sure. Absolutely!

490
00:43:47,773 --> 00:43:49,798
Let's go look at my records, huh?

491
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:30,461
I think we've waited long enough.

492
00:44:45,593 --> 00:44:49,495
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

493
00:45:25,633 --> 00:45:27,567
Stay with the ship, R2.

494
00:45:42,183 --> 00:45:44,485
Hello. I am C...

495
00:45:44,487 --> 00:45:46,387
3PO?

496
00:45:48,457 --> 00:45:50,322
The maker!

497
00:45:50,426 --> 00:45:52,053
Master Ani!

498
00:45:52,161 --> 00:45:54,959
I knew you would return.
I knew it!

499
00:45:55,097 --> 00:45:56,826
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

500
00:45:56,932 --> 00:45:58,524
Hello, 3PO.

501
00:45:58,634 --> 00:46:02,536
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

502
00:46:02,638 --> 00:46:04,606
I've come to see my mother.

503
00:46:06,442 --> 00:46:08,467
I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.

504
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:15,941
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

505
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:18,349
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

506
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,931
I had a feeling
you might show up someday.

507
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:24,430
Is my mother here?

508
00:46:24,536 --> 00:46:26,265
No, she's not.

509
00:46:27,472 --> 00:46:29,201
Cliegg Lars.

510
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:31,298
Shmi is my wife.

511
00:46:32,411 --> 00:46:35,437
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

512
00:46:43,054 --> 00:46:46,148
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

513
00:46:46,258 --> 00:46:49,159
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

514
00:46:50,162 --> 00:46:53,063
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

515
00:46:53,165 --> 00:46:56,532
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

516
00:46:57,235 --> 00:47:00,796
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...

517
00:47:00,906 --> 00:47:02,806
when they took her.

518
00:47:04,409 --> 00:47:06,468
Those Tuskens walk like men...

519
00:47:06,578 --> 00:47:11,174
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

520
00:47:13,018 --> 00:47:16,044
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

521
00:47:16,259 --> 00:47:21,891
I just couldn't ride anymore
until I heal.

522
00:47:22,766 --> 00:47:24,734
I don't want to give up on her...

523
00:47:24,835 --> 00:47:27,702
but she's been gone a month.

524
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:30,830
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

525
00:47:35,612 --> 00:47:37,580
Where are you going?

526
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:40,106
To find my mother.

527
00:47:41,318 --> 00:47:44,185
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.

528
00:48:06,343 --> 00:48:09,335
You're gonna have to stay here.

529
00:48:09,446 --> 00:48:12,108
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

530
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:26,729
I won't be long.

531
00:50:15,705 --> 00:50:17,696
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...

532
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:20,207
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

533
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:23,108
What about the senator
from Naboo?

534
00:50:23,747 --> 00:50:25,772
Is she dead yet?

535
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:30,442
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

536
00:50:30,553 --> 00:50:32,851
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

537
00:50:32,956 --> 00:50:36,016
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

538
00:50:36,126 --> 00:50:39,289
you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy.

539
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,140
As I explained to you earlier...

540
00:50:52,242 --> 00:50:55,473
I am quite convinced
that 10,000 more systems...

541
00:50:55,578 --> 00:50:58,376
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

542
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:03,336
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

543
00:51:03,705 --> 00:51:06,333
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

544
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:09,467
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

545
00:51:10,312 --> 00:51:13,008
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

546
00:51:14,082 --> 00:51:17,916
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

547
00:52:18,247 --> 00:52:19,338
Mom?

548
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,152
Ani?

549
00:52:29,424 --> 00:52:31,085
Is it you?

550
00:52:31,192 --> 00:52:34,753
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

551
00:52:36,136 --> 00:52:39,105
Ani?

552
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,722
I love y...

553
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:44,859
Anakin!

554
00:53:45,404 --> 00:53:46,871
No!

555
00:54:07,259 --> 00:54:08,886
What is it?

556
00:54:09,878 --> 00:54:12,904
Young Skywalker is in pain...

557
00:54:13,014 --> 00:54:14,879
terrible pain.

558
00:54:19,688 --> 00:54:23,317
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

559
00:54:23,425 --> 00:54:26,155
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

560
00:54:27,729 --> 00:54:29,720
We'll have to try something else.

561
00:54:32,634 --> 00:54:35,432
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo.

562
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,431
It's much closer.

563
00:54:39,274 --> 00:54:41,572
Anakin, do you copy?

564
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:44,679
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

565
00:54:44,779 --> 00:54:47,111
He's not on Naboo, R4.

566
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:50,845
I'm going to try and widen the range.

567
00:54:54,255 --> 00:54:56,223
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

568
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:05,597
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...

569
00:55:05,734 --> 00:55:08,202
but it's coming from Tatooine.

570
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:12,365
What in the blazes is he doing there?

571
00:55:12,474 --> 00:55:14,442
I told him to stay on Naboo.

572
00:55:17,946 --> 00:55:19,641
We haven't got much time.

573
00:55:19,748 --> 00:55:21,807
Anakin, do you copy?

574
00:55:21,916 --> 00:55:23,941
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

575
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,794
Retransmit this message...

576
00:55:35,864 --> 00:55:38,526
Anakin, do you copy?

577
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:40,999
My long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

578
00:55:41,102 --> 00:55:43,434
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

579
00:56:27,982 --> 00:56:29,973
I brought you something.

580
00:56:30,085 --> 00:56:32,212
Are you hungry?

581
00:56:33,988 --> 00:56:35,956
The shifter broke.

582
00:56:37,826 --> 00:56:40,624
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

583
00:56:43,064 --> 00:56:46,556
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.

584
00:56:48,903 --> 00:56:50,871
But I couldn't...

585
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:56,810
Why'd she have to die?

586
00:57:00,281 --> 00:57:02,374
Why couldn't I save her?

587
00:57:02,517 --> 00:57:04,542
I know I could have!

588
00:57:07,388 --> 00:57:09,913
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

589
00:57:11,593 --> 00:57:14,255
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

590
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:19,022
Someday I will be.

591
00:57:19,367 --> 00:57:21,995
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

592
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:25,730
I promise you.

593
00:57:26,474 --> 00:57:28,840
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.

594
00:57:28,864 --> 00:57:30,364
Anakin?

595
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:36,607
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!

596
00:57:36,718 --> 00:57:38,743
He's holding me back!

597
00:57:43,224 --> 00:57:44,083
What's wrong, Ani?

598
00:57:50,812 --> 00:57:51,812
I...

599
00:57:55,937 --> 00:57:57,905
I killed them.

600
00:57:59,641 --> 00:58:01,609
I killed them all.

601
00:58:03,444 --> 00:58:05,344
They're dead.

602
00:58:05,446 --> 00:58:07,539
Every single one of them.

603
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:11,652
And not just the men...

604
00:58:13,588 --> 00:58:15,647
but the women...

605
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:17,657
and the children too.

606
00:58:18,626 --> 00:58:20,685
They're like animals...

607
00:58:20,795 --> 00:58:23,127
and I slaughtered them like animals!

608
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:26,757
I hate them!

609
00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:46,587
To be angry is to be human.

610
00:58:46,688 --> 00:58:48,588
I'm a Jedi.

611
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:51,591
I know I'm better than this.

612
00:59:42,088 --> 00:59:44,352
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

613
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,224
I wasn't strong enough.

614
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:57,166
But I promise I won't fail again.

615
01:00:08,113 --> 01:00:10,172
I miss you...

616
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,450
so much.

617
01:00:20,392 --> 01:00:23,088
R2? What are you doing here?

618
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:30,230
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

619
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:34,364
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

620
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,976
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

621
01:00:39,078 --> 01:00:41,308
Retransmit this message
to Coruscant.

622
01:00:45,818 --> 01:00:48,048
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...

623
01:00:48,153 --> 01:00:50,314
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.

624
01:00:50,422 --> 01:00:54,051
The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here...

625
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:56,150
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...

626
01:00:56,261 --> 01:00:59,753
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.

627
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:02,026
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...

628
01:01:02,134 --> 01:01:05,797
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming...

629
01:01:05,938 --> 01:01:07,963
Wait.

630
01:01:18,817 --> 01:01:23,447
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

631
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,318
I agree.

632
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:29,023
We will deal with Count Dooku.

633
01:01:29,128 --> 01:01:32,689
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.

634
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:35,528
Protect the senator at all costs.

635
01:01:35,634 --> 01:01:38,159
That is your first priority.

636
01:01:39,605 --> 01:01:41,573
Understood, Master.

637
01:01:41,673 --> 01:01:43,607
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

638
01:01:43,709 --> 01:01:46,940
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

639
01:01:49,148 --> 01:01:51,241
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

640
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:53,318
If he's still alive.

641
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,882
Are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?

642
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:00,481
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

643
01:02:01,693 --> 01:02:05,390
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

644
01:02:05,497 --> 01:02:08,728
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...

645
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:11,029
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

646
01:02:12,404 --> 01:02:15,965
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

647
01:02:20,012 --> 01:02:23,175
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

648
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:36,428
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.

649
01:02:36,528 --> 01:02:38,496
Count Dooku must have made
a treaty with them.

650
01:02:38,597 --> 01:02:41,998
The debate is over.

651
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:45,092
Now we need that clone army.

652
01:02:45,204 --> 01:02:48,139
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.

653
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,674
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

654
01:02:50,776 --> 01:02:52,539
before the separatists attack.

655
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,544
This is a crisis.

656
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:57,774
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

657
01:02:57,883 --> 01:03:00,943
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

658
01:03:01,286 --> 01:03:03,481
But what senator would have
the courage...

659
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:06,149
to propose such a radical amendment?

660
01:03:06,258 --> 01:03:10,354
If only Senator Amidala were here.

661
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,581
Traitor.

662
01:03:34,086 --> 01:03:37,249
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

663
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:39,415
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

664
01:03:39,525 --> 01:03:42,153
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.

665
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:44,855
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

666
01:03:44,963 --> 01:03:48,399
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

667
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,163
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

668
01:03:52,271 --> 01:03:56,071
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

669
01:03:56,174 --> 01:03:58,608
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

670
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:01,611
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

671
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,374
Do you know him?

672
01:04:03,482 --> 01:04:06,280
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

673
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:08,353
The Geonosians don't trust them.

674
01:04:08,453 --> 01:04:11,320
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

675
01:04:12,457 --> 01:04:16,621
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

676
01:04:17,296 --> 01:04:19,764
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.

677
01:04:24,636 --> 01:04:26,661
I wish he were still alive.

678
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,836
I could use his help right now.

679
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:34,178
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

680
01:04:35,981 --> 01:04:38,882
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

681
01:04:38,984 --> 01:04:41,544
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...

682
01:04:41,653 --> 01:04:43,678
just as you were once his.

683
01:04:44,656 --> 01:04:46,851
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

684
01:04:46,959 --> 01:04:49,985
but he wouldn't have gone along with it
if he had learned the truth as I have.

685
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:52,859
- The truth?
- The truth.

686
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:02,570
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

687
01:05:02,674 --> 01:05:04,767
of the dark lord of the Sith?

688
01:05:04,876 --> 01:05:07,709
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

689
01:05:07,846 --> 01:05:12,078
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

690
01:05:13,218 --> 01:05:15,778
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

691
01:05:15,887 --> 01:05:20,483
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

692
01:05:21,593 --> 01:05:23,185
I don't believe you.

693
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:25,661
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

694
01:05:25,764 --> 01:05:28,995
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...

695
01:05:29,868 --> 01:05:33,702
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

696
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:36,899
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

697
01:05:38,944 --> 01:05:41,003
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

698
01:05:42,214 --> 01:05:46,173
and together we will destroy the Sith!

699
01:05:47,919 --> 01:05:50,217
I will never join you, Dooku.

700
01:05:59,731 --> 01:06:02,632
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

701
01:06:11,016 --> 01:06:14,349
It is with great reluctance...

702
01:06:14,453 --> 01:06:16,546
that I have agreed to this calling.

703
01:06:17,923 --> 01:06:21,882
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.

704
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:24,923
The power you give me...

705
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:29,558
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

706
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:38,874
And as my first act
with this new authority...

707
01:06:38,977 --> 01:06:43,380
I will create
a grand army of the Republic...

708
01:06:43,482 --> 01:06:47,248
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

709
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:50,485
It is done, then.

710
01:06:54,294 --> 01:06:57,957
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

711
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,385
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?

712
01:07:19,529 --> 01:07:21,554
They're exhaust vents of some type.

713
01:07:22,432 --> 01:07:24,400
That'll do.

714
01:07:33,877 --> 01:07:36,812
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

715
01:07:36,913 --> 01:07:39,006
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

716
01:07:39,116 --> 01:07:40,777
As a member of the senate...

717
01:07:40,884 --> 01:07:43,978
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

718
01:07:44,354 --> 01:07:46,322
Don't worry.

719
01:07:46,423 --> 01:07:48,857
I've given up
trying to argue with you.

720
01:07:53,597 --> 01:07:56,828
If they had needed our help
they would have asked for it.

721
01:07:57,435 --> 01:08:00,563
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behavior.

722
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:28,796
I am programmed
to understand humans!

723
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:31,874
Where are you going now?

724
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:35,474
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

725
01:08:35,853 --> 01:08:37,548
Idiot!

726
01:09:07,251 --> 01:09:08,680
Padmé!

727
01:12:08,274 --> 01:12:09,707
Don't move, Jedi!

728
01:12:09,809 --> 01:12:11,299
Take him away.

729
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:32,160
Don't be afraid.

730
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:35,924
I'm not afraid to die.

731
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:44,903
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

732
01:12:48,716 --> 01:12:50,775
I love you.

733
01:13:50,881 --> 01:13:53,509
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

734
01:13:53,617 --> 01:13:56,677
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

735
01:13:59,056 --> 01:14:00,921
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

736
01:14:02,192 --> 01:14:03,516
Good job.

737
01:14:15,773 --> 01:14:18,799
Settle down. Settle down.

738
01:14:22,813 --> 01:14:26,544
Let the executions begin.

739
01:16:02,195 --> 01:16:03,594
Jump!

740
01:16:30,221 --> 01:16:33,282
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

741
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:35,518
Jango! Finish her off!

742
01:16:35,626 --> 01:16:38,857
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

743
01:17:09,693 --> 01:17:11,160
Master Windu.

744
01:17:11,262 --> 01:17:13,594
How pleasant of you to join us.

745
01:17:14,313 --> 01:17:16,577
Brave...

746
01:17:16,682 --> 01:17:19,048
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

747
01:17:19,151 --> 01:17:21,016
You're impossibly outnumbered.

748
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,452
I don't think so.

749
01:17:37,056 --> 01:17:38,489
We'll see.

750
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,757
Master Windu...

751
01:20:33,865 --> 01:20:36,095
you have fought gallantly...

752
01:20:37,268 --> 01:20:41,295
worthy of recognition in the
archives of the Jedi order.

753
01:20:43,274 --> 01:20:44,571
Now...

754
01:20:45,543 --> 01:20:47,943
it is finished.

755
01:20:48,046 --> 01:20:50,037
Surrender...

756
01:20:50,148 --> 01:20:52,844
and your lives will be spared.

757
01:20:53,718 --> 01:20:56,846
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

758
01:20:56,955 --> 01:20:57,979
Then...

759
01:20:59,457 --> 01:21:01,516
I'm sorry, old friend.

760
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:14,636
Look!

761
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:24,782
If Dooku escapes...

762
01:22:24,893 --> 01:22:28,590
rally more systems
to his cause he will.

763
01:22:37,832 --> 01:22:40,164
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

764
01:22:40,268 --> 01:22:42,327
That doesn't seem possible.

765
01:22:42,437 --> 01:22:45,133
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

766
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,676
We must send
all available droids into battle.

767
01:22:48,777 --> 01:22:50,677
There are too many.

768
01:22:51,646 --> 01:22:54,410
Our communications have been jammed.

769
01:23:01,124 --> 01:23:02,325
Padmé!

770
01:23:05,139 --> 01:23:06,733
Put the ship down!

771
01:23:06,757 --> 01:23:07,841
Anakin!

772
01:23:07,842 --> 01:23:09,542
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

773
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:12,051
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

774
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:15,646
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

775
01:23:15,757 --> 01:23:18,749
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

776
01:23:18,861 --> 01:23:21,159
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

777
01:23:21,263 --> 01:23:24,494
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

778
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:27,228
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

779
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:33,899
She would do her duty.

780
01:23:44,385 --> 01:23:45,444
Sir...

781
01:23:45,468 --> 01:23:47,968
I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

782
01:23:49,992 --> 01:23:51,992
To the forward command center.

783
01:24:17,016 --> 01:24:20,216
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

784
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:22,840
Very good.

785
01:24:23,464 --> 01:24:25,064
Very good.

786
01:24:30,746 --> 01:24:32,646
Are you all right?

787
01:24:32,748 --> 01:24:34,409
Uh-huh.

788
01:24:35,051 --> 01:24:37,315
We'd better get back
to the forward command center.

789
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,012
No.

790
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:42,648
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

791
01:24:42,758 --> 01:24:44,726
Get a transport. Hurry!

792
01:24:44,827 --> 01:24:45,885
Right away.

793
01:25:14,118 --> 01:25:16,618
This is not looking good at all!

794
01:25:18,142 --> 01:25:21,042
We must get the starships
back into space.

795
01:25:24,266 --> 01:25:27,266
We have to order a retreat.

796
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,790
My master will never allow
the Republic...

797
01:25:30,814 --> 01:25:32,814
to get away with this treachery.

798
01:25:32,838 --> 01:25:35,838
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

799
01:25:36,362 --> 01:25:39,362
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

800
01:25:44,386 --> 01:25:47,386
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

801
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:53,510
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

802
01:26:29,042 --> 01:26:33,042
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

803
01:26:34,066 --> 01:26:35,166
Yes, sir.

804
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:38,390
Move all quadrants to sector 515.

805
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,782
The droid army is
in full retreat.

806
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:16,990
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

807
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:43,778
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

808
01:27:43,887 --> 01:27:45,782
We'll take him together.
You go in slowly on the le...

809
01:27:45,783 --> 01:27:47,651
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

810
01:27:55,832 --> 01:27:59,324
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

811
01:27:59,436 --> 01:28:01,370
Now... back down.

812
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:09,041
I don't think so.

813
01:28:21,357 --> 01:28:24,588
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

814
01:28:24,694 --> 01:28:27,754
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

815
01:28:31,133 --> 01:28:33,567
Surely you can do better.

816
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:04,885
Brave of you, boy.

817
01:29:06,156 --> 01:29:08,286
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

818
01:29:08,392 --> 01:29:09,984
I am a slow learner.

819
01:29:09,608 --> 01:29:10,708
Anakin!

820
01:30:12,056 --> 01:30:13,819
Master Yoda.

821
01:30:15,095 --> 01:30:18,462
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

822
01:30:34,262 --> 01:30:37,197
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

823
01:30:37,699 --> 01:30:40,793
The dark side I sense in you.

824
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:43,700
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

825
01:30:44,806 --> 01:30:46,433
Even you.

826
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:04,883
Much to learn you still have.

827
01:31:04,993 --> 01:31:08,190
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

828
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:10,560
by our knowledge of the Force.

829
01:31:42,445 --> 01:31:46,211
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

830
01:31:46,315 --> 01:31:48,078
This is just the beginning.

831
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:23,238
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

832
01:34:23,339 --> 01:34:26,308
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

833
01:34:28,177 --> 01:34:30,509
You have done well.

834
01:34:30,613 --> 01:34:32,979
I have good news for you, my lord.

835
01:34:34,484 --> 01:34:37,510
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

836
01:34:38,121 --> 01:34:40,817
Everything is going as planned.

837
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,759
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

838
01:34:55,304 --> 01:34:57,295
It doesn't feel right.

839
01:34:58,185 --> 01:35:01,211
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

840
01:35:01,491 --> 01:35:03,356
Where is your apprentice?

841
01:35:03,460 --> 01:35:07,362
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

842
01:35:09,166 --> 01:35:12,795
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

843
01:35:12,903 --> 01:35:14,962
Victory?

844
01:35:15,839 --> 01:35:18,239
Victory, you say?

845
01:35:18,341 --> 01:35:22,038
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

846
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:26,811
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

847
01:35:28,151 --> 01:35:31,985
Begun the Clone War has.
