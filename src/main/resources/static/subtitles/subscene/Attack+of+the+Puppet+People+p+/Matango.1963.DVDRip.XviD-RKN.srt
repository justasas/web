1
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:22,689
MATANGO
(ATTACK OF THE MUSHROOM PEOPLE)

2
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,528
This is probably
the psychiatric ward.

3
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:39,333
No... I'm sure that it is.

4
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:44,039
Everyone thinks I'm insane...
but I know I'm not crazy.

5
00:00:46,804 --> 00:00:50,813
They're all dead...
every one of them.

6
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:57,070
No... I'm the only one dead.
It's true, the others are still alive.

7
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,938
Well, why didn't they return, you ask?

8
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:06,435
If you listen to what I tell you,

9
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:09,641
it will probably convince you
that I'm insane, huh?

10
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:39,288
It's so good
to feel a breeze like this.

11
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:40,991
It let's me forget about everything.

12
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:42,994
Everything?

13
00:02:43,095 --> 00:02:45,934
All of the garbage
I put up with in Tokyo.

14
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:48,038
You shouldn't say things like that.

15
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,483
Why not?

16
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:53,384
Tokyo is my favorite city.
All of my important things are there!

17
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:54,595
Oh, you!

18
00:02:55,998 --> 00:02:57,043
What... ? Oh, no!

19
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:02,138
Hey, Yoshida!
You better forget about work!

20
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,239
Damn! This was going to be
my best story yet!

21
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,709
That's what you always say.

22
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:32,783
Is this her first time on a boat?

23
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:36,395
It's alright.
It seems like she's not enjoying it.

24
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:38,197
Hey, it's my first time too!

25
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:42,905
You're different.
His girl won't even let him kiss her.

26
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:46,008
I don't see what's so funny!

27
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:50,235
What's the matter?

28
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,329
Teacher...

29
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:54,753
Are you feeling ill?

30
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:58,648
I'm not good at this.

31
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,625
I'm not very comfortable around them.

32
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:06,311
They're a pretty good bunch.
Give yourself a chance with them.

33
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,238
Do it for my sake.

34
00:05:13,843 --> 00:05:16,724
Hurry it up. You can still work
while you're listening to her.

35
00:05:17,977 --> 00:05:19,522
She's a great sight for the eyes, huh?

36
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,841
That's so pretty!

37
00:05:32,994 --> 00:05:34,176
So, that's Mami...

38
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:37,354
I wonder how she got
into radio and television.

39
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,057
Someone's daughter... or wife?

40
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:41,487
Not exactly.

41
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:45,010
Maybe she's someone's mistress!

42
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:03,661
Well, cheers!

43
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:06,959
Just a moment.
This is bigger than a simple toast!

44
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,901
At this moment,

45
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:11,152
we're on the open seas,
far from the troubles of mankind.

46
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:13,455
- There is...
- Here you go again!

47
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,879
Aren't we part of mankind here?

48
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:20,488
I think it's quite clear that we're
an exception to what I'm saying.

49
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,076
I'm going topside to take a look.

50
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:23,120
Hey, just a minute...!

51
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,368
I'm under orders. I'm the captain.

52
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:31,013
Well, here's to
our new member, Akiko. Cheers!

53
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:32,139
Cheers!

54
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:41,953
We're going to have
some rough seas tonight.

55
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:42,964
It's on the radio?

56
00:06:42,965 --> 00:06:46,379
Yes. There's a low-pressure system
heading west from the Kyushu area.

57
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,625
I thought we were going
to have good weather.

58
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:53,595
The sea is already churning!

59
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:56,310
No, it's not that strong yet.

60
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,951
We should turn this boat around.

61
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,496
They want us to stay on this course.

62
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:04,877
We won't be able to go much further.

63
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,632
We're going to stay on course.

64
00:07:07,676 --> 00:07:10,341
People act like children
regardless of how old they are.

65
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,044
That's just the way the world works.

66
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:18,708
I'll take over
if you don't want to go any further.

67
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:20,110
I'll continue on your course.

68
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:22,499
Well, you don't seem
too confident about it.

69
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,904
I'd like us
to keep sailing as we planned.

70
00:07:27,194 --> 00:07:29,824
It should be fun
going through some rough weather.

71
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,571
You're forgetting about the two women.

72
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:34,309
Don't worry about me.
I'm not against it.

73
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:37,332
Akiko...?

74
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,805
I'm alright.

75
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,151
Hey, it will be okay.

76
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:46,678
This yacht is the best you can buy,
and it can weather any storm.

77
00:07:57,361 --> 00:08:00,482
Captain! Captain! Come here!

78
00:08:04,592 --> 00:08:06,647
What's wrong?

79
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:12,702
Alright... ready the sails!

80
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:16,911
Hey! Everyone on deck!

81
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:23,300
- Man the front sail!
- Right!

82
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:32,778
- Go!
- Go!

83
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:51,879
It's alright. Kasai told you so!

84
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:55,704
He said this is the best yacht
money could buy!

85
00:08:56,106 --> 00:08:57,616
Do you know
how much he paid for it?

86
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,801
¥40,000,000! I think he's crazy!

87
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:07,355
But anyway...
he's going to take me to Europe in it!

88
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:13,252
Paris... Rome... Vienna...
It's wonderful!

89
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,955
I'm going to visit all of them!

90
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:20,467
Alright...
we should be able to manage this.

91
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:35,236
The sea is pretty rough.

92
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,160
How are you feeling?
Not too bad, right?

93
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:43,550
Yes, really?
Well, I think we've had enough too.

94
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:55,920
Lower the main sail!

95
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:06,734
You're a professor
of psychology, right?

96
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:11,956
About women... is it true
that if a guy treats them bad...

97
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:15,438
then acts sympathetic toward them...
They fall for him immediately?

98
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:18,971
That's the way all men think!
It's not psychology!

99
00:10:26,245 --> 00:10:27,990
Hey! I'll be alright!

100
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:32,917
Switch places!

101
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:42,480
Are you okay? Don't worry.
Come on, relax!

102
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,137
Kasai! The engine, start it!

103
00:11:31,446 --> 00:11:34,051
- The anchor! Throw the anchor!
- Right!

104
00:11:53,395 --> 00:11:56,786
The mast is gone! Hey, get below!

105
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:59,190
Everyone, get below! Get below!

106
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:12,094
It's alright!
This yacht is too tough to sink!

107
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:13,596
I'm sure of it!

108
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:15,600
Hey, the radio's out! It blew up!

109
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,203
Hey captain!

110
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,426
This is all your fault!
The engine won't start!

111
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:21,756
How in the world
are we going to fix it?!

112
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:23,043
What?!

113
00:12:23,184 --> 00:12:24,788
Hey, where's Yoshida?

114
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,501
That idiot!

115
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,299
Damn!

116
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,232
Yoshida!

117
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:39,193
Yoshida!

118
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,447
Are you alright? Come on!

119
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:48,323
Hang in there!

120
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,069
Are you alright?

121
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:03,664
- Is he okay?
- Yoshida! Yoshida!

122
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,902
It's finally over.

123
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:57,590
It shouldn't be too long

124
00:13:57,591 --> 00:14:00,277
before they start searching
for the yacht, right?

125
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,425
Naturally.

126
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:09,861
- We're drifting?
- Yes.

127
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:14,489
- South, I'd say.
- South?

128
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,303
Hey, where are we now?

129
00:14:19,504 --> 00:14:21,290
Our direction-finder is damaged.

130
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,021
We're lost?

131
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,529
It seems so.

132
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,455
- How can a skipper like you...
- Skipper?!

133
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,904
If I'm the skipper,

134
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,973
we would have returned to port
the first time I said to go back.

135
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:38,109
You became the skipper then!

136
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:46,332
There must be something we can do.

137
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:04,669
Don't waste the energy!

138
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,555
We're not sure if
we're going to need it!

139
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:09,569
It's time for the news.

140
00:15:16,562 --> 00:15:21,093
<i>the yacht was reported missing
after a heavy storm.

141
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:25,023
<i>The 7 people believed to be
on the yacht are Masoko Kasai,

142
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:28,529

143

151
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:10,280
The batteries weren't very new.

152
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:44,862
A ship!

153
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:47,289
Hey!

154
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,621
Look out! Look out!
Look out!

155
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,685
What's wrong?

156
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:21,244
Hey, Yoshida! Yoshida!

157
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:24,795
Hang in there! Hey!

158
00:17:34,008 --> 00:17:36,022
When is this fog going to go away?

159
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:40,452
Hey, how much water do we have left?

160
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:43,357
Be quiet!
You'll wear yourself out gabbing!

161
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:46,583
My head hurts!
What's going to happen to me?

162
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:56,870
What?

163
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,928
It's nothing.

164
00:18:01,883 --> 00:18:03,395
Shut up!

165
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:08,987
Everyone knows...
they all know what you're after.

166
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,294
They know why you didn't want to go
back when the weather got worse.

167
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:18,197
No wonder why a woman
is taboo on a ship...

168
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:21,002
it's not because
the gods are jealous of them!

169
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:25,612
It's more because
they drive guys crazy in the head!

170
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,509
An island...! An island!

171
00:18:57,658 --> 00:19:00,966
An island! An island! I see an island!

172
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:03,747
Hey, wake up!

173
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,199
Is it Japan?

174
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:24,665
I wonder if it's the Bonan Islands?

175
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,957
Is it deserted?

176
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:57,938
Well, let's find some food first,
then we can look around the island.

177
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:15,221
It's getting foggy.

178
00:21:15,222 --> 00:21:18,094
We better hurry and find something
before the fog gets too thick.

179
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:32,195
Hey! Why go up there?

180
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:34,960
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

181
00:21:57,244 --> 00:21:58,287
What's up?

182
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:00,341
Water!

183
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:02,930
Don't tell me that you can't hear it?!

184
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:09,502
It's water!

185
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:12,123
Hey! We found water!

186
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:13,669
Water!

187
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,387
Water?

188
00:22:21,884 --> 00:22:24,489
These stones..
this island isn't deserted!

189
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,592
Someone built this by hand!

190
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,813
Hey, shouldn't we be heading back?

191
00:22:49,814 --> 00:22:52,100
We think this path was man-made.

192
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:03,423
Let's go to the other side
of the island.

193
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,428
We may find houses over there.

194
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:36,018
Hey, are we going to climb up there?

195
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,932
Be careful.
We're at the edge of a cliff.

196
00:23:53,136 --> 00:23:54,347
Look over there!

197
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:57,111
It's a ship!

198
00:24:02,913 --> 00:24:05,042
Hey, let's go down this way.

199
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,702
Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hold it!

200
00:24:40,203 --> 00:24:41,788
It's only a shipwreck.

201
00:24:49,345 --> 00:24:52,091
Look at it. The sails are rotten.

202
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:01,487
I'd say it was beached
well over a year ago.

203
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:03,090
But we should still go.

204
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:05,593
We don't know
if anyone is still alive.

205
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,186
Hey... let's go, okay?

206
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,877
It's in terrible shape!

207
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:37,982
There won't be anything here
but rotting bodies.

208
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,085
Don't say that!

209
00:25:39,086 --> 00:25:42,189
I'll wait here. They would have eaten
all of their food before they died.

210
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,392
Yoshida!

211
00:25:43,393 --> 00:25:46,213
You girls wait here.
We'll take a look.

212
00:25:47,116 --> 00:25:48,744
Let's go.

213
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:04,490
It looks pretty beat.

214
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:06,194
Someone could be living on board.

215
00:26:51,014 --> 00:26:52,074
What happened?

216
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:56,374
The stairs are slippery. It's moss.

217
00:27:30,257 --> 00:27:31,944
There's nobody here.

218
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:44,343
There are no bodies.

219
00:28:09,191 --> 00:28:10,736
What unusual moss!

220
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:39,951
What was that?

221
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,469
What's with you?

222
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:52,642
I can't find a speck of food anywhere.

223
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:57,806
I'm going to see what's happening.
I can't stand waiting here.

224
00:29:03,927 --> 00:29:05,941
That's a sea-water pump.

225
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:07,809
There's a geiger-counter.

226
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:11,203
This must have been a research ship.

227
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:17,175
The moss in this cabin
is a different color.

228
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:29,281
It has no eyes!

229
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:37,978
It's an example of mutation
caused by radiation.

230
00:29:41,978 --> 00:29:45,465
Maybe the ship was studying the
effects of a nuclear explosion.

231
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:49,439
I wonder why the moss
hasn't covered these shelves?

232
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:52,461
Perhaps they're disinfected.

233
00:29:58,858 --> 00:30:02,897
This alcohol lamp is clean too.
Chemicals seem to stop it.

234
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:14,633
This is carbolic acid.

235
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:20,055
If we scrubbed the cabin with it,
it would be a perfect place to live.

236
00:30:24,313 --> 00:30:25,399
What's this?

237
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:34,733
It's some kind of giant mushroom!

238
00:30:37,947 --> 00:30:41,246
Matango... a kind of mushroom.

239
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:44,355
It's probably a new species
found on this island.

240
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:46,855
We're in luck if this thing is edible.

241
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:48,345
Nothing else is written here.

242
00:31:02,924 --> 00:31:06,488
What happened to the mirrors?
It looks like they were removed.

243
00:31:09,683 --> 00:31:11,390
Hey... let's go.

244
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,527
This is the captain's cabin.

245
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:28,955
What's wrong?

246
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:33,455
What happened?

247
00:31:48,085 --> 00:31:49,382
Stay out!

248
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,589
This is the captain's cabin.

249
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,589
We don't know if the logbook
is in here somewhere.

250
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:21,076
Yokoyama.

251
00:32:23,285 --> 00:32:24,313
Yokoyama!

252
00:32:44,304 --> 00:32:45,868
You've found something to eat!

253
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:49,657
Who is it?

254
00:32:51,707 --> 00:32:53,959
Don't look at me like that.

255
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,169
We found the food, and it's
first come, first served around here.

256
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:11,580
Anyway, this logbook is all I found.

257
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:15,358
We can't determine
what country this ship is from.

258
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,868
I have a feeling
it was deliberately concealed.

259
00:33:20,388 --> 00:33:22,000
The equipment is different as well.

260
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:25,309
Some is communist countries...
the free world...

261
00:33:25,512 --> 00:33:27,316
and Japan, too.

262
00:33:28,236 --> 00:33:30,294
Secret research, huh?

263
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:33,826
Involved in some kind
of nuclear studies.

264
00:33:33,927 --> 00:33:37,436
This certainly wasn't
an ordinary research vessel.

265
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:42,154
We better figure out
what we're going to do.

266
00:33:43,477 --> 00:33:46,441
Just a moment! We should get Kasai.

267
00:33:47,044 --> 00:33:50,052
He's had enough
preferential treatment, huh?

268
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:01,149
What brings you to my door?

269
00:34:01,593 --> 00:34:02,696
Hey, Kasai.

270
00:34:03,423 --> 00:34:07,131
All of our provisions won't
last more than a week at this rate.

271
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:10,776
You can't stay shut
in this room all the time.

272
00:34:10,977 --> 00:34:12,877
What do you expect me to do?

273
00:34:13,764 --> 00:34:15,764
We need to plan for living here
a month or two.

274
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:17,970
We're talking about that now.

275
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:20,723
We think you should come over
to discuss it with us.

276
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,132
Oh, so you think I'm wasting my time?

277
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:29,757
I've been cleaning this up.
It should come in handy.

278
00:34:29,858 --> 00:34:32,127
It should be able to get us some meat.

279
00:34:32,128 --> 00:34:34,635
I think it will help us to stay alive.

280
00:34:46,637 --> 00:34:50,652
Everyone, what's the matter?
Let's get started.

281
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,930
According to the logbook,
this island is deserted.

282
00:34:57,418 --> 00:34:59,812
There's hardly anything edible on it,

283
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:01,819
so that puts us
in a difficult situation.

284
00:35:02,122 --> 00:35:04,991
Anyway, until we can leave here...

285
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:06,696
we have to eat.

286
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,505
The canned goods
will only last a week,

287
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:11,957
so we have to look for food.

288
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,530
Fish... seaweed... turtle's eggs...

289
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:18,339
anything we can eat,
including snakes and lizards.

290
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,774
However, the mushroom
should not be touched.

291
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:22,515
You mean it's poisonous?

292
00:35:22,673 --> 00:35:24,320
We don't know for sure.

293
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:26,559
There seems to be a substance in them

294
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,026
that damages nerve tissue.

295
00:35:28,903 --> 00:35:32,853
That's all the records indicate,
but there is other evidence.

296
00:35:32,854 --> 00:35:36,807
It's unlikely
that they would have left the ship,

297
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,614
if they had an ample supply of food.

298
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:44,441
What we know from the log is that,
"Every day, several men went out

299
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,246
"to search for foods
to add to their diet".

300
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:50,453
None of them ever returned.
Perhaps it was due to the mushrooms.

301
00:35:50,454 --> 00:35:52,717
They grow in great abundance
on the island.

302
00:35:52,785 --> 00:35:56,377
Now, we should try to move
the yacht to this side of the island

303
00:35:56,378 --> 00:35:57,477
in order to fix it.

304
00:35:57,478 --> 00:35:59,879
This island is covered in fog
most of the time.

305
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,679
Even if a ship passed by,
we'd be lucky if they saw us.

306
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,756
So we should ready it for sailing.

307
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:10,227
Fix that thing?! Sorry, I'm out.

308
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:13,372
It just needs a little repair!

309
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:15,772
You won't get me on it.

310
00:36:15,773 --> 00:36:18,281
If we're near the equator,

311
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:21,482
that means Japan is far away,
and I don't think we'd make it.

312
00:36:22,465 --> 00:36:24,064
Japan is pretty far away,

313
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:26,468
but I'm sure we would be rescued
by a ship on the way.

314
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:31,226
On a ship, you're the skipper...
so you give the orders,

315
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:33,126
which is fine by me.

316
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:37,932
This really isn't a ship anymore...
just a house on land.

317
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:39,334
Yoshida!

318
00:36:40,235 --> 00:36:42,594
It's time you two stop running things!

319
00:36:43,362 --> 00:36:45,241
Who are you to judge?

320
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:48,342
If you have a better idea,
why don't you tell us?!

321
00:36:48,343 --> 00:36:50,548
We shouldn't argue!

322
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:53,548
Everyone will have to do their share
so we can get out of this.

323
00:36:53,549 --> 00:36:57,719
The women will get the water.
You can go hunting if you want.

324
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,397
Whoever doesn't work on the boat

325
00:36:59,398 --> 00:37:02,399
should make an S.O.S. fire
on top of one of the mountains.

326
00:37:02,424 --> 00:37:03,482
I understand.

327
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:17,719
You take an awful lot of notes.

328
00:38:22,482 --> 00:38:25,389
I'm glad I don't work that hard.

329
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,989
I use the thoughts of those I hire.

330
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,242
That's what takes talent.

331
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:33,697
There's nothing wrong with
borrowing talent.

332
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:36,598
It takes ability
as well as intelligence.

333
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:38,985
You're right.

334
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:41,986
Civilization has progressed
by borrowing.

335
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:46,091
Each generation
takes an idea and improves it.

336
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:48,192
Novelists do the same thing, right?

337
00:38:57,645 --> 00:38:59,304
Your table is over here.

338
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:05,887
She's decided to come with us.

339
00:39:05,888 --> 00:39:07,329
I'd like to come along.

340
00:39:52,443 --> 00:39:55,221
We've walked a distance
and haven't seen anything yet.

341
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:08,443
Weren't all the mirrors
on the ship missing?

342
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:13,640
I wonder why they would bring
them up here to break them?

343
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:16,267
There must be a reason.

344
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,636
Why'd he do that?
Do you think he saw us?

345
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,953
No. It seemed like
he was avoiding the island.

346
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:48,155
Hey, that's not good.

347
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:50,465
The birds won't come
near this island?

348
00:40:59,444 --> 00:41:00,482
Sakuda!

349
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:07,993
Over there!

350
00:41:13,394 --> 00:41:15,514
This island is a ship's graveyard.

351
00:41:17,012 --> 00:41:18,512
Maybe it's the current.

352
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,961
It drags them off course, and
they smash against the rocks.

353
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,611
Idiot!

354
00:41:59,812 --> 00:42:03,506
Don't call me an idiot.
I came over here to help you.

355
00:42:03,983 --> 00:42:05,402
Let's go.

356
00:42:35,331 --> 00:42:36,250
Mushrooms.

357
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:46,277
I'd take a chance with them
if i was starving.

358
00:42:46,278 --> 00:42:47,321
Hey...

359
00:43:11,598 --> 00:43:12,829
Hey, it was around here.

360
00:43:18,821 --> 00:43:20,408
I'm sure I saw something.

361
00:43:22,873 --> 00:43:24,001
Did we imagine it?

362
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:43,485
What? There's nobody here?

363
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:49,444
Hey!

364
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,123
What?

365
00:44:46,858 --> 00:44:48,206
Someone's looking in here.

366
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,001
Who is it?

367
00:45:22,631 --> 00:45:25,261
You can't trust
any of the men around here!

368
00:45:25,462 --> 00:45:27,287
This will fix him if he tries again.

369
00:45:29,157 --> 00:45:30,526
What's the matter?

370
00:45:31,411 --> 00:45:33,071
Something's wrong with the batteries.

371
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:43,003
Who is it?

372
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:46,549
You heard it?

373
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:03,658
Yokoyama.

374
00:46:06,195 --> 00:46:07,138
Yokoyama!

375
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,728
Was that you?

376
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:11,829
I don't know.

377
00:46:12,029 --> 00:46:13,397
Where did you go just now?

378
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:17,211
I don't need your permission
to use the bathroom!

379
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:26,483
Who's there?

380
00:46:27,268 --> 00:46:28,444
It's us.

381
00:46:29,597 --> 00:46:30,814
What is this?

382
00:46:33,637 --> 00:46:36,123
We're sure someone's walking
on the deck.

383
00:46:38,243 --> 00:46:39,461
Could it be Kasai?

384
00:47:18,887 --> 00:47:22,250
Who are you?! Stay away!

385
00:47:27,841 --> 00:47:29,284
What happened, Kasai?

386
00:47:30,245 --> 00:47:32,706
What happened? What's the matter?

387
00:47:39,508 --> 00:47:40,676
Hey!

388
00:47:47,061 --> 00:47:49,547
Yokoyama! Yoshida! Wake up!

389
00:48:34,756 --> 00:48:36,801
What's wrong with all of you?

390
00:48:38,344 --> 00:48:42,309
In Tokyo, you guys know
how to get around.

391
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:46,834
But on this ship
you've become idiots...

392
00:48:46,835 --> 00:48:48,765
seeing ghosts in your head
and believing it's haunted!

393
00:48:48,837 --> 00:48:52,348
There's a reason for this,
and I know what it is.

394
00:48:52,449 --> 00:48:53,849
It's these women.

395
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,951
They're on your mind all the time
and you can't do anything about it!

396
00:48:56,952 --> 00:48:59,452
That's what's wrong with everyone.

397
00:48:59,553 --> 00:49:02,380
It gets to me too,
and drives me crazy!

398
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:07,121
Tonight,
I may just do something with you.

399
00:49:07,122 --> 00:49:09,307
Are you men going to let him
behave this way?

400
00:49:21,868 --> 00:49:24,246
None of them seem to give a damn.

401
00:49:24,714 --> 00:49:26,282
Damn!

402
00:49:27,985 --> 00:49:29,946
- I'll kill you!
- Come on!

403
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,284
- Stop it!
- Let go!

404
00:49:37,483 --> 00:49:39,126
That's enough of this!

405
00:49:41,504 --> 00:49:43,405
Something else about her...

406
00:49:43,506 --> 00:49:46,887
she goes into the jungle
with the writer quite a lot.

407
00:49:47,614 --> 00:49:50,535
Seems they're carrying more
than just water.

408
00:49:50,536 --> 00:49:53,021
What do you know of my affairs?!

409
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,828
Hey... she's not denying it!

410
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:03,036
I know what woman Mami is.

411
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:06,242
I don't need you to tell me.

412
00:50:06,243 --> 00:50:09,665
He's right.
I used you to get one thing.

413
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:12,267
Europe is what I wanted, not you.

414
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,038
I've always found you repulsive.

415
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:16,278
What?

416
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,717
Stop This !

417
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:22,615
Yokoyama,
are you sure we saw a ghost?

418
00:50:23,593 --> 00:50:25,378
What do you think?

419
00:50:25,379 --> 00:50:27,131
Come here.

420
00:50:27,173 --> 00:50:28,516
Yoshida, you too.

421
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:41,668
I suppose that's our imagination.

422
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,421
Let's stop fighting each other.

423
00:50:45,422 --> 00:50:49,630
We have to find food and fix
the yacht so we can get away.

424
00:50:49,815 --> 00:50:51,716
Is that all you've got to say?

425
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:55,632
All he's done is carry
that gun around,

426
00:50:55,633 --> 00:50:57,234
and what can he show for it?

427
00:50:57,235 --> 00:51:01,065
- Hey!
- Yeah, let me finish!

428
00:51:01,066 --> 00:51:03,069
There's a lot of
grass growing around here.

429
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:04,771
You can eat the roots!

430
00:51:05,172 --> 00:51:07,759
You can eat the roots
of a lot of plants!

431
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,361
You never thought of that,
did you?!

432
00:51:11,513 --> 00:51:13,385
What have you
brought back for us?

433
00:51:14,286 --> 00:51:15,387
You!

434
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:20,278
In Tokyo you use your head
to make money...

435
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:22,680
but it's not worth a damn here!

436
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:26,560
Here you have to work, so get
to work if you want to eat!

437
00:51:28,939 --> 00:51:30,324
Hey!

438
00:51:31,409 --> 00:51:33,614
College professor... writer...

439
00:51:34,116 --> 00:51:36,417
you have to go out searching
regardless if it's raining or not!

440
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,186
A miracle won't fall out of the sky!

441
00:51:40,606 --> 00:51:44,069
Just because it's raining
doesn't mean that we stop working!

442
00:51:44,412 --> 00:51:46,884
You don't mind getting wet
when you're swimming,

443
00:51:46,985 --> 00:51:48,886
this shouldn't be any different!

444
00:52:04,775 --> 00:52:08,110
<i>Akiko... Akiko!

445
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,570
<i>Akiko... it's mother.

446
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,538
I'm stopping.

447
00:52:57,157 --> 00:53:00,005
Even if we fix the ship,
we can't leave without food.

448
00:53:00,206 --> 00:53:01,707
I'm going to look for some.

449
00:53:58,156 --> 00:54:00,134
What are you looking at?

450
00:54:00,335 --> 00:54:01,520
What are you doing?

451
00:54:02,646 --> 00:54:04,547
What's it look like?

452
00:54:04,648 --> 00:54:07,570
I wonder who stole the food
from us the other night?

453
00:54:08,714 --> 00:54:11,293
I suppose the ghost stole the
key and got into the locker.

454
00:54:11,294 --> 00:54:14,366
Oh, that. It's too bad
I couldn't hold on to him.

455
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:16,344
You liar!

456
00:54:16,745 --> 00:54:19,550
Where did you get the idea
to show us empty cans

457
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:21,552
and claim some ghost did it?

458
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,847
We knew it was you who
did it all along,

459
00:54:27,549 --> 00:54:30,651
but we wanted
to stop another argument.

460
00:54:32,178 --> 00:54:35,185
You're pretty good
at finding fault in others,

461
00:54:35,787 --> 00:54:38,789
but you better watch your own steps.

462
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:48,219
What are you doing?

463
00:54:49,513 --> 00:54:51,129
Don't worry.

464
00:54:51,431 --> 00:54:55,333
I'm going to hunt down
the monster that everyone saw.

465
00:54:55,673 --> 00:54:57,752
Yoshida, you can't do that!

466
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:59,764
We don't know if it's a man!

467
00:54:59,765 --> 00:55:03,028
He could be a survivor of the ship!

468
00:55:03,129 --> 00:55:06,291
I hope that it is a man
so I can have a talk with him.

469
00:55:08,052 --> 00:55:10,633
I'll be very interested to hear
what he says.

470
00:55:10,634 --> 00:55:13,436
A man thinks strange things
when he's out of his mind.

471
00:55:14,037 --> 00:55:17,068
His reality may be
more interesting than ours,

472
00:55:17,069 --> 00:55:19,271
and it wouldn't matter what he ate.

473
00:55:20,672 --> 00:55:23,777
Yoshida!

474
00:56:41,403 --> 00:56:44,501
We didn't get much
after working all day.

475
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:47,471
But we worked hard
and did as much as we could.

476
00:56:47,513 --> 00:56:48,915
You're right.

477
00:57:05,191 --> 00:57:06,442
Sakuda!

478
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:19,681
Knock before you come in.

479
00:57:28,353 --> 00:57:29,939
I'll hold onto these.

480
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:38,953
We can't trust you.

481
00:57:39,997 --> 00:57:42,125
You'll sleep
with the rest of us tonight.

482
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,513
I sleep better when I'm alone.

483
00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:46,841
You're going to work
like everyone too!

484
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:48,928
Bastard!

485
00:57:49,687 --> 00:57:53,623
Who in the world helped you
when your brother was ill?

486
00:57:53,624 --> 00:57:57,025
I put you in college
and gave you a job in my company!

487
00:57:57,026 --> 00:57:58,652
That's right.

488
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:04,953
I thought you were my friend,
but you were just using me too!

489
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:16,590
Great!

490
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:18,476
Then how about these?

491
00:58:20,379 --> 00:58:22,525
What eggs are those?

492
00:58:22,526 --> 00:58:27,949
Turtle, the top of the line.
There's two for each, 14 in all.

493
00:58:38,425 --> 00:58:40,886
You don't get any
if you're empty-handed.

494
00:58:42,156 --> 00:58:44,976
I don't care,
I'm not hungry anymore.

495
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:50,702
Hey, did you eat
some of those mushrooms?

496
00:58:51,287 --> 00:58:54,278
Well, I wonder...

497
00:58:54,979 --> 00:58:57,080
Anyway, don't make anything for me.

498
00:59:08,957 --> 00:59:11,136
Alright, I'll give you ¥10,000 each.

499
00:59:11,177 --> 00:59:12,263
It's not enough.

500
00:59:12,264 --> 00:59:15,024
Yesterday you charged ¥5000 each!

501
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:19,073
The market for eggs
won't last for long.

502
00:59:23,122 --> 00:59:25,584
Alright... ¥200,000, okay?

503
00:59:27,947 --> 00:59:30,008
It's a gamble.

504
00:59:30,992 --> 00:59:33,471
Will I be able to use it or not?

505
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:37,849
I'll do my best
to get off this island,

506
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,152
even if I have to kill
everyone here to do it!

507
01:00:19,587 --> 01:00:20,891
So that's your game,

508
01:00:20,892 --> 01:00:22,293
you bastard!

509
01:00:22,893 --> 01:00:24,220
You bastard!

510
01:00:28,326 --> 01:00:30,388
I'll kill you!
- Come on!

511
01:00:36,414 --> 01:00:37,416
Sakuda!

512
01:00:49,293 --> 01:00:51,004
Hey! Stop it!

513
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,434
- Stop it!
- Yoshida!

514
01:00:54,077 --> 01:00:55,395
Stop it now!

515
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:09,885
He was with her.

516
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:11,129
Is this about jealousy?

517
01:01:13,132 --> 01:01:14,718
We agreed to leave them alone.

518
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,262
You had no right to fight!

519
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,270
All of them want me.

520
01:01:39,633 --> 01:01:41,135
I'll kill you all.

521
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,391
He's mad!

522
01:01:46,085 --> 01:01:49,548
I ate some mushrooms. Now you know.

523
01:01:51,535 --> 01:01:53,936
I read a long time ago

524
01:01:54,638 --> 01:01:58,298
that mexicans ate them
in order to increase their perception

525
01:01:58,299 --> 01:02:00,200
and gain a sense of well being.

526
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:01,460
Don't move!

527
01:02:03,288 --> 01:02:06,040
Japanese legends mention
laughing mushrooms,

528
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:08,042
so I'm in good company.

529
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:10,891
The people who gathered them

530
01:02:10,892 --> 01:02:12,772
danced in high spirits
on the mountains

531
01:02:12,773 --> 01:02:14,574
and were in touch with the gods.

532
01:02:14,715 --> 01:02:18,551
Matango, according to your thinking,
means a person no longer human.

533
01:02:19,353 --> 01:02:21,170
That's fine by me.

534
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,373
Because when I kill you,
I won't be commiting any crime.

535
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,638
I understand.

536
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:30,742
We won't stand in your way.
Do anything you like.

537
01:02:30,942 --> 01:02:32,302
I will.

538
01:02:33,327 --> 01:02:35,629
The truth is...

539
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:39,257
I like Akiko better than Mami,

540
01:02:40,659 --> 01:02:42,460
so after you're all dead...

541
01:02:58,936 --> 01:03:00,497
Let me go!

542
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,724
Get up!

543
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:10,954
Move!

544
01:03:22,016 --> 01:03:23,260
What's wrong?

545
01:03:26,807 --> 01:03:27,768
Get in!

546
01:03:31,733 --> 01:03:32,818
Hey!

547
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,012
What's the matter?

548
01:03:43,313 --> 01:03:44,808
You're going to start living
with the rest of us!

549
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:47,571
Sakuda!

550
01:04:07,123 --> 01:04:08,342
It looks good.

551
01:04:14,303 --> 01:04:16,824
You've done a lot to the yacht.

552
01:04:18,227 --> 01:04:21,708
- Isn't it ready to go yet?
- Are you going to help?

553
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,211
Yes, in any way.

554
01:04:27,302 --> 01:04:31,643
The truth is, can I talk to you?

555
01:04:31,945 --> 01:04:35,848
What do you plan to do
now that everything is different?

556
01:04:35,849 --> 01:04:37,478
Hey, are you listening to me?

557
01:04:37,479 --> 01:04:38,480
Yes.

558
01:04:39,991 --> 01:04:43,289
There's 24 cans of food left.
Not much.

559
01:04:45,326 --> 01:04:48,022
But for two people... maybe ten days.

560
01:04:49,558 --> 01:04:52,022
Hey, how about the two of us leaving?

561
01:04:52,624 --> 01:04:55,654
If we had potatoes and seaweed,
we could last for weeks!

562
01:04:56,156 --> 01:04:57,605
There's plenty of water.

563
01:04:57,606 --> 01:05:00,705
I'm sure the two of us could stay
alive for at least three weeks or so!

564
01:05:01,207 --> 01:05:04,419
We could be found by a ship,
or maybe find another island.

565
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:05,554
Get out!

566
01:05:06,833 --> 01:05:07,875
I see.

567
01:05:17,969 --> 01:05:20,848
The weak restraints
of society disintegrate

568
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:24,281
in the face of the will
to survive in harsh circumstances.

569
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:31,051
The worse things get here,
the worst we behave.

570
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:36,744
Is there a way
to change everyone's feelings?

571
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:42,555
They made a mess here, huh ?

572
01:05:54,853 --> 01:05:56,297
What happened, Kasai?

573
01:06:07,401 --> 01:06:10,481
It's Sakuda!
He stole the canned food and left!

574
01:06:19,665 --> 01:06:20,866
Damn!

575
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:35,744
Damn! He's gone!

576
01:06:36,428 --> 01:06:39,801
I guess he didn't think
any of us were worth saving.

577
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:46,295
I don't think he ever had
a high opinion of us,

578
01:06:46,696 --> 01:06:49,519
but now that doesn't make
any difference.

579
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,983
It's my turn to do something.

580
01:06:52,284 --> 01:06:55,488
Mami, bring the girl over here.

581
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:04,505
- Bastard!
- No! Let go! Let me go!

582
01:07:04,506 --> 01:07:06,534
I'm going to kill you both.

583
01:07:06,936 --> 01:07:09,931
Start walking down the deck
and don't try anything funny.

584
01:07:09,973 --> 01:07:11,075
Teacher!

585
01:07:12,378 --> 01:07:15,567
I wonder how many times I wrote
something like this in my novels?

586
01:07:21,195 --> 01:07:22,155
Yokoyama!

587
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:42,116
Get out of here!

588
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,669
- Kasai...
- You too!

589
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,642
Please, I beg you!

590
01:07:58,237 --> 01:08:02,369
You wanted to be with him, get going!

591
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:10,124
I bet this didn't happen
in your damn books!

592
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:22,647
Stop it!

593
01:09:33,194 --> 01:09:35,656
It's been raining for a week now.

594
01:09:36,582 --> 01:09:38,820
It must be it's raining season.

595
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:40,224
If you're right,

596
01:09:40,526 --> 01:09:43,095
we won't be able
to live here very long.

597
01:09:43,296 --> 01:09:45,958
Do you know anywhere else we can go?

598
01:09:46,059 --> 01:09:49,765
We'll have to find a place.
Maybe we can find a cave.

599
01:09:51,752 --> 01:09:52,938
Morai...

600
01:09:55,034 --> 01:09:56,778
I'm finished... I can't go on.

601
01:10:01,045 --> 01:10:04,918
Kasai, no matter how we feel,
we can't give up.

602
01:10:06,379 --> 01:10:08,242
How can we live if we do nothing?!

603
01:10:08,243 --> 01:10:09,544
Stop it!

604
01:10:14,309 --> 01:10:16,815
I wish you'd hurry and kill me.

605
01:10:21,366 --> 01:10:25,029
I don't even have
the courage to kill myself.

606
01:10:28,335 --> 01:10:30,172
Don't say such things!

607
01:10:31,967 --> 01:10:33,754
Anyway, relax for today.

608
01:10:34,055 --> 01:10:38,236
He's right.
You rest here while we go out.

609
01:10:39,197 --> 01:10:42,369
We're tough enough to survive,
and so are you.

610
01:10:42,645 --> 01:10:43,989
Let's go.

611
01:11:10,379 --> 01:11:11,581
Mami!

612
01:11:16,273 --> 01:11:19,930
You're still alive! How did you do it?

613
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:24,012
I haven't been hungry since I left.

614
01:11:28,721 --> 01:11:32,869
Mami... help me! I beg you!

615
01:11:40,684 --> 01:11:46,353
I've waited a long time for that...
you begging for help.

616
01:11:47,379 --> 01:11:50,560
Now you know how it feels
to be desperate for help.

617
01:11:53,523 --> 01:11:56,655
I'll help you... we'll go together.

618
01:12:11,356 --> 01:12:14,933
The rainfall is making the
mushrooms big and strong

619
01:12:14,934 --> 01:12:16,950
with each pitter-patter.

620
01:12:16,951 --> 01:12:18,737
Where is the food?

621
01:12:18,738 --> 01:12:20,264
A little further.

622
01:12:34,282 --> 01:12:35,884
Walk this way.

623
01:12:47,506 --> 01:12:51,354
It's delicious.
We should have eaten them sooner.

624
01:14:40,805 --> 01:14:42,796
I should have told you
that once you eat the mushrooms,

625
01:14:42,797 --> 01:14:44,803
you become a mushroom.

626
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:50,254
That's why all of the mirrors
on the ship were removed.

627
01:14:51,357 --> 01:14:54,103
But once you eat them, you can't stop.

628
01:14:56,457 --> 01:14:57,442
Yoshida!

629
01:16:05,608 --> 01:16:06,668
Kasai!

630
01:16:37,984 --> 01:16:39,169
He's not here.

631
01:16:43,544 --> 01:16:44,620
Teacher!

632
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:52,310
We're not beaten. We're not beaten!

633
01:17:19,651 --> 01:17:21,112
Hey!

634
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:57,069
Sakuda!

635
01:18:16,088 --> 01:18:19,738
Masoko Kasai, Kenji Morai,
Etsuro Yoshida,

636
01:18:19,939 --> 01:18:23,443
Senzo Yokoyama,
Mami Sekimuchi, Akiko Soma...

637
01:18:23,644 --> 01:18:27,009
These people are stranded
on a deserted Island.

638
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:31,047
I went out on this ship
to try and find some help,

639
01:18:31,148 --> 01:18:33,447
but I couldn't make it
and died out at sea.

640
01:18:33,521 --> 01:18:35,693
Captain Aoyuki Sakuda.

641
01:18:36,394 --> 01:18:37,495
Damn!

642
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:18,042
I found the yacht.

643
01:19:19,003 --> 01:19:22,468
The yacht?!
Then, Sakuda came back ?

644
01:19:24,295 --> 01:19:27,918
Sakuda died at sea.
The yacht drifted back here.

645
01:19:32,569 --> 01:19:36,877
Then no one has ever left
this island, huh?

646
01:19:50,117 --> 01:19:52,262
Is this all you could find
this morning ?

647
01:19:53,616 --> 01:19:54,859
I couldn't find anything !

648
01:19:57,971 --> 01:19:59,994
Hey... we could eat these mushrooms.

649
01:20:00,236 --> 01:20:02,140
You'd turn into a mushroom!

650
01:20:02,141 --> 01:20:03,241
But...

651
01:20:03,942 --> 01:20:05,788
- Mami and Kasai seem to...
- Idiot!

652
01:20:06,789 --> 01:20:08,310
They're already half-mushroom!

653
01:20:09,011 --> 01:20:10,358
That's alright.

654
01:20:10,959 --> 01:20:14,262
If there's a way off this Island,
perhaps it's the only way to live...

655
01:20:17,569 --> 01:20:18,937
I shouldn't have done that.

656
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:22,614
Teacher... I can't do it!

657
01:20:22,815 --> 01:20:27,712
I can't behave like you!
I can't! I can't do it!

658
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,403
I wish I were dead!

659
01:20:33,982 --> 01:20:38,372
Akiko... we're not
going to become mushrooms!

660
01:20:40,184 --> 01:20:41,195
Teacher...!

661
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,219
We'll do it... right?

662
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:01,681
We'll spend the day... no...

663
01:21:01,782 --> 01:21:05,981
we'll get all the food that we
can carry and get off this island!

664
01:23:13,873 --> 01:23:14,875
Teacher!

665
01:24:02,278 --> 01:24:03,430
Akiko!

666
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:24,888
Teacher!

667
01:25:26,449 --> 01:25:28,978
Where are you? Akiko!

668
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:31,332
- Teacher!
- Akiko!

669
01:25:37,235 --> 01:25:39,371
- Akiko!
- Teacher!

670
01:25:45,366 --> 01:25:48,313
They're delicious! It's true!

671
01:25:54,024 --> 01:25:56,403
Idiot! Let's go!

672
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:03,150
Teacher!

673
01:27:49,017 --> 01:27:51,317
Then, the night came...

674
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:53,120
and the morning came...

675
01:27:53,321 --> 01:27:55,002
and the night came again...

676
01:27:57,632 --> 01:27:59,577
I don't remember when i was rescued.

677
01:28:02,142 --> 01:28:04,294
But, now I'm sorry that I was.

678
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:07,756
If I was really in love with Akiko,

679
01:28:07,857 --> 01:28:11,760
I should have eaten the mushrooms
with her and become one.

680
01:28:12,261 --> 01:28:14,623
At least we would have been together.

681
01:28:14,724 --> 01:28:16,424
Isn't that it?

682
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:19,026
If I really wanted to live,

683
01:28:19,928 --> 01:28:23,838
I shouldn't have been
so stupid and eaten one.

684
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:27,148
With all the pain...

685
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:29,151
all the suffering...

686
01:28:29,152 --> 01:28:32,154
all my sadness... would have
disappeared by eating them!

687
01:28:33,716 --> 01:28:36,487
How in the world can i face myself?!

688
01:28:40,185 --> 01:28:43,588
No, no. You should
consider yourself fortunate.

689
01:28:43,589 --> 01:28:45,479
You were found and brought home.

690
01:28:45,981 --> 01:28:47,591
Is that so?

691
01:28:48,701 --> 01:28:50,963
Tokyo is not very different
from that island.

692
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:54,953
People in the city
are just as cruel, aren't they?

693
01:28:56,573 --> 01:28:58,169
It's all the same.

694
01:28:58,570 --> 01:29:01,223
I would have been happier
on the island.

695
01:29:24,011 --> 01:29:26,715
