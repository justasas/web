00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,900
BODEGA BAY INN
1939

2
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,000
Hey!

3
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,560
How are you doing there?

4
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,690
- Uh, doing great! It's going to work.
- Very good, dude!

5
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Many of those chair for, though,
wedding reception tomorrow, right?

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,860
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'll be ready.

7
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,850
- Everything OK, Danny?
- Yeah.

8
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,700
It's kind of just ... uh...

9
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,600
You know, the same with the party upstair.

10
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,880
It sounds like fun.

11
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,180
Groups of soldiers shipping out tomorrow morning.

12
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,510
They deserve to have some fun
the last night here.

13
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,310
It will sound as gone with me!

14
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,850
I know you do, my boy, I know!

15
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,520
- Not everybody's concern!
- Yeah, it's not fair!

16
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,440
You'll be claimed for the debt toll you didn't....

17
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,320
review us more than a wealth,

18
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,940
for a while they're not as such you're going to making.

19
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,280
- It's time that we say "hadn't".
- Gosh, don't mean that!

20
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,660
Take a look at what was the values of your mother and your brother, huh!

21
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,910
But now all I am is a useless cripple.

22
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,330
A useless forehand cripple!

23
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,120
Useless?

24
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,760
What if this kind is going to shift, Danny?

25
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,220
As a gift!

26
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,510
Watch work you can do with you hands.

27
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,970
Yeah, but if I really have a rifle in my hands,

28
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,900
- going after the Jap. for the crowd!
- I know!

29
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,190
Is Mr. Toulon still staying here?

30
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,280
He did his room upstairs.
Wonderful old man!

31
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,280
Ah, he was an Europe, you know.
He was fighting for Nazi.

32
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,250
Now, that what he said,

33
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,620
but sometimes I think he's prone to talk tails.

34
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,240
No, Uncle Len, it's true.

35
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,290
You know, the Nazi killed his wife,

36
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,210
because he did some puppet show
that was making fun of Hitler.

37
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,080
Mr. Toulon said the Nazi want to steal his puppets.

38
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,000
So now he even have
a special hiding place,

39
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,700
so they don't fall in the wrong hands.

40
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,510
Now, why would the Nazi want to kill his puppets?

41
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,930
Because he has a secret.

42
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,000
He can make them move without the strings.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,900
- Oh, I'm sorry!
- No, uncle Len, it's true, really!  I've seen it.

44
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,600
You know, he said
he might even teach me how he does it.

45
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,810
We'll come to think of it,
maybe he has some works for you.

46
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,800
Well, maybe you can help him with those puppets such as repairing them, picking them up,

47
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,780
that source of things.
Ever thought of that?

48
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,700
I guess you're right.
I suppose I can ask him.

49
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,800
Oh, you should!

50
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,900
Perhaps when you're done over here,
I'm not going to have any work for you.

51
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,250
Not for a while, anyway!

52
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,910
And you know if I work for Mr. Tulong,
I can stay here longer,

53
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,430
- and send the money to my mom.
- I know your mother,

54
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,630
she'd to see you again, as she misses you.

55
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,960
- And so is your brother.
- Yeah, I know.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,590
I miss them, too.

57
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,850
But...  But you don't want to couch up here
with your own lovely, huh?

58
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,600
Well, you rather be oversea fighting.

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,900
Hopefully the war will be over soon,
then we wouldn't need to fight anymore.

60
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,230
But I want you to get your work back, Danny.

61
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,110
I'll tell the cook have dinner prepared for you in the kitchen when you're done, huh!

62
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,440
How about a nice steak, some asparagus?

63
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,400
- How would that be, huh?
- Thank you, Uncle Len.

64
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay!

65
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,800
Mr. Tulong?
Are you all right?

66
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,970
Mr. Tulong?

67
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,980
Oh, my God!

68
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,000
PUPPET MASTER

69
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:08,300
Axis of Evil

70
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,670
What the devil!

71
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,550
- Danny!
- Mom!

72
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,800
- Oh, oh!
- It's great to see you!

73
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,650
I didn't think you're be back till next week.

74
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,640
- Your uncle Lenny said...
- Oh, yeah! We finihsed so early.

75
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,230
What's all this?

76
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,500
Oh, just stuff that I'm working on.

77
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,440
- Oh, I'll take care of this one in my room.
- Oh, leave it!

78
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,400
Let me have a look at you.

79
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,650
I wear, you're getting taller.

80
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,780
Mom, I've already been gone for three weeks.

81
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,700
But for sure you lost weight.

82
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,300
Sit down!  Let me have some food in here off-

83
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,200
Ahh, let me take the stuff to my room first.

84
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,450
Nonsense!
Leave it!

85
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,750
Sit down, I'll take care of a quick one.

86
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,150
- Look out!
- Come on!

87
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,480
God!  You know I'll sneak upon you!

88
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,020
- Oh, how the hell are you, little brother?
- I'm good.

89
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,650
Did uncle Len spoiled you, got
the 20 years old Scotchie, Kid?

90
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,990
Ay, come on!
You know I didn't get any Scotch.

91
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,750
What?

92
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,910
Oh, that right!
You are a noble teen, man!

93
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,200
Ah, very funny!

94
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,660
- You look good!
- Yeah, I didn't think you're still be home.

95
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't ship out another week.

96
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,370
- You know where you are going yet?
- No, not yet!

97
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,670
I hope it's not Japan.

98
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,200
It looks like the reserved already!

99
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,900
- And?
- So I ran on all outside, by the Splatty Isle.

100
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,510
Well,  our own heart, Donny, there is Chinese, not Japanese.

101
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,760
Oh, what's the difference?

102
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,810
For they've never given us a lot of trouble
in all the years we've been here.

103
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,900
Yeah, well, after the war, I am to make enough of money to get you out the China Town, Mom.

104
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,950
I'm hoping that they'll send me to Eroupe.

105
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,730
- Wow, good cherry!
-  Yeah, look at my hands on them.

106
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,850
Hurry up!
it's cold over there now, though.

107
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,700
It's going to free my ass off!

108
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,950
- Then you get to watch out the frenzy tank today,
- Oh, yeah!

109
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,620
I am not talking about the war.

110
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,870
What else should I talk about?

111
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,080
How about baseball, or
the nice weather we are having?

112
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,090
Mom, come on!
The war is what matter right now.

113
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,010
I just don't like to think about it.
That's all !

114
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,470
Little idea, if one of my boys
getting hurt over there....

115
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,050
I'll be OK, Mom!

116
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,260
God willing!

117
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,060
Talking now,
I would have going there with you, right?

118
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,520
I know, little brother.

119
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,230
Think about what would do to Mom.

120
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,360
I know the Mitchels on the street,

121
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,600
they got 3 boys serving.
Two in France, and one in Japan.

122
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,530
Yeah, Dan, have you seen Mrs Mitchel latetly?

123
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,030
Look like she waits 30 years.

124
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,450
You can't do that to Mom.

125
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,410
Our mom can handle it better than
Mts. Mitchell.

126
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,450
Yeah, look, what's your idea?
- Nothing, Mom!

127
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,650
- Two in the brink
- Oh, no!  No!

128
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,400
I don't want to be stuck here.

129
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,080
Uh, I love you, Mom, but...

130
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,800
I should be shooting a count-a-thon,

131
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,900
and I'll be going to serve,
because I'm not a God dammed cripple!

132
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,850
- Danny!
- Well, it's true.

133
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,800
Well, you may think your leg a curse,
but to me it's a blessing.

134
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,890
It keeps you home with me
and away from harm.

135
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,560
Now, the only reason known to talk about,

136
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,270
I'll till go other there and fight.

137
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,550
- I know I could.
- Oh, honey!

138
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,100
Nobody says you can't, Dan.
Just...

139
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,150
wait the ball bounce.

140
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,780
You have to do what you can,
from here in the home front.

141
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,900
Now like what?
Sewing furniture?

142
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,530
Come on, may I not stick to the axes, all right?

143
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,790
No, no!  Now I think you got something.

144
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,540
Why don't you ... uh...
build a special chair...

145
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,870
for Hitler?

146
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,600
He goes to sit down, and... whem!

147
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,090
Be here to right in with that!

148
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,000
Don!

149
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,500
You think he can make this thing
moving out street?

150
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,400
I saw it.

151
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,740
Must be some source of cheap magic chock-full.

152
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,660
I don't know.
There is nothing cheap about it.

153
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,950
You know, that's why he can kill himself.

154
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,650
'Cause he didn't like to
hand over the secret to the Nazi.

155
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,750
Nazi?

156
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,580
Come on!  You tell me...

157
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,580
that Nazi makes the trip all the way here...

158
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,900
to take some little puppet from an old man?

159
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,840
Half the world far even for fast eagle, buddy!

160
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,650
How smart!
It's not the puppet that they wanted.

161
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,550
It's just the secret of
whatever makes them move.

162
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,390
As well, I think you've been reading
too many of those faults.

163
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,650
Ah!

164
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,570
What's this?

165
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,800
I'll look.
Since it seems to take so long to repair.

166
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,410
Oh-ho!

167
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,120
Six arms, huh?

168
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,600
That's all we need to get the crown.

169
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,710
Hey, dare you, dirty Nazi!

170
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,920
I don't even need a gun to kill those bastards.

171
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,420
You know how great I am
in sneaking up to people?

172
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,180
Uh, point is you're up to remind me.

173
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,760
You know, I stay my short
when you get me up earlier.

174
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,550
Ah, to big to meet the Japan?

175
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,020
I need my skill,

176
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,100
sneak up all those Jap in the jungle.

177
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,520
Yeah, I bet you would.

178
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,900
Hey, today I do double deal downtown tonight,
you want to go?

179
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,120
Ahh, I don't know.
I think I might stay and look on the puppets.

180
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,950
Come on, forget the puppets.

181
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,790
They are not going anywhere.

182
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,120
Let's have some fun together,

183
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,750
I'm only here another week.

184
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,330
Call up that cute girl of your,
what her name?

185
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,700
- Beth.
- Beth, she the dame, huh!

186
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Hey, have her bring her sister.
She gets one.

187
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,000
All right!

188
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,150
Yes?

189
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,110
We are looking for Rose in Vermont.

190
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,240
My master is dead.

191
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,830
It is a dramatic chapter to me.

192
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,550
A woman?

193
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,750
You stomach must be refreshing.

194
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,170
I will defy again, using your weapon.

195
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:48,300
Do we here a contact to Thomas,
what happened to him?

196
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,060
As you know, Thomas was a traitor as an American,

197
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,440
a fascist seems the fact,

198
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,360
a big columnist,

199
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,070
until aligns himself with the German.

200
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,600
Such as youself.

201
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,200
As well as the Japanese.

202
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,850
However, the treachery is sent to those
he align himself with.

203
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,300
When he  betrays him,
in a sense matter,

204
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,500
well, he met with the unfortunate end.

205
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,750
I have taken over his plan to strike...

206
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,600
to the heart of the American war efforts.

207
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,760
We're going through today, if you wish.

208
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,500
Or, you may leave, unharmed.

209
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,480
That's nice, because it easily takes over
the plan to you.

210
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,490
You mean, if you kill me and my men,

211
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,580
or more likely, we will kill each other,

212
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,330
while purpose was that ... uh...

213
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,000
the German and the Japanese are not friend?

214
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,000
Yet, we share our common enemy.

215
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,510
Perhaps we can work together.

216
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,100
Sake?

217
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,640
We're making the American blind bleed.

218
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,120
Let me ask you something.

219
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:40,500
Why is a Japanese woman and I had beautiful Japanese woman that night...

220
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:46,450
hiding in an opera house in the heart of China Town?

221
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,050
There are several places
for a Japanese to hide.

222
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:55,260
Americans can't tell any of us apart, anyway.

223
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,350
For English is very practice,

224
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,310
very commuting,

225
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,440
they have to do something with their head.

226
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,190
But it might work.

227
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,250
Yeah, it might just work.

228
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,530
Oh, there is a hole?

229
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh! No, Beth!

230
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,110
You're waiting right now?

231
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,000
I can!
My lunch is almost still, right?

232
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,750
Sorry!

233
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,420
Offer it,

234
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,630
or resale something to eat?

235
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,000
Not really, I am sorry, Beth.

236
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,880
Now I just got to work on most puppet things.

237
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,420
and I lost such a time.

238
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,510
May be, you came out with something
that might remain in wood,

239
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,510
- like Pinokio, huh?.
- Don't be silly!

240
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,890
What's this?

241
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,480
Beth,
anybody I should be worry about?

242
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,320
He is just one of the guys in the florist,

243
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,490
thanks me for getting of our sub-sprouts.

244
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,030
Are you sure that all?

245
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,160
Do I see your nose growing like Pinokio?

246
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,240
Here's my man,
and you know it's Danny Coogan.

247
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,750
See?

248
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,550
All that you do is
playing around with puppets, huh?

249
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,500
That's your excuse, Coogan?

250
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,800
Hello, Mr. Gifford!

251
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,200
Delayed for your lunch paid,
to get playing around with puppet?

252
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,600
No, I didn't come on that.

253
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,100
I'll say this,

254
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,480
You learn your lesson soon enough,

255
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,650
if some quicker guy comes to the draw,

256
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,770
Delayed for your lunch paid,
to get playing around with puppet?

257
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,940
Yeah, I know.

258
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,690
She got fixed lunch hour, Danny Coogan.

259
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,450
I'm trying to run a plan.

260
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,470
I am doing something for the war.

261
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,800
What happens if my invoices...

262
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,650
don't get by the money my secretary
feels over from the starvation?

263
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,920
It's OK, Mr. Gifford.
Really, I don't mind.

264
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,500
Yeah, while I do!

265
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,550
I don't like you, Coogan.

266
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,150
Young guys like you should be out
fighting in the war,

267
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,250
not playing with the stupid pups.

268
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,250
Well, I would be fighting till I get hurt,

269
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,350
I want to be fighting, but I can't,
because of my legs, OK?

270
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,700
Stop pall it!

271
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,520
The First World War,
I was 15,

272
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,190
I lied about my age
so I shipped over to the France...

273
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,060
to fight for my country.

274
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,730
So, stop winning about your god dammed legs.

275
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,850
Why you-

276
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,570
Yeah, you're going to think twice, Coogan.

277
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,200
Look as you have your girl here,
to save your ass.

278
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,500
Huh, she's doing more
for the country than you are.

279
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,960
You get 10 more minutes, Beth.

280
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,170
You have some sake for him.

281
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,920
Don't mind him, Danny,
forget what he's talking about!

282
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,000
Yeah, he does!

283
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,890
What do you mean?

284
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,160
He is right,
I should be over there fighting.

285
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,560
But your legs...

286
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,810
I shouldn't lie, like he did.

287
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,350
You know, I should find some way around it intead of sitting around here...

288
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,190
feeling sorry for myself.

289
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,400
Danny, so?

290
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,240
Look, honey,
I'll see you later, OK!

291
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,000
Had jerk keep her invite about that!

292
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,850
No, she's not going to
wait for a guy like me.

293
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,510
If I were a great girl like that
I won't be with a cripple anyway.

294
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,090
She, as far as I bet, have some guy to plan.

295
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,760
Probably some guy with big muscles
and really handsome.

296
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:52,730
Some guy is going to do with some
of the plans and go over and serve.

297
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,980
Some guy like that even...

298
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,250
Look at me!

299
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,600
There's a war going on out there...

300
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,000
and I am stuck here talking about
the stupid puppets,

301
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,400
all because of the dammed leg.

302
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,680
Spirit of the 16 nights out!

303
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,610
Oh, my God!

304
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,860
You are alive!

305
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,720
You got to be quiet, OK?

306
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,640
Looking of surprise her!

307
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,940
Look, I'm going to be on time for lunch.
Can you beleive it?

308
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,810
You get to be still now, alright?

309
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,450
What is it?

310
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,280
What's wrong?

311
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,450
Hey, Honey!

312
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,090
Wow, you're right on time for lunch.
Let me call Riffley in.\\\

313
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,400
- Who was that guy?
- Who?

314
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,180
This guy, who was just in here.
Who was that?

315
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,300
That's Ben, I've told you before.

316
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,550
He's one of the guys who work in the florist.

317
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,100
He just needs someone to talk for sometimes.
That's all!

318
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,140
- Well-
- Is there anything you jealous worry about it?

319
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,190
For that you didn't know that his name isn't Ben.

320
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,980
What are you talking about?

321
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:09,500
Your friend, one of the guys who killed
Mr. Toulon at the end of a couple week ago.

322
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,000
Remember, I've told you about it?

323
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,860
Yeah, but...Ben?

324
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,240
His name isn't Ben.
He's a Nazi.

325
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,080
It sounds ridiculous!

326
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,750
I saw his face, Beth!

327
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,660
He bumped into me while
I'm going to help Mr. Toulon.

328
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,250
He looks a little bit different, but
that's definitely him.  I'm sure of it.

329
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,300
Ben, a Nazi?

330
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,300
you're being paranoid, Honey!

331
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,150
I am not being paranoid!

332
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,550
All of the papers are in order,
 I check them myself..

333
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,060
Besides, he's not from Germany, silly.

334
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,520
He's from Burbank, for heaven sake!

335
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,310
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

336
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,570
What is if it matter?
You don't believe me anyway.

337
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,440
Danny, don't feel like that!

338
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,850
Come one, just show me!

339
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,410
- I'll see the Nazi, and I will prove it to you.
- Danny!

340
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,470
Hey, Ben!

341
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,500
Cooken Dagen's going on the way to see you.

342
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,550
No, I got to go with Sank Luis.

343
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,200
Gosh, you got to be kidding me.

344
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,390
- What if Rommy goes down?
- Ahh, we'll see about that.

345
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,980
- Mega interested?
- Oh, lets talk tomorrow.

346
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,070
Yeah, yeah!
I'll see you tonight.

347
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,300
Hi Hitler!

348
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,640
I knows it,
Hitler doesn't want the messy sky.

349
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,350
For nearly a week,

350
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,420
you have been entrenched
within enemy's own backyard.

351
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,400
- No difficulty?
- None.

352
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,610
I've been innate a few friends.

353
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,600
All I have to do is bad mounters.

354
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:45,530
Crowd, with the boys specially used jacks
and a seat right in.

355
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,440
Oh, and talk about baseball,
 and this is the toughest part.

356
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:53,400
Strike, run, error,....

357
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,000
dammed ridiculous source.

358
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,800
It all sounds promising.
Very promising!

359
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:05,300
So, were you able to procure the item?

360
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:08,770
I've been flirting with the
cute girl sitting in the front office.

361
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,270
And she percept nothing?

362
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,060
She's quite taken by me!

363
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,860
What can I say of making my good look?

364
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,490
You, German, are far to satisfy with yourself.

365
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,300
Comfort!

366
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,580
After charming the girl,

367
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,830
there is needy thing new to her office...

368
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,400
to that very bottom.

369
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,300
Good! Very good!

370
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,740
This up here to be the loading bay.

371
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,450
Let see if we get it tonight.

372
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,800
And this...

373
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,460
That is the storage room that's always locked.

374
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,500
No one is allowed in there.

375
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,800
It must be right there
keeping their secret and ingredients.

376
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
- The ingredients?
- Yeah!

377
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:32,680
Tomafi has a theory that
 American are pending to use a new material.

378
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,810
We do not know what is is called,
but it doesn't matter.

379
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,610
This new material...

380
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,550
will increase their bomb payload tensile.

381
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,030
And this secret storage room...

382
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:51,080
appears to be right next to the break room.

383
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,400
Perfect! Perfect!

384
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,450
That's me!

385
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,790
This is a simple device...

386
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,850
but powerful.

387
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,080
Set the timer and we walk away.

388
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,730
Up to this thing.

389
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,980
In 2 days, when you go to work,

390
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,860
leave it in the break room,

391
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,530
set the timer, and exit.

392
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,330
The explosion will ignite the storage room,

393
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,000
and detonating this secret material within.

394
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,250
Setting of a chain reaction.

395
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,460
The entire facility. the workplace,

396
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,960
and also the new bomb designed
for the Egale in a moment...

397
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,500
crippling their war efforts.

398
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,520
I admire your plan. Lovely up!

399
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,100
And your Max,
on your substitute.

400
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,650
Puppet!

401
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,750
Get him!

402
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,850
Get pullet!

403
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,970
- The puppet!
- Puppet?

404
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,800
Your men're puppet  too, ones!

405
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:16,850
won't meet the set to the fight!
Your men're puppet  too, ones!

406
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,600
won't meet the set to the fight!

407
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,640
Kill themselves!

408
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,440
A two counts,...

409
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,400
while we got quite the information pool.

410
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,690
Lucky get you pretty good blade!

411
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,700
Nazi!

412
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,580
Danny?

413
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,120
- What was the noise in here?
- Oh, nothing, Mom.

414
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,880
I'm sorry!
I woke you.

415
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,670
I heard you come home this late.
Is everything OK?

416
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,400
Yeah, everything is fine.

417
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,400
- So that passed./N- It's alright.

418
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,180
So be sure you're home
for dinner tomorrow night.

419
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,350
for having a little celebration for your bother. He 's shipped out soon, you know.

420
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,310
Yeah, I know.
I'll be here.

421
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:47,350
- Good night!
- Night!

422
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,200
Ah!

423
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,750
you are OK, too!

424
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,970
So the blueprint,
the plan with out port!

425
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:27,600
Had Nazi to be able to get in the yank,
since they have the access to the plan.

426
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,940
They're planning on blowing it up.

427
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,100
I got to find the way to stop them.

428
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,100
I know I could count on you guys.

429
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,900
How can I just make
somebody else believes me?

430
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,120
Wait till it up?

431
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,950
I can't sleep.

432
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,840
Oh, wow!
That sandwich's so great!

433
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,340
You leave some to me?

434
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,100
- Yeah, there's plenty.
- Oh, Good!

435
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,180
- Hey, come on!
- Can I talk to you really quick?

436
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,750
You know those puppets
that I show you today, right?

437
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,850
Hey, little brother!
Let me... I want to get some of that.

438
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:08,770
You're robbing me?

439
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,190
And that I'm always spoil you, OK?

440
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,230
Opps, excuse me, Mame!
Nice to meet you!

441
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:21,200
- You've been drinking?
- Just a few...

442
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,790
We're down with the deal double bill downtown.

443
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,410
Can we just saw that last week.

444
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,900
And there we meet Ms. Magentis.

445
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,000
Oh, that's where I saw base girl.

446
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,250
Naval Gail...

447
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,300
and Au Martia.

448
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,800
Anyway, little brother!

449
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,100
There's gem on this girl.

450
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,900
I means they were up to her neck.

451
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,100
Hello!  Oh!  Shtt!

452
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,100
Don't wake Mom.

453
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,100
Hey!  Hey, how's your girl?
How is that going?

454
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,860
- I don't know.
- What? What's wrong?

455
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,850
Just something is not going to work out.

456
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,850
You know, the guys who's not in the plan,
they get their eyes on her.

457
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:08,660
Fuck!
So what?

458
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:16,090
You have got to make sure
you're the only one she's thinking about.

459
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,090
One of those guys goes in you way,
you just...,

460
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:24,390
- So moon bar, right?
- Yes, I guess so.

461
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:28,890
You are better than any of those guys.

462
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,900
Don't you forget that, OK?

463
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,000
Sure, Don!

464
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:39,230
Now, why don't you want
to tell me about the dolls?

465
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,360
The puppets.

466
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,200
Oh, sorry!

467
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,120
What about them?

468
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,580
Now I forget off.
I'll tell you later.

469
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,040
- You sure?
- Yeah.

470
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,000
All right!

471
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,680
He was right.

472
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,940
Even though I can't go oversea and fight,
I can still be my best, right here at home.

473
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,650
Then somebody gets to stop those guys
from blowing the plan, right?

474
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,280
You guys are with me?

475
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:37,670
Come in!

476
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,630
Time free!

477
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,800
Wow, you look great!

478
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:49,390
Well, I have a little freedom aku punya pesta nanti

479
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:54,350
- untuk prajuri spesial ku.
- Uh, thanks, Honey.

480
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,820
Are you okay, Danny?

481
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,900
- I am in the office yesterday....
- Oh, yes, look! Forget about that.

482
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,490
I'm sorry. I'm looking.... looking jerk!

483
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:05,900
Oh, come here, darling,
to show you something!

484
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:09,030
I just wonder if everything is
still okay as we planned.

485
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,990
Yeah, there will be no problem.

486
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,540
What do you mean, Danny?

487
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,650
It look like a blue print.

488
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:17,670
Uh huh, to the plant.
It look like a blue print.

489
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,090
Uh huh, to the plant.

490
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,090
But, how did you get this?

491
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:25,300
From your new friend, Ben.

492
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,200
What?

493
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,970
Yeah, I follow them last night,
at Redondo Port.

494
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:32,060
and he went to the opera in China Town,
not that far from here,

495
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,350
where he met his partner, another Nazi.

496
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,350
And he laugh at-?

497
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:39,600
And three Japs, one of them was a dragon lady,
and they were all in this together, Beth.

498
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,200
In what together?

499
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:45,570
They're planning on blowing the plant.
They have a bomb.

500
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:50,870
- You are really serious, aren't you?
- Yes, look!

501
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,200
The bomb is small to put inside the one has has.

502
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,080
OK?  And they planted on putting it here.
In where there're fewer people.

503
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,330
- When?
- Two days from now.

504
00:47:58,370 --> 00:47:59,960
So, I overheard everything.

505
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,340
Is this the treat,
you got to tell somebody.

506
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,380
Then, he's not going to believe me!

507
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,890
You know, I have a trouble getting you
to believe me, let alone anyone else!

508
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:12,430
I'm the boy who cries "Nazi."

509
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:15,020
What are you going to do?

510
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,980
I'm going down there,
to the Opera House.

511
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:22,480
- Danny!
- Don't worry!  I'm just going take some pictures.

512
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,480
I'll make somebody believe me.

513
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:29,240
- I'll be alright!  For guys's help.
- Who?

514
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,000
They want her if-

515
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,580
Oh, my God!
How are they moving?

516
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,040
Toulon's secret,

517
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,790
I found it.

518
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,540
Sure it!

519
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,260
Ease, go ahead!

520
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:59,890
I'm so sorry, Danny.

521
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,500
Sorry for what?

522
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,190
For not believing you,
you've told me all of this.

523
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:10,900
Look, I need you stay here
and help Mom with the party.

524
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,500
As soon as I am to take it some excuse.

525
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,000
I don't like you to be hurt, Danny.

526
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,200
On the field guys' helping me,
I'll be alright.

527
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:17,250
And don't worry!

528
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,790
Like I said,
I'm just going to take some pictures.

529
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,880
Infernal record!

530
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,220
Shut up, dafter!

531
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:20,560
I take it, you are upset!

532
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,250
Stay calm, Buta.

533
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,250
Our German friend has a temper.

534
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,000
What?

535
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,360
What's happening here?

536
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:37,100
Our disagreement over the difficult taste.

537
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,000
Nothing more, isn't that right,
my dear Klaus?

538
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,710
We don't have time for this nonsense!

539
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,080
A missing maybe in jeopardy.

540
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,790
Because of the boy?

541
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,750
He can't know anything.

542
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:54,680
He does!
He must be taken care of.

543
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,550
How?

544
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,810
They know the phones of Bodega Bay Inn.

545
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:04,150
It seems our boy was doing
furniture for them during his stay.

546
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,250
His address is Los Angeles,

547
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,300
not far from where we are.

548
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:18,070
Once again,
stay as it was.

549
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:27,200
Get the boy and his pups,
 have nothing stands in our way!

550
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,000
- Hi Hitler!
- Fur Führer!

551
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:40,470
Perhaps we should celebrate
our upcoming victory, Ozu.

552
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:43,500
What did you have in your mind,
my dear Max?

553
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,850
Maybe something to unite our partnership.

554
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,100
Do not mistake me
 at our Western hearten,

555
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,500
or one of your German horses,

556
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:58,350
who find your arrogant of Balcon!

557
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:02,100
Have I made my point clear,
my dear Maximilian?

558
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,310
I'll put plum in here, dear.

559
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,730
It looks great, Mrs. Coogan.
I'll put the paper.

560
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:33,320
You get that in the kitchen,
I'll handle things at here.

561
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,250
- You think so?
- I know so, go on.

562
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,400
Okay!

563
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:38,700
Oh!

564
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,250
Oh!

565
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,600
Oh, mine!  What are you doing sneaking
around like that, little Donsy?

566
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,350
- That's what I do, Ma!
- Don!

567
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:46,400
Don, you have put you as little 6.

568
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,370
You ruin the surprise!

569
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,600
Oh! Oh, look at that!
Nice, thanks!

570
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,000
What stands do yo think?

571
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,130
What do you mean?
You know we're having a party?

572
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:01,130
Yeah, but he's wishing he could go over there,
fighting as the rest of us!

573
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,180
This is just a remind him
that he's not going.

574
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,760
- You get to get a party for him, too.
- Well, we are!

575
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:08,310
And, I get a few surprises for him.

576
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,900
I don't know where he got what I bought,

577
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,550
but, I make a beef steak with apple pie.

578
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,000
The pie!

579
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,320
Oh, really I bought it in the pios.
Honey, perfect!

580
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,160
Where is Danny, anyway?

581
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,080
He went to get somewhat skinny stuff, I think.

582
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,870
What's being stuffed?

583
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:30,160
You know, whatever he returned from.

584
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:34,420
Oh, yeah!  Hammer and nails,
all that technical though.

585
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,630
Go on, Don!  Let us have things finished here.
We'll call you when it's ready.

586
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,200
Alright, alright!
I see what's going on here.

587
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:45,180
You guys are shipping me out
before I got shipped out.

588
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,200
Oh!

589
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:54,520
Must be the mailman with
package of the main things.

590
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,020
Yes, can I help you?

591
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:49,740
These pictures, please splash it, please.

592
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,750
You got it down there!

593
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:18,610
Mom?!

594
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,150
Oh, God!
I just want to be with you!

595
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,750
Come on, Don!

596
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,360
Come on, hang on!
I think I can help, come on!

597
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,500
Go! Go ahead...
Oh, God, Beth!

598
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,500
He took Beth.

599
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:12,000
I know that.
Something I can't ... OK?

600
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:18,000
Just go get them!
Look, go get them!

601
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,450
Don!

602
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,000
Don!
Don!

603
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,150
No!

604
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:36,000
Don!

605
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,540
I'm going to get those bastard, Don.

606
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,330
You get to help me.

607
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,540
As far as you can keep on living, OK?

608
00:57:57,850 --> 00:58:02,640
As long as we don't the inside Jap.!

609
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,680
Just please work!

610
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:44,690
Come on!

611
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,000
Come on!

612
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,350
How do you feel?

613
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,360
I know it's really good with you filled in.

614
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,500
Wow!

615
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,150
Stop!

616
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:14,530
But, she again, will be the last thing,
do you remember?

617
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,350
I apology for the tied down.

618
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,830
You know better than they are.

619
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,330
To you perhaps it may seem that way,

620
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:29,250
but again, I apology.

621
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,090
I don't care about your apology.

622
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:35,630
Right now I should let you know
my name is not Ben.

623
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:38,200
You are Nazi, just play the others set.

624
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,260
A soldier who following order.

625
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,600
- For Hitler.
- The leader of the new world.

626
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:49,140
Not of our voice has anything to say about it.

627
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,200
What's going on here?

628
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,860
Your men are savaged!

629
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,000
They are men,
with the needs and desires of men.

630
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,050
I see!

631
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:04,450
To my desire, the men should be denied.

632
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:07,450
If it's the desire of your men, your animals,

633
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,370
must be granted, is that it?

634
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:18,350
Don't be jealous,
that's not be fitted a little.

635
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:31,400
The task is still here,
in the center of the stage.

636
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,610
So that no one can attemp to free her without a fee.

637
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:35,820
I understand,

638
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:38,110
but does that mean she must be toyed with?

639
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,600
Why do you care?

640
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,700
She's nothing but this.

641
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,280
Does that  a guest worm in a hook still attract the fish?

642
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,450
She is not a worm.

643
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,750
It seems you have developed feeling
for a fellow child.

644
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:55,170
Do not let this... cloud your judges.

645
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,020
I help you done expect me to thank you.

646
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,150
No, I don't expect you to understand either.

647
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,230
What don't I understand?

648
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:21,280
You can never understand the cause
which I am fighting for.

649
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:25,320
Slottering of innocent people by a mad dictator?

650
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:28,240
It's not a cause,
it's an evil.

651
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,910
You'll never to hit freedom nor democracy.

652
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,450
Such a strong domine!

653
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:41,550
Perhaps in a different time and a different life,

654
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,050
we could mean something to each other.

655
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,800
I'm better to be dead!

656
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:50,270
You may trust what you wish!

657
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,890
Take the bomb.

658
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:46,780
Can you hear me?

659
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,250
Can you?

660
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,150
Excellent!

661
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:55,340
Yes.
It is going well here, Commander.

662
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,080
Shall we think for the arrival of the boy?

663
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:03,850
Yes.  He will be killed,

664
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:07,710
as well the two German.

665
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:12,050
And we will take the point, secret.

666
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:15,550
The one the German are so eager take control.

667
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:20,360
Yes, it will belong to Japan,
to the Emperor.

668
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,650
Hello!  Hello?
Commander?

669
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:44,290
You'll never win the war.

670
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,500
You might kill me and Danny,

671
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:50,960
even if you blow the plan,
you still won't win.

672
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:53,760
Did your mother know
what you do for a living?

673
01:06:53,950 --> 01:06:57,470
Heaven will see if  this a shame to your own.

674
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,810
Hey, care acquired!

675
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:03,980
You got another disappointment through
your own life, haven't you?

676
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:09,610
Aren't you a little German boy
flowing the wing of a German fly?

677
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:14,240
She brought everything the best
she could, didn't she? Did you hold one?

678
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,420
The boy is here.

679
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,300
Until I thought...
my withdraw wasn't sound very good.

680
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:07,310
Would you call it "strategus"?

681
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:09,270
I call pride.

682
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:15,840
You, Nazi, always study for
a good stepping parade, aren't you?

683
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:17,780
Lets go!

684
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,550
It seems the men of Coogan will be quite threaten.

685
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,640
to beat two examples of Japan finest,

686
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,680
to cut to a no hope for winning this war.

687
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,810
They were killed by magic.

688
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:51,350
There is no defense against sorcery.

689
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:56,360
They were killed by a boy and his puppets.

690
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,900
- And Don...
- I know, I know.

691
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,230
Come on!
It's OK.

692
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:19,770
Don is still here, his spirit.

693
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,240
And he won honest pride right now.

694
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,200
We both cry about that later, OK?

695
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:28,100
Right now I'm going to get you out of here.

696
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,750
- OK!
- That's why I come. Come on!

697
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:40,700
Klaus?

698
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:49,000
Your man proved to be
no more efficient than my own.

699
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,390
It appears only you and I remained.

700
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,440
I'll find them before they escape.

701
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,440
You'll take the rear,
and I'll get the front, for the envelope.

702
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,150
- Kill them surely I.
- We shall see!

703
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,540
They had to go somewhere.

704
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:31,180
You have performed acmatic
but now it's over for you.

705
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,520
What's in the bag?

706
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,940
Drop it forward!

707
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,270
- Danny
- We'll be okay!

708
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,450
Amount control endless, now I got.

709
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:58,250
Ninja!

710
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:04,000
I mean you're cut from the stained draw, Ninja!

711
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,500
- Gosh!
- Ouch!

712
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:11,020
No!

713
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:50,970
You're out with me statically.

714
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,250
Looking for something?

715
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:59,350
Where's the bomb?

716
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:01,560
There is no way without it to blow the plan.

717
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,270
Where is it?!

718
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:13,030
The timer is cutting down.

719
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:17,790
Yeah, and the focus switch
is turning off for the timer now, too.

720
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,660
A much, maybe you want to be blowing up.

721
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:24,500
And now if you come a Kamikaze pilot too,
deplore himself such a course.

722
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:27,920
The Kamikaze is a special kind of destruction,

723
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:30,880
better fight within, dedicated, and brave.

724
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:32,250
Okay!

725
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,350
There are more!

726
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,200
I guess it does take some spy to know die your airplane in the belly of a battleship, but...

727
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:43,300
brave, I don't know about that!

728
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:44,900
Just think about it!

729
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:48,350
Here is the one holding the bomb.

730
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,670
Order it to move away from the bomb!

731
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:54,350
No, he is not a puppy.

732
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,080
He isn't rolled over and play patch.

733
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,160
Besides, I don't think he likes you very much.

734
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:03,210
And I know he doesn't like the German,

735
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:08,130
after all, the German killed his master,
Mr. Toulon.

736
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,250
The forgery is truly powerful.

737
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:24,300
And that why you never get your hand on him.

738
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:26,730
As it still comes.

739
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:32,650
You don't blow us in this point, boy!

740
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:36,370
Much better than I ever to be
expected from a cripple.

741
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:39,080
The victory is far from a ship!

742
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,300
You still never get the secret.

743
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:45,170
Once again, you speak before victory is in hand.

744
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:48,000
Danny, you got the puppets.

745
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:52,300
I know our alliance will improve
for the prosperous  like Eroupe.

746
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:56,300
Step away, dear!

747
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:59,000
Lay down your sword!

748
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:11,020
I should have known that
Nazi can not be trusted.

749
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,900
You have no codes of honor.

750
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:17,410
Do I have the puppet and the gun,
so stay back!

751
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:22,000
The serum in this puppet
only lasts a limited time.

752
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,300
- Where the rest of it?
- Hidden!

753
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,960
Then you will take me to it!

754
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,170
- Like hell!
- Over it, you will!

755
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,340
Third, I'll do things to a girl that you have...

756
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,510
never even dreamed of doing.

757
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,420
Then I'll hurt her,

758
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,840
badly, all while you watch.

759
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:40,220
And if that is not giving out,

760
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:42,000
and I'll begin torturing you.

761
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,180
And if anyone know torture as we, Nazi,

762
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:49,020
adopter and devise of
funny manageable techniques,

763
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:52,100
you've seen in death camps
of Auschwitz and Dachau.

764
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:57,030
- You have tortured innocent civilians. - Oh, we've tortured the soldier, too!

765
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:04,250
In our prisoners of war camps, we've tortured
many of Allied soldiers, many!

766
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:07,080
We serve the country more nobly than you.

767
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:11,400
Men of true value and integrity,

768
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,150
strong sentiment!

769
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:16,260
Now, while the cripple lies down.

770
01:18:03,390 --> 01:18:04,680
She's gone!

771
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,500
She takes the puppet with her.

772
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,810
She took the Ninja, Blade, and Pin Head.

773
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:17,610
This war the Jap won.
I give it to her.

774
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,000
New Year 2012.
