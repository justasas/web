1
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:03,124
Go over there.

2
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:11,803
It's beautiful!
Come on!

3
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:34,361
Giorgio!

4
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:39,297
Help! Help!

5
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:50,373
Help! Somebody's drowning!

6
00:04:07,363 --> 00:04:09,160
Where's Romolo?

7
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:11,128
He went to City Hall.

8
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,494
To hell with City Hall!

9
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:17,396
It's a woman.

10
00:04:18,407 --> 00:04:19,897
There she is!

11
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:22,575
Tino's not here either?

12
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:24,574
Is she trying to drown herself?

13
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:27,145
There she is.
Go in after her.

14
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:32,844
Jump! If she gets to the sewer
she won't come up again.

15
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:35,883
A woman's drowning!

16
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:40,193
You guys head her off.
I'll go in after her.

17
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:01,545
Pascello, run!
Come over here!

18
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,550
What are you doing? Not like that!
Turn her upside down!

19
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:07,415
Stefano, hurry up!

20
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,385
Where'd you fish her out?

21
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:12,891
Careful.
Hold her under the stomach.

22
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,528
She was drowning!

23
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,858
She probably slipped.
Mario saw her.

24
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,761
She musta slipped
and fell in.

25
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:20,902
- Did she jump off the bridge?
- No.

26
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:22,899
- Did she go under?
- Three times.

27
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:25,039
- At least seven times!
- Ten times!

28
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,643
She must have swallowed a lot.
We'll need some help. Stefano!

29
00:05:31,146 --> 00:05:32,113
What happened?

30
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:38,749
- Faster with the arms!
- She lost a shoe.

31
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:42,984
I think she's dead.

32
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:51,460
Get the water out,
before it's too late.

33
00:05:53,736 --> 00:05:55,966
Look how it's rushing out.
Move it, kids!

34
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:57,229
Wesaved her!

35
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,134
Beat it!

36
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:02,406
Let's get Pompeo.
He never seen anyone drown before.

37
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:03,306
Look.

38
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,606
I don't wanna look.
I'm afraid.

39
00:06:11,453 --> 00:06:12,784
Looks dead to me.

40
00:06:12,988 --> 00:06:15,354
Dead bodies don't
throw up water.

41
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:17,115
She opened her eyes!

42
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,624
She opened her eyes!
Put her down.

43
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,524
We'll give her
artificial respiration.

44
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:24,198
She's bleeding.

45
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,459
It's just a scratch.

46
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:31,097
What she needs is brandy.

47
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:33,605
Brandy nothing!
What she needs is milk.

48
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:41,346
Quiet! She's coming to. You, with
the motorbike, go get some milk.

49
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,108
I'm outta gas.

50
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:46,286
Take it easy now.

51
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:50,223
You're all right.
You can thank the Holy Father.

52
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,653
You're fine.

53
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:53,323
Where's Giorgio?

54
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:54,894
What Giorgio?

55
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:02,167
Where are you going?

56
00:07:05,574 --> 00:07:07,371
Who's she looking for?

57
00:07:13,982 --> 00:07:16,007
- Wasn't she alone?
- Yes.

58
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:21,420
Who does he think he is?

59
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,221
Take it easy. Come here.

60
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:26,690
I'm going home.
Where are my shoes?

61
00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:28,993
Here. There's only one.

62
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:35,036
She's got seven souls, like a cat.

63
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,898
See? She can hardly stand up.

64
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,006
Poor thing. She's in bad shape.

65
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,369
You were almost dead.

66
00:07:41,577 --> 00:07:45,104
Leave me alone!
Let go of me!

67
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,171
Hey! We're the ones who saved you!

68
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:51,683
You saved me.
Now I wanna go home, okay?

69
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,182
Okay, suit yourself.
Go home. Good-bye.

70
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,549
Hi, Cabiria.

71
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:01,190
You know her?

72
00:08:01,363 --> 00:08:02,591
Sure. She's Cabiria.

73
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:03,958
Where's she live?

74
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:06,363
On Via Cecilia.

75
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:07,925
She lives the life.

76
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,231
Giorgio! Open up! It's me!

77
00:08:38,834 --> 00:08:40,461
It's me! Cabiria!

78
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,979
Wanda!

79
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:07,692
Wanda! Have you seen Giorgio?

80
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:09,990
What happened to you?

81
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,690
Mind your own business.
Did you see Giorgio?

82
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:15,165
- Which Giorgio?
- My Giorgio.

83
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:19,396
What happened to you?

84
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,712
What do you want from me?

85
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:27,671
What do youwant?

86
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:31,248
I don't want nothing.
Mind your own fat ass!

87
00:09:48,837 --> 00:09:51,305
Go inside and dry yourself off.

88
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:53,269
I don't have the keys.

89
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:54,903
Where'd you put them?

90
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,441
In my purse.

91
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:00,738
Where's your purse?

92
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,317
Giorgio's got it.

93
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:08,984
We took a walk by the river and...

94
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,318
I fell in.

95
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:13,858
He got scared and ran away.

96
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:18,656
Cabiria! Open up!

97
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:22,796
Come on, open up.

98
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:24,336
I gotta sleep!

99
00:10:30,012 --> 00:10:32,537
Tell me something.

100
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:36,642
How much did you have
in your purse? Answer me.

101
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:58,996
If you see Giorgio, I'm right here.

102
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:21,754
What are you doing?

103
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:24,560
You're right to stay home.

104
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:27,064
Go to bed and
get some sleep.

105
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,430
I'll see you later
when I get back.

106
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:36,175
Why didn't you take your aspirin?
Take it, it'll do you good.

107
00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:39,745
You still here?
Aren't you tired of yakkin'?

108
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:41,472
Can't you see I had enough?

109
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,643
Get lost!

110
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:46,586
Who told you
we were friends?

111
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:48,551
Get lost, will you?

112
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,423
And don't come borrowing
my thermometer anymore!

113
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:56,721
Who's asking you for anything?
What a nut!

114
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:58,957
You're a sweetheart!

115
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:12,975
Someone would throw you in the
river for 40,000 lire?

116
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:15,945
Drown you for 40,000 lire?

117
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:19,052
Nowadays they'll do it for 5,000.

118
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,645
Someone who loves you?

119
00:12:21,123 --> 00:12:23,921
What love?
You met him a month ago.

120
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:26,492
You don't know his name
or where he lives.

121
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:29,424
Can't you understand?
He pushed you in!

122
00:12:29,631 --> 00:12:32,156
He pushed you in the river!

123
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,931
And you were lucky,
because if it had been me...

124
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:38,231
I'd have held your head under
myself! You nut!

125
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,171
Tell the cops!

126
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm no stool pigeon!

127
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:46,179
Take my advice!
Report him!

128
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:52,419
But why? Why'd he do it?
I gave him everything.

129
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:56,580
I gave him everything he wanted.
He didn't have to do it.

130
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,297
I'm such a moron.

131
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:37,955
What if I died?

132
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,357
That's it! The party's over!

133
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:09,029
We're through! Finished!

134
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:12,325
Silk shirts! I'll give you silk shirts!

135
00:14:12,534 --> 00:14:15,401
Find another jerk like me!

136
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,665
Look what I bought him!
A checked suit!

137
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:24,972
Camel-hair coat!
Never again! Never!

138
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:28,345
And who's gonna feed you now?
St. Peter?

139
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,609
Eternal love!

140
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:32,911
You dirty vitellone!

141
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:36,215
Go back to selling balloons!

142
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,756
I'll burn it all!

143
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:43,624
Chicken soup, veal chops.

144
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,865
You should drop dead!

145
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:08,748
This is the last time!
You'll never see me here again.

146
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:12,654
This is my last evening.
I shouldn't even be seen with you!

147
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:17,256
Look how classy I am.

148
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:20,332
You look like Moby Dick to me.

149
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:22,469
How dare you!

150
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,437
Know where you belong?
In the nuthouse!

151
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:30,441
Use your eyes!
Take a good look at me!

152
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:34,513
Look at me. A grande dame.

153
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:40,177
She gets worse all the time.

154
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,686
They oughta put her away.

155
00:15:42,924 --> 00:15:45,017
That's how you'll end up!

156
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,784
And that's the heater.

157
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:49,259
- This car's got everything.
- Even Coca-Cola.

158
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:51,830
- Gimme a ride?
- This ain't no tank!

159
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:53,830
- Get out!
- I'm not getting out.

160
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,525
Come on, move!

161
00:15:56,938 --> 00:15:59,600
- Why should I?
- I'm taking Wanda for a ride.

162
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,469
You don't know how to drive.

163
00:16:01,843 --> 00:16:05,176
It's my car. I can do what I want
with it. Get out.

164
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:08,373
I'll visit you in the hospital.
This I gotta see.

165
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:10,016
Why not the bigger model?

166
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:14,279
Another one! What do you know about
cars? You're always in the bushes!

167
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:19,722
You're always on two wheels!

168
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:26,357
Here comes the psycho again.

169
00:16:27,902 --> 00:16:29,392
- Bye, handsome.
- Bye, sweetie.

170
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:32,334
Remember to come see
your princess.

171
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:40,073
Cute! Real fancy!

172
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:42,579
Me, I'd have picked a grey one.

173
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:45,149
It's a fancier color.
But this one's cute.

174
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:48,084
You're gonna kill the battery!

175
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:50,587
Wanda, get out.
I don't wanna fight tonight.

176
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:53,157
Neither do I, you fanatic.

177
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:55,862
Still, a Fiat is a Fiat.

178
00:16:56,031 --> 00:17:00,161
With a car, life's a lot different.
You sit up there, high up...

179
00:17:00,368 --> 00:17:04,566
and you signal right, left,
vroom-vroom.

180
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,540
People think you're well off,
a secretary, a daddy's girl.

181
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:13,407
The men all chase you.
It feels great!

182
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,378
- Listen to her!
- What?

183
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,746
I know how she got that car!

184
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:20,313
That cokehead!

185
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:21,377
Wait!

186
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:23,212
Stay right here!

187
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:25,450
- Let me get out!
- Stay!

188
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:35,434
You're dancing, Cabiria?

189
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,967
You're in luck!
I'm the best dancer in Rome.

190
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:41,107
Come on!

191
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:49,580
Now she found another
deadbeat to say "I love you."

192
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:54,653
One who'll send her off begging.

193
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:58,416
Get off the street, dear,
or I'll have you arrested.

194
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:03,325
Here I am, gentlemen!
Here I am!

195
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,131
Just as well.
Who needs you!

196
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:12,771
Where you going with
the car? To the old-age home?

197
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:15,666
Maybe if you were 20 years younger!

198
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:17,567
Filthy flea bag!

199
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:21,180
You're just jealous!

200
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:25,950
Hear that, Cabiria?
She can't get away with that!

201
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:29,419
Look how you'll end up,
you lousy whore!

202
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:34,321
"Please, be kind.
Have a heart!"

203
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:38,032
"Please, for my Giorgio's sake!"

204
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:42,461
Do it! Poke her eyes out!

205
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,934
Wanda, here we go again.

206
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:55,176
Forza, Cabiria!

207
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:01,786
Never mind her!
Hit her low, in the belly!

208
00:19:02,123 --> 00:19:04,956
Don't stop them!
It's too much fun!

209
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:07,886
Stop it before the cops come!

210
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:12,295
I'll kill her!

211
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,862
Let go of me!

212
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:20,338
Get her in the car.

213
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:23,201
Get her away!

214
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:25,813
- Leave me alone!
- Get inside!

215
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:28,842
I'll punch you a new face!

216
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:39,183
It's not over yet!

217
00:19:39,394 --> 00:19:40,827
She ruined my face!

218
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:44,260
Forget about her.

219
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:51,094
You're scared of me, right?

220
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:54,737
You lousy loser!

221
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:00,773
Have a smoke.

222
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,316
Where you wanna go?

223
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:05,910
To Via Veneto.

224
00:20:06,087 --> 00:20:08,453
Via Veneto?
Think you're the Empress Poppea?

225
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,427
Listen, Cabiria, you and me oughta
have a talk one of these days.

226
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,257
You're not doing it right.

227
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:19,296
Who's watching over you?

228
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:21,768
Look at Marisa and me.

229
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,961
She's safe wherever she goes.

230
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:27,573
Nobody in Rome would harm
a hair on her head.

231
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,567
You know why?

232
00:20:29,777 --> 00:20:31,301
Let me out.

233
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:36,810
What do you expect
to do here?

234
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:40,146
Girls fight for spots on
Via Veneto and Villa Borghese.

235
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:45,190
Cabiria, why not find yourself
a serious man? Respectable, like me.

236
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,452
I don't need one.

237
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:49,255
- I say you do.
- I say I don't!

238
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:53,628
Why should I slave
for filthy pigs like you?

239
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:55,029
Let's drop it.

240
00:20:55,203 --> 00:20:57,535
Yeah, drop it.
Better let me out.

241
00:20:57,772 --> 00:20:59,763
Yeah, it's better.

242
00:21:07,081 --> 00:21:08,571
So long!

243
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:06,265
Moron! Degenerate! Go take a walk
on the Passeggiata Archeologica!

244
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:05,489
Can't I look?

245
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:07,500
Know how gorgeous you are?

246
00:23:08,069 --> 00:23:09,195
Get going.

247
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:14,003
Oh, yeah? We'll I'm staying
right here! See?

248
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:25,841
Sorry.

249
00:23:26,954 --> 00:23:28,046
Are you blind?

250
00:23:28,122 --> 00:23:29,521
Jessie!

251
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:36,257
Jessie! How can this happen?

252
00:23:36,464 --> 00:23:37,795
Alberto Lazzari!

253
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:43,460
Jessie, I don't want to get upset.

254
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:46,735
Jessie, cut it out!

255
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,232
Let go!

256
00:23:49,243 --> 00:23:52,406
Don't make me lose my temper.
Come back inside.

257
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:53,944
Give me the keys.

258
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:58,449
- Go inside. Don't be stupid.
- Don't you touch me, you pig!

259
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:04,313
Move over. Let me in.
Where are you going? Where?

260
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,289
- Do I get the keys or not?
- No!

261
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:12,561
- You're not getting out!
- You're hurting me. Let go!

262
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,560
Jessie, dear, listen.

263
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:20,137
Listen one last time.

264
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:23,435
- There's no more to say.
- I'm tired. You're exhausting!

265
00:24:23,644 --> 00:24:26,238
- Let go! You're ruining my fur.
- I bought it!

266
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:27,675
You louse!

267
00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:30,179
- Wait a second.
- What for?

268
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:31,779
You can go.

269
00:24:31,986 --> 00:24:34,648
Lousy second-rate ham!

270
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,595
Listen, Jessie. If you don't
come back, it's over!

271
00:24:41,996 --> 00:24:43,156
Fine! It's over!

272
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:46,857
Finished!
At last! So much the better.

273
00:24:47,368 --> 00:24:49,461
Thanks, thanks, Jessie.

274
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:52,929
What do you want?
Go away!

275
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:16,288
Hey, you!

276
00:25:18,232 --> 00:25:20,223
I'm talking to you!

277
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:24,160
Get in.

278
00:25:24,972 --> 00:25:25,961
Who, me?

279
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,969
Yes, you. Hurry up. Get in.

280
00:25:40,688 --> 00:25:41,814
Fast!

281
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:48,419
Close it.

282
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:22,117
Get out.

283
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:23,387
But why?

284
00:26:23,731 --> 00:26:25,062
Come on, get out.

285
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:31,962
What's it gonna be, Mr. Mustache?

286
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,698
What's going on here?

287
00:26:33,774 --> 00:26:35,799
Get out, get in, get in, get out!

288
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:38,034
Make up your mind!

289
00:26:38,813 --> 00:26:41,805
Come on. Let's have some fun.

290
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:10,676
- He said to go in.
- So go in.

291
00:27:37,371 --> 00:27:41,705
How are you, sir? How about a table?
Tonight's show is exceptional.

292
00:27:43,277 --> 00:27:44,676
Your umbrella, Signora?

293
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:55,219
Right this way, Signora.

294
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,529
Who's that?

295
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:18,577
May I help you?

296
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:22,849
Sit over here. Come on.

297
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:24,709
Please.

298
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:32,247
Sit over there.

299
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:16,596
Alberto!
Monica.

300
00:29:19,874 --> 00:29:22,638
What are you up to, Alberto?
Are you shooting?

301
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:24,708
- Yes.
- No need to introduce him!

302
00:29:24,912 --> 00:29:26,539
Pleased to meet you.

303
00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:29,408
Yesterday the Americans
gave me a screen test.

304
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:31,442
It turned out fantastic.

305
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:35,748
I have a 16-millimeter print at home
if you want to see it.

306
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:52,595
Ladies and gentlemen, that was part
one of our show. Before you dance...

307
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:56,299
I'd like to salute and applaud
an illustrious guest who is...

308
00:29:56,777 --> 00:29:58,142
honoring us with his presence.

309
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:01,445
Must I applaud too, Alberto?

310
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:05,176
Okay, boys! Mambo number 26!

311
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:13,760
Do me a favor,
come to our table.

312
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:16,828
A bunch of my friends
would love to meet you.

313
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:18,862
- Come on, Alberto.
- I can't.

314
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:21,465
I'm with the lady.

315
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:23,992
Let's dance.

316
00:30:45,826 --> 00:30:49,819
Mambo. The world turns
around the mambo.

317
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,054
What a mambo.

318
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:33,666
Oh, boy! What a mambo!

319
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:44,240
If you wanna be with your friends,
don't mind me.

320
00:31:45,753 --> 00:31:46,742
What?

321
00:31:46,954 --> 00:31:49,047
Don't let me keep you
from your friends.

322
00:31:49,256 --> 00:31:50,917
That's enough. Let's go.

323
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:53,417
Good night, Commendatore.

324
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:15,448
Get in. Hurry up!

325
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:20,882
- Did you eat?
- No. Well, a little bit around 8:00.

326
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:24,223
- Let's get some supper.
- What?

327
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:25,449
Let's have supper.

328
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:29,151
Good. Where are we going?

329
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,454
My house.

330
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,795
Wait! Wait a second!
Hey, Fancy Pants!

331
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:37,093
I'm talking to you!

332
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:38,627
Look at me!

333
00:32:41,342 --> 00:32:43,537
Look who I'm with!
Up yours!

334
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:45,772
Know who this is?

335
00:33:18,646 --> 00:33:21,376
- Did anyone call?
- Nobody, Commendatore.

336
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:25,207
- What do you mean nobody?
- Nobody called.

337
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:29,354
- Were you awake or sleeping?
- Nobody called. I was here.

338
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:30,545
All right.

339
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,383
Supper for two in my room.

340
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:37,491
If Miss Jessie calls, I'm asleep.
If she insists, I'm asleep.

341
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:40,222
If she stillinsists, I'm still asleep!

342
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:45,535
We'll eat upstairs.
What's your name?

343
00:33:47,074 --> 00:33:48,405
What?

344
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,405
Come on, move.

345
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:11,722
What? Another dog?

346
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:27,881
Look at these!

347
00:34:32,086 --> 00:34:34,054
You got fish too?

348
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:37,790
Yes.
Now, where did I put it?

349
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:44,787
- Leave it for the maid.
- But it'll get wrinkled.

350
00:34:48,435 --> 00:34:50,801
Idiot! What made me do it?

351
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:55,099
Did you ever see an idiot?
Well, you're looking at one.

352
00:34:55,776 --> 00:34:56,902
Just leave it!

353
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:19,389
Come.

354
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,738
What was your name again?

355
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:42,919
Where are you from?

356
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,979
What?

357
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:47,988
- Where do you come from?
- From Rome. Piazza Risorgimento.

358
00:35:51,498 --> 00:35:53,864
Sit down. You're making me nervous.

359
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:12,442
You like it?

360
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:16,420
Kind of.

361
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,048
It's not really my thing.

362
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:21,223
It's not my taste, but, yes.

363
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:23,452
Beethoven's Fifth.

364
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,031
I love it.

365
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:31,626
Come in.

366
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,813
Leave it there.
I'll take care of it. Go.

367
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:49,021
And close the door.

368
00:36:58,398 --> 00:37:00,389
Let's see what he brought us.

369
00:37:03,237 --> 00:37:04,829
Caviar, lobster.

370
00:37:06,106 --> 00:37:08,597
Help yourself. Eat.
I'm not in the mood.

371
00:37:09,843 --> 00:37:12,607
Help yourself.
I don't know if you like it.

372
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:17,115
1949...

373
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:20,649
1949...

374
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:24,519
Take that off.
It's hot in here.

375
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:35,532
Guess I tore it.

376
00:37:38,138 --> 00:37:39,127
Where do you live?

377
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:40,935
Past the gas station.

378
00:37:41,141 --> 00:37:43,541
- Where?
- On the road to Ostia.

379
00:37:44,144 --> 00:37:46,635
- You come to Via Veneto?
- Via Veneto? Me?

380
00:37:47,381 --> 00:37:50,145
I work the Passeggiata Archeologica.
Much more convenient.

381
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:51,149
Why?

382
00:37:51,385 --> 00:37:53,910
I'm on the Cilia.
Subway takes me right there.

383
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:56,248
There's another girl,
my friend Wanda.

384
00:37:56,456 --> 00:38:00,153
She lives there too.
But I don't bother with the others.

385
00:38:00,394 --> 00:38:03,329
The others sleep under the arches
in Caracalla.

386
00:38:03,563 --> 00:38:06,259
Mind you, I have my own house...

387
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:10,493
with water, electricity, bottled gas,
every convenience. I got everything.

388
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:12,671
Even a thermometer.

389
00:38:13,173 --> 00:38:14,834
See this one here?

390
00:38:14,908 --> 00:38:18,139
She never, ever
slept under an arch.

391
00:38:19,112 --> 00:38:20,204
Well, maybe once.

392
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,406
Or twice.

393
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:25,751
Of course, my house is...

394
00:38:26,586 --> 00:38:28,520
nothing like this.

395
00:38:29,356 --> 00:38:31,916
But it's enough for me.
I like it.

396
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:40,965
Eat. Eat something.

397
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:47,131
What's wrong?

398
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,036
Damn it! I know who you are!

399
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:53,312
I know!
Can I say it?

400
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:55,370
Can I?

401
00:38:55,949 --> 00:38:59,817
Alberto Lazzari! I knew you
right away! I saw all your movies.

402
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,509
Very nice!

403
00:39:01,588 --> 00:39:03,351
Which is your favorite?

404
00:39:03,557 --> 00:39:05,184
Well, the last one.

405
00:39:05,392 --> 00:39:09,658
You had a costume with all that
stuff, then Vittorio Scraman came...

406
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,360
pushed the door open,
"Fermi tutti!"

407
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:14,527
Then it was his daughter.

408
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:16,833
That wasn't me.

409
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:18,629
What do you mean?

410
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:22,835
You're as good-looking
as your house.

411
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:27,579
Bring the glasses here.

412
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,881
- Champagne.
- Sit down.

413
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,987
What's wrong now?

414
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:15,285
Who's gonna believe this
when I tell 'em?

415
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:19,187
They already think I'm full of it.

416
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,030
I might not believe it myself
tomorrow.

417
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:24,999
You have to do me a favor.
Give me a picture...

418
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:29,141
and write, "Cabiria was here
at my house... Alberto Lazzari."

419
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:32,042
"Cabiria Ceccarelli was at my
house."

420
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:34,711
Write it just like that.

421
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:37,510
Now let's eat.

422
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:39,309
And you eat too.

423
00:40:39,786 --> 00:40:40,844
An olive.

424
00:40:43,857 --> 00:40:45,324
Should I open it?

425
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:50,853
Chicken! Some chicken breast
to chase away the blues.

426
00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:53,624
Here's your plate.

427
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:57,969
If you want to play more
of that music, I'd like it too.

428
00:40:58,238 --> 00:40:59,865
And what's this?

429
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,135
I saw it in a movie once.

430
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:06,011
- Commendatore.
- Yes, Davide.

431
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,707
- It'sSignorina Jessie.
- I said, tell her I'm sleeping.

432
00:41:08,782 --> 00:41:09,840
- She's here.
- What?

433
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:12,677
- She's downstairs.
- Just don't let her in.

434
00:41:12,919 --> 00:41:15,217
She's already in.
She's coming up.

435
00:41:15,288 --> 00:41:17,119
Idiot!

436
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:29,360
Alberto, open up.

437
00:41:29,836 --> 00:41:32,396
- Who is it?
- Don't be stupid! Open up!

438
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,598
So? Open up.

439
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,571
It's very important.

440
00:41:38,778 --> 00:41:39,836
One moment.

441
00:41:44,885 --> 00:41:47,615
- The picture!
- Oh, yes. Hurry up!

442
00:41:48,555 --> 00:41:50,546
Alberto, will you open up?

443
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:52,851
Go in the bathroom a minute.

444
00:41:53,059 --> 00:41:55,186
Yes. I'll get rid of her. Hurry!

445
00:41:55,395 --> 00:41:57,886
I'm not leaving.
I'll stay here all night!

446
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,931
- Quiet, don't move.
- Open up.

447
00:42:01,968 --> 00:42:04,300
Alberto, please open the door.

448
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,765
Open up, you bastard!

449
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:13,810
What do you want?

450
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:28,223
What's on your mind?

451
00:42:28,828 --> 00:42:31,058
I'm tired.
I have to be up early tomorrow.

452
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:33,399
I'm working. You know that, right?

453
00:42:34,267 --> 00:42:36,633
I'm thirsty. Give me a drink.

454
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:38,837
- What?
- I'm thirsty!

455
00:42:44,444 --> 00:42:46,139
Now what?

456
00:42:46,346 --> 00:42:50,009
I can't go on this way!

457
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,151
Well, neither can I!

458
00:42:53,753 --> 00:42:56,586
Your jealousy
is morbid, unbearable.

459
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,623
I'm tired of it.
I can't take it any more.

460
00:43:00,126 --> 00:43:02,856
Let's call it quits while we're
still friends, okay?

461
00:43:04,497 --> 00:43:07,330
No. That's too easy!
I'm not going anywhere!

462
00:43:10,637 --> 00:43:13,265
Jessie, don't do this.
Get some sleep.

463
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:15,373
You're tired and
I'm falling apart.

464
00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:17,600
We'll call each other tomorrow.

465
00:43:38,131 --> 00:43:40,964
- I know you've stopped loving me.
- Who told you that?

466
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:42,964
You've stopped loving me.

467
00:43:43,336 --> 00:43:46,066
- Admit it.
- I'd never say such a thing.

468
00:43:46,306 --> 00:43:49,366
Admit it, and I'll never
bother you again.

469
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:50,975
But I'd be lying.

470
00:43:51,878 --> 00:43:54,244
Even if we saw each other
occasionally...

471
00:43:55,081 --> 00:43:58,175
every two or three days,
I'd be happy.

472
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:02,481
Why so seldom?
We could be together much more.

473
00:44:03,089 --> 00:44:05,819
- Every day?
- Yes, every day.

474
00:44:06,026 --> 00:44:10,690
But stop being so jealous. Is it my
fault that women always look at me?

475
00:44:10,897 --> 00:44:13,889
But you're ugly!

476
00:46:21,828 --> 00:46:23,693
How do I get outta here?

477
00:46:50,723 --> 00:46:53,851
Hey, Cabiria. Alberto Lazzari's
been lookin' for you!

478
00:46:54,694 --> 00:46:57,162
I'm not even talking to you!

479
00:46:57,363 --> 00:46:59,695
- Don't listen to her.
- Who's listening?

480
00:46:59,866 --> 00:47:01,390
Hey, Cabiria, there's Limpy.

481
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:03,068
There's a winner.

482
00:47:03,937 --> 00:47:06,098
Hey, you old lecher!

483
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,237
Homesick for jail?

484
00:47:10,443 --> 00:47:13,344
Come on, Cabiria,
let's have a good laugh.

485
00:47:17,016 --> 00:47:21,282
Why'd you bring him along?
Guess a weed never dies.

486
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:23,546
The Madonna might
have mercy on my uncle.

487
00:47:23,656 --> 00:47:24,645
What mercy?

488
00:47:24,724 --> 00:47:27,693
The pilgrims of the Madonna del
Divino Amore just went by.

489
00:47:27,894 --> 00:47:29,259
I don't believe that stuff.

490
00:47:29,629 --> 00:47:32,359
- Don't you believe in miracles?
- Not me.

491
00:47:32,565 --> 00:47:34,726
Should we go there on Sunday?

492
00:47:34,934 --> 00:47:37,801
We'll all have
something to ask for.

493
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:40,632
You goin', Cabiria?

494
00:47:40,874 --> 00:47:43,104
Me? I don't know. I'll think about it.
Besides...

495
00:47:43,276 --> 00:47:46,404
what would I ask for?
I've got everything.

496
00:47:46,579 --> 00:47:49,412
I'll even be done
with the mortgage soon.

497
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:53,745
But I might go anyway.
I haven't said no.

498
00:47:54,587 --> 00:47:55,918
We'll see.

499
00:47:56,322 --> 00:47:59,450
Think the Madonna would
waste a miracle on him?

500
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:03,654
Funny, huh? The Madonna knows
how you made your dough.

501
00:48:03,897 --> 00:48:06,297
Selling coke
and pimping women.

502
00:48:06,499 --> 00:48:08,729
I'm going to see the Madonna...

503
00:48:08,935 --> 00:48:11,403
and I know exactly
what I'll ask for.

504
00:48:12,071 --> 00:48:14,301
Don't make fun of stuff like that.

505
00:48:16,509 --> 00:48:18,340
You really want to go?

506
00:48:22,682 --> 00:48:24,115
What'll you ask for?

507
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:27,350
I'm talking to you.
What'll you ask for?

508
00:49:37,056 --> 00:49:40,321
Hey, you! Shorty!

509
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:43,192
Wanna lift?

510
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:09,180
A shortcut.
He calls this a shortcut.

511
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,088
I've been walking an hour.

512
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:14,259
Who knows where I am?

513
00:50:59,605 --> 00:51:02,005
You live in the caves too?

514
00:51:02,975 --> 00:51:04,237
I've never seen you before.

515
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,743
I've got my own house.

516
00:51:22,261 --> 00:51:26,197
Gorgiano! Gorgiano!
It's me. Come up.

517
00:51:32,338 --> 00:51:33,669
How are you doing?

518
00:51:33,873 --> 00:51:36,706
Not so bad, thank you, sir.

519
00:51:37,443 --> 00:51:39,809
And where's Pietro?
Sleeping?

520
00:51:40,046 --> 00:51:43,209
They took him to the hospital
two days ago.

521
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:46,350
Said he was in bad shape.

522
00:51:46,552 --> 00:51:49,953
- And, you, what do you need?
- Whatever you want, thanks, sir.

523
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,549
Here's a blanket. Is that all right?

524
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:54,623
What hospital did they take Pietro to?

525
00:51:54,827 --> 00:51:56,727
To the Fratebenefratelli.

526
00:51:56,963 --> 00:52:00,831
All right, I'll visit him
if I have time.

527
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,412
Hey, Dark Hair.
Who is that guy?

528
00:52:22,288 --> 00:52:25,280
But who is he?
With some charity?

529
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:28,590
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.

530
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,571
Can I help you?

531
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,938
Going back to Rome later?

532
00:52:50,149 --> 00:52:53,448
Can you give me a lift?

533
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,980
Yes, later.

534
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:07,655
Elsa!

535
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:14,105
Ah, caro!

536
00:53:14,473 --> 00:53:18,102
I was expecting you Saturday,
but you came today!

537
00:53:18,311 --> 00:53:22,577
I was just thinking yesterday,
"He comes every nine or ten days.

538
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:27,617
"He came Wednesday,
so he'll show up Saturday!"

539
00:53:28,287 --> 00:53:31,950
Bomba! But I know this one!

540
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:35,426
Bomba, you live here?

541
00:53:36,195 --> 00:53:39,653
I wish I had everything I used to.

542
00:53:39,866 --> 00:53:42,801
A place in Rome, a place in Ostia.

543
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:47,496
Showered with gifts!
Money in the bank! Jewels! Gold!

544
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:49,698
I had five kilos of gold!

545
00:53:49,942 --> 00:53:53,708
She's not lying, you know.
Now who'd believe it?

546
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,880
But this one in her day...

547
00:53:56,115 --> 00:53:59,016
Here they don't even
make me comb my hair.

548
00:53:59,218 --> 00:54:02,153
But if I wear a low-cut blouse...

549
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:05,153
and the white earrings, then... ha!

550
00:54:06,192 --> 00:54:08,057
Come, come, Elsa. Take this.

551
00:54:08,661 --> 00:54:11,221
Oh! Look at the sweets you brought!

552
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:14,194
And only for me!
None for the others!

553
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,368
Give it to me to hide.

554
00:54:16,569 --> 00:54:19,299
The one with the chocolate!

555
00:54:19,505 --> 00:54:24,374
Pignoli! Look at the pignoli!
Like rainfall!

556
00:54:24,577 --> 00:54:27,478
Thank you, caro, thank you!

557
00:54:33,686 --> 00:54:36,917
And when will you be back?
When?

558
00:54:40,092 --> 00:54:44,051
God protect you from evil, my son.

559
00:54:53,606 --> 00:54:54,698
Of course...

560
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,408
there's lots of starving people
in Rome, eh?

561
00:55:04,784 --> 00:55:06,945
You drive around at night a lot?

562
00:55:08,788 --> 00:55:11,279
Not as much as needed.

563
00:55:18,698 --> 00:55:20,222
How about during the day?

564
00:55:20,866 --> 00:55:24,461
No, in the daytime,
the poor wander about.

565
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:26,365
How would I find them?

566
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:29,699
Go figure.

567
00:55:31,243 --> 00:55:34,804
Me, I'm out at night too,
and I've never met you.

568
00:55:36,882 --> 00:55:39,214
But how'd you get the idea...

569
00:55:39,418 --> 00:55:41,443
the idea of doing this job?

570
00:55:41,654 --> 00:55:45,556
I don't even know myself.
Like that. Little by little.

571
00:55:49,495 --> 00:55:52,987
We're here. There's your tram.

572
00:56:01,774 --> 00:56:03,765
Do you live far from here?

573
00:56:03,976 --> 00:56:06,968
About 19 kilometers,
on the way to Ostia.

574
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:10,173
What's your name?

575
00:56:10,616 --> 00:56:12,083
Maria Ceccarelli.

576
00:56:13,352 --> 00:56:14,614
Are you alone?

577
00:56:15,588 --> 00:56:18,352
My father and mother
died when I was little.

578
00:56:18,524 --> 00:56:20,287
I came to Rome later.

579
00:56:23,496 --> 00:56:26,192
Now go and get some sleep.

580
00:56:41,514 --> 00:56:42,811
So l...

581
00:56:44,016 --> 00:56:46,712
Arrivederci.
Go ahead, tell me.

582
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:50,020
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

583
00:57:16,115 --> 00:57:18,606
Don Vincenzo,
the group from Rieti is here.

584
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:38,199
Get your prickly pears!
Fresh prickly pears!

585
00:57:38,404 --> 00:57:40,133
Gimme a hand, Maurizio.

586
00:57:55,821 --> 00:57:58,085
Wanda, get a load of this crowd!

587
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:09,964
There's the candle guy.
Come on, Uncle.

588
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:20,078
How much for the candles?

589
00:58:20,279 --> 00:58:23,612
Take your pick.
I got some for 50, 100, 150.

590
00:58:23,816 --> 00:58:25,443
The biggest you got.

591
00:58:25,651 --> 00:58:27,084
We'll take two each.

592
00:58:27,286 --> 00:58:29,982
Wanda, the candles! Over here!

593
00:58:30,189 --> 00:58:31,486
Are these all right?

594
00:58:32,024 --> 00:58:34,754
I just want one. I'll pay for it myself.
Maybe I'll pay you later.

595
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,655
No, I'll pay for them all.

596
00:58:38,697 --> 00:58:41,393
- What'll I do with it now?
- Stupid!

597
00:58:42,868 --> 00:58:45,996
How much altogether?

598
00:58:56,982 --> 00:59:01,715
Make way! Sick man here!
Let us through!

599
00:59:04,823 --> 00:59:06,347
So young!

600
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,628
We're over here! Wait for us!

601
00:59:09,828 --> 00:59:13,559
We're gonna get photos!

602
00:59:14,533 --> 00:59:17,661
- Come, Cabiria. They're calling us.
- I'm coming.

603
00:59:17,836 --> 00:59:18,860
Where's Wanda?

604
00:59:19,505 --> 00:59:21,405
Wanda, come on!

605
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,073
Marisa!

606
00:59:28,714 --> 00:59:29,703
Get lost!

607
00:59:29,782 --> 00:59:31,647
With that nose
you want a photo?

608
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:33,875
Who's takin' the picture?
How much?

609
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,085
Now what do we do?

610
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:39,587
You need to confess. Down there,
where it says confessione.

611
00:59:39,825 --> 00:59:41,690
I already confessed yesterday.

612
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:43,487
Watch out! He's a cripple!

613
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:15,421
I'm gonna ask for mercy
from the Madonna too. Like you.

614
01:00:15,628 --> 01:00:17,459
What am I asking for?

615
01:00:17,696 --> 01:00:19,129
You don't remember?

616
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:22,095
I could ask for a villa
in Peripli.

617
01:00:23,802 --> 01:00:26,032
That's not what you said!

618
01:00:26,472 --> 01:00:27,734
Don't you remember?

619
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:30,738
I'll ask for whatever I feel like.

620
01:00:32,611 --> 01:00:34,636
But you said you'd ask...

621
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,871
I changed my mind.

622
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,424
Why are you talking like that?

623
01:00:46,625 --> 01:00:48,991
See? You made
my candle go out.

624
01:00:51,096 --> 01:00:54,224
Thirty masses at 1,000 each.
That's 30,000.

625
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:55,791
I gave them 35.

626
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:58,401
Yeah, you did okay.
You never know.

627
01:01:06,312 --> 01:01:07,939
How's the act of contrition go?
I forgot.

628
01:01:08,147 --> 01:01:10,741
"My Lord, I repent
with all my heart."

629
01:01:10,916 --> 01:01:13,476
- Yeah. What's after that?
- It's written in the confessional.

630
01:01:13,652 --> 01:01:17,144
Wait here.
We can't go in together!

631
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:18,748
That's enough for now!

632
01:01:19,992 --> 01:01:23,325
Use the other entrance!

633
01:01:28,334 --> 01:01:30,700
Take it easy. Don't push!

634
01:01:30,936 --> 01:01:32,836
I'm sick. I can't help it.

635
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:36,005
He's sick too. Can't you see that?

636
01:01:38,877 --> 01:01:41,368
Careful, Uncle.

637
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:45,442
- There's the altar, Uncle.
- I can't.

638
01:01:45,617 --> 01:01:48,552
I can't go on. I can't move.

639
01:01:48,721 --> 01:01:51,554
I'll hold you till we're at the altar.

640
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:52,814
I gotta rest.

641
01:01:53,025 --> 01:01:55,721
Rosie, come here.
I think he's gonna pass out.

642
01:01:55,961 --> 01:01:59,158
Try again, Uncle.
We're almost there.

643
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:03,564
Everyone has a secret agony.

644
01:02:04,002 --> 01:02:06,562
Everyone has a wish
for You to fulfill.

645
01:02:06,839 --> 01:02:10,400
Open your heart to the suffering,
O Holy Virgin!

646
01:02:10,642 --> 01:02:15,341
Mercy, Madonna!

647
01:02:15,547 --> 01:02:18,675
Call out with all your hearts,
"Viva Maria!"

648
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:27,417
- Heal me, Madonna!
- Make me well, Madonna!

649
01:03:43,969 --> 01:03:45,061
Wanda, over here!

650
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:52,309
Stay close.
What happens next?

651
01:03:52,511 --> 01:03:53,603
I don't know!

652
01:03:53,812 --> 01:03:56,747
You oughta hear my heart beating.
I'm shaking.

653
01:03:56,949 --> 01:03:59,577
I feel so strange, Wanda.

654
01:04:08,293 --> 01:04:10,158
Now all kneel and pray.

655
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:20,670
Amleto, will the Madonna
bestow Her grace on me?

656
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:23,341
I think so.

657
01:04:25,677 --> 01:04:28,305
Now approach the altar
of the Virgin.

658
01:04:28,514 --> 01:04:33,451
Look into Her sweet eyes,
and in Her glance, each one of you...

659
01:04:33,785 --> 01:04:38,552
will feel the light of hope
turned on in your heart.

660
01:05:00,178 --> 01:05:01,975
Madonna, help me...

661
01:05:02,848 --> 01:05:04,679
to change my life.

662
01:05:06,518 --> 01:05:08,645
Bestow your grace on me too.

663
01:05:12,357 --> 01:05:13,984
Make me change my life.

664
01:05:15,027 --> 01:05:17,257
- Uncle, now!
- I'm afraid.

665
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,930
Drop the crutches.
She'll have mercy on you.

666
01:05:20,098 --> 01:05:21,190
I'm afraid!

667
01:05:21,266 --> 01:05:22,255
I'm holding you!

668
01:05:25,604 --> 01:05:28,573
Madonna, I'm a sinner.

669
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,198
A worm of the earth.

670
01:05:30,442 --> 01:05:34,378
Have mercy on me, Madonna.
Don't leave me!

671
01:06:06,945 --> 01:06:08,640
Lost your tongue?
Have a drink.

672
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,815
Careful, Wanda.
One glass and she's smashed.

673
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,381
What are you doing?

674
01:06:13,952 --> 01:06:16,045
- I'm thinking.
- About what?

675
01:06:16,221 --> 01:06:18,655
- What did she say?
- She says she's thinking.

676
01:06:18,824 --> 01:06:22,920
Too much thinking
will make your head explode.

677
01:06:24,796 --> 01:06:27,560
Look at those delinquents!
Stop with the damn ball!

678
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,291
They're doing it on purpose!

679
01:06:29,468 --> 01:06:31,129
I'll fix 'em!

680
01:06:40,278 --> 01:06:42,940
Next time I'll kick it
the other way!

681
01:06:48,787 --> 01:06:53,656
You wanna stay here by yourselves?
Uncle and I will leave. Just say so.

682
01:06:53,859 --> 01:06:56,521
- Why should we want to?
- What's wrong with you?

683
01:06:59,264 --> 01:07:01,528
- What if we wanted to?
- What's the matter, Cabiria?

684
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,592
Hey! Come over here
and get your ball!

685
01:07:04,803 --> 01:07:07,636
Come over here
if you want it!

686
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:11,604
Go get her.
She can't even walk.

687
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:14,643
I'm not gonna tangle with her.
She'll manage.

688
01:07:14,846 --> 01:07:17,713
This music's boring!
Let's rock!

689
01:07:17,949 --> 01:07:19,814
What are you doing, you nut?

690
01:07:22,154 --> 01:07:24,520
We haven't changed.

691
01:07:25,724 --> 01:07:29,216
Nobody's changed!

692
01:07:29,728 --> 01:07:33,630
We're all the same as before,
just like the cripple.

693
01:07:33,999 --> 01:07:37,196
What do you want to change,
Cabiria?

694
01:07:40,405 --> 01:07:42,635
You think this is the end?

695
01:07:43,341 --> 01:07:46,037
You know what I'm gonna do?

696
01:07:46,211 --> 01:07:50,079
I'm gonna sell the house.
Everything. I'm leaving.

697
01:07:50,482 --> 01:07:53,883
Good-bye, you guys.
I'm through with all this!

698
01:07:54,753 --> 01:07:55,742
Where'll you go?

699
01:07:55,987 --> 01:07:59,150
Where? Think I'm like you?

700
01:07:59,491 --> 01:08:02,824
I know where I can go. I know.

701
01:08:03,695 --> 01:08:06,926
Just look at those little nuns!

702
01:08:08,533 --> 01:08:12,264
Where you going
with that banner?

703
01:08:12,504 --> 01:08:15,166
Looking for snails?

704
01:08:15,207 --> 01:08:16,504
Why'd you make her drink?

705
01:08:16,575 --> 01:08:19,066
I made her drink?

706
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:24,615
Did the Madonna give you mercy?

707
01:08:25,117 --> 01:08:27,051
Did she?

708
01:08:27,419 --> 01:08:29,887
Cabiria! You wanna get us arrested?

709
01:08:31,423 --> 01:08:33,357
Amleto, look at her!

710
01:08:33,525 --> 01:08:34,514
What?

711
01:08:34,726 --> 01:08:35,886
Bring her back!

712
01:08:36,061 --> 01:08:39,053
Leave me alone!
I wanna listen. Go on playing!

713
01:08:40,632 --> 01:08:44,068
Come here, kids!
Come enjoy yourselves!

714
01:08:44,436 --> 01:08:46,700
Come dance with us!

715
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:49,100
Forget about your banner!

716
01:08:50,776 --> 01:08:56,544
Why do you always butt in?
Get lost!

717
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:01,317
Cabiria!
You're in no condition for this!

718
01:09:01,486 --> 01:09:04,387
- Leave me alone!
- You're blind drunk!

719
01:09:04,589 --> 01:09:08,081
Who's drunk?
What do you know?

720
01:10:04,983 --> 01:10:08,646
Is the show any good?
Hey! I asked you a question!

721
01:10:08,854 --> 01:10:11,049
You want me to say it stinks?

722
01:10:41,386 --> 01:10:45,049
As you can see, ladies and
gentlemen, my assistant's head...

723
01:10:45,457 --> 01:10:49,188
has been completely
impaled by the daggers.

724
01:10:49,661 --> 01:10:53,722
There's no doubt
that his head must be...

725
01:10:54,032 --> 01:10:55,829
soaked in blood.

726
01:10:55,967 --> 01:11:00,836
You'll be amazed to see, instead,
that his head has disappeared!

727
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:14,518
In the second part
of our show, we'll feature...

728
01:11:14,686 --> 01:11:17,120
experiments with magnetism,
hypnotism and auto-suggestion.

729
01:11:17,322 --> 01:11:21,520
Would anyone in the audience
care to volunteer? Prego, Signori!

730
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,091
I will!

731
01:11:30,502 --> 01:11:32,663
Come right up.
Don't be afraid.

732
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:35,533
There's absolutely no danger.

733
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:45,882
We now need a representative
of the fair sex.

734
01:11:46,117 --> 01:11:48,176
- How about you, Signorina?
- Who, me?

735
01:11:48,586 --> 01:11:50,645
Yes, you! Good! Come up.
Be brave!

736
01:11:51,556 --> 01:11:53,080
No, I don't want to.

737
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:56,556
Would you leave those young men
up there all alone?

738
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:58,023
You go, then!

739
01:11:58,229 --> 01:12:00,254
Come on, chickie!
We need a laugh.

740
01:12:00,498 --> 01:12:02,932
Wanna laugh?

741
01:12:03,001 --> 01:12:04,832
Just look in the mirror!

742
01:12:05,203 --> 01:12:07,603
Come on, Signorina,
don't make us beg.

743
01:12:07,772 --> 01:12:09,763
Should I come and get you?

744
01:12:10,008 --> 01:12:12,704
I'll come and get you.

745
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:15,744
Don't be afraid.
We're all good friends.

746
01:12:16,114 --> 01:12:17,274
They're all tricks.

747
01:12:17,515 --> 01:12:20,279
- Will you come?
- Sure! I'm coming.

748
01:12:23,621 --> 01:12:25,384
Think I'm scared?

749
01:12:25,457 --> 01:12:27,721
It's all fixed anyway.

750
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:31,862
There's no reason to be afraid.
You've showed how brave you are.

751
01:12:32,063 --> 01:12:36,591
Come, you'll be fine.
Now, let's enjoy ourselves.

752
01:12:37,268 --> 01:12:41,534
Oh, I'm so forgetful!
It's really unforgivable!

753
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:45,938
I completely forgot that
Signorina Elvira is still inside.

754
01:12:51,049 --> 01:12:53,449
Oh, this heat!
You're hot too, aren't you?

755
01:12:53,651 --> 01:12:57,553
How about a nice boat ride?
Does anybody here get seasick?

756
01:12:57,756 --> 01:13:00,281
I was on the Isle of Elba
as a kid.

757
01:13:00,492 --> 01:13:02,392
You barely got to Ostia.

758
01:13:02,594 --> 01:13:06,428
Nobody here gets seasick?
That's very good.

759
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:08,565
Ah, here's our boat.

760
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:12,430
We named her Intrepidbecause
she always defies the waves.

761
01:13:12,637 --> 01:13:15,299
Come on, boys.
Don't make me beg you.

762
01:13:15,507 --> 01:13:16,997
Signorina, you stay here.

763
01:13:17,242 --> 01:13:22,077
The boat is waiting. The sea is calm,
and the weather is fine.

764
01:13:22,447 --> 01:13:23,971
I'm getting out of here!

765
01:13:24,182 --> 01:13:25,513
Where are you going?

766
01:13:26,818 --> 01:13:29,616
Damn, he's good!
He zapped him!

767
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:40,256
Look into my eyes!

768
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:50,538
Take the oars
and start rowing.

769
01:13:55,947 --> 01:14:00,782
The sea is calm, transparent.
Feel the breeze.

770
01:14:00,985 --> 01:14:05,319
Enjoy filling your lungs with air
saturated with salt and iodine.

771
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:07,355
Dolphins!

772
01:14:08,126 --> 01:14:10,390
Boy, look at 'em jump!

773
01:14:10,995 --> 01:14:13,520
One of you doesn't feel so good.

774
01:14:13,731 --> 01:14:16,029
Things are looking bad, boys.

775
01:14:16,234 --> 01:14:18,998
It's the open sea now.
The waves are swelling.

776
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:21,001
Hear the wind whistling.

777
01:14:22,407 --> 01:14:23,499
It's a hurricane!

778
01:14:24,976 --> 01:14:26,967
Help! Hold the rudder!

779
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:36,145
It's every man for himself!

780
01:14:43,595 --> 01:14:46,086
Mamma mia bella!
I'm drowning!

781
01:15:01,579 --> 01:15:04,548
- Scared, weren't you?
- You'd have been too!

782
01:15:04,749 --> 01:15:07,183
You were plenty scared!

783
01:15:09,287 --> 01:15:10,754
Where are you going?

784
01:15:11,589 --> 01:15:13,284
- You mean me?
- Yes.

785
01:15:13,558 --> 01:15:15,526
- Isn't it over?
- No.

786
01:15:15,727 --> 01:15:19,128
It's not over.
You'd leave me here all alone?

787
01:15:19,564 --> 01:15:21,225
What's he want now?

788
01:15:21,533 --> 01:15:23,057
Signora or signorina?

789
01:15:27,305 --> 01:15:30,604
- Did you have fun watching?
- Not really.

790
01:15:30,808 --> 01:15:34,608
I'd like to talk with you
a moment. Come here.

791
01:15:34,979 --> 01:15:37,812
- Are you from Rome?
- Yeah, I live in Rome.

792
01:15:40,084 --> 01:15:44,384
In what part of town?
Colonna? Parioli? Prati?

793
01:15:44,789 --> 01:15:45,778
In Prati.

794
01:15:48,326 --> 01:15:52,422
Come on, be honest with me.
Where do you live?

795
01:15:53,164 --> 01:15:54,654
In Borgata San Francesco.

796
01:16:03,408 --> 01:16:04,841
What's so funny?

797
01:16:05,076 --> 01:16:07,909
Don't pay any attention to them.
They're just joking.

798
01:16:08,146 --> 01:16:12,640
So, you're not married,
but you'd like to be.

799
01:16:13,184 --> 01:16:14,651
Why should I get married?

800
01:16:15,186 --> 01:16:17,654
- I'm no dope.
- Who'd marry her!

801
01:16:18,489 --> 01:16:21,583
All girls want to get married.

802
01:16:21,793 --> 01:16:26,093
I know a nice young man
who'd be happy to marry you.

803
01:16:26,164 --> 01:16:27,153
Me?

804
01:16:27,365 --> 01:16:30,357
He's rich, handsome,
rides a horse and drives a Ferrari.

805
01:16:30,602 --> 01:16:33,264
Let's see if we can arrange it.

806
01:16:33,438 --> 01:16:35,429
What type of work
do you do?

807
01:16:35,607 --> 01:16:37,040
She's a countess!

808
01:16:40,545 --> 01:16:44,037
Listen, I'm fine the way I am.
I got everything.

809
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:46,044
And now I'm leaving.

810
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,719
I don't need anything!

811
01:16:50,788 --> 01:16:51,777
That's a fact!

812
01:16:52,023 --> 01:16:54,355
Even better.

813
01:16:54,559 --> 01:16:59,121
So you're rich?
With a bank account, houses.

814
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:01,389
I own the house I live in. Okay?

815
01:17:01,633 --> 01:17:04,158
And now I'll get going.

816
01:17:05,336 --> 01:17:06,325
One moment.

817
01:17:07,171 --> 01:17:09,002
Don't make me look foolish.

818
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:12,836
At least let me introduce you
to the young man, Oscar.

819
01:17:13,645 --> 01:17:15,306
Who the heck is Oscar?

820
01:17:21,019 --> 01:17:23,010
Please step forward.

821
01:17:26,424 --> 01:17:28,255
How elegant you look.

822
01:17:28,893 --> 01:17:32,329
Come here. I'd like to introduce
you to the Signorina.

823
01:17:33,765 --> 01:17:36,063
She wanted to meet you too.

824
01:17:38,903 --> 01:17:40,029
A pleasure.

825
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:42,763
The pleasure is all his,
believe me.

826
01:17:48,579 --> 01:17:52,276
Now that you've met,
I'll leave you two alone.

827
01:17:52,717 --> 01:17:57,586
This is a beautiful garden,
filled with flowers.

828
01:17:58,356 --> 01:18:02,850
You can talk, confide in
each other. No one is listening.

829
01:18:03,761 --> 01:18:06,423
Look, Signorina,
Oscar is offering his arm.

830
01:18:06,631 --> 01:18:10,965
Come, Signorina, take his arm.
There's no harm in that.

831
01:18:11,202 --> 01:18:14,569
But we just met.

832
01:18:15,139 --> 01:18:18,040
You're strolling now.
The paths are full of flowers.

833
01:18:18,409 --> 01:18:22,436
The birds are chirping.
Oscar dares not speak.

834
01:18:22,647 --> 01:18:25,115
He's shy... sensitive.

835
01:18:25,316 --> 01:18:27,375
Now he says, "Signorina...

836
01:18:27,585 --> 01:18:31,919
"I've been hoping to meet you
for such a long time.

837
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:34,281
"May I ask you a question?

838
01:18:35,893 --> 01:18:38,487
"You're not spoken for, are you?

839
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:42,331
"There was never
a man in your life?

840
01:18:43,901 --> 01:18:45,232
"Ah, I thought so.

841
01:18:46,604 --> 01:18:51,132
"I often see you standing by
your window, and at Sunday mass.

842
01:18:51,843 --> 01:18:56,075
"Your eyes are always lowered.
You're always with your mother.

843
01:18:56,681 --> 01:19:01,675
"That's good. Picking flowers
indicates a gentle soul.

844
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,347
"Signorina, may I hope
to see you again?

845
01:19:09,694 --> 01:19:13,095
"Ah, thank you.
What did you say your name was?

846
01:19:15,366 --> 01:19:19,700
"Thank you. I'll save this flower
like a precious object.

847
01:19:20,004 --> 01:19:21,528
"Would you dance with me?"

848
01:19:21,773 --> 01:19:25,140
Play, Maestro.
Oscar and Maria wish to dance.

849
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:29,373
The orchestra will play
a beautiful waltz.

850
01:19:35,553 --> 01:19:38,215
"I'm wealthy, but I'm alone
and unhappy.

851
01:19:38,456 --> 01:19:41,983
"What good are fancy cars,
long journeys and luxury hotels?

852
01:19:42,193 --> 01:19:44,024
"Smoke! Illusion!

853
01:19:44,295 --> 01:19:49,164
"What I really want is a home,
children, and a wife like you."

854
01:19:50,234 --> 01:19:54,330
When I was eighteen, that's when
you should have known me!

855
01:19:54,972 --> 01:19:57,304
I had long black hair.

856
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,933
This long.

857
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:02,377
"For me, you'll always be eighteen."

858
01:20:04,715 --> 01:20:05,909
Then it's true?

859
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:07,715
You really love me?

860
01:20:08,853 --> 01:20:12,721
Is it really true?
You're not trying to fool me?

861
01:20:13,057 --> 01:20:15,252
Do you really love me?

862
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:30,233
There, there. It's all right.

863
01:20:44,956 --> 01:20:46,218
What happened?

864
01:20:47,225 --> 01:20:49,090
What did you make me do?

865
01:21:00,104 --> 01:21:02,038
Still here?
I have to close up.

866
01:21:02,106 --> 01:21:03,539
I'm going! I'm going!

867
01:21:05,409 --> 01:21:08,572
Listen, are those creeps
still out there?

868
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:11,077
Everybody's gone.
There's nobody left.

869
01:21:13,484 --> 01:21:15,645
Now get going.
I gotta close up.

870
01:21:15,953 --> 01:21:18,421
I'll show them a thing or two!

871
01:21:21,425 --> 01:21:22,756
Pardon me, Signorina.

872
01:21:23,794 --> 01:21:25,455
I'm Donofrio, accountant.

873
01:21:27,431 --> 01:21:28,921
Forgive my boldness.

874
01:21:30,334 --> 01:21:33,599
I don't normally
stop young ladies in the street.

875
01:21:33,804 --> 01:21:35,669
I was inside
among the audience.

876
01:21:35,907 --> 01:21:37,898
Oh! You were there, watching!

877
01:21:38,109 --> 01:21:39,235
Great show!

878
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:40,800
I bet you like that stuff!

879
01:21:41,012 --> 01:21:44,277
If I ever see that slimeball again...

880
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:48,179
Signorina! Please,
don't misunderstand me.

881
01:21:48,486 --> 01:21:50,477
I agree with you!

882
01:21:51,088 --> 01:21:53,352
In fact, I sympathize with you.

883
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:57,989
I came to tell you
how moved I was.

884
01:21:59,597 --> 01:22:04,500
We can all pretend to be
cynical and scheming.

885
01:22:05,002 --> 01:22:10,133
But when we're faced with
purity and innocence...

886
01:22:11,175 --> 01:22:13,507
the cynical mask
drops off...

887
01:22:14,545 --> 01:22:17,776
and all that is best in us
awakens.

888
01:22:19,951 --> 01:22:24,354
I wanted to thank you.
You did me good.

889
01:22:27,491 --> 01:22:29,356
It's gotten chilly, hasn't it?

890
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:34,726
Excuse me.
It's the nighttime humidity.

891
01:22:37,401 --> 01:22:39,062
May I buy you something?

892
01:22:39,236 --> 01:22:42,137
I really don't know you.

893
01:22:46,644 --> 01:22:49,704
Those damn creeps
are still there!

894
01:22:51,215 --> 01:22:55,345
Excuse my persistence, but
these experiments with magnetism...

895
01:22:55,519 --> 01:22:57,146
are extremely dangerous.

896
01:22:57,355 --> 01:23:01,223
They can cause imbalances
and other disturbances.

897
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:05,693
That'swhy I felt so strange!

898
01:23:05,896 --> 01:23:09,332
Cold, hot, sweaty.
Like I had a fever.

899
01:23:10,434 --> 01:23:11,731
How about that!

900
01:23:11,936 --> 01:23:15,269
I would suggest a Fernet.
It'll do you good.

901
01:23:16,207 --> 01:23:18,175
Come, we'll sit down.

902
01:23:18,676 --> 01:23:20,166
Just a moment.

903
01:23:21,579 --> 01:23:23,069
Please sit down.

904
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:27,213
Two Fernet, please.

905
01:23:34,392 --> 01:23:37,361
I swear, I've rarely suffered
as I did tonight.

906
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:43,598
When that charlatan spoke words
of love to you in Oscar's name...

907
01:23:44,869 --> 01:23:48,930
and you answered with such
modesty and trepidation...

908
01:23:49,273 --> 01:23:50,797
it made me sick.

909
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:53,400
Something hurt me in here.

910
01:23:53,978 --> 01:23:56,469
I was ill. Really ill.

911
01:23:56,647 --> 01:23:58,444
Hurry up. I'm closing.

912
01:24:01,052 --> 01:24:03,418
Don't be upset.

913
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:08,081
Some things cannot be touched
by human vulgarity.

914
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:13,927
Even amidst a crowd
that laughs idiotically...

915
01:24:14,131 --> 01:24:17,623
there's always someone
who understands, who knows.

916
01:24:18,069 --> 01:24:19,593
Someone who appreciates.

917
01:24:27,511 --> 01:24:29,502
But what did I do?

918
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:34,744
You acted out a very tender
and delicate love scene.

919
01:24:35,519 --> 01:24:37,646
I'm still deeply touched.

920
01:24:37,922 --> 01:24:39,753
I can't even express it.

921
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:45,356
Yes. What struck me most...

922
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:50,494
is that deep inside,
you're as pure as you were at 18.

923
01:24:51,202 --> 01:24:53,966
When you went to Mass
with your mother...

924
01:24:54,472 --> 01:24:57,669
and had long black hair,
falling down to here.

925
01:24:59,543 --> 01:25:01,443
I really said that?

926
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:04,470
Closing time.

927
01:25:05,116 --> 01:25:06,105
How much?

928
01:25:06,317 --> 01:25:07,477
150 lire.

929
01:25:11,288 --> 01:25:14,553
- Thank you.
- Hey, you, go sleep at home!

930
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:16,692
Listen, Signorina.

931
01:25:16,894 --> 01:25:20,330
What happened tonight is
extremely important to me.

932
01:25:20,531 --> 01:25:22,522
Just imagine, if you will...

933
01:25:23,834 --> 01:25:27,964
I'm not from around here.
I just came here by chance.

934
01:25:28,172 --> 01:25:33,166
I enjoy strolling in the city
in sections that I don't know.

935
01:25:33,511 --> 01:25:37,038
I went into that music hall
without knowing why.

936
01:25:37,248 --> 01:25:41,810
There's no explanation for what
happened. As if guided by fate.

937
01:25:42,019 --> 01:25:43,919
Yes, that's the word: Fate!

938
01:25:44,088 --> 01:25:45,385
But who are you?

939
01:25:46,223 --> 01:25:48,020
You sound like you're from Parioli.

940
01:25:48,225 --> 01:25:49,556
What do you mean?

941
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,423
You talk like they do in Parioli.
A refined type.

942
01:25:53,664 --> 01:25:58,363
I told you my name is Donofrio.
I'm a government employee.

943
01:25:58,569 --> 01:26:00,366
What do you want from me?

944
01:26:02,439 --> 01:26:06,773
You might understand me better
after I tell you my first name.

945
01:26:08,045 --> 01:26:10,570
It's Oscar. My name is Oscar.

946
01:26:10,781 --> 01:26:13,272
- Your name's Oscar?
- Yes.

947
01:26:14,084 --> 01:26:17,850
So what? Your being Oscar
could be a coincidence, no?

948
01:26:19,256 --> 01:26:23,750
Sure. But isn't it strange that
the hypnotist chose the name Oscar?

949
01:26:25,062 --> 01:26:30,625
Signorina, I really must see you
again. You're waiting for the bus?

950
01:26:30,935 --> 01:26:34,530
Yeah. I'm dead tired.
I gotta get to bed.

951
01:26:34,738 --> 01:26:37,866
Do we say good-bye now,
never to meet again?

952
01:26:38,075 --> 01:26:40,236
Impossible.
I've got to see you again!

953
01:26:41,478 --> 01:26:46,211
The city is vast and we still have
so much to say to each other.

954
01:26:46,717 --> 01:26:49,447
When and where
can we meet again? Please!

955
01:26:50,254 --> 01:26:54,213
I don't know. I'm busy. I work.

956
01:26:54,725 --> 01:26:57,990
I'm a salesgirl. Anyway,
what'll we say to each other?

957
01:26:58,229 --> 01:26:59,958
- What?
- What would we say?

958
01:27:00,931 --> 01:27:03,991
There's the bus. So long.
Arrivederci.

959
01:27:04,168 --> 01:27:06,830
Please, don't say no.
I work too.

960
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:09,164
Maybe we can meet after work.

961
01:27:09,406 --> 01:27:12,967
Like tomorrow evening. Signorina,
wait, how about tomorrow evening?

962
01:27:13,344 --> 01:27:15,471
- In the evening I can't.
- Sunday afternoon, then?

963
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:16,338
Sunday?

964
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:18,514
Sunday, the Stazione Termini,
at 7:00.

965
01:27:18,749 --> 01:27:20,808
I don't know. I feel so strange.

966
01:27:24,688 --> 01:27:25,950
What're you doing?

967
01:27:26,257 --> 01:27:27,315
Hurry. Let's go!

968
01:28:15,806 --> 01:28:16,864
Here I am!

969
01:28:19,243 --> 01:28:23,407
I was over there. Sorry I kept you
waiting. I was in the wrong spot.

970
01:28:23,647 --> 01:28:26,081
Thank you for coming here.

971
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:30,513
You might have thought me
annoying, out of line.

972
01:28:30,721 --> 01:28:32,916
It was all so strange...

973
01:28:33,424 --> 01:28:35,085
as if I were dreaming.

974
01:28:36,493 --> 01:28:38,688
I took the liberty,
if you'll accept.

975
01:28:38,896 --> 01:28:42,161
Thanks. You didn't have to.

976
01:28:42,366 --> 01:28:45,893
My pleasure.
Let's go that way.

977
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:50,265
He says he likes to talk to me.
And he talks and talks.

978
01:28:50,341 --> 01:28:51,740
Boy, does he talk!

979
01:28:52,009 --> 01:28:55,274
The type who reads a lot.
Well educated.

980
01:28:55,512 --> 01:28:58,572
Last night we saw a first-run
movie at the Metropolitan.

981
01:28:58,782 --> 01:29:00,716
- Hey! That's your third!
- They're so good!

982
01:29:00,884 --> 01:29:02,181
I know they're good.

983
01:29:02,386 --> 01:29:06,516
So we saw this first-run movie.
A costume picture.

984
01:29:06,724 --> 01:29:08,715
Gladiators, with Christian martyrs.

985
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:13,693
He explained to me that
it wasn't a true story.

986
01:29:13,897 --> 01:29:16,365
It's make-believe,
just for the movies, understand?

987
01:29:16,567 --> 01:29:18,762
And then, he told me that...

988
01:29:19,036 --> 01:29:22,437
he gets a kick out of
talking to me because...

989
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:24,436
because I understand him.

990
01:29:24,808 --> 01:29:26,639
He's even good-looking.

991
01:29:26,877 --> 01:29:30,404
Black eyes, brown skin.
A northern type.

992
01:29:30,614 --> 01:29:32,844
Then we had pizza
at a trattoria.

993
01:29:32,916 --> 01:29:34,076
He always pays.

994
01:29:34,485 --> 01:29:36,248
Even for the flowers.

995
01:29:36,487 --> 01:29:39,081
- Nothing? He wants nothing?
- Of course not.

996
01:29:39,289 --> 01:29:41,314
Do me a favor, Cabi!

997
01:29:41,558 --> 01:29:44,118
I'll be meeting him again
tomorrow.

998
01:29:44,328 --> 01:29:45,590
What's he after?

999
01:29:47,431 --> 01:29:48,898
How do I know?

1000
01:29:49,099 --> 01:29:52,091
And who cares?
As long as he pays!

1001
01:29:52,302 --> 01:29:53,291
Oh, sure!

1002
01:29:54,938 --> 01:29:57,566
The cops!
The cops!

1003
01:29:59,777 --> 01:30:02,439
What you all need is jail!

1004
01:30:02,646 --> 01:30:04,238
Arrest them all!

1005
01:30:04,448 --> 01:30:07,679
I'm not running away.
If you want me, I'm here!

1006
01:30:43,787 --> 01:30:46,551
How are you?
How elegant you look today!

1007
01:30:46,757 --> 01:30:48,122
How are you feeling?

1008
01:30:49,059 --> 01:30:52,517
- Fine, and you?
- Thank you. Here. For you.

1009
01:30:54,231 --> 01:30:56,699
- Thank you. You shouldn't have.
- Don't mention it.

1010
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,424
- It's too much.
- Take it.

1011
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:01,394
Where shall we go?

1012
01:31:01,638 --> 01:31:03,538
Wherever you want.

1013
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:05,708
It's a sunny day.

1014
01:31:05,909 --> 01:31:07,638
Let's go to the Aventino.

1015
01:31:13,217 --> 01:31:15,947
Your family's not from Rome?

1016
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,088
No. I have no family left.

1017
01:31:18,255 --> 01:31:21,247
My mother and father died
when I was a child.

1018
01:31:21,458 --> 01:31:24,791
Loneliness is a heavy burden,
but I'd rather be alone...

1019
01:31:24,962 --> 01:31:26,122
than make compromises.

1020
01:31:28,799 --> 01:31:31,825
We lived in Puglia,
in a small village.

1021
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:35,061
The name is unimportant.
You wouldn't know it.

1022
01:31:35,339 --> 01:31:39,275
I grew up in an old house.
I remember the oil lamps.

1023
01:31:39,643 --> 01:31:43,306
My father owned a small plot
of land. His name was Giovanni.

1024
01:31:45,249 --> 01:31:47,479
My mother's name was Elsa,
the poor soul.

1025
01:31:47,684 --> 01:31:50,585
I like the name Elsa.
It's pretty.

1026
01:31:51,522 --> 01:31:54,958
I had no brothers or sisters.
When my father died...

1027
01:31:55,159 --> 01:31:57,150
some ruthless relatives
robbed my mother...

1028
01:31:57,327 --> 01:32:00,490
of what little property
she had, leaving us very poor.

1029
01:32:00,697 --> 01:32:02,187
I went looking for work.

1030
01:33:25,182 --> 01:33:27,548
What are you doing, my child?

1031
01:33:28,285 --> 01:33:29,377
Good day, Father.

1032
01:33:29,586 --> 01:33:31,417
Some alms for Sant'Antonio?

1033
01:33:31,622 --> 01:33:33,681
Sorry, I've no money on me.

1034
01:33:33,857 --> 01:33:35,552
Never mind. Some other time.

1035
01:33:35,759 --> 01:33:38,455
What's important is
to always be in God's grace.

1036
01:33:38,695 --> 01:33:41,630
You arein God's grace,
aren't you, my child?

1037
01:33:43,267 --> 01:33:45,030
You're not in God's grace?

1038
01:33:48,972 --> 01:33:49,870
Why not?

1039
01:33:55,112 --> 01:33:56,977
Everyone should be
in God's grace.

1040
01:33:57,214 --> 01:34:00,274
Whoever lives in God's grace
is happy.

1041
01:34:00,484 --> 01:34:04,113
I'm in God's grace
and I'm happy.

1042
01:34:04,988 --> 01:34:08,446
I even went to the Madonna
to ask for Her grace.

1043
01:34:08,659 --> 01:34:13,562
Maybe you didn't know how to
ask, or maybe you didn't need it.

1044
01:34:13,897 --> 01:34:15,330
Are you married?

1045
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:19,963
That's bad. Girls should get
married and make children.

1046
01:34:20,170 --> 01:34:22,604
Matrimony is a sacred thing.

1047
01:34:22,806 --> 01:34:26,606
In the grace of God, my child.
Ask Sant'Antonio for help.

1048
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:30,473
If you need me,
I'm Brother Giovanni.

1049
01:34:32,316 --> 01:34:36,582
I'm at the San Francesco
Monastery, but I'm hard to find.

1050
01:34:37,454 --> 01:34:39,513
I'm always running around.

1051
01:34:59,976 --> 01:35:01,204
Hey, Blondie!

1052
01:35:08,352 --> 01:35:09,785
So long!

1053
01:35:12,422 --> 01:35:13,650
Tomorrow?

1054
01:35:13,857 --> 01:35:15,586
Tomorrow I'm busy.

1055
01:35:15,726 --> 01:35:17,785
Then the day after tomorrow.
Same time.

1056
01:35:17,994 --> 01:35:19,621
I'm busy then too.

1057
01:35:20,397 --> 01:35:21,421
How come?

1058
01:35:22,899 --> 01:35:26,995
I was gonna tell you...

1059
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:29,170
I don't know if I'll keep seeing you.

1060
01:35:29,406 --> 01:35:30,498
But, why?

1061
01:35:34,778 --> 01:35:37,906
It's not that I'm uncomfortable
with you.

1062
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:41,978
But what's the point?

1063
01:35:43,086 --> 01:35:44,781
What am I doing with you?

1064
01:35:44,988 --> 01:35:46,683
We're both wasting our time.

1065
01:35:47,591 --> 01:35:48,956
And doing what?

1066
01:35:49,793 --> 01:35:52,353
Anyway, what do you
want from me?

1067
01:35:53,597 --> 01:35:55,155
If you want...

1068
01:35:56,199 --> 01:35:57,530
I'll marry you.

1069
01:36:05,008 --> 01:36:07,306
I wanted to ask you before.

1070
01:36:09,379 --> 01:36:12,473
But I didn't have the courage.
I've wanted to...

1071
01:36:14,017 --> 01:36:16,884
ask you since
the first time I saw you.

1072
01:36:18,789 --> 01:36:20,313
What are you saying?

1073
01:36:21,324 --> 01:36:22,882
Marry me?

1074
01:36:23,894 --> 01:36:27,159
What are you saying?
Marry someone you've seen ten times?

1075
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:28,695
Someone you don't know?

1076
01:36:29,032 --> 01:36:30,727
That's not how it's done!

1077
01:36:31,301 --> 01:36:34,896
Thank God I'm more honest
than some others.

1078
01:36:35,172 --> 01:36:38,164
Excuse me,
but that's not how it's done!

1079
01:36:38,742 --> 01:36:40,903
What do you know about me?

1080
01:36:41,211 --> 01:36:43,179
About who I am?

1081
01:36:44,815 --> 01:36:47,306
Is this how it's done?

1082
01:36:47,751 --> 01:36:50,151
You shouldn't fool somebody
this way!

1083
01:36:50,487 --> 01:36:52,819
Why pick on me
of all people!

1084
01:36:53,657 --> 01:36:54,919
Really!

1085
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:06,093
I've asked you no questions, and
I don't want to know anything.

1086
01:37:07,337 --> 01:37:08,668
Who cares?

1087
01:37:10,207 --> 01:37:12,368
Prejudices don't touch me.

1088
01:37:14,778 --> 01:37:18,009
Because what matters is...

1089
01:37:18,782 --> 01:37:21,080
is that I know your inner self.

1090
01:37:21,918 --> 01:37:25,410
We are... we are
two lonely creatures.

1091
01:37:32,462 --> 01:37:36,193
We have to stick together.
I need you.

1092
01:37:38,602 --> 01:37:40,229
Don't tell me that.

1093
01:37:41,638 --> 01:37:43,435
Don't say that, if it isn't true.

1094
01:37:43,607 --> 01:37:44,403
But it is!

1095
01:37:59,155 --> 01:38:00,986
What did you do?

1096
01:38:01,825 --> 01:38:03,156
What is it, you nut?

1097
01:38:03,226 --> 01:38:05,160
I'm getting married,
that's what!

1098
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:09,793
He asked me to marry him! We're
buying a store in Grotta Ferrata!

1099
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,264
He's almost signed the contract.

1100
01:38:12,469 --> 01:38:16,428
Without me knowing, he arranged
it all: A store, a house!

1101
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:21,304
I'm selling everything!
I'll sell the house... the house...

1102
01:38:22,579 --> 01:38:24,740
We're getting married
in two weeks!

1103
01:38:25,582 --> 01:38:28,176
Wanda, I'm leaving!

1104
01:38:28,618 --> 01:38:30,279
Does he know that you...

1105
01:38:30,687 --> 01:38:33,019
Of course he knows!
I told him everything.

1106
01:38:33,189 --> 01:38:35,316
I didn't hide anything
from him.

1107
01:38:35,525 --> 01:38:37,618
But he's a saint. An angel!

1108
01:38:37,827 --> 01:38:40,694
He didn't want to know
anything. He didn't care.

1109
01:38:40,964 --> 01:38:43,956
He loves me! He loves me!

1110
01:38:44,267 --> 01:38:46,098
Wanda! He loves me!

1111
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:04,143
Who's there?

1112
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:11,183
May I see Brother Giovanni?

1113
01:39:11,394 --> 01:39:14,227
He's not back yet.
Why do you want to see him?

1114
01:39:14,464 --> 01:39:17,729
- To confess to him.
- Go to church for confession.

1115
01:39:19,669 --> 01:39:22,331
I want Father Giovanni
to hear my confession.

1116
01:39:22,539 --> 01:39:26,475
He can't hear your confession.
He's not an ordained priest.

1117
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:29,904
I know, but...
I'll wait for Father Giovanni.

1118
01:39:30,313 --> 01:39:32,213
Fine. Then wait.

1119
01:39:44,594 --> 01:39:48,052
Why'd you pack this?
I'm not taking that!

1120
01:39:48,598 --> 01:39:50,498
Should I take the owl?

1121
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:53,931
Nah, it brings bad luck.
But I'll take the seashell.

1122
01:39:54,170 --> 01:39:57,333
See if it fits.
If it fits, I'll take it.

1123
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,770
I sold that.
Put it over there.

1124
01:40:00,010 --> 01:40:04,413
What a waste!
Leaving all this good stuff.

1125
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:07,740
- Here are the dishes.
- I sold them. Leave 'em!

1126
01:40:07,951 --> 01:40:08,883
Them too?

1127
01:40:09,052 --> 01:40:11,543
Why not?
I got paid for them.

1128
01:40:11,721 --> 01:40:14,690
It would've cost more
to move everything.

1129
01:40:14,891 --> 01:40:17,883
He sold everything back home.
So I'm selling everything too.

1130
01:40:18,094 --> 01:40:19,959
We're starting over!
Everything new.

1131
01:40:20,196 --> 01:40:24,792
Me, I'd have taken all the stuff.
Are you forgetting anything?

1132
01:40:24,968 --> 01:40:26,299
What could I forget?

1133
01:40:26,536 --> 01:40:30,063
- Did you take the money?
- Of course! I'm no idiot!

1134
01:40:31,107 --> 01:40:33,075
See? You forgot your fur.

1135
01:40:33,243 --> 01:40:34,471
Fur? What fur?

1136
01:40:35,145 --> 01:40:37,636
- No! I don't want that.
- How about giving it to my aunt?

1137
01:40:37,881 --> 01:40:40,577
Sure, but hurry!
They're waiting to move in!

1138
01:40:40,784 --> 01:40:43,116
Damn it! Those lowlifes.

1139
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:45,480
Close the suitcase, will you?
Tight.

1140
01:40:48,224 --> 01:40:49,213
Oh, la mamma!

1141
01:40:55,398 --> 01:40:59,061
Take one more look,
and then I'm getting married.

1142
01:40:59,135 --> 01:41:00,124
What?

1143
01:41:00,203 --> 01:41:02,000
I'm getting married too.

1144
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:03,899
What did I say? Nothing.

1145
01:41:14,818 --> 01:41:16,911
How do I look?

1146
01:41:18,455 --> 01:41:20,184
Looks good on you.

1147
01:41:20,457 --> 01:41:22,084
It cost me 1,200 lire.

1148
01:41:22,292 --> 01:41:23,953
You got robbed.

1149
01:41:24,461 --> 01:41:26,258
You paid too much.

1150
01:41:28,531 --> 01:41:29,964
Ah, my pocketbook.

1151
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:33,160
Good-bye, D'Artagnan.
Let's get going.

1152
01:41:34,104 --> 01:41:36,299
Time to leave.
Let's get going.

1153
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:53,648
See them? I can't stand
those starving bastards.

1154
01:41:57,227 --> 01:41:58,660
Let's go.

1155
01:42:05,068 --> 01:42:08,799
Here are the house keys.
I'm leaving. Arrivederci.

1156
01:42:10,707 --> 01:42:14,541
If you need anything, just tell
my friend, Signorina Wanda.

1157
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:17,077
She'll write to me.
Arrivederci.

1158
01:42:17,814 --> 01:42:19,679
Have a good trip. Good luck!

1159
01:42:19,883 --> 01:42:21,578
Thank you. Likewise.

1160
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,535
Never mind. I don't wanna
say good-bye to anybody.

1161
01:42:40,937 --> 01:42:42,768
It's better that way.

1162
01:42:43,006 --> 01:42:45,566
I'm so happy now,
and then all these people...

1163
01:42:45,775 --> 01:42:47,367
they'll ask questions.

1164
01:42:47,443 --> 01:42:48,603
Ah! Luciana!

1165
01:42:48,812 --> 01:42:50,439
I'm leaving.
I'm getting married!

1166
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:54,411
- Send us some wedding candy!
- I will!

1167
01:42:56,886 --> 01:42:59,582
Say good-bye to Nando and
his uncle, and to everyone.

1168
01:43:09,799 --> 01:43:11,061
Nice, eh?

1169
01:43:12,101 --> 01:43:13,193
They're pretty.

1170
01:43:18,641 --> 01:43:20,302
You're getting married...

1171
01:43:20,977 --> 01:43:23,741
and I never met
this fianc of yours.

1172
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:26,540
I couldn't bring him
where everybody knows me.

1173
01:43:27,984 --> 01:43:29,417
Here's the bus.

1174
01:43:32,255 --> 01:43:33,313
It's here.

1175
01:43:41,497 --> 01:43:42,828
Ciao, Wa'.

1176
01:43:42,899 --> 01:43:44,457
Why are you crying?

1177
01:43:46,002 --> 01:43:47,333
Who's crying?

1178
01:43:47,570 --> 01:43:49,435
Aren't you crying?

1179
01:43:51,608 --> 01:43:55,669
I'll write the minute I get there
with my address.

1180
01:43:56,813 --> 01:43:58,781
And you'll get married too.

1181
01:43:59,182 --> 01:44:00,171
Let's go.

1182
01:44:01,651 --> 01:44:05,985
Hurry, the suitcase.
I'll send my address right away.

1183
01:44:17,433 --> 01:44:20,834
Stay out of trouble. You'll...

1184
01:44:20,904 --> 01:44:23,031
You'll get a miracle, like me.

1185
01:44:23,273 --> 01:44:26,333
- Yeah, sure.
- It'll happen.

1186
01:45:08,584 --> 01:45:10,484
- What are you doing?
- I want to pay.

1187
01:45:10,687 --> 01:45:14,020
- But there's no reason.
- Please! You've always paid.

1188
01:45:14,557 --> 01:45:16,889
Anyway, what's mine is yours now.

1189
01:45:17,093 --> 01:45:19,493
It's all the same, isn't it?

1190
01:45:22,999 --> 01:45:24,023
Waiter!

1191
01:45:30,673 --> 01:45:32,334
It's getting late.

1192
01:45:35,578 --> 01:45:38,342
You'll see how beautiful
the sunsets are up here.

1193
01:45:45,555 --> 01:45:47,716
You want to get me drunk?

1194
01:45:48,391 --> 01:45:50,120
It's such a light wine.

1195
01:45:59,435 --> 01:46:00,800
The money.

1196
01:46:03,106 --> 01:46:04,437
Put it away.

1197
01:46:06,642 --> 01:46:07,973
It's my dowry.

1198
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:14,613
350,000 for the house.
That's all those crooks would pay.

1199
01:46:14,817 --> 01:46:17,980
They knew I was in a hurry,
so they took advantage.

1200
01:46:18,221 --> 01:46:21,281
Then I got all my money
from the bank.

1201
01:46:21,491 --> 01:46:22,924
400,000.

1202
01:46:23,659 --> 01:46:26,287
See? I made them give me
all new bills.

1203
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:49,784
Because you never asked
if I had money.

1204
01:46:50,253 --> 01:46:53,814
You, you're an angel,
a saint!

1205
01:46:54,190 --> 01:46:58,354
If you knew what I went through
to end up with this money.

1206
01:46:59,362 --> 01:47:02,525
I told you, I don't want to know.
Please!

1207
01:47:03,032 --> 01:47:04,863
Let's get away from here.

1208
01:47:06,536 --> 01:47:08,766
The beatings I took.

1209
01:47:09,205 --> 01:47:12,766
You see, some guys are
just after a girl's money.

1210
01:47:12,975 --> 01:47:14,602
You wouldn't believe it.

1211
01:47:15,344 --> 01:47:18,609
Everything for love.
But not that way.

1212
01:47:19,048 --> 01:47:21,812
But what about my old age?

1213
01:47:22,418 --> 01:47:23,783
Who worries about my old age?

1214
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:26,551
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1215
01:47:28,724 --> 01:47:30,214
Waiter, keep the change.

1216
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:31,992
Let's go.

1217
01:47:33,062 --> 01:47:36,623
I didn't want to go on
like that forever.

1218
01:47:36,833 --> 01:47:39,700
I'd have quit if I could,
even tomorrow.

1219
01:47:39,902 --> 01:47:41,836
I'd have gone away.

1220
01:47:42,038 --> 01:47:45,804
To live that way forever?
I already owned the house.

1221
01:47:46,008 --> 01:47:47,737
Know what me
and Wanda planned?

1222
01:47:47,977 --> 01:47:51,504
We were gonna rent a newsstand.

1223
01:47:51,747 --> 01:47:55,012
Understand?
Where are we going?

1224
01:47:55,318 --> 01:47:56,808
It's so nice here.

1225
01:47:57,019 --> 01:47:59,419
Let's take a little walk. Okay?

1226
01:48:00,490 --> 01:48:02,720
I don't even remember
how I started.

1227
01:48:02,925 --> 01:48:06,554
I was a child,
that's all I remember.

1228
01:48:06,829 --> 01:48:08,353
And the suitcases?

1229
01:48:08,431 --> 01:48:09,898
We'll take them later.

1230
01:48:11,501 --> 01:48:14,163
You shoulda seen me at 15...

1231
01:48:14,403 --> 01:48:16,633
with my long black hair...

1232
01:48:16,706 --> 01:48:17,764
down to here.

1233
01:48:17,974 --> 01:48:21,068
Who understood anything?
My mother just wanted the money.

1234
01:48:21,277 --> 01:48:22,767
Where are we going?

1235
01:48:22,979 --> 01:48:25,277
I don't know.
We're just strolling.

1236
01:48:26,182 --> 01:48:28,150
What's the name of that song?

1237
01:48:42,098 --> 01:48:43,258
Won't you kiss me?

1238
01:49:07,690 --> 01:49:08,679
Come.

1239
01:49:10,126 --> 01:49:12,026
I know a shortcut.

1240
01:49:41,057 --> 01:49:42,752
Oscar! Where are you?

1241
01:49:43,693 --> 01:49:46,821
What a bad boy you are!

1242
01:49:49,565 --> 01:49:51,863
Look at these flowers.
Like 'em?

1243
01:49:52,201 --> 01:49:54,226
They stink, but still.

1244
01:49:54,904 --> 01:49:57,099
I never saw flowers
like these before.

1245
01:49:57,406 --> 01:49:58,600
Let's go.

1246
01:49:58,841 --> 01:50:00,172
I'm coming.

1247
01:50:03,446 --> 01:50:06,244
Smell them.
What kind of flowers are they?

1248
01:50:06,949 --> 01:50:09,179
What's wrong? Are you sad?

1249
01:50:09,452 --> 01:50:10,885
Me? No. Why?

1250
01:50:11,087 --> 01:50:13,453
You stopped singing.
Wait a minute.

1251
01:50:18,027 --> 01:50:20,962
Why don't we carve
our initials on the trees?

1252
01:50:22,531 --> 01:50:24,624
Let's go. The sunset
is beautiful in the woods.

1253
01:50:24,867 --> 01:50:28,769
The sunset, eh?
Where do you wanna go?

1254
01:50:44,553 --> 01:50:46,487
What a strange light.

1255
01:51:01,937 --> 01:51:02,961
Beautiful, isn't it?

1256
01:51:06,676 --> 01:51:09,839
I guess there is some justice
in the world.

1257
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:15,177
You suffer,
you go through hell...

1258
01:51:16,686 --> 01:51:20,588
but then happiness
comes along for everyone.

1259
01:51:23,125 --> 01:51:25,184
You've been my angel.

1260
01:51:25,661 --> 01:51:28,528
Your hand is freezing.
Are you cold?

1261
01:51:31,701 --> 01:51:33,328
Having regrets?

1262
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:37,765
Beautiful, eh?

1263
01:51:39,208 --> 01:51:41,199
Look how deep it is!

1264
01:51:41,477 --> 01:51:44,469
I'd love a boat ride
right now.

1265
01:51:45,181 --> 01:51:47,706
Are there any boats
down there now?

1266
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:50,282
- Can you swim?
- Not me!

1267
01:51:50,786 --> 01:51:53,653
I almost drowned once.
But they saved me.

1268
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:56,051
Just imagine!
I was pushed in!

1269
01:51:59,795 --> 01:52:00,784
What's wrong?

1270
01:52:16,178 --> 01:52:17,509
What's the matter?

1271
01:52:20,716 --> 01:52:23,378
You don't want to kill me,
do you?

1272
01:52:25,454 --> 01:52:26,716
Answer me!

1273
01:52:27,923 --> 01:52:29,914
You want to kill me?

1274
01:52:31,694 --> 01:52:33,423
You want to kill me!

1275
01:52:34,497 --> 01:52:37,660
Don't just stand there.
Say something!

1276
01:52:38,601 --> 01:52:43,095
Speak! Don't be like that!
Speak!

1277
01:52:44,907 --> 01:52:45,896
Tell me.

1278
01:52:51,113 --> 01:52:52,910
For... the money?

1279
01:52:56,752 --> 01:52:58,117
For the money.

1280
01:53:25,047 --> 01:53:29,074
Kill me! Kill me!
Throw me off the cliff!

1281
01:53:29,285 --> 01:53:31,617
I don't wanna live anymore!

1282
01:53:36,859 --> 01:53:39,384
I don't wanna live anymore!

1283
01:53:39,562 --> 01:53:43,293
Kill me! Throw me off the cliff!

1284
01:53:43,899 --> 01:53:47,562
I don't wanna live anymore!

1285
01:53:48,904 --> 01:53:50,462
Go ahead!

1286
01:53:50,673 --> 01:53:53,073
Shut up, stupid!

1287
01:53:53,309 --> 01:53:57,905
I don't want to hurt you.
Can't you see that?

1288
01:53:58,581 --> 01:54:01,072
I don't wanna live anymore!

1289
01:54:04,587 --> 01:54:08,148
Kill me! Kill me!

1290
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:35,037
Maurizio, hurry up!
We're leaving!

1291
01:55:46,388 --> 01:55:49,414
We're gonna lose our way
going home!

1292
01:57:49,388 --> 01:57:52,990
