1
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,989
Your attention, please.

2
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,283
Your attention, please.

3
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,912
There has been an accident
at Maison Blanche.

4
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,085
lt involved Porsche Number 64,
driven by Michael Delaney,

5
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:43,467
and Ferrari Number 18,
driven by Piero Belgetti.

6
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,520
Signora Belgetti.

7
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,266
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

8
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:58,021
On this circuit, the world's
most famous motor race is run.

9
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,940
Conceived by Charles Faroux
and Georges Durand

10
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,693
shortly after the First World War,

11
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,862
the course was named
after the nearest town

12
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,615
and the number of hours
that men and machines

13
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:12,076
are put to the supreme test
of speed and stamina.

14
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,789
The circuit is 13.469 kilometers.

15
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,375
Or 8.418 miles.

16
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:23,004
Composed of country roads
linked through the main highway,

17
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:27,842
nearly all of it open to traffic
363 days a year.

18
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,013
Along the 3.2-mile Mulsanne Straight,

19
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:38,728
the cars reach a maximum speed
in excess of 230 miles per hour.

20
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,482
The first race was run in 1923.

21
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,402
The lap record
was nine minutes 39 seconds.

22
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,240
The average speed,
66.69 miles per hour.

23
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:55,370
Last year, the lap record
was three minutes 22 seconds.

24
00:15:55,537 --> 00:16:00,750
The average speed,
145.508 miles per hour.

25
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:04,003
The race is open to six classes of cars.

26
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:09,759
From the smallest production models
to the largest sports prototype engines.

27
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:14,138
All competing at the same time
on the same circuit.

28
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:19,519
There are 55 cars and 110 drivers

29
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,605
representing countries
from all over the world.

30
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,901
They will drive day and night,
through sun and rain.

31
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,779
Beneath his racing suit,

32
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:33,116
each driver must wear
fireproof underwear

33
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:37,161
capable of withstanding
2,400 degrees Fahrenheit,

34
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,833
the temperature of burning gasoline,
for 15 seconds.

35
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:47,380
His blood type must be indicated
on either suit or crash helmet.

36
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:52,093
Each car has two alternating drivers.

37
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:57,306
No driver may total
more than 14 out of the 24 hours.

38
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,184
Each driver must have
at least one hour rest

39
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,728
between turns at the wheel.

40
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:08,651
No one may drive
more than four consecutive hours.

41
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,497
For the first time
in the history of this race...

42
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,048
--at the fall of the tricolored flag,

43
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,593
to test speed of action
for reaching the safe pit.

44
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,554
This year,
the drivers will be securely strapped

45
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,766
into their driving seats
prior to the start of the race.

46
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,438
Yellow flags
and yellow lights along the circuit

47
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,899
indicate the presence of an accident.

48
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,487
Or, as it is called in the racing world,
"the shunt."

49
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:56,699
Yellow means danger. No overtaking.

50
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,414
The race will start 4 p.m. Saturday
and finish 4 p.m. Sunday.

51
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:08,961
The car covering the greatest distance
in 24 hours shall be the winner.

52
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,798
ln the case of the faster cars,

53
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:16,511
this will mean a distance
in excess of 3,000 miles.

54
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,764
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

55
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:24,102
welcome to the most famous
motorcar race in the world.

56
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:28,815
The 38th running of the Grand Prix
of endurance and efficiency.

57
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,527
The 24 Hours of Le Mans.

58
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,029
 We're pleased
to welcome Michael Delaney

59
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,280
back to Le Mans,

60
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,533
after his unfortunate accident
here last year.

61
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:11,579
And to see that he's in such good form
following his exciting race

62
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,873
a fortnight ago at the Nurburgring,

63
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:18,753
where Ferrari's top driver,
Erich Stahler, narrowly beat him.

64
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,549
The Delaney-Stahler rivalry
will be interesting to follow

65
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,553
on this very different circuit,
where the endurance of the car

66
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,056
is as important
as is the skill of the driver.

67
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,281
lt is now five minutes to 4.

68
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,241
Five minutes till start.

69
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,871
Will all drivers be in their cars
in one minute's time, please?

70
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,768
Drivers, to your cars, please.

71
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,448
Four minutes to start.

72
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,026
Three minutes to start.

73
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,220
Two and a half minutes to start.

74
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,568
Two minutes to start.

75
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:56,827
And once again, here are the first men
to qualify in position.

76
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:01,123
Number 25, driven by Kurt Ahrens.

77
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,628
Number 15, driven by Michael Parkes.

78
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:10,174
Number 21, driven by Johann Ritter.

79
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:18,599
Number 22,
driven by Paul-Jacques Dion.

80
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,813
Number 8, driven by Erich Stahler.

81
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,445
Number 5, driven by Lugo Abratte.

82
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:37,535
Number 6, driven by Vito Scalise.

83
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,374
Number 7, driven by Claude Aurac.

84
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:49,255
Number 20, driven by Michael Delaney.

85
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:54,927
Number 14, driven by Georges Marnier.

86
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,889
Over three minutes have passed.

87
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,850
We may expect the cars
through the chicane any moment now.

88
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,561
Will it be Porsche or Ferrari in the lead?

89
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,903
 Here's the leading car,
Porsche Number 25,

90
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,740
in for its first pit stop for fuel
and possible driver change.

91
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,808
 And here comes
Erich Stahler, Ferrari Number 8,

92
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,394
closely followed by the first
of the Gulf Porsche cars,

93
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,105
Number 20,
driven by Michael Delaney.

94
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,568
And watch out for the red Lola. Lola.

95
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,489
Okay.

96
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,410
And here comes 20 back on the track.

97
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,503
Gulf Porsche Number 21,
driven by Johann Ritter,

98
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,797
entering the pit.

99
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,641
And Porsche Number 20, Delaney.

100
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,934
Twenty by four.

101
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,519
Okay, thanks.

102
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,731
 My colleague
has just handed me a weather report

103
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:01,403
and it looks as if the possibility of rain,
which was previously forecast,

104
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,697
will shortly be upon us.

105
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,505
Just one more, Mr. Delaney.

106
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,599
- Hello.
- Hello.

107
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,228
You had a very good start.

108
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,564
lt's a long race.

109
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,982
Are you well?

110
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,161
Excuse me.

111
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,574
Thank you.

112
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,502
What will you tell Peter and Erica
when they get old enough to ask

113
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,546
what their father does for a living?

114
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,800
l'll tell them that their father
is the greatest chauffeur in the world.

115
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:34,389
lf you had a choice, would you like
to tell them something else?

116
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,600
For example:

117
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,438
"Well, this week,
Daddy's flying to Switzerland."

118
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,525
Yes.

119
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,819
The new motor factory
is almost completed

120
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,530
and l have to interview
various applicants for...

121
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,323
What are you trying to tell me?

122
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,828
Would you like that better?

123
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,748
Only if you'd like it better.

124
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:06,671
lf they ask me what their mother does
for a living, l'll say, "She lies."

125
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,634
She can look straight into your eyes

126
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:15,096
and tell the biggest lies
you've ever heard in your life.

127
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,556
Really?

128
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,725
Yes.

129
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:22,270
lt's the right time to stop.

130
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,983
l can finish quite well in this race.
Perhaps even--

131
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:34,908
Well, in any case,
it's the right time to stop.

132
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,547
 As was
forecast, we have our first touch of rain.

133
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,968
lt's going to be very interesting to see
what tactics the team manages

134
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,595
to outlast the rain.

135
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,682
lf it's only a shower, they won't change
from dry to rain tires.

136
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,644
But if it does continue, they must.

137
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,249
Your attention to the pit area.

138
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,586
The long-tail Porsche Number 25
is coming in

139
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,506
after having been out on the circuit
for only 14 minutes since its last stop

140
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,091
for fuel and driver change.

141
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:19,220
The team of Kurt Ahrens and Vic Elford
has built up a formidable early lead

142
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,599
on the factory Ferraris
and the Gulf Porsche team.

143
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,100
However, it appears now

144
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,227
that something definitely
out of the ordinary

145
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,563
has befallen the Austrian entry.

146
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,773
You will recall that this is the car

147
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,151
which, for the first time
in the history of Le Mans,

148
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:38,031
averaged a speed in excess
of 150 miles per hour.

149
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,045
Mr. Delaney.

150
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:55,298
You know, the white long-tail is out
of the race with a blown engine.

151
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,883
Yeah, well, that's bad luck.

152
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,218
Do you think it will be another
Ferrari-Porsche race?

153
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,804
A little early to say, but l think so.

154
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,848
What kind of race will you drive?

155
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,226
Try to save the machine,
go as fast as l can, try to win.

156
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,604
Do you think it will be like at Nurburgring?

157
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,023
A race between you and Stahler?

158
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,191
l hope not, ma'am.

159
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,234
And what do you think of Stahler?

160
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,653
Stahler?

161
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,490
l think he's probably one of the best
drivers in the world. Excuse me.

162
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,743
What do you think
is the most difficult thing about Le Mans?

163
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:24,994
To go as fast as possible,

164
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,122
and to keep the car on the road
for 24 hours. That's difficult.

165
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,590
Would this be the same type of race
you had with Delaney at the Nurburgring?

166
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,426
Well, uh, this is Le Mans,
it's a different thing, you know?

167
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,388
Do you think that you and Delaney
will end up having a close race here?

168
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:46,974
Maybe. He's fast, l'm fast,
so we're always together. Ha, ha.

169
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,142
Good luck.

170
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,025
Michael.

171
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,661
- How's that German car running?
- Fast.

172
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,038
- Ferrari?
Fast.

173
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,999
- lt's getting wetter.
- Slipping and sliding.

174
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,795
Michael, uh, the press
is making a big thing about us.

175
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,506
Yeah.

176
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,800
But it's money.

177
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,720
That's American.

178
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,682
Michael.

179
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,977
Be careful.

180
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,273
Now, don't be a pain in the ass, Erich.

181
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,328
And here are the official positions,

182
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,497
two hours into the race.

183
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,624
ln first place, Ferrari Number 8

184
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:59,672
finished 35 laps at an average speed
of 144.981 miles per hour.

185
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,677
ln second position
is Gulf Porsche Number 20 at 35 laps...

186
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:23,881
 All cars have come
into the pits to change to rain tires,

187
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:27,301
with the notable exception
of the three Gulf Porsche entries

188
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,679
and the four Ferrari team cars.

189
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:33,349
lt is apparent that neither
Porsche manager David Townsend

190
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,768
or Ferrari manager Loretto Fuselli

191
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,896
wants to call his cars in
for an unscheduled pit stop

192
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,190
during this closely contested race.

193
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,651
Looks kind of hairy out there.

194
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:51,784
ln practice, it didn't rain, so this is really
your first time out in the wet at Le Mans.

195
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,911
Yeah, it is.

196
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,459
Why doesn't Townsend bring them in
for rain tires?

197
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,795
Why don't you ask him?

198
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,759
l'll get back to you. Right.

199
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,600
lt's raining worse at Mulsanne.

200
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:18,603
- They're due in in 11 --
- Eleven minutes, l know.

201
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,898
Your attention, please.

202
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,525
Your attention, please.

203
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,986
There has been an accident...

204
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:57,493
lt involves Lola Number 11
and Porsche Number 47.

205
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,913
Fortunately, the drivers are not hurt.

206
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,457
Bring them in for rain tires.

207
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,631
Here we are.

208
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,634
Ferrari's decided to change at last.

209
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:44,100
And Porsche Number 20
is coming to the pits also.

210
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,811
Now we shall see a race develop
between the mechanics,

211
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,814
and they will determine
who's going to be the first to go out.

212
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,117
Twenty is away first.

213
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,369
Delaney now leads Le Mans.

214
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:52,001
There goes Stahler, now in second place.

215
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,514
- Well done, lad. Well, done.
He's coming.

216
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,266
Claude is coming.

217
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,852
No problems. lt's nothing.
No problems, yes, yes.

218
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,526
Come on.

219
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,220
lt's going well, Claude, isn't it?

220
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,389
l can feel it. The machine is good.

221
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,808
This might be the year.

222
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,394
Well, let's hope so. lt's a long race.

223
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,814
l know. Don't think too far ahead.

224
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,108
- Lisa?
Yes?

225
00:53:58,276 --> 00:53:59,568
Would you like some coffee?

226
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,405
No, thank you.

227
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,910
Ciao.

228
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,687
What problems have you got?

229
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,732
Only thing is that off the Mulsanne,
in the middle of the road. . .

230
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:32,114
--if you stay a little bit to the right and watch
it when you come up over the hump,

231
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,867
has a little bit of tendency
to go this way.

232
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:48,297
Be a little careful
before you go into the cave,

233
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,382
and you can out-brake the Ferrari.

234
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,684
Let's go fast. Hey, guys, move it.

235
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,621
All right, Michael. You got this one.

236
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,207
How long?

237
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,088
Monsieur.

238
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,044
Hello, Mike.
- How are you doing?

239
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,714
Cheese, please.

240
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:30,792
Seems to be the only seat left.
Can l sit down?

241
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:57,486
- Where are you living now?
- ln Paris.

242
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:06,870
l have to watch myself in Paris.
l always get fat there.

243
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:16,421
l heard you and Erich had
quite a race at the Nurburgring.

244
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:18,507
Well, he keeps me honest.

245
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,636
Can l--? Can l get you something?

246
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:23,845
No, thank you.

247
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,818
Were you hurt badly in the accident?

248
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,071
No.

249
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,867
Was it difficult to get back into racing?

250
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,665
Not really.

251
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,379
But it must've been very difficult for you.

252
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,972
Was in the beginning. l'm better now.

253
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,855
l was just wondering

254
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:17,774
why you came back here.

255
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,911
For myself.

256
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,443
Delaney's on his way.

257
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:30,323
Dixie, check the rear uprights
on 20, 21 and 22.

258
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,533
All right.

259
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:41,626
lt is 5 a.m., the 13th hour of the race,

260
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:44,713
and the Ferrari-Porsche battle
continues unabated

261
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,841
with only 12 seconds
separating the two lead cars:

262
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,927
Gulf Porsche Number 20,
Ferrari Number 8.

263
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:57,142
 As of this moment,
there are 25 cars left in the race.

264
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,060
l shall give you a precise listing

265
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:02,606
of the most recent abandonments
in a few moments' time.

266
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,657
Watch the handling, Michael.

267
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:16,244
Just a slight turn
about the rear upright.

268
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:56,534
 Here's the second
Ferrari team car coming in.

269
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:59,204
Number 7, piloted by Chris Barnett.

270
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,164
Another driver change
should be in order.

271
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:12,592
Get in.

272
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,429
Yes, Aurac will take over.

273
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,147
Your attention, please.

274
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,232
Your attention, please.

275
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,276
There has been an accident.

276
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:50,448
lt involves Ferrari Number 7,
Porsche Number 20.

277
01:12:50,616 --> 01:12:53,242
Both cars are out of the race.

278
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:58,748
l shall tell you about the drivers' condition
as soon as l get word from the hospital.

279
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,775
This way. Come along.

280
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:47,463
Will you sit down here, please?

281
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:50,795
Can you tell us. . .?
- Know what caused the accident?

282
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:52,838
We just want to ask. . .

283
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:11,232
l don't know.

284
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,737
- l don't know. l don't wanna talk about it.
Over here.

285
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:23,536
Now that you're out of the race. . .

286
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:28,791
We really don't know if it's possible.

287
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:31,377
Do you compare this to last year's shunt?

288
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,629
The one in which this lady's husband
was killed?

289
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:02,158
 I have received
word from the pit boxes that Matra--

290
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:08,748
That Matra-Simca Number 30,
out of the race due to gearbox problems.

291
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:13,669
Just got word from the hospital
about Claude.

292
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,547
lt's bad,
but they say he will pull through.

293
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:30,811
And Delaney?

294
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:34,273
Nothing serious,
but he's out of the race.

295
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,548
You all right, Michael?
- l'm fine.

296
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:01,842
You sure?
- Yeah. l'm all right.

297
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,886
- Where are we running?
Third and fourth.

298
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,561
Michael? Are you all right?

299
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:13,979
Yeah, l'm okay.

300
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:15,231
lt was a bad shunt.

301
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:17,024
Yeah.

302
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:19,944
- Where are you running?
Third.

303
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:24,073
lf you try to nail Scalise,
do it down through Maison Blanche.

304
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,783
He doesn't like it there.

305
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,410
Thank you.

306
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:22,840
Michael, are you all right?

307
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,258
l'm okay.

308
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,177
Are you sure?
- No, l'm fine.

309
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:28,888
Then what happened to the car?

310
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:33,726
lt was my fault. l made a mistake.

311
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:36,479
l wrote the car off, David.

312
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:43,778
David.

313
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:43,522
This isn't just a 1000-to-1 shot.

314
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:46,483
This is a professional blood sport.

315
01:21:46,651 --> 01:21:48,736
And it can happen to you.

316
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:51,238
And then it can happen to you again.

317
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,955
When people risk their lives,

318
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:04,752
shouldn't it be
for something very important?

319
01:22:08,548 --> 01:22:09,840
Well, it better be.

320
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:17,890
But what is so important about driving
faster than anyone else?

321
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:25,522
A lot of people go through life
doing things badly.

322
01:22:26,816 --> 01:22:29,276
Racing is important to men
who do it well.

323
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,570
When you're racing, it's. . .

324
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:34,490
lt's life.

325
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:37,743
Anything that happens before or after,

326
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,037
it's just waiting.

327
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,785
Come on.

328
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:47,706
What happened on the Delaney shunt?

329
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:50,751
There was problem at the mall.
Slower traffic got in the way.

330
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:52,628
The car is finished?

331
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:53,962
Yes, the car is finished.

332
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:00,719
Hey, David, 21 is coming in.

333
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:02,846
Get the jack.

334
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:11,980
Wishbone.

335
01:25:13,858 --> 01:25:15,901
Your attention to the pit area,

336
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:18,904
where the leading car,
Gulf Porsche Number 21,

337
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:22,199
is experiencing something
other than a routine stop.

338
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:23,784
From the action of the mechanics,

339
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:27,746
it would appear that there is a problem
with the rear suspension.

340
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:48,100
 Here is
the second-place car, Ferrari Number 8,

341
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:51,603
coming in for what should be
its last stop for fuel and driver change.

342
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:55,190
Erich Stahler will take over
for the final driving session,

343
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:56,984
and, no doubt, will assume the lead

344
01:25:57,152 --> 01:26:00,362
from Gulf Porsche Number 21,
still in the pit.

345
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,907
Stahler, is he in trouble?

346
