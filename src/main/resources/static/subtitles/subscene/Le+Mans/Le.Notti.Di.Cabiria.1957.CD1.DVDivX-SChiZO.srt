1
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:03,624
Go over there.

2
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:12,303
It's beautiful!
Come on!

3
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:34,861
Giorgio!

4
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:39,797
Help! Help!

5
00:03:48,143 --> 00:03:50,873
Help! Somebody's drowning!

6
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:09,660
Where's Romolo?

7
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:11,628
He went to City Hall.

8
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,994
To hell with City Hall!

9
00:04:16,304 --> 00:04:17,896
It's a woman.

10
00:04:18,907 --> 00:04:20,397
There she is!

11
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:23,075
Tino's not here either?

12
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:25,074
Is she trying to drown herself?

13
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:27,645
There she is.
Go in after her.

14
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:33,344
Jump! If she gets to the sewer
she won't come up again.

15
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:36,383
A woman's drowning!

16
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:40,693
You guys head her off.
I'll go in after her.

17
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:02,045
Pascello, run!
Come over here!

18
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,050
What are you doing? Not like that!
Turn her upside down!

19
00:05:06,254 --> 00:05:07,915
Stefano, hurry up!

20
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:10,885
Where'd you fish her out?

21
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:13,391
Careful.
Hold her under the stomach.

22
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:15,028
She was drowning!

23
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:17,358
She probably slipped.
Mario saw her.

24
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,261
She musta slipped
and fell in.

25
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:21,402
- Did she jump off the bridge?
- No.

26
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:23,399
- Did she go under?
- Three times.

27
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,539
- At least seven times!
- Ten times!

28
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,143
She must have swallowed a lot.
We'll need some help. Stefano!

29
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:32,613
What happened?

30
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:39,249
- Faster with the arms!
- She lost a shoe.

31
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:43,484
I think she's dead.

32
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:51,960
Get the water out,
before it's too late.

33
00:05:54,236 --> 00:05:56,466
Look how it's rushing out.
Move it, kids!

34
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:57,729
We saved her!

35
00:05:57,939 --> 00:05:59,634
Beat it!

36
00:06:00,108 --> 00:06:02,906
Let's get Pompeo.
He never seen anyone drown before.

37
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:03,806
Look.

38
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:06,106
I don't wanna look.
I'm afraid.

39
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:13,284
Looks dead to me.

40
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:15,854
Dead bodies don't
throw up water.

41
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:17,615
She opened her eyes!

42
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,124
She opened her eyes!
Put her down.

43
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,024
We'll give her
artificial respiration.

44
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:24,698
She's bleeding.

45
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,959
It's just a scratch.

46
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:31,597
What she needs is brandy.

47
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:34,105
Brandy nothing!
What she needs is milk.

48
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:41,846
Quiet! She's coming to. You, with
the motorbike, go get some milk.

49
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,608
I'm outta gas.

50
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:46,786
Take it easy now.

51
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:50,723
You're all right.
You can thank the Holy Father.

52
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,153
You're fine.

53
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:53,823
Where's Giorgio?

54
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:55,394
What Giorgio?

55
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:02,667
Where are you going?

56
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:07,871
Who's she looking for?

57
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:16,507
- Wasn't she alone?
- Yes.

58
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:21,920
Who does he think he is?

59
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,721
Take it easy. Come here.

60
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:27,190
I'm going home.
Where are my shoes?

61
00:07:27,662 --> 00:07:29,493
Here. There's only one.

62
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:35,536
She's got seven souls, like a cat.

63
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:37,398
See? She can hardly stand up.

64
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:39,506
Poor thing. She's in bad shape.

65
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,869
You were almost dead.

66
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:45,604
Leave me alone!
Let go of me!

67
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,671
Hey! We're the ones who saved you!

68
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:52,183
You saved me.
Now I wanna go home, okay?

69
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:55,682
Okay, suit yourself.
Go home. Good-bye.

70
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,049
Hi, Cabiria.

71
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:01,690
You know her?

72
00:08:01,863 --> 00:08:03,091
Sure. She's Cabiria.

73
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:04,458
Where's she live?

74
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,863
On Via Cecilia.

75
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:08,425
She lives the life.

76
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:36,731
Giorgio! Open up! It's me!

77
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:40,961
It's me! Cabiria!

78
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,479
Wanda!

79
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:08,192
Wanda! Have you seen Giorgio?

80
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,490
What happened to you?

81
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,190
Mind your own business.
Did you see Giorgio?

82
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,665
- Which Giorgio?
- My Giorgio.

83
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:19,896
What happened to you?

84
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,212
What do you want from me?

85
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:28,171
What do you want?

86
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:31,748
I don't want nothing.
Mind your own fat ass!

87
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:51,805
Go inside and dry yourself off.

88
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:53,769
I don't have the keys.

89
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,403
Where'd you put them?

90
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,941
In my purse.

91
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:01,238
Where's your purse?

92
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:03,817
Giorgio's got it.

93
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:09,484
We took a walk by the river and...

94
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:11,818
I fell in.

95
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:14,358
He got scared and ran away.

96
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:19,156
Cabiria! Open up!

97
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:23,296
Come on, open up.

98
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:24,836
I gotta sleep!

99
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:33,037
Tell me something.

100
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:37,142
How much did you have
in your purse? Answer me.

101
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:59,496
If you see Giorgio, I'm right here.

102
00:11:20,662 --> 00:11:22,254
What are you doing?

103
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:25,060
You're right to stay home.

104
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:27,564
Go to bed and
get some sleep.

105
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,930
I'll see you later
when I get back.

106
00:11:33,274 --> 00:11:36,675
Why didn't you take your aspirin?
Take it, it'll do you good.

107
00:11:36,878 --> 00:11:40,245
You still here?
Aren't you tired of yakkin'?

108
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:41,972
Can't you see I had enough?

109
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,143
Get lost!

110
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:47,086
Who told you
we were friends?

111
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:49,051
Get lost, will you?

112
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,923
And don't come borrowing
my thermometer anymore!

113
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:57,221
Who's asking youfor anything?
What a nut!

114
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:59,457
You're a sweetheart!

115
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:13,475
Someone would throw you in the
river for 40,000 lire?

116
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:16,445
Drown you for 40,000 lire?

117
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:19,552
Nowadays they'll do it for 5,000.

118
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:21,145
Someone who loves you?

119
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:24,421
What love?
You met him a month ago.

120
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:26,992
You don't know his name
or where he lives.

121
00:12:27,228 --> 00:12:29,924
Can't you understand?
He pushed you in!

122
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:32,656
He pushed you in the river!

123
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:35,431
And you were lucky,
because if it had been me...

124
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:38,731
I'd have held your head under
myself! You nut!

125
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,671
Tell the cops!

126
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,900
I'm no stool pigeon!

127
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:46,679
Take my advice!
Report him!

128
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:52,919
But why? Why'd he do it?
I gave him everything.

129
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:57,080
I gave him everything he wanted.
He didn't have to do it.

130
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:07,797
I'm such a moron.

131
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:38,455
What if I died?

132
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,857
That's it! The party's over!

133
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:09,529
We're through! Finished!

134
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:12,825
Silk shirts! I'll give you silk shirts!

135
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:15,901
Find another jerk like me!

136
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:20,165
Look what I bought him!
A checked suit!

137
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:25,472
Camel-hair coat!
Never again! Never!

138
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:28,845
And who's gonna feed you now?
St. Peter?

139
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,109
Eternal love!

140
00:14:31,352 --> 00:14:33,411
You dirty vitellone!

141
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:36,715
Go back to selling balloons!

142
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,256
I'll burn it all!

143
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:44,124
Chicken soup, veal chops.

144
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:47,365
You should drop dead!

145
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:09,248
This is the last time!
You'll never see me here again.

146
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:13,154
This is my last evening.
I shouldn't even be seen with you!

147
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:17,756
Look how classy I am.

148
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,832
You look like Moby Dick to me.

149
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:22,969
How dare you!

150
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:26,937
Know where you belong?
In the nuthouse!

151
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:30,941
Use your eyes!
Take a good look at me!

152
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:35,013
Look at me. A grande dame.

153
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:40,677
She gets worse all the time.

154
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:43,186
They oughta put her away.

155
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:45,517
That's how you'll end up!

156
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,284
And that's the heater.

157
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:49,759
- This car's got everything.
- Even Coca-Cola.

158
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:52,330
- Gimme a ride?
- This ain't no tank!

159
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,330
- Get out!
- I'm not getting out.

160
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:56,025
Come on, move!

161
00:15:57,438 --> 00:16:00,100
- Why should I?
- I'm taking Wanda for a ride.

162
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:01,969
You don't know how to drive.

163
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:05,676
It's my car. I can do what I want
with it. Get out.

164
00:16:05,847 --> 00:16:08,873
I'll visit you in the hospital.
This I gotta see.

165
00:16:09,117 --> 00:16:10,516
Why not the bigger model?

166
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:14,779
Another one! What do you know about
cars? You're always in the bushes!

167
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:20,222
You're always on two wheels!

168
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:26,857
Here comes the psycho again.

169
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:29,892
- Bye, handsome.
- Bye, sweetie.

170
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:32,834
Remember to come see
your princess.

171
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:40,573
Cute! Real fancy!

172
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:43,079
Me, I'd have picked a grey one.

173
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,649
It's a fancier color.
But this one's cute.

174
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:48,584
You're gonna kill the battery!

175
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:51,087
Wanda, get out.
I don't wanna fight tonight.

176
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:53,657
Neither do I, you fanatic.

177
00:16:53,928 --> 00:16:56,362
Still, a Fiat is a Fiat.

178
00:16:56,531 --> 00:17:00,661
With a car, life's a lot different.
You sit up there, high up...

179
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:05,066
and you signal right, left,
vroom-vroom.

180
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:10,040
People think you're well off,
a secretary, a daddy's girl.

181
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:13,907
The men all chase you.
It feels great!

182
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:15,878
- Listen to her!
- What?

183
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,246
I know how she got that car!

184
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:20,813
That cokehead!

185
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:21,877
Wait!

186
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:23,712
Stay right here!

187
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,950
- Let me get out!
- Stay!

188
00:17:34,535 --> 00:17:35,934
You're dancing, Cabiria?

189
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,467
You're in luck!
I'm the best dancer in Rome.

190
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,607
Come on!

191
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:50,080
Now she found another
deadbeat to say "I love you."

192
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:55,153
One who'll send her off begging.

193
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:58,916
Get off the street, dear,
or I'll have you arrested.

194
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:03,825
Here I am, gentlemen!
Here I am!

195
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,631
Just as well.
Who needs you!

196
00:18:09,403 --> 00:18:13,271
Where you going with
the car? To the old-age home?

197
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:16,166
Maybe if you were 20 years younger!

198
00:18:16,577 --> 00:18:18,067
Filthy flea bag!

199
00:18:18,813 --> 00:18:21,680
You're just jealous!

200
00:18:22,116 --> 00:18:26,450
Hear that, Cabiria?
She can't get away with that!

201
00:18:26,654 --> 00:18:29,919
Look how you'll end up,
you lousy whore!

202
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:34,821
"Please, be kind.
Have a heart!"

203
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:38,532
"Please, for my Giorgio's sake!"

204
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:42,961
Do it! Poke her eyes out!

205
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,434
Wanda, here we go again.

206
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:55,676
Forza, Cabiria!

207
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:02,286
Never mind her!
Hit her low, in the belly!

208
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:05,456
Don't stop them!
It's too much fun!

209
00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:08,386
Stop it before the cops come!

210
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:12,795
I'll kill her!

211
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,362
Let go of me!

212
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:20,838
Get her in the car.

213
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:23,701
Get her away!

214
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:26,313
- Leave me alone!
- Get inside!

215
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:29,342
I'll punch you a new face!

216
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:39,683
It's not over yet!

217
00:19:39,894 --> 00:19:41,327
She ruined my face!

218
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:44,760
Forget about her.

219
00:19:49,103 --> 00:19:51,594
You're scared of me, right?

220
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:55,237
You lousy loser!

221
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:01,273
Have a smoke.

222
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,816
Where you wanna go?

223
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:06,410
To Via Veneto.

224
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:08,953
Via Veneto?
Think you're the Empress Poppea?

225
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:15,927
Listen, Cabiria, you and me oughta
have a talk one of these days.

226
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,757
You're not doing it right.

227
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:19,796
Who's watching over you?

228
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:22,268
Look at Marisa and me.

229
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,461
She's safe wherever she goes.

230
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:28,073
Nobody in Rome would harm
a hair on her head.

231
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:30,067
You know why?

232
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:31,801
Let me out.

233
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:37,310
What do you expect
to do here?

234
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:40,646
Girls fight for spots on
Via Veneto and Villa Borghese.

235
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:45,690
Cabiria, why not find yourself
a serious man? Respectable, like me.

236
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,952
I don't need one.

237
00:20:47,161 --> 00:20:49,755
- I say you do.
- I say I don't!

238
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:54,128
Why should Islave
for filthy pigs like you?

239
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:55,529
Let's drop it.

240
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:58,035
Yeah, drop it.
Better let me out.

241
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:00,263
Yeah, it's better.

242
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:09,071
So long!

243
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:06,765
Moron! Degenerate! Go take a walk
on the Passeggiata Archeologica!

244
00:23:04,431 --> 00:23:05,989
Can't I look?

245
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:08,000
Know how gorgeous you are?

246
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:09,695
Get going.

247
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:14,503
Oh, yeah? We'll I'm staying
right here! See?

248
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:26,341
Sorry.

249
00:23:27,454 --> 00:23:28,546
Are you blind?

250
00:23:28,622 --> 00:23:30,021
Jessie!

251
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:36,757
Jessie! How can this happen?

252
00:23:36,964 --> 00:23:38,295
Alberto Lazzari!

253
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:43,960
Jessie, I don't want to get upset.

254
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:47,235
Jessie, cut it out!

255
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:48,732
Let go!

256
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:52,906
Don't make me lose my temper.
Come back inside.

257
00:23:53,113 --> 00:23:54,444
Give me the keys.

258
00:23:54,615 --> 00:23:58,949
- Go inside. Don't be stupid.
- Don't you touch me, you pig!

259
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:04,813
Move over. Let me in.
Where are you going? Where?

260
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:07,789
- Do I get the keys or not?
- No!

261
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:13,061
- You're not getting out!
- You're hurting me. Let go!

262
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,060
Jessie, dear, listen.

263
00:24:19,306 --> 00:24:20,637
Listen one last time.

264
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:23,935
- There's no more to say.
- I'm tired. You're exhausting!

265
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:26,738
- Let go! You're ruining my fur.
- I bought it!

266
00:24:26,947 --> 00:24:28,175
You louse!

267
00:24:28,415 --> 00:24:30,679
- Wait a second.
- What for?

268
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:32,279
You can go.

269
00:24:32,486 --> 00:24:35,148
Lousy second-rate ham!

270
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:42,095
Listen, Jessie. If you don't
come back, it's over!

271
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,656
Fine! It's over!

272
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:47,357
Finished!
At last! So much the better.

273
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:49,961
Thanks, thanks, Jessie.

274
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:53,429
What do you want?
Go away!

275
00:25:15,696 --> 00:25:16,788
Hey, you!

276
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:20,723
I'm talking to you!

277
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:24,660
Get in.

278
00:25:25,472 --> 00:25:26,461
Who, me?

279
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,469
Yes, you. Hurry up. Get in.

280
00:25:41,188 --> 00:25:42,314
Fast!

281
00:25:47,895 --> 00:25:48,919
Close it.

282
00:26:21,628 --> 00:26:22,617
Get out.

283
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:23,887
But why?

284
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:25,562
Come on, get out.

285
00:26:30,938 --> 00:26:32,462
What's it gonna be, Mr. Mustache?

286
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,198
What's going on here?

287
00:26:34,274 --> 00:26:36,299
Get out, get in, get in, get out!

288
00:26:36,543 --> 00:26:38,534
Make up your mind!

289
00:26:39,313 --> 00:26:42,305
Come on. Let's have some fun.

290
00:27:08,776 --> 00:27:11,176
- He said to go in.
- So go in.

291
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:42,205
How are you, sir? How about a table?
Tonight's show is exceptional.

292
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:45,176
Your umbrella, Signora?

293
00:27:53,854 --> 00:27:55,719
Right this way, Signora.

294
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,029
Who's that?

295
00:28:17,678 --> 00:28:19,077
May I help you?

296
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:23,349
Sit over here. Come on.

297
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:25,209
Please.

298
00:28:31,758 --> 00:28:32,747
Sit over there.

299
00:29:15,469 --> 00:29:17,096
Alberto!
Monica.

300
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:23,138
What are you up to, Alberto?
Are you shooting?

301
00:29:23,377 --> 00:29:25,208
- Yes.
- No need to introduce him!

302
00:29:25,412 --> 00:29:27,039
Pleased to meet you.

303
00:29:27,314 --> 00:29:29,908
Yesterday the Americans
gave me a screen test.

304
00:29:30,384 --> 00:29:31,942
It turned out fantastic.

305
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:36,248
I have a 16-millimeter print at home
if you want to see it.

306
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:53,095
Ladies and gentlemen, that was part
one of our show. Before you dance...

307
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:56,799
I'd like to salute and applaud
an illustrious guest who is...

308
00:29:57,277 --> 00:29:58,642
honoring us with his presence.

309
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:01,945
Must I applaud too, Alberto?

310
00:30:03,617 --> 00:30:05,676
Okay, boys! Mambo number 26!

311
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:14,260
Do me a favor,
come to our table.

312
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:17,328
A bunch of my friends
would love to meet you.

313
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:19,362
- Come on, Alberto.
- I can't.

314
00:30:20,634 --> 00:30:21,965
I'm with the lady.

315
00:30:23,503 --> 00:30:24,492
Let's dance.

316
00:30:46,326 --> 00:30:50,319
Mambo. The world turns
around the mambo.

317
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,554
What a mambo.

318
00:31:31,538 --> 00:31:34,166
Oh, boy! What a mambo!

319
00:31:41,248 --> 00:31:44,740
If you wanna be with your friends,
don't mind me.

320
00:31:46,253 --> 00:31:47,242
What?

321
00:31:47,454 --> 00:31:49,547
Don't let me keep you
from your friends.

322
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:51,417
That's enough. Let's go.

323
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,917
Good night, Commendatore.

324
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:15,948
Get in. Hurry up!

325
00:32:18,618 --> 00:32:21,382
- Did you eat?
- No. Well, a little bit around 8:00.

326
00:32:22,255 --> 00:32:24,723
- Let's get some supper.
- What?

327
00:32:24,925 --> 00:32:25,949
Let's have supper.

328
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,651
Good. Where are we going?

329
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,954
My house.

330
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,295
Wait! Wait a second!
Hey, Fancy Pants!

331
00:32:36,069 --> 00:32:37,593
I'm talking to you!

332
00:32:38,138 --> 00:32:39,127
Look at me!

333
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:44,037
Look who I'm with!
Up yours!

334
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:46,272
Know who this is?

335
00:33:19,146 --> 00:33:21,876
- Did anyone call?
- Nobody, Commendatore.

336
00:33:23,216 --> 00:33:25,707
- What do you mean nobody?
- Nobody called.

337
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:29,854
- Were you awake or sleeping?
- Nobody called. I was here.

338
00:33:30,056 --> 00:33:31,045
All right.

339
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,883
Supper for two in my room.

340
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:37,991
If Miss Jessie calls, I'm asleep.
If she insists, I'm asleep.

341
00:33:38,231 --> 00:33:40,722
If she still insists, I'm still asleep!

342
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:46,035
We'll eat upstairs.
What's your name?

343
00:33:47,574 --> 00:33:48,905
What?

344
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,905
Come on, move.

345
00:34:10,163 --> 00:34:12,222
What? Another dog?

346
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:28,381
Look at these!

347
00:34:32,586 --> 00:34:34,554
You got fish too?

348
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:38,290
Yes.
Now, where did I put it?

349
00:34:42,796 --> 00:34:45,287
- Leave it for the maid.
- But it'll get wrinkled.

350
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:51,301
Idiot! What made me do it?

351
00:34:52,072 --> 00:34:55,599
Did you ever see an idiot?
Well, you're looking at one.

352
00:34:56,276 --> 00:34:57,402
Just leave it!

353
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:19,889
Come.

354
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,238
What was your name again?

355
00:35:41,588 --> 00:35:43,419
Where are you from?

356
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,479
What?

357
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:48,488
- Where do you come from?
- From Rome. Piazza Risorgimento.

358
00:35:51,998 --> 00:35:54,364
Sit down. You're making me nervous.

359
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:12,942
You like it?

360
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:16,920
Kind of.

361
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,548
It's not really my thing.

362
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:21,723
It's not my taste, but, yes.

363
00:36:21,961 --> 00:36:23,952
Beethoven's Fifth.

364
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,531
I love it.

365
00:36:31,137 --> 00:36:32,126
Come in.

366
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,313
Leave it there.
I'll take care of it. Go.

367
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:49,521
And close the door.

368
00:36:58,898 --> 00:37:00,889
Let's see what he brought us.

369
00:37:03,737 --> 00:37:05,329
Caviar, lobster.

370
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:09,097
Help yourself. Eat.
I'm not in the mood.

371
00:37:10,343 --> 00:37:13,107
Help yourself.
I don't know if you like it.

372
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:17,615
1949...

373
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:21,149
1949...

374
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:25,019
Take that off.
It's hot in here.

375
00:37:34,701 --> 00:37:36,032
Guess I tore it.

376
00:37:38,638 --> 00:37:39,627
Where do you live?

377
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:41,435
Past the gas station.

378
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:44,041
- Where?
- On the road to Ostia.

379
00:37:44,644 --> 00:37:47,135
- You come to Via Veneto?
- Via Veneto? Me?

380
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:50,645
I work the Passeggiata Archeologica.
Much more convenient.

381
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:51,649
Why?

382
00:37:51,885 --> 00:37:54,410
I'm on the Cilia.
Subway takes me right there.

383
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:56,748
There's another girl,
my friend Wanda.

384
00:37:56,956 --> 00:38:00,653
She lives there too.
But I don't bother with the others.

385
00:38:00,894 --> 00:38:03,829
The others sleep under the arches
in Caracalla.

386
00:38:04,063 --> 00:38:06,759
Mind you, I have my own house...

387
00:38:06,966 --> 00:38:10,993
with water, electricity, bottled gas,
every convenience. I got everything.

388
00:38:11,237 --> 00:38:13,171
Even a thermometer.

389
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:15,334
See this one here?

390
00:38:15,408 --> 00:38:18,639
She never, ever
slept under an arch.

391
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:20,704
Well, maybe once.

392
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,906
Or twice.

393
00:38:23,316 --> 00:38:26,251
Of course, my house is...

394
00:38:27,086 --> 00:38:29,020
nothing like this.

395
00:38:29,856 --> 00:38:32,416
But it's enough for me.
I like it.

396
00:38:38,598 --> 00:38:41,465
Eat. Eat something.

397
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,631
What's wrong?

398
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:50,536
Damn it! I know who you are!

399
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:53,812
I know!
Can I say it?

400
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:55,870
Can I?

401
00:38:56,449 --> 00:39:00,317
Alberto Lazzari! I knew you
right away! I saw all your movies.

402
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,009
Very nice!

403
00:39:02,088 --> 00:39:03,851
Which is your favorite?

404
00:39:04,057 --> 00:39:05,684
Well, the last one.

405
00:39:05,892 --> 00:39:10,158
You had a costume with all that
stuff, then Vittorio Scraman came...

406
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,860
pushed the door open,
"Fermi tutti!"

407
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:15,027
Then it was his daughter.

408
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:17,333
That wasn't me.

409
00:39:17,537 --> 00:39:19,129
What do you mean?

410
00:39:21,674 --> 00:39:23,335
You're as good-looking
as your house.

411
00:39:26,646 --> 00:39:28,079
Bring the glasses here.

412
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,381
- Champagne.
- Sit down.

413
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,487
What's wrong now?

414
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:15,785
Who's gonna believe this
when I tell 'em?

415
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:19,687
They already think I'm full of it.

416
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,530
I might not believe it myself
tomorrow.

417
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:25,499
You have to do me a favor.
Give me a picture...

418
00:40:25,705 --> 00:40:29,641
and write, "Cabiria was here
at my house... Alberto Lazzari."

419
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:32,542
"Cabiria Ceccarelli was at my
house."

420
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:35,211
Write it just like that.

421
00:40:36,816 --> 00:40:38,010
Now let's eat.

422
00:40:38,217 --> 00:40:39,809
And you eat too.

423
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:41,344
An olive.

424
00:40:44,357 --> 00:40:45,824
Should I open it?

425
00:40:46,893 --> 00:40:51,353
Chicken! Some chicken breast
to chase away the blues.

426
00:40:52,065 --> 00:40:54,124
Here's your plate.

427
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:58,469
If you want to play more
of that music, I'd like it too.

428
00:40:58,738 --> 00:41:00,365
And what's this?

429
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,635
I saw it in a movie once.

430
00:41:05,078 --> 00:41:06,511
- Commendatore.
- Yes, Davide.

431
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:09,207
- It's Signorina Jessie.
- I said, tell her I'm sleeping.

432
00:41:09,282 --> 00:41:10,340
- She's here.
- What?

433
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:13,177
- She's downstairs.
-Just don't let her in.

434
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:15,717
She's already in.
She's coming up.

435
00:41:15,788 --> 00:41:17,619
Idiot!

436
00:41:28,768 --> 00:41:29,860
Alberto, open up.

437
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:32,896
- Who is it?
- Don't be stupid! Open up!

438
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:36,098
So? Open up.

439
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,071
It's very important.

440
00:41:39,278 --> 00:41:40,336
One moment.

441
00:41:45,385 --> 00:41:48,115
- The picture!
- Oh, yes. Hurry up!

442
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:51,046
Alberto, will you open up?

443
00:41:51,724 --> 00:41:53,351
Go in the bathroom a minute.

444
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:55,686
Yes. I'll get rid of her. Hurry!

445
00:41:55,895 --> 00:41:58,386
I'm not leaving.
I'll stay here all night!

446
00:41:58,598 --> 00:42:01,431
- Quiet, don't move.
- Open up.

447
00:42:02,468 --> 00:42:04,800
Alberto, please open the door.

448
00:42:08,775 --> 00:42:10,265
Open up, you bastard!

449
00:42:12,979 --> 00:42:14,310
What do you want?

450
00:42:26,459 --> 00:42:28,723
What's on your mind?

451
00:42:29,328 --> 00:42:31,558
I'm tired.
I have to be up early tomorrow.

452
00:42:31,931 --> 00:42:33,899
I'm working. You know that, right?

453
00:42:34,767 --> 00:42:37,133
I'm thirsty. Give me a drink.

454
00:42:37,437 --> 00:42:39,337
- What?
- I'm thirsty!

455
00:42:44,944 --> 00:42:46,639
Now what?

456
00:42:46,846 --> 00:42:50,509
I can't go on this way!

457
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,651
Well, neither can I!

458
00:42:54,253 --> 00:42:57,086
Your jealousy
is morbid, unbearable.

459
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:00,123
I'm tired of it.
I can't take it any more.

460
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:03,356
Let's call it quits while we're
still friends, okay?

461
00:43:04,997 --> 00:43:07,830
No. That's too easy!
I'm not going anywhere!

462
00:43:11,137 --> 00:43:13,765
Jessie, don't do this.
Get some sleep.

463
00:43:13,973 --> 00:43:15,873
You're tired and
I'm falling apart.

464
00:43:16,109 --> 00:43:18,100
We'll call each other tomorrow.

465
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:41,464
- I know you've stopped loving me.
- Who told you that?

466
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:43,464
You've stopped loving me.

467
00:43:43,836 --> 00:43:46,566
- Admit it.
- I'd never say such a thing.

468
00:43:46,806 --> 00:43:49,866
Admit it, and I'll never
bother you again.

469
00:43:50,076 --> 00:43:51,475
But I'd be lying.

470
00:43:52,378 --> 00:43:54,744
Even if we saw each other
occasionally...

471
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:58,675
every two or three days,
I'd be happy.

472
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:02,981
Why so seldom?
We could be together much more.

473
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:06,319
- Every day?
- Yes, every day.

474
00:44:06,526 --> 00:44:11,190
But stop being so jealous. Is it my
fault that women always look at me?

475
00:44:11,397 --> 00:44:14,389
But you're ugly!

476
00:46:22,328 --> 00:46:24,193
How do I get outta here?

477
00:46:51,223 --> 00:46:54,351
Hey, Cabiria. Alberto Lazzari's
been lookin' for you!

478
00:46:55,194 --> 00:46:57,662
I'm not even talking to you!

479
00:46:57,863 --> 00:47:00,195
- Don't listen to her.
- Who's listening?

480
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:01,890
Hey, Cabiria, there's Limpy.

481
00:47:02,101 --> 00:47:03,568
There's a winner.

482
00:47:04,437 --> 00:47:06,598
Hey, you old lecher!

483
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,737
Homesick for jail?

484
00:47:10,943 --> 00:47:13,844
Come on, Cabiria,
let's have a good laugh.

485
00:47:17,516 --> 00:47:21,782
Why'd you bring himalong?
Guess a weed never dies.

486
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:24,046
The Madonna might
have mercy on my uncle.

487
00:47:24,156 --> 00:47:25,145
What mercy?

488
00:47:25,224 --> 00:47:28,193
The pilgrims of the Madonna del
Divino Amorejust went by.

489
00:47:28,394 --> 00:47:29,759
I don't believe that stuff.

490
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:32,859
- Don't you believe in miracles?
- Not me.

491
00:47:33,065 --> 00:47:35,226
Should we go there on Sunday?

492
00:47:35,434 --> 00:47:38,301
We'll all have
something to ask for.

493
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:41,132
You goin', Cabiria?

494
00:47:41,374 --> 00:47:43,604
Me? I don't know. I'll think about it.
Besides...

495
00:47:43,776 --> 00:47:46,904
what would I ask for?
I've got everything.

496
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:49,912
I'll even be done
with the mortgage soon.

497
00:47:50,149 --> 00:47:54,245
But I might go anyway.
I haven't said no.

498
00:47:55,087 --> 00:47:56,418
We'll see.

499
00:47:56,822 --> 00:47:59,950
Think the Madonna would
waste a miracle on him?

500
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,154
Funny, huh? The Madonna knows
how you made your dough.

501
00:48:04,397 --> 00:48:06,797
Selling coke
and pimping women.

502
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:09,229
I'm going to see the Madonna...

503
00:48:09,435 --> 00:48:11,903
and I know exactly
what I'll ask for.

504
00:48:12,571 --> 00:48:14,801
Don't make fun of stuff like that.

505
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:18,840
You really want to go?

506
00:48:23,182 --> 00:48:24,615
What'll you ask for?

507
00:48:25,484 --> 00:48:27,850
I'm talking to you.
What'll you ask for?

508
00:49:37,556 --> 00:49:40,821
Hey, you! Shorty!

509
00:49:41,861 --> 00:49:43,692
Wanna lift?

510
00:50:06,085 --> 00:50:09,680
A shortcut.
He calls this a shortcut.

511
00:50:10,256 --> 00:50:12,588
I've been walking an hour.

512
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:14,759
Who knows where I am?

513
00:51:00,105 --> 00:51:02,505
You live in the caves too?

514
00:51:03,475 --> 00:51:04,737
I've never seen you before.

515
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:06,243
I've got my own house.

516
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:26,697
Gorgiano! Gorgiano!
It's me. Come up.

517
00:51:32,838 --> 00:51:34,169
How are you doing?

518
00:51:34,373 --> 00:51:37,206
Not so bad, thank you, sir.

519
00:51:37,943 --> 00:51:40,309
And where's Pietro?
Sleeping?

520
00:51:40,546 --> 00:51:43,709
They took him to the hospital
two days ago.

521
00:51:43,949 --> 00:51:46,850
Said he was in bad shape.

522
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:50,453
- And, you, what do you need?
- Whatever you want, thanks, sir.

523
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:53,049
Here's a blanket. Is that all right?

524
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:55,123
What hospital did they take Pietro to?

525
00:51:55,327 --> 00:51:57,227
To the Fratebenefratelli.

526
00:51:57,463 --> 00:52:01,331
All right, I'll visit him
if I have time.

527
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:16,912
Hey, Dark Hair.
Who is that guy?

528
00:52:22,788 --> 00:52:25,780
But who is he?
With some charity?

529
00:52:27,259 --> 00:52:29,090
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.

530
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:43,071
Can I help you?

531
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:47,438
Going back to Rome later?

532
00:52:50,649 --> 00:52:53,948
Can you give me a lift?

533
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,480
Yes, later.

534
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:08,155
Elsa!

535
00:53:12,671 --> 00:53:14,605
Ah, caro!

536
00:53:14,973 --> 00:53:18,602
I was expecting you Saturday,
but you came today!

537
00:53:18,811 --> 00:53:23,077
I was just thinking yesterday,
"He comes every nine or ten days."

538
00:53:23,282 --> 00:53:28,117
"He came Wednesday,
so he'll show up Saturday!"

539
00:53:28,787 --> 00:53:32,450
Bomba! But I know this one!

540
00:53:34,026 --> 00:53:35,926
Bomba, you live here?

541
00:53:36,695 --> 00:53:40,153
I wish I had everything I used to.

542
00:53:40,366 --> 00:53:43,301
A place in Rome, a place in Ostia.

543
00:53:43,502 --> 00:53:47,996
Showered with gifts!
Money in the bank! Jewels! Gold!

544
00:53:48,207 --> 00:53:50,198
I had five kilos of gold!

545
00:53:50,442 --> 00:53:54,208
She's not lying, you know.
Now who'd believe it?

546
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,380
But this one in her day...

547
00:53:56,615 --> 00:53:59,516
Here they don't even
make me comb my hair.

548
00:53:59,718 --> 00:54:02,653
But if I wear a low-cut blouse...

549
00:54:02,855 --> 00:54:05,653
and the white earrings, then... ha!

550
00:54:06,692 --> 00:54:08,557
Come, come, Elsa. Take this.

551
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:11,721
Oh! Look at the sweets you brought!

552
00:54:11,964 --> 00:54:14,694
And only for me!
None for the others!

553
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,868
Give it to me to hide.

554
00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:19,799
The one with the chocolate!

555
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:24,874
Pignoli! Look at the pignoli!
Like rainfall!

556
00:54:25,077 --> 00:54:27,978
Thank you, caro, thank you!

557
00:54:34,186 --> 00:54:37,417
And when will you be back?
When?

558
00:54:40,592 --> 00:54:44,551
God protect you from evil, my son.

559
00:54:54,106 --> 00:54:55,198
Of course...

560
00:54:56,542 --> 00:54:58,908
there's lots of starving people
in Rome, eh?

561
00:55:05,284 --> 00:55:07,445
You drive around at night a lot?

562
00:55:09,288 --> 00:55:11,779
Not as much as needed.

563
00:55:19,198 --> 00:55:20,722
How about during the day?

564
00:55:21,366 --> 00:55:24,961
No, in the daytime,
the poor wander about.

565
00:55:25,204 --> 00:55:26,865
How would I find them?

566
00:55:28,607 --> 00:55:30,199
Go figure.

567
00:55:31,743 --> 00:55:35,304
Me, I'm out at night too,
and I've never met you.

568
00:55:37,382 --> 00:55:39,714
But how'd you get the idea...

569
00:55:39,918 --> 00:55:41,943
the idea of doing this job?

570
00:55:42,154 --> 00:55:46,056
I don't even know myself.
Like that. Little by little.

571
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:53,487
We're here. There's your tram.

572
00:56:02,274 --> 00:56:04,265
Do you live far from here?

573
00:56:04,476 --> 00:56:07,468
About 19 kilometers,
on the way to Ostia.

574
00:56:09,081 --> 00:56:10,673
What's your name?

575
00:56:11,116 --> 00:56:12,583
Maria Ceccarelli.

576
00:56:13,852 --> 00:56:15,114
Are you alone?

577
00:56:16,088 --> 00:56:18,852
My father and mother
died when I was little.

578
00:56:19,024 --> 00:56:20,787
I came to Rome later.

579
00:56:23,996 --> 00:56:26,692
Now go and get some sleep.

580
00:56:42,014 --> 00:56:43,311
So I...

581
00:56:44,516 --> 00:56:47,212
Arrivederci.
Go ahead, tell me.

582
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,520
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

583
00:57:16,615 --> 00:57:19,106
Don Vincenzo,
the group from Rieti is here.

584
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:38,699
Get your prickly pears!
Fresh prickly pears!

585
00:57:38,904 --> 00:57:40,633
Gimme a hand, Maurizio.

586
00:57:56,321 --> 00:57:58,585
Wanda, get a load of this crowd!

587
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:10,464
There's the candle guy.
Come on, Uncle.

588
00:58:18,644 --> 00:58:20,578
How much for the candles?

589
00:58:20,779 --> 00:58:24,112
Take your pick.
I got some for 50, 100, 150.

590
00:58:24,316 --> 00:58:25,943
The biggest you got.

591
00:58:26,151 --> 00:58:27,584
We'll take two each.

592
00:58:27,786 --> 00:58:30,482
Wanda, the candles! Over here!

593
00:58:30,689 --> 00:58:31,986
Are these all right?

594
00:58:32,524 --> 00:58:35,254
I just want one. I'll pay for it myself.
Maybe I'll pay you later.

595
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,155
No, I'll pay for them all.

596
00:58:39,197 --> 00:58:41,893
- What'll I do with it now?
- Stupid!

597
00:58:43,368 --> 00:58:46,496
How much altogether?

598
00:58:57,482 --> 00:59:02,215
Make way! Sick man here!
Let us through!
