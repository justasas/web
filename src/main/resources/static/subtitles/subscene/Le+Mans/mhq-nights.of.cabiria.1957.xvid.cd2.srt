1
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:18,408
Make way! Sick man here!
Let us through!

2
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:23,040
So young!

3
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:26,321
We're over here! Wait for us!

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,252
We're gonna get photos!

5
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:34,354
- Come, Cabiria. They're calling us.
- I'm coming.

6
00:00:34,528 --> 00:00:35,552
Where's Wanda?

7
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:38,098
Wanda, come on!

8
00:00:38,332 --> 00:00:39,766
Marisa!

9
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:46,396
Get lost!

10
00:00:46,474 --> 00:00:48,340
With that nose
you want a photo?

11
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:50,568
Who's takin' the picture?
How much?

12
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:52,778
Now what do we do?

13
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:56,280
You need to confess. Down there,
where it says <i>confessione.</i>

14
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:58,383
I already confessed yesterday.

15
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:00,180
Watch out! He's a cripple!

16
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:32,114
I'm gonna ask for mercy
from the Madonna too. Like you.

17
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,151
What am I asking for?

18
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:35,822
You don't remember?

19
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:38,788
I could ask for a villa
in Peripli.

20
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:42,725
That's not what you said!

21
00:01:43,164 --> 00:01:44,427
Don't you remember?

22
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:47,431
I'll ask for whatever I feel like.

23
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:51,329
But you said you'd ask--

24
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:53,564
I changed my mind.

25
00:02:01,182 --> 00:02:03,117
Why are you talking like that?

26
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:05,684
See? You made
my candle go out.

27
00:02:07,788 --> 00:02:10,917
Thirty masses at 1,000 each.
That's 30,000.

28
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,483
I gave them 35.

29
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:15,094
Yeah, you did okay.
You never know.

30
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:24,631
How's the act of contrition go?
I forgot.

31
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:27,434
"My Lord, I repent
with all my heart."

32
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:30,168
- Yeah. What's after that?
- It's written in the confessional.

33
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:33,837
Wait here.
We can't go in together!

34
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:35,440
That's enough for now!

35
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:40,018
Use the other entrance!

36
00:02:45,025 --> 00:02:47,392
Take it easy. Don't push!

37
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:49,529
I'm sick. I can't help it.

38
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:52,698
He's sick too. Can't you see that?

39
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,061
Careful, Uncle.

40
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,134
- There's the altar, Uncle.
- I can't.

41
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:05,245
I can't go on. I can't move.

42
00:03:05,412 --> 00:03:08,246
I'll hold you till we're at the altar.

43
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:09,506
I gotta rest.

44
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:12,414
Rosie, come here.
I think he's gonna pass out.

45
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:15,851
Try again, Uncle.
We're almost there.

46
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:20,257
Everyone has a secret agony.

47
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:23,254
Everyone has a wish
for You to fulfill.

48
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:27,093
Open your heart to the suffering,
O Holy Virgin!

49
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:32,034
Mercy, Madonna!

50
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,368
Call out with all your hearts,
<i>"Viva Maria!"</i>

51
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:44,110
- Heal me, Madonna!
- Make me well, Madonna!

52
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:01,754
Wanda, over here!

53
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:09,002
Stay close.
What happens next?

54
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:10,296
I don't know!

55
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:13,440
You oughta hear my heart beating.
I'm shaking.

56
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:16,270
I feel so strange, Wanda.

57
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,851
Now all kneel and pray.

58
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:37,363
Amleto, will the Madonna
bestow Her grace on me?

59
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:40,033
I think so.

60
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:44,998
Now approach the altar
of the Virgin.

61
00:05:45,205 --> 00:05:50,143
Look into Her sweet eyes,
and in Her glance, each one of you...

62
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:55,245
will feel the light of hope
turned on in your heart.

63
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,668
Madonna, help me...

64
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,372
to change my life.

65
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,338
Bestow your grace on me too.

66
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:30,677
Make me change my life.

67
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,950
- Uncle, now!
- I'm afraid.

68
00:06:34,188 --> 00:06:36,623
Drop the crutches.
She'll have mercy on you.

69
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,883
I'm afraid!

70
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:38,948
I'm holding you!

71
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:45,266
Madonna, I'm a sinner.

72
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:46,891
A worm of the earth.

73
00:06:47,134 --> 00:06:51,071
Have mercy on me, Madonna.
Don't leave me!

74
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:25,333
Lost your tongue?
Have a drink.

75
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:28,508
Careful, Wanda.
One glass and she's smashed.

76
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:30,074
What are you doing?

77
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,738
- I'm thinking.
- About what?

78
00:07:32,913 --> 00:07:35,348
- What did she say?
- She says she's thinking.

79
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:39,612
Too much thinking
will make your head explode.

80
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:44,253
Look at those delinquents!
Stop with the damn ball!

81
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:45,984
They're doing it on purpose!

82
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,822
I'll fix 'em!

83
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,633
Next time I'll kick it
the other way!

84
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,349
You wanna stay here by yourselves?
Uncle and I will leave. Just say so.

85
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:13,214
- Why should we want to?
- What's wrong with you?

86
00:08:15,956 --> 00:08:18,221
- What if we wanted to?
- What's the matter, Cabiria?

87
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:21,285
Hey! Come over here
and get your ball!

88
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:24,329
Come over here
if you want it!

89
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:28,297
Go get her.
She can't even walk.

90
00:08:28,502 --> 00:08:31,336
I'm not gonna tangle with her.
She'll manage.

91
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:34,406
This music's boring!
Let's rock!

92
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:36,507
What are you doing, you nut?

93
00:08:38,846 --> 00:08:41,213
We haven't changed.

94
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:45,909
Nobody's changed!

95
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,323
We're all the same as before,
just like the cripple.

96
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:53,889
What do you want to change,
Cabiria?

97
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:59,328
You think this is the end?

98
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:02,730
You know what I'm gonna do?

99
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:06,772
I'm gonna sell the house.
Everything. I'm leaving.

100
00:09:07,174 --> 00:09:10,576
Good-bye, you guys.
I'm through with all this!

101
00:09:11,445 --> 00:09:12,435
Where'll you go?

102
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,843
Where? Think I'm like you?

103
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:19,517
I know where I can go. I know.

104
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:23,619
Just look at those little nuns!

105
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:28,957
Where you going
with that banner?

106
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:31,859
Looking for snails?

107
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:33,197
Why'd you make her drink?

108
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:35,759
/made her drink?

109
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:41,308
Did the Madonna give you mercy?

110
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:43,743
Did she?

111
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:46,580
Cabiria! You wanna get us arrested?

112
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:50,050
Amleto, look at her!

113
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:51,207
What?

114
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:52,579
Bring her back!

115
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:55,746
Leave me alone!
I wanna listen. Go on playing!

116
00:09:57,324 --> 00:10:00,761
Come here, kids!
Come enjoy yourselves!

117
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:03,393
Come dance with us!

118
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:05,793
Forget about your banner!

119
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:13,236
Why do you always butt in?
Get lost!

120
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:18,010
Cabiria!
You're in no condition for this!

121
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:21,080
- Leave me alone!
- You're blind drunk!

122
00:10:21,281 --> 00:10:24,774
Who's drunk?
What do <i>you</i> know?

123
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:25,339
Is the show any good?
Hey! I asked you a question!

124
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:27,741
You want me to say it stinks?

125
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,742
As you can see, ladies and
gentlemen, my assistant's head...

126
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,881
has been completely
impaled by the daggers.

127
00:12:06,353 --> 00:12:10,415
There's no doubt
that his head must be...

128
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:12,522
soaked in blood.

129
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:17,529
You'll be amazed to see, instead,
that his head has disappeared!

130
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:31,211
In the second part
of our show, we'll feature...

131
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:33,813
experiments with magnetism,
hypnotism and auto-suggestion.

132
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:38,213
Would anyone in the audience
care to volunteer? <i>Prego, Signori!</i>

133
00:12:38,452 --> 00:12:39,784
I will!

134
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:49,356
Come right up.
Don't be afraid.

135
00:12:49,563 --> 00:12:52,226
There's absolutely no danger.

136
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:02,575
We now need a representative
of the fair sex.

137
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:04,869
- How about you, <i>Signorina?</i>
- Who, me?

138
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:07,338
Yes, you! Good! Come up.
Be brave!

139
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:09,773
No, I don't want to.

140
00:13:10,016 --> 00:13:13,248
Would you leave those young men
up there all alone?

141
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:14,716
<i>You</i> go, then!

142
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:16,947
Come on, chickie!
We need a laugh.

143
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,625
Wanna laugh?

144
00:13:19,693 --> 00:13:21,525
Just look in the mirror!

145
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:24,296
Come on, <i>Signorina,</i>
don't make us beg.

146
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:26,456
Should I come and get you?

147
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,397
I'll come and get you.

148
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:32,437
Don't be afraid.
We're all good friends.

149
00:13:32,806 --> 00:13:33,967
They're all tricks.

150
00:13:34,207 --> 00:13:36,972
- Will you come?
- Sure! I'm coming.

151
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:42,077
Think I'm scared?

152
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:44,414
It's all fixed anyway.

153
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:48,555
There's no reason to be afraid.
You've showed how brave you are.

154
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:53,284
Come, you'll be fine.
Now, let's enjoy ourselves.

155
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,227
Oh, I'm so forgetful!
It's really unforgivable!

156
00:13:58,431 --> 00:14:02,630
I completely forgot that
<i>Signorina</i> Elvira is still inside.

157
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:10,142
Oh, this heat!
You're hot too, aren't you?

158
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:14,246
How about a nice boat ride?
Does anybody here get seasick?

159
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:16,973
I was on the Isle of Elba
as a kid.

160
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:19,085
You barely got to Ostia.

161
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:23,121
Nobody here gets seasick?
That's very good.

162
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:25,258
Ah, here's our boat.

163
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:29,122
We named her <i>Intrepid</i> because
she always defies the waves.

164
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:31,992
Come on, boys.
Don't make me beg you.

165
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:33,690
<i>Signorina,</i> you stay here.

166
00:14:33,934 --> 00:14:38,770
The boat is waiting. The sea is calm,
and the weather is fine.

167
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,664
I'm getting out of here!

168
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:42,206
Where are you going?

169
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,309
Damn, he's good!
He zapped him!

170
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:56,949
Look into my eyes!

171
00:15:03,897 --> 00:15:07,231
Take the oars
and start rowing.

172
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,475
The sea is calm, transparent.
Feel the breeze.

173
00:15:17,677 --> 00:15:22,012
Enjoy filling your lungs with air
saturated with salt and iodine.

174
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:24,048
Dolphins!

175
00:15:24,818 --> 00:15:27,083
Boy, look at 'em jump!

176
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:30,213
One of you doesn't feel so good.

177
00:15:30,423 --> 00:15:32,722
Things are looking bad, boys.

178
00:15:32,926 --> 00:15:35,691
It's the open sea now.
The waves are swelling.

179
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:37,694
Hear the wind whistling.

180
00:15:39,099 --> 00:15:40,192
It's a hurricane!

181
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:43,660
Help! Hold the rudder!

182
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:52,838
It's every man for himself!

183
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:02,779
<i>Mamma mia bella!</i>
I'm drowning!

184
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:21,241
- Scared, weren't you?
- You'd have been too!

185
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,876
You were plenty scared!

186
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:27,447
Where are you going?

187
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:29,977
- You mean me?
- Yes.

188
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,219
- Isn't it over?
- No.

189
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:35,821
It's not over.
You'd leave me here all alone?

190
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:37,918
What's he want now?

191
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:39,749
<i>Signora</i> or <i>signorina?</i>

192
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:47,297
- Did you have fun watching?
- Not really.

193
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,301
I'd like to talk with you
a moment. Come here.

194
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:54,505
- Are you from Rome?
- Yeah, I live in Rome.

195
00:16:56,776 --> 00:17:01,077
In what part of town?
Colonna? Parioli? Prati?

196
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:02,471
In Prati.

197
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:09,114
Come on, be honest with me.
Where do you live?

198
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:11,347
In Borgata San Francesco.

199
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,534
What's so funny?

200
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:24,602
Don't pay any attention to them.
They're just joking.

201
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,333
So, you're not married,
but you'd like to be.

202
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,344
Why should I get married?

203
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:34,347
- I'm no dope.
- Who'd marry her!

204
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:38,276
All girls want to get married.

205
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:42,786
I know a nice young man
who'd be happy to marry you.

206
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:43,846
Me?

207
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:47,050
He's rich, handsome,
rides a horse and drives a Ferrari.

208
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:49,956
Let's see if we can arrange it.

209
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,122
What type of work
do you do?

210
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:53,732
She's a countess!

211
00:17:57,237 --> 00:18:00,730
Listen, I'm fine the way I am.
I got everything.

212
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,737
And now I'm leaving.

213
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:07,412
I don't need anything!

214
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,470
That's a fact!

215
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:11,048
Even better.

216
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:15,814
So you're rich?
With a bank account, houses.

217
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:18,082
I own the house I live in. Okay?

218
00:18:18,324 --> 00:18:20,850
And now I'll get going.

219
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:23,018
One moment.

220
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:25,695
Don't make me look foolish.

221
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:29,529
At least let me introduce you
to the young man, Oscar.

222
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:31,998
Who the heck is Oscar?

223
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,702
Please step forward.

224
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:44,948
How elegant you look.

225
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:49,022
Come here. I'd like to introduce
you to the <i>Signorina.</i>

226
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:52,756
She wanted to meet you too.

227
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:56,722
A pleasure.

228
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,456
The pleasure is all his,
believe me.

229
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:08,969
Now that you've met,
I'll leave you two alone.

230
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:14,279
This is a beautiful garden,
filled with flowers.

231
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:19,543
You can talk, confide in
each other. No one is listening.

232
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:23,116
Look, <i>Signorina,</i>
Oscar is offering his arm.

233
00:19:23,323 --> 00:19:27,658
Come, <i>Signorina,</i> take his arm.
There's no harm in that.

234
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:31,262
But we just met.

235
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:34,733
You're strolling now.
The paths are full of flowers.

236
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:39,129
The birds are chirping.
Oscar dares not speak.

237
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:41,808
He's shy... sensitive.

238
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:44,068
Now he says, <i>"Signorina...</i>

239
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:48,612
"I've been hoping to meet you
for such a long time.

240
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:50,974
"May I ask you a question?

241
00:19:52,585 --> 00:19:55,180
"You're not spoken for, are you?

242
00:19:56,156 --> 00:19:59,024
"There was never
a man in your life?

243
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:01,925
"Ah, I thought so.

244
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:07,825
"I often see you standing by
your window, and at Sunday mass.

245
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:12,768
"Your eyes are always lowered.
You're always with your mother.

246
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:18,368
"That's good. Picking flowers
indicates a gentle soul.

247
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:23,040
<i>" Signorina,</i> may I hope
to see you again?

248
00:20:26,386 --> 00:20:29,788
"Ah, thank you.
What did you say your name was?

249
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:36,393
"Thank you. I'll save this flower
like a precious object.

250
00:20:36,696 --> 00:20:38,221
"Would you dance with me?"

251
00:20:38,464 --> 00:20:41,832
Play, <i>Maestro.</i>
Oscar and Maria wish to dance.

252
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:46,066
The orchestra will play
a beautiful waltz.

253
00:20:52,245 --> 00:20:54,908
"I'm wealthy, but I'm alone
and unhappy.

254
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:58,676
"What good are fancy cars,
long journeys and luxury hotels?

255
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:00,717
"Smoke! Illusion!

256
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:05,857
"What I really want is a home,
children, and a wife like you."

257
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:11,022
When I was eighteen, that's when
you should have known me!

258
00:21:11,664 --> 00:21:13,997
I had long black hair.

259
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,626
This long.

260
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:19,070
"For me, you'll always be eighteen."

261
00:21:21,407 --> 00:21:22,602
Then it's true?

262
00:21:23,076 --> 00:21:24,408
You really love me?

263
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:29,414
Is it really true?
You're not trying to fool me?

264
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:31,945
Do you really love me?

265
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:46,926
There, there. It's all right.

266
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:02,911
What happened?

267
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,782
What did you make me do?

268
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:18,731
Still here?
I have to close up.

269
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:20,232
I'm going! I'm going!

270
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:25,265
Listen, are those creeps
still out there?

271
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,770
Everybody's gone.
There's nobody left.

272
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:32,338
Now get going.
I gotta close up.

273
00:22:32,645 --> 00:22:35,114
I'll show them a thing or two!

274
00:22:38,117 --> 00:22:39,449
Pardon me, <i>Signorina.</i>

275
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:42,148
I'm Donofrio, accountant.

276
00:22:44,123 --> 00:22:45,614
Forgive my boldness.

277
00:22:47,026 --> 00:22:50,292
I don't normally
stop young ladies in the street.

278
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:52,362
I was inside
among the audience.

279
00:22:52,598 --> 00:22:54,590
Oh! You were there, watching!

280
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:55,928
Great show!

281
00:22:56,002 --> 00:22:57,493
I bet you like that stuff!

282
00:22:57,704 --> 00:23:00,970
If I ever see that slimeball again--

283
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,872
<i>Signorina!</i> Please,
don't misunderstand me.

284
00:23:05,178 --> 00:23:07,170
I agree with you!

285
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,045
In fact, I sympathize with you.

286
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:14,682
I came to tell you
how moved I was.

287
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:21,193
We can all pretend to be
cynical and scheming.

288
00:23:21,694 --> 00:23:26,826
But when we're faced with
purity and innocence...

289
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:30,200
the cynical mask
drops off...

290
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:34,469
and all that is best in us
awakens.

291
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:41,046
I wanted to thank you.
You did me good.

292
00:23:44,183 --> 00:23:46,049
It's gotten chilly, hasn't it?

293
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:51,419
Excuse me.
It's the nighttime humidity.

294
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:55,755
May I buy you something?

295
00:23:55,928 --> 00:23:58,830
I really don't know you.

296
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:06,397
Those damn creeps
are still there!

297
00:24:07,907 --> 00:24:12,038
Excuse my persistence, but
these experiments with magnetism...

298
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:13,839
are extremely dangerous.

299
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:17,915
They can cause imbalances
and other disturbances.

300
00:24:19,552 --> 00:24:22,386
<i>That's</i> why I felt so strange!

301
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:26,025
Cold, hot, sweaty.
Like I had a fever.

302
00:24:27,126 --> 00:24:28,424
How about that!

303
00:24:28,628 --> 00:24:31,962
I would suggest a <i>Fernet.</i>
It'll do you good.

304
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:34,868
Come, we'll sit down.

305
00:24:35,368 --> 00:24:36,859
Just a moment.

306
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:39,762
Please sit down.

307
00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:43,906
Two <i>Fernet,</i> please.

308
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:54,053
I swear, I've rarely suffered
as I did tonight.

309
00:24:55,455 --> 00:25:00,291
When that charlatan spoke words
of love to you in Oscar's name...

310
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:05,623
and you answered with such
modesty and trepidation...

311
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:07,490
it made me sick.

312
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:10,093
Something hurt me in here.

313
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,162
I was ill. Really ill.

314
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:15,137
Hurry up. I'm closing.

315
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:20,110
Don't be upset.

316
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:24,774
Some things cannot be touched
by human vulgarity.

317
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,620
Even amidst a crowd
that laughs idiotically...

318
00:25:30,823 --> 00:25:34,316
there's always someone
who understands, who knows.

319
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,285
Someone who appreciates.

320
00:25:44,203 --> 00:25:46,195
But what did I do?

321
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,436
You acted out a very tender
and delicate love scene.

322
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:54,339
I'm still deeply touched.

323
00:25:54,614 --> 00:25:56,446
I can't even express it.

324
00:25:58,317 --> 00:26:02,049
Yes. What struck me most...

325
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:07,187
is that deep inside,
you're as pure as you were at 18.

326
00:26:07,894 --> 00:26:10,659
When you went to Mass
with your mother...

327
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:14,361
and had long black hair,
falling down to here.

328
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:18,136
I really said that?

329
00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:21,163
Closing time.

330
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:22,797
How much?

331
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:24,170
150 lire.

332
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,246
- Thank you.
- Hey, you, go sleep at home!

333
00:26:31,484 --> 00:26:33,385
Listen, <i>Signorina.</i>

334
00:26:33,586 --> 00:26:37,023
What happened tonight is
extremely important to me.

335
00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:39,215
Just imagine, if you will--

336
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:44,657
I'm not from around here.
I just came here by chance.

337
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:49,859
I enjoy strolling in the city
in sections that I don't know.

338
00:26:50,202 --> 00:26:53,730
I went into that music hall
without knowing why.

339
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,503
There's no explanation for what
happened. As if guided by fate.

340
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:00,612
Yes, that's the word: fate!

341
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,078
But who are you?

342
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,713
You sound like you're from Parioli.

343
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,249
What do you mean?

344
00:27:06,452 --> 00:27:10,116
You talk like they do in Parioli.
A refined type.

345
00:27:10,356 --> 00:27:15,056
I told you my name is Donofrio.
I'm a government employee.

346
00:27:15,261 --> 00:27:17,059
What do you want from me?

347
00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:23,466
You might understand me better
after I tell you my first name.

348
00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:27,263
It's Oscar. My name is Oscar.

349
00:27:27,473 --> 00:27:29,965
- Your name's Oscar?
- Yes.

350
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:34,543
So what? Your being Oscar
could be a coincidence, no?

351
00:27:35,948 --> 00:27:40,443
Sure. But isn't it strange that
the hypnotist chose the name Oscar?

352
00:27:41,754 --> 00:27:47,318
<i>Signorina,</i> I really must see you
again. You're waiting for the bus?

353
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:51,223
Yeah. I'm dead tired.
I gotta get to bed.

354
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,559
Do we say good-bye now,
never to meet again?

355
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:56,929
Impossible.
I've got to see you again!

356
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,904
The city is vast and we still have
so much to say to each other.

357
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:06,140
When and where
can we meet again? Please!

358
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:10,906
I don't know. I'm busy. I work.

359
00:28:11,417 --> 00:28:14,683
I'm a salesgirl. Anyway,
what'll we say to each other?

360
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,650
- What?
- What would we say?

361
00:28:17,623 --> 00:28:20,684
There's the bus. So long.
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

362
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,523
Please, don't say no.
I work too.

363
00:28:23,763 --> 00:28:25,857
Maybe we can meet after work.

364
00:28:26,098 --> 00:28:29,660
Like tomorrow evening. <i>Signorina,</i>
wait, how about tomorrow evening?

365
00:28:30,036 --> 00:28:32,164
- In the evening I can't.
- Sunday afternoon, then?

366
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:33,031
Sunday?

367
00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:35,207
Sunday, the <i>Stazione Termini,</i>
at 7:00.

368
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:37,501
I don't know. I feel so strange.

369
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,643
What're you doing?

370
00:28:42,948 --> 00:28:44,007
Hurry. Let's go!

371
00:29:32,498 --> 00:29:33,557
Here I am!

372
00:29:35,935 --> 00:29:40,100
I was over there. Sorry I kept you
waiting. I was in the wrong spot.

373
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:42,774
Thank you for coming here.

374
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:47,206
You might have thought me
annoying, out of line.

375
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:49,609
It was all so strange...

376
00:29:50,116 --> 00:29:51,778
as if I were dreaming.

377
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:55,381
I took the liberty,
if you'll accept.

378
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:58,854
Thanks. You didn't have to.

379
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:02,586
My pleasure.
Let's go that way.

380
00:30:03,362 --> 00:30:06,958
He says he likes to talk to me.
And he talks and talks.

381
00:30:07,032 --> 00:30:08,432
Boy, does he talk!

382
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:11,967
The type who reads a lot.
Well educated.

383
00:30:12,204 --> 00:30:15,265
Last night we saw a first-run
movie at the Metropolitan.

384
00:30:15,474 --> 00:30:17,409
- Hey! That's your third!
- They're so good!

385
00:30:17,576 --> 00:30:18,874
I know they're good.

386
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:23,209
So we saw this first-run movie.
A costume picture.

387
00:30:23,415 --> 00:30:25,407
Gladiators, with Christian martyrs.

388
00:30:25,618 --> 00:30:30,386
He explained to me that
it wasn't a true story.

389
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:33,058
It's make-believe,
just for the movies, understand?

390
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,455
And then, he told me that...

391
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:39,130
he gets a kick out of
talking to me because...

392
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:41,129
because I understand him.

393
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,332
He's even good-looking.

394
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:47,097
Black eyes, brown skin.
A northern type.

395
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:49,537
Then we had pizza
at a <i>trattoria.</i>

396
00:30:49,608 --> 00:30:50,769
He always pays.

397
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:52,941
Even for the flowers.

398
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:55,774
- Nothing? He wants nothing?
- Of course not.

399
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:58,007
Do me a favor, Cabi!

400
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,810
I'll be meeting him again
tomorrow.

401
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,283
What's he after?

402
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:05,591
How do I know?

403
00:31:05,791 --> 00:31:08,784
And who cares?
As long as he pays!

404
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:09,984
Oh, sure!

405
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,259
The cops!
The cops!

406
00:31:16,468 --> 00:31:19,131
What you all need is jail!

407
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:20,931
Arrest them all!

408
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,372
I'm not running away.
If you want me, I'm here!

409
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:03,244
How are you?
How elegant you look today!

410
00:32:03,449 --> 00:32:04,815
How are you feeling?

411
00:32:05,751 --> 00:32:09,210
- Fine, and you?
- Thank you. Here. For you.

412
00:32:10,923 --> 00:32:13,392
- Thank you. You shouldn't have.
- Don't mention it.

413
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:15,117
- It's too much.
- Take it.

414
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,087
Where shall we go?

415
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,231
Wherever you want.

416
00:32:20,432 --> 00:32:22,401
It's a sunny day.

417
00:32:22,601 --> 00:32:24,331
Let's go to the <i>Aventino.</i>

418
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:32,640
Your family's not from Rome?

419
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:34,780
No. I have no family left.

420
00:32:34,947 --> 00:32:37,940
My mother and father died
when I was a child.

421
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:41,484
Loneliness is a heavy burden,
but I'd rather be alone...

422
00:32:41,654 --> 00:32:42,815
than make compromises.

423
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:48,518
We lived in Puglia,
in a small village.

424
00:32:48,761 --> 00:32:51,754
The name is unimportant.
You wouldn't know it.

425
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:55,968
I grew up in an old house.
I remember the oil lamps.

426
00:32:56,335 --> 00:32:59,999
My father owned a small plot
of land. His name was Giovanni.

427
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:04,172
My mother's name was Elsa,
the poor soul.

428
00:33:04,376 --> 00:33:07,278
I like the name Elsa.
It's pretty.

429
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:11,650
I had no brothers or sisters.
When my father died...

430
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,842
some ruthless relatives
robbed my mother...

431
00:33:14,019 --> 00:33:17,183
of what little property
she had, leaving us very poor.

432
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:18,880
I went looking for work.

433
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:44,241
What are you doing, my child?

434
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:46,070
Good day, Father.

435
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:48,110
Some alms for Sant'Antonio?

436
00:34:48,313 --> 00:34:50,373
Sorry, I've no money on me.

437
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:52,245
Never mind. Some other time.

438
00:34:52,451 --> 00:34:55,148
What's important is
to always be in God's grace.

439
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:58,323
You <i>are</i> in God's grace,
aren't you, my child?

440
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,722
You're not in God's grace?

441
00:35:05,664 --> 00:35:06,563
Why not?

442
00:35:11,804 --> 00:35:13,670
Everyone should be
in God's grace.

443
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:16,967
Whoever lives in God's grace
is happy.

444
00:35:17,176 --> 00:35:20,806
I'm in God's grace
and I'm happy.

445
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,139
I even went to the Madonna
to ask for Her grace.

446
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:30,254
Maybe you didn't know how to
ask, or maybe you didn't need it.

447
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:32,023
Are you married?

448
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:36,655
That's bad. Girls should get
married and make children.

449
00:35:36,862 --> 00:35:39,297
Matrimony is a sacred thing.

450
00:35:39,498 --> 00:35:43,299
In the grace of God, my child.
Ask Sant'Antonio for help.

451
00:35:43,502 --> 00:35:47,166
If you need me,
I'm Brother Giovanni.

452
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:53,274
I'm at the San Francesco
Monastery, but I'm hard to find.

453
00:35:54,146 --> 00:35:56,206
I'm always running around.

454
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:17,897
Hey, Blondie!

455
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:26,477
So long!

456
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:30,343
Tomorrow?

457
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:32,279
Tomorrow I'm busy.

458
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:34,477
Then the day after tomorrow.
Same time.

459
00:36:34,686 --> 00:36:36,314
I'm busy then too.

460
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:38,113
How come?

461
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:43,687
I was gonna tell you...

462
00:36:43,962 --> 00:36:45,863
I don't know if I'll keep seeing you.

463
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:47,191
But, why?

464
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,599
It's not that I'm uncomfortable
with you.

465
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:58,671
But what's the point?

466
00:36:59,778 --> 00:37:01,474
What am I doing with you?

467
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,376
We're both wasting our time.

468
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:05,649
And doing what?

469
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:09,045
Anyway, what do you
want from me?

470
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:11,848
If you want...

471
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:14,223
I'll marry you.

472
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,999
I wanted to ask you before.

473
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:29,166
But I didn't have the courage.
I've wanted to...

474
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:33,577
ask you since
the first time I saw you.

475
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,005
What are you saying?

476
00:37:38,016 --> 00:37:39,575
Marry <i>me?</i>

477
00:37:40,586 --> 00:37:43,852
What are you saying?
Marry someone you've seen ten times?

478
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:45,388
Someone you don't know?

479
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:47,420
That's not how it's done!

480
00:37:47,993 --> 00:37:51,589
Thank God I'm more honest
than some others.

481
00:37:51,863 --> 00:37:54,856
Excuse me,
but that's not how it's done!

482
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:57,596
What do you know about me?

483
00:37:57,903 --> 00:37:59,872
About who I am?

484
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:03,998
Is this how it's done?

485
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:06,844
You shouldn't fool somebody
this way!

486
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:09,512
Why pick on <i>me</i>
of all people!

487
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:11,612
Really!

488
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:22,786
I've asked you no questions, and
I don't want to know anything.

489
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:25,361
Who cares?

490
00:38:26,898 --> 00:38:29,060
Prejudices don't touch me.

491
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,702
Because what matters is...

492
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:37,773
is that I know your inner self.

493
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,103
We are... we are
two lonely creatures.

494
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:52,886
We have to stick together.
I need you.

495
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:56,922
Don't tell me that.

496
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,128
Don't say that, if it isn't true.

497
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:01,096
But it <i>is!</i>

498
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:17,679
What did you do?

499
00:39:18,517 --> 00:39:19,849
What is it, you nut?

500
00:39:19,918 --> 00:39:21,853
I'm getting married,
that's what!

501
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:26,486
He asked me to marry him! We're
buying a store in <i>Grotta Ferrata!</i>

502
00:39:26,692 --> 00:39:28,957
He's almost signed the contract.

503
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:33,121
Without me knowing, he arranged
it all: a store, a house!

504
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:37,997
I'm selling everything!
I'll sell the house... the house--

505
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:41,433
We're getting married
in two weeks!

506
00:39:42,274 --> 00:39:44,869
Wanda, I'm leaving!

507
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:46,972
Does he know that you--

508
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:49,712
Of course he knows!
I told him everything.

509
00:39:49,881 --> 00:39:52,009
I didn't hide anything
from him.

510
00:39:52,217 --> 00:39:54,311
But he's a saint. An angel!

511
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:57,387
He didn't want to know
anything. He didn't care.

512
00:39:57,656 --> 00:40:00,649
He loves me! He loves me!

513
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:02,791
Wanda! He loves me!

514
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:20,835
Who's there?

515
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:27,876
May I see Brother Giovanni?

516
00:40:28,086 --> 00:40:30,920
He's not back yet.
Why do you want to see him?

517
00:40:31,156 --> 00:40:34,422
- To confess to him.
- Go to church for confession.

518
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:39,024
I want Father Giovanni
to hear my confession.

519
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:43,168
He can't hear your confession.
He's not an ordained priest.

520
00:40:43,502 --> 00:40:46,597
I know, but...
I'll wait for Father Giovanni.

521
00:40:47,005 --> 00:40:48,906
Fine. Then wait.

522
00:41:01,286 --> 00:41:04,745
Why'd you pack this?
I'm not taking that!

523
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,191
Should I take the owl?

524
00:41:07,392 --> 00:41:10,624
Nah, it brings bad luck.
But I'll take the seashell.

525
00:41:10,862 --> 00:41:14,026
See if it fits.
If it fits, I'll take it.

526
00:41:14,232 --> 00:41:16,463
I sold that.
Put it over there.

527
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:21,105
What a waste!
Leaving all this good stuff.

528
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,433
- Here are the dishes.
- I sold them. Leave 'em!

529
00:41:24,643 --> 00:41:25,576
Them too?

530
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:28,236
Why not?
I got paid for them.

531
00:41:28,413 --> 00:41:31,383
It would've cost more
to move everything.

532
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:34,576
He sold everything back home.
So I'm selling everything too.

533
00:41:34,786 --> 00:41:36,652
We're starting over!
Everything new.

534
00:41:36,888 --> 00:41:41,485
Me, I'd have taken all the stuff.
Are you forgetting anything?

535
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,992
What could I forget?

536
00:41:43,228 --> 00:41:46,756
- Did you take the money?
- Of course! I'm no idiot!

537
00:41:47,799 --> 00:41:49,768
See? You forgot your fur.

538
00:41:49,935 --> 00:41:51,164
Fur? What fur?

539
00:41:51,837 --> 00:41:54,329
- No! I don't want that.
- How about giving it to my aunt?

540
00:41:54,573 --> 00:41:57,270
Sure, but hurry!
They're waiting to move in!

541
00:41:57,476 --> 00:41:59,809
Damn it! Those lowlifes.

542
00:42:00,011 --> 00:42:02,173
Close the suitcase, will you?
Tight.

543
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:05,906
Oh, <i>la mamma!</i>

544
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:15,754
Take one more look,
and then I'm getting married.

545
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:16,817
What?

546
00:42:16,895 --> 00:42:18,693
I'm getting married too.

547
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,592
What did I say? Nothing.

548
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,604
How do I look?

549
00:42:35,146 --> 00:42:36,876
Looks good on you.

550
00:42:37,148 --> 00:42:38,776
It cost me 1,200 lire.

551
00:42:38,984 --> 00:42:40,646
You got robbed.

552
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:42,950
You paid too much.

553
00:42:45,223 --> 00:42:46,657
Ah, my pocketbook.

554
00:42:47,292 --> 00:42:49,852
Good-bye, D'Artagnan.
Let's get going.

555
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:52,991
Time to leave.
Let's get going.

556
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:10,341
See them? I can't stand
those starving bastards.

557
00:43:13,919 --> 00:43:15,353
Let's go.

558
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,492
Here are the house keys.
I'm leaving. <i>Arrivederci.</i>

559
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:31,234
If you need anything, just tell
my friend, <i>Signorina Wanda.</i>

560
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:33,770
She'll write to me.
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

561
00:43:34,506 --> 00:43:36,372
Have a good trip. Good luck!

562
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,271
Thank you. Likewise.

563
00:43:54,292 --> 00:43:57,228
Never mind. I don't wanna
say good-bye to anybody.

564
00:43:57,629 --> 00:43:59,461
It's better that way.

565
00:43:59,698 --> 00:44:02,258
I'm so happy now,
and then all these people...

566
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:04,060
they'll ask questions.

567
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:05,296
Ah! Luciana!

568
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,131
I'm leaving.
I'm getting married!

569
00:44:07,372 --> 00:44:11,104
- Send us some wedding candy!
- I will!

570
00:44:13,578 --> 00:44:16,275
Say good-bye to Nando and
his uncle, and to everyone.

571
00:44:26,491 --> 00:44:27,754
Nice, eh?

572
00:44:28,793 --> 00:44:29,886
They're pretty.

573
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:36,995
You're getting married...

574
00:44:37,669 --> 00:44:40,434
and I never met
this fiancé of yours.

575
00:44:40,672 --> 00:44:43,232
I couldn't bring him
where everybody knows me.

576
00:44:44,676 --> 00:44:46,110
Here's the bus.

577
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:50,006
It's here.

578
00:44:58,189 --> 00:44:59,521
Ciao, Wa'.

579
00:44:59,591 --> 00:45:01,150
Why are you crying?

580
00:45:02,694 --> 00:45:04,026
Who's crying?

581
00:45:04,262 --> 00:45:06,128
Aren't you crying?

582
00:45:08,299 --> 00:45:12,361
I'll write the minute I get there
with my address.

583
00:45:13,505 --> 00:45:15,474
And you'll get married too.

584
00:45:15,874 --> 00:45:16,864
Let's go.

585
00:45:18,343 --> 00:45:22,678
Hurry, the suitcase.
I'll send my address right away.

586
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:37,527
Stay out of trouble. You'll...

587
00:45:37,595 --> 00:45:39,723
You'll get a miracle, like me.

588
00:45:39,964 --> 00:45:43,025
- Yeah, sure.
- It'll happen.

589
00:46:25,276 --> 00:46:27,177
- What are you doing?
- I want to pay.

590
00:46:27,378 --> 00:46:30,712
- But there's no reason.
- Please! You've always paid.

591
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:33,582
Anyway, what's mine is yours now.

592
00:46:33,785 --> 00:46:36,186
It's all the same, isn't it?

593
00:46:39,691 --> 00:46:40,715
Waiter!

594
00:46:47,365 --> 00:46:49,027
It's getting late.

595
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:55,035
You'll see how beautiful
the sunsets are up here.

596
00:47:02,247 --> 00:47:04,409
You want to get me drunk?

597
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,813
It's such a light wine.

598
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:17,493
The money.

599
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:21,130
Put it away.

600
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:24,666
It's my dowry.

601
00:47:27,972 --> 00:47:31,306
350,000 for the house.
That's all those crooks would pay.

602
00:47:31,509 --> 00:47:34,673
They knew I was in a hurry,
so they took advantage.

603
00:47:34,913 --> 00:47:37,974
Then I got all my money
from the bank.

604
00:47:38,183 --> 00:47:39,617
400,000.

605
00:47:40,351 --> 00:47:42,980
See? I made them give me
all new bills.

606
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:06,477
Because you never asked
if I had money.

607
00:48:06,945 --> 00:48:10,507
You, you're an angel,
a saint!

608
00:48:10,882 --> 00:48:15,047
If you knew what I went through
to end up with this money.

609
00:48:16,054 --> 00:48:19,218
I told you, I don't want to know.
Please!

610
00:48:19,724 --> 00:48:21,556
Let's get away from here.

611
00:48:23,228 --> 00:48:25,459
The beatings I took.

612
00:48:25,897 --> 00:48:29,459
You see, some guys are
just after a girl's money.

613
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:31,295
You wouldn't believe it.

614
00:48:32,036 --> 00:48:35,302
Everything for love.
But not that way.

615
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,505
But what about my old age?

616
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,476
Who worries about my old age?

617
00:48:41,412 --> 00:48:43,244
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

618
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:46,907
Waiter, keep the change.

619
00:48:47,752 --> 00:48:48,685
Let's go.

620
00:48:49,754 --> 00:48:53,316
I didn't want to go on
like that forever.

621
00:48:53,524 --> 00:48:56,392
I'd have quit if I could,
even tomorrow.

622
00:48:56,594 --> 00:48:58,529
I'd have gone away.

623
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:02,497
To live that way forever?
I already owned the house.

624
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,430
Know what me
and Wanda planned?

625
00:49:04,669 --> 00:49:08,197
We were gonna rent a newsstand.

626
00:49:08,439 --> 00:49:11,705
Understand?
Where are we going?

627
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,501
It's so nice here.

628
00:49:13,711 --> 00:49:16,112
Let's take a little walk. Okay?

629
00:49:17,181 --> 00:49:19,412
I don't even remember
how I started.

630
00:49:19,617 --> 00:49:23,247
I was a child,
that's all I remember.

631
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:25,046
And the suitcases?

632
00:49:25,123 --> 00:49:26,591
We'll take them later.

633
00:49:28,192 --> 00:49:30,855
You shoulda seen me at 15...

634
00:49:31,095 --> 00:49:33,326
with my long black hair...

635
00:49:33,398 --> 00:49:34,457
down to here.

636
00:49:34,666 --> 00:49:37,761
Who understood anything?
My mother just wanted the money.

637
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:39,460
Where are we going?

638
00:49:39,671 --> 00:49:41,970
I don't know.
We're just strolling.

639
00:49:42,874 --> 00:49:44,843
What's the name of that song?

640
00:49:58,790 --> 00:49:59,951
Won't you kiss me?

641
00:50:24,382 --> 00:50:25,372
Come.

642
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:28,719
I know a shortcut.

643
00:50:57,749 --> 00:50:59,445
Oscar! Where are you?

644
00:51:00,385 --> 00:51:03,514
What a bad boy you are!

645
00:51:06,257 --> 00:51:08,556
Look at these flowers.
Like 'em?

646
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:10,919
They stink, but still.

647
00:51:11,596 --> 00:51:13,792
I never saw flowers
like these before.

648
00:51:14,098 --> 00:51:15,293
Let's go.

649
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:16,865
I'm coming.

650
00:51:20,138 --> 00:51:22,937
Smell them.
What kind of flowers are they?

651
00:51:23,641 --> 00:51:25,872
What's wrong? Are you sad?

652
00:51:26,144 --> 00:51:27,578
Me? No. Why?

653
00:51:27,779 --> 00:51:30,146
You stopped singing.
Wait a minute.

654
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:37,655
Why don't we carve
our initials on the trees?

655
00:51:39,223 --> 00:51:41,317
Let's go. The sunset
is beautiful in the woods.

656
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:45,462
The sunset, eh?
Where do you wanna go?

657
00:52:01,245 --> 00:52:03,180
What a strange light.

658
00:52:18,629 --> 00:52:19,653
Beautiful, isn't it?

659
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:26,531
I guess there is some justice
in the world.

660
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:31,870
You suffer,
you go through hell...

661
00:52:33,377 --> 00:52:37,280
but then happiness
comes along for everyone.

662
00:52:39,817 --> 00:52:41,877
You've been my angel.

663
00:52:42,353 --> 00:52:45,221
Your hand is freezing.
Are you cold?

664
00:52:48,392 --> 00:52:50,020
Having regrets?

665
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:54,458
Beautiful, eh?

666
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,892
Look how deep it is!

667
00:52:58,169 --> 00:53:01,162
I'd love a boat ride
right now.

668
00:53:01,873 --> 00:53:04,399
Are there any boats
down there now?

669
00:53:04,642 --> 00:53:06,975
- Can you swim?
- Not me!

670
00:53:07,478 --> 00:53:10,346
I almost drowned once.
But they saved me.

671
00:53:10,548 --> 00:53:12,744
Just imagine!
I was pushed in!

672
00:53:16,487 --> 00:53:17,477
What's wrong?

673
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,202
What's the matter?

674
00:53:37,408 --> 00:53:40,071
You don't want to kill me,
do you?

675
00:53:42,146 --> 00:53:43,409
Answer me!

676
00:53:44,615 --> 00:53:46,607
You want to kill me?

677
00:53:48,386 --> 00:53:50,116
You want to kill me!

678
00:53:51,189 --> 00:53:54,353
Don't just stand there.
Say something!

679
00:53:55,293 --> 00:53:59,788
Speak! Don't be like that!
Speak!

680
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:02,589
Tell me.

681
00:54:07,805 --> 00:54:09,603
For... the money?

682
00:54:13,444 --> 00:54:14,810
For the money.

683
00:54:41,739 --> 00:54:45,767
Kill me! Kill me!
Throw me off the cliff!

684
00:54:45,977 --> 00:54:48,310
I don't wanna live anymore!

685
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:56,077
I don't wanna live anymore!

686
00:54:56,254 --> 00:54:59,986
Kill me! Throw me off the cliff!

687
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:04,255
I don't wanna live anymore!

688
00:55:05,596 --> 00:55:07,155
Go ahead!

689
00:55:07,365 --> 00:55:09,766
Shut up, stupid!

690
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:14,598
I don't want to hurt you.
Can't you see that?

691
00:55:15,273 --> 00:55:17,765
I don't wanna live anymore!

692
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:24,841
