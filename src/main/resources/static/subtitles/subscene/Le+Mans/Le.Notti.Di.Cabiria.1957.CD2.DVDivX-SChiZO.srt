1
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:48,847
So young!

2
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,128
We're over here! Wait for us!

3
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:56,059
We're gonna get photos!

4
00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:00,161
- Come, Cabiria. They're calling us.
- I'm coming.

5
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:01,360
Where's Wanda?

6
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:03,905
Wanda, come on!

7
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,573
Marisa!

8
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:12,203
Get lost!

9
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:14,147
With that nose
you want a photo?

10
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,375
Who's takin' the picture?
How much?

11
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,585
Now what do we do?

12
00:01:18,822 --> 00:01:22,087
You need to confess. Down there,
where it says confressione.

13
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:24,190
I already confessed yesterday.

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,987
Watch out! He's a cripple!

15
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,921
I'm gonna ask for mercy
from the Madonna too. Like you.

16
00:01:58,128 --> 00:01:59,959
What am I asking for?

17
00:02:00,196 --> 00:02:01,629
You don't remember?

18
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:04,595
I could ask for a villa
in Peripli.

19
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:08,532
That's not what you said!

20
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:10,234
Don't you remember?

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,238
I'll ask for whatever I feel like.

22
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:17,136
But you said you'd ask...

23
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,371
I changed my mind.

24
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,924
Why are you talking like that?

25
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,491
See? You made
my candle go out.

26
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:36,724
Thirty masses at 1,000 each.
That's 30,000.

27
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:38,291
I gave them 35.

28
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:40,901
Yeah, you did okay.
You never know.

29
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:50,439
How's the act of contrition go?
I forgot.

30
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:53,241
"My Lord, I repent
with all my heart."

31
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,976
- Yeah. What's after that?
- It's written in the confessional.

32
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:59,644
Wait here.
We can't go in together!

33
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,248
That's enough for now!

34
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:05,825
Use the other entrance!

35
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:13,200
Take it easy. Don't push!

36
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:15,336
I'm sick. I can't help it.

37
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,505
He's sick too. Can't you see that?

38
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:23,868
Careful, Uncle.

39
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:27,942
- There's the altar, Uncle.
- I can't.

40
00:03:28,117 --> 00:03:31,052
I can't go on. I can't move.

41
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:34,054
I'll hold you till we're at the altar.

42
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,314
I gotta rest.

43
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:38,221
Rosie, come here.
I think he's gonna pass out.

44
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:41,658
Try again, Uncle.
We're almost there.

45
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,064
Everyone has a secret agony.

46
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:49,062
Everyone has a wish
for You to fulfill.

47
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:52,900
Open your heart to the suffering,
O Holy Virgin!

48
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:57,841
Mercy, Madonna!

49
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:01,175
Call out with all your hearts,
"Viva Maria!"

50
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:09,917
- Heal me, Madonna!
- Make me well, Madonna!

51
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:27,561
Wanda, over here!

52
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,809
Stay close.
What happens next?

53
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:36,103
I don't know!

54
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:39,247
You oughta hear my heart beating.
I'm shaking.

55
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,077
I feel so strange, Wanda.

56
00:05:50,793 --> 00:05:52,658
Now all kneel and pray.

57
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:03,170
Amleto, will the Madonna
bestow Her grace on me?

58
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:05,841
I think so.

59
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:10,805
Now approach the altar
of the Virgin.

60
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:15,951
Look into Her sweet eyes,
and in Her glance, each one of you...

61
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:21,052
will feel the light of hope
turned on in your heart.

62
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:44,475
Madonna, help me...

63
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:47,179
to change my life.

64
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:51,145
Bestow your grace on me too.

65
00:06:54,857 --> 00:06:56,484
Make me change my life.

66
00:06:57,527 --> 00:06:59,757
- Uncle, now!
- I'm afraid.

67
00:06:59,996 --> 00:07:02,430
Drop the crutches.
She'll have mercy on you.

68
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:03,690
I'm afraid!

69
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:04,755
I'm holding you!

70
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:11,073
Madonna, I'm a sinner.

71
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,698
A worm of the earth.

72
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:16,878
Have mercy on me, Madonna.
Don't leave me!

73
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:51,140
Lost your tongue?
Have a drink.

74
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,315
Careful, Wanda.
One glass and she's smashed.

75
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,881
What are you doing?

76
00:07:56,452 --> 00:07:58,545
- I'm thinking.
- About what?

77
00:07:58,721 --> 00:08:01,155
- What did she say?
- She says she's thinking.

78
00:08:01,324 --> 00:08:05,420
Too much thinking
will make your head explode.

79
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:10,060
Look at those delinquents!
Stop with the damn ball!

80
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:11,791
They're doing it on purpose!

81
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:13,629
I'll fix 'em!

82
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:25,440
Next time I'll kick it
the other way!

83
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:36,156
You wanna stay here by yourselves?
Uncle and I will leave.Just say so.

84
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:39,021
- Why should we want to?
- What's wrong with you?

85
00:08:41,764 --> 00:08:44,028
- What if we wanted to?
- What's the matter, Cabiria?

86
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,092
Hey! Come over here
and get your ball!

87
00:08:47,303 --> 00:08:50,136
Come over here
if you want it!

88
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,104
Go get her.
She can't even walk.

89
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,143
I'm not gonna tangle with her.
She'll manage.

90
00:08:57,346 --> 00:09:00,213
This music's boring!
Let's rock!

91
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:02,314
What are you doing, you nut?

92
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:07,020
We haven't changed.

93
00:09:08,224 --> 00:09:11,716
Nobody's changed!

94
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:16,130
We're all the same as before,
just like the cripple.

95
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:19,696
What do you want to change,
Cabiria?

96
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:25,135
You think this is the end?

97
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:28,537
You know what I'm gonna do?

98
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:32,579
I'm gonna sell the house.
Everything. I'm leaving.

99
00:09:32,982 --> 00:09:36,383
Good-bye, you guys.
I'm through with all this!

100
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:38,242
Where'll you go?

101
00:09:38,487 --> 00:09:41,650
Where? Think I'm like you?

102
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:45,324
I know where I can go. I know.

103
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:49,426
Just look at those little nuns!

104
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:54,764
Where you going
with that banner?

105
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:57,666
Looking for snails?

106
00:09:57,707 --> 00:09:59,004
Why'd you make her drink?

107
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:01,566
I made her drink?

108
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,115
Did the Madonna give you mercy?

109
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:09,551
Did she?

110
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,387
Cabiria! You wanna get us arrested?

111
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:15,857
Amleto, look at her!

112
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:17,014
What?

113
00:10:17,226 --> 00:10:18,386
Bring her back!

114
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:21,553
Leave me alone!
I wanna listen. Go on playing!

115
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:26,568
Come here, kids!
Come enjoy yourselves!

116
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:29,200
Come dance with us!

117
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:31,600
Forget about your banner!

118
00:10:33,276 --> 00:10:39,044
Why do you always butt in?
Get lost!

119
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,817
Cabiria!
You're in no condition for this!

120
00:10:43,986 --> 00:10:46,887
- Leave me alone!
- You're blind drunk!

121
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,581
Who's drunk?
What do you know?

122
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:51,146
Is the show any good?
Hey! I asked you a question!

123
00:11:51,354 --> 00:11:53,549
You want me to say it stinks?

124
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:27,549
As you can see, ladies and
gentlemen, my assistant's head...

125
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:31,688
has been completely
impaled by the daggers.

126
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:36,222
There's no doubt
that his head must be...

127
00:12:36,532 --> 00:12:38,329
soaked in blood.

128
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:43,336
You'll be amazed to see, instead,
that his head has disappeared!

129
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,018
In the second part
of our show, we'll feature...

130
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,620
experiments with magnetism,
hypnotism and auto-suggestion.

131
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:04,020
Would anyone in the audience
care to volunteer? Prego, Signori!

132
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,591
I will!

133
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:15,163
Come right up.
Don't be afraid.

134
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:18,033
There's absolutely no danger.

135
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,382
We now need a representative
of the fair sex.

136
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:30,676
- How about you, Signorina?
- Who, me?

137
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:33,145
Yes, you! Good! Come up.
Be brave!

138
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:35,580
No, I don't want to.

139
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:39,056
Would you leave those young men
up there all alone?

140
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:40,523
You go, then!

141
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:42,754
Come on, chickie!
We need a laugh.

142
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:45,432
Wanna laugh?

143
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:47,332
Just look in the mirror!

144
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,103
Come on, Signorina,
don't make us beg.

145
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:52,263
Should I come and get you?

146
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:55,204
I'll come and get you.

147
00:13:55,411 --> 00:13:58,244
Don't be afraid.
We're all good friends.

148
00:13:58,614 --> 00:13:59,774
They're all tricks.

149
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:02,779
- Will you come?
- Sure! I'm coming.

150
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:07,884
Think I'm scared?

151
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:10,221
It's all fixed anyway.

152
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:14,362
There's no reason to be afraid.
You've showed how brave you are.

153
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:19,091
Come, you'll be fine.
Now, let's enjoy ourselves.

154
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:24,034
Oh, I'm so forgetful!
It's really unforgivable!

155
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,438
I completely forgot that
Signorina Elvira is still inside.

156
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:35,949
Oh, this heat!
You're hot too, aren't you?

157
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:40,053
How about a nice boat ride?
Does anybody here get seasick?

158
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:42,781
I was on the Isle of Elba
as a kid.

159
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:44,892
You barely got to Ostia.

160
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:48,928
Nobody here gets seasick?
That's very good.

161
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:51,065
Ah, here's our boat.

162
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:54,930
We named her Intrepid because
she always defies the waves.

163
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:57,799
Come on, boys.
Don't make me beg you.

164
00:14:58,007 --> 00:14:59,497
Signorina, you stay here.

165
00:14:59,742 --> 00:15:04,577
The boat is waiting. The sea is calm,
and the weather is fine.

166
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,471
I'm getting out of here!

167
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:08,013
Where are you going?

168
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:12,116
Damn, he's good!
He zapped him!

169
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,756
Look into my eyes!

170
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:33,038
Take the oars
and start rowing.

171
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:43,282
The sea is calm, transparent.
Feel the breeze.

172
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:47,819
Enjoy filling your lungs with air
saturated with salt and iodine.

173
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,855
Dolphins!

174
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:52,890
Boy, look at 'em jump!

175
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,020
One of you doesn't feel so good.

176
00:15:56,231 --> 00:15:58,529
Things are looking bad, boys.

177
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:01,498
It's the open sea now.
The waves are swelling.

178
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,501
Hear the wind whistling.

179
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:05,999
It's a hurricane!

180
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:09,467
Help! Hold the rudder!

181
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,645
It's every man for himself!

182
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:28,586
Mamma mia bella!
I'm drowning!

183
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,048
- Scared, weren't you?
- You'd have been too!

184
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,683
You were plenty scared!

185
00:16:51,787 --> 00:16:53,254
Where are you going?

186
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,784
- You mean me?
- Yes.

187
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,026
- Isn't it over?
- No.

188
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:01,628
It's not over.
You'd leave me here all alone?

189
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,725
What's he want now?

190
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:05,557
Signora or signorina?

191
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:13,104
- Did you have fun watching?
- Not really.

192
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:17,108
I'd like to talk with you
a moment. Come here.

193
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:20,312
- Are you from Rome?
- Yeah, I live in Rome.

194
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:26,884
In what part of town?
Colonna? Parioli? Prati?

195
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:28,278
In Prati.

196
00:17:30,826 --> 00:17:34,922
Come on, be honest with me.
Where do you live?

197
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:37,154
In Borgata San Francesco.

198
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:47,341
What's so funny?

199
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:50,409
Don't pay any attention to them.
They're just joking.

200
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:55,140
So, you're not married,
but you'd like to be.

201
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:57,151
Why should I get married?

202
00:17:57,686 --> 00:18:00,154
- I'm no dope.
- Who'd marry her!

203
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:04,083
All girls want to get married.

204
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:08,593
I know a nice young man
who'd be happy to marry you.

205
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:09,653
Me?

206
00:18:09,865 --> 00:18:12,857
He's rich, handsome,
rides a horse and drives a Ferrari.

207
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:15,764
Let's see if we can arrange it.

208
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:17,929
What type of work
do you do?

209
00:18:18,107 --> 00:18:19,540
She's a countess!

210
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:26,537
Listen, I'm fine the way I am.
I got everything.

211
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,544
And now I'm leaving.

212
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:33,219
I don't need anything!

213
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:34,277
That's a fact!

214
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:36,855
Even better.

215
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:41,621
So you're rich?
With a bank account, houses.

216
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,889
I own the house I live in. Okay?

217
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:46,658
And now I'll get going.

218
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:48,825
One moment.

219
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,502
Don't make me look foolish.

220
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:55,336
At least let me introduce you
to the young man, Oscar.

221
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:57,806
Who the heck is Oscar?

222
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,510
Please step forward.

223
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:10,755
How elegant you look.

224
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:14,829
Come here. I'd like to introduce
you to the Signorina.

225
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:18,563
She wanted to meet you too.

226
00:19:21,403 --> 00:19:22,529
A pleasure.

227
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:25,263
The pleasure is all his,
believe me.

228
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,776
Now that you've met,
I'll leave you two alone.

229
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:40,086
This is a beautiful garden,
filled with flowers.

230
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:45,350
You can talk, confide in
each other. No one is listening.

231
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:48,923
Look, Signorina,
Oscar is offering his arm.

232
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:53,465
Come, Signorina, take his arm.
There's no harm in that.

233
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:57,069
But we just met.

234
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:00,540
You're strolling now.
The paths are full of flowers.

235
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,936
The birds are chirping.
Oscar dares not speak.

236
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:07,615
He's shy... sensitive.

237
00:20:07,816 --> 00:20:09,875
Now he says, "Signorina..."

238
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:14,419
"I've been hoping to meet you
for such a long time."

239
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,781
"May I ask you a question?"

240
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:20,987
"You're not spoken for, are you?"

241
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:24,831
"There was never
a man in your life?"

242
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:27,732
"Ah, I thought so."

243
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:33,632
"I often see you standing by
your window, and at Sunday mass."

244
00:20:34,343 --> 00:20:38,575
"Your eyes are always lowered.
You're always with your mother."

245
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:44,175
"That's good. Picking flowers
indicates a gentle soul."

246
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,847
"Signorina, may I hope
to see you again?"

247
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:55,595
"Ah, thank you.
What did you say your name was?"

248
00:20:57,866 --> 00:21:02,200
"Thank you. I'll save this flower
like a precious object."

249
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:04,028
"Would you dance with me?"

250
00:21:04,273 --> 00:21:07,640
Play, Maestro.
Oscar and Maria wish to dance.

251
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,873
The orchestra will play
a beautiful waltz.

252
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:20,715
"I'm wealthy, but I'm alone
and unhappy."

253
00:21:20,956 --> 00:21:24,483
"What good are fancy cars,
long journeys and luxury hotels?"

254
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:26,524
"Smoke! Illusion!"

255
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:31,664
"What I really want is a home,
children, and a wife like you."

256
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:36,830
When I was eighteen, that's when
you should have known me!

257
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:39,804
I had long black hair.

258
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,433
This long.

259
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,877
"For me, you'll always be eighteen."

260
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:48,409
Then it's true?

261
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:50,215
You really love me?

262
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:55,221
Is it really true?
You're not trying to fool me?

263
00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:57,752
Do you really love me?

264
00:22:10,105 --> 00:22:12,733
There, there. It's all right.

265
00:22:27,456 --> 00:22:28,718
What happened?

266
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:31,590
What did you make me do?

267
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:44,538
Still here?
I have to close up.

268
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:46,039
I'm going! I'm going!

269
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,072
Listen, are those creeps
still out there?

270
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,577
Everybody's gone.
There's nobody left.

271
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:58,145
Now get going.
I gotta close up.

272
00:22:58,453 --> 00:23:00,921
I'll show them a thing or two!

273
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,256
Pardon me, Signorina.

274
00:23:06,294 --> 00:23:07,955
I'm Donofrio, accountant.

275
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,421
Forgive my boldness.

276
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:16,099
I don't normally
stop young ladies in the street.

277
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:18,169
I was inside
among the audience.

278
00:23:18,407 --> 00:23:20,398
Oh! You were there, watching!

279
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:21,735
Great show!

280
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,300
I bet you like that stuff!

281
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:26,777
If I ever see that slimeball again...

282
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:30,679
Signorina! Please,
don't misunderstand me.

283
00:23:30,986 --> 00:23:32,977
I agree with you!

284
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:35,852
In fact, I sympathize with you.

285
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:40,489
I came to tell you
how moved I was.

286
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:47,000
We can all pretend to be
cynical and scheming.

287
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:52,633
But when we're faced with
purity and innocence...

288
00:23:53,675 --> 00:23:56,007
the cynical mask
drops off...

289
00:23:57,045 --> 00:24:00,276
and all that is best in us
awakens.

290
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:06,854
I wanted to thank you.
You did me good.

291
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,856
It's gotten chilly, hasn't it?

292
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:17,226
Excuse me.
It's the nighttime humidity.

293
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:21,562
May I buy you something?

294
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:24,637
I really don't know you.

295
00:24:29,144 --> 00:24:32,204
Those damn creeps
are still there!

296
00:24:33,715 --> 00:24:37,845
Excuse my persistence, but
these experiments with magnetism...

297
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,646
are extremely dangerous.

298
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:43,723
They can cause imbalances
and other disturbances.

299
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,193
That's why I felt so strange!

300
00:24:48,396 --> 00:24:51,832
Cold, hot, sweaty.
Like I had a fever.

301
00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:54,231
How about that!

302
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:57,769
I would suggest a Fernet.
It'll do you good.

303
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:00,675
Come, we'll sit down.

304
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:02,666
Just a moment.

305
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,569
Please sit down.

306
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,713
Two Fernet, please.

307
00:25:16,892 --> 00:25:19,861
I swear, I've rarely suffered
as I did tonight.

308
00:25:21,263 --> 00:25:26,098
When that charlatan spoke words
of love to you in Oscar's name...

309
00:25:27,369 --> 00:25:31,430
and you answered with such
modesty and trepidation...

310
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:33,297
it made me sick.

311
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,900
Something hurt me in here.

312
00:25:36,478 --> 00:25:38,969
I was ill. Really ill.

313
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:40,944
Hurry up. I'm closing.

314
00:25:43,552 --> 00:25:45,918
Don't be upset.

315
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:50,581
Some things cannot be touched
by human vulgarity.

316
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:56,427
Even amidst a crowd
that laughs idiotically...

317
00:25:56,631 --> 00:26:00,123
there's always someone
who understands, who knows.

318
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:02,093
Someone who appreciates.

319
00:26:10,011 --> 00:26:12,002
But what did I do?

320
00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:17,244
You acted out a very tender
and delicate love scene.

321
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:20,146
I'm still deeply touched.

322
00:26:20,422 --> 00:26:22,253
I can't even express it.

323
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:27,856
Yes. What struck me most...

324
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,994
is that deep inside,
you're as pure as you were at 18.

325
00:26:33,702 --> 00:26:36,466
When you went to Mass
with your mother...

326
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:40,169
and had long black hair,
falling down to here.

327
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:43,943
I really said that?

328
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,970
Closing time.

329
00:26:47,616 --> 00:26:48,605
How much?

330
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:49,977
150 lire.

331
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:57,053
- Thank you.
- Hey, you, go sleep at home!

332
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:59,192
Listen, Signorina.

333
00:26:59,394 --> 00:27:02,830
What happened tonight is
extremely important to me.

334
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:05,022
Just imagine, if you will...

335
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:10,464
I'm not from around here.
I just came here by chance.

336
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:15,666
I enjoy strolling in the city
in sections that I don't know.

337
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:19,538
I went into that music hall
without knowing why.

338
00:27:19,748 --> 00:27:24,310
There's no explanation for what
happened. As if guided by fate.

339
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,419
Yes, that's the word: fate!

340
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:27,885
But who are you?

341
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:30,520
You sound like you're from Parioli.

342
00:27:30,725 --> 00:27:32,056
What do you mean?

343
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,923
You talk like they do in Parioli.
A refined type.

344
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:40,863
I told you my name is Donofrio.
I'm a government employee.

345
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:42,866
What do you want from me?

346
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:49,273
You might understand me better
after I tell you my first name.

347
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:53,070
It's Oscar. My name is Oscar.

348
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:55,772
- Your name's Oscar?
- Yes.

349
00:27:56,584 --> 00:28:00,350
So what? Your being Oscar
could be a coincidence, no?

350
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:06,250
Sure. But isn't it strange that
the hypnotist chose the name Oscar?

351
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:13,125
Signorina, I really must see you
again. You're waiting for the bus?

352
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:17,030
Yeah. I'm dead tired.
I gotta get to bed.

353
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:20,366
Do we say good-bye now,
never to meet again?

354
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:22,736
Impossible.
I've got to see you again!

355
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:28,711
The city is vast and we still have
so much to say to each other.

356
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:31,947
When and where
can we meet again? Please!

357
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:36,713
I don't know. I'm busy. I work.

358
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:40,490
I'm a salesgirl. Anyway,
what'll we say to each other?

359
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:42,458
- What?
- What would we say?

360
00:28:43,431 --> 00:28:46,491
There's the bus. So long.
Arrivederci.

361
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:49,330
Please, don't say no.
I work too.

362
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:51,664
Maybe we can meet after work.

363
00:28:51,906 --> 00:28:55,467
Like tomorrow evening. Signorina,
wait, how about tomorrow evening?

364
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:57,971
- In the evening I can't.
- Sunday afternoon, then?

365
00:28:58,179 --> 00:28:58,838
Sunday?

366
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,014
Sunday, the Stazione Termini,
at 7:00.

367
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:03,308
I don't know. I feel so strange.

368
00:29:07,188 --> 00:29:08,450
What're you doing?

369
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:09,815
Hurry. Let's go!

370
00:29:58,306 --> 00:29:59,364
Here I am!

371
00:30:01,743 --> 00:30:05,907
I was over there. Sorry I kept you
waiting. I was in the wrong spot.

372
00:30:06,147 --> 00:30:08,581
Thank you for coming here.

373
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,013
You might have thought me
annoying, out of line.

374
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:15,416
It was all so strange...

375
00:30:15,924 --> 00:30:17,585
as if I were dreaming.

376
00:30:18,993 --> 00:30:21,188
I took the liberty,
if you'll accept.

377
00:30:21,396 --> 00:30:24,661
Thanks. You didn't have to.

378
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:28,393
My pleasure.
Let's go that way.

379
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,765
He says he likes to talk to me.
And he talks and talks.

380
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:34,240
Boy, does he talk!

381
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:37,774
The type who reads a lot.
Well educated.

382
00:30:38,012 --> 00:30:41,072
Last night we saw a first-run
movie at the Metropolitan.

383
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:43,216
- Hey! That's your third!
- They're so good!

384
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:44,681
I know they're good.

385
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:49,016
So we saw this first-run movie.
A costume picture.

386
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,215
Gladiators, with Christian martyrs.

387
00:30:51,426 --> 00:30:56,193
He explained to me that
it wasn't a true story.

388
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,865
It's make-believe,
just for the movies, understand?

389
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,262
And then, he told me that...

390
00:31:01,536 --> 00:31:04,937
he gets a kick out of
talking to me because...

391
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:06,936
because I understand him.

392
00:31:07,308 --> 00:31:09,139
He's even good-looking.

393
00:31:09,377 --> 00:31:12,904
Black eyes, brown skin.
A northern type.

394
00:31:13,114 --> 00:31:15,344
Then we had pizza
at a trattoria.

395
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:16,576
He always pays.

396
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:18,748
Even for the flowers.

397
00:31:18,987 --> 00:31:21,581
- Nothing? He wants nothing?
- Of course not.

398
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:23,814
Do me a favor, Cabi!

399
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:26,618
I'll be meeting him again
tomorrow.

400
00:31:26,828 --> 00:31:28,090
What's he after?

401
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:31,398
How do I know?

402
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,591
And who cares?
As long as he pays!

403
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:35,791
Oh, sure!

404
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:40,066
The cops!
The cops!

405
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:44,939
What you all need is jail!

406
00:31:45,146 --> 00:31:46,738
Arrest them all!

407
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:50,179
I'm not running away.
If you want me, I'm here!

408
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:29,051
How are you?
How elegant you look today!

409
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:30,622
How are you feeling?

410
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:35,017
- Fine, and you?
- Thank you. Here. For you.

411
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:39,199
- Thank you. You shouldn't have.
- Don't mention it.

412
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,924
- It's too much.
- Take it.

413
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,894
Where shall we go?

414
00:32:44,138 --> 00:32:46,038
Wherever you want.

415
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,208
It's a sunny day.

416
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:50,138
Let's go to the Aventino.

417
00:32:55,717 --> 00:32:58,447
Your family's not from Rome?

418
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,588
No. I have no family left.

419
00:33:00,755 --> 00:33:03,747
My mother and father died
when I was a child.

420
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:07,291
Loneliness is a heavy burden,
but I'd rather be alone...

421
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:08,622
than make compromises.

422
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:14,325
We lived in Puglia,
in a small village.

423
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:17,561
The name is unimportant.
You wouldn't know it.

424
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,775
I grew up in an old house.
I remember the oil lamps.

425
00:33:22,143 --> 00:33:25,806
My father owned a small plot
of land. His name was Giovanni.

426
00:33:27,749 --> 00:33:29,979
My mother's name was Elsa,
the poor soul.

427
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:33,085
I like the name Elsa.
It's pretty.

428
00:33:34,022 --> 00:33:37,458
I had no brothers or sisters.
When my father died...

429
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:39,650
some ruthless relatives
robbed my mother...

430
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:42,990
of what little property
she had, leaving us very poor.

431
00:33:43,197 --> 00:33:44,687
I went looking for work.

432
00:35:07,682 --> 00:35:10,048
What are you doing, my child?

433
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:11,877
Good day, Father.

434
00:35:12,086 --> 00:35:13,917
Some alms for Sant'Antonio?

435
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:16,181
Sorry, I've no money on me.

436
00:35:16,357 --> 00:35:18,052
Never mind. Some other time.

437
00:35:18,259 --> 00:35:20,955
What's important is
to always be in God's grace.

438
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:24,130
You are in God's grace,
aren't you, my child?

439
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,530
You're not in God's grace?

440
00:35:31,472 --> 00:35:32,370
Why not?

441
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:39,477
Everyone should be
in God's grace.

442
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:42,774
Whoever lives in God's grace
is happy.

443
00:35:42,984 --> 00:35:46,613
I'm in God's grace
and I'm happy.

444
00:35:47,488 --> 00:35:50,946
I even went to the Madonna
to ask for Her grace.

445
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:56,062
Maybe you didn't know how to
ask, or maybe you didn't need it.

446
00:35:56,397 --> 00:35:57,830
Are you married?

447
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,463
That's bad. Girls should get
married and make children.

448
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,104
Matrimony is a sacred thing.

449
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:09,106
In the grace of God, my child.
Ask Sant'Antonio for help.

450
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,973
If you need me,
I'm Brother Giovanni.

451
00:36:14,816 --> 00:36:19,082
I'm at the San Francesco
Monastery, but I'm hard to find.

452
00:36:19,954 --> 00:36:22,013
I'm always running around.

453
00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:43,704
Hey, Blondie!

454
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:52,285
So long!

455
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:56,150
Tomorrow?

456
00:36:56,357 --> 00:36:58,086
Tomorrow I'm busy.

457
00:36:58,226 --> 00:37:00,285
Then the day after tomorrow.
Same time.

458
00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:02,121
I'm busy then too.

459
00:37:02,897 --> 00:37:03,921
How come?

460
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:09,495
I was gonna tell you...

461
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,670
I don't know if I'll keep seeing you.

462
00:37:11,906 --> 00:37:12,998
But, why?

463
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:20,406
It's not that I'm uncomfortable
with you.

464
00:37:22,817 --> 00:37:24,478
But what's the point?

465
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:27,281
What am I doing with you?

466
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:29,183
We're both wasting our time.

467
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:31,456
And doing what?

468
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:34,853
Anyway, what do you
want from me?

469
00:37:36,097 --> 00:37:37,655
If you want...

470
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:40,030
I'll marry you.

471
00:37:47,508 --> 00:37:49,806
I wanted to ask you before.

472
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:54,973
But I didn't have the courage.
I've wanted to...

473
00:37:56,517 --> 00:37:59,384
ask you since
the first time I saw you.

474
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:02,813
What are you saying?

475
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,382
Marry me?

476
00:38:06,394 --> 00:38:09,659
What are you saying?
Marry someone you've seen ten times?

477
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,195
Someone you don't know?

478
00:38:11,532 --> 00:38:13,227
That's not how it's done!

479
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:17,396
Thank God I'm more honest
than some others.

480
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:20,664
Excuse me,
but that's not how it's done!

481
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:23,403
What do you know about me?

482
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:25,679
About who I am?

483
00:38:27,315 --> 00:38:29,806
Is this how it's done?

484
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:32,651
You shouldn't fool somebody
this way!

485
00:38:32,987 --> 00:38:35,319
Why pick on me
of all people!

486
00:38:36,157 --> 00:38:37,419
Really!

487
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:48,593
I've asked you no questions, and
I don't want to know anything.

488
00:38:49,837 --> 00:38:51,168
Who cares?

489
00:38:52,707 --> 00:38:54,868
Prejudices don't touch me.

490
00:38:57,278 --> 00:39:00,509
Because what matters is...

491
00:39:01,282 --> 00:39:03,580
is that I know your inner self.

492
00:39:04,418 --> 00:39:07,910
We are... we are
two lonely creatures.

493
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:18,693
We have to stick together.
I need you.

494
00:39:21,102 --> 00:39:22,729
Don't tell me that.

495
00:39:24,138 --> 00:39:25,935
Don't say that, if it isn't true.

496
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:26,903
But it is!

497
00:39:41,655 --> 00:39:43,486
What did you do?

498
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:45,656
What is it, you nut?

499
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:47,660
I'm getting married,
that's what!

500
00:39:48,129 --> 00:39:52,293
He asked me to marry him! We're
buying a store in Grotta Ferrata!

501
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,764
He's almost signed the contract.

502
00:39:54,969 --> 00:39:58,928
Without me knowing, he arranged
it all: a store, a house!

503
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,804
I'm selling everything!
I'll sell the house... the house...

504
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:07,240
We're getting married
in two weeks!

505
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:10,676
Wanda, I'm leaving!

506
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,779
Does he know that you...

507
00:40:13,187 --> 00:40:15,519
Of course he knows!
I told him everything.

508
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:17,816
I didn't hide anything
from him.

509
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:20,118
But he's a saint. An angel!

510
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:23,194
He didn't want to know
anything. He didn't care.

511
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:26,456
He loves me! He loves me!

512
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:28,598
Wanda! He loves me!

513
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:46,643
Who's there?

514
00:40:52,193 --> 00:40:53,683
May I see Brother Giovanni?

515
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:56,727
He's not back yet.
Why do you want to see him?

516
00:40:56,964 --> 00:41:00,229
- To confess to him.
- Go to church for confession.

517
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:04,831
I want Father Giovanni
to hear my confession.

518
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:08,975
He can't hear your confession.
He's not an ordained priest.

519
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,404
I know, but...
I'll wait for Father Giovanni.

520
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:14,713
Fine. Then wait.

521
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:30,552
Why'd you pack this?
I'm not taking that!

522
00:41:31,098 --> 00:41:32,998
Should I take the owl?

523
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,431
Nah, it brings bad luck.
But I'll take the seashell.

524
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,833
See if it fits.
If it fits, I'll take it.

525
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,270
I sold that.
Put it over there.

526
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,913
What a waste!
Leaving all this good stuff.

527
00:41:47,248 --> 00:41:50,240
- Here are the dishes.
- I sold them. Leave 'em!

528
00:41:50,451 --> 00:41:51,383
Them too?

529
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:54,043
Why not?
I got paid for them.

530
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:57,190
It would've cost more
to move everything.

531
00:41:57,391 --> 00:42:00,383
He sold everything back home.
So I'm selling everything too.

532
00:42:00,594 --> 00:42:02,459
We're starting over!
Everything new.

533
00:42:02,696 --> 00:42:07,292
Me, I'd have taken all the stuff.
Are you forgetting anything?

534
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:08,799
What could I forget?

535
00:42:09,036 --> 00:42:12,563
- Did you take the money?
- Of course! I'm no idiot!

536
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:15,575
See? You forgot your fur.

537
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:16,971
Fur? What fur?

538
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:20,136
- No! I don't want that.
- How about giving it to my aunt?

539
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:23,077
Sure, but hurry!
They're waiting to move in!

540
00:42:23,284 --> 00:42:25,616
Damn it! Those lowlifes.

541
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:27,980
Close the suitcase, will you?
Tight.

542
00:42:30,724 --> 00:42:31,713
Oh, la mamma!

543
00:42:37,898 --> 00:42:41,561
Take one more look,
and then I'm getting married.

544
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:42,624
What?

545
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:44,500
I'm getting married too.

546
00:42:44,738 --> 00:42:46,399
What did I say? Nothing.

547
00:42:57,318 --> 00:42:59,411
How do I look?

548
00:43:00,955 --> 00:43:02,684
Looks good on you.

549
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:04,584
It cost me 1,200 lire.

550
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:06,453
You got robbed.

551
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:08,758
You paid too much.

552
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:12,464
Ah, my pocketbook.

553
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,660
Good-bye, D'Artagnan.
Let's get going.

554
00:43:16,604 --> 00:43:18,799
Time to leave.
Let's get going.

555
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,148
See them? I can't stand
those starving bastards.

556
00:43:39,727 --> 00:43:41,160
Let's go.

557
00:43:47,568 --> 00:43:51,299
Here are the house keys.
I'm leaving. Arrivederci.

558
00:43:53,207 --> 00:43:57,041
If you need anything, just tell
my friend, Signorina Wanda.

559
00:43:57,211 --> 00:43:59,577
She'll write to me.
Arrivederci.

560
00:44:00,314 --> 00:44:02,179
Have a good trip. Good luck!

561
00:44:02,383 --> 00:44:04,078
Thank you. Likewise.

562
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,035
Never mind. I don't wanna
say good-bye to anybody.

563
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:25,268
It's better that way.

564
00:44:25,506 --> 00:44:28,066
I'm so happy now,
and then all these people...

565
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:29,867
they'll ask questions.

566
00:44:29,943 --> 00:44:31,103
Ah! Luciana!

567
00:44:31,312 --> 00:44:32,939
I'm leaving.
I'm getting married!

568
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,911
- Send us some wedding candy!
- I will!

569
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:42,082
Say good-bye to Nando and
his uncle, and to everyone.

570
00:44:52,299 --> 00:44:53,561
Nice, eh?

571
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:55,693
They're pretty.

572
00:45:01,141 --> 00:45:02,802
You're getting married...

573
00:45:03,477 --> 00:45:06,241
and I never met
this fiance of yours.

574
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,040
I couldn't bring him
where everybody knows me.

575
00:45:10,484 --> 00:45:11,917
Here's the bus.

576
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:15,813
It's here.

577
00:45:23,997 --> 00:45:25,328
Ciao, Wa'.

578
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:26,957
Why are you crying?

579
00:45:28,502 --> 00:45:29,833
Who's crying?

580
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,935
Aren't you crying?

581
00:45:34,108 --> 00:45:38,169
I'll write the minute I get there
with my address.

582
00:45:39,313 --> 00:45:41,281
And you'll get married too.

583
00:45:41,682 --> 00:45:42,671
Let's go.

584
00:45:44,151 --> 00:45:48,485
Hurry, the suitcase.
I'll send my address right away.

585
00:45:59,933 --> 00:46:03,334
Stay out of trouble. You'll...

586
00:46:03,404 --> 00:46:05,531
You'll get a miracle, like me.

587
00:46:05,773 --> 00:46:08,833
- Yeah, sure.
- It'll happen.

588
00:46:51,084 --> 00:46:52,984
- What are you doing?
- I want to pay.

589
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:56,520
- But there's no reason.
- Please! You've always paid.

590
00:46:57,057 --> 00:46:59,389
Anyway, what's mine is yours now.

591
00:46:59,593 --> 00:47:01,993
It's all the same, isn't it?

592
00:47:05,499 --> 00:47:06,523
Waiter!

593
00:47:13,173 --> 00:47:14,834
It's getting late.

594
00:47:18,078 --> 00:47:20,842
You'll see how beautiful
the sunsets are up here.

595
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:30,216
You want to get me drunk?

596
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:32,620
It's such a light wine.

597
00:47:41,935 --> 00:47:43,300
The money.

598
00:47:45,606 --> 00:47:46,937
Put it away.

599
00:47:49,142 --> 00:47:50,473
It's my dowry.

600
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:57,113
350,000 for the house.
That's all those crooks would pay.

601
00:47:57,317 --> 00:48:00,480
They knew I was in a hurry,
so they took advantage.

602
00:48:00,721 --> 00:48:03,781
Then I got all my money
from the bank.

603
00:48:03,991 --> 00:48:05,424
400,000.

604
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:08,787
See? I made them give me
all new bills.

605
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:32,284
Because you never asked
if I had money.

606
00:48:32,753 --> 00:48:36,314
You, you're an angel,
a saint!

607
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:40,854
If you knew what I went through
to end up with this money.

608
00:48:41,862 --> 00:48:45,025
I told you, I don't want to know.
Please!

609
00:48:45,532 --> 00:48:47,363
Let's get away from here.

610
00:48:49,036 --> 00:48:51,266
The beatings I took.

611
00:48:51,705 --> 00:48:55,266
You see, some guys are
just after a girl's money.

612
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:57,102
You wouldn't believe it.

613
00:48:57,844 --> 00:49:01,109
Everything for love.
But not that way.

614
00:49:01,548 --> 00:49:04,312
But what about my old age?

615
00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:06,283
Who worries about my old age?

616
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,051
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

617
00:49:11,224 --> 00:49:12,714
Waiter, keep the change.

618
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,492
Let's go.

619
00:49:15,562 --> 00:49:19,123
I didn't want to go on
like that forever.

620
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:22,200
I'd have quit if I could,
even tomorrow.

621
00:49:22,402 --> 00:49:24,336
I'd have gone away.

622
00:49:24,538 --> 00:49:28,304
To live that way forever?
I already owned the house.

623
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:30,237
Know what me
and Wanda planned?

624
00:49:30,477 --> 00:49:34,004
We were gonna rent a newsstand.

625
00:49:34,247 --> 00:49:37,512
Understand?
Where are we going?

626
00:49:37,818 --> 00:49:39,308
It's so nice here.

627
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,919
Let's take a little walk. Okay?

628
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,220
I don't even remember
how I started.

629
00:49:45,425 --> 00:49:49,054
I was a child,
that's all I remember.

630
00:49:49,329 --> 00:49:50,853
And the suitcases?

631
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:52,398
We'll take them later.

632
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:56,663
You shoulda seen me at 15...

633
00:49:56,903 --> 00:49:59,133
with my long black hair...

634
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:00,264
down to here.

635
00:50:00,474 --> 00:50:03,568
Who understood anything?
My mother just wanted the money.

636
00:50:03,777 --> 00:50:05,267
Where are we going?

637
00:50:05,479 --> 00:50:07,777
I don't know.
We're just strolling.

638
00:50:08,682 --> 00:50:10,650
What's the name of that song?

639
00:50:24,598 --> 00:50:25,758
Won't you kiss me?

640
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,179
Come.

641
00:50:52,626 --> 00:50:54,526
I know a shortcut.

642
00:51:23,557 --> 00:51:25,252
Oscar! Where are you?

643
00:51:26,193 --> 00:51:29,321
What a bad boy you are!

644
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:34,363
Look at these flowers.
Like 'em?

645
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:36,726
They stink, but still.

646
00:51:37,404 --> 00:51:39,599
I never saw flowers
like these before.

647
00:51:39,906 --> 00:51:41,100
Let's go.

648
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:42,672
I'm coming.

649
00:51:45,946 --> 00:51:48,744
Smell them.
What kind of flowers are they?

650
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:51,679
What's wrong? Are you sad?

651
00:51:51,952 --> 00:51:53,385
Me? No. Why?

652
00:51:53,587 --> 00:51:55,953
You stopped singing.
Wait a minute.

653
00:52:00,527 --> 00:52:03,462
Why don't we carve
our initials on the trees?

654
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:07,124
Let's go. The sunset
is beautiful in the woods.

655
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:11,269
The sunset, eh?
Where do you wanna go?

656
00:52:27,053 --> 00:52:28,987
What a strange light.

657
00:52:44,437 --> 00:52:45,461
Beautiful, isn't it?

658
00:52:49,176 --> 00:52:52,339
I guess there is some justice
in the world.

659
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,677
You suffer,
you go through hell...

660
00:52:59,186 --> 00:53:03,088
but then happiness
comes along for everyone.

661
00:53:05,625 --> 00:53:07,684
You've been my angel.

662
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:11,028
Your hand is freezing.
Are you cold?

663
00:53:14,201 --> 00:53:15,828
Having regrets?

664
00:53:19,139 --> 00:53:20,265
Beautiful, eh?

665
00:53:21,708 --> 00:53:23,699
Look how deep it is!

666
00:53:23,977 --> 00:53:26,969
I'd love a boat ride
right now.

667
00:53:27,681 --> 00:53:30,206
Are there any boats
down there now?

668
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:32,782
- Can you swim?
- Not me!

669
00:53:33,286 --> 00:53:36,153
I almost drowned once.
But they saved me.

670
00:53:36,356 --> 00:53:38,551
Just imagine!
I was pushed in!

671
00:53:42,295 --> 00:53:43,284
What's wrong?

672
00:53:58,678 --> 00:54:00,009
What's the matter?

673
00:54:03,216 --> 00:54:05,878
You don't want to kill me,
do you?

674
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:09,216
Answer me!

675
00:54:10,423 --> 00:54:12,414
You want to kill me?

676
00:54:14,194 --> 00:54:15,923
You want to kill me!

677
00:54:16,997 --> 00:54:20,160
Don't just stand there.
Say something!

678
00:54:21,101 --> 00:54:25,595
Speak! Don't be like that!
Speak!

679
00:54:27,407 --> 00:54:28,396
Tell me.

680
00:54:33,613 --> 00:54:35,410
For... the money?

681
00:54:39,252 --> 00:54:40,617
For the money.

682
00:55:07,547 --> 00:55:11,574
Kill me! Kill me!
Throw me off the cliff!

683
00:55:11,785 --> 00:55:14,117
I don't wanna live anymore!

684
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,884
I don't wanna live anymore!

685
00:55:22,062 --> 00:55:25,793
Kill me! Throw me off the cliff!

686
00:55:26,399 --> 00:55:30,062
I don't wanna live anymore!

687
00:55:31,404 --> 00:55:32,962
Go ahead!

688
00:55:33,173 --> 00:55:35,573
Shut up, stupid!

689
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:40,405
I don't want to hurt you.
Can't you see that?

690
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:43,572
I don't wanna live anymore!

691
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:50,648
Kill me! Kill me!

692
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,537
Maurizio, hurry up!
We're leaving!

693
00:57:28,888 --> 00:57:31,914
We're gonna lose our way
going home!
