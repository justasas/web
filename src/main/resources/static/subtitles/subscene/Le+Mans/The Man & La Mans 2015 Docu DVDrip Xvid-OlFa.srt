[interposing voices]

2
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,141
WOMAN: Camera B rolling.

3
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,515
DIRECTOR: And action.

4
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,894
[race cars driving]

00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,004
[sirens]

00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,814
[chopper noises]

7
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,594
MAN: OK.

8
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:46,536
Uh, why don't we just dive in
and have a look at uh-- Steve,

9
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,804
what do you think of the
circumstances that might have

10
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,071
led up to the disease itself?

11
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:55,511
How do you perceive that?

12
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:57,516
STEVE MCQUEEN: Two ways.

13
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:03,523
One is asbestos poisoning in
my lungs, which is very rare.

14
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,558
Two is, I think,
there were times

15
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,650
when I was under pressure.

16
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,252
I had a battle in my
business with somebody

17
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,390
for about five years, so
I think I really wanted

18
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,597
to let go under pressure.

19
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,947
NARRATOR: It all began
when a super star

20
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,816
who loved auto racing decided
to do a picture about his sport.

21
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,958
WOMAN: That was most
seminal moment in his life.

22
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,827
MAN: What was happening when we
were shooting this movie should

23
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:53,202
happen to no man.

24
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,709
MAN: I just wanted to
get it down on film, what

25
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:57,640
I thought it was all about.

26
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,665
Ladies and gentlemen,
the male world

27
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,534
film favorite, Steve McQueen.

28
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,904
[applause]

29
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,275
STEVE MCQUEEN: Thank you.

30
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,520
MAN: If you had your
life to do over again,

31
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,785
would you do it the same way?

32
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,224
STEVE MCQUEEN: Damn right.

33
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,625
[Laughing]

34
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,655
Every bit of it,
because I think film

35
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,893
is a very important medium.

36
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,173
When he was the number one
superstar in the world,

37
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,405
he was, like, I
think, 38 years old.

38
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,208
People went nuts
wherever he went.

39
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,250
He was American Royalty.

40
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,012
Groovy.

41
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,212
Thanks.

42
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,652
[applause]

43
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,249
I started on a farm, in
the state of Missouri,

44
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,059
and I lived there in
my youth, and I got

45
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,153
out of there as quick as I can.

46
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,601
NARRATOR: His
background gave him

47
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:35,504
a courageous element that stood
him in very, very good stead

48
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,202
at that time.

49
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,303
STEVE MCQUEEN: I don't know
very much about art or music,

50
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,746
except things that I like.

51
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,480
Basically, I come
from the gutter,

52
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,646
and I'm not a compromiser.

53
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,159
MAN: He didn't give
a shit, you know?

54
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,199
If there was a fight to be had,
he would not turn his back,

55
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,962
and it doesn't
matter who it was.

56
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,367
INTERVIEWER: I bet
you're a perfectionist.

57
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,804
Well, I try to do a good job.

58
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,101
You know, I try.

59
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,153
"The Thomas Crown Affair"
and "Bullet" were my two

60
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,590
pictures with Steve McQueen.

61
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:38,066
I convinced him that every
time he went on the set,

62
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,105
no matter what
the director said,

63
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,768
he should recite the mantra.

64
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,539
I decide what is right
and what is wrong,

65
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,173
and I don't have to
explain it to anybody.

66
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,719
I like women, but I'm a
little afraid of them.

67
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,549
I'm not going to
make a commitment,

68
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,648
because if you make a commitment
to a woman, they can hurt you.

69
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,694
I won't pick a fight, but
if you pick a fight with me

70
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:07,358
or back me into a corner,
I will fucking kill you.

71
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,765
He used to recite
that to himself

72
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,963
when he went on
the set, regardless

73
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,472
of what the directions were.

74
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,134
And he played that character,
I thought, just brilliantly.

75
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,043
INTERVIEWER: Which do you enjoy
more, acting or producing?

76
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,680
STEVE MCQUEEN: Well,
I'm sort of hung.

77
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,782
I like producing, as
long as I'm acting,

78
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,227
because I think the ultimate
is to have creative control.

79
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,130
He loved the part in the
"Thomas Crown Affair,"

80
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,395
playing Tommy Crown.

81
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:48,270
Big business guy, no one
knows anything more than him.

82
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,777
He aspired to that character.

83
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:56,008
He wanted to feel like
he was a bit of a mogul.

84
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,745
STEVE MCQUEEN: Now,
the movies are changed.

85
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:00,784
It's not a game anymore.

86
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,686
It's big bucks, heavy bucks.

87
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,280
And those people play
for keeps out there.

88
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:13,365
He got this into his head, that
he would build us an empire.

89
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,732
After "Thomas Crown," he
said, I'm going to build us

90
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,269
an empire, baby doll.

91
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,276
STEVE MCQUEEN: If I
have my name on there,

92
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,372
they can no longer
pawn me off as just

93
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,819
a candy ass movie star who
they've got to be easy with.

94
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,413
This puts me out
front as an executive.

95
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:42,153
So therefore, they
have to deal with me.

96
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,490
The juice.

97
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,258
He got the juice man,
he got the power.

98
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,431
It was a very smart,
intelligent, sophisticated move

99
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,700
for him to form a
production company

100
00:07:55,775 --> 00:08:00,212
called Solar, and exercised
his clout in the way he did.

101
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,543
And the first
person that he told,

102
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,776
his agents that he wanted to
reach out to be his partner

103
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:05,714
was my father.

104
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:12,881
I'm standing here with Bob
Relyea, the executive producer

105
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,223
of Solar Productions.

106
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,819
We had been through
"The Magnificent Seven."

107
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,262
We'd been through
"The Great Escape."

108
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,769
The company was a
very well organized,

109
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,804
real production company.

110
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,499
The relationship that Steve
and I had in our families

111
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,407
was extremely close.

112
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:32,774
INTERVIEWER: You
actually throw a temper?

113
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,039
Can you?

114
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:36,341
Injustice bothers
me a lot sometimes,

115
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,474
and I get angry about
things, and so forth.

116
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,781
And I suppose I fly off
the handle sometimes.

117
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,823
MAN: Steve trusted Bob.

118
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:48,758
If there was a problem, he'd
just grab him by the shoulder,

119
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:52,457
and he'd take him
off to the side.

120
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:59,700
As much as you want this, Steve,
this passion doesn't mean shit.

121
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:00,635
And Steve got it.

122
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,946
It was a real coup to get him
to come to Cinema Center Films,

123
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,990
and to be involved
with his company.

124
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,548
That, in itself, was a
major accomplishment.

125
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,498
It wasn't just "I'm the
biggest star in the world."

126
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,869
It was I'm going to
decide what films I make.

127
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,999
I'm going to decide
who the directors are,

128
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,771
and I'm going to make
that racing picture

129
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,505
that I always wanted
to make, and it's

130
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,342
going to define my career.

131
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,592
I race motorcars,
because I enjoy it.

132
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,691
I like the competitive element.

133
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,202
I like beating the other guy.

134
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,465
I do enjoy the feeling of power.

135
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,344
WOMAN: It was his thing.

136
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,442
It was his passion.

137
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:26,924
And if you find your passion in
life, you know you got it made.

138
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,392
I remember the first time I
raced, I was very frightened.

139
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,759
It scared me.

140
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:31,795
I didn't like the idea
of being frightened,

141
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:32,660
and I wanted to overcome it.

142
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,530
That was one element.

143
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,535
The other element, and
it is a very pure thing.

144
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,366
It's one of the few things
in life you can't fix.

145
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,201
When you're out
there by yourself,

146
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,573
you're very much by yourself.

147
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:52,916
MAN: The risk taking, the
need for adrenaline, the what

148
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:58,184
do I have to lose attitude
that he seemed to project,

149
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:04,422
it just matched McQueen's
soul, his personality,

150
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,657
and his essence.

151
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,559
Racing drivers are
a different breed.

152
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,605
When you're in the
car behind the wheel,

153
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,507
you tune everything off.

154
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,068
There's one thing that
you are focused on,

155
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:28,110
and that is to perform, to win.

156
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,313
And he had that.

157
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,298
NARRATOR: For 20
years, an almost

158
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:52,208
forgotten airport has echoed
to the fury of cars and speed.

159
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:57,681
MAN: Sebring was as close as you
get to the brother of Le Mans.

160
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,410
If you're ever
going to get a taste

161
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,579
of what it's like to be in an
endurance race, this is it.

162
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,250
WOMAN: Just a week before,
he had broken his foot

163
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,259
in the motorcycle race.

164
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,158
And I said, you
better not do this.

165
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,321
He said, no.

166
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,388
He said, I can do
it, I can do it.

167
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,126
INTERVIEWER: What about
shifting and clutching?

168
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,691
Must be pretty difficult.

169
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:23,139
Well, it's a little difficult.
I can't use afoot rest.

170
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,803
And we've put some
sandpaper on the bottom,

171
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,369
taped it on, so I keep it on
the clutch pedal, adjust it.

172
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,550
We went for it.

173
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,461
It was like a Hollywood script.

174
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,370
COMMENTATOR: A surprise to most
of the 57,000 who looked on

175
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,239
was the McQueen
Revson Porsche 908.

176
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,005
The two have done
a Masterful job.

177
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,078
WOMAN: What was incredible
about that race is suddenly,

178
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:11,622
they were winning.

179
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,952
COMMENTATOR: With
this combination,

180
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,993
Sebring could have
a storybook finish.

181
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,659
Approaching the 11th hour,
the Porsche closes the gap

182
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,535
on the faltering Ferrari.

183
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,939
The McQueen pits were
overjoyed, thinking

184
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,169
the Ferrari was in trouble.

185
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:40,312
And out of the darkness, one
car would emerge the victor.

186
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,081
MAN: It took Mario
Andretti two cars

187
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:47,615
to beat us and only pass us
on the last laps of the race.

188
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,025
COMMENTATOR: The 12 hours
of Sebring was over,

189
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,263
and Ferrari had won.

190
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,362
McQueen Revson was second.

191
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,736
[cheering]

192
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:06,300
We were mobbed at
the end of the race.

193
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:13,215
Steve gets up on the car
and gives the peace signal.

194
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,721
And it was like Moses
parted the waters

195
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:21,783
or God appeared in the sky.

196
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,486
Silence.

197
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,693
That was my biggest
thrill, for me,

198
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,602
because I guess being an
actor, people don't really

199
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,937
expect you to do
it as well, and I

200
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,378
was a big man of my house with
my kids for awhile, anyway.

201
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,314
That was a major, major
happy time in his life.

202
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,818
I remember when he came home.

203
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,377
Yeah.

204
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,251
He was in a good mood for
about a month after that.

205
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,467
MAN: After the Sebing
Race, he wasn't

206
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,374
looked at just like,
oh, he's the actor,

207
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,503
superstar, Steve McQueen.

208
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,707
He was admired by
the other drivers

209
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:18,146
as a real, professional racer.

210
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:39,393
MAN: The interweaving of film
and racing was now perfect.

211
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,130
It was a natural.

212
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:49,742
His next step was the 24 Hours
of Le Mans and to race there.

213
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,657
MAN: This was going
to be a lasting memory

214
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,696
of Steve McQueen, this film.

215
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,928
Steve wanted to really do the
movie of all time, the movie

216
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,903
for all generations, the movie
that captures the smells,

217
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:19,001
the noise, the feeling of
car racing like no other film

218
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,237
ever had.

219
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,108
It was a really big deal.

220
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,242
-Hi, guys.
-Bonjour.

221
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,116
How you doing?

222
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:29,915
[french speech]

223
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,115
Merci.

224
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,087
Wow.

225
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,092
It's been what, 40 years?

226
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,525
[sighs]

227
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,493
Ha!

228
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,360
MAN: Before Solar
was even started,

229
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,366
McQueen decided he
was going to make

230
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,096
the ultimate racing picture.

231
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,628
MAN: There was a project called
"The Day of the Champion"

232
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,539
that never got made.

233
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,474
MAN: It was shut down.

234
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,980
MAN: John Frankenheimer got
there first, with "Grand Prix."

235
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,881
Oh my god, get out.

236
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,750
Get out of here, you.

237
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,119
Give this guy hell, this driver.

238
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,851
Get the Ferrari out of here.

239
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,417
Change the lens on
that, and let's go.

240
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,192
I've got to remember
which is which.

241
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,994
MAN: James Garner was
involved in "Grand Prix."

242
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,693
I've been driving it backwards.

243
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,103
MAN: And that left a very
bitter taste in Steve's mouth.

244
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,834
Jim, where exactly do
you use your brakes?

245
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:23,635
All right.

246
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,836
All right, good.

247
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:28,913
MAN: Another actor, and here he
was, taking the subject matter,

248
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,007
and running with it.

249
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,449
MAN: Steve's apartment was
above James Garner's apartment

250
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,283
in the same neighborhood.

251
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,153
And Steve would urinate
out the window at night

252
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,591
on the flower boxes
of James Garner below.

253
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:46,460
And as he performed this act,
he went, you pissed on my film.

254
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,124
And now, I piss on you.

255
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,030
What is that?
Paint?

256
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:49,828
No, no.

257
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,767
Close your eyes.

258
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,235
[Laughing]

259
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,828
It's all right.
Cut it out.

260
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,067
It's not funny.

261
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:57,472
I can see him sitting
in the theater,

262
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,977
watching that and
saying, oh, shit.

263
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,310
It's just another movie.

264
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:07,318
His sense of racing
was so personal.

265
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:10,219
If there was going to be
one definitive movie about

266
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,290
that sport, he wanted to do it.

267
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:24,229
This is a treatment for "Le
Mans" and general comments

268
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:28,670
dated October 2nd, 1969.

269
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,537
Ha.

270
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,101
"Grand Prix," a prime
example of a director

271
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,044
playing with himself in public.

272
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:36,945
[Laughs]

273
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,950
We have to reach high in
a picture like "La Mans,"

274
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,079
or there is no
purpose in making it.

275
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:52,553
Well, how perfect is this?

276
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,799
OK.

277
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,029
Battle stations.

278
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,401
[Laughing]

279
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:11,940
MAN: We all remember the scene
in "Apocalypse Now," where

280
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,384
up the river, Kurtz has
built a piece of America

281
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,423
in the middle of hostile jungle.

282
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,454
That is what Steve
McQueen decided

283
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:29,432
to lower in to rural Le Mans,
and that was SoLA Village.

284
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:36,069
[french speech]

285
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,212
MAN: We want to photograph
the entire race,

286
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,981
and then we want to recreate it.

287
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,953
And we want to use
the same drivers.

288
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,180
Suddenly, out of the
blue, we're asked to work

289
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,250
on a movie with Steve McQueen.

290
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,307
It was like, whoa.
Wow.

291
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,409
Why not?

292
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,181
And then on top
of that, you knew

293
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,153
you were going to earn $200 a
day, which was a lot of money.

294
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,253
Excellent.

295
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,763
Absolutely excellent.

296
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:36,699
We were given a Porsche 911
each to trundle around in,

297
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,134
and it was good news.

298
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,604
Well, it's quite a pleasant
surprise to be invited.

299
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:52,377
I knew Steve quite well, and
it was very nice of Steve,

300
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,317
letting me go racing
at the weekends,

301
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,083
and letting his pilot and
airplane to come back in time

302
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,384
for filming on Monday morning.

303
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,486
David Piper.

304
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,031
We used to call him the pirate.

305
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,397
[Laughing]

306
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,005
I think of the pipe
hanging out of his mouth.

307
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:15,699
He was a grand, old guy.

308
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,436
[race car noises]

309
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:27,215
Mr. Sturges, you've directed
Steve McQueen in several films,

310
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,617
including "The Great Escape."

311
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,212
And now, you're
here in "Le Mans."

312
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,486
STEVE MCQUEEN: John Sturges
is directing this film.

313
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,958
We've done three
films together now,

314
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,996
and I tell you, we've
had nothing but fun,

315
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,395
simply because
we've had the time,

316
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,160
and we get excited about
doing really good work.

317
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,898
MAN: John was an
incredible director.

318
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:52,273
It was Steve working with
John on "Great Escape"

319
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:56,336
and "Magnificent Seven" which
made the myth, and the man,

320
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,906
and Steve McQueen who he was.

321
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,976
The hero of the film
is racing in this scene.

322
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,453
That's what it's about.

323
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,753
[race car engine]

324
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,165
MAN: We have the star.

325
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,666
We had the drivers.

326
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,603
We had an incredible array
of technical support.

327
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,108
We had everything,
except the script.

328
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,667
He said that the script
isn't entirely finished.

329
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,769
We're waiting for the end of
the race to finish the script,

330
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,371
to finalize the script?

331
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:34,248
Well, we do want to adjust
our story to the way things

332
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,014
happen that we
actually photograph.

333
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:36,917
That's correct.

334
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:45,328
MAN: It's common in Hollywood
to start without a script.

335
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,454
It's not the right way.

336
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,896
It's not the economic way.

337
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,264
But it's common, and
anybody who says it's not

338
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,428
hasn't been there.

339
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,433
MAN: They had done it
once before, Sturges,

340
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,703
McQueen, and my father.

341
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,641
They had done it on
"The Great Escape,"

342
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,543
and it turned out well.

343
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,411
And after "Bullitt," my father
said the studio would have

344
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,509
written him a blank check just
to produce the phone book,

345
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,814
if he wanted to.

346
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,982
We have the best people
in the business with us.

347
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,356
Bob Relyea, he's our
executive producer.

348
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,825
John Sturges, he's our director.

349
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,557
He probably is the biggest
director in America,

350
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,461
and he's probably one of
the best in the world.

351
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,660
So with all those
things going for us,

352
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,566
plus Steve McQueen
and Le Mans, I

353
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,002
think we've got a
picture that's going

354
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,509
to make an awful lot of money
and make a lot of people happy.

355
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,739
This is the story
of racing, man.

356
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:36,973
This is the guts.

357
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,345
Glass is all right.

358
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,213
All right.

359
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,750
OK.

360
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:45,119
You got motor racing,
and you got Steve McQueen.

361
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,817
What have you got?

362
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,725
You've got everything.

363
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,194
[french speech]

364
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,256
"Le Mans" was going
to be our number

365
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,961
one picture for the year.

366
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:01,199
It was a sure thing
for Hollywood.

367
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,968
This could not miss.

368
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,258
MAN: It's the oldest, most
famous race in the world.

369
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:31,067
As you arrive to Le Mans and
come up beside the cathedral,

370
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,263
suddenly, the adrenaline will
start to get in your stomach.

371
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,475
That was when I realized
I was at Le Mans.

372
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,013
I knew we were driving
into the unknown.

373
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,914
You're going to be driving
at speeds that a racing

374
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,509
car's never been before.

375
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,611
It was terrifying.

376
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:51,882
Go.

377
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,154
[cheering]

378
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:05,900
It was a very fast
flowing circuit.

379
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:11,341
Very dangerous, but all
circuits were dangerous.

380
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:15,140
When I started racing, no
one was worried about safety.

381
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,238
I mean, almost every
race I went to,

382
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:22,082
someone was killed--
sometimes, two or three people.

383
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:22,778
Life was cheap.

384
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,620
[crashing]

385
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,488
Those cars weren't very safe.

386
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,292
They were like sharp knives,
if you had an accident.

387
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,527
They cut you to pieces.

388
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,628
A car catches on fire,
and that's the end of it.

389
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:41,569
ANNOUNCER: We have trouble!

390
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:42,537
We have trouble.

391
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,505
Out at Nissan Dodge.

392
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,939
See the smoke billowing.

393
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,841
There is a problem.

394
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:49,413
STEVE MCQUEEN: You don't have
time to make two decisions.

395
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,450
You have time only to make
one, and it must be right.

396
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:56,647
You are sitting in a motor car
that maybe has 600 horsepower

397
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,552
and 30 gallons of gasoline.

398
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,785
So you know that if you
crash in this vehicle,

399
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,851
an impact is going
to be disastrous.

400
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,941
There's nothing very
glamorous about racing,

401
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,270
except when you're winning.

402
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,077
You get to the end of the race.

403
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,483
You're leading the race.

404
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:34,890
You're almost in tears on
the last couple of laps, just

405
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:39,327
hoping you can get
across the line.

406
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:43,697
ANNOUNCER: Here they come,
toward the checkered flag.

407
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:49,968
Ford wins the 1969
24 hours of Le Mans.

408
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:53,602
And you don't get a situation
like that in life very often,

409
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,044
you know.

410
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,912
[crowd cheering]

411
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,945
FRENCH MAN: You like
speed, don't you?

412
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,250
Hmm?

413
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:08,155
FRENCH MAN: You like
speed, don't you?

414
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,591
Oh, it's nice.

415
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:10,490
It's cold.

416
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,364
MAN: The original idea
was for Steve to drive

417
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:19,267
Le Mans the actual 24 hours.

418
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:23,330
ANNOUNCER: The real question
here is this is Steve McQueen,

419
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:26,434
and we are wondering
whether or not Steve

420
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,034
McQueen will run in the race.

421
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:36,554
If I weren't so rotten
inside for money,

422
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,111
I would probably tell
them to go screw.

423
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,521
[french speech]

424
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,226
But I need the money
to make the film.

425
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,764
[french speech]

426
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,794
And I will not race at Le Mans.

427
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,166
[french speech]

428
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,031
It was too big a risk.

429
00:27:56,107 --> 00:28:00,874
And if something were to happen
to him in the actual race,

430
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,142
that would put the film on hold
and probably never get done.

431
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,086
That's how much it meant to him.

432
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,816
He gave up his shot
at competing at Le

433
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,359
Mans for the sake of the film.

434
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,725
Well, the insurance company
won't let Steve drive

435
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,162
in the race, as he told you.

436
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:24,793
We're going to be covering the
race itself very extensively,

437
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,133
with cameras everywhere.

438
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,969
And we expect to work
approximately three months

439
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,838
afterwards, staging the picture.

440
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,213
ANNOUNCER: Solar
Productions ready the camera

441
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,086
car for the race.

442
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,792
My real contribution
was driving the camera

443
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:34,565
car during the actual race.

444
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:38,665
It was the car that Steve
and Peter Revson had finished

445
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:42,042
second at Sebring, and
then they converted

446
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,207
it to carry three cameras,
one in front, two at the back.

447
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,151
MAN: When the camera car
was being fixed up Le Mans,

448
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,782
Steve was all around that.

449
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,418
And you could see written
all over his face,

450
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,895
I want to be sitting
where you are sitting

451
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,932
and to take this race on.

452
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,075
MAN: Most important
was the start.

453
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,274
They wanted to get the
start from in the car.

454
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,491
MAN: Going through the pit area,
with the full grand stand of

455
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:41,629
don't know how many
thousand people in it-- this

456
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,537
was genuine stuff.

457
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:48,443
We were told to film
especially the leaders.

458
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,175
So you'd photograph them
coming up behind you,

459
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:52,909
and then switch
with the front one

460
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,782
on to catch them overtaking
you, and pulling away.

461
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,286
MAN: Unless they'd had all
the footage that they got,

462
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,389
they could've never
made the film.

463
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,488
They were brilliant.

464
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,001
MAN: The camera car
was bringing need

465
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,411
to the screen what
a driver would

466
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:34,414
see-- cars passing at speed, car
dicing, all part of the vision.

467
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,464
Here it is, after
all this time.

468
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,507
NEILE ADAMS: (SINGING)
And it started again,

469
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,783
and I meant every word,
and I liked what I said,

470
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,915
and I liked what I heard.

471
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,324
And I started to think.

472
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:15,662
I could think about
starting again.

473
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:20,170
We were laughing again
over memories, and wine,

474
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:23,571
and the years in-between
didn't seem a long time.

475
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:28,009
When I smiled, he knew why.

476
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,537
In a while, it was
starting again.

477
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,208
We had so many similarities.

478
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,811
(SINGING) And I
started to think.

479
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:42,291
We were raised by mothers who
really were not particularly

480
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,985
ready to be mothers.

481
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,030
Our fathers left us.

482
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,463
We built our career together.

483
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,397
We had children
together, and we were

484
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,163
married for a very long time.

485
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:55,398
(SINGING) You're walking
along the street,

486
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,804
or you're at a party.

487
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:00,776
Or else you're alone and
then you suddenly dig--

488
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,312
My mom-- I don't know
how old she is now.

489
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,507
She won't tell me.

490
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,574
But she still does her act.

491
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,018
(SINGING) There's no
controlling the unrolling

492
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,316
of my faith, my friend.

493
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:16,086
Who knows what's written
in the magic book?

494
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,821
Well, my parents
met in the '50s.

495
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,692
She was a star on Broadway.

496
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,062
And she's good at what she
does, and she enjoys it.

497
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,430
She loves it.

498
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,025
I sure did like that.

499
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:26,763
She was about the sexiest
girl I ever saw in my life.

500
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,534
I guess it was ever a thing
of falling in love with a girl

501
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,336
at first sight, I guess that
was it, because boy, I sure had

502
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,808
to chase her for a long time.

503
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,180
[applause]

504
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,693
It was just our
destiny to be together.

505
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:01,466
I walked out of Carnegie
Hall, and he came right to me.

506
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,233
And he said, hi.

507
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,932
You're pretty.

508
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,168
And I was stunned.

509
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,868
And I said, well,
you're pretty too.

510
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,991
I remember there
was a long drive.

511
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,608
Yeah.

512
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:48,082
This was my home for
three months, man.

513
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,781
The people my dad or
Solar rented it from,

514
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,051
they lived on that floor, there.

515
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:57,127
And they had a nutty
daughter, if I remember.

516
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,494
We pulled in here, and she
was chasing a chicken around.

517
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,556
And she had a fucking
ax in her hand.

518
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,601
And she grabbed it
and cut its fucking

519
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,830
head off, right in front of us.

520
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,372
It was the first time I
ever saw a chicken running

521
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,238
around with no head right here.

522
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,334
I'd come from Brentwood.

523
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,040
[dog barking]

524
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,609
NEILE ADAMS: I didn't
want to go to Le Mans.

525
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,246
However, because Chad had
been doing badly in school,

526
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,983
I said, OK.

527
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,391
If you improve your
grades, we'll go.

528
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,225
And he did, so I had to go.

529
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,996
I used to wait right out here
to see dad's Porsche coming up.

530
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,234
ANNOUNCER: The fact
that you're here

531
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,004
with the likes of Hertz and--

532
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:50,706
Would you like some gum?

533
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,612
Thank you.

534
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:58,212
When the flower children came
along, everything changed.

535
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,655
Everything changed.

536
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,784
He was almost 40.

537
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,762
There was suddenly free
sex, and free love, and free

538
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,458
this, and free everything.

539
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,090
He said to me one day.

540
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,966
He said, I have to work so
hard for love in this house.

541
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,197
(LAUGHING) He said, I can
get it for free out there.

542
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,843
MAN: His conquest of
women behind his wife's

543
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:25,609
back probably averaged
about a dozen women a week.

544
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,550
It was a little
less than two a day.

545
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,678
They wanted to say, I had
sex with Steve McQueen.

546
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:45,735
He loved cars, liquor,
women, and he was interesting,

547
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,168
and cool, and dangerous.

548
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,761
See, they liked
the danger in him.

549
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,473
Whatever Steve's
activities might

550
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:57,537
have been when he had a break
in the afternoon, so to speak.

551
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,542
His trailer was never empty.

552
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:21,604
I had came from the Royal
Dramatic School in Stockholm,

553
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,503
and I was there for the job.

554
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,936
Only if you'd like it better.

555
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,814
He had something hidden.

556
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:39,550
Maybe that also made him
attractive on the screen.

557
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:46,460
And as a woman, that's something
that I want to get to know.

558
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,828
I don't know who cast her.

559
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:52,699
Think Steve had an eye for her.

560
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,702
She appealed to him.

561
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,897
She was an attractive lady.

562
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:04,014
My respect for him was
not as big as his for me.

563
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:07,414
We shared this thing
about the accident.

564
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:22,755
I had worked for
Steve about two years,

565
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,995
almost, before we did "Le Mans."

566
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,937
I was involved more
with the car racing

567
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,838
and other personal matters.

568
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,310
I had dinner
together with Steve,

569
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:42,284
and the count and the countess
from whom he rented this castle

570
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:45,014
in which he was living.

571
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:45,748
He would drive me home.

572
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,894
It was like 12:00, 
1 o'clock in the morning.

573
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,294
And Steve comes into my
room and says, come on.

574
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,763
We've got to go.

575
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,095
Where are we going?
Why don't we go tomorrow?

576
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:57,862
I'm tired.

577
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,094
I haven't slept.

578
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,764
He told me to screw
myself and said,

579
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,669
what are you worried about?

580
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,104
You're only 21.

581
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,267
You'll sleep when you die.

582
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,105
I never knew her name.

583
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,046
I never got introduced.

584
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,980
And it wasn't just any night.

585
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,246
It was my first night
arriving in France.

586
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:23,149
I sat down next to
him in the front seat.

587
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,625
Steve was not driving a Porsche.

588
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,526
He was driving a Peugeot,
or something like that.

589
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,671
MAN: He was driving like a
maniac, and it started to rain.

590
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,814
And I keep telling
him to slow down,

591
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,340
and he keeps telling
me to shut up.

592
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,818
Suddenly, there was a curve.

593
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,378
[brakes screeching]

594
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,780
[cutting noise]

595
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:58,386
He drove at the side, and
we rolled over the field.

596
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,760
[clunking noises]

597
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:05,268
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-- I remember
them smashing their heads

598
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:08,464
into the windshield.

599
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,507
I went flying.

600
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:14,169
I remember looking at my arm,
holding on, as we're crashing

601
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,212
down, and it just broke.

602
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,677
I could see it snap.

603
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:20,847
I was just out.

604
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,722
[whistling]

605
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:31,988
Tss-- And I
remember reaching up,

606
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:36,863
and opening the door, and
pushing the door open, and cut.

607
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,031
Steve thought that I was dead,
because I was lying there.

608
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:50,437
The water, the light
rain, woke him up.

609
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,881
And he said, what
the fuck happened?

610
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,077
Holy shit.

611
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,949
What have I done?

612
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,318
Oh my god, she's dead!

613
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,481
Is she dead?

614
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,525
And of course, my
arm's like this.

615
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,527
It's just hanging.

616
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,290
And she comes to.

617
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,230
She seemed OK, not too bad.

618
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,426
He didn't have a scratch.

619
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:21,003
They didn't call an ambulance,
because they didn't want this

620
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:24,275
to get official, of course.

621
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,214
We saw a little farmhouse.

622
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,275
Steve says, there's a car there.

623
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,913
Let's go hot wire it.

624
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:37,984
And all of a sudden, we
hear the dogs barking.

625
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:41,428
And this French guys
comes out in pajamas,

626
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,798
and he's got a shot gun, and
old, big gun in his hand.

627
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,928
And he's screaming in French
something-- [french speech]

628
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,869
Pow!

629
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,804
[gun shot]

630
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,520
My makeup, early in the
morning, she didn't know.

631
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:13,996
She asked me why I had bruises,
but they were not too big.

632
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:17,898
And I said, ah, well, you know.

633
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:22,803
The production team, so to
say, must have known about it.

634
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,898
Well, I know that
there was an accident,

635
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,374
but I don't want to go there.

636
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,739
I don't want to go there.

637
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,145
I took the wrap for it.

638
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,350
They said that I was the
one who caused the problem,

639
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:46,589
but the fact that Steve was with
the girl was never revealed.

640
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:50,327
You just have to protect
Steve, and it's no big deal.

641
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,096
Nobody got killed.

642
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:52,998
Don't worry about it.

643
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,593
It's part of our jobs.

644
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:01,575
What would have happened if
it'd been on the headlines

645
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,012
just before we started shooting
the movie saying, Steve

646
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,540
McQueen, the great
driver, he had an accident

647
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,779
with a young actress.

648
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:12,185
[clacking tongue]

649
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:12,915
Could you imagine?

650
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,620
He was so afraid.

651
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:23,189
I could see how scared
he was that I would

652
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,030
ruin him and his production.

653
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,737
He said to me, I'd appreciate
it if you don't talk about this.

654
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:33,537
So I said--

655
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,305
[pops lips]

656
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:37,114
no, I won't.

657
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:37,876
no, I won't.

658
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,247
[train station noises]

659
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,262
NARRATOR: The cars pass
through the sleepy French towns

660
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,198
and countryside.

661
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:02,762
Strange, slow parade
of muttering monsters.

662
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:03,498
PRODUCER: Rolling.

663
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:10,012
MAN: McQueen were trying to
achieve something that hadn't

664
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,105
been done in mainstream
films about a sport

665
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,081
that he had a true passion for.

666
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,812
Cars underway.

667
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,853
MAN: He really wanted
to break through

668
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,445
and do a film that
was as authentic

669
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:22,252
as you could possibly get.

670
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,762
MAN: He wanted to put the
person in the theater, put

671
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,353
them in the seat of a race car.

672
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:31,958
He wanted them to feel what
he felt as a driver himself.

673
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,731
That was always his intent.

674
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,297
Wes, I think this is the first
time this sort of a production

675
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,001
has been undertaken.

676
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,669
Yes, it is.

677
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,270
This is the first time anything
like this has been filmed.

678
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,215
[cars racing]

679
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,479
The things with this
car and the mounts on it,

680
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:51,781
and the cameras on
it that have never

681
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,516
been used before--
they're entirely new

682
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:58,152
mounts, entirely new concept of
the way to shoot a racing film.

683
00:44:58,262 --> 00:44:59,695
So far, everything is
going so beautifully,

684
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:00,422
it's almost unbelievable.

685
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,495
STEVE MCQUEEN: They were
able to achieve camera mounts

686
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:11,734
on automobiles that never before
had ever thought of being used.

687
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:18,180
To be able to get the feeling
of speed on film, helping us

688
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:22,275
crash which we call
the film barrier.

689
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:25,480
When Steve talked about
breaking the film barrier,

690
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,720
he was using language
that Hollywood didn't use.

691
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:33,354
Nobody ever thought
of doing it that way.

692
00:45:33,464 --> 00:45:36,831
What he was trying
to do was give

693
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,425
the total visual experience.

694
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:47,308
I'll tell you, Steve was ahead
of his time with his vision.

695
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:54,613
STEVE MCQUEEN: As far as
reality film's concerned,

696
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,846

their lives every single day

MAN: These scenes that they
shot were choreographed.

706
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:30,649
You had to do a ballet
out on the track

707
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,315
and do what the director
had asked you to do.

708
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,826
MAN: The making of
film was, in many ways,

709
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:45,733
a lot more dangerous
than the race.

710
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:51,400
And Steve did also not have
much of a sense of danger.

711
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,102
So everything was
pushed to the extreme.

712
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,411
Now, we're going
220 miles an hour.

Suddenly, the car
sort of just exploded.

took to unfasten the seat belt

It's when I got burned.

Oh, I just got very
burnt around here.

STEVE MCQUEEN: It could
have been a lot worse.

Let's put it that way.

In the film, I played

I drove for Ferrari.

747
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:14,277

And of course,
Steve is here too.

00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:44,073
Steve always did it different.

We were talking about reading.

754
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:48,448
And I said, I don't
like reading too much.

755
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:54,013
I read my scripts, and aw, I
don't like it either, he said.

756
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:57,219
I only read one book
in my life, he said,

757
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:01,128
a book about
Alexander the Great.

758
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,166
And I was very impressed
by one sentence, he said.

I can't get the world, but
I didn't conquer myself.

you ask yourself.

Who are you, really?

765
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,791

a feeling he was

00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,000
STEVE MCQUEEN: My
theory had always

769
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:44,767
been the racing world
is no less creative

770
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,968
in expression than film itself.

771
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,646
It's only an oddity,
because it's a blood sport.

He would say, look.

779
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,001
It would be great to
get a shot like this.

780
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,740
It caused quite a bit of
conflict with John Sturges.

781
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,281
This will be a
serious film, and

782
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,943
since the romantic interests
will be kept down to a minimum,

783
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,511
this will concentrate on sports

But my obligation's
got to be to myself.

To me, he became the
character, which I

800
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:19,428
described to him in the mantra.

801
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,696
He made his own rules.

802
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,203
He knew his own right and wrong.

803

answer to anybody.

you start to believe that.

Roman Pilanski at the time,

Dear Eddie-- Eddie
Rubin was our attorney.

As you know, I have been
selected by the Manson group

to be marked for death.

858
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,763
In some ways, I find it
humorous, and in other ways,

859
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,663
frighteningly tragic.

860
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,430
But I must, I must
consider it may be true.

00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:19,465
The levels of craziness,
anxiety were heightened.

871
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,476
Everything is zz-- up.

872
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,485
NEILE ADAMS: He was never
the same at any one point.

873
00:56:38,361 --> 00:56:40,329
That marriage was
fraying at the seams.

874
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:48,068
MAN: When they appeared on
set, they appeared on and on.

875
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:49,138
They appeared devoted.

876
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:56,471
But you can also see in Neile's
expression, a certain weariness

877
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:57,478
to the whole situation.

878
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:06,812
He said, by the way,
I'm having friends

879
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,517
visit me from all over Europe.

880
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,353
I said, really?

881
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,586
Who are they?

882
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:14,390
He said, well,
they're mostly women.

883
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,124
And you know, that
really got to me,

884
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,723
and I remember sobbing away.

885
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,136
MAN: She was wonderful.

886
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,469
She was a smart woman.

887
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,873
I would say to him, you're
going to ruin your marriage.

888
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:30,071
What is wrong with you?

889
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:35,311
Until one night, I told him,
I had gotten even with him.

890
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:42,380
MAN: Steve asked Neile whether
she'd ever had an affair.

891
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,087
I said, well, as a matter
of fact, I said, yeah, I had.

892
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,103
I was the one
person in the world

893
00:57:55,205 --> 00:58:00,643
that he trusted, the
one person he thought

894
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,008
he could do anything to.

895
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,171
I would never retaliate.

896
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,983
For him to hear
that coming from me

897
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:13,419
was totally unbelievable to him.

898
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:20,590
He was really, really,
deeply wounded.

899
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:28,898
MAN: It was him, not her.

900
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,497
He's the one that
just had this hunger.

901
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:36,111
MAN: And you think,
my god, the next day

902
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,476
he's got to get up,
and go out, and drive

903
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,673
a 917 at 200 miles an hour.

904
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,650
The whole situation
was problematic.

905
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:56,996
[car racing]

906
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:12,346
MAN: The one thing he wanted
to do is what we were doing.

907
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:16,282
He wanted to be a racing driver.

908
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:18,013
STEVE MCQUEEN:
It's a combination

909
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:21,955
of trying to use a motor car and
yourself as one complete unit.

910
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:25,392
It's really an umbilical
connection between the two,

911
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,985
the man and the machine.

912
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,835
MAN: 248 miles an hour.

913
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:38,340
Just imagine losing control
and hitting that Armco rail.

914
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:49,113
Well, racing, it's life.

915
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:53,348
Anything that happens before
or after is just waiting.

916
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:57,749
That's a good
sentence for Steve.

917
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,558
Sometimes, I had the
feeling it is like this.

918
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:11,999
It meant a lot to him,
almost everything.

919
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,182
And we had a scene where
we get out of the car

920
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,046
after two hours of driving.

921
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,416
Of course, you sweat.

922
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,148
And the makeup man
came, and put some water

923
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:31,057
in my face, and hair.

924
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,391
And he wanted to
do this to Steve.

925
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,658
And Steve said,
no, no, no, no, no.

926
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,562
He stepped in his car.

927
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:40,899
He drove a couple of
rounds, got out of the car.

928
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,461
He was sweating naturally.

929
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:47,600
And he said, Siggy,
look at this.

930
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:51,840
It's swollen here, the vein.

931
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:55,543
So that is the perfect thing.

932
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:59,452
The makeup man can't do this.

933
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:02,649
It has to be real.

934
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:04,249
And Steve wanted it like this.

935
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,898
STEVE MCQUEEN: As an actor,
if you get in the position

936
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:15,733
to be able to have
control, or as a filmmaker,

937
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,933
you must carry your project.

938
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,374
Carry it all the way
through, to the end.

939
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:23,104
That means you can't give up.

940
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,340
You can't let a thing go.

941
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:26,813
And nobody will make
a decision for you,

942
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,247
and nobody's smarter
than you are.

943
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:41,458
MAN: There was really no script.

944
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,362
We were winging it.

945
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:47,061
In the meantime, until we
got somewhat of a script,

946
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:50,594
we were shooting just footage.

947
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,301
Hollywood is a
formula they like,

948
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,640
and they like to stick to it.

949
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,239
They wanted to have
more of a love story.

950
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:03,216
My dad wanted cars and realism.

951
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:11,825
MAN: You had a mental picture
of a documentary, something that

952
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:15,660
was paired down to give you
the total experience of what

953
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,860
was going on.

954
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:22,062
MAN: People like
myself felt Le Mans

955
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:27,440
would make a great background
for a dramatic story.

956
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:31,708
That debate caused
writers to come,

957
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:37,775
and go, and take a shot at the
script that would make sense.

958
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:40,186
MAN: They were called
dueling caravans,

959
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,918
because they were lined
up next to each other.

960
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:49,191
Who could get the latest new
script on Steve's desk first?

961
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:52,393
MAN: He was trying to write the
great American novel when he

962
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,129
was trying to write the script.

963
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:57,695
And because the first sentence
written was in the greatest

964
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,639
sentence ever
written, he couldn't

965
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:02,438
get himself to that point,
putting it down on paper.

966
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,475
MAN: Everybody that went
to the box office back then

967
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:08,517
said, oh, he's going to win it.

968
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:09,744
He's going to win it.

969
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,786
So let's throw a
little wrench in this.

970
01:03:11,854 --> 01:03:13,116
I'm going to give him
something different.

971
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,081
OK, Steve.

972
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:18,660
You walk into this caravan.

973
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:21,219
You see this girl you
haven't seen in a long time.

974
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:24,289
And she looks up at
you and says, hello.

975
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,368
What would you say, hello?

976
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:29,871
And he said, not necessarily.

977
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:31,770
That was the lowest
point for me.

978
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:34,240
I thought, we're never
going to get a script.

979
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,986
If I had written the script,
I know it would have worked.

980
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:49,853
It would have worked.

981
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:50,950
I was his boy.

982
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,550
I was his writer.

983
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:55,495
His favorite expression is
the son of a bitch knows me.

984
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:57,122
I don't know how,
but he knows me.

985
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:05,897
The meeting took
place in Steve's home.

986
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:18,720
He insisted that the
character had to be a loser,

987
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:20,779
and I didn't want
to write a loser.

988
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:27,718
You have to remember,
I was also a star.

989
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:32,496
I thought I had a write
to insist on my position.

990
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:41,374
He just wanted to lose in that
movie, and I don't know why.

991
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:45,312
Steve wanted to have
something more than just

992
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,748
Steve McQueen doing
Steve McQueen on film.

993
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,284
You're talking
about something he

994
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:53,811
wanted to do that was more
important than acting.

995
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:01,657
You shouldn't argue
with a superstar,

996
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,258
even if you helped
make him a superstar.

997
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:08,235
I was the highest paid
screenwriter in town

998
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:10,464
when I went to that meeting.

999
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:13,736
And after that meeting,
the phone never rang again.

[cars racing]

1001
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:45,572
His love of cars
were so infectious

1002
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:47,370
that is screwed me up for life.

1003
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,443
Since day one when I
got here, I'm like, dad,

1004
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,882
can you just give me a ride
in one of the race cars?

1005
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,046
That's all I wanted.

1006
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,419
Must've been two months
went by, and my dad

1007
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:03,185
turned the car around.

1008
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:04,624
He opened his right
door, the side door,

1009
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:06,695
and went like that,
turned around,

1010
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,229
and he sat me on his lap.

1011
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:12,063
And I just put my hands
inside of his hands.

1012
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:13,658
For a second, he pulled
his hands out the wheel,

1013
01:06:13,769 --> 01:06:15,396
and I was steering the 917.

1014
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,405
And that was pretty bitching.

1015
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,142
Yeah, baby!

1016
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:26,077
Ha, ha!

1017
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:32,109
NEILE ADAMS: Chad didn't tell us
that he hit a wall in Daytona.

1018
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:35,384
He's got 16 screws on his
neck, and he's got a rod

1019
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,325
on either side of his spine.

1020
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:42,022
I broke everything in my body.

1021
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:43,224
And the reason
I'm wearing shades

1022
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:44,766
is my right eye
is still towed in.

1023
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:52,137
I was in a coma for
three and a half weeks.

1024
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:54,072
Did I say that?

1025
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,337
Would I change anything?

1026
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:56,138
No.

1027
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:57,007
I wouldn't.

1028
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:57,738
Pretty neat, huh?

1029
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,776
There is nothing
better, nothing better.

1030
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,220
I mean, motorsports is the
strongest drug in the world.

1031
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,870
STEVE MCQUEEN: We attempted
to show in the film,

1032
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,914
rather than to explain it,
just to show why a man races.

1033
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,709
The feelings that
he gets from it.

1034
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:42,757
It's a great sense of freedom.

1035
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,850
It's a high of one
sort or another.

1036
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:57,535
MAN: To drive a car in
perfect condition to the limit

1037
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,107
was the most gratifying
thing you ever did.

1038
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,901
It's almost like a
ballet, with the car

1039
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:06,607
going in through the corners.

1040
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:10,311
And it's a thing of beauty.

1041
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:11,080
It is a work of art.

1042
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:21,188
I went 330 kilometers per hour.

1043
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:28,900
The faster I went, the
more relaxed I was.

1044
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:32,531
But when it's finished,
you have the time to think,

1045
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:37,136
and then you're glad that
nothing happened more.

1046
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:45,513
MAN: It overtakes drivers,
without them knowing it.

1047
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:49,718
The freedom of an eagle
floating in the sky

1048
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:53,228
was something that
racing brought to him.

1049
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:08,740
Whatever that other stuff was
that came from his upbringing,

1050
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:09,607
he could set that aside.

1051
01:09:13,215 --> 01:09:14,239
Death is so close.

1052
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:15,908
It's right on my shoulder.

1053
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:19,944
And yet, there's a peace here.

1054
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:23,081
And he actually found
such joy in that, that he

1055
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,319
wanted to give that to people.

1056
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,765
I've always wanted to shoot
a motor racing picture,

1057
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:35,600
because it's always been
something close to my heart.

1058
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:40,301
I sometimes thought, well,
maybe I shouldn't do it.

1059
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,070
When something is
close to you, you

1060
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:46,171
have a tendency to become too
much a perfectionist with it.

1061
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:49,046
And I don't think there's
any race driver that can

1062
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,415
really tell you why he races.

1063
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:56,747
But I think he could
probably show you.

1064
01:09:56,825 --> 01:10:00,124
[cars racing]

1065
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:09,364
MAN: He was not Hercules.

1066
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:12,599
He was Icarus.

1067
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:18,773
Steve wanted to fly so
high, and he didn't quite

1068
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:23,216
understand the point where the
wax starts to leave your wings.

1069
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:47,773
PRODUCER: Through the
set, through the set.

1070
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,537
And cars are rolling.

1071
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:58,015
[crashing]

1072
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,748
MAN: I was rolling.

1073
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:00,879
They had to pay the drivers.

1074
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:01,979
They had to pay the camera men.

1075
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:03,490
They had to pay the sound men.

1076
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,686
They had to pay the people
that fed them at lunch.

1077
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,558
[tires screeching]

1078
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:10,791
And the people in the cinema
center were checking in.

1079
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:12,026
How are things going over there?

1080
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,035
Well, not so good.

1081
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,128
We ain't got no story.

1082
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:20,072
We were approximately
$1.5 million over budget.

1083
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:23,167
And the studio was expecting
a Steve McQueen movie to bail

1084
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:26,737
us out, and we didn't have it.

1085
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:28,646
We were going to make
the most expensive

1086
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:32,016
documentary in the world,
if somebody didn't talk.

1087
01:11:32,087 --> 01:11:35,056
Everybody was looking
for the same thing,

1088
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,989
with one exception--
with one exception,

1089
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:38,354
and that would be Steve McQueen.

1090
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:52,071
MAN: The truth is we had gone
into a rather lengthy debate

1091
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,972
over the basis of the film.

1092
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:00,911
My father went back to
his production office,

1093
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:05,682
and in a fit of rage, threw
a lamp against the wall.

1094
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:09,087
[glass breaking]

1095
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:12,821
He said, this picture's
fucking out of control.

1096
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:14,259
MAN: And it was at
that moment that he

1097
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,322
turned and saw Bob Rosen
reclining on his couch,

1098
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:20,368
reading a magazine.

1099
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:21,562
MAN: Wrong guy was in the room.

1100
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:30,609
Bob called the studio and said,
we've got real problems now.

1101
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,613
They're falling out
among themselves.

1102
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,413
MAN: I don't remember
that happening.

1103
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:39,249
Could it have happened?

1104
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:40,845
Yeah.

1105
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:44,289
But it wasn't like a revelation.

1106
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,828
Everybody knew the picture
was out of control.

1107
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:54,659
MAN: Cinema Center's answer was
we'll take the picture over.

1108
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:57,466
Now, we call the shots,
and we make the decision.

1109
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,803
We don't care which
script you make.

1110
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:02,639
Just make one of them.

1111
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,544
NEILE ADAMS: And you, Steve,
will lose your salary,

1112
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:07,808
will not get your points.

1113
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:12,013
You have nothing to do with
this picture, except act.

1114
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:14,954
MAN: We don't got no picture.

1115
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:17,116
Last night, they took
the picture away from us.

1116
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:33,997
It says, I have
read the foregoing

1117
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,909
and agree to render
services only as an actor

1118
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,503
in the picture.

1119
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:47,386
And then my dad signed
his name, "in blood."

1120
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:48,581
It's brilliant.

1121
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:51,626
It goes in character
with my dad.

1122
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:52,682
I love this shit.

1123
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,964
STEVE MCQUEEN: There's a great
deal of compromise involved

1124
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,332
in movies, I suppose, and I get
a bit undone when people try

1125
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,770
to use me, or there's
compromises, or injustice,

1126
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:06,306
and I fly off the handle.

1127
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:14,543
Steve was furious
with my father.

1128
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,413
At this point, in
McQueen's mind,

1129
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:19,009
my father had gone over to
the other side of the fence

1130
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:19,712
and betrayed him.

1131
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:28,025
This racing picture was
so close to all of us

1132
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:30,894
that when the
studio took it over,

1133
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:35,130
Mr. McQueen felt that
that had put a knife

1134
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:38,729
in the heart of the company.

1135
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:41,970
And Steve and I did
not speak again.

1136
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,578
You betrayed me.

1137
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:46,636
You stabbed me in the back.

1138
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,079
I'll never talk to you again.

1139
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:57,517
CHAD MCQUEEN: Loyalty was
a big thing with my dad.

1140
01:14:57,593 --> 01:15:04,294
If my dad felt in any way that
he had been burnt, that was it.

1141
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,163
I don't think my
father betrayed Steve.

1142
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:09,170
But I think he fell again,
as a business person,

1143
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,536
as a professional, that that
was going to be the course it

1144
01:15:11,607 --> 01:15:13,097
was headed for, no matter what.

1145
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:18,803
Thanks very much, Bob Relyea.

1146
01:15:18,914 --> 01:15:20,347
Thank you very
much, Mr. Sturges.

1147
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:21,074
Bye.

1148
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,812
John came to me.

1149
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:30,585
And he said, I'm going to quit.

1150
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:34,857
And it came about because of
the relationship with Steve.

1151
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:37,659
MAN: John Sturges was
brought in to make

1152
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:42,703
a theatrical motion picture with
characters and a story in it.

1153
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:46,798
The more John tried
to have it his way,

1154
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:50,367
the less ground
Steve would give him.

1155
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:54,643
He said, I'm too fucking
old and rich to put up

1156
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,014
with this type of shit anymore.

1157
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:57,744
Goodbye.

1158
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:07,491
Now, here we are, half
way in the production,

1159
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,430
and they don't have a director.

1160
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:11,362
Now, what?

1161
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:17,464
STEVE MCQUEEN:
There's a lot of ways

1162
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:20,064
that man can be
hurt in business.

1163
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:21,836
They can hurt your head.

1164
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:24,003
They can hurt you financially.

1165
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:25,740
They can gut you.

1166
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:28,680
Or they can cause that thing
to pop up in your throat.

1167
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,012
A couple of times
a day, you start

1168
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,017
thinking about it a little bit.

1169
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,246
He was nothing but success
up to the point of "Le Mans."

1170
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,622
Everything that he
did turned to gold.

1171
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,193
And now, "Le Mans,"
everything turned to shit.

1172
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:02,680
MAN: I've always wanted
to know if Steve had

1173
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:05,276
walked off the production
at that point, what

1174
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:06,012
would've happened.

1175
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:11,385
MAN: Call it ego.

1176
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,256
Call it his name.

1177
01:17:15,397 --> 01:17:18,525
It's not good press if the
world's number one box office

1178
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:25,529
attraction walks off a film, a
film that meant so much to him.

1179
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:27,802
CHAD MCQUEEN: There
was no quit in my dad.

1180
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:29,774
He had something
that he started,

1181
01:17:29,878 --> 01:17:31,641
and he wanted to finish it.

1182
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,794
MAN: We're rolling, guys.

1183
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:50,694
Thank you.

1184
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,063
Guys, settle, please.

1185
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:52,930
[Laughing]

1186
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:58,098
I come in on a Monday morning.

1187
01:17:58,173 --> 01:17:59,640
And Jerry Henshaw
comes in, says how

1188
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:02,676
would you like to go to France?

1189
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:03,403
That's how it happened.

1190
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,839
They had no story.

1191
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:12,579
They knew that Steve was
never going to win the race.

1192
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:14,747
That's about what they knew.

1193
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:16,313
MAN: I can see him
now with the glasses,

1194
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:19,519
and that funny hat he
wore the whole time.

1195
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:23,724
He wasn't this mogul, this
great icon of the movie world.

1196
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:27,599
He was a guy called Lee Katzin,
who nobody had heard of.

1197
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:29,967
Poor old Lee didn't know the
front of a car from the back,

1198
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,835
so that wasn't helpful.

1199
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,306
McQueen hadn't chosen
him, didn't like him,

1200
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,401
wasn't impressed by him.

1201
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:39,969
And he was obliged
to work with him.

1202
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:41,572
MAN: They did a
take in the pits.

1203
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:44,516
And Lee said, one more please.

1204
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:45,586
Steve got up.

1205
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:47,019
And he said, listen, asshole.

1206
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,919
I'II tell you when
we get one more.

1207
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,082
Move to your next shot.

1208
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:53,958
And if I like it, I'll show up.

1209
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:57,988
The problems of individual's
egos were there.

1210
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,864
It wasn't a lot of
fun that way, at all.

1211
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:11,342
[cars racing]

1212
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:17,151
Come on.

1213
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:17,810
I want to show you something.

1214
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:29,926
Come on.

1215
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:30,862
Walk with me.

1216
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:41,604
I want to get down here, because
this is where Dave Piper lost

1217
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:43,041
it, right in this right hander.

1218
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:01,724
We'd been filming
in the morning.

1219
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:05,255
Everything went according
to plan, no problem.

1220
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:09,064
Went to lunch, came
back to the circuit,

1221
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:12,402
and the director wanted
the Ferraris to be

1222
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:14,066
leading with a Porsche behind.

1223
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:20,809
They haven't decided what
the script was going to be,

1224
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:22,747
and they wanted both options.

1225
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:30,353
[cars racing]

1226
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:42,693
I drove just as I had
driven in the morning, went

1227
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:44,432
into this right hand corner.

1228
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:52,445
The back end just went.

1229
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:53,811
[crash]

1230
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,838
Word had gotten
back to the compound

1231
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:19,634
that there was an accident.

1232
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,676
And I got that.

1233
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:25,075
And I was thinking, geez,
I hope it's not my dad.

1234
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:27,580
I hear the triad a lot.

1235
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,276
And so what's going on?

1236
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:32,843
He says, I want to show you
what can happen in motor racing.

1237
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:37,323
Steve, I'm calling you to tell
you that we're having accident.

1238
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:40,589
David Piper, he's been
taken to hospital.

1239
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:43,960
This was all grass, and
I remember a couple cows.

1240
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:46,694
And there was a wheel assembly,
sitting out in the middle

1241
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:48,325
of fucking nowhere.

1242
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:51,702
Uh, well, he had a crash.

1243
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:59,177
MAN: He was left bolted
onto the engine in the seat,

1244
01:21:59,247 --> 01:22:00,737
and the rest of the car
took off and left him.

1245
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:08,519
You can see there's quite a lot
of blood coming out of your leg

1246
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,081
in your overalls.

1247
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:16,152
But it's a tremendous
relief that you're

1248
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:20,031
still conscious and alive.

1249
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,898
MAN: David has been injured.

1250
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:23,971
I just spoke to the pilot.

1251
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:26,872
He will come in at night.

1252
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,773
It was my doctor.

1253
01:22:28,877 --> 01:22:30,344
He said, we're going
to have to amputate.

1254
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:37,742
I said, well, take it off
four inches below the knee,

1255
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:38,682
and I'll take my chances.

1256
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:52,794
My mom took me, my
sister to see Dave.

1257
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:55,233
And I remember
the room was dark,

1258
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:58,500
and I remember he
had a sheet over him.

1259
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:04,875
And you could clearly see
that below his knee was gone.

1260
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:06,106
I lost it there.

1261
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:07,306
I lost that much.

1262
01:23:24,232 --> 01:23:25,597
INTERVIEWER: Would
your accident have

1263
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,659
happened if a proper
script had been in place?

1264
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:29,896
Oh, no.

1265
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:31,563
It probably wouldn't
have done, yeah.

1266
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:33,004
Definitely wouldn't have done,
because they wouldn't have

1267
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:34,234
wanted to do the shot twice.

1268
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:40,042
MAN: It shouldn't have happened.

1269
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:42,948
[engine vrooming]

1270
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:46,780
MAN: With David Piper,
Steve was very, very aware

1271
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,790
and very worried about it.

1272
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:54,386
You'd think it was his fault.

1273
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,987
MAN: It's his film.

1274
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:58,861
The bucks stops at the top.

1275
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:09,475
I never saw him afterwards.

1276
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:10,169
No.

1277
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:17,718
Just never happened
to see him again.

1278
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,487
STEVE MCQUEEN: It was a film
that took us four months

1279
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:28,552
to shoot, and was
very difficult,

1280
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:32,258
and we had a couple
of very bad accidents.

1281
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,699
It was the most difficult
film I've ever done.

1282
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:48,812
MAN: One morning,
at Solar Village,

1283
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:51,215
no one else was there
but myself and Steve.

1284
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:54,345
And he said, Lee, I see
what you're trying to do,

1285
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,219
and I'm not going to fight you.

1286
01:24:56,324 --> 01:24:57,416
I'm not going to be against you.

1287
01:24:57,492 --> 01:25:00,461
I want to work with you.

1288
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:04,157
From that time on,
it was wonderful.

1289
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:08,726
We battered out an outline
that Steve agreed to.

1290
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:11,965
It took 6, 8, 10 weeks
for this to happen.

1291
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:17,239
And finally, we got basically
what we had in the movie,

1292
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:19,973
in terms of dialogue.

1293
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:23,040
When people risk their
lives, shouldn't it be

1294
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,710
for something very important?

1295
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:31,150
Well, it better be.

1296
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:36,254
MAN: He was trying to vindicate
the purpose of the film

1297
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:40,198
by making sure it was
finished and would be

1298
01:25:40,268 --> 01:25:46,070
a testament to the personal
bravery of his most respected

1299
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,904
pals, the motor racing drivers.

1300
01:25:57,418 --> 01:26:00,546
WOMAN: It was late
October or November.

1301
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:05,559
And the trees were
turning yellow.

1302
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:09,324
It should be within

1303
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:12,888
So they had to paint the leaves.

1304
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:14,264
Ugh, my goodness.

1305
01:26:17,071 --> 01:26:19,403
MAN: In November,
1970, filming finally

1306
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:23,342
wrapped three months
over schedule,

1307
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:25,742
and about $1.5
million over budget.

1308
01:26:31,786 --> 01:26:38,248
He was sort of
melancholy, I think.

1309
01:26:38,326 --> 01:26:39,657
He said, it's done.

1310
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:48,565
The last day of filming,
he got out of his car,

1311
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:54,233
and he unbuckled his wrist
watch, and walked over to me,

1312
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:56,777
and handed me the watch.

1313
01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:58,778
And he said, I want
you to have this.

1314
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:01,178
Thank you for keeping me
alive all these months.

1315
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,186
STEVE MCQUEEN: 
Le Mans is close to me.

1316
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:10,951
I love motor racing.

1317
01:27:11,025 --> 01:27:14,119
It was a film that was
very, very close to me,

1318
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:15,856
and we all hope
it turns out well.

1319
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,333
CREW: Camera number
three, marker.

1320
01:27:22,403 --> 01:27:24,268
CREW: Camera number
four, marker.

1321
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:26,738
CREW: Camera number
five, marker.

1322
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:30,174
DIRECTOR: We now have
speed on all the cameras.

1323
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:34,079
I will call action, and
then it'll be a count of 10.

1324
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:39,210
If anything happens to me,
Allie gets my pickup truck.

1325
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,685
DIRECTOR: Guys, can
you hear me all right?

1326
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:41,551
All right.

1327
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:44,022
The fire brigade ready?

1328
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,286
All right.

1329
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:47,190
Now, may I have your
attention please?

1330
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:19,257
CHAD MCQUEEN: I don't care
what anybody else says.

1331
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,887
I think he was satisfied
as a filmmaker at what

1332
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:27,094
he had done for this picture.

1333
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:30,398
I've never seen the movie.

1334
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:33,406
It's too difficult for me.

1335
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:37,501
Steve lost his wife, lost
his marriage, lost the film,

1336
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:38,442
Iost everything.

1337
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:49,252
MAN: All of that
loss, at that point

1338
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:53,283
in time, I think it really
speaks to how deeply he cared

1339
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:58,093
about that project, and how it
was so tied into his persona,

1340
01:28:58,166 --> 01:29:01,602
and his soul, that I think he
sensed that if it wasn't going

1341
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:02,863
to happen on that
film, it wasn't going

1342
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:06,804
to happen in his lifetime.

1343
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,102
STEVE MCQUEEN: Being
an actor is a gas.

1344
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,804
Being a movie star
is a pain in the ass.

1345
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:15,679
And when that happens, you
stop your personal growth.

1346
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:19,743
And that's the thing
that I suffered from.

1347
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:22,312
MAN: When he wanted
to give back,

1348
01:29:22,423 --> 01:29:26,257
Hollywood wasn't there for him.

1349
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:31,594
He had this vision that
came out of his heart.

1350
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:34,464
I don't think any of those other
movies came out of his heart.

1351
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,006
The world just became
a different color

1352
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:44,442
to him, after that film.

1353
01:29:57,358 --> 01:30:01,624
MAN: "Le Mans" is a
turning point in his life.

1354
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:05,655
When he left Le Mans, he
turned his back on the sport.

1355
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:09,430
The zest he had for
driving fast had gone.

1356
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:15,101
STEVE MCQUEEN: As far
as me moving on myself,

1357
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:17,610
I think I'm more into
life than cinema.

1358
01:30:17,678 --> 01:30:21,170
My conception can only be
motorcycles, and speed,

1359
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:22,216
and things like that.

1360
01:30:22,316 --> 01:30:23,112
I don't want to do that anymore.

1361
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:23,775
I don't do it no more.

1362
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:27,747
Now, I'm clean.

1363
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,227
Well, it's done.

1364
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:34,624
I've got to try something else.

1365
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:43,033
Do I really want
to do this anymore?

1366
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:46,437
Do I want to go that fast?

1367
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:50,170
And I think with David
Piper's accident,

1368
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:54,613
an awareness of
the vulnerability

1369
01:30:54,715 --> 01:30:56,012
was in his psyche.

1370
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:04,455
NEILE ADAMS: What he cared
most about in that picture

1371
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:06,857
were the drivers.

1372
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:08,725
He loved the drivers.

1373
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:18,936
Oh.

1374
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:23,909
Dear Sid, so many times before,
in the history of motion

1375
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:27,243
pictures, brave men have
lost their lives and limbs,

1376
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,579
and people have
forgotten about it.

1377
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:33,177
I feel very strongly
that we should dedicate

1378
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:37,747
the first premier to David
Piper and give all the proceeds

1379
01:31:37,825 --> 01:31:40,350
to him and his family.

1380
01:31:40,461 --> 01:31:44,557
Would you please pass
this on to the higher ups?

1381
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:47,260
And I do think we
do this to racing

1382
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:50,361
for what they gave this film.

1383
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:53,497
My best, Steve McQueen.

1384
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:56,441
Oh, how wonderful.

1385
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,376
Gosh, that is terrific.

1386
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:04,414
I really lost touch
when I was in hospital.

1387
01:32:04,485 --> 01:32:09,184
I never heard of
anything like this.

1388
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:12,259
How very nice.

1389
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:14,988
Well, Steve's heart was really
in the right place, wasn't it?

1390
01:32:15,096 --> 01:32:15,755
It's fantastic.

1391
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:33,643
STEVE MCQUEEN: I just wanted
to get it down on film for what

1392
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,306
I thought it was all about.

1393
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,749
And I guess it's going to be
up to the audience to decide

1394
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:38,682
whether I was right or wrong.

1395
01:32:43,624 --> 01:32:45,387
Oh, it was a lot of cars.

1396
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:52,890
And I was waiting for my scenes.

1397
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,991
[Laughing]

1398
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:57,560
Most actors do that, first
time they see a movie.

1399
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:05,804
I was disappointed.

1400
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,142
I could never see
how it was going

1401
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:09,205
to be a roaring
success at the time,

1402
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:10,249
because there was no script.

1403
01:33:14,388 --> 01:33:16,686
But then I saw the
film two years ago,

1404
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:18,850
and I went, god,
that's brilliant.

1405
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:25,624
MAN: It's the most wonderful
documentary of one of the most

1406
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:29,568
glorious times of motor
racing on the greatest

1407
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:30,466
track in the world.

1408
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:37,536
From an actor's point
of view, loves it.

1409
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:40,979
But from his point of view,
from a driver's point of view,

1410
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:42,572
lovely.

1411
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:45,151
And from a car's point
of view, beautiful.

1412
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:53,950
MAN: It gets acclaim, because
it's trying to be pure.

1413
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:55,722
It's not a Hollywood concoction.

1414
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:01,733
But what the film
doesn't capture

1415
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:02,826
is dramatic storytelling.

1416
01:34:10,044 --> 01:34:13,377
Problems, they vanish
in all the years.

1417
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:25,415
I think he would have
been proud that we did it.

1418
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,154
Proud that he did it.

1419
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:49,106
MAN: What's happened now is a
cult is following this picture.

1420
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:56,812
People who are into
cars revere this film.

1421
01:34:56,924 --> 01:34:59,449
That's all they want to
talk about is "Le Mans."

1422
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,552
It has taken on a
life of its own.

1423
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:10,633
The thing that Steve did
that moved cinema forward

1424
01:35:10,705 --> 01:35:13,697
was his absolute
insistence on authenticity.

1425
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:20,073
You just have to say,
you went for it, guy.

1426
01:35:20,147 --> 01:35:21,842
I say, power to him.

1427
01:35:25,319 --> 01:35:26,843
They still are
not able to capture

1428
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:31,084
what we captured inside those
cars with the real drivers

1429
01:35:31,158 --> 01:35:32,989
today.

1430
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:36,689
Steve McQueen, he had no fear.

1431
01:35:53,314 --> 01:35:58,445
When he went to Mexico
to get treatment,

1432
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:00,646
he had a copy of the
film shipped to Mexico,

1433
01:36:00,721 --> 01:36:02,188
and showed it to the
patients in the house.

1434
01:36:08,395 --> 01:36:15,824
I think it was his last
goodbye to everything.

1435
01:36:15,903 --> 01:36:20,101
He was just a nice man who
lost his way along the way,

1436
01:36:20,207 --> 01:36:21,640
and found it back.

1437
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:27,670
And hopefully, he's up
there, having a good time.

1438
01:36:27,748 --> 01:36:30,273
Like I used to say,
safe travel, honey.

1439
01:36:30,384 --> 01:36:31,681
[Laughing]

1440
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:44,794
I always get a sense
he's watching me,

1441
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:48,699
but close your eyes,
and listen to that.

1442
01:36:48,769 --> 01:36:50,600
Close your eyes and
listen to this again.

1443
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:57,767
So that's what my
dad envisioned,

1444
01:36:57,878 --> 01:36:59,175
bringing that to life.

1445
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:06,015
But I think today he
would say, ah, now,

1446
01:37:06,086 --> 01:37:07,747
you guys finally get it.

1447
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:35,715
STEVE MCQUEEN: My big
thing is daydreaming.

1448
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:39,446
You know when you
daydream, you go to sleep.

1449
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,488
In my life, my
daydreams came true.

1450
01:37:44,491 --> 01:37:45,458
[coughs]

1451
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:46,618
It's just that I run out of gas.

1452
01:37:57,304 --> 01:38:00,171
[piano playing]
