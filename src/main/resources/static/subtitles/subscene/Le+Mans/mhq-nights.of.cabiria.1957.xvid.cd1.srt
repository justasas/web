1
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,376
Go over there.

2
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,055
It's beautiful!
Come on!

3
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,613
Giorgio!

4
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:39,549
Help! Help!

5
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,625
Help! Somebody's drowning!

6
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,412
Where's Romolo?

7
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,380
He went to City Hall.

8
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,746
To hell with City Hall!

9
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,648
It's a woman.

10
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,149
There she is!

11
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,827
Tino's not here either?

12
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,826
Is she trying to drown herself?

13
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,397
There she is.
Go in after her.

14
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,096
Jump! If she gets to the sewer
she won't come up again.

15
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,135
A woman's drowning!

16
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:40,445
You guys head her off.
I'll go in after her.

17
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,797
Pascello, run!
Come over here!

18
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,802
What are you doing? Not like that!
Turn her upside down!

19
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,667
Stefano, hurry up!

20
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,637
Where'd you fish her out?

21
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,143
Careful.
Hold her under the stomach.

22
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,780
She was drowning!

23
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,109
She probably slipped.
Mario saw her.

24
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,013
She musta slipped
and fell in.

25
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,153
- Did she jump off the bridge?
- No.

26
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,151
- Did she go under?
- Three times.

27
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,291
- At least seven times!
- Ten times!

28
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,895
She must have swallowed a lot.
We'll need some help. Stefano!

29
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,365
What happened?

30
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,001
- Faster with the arms!
- She lost a shoe.

31
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,236
I think she's dead.

32
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,712
Get the water out,
before it's too late.

33
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,217
Look how it's rushing out.
Move it, kids!

34
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:57,481
<i>We</i> saved her!

35
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,386
Beat it!

36
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,658
Let's get Pompeo.
He never seen anyone drown before.

37
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:03,558
Look.

38
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,858
I don't wanna look.
I'm afraid.

39
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,036
Looks dead to me.

40
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,606
Dead bodies don't
throw up water.

41
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,367
She opened her eyes!

42
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,876
She opened her eyes!
Put her down.

43
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,776
We'll give her
artificial respiration.

44
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,449
She's bleeding.

45
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,711
It's just a scratch.

46
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,349
What she needs is brandy.

47
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,857
Brandy nothing!
What she needs is milk.

48
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:41,598
Quiet! She's coming to. You, with
the motorbike, go get some milk.

49
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,360
I'm outta gas.

50
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,538
Take it easy now.

51
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,475
You're all right.
You can thank the Holy Father.

52
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,905
You're fine.

53
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:53,575
Where's Giorgio?

54
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,146
What Giorgio?

55
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,419
Where are you going?

56
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,623
Who's she looking for?

57
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,259
- Wasn't she alone?
- Yes.

58
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,671
Who does he think he is?

59
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,473
Take it easy. Come here.

60
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,942
I'm going home.
Where are my shoes?

61
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,245
Here. There's only one.

62
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,287
She's got seven souls, like a cat.

63
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,150
See? She can hardly stand up.

64
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,257
Poor thing. She's in bad shape.

65
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,621
You were almost dead.

66
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,356
Leave me alone!
Let go of me!

67
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,423
Hey! We're the ones who saved you!

68
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,935
You saved me.
Now I wanna go home, okay?

69
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,434
Okay, suit yourself.
Go home. Good-bye.

70
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,801
Hi, Cabiria.

71
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,442
You know her?

72
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,843
Sure. She's Cabiria.

73
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,210
Where's she live?

74
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,614
On Via Cecilia.

75
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,177
She lives the life.

76
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,483
Giorgio! Open up! It's me!

77
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,713
It's me! Cabiria!

78
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,231
Wanda!

79
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,944
Wanda! Have you seen Giorgio?

80
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,242
What happened to you?

81
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,942
Mind your own business.
Did you see Giorgio?

82
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,417
<i>- Which Giorgio?
- My</i> Giorgio.

83
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,648
What happened to you?

84
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,964
What do you want from me?

85
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:27,923
What do <i>you</i> want?

86
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,500
I don't want nothing.
Mind your own fat ass!

87
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,557
Go inside and dry yourself off.

88
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,521
I don't have the keys.

89
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,155
Where'd you put them?

90
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,693
In my purse.

91
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,989
Where's your purse?

92
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,569
Giorgio's got it.

93
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,236
We took a walk by the river and...

94
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,570
I fell in.

95
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,110
He got scared and ran away.

96
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,908
Cabiria! Open up!

97
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,048
Come on, open up.

98
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,587
I gotta sleep!

99
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,788
Tell me something.

100
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,894
How much did you have
in your purse? Answer me.

101
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,248
If you see Giorgio, I'm right here.

102
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,006
What are you doing?

103
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,812
You're right to stay home.

104
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,316
Go to bed and
get some sleep.

105
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,682
I'll see you later
when I get back.

106
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,427
Why didn't you take your aspirin?
Take it, it'll do you good.

107
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,997
<i>You</i> still here?
Aren't you tired of yakkin'?

108
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,724
Can't you see I had enough?

109
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,895
Get lost!

110
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,837
Who told you
we were friends?

111
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,803
Get lost, will you?

112
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,675
And don't come borrowing
my thermometer anymore!

113
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,972
Who's asking <i>you</i> for anything?
What a nut!

114
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,209
You're a sweetheart!

115
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,227
Someone would throw you in the
river for 40,000 lire?

116
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,197
Drown you for 40,000 lire?

117
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,304
Nowadays they'll do it for 5,000.

118
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,896
Someone who loves you?

119
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,172
What love?
You met him a month ago.

120
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,743
You don't know his name
or where he lives.

121
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,676
Can't you understand?
He pushed you in!

122
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,408
He pushed you in the river!

123
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,183
And you were lucky,
because if it had been me...

124
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,482
I'd have held your head under
myself! You nut!

125
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,423
Tell the cops!

126
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,651
I'm no stool pigeon!

127
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,431
Take my advice!
Report him!

128
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,671
But why? Why'd he do it?
I gave him everything.

129
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:56,832
I gave him everything he wanted.
He didn't have to do it.

130
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,549
I'm such a moron.

131
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,206
What if I died?

132
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,609
That's it! The party's over!

133
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,281
We're through! Finished!

134
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,576
Silk shirts! I'll give you silk shirts!

135
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,653
Find another jerk like me!

136
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,917
Look what I bought him!
A checked suit!

137
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:25,223
Camel-hair coat!
Never again! Never!

138
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:28,597
And who's gonna feed you now?
St. Peter?

139
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,861
Eternal love!

140
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,163
You dirty <i>vitellone!</i>

141
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,467
Go back to selling balloons!

142
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,008
I'll burn it all!

143
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,876
Chicken soup, veal chops.

144
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,116
You should drop dead!

145
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,000
This is the last time!
You'll never see me here again.

146
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,906
This is my last evening.
I shouldn't even be seen with you!

147
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,508
Look how classy I am.

148
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,584
You look like Moby Dick to me.

149
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,720
How dare you!

150
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,689
Know where you belong?
In the nuthouse!

151
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,693
Use your eyes!
Take a good look at me!

152
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:34,765
Look at me. A <i>grande dame.</i>

153
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,429
She gets worse all the time.

154
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,938
They oughta put her away.

155
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,269
That's how you'll end up!

156
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,036
And that's the heater.

157
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,511
- This car's got everything.
- Even Coca-Cola.

158
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,082
- Gimme a ride?
- This ain't no tank!

159
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,082
- Get out!
- I'm not getting out.

160
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,777
Come on, move!

161
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,852
- Why should I?
- I'm taking Wanda for a ride.

162
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,721
You don't know how to drive.

163
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,428
It's my car. I can do what I want
with it. Get out.

164
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,624
I'll visit you in the hospital.
This I gotta see.

165
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,267
Why not the bigger model?

166
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,531
Another one! What do you know about
cars? You're always in the bushes!

167
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,974
You're always on two wheels!

168
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,609
Here comes the psycho again.

169
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,644
- Bye, handsome.
- Bye, sweetie.

170
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,585
Remember to come see
your princess.

171
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,325
Cute! Real fancy!

172
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,831
Me, I'd have picked a grey one.

173
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,401
It's a fancier color.
But this one's cute.

174
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,336
You're gonna kill the battery!

175
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,839
Wanda, get out.
I don't wanna fight tonight.

176
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,409
Neither do I, you fanatic.

177
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,114
Still, a Fiat is a Fiat.

178
00:16:56,281 --> 00:17:00,412
With a car, life's a lot different.
You sit up there, high up...

179
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:04,818
and you signal right, left,
vroom-vroom.

180
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,792
People think you're well off,
a secretary, a daddy's girl.

181
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,659
The men all chase <i>you.</i>
It feels great!

182
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,630
- Listen to her!
- What?

183
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,998
I know how she got that car!

184
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,565
That cokehead!

185
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,629
Wait!

186
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,464
Stay right here!

187
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,701
- Let me get out!
- Stay!

188
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,686
You're dancing, Cabiria?

189
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,219
You're in luck!
I'm the best dancer in Rome.

190
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,358
Come on!

191
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,832
Now she found another
deadbeat to say "I love you."

192
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:54,905
One who'll send her off begging.

193
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,668
Get off the street, dear,
or I'll have you arrested.

194
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:03,577
Here I am, gentlemen!
Here I am!

195
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,383
Just as well.
Who needs you!

196
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:13,023
Where you going with
the car? To the old-age home?

197
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,918
Maybe if you were 20 years younger!

198
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,819
Filthy flea bag!

199
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,432
You're just jealous!

200
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:26,202
Hear that, Cabiria?
She can't get away with that!

201
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:29,671
Look how you'll end up,
you lousy whore!

202
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:34,573
"Please, be kind.
Have a heart!"

203
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:38,284
"Please, for my Giorgio's sake!"

204
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,713
Do it! Poke her eyes out!

205
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,186
Wanda, here we go again.

206
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,428
<i>Forza, Cabiria!</i>

207
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,038
Never mind her!
Hit her low, in the belly!

208
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:05,208
Don't stop them!
It's too much fun!

209
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,137
Stop it before the cops come!

210
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,547
I'll kill her!

211
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,114
Let go of me!

212
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,590
Get her in the car.

213
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:23,453
Get her away!

214
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,065
- Leave me alone!
- Get inside!

215
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,094
I'll punch you a new face!

216
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,435
It's not over yet!

217
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,079
She ruined my face!

218
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,512
Forget about her.

219
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,346
You're scared of me, right?

220
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,989
You lousy loser!

221
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,025
Have a smoke.

222
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,568
Where you wanna go?

223
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,161
To Via Veneto.

224
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,705
Via Veneto?
Think you're the Empress Poppea?

225
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:15,679
Listen, Cabiria, you and me oughta
have a talk one of these days.

226
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,509
You're not doing it right.

227
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,548
Who's watching over you?

228
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,020
Look at Marisa and me.

229
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,213
She's safe wherever she goes.

230
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,825
Nobody in Rome would harm
a hair on her head.

231
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,819
You know why?

232
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,553
Let me out.

233
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,062
What do you expect
to do here?

234
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,398
Girls fight for spots on
Via Veneto and Villa Borghese.

235
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:45,442
Cabiria, why not find yourself
a serious man? Respectable, like me.

236
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,704
I don't need one.

237
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,507
- I say you do.
- I say I don't!

238
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:53,880
Why should /slave
for filthy pigs like you?

239
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,281
Let's drop it.

240
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,787
Yeah, drop it.
Better let me out.

241
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,015
Yeah, it's better.

242
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,823
So long!

243
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,517
Moron! Degenerate! Go take a walk
on the <i>Passeggiata Archeologica!</i>

244
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,741
Can't I look?

245
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,752
Know how gorgeous you are?

246
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,447
Get going.

247
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:14,254
Oh, yeah? We'll I'm staying
right here! See?

248
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,093
Sorry.

249
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,298
Are you blind?

250
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,773
Jessie!

251
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,509
Jessie! How can this happen?

252
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,047
Alberto Lazzari!

253
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,712
Jessie, I don't want to get upset.

254
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,987
Jessie, cut it out!

255
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,483
Let go!

256
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,658
Don't make me lose my temper.
Come back inside.

257
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,196
Give me the keys.

258
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:58,701
- Go inside. Don't be stupid.
- Don't you touch me, you pig!

259
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,565
Move over. Let me in.
Where are you going? Where?

260
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,541
- Do I get the keys or not?
- No!

261
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,813
- You're not getting out!
- You're hurting me. Let go!

262
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,812
Jessie, dear, listen.

263
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,389
Listen one last time.

264
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:23,687
- There's no more to say.
- I'm tired. You're exhausting!

265
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,490
- Let go! You're ruining my fur.
- I bought it!

266
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:27,927
You louse!

267
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,431
- Wait a second.
- What for?

268
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,031
You can go.

269
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,900
Lousy second-rate ham!

270
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,847
Listen, Jessie. If you don't
come back, it's over!

271
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,408
Fine! It's over!

272
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:47,108
Finished!
At last! So much the better.

273
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,713
Thanks, thanks, Jessie.

274
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,181
What do you want?
Go away!

275
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,540
Hey, you!

276
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:20,475
I'm talking to you!

277
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,411
Get in.

278
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,213
Who, me?

279
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,221
Yes, you. Hurry up. Get in.

280
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,066
Fast!

281
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:48,670
Close it.

282
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:22,369
Get out.

283
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,638
But why?

284
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:25,314
Come on, get out.

285
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,214
What's it gonna be, Mr. Mustache?

286
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:33,950
What's going on here?

287
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,051
Get out, get in, get in, get out!

288
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,286
Make up your mind!

289
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,057
Come on. Let's have some fun.

290
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,927
- He said to go in.
- So go in.

291
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:41,957
How are you, sir? How about a table?
Tonight's show is exceptional.

292
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:44,928
Your umbrella, <i>Signora?</i>

293
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,471
Right this way, <i>Signora.</i>

294
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:13,781
Who's that?

295
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:18,829
May I help you?

296
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,101
Sit over here. Come on.

297
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:24,961
Please.

298
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,499
Sit over there.

299
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,848
Alberto!
Monica.

300
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,890
What are you up to, Alberto?
Are you shooting?

301
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:24,960
- Yes.
- No need to introduce <i>him!</i>

302
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,791
Pleased to meet you.

303
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,660
Yesterday the Americans
gave me a screen test.

304
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:31,694
It turned out fantastic.

305
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:35,999
I have a 16-millimeter print at home
if you want to see it.

306
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,847
Ladies and gentlemen, that was part
one of our show. Before you dance...

307
00:29:53,057 --> 00:29:56,550
I'd like to salute and applaud
an illustrious guest who is...

308
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:58,394
honoring us with his presence.

309
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,697
Must I applaud too, Alberto?

310
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,428
Okay, boys! Mambo number 26!

311
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:14,012
Do me a favor,
come to our table.

312
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,080
A bunch of my friends
would love to meet you.

313
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,114
- Come on, Alberto.
- I can't.

314
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,717
I'm with the lady.

315
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,244
Let's dance.

316
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:50,071
Mambo. The world turns
around the mambo.

317
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,305
What a mambo.

318
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,918
Oh, boy! What a mambo!

319
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,492
If you wanna be with your friends,
don't mind me.

320
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:46,994
What?

321
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,299
Don't let me keep you
from your friends.

322
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,169
That's enough. Let's go.

323
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,669
Good night, <i>Commendatore.</i>

324
00:32:14,232 --> 00:32:15,700
Get in. Hurry up!

325
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,134
- Did you eat?
- No. Well, a little bit around 8:00.

326
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,475
- Let's get some supper.
- What?

327
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:25,700
Let's have supper.

328
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,403
Good. Where are we going?

329
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:30,705
My house.

330
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,046
Wait! Wait a second!
Hey, Fancy Pants!

331
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,345
I'm talking to you!

332
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:38,879
Look at me!

333
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,788
Look who I'm with!
Up yours!

334
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,023
Know who this is?

335
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:21,627
- Did anyone call?
- Nobody, <i>Commendatore.</i>

336
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,459
- What do you mean nobody?
- Nobody called.

337
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,606
- Were you awake or sleeping?
- Nobody called. I was here.

338
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,797
All right.

339
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,635
Supper for two in my room.

340
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:37,743
If Miss Jessie calls, I'm asleep.
If she insists, I'm asleep.

341
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,474
If she <i>still</i> insists, I'm still asleep!

342
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,787
We'll eat upstairs.
What's your name?

343
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,657
What?

344
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,657
Come on, move.

345
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,974
What? Another dog?

346
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:28,133
Look at these!

347
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,305
You got fish too?

348
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:38,042
Yes.
Now, where did I put it?

349
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,039
- Leave it for the maid.
- But it'll get wrinkled.

350
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,053
Idiot! What made me do it?

351
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,351
Did you ever see an idiot?
Well, you're looking at one.

352
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,154
Just leave it!

353
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,640
Come.

354
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:34,990
What was your name again?

355
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,171
Where are you from?

356
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,231
What?

357
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:48,240
- Where do you come from?
- From Rome. <i>Piazza Risorgimento.</i>

358
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,116
Sit down. You're making me nervous.

359
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,693
You like it?

360
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,671
Kind of.

361
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,300
It's not really my thing.

362
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,475
It's not my taste, but, yes.

363
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,704
Beethoven's Fifth.

364
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,282
I love it.

365
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:31,878
Come in.

366
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:47,065
Leave it there.
I'll take care of it. Go.

367
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,272
And close the door.

368
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,641
Let's see what he brought us.

369
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,080
Caviar, lobster.

370
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,849
Help yourself. Eat.
I'm not in the mood.

371
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:12,859
Help yourself.
I don't know if you like it.

372
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:17,367
1949...

373
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,900
1949...

374
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,771
Take that off.
It's hot in here.

375
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:35,784
Guess I tore it.

376
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,379
Where do you live?

377
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,187
Past the gas station.

378
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,793
- Where?
- On the road to Ostia.

379
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,887
- You come to Via Veneto?
- Via Veneto? Me?

380
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,397
I work the <i>Passeggiata Archeologica.</i>
Much more convenient.

381
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,401
Why?

382
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,162
I'm on the <i>Cilia.</i>
Subway takes me right there.

383
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,500
There's another girl,
my friend Wanda.

384
00:37:56,707 --> 00:38:00,405
She lives there too.
But I don't bother with the others.

385
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,581
The others sleep under the arches
in <i>Caracalla.</i>

386
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:06,511
Mind you, I have my own house...

387
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:10,745
with water, electricity, bottled gas,
every convenience. I got everything.

388
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,923
Even a thermometer.

389
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:15,086
See this one here?

390
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,391
She never, ever
slept under an arch.

391
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,456
Well, maybe once.

392
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,658
Or twice.

393
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,003
Of course, my house is...

394
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,772
nothing like this.

395
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,167
But it's enough for me.
I like it.

396
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,217
Eat. Eat something.

397
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,383
What's wrong?

398
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,288
Damn it! I know who you are!

399
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,564
I know!
Can I say it?

400
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,622
Can I?

401
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,069
Alberto Lazzari! I knew you
right away! I saw all your movies.

402
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:01,761
Very nice!

403
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,603
Which is your favorite?

404
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,436
Well, the last one.

405
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:09,910
You had a costume with all that
stuff, then Vittorio Scraman came...

406
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,612
pushed the door open,
<i>"Fermi tutti!"</i>

407
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,779
Then it was his daughter.

408
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,084
That wasn't me.

409
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,881
What do you mean?

410
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,087
You're as good-looking
as your house.

411
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,831
Bring the glasses here.

412
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,133
- Champagne.
- Sit down.

413
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,239
What's wrong now?

414
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,537
Who's gonna believe this
when I tell 'em?

415
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,439
They already think I'm full of it.

416
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,281
I might not believe it myself
tomorrow.

417
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,251
You have to do me a favor.
Give me a picture...

418
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:29,393
and write, "Cabiria was here
at my house-- Alberto Lazzari."

419
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,294
"Cabiria Ceccarelli was at my
house."

420
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,963
Write it just like that.

421
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:37,762
Now let's eat.

422
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,561
And you eat too.

423
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,096
An olive.

424
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,576
Should I open it?

425
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:51,105
Chicken! Some chicken breast
to chase away the blues.

426
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:53,876
Here's your plate.

427
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,221
If you want to play more
of that music, I'd like it too.

428
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,117
And what's this?

429
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,387
I saw it in a movie once.

430
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,263
<i>- Commendatore.</i>
- Yes, Davide.

431
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,959
<i>- It's</i> Signorina <i>Jessie.</i>
- I said, tell her I'm sleeping.

432
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,092
<i>- She's here.</i>
- What?

433
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,929
<i>- She's downstairs.</i>
- Just don't let her in.

434
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,469
<i>She's already in.
She's coming up.</i>

435
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,371
Idiot!

436
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,612
Alberto, open up.

437
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,647
- Who is it?
- Don't be stupid! Open up!

438
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,850
So? Open up.

439
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,823
It's very important.

440
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,088
One moment.

441
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,866
- The picture!
- Oh, yes. Hurry up!

442
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,798
Alberto, will you open up?

443
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,103
Go in the bathroom a minute.

444
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,438
Yes. I'll get rid of her. Hurry!

445
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,138
I'm not leaving.
I'll stay here all night!

446
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,183
- Quiet, don't move.
- Open up.

447
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,552
Alberto, please open the door.

448
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,017
Open up, you bastard!

449
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,062
What do you want?

450
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,475
What's on your mind?

451
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:31,310
I'm tired.
I have to be up early tomorrow.

452
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,651
I'm working. You know that, right?

453
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,885
I'm thirsty. Give me a drink.

454
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,088
- What?
- I'm thirsty!

455
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,391
Now what?

456
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:50,261
I can't go on this way!

457
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,403
Well, neither can I!

458
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,838
Your jealousy
is morbid, unbearable.

459
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,875
I'm tired of it.
I can't take it any more.

460
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:03,108
Let's call it quits while we're
still friends, okay?

461
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,582
No. That's too easy!
I'm not going anywhere!

462
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,517
Jessie, don't do this.
Get some sleep.

463
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,625
You're tired and
I'm falling apart.

464
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,851
We'll call each other tomorrow.

465
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,216
- I know you've stopped loving me.
- Who told you that?

466
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:43,216
You've stopped loving me.

467
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:46,318
- Admit it.
- I'd never say such a thing.

468
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,618
Admit it, and I'll never
bother you again.

469
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,227
But I'd be lying.

470
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,496
Even if we saw each other
occasionally...

471
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:58,427
every two or three days,
I'd be happy.

472
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,732
Why so seldom?
We could be together much more.

473
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,071
- Every day?
- Yes, every day.

474
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:10,941
But stop being so jealous. Is it my
fault that women always look at me?

475
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,141
But you're ugly!

476
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,945
How do I get outta here?

477
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,103
Hey, Cabiria. Alberto Lazzari's
been lookin' for you!

478
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:57,414
I'm not even talking to you!

479
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,947
- Don't listen to her.
- Who's listening?

480
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:01,642
Hey, Cabiria, there's Limpy.

481
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,320
There's a winner.

482
00:47:04,188 --> 00:47:06,350
Hey, you old lecher!

483
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,489
Homesick for jail?

484
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:13,596
Come on, Cabiria,
let's have a good laugh.

485
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:21,534
Why'd you bring <i>him</i> along?
Guess a weed never dies.

486
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,798
The Madonna might
have mercy on my uncle.

487
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:24,897
What mercy?

488
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:27,945
The pilgrims of the <i>Madonna del
Divino Amore</i> just went by.

489
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,511
I don't believe that stuff.

490
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,611
- Don't you believe in miracles?
- Not me.

491
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,978
Should we go there on Sunday?

492
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,053
We'll all have
something to ask for.

493
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,884
You goin', Cabiria?

494
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,355
Me? I don't know. I'll think about it.
Besides...

495
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,656
what would I ask for?
I've got everything.

496
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,664
I'll even be done
with the mortgage soon.

497
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,996
But I might go anyway.
I haven't said no.

498
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,170
We'll see.

499
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:59,702
Think the Madonna would
waste a miracle on <i>him?</i>

500
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,906
Funny, huh? The Madonna knows
how you made your dough.

501
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,548
Selling coke
and pimping women.

502
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,981
I'm going to see the Madonna...

503
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:11,655
and I know <i>exactly</i>
what I'll ask for.

504
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,553
Don't make fun of stuff like that.

505
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,592
You really want to go?

506
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,367
What'll you ask for?

507
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,602
I'm talking to you.
What'll you ask for?

508
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,573
Hey, you! Shorty!

509
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:43,443
Wanna lift?

510
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:09,432
A shortcut.
He calls this a shortcut.

511
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,340
I've been walking an hour.

512
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,511
Who knows where I am?

513
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:02,257
You live in the caves too?

514
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,489
I've never seen you before.

515
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,995
I've got my own house.

516
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:26,449
Gorgiano! Gorgiano!
It's me. Come up.

517
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,921
How are you doing?

518
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,958
Not so bad, thank you, sir.

519
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:40,061
And where's Pietro?
Sleeping?

520
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,461
They took him to the hospital
two days ago.

521
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,602
Said he was in bad shape.

522
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:50,205
- And, you, what do you need?
- Whatever you want, thanks, sir.

523
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,800
Here's a blanket. Is that all right?

524
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,875
What hospital did they take Pietro to?

525
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:56,979
To the <i>Fratebene fratelli.</i>

526
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:01,083
All right, I'll visit him
if I have time.

527
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,664
Hey, Dark Hair.
Who is that guy?

528
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:25,532
But who is he?
With some charity?

529
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,842
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.

530
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,823
Can I help you?

531
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,189
Going back to Rome later?

532
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,700
Can you give me a lift?

533
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,231
Yes, later.

534
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:07,907
Elsa!

535
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,357
Ah, <i>caro!</i>

536
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:18,354
I was expecting you Saturday,
but you came today!

537
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:22,829
I was just thinking yesterday,
"He comes every nine or ten days.

538
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:27,869
"He came Wednesday,
so he'll show up Saturday!"

539
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:32,202
Bomba! But I know this one!

540
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:35,678
Bomba, you live <i>here?</i>

541
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,905
I wish I had everything I used to.

542
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:43,052
A place in Rome, a place in Ostia.

543
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:47,748
Showered with gifts!
Money in the bank! Jewels! Gold!

544
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,950
I had five <i>kilos</i> of gold!

545
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:53,960
She's not lying, you know.
Now who'd believe it?

546
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,132
But this one in her day--

547
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,268
Here they don't even
make me comb my hair.

548
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,405
But if I wear a low-cut blouse...

549
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:05,405
and the white earrings, then... ha!

550
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,309
Come, come, Elsa. Take this.

551
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,472
Oh! Look at the sweets you brought!

552
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:14,446
And only for me!
None for the others!

553
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,620
Give it to me to hide.

554
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,551
The one with the chocolate!

555
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:24,626
<i>Pignoli!</i> Look at the <i>pignoli!</i>
Like rainfall!

556
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:27,730
Thank you, <i>caro,</i> thank you!

557
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:37,169
And when will you be back?
When?

558
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:44,303
God protect you from evil, my son.

559
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:54,950
Of course...

560
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,660
there's lots of starving people
in Rome, eh?

561
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,197
You drive around at night a lot?

562
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,531
Not as much as needed.

563
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,473
How about during the day?

564
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:24,713
No, in the daytime,
the poor wander about.

565
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:26,616
How would I find them?

566
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:29,951
Go figure.

567
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:35,056
Me, I'm out at night too,
and I've never met you.

568
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,466
But how'd you get the idea...

569
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,695
the idea of doing this job?

570
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:45,808
I don't even know myself.
Like that. Little by little.

571
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:53,239
We're here. There's your tram.

572
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,017
Do you live far from here?

573
00:56:04,227 --> 00:56:07,220
About 19 kilometers,
on the way to Ostia.

574
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,425
What's your name?

575
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,335
Maria Ceccarelli.

576
00:56:13,603 --> 00:56:14,866
Are you alone?

577
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,604
My father and mother
died when I was little.

578
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:20,539
I came to Rome later.

579
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,444
Now go and get some sleep.

580
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:43,063
So I--

581
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,964
<i>Arrivederci.</i>
Go ahead, tell me.

582
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,272
Thank you.
Thank you for everything.

583
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,858
Don Vincenzo,
the group from Rieti is here.

584
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:38,451
Get your prickly pears!
Fresh prickly pears!

585
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,385
Gimme a hand, Maurizio.

586
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,337
Wanda, get a load of this crowd!

587
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,216
There's the candle guy.
Come on, Uncle.

588
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,329
How much for the candles?

589
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,864
Take your pick.
I got some for 50, 100, 150.

590
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,695
The biggest you got.

591
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,336
We'll take two each.

592
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:30,234
Wanda, the candles! Over here!

593
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,738
Are these all right?

594
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:35,006
I just want one. I'll pay for it myself.
Maybe I'll pay you later.

595
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,907
No, I'll pay for them all.

596
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:41,645
- What'll I do with it now?
- Stupid!

597
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,248
How much altogether?
