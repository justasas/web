1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:07,010
Your brother was killed by Pinkett
and Bourne,

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,090
but they died in a car bomb.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,290
The moment I'd got back with
Lizzie, I was ripped away from her.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,770
Rosa's not just my girlfriend,
she's my soul mate, my companion.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,890
You knew that if you stayed in
Bracknell, you risked not

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,810
'only your own lives, but the lives
of your families and loved ones.'

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,970
My mum's ill and Janice,
our neighbour,

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,570
says she doesn't think she's going
to make it till Christmas.

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,970
Let's go home, Phil.

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,490
Can you help us get documents to
get back to Britain?

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,050
~ I don't do that stuff.
~ Well, can you tell us who does?

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,540
Carlos Espinosa.

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,090
I'm arresting you for intent to
traffic cocaine

14
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,930
under section 841 of the Controlled
Substance Act.

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,810
Two white boys, just like y'all,

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,690
got transferred out last
night for their own safety.

17
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,970
I thought most people put up
pictures of boobs.

18
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,290
Who gets off on mathematical
equations?

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,290
There's a reward for any information

20
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,250
that leads to Espinosa's
whereabouts.

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,210
Mr Espinosa thought maybe you could
do him a little favour.

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,850
I killed his only son and ten of
his other men,

23
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,370
took down his biggest ever trade,

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,330
buried it somewhere so secret, so
remote, that only I will ever know.

25
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,090
Yah!

26
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,900
He said he's got the money locked
away and his eye is the key.

27
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,420
The moment we have it,
you're on your way.

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,330
We were told to give you guys these.

29
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,050
Oh, OK, and what about the eye?

30
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,500
Where's Carlos?

31
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,540
Who the hell is Carlos?

32
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,690
Did you bring them?

33
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,570
(The you-know-what's?)

34
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,370
Are you definitely all right
to have them?

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,890
(Yeah, yeah, it's fine, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.)

36
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,370
(Then why are we whispering?)

37
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,180
(They're just a bit funny about what
I eat in here.)

38
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,290
Quick, quick, quick, clever girl,
clever girl. Clever girl.

39
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,460
(Oh, that was close.)

40
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,530
So how are you feeling?

41
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,370
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,210
Hm, but you look tired.

43
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,410
I'm fine.

44
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,250
I'm just working late a lot on this.

45
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,290
I don't see how they can keep
ignoring us.

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,170
None of the evidence has been
released.

47
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,810
We never saw the bodies.

48
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,810
A full inquiry is the only way...

49
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,250
It won't bring him back, you know.

50
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,740
I know. I just...

51
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,210
.. want the truth.

52
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,530
I want my boy back.

53
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,010
Same way I want my husband back.

54
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,940
And I don't think an inquiry is
going to do that.

55
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,730
They've gone, Lizzie.

56
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,860
It's time to let go.

57
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,700
(But these help a little bit.)

58
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,940
OK.

59
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,210
Linda! How many times?

60
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,180
You're not allowed Wagon Wheels!

61
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,250
Let me introduce you to the last

62
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,530
and most important members of
our team,

63
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,530
Jeremy Gardner and Mitch Steele.

64
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,570
Who's who?

65
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,530
I'm Mitch Steele, Mitch
Steele, Jeremy.

66
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,970
Jeremy Gardner. Jez.

67
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,970
Have you any idea how hard it
was to find you guys?

68
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,210
You've been transferred to

69
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,370
three different prisons in the last
eight months.

70
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,010
~ I'm sorry.
~ I know, it's a nightmare.

71
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,570
Just when we get settled somewhere,

72
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,170
we've got to pack up all our stuff
and...

73
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,290
Not that we've got any stuff as such

74
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,730
cos we're prisoners so...

75
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,530
~ it's fine.
~ Are you joking with me?

76
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,210
These are the guys we waited three
weeks to break out?

77
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,050
Mitch and Jeremy are the best.

78
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,650
None of us can do what they do.

79
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,010
~ Thanks. ~ What these two don't know
about deadly chemical compounds

80
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,610
is not worth knowing.

81
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,610
And you've handled VX before?

82
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,970
Hm.

83
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,970
~ Big time.
~ What bombs have you made?

84
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,210
Well, you name it.

85
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,210
No, you name it.

86
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,890
We spent a lot of money to get you
here.

87
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,810
I want to know that you are the
people we need.

88
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,050
Oh, erm...

89
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,820
Car bombs.

90
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,300
Time bombs.

91
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,050
Time bombs that we've put in cars.

92
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,380
Car time bombs.

93
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,090
Erm...

94
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,890
Jager bombs,

95
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,810
running bombs

96
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,650
and once we put a whole tube
of Mentos in

97
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,610
a three litre bottle of Coke and,
you know, that, that...

98
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,580
It really did go absolutely
everywhere.

99
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,260
Maya, relax, he's messing with you.

100
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,570
Yes, I am.

101
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,610
These guys developed the first
tunnel bombs.

102
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,970
They created untraceable PETN.

103
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,370
Bolsheokhtinsky Bridge, Soldovka
Hospital, Victoria Airport,

104
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,170
all thanks to these guys.

105
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,570
So don't insult them with your
stupid questions, right.

106
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,930
~ I'm sorry.
~ It's fine, really.

107
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,450
She didn't mean to offend you.

108
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,210
It's cool, just let's not let it
happen again, yeah?

109
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,730
Khalil.

110
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,330
~ I'm the money.
~ Mitch Steele.

111
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,170
~ Maya.
~ Mitch Steele.

112
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,130
~ Jamie.
~ Mitch Steele.

113
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,410
Jamie? Really?

114
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,850
Yeah. Why do you ask?

115
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,780
Just... You don't look like a Jamie.

116
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,890
OK.

117
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,090
And I'm Reza.

118
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,010
Razor? Is that because you're bald?
Is that why you're called Razor?

119
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,450
No. It's just that's my real name.

120
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,090
Razor can be a first name.

121
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,170
Razor Ruddock.

122
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,980
OK, let's tool-up.

123
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,570
Tools.

124
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,340
Three of our guys saw it happen.
Cross is dead.

125
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,050
And the eye?

126
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,770
Yeah, that's the bad news.

127
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,170
They took it.

128
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,770
The two, Tweedle-dum and
Tweedle-dumber?

129
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,970
~ Yeah.
~ You're kidding.

130
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,970
No, I'm not.

131
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,170
Well, get it back.

132
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,170
Tell our guys to pound it
out of them.

133
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,850
No, they're not...
They, er, escaped.

134
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,410
They were busted out during
the riot. Not by us.

135
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,690
Who busted them out?

136
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,930
I... don't know.

137
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,660
Well, you do know where
they are going, so go find them.

138
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,290
Now?

139
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,740
Vete.

140
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,050
'So glad no-one's asked about
the eye.'

141
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,330
Because after a long flight it takes
a while to get things moving.

142
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,530
They're not going to ask about
the eye!

143
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,490
They don't even know who Carlos is.

144
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,850
They think we're Mitch and Jeremy!

145
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,620
Well, then what the hell are Mitch
and Jeremy doing here?

146
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,420
The equations on the wall.

147
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,730
The guys in the cell before us,
that's who Mitch and Jeremy are.

148
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,530
That's why they're here. We're here.

149
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,090
Wherever "here" is.

150
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,330
This was not easy to find.

151
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,420
I hope it is satisfactory.

152
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,900
Yeah.

153
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,410
Yeah, this is good.

154
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,530
Good. We got your message.

155
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,490
We are aware that this will only
keep the compound at a stable

156
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,250
temperature for 24 hours or so.

157
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,450
So we've set up a lab here for you
to make the bomb immediately,

158
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,930
before we go to meet the buyer.

159
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,490
OK. And our buyer is?

160
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,490
I find it is better not to ask
too many questions.

161
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,770
Remember, we are
just the middleman here.

162
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,810
Khalil negotiates the price
and we simply...

163
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,010
Go shopping.

164
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,410
Exactly.

165
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,210
We have nothing whatsoever to do
with

166
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,370
blowing up a school or whatever.

167
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,010
Yeah, that's my conscience
in the clear. Thank you.

168
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,090
Beretta, semi-automatic.

169
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,170
Nothing too fancy, you OK with that?

170
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,530
Yes!

171
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,370
Oh, that is so cool.

172
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,490
And obviously really normal for us,
given what we do.

173
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,810
And what about a grenade?
Am I allowed a grenade?

174
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,370
You won't need grenades.

175
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,570
OK. Well, what about, like you see
over there, like a...

176
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,970
I'd love like a belt of bullets.

177
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,290
Those bullets are too big for
that gun.

178
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,050
Right, I would still like one,
though.

179
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,250
Get your haz-mat suits on. We are
leaving for Kocevje in 15.

180
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,170
OK.

181
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,060
Sorry, is that the Kocevje in...

182
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,850
.. Germany?

183
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,610
Slovenia.

184
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,220
Slovenia, right. Just testing.

185
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,050
Oh, this is a nightmare.

186
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,250
Yeah. Which one's Slovenia?

187
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,010
Well, it's Slovenia.

188
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,450
It's near Italy, I think.

189
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,290
Well, that's great. I mean, they've
brought us to Europe at least.

190
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,050
Yeah, to make a bomb.

191
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,010
I don't want to make a dirty great
dirty bomb

192
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,130
for a bunch of terrorists, Phil.

193
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,290
For one thing, I can't.

194
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,090
Hm.

195
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,930
I think I actually could, but, yeah,
point taken, it's not ideal.

196
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,010
We need to get out of here.

197
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,330
Well, that's what I'm saying.

198
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,490
We get to Slovenia and then,
you know, sneak off.

199
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,130
"Sneak off"?

200
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,170
This isn't a school field trip!

201
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,450
I suspect we won't get an hour to
ourselves in the gift shop.

202
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,620
It's now or never.

203
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,010
OK, I'll fly, you navigate.

204
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,970
What? You can't fly this thing!

205
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,330
I'll have you know I have over
a thousand hours of

206
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,930
flight simulator experience.

207
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,530
~ What on?
~ The F19 Stealth Fighter.

208
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,930
On the Amiga?

209
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,330
Correct.

210
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,690
Right. Well, even if that was
technically realistic,

211
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,610
it's over 20 years out of date.

212
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,690
OK, you fly, I'll navigate.

213
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,770
I'm not arguing about which
one of us should fly,

214
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,450
I'm saying no-one should fly!

215
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,180
We need to run. We need to run now.

216
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,490
Where are you going?

217
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,650
Where are you going?

218
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,210
OK, calm down.

219
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,690
We get you out of prison
and this is how you repay us?

220
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,330
No, you don't understand, we were...

221
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,690
I'm not Mitch Steele!

222
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,970
We're not chemical experts.

223
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,570
We're just a couple of guys in a band

224
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,370
on our way to England to
play some shows.

225
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,450
What? No, we're not!

226
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,370
No, we work for a trucking
company in Texas.

227
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,610
No, we work for the council,
or we used to.

228
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,130
I, I don't work for the council,
I just work in the building.

229
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,370
I'm sub-contracted.

230
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,970
Lie to me again and I'll shoot you!

231
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,090
We're not lying!

232
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,050
All of those things are true!

233
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,570
Who are you?

234
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,930
I'm Sam Pinkett.
This is Philip Bourne.

235
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,170
We're just a couple of ordinary
guys from Bracknell.

236
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,330
It's in Berkshire...

237
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,530
~ We were not meant to be here.
~ .. near Reading.

238
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,570
We were stitched-up by a drug
sort of lord...

239
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,970
We're just trying to get home.

240
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,290
We were flown here...

241
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,370
My mum's really ill.

242
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,610
OK, that's enough, shut up!

243
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,740
Please don't hurt us.

244
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,170
Right, OK.

245
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,580
Listen to me.

246
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:40,050
I'm with the DCRI.

247
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,570
Is that the lifeboats one?

248
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,330
French Intelligence.

249
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,850
You're undercover?

250
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,820
~ Wicked!
~ Oh, thank God!

251
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,530
I have been part of this group for
the last five years.

252
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,930
Everything has been leading up
to this mission.

253
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,930
Now once they're in possession
of the VX-O5, I can take them down.

254
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,810
But we can't make bombs though.

255
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,930
You won't need to.

256
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,850
As soon as you give them the
chemical agent,

257
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,620
DCRI will take the building
and arrest them.

258
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,690
~ Look, you want to get home, right?
~ Yes.

259
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,370
I'll get you home.
I'll see to it personally,

260
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,730
but first you have to be Mitch
and Jeremy for another 12 hours.

261
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,050
And that's it, you're done.

262
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,140
You can go home.

263
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,450
You got any change?

264
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,540
What?

265
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,370
Oh, I think I left all my euros
in our prison cell back in Texas.

266
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,530
I need to eat something. My tummy
is playing havoc.

267
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,970
We all have to take one of these.

268
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,140
We need to be on exactly
the same time.

269
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,610
Right, Jamie, once we're in,
you'll need to take out the guard

270
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,210
outside the VX lab, before he sets
off the alarm.

271
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,530
You'll only have one chance.

272
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,450
That's one more than I need.

273
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,090
What, so you don't need any chances,
how does that work?

274
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,290
Would you like to find out?

275
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,770
No, I'm just saying, if he'd have
said you had two chances,

276
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,090
then you could say that's one
more than I need.

277
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,090
It's not a big deal, it just doesn't
make sense.

278
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,250
Shall we move on?

279
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,090
Once I have hacked through the
firewall,

280
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,610
I should have control of the lifts

281
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,410
by the time you have retrieved the
VX-O5.

282
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,060
Gentlemen, what exactly can
we expect once we're inside the lab?

283
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,780
Ahem.

284
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,690
Test tubes, Bunsen burners,

285
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,250
tripods, pipettes, etc.

286
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,090
It's a very hazardous environment,

287
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,890
so it's really important that we all
wear safety goggles.

288
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,090
You think this is funny?

289
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,690
Do you think this is a joke?

290
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,450
Because I'd love to see how you guys
handle dangerous chemical

291
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,450
materials with all your experience!

292
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,810
Yeah, that's right,
cos we're the experts.

293
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,410
We're the ones putting our goddamn
lives on the line.

294
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,610
Not you or you, me.

295
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,380
And my man Sam. I mean
Terry. I mean Jeremy.

296
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,970
He's right.

297
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,570
The VX-O5 can kill anything within
a mile radius of it.

298
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,020
I don't want amateurs handling it,
do you?

299
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,500
No. So how about a bit of respect,
yeah?

300
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,780
Let him finish.

301
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,690
That was it really.

302
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,780
Just...

303
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,170
~ .. be safe. ~ Cool.

304
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,770
Great briefing. All right, Mitch
Steele out.

305
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,370
I haven't finished, actually.

306
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,250
Sure, go ahead.

307
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,130
The helicopter will land and drop us
onto the roof at exactly 3am.

308
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,250
What?

309
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,010
That's when all the security
footage from the previous week

310
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,850
is backed-up and the cards are
reset.

311
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,490
We then have exactly four minutes
before the cameras go live.

312
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,450
Four minutes to get onto the roof

313
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,010
and then abseil down to the sixth
floor.

314
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,250
Ah, now that sounds a bit...

315
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,770
A second more and it's all blown.

316
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,930
And you can say goodbye to your
share of the 45 million.

317
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,210
Just...

318
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,530
Sorry, to go back to the abseiling
thing,

319
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,650
I'm not perfect with heights.

320
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,380
You two pussies are getting
in a different way.

321
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,570
Maya has already hacked into office
services and created

322
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,540
an order for two vending machines to
be delivered to the sixth floor.

323
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,570
But because the VX lab has

324
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,330
the highest level security
clearance,

325
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,130
the machines will be
unloaded by separate staff

326
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,740
upstairs and positioned in
the secure zone.

327
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,810
You will have to wait inside
those machines

328
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,740
for approximately seven hours.

329
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,130
The lab closes at 11,

330
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,020
but we arrive four hours later,
when there is only one guard.

331
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,450
Phil?

332
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,770
Yeah?

333
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,140
What time have you got?

334
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,970
3.03.

335
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,220
Yeah, me too.

336
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,090
Do you think they made it?

337
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,180
Don't know.

338
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,930
I mean, why does this shit
always happen to us?

339
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,170
What shit?

340
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,890
What do you mean, what shit? This.

341
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,980
Being made to retrieve chemicals for
terrorists!

342
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,770
Right.

343
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,780
Yeah, I mean that has only
happened once, to be fair.

344
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,060
And anyway, maybe it's not shit
happening to us.

345
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,380
Maybe it's us happening to shit.

346
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,290
What does that mean?

347
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,450
It means we're going to find a way
out of this, Sam.

348
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,410
We're not just going to roll over
and do as we're told.

349
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,860
We're not machines.

350
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,930
Oh, my...!

351
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,180
They're here.

352
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,490
What are you taking?

353
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,930
Money. You?

354
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,090
Snacks.

355
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,890
Hmm, useful.

356
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,450
Oh, has yours got drinks?

357
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,940
Sweet!

358
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,090
What happened?

359
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,610
Glass. Don't worry, I'll patch
him up.

360
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,020
Quickly!

361
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,970
Well, what are you waiting for?
Get in there.

362
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,860
~ Careful.
~ OK, yes, obviously.

363
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,890
Remember, don't touch the glass.

364
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,970
It's highly unstable.

365
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,410
Only touch the metal part.

366
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,210
I know, he literally just said that.

367
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,570
I know, just... It's worth
repeating, isn't it?

368
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,650
How long, Maya?

369
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,210
One minute.

370
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,970
Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly,
slowly.

371
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,330
OK, you got it?

372
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,420
OK.

373
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,980
I'm in. The lifts are secure!

374
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,290
Argh!

375
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,610
Oh, you caught it.

376
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,570
~ I did!
~ You bloody caught it!

377
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,650
Yeah, I did.

378
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,690
I mean, that was the best and worst
moment of my entire life!

379
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,730
Well done.

380
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,490
I'm so sorry. I didn't realise.

381
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,250
It's all good.

382
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,730
Don't you worry, we're all over
this.

383
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,300
Anyone fancy a mint? A chewy?

384
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,860
Reza?

385
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,370
Reza!

386
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,610
I thought you said you were
going to arrest them.

387
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,810
Change of plan.

388
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,690
Right, so where are the
French Secret Service guys?

389
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,370
Are they... poised?

390
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,220
Oh, well, I hope not, because that
was just a story.

391
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,770
Well, what are you going
to do with it?

392
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,330
I'm going to sell it.

393
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,410
We've already got a buyer.

394
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,290
The difference is now I won't have
to split it four ways.

395
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,610
Best Christmas ever.

396
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,060
That is not what Christmas is about!

397
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,330
But we can't make this into a bomb.

398
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,290
You know what? That is annoying.

399
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,330
It's knocked the price down a bit,
but still.

400
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,530
Now, just er, put it in there now.

401
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,890
~ Drop the gun!
~ Yes, Phil!

402
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,650
Ha, you forgot I had this,
didn't you?

403
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,850
It isn't loaded.

404
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,890
Oh, really?

405
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,970
Who gave it to you?

406
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,100
You did.

407
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,890
Stop or I'll drop it.

408
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,170
You wouldn't.

409
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,970
Well, we did nearly drop it once
already, so...

410
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,330
If you shoot me,
I'll definitely drop it.

411
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,100
All right, I'll shoot him, then.

412
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,300
Now just put it in the case.

413
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,770
Now!

414
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,860
Stay back.

415
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,770
There's no other way out of this.

416
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,450
OK, OK, OK, OK.

417
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,650
We'll give it to you.

418
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,250
~ What? No, we won't.
~ Listen to him.

419
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,850
He's right, Sam.

420
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,380
It's the only way.

421
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,820
Argh!

422
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,300
Whoa!

423
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,340
'Doors closing.'

424
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,380
'Ground floor.'

425
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,050
Hey!

426
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,180
What are you doing?

427
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,410
How do you think this ends?

428
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,460
Sam!

429
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,650
I think we've got enough to
get to France,

430
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,330
but then how do we pay for
the ferry?

431
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,050
We can't afford to do both.

432
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,620
Tickets, please.

433
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,780
Tickets.

434
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,210
~ They'll check in here.
~ No, they won't.

435
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,970
I used to do this all the time
on the Bracknell to Wokingham train.

436
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,770
They'll know we're not using it,
though.

437
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,330
Not if we make the right noises.

438
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,330
And anyway, I think
I might actually need to go.

439
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,450
Can you turn around?

440
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,850
What do you mean, turn around?

441
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,050
I've been needing to go
since before the, you know,

442
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,130
heist.

443
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,490
Hang on, you don't mean...

444
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,890
I'm sat down, Sam, my body's making
the decision for me.

445
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,250
Stand up, then!

446
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,860
I can't. I've basically gone into
safe mode.

447
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,210
Tickets?

448
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,220
Oh! Oh!

449
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,460
Oh, God!

450
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,850
'Thanks for calling the Texas
Department of Corrections.

451
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,930
'One of our operators will be
with you shortly.

452
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,210
'Please note, this holiday season

453
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,330
'our visiting hours are Monday
to Friday, 8...'

454
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,930
Thank you, ma'am.

455
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:11,180
Hi. When is your next flight to
London?

456
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,500
~ Where have you been?
~ Trying to clean this.

457
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,210
What are we going to do with this?

458
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,370
They said it's only good for
24 hours, didn't they?

459
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,650
We'll just stick it in the bin.

460
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,210
It's not a best before date.

461
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,130
They meant after 24 hours this
becomes really dangerous.

462
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,570
We need to get it to an expert.

463
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,980
There's something written on this.

464
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,570
~ There.
~ What?

465
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,370
Look. Turn it back round.

466
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,050
That's it, look, there, there,
there, there, look.

467
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,140
Oh, yeah.

468
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,690
It's like it's some sort of code.

469
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,100
I know what that is.

470
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,250
I think it's map co-ordinates.

471
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,930
It must be where Nathan hid
the money.

472
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,100
God, we could do with some of
that now.

473
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,940
Right, you hold this,
I'll write it down.

474
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,850
It's clean.

475
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,010
It's fairly clean.

476
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,180
How about I write it down? Yeah?

477
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,930
Borrow me a euro?

478
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,210
We need it all for the ferry.

479
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,290
Just one euro, please.

480
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,580
What for?

481
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,460
Hello, ICU?

482
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,500
No, sorry, she's about to go into
theatre.

483
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,130
Yes.

484
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,170
Yes, Linda Bourne.

485
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,970
Well, when will she be out of
surgery?

486
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,450
What do you mean, you don't know?

487
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,810
No, because I need to know...

488
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,090
No, no, but I am. I'm her...

489
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,770
Please.

490
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,300
I just... Please.

491
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,850
Come on.

492
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,980
I think we've got enough to get
home.

493
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,220
Two tickets to Dover, please.

494
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,130
OK. You don't have any notes?

495
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,650
No, sorry. It is all there, though.

496
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,690
80 euros?

497
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,250
The next ferry is
leaving in 35 minutes.

498
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,850
~ Great, thank you.
~ Hey, Sam, look. There's a bra museum.

499
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,170
It is the lace and fashion museum.

500
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,650
~ Yeah, of course it is.
~ You have your passports?

501
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,250
Oh, no. I thought, in Europe,

502
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,210
can't you just move around?

503
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,970
For the UK you need to have
a passport.

504
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,010
No, but the UK is a soft touch,
famously.

505
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,610
Anyone can get in there.

506
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,420
I am sorry. They will not let
you on the ferry without a passport.

507
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,170
I think it's doable.

508
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,410
Yes, for other people.

509
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,970
It's only a width.
It's not even a length.

510
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,130
I'm telling you, there is
no way

511
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,780
we could swim the English Channel
in December.

512
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,060
Man's greatest obstacle is his mind,
Sam.

513
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,050
What the brain believes,

514
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,860
the body achieves.

515
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,300
I'll see you in Bracknell.

516
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,660
Argh!

517
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,700
Argh, argh!

518
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,020
Argh!

519
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,420
Argh!

520
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,460
Argh!

521
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,250
Argh!

522
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,700
Argh, argh!

523
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,370
It's actually a bit nippy.

524
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,780
Is it?

525
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,700
Oh. Oh, now.

526
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,810
Pardon messieurs! Nous sommes
fermes. We are closed.

527
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,490
Does this thing work?

528
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,010
Bien sur, but it is off-season.

529
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,890
Oh, come on, it's a lovely day for
flying.

530
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,300
I am sorry, no today.

531
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,330
Yes, today.

532
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,490
Yesterday?

533
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,330
Je ne comprends pas!

534
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:42,370
No, I mean, "Yes, today".

535
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,650
Let me spell this out for you
in plain French,

536
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,210
Angleterre, baby, maintenant!

537
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,850
You want me to fly to England?

538
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,570
No shit, Poirot!

539
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,450
We cannot just fly to England and
land this plane.

540
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,620
Who said anything about landing?

541
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,900
Argh!

542
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,170
Now, I'm going to put this away now,
OK?

543
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,530
But don't do anything stupid.
All right?

544
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,660
OK.

545
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,010
This is it, Sam.

546
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,130
Phil, I've changed my mind!
I don't want to jump!

547
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,370
What are you talking about?

548
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,410
This was your idea and it was a
bloody good one!

549
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,450
Now, come on!

550
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,730
Just no, it's really high.

551
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,290
Of course it's really high!

552
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,370
I don't want to jump out of a plane!

553
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,050
But Sam, Sam, listen to me, OK?

554
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,970
Look, down there, that's England.

555
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,610
Right?

556
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,290
It's home.

557
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,690
Now these guys, they might be French,

558
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,730
but they know what they're doing.

559
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,570
So you've got to jump. Please.

560
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,250
And for me,

561
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,330
for my mum,

562
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,580
for Lizzie.

563
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,020
Yeah?

564
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,860
Let's roll!

565
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,980
OK, ready? Let's go!

566
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,860
This is actually really wonderful.

567
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,050
Whoo! Woo-hoo-hoo!

568
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,530
Ha-ha!

569
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,130
Oh, my God, we did it, Sam,
we did it!

570
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,770
No, don't move, nobody move.

571
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,100
Just unclip me slowly.

572
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,420
OK. OK.

573
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,610
Whoa!

574
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,450
Oh, no, no, no, no.

575
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,090
This isn't loaded.

576
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,130
You can have that.

577
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,770
We're the good guys.

578
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,380
All right. See you later.

579
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,530
Hey, how do we get home from here?

580
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,220
If you really want to get home,
you'll find a way.

581
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,490
Shall we stop and take this off and
then we can...?

582
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,980
~ Yeah. ~ Yeah? How does this...?

583
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,380
'Keep your thumb up.'

584
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,650
'Try to look friendly.'

585
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,730
Oi!

586
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,980
No-one's going to stop if we look
weird.

587
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,090
No-one picks up hitchhikers any
more.

588
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,850
Of course they do. They have to.

589
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,090
If Mum's gone in for surgery,

590
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,050
it's either endocarditis or
atherosclerosis.

591
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,890
How do you know so much about it?

592
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,930
Rosa thought I was a heart surgeon,
didn't she?

593
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,330
She started asking questions.
I had to do some research.

594
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,850
Either way, it's serious and I want
to be there when she wakes up,

595
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,730
if she wakes up.

596
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,010
We're not taking a chemical weapon
to visit your mum in hospital.

597
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,530
But that's what all this was about -
getting there, going home.

598
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:58,450
But what's the point in getting home
if we can't have our lives back?

599
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,690
I've got an idea.

600
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,420
I think we can use this.

601
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,650
Hold on, Sam, I think he's stopping.

602
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,930
Yes, thank you! Thank you so much!

603
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,620
Dickheads!

604
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,210
This is useless.

605
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,650
You were right, no-one stops for
hitchhikers.

606
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,530
We're never going to get there
in time.

607
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,010
We might as well still be in Texas!

608
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,930
What are you saying? This isn't like
you.

609
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,290
I'm just being realistic.

610
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,330
Well, stop it, it doesn't suit you.

611
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,540
You're meant to...

612
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,290
I know I treat you like an idiot,

613
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,930
and to be fair, you do say some
ridiculous stuff...

614
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,690
Like what?

615
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,610
You can't out-run a gazelle.

616
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,930
Not in a sprint,

617
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:46,530
but in a marathon, in wintry
conditions, yes, I could.

618
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,650
And you haven't taught yourself
Cantonese.

619
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,450
Once you've mastered Japanese
culture,

620
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,250
Cantonese is a walk in the park,
Sam, a walk in the "ping pang tow".

621
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,810
And there's no way you could have
flown that cargo plane.

622
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,050
I could have got it in the air.

623
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,890
~ I doubt it.
~ I think I could.

624
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,210
Maybe.

625
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,620
The point is, I'd never have left
Texas without you...

626
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,060
.. and we'd both be dead if it wasn't
for your forklift driving licence.

627
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,180
You were right about our fate.

628
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,570
It's up to us what it is.

629
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,770
What are you... Sam?

630
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,500
Sam!

631
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,170
Thanks for stopping.

632
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,610
Didn't have much choice.

633
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,650
Sorry about that, we were
getting desperate.

634
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,210
So where are you boys headed?

635
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,650
Bracknell.

636
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,770
If it's on your way.

637
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,730
No problem at all.
I'm Bob, by the way.

638
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,420
Hi, Bob. My name's...

639
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,490
.. Sam.

640
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,610
And this is Phil.

641
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,450
Whoa! No, no, no, don't touch that!

642
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,530
You mustn't touch that.

643
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,300
What? It's just my tea.

644
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,970

yours.

It was me.

I was miserable and I blamed
everything on this place.

672
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,300
I thought it was a trap.

673
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,900
I used to say I was going to move to
London to do something with my life.

674
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,460
It wasn't a trap.

675
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,700
It was just an excuse not to try.

You?

681
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,930
I think I'm going to join up.

682
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,090
To the Army?

683
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,010
SAS.

684
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,810
It's becoming increasingly clear

685
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,890
that I have the necessary requisites
to be a phenomenal spy.

686

When I caught the VX.

690
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,130
Or when I got shot.

691
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,690
Exactly. You got shot.

00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,140
'southbound on the A329...'

709
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:46,850
I have to admit I was surprised to
hear from you.

710
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,290
The last I heard you were in prison
in Texas for running drugs.

711
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:53,490
I can't imagine how you made it
all the way here. I'm impressed.

712
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,010
~ Yeah. ~ Thank you.

713
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,090
It's pretty amazing.

714
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,290
But you can't stay.

715
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,810
Why?

716
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,050
We can't keep you safe.

717
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,770
We don't know who put the bomb
under your car.

718
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,970
Right, but I think if we work
together on this, we could solve it.

719
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,250
We're not going to sit
discussing your theories.

720
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,370
You can't be here.
That's the bottom line.

721
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,250
We're actually in
the middle of a crisis

722
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,410
that needs my attention more than
you do, so...

723
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,970
Would that have anything to do with
the theft of

724
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,740
VX-O5 nerve agent from a secret
chemical facility in Kocevje?

725
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,730
'Forgive me, it's a complicated
story.'

726
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,810
Khalil's gang bust you out of prison
because they thought you were?

727
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,490
These expert bomb-makers.

728
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,170
And you got away using sweets in
a cola bottle?

729
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,970
Yeah, a Mentos bomb. I'm surprised
you've never heard of it.

730
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,060
OK.

731
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,540
Let's see it.

732
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,820
Here it is.

733
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,210
What's that?

734
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,770
The VX-O5.

735
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,340
It's got "Bob" written on it.

736
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,530
Why did you steal his Thermos?

737
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,540
I thought you'd forgotten it,
so I just picked it up.

738
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,570
Tea anyone?

739
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,810
We're running out of time, give me
the VX-O5 so we can make it safe.

740
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,610
We want our lives back.

741
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,450
We can't just bring you back to
life.

742
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,810
Whoever tried to kill you,
before long they'll find out

743
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,650
and they'll try again and we can't
guarantee we'll stop them.

744
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,810
Why not?

745
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,210
Because we can't.

746
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,410
Why not?

747
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:34,450
This is what you told us before.

748
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,620
I don't think you even wanted to
try.

749
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,540
You lied to us. Admit it.

750
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,610
We've lost the suspect on the
High Street.

751
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,650
You sold us out.

752
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:48,810
You killed us because it was easier
than trying to help us.

753
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,650
Phil's mum is in hospital,
alone, at Christmas.

754
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,770
My girlfriend is wasting her life
trying to find out what

755
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,300
you're covering up.

756
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,650
Mummy, Mummy, my teddy!

757
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,810
This wasn't the only way.

758
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,260
Oi! What do you think you're doing
stealing a child's toy?

759
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,580
It's Khalil.

760
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,140
Oi, oi! Get your own teddy, mate!

761
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,290
OK, stop, stop!

762
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,730
He's obviously tracking you somehow,
we need to split up.

763
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,930
Give me the VX.

764
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,210
Not until you promise.

765
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,570
Thousands of people could die here!
This is not the time!

766
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,930
I say it is the time.

767
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,610
OK.

768
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,410
Look, you're right.

769
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,570
We could have put you under
surveillance

770
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:51,130
and maybe we would have got them
before they got you,

771
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,330
but in the meantime, there
are terrorist cells,

772
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,970
foreign spies, people stealing
chemical weapons!

773
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,250
Serious issues of national security.

774
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,130
And when all is said and done,
I'm sorry.

775
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,690
I really am.

776
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,460
You were not worth the cost.

777
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,690
Now, he is tracking you.

778
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,090
You've got to keep moving.

779
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,580
I'll call for backup.
Give me the VX.

780
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,140
Sorry, sorry.

781
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,140
Bloody hell!

782
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,770
Get me a perimeter.
I want eyes everywhere.

783
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,610
I've sent through an ID on the
suspect,

784
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,850
'but if you see Pinkett and Bourne,
he won't be far behind.

785
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,060
'Oh, and get the MOD to send
a chemical team yesterday.'

786
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,500
Eyes on the suspect.

787
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,180
Hey.

788
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,490
What is that?

789
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,730
It's an LED head torch.

790
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,130
I got 15, so that's pretty much
everyone covered, I reckon.

791
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,130
Who wants one of those for
Christmas?

792
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,210
Who wouldn't want one of these?
It's useful.

793
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:31,610
If you're going pot-holing.

794
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,090
Well, what about the travel scales
I bought you last year?

795
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,490
You were delighted with those.

796
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,890
I was pretending.

797
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,130
I'm trying my best here!

798
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:40,170
You are terrible at buying
Christmas presents!

799
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,450
Yeah, well, you're terrible at sex!

800
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,890
~ What?
~ Sam?

801
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,490
What did you just say?

802
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,530
~ Sam?
~ What did you just say?

803
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,130
~ Sh, sh.
~ What did you just say?

804
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,930
~ Kerry, it's Sam!
~ No, what did you just say?

805
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,090
~ Sh.
~ Guys, you've got to...

806
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,810
One second, Sam,
what did you just say?

807
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,850
I can't believe my eyes.

808
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,650
~ What did you just say?
~ He's coming. Oh, God.

809
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,890
~ What did you just say?
~ Come on.

810
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,420
What did you just say?

811
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,130
I'm so sorry.

812
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,780
I know what you're NOT getting for
Christmas!

813
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,290
Where is he?

814
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,170
He's heading north.

815
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,140
Nobody fire. All agents to the
north end.

816
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,740
Stay where you are!

817
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,020
And get your hands up.

818
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,300
Stay where you are,
please. Stay calm.

819
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,820
Who do I have to arrest around here
to get a cup of tea?

820
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,380
Keep your hands in the air.

821
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,820
Come on, let's go.

822
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,780
Where are Pinkett and Bourne?

823
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,370
Let's get to the hospital.

824
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,300
Who fired that shot?

825
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,330
Who is that?

826
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,020
I don't know, just run!

827
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,980
Oh, shit!

828
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,290
Wait, how are you going to...?

829
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,570
We're splitting up.

830
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,130
He can only go after one of us.

831
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,410
You go to your mum.

832
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,210
That's what this has all been about.

833
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,490
Yeah, but I'm not going to...

834
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,770
Just go.

835
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,100
I recognise you.

836
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,300
You killed my brother.

837
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,210
No, he...

838
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,650
He crashed into us on his bike.
He was trying to kill us.

839
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,850
But we weren't his enemy.

840
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,660
And we're not yours, we're really
not, we just...

841
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,530
We got mixed up in it.

842
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,370
You're telling me you are
the wrong mans?

843
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,940
Men, but, yeah.

844
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,450
So it was you who put
the bomb under our car?

845
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,540
Yes.

846
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,340
But this time I'm going to make sure
I see you die.

847
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,700
No, you're not.

848
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,570
That bomb could have killed us,
you prick!

849
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:55,890
We have the suspect, white male,
disarmed and in custody.

850
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,570
Confessed to planting
a car bomb too.

851
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,850
Excellent work.

852
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,050
Make sure you keep Pinkett
and Bourne there for questioning.

853
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,930
They've, er...
They've gone, I'm afraid.

854
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,210
'Both of them?'

855
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,530
Yes.

856
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,060
(Thank you.)

857
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,690
No, you need to
put it on the AVI channel.

858
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,690
Yeah, one second.

859
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,050
Can you open the door, Len?

860
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,490
Thanks.

861
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,060
'Len?'

862
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,250
'I did think about it.'

863
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,170
~ It's just I never know what to...
~ All I'm saying is, what's the point
of putting it on the invites

864
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,100
~ if no-one's going to bother?
~ Alan, come on, smile.

865
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,890
What?

866
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,660
Where's Lizzie?

867
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,370
I'm not a ghost, Noel!

868
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,780
No, sure, it's...

869
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,570
You were dead.

870
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,490
I was just struggling a bit...

871
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,580
Where is Lizzie?

872
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,890
I showed you what happens to people
who mess with Mr Espinosa.

873
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,970
So let me tell you what's going to
happen now.

874
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,450
You're going to give me
that fucking eye,

875
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,410
because I am taking an eye back to
Texas no matter what

876
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,540
and if it isn't that one, I will
find one some place else!

877
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,780
So don't do anything stupid.
Just tell me, where is the eye?

878
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,300
It's in my pocket.

879
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,420
What?

880
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,700
It's in my pocket, it's...

881
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,730
Oh, OK, good.

882
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,610
Cool. See you later.

883
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,850
Yeah.

884
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,460
~ Can I just...?
~ Sure, yeah.

885
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,460
It's OK.

886
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,970
Thanks, thank you. Thanks.

887
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,500
Bless you.

888
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,700
Oh, God!

889
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,250
I knew you'd come back.

890
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,060
I knew you weren't dead.

891
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,100
It was you keeping me alive.

892
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:08,970
'This better be real!'

893
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,010
I'll have another heart attack
if this isn't real.

894
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,850
It's real, Mum.

895
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,610
I'm back.

896
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,730
I'm never going to leave you again.

897
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,810
Oh, my boo-bear.

898
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,940
Oh!

On your head!

915
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,690
Hands on your head!

916
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,410
Turn around.

917
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,420
On your knees.
Cuff him.

918
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,100
This is Angel one. Suspect in
custody, returning to base.

919
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,180
Well, that couldn't have gone
better.

920
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,170
You got your reward.

921
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,500
1.5 million.

922
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,490
Did you hear that? They got him.

923
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,290
That's great!

924
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:57,090
This money will change everything
for my family.

925
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,730
Feliz navidad!

926
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,140
Feliz navidad!

927
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,530
'Rosa, I've got something that
I need confess.'

928
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,010
I'm not...

929
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,930
Ian was a lie.

930
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,090
I know.

931
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:14,330
I'm not a heart surgeon. I'm not
the European beat-boxing champion.

932
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,970
I've never been skiing.

933
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,650
'I don't know Liam Neeson.'

934
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,890
I just wanted to impress you.

935
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,330
That's why I told you those things,
because

936
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,690
the truth is I'm no-one.

937
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,660
A no-one who just brought down
Carlos Espinosa.

938
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,970
I say that's impressive.

939
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,530
I hadn't thought about it like that.

940
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:39,180
And anyway, it was not all those
things I fell in love with.

941
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,580
It was you, Ian.

942
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,890
Ah, it's... Well, it's Phil.

943
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,690
My name's actually Phil.
Philip, really.

944
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,610
Is there anything else you want to
tell me?

945
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,090
Is that everything now?

946
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:56,450
No, that's it. It's just...

947
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,450
Can I call you again?

948
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,370
You had better.

949
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,100
OK, I will.

950
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:05,940
I have to go now.

951
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,530
Adios, Phil.

952
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,100
Auf Wiedersehen.

953
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,090
That's done it.

954
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,370
Yeah.

955
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,260
Feels good to be alive.

956
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,780
Yeah, it does.

957
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,010
I wonder what time midnight mass is.

958
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,730
What time do you think it is?

959
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,610
I don't know. It's usually quite
late.

960
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,730
Yeah.

961
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,170
I'll Google it.

962
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,300
OK.
