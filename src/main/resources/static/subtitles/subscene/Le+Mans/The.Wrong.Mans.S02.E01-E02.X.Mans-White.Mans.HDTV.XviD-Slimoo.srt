1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,670
If you are not here by 
five o'clock we will kill your wife.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,990
This is our moment! We've been chosen!

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,670
I'm a Town Planning

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,710
and Noise Guidance Advisor
for Berkshire County Council!

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,750
"Small town, big future."

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,950
You're a 31-year-old Mail
Distribution Assistant who

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,150
lives with his mum!

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,670
What did I tell you about 
watching mucky ladies?

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,950
They're not happy.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,550
Guys, who wants to go go-karting?

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,230
No-one wants to go go-karting.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,190
I'll come.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,190
We're going to cross a lot of
bridges, Sam, jump a lot of hurdles.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,590
I don't know what you're
talking about and I don't...

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,350
I'm talking about rolling deep!

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,990
Get in. Does the name Marat
Milankovic mean anything to you?

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,310
Did he play for Stoke?

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,750
You keep safe, tell no-one.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,470
Milankovic can identify Russian
agents working here

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,280
and in the States.

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,720
Oh, my God, they killed Marat!

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,070
This is real now, this is Lizzie's life.

23
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,310
I will do the same to her if you 
don't bring the documents to

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,830
Brimpton Airfield within the next half an hour.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,950
Don't do it, Paul.
We'll have to shoot.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,270
That list of names is worth 
more than this kid's life.

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,830
Put your hands on your head!

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,390
Arrgh!

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,990
Arrgh!

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,480
Arrgh!

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,280
- You took a bullet for me.
- That's what friends do.

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,160
Best friends.

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,520
You've got to explode it.
If you don't explode it,
it doesn't mean anything.

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,790
Yeah, can I get one chicken fillet
combo meal, mega,

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,510
twice as spicy,
with a strawberry milkshake.

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,120
And...

37
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,910
Sam?

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,590
Er, spicy bean burger, please.

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,150
One nice 'n' spicy bean burger meal.

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,670
~ Just the burger, please.
~ No, one sec.

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,510
A drink on its own is 99p and hot
and crunchy wedges are £1.50.

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,310
I won't drink the drink,
or the wedges.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,350
~ 'So what do you want?'
~ One second. Deal or no deal, Sam?

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,760
~ No deal.
~ And a spicy bean burger meal deal.

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,470
~ Enjoying your drink?
~ All right, don't be like that.
We paid for it so I'm drinking it.

46
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,400
Is that for us?

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,670
Can I see your driver's
licence, please, sir?

48
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,870
Sorry, what's this about?

49
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,150
It's about me asking him
for his driver's licence.

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,750
~ I think if you radio your
superiors... ~ Broken tail light.

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,870
~ And tell them you've just pulled over
Samuel Pinkett... ~ Tread on these
tyres is dangerously low.

52
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,750
.. and Philip Bourne, you'll be told
to stand down and be on your way.

53
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,390
~ Step out of the vehicle. ~ Why? ~ I
asked you to step out of your car.

54
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,310
~ And I have asked you why? ~ If you do
not step out of your car, I will...

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,950
~ Why should I get out of the car?
~ Phil, you're making it worse.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,830
No, Sam. Stand your ground,
this is entrapment.

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,750
We're going nowhere, right.

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,630
Get out of the car.

59
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,480

Hey, listen up!
Ian's got something to say.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,430
~ Thanks, Raul. ~ No problem, man.
~ Appreciate that.

90
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,150
Um, just a quickie.
I don't know if anybody's seen this,

91
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,590
I just thought it might be nice
if we all go to the rodeo.

92
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,350
So, I mean, I think it would be fun.

93
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,510
There's fireworks
and there's a free kids' corral.

94
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,190
Just put your hands up
if you fancy it. Yes, Raul.

95
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,880
Chuck, are you in? Course you are.
Don? Donny? Yes. Anyone else?

96
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,030
Terry?

97
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,280
Terry? Everyone else is coming.

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,190
I'm busy.

99
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,150
Well, I haven't said when yet.

100
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,240
I know.

101
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,150
What was that all about?

102
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,350
~ What? ~ You know what, embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

103
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,830
I just don't want to go rodeo.

104
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,190
Come off it. You'd love the rodeo,
you're just being facetious.

105
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,670
~ Facetious? ~ Yes. Facetious.

106
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,760
And what does facetious mean?

107
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,680
I'm looking at it.

108
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,190
~ Hi. ~ Hey, man, what are you doing?

109
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,310
Check your list, man.
This ain't your load.

110
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,710
Sorry.

111
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,030
Get out of here, man.

112
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,040
Sorry.

113
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,230
Hello?

114
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,870
'Hello.
Am I speaking to Mrs Bourne?'

115
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,670
Yes, that's me.
Sorry, little bit out of breath.

116
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,230
'That's OK. I'm calling from your
car insurance company.

117
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,550
'Our system says that your policy
is up for renewal.'

118
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,910
Oh, no, I think you must have a
mistake on your system there.

119
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,230
Because I actually cancelled
it about, oh,

120
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,870
about eight or nine months ago now.

121
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,590
Oh, why was that?

122
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,230
Well, it was damaged,
so I had to get a new car.

123
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,110
Different colour this time, though,
because my old one was pink

124
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,870
and my son hated it, so,
so for the new one I decided to try

125
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,950
and get a colour that he would
have approved of.

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,230
It's lime green.

127
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,470
Lime green!

128
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,830
What makes you think
he would have approved of that?

129
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,630
Philip had a lime green
rucksack at school.

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,070
'Yes, which I'm sure was a huge
embarrassment to him'

131
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,550
and he resented every second
he was forced to wear it.

132
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,830
No, he loved it.

133
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,910
'But I'm sorry to have taken up'

134
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,470
too much of your time.

135
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,230
I will update our computer system
records accordingly.

136
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,750
All right, thank you.

137
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,240
Thank you. Good day.

138
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,880
Bye.

139
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,240
Oh, he's gone. Bye-bye.
That's a nice young man.

140
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,590
How did it go?

141
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,590
Oh, you know, same old story.

142
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,230
It's the Prime Minister
begging for me back.

143
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,910
I said to him,
get someone else to do it, Tony.

144
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,950
But you were the best brain
and heart surgeon in Britain.

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,630
Europe, but yeah, you're right.

146
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,110
You know, sometimes I do miss it,
saving people's lives.

147
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,400
But who was fixing me?

148
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,390
~ Kate Winslet couldn't.
~ That puta.

149
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,750
You know I hate her for what
she did to you.

150
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,470
Don't! It wasn't
Kate's fault, in a way.

151
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,030
I was so wrapped up in myself

152
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,640
and work that
I couldn't cater for her needs.

153
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,390
But I'll never do that to you.

154
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,040
I've given it all up for you.

155
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,560
Oh, Ian!

156
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,480
You are so amazing.

157
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,910
Hey. Rosa's invited us
round to hers for Christmas,

158
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,750
which I thought might be fun.

159
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,110
You know, be a bit of a full house
with her brothers and that, but...

160
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,590
What are you looking at?

161
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,120
Watch.

162
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,470
They're traffickers. They hide
stuff in with the shipments.

163
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,110
Drugs, knock-off goods, people.

164
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,470
It's none of our business.

165
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,430
This could be our ticket home.

166
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,030
You've got to stop
talking like that. This IS our home.

167
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,550
It isn't and it never will be.

168
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,430
When are you going to start
looking on the bright side?

169
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,150
This is a fresh start.

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,030
The weather's good,
the accommodation is free.

171
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,470
There's any number of reasons
why this is great.

172
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,070
You'll find another
girlfriend in Bracknell.

173
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,910
Rosa's not just my girlfriend,
she's my soul mate, my companion.

174
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,390
Mentally, spiritually and yes,
sexually.

175
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,750
It's a sexual relationship.
We're having sex.

176
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,670
She thinks you're a former
pro-wrestler who also found

177
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,870
time to be a heart
and brain surgeon,

178
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,560
before giving it all up to come
and do stunts on a forklift truck.

179
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,590
And there it is, there it is.

180
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,430
I'm sorry I've got a forklift
driving licence,

181
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,870
and yes, that's opened doors for me.
It is not a level playing field.

182
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,790
I walk in there, I'm queen bee,
I'm Top Of The Pops,

183
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,550
I'm a big noise, yeah.

184
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,430
I'm someone
at Gopher Distribution Incorporated

185
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,200
and you can't bloody stand it!

186
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,440
Wow!

187
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,870
~ You're right, Phil. ~ Yes.

188
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,550
It's actually a relief
to hear it out loud.

189
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,470
~ Good. ~ I mean, yes,
the moment I'd got back with Lizzie,

190
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,470
the love of my life, I was ripped
away from her and dumped in a shitty

191
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,990
town in the middle of the desert
on the other side of the world.

192
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,390
But your...

193
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,480
forklift driving licence...

194
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,080
.. that's what really...

195
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,400
.. gnaws away at me!

196
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,360
I don't know who you are any more.

197
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,870
~ Wait. ~ What?

198
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,270
There's the match I leave
in the door. Someone's inside.

199
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,480
It probably just
blew off in the wind.

200
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,880
Argh!

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,630
Not quite the welcome
I was expecting, boys.

202
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,830
Why are you here?
Did they catch someone?

203
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,670
Sorry, if I'd have known
we were expecting guests,

204
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,910
I'd have got something in.

205
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,710
Actually, I brought you some
Christmas pressies.

206
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,190
Yeah, some things... I thought...

207
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,630
you might be missing.

208
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,390
Did they find out who
planted the bomb?

209
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,590
Like some biccies.

210
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,590
No, Terry,
they haven't caught anyone.

211
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,030
This is merely a routine catch-up
just to see how you're settling in.

212
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,710
I'm glad you're here, though,

213
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,000
because I've been doing
some thinking.

214
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,150
~ What if the bomb was planted the day
before? ~ I hadn't seen this.

215
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,470
The way I see it,
these are our suspects.

216
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,190
Reid didn't know we'd stitched him
up until after the bomb had

217
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,070
been planted,
so it couldn't have been him.

218
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,350
Looks a bit serial killer.

219
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,950
So either your double agent still
had some influence,

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,830
even after he was caught,
or it's the FSB, somehow.

221
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,950
~ Terry... ~ But why would they bother?

222
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,470
Apart from revenge,
in which case it must be personal,

223
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,910
which I think means we're just
looking for one person...

224
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,790
~ Terry... ~ Which is a completely...

225
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,350
~ Stop. ~ I'm saying,
why can't we just go home?

226
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,830
You could put us under surveillance,
give us armed guards.

227
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,950
~ We could...
~ You need to destroy this. Right now.

228
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,830
This goes against everything
we agreed.

229
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,470
I didn't agree anything with you.

230
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,590
I am here under the full authority
of the Director of the Security
Services.

231
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,430
Exactly. You're the cub scout.

232
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,790
I want to speak to Akela.

233
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,830
'It's OK, Collins,'

234
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,400
I'm sure Her Majesty will just pop
the salmon in the microwave
when I get back.

235
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,190
'You made a choice.
You can't go back on that.

236
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,950
'You knew that if you
stayed in Bracknell, you risked not
only your own lives,'

237
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,350
but the lives
of your families and loved ones.

238
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,710
You chose to protect those people
and stay alive,

239
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,190
'and you understood that that was
a permanent decision.'

240
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,150
Yes, then.
But now I've figured out that if...

241
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,150
'This is not something you can
call time on.'

242
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,160
Get it into your head - Samuel
Pinkett and Philip Bourne are dead.

243
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,430
'Do you understand?'

244
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,230
Yes.

245
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,320
Then don't contact me again unless
it's a matter of national security.

246
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,430
Now, don't do anything silly,

247
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,550
don't make any contact with
any one you knew.

248
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,480
As long as you stay here,
you're safe.

249
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,760
Jesus!

250
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,550
I thought you were dead.

251
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,750
Yuri never told you he had
a brother?

252
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,320
We're monozygotic twins.

253
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,960
Or at least we were.

254
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,440
Right.

255
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,480
How did you get
permission to come here?

256
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,030
Wherever here is.

257
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,150
Special diplomacy between Russia and UK.

258
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,070
FSB are cleaning up your operation.

259
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,070
They need to know if there
are any loose ends

260
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,030
~ they should be aware of, anyone else
who would know what happened.
~ No, Milankovic was shot.

261
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,390
Er, so was his associate.

262
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,150
Now your... your brother was
killed by Pinkett and Bourne,

263
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,870
but I heard that they
died in a car bomb.

264
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,080
Yes, I heard the bodies were
unidentifiable.

265
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,550
Yeah, I see.

266
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,270
And no-one else knew more than the
names on that list,

267
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,710
apart from me.

268
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,800
Good.

269
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,280
I am finished with him.

270
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,270
No!

271
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,470
Back up, back up!
I'm being attacked!

272
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,870
What are you talking about?

273
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,550
I'm sorry, Terry.

274
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,160
It's just until we agree another
contract with a cleaning firm.

275
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,840
It's OK.

276
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,520
Are you crazy?
What if someone sees us?

277
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,880
I am married, Terry.

Who doesn't like Cafe Rouge?

287
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,750
Because we have it here every year.

288
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,750
The whole point of an office party
is that it's at your office.

289

If we worked at Cafe Rouge,
I'd be with you, Noel.

~ How about Chiquitos?
~ Chiquitos I don't mind.

291
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,950
Lizzie, what do you think? Lizzie?

292
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,590
Sorry, yeah, um,
keep it in the office, I suppose.

293
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,960
What about dress code?

294
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,910
'Oh, hello.
Am I speaking with Mrs Bourne?'

295
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,830
I'm afraid she's not here.

296
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,790
She was actually taken into hospital
late last night.

297
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,590
Is there something I can help with?

298
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,750

every now and again.'

301
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,670
Well, what's the matter with her?

302
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,470
'It's her heart.

Terry, I need to speak to you.

312
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,310
What is it?

313
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,070
Don't be cross with me,
OK. Promise?

314
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,670
~ My mum's ill and it's... ~ Wait,
how do you know about your mum?

315
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,070
~ I've been calling home. ~ What?!
~ I said don't be cross.

316
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,830
~ Are you mad? ~ I use a pay phone,
I put on an accent. ~ Have you got any
idea... ~ Just listen to me!

317
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,630
OK, she's been taken into hospital
and Janice our neighbour said

318
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,510
she doesn't think she's going to
make it till Christmas.

319
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,350
And I can't bear the thought of her
being on her own, Sam, I can't.

320
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,590
First she lost my dad
and then she thinks I am dead

321
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,710
and it's just, I've got to be with
her, Sam, right.
I've got to leave now.

322
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,360
~ This is what I've been saying.
~ I know, I'm sorry.

323
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,230
Are you serious about this?

324
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,030
Yes.

325
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,030
Good. Because I've got an idea.

326
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,910
But we are going to cross
a lot of bridges, OK.

327
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,750
And jump a lot of hurdles,

328
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,640
and I need to know that I'm with
someone who's prepared to roll deep.

329
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,120
Are you prepared to roll deep?

330
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,520
That's how I roll.

331
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,320
Let's go home, Phil.

332
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,350
'You boys better be careful'

333
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,510
throwing these accusations around.

334
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,310
You never know who might
get mad at you.

335
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,150
We're not looking for trouble,
we're just asking for help.

336
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,150
We know you move people
across the border.

337
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,990
Can you help us get documents
to get back to Britain?

338
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,840
That's what I'm saying to you.

339
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,310
I don't do that stuff.

340
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,990
Well, can you tell us who does?

341
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,160
Please?

342
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,390
'Now listen, this guy you're about
to meet, Carlos Espinosa,

343
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,110
'he ain't the kind of guy that
likes to be found.

344
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,910
'So you mess him around,
then I get messed around.

345
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,840
'You understand?'

346
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,550
I can't believe I'm helping
you to leave.

347
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,230
But you're right, this was never
going to work long-term.

348
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,200
But I can still think about you.

349
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,550
About last night,

350
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,160
~ when I'm in the...
~ Oh, no, I get it, thank you.

351
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,520
There's no-one here.

352
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,830
I just want you to know that what you
did with Maria last night

353
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,430
was nothing short of heroic
and will never be forgotten.

354
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,790
I hope you're wrong,

355
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,200
because I'll be trying to forget
it as soon as possible.

356
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,430
I have spent most of my life moving
things,

357
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,680
drugs, guns, people, into America.

358
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,110
If somebody tells me they have two
guys who want to get out,

359
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,720
I couldn't believe it was true.

360
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,430
But you are real.

361
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,150
You sure you are real?

362
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,510
Yes, yeah.

363
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,790
The thing is, we can't travel on our
passports, so we need someone to...

364
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,270
Which one of you has a sick mother?

365
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,840
I do. That's me.

366
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,600
I know what it's like to lose family
without being able to say goodbye.

367
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,150
We got together all the money
we could get our hands on.

368
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,670
It's 1,800 dollars.

369
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,590
We help you.

370
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,270
Call me a sentimental old fool,
or maybe I'm just

371
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,560
excited about the idea of getting
someone out for a change.

372
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,760
You'll hear from us soon.

373
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,870
Hello, gentlemen. David Kinsmann.
Today is your lucky day.

374
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,030
Did Carlos send you?

375
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,230
I have no idea who you're talking
about.

376
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,110
Carlos Espinosa, Mexican fella,
lives in a cave?

377
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,790
No, we get it.

378
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,830
Laurence Gilliard and Ryan Castaine.

379
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,030
You're musicians.

380
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,870
What, like buskers or a professional
band?

381
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,230
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

382
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,910
I'll probably the frontman.

383
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,950
~ Why is that such a given?
~ Isn't it obvious?

384
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,590
Look, the important part is that you
work out your stories

385
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,190
and they're the same as each
other's.

386
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,070
In case anybody asks any questions,
learn your dates of birth,

387
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,750
etc, etc. I got to go.

388
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,590
Hang on, these flights are today.

389
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,990
Yeah. If I were you I'd head off
pretty quickly.

390
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,240
You do not want to miss that flight.

391
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,390
What are you doing?

392
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,590
I'm leaving a note for Rosa.

393
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,070
No! Absolutely not. We can't leave a
trail.

394
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,830
I can't just go without saying
goodbye.

395
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,590
Yes, we can, that's the deal.

396
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,990
But it's half price Tuesdays.

397
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,510
We were going to see Madagascar 4
tonight.

398
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,550
We're only going to get one chance
at this, Phil.

399
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,560
If you want to see your mum,
we've got to get it right.

400
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,270
I'm sorry about Rosa, I really am.

401
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,920
It's OK.

402
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,400
It'll be out on DVD soon
anyway.

403
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,950
~ Date of birth?
~ September 14th, 1983.

404
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,600
~ Place of birth? ~ Flint, Michigan.
~ Very good.

405
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,790
Where are you flying to today,
gentlemen?

406
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,910
We be going to London, England,
or as I call it, the 53rd state.

407
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,070
We're going to drink us some tea,
butter up a scone,

408
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,710
maybe eat some fish and chips,
nice and crispy, crispy batter.

409
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,390
Did you pack these cases yourselves?

410
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,830
You're goddamn right I did.

411
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,950
I put my clothes all up in that
suitcase.

412
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,590
Janine, can I borrow you a second?

413
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,430
One moment, sirs.

414
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,390
OK.

415
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,790
What was that?

416
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,270
~ What? ~ That voice?

417
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,550
It's my American accent.
You should practice yours.

418
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,070
YOU should practice YOURS!

419
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,310
You sound African American.

420
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,230
Not me. Laurence Gilliard.

421
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,270
Laurence Gilliard isn't black
either, you've got the same face.

422
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,480
Just let me do the talking, OK?

423
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,270
Sorry about that.

424
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,790
Do you have any dietary requirements
for your flight today?

425
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,750
Let me think... Er, no, ma'am,
I'll probably sleep most of the way,

426
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,800
so I'll be happy as long as I can
get a cup of coffee.

427
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,680
OK. Well, enjoy your flight.

428
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,150
"A cwup of cwoffee"?

429
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,870
All right, it's harder than I
thought.

430
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,910
Damn straight.

431
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,590
Let's just try not to talk from now
on.

432
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,350
Final call for flight 228 to London.
Please make your way to gate 15.

433
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,790
We're really doing it, Sam.

434
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,640
~ We're going home. ~ I know.

435
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,950
Mr Castaine, Mr Gilliard?

436
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,550
I'm Special Agent Miller.

437
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,320
Would you please come with me?

438
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,560
So you're musicians?

439
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,040
And what, you were going over to
England to play some shows?

440
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,360
Which one of you plays guitar?

441
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,760
And these must be yours?

442
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,880
Let's hear something then.

Ryan Castaine and Laurence Gilliard,
I'm arresting you for possession

455
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,070
and intent to traffic cocaine,

456
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,670
under section 841 of the Controlled
Substance Act.

457
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,350
You have the right to remain silent.

458
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,760
Anything you do say may be
held against you in a court of law.

459
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,790
Please, you have to listen!

460
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,430
We bought fake passports, OK?

461
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,950
We didn't know about the drugs!

462
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,710
We only knew about the passports.

463
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,990
We're in witness protection
and we had to break it

464
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,510
because we need to get home.

465
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,830
We were given the bags. We're not
Ryan and Laurence.

466
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,470
~ No, we're not even Terry and Ian.
~ Would you two shut up?

467
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,830
~ I'm Philip Bourne.
~ And I'm Sam Pinkett.

468
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,830
We were given the passports
by Carlos Espinosa.

469
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,950
He must have planted the drugs.

470
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,230
~ Say that name again.
~ Philip Bourne. ~ No.

471
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,990
Carlos Espinosa?

472
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,480
Pull over.

473
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,280
You, get back in the vehicle.

474
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,750
How do you know Carlos Espinosa?

475
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,430
We were in witness protection,
but we decided we had to leave.

476
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,030
I found out that my mum was poorly.

477
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,710
We were introduced to Espinosa

478
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,630
because we were told he could get us
home.

479
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,830
We didn't know he was going to
use us as drug donkeys.

480
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,430
Mules.

481
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,390
And you're willing to say this?

482
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,030
On the record, in front of a Federal
Judge?

483
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,110
Yeah.

484
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,150
It's the truth.

485
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,110
OK.

486
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,630
Get back in.

487
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,190
Well, where are we going?

488
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,030
I need 24 hours to check out
your story.

489
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,110
Until then, you've still been
charged

490
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,960
and you're still going to jail.

491
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,840
Agh, agh, agh!

492
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,150
Get up.

493
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,560
Let's roll, ladies.

494
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,590
Welcome to paradise.

495
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,390
Here's your suite.

496
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,830
Freshly vacated.

497
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,550
Two white boys just like y'all got
transferred out

498
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,470
last night for their own safety.

499
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,430
~ I want my phone call. ~ Me too.

500
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,030
You get one phone call every 90
days for good behaviour.

501
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,950
We're not going to be here
that long.

502
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,230
We're actually innocent.

503
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,590
Oh, why didn't you say?

504
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,910
We've got some much nicer rooms for
the innocent ones.

505
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,510
Really?

506
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,830
I think he was being sarcastic.

507
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,920
Hm.

508
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,150
Oh, God!

509
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,390
Listen to me, Sam, you cannot show
any weakness, OK?

510
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,390
These guys can smell fear.

511
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,590
I've seen all this on Ross Kemp's
Toughest Jails.

512
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,430
At some point, probably today,

513
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,350
someone is going to start a fight
with you.

514
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,910
You've got to win, or at least fight
back,

515
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,710
or you'll be marked out and beaten
every day.

516
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,950
They wouldn't beat us up for no
reason.

517
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,270
If we give them no reason...

518
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,200
Did Ross Kemp give them a reason?

519
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,870
We've got to look tough, right?

520
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,390
It's either that or you become
someone's wife.

521
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,840
Ooh, yes, please!

522
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,390
Are you not eating those beans?

523
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,630
No, I don't like them.

524
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,350
What's wrong with them?

525
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,480
Nothing, they're just a bit syrupy.

526
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,120
Look around you, Sam, everyone has
cleared their plates.

527
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,430
We don't know the rules yet,
the secret codes.

528
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,190
You're dishonouring them and
embarrassing me.

529
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,910
OK. You eat them, then.

530
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,550
Are you insane? That could be worse.

531
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,640
I'm not getting a reputation as, "Oh,
the guy who eats everybody's beans".

532
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,990
Don't look now, but there's a man
over there staring at me.

533
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,440
I said, "Don't look round"!

534
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,000
What's he doing now?

535
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,830
He's just licked his lips.

536
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,790
What, like he's got chapped lips,
or he licked them at you

537
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,670
in a sexy way?

538
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,160
I don't know.

539
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,430
A sexy way, I guess.

540
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,150
OK, I hate to break it to you Sam,
but you're now legally his bitch.

541
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,600
Eat your beans.

542
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,790
'Can you repeat those names?'

543
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,630
Sure. Samuel Pinkett
and Philip Bourne.

544
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,910
'Hold, please.'

545
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,950
Who is this?

546
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,910
This is Special Agent Miller.

547
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,910
I'm with the DEA here in Texas.

548
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,040
I see.

549
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,350
I need to know if you have two men

550
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,310
in some kind of witness protection
deal over here,

551
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,320
by the names of Samuel Pinkett and
Philip Bourne?

552
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,880
Is this a secure line?

553
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,950
I thought most people put up
pictures of boobs.

554
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,550
Who gets off on mathematical
equations?

555
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,030
Mr Watkins once got a boner in double
maths.

556
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,280
Everyone could see it, it was
amazing.

557
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,280
421, 422.

558
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,200
You got a date with the DEA.

559
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,950
We just tell her everything.

560
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,150
It's Carlos she's interested in,
not us.

561
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,110
But when do you think she'll let us
out of here?

562
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,710
Because ideally I need to leave ASAP.

563
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,830
Yeah, I wasn't planning on hanging
out here too long myself, actually.

564
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,350
Cool, so we're on the same page.

565
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,310
Good morning, gentlemen.
Nice to see you again.

566
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,990
Mr Espinosa heard a rumour you'd be
seeing a law enforcement

567
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,030
agent today and he thought it best
if you had an attorney present.

568
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,350
He has kindly paid for my services
to act in your best interests.

569
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,670
We are still going to fulfil our end
of our bargain

570
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,510
and you will see your mum.

571
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,710
But we paid.

572
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,070
18 hundred bucks wasn't enough
to cover the documents,

573
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,350
let alone the flight.

574
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,710
But, in lieu of a fee, Mr Espinosa
thought

575
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,950
maybe you could do him
a little favour.

576
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,510
How little?

577
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,510
There is an inmate here,
number 214, a certain Nathan Cross.

578
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,990
He's stolen a great deal of money
and merchandise from Mr Espinosa.

579
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,750
He's hiding it and you're going to
find out where.

580
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,830
Now, this cop is going to tell you
she can help you.

581
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,470
She might even tell you she can get
you out of here,

582
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,030
which she can't because you won't
have a shred of evidence,

583
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,430
and even if you did, she can't get
you out of here today.

584
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,390
And if you spill a word about Mr
Espinosa, there will be no tomorrow.

585
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,230
In fact, I have a sweet little
photo

586
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,390
of the last person who agreed
to testify against Mr Espinosa.

587
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,080
You want to see?

588
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,200
Hash tag no filter.

589
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,430
Interview begins 13.05,
December 19th.

590
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,390
OK, gentlemen.

591
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,790
Last time I saw you,

592
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,910
you started to tell me about your
interactions with Carlos Espinosa.

593
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,000
Correct?

594
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,910
You stated that you were unaware
of the narcotics in your baggage

595
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,590
and that they were given to you
by an associate of Carlos Espinosa,

596
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,310
who also arranged for your false
documentation.

597
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,720
For the record, are these
the facts as you stated them to me?

598
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,040
Boys, boys, boys.

599
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,990
Your attorney may have told you that
I can't help you, but I can.

600
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,830
I've checked out your story,
I know who you really are,

601
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,630
and with a little co-operation,
I can get you home.

602
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,430
And there's a reward for any
information that leads to

603
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,870
Espinosa's whereabouts.

604
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,240
A lot of money.

605
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,680
My clients would like to know
when you could effect their release.

606
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,830
Soon.

607
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,720
Exactly how soon?

608
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,270
Yeah, you made the right call.

609
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,790
Why do you need us to get this guy?

610
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,310
Haven't you got people in here who
can already get to him?

611
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,550
Er, let's just say they don't
have the right... qualities

612
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,550
Nathan Cross looks for in a friend.

613
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,790
So how do we find him?

614
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,470
He's in the hospital wing.

615
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,110
And how do we get there?

616
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,950
Guys, I've explained your options.

617
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,160
This is the one where you get to
live.

618
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,710
OK. This is the decider.

619
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,040
Mm-hm.

620
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,390
~ Best of five.
~ Come on. ~ Best of five.

621
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,750
Come on, we agreed.

622
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,680
OK, all right. OK.

623
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,630
OK.

624
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,670
Just hit me, go on, just hit me in
the face.

625
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,550
OK, hit me, hit me, hit me!

626
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,080
Argh!

627
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,790
Oh! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

628
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,270
I just, it's just reflexes.

629
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,190
It's how my brain is trained in a
certain way, I'm sorry.

630
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,150
I'm so sorry. I promise I won't hit
you again.

631
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,270
I'm going to put my hands
behind my back, OK.

632
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,550
Go on, go on.

633
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
~ Ready? ~ Yes.
~ Ready? ~ Yes! Yes!

634
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,550
Oh, my shit! I'm sorry!

635
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,430
I honestly don't know what's
wrong with me! I'm...

636
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,480
Argh!

637
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,230
You want this, do you?

638
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,480
Is this what you want?
Do you like this?

639
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,720
Don't bite me!

640
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,470
You're fine. It's just cuts and
bruises.

641
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,830
I don't feel fine.

642
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,910
So what happens now?

643
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,950
We stay here tonight and then
tomorrow morning,

644
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,390
spot of breakfast, head back?

645
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,430
You're going straight back
to your cells.

646
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,470
~ What?
~ You think it's that easy?

647
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,630
No, I really do think
I might have broken my finger.

648
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,790
The least...

649
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,110
Wait out there for somebody to
escort you back.

650
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,240
Don't make me call the guard in
here.

651
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,510
'You should have hit me harder.'

652
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,040
I hit you as hard as I can.

653
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,640
I just want to see my mum.

654
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,630
Get your stinking gorilla hands off
of me!

655
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,320
Aw, Mr Cross...

656
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,150
No "Thanks for treating my wounds"?

657
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,230
"Thanks for the daily sponge baths"?

658
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,990
"Thanks for feeding me when I
couldn't move my hands"?

659
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,870
Oh, God, that's why it had to be us.

660
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,950
Why?

661
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,030
Fuck you!

662
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,880
He's some kind of Nazi.
It's because we're white.

663
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,070
You know, you may call me
the gorilla,

664
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,480
but you're the one living in a cage.

665
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,030
Hi.

666
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,110
All right?

667
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,480
Argh!

668
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:44,110
Ha-ha-ha, good one. Ha-ha-ha.

669
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,640
Bloody hell.

670
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,160
So, what are you in for?

671
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,280
They call it a spree.

672
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,310
Cool.

673
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,440
But that's just the ones they found.

674
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,190
And is that because...?

675
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,040
Time to go, ladies.

676
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,200
Yes, please.

677
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,230
I don't know if I can go through
with this.

678
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,150
We've got to, we don't want to end
up like the guy in the photograph.

679
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,830
But they're bloody racists, though!

680
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:51,310
We don't have to be racist.
We just have to hang out with some.

681
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,000
It's like watching Top Gear.

682
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,080
Somebody should tell those rats
they're spoiling the view.

683
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,310
He'll do it.

684
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,430
What?

685
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,510
Oh, yeah. This one, he will, he's
mental.

686
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,750
He's got a, got a screw loose,

687
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,190
always has done, always will do.

688
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,350
What are you doing?

689
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,310
Shut up, this could be our ticket
out of here.

690
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,590
In Bracknell, everybody's
scared of him, aren't they?

691
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,470
Because he's, he's doolally.

692
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,550
If he walks down the high street,
people just,

693
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,870
they, they turn and they run the
other way.

694
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,950
He left school before he'd
finished his GCSEs.

695
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,510
And he could have got a C in science.

696
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,480
Banned from The Litten Tree
on Friday nights.

697
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,110
And last summer he killed a kid.

698
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,150
He did what?

699
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,630
As in a goat, as in a baby goat.

700
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,390
Now, what the hell you killing
a goat for, boy?

701
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,430
I'm into some pretty dark stuff.

702
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,870
Now, hold up, you mean to tell me
people are scared of this pussy?

703
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,190
Pussy? Would a pussy, yeah,
have that - a gunshot wound.

704
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,950
And you should see the other guy,
except you'd have to dig him up.

705
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,430
It's the other arm.

706
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,270
Because he's dead. Is it?

707
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,600
Gunshot wound. There, bang.

708
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,360
In the arm.

709
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,670
It was actually a black
man who shot me.

710
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,120
That's why I decided to become a
racist.

711
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,520
Like you guys.

712
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,960
All right then. Let's see this.

713
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,070
You walk over there,

714
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,550
walk right up to Snake,

715
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,680
and here's what you're going to say.

716
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,270
I just need to speak...

717
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,830
~ You want to go in there? ~ Yes.

718
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,360
You sure? Be my guest.

719
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,720
Afternoon.

720
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,320
My friends and I were wondering
if...

721
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,510
We should go and help out,
yeah?

722
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,230
Guys?

723
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,110
'It's a tsunami, a tidal wave
of sewage leaking over the border.'

724
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,640
I do what I can to clean up
the mess, the filth, the scum.

725
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,920
This is the thanks I get.

726
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,070
But what can you do

727
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,470
when the law is in the pocket
of these fucking animals,

728
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,550
huh?

729
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,960
Argh!

730
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,430
So hey, Nathan, just going
back to the whole, you know,

731
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,110
sewage situation.

732
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,840
Is there anyone in particular that
you maybe think that...

733
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,670
'You'll like this one.
My cousin Lenny,'

734
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,350
standing in line at City
Mutual Bank, San Antonio.

735
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,510
He's going to cash in his paycheck.

736
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,070
These three dagos walk in wearing
wrestling masks, waving guns around.

737
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,510
"This is a robbery".

738
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,510
Cool as you like, he waits for them
to finish,

739
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,950
pulls out his piece, pop, pop, pop!

740
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,870
Picks up the bag and walks clean out
of there

741
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,230
75,000 better off than when he went
in.

742
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,230
Now that's what I call a paycheck.

743
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,910
That's bullshit.

744
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,600
Nah, this is my cousin Lenny.

745
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,920
You think they don't have cameras
in every branch of every bank?

746
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,550
If it was your cousin
waiting in line,

747
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,680
his face would have been on CNN by
six o'clock that day.

748
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,750
And it wasn't three dagos,
it was four.

749
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,600
And it wasn't 75,000,
it was 82,000.

750
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,270
And they'll only find the murder
weapon the day

751
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,400
they dredge the Rio fucking Grande.

752
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,230
I mean, the really big fish is
Carlos Espinosa.

753
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,830
Carlos Espinosa?

754
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,950
I mean, Nathan has got to loads of
these guys,

755
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,870
but I'd be surprised if he's come
close to Espinosa.

756
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,990
Well, apparently Carlos Espinosa is
the real reason

757
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,670
that Nathan's even in here.

758
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,550
~ Really?
~ Yeah, apparently.

759
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,470
What did you just say about Carlos
Espinosa?

760
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,720
Oh, hi, Nathan.

761
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,390
What the hell do you think you know
about Carlos Espinosa?

762
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,430
Not us, other people, saying that
he's smarter than you

763
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:24,600
and that he's the one person who got
to you before you could get to him.

764
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,230
He got to me...

765
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,320
Apparently.

766
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,440
How about I got to him?

767
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,350
And I killed his only son and ten
of his other men,

768
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,230
took down his biggest ever trade,

769
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,910
all the money and half a tonne of
pure Colombian,

770
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,360
buried it somewhere so secret and so
remote that only I will ever know.

771
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,000
And I will take that to my grave.

772
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,960
Goddamn!

773
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,630
It's his eye.

774
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,040
He said he's got the money locked
away and his eye is the key.

775
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,830
That is very interesting.
Fascinating, in fact.

776
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,990
Mr Espinosa will be very
pleased to hear this.

777
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,030
Great.

778
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,270
Amazing.

779
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,830
How soon do you think you can get
it?

780
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,270
What?

781
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,520
You heard me.

782
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,510
You want us to get his eye?

783
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,310
If that's what we need, then yes.

784
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,510
That's impossible, it's his eye.

785
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,630
It's in his head.

786
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,470
And he's a psycho.

787
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,710
Shall I remind you of your options?

788
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,990
OK, OK, let's say
we managed to get it,

789
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,310
that we somehow managed to get it,
if we do,

790
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,990
you'll get us home?

791
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,240
Yes, the moment we have it,
you're on your way.

792
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,520
♪ Christmas time is here

793
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:12,480
♪ And my baby's so far away

794
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:22,830
♪ Christmas time is here

795
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,960
♪ And my baby's so far away. ♪

796
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,190
'It's impossible.'

797
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,590
'Nothing's impossible.'

798
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,390
Loads of things are impossible.

799
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,390
I can't fly.

800
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,510
I can't walk through that wall.

801
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,710
And we can't get a man's eye
out of his head without him noticing

802
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,520
and very probably killing us.

803
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,150
We could make a duplicate.

804
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,630
Oh, we'll just pop down the
glass-blowing workshop

805
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,230
and knock out a perfect
synthetic eye?

806
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,070
Then we'll have to kill him.

807
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,030
~ What?
~ Who's going to miss him?

808
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,950
He's a racist, a thief, a murderer.

809
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,950
Yeah, he's a murderer, we're not.

810
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,550
We're...

811
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,790
I don't know, victims.

812
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,550
Innocent victims, again.

813
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,270
We don't have to be victims,
we can change our fate.

814
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,440
No, we can't, that's what fate is,
it's inevitable.

815
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,510
I don't even know what day it is, do
you?

816
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,430
It must be 21st, 22nd?

817
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,680
Nearly Christmas.

818
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,150
What's your favourite bit of
Christmas dinner?

819
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,630
Sausage wrapped in bacon. Without
question.

820
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,270
It's the only meal where it's
acceptable to have an extra

821
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,590
portion of meat which is itself
wrapped in meat.

822
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,120
It's amazing.

823
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,510
Me and Mum always make the Christmas
dinner together,

824
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,910
drinking sherry.

825
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,710
She doesn't drink the rest of the
year,

826
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,960
so she's wasted by the time we sit
down.

827
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,320
Then she passes out and I watch
Die Hard.

828
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,710
Lizzie can't really cook.

829
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,320
I make the dinner, wearing a...

830
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,150
When we were first together,
I told Lizzie I think

831
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,470
Christmas jumpers are naff, so she
bought me one as a joke.

832
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,720
She's got me one every year since.

833
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,560
I can't imagine Christmas without
one now.

834
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,030
You know how I always know it's
going to be Christmas?

835
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,590
When that nativity display pops
up at the top of the high street.

836
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,190
You know the one?
I don't even know who puts it there.

837
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,030
Have you ever noticed the wise men?

838
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:57,110
No. What about them?

839
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,590
Well, Simon Pedgrift once dared me
to draw a moustache on one.

840
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,710
No-one's ever wiped it off.
I make a point of checking.

841
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,750
It was still there last year.

842
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,590
Time for your phone call.

843
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,910
What?

844
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,350
It hasn't been 90 days.

845
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,000
Do you want to make a call or not?

846
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,710
Elizabeth Green's office.

847
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,350
Is Lizzie there? I need to speak to
her urgently, please.

848
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,350
~ One moment. ~ This is a bad idea.

849
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,870
If she knows we're alive,
maybe she can help.

850
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,270
She could talk to the press...

851
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,310
They told us not to contact anyone,
you could be putting her in danger.

852
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,960
Only if you believe someone's
still after us.

853
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,830
It won't be a Christmas party
if it's not here.

854
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,390
Of course it will. Other places have
decorations as well.

855
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,630
Anybody seen Lizzie?

856
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,240
On the roof having a cigarette,
I'd imagine.

857
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,800
Listen, I know a guy at Bella Pasta,
OK? He can get us in.

858
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,350
Come on, come on.

859
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,830
So you're sure you're not putting
Lizzie in any danger?

860
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,310
~ Yes. ~ How sure?

861
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,390
98%?

862
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,470
Right, so you're saying there's
a 2% chance that

863
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,320
she will definitely be harmed?

864
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,200
Elizabeth Green speaking.

865
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,840
Hello?

866
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,230
Hello?

867
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,520
Watch out!

868
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,910
The line just went dead.

869
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,790
Did you ask who it was?

870
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,590
I did not. Sorry Lizzie, mea culpa.

871
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,030
This can't be about the beans.

872
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,720
I eat the beans now.

873
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,920
Argh!

874
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,960
What the hell?
Everybody back to their cells!

875
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,270
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

876
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,680
Hey!

877
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,080
Phil! Phil!

878
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,920
Really?

879
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,870
Sam!

880
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,400
I'm sorry!

881
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,920
Over here!

882
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,910
Oh, my God!

883
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,350
You guys are incredible!

884
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,950
That was amazing.

885
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,470
I mean, when they said,

886
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,630
"The moment you get the eye,
we'll get you out,"

887
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,710
I didn't think they meant literally
the second! Whoo!

888
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,350
Unbelievable! Properly unbelievable.

889
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,350
I can't believe it!

890
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,560
We were told to give
you guys these.

891
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,870
Now get some rest, huh?

892
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,720
It's a long flight and you have a
big day tomorrow.

893
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,110
Oh, OK, and what about the eye?

894
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,920
Yeah, where's Carlos?

895
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,520
Who the hell is Carlos?

896
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,510
Lie to me again and I'll shoot you.

897
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,590
You don't understand!

898
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,190
We're just a couple of guys in a band

899
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,030
on our way to England to play some
shows.

900
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,190
What? No, we're not!

901
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,070
No, we work for a trucking company in
Texas.

902
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,870
No, we work for the council,
or we used to.

903
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,190
I don't work for the council.

904
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,120
I just work in the building,
I'm sub-contracted.
