Synched by Zirkhaki

2
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,500
'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.

3
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But who shall lead our business
against the Turkish fleet?

4
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,600
Othello.

5
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,800
Another of his fathom
we have none.

6
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,500
The fortitude of the place
is best known to him.

7
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,400
I take it much unkindly
that thou, lago...

8
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
...who hast had my purse
as if the strings were thine...

9
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,500
...shouldst know of this.

10
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,800
By the faith of man,
I know my price.

11
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,800
I am worth no worse a place.
But he, one Michael Cassio...

12
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,400
...a Florentine,
must his lieutenant be.

13
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,100
And I, of whom
his eyes had seen the proof...

14
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,700
- God bless the mark!...
his Moorship's ensign.

15
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,900
O by heaven, I rather
would have been his hangman.

16
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,600
Why, there's no remedy.
'Tis the curse of service.

17
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,500
I would not follow him then.

18
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,500
O, sir, content you.

19
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,400
I follow him
to serve my turn upon him.

20
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,300
We cannot all be masters, nor
all masters cannot be truly followed.

21
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,400
You shall mark...

22
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,100
...heaven is my judge,
not I for love and duty...

23
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,200
...but seeming so for my peculiar end.

24
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,200
I am not what I am.

25
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What a full fortune does the thick-
lips owe, if he can carry it thus.

26
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,300
Call up her father.

27
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,200
Awake! Thieves! Signor!

28
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,900
Thieves! Look to your house,
your daughter and your bags!

29
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,900
Signor Brabantio!
Ho!

30
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,400
- Awake!
- Sir!

31
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,000
Thieves! Look to your house, your
daughter and your bags!

32
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,800
Thieves! Thieves!

33
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,100
What is the reason
of this terrible summons?

34
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,300
What is the matter here?

35
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Signor...

36
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,300
...is all your family within?

37
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,900
I know you, Roderigo...

38
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,700
...and have charged thee
not to haunt about my doors.

39
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,300
In honest plainness,
thou has heard me say...

40
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,500
...my daughter is not for thee.

41
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,700
Are your doors locked?

42
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,800
Why? Wherefore ask you this?

43
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,900
Even now, now, very now...

44
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,600
...an old black ram
is tupping your white ewe.

45
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,800
What profane wretch art thou?

46
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,600
I am one
that comes to tell you...

47
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,800
...your daughter and the Moor are
making the beast with two backs.

48
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,000
Thou art a villain.

49
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,300
You are a senator.

50
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,600
This thou shalt answer, Roderigo.

51
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,800
Ay, sir!

52
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,900
I will answer anything.

53
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,800
But I beseech you,
straight satisfy yourself:

54
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,400
If she be in her chamber
or your house...

55
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,000
...let loose on me the justice
of the state for thus deluding you.

56
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,100
Strike on the tinder, ho!

57
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,400
Give me a taper!
Call up all my people!

58
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,700
This accident is not unlike my dream.

59
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,300
Belief of it oppresses me already.

60
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Light, I say!

61
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,300
Light!

62
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,300
Get weapons, ho!

63
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,400
Farewell, for I must leave you.

64
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,600
The goodness of the night
upon you, friends.

65
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,200
I pray you, sir,
are you fast married?

66
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Sir, you've been hotly called for.

67
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,900
Have with you.

68
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,300
- Halt!
- You!

69
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,200
IKeep up your bright swords,
for the dew will rust them.

70
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,400
O, thou foul thief!

71
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,700
Where hast thou stowed my daughter?

72
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,400
Damned as thou art,
thou hast enchanted her...

73
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,300
...to run from her garden to the sooty
bosom of such a thing as thou.

74
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,200
Lay hold upon him.

75
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,100
Hold your hands...

76
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,800
...both you of my inclining
and the rest.

77
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,400
Were it my cue to fight, I should have
known it without a prompter.

78
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,500
Good signor...

79
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,600
...where will you that I go
to answer this, your charge?

80
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,100
To prison...

81
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,500
...till fit time of law and course of
direct session call thee to answer.

82
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
What if I do obey?

83
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,400
How may the Duke
be therewith satisfied...

84
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,900
...whose messengers are
here about my side to bring me to him?

85
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,700
'Tis true,
most worthy signor.

86
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,900
The Duke's in council, and your
noble self, surely, is sent for.

87
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,200
How? The Duke in council?
In this time of night?

88
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,200
Bring him away.

89
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,900
Valiant Othello...

90
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,900
...we must straight employ you
against the general Turkish foe.

91
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,700
Welcome, gentle signor.

92
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,700
We lacked your counsel
and your help tonight.

93
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,300
So did I yours.

94
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,400
Good Your Grace, pardon me.

95
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,000
Neither my place,
nor aught I heard of business...

96
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,200
...has raised me from my bed.

97
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,300
My daughter!

98
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,800
O, my daughter!

99
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,900
Dead?

100
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,000
She is abused,
stolen from me and corrupted.

101
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,300
For nature so preposterously to err,
sans witchcraft could not.

102
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,600
Whoever he be
that in this foul proceeding...

103
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,600
...hath thus beguiled your daughter
of herself, and you of her...

104
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,400
...the bloody book of law you
shall yourself read...

105
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,500
...in the bitter letter after
your own sense.

106
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,100
Humbly, I thank Your Grace.

107
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,100
Here is the man.

108
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,800
Othello?

109
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,500
What in your own part can you
say to this?

110
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,100
Nothing, but this is so.

111
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,100
Most potent, grave
and reverend signors...

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,400
...my very noble
and approved good masters...

113
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,400
...that I have taken away this
old man's daughter...

114
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,400
...'tis most true.
True, I have married her.

115
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,900
The very head and front of my offending
hath this extent, no more.

116
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Rude am I in my speech...

117
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,300
...and little blessed
with the soft phrase of peace.

118
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,400
For since these arms of mine
had seven years' pith...

119
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,500
...till now some nine moons wasted...

120
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,800
...they have used their dearest action
in the tented field.

121
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,800
And little of this great world
can I speak...

122
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,200
...more than pertains to feats
of broil and battle.

123
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,200
Therefore, little shall I
grace my cause...

124
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,500
...in speaking of myself.
Yet, by your gracious patience...

125
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,700
...I will a round,
unvarnished tale deliver...

126
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,100
...of my whole course of love:

127
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,600
What drugs, what charms...

128
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,900
...what conjuration
and what mighty magic...

129
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,800
- for such proceedings am I
charged withal... I won his daughter.

130
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,600
A maiden never bold...

131
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,300
...of spirit so still and quiet
that her motion blushed at herself...

132
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,700
...and she, in spite of nature,
to fall in love...

133
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,700
...with what she feared to look on!

134
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
I do beseech you, send for the lady...

135
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,200
...and let her speak of me
before her father.

136
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,700
If you do find me foul in her report...

137
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,600
...the trust, the office I do hold
of you, not only take away...

138
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,300
...but let your sentence even
fall upon my life.

139
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,900
Fetch Desdemona.

140
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,500
Her father loved me...

141
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,600
...oft invited me...

142
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,600
...still questioned me the story
of my life from year to year...

143
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,000
...the battles, sieges, fortunes
that I have passed.

144
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,300
Even from my boyish days...

145
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,100
...to the moment
he bade me tell it.

146
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,600
Wherein I spoke of
most disastrous chances...

147
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,100
...of moving accidents by
flood and field...

148
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,500
...hair-breadth escapes
in the imminent deadly breach...

149
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,600
...of being taken by the insolent foe...

150
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,300
...and sold to slavery.

151
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,900
And of the cannibals that
each other eat...

152
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,700
...the Anthropophagi...

153
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,300
...and men whose heads do grow
beneath their shoulders.

154
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,700
These things to hear
would Desdemona seriously incline.

155
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,700
And with a greedy ear
devour up my discourse...

156
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,700
...which I observing...

157
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,200
...took once a pliant hour...

158
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,600
...and found means to draw
from her a prayer of earnest heart...

159
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,200
...which I would
all my pilgrimage dilate.

160
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,500
She gave me for my pains...

161
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,600
...a world of sighs.

162
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,000
She swore, in faith, 'twas strange...

163
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,400
...'twas passing strange,
'twas pitiful...

164
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,500
...'twas wondrous pitiful.

165
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,500
She loved me
for the dangers I had passed...

166
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,600
...and I loved her
that she did pity them.

167
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,100
This only is
the witchcraft I have used.

168
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,200
Come hither, gentle mistress.

169
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,900
Do you perceive in all this company
where most you owe obedience?

170
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
My noble father...

171
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,800
...to you I am bound
for life and education.

172
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,000
My life and education both
do learn me how to respect you.

173
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,900
You are lord of all my duty.

174
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,800
I am hitherto your daughter.

175
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,000
But here's my husband.

176
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,300
And so much duty
as my mother showed to you...

177
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,700
...preferring you before her father...

178
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,200
...so much I challenge
that I may profess due to the Moor...

179
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,800
...my lord.

180
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,300
God by you! I have done.

181
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,100
I had rather to adopt a child
than get it.

182
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,100
Come hither, Moor.

183
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,100
I here do give thee that
with all my heart...

184
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,800
...which, but thou hast already...

185
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,800
...with all my heart I would
keep from thee.

186
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,700
I humbly beseech you, proceed
with the affairs of state.

187
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,200
The Turk, with a mighty preparation,
makes for Cyprus.

188
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,500
Othello...

189
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,800
...you must away tonight.

190
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,400
The affair cries haste,
and speed must answer it.

191
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,900
Most gracious Duke...

192
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,900
What would you, Desdemona?

193
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,500
That I did love the Moor
to live with him...

194
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,100
...my downright violence
and scorn of fortunes...

195
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,300
...may trumpet to the world.

196
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,800
My heart is subdued even to
the utmost pleasure of my lord.

197
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,600
I saw Othello's visage in his mind...

198
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,900
...and to his honors
and his valiant parts...

199
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,400
...did I my soul
and fortunes consecrate.

200
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,300
So that, dear lords...

201
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,300
...if I be left behind, a moth of peace,
and he go to the war...

202
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,600
...the rites for which I love him
are bereft me.

203
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,200
And I, a heavy interim,
shall support by his dear absence.

204
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,000
Let me go with him.

205
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,200
Let her have your voice.

206
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,200
And heaven defend your good souls...

207
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,100
...that you think I will your serious
business scant for she is with me.

208
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,200
Be it as you shall privately determine.

209
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,800
At 9 in the morning,
here we'll meet again.

210
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
Good night to everyone.

211
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,300
And, noble signor...

212
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,500
...if virtue no delighted beauty lack...

213
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,300
...your son-in-law
is far more fair than black.

214
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,000
Look to her, Moor,
if thou hast eyes to see.

215
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,700
She has deceived her father
and may thee.

216
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,100
My life upon her faith!

217
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,900
Good lago, my Desdemona
must I leave to thee.

218
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,900
Let thy wife attend on her, and bring
them after in the best advantage.

219
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,400
Come, we must obey the time.

220
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,800
Lago!

221
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,400
What sayest thou, noble heart?

222
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,800
What will I do, thinkest thou?

223
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,900
Why, go to bed and sleep.

224
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,200
I will incontinently drown myself.

225
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,600
If thou dost,
I shall never love thee after.

226
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,900
Why, thou silly gentleman!

227
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It is silliness to live
when to live is a torment.

228
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,300
Desdemona!

229
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,900
Villainous!

230
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,600
I've looked upon the world for
four times seven years...

231
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,400
...and I never yet found a man that
knew how to love himself.

232
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,200
Ere I would say I would drown myself
for the love of a guinea hen...

233
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,300
...l'd change my humanity with a baboon.
- What should I do?

234
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,200
I confess it is my shame
to be so fond...

235
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,500
...but it is not in my virtue
to amend it.

236
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,100
Virtue? A fig.

237
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,600
'Tis in ourselves
that we are thus or thus.

238
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,600
We have reason
to cool our raging motions...

239
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,400
...our carnal stings, our
unbitted lusts...

240
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,700
...whereof I take this, which you call
love, to be a sect or scion.

241
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,000
It cannot be!

242
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,000
It is merely a lust of the blood
and a permission of the will.

243
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,500
Come, be a man!

244
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,900
Drown thyself?

245
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,300
Drown cats and blind puppies.

246
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,200
I have professed me thy friend
and I confess me...

247
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,000
...knit to thy deserving with cables
of perdurable toughness.

248
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,700
I could never
better stead thee than now.

249
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,100
Put money in thy purse.

250
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,200
Follow thou these wars.

251
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,200
Disguise thy features with
an usurped beard.

252
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,000
I say, put money in thy purse.

253
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,900
It cannot be that Desdemona should
long continue her love to the Moor.

254
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
Put but money in thy purse.

255
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
When she's sated with his body,
she'll find the error of her choice.

256
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,700
She must have change, she must.

257
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Fill thy purse with money.

258
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,300
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian...

259
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,000
...and a super-subtle Venetian
be not too hard for my wits...

260
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,700
...and all the tribe of hell...

261
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,900
...thou shall enjoy her.

262
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,100
Therefore, put...

263
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,700
"Money in thy purse."

264
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,100
A pox on drowning, huh?

265
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,800
'Tis clean out of the way.

266
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,600
Seek thou rather to be hanged
in compassing thy joy...

267
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,100
...than to be drowned
and go without her.

268
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,300
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes?

269
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,000
Thou art sure of me.

270
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,500
There are many events in
the womb of time...

271
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,300
...which will be delivered.

272
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,800
Go, provide thy money.

273
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,400
We will have more of this tomorrow.
Adieu.

274
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,500
Where shall we meet in the morning?

275
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,500
- At my lodging.
- All right.

276
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,400
- I'll be with thee betimes.
- Go to, farewell.

277
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,700
Does thou hear?

278
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
What say thou?

279
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,100
No more of drowning, do you hear?

280
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I am changed.

281
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,700
Go to, farewell.
Put money enough in your purse!

282
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,700
I'll sell all my land.

283
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,200
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.

284
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,000
For I mine own gained knowledge
should profane...

285
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,900
...if I would time
expend with such a snipe...

286
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,400
...but for my sport and profit.

287
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,200
I hate the Moor...

288
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,500
...and it is thought abroad that
'twixt my sheets...

289
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,900
...he's done my office.

290
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,100
I know not if it be true...

291
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,400
...but I, for mere suspicion
in that kind...

292
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,900
...will do as if for surety.

293
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,600
He holds me well...

294
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,800
...the better shall my purpose
work on him.

295
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,800
Cassio's a proper man.

296
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,800
Let me see now...
To get his place...

297
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,700
...and to plume up my will
in double knavery...

298
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,500
How?

299
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,500
How?

300
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,600
I have it.

301
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,800
It is engendered.

302
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,800
Hell and night...

303
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,300
...must bring this monstrous birth
to the world's light.

304
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,400
- Hail to thee, lady.
- Thank you, valiant Cassio.

305
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,400
Very good.
Ay, well said, whisper.

306
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,900
With as little a web as this,
will I ensnare...

307
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
...as great a fly as Cassio.

308
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,900
O, my fair warrior!

309
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,000
My dear Othello!

310
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,000
It gives me wonder great as my content
to see you here before me.

311
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,300
O my soul's joy!

312
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,100
I cannot speak enough of this content.
It stops me here.

313
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,700
It is too much of joy.

314
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,600
News, friends:

315
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,700
Our wars are done,
the Turks are drowned!

316
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,700
This desperate storm
hath seen a grievous wrack...

317
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,200
...and sufferance
on most part of their fleet.

318
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,800
Worthy Montano.

319
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,200
How does my old acquaintance
of this isle?

320
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,800
Honey, you shall be
well desired in Cyprus.

321
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,300
I have found great love amongst them.

322
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,100
O, you are well tuned now!

323
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,000
But I'll set down the pegs that
make this music, as honest as I am.

324
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,000
If thou be'st valiant... as they say
base men being in love have then...

325
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,900
...a nobility in their nature
more than is native to them... list me.

326
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,600
The lieutenant tonight watches
on the court of guard.

327
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,200
First, I must tell thee this:

328
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,200
Desdemona is directly in love with him.

329
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,000
With Cassio?

330
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,200
Why, 'tis not possible!

331
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Lay thy finger thus,
and let thy soul be instructed.

332
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,100
Mark me. Her eye must be fed.

333
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,500
What delight shall she have
to look on the devil?

334
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,400
Her delicate tenderness has
found itself abused...

335
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,600
...begun to heave the gorge,
disrelish and abhor the Moor.

336
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,000
Her nature instructs her to it,
and compels her to some second choice.

337
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,500
I cannot believe that.
She is full of most blessed condition.

338
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,100
Blessed fig's-end!

339
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,600
The wine she drinks is made of grapes.

340
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,600
If she were blessed, she would never
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding.

341
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,200
Didst thou not see her paddle
with his hand?

342
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,700
Didst thou not mark that?

343
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,200
- But that was but courtesy.
- Lechery, by this hand...

344
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,200
...an index and obscure prologue...

345
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,800
...to the history
of lust and foul thoughts.

346
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,400
They met so near with their lips
that their breaths embraced together.

347
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,200
Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!

348
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,100
When these mutualities
so marshal the way...

349
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,100
...hard at hand comes the master...

350
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,800
...and main exercise,
the incorporate conclusion.

351
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,500
But sir, be you ruled by me.
I have brought you from Venice.

352
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,400
Watch you with the guard tonight...

353
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,900
...for the command I'll lay it upon you.
I'll not be far from you.

354
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,600
Do you find some occasion
to anger Cassio.

355
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,300
Well...

356
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Welcome, lago.
We must to the watch.

357
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,200
Not this hour, lieutenant.
'Tis not yet 10 of the clock.

358
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,100
Our general cast us thus early for
the love of his Desdemona...

359
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,000
...who let us not therefore blame.

360
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,800
He hath not yet...

361
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,500
...made wanton the night with her,
and she is sport for Jove.

362
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,200
She's a most exquisite lady.

363
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,400
And I'll warrant her, full of game.

364
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,300
She is indeed perfection.

365
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,500
Well...

366
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,300
...happiness to their sheets!

367
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,100
Come, I have a stoop of wine...

368
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,400
...and here without are
a brace of Cyprus gallants...

369
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,600
...that would have a measure to
the health of black Othello.

370
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,300
Not tonight, good lago.

371
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,400
I have very poor and unhappy
brains for drinking.

372
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,900
I could well wish courtesy
would invent...

373
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,200
...some other custom of entertainment.

374
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,900
They are our friends.

375
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,900
But one cup?
I'll drink for you.

376
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,600
I have drunk a cup tonight already and
dare not task my weakness with anymore.

377
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,200
What, man!
'Tis a night of revels.

378
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,500
The gallants desire it.

379
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,100
Where are they?

380
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,800
If I can fasten
but one cup upon him...

381
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,300
The purchase made...

382
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,700
...the fruits are to ensue...

383
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,400
...that profit's yet to come
between me and you.

384
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,900
Is your Englishman so expert
in his drinking?

385
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Why, he drinks you with facility,
your Dane dead drunk.

386
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,100
He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.

387
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,100
And he gives your Hollander a vomit
ere the next pottle can be filled.

388
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,600
Health to our general!

389
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,900
I am for it, lieutenant...

390
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,700
...and I'll do you justice.

391
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,000
Sweet England!

392
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,900
Save you, friend Cassio.

393
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,500
Well, how is it with you, most fair...?

394
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,100
Bianca.

395
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,100
Let be gallantly!

396
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,000
He was a wight of high renown

397
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,700
And thou art but of low degree

398
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,500
'Tis pride that pulls the country down

399
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:43,600
Then take thine auld cloak...

400
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,200
...about thee

401
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,000
Let's have no more of this.

402
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,600
Let's to our affairs.

403
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
God forgive us our sins.

404
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,500
Gentlemen, let's look to our business.

405
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,000
Do not think, gentlemen,
that I am drunk.

406
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,900
This is my ensign.

407
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,800
This is my right hand.

408
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,200
This is my left hand.

409
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
I am not drunk now.

410
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
I can stand well enough...

411
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,200
...and I speak well enough.

412
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,000
- Excellent well.
- Why, very well.

413
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,500
You must not think then
that I am drunk.

414
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,700
To the platform, masters.
Come, let's set the watch.

415
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,000
You see this fellow that is gone before?

416
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,700
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
and give direction.

417
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,900
And do but see his vice.

418
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,000
But is he often thus?

419
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,500
'Tis evermore the prologue
to his sleep.

420
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,600
- What's the matter, lieutenant?
- A knave teach me my duty!

421
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,800
I'll beat the knave
into a twiggen bottle.

422
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,600
- Beat me!
- Dost thou prate, rogue?

423
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,800
Nay, good lieutenant.

424
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,700
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

425
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,000
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you
over the mazzard.

426
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,200
Come, come...

427
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,900
...you're drunk.

428
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Drunk?

429
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,600
Nay, good lieutenant.

430
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,300
God's will, gentlemen!

431
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,900
Good lieutenant, hold!

432
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,000
Mutiny!

433
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,100
Mutiny!

434
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,900
Help, ho! Lieutenant!

435
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,600
God's will, lieutenant.
Hold!

436
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,300
Hold, for your lives!

437
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,500
Hold, for shame!

438
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,600
What's the matter here?!

439
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,500
Are we turned Turks?!

440
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,700
For Christian shame,
put by this barbarous brawl.

441
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,900
He who stirs next
to carve for his own rage...

442
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,400
...holds his soul light.

443
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,300
He dies upon his motion.

444
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,700
What is the matter, masters?

445
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,800
Michael...

446
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,400
...how comes it you are thus forgot?

447
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,000
I pray you, pardon me, sir!

448
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,300
I cannot speak.

449
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,000
Worthy Montano...

450
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,200
...what is the matter that
you unlace your reputation thus...

451
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,400
...and spend your rich opinion for
the name of a night-brawler?

452
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,300
- Give me answer to it.
- Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.

453
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,400
Your officer, lago, can inform you,
while I spare speech...

454
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,800
...of all that I do know.

455
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,700
Now, by heaven, my blood begins
my safer guides to rule.

456
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,800
On thy love I charge thee, lago.
Who began it?

457
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,100
If partially affined or
leagued in office...

458
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,400
...thou dost deliver more
or less than truth...

459
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,400
...thou art no soldier.

460
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,400
Touch me not so near!
I had rather cut this tongue...

461
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,800
...than it should do offense
to Michael Cassio.

462
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,900
Yet to speak the truth
shall nothing wrong him.

463
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,400
This it is, general:

464
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,800
Montano and myself being in speech,
comes a fellow crying for help...

465
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,800
...and Cassio following him with
determined sword to execute upon him.

466
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,800
Sir, this gentleman steps in
to Cassio...

467
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,700
- but more of this matter
can I not report.

468
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,200
But men are men.
The best sometime forget.

469
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,300
Though Cassio did
some little wrong to him...

470
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,100
...as men in rage strike those
that wish them best...

471
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,100
...yet surely Cassio...

472
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:21,800
I know, lago, thy honesty and love
doth mince this matter...

473
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,800
...making it light to Cassio.

474
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,200
Cassio...

475
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:51,200
...he that you hurt
is of great fame in Cyprus...

476
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,100
...and great affinity.

477
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,700
I love thee...

478
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,100
...but nevermore be officer of mine.

479
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,900
What is the matter, dear?

480
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Look, if my gentle love
be not raised up.

481
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,400
I'll make thee an example.

482
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,100
All's well now, sweeting.
Come away to bed.

483
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,900
Look with care about the town...

484
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,700
...and silence those
whom this vile brawl distracted.

485
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Come, sweet Desdemona.

486
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,300
- Are you hurt, lieutenant?
- Ay, past all surgery.

487
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,600
- Marry, God forbid!
- I have lost my reputation.

488
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,600
I have lost the immortal
part of myself...

489
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,300
...and what remains is bestial.

490
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,600
My reputation, lago!

491
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,600
My reputation!

492
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,600
I thought you'd received some wound.

493
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,600
There's more offense in that
than in reputation.

494
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,900
What, man! There are ways
to recover the general again.

495
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,500
You are but now cast in his mood...

496
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,800
...a punishment more in policy
than in malice.

497
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,500
Sue to him again, and he's yours.

498
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,400
I would rather sue to be despised...

499
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,300
...than to deceive
so good a commander...

500
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,300
...with so slight, so drunken and
so indiscreet an officer.

501
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,600
He that you followed...

502
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,200
...what had he done to you?
- I know not.

503
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,200
Is it possible?

504
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,100
Drunk!

505
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,000
Wine is a good
familiar creature, if it be well used.

506
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,500
Exclaim no more against it.

507
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,800
And good lieutenant...

508
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,100
...I think you think I love you.

509
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,300
I have well approved it, sir.

510
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,500
I'll tell you what you shall do.

511
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,800
Our general's wife is now the general.

512
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,100
Confess yourself freely to Desdemona.

513
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,500
Importune her. She'll help
to put you in your place again.

514
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,500
This broken joint
between you and her husband...

515
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,300
...entreat her to splinter.

516
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,800
And my fortunes
against any lay worth naming...

517
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,200
...this crack of your love shall
grow stronger than it was before.

518
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,400
You advise me well.

519
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,300
I protest, in the sincerity of love
and honest kindness.

520
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,200
I think it freely.

521
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,100
Good night, lieutenant.

522
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
I must to the watch.

523
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,800
Good night, honest lago.

524
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,600
How am I then a villain...

525
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,200
...when this advice is free I give
and honest...

526
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,300
...probal to thinking, and indeed
the course to win the Moor again?

527
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,700
His soul is so enfettered
to Desdemona's love...

528
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,300
...that she may make, unmake,
do what she list...

529
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,400
...even as her appetite shall
play the god with his weak function.

530
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,800
How am I then a villain
to counsel Cassio...

531
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,900
...to this parallel course,
directed to his good?

532
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,300
Divinity of hell!

533
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,000
When devils will the blackest sins
put on, they do suggest at first...

534
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,300
...with heavenly shows, as I do now.

535
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,000
For whiles this honest fool plies
Desdemona to repair his fortunes...

536
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,200
...and she for him
pleads strongly to the Moor...

537
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,800
...l'll pour this pestilence
into his ear...

538
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,700
...that she repeals him for
her body's lust...

539
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,800
...and by how much she strives
to do him good...

540
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:22,300
...she shall undo her credit
with the Moor.

541
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,700
So will I turn her virtue...

542
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,600
...into pitch.

543
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,000
And out of her own goodness...

544
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
...make the net...

545
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,100
...that shall...

546
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,200
...enmesh them all.

547
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,300
How now, Roderigo?

548
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,500
I do follow here in the chase...

549
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,400
...not like a hound that hunts...

550
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,300
...but one that fills up the cry.

551
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,200
My money is almost spent.

552
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,200
I have been tonight
exceedingly well-cudgeled.

553
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,000
And I think the issue will be...

554
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,300
...that I shall have
so much experience for my pains.

555
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,700
And so...

556
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,200
...with no money at all and
a little more wit...

557
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,800
...return again to Venice.

558
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,200
How poor are they
that have not patience.

559
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,700
What wound did ever heal
but by degrees?

560
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,600
Thou knowest we work by wit...

561
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,500
...and not by witchcraft.

562
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,900
And wit depends on dilatory time.

563
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,300
Does it not go well?

564
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,200
Cassio hath beaten thee.

565
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,200
And thou, by that small hurt...

566
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,400
...hath cashiered Cassio.

567
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,100
Content thyself awhile.

568
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,800
By the mass, 'tis morning.

569
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,400
Pleasure and action
make the hours seem short.

570
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,400
Retire thee awhile.

571
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,900
Away, I say.

572
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,600
Thou shalt know more hereafter.

573
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,900
Nay, get thee gone.

574
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,200
Bounteous madam...

575
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,300
...whatever shall become of
Michael Cassio?

576
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,100
- He's never anything but your servant.
- I know it.

577
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,600
I thank you.

578
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,100
Madam, here comes my lord.

579
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,200
- I like not that.
- What dost thou say?

580
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,600
Nothing, my lord.

581
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,600
- Madam, I take my leave.
- Farewell.

582
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,200
Was not that Cassio
parted from my wife?

583
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,300
Cassio, my lord.

584
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,400
How now, my lord?

585
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,300
I have been talking with
a suitor here...

586
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,500
...a man that languishes in
your displeasure.

587
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,100
Who is it you mean?

588
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,200
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.

589
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,200
Good my lord, if he be not one
that truly loves you...

590
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,000
...I have no judgment in an honest face.

591
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,900
Excellent wretch!

592
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,100
Perdition catch my soul,
but I do love thee!

593
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,400
And when I love thee not...

594
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,300
...chaos is come again.

595
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,700
- My noble lord...
- What dost thou say, lago?

596
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,200
Did Cassio, when you wooed
my lady, know of your love?

597
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,000
He did, from first to last.

598
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,200
Why dost thou ask?

599
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,600
But for a satisfaction of my thought...
No further harm.

600
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,900
Why of thy thought, lago?

601
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,500
I did not think he had been
acquainted with her.

602
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,000
O, yes.

603
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,400
And went between us very oft.

604
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,300
- Indeed!
- Indeed?

605
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,300
Ay, indeed.

606
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,700
Discernest thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

607
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,100
Honest, my lord?

608
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,100
Honest? Ay, honest.

609
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,100
My lord, for aught I know.

610
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,000
- What dost thou think?
- Think, my lord?

611
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,800
"Think, my lord"!
By heaven, he echoes me.

612
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,500
Thou dost mean something.

613
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,600
If thou dost love me,
show me thy thought.

614
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,100
- My lord, you know I love you.
- I think thou dost.

615
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,700
And for I know
thou art full of love...

616
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,200
...and honesty...

617
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,400
...and weighest thy words
before thou givest them breath.

618
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,200
Therefore, these stops of thine
fright me the more.

619
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,100
For Cassio, I dare be sworn
I think that he is honest.

620
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,800
I think so too.

621
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,400
Men should be what they seem.

622
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,900
Or those that be not,
would they might seem none.

623
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,800
Certain, men should be
what they seem.

624
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,400
Why then, I think Cassio's
an honest man.

625
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,200
Nay, yet there's more in this!

626
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,600
I prithee, speak to me as to
thy thinkings.

627
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,300
As thou dost ruminate, give thy
worst of thoughts the worst of words.

628
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,300
I do beseech you...

629
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:37,600
Though I perchance am
vicious in my guess...

630
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,700
...as I confess, it is my
nature's plague to spy into abuses...

631
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,900
...and oft my jealousy...

632
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,500
...shapes faults that are not.

633
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I entreat you then, it were not for
your quiet nor your good...

634
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:56,000
...nor for my manhood, honesty and
wisdom to let you know my thoughts.

635
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,500
What dost thou mean?

636
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,500
Good name in man and woman,
dear my lord...

637
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,900
...is the immediate jewel
of their souls.

638
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,500
Who steals my purse,
steals trash.

639
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,700
'Tis something, nothing.
'Twas mine, 'tis his...

640
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,900
...has been slave to thousands.

641
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,200
But he that filches from me
my good name...

642
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,800
...robs me of that
which not enriches him...

643
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,400
...and makes me poor indeed.

644
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,500
By heaven, I'll know thy thought.

645
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,300
You cannot, if my heart
were in your hand.

646
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,300
Nor shall not,
while 'tis in my custody.

647
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,600
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!

648
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,000
'Tis the green-eyed monster
that doth mock the meat it feeds on.

649
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,500
Why?

650
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,900
Why is this?

651
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,500
Thinkest thou I'd make
a life of jealousy...

652
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,800
...to follow still the changes of
the moon with fresh suspicions? No!

653
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,200
To be once in doubt
is once to be resolved.

654
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,300
Nor from mine own weak merits
shall I draw...

655
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,200
...the smallest fear or doubt of her
revolt, for she had eyes and chose me.

656
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,200
No, lago...

657
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,100
...l'll see before I doubt.
When I doubt, prove.

658
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,200
And on the proof,
there is no more but this:

659
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,500
Away at once with love or jealousy.

660
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,200
I am glad, for now I have reason...

661
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,400
...to show the love and duty
that I bear you with franker spirit.

662
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,500
Therefore, as I am bound,
receive it from me.

663
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,100
I speak not yet of proof.

664
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,200
Look to your wife.

665
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,000
Observe her well with Cassio.

666
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,400
Look to it.

667
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,700
I know our country disposition well.

668
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,500
In Venice, they do
let heaven see the pranks...

669
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,600
...they dare not show their husbands.

670
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,200
Their best conscience
is not to leave it undone...

671
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,200
...but keep it unknown.

672
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,000
- Dost thou say so?
- She did deceive her father.

673
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,700
And when she seemed to fear your looks,
she loved them most.

674
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,400
- And so she did.
- Why, go to then.

675
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,100
But I am much to blame.

676
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,100
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
for too much loving you.

677
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,100
I am bound to thee forever.

678
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,900
I see this hath dashed your spirits.

679
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,700
- Not a jot, not a jot.
- In faith, I fear it has.

680
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,200
I hope you consider what is spoke
comes from my love.

681
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,200
But I do see you're moved.

682
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,700
I am to pray you not to strain
my speech to grosser issues...

683
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,900
...nor to larger reach than
to suspicion.

684
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,700
Should you do so, my lord...

685
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,700
...my speech should fall into vile
success as my thoughts aimed not at.

686
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,400
Cassio's my worthy friend...
My lord, you're moved.

687
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,800
No, not much moved!

688
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,800
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

689
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,000
Long live she so.
And long live you to think so.

690
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:00,100
And yet, how nature erring from itself...

691
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,800
Ay, there's the point!

692
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,300
As to be bold not to enter
into a marriage...

693
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,000
...of her own clime, complexion
and degree...

694
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,000
...whereto we see in all things
nature tends...

695
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,800
One may smell in such
a will most rank...

696
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:17,800
...foul disproportion,
thoughts unnatural.

697
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,700
But pardon me. I do not in position
distinctly speak of her.

698
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,300
Though I may fear, her will,
recoiling to her better judgment...

699
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,500
...may fall to match you with
her country forms...

700
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,500
...and happily repent.

701
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,700
Farewell, farewell.

702
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,300
If more thou dost perceive,
let me know more.

703
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,000
Leave me, lago.

704
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,200
My lord, I take my leave.

705
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,900
Why did I marry?

706
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,800
My lord, I would
I might entreat your honor...

707
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,200
...to scan this thing no farther.

708
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,300
Leave it to time.

709
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,200
Let me be thought too busy
in my fears...

710
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,300
- as worthy cause
I have to fear I am...

711
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,700
- and hold her free.

712
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,400
Fear not my government.

713
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,600
That we can call
these delicate creatures ours...

714
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,300
...and not their appetites!

715
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,900
How now, my dear Othello!

716
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,800
Your dinner and the generous
islanders by you invited...

717
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,000
...do attend your presence.

718
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,300
- I am to blame.
- Why do you speak so faintly?

719
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,700
Are you not well?

720
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,500
Come, I'll go with you.

721
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,800
I have a thing for you.

722
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,300
You have a thing for me?

723
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,400
It is a common thing
to have a foolish wife.

724
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,100
O, is that all?

725
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,400
What will you give me for
that handkerchief?

726
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,100
What handkerchief?

727
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,200
What handkerchief?

728
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Why, that the Moor
first gave to Desdemona...

729
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,500
...that which so often you did
bid me steal.

730
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,500
Hast stolen it from her?

731
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,500
No, faith.

732
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,400
She let it drop by negligence.

733
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,400
What will you do with it,
that you've been so earnest...

734
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,200
...to have me filch it?

735
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,600
Trifles light as air...

736
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:47,700
...are to the jealous confirmations
strong as proofs of holy writ.

737
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,600
This may do something.

738
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:32,000
My life upon her faith.

739
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,800
If she be false...

740
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,200
...heaven mocks itself.

741
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,600
I'll not believe it.

742
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:53,300
Look to her, Moor,
if thou hast eyes to see.

743
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,400
She has deceived her father...

744
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,200
...and may thee.

745
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,400
The Moor already changes
with my poison.

746
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,700
Dangerous conceits
are in their natures, poisons.

747
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,000
Which at the first
are scarce found to distaste.

748
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,700
But with a little
act upon the blood...

749
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,700
...burn like the mines of sulfur.

750
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,400
I did say so.

751
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,900
Look!

752
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,900
Not poppy, nor mandragora...

753
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,900
...nor all the drowsy syrups
of the world...

754
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,500
...shall ever medicine thee
to that sweet sleep...

755
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,200
...which thou owedst yesterday.

756
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,800
Why, how now, general!

757
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,800
Avaunt!

758
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,800
Be gone!

759
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,700
Thou hast set me on the rack.

760
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,500
I swear 'tis better to be much abused
than but to know it a little.

761
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:13,800
How now, my lord!

762
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,800
What sense had I
of her stolen hours of lust?

763
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:21,000
I saw it not, thought it not,
it harmed not me.

764
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,100
I found not Cassio's kisses
on her lips.

765
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,700
I am sorry to hear this.

766
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,400
I had been happy if the general camp,
pioneers and all...

767
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,000
...had tasted her sweet body,
so I had nothing known.

768
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Now forever farewell the tranquil mind!

769
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,500
Farewell content!

770
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,700
Farewell the plumed troop and
wars that make ambition virtue.

771
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,300
O, farewell!

772
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,900
Othello's occupation's gone.

773
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,100
Is it possible, my lord?

774
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,800
Villain, be sure
thou prove my love a whore!

775
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,900
Be sure of it.

776
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,900
Give me the ocular proof...

777
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,300
...or by the worth
of mine eternal soul...

778
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,900
...thou hadst been better
been born a dog...

779
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,200
...than answer my waked wrath!

780
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,000
Make me to see it...

781
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,900
...or at least, so prove it...

782
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,500
...that the probation bear no hinge...

783
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,400
...nor loop to hang a doubt on...

784
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,500
...or woe upon thy life!
- My noble lord!

785
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:12,500
If thou dost slander her
and torture me...

786
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,600
...never pray more,
abandon all remorse!

787
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,200
On horror's head, horrors accumulate!

788
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,100
Do deeds to make heaven weep...

789
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,600
...for nothing to damnation
canst thou add greater than that!

790
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,800
O grace!

791
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,700
O heaven defend me!

792
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,500
God buy you!
Take mine office.

793
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,600
To be direct and honest is not safe.

794
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,400
I thank you for this profit.
From hence, I'll love no friend...

795
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,900
...sith love breeds such offense!

796
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,900
Nay, stay!

797
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
- Thou shouldst be honest.
- I should be wise...

798
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,300
...for honesty's a fool,
and loses that it works for.

799
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,000
By the world,
I think my wife be honest...

800
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,100
...and I think that she is not.

801
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,300
I think that thou art just
and that thou art not.

802
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,600
I'll have some proof.
Would I were satisfied!

803
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,300
I see, sir,
you are eaten up with passion.

804
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,900
I do repent me that I put it to you.

805
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,500
- You would be satisfied?
- Would? Nay, I will.

806
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,800
And may. But how?
How satisfied?

807
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,600
Would you grossly gape on?
Behold her topped?

808
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,900
O, death and damnation!

809
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,400
It were a tedious difficulty
to bring them to that prospect.

810
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,000
Damn them then!
What shall I say?

811
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,800
Where's satisfaction?

812
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,300
You would not see this...

813
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,900
...were they as prime as goats,
as hot as monkeys...

814
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,300
But yet, I say, if imputation
and strong circumstances...

815
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:41,000
...which lead directly to the door of
truth will give you satisfaction...

816
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,800
...you might have it.

817
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,700
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

818
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,900
I do not like the office.

819
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
But sith I am entered in this cause...

820
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:54,900
...pricked to it by foolish honesty
and love, I will go on.

821
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,700
I lay with Cassio lately.

822
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:03,900
And being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.

823
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,100
There are a kind of men
so loose of soul...

824
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,500
...that in their sleeps will
mutter their affairs.

825
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,900
One of this kind is Cassio.

826
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,400
In sleep, I heard him say:

827
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:19,100
"Sweet Desdemona, let us be wary,
let us hide our loves."

828
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,300
And then, sir, would he grip
and wring my hand...

829
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,600
...cry, "Sweet creature!"
And then kiss me hard...

830
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,900
...as if he plucked kisses from
the roots upon my lips...

831
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,900
...then laid his leg over my thigh...

832
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,300
...and sighed and kissed
and cried:

833
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,800
"Cursed fate
that gave thee to the Moor!"

834
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,000
- O monstrous!
- Nay, this was but his dream.

835
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,700
- Monstrous!
- Nay, yet be wise...

836
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,600
...yet we see nothing done.

837
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,100
She may be honest yet.
Tell me but this:

838
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,800
Did you not see
a handkerchief...

839
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,900
...spotted with strawberries
in your wife's hand?

840
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,400
I gave her such a one.
'Twas my first gift.

841
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,700
I know not that.
But such a handkerchief...

842
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,400
...l'm sure it was your wife's...

843
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,600
...did I today see
Cassio wipe his beard with.

844
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,700
O, if it be that...

845
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,000
Where should I lose
that handkerchief, Emilia?

846
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,100
I know not, madam.

847
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:28,700
Believe me, I had rather lose
my purse full of crusadoes.

848
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,700
And, but my noble Moor
is true of mind...

849
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,300
...and made of no such baseness as
jealous creatures are...

850
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,100
...it were enough
to put him to ill thinking.

851
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,500
- Is he not jealous?
- Who, he?

852
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,800
How is it with you, my lord?

853
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,600
Well.

854
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,400
- And how do you, my lady?
- Well, my good lord.

855
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,100
That handkerchief did an Egyptian
to my mother give.

856
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:03,300
She was a charmer and could almost
read the thoughts of people.

857
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,300
She told her while she kept it,
'twould make her amiable...

858
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,100
...and subdue my father entirely
to her love.

859
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,600
But if she lost it
or made a gift of it...

860
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:15,600
...my father's eye
should hold her loathed...

861
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,400
...and his spirits should hunt
after new fancies.

862
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,900
She dying...

863
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,000
...gave it me...

864
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:26,100
...and bid me, when my fate would
have me wived...

865
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,300
...I give it her.

866
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,000
I did so.

867
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,400
And take heed on it.

868
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:35,200
Make it a darling
like your precious eye.

869
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,200
To lose it or give it away...

870
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,600
...were such perdition
as nothing else could match.

871
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,100
Is it possible?

872
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,900
'Tis true.

873
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,200
There's magic in the web of it.

874
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,900
Then would to God I had never seen it!

875
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,200
Wherefore?

876
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,000
Why do you speak
so startingly and rash?

877
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,100
Is it lost? Is it gone?
Is it out of the way?

878
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,800
Heaven bless us!

879
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,500
- Say you?
- It is not lost.

880
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,300
- But what an if it were?
- How?

881
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,100
I say it is not lost!

882
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,500
Fetch it.
Let me see it.

883
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,800
Why, so I can, sir.
But I will not now.

884
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,100
This is a trick
to put me from my suit.

885
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,100
I pray you,
let Cassio be received again.

886
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,200
Fetch me my handkerchief.
My mind misgives.

887
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,900
Come. You'll never meet
a more sufficient man.

888
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,500
- The handkerchief!
- I pray you, talk me of Cassio...

889
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,900
...a man that all his time hath founded
his good fortunes on your love.

890
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,000
The handkerchief!

891
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,100
In faith, you are to blame.

892
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,600
'Zounds!

893
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,700
Is not this man jealous?

894
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,700
I never saw this before.

895
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,800
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.

896
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,900
They are all but stomachs,
and we all but food.

897
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,100
They eat us hungrily.
And when they are full...

898
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,200
...they belch us.

899
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,900
If I give my wife a handkerchief...

900
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,500
...'tis hers, and being hers...

901
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,700
...she may, I think,
bestow it on any man.

902
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,100
What if I had said
I had seen him do you wrong?

903
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,900
Or heard him say...

904
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,700
Hath he said anything?

905
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,400
He hath, my lord.
But no more than he'll unswear.

906
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,700
- What hath he said?
- Faith, that he...

907
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,600
...did...

908
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,300
I know not what he did.

909
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
What?

910
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,200
What?

911
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,900
Lie...

912
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,100
With her?

913
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:49,200
With her...

914
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,200
...on her, what you will.

915
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,200
Lie with her?

916
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,100
Lie on her?

917
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,200
'Zounds, that's fulsome!

918
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,300
Work on, my medicine. Work!

919
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,900
Thus credulous fools are caught.

920
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,700
And many worthy and chaste dames,
even thus...

921
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,400
...all guiltless, meet reproach.

922
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,500
What ho, my lord?

923
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,200
My lord, I say! Othello!

924
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,900
What's the matter?

925
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,900
My lord is in an epilepsy.

926
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,100
This is his second fit.
He had one yesterday.

927
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,200
- Rub him about the temples.
- Forbear!

928
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,600
The lethargy
must have his quiet course.

929
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,700
If not, he foams at mouth and
breaks out to savage madness.

930
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:35,000
Look, he stirs.
Do you withdraw yourself a little.

931
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,800
He will recover straight.

932
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:41,300
When he is gone, I would
on great occasion speak with you.

933
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,300
How is it, general?

934
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,000
Did he confess it?

935
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,900
Have you not hurt your head?

936
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,700
Dost thou mock me?

937
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,800
I mock you?

938
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
No, by heaven.

939
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,200
Good sir, whilst you were here,
overwhelmed with your grief...

940
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,400
...Cassio came hither.

941
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,800
I shifted him away and
laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy...

942
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:15,000
...bade him anon return and here speak
with me, the which he promised.

943
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,300
Do but encave yourself...

944
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,600
...and mark the jeers, the gibes,
and notable scorns...

945
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,800
...that dwell in
every region of his face.

946
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,900
I will make him tell
the tale anew:

947
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,200
Where, how, how oft,
how long ago...

948
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:34,600
...and when he hath and is again
to cope your wife.

949
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,400
Marry, patience!

950
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,100
Now, will I question Cassio of Bianca.

951
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,100
He, when he hears of her...

952
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,700
...cannot refrain
from the excess of laughter.

953
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,800
How do you now, lieutenant?

954
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,700
As he shall smile...

955
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,700
...Othello...

956
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,400
...shall go mad.

957
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:57,100
You give me that same title,
whose want even kills me.

958
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,700
Ply Desdemona well
and you are sure on it.

959
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:05,700
Now, if this suit
lay in Bianca's power...

960
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,300
...how quickly should you speed!

961
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,100
Poor wretch!
I think, in faith, she loves me.

962
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,100
Look how he laughs already!

963
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,300
She says that you shall
marry her. Do you intend it?

964
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,900
I marry her? What?

965
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,500
I prithee, bear
some charity to my wit.

966
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,400
The cry goes that
you shall marry her.

967
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,100
- Prithee, say true.
- I am a very villain else.

968
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,900
This is the monkey's own giving out.

969
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,600
She hangs and lolls and weeps upon me.
So hales...

970
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,700
I see that nose of yours...

971
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,400
...but not that
dog I shall throw it to!

972
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,600
Before me!
Look, where she comes.

973
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,900
How is it with you,
most fair Bianca?

974
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,300
Whence came this?

975
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,000
This is some token from
a newer friend.

976
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,200
No, by my faith.

977
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:58,400
Why, whose is it?

978
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,400
I know not.
I found it in my chamber.

979
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,900
A likely story that you should
find it in your chamber...

980
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,700
...and not know who left it.

981
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,500
This is some minx's token.

982
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,200
There!

983
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:14,000
Give it to your hobbyhorse,
wheresoever you had it.

984
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
How now, my sweet Bianca!

985
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,200
How now, how now!

986
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,400
If you come to
supper tonight, you may.

987
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:31,200
If you do not, come
when you are next prepared for.

988
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,700
After her, after her.

989
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,300
Faith, I must.
She'll rail in the streets else.

990
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,400
- Will you sup there?
- I intend to.

991
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,400
I may chance to see you, for
I would fain speak with you.

992
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,600
- Prithee, come.
- Go to, say no more.

993
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,700
How shall I murder him, lago?

994
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:03,000
Did you perceive
how he laughed at his vice?

995
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,600
And did you see the handkerchief?

996
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,400
Damn her!

997
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,600
Lewd minx!

998
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,200
Damn her!

999
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,600
A fine woman, a fair woman,
a sweet woman!

1000
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,700
You must forget that.

1001
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:26,500
Let her perish, and be damned tonight,
for she shall not live.

1002
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,700
No, my heart is turned to stone.

1003
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,900
I strike it,
and it hurts my hand.

1004
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,200
But the pity of it, lago!
O, lago, the pity of it, lago!

1005
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,700
Nay, that's not your way.

1006
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,100
Damn her!

1007
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,200
- Cuckold me?
- O, 'tis foul in her.

1008
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:45,400
- And with mine officer!
- That's fouler.

1009
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,400
I'd have him nine years a-killing.

1010
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,600
Look here, lago.

1011
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,800
All my fond love thus...

1012
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:04,000
...do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.

1013
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,200
Arise, black vengeance, from
thy hollow cell.

1014
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,500
Yield up, O love, thy crown
and hearted throne to tyrannous hate.

1015
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:19,400
Now, by yond marble heaven...

1016
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,500
...in the due reverence
of a sacred vow...

1017
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,400
...I here engage my words.

1018
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,900
Witness, you ever-burning
lights above...

1019
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,600
...you elements
that clip us round about.

1020
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:37,800
Witness that here, lago doth give up...

1021
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,300
...the execution of his wit, hands...

1022
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:42,800
...heart...

1023
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,700
...to wronged Othello's service.

1024
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,600
Let him command.

1025
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,300
And to obey shall be
in me remorse...

1026
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,900
...what bloody business ever.

1027
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:13,000
I greet thy love.

1028
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:18,500
Get me some poison,
lago, this night.

1029
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,600
I'll not expostulate with her...

1030
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:23,600
...lest her body and beauty
unprovide my mind again.

1031
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,000
Do it not with poison.

1032
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:30,800
Strangle her in her bed,
even the bed she hath contaminated.

1033
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:35,300
Good, good, the justice of it pleases.
Very good.

1034
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:37,200
And for Cassio?

1035
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:40,400
Let me hear thee say,
Michael Cassio is not alive.

1036
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:47,100
My friend is dead.
You shall know more by midnight.

1037
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,800
Excellent. Good.

1038
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,900
Now art thou my lieutenant.

1039
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,500
I am your own...

1040
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,100
...forever.

1041
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,900
God save you, worthy general!

1042
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,600
With all my heart, sir.

1043
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,200
The Duke and Senators
of Venice greet you.

1044
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:22,000
I kiss the instrument of their pleasure.
Welcome, Signor Gratiano.

1045
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:33,800
What's the news, uncle?

1046
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,300
Good cousin Lodovico?

1047
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,400
I am glad to see you, signor.

1048
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,100
- Welcome to Cyprus.
- I thank you.

1049
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,300
How does Lieutenant Cassio?

1050
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,600
Lives, sir.

1051
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:51,200
Cousin...

1052
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:55,600
...there's fallen between him and
my lord an unkind breach.

1053
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,400
- But you shall make all well.
- Are you sure of that?

1054
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,000
- My lord?
- "This fail you not to do..."

1055
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:05,100
He did not call.
Is there division between my lord...

1056
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,200
...and Cassio?
- A most unhappy one.

1057
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,800
I would do much to atone them,
for the love I bear to Cassio.

1058
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,800
Fire and brimstone!

1059
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,000
My lord?

1060
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,100
Are you wise?

1061
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,100
What? Is he angry?

1062
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,800
Maybe the letter moved him.

1063
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:23,700
For as I think,
they do command him home...

1064
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,200
...deputing Cassio in his government.

1065
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,200
By my troth, I'm glad on it.

1066
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,600
Indeed!

1067
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,100
My lord?

1068
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,200
I am glad to see you mad.

1069
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,200
Why, sweet Othello?

1070
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,400
Devil!

1071
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,600
I have not deserved this.

1072
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,900
This would not be believed in Venice,
though I should swear I saw it.

1073
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:55,600
'Tis very much.
Make her amends. She weeps.

1074
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,300
If that the earth could teem with
women's tears, each drop she falls...

1075
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,900
...would prove a crocodile.

1076
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,400
Out of my sight!

1077
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,500
I would not stay to offend you.

1078
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,200
You have seen nothing then?

1079
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:18,600
- Nor ever heard, nor suspected.
- You've seen Cassio and she together.

1080
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:22,600
I saw no harm. I heard each syllable
that breath made up between them.

1081
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,700
- What! Did they never whisper?
- Never.

1082
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,100
Nor send you to fetch her fan,
her gloves, her mask, nothing?

1083
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,500
Never.

1084
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,500
That's strange.

1085
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,800
I durst, my lord, to wager she
is honest, lay down my soul at stake.

1086
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:40,500
If you think other, remove your thought.
It doth abuse your bosom.

1087
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,000
Bid her come hither.

1088
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,000
Go!

1089
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:50,600
She says enough, but she's a simple
bawd that cannot say as much.

1090
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,700
This is a subtle whore.

1091
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,600
But look, she comes.

1092
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,600
What is your pleasure?

1093
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,700
Let me see your eyes.

1094
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,400
Look in my face.

1095
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:08,200
What horrible fancy's this?

1096
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:10,800
What art thou?

1097
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,600
Your wife, my lord.
Your true and loyal wife.

1098
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:15,500
Come, swear it.

1099
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:19,800
Damn thyself.

1100
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,300
Swear thou art honest.

1101
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,800
Heaven doth truly know it.

1102
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,300
Heaven truly knows
thou art false as hell.

1103
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,800
To whom, my lord?

1104
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,500
With whom?

1105
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,500
How am I false?

1106
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:42,500
O, Desdemona!

1107
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:44,700
Away, away!

1108
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,300
Alas the heavy day!

1109
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,300
Why do you weep?

1110
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:58,300
Am I the motive
of these tears, my lord?

1111
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:01,500
Had it pleased heaven to
try me with affliction...

1112
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,000
...had they rained all kinds
of sores and shames on my bare head...

1113
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,900
...I should have found in some
place of my soul a drop ofpatience.

1114
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,400
But alas, there, where
I have garnered up my heart...

1115
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,900
...where either I must live
or bear no life...

1116
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:19,100
...the fountain from the which
my current runs or else dries up...

1117
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:23,900
...to be discarded or keep as a cistern
for foul toads to knot and gender in!

1118
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,900
O thou...

1119
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:29,000
...who art so lovely fair...

1120
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,500
...and smells so sweet
that the sense aches at thee.

1121
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,400
Wouldst thou had never been born!

1122
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,500
Alas, what ignorant
sin have I committed?

1123
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,000
Was this fair paper
made to write "whore" upon?

1124
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,500
- What committed! Lmpudent strumpet!
- By heaven, you do me wrong.

1125
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,000
- Are you not a strumpet?
- I am a Christian!

1126
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,100
What! Not a whore?

1127
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,000
- No, as I shall be saved.
- Is it possible?

1128
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,500
Heaven forgive us!

1129
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,200
I cry you mercy then.

1130
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:09,400
I took you for that cunning whore of
Venice that married with Othello.

1131
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,500
You, mistress...

1132
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,600
...who have the office opposite
St. Peter and keeps the gate of hell!

1133
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,500
You, you, ay, you!

1134
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,600
We have done our course.

1135
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,400
I pray you, turn the key,
and keep our counsel.

1136
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,700
Am I that name, lago?

1137
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,500
What name, fair lady?

1138
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:40,200
Such as my lord did say I was.

1139
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:42,100
He called her whore.

1140
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,500
Why did he so?

1141
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:45,600
I do not know.

1142
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,700
I am sure I am none such.

1143
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,100
Do not weep!

1144
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,800
Do not weep.

1145
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,800
Alas the day!

1146
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,400
Hath she forsook
so many noble matches...

1147
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:01,400
...her father, her country,
her friends to be called whore?

1148
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,700
Would it not make one weep?

1149
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,800
It is my wretched fortune.

1150
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,900
O, good lago...

1151
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:15,900
...what shall I do to win my lord again?

1152
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,100
Good friend...

1153
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:20,500
...go to him...

1154
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:25,500
...for by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him.

1155
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:28,700
Here I kneel:

1156
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:37,800
If ever my will did trespass
against his love...

1157
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:43,500
...either in discourse
of thought or actual deed...

1158
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:47,800
...or that mine eyes, mine ears...

1159
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:53,100
...or any sense, delighted
them in any other form...

1160
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:56,900
...or that I do not yet...

1161
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,200
...and ever did and ever will...

1162
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:05,000
...though he do shake me
off to beggarly divorcement...

1163
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,700
...love him dearly...

1164
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,000
...comfort forswear me!

1165
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:17,100
Unkindness may do much...

1166
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:21,200
...and his unkindness
may defeat my life...

1167
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,400
...but never taint my love.

1168
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,200
I cannot say "whore."

1169
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,500
It does abhor me now
I speak the word.

1170
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,400
To do the act that might
the addition earn...

1171
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:38,900
...not the world's mass
of vanity could make me!

1172
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,700
I pray you, be content.

1173
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:44,900
'Tis but his humor:

1174
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:49,300
The business of the state does him
offense, and he does chide with you.

1175
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:53,800
- Lf it were no other...
- It is so, I warrant.

1176
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,600
Hark, how these
instruments summon to supper!

1177
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:01,700
The messengers of Venice stay the meat.

1178
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,300
Go in and weep not.

1179
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,500
All things shall be well.

1180
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:29,800
- How now, Roderigo?
- Thou deals unjustly with me.

1181
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,700
- What in the contrary?
- Every day thou daffest me.

1182
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,500
I will no longer endure it.

1183
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:38,800
Nor am I persuaded to put up in
peace what already I've suffered.

1184
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,500
- Will you hear me?
- Your words and performance are not kin.

1185
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:45,700
- You charge me most unjustly.
- With nought but truth!

1186
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:52,100
I will make myself known to Desdemona.

1187
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,600
If she will return me my jewels...

1188
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,900
...I will give over my suit
and repent my unlawful solicitation.

1189
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,700
If not...

1190
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:13,000
...assure yourself, I will seek
satisfaction of you.

1191
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:17,000
You have said now.

1192
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:20,700
Ay, and said nothing but what
I protest intendment of doing.

1193
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,900
Why, now I see...

1194
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
...there's mettle in thee.

1195
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:30,900
And even from now do build on thee
a better opinion than before.

1196
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,900
Give me thy hand, Roderigo.

1197
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,200
Thou hast taken against me a just
exception. Yet, I protest...

1198
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:40,200
...l've dealt most justly in thy affair.
- It's not appeared.

1199
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,800
I grant that and your suspicions
are not without wit and judgment.

1200
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,700
But if thou hast
that in thee indeed...

1201
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,900
...which I have greater reason to
believe now...

1202
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,300
...I mean purpose, courage and valor,
this night show it.

1203
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:57,700
If thou the next night following
enjoy not Desdemona...

1204
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:02,600
...take me from this world
and devise engines on my life.

1205
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:07,400
Well...

1206
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:11,100
...what is it?

1207
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:25,500
This is the night that either
makes me or fordoes me quite.

1208
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,900
Trouble yourself no further, sir.

1209
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:52,200
O, pardon me.
It will do me good to walk.

1210
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,000
Desdemona!

1211
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:59,000
- My lord?
- Get thee to bed on the instant.

1212
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,100
I shall return forthwith.
Dismiss your attendant there.

1213
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,200
Look it be done.

1214
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,300
I will, my lord.

1215
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,800
Madam, good night.

1216
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:15,700
- I humbly thank your ladyship.
- Your honor is most welcome.

1217
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,300
Will you walk, sir?

1218
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:21,700
Dismiss me?

1219
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,300
'Twas his bidding.

1220
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,600
I would you'd never seen him.

1221
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,500
So would not I!

1222
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,500
Prithee...

1223
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,100
...unpin me here.

1224
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,600
The poor soul sat sighing

1225
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:04,700
By a sycamore tree

1226
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,100
My mother had a maid called Barbary.

1227
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,100
She was in love
and he she loved proved mad...

1228
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,200
...and did forsake her.

1229
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,500
She had a song of "Willow."

1230
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,700
An old thing it was,
but it expressed her fortune.

1231
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,700
And she died singing it.

1232
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,300
That song tonight
will not go from my mind.

1233
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:37,200
The poor soul sat sighing

1234
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,300
By a sycamore tree

1235
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:45,200
Sing willow, willow, willow

1236
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,900
Her hand on her bosom

1237
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,700
Her head on her knee

1238
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:57,100
Sing willow, willow, willow

1239
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:05,700
Her salt tears fell from her

1240
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:10,100
And softened the stones

1241
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:15,500
Sing willow, willow, willow

1242
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:21,500
So get thee gone, good night.

1243
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,400
Mine eyes do itch.
Does that bode weeping?

1244
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:28,300
'Tis neither here nor there.

1245
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:30,900
I have heard it said so.

1246
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,600
O, these men...

1247
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,800
...these men!

1248
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:41,800
Dost thou in conscience think,
tell me Emilia, that there be women...

1249
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,700
...do abuse their husbands
in such gross kind?

1250
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,300
There be some, no question.

1251
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,800
Wouldst thou do such a deed?

1252
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,900
- Would not you?
- No, by this heavenly light.

1253
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,800
Nor I by this heavenly light.

1254
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,100
I might do it as well in the dark.

1255
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:00,600
Wouldst thou do
such a deed for all the world?

1256
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:04,600
The world's a huge thing.
It is a great price for a small vice.

1257
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,800
I think thou wouldst not.

1258
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:10,300
I think I should
and undo it again when I'd done it.

1259
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,200
For the whole world?

1260
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:16,600
Who'd not make her husband
a cuckold to make him a monarch?

1261
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,300
I should venture purgatory for it.

1262
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,500
I don't think there
is any such woman.

1263
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,000
Yes...

1264
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:24,200
...a dozen.

1265
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,400
But I do think it is their
husbands' faults if wives do fall.

1266
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,600
Say that they slack their duties...

1267
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,200
...and pour our treasures
into foreign laps.

1268
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:39,500
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
throwing restraint upon us.

1269
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:41,300
Or say they strike us.

1270
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:44,000
Why, we have galls...

1271
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:48,100
...and though we have some grace,
yet have we some revenge.

1272
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:53,500
Let husbands know their wives
have sense like them.

1273
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,800
They see and smell...

1274
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,900
...and have their palates both for
sweet and sour as husbands have.

1275
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,400
What is it that they do
when they change us for others?

1276
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,800
Is it sport?

1277
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,300
I think it is.

1278
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,300
And doth affection breed it?

1279
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,700
I think it doth.

1280
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,700
Is it frailty that thus errs?

1281
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,900
I think so too.

1282
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,500
And have not we affections...

1283
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:27,200
...desires for sport,
and frailty as men have?

1284
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:30,200
Then let them use us well.

1285
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:35,000
Else let them know the ills we do,
their ills instruct us so.

1286
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:40,800
Good night.

1287
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,800
- Be near at hand, I may miscarry in it.
- Here, at thy hand...

1288
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:55,100
...be bold, and take thy stand.

1289
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:04,900
'Tis but a man gone.
Forth my sword, he dies!

1290
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:08,700
If Cassio do remain, he hath a daily
beauty in his life that makes me ugly.

1291
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,000
Besides, he may unfold me to the Moor...

1292
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:14,200
...there stand I in much peril.
No, he must die.

1293
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,200
Villain, thou diest!

1294
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,400
Help, ho!

1295
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,700
O villain that I am!

1296
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,200
Murder! Murder!

1297
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,000
Murder!

1298
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:51,600
It is some mischance.
The cry is very direful!

1299
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,800
Help!

1300
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,200
O wretched villain!

1301
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:59,300
Who's there?

1302
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:03,200
- Who is this that cries on murder?
- We do not know.

1303
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:04,300
Did you hear a cry?

1304
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:07,100
Here, for heaven's sake, help me!

1305
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,100
Give me some help.

1306
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,900
O, me, lieutenant!
What villains have done this?

1307
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,700
I think one is hereabout
and cannot make away.

1308
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,400
Treacherous villains!

1309
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:21,300
What are you there?
Come and give some help!

1310
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,500
- O, help me here!
- That's one of them!

1311
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:43,000
O murderous slave!
O villain!

1312
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:51,600
O, damned lago.

1313
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:55,200
Inhuman dog!

1314
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:04,900
Where be these bloody thieves?
Ho! Murder! Murder!

1315
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,800
It is the cause...

1316
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:07,600
...it is the cause, my soul.

1317
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,700
Let me not name it to you,
you chaste stars!

1318
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,600
It is the cause.

1319
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,000
Yet I'll not shed her blood...

1320
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:22,400
...nor scar that whiter skin of hers
than snow...

1321
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:25,400
...and smooth as monumental alabaster.

1322
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,300
Yet she must die...

1323
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:33,600
...else she'll betray more men.

1324
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:43,500
Put out the light...

1325
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:47,600
...and then...

1326
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:50,300
...put out the light.

1327
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:05,800
Who's there?

1328
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:25,800
O, balmy breath, that doth almost
persuade justice to break her sword!

1329
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:46,500
Be thus when thou art dead, and
I will kill thee and love thee after.

1330
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,900
One more...

1331
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,700
...and this the last.

1332
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,300
So sweet was never so fatal.

1333
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:24,600
Othello?

1334
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,600
Ay...

1335
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,200
...Desdemona.

1336
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:34,000
Will you come to bed, my lord?

1337
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,900
Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona?

1338
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:41,300
Ay, my lord.

1339
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,800
If you bethink yourself of any crime...

1340
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:46,600
...unreconciled to heaven,
solicit for it straight.

1341
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:49,400
Alack, my lord, what
may you mean by that?

1342
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:53,800
Well, do it and be brief.
I will walk by.

1343
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:58,000
I'll not kill thy unprepared spirit.

1344
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,200
Heaven forfend! I'll not kill thy soul.

1345
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:02,800
- Talk you of killing?
- Ay, I do.

1346
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,800
Then heaven...

1347
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,400
...have mercy on me.

1348
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:10,000
Amen...

1349
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:11,600
...with all my heart!

1350
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:14,400
If you say so, I hope
you will not kill me.

1351
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,300
And yet I fear you.

1352
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:19,100
Think on thy sins.

1353
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,500
They are loves I bear to you.

1354
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:23,900
And for that thou diest.

1355
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:27,100
That death's unnatural
that kills for loving.

1356
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,400
Peace and be still!

1357
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,900
I will so.

1358
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:43,100
What's the matter?

1359
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:47,900
That handkerchief which I gave thee,
thou gave to Cassio.

1360
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man and ask him.

1361
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,900
Sweet soul, take heed of perjury.
Thou art on thy deathbed.

1362
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:57,900
But not yet to die.

1363
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,200
Yes, presently!

1364
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:03,200
Then Lord have mercy on me!

1365
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:04,300
I say...

1366
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:06,200
...amen.

1367
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:08,700
And have you mercy too!

1368
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,200
I never did offend you in my life.
Never loved Cassio...

1369
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:16,100
...but with such general warranty
of heaven as I might love.

1370
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,300
I never gave him token.

1371
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:21,100
By heaven, I saw my
handkerchief in his hand!

1372
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:22,100
He found it then.

1373
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:24,100
I never gave it him.

1374
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,500
Send for him hither.

1375
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,100
Let him confess a truth.

1376
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,500
He hath confessed.

1377
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:30,500
What, my lord?

1378
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,400
That he hath used thee.

1379
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,300
How?

1380
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:39,600
- Unlawfully?
- Ay.

1381
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:42,400
- He will not say so.
- No...

1382
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,800
...his mouth is stopped.

1383
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:48,900
Honest lago hath taken order for it.

1384
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,600
What?

1385
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:53,800
Is he dead?

1386
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:57,200
Emilia...

1387
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
...run and tell my lord and lady
what hath happened.

1388
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,600
Alas, he is betrayed...

1389
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:14,000
...and I undone.

1390
01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:17,300
Out, strumpet!

1391
01:38:17,300 --> 01:38:20,700
Weepest thou for him to my face?

1392
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:27,000
O banish me, my lord,
but kill me not!

1393
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:32,000
Down, strumpet!

1394
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:33,900
IKill me tomorrow.

1395
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:42,100
Let me live tonight.

1396
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:47,600
Nay!

1397
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,200
If you strive...

1398
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:06,300
But half an hour!

1399
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,500
- Being done, there is no pause.
- But while I say one prayer!

1400
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,700
It's too late.

1401
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:11,300
What? Not dead?

1402
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:14,400
Not yet quite dead?

1403
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:17,400
Good my lord, I would
speak a word with you.

1404
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:20,800
Who's there?

1405
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:24,600
I do beseech you that I may speak
with you, O, good my lord.

1406
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,400
Yes, Emilia.

1407
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:32,200
By and by.

1408
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:38,600
- What is the matter with thee?
- My good lord, yonder's foul murder done.

1409
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,400
- What, now?
- But now, my lord.

1410
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,700
It is the very error of the moon.

1411
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,600
She comes nearer earth than she
was wont and makes men mad.

1412
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:48,300
Cassio hath killed
a Venetian called Roderigo.

1413
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,600
Roderigo and Cassio killed?

1414
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:54,600
- No, Cassio's not killed.
- Not Cassio killed!

1415
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:58,300
Then murder's out of tune,
and sweet revenge grows harsh.

1416
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,800
What cry is that?

1417
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:01,800
That? What?

1418
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,600
Out, and alas,
that was my lady's voice!

1419
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,800
O lady, speak again!

1420
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,100
Sweet Desdemona!
O sweet mistress, speak!

1421
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,700
O, who has done this deed?

1422
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,200
'Twas I that killed her.

1423
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,800
She turned to folly
and she was a whore.

1424
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:41,500
Thou dost belie her
and thou art a devil.

1425
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,800
She was false as water.

1426
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:48,000
Thou art rash as fire to say that she
was false. She was heavenly true!

1427
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,400
Cassio did top her!
Ask thy husband else.

1428
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,500
I were damned beneath hell,
but that I did proceed...

1429
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:57,200
...justly to this extremity.
Thy husband knew.

1430
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,600
- My husband?
- Thy husband.

1431
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:00,900
That she was false?

1432
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
With Cassio.
Nay, had she been true...

1433
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:05,400
- My husband?
- Ay, 'twas he that told me.

1434
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,400
An honest man who hates the slime...

1435
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:10,200
...that sticks on filthy deeds.
- My husband?

1436
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:13,200
What needs this iterance, woman?
I say thy husband!

1437
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:17,700
If he say so, may his pernicious
soul rot half a grain a day!

1438
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:19,800
He lies to the heart.

1439
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,500
She was too fond
of her filthy bargain.

1440
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:23,500
Do thy worst.

1441
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:27,300
This deed of thine is no more worthy
heaven than thou wast worthy her.

1442
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,500
Help! Murder!

1443
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,000
Peace...

1444
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,700
...you were best.

1445
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:36,000
Thou hast not half the power to
harm me as I have to be hurt.

1446
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:37,400
O gull!

1447
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:42,600
O dolt! As ignorant as dirt!
Thou hast done a deed.

1448
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,600
I care not for thy sword.

1449
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:48,100
I'll make thee known
though I lost twenty lives.

1450
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,000
Help! Help!

1451
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:52,700
The Moor hath killed my mistress!

1452
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,100
Murder! Murder!

1453
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:56,700
Murder!

1454
01:42:57,400 --> 01:42:58,700
How now, general?

1455
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,500
Who cries of murder?

1456
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:03,900
O, are you come, lago?

1457
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,800
You've done well, that men lay
their murders on your neck.

1458
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:09,100
Disprove this villain,
if thou be a man.

1459
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:11,700
He says thou toldest him
that his wife is false.

1460
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:15,600
Thou art not such a villain.
Speak, for my heart is full.

1461
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,100
I told him what I thought...

1462
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:20,800
...and told no more than what he
found himself was apt and true.

1463
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:23,800
- But did you tell him she was false?
- I did.

1464
01:43:23,900 --> 01:43:25,600
You told a lie...

1465
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:29,400
...an odious, damned lie.
Upon my a soul, a lie, a wicked lie!

1466
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,300
She false with Cassio?
Did you say...?

1467
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,400
With Cassio.
Go to, charm your tongue.

1468
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:36,700
I will not charm my tongue.
I am bound to speak.

1469
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:39,500
My mistress here lies
murdered in her bed.

1470
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,600
Your reports have set the murder on.

1471
01:43:44,900 --> 01:43:47,600
Nay, stare not, masters.

1472
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:51,000
It is true indeed.

1473
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:52,800
Villainy...

1474
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:55,200
...villainy, villainy!

1475
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:56,400
I think upon it...

1476
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:00,400
...I think, I smell it, O villainy!

1477
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:04,100
What? Are you mad?
I charge you, get you home.

1478
01:44:04,200 --> 01:44:06,300
Good gentlemen, let me
have leave to speak.

1479
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,400
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.

1480
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:11,800
Perchance I will never go home.

1481
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:15,000
Nay...

1482
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:19,100
...lay thee down and roar!

1483
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:22,300
Thou has killed the sweetest
innocent that ever did lift up eye.

1484
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,500
O, she was foul!
Lago knows that she with Cassio...

1485
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,100
...hath the act of shame
a thousand times committed.

1486
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:31,800
Cassio confessed, and she gratified his
amorous works with that handkerchief.

1487
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:34,100
I saw it in his hand.

1488
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:38,400
O God!

1489
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,300
O heavenly God!

1490
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:46,400
Be wise...

1491
01:44:47,200 --> 01:44:49,200
...and get you home.

1492
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,500
I will not.

1493
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:55,800
O thou dull Moor!

1494
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:01,500
That handkerchief thou
speakest of I found by fortune...

1495
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:03,600
...and did give my husband.

1496
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:05,200
Filth...

1497
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06,200
...thou liest!

1498
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:09,400
By heaven, I do not.
I do not, gentlemen. I found it!

1499
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,600
Are there no stones in heaven
but what serves for thunder?

1500
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,200
Precious villain!

1501
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,000
Stop, villain!

1502
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:36,800
Lay me by my mistress' side.

1503
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:16,800
What did thy song bode, lady?

1504
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,800
Hark, canst thou hear me?

1505
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:23,800
I will play the swan and die in music.

1506
01:46:24,900 --> 01:46:26,800
Willow...

1507
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:29,200
...willow, willow

1508
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,200
Moor, she was chaste.

1509
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:36,300
She loved thee, cruel Moor.

1510
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:41,100
So come my soul to bliss...

1511
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:43,300
...as I speak true.

1512
01:46:43,900 --> 01:46:47,000
So speaking as I think, I die...

1513
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:50,300
...I die.

1514
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:56,400
Where is this rash
and most unfortunate man?

1515
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:01,700
That's he that was Othello.

1516
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:06,300
Here I am.

1517
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:08,600
Where is that viper?

1518
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:11,400
Bring the villain forth.

1519
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:23,100
I look down towards his feet...

1520
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:26,200
...but that's a fable.

1521
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,800
If that thou be a devil...

1522
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,000
...I cannot kill thee.

1523
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:51,000
I bleed, sir...

1524
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,500
...but not killed.

1525
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,600
I am not sorry neither.

1526
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,200
I'd have thee live.

1527
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:01,100
For in my sense...

1528
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:04,300
...'tis happiness to die.

1529
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:05,900
This wretch...

1530
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
...hath part confessed his villainy.

1531
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:13,800
Did you and he consent...

1532
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:16,100
...in Cassio's death?

1533
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,500
Ay.

1534
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,400
Dear general, I never gave you cause.

1535
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:25,900
I do believe it and ask your pardon.

1536
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:29,200
Will you, I pray...

1537
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:31,500
...demand this demi-devil...

1538
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,900
...why he hath thus ensnared
my soul and body?

1539
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:39,500
Demand me nothing.

1540
01:48:40,900 --> 01:48:42,800
What you know, you know.

1541
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:46,000
From this time forth...

1542
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:49,300
...I never will speak word.

1543
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,500
Well...

1544
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,800
...thou dost best.

1545
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,800
Forsake this room and go with us.

1546
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:01,900
Your power and command is taken off...

1547
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:05,100
...and Cassio rules in Cyprus.

1548
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:16,200
Come, bring him away.

1549
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:17,800
A word before you go.

1550
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:21,200
I have done the state
some service, and they know it.

1551
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:36,200
No more of that.

1552
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,600
I pray you...

1553
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:46,100
...in your letters, when you
these unlucky deeds relate...

1554
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,400
...speak of me as I am.

1555
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:50,900
Nothing extenuate...

1556
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,500
...nor set down aught in malice.

1557
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,100
Then must you speak of one...

1558
01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:00,200
...that loved not wisely,
but too well.

1559
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:04,700
Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought...

1560
01:50:04,700 --> 01:50:07,600
...perplexed in the extreme.

1561
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:11,500
Of one whose hand,
like the base Indian...

1562
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:15,200
...threw a pearl away
richer than all his tribe.

1563
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,600
Of one whose subdued eyes...

1564
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:22,300
...albeit unused to the melting mood...

1565
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:26,600
...drop tears as fast as
the Arabian trees...

1566
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:28,300
...their medicinal gum.

1567
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,200
Set you down this.

1568
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,400
And say, besides...

1569
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:39,800
...that in Aleppo once...

1570
01:50:40,700 --> 01:50:44,400
...where a malignant
and a turbanned Turk...

1571
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:46,400
...beat a Venetian...

1572
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:49,000
...and traduced the state...

1573
01:50:49,900 --> 01:50:53,300
...I took by the throat...

1574
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:55,700
...the circumcised dog...

1575
01:50:56,300 --> 01:50:57,700
...and smote him...

1576
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,700
...thus.

1577
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:42,900
I kissed thee...

1578
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,500
...ere I killed thee.

1579
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:49,100
No way but this...

1580
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:52,800
...killing myself...

1581
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:56,900
...to die upon a kiss.

1582
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:07,200
This I did fear, but thought
he had no weapon.

1583
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,600
For he was great of heart.

1584
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,900
O Spartan dog!

1585
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:17,500
Look on the tragic
loading of this bed.

1586
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:20,100
This is thy work.

1587
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:31,300
To you, lord governor...

1588
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:35,000
...remains the censure
of this hellish villain.

1589
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,100
The time...

1590
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,400
...the place...

1591
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,000
...the torture.
O, enforce it!

1592
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:48,600
Myself will straight aboard...

1593
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,900
...and to the state...

1594
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,700
...this heavy act...

1595
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,800
...with heavy heart relate.
