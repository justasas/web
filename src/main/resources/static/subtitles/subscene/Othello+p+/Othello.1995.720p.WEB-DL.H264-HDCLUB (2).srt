1
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:51,970
'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.

2
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:58,619
But who shall lead our business
against the Turkish fleet?

3
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:01,517
Othello.

4
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:04,819
Another of his fathom
we have none.

5
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:09,724
The fortitude of the place
is best known to him.

6
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:38,815
I take it much unkindly
that thou, Iago...

7
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:42,087
...who hast had my purse
as if the strings were thine...

8
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:44,128
...shouldst know of this.

9
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:47,597
By the faith of man,
I know my price.

10
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:52,739
I am worth no worse a place.
But he, one Michael Cassio...

11
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:57,571
...a Florentine,
must his lieutenant be.

12
00:03:57,846 --> 00:04:01,475
And I, of whom
his eyes had seen the proof...

13
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:06,143
- God bless the mark!...
his Moorship's ensign.

14
00:04:06,354 --> 00:04:09,551
O by heaven, I rather
would have been his hangman.

15
00:04:09,758 --> 00:04:14,491
Why, there's no remedy.
'Tis the curse of service.

16
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,629
I would not follow him then.

17
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:22,735
O, sir, content you.

18
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:26,703
I follow him
to serve my turn upon him.

19
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:31,845
We cannot all be masters, nor
all masters cannot be truly followed.

20
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,143
You shall mark...

21
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:38,910
...heaven is my judge,
not I for love and duty...

22
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,216
...but seeming so for my peculiar end.

23
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:47,327
I am not what I am.

24
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:54,434
What a full fortune does the thick-
lips owe, if he can carry it thus.

25
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:59,035
Call up her father.

26
00:05:13,388 --> 00:05:15,618
Awake! Thieves! Signor!

27
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:19,419
Thieves! Look to your house,
your daughter and your bags!

28
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:21,526
Signor Brabantio!
Ho!

29
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,128
- Awake!
- Sir!

30
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:26,858
Thieves! Look to your house, your
daughter and your bags!

31
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:29,730
Thieves! Thieves!

32
00:05:30,805 --> 00:05:33,239
What is the reason
of this terrible summons?

33
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:35,534
What is the matter here?

34
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:40,972
Signor...

35
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,813
...is all your family within?

36
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:46,543
I know you, Roderigo...

37
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:50,485
...and have charged thee
not to haunt about my doors.

38
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:53,217
In honest plainness,
thou has heard me say...

39
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:55,521
...my daughter is not for thee.

40
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,857
Are your doors locked?

41
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,063
Why? Wherefore ask you this?

42
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:04,204
Even now, now, very now...

43
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:08,171
...an old black ram
is tupping your white ewe.

44
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,469
What profane wretch art thou?

45
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:12,339
I am one
that comes to tell you...

46
00:06:12,547 --> 00:06:15,641
...your daughter and the Moor are
making the beast with two backs.

47
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,908
Thou art a villain.

48
00:06:17,118 --> 00:06:19,313
You are a senator.

49
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:22,782
This thou shalt answer, Roderigo.

50
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,083
Ay, sir!

51
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:26,218
I will answer anything.

52
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,294
But I beseech you,
straight satisfy yourself:

53
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:32,926
If she be in her chamber
or your house...

54
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:37,628
...let loose on me the justice
of the state for thus deluding you.

55
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,073
Strike on the tinder, ho!

56
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,405
Give me a taper!
Call up all my people!

57
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:50,980
This accident is not unlike my dream.

58
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,720
Belief of it oppresses me already.

59
00:06:54,556 --> 00:06:56,353
Light, I say!

60
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:57,957
Light!

61
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:02,022
Get weapons, ho!

62
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:06,296
Farewell, for I must leave you.

63
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:27,378
The goodness of the night
upon you, friends.

64
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:33,122
I pray you, sir,
are you fast married?

65
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,556
Sir, you've been hotly called for.

66
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:41,327
Have with you.

67
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,311
- Halt!
- You!

68
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:04,491
IKeep up your bright swords,
for the dew will rust them.

69
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:08,858
O, thou foul thief!

70
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:11,258
Where hast thou stowed my daughter?

71
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:14,094
Damned as thou art,
thou hast enchanted her...

72
00:08:14,302 --> 00:08:19,171
...to run from her garden to the sooty
bosom of such a thing as thou.

73
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,475
Lay hold upon him.

74
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:28,444
Hold your hands...

75
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:31,274
...both you of my inclining
and the rest.

76
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:37,956
Were it my cue to fight, I should have
known it without a prompter.

77
00:08:39,928 --> 00:08:41,395
Good signor...

78
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,560
...where will you that I go
to answer this, your charge?

79
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:46,131
To prison...

80
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:49,667
...till fit time of law and course of
direct session call thee to answer.

81
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:51,896
What if I do obey?

82
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,700
How may the Duke
be therewith satisfied...

83
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:59,369
...whose messengers are
here about my side to bring me to him?

84
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,374
'Tis true,
most worthy signor.

85
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,676
The Duke's in council, and your
noble self, surely, is sent for.

86
00:09:04,886 --> 00:09:08,014
How? The Duke in council?
In this time of night?

87
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,221
Bring him away.

88
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,807
Valiant Othello...

89
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:37,916
...we must straight employ you
against the general Turkish foe.

90
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,952
Welcome, gentle signor.

91
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:44,056
We lacked your counsel
and your help tonight.

92
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:45,748
So did I yours.

93
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:47,919
Good Your Grace, pardon me.

94
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,654
Neither my place,
nor aught I heard of business...

95
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:52,992
...has raised me from my bed.

96
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:55,198
My daughter!

97
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:57,763
O, my daughter!

98
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,904
Dead?

99
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:03,104
She is abused,
stolen from me and corrupted.

100
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:08,515
For nature so preposterously to err,
sans witchcraft could not.

101
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,116
Whoever he be
that in this foul proceeding...

102
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:18,258
...hath thus beguiled your daughter
of herself, and you of her...

103
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:22,222
...the bloody book of law you
shall yourself read...

104
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,560
...in the bitter letter after
your own sense.

105
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:31,301
Humbly, I thank Your Grace.

106
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:42,810
Here is the man.

107
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:48,817
Othello?

108
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:51,617
What in your own part can you
say to this?

109
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:54,317
Nothing, but this is so.

110
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:05,772
Most potent, grave
and reverend signors...

111
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,207
...my very noble
and approved good masters...

112
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,439
...that I have taken away this
old man's daughter...

113
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,516
...'tis most true.
True, I have married her.

114
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:22,282
The very head and front of my offending
hath this extent, no more.

115
00:11:22,924 --> 00:11:24,983
Rude am I in my speech...

116
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:29,960
...and little blessed
with the soft phrase of peace.

117
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:33,292
For since these arms of mine
had seven years' pith...

118
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,469
...till now some nine moons wasted...

119
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,833
...they have used their dearest action
in the tented field.

120
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,941
And little of this great world
can I speak...

121
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:45,579
...more than pertains to feats
of broil and battle.

122
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:48,611
Therefore, little shall I
grace my cause...

123
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:53,014
...in speaking of myself.
Yet, by your gracious patience...

124
00:11:53,221 --> 00:11:57,453
...I will a round,
unvarnished tale deliver...

125
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:00,091
...of my whole course of love:

126
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:03,661
What drugs, what charms...

127
00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:08,165
...what conjuration
and what mighty magic...

128
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:13,102
- for such proceedings am I
charged withal... I won his daughter.

129
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:15,104
A maiden never bold...

130
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:18,904
...of spirit so still and quiet
that her motion blushed at herself...

131
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,581
...and she, in spite of nature,
to fall in love...

132
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,682
...with what she feared to look on!

133
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:25,876
I do beseech you, send for the lady...

134
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:28,317
...and let her speak of me
before her father.

135
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:30,991
If you do find me foul in her report...

136
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:34,958
...the trust, the office I do hold
of you, not only take away...

137
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:38,724
...but let your sentence even
fall upon my life.

138
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,603
Fetch Desdemona.

139
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:56,740
Her father loved me...

140
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:58,949
...oft invited me...

141
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,083
...still questioned me the story
of my life from year to year...

142
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:07,660
...the battles, sieges, fortunes
that I have passed.

143
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:10,126
Even from my boyish days...

144
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,094
...to the moment
he bade me tell it.

145
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,632
Wherein I spoke of
most disastrous chances...

146
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,235
...of moving accidents by
flood and field...

147
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:20,737
...hair-breadth escapes
in the imminent deadly breach...

148
00:13:20,942 --> 00:13:23,968
...of being taken by the insolent foe...

149
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,703
...and sold to slavery.

150
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:29,474
And of the cannibals that
each other eat...

151
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,447
...the Anthropophagi...

152
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:35,053
...and men whose heads do grow
beneath their shoulders.

153
00:13:35,256 --> 00:13:38,623
These things to hear
would Desdemona seriously incline.

154
00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:43,763
And with a greedy ear
devour up my discourse...

155
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:45,963
...which I observing...

156
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,528
...took once a pliant hour...

157
00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:52,001
...and found means to draw
from her a prayer of earnest heart...

158
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,834
...which I would
all my pilgrimage dilate.

159
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:58,202
She gave me for my pains...

160
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:01,581
...a world of sighs.

161
00:14:01,782 --> 00:14:05,081
She swore, in faith, 'twas strange...

162
00:14:05,286 --> 00:14:08,585
...'twas passing strange,
'twas pitiful...

163
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:10,848
...'twas wondrous pitiful.

164
00:14:14,328 --> 00:14:17,058
She loved me
for the dangers I had passed...

165
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:20,234
...and I loved her
that she did pity them.

166
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:24,935
This only is
the witchcraft I have used.

167
00:14:37,852 --> 00:14:40,685
Come hither, gentle mistress.

168
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:47,526
Do you perceive in all this company
where most you owe obedience?

169
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,289
My noble father...

170
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,927
...to you I am bound
for life and education.

171
00:14:57,571 --> 00:15:02,304
My life and education both
do learn me how to respect you.

172
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,411
You are lord of all my duty.

173
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,445
I am hitherto your daughter.

174
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:11,709
But here's my husband.

175
00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:18,347
And so much duty
as my mother showed to you...

176
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,891
...preferring you before her father...

177
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:25,498
...so much I challenge
that I may profess due to the Moor...

178
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,258
...my lord.

179
00:15:34,342 --> 00:15:37,140
God by you! I have done.

180
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:43,045
I had rather to adopt a child
than get it.

181
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,348
Come hither, Moor.

182
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,624
I here do give thee that
with all my heart...

183
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:57,423
...which, but thou hast already...

184
00:15:57,631 --> 00:16:02,568
...with all my heart I would
keep from thee.

185
00:16:14,815 --> 00:16:19,149
I humbly beseech you, proceed
with the affairs of state.

186
00:16:25,126 --> 00:16:30,063
The Turk, with a mighty preparation,
makes for Cyprus.

187
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:31,559
Othello...

188
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:33,964
...you must away tonight.

189
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:37,695
The affair cries haste,
and speed must answer it.

190
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,307
Most gracious Duke...

191
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:51,881
What would you, Desdemona?

192
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:57,557
That I did love the Moor
to live with him...

193
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,319
...my downright violence
and scorn of fortunes...

194
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,622
...may trumpet to the world.

195
00:17:04,298 --> 00:17:09,235
My heart is subdued even to
the utmost pleasure of my lord.

196
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:16,309
I saw Othello's visage in his mind...

197
00:17:17,678 --> 00:17:19,976
...and to his honors
and his valiant parts...

198
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:23,514
...did I my soul
and fortunes consecrate.

199
00:17:25,352 --> 00:17:28,685
So that, dear lords...

200
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:33,823
...if I be left behind, a moth of peace,
and he go to the war...

201
00:17:34,028 --> 00:17:37,361
...the rites for which I love him
are bereft me.

202
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:41,057
And I, a heavy interim,
shall support by his dear absence.

203
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,929
Let me go with him.

204
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,235
Let her have your voice.

205
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,304
And heaven defend your good souls...

206
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:52,309
...that you think I will your serious
business scant for she is with me.

207
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:57,744
Be it as you shall privately determine.

208
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:03,552
At 9 in the morning,
here we'll meet again.

209
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:05,883
Good night to everyone.

210
00:18:07,361 --> 00:18:10,387
And, noble signor...

211
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,758
...if virtue no delighted beauty lack...

212
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,703
...your son-in-law
is far more fair than black.

213
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:29,782
Look to her, Moor,
if thou hast eyes to see.

214
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,750
She has deceived her father
and may thee.

215
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,322
My life upon her faith!

216
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:45,362
Good Iago, my Desdemona
must I leave to thee.

217
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:49,525
Let thy wife attend on her, and bring
them after in the best advantage.

218
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:52,228
Come, we must obey the time.

219
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,110
Iago!

220
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:10,917
What sayest thou, noble heart?

221
00:19:14,395 --> 00:19:16,625
What will I do, thinkest thou?

222
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:18,860
Why, go to bed and sleep.

223
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,233
I will incontinently drown myself.

224
00:19:22,436 --> 00:19:25,701
If thou dost,
I shall never love thee after.

225
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:28,170
Why, thou silly gentleman!

226
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:33,312
It is silliness to live
when to live is a torment.

227
00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:35,945
Desdemona!

228
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:39,642
Villainous!

229
00:19:41,855 --> 00:19:45,518
I've looked upon the world for
four times seven years...

230
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,423
...and I never yet found a man that
knew how to love himself.

231
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,498
Ere I would say I would drown myself
for the love of a guinea hen...

232
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:57,797
...l'd change my humanity with a baboon.
- What should I do?

233
00:19:58,372 --> 00:20:00,806
I confess it is my shame
to be so fond...

234
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:03,272
...but it is not in my virtue
to amend it.

235
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:04,910
Virtue? A fig.

236
00:20:05,112 --> 00:20:07,444
'Tis in ourselves
that we are thus or thus.

237
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:10,549
We have reason
to cool our raging motions...

238
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,515
...our carnal stings, our
unbitted lusts...

239
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:16,986
...whereof I take this, which you call
love, to be a sect or scion.

240
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:18,351
It cannot be!

241
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,461
It is merely a lust of the blood
and a permission of the will.

242
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:24,130
Come, be a man!

243
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:26,595
Drown thyself?

244
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:30,093
Drown cats and blind puppies.

245
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,139
I have professed me thy friend
and I confess me...

246
00:20:35,342 --> 00:20:38,175
...knit to thy deserving with cables
of perdurable toughness.

247
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:41,974
I could never
better stead thee than now.

248
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,687
Put money in thy purse.

249
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,953
Follow thou these wars.

250
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,093
Disguise thy features with
an usurped beard.

251
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,026
I say, put money in thy purse.

252
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:02,964
It cannot be that Desdemona should
long continue her love to the Moor.

253
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,138
Put but money in thy purse.

254
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:08,308
When she's sated with his body,
she'll find the error of her choice.

255
00:21:08,509 --> 00:21:11,171
She must have change, she must.

256
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:13,870
Fill thy purse with money.

257
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:18,074
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian...

258
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:21,880
...and a super-subtle Venetian
be not too hard for my wits...

259
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:23,716
...and all the tribe of hell...

260
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:27,018
...thou shall enjoy her.

261
00:21:27,227 --> 00:21:29,354
Therefore, put...

262
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,030
"Money in thy purse."

263
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,695
A pox on drowning, huh?

264
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:37,336
'Tis clean out of the way.

265
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:40,234
Seek thou rather to be hanged
in compassing thy joy...

266
00:21:40,441 --> 00:21:42,875
...than to be drowned
and go without her.

267
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:50,343
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes?

268
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:53,111
Thou art sure of me.

269
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:57,881
There are many events in
the womb of time...

270
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,852
...which will be delivered.

271
00:22:02,596 --> 00:22:04,461
Go, provide thy money.

272
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:07,196
We will have more of this tomorrow.
Adieu.

273
00:22:07,401 --> 00:22:09,335
Where shall we meet in the morning?

274
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,495
- At my lodging.
- All right.

275
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:15,575
- I'll be with thee betimes.
- Go to, farewell.

276
00:22:15,776 --> 00:22:16,936
Does thou hear?

277
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:18,111
What say thou?

278
00:22:18,312 --> 00:22:20,405
No more of drowning, do you hear?

279
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:21,638
I am changed.

280
00:22:25,786 --> 00:22:28,346
Go to, farewell.
Put money enough in your purse!

281
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,455
I'll sell all my land.

282
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:36,125
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.

283
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,026
For I mine own gained knowledge
should profane...

284
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,066
...if I would time
expend with such a snipe...

285
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,760
...but for my sport and profit.

286
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,847
I hate the Moor...

287
00:22:56,517 --> 00:22:59,384
...and it is thought abroad that
'twixt my sheets...

288
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:03,955
...he's done my office.

289
00:23:05,125 --> 00:23:06,319
I know not if it be true...

290
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:10,759
...but I, for mere suspicion
in that kind...

291
00:23:11,532 --> 00:23:16,469
...will do as if for surety.

292
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,440
He holds me well...

293
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:26,707
...the better shall my purpose
work on him.

294
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:32,081
Cassio's a proper man.

295
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,187
Let me see now...
To get his place...

296
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,293
...and to plume up my will
in double knavery...

297
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:43,288
How?

298
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:47,497
How?

299
00:23:57,377 --> 00:23:58,969
I have it.

300
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,248
It is engendered.

301
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,410
Hell and night...

302
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:10,056
...must bring this monstrous birth
to the world's light.

303
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:30,462
- Hail to thee, lady.
- Thank you, valiant Cassio.

304
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:44,080
Very good.
Ay, well said, whisper.

305
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,788
With as little a web as this,
will I ensnare...

306
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:52,948
...as great a fly as Cassio.

307
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:15,811
O, my fair warrior!

308
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:19,175
My dear Othello!

309
00:26:19,553 --> 00:26:24,149
It gives me wonder great as my content
to see you here before me.

310
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:32,998
O my soul's joy!

311
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:36,859
I cannot speak enough of this content.
It stops me here.

312
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,630
It is too much of joy.

313
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,007
News, friends:

314
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:54,187
Our wars are done,
the Turks are drowned!

315
00:26:58,892 --> 00:27:01,520
This desperate storm
hath seen a grievous wrack...

316
00:27:01,728 --> 00:27:04,128
...and sufferance
on most part of their fleet.

317
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,821
Worthy Montano.

318
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:09,334
How does my old acquaintance
of this isle?

319
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:12,027
Honey, you shall be
well desired in Cyprus.

320
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:14,673
I have found great love amongst them.

321
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:18,568
O, you are well tuned now!

322
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:23,682
But I'll set down the pegs that
make this music, as honest as I am.

323
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:47,055
If thou be'st valiant... as they say
base men being in love have then...

324
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:51,169
...a nobility in their nature
more than is native to them... list me.

325
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:55,099
The lieutenant tonight watches
on the court of guard.

326
00:28:55,642 --> 00:28:57,769
First, I must tell thee this:

327
00:28:58,145 --> 00:29:00,875
Desdemona is directly in love with him.

328
00:29:01,148 --> 00:29:02,877
With Cassio?

329
00:29:04,017 --> 00:29:05,177
Why, 'tis not possible!

330
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:08,115
Lay thy finger thus,
and let thy soul be instructed.

331
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:10,186
Mark me. Her eye must be fed.

332
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,620
What delight shall she have
to look on the devil?

333
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:15,659
Her delicate tenderness has
found itself abused...

334
00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:20,026
...begun to heave the gorge,
disrelish and abhor the Moor.

335
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:23,566
Her nature instructs her to it,
and compels her to some second choice.

336
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,206
I cannot believe that.
She is full of most blessed condition.

337
00:29:27,407 --> 00:29:28,965
Blessed fig's-end!

338
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:31,502
The wine she drinks is made of grapes.

339
00:29:31,878 --> 00:29:35,678
If she were blessed, she would never
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding.

340
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,450
Didst thou not see her paddle
with his hand?

341
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,017
Didst thou not mark that?

342
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,678
- But that was but courtesy.
- Lechery, by this hand...

343
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,820
...an index and obscure prologue...

344
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:50,553
...to the history
of lust and foul thoughts.

345
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:54,291
They met so near with their lips
that their breaths embraced together.

346
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,196
Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!

347
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:59,167
When these mutualities
so marshal the way...

348
00:29:59,372 --> 00:30:01,272
...hard at hand comes the master...

349
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:04,034
...and main exercise,
the incorporate conclusion.

350
00:30:04,244 --> 00:30:07,805
But sir, be you ruled by me.
I have brought you from Venice.

351
00:30:10,984 --> 00:30:13,043
Watch you with the guard tonight...

352
00:30:13,253 --> 00:30:16,654
...for the command I'll lay it upon you.
I'll not be far from you.

353
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:21,593
Do you find some occasion
to anger Cassio.

354
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:24,493
Well...

355
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:34,330
Welcome, Iago.
We must to the watch.

356
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,806
Not this hour, lieutenant.
'Tis not yet 10 of the clock.

357
00:30:38,011 --> 00:30:40,878
Our general cast us thus early for
the love of his Desdemona...

358
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:42,844
...who let us not therefore blame.

359
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,710
He hath not yet...

360
00:30:44,918 --> 00:30:48,547
...made wanton the night with her,
and she is sport for Jove.

361
00:30:48,755 --> 00:30:50,416
She's a most exquisite lady.

362
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,684
And I'll warrant her, full of game.

363
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,724
She is indeed perfection.

364
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:57,055
Well...

365
00:30:57,264 --> 00:30:58,822
...happiness to their sheets!

366
00:30:59,032 --> 00:31:00,795
Come, I have a stoop of wine...

367
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,162
...and here without are
a brace of Cyprus gallants...

368
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,463
...that would have a measure to
the health of black Othello.

369
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:07,139
Not tonight, good Iago.

370
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,399
I have very poor and unhappy
brains for drinking.

371
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:11,941
I could well wish courtesy
would invent...

372
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:14,340
...some other custom of entertainment.

373
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,210
They are our friends.

374
00:31:19,452 --> 00:31:21,352
But one cup?
I'll drink for you.

375
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:25,149
I have drunk a cup tonight already and
dare not task my weakness with anymore.

376
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:27,952
What, man!
'Tis a night of revels.

377
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:30,322
The gallants desire it.

378
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,198
Where are they?

379
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:41,096
If I can fasten
but one cup upon him...

380
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:19,175
The purchase made...

381
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:22,681
...the fruits are to ensue...

382
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,452
...that profit's yet to come
between me and you.

383
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:51,432
Is your Englishman so expert
in his drinking?

384
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:54,607
Why, he drinks you with facility,
your Dane dead drunk.

385
00:33:54,808 --> 00:33:56,935
He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.

386
00:33:57,143 --> 00:34:01,011
And he gives your Hollander a vomit
ere the next pottle can be filled.

387
00:34:01,214 --> 00:34:02,613
Health to our general!

388
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:05,046
I am for it, lieutenant...

389
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,910
...and I'll do you justice.

390
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:25,099
Sweet England!

391
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:34,237
Save you, friend Cassio.

392
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,915
Well, how is it with you, most fair?

393
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,780
Bianca.

394
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:46,990
Let be gallantly!

395
00:34:50,263 --> 00:34:54,063
He was a wight of high renown

396
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,925
And thou art but of low degree

397
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:03,967
'Tis pride that pulls the country down

398
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:08,210
Then take thine auld cloak...

399
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:11,008
...about thee

400
00:35:16,256 --> 00:35:18,121
Let's have no more of this.

401
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,882
Let's to our affairs.

402
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,352
God forgive us our sins.

403
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,924
Gentlemen, let's look to our business.

404
00:35:28,935 --> 00:35:31,699
Do not think, gentlemen,
that I am drunk.

405
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:34,769
This is my ensign.

406
00:35:34,974 --> 00:35:36,737
This is my right hand.

407
00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:39,202
This is my left hand.

408
00:35:40,613 --> 00:35:42,638
I am not drunk now.

409
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,875
I can stand well enough...

410
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,586
...and I speak well enough.

411
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:49,482
- Excellent well.
- Why, very well.

412
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,156
You must not think then
that I am drunk.

413
00:35:58,731 --> 00:36:01,564
To the platform, masters.
Come, let's set the watch.

414
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:04,066
You see this fellow that is gone before?

415
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:08,800
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
and give direction.

416
00:36:09,108 --> 00:36:11,269
And do but see his vice.

417
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:13,411
But is he often thus?

418
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,015
'Tis evermore the prologue
to his sleep.

419
00:36:20,453 --> 00:36:23,388
- What's the matter, lieutenant?
- A knave teach me my duty!

420
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,683
I'll beat the knave
into a twiggen bottle.

421
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,520
- Beat me!
- Dost thou prate, rogue?

422
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:30,956
Nay, good lieutenant.

423
00:36:31,164 --> 00:36:34,930
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

424
00:36:35,668 --> 00:36:39,399
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you
over the mazzard.

425
00:36:40,974 --> 00:36:42,839
Come, come...

426
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,509
...you're drunk.

427
00:36:51,651 --> 00:36:52,675
Drunk?

428
00:36:55,054 --> 00:36:56,715
Nay, good lieutenant.

429
00:36:58,458 --> 00:36:59,618
God's will, gentlemen!

430
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:09,599
Good lieutenant, hold!

431
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:11,770
Mutiny!

432
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:13,930
Mutiny!

433
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,276
Help, ho! Lieutenant!

434
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:34,358
God's will, lieutenant.
Hold!

435
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,120
Hold, for your lives!

436
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,456
Hold, for shame!

437
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:40,530
What's the matter here?!

438
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,598
Are we turned Turks?!

439
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:46,827
For Christian shame,
put by this barbarous brawl.

440
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,241
He who stirs next
to carve for his own rage...

441
00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:51,808
...holds his soul light.

442
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:54,844
He dies upon his motion.

443
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:59,440
What is the matter, masters?

444
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,680
Michael...

445
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:04,389
...how comes it you are thus forgot?

446
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,187
I pray you, pardon me, sir!

447
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:11,556
I cannot speak.

448
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:16,494
Worthy Montano...

449
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:21,702
...what is the matter that
you unlace your reputation thus...

450
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:25,173
...and spend your rich opinion for
the name of a night-brawler?

451
00:38:25,378 --> 00:38:30,179
- Give me answer to it.
- Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.

452
00:38:30,383 --> 00:38:33,477
Your officer, Iago, can inform you,
while I spare speech...

453
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,018
...of all that I do know.

454
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:49,362
Now, by heaven, my blood begins
my safer guides to rule.

455
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:53,630
On thy love I charge thee, Iago.
Who began it?

456
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,104
If partially affined or
leagued in office...

457
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:59,506
...thou dost deliver more
or less than truth...

458
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,612
...thou art no soldier.

459
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:04,749
Touch me not so near!
I had rather cut this tongue...

460
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:07,215
...than it should do offense
to Michael Cassio.

461
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:12,621
Yet to speak the truth
shall nothing wrong him.

462
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:14,292
This it is, general:

463
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:17,796
Montano and myself being in speech,
comes a fellow crying for help...

464
00:39:17,997 --> 00:39:21,865
...and Cassio following him with
determined sword to execute upon him.

465
00:39:22,168 --> 00:39:25,035
Sir, this gentleman steps in
to Cassio...

466
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,410
- but more of this matter
can I not report.

467
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:47,256
But men are men.
The best sometime forget.

468
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,553
Though Cassio did
some little wrong to him...

469
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,458
...as men in rage strike those
that wish them best...

470
00:39:52,665 --> 00:39:53,597
...yet surely Cassio...

471
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:58,260
I know, Iago, thy honesty and love
doth mince this matter...

472
00:39:58,471 --> 00:40:01,406
...making it light to Cassio.

473
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,718
Cassio...

474
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:28,993
...he that you hurt
is of great fame in Cyprus...

475
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:32,099
...and great affinity.

476
00:40:33,372 --> 00:40:34,805
I love thee...

477
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,300
...but nevermore be officer of mine.

478
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,237
What is the matter, dear?

479
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,415
Look, if my gentle love
be not raised up.

480
00:40:44,617 --> 00:40:46,915
I'll make thee an example.

481
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:50,816
All's well now, sweeting.
Come away to bed.

482
00:40:51,023 --> 00:40:52,752
Look with care about the town...

483
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:55,655
...and silence those
whom this vile brawl distracted.

484
00:40:55,862 --> 00:40:57,830
Come, sweet Desdemona.

485
00:41:11,277 --> 00:41:13,973
- Are you hurt, lieutenant?
- Ay, past all surgery.

486
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,343
- Marry, God forbid!
- I have lost my reputation.

487
00:41:17,984 --> 00:41:20,578
I have lost the immortal
part of myself...

488
00:41:20,786 --> 00:41:23,346
...and what remains is bestial.

489
00:41:23,556 --> 00:41:25,751
My reputation, Iago!

490
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:26,856
My reputation!

491
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:28,993
I thought you'd received some wound.

492
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,959
There's more offense in that
than in reputation.

493
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,533
What, man! There are ways
to recover the general again.

494
00:41:37,737 --> 00:41:39,261
You are but now cast in his mood...

495
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:41,667
...a punishment more in policy
than in malice.

496
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,466
Sue to him again, and he's yours.

497
00:41:43,676 --> 00:41:45,303
I would rather sue to be despised...

498
00:41:45,511 --> 00:41:47,342
...than to deceive
so good a commander...

499
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:51,414
...with so slight, so drunken and
so indiscreet an officer.

500
00:41:51,617 --> 00:41:52,948
He that you followed...

501
00:41:53,152 --> 00:41:55,586
...what had he done to you?
- I know not.

502
00:41:55,788 --> 00:41:56,618
Is it possible?

503
00:41:56,822 --> 00:41:57,652
Drunk!

504
00:41:57,857 --> 00:42:00,587
Wine is a good
familiar creature, if it be well used.

505
00:42:00,793 --> 00:42:03,159
Exclaim no more against it.

506
00:42:03,362 --> 00:42:06,559
And good lieutenant...

507
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:10,059
...I think you think I love you.

508
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,470
I have well approved it, sir.

509
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,733
I'll tell you what you shall do.

510
00:42:17,176 --> 00:42:20,145
Our general's wife is now the general.

511
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,642
Confess yourself freely to Desdemona.

512
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:27,182
Importune her. She'll help
to put you in your place again.

513
00:42:27,386 --> 00:42:30,253
This broken joint
between you and her husband...

514
00:42:30,456 --> 00:42:32,219
...entreat her to splinter.

515
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,792
And my fortunes
against any lay worth naming...

516
00:42:35,995 --> 00:42:40,398
...this crack of your love shall
grow stronger than it was before.

517
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:43,728
You advise me well.

518
00:42:44,203 --> 00:42:47,764
I protest, in the sincerity of love
and honest kindness.

519
00:42:47,974 --> 00:42:49,839
I think it freely.

520
00:42:56,215 --> 00:42:58,012
Good night, lieutenant.

521
00:42:58,217 --> 00:43:00,242
I must to the watch.

522
00:43:00,586 --> 00:43:02,986
Good night, honest Iago.

523
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:10,025
How am I then a villain...

524
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:12,754
...when this advice is free I give
and honest...

525
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,901
...probal to thinking, and indeed
the course to win the Moor again?

526
00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:21,506
His soul is so enfettered
to Desdemona's love...

527
00:43:21,707 --> 00:43:25,302
...that she may make, unmake,
do what she list...

528
00:43:25,511 --> 00:43:29,538
...even as her appetite shall
play the god with his weak function.

529
00:43:29,749 --> 00:43:32,149
How am I then a villain
to counsel Cassio...

530
00:43:32,351 --> 00:43:35,377
...to this parallel course,
directed to his good?

531
00:43:36,188 --> 00:43:38,850
Divinity of hell!

532
00:43:39,692 --> 00:43:43,719
When devils will the blackest sins
put on, they do suggest at first...

533
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,261
...with heavenly shows, as I do now.

534
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:51,095
For whiles this honest fool plies
Desdemona to repair his fortunes...

535
00:43:51,303 --> 00:43:54,466
...and she for him
pleads strongly to the Moor...

536
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,141
...l'll pour this pestilence
into his ear...

537
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:01,177
...that she repeals him for
her body's lust...

538
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,406
...and by how much she strives
to do him good...

539
00:44:04,617 --> 00:44:09,020
...she shall undo her credit
with the Moor.

540
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,785
So will I turn her virtue...

541
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,996
...into pitch.

542
00:44:22,768 --> 00:44:25,464
And out of her own goodness...

543
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:27,696
...make the net...

544
00:44:27,907 --> 00:44:29,841
...that shall...

545
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,907
...enmesh them all.

546
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:38,380
How now, Roderigo?

547
00:44:38,918 --> 00:44:41,614
I do follow here in the chase...

548
00:44:41,854 --> 00:44:44,618
...not like a hound that hunts...

549
00:44:44,824 --> 00:44:47,622
...but one that fills up the cry.

550
00:44:48,094 --> 00:44:50,722
My money is almost spent.

551
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,866
I have been tonight
exceedingly well-cudgeled.

552
00:44:55,768 --> 00:44:58,828
And I think the issue will be...

553
00:44:59,038 --> 00:45:02,269
...that I shall have
so much experience for my pains.

554
00:45:02,475 --> 00:45:03,840
And so...

555
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:08,445
...with no money at all and
a little more wit...

556
00:45:09,782 --> 00:45:12,216
...return again to Venice.

557
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,784
How poor are they
that have not patience.

558
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,419
What wound did ever heal
but by degrees?

559
00:45:21,994 --> 00:45:24,519
Thou knowest we work by wit...

560
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,595
...and not by witchcraft.

561
00:45:26,799 --> 00:45:30,064
And wit depends on dilatory time.

562
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,531
Does it not go well?

563
00:45:34,673 --> 00:45:36,664
Cassio hath beaten thee.

564
00:45:39,411 --> 00:45:42,847
And thou, by that small hurt...

565
00:45:43,048 --> 00:45:46,176
...hath cashiered Cassio.

566
00:45:50,256 --> 00:45:52,156
Content thyself awhile.

567
00:46:02,535 --> 00:46:05,368
By the mass, 'tis morning.

568
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,171
Pleasure and action
make the hours seem short.

569
00:46:09,775 --> 00:46:11,299
Retire thee awhile.

570
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,974
Away, I say.

571
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,780
Thou shalt know more hereafter.

572
00:46:20,553 --> 00:46:22,282
Nay, get thee gone.

573
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:41,301
Bounteous madam...

574
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,498
...whatever shall become of
Michael Cassio?

575
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:47,338
- He's never anything but your servant.
- I know it.

576
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,042
I thank you.

577
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:51,679
Madam, here comes my lord.

578
00:46:55,087 --> 00:46:57,954
- I like not that.
- What dost thou say?

579
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,491
Nothing, my lord.

580
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,554
- Madam, I take my leave.
- Farewell.

581
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,389
Was not that Cassio
parted from my wife?

582
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,532
Cassio, my lord.

583
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,700
How now, my lord?

584
00:47:13,272 --> 00:47:15,740
I have been talking with
a suitor here...

585
00:47:15,941 --> 00:47:18,000
...a man that languishes in
your displeasure.

586
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,700
Who is it you mean?

587
00:47:19,912 --> 00:47:21,937
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.

588
00:47:22,414 --> 00:47:25,042
Good my lord, if he be not one
that truly loves you...

589
00:47:25,251 --> 00:47:27,913
...I have no judgment in an honest face.

590
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,536
Excellent wretch!

591
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:49,904
Perdition catch my soul,
but I do love thee!

592
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:54,406
And when I love thee not...

593
00:47:55,381 --> 00:47:57,406
...chaos is come again.

594
00:47:59,018 --> 00:48:02,010
- My noble lord...
- What dost thou say, Iago?

595
00:48:02,221 --> 00:48:05,622
Did Cassio, when you wooed
my lady, know of your love?

596
00:48:05,824 --> 00:48:07,655
He did, from first to last.

597
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,058
Why dost thou ask?

598
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,599
But for a satisfaction of my thought...
No further harm.

599
00:48:22,808 --> 00:48:25,208
Why of thy thought, Iago?

600
00:48:25,477 --> 00:48:27,945
I did not think he had been
acquainted with her.

601
00:48:28,147 --> 00:48:29,512
O, yes.

602
00:48:30,382 --> 00:48:32,009
And went between us very oft.

603
00:48:32,217 --> 00:48:33,980
- Indeed!
- Indeed?

604
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,049
Ay, indeed.

605
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,689
Discernest thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

606
00:48:39,892 --> 00:48:41,189
Honest, my lord?

607
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,150
Honest? Ay, honest.

608
00:48:43,529 --> 00:48:45,224
My lord, for aught I know.

609
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:47,296
- What dost thou think?
- Think, my lord?

610
00:48:47,499 --> 00:48:50,161
"Think, my lord"!
By heaven, he echoes me.

611
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:51,961
Thou dost mean something.

612
00:48:52,171 --> 00:48:55,140
If thou dost love me,
show me thy thought.

613
00:48:56,275 --> 00:48:59,733
- My lord, you know I love you.
- I think thou dost.

614
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:02,579
And for I know
thou art full of love...

615
00:49:02,781 --> 00:49:04,180
...and honesty...

616
00:49:04,683 --> 00:49:07,447
...and weighest thy words
before thou givest them breath.

617
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,349
Therefore, these stops of thine
fright me the more.

618
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:13,389
For Cassio, I dare be sworn
I think that he is honest.

619
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,220
I think so too.

620
00:49:15,427 --> 00:49:16,860
Men should be what they seem.

621
00:49:17,062 --> 00:49:19,496
Or those that be not,
would they might seem none.

622
00:49:19,698 --> 00:49:21,461
Certain, men should be
what they seem.

623
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,135
Why then, I think Cassio's
an honest man.

624
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,099
Nay, yet there's more in this!

625
00:49:26,305 --> 00:49:28,569
I prithee, speak to me as to
thy thinkings.

626
00:49:28,774 --> 00:49:32,335
As thou dost ruminate, give thy
worst of thoughts the worst of words.

627
00:49:32,544 --> 00:49:34,409
I do beseech you...

628
00:49:35,547 --> 00:49:37,845
Though I perchance am
vicious in my guess...

629
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:42,009
...as I confess, it is my
nature's plague to spy into abuses...

630
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:44,451
...and oft my jealousy...

631
00:49:45,257 --> 00:49:48,124
...shapes faults that are not.

632
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,830
I entreat you then, it were not for
your quiet nor your good...

633
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:56,967
...nor for my manhood, honesty and
wisdom to let you know my thoughts.

634
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,601
What dost thou mean?

635
00:49:59,638 --> 00:50:02,766
Good name in man and woman,
dear my lord...

636
00:50:02,975 --> 00:50:06,342
...is the immediate jewel
of their souls.

637
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:09,070
Who steals my purse,
steals trash.

638
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:12,375
'Tis something, nothing.
'Twas mine, 'tis his...

639
00:50:12,584 --> 00:50:13,778
...has been slave to thousands.

640
00:50:13,986 --> 00:50:17,080
But he that filches from me
my good name...

641
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:19,757
...robs me of that
which not enriches him...

642
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:22,552
...and makes me poor indeed.

643
00:50:24,129 --> 00:50:27,758
By heaven, I'll know thy thought.

644
00:50:27,966 --> 00:50:29,763
You cannot, if my heart
were in your hand.

645
00:50:29,968 --> 00:50:32,835
Nor shall not,
while 'tis in my custody.

646
00:50:34,506 --> 00:50:37,339
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!

647
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:41,841
'Tis the green-eyed monster
that doth mock the meat it feeds on.

648
00:50:42,448 --> 00:50:43,540
Why?

649
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:48,013
Why is this?

650
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,879
Thinkest thou I'd make
a life of jealousy...

651
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:57,255
...to follow still the changes of
the moon with fresh suspicions? No!

652
00:50:58,297 --> 00:51:00,891
To be once in doubt
is once to be resolved.

653
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:04,194
Nor from mine own weak merits
shall I draw...

654
00:51:04,403 --> 00:51:09,136
...the smallest fear or doubt of her
revolt, for she had eyes and chose me.

655
00:51:09,341 --> 00:51:10,330
No, Iago...

656
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:15,312
...l'll see before I doubt.
When I doubt, prove.

657
00:51:15,514 --> 00:51:17,539
And on the proof,
there is no more but this:

658
00:51:17,749 --> 00:51:19,910
Away at once with love or jealousy.

659
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,745
I am glad, for now I have reason...

660
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:25,048
...to show the love and duty
that I bear you with franker spirit.

661
00:51:25,257 --> 00:51:29,216
Therefore, as I am bound,
receive it from me.

662
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,096
I speak not yet of proof.

663
00:51:38,103 --> 00:51:39,502
Look to your wife.

664
00:51:42,174 --> 00:51:45,439
Observe her well with Cassio.

665
00:51:46,512 --> 00:51:48,036
Look to it.

666
00:51:49,248 --> 00:51:51,409
I know our country disposition well.

667
00:51:51,617 --> 00:51:54,313
In Venice, they do
let heaven see the pranks...

668
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,511
...they dare not show their husbands.

669
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:59,213
Their best conscience
is not to leave it undone...

670
00:51:59,424 --> 00:52:01,392
...but keep it unknown.

671
00:52:08,033 --> 00:52:10,501
- Dost thou say so?
- She did deceive her father.

672
00:52:10,702 --> 00:52:13,364
And when she seemed to fear your looks,
she loved them most.

673
00:52:13,572 --> 00:52:16,132
- And so she did.
- Why, go to then.

674
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,175
But I am much to blame.

675
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:29,343
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
for too much loving you.

676
00:52:29,555 --> 00:52:31,546
I am bound to thee forever.

677
00:52:34,927 --> 00:52:36,519
I see this hath dashed your spirits.

678
00:52:36,728 --> 00:52:39,322
- Not a jot, not a jot.
- In faith, I fear it has.

679
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,022
I hope you consider what is spoke
comes from my love.

680
00:52:42,234 --> 00:52:44,168
But I do see you're moved.

681
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:47,736
I am to pray you not to strain
my speech to grosser issues...

682
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,067
...nor to larger reach than
to suspicion.

683
00:52:50,275 --> 00:52:51,902
Should you do so, my lord...

684
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:55,045
...my speech should fall into vile
success as my thoughts aimed not at.

685
00:52:55,247 --> 00:52:57,841
Cassio's my worthy friend...
My lord, you're moved.

686
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,381
No, not much moved!

687
00:52:59,585 --> 00:53:01,450
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

688
00:53:01,653 --> 00:53:04,713
Long live she so.
And long live you to think so.

689
00:53:05,457 --> 00:53:08,915
And yet, how nature erring from itself...

690
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:10,856
Ay, there's the point!

691
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:13,429
As to be bold not to enter
into a marriage...

692
00:53:13,632 --> 00:53:16,226
...of her own clime, complexion
and degree...

693
00:53:16,435 --> 00:53:20,371
...whereto we see in all things
nature tends...

694
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,299
One may smell in such
a will most rank...

695
00:53:23,508 --> 00:53:27,410
...foul disproportion,
thoughts unnatural.

696
00:53:40,192 --> 00:53:44,959
But pardon me. I do not in position
distinctly speak of her.

697
00:53:45,163 --> 00:53:49,725
Though I may fear, her will,
recoiling to her better judgment...

698
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:53,166
...may fall to match you with
her country forms...

699
00:53:53,372 --> 00:53:55,363
...and happily repent.

700
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:58,669
Farewell, farewell.

701
00:53:58,877 --> 00:54:02,335
If more thou dost perceive,
let me know more.

702
00:54:02,848 --> 00:54:04,247
Leave me, Iago.

703
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,474
My lord, I take my leave.

704
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,524
Why did I marry?

705
00:54:16,061 --> 00:54:18,552
My lord, I would
I might entreat your honor...

706
00:54:18,764 --> 00:54:21,028
...to scan this thing no farther.

707
00:54:21,233 --> 00:54:22,222
Leave it to time.

708
00:54:23,368 --> 00:54:25,268
Let me be thought too busy
in my fears...

709
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,496
- as worthy cause
I have to fear I am...

710
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,965
- and hold her free.

711
00:54:31,343 --> 00:54:32,776
Fear not my government.

712
00:54:40,285 --> 00:54:44,346
That we can call
these delicate creatures ours...

713
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:47,224
...and not their appetites!

714
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,425
How now, my dear Othello!

715
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:30,464
Your dinner and the generous
islanders by you invited...

716
00:55:30,669 --> 00:55:32,864
...do attend your presence.

717
00:55:33,505 --> 00:55:37,236
- I am to blame.
- Why do you speak so faintly?

718
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,970
Are you not well?

719
00:55:52,023 --> 00:55:55,151
Come, I'll go with you.

720
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,770
I have a thing for you.

721
00:56:49,981 --> 00:56:53,382
You have a thing for me?

722
00:56:53,985 --> 00:56:57,682
It is a common thing
to have a foolish wife.

723
00:56:57,889 --> 00:56:59,481
O, is that all?

724
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,951
What will you give me for
that handkerchief?

725
00:57:04,162 --> 00:57:05,789
What handkerchief?

726
00:57:06,198 --> 00:57:07,927
What handkerchief?

727
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:13,804
Why, that the Moor
first gave to Desdemona...

728
00:57:14,873 --> 00:57:18,502
...that which so often you did
bid me steal.

729
00:57:19,411 --> 00:57:23,711
Hast stolen it from her?

730
00:57:23,915 --> 00:57:24,904
No, faith.

731
00:57:25,383 --> 00:57:27,908
She let it drop by negligence.

732
00:57:43,034 --> 00:57:45,662
What will you do with it,
that you've been so earnest...

733
00:57:45,871 --> 00:57:47,532
...to have me filch it?

734
00:58:01,386 --> 00:58:03,581
Trifles light as air...

735
00:58:03,788 --> 00:58:08,725
...are to the jealous confirmations
strong as proofs of holy writ.

736
00:58:10,295 --> 00:58:11,990
This may do something.

737
00:58:52,637 --> 00:58:55,037
My life upon her faith.

738
00:59:02,881 --> 00:59:05,247
If she be false...

739
00:59:05,717 --> 00:59:07,844
...heaven mocks itself.

740
00:59:10,622 --> 00:59:12,453
I'll not believe it.

741
00:59:12,657 --> 00:59:17,151
Look to her, Moor,
if thou hast eyes to see.

742
00:59:17,629 --> 00:59:20,462
She has deceived her father...

743
00:59:20,665 --> 00:59:22,428
...and may thee.

744
00:59:47,392 --> 00:59:49,792
The Moor already changes
with my poison.

745
00:59:50,562 --> 00:59:54,191
Dangerous conceits
are in their natures, poisons.

746
00:59:54,399 --> 00:59:58,563
Which at the first
are scarce found to distaste.

747
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:02,467
But with a little
act upon the blood...

748
01:00:02,674 --> 01:00:06,633
...burn like the mines of sulfur.

749
01:00:07,712 --> 01:00:09,577
I did say so.

750
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,137
Look!

751
01:00:13,451 --> 01:00:16,284
Not poppy, nor mandragora...

752
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,319
...nor all the drowsy syrups
of the world...

753
01:00:18,523 --> 01:00:21,048
...shall ever medicine thee
to that sweet sleep...

754
01:00:21,259 --> 01:00:23,819
...which thou owedst yesterday.

755
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:27,631
Why, how now, general!

756
01:00:29,701 --> 01:00:30,895
Avaunt!

757
01:00:31,736 --> 01:00:32,998
Be gone!

758
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,901
Thou hast set me on the rack.

759
01:00:36,107 --> 01:00:39,873
I swear 'tis better to be much abused
than but to know it a little.

760
01:00:40,078 --> 01:00:41,238
How now, my lord!

761
01:00:41,446 --> 01:00:44,347
What sense had I
of her stolen hours of lust?

762
01:00:44,549 --> 01:00:48,645
I saw it not, thought it not,
it harmed not me.

763
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,912
I found not Cassio's kisses
on her lips.

764
01:00:51,122 --> 01:00:52,646
I am sorry to hear this.

765
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,382
I had been happy if the general camp,
pioneers and all...

766
01:00:55,593 --> 01:00:58,061
...had tasted her sweet body,
so I had nothing known.

767
01:00:58,263 --> 01:01:02,256
Now forever farewell the tranquil mind!

768
01:01:02,467 --> 01:01:03,866
Farewell content!

769
01:01:04,135 --> 01:01:07,161
Farewell the plumed troop and
wars that make ambition virtue.

770
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,862
O, farewell!

771
01:01:09,074 --> 01:01:11,542
Othello's occupation's gone.

772
01:01:11,743 --> 01:01:12,835
Is it possible, my lord?

773
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,605
Villain, be sure
thou prove my love a whore!

774
01:01:16,815 --> 01:01:17,839
Be sure of it.

775
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,914
Give me the ocular proof...

776
01:01:20,118 --> 01:01:22,416
...or by the worth
of mine eternal soul...

777
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,180
...thou hadst been better
been born a dog...

778
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,585
...than answer my waked wrath!

779
01:01:27,792 --> 01:01:29,487
Make me to see it...

780
01:01:29,694 --> 01:01:31,389
...or at least, so prove it...

781
01:01:31,596 --> 01:01:34,064
...that the probation bear no hinge...

782
01:01:34,265 --> 01:01:36,096
...nor loop to hang a doubt on...

783
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:38,292
...or woe upon thy life!
- My noble lord!

784
01:01:38,503 --> 01:01:42,303
If thou dost slander her
and torture me...

785
01:01:42,507 --> 01:01:45,601
...never pray more,
abandon all remorse!

786
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:48,301
On horror's head, horrors accumulate!

787
01:01:48,513 --> 01:01:50,344
Do deeds to make heaven weep...

788
01:01:50,548 --> 01:01:54,917
...for nothing to damnation
canst thou add greater than that!

789
01:01:57,889 --> 01:01:59,413
O grace!

790
01:02:02,327 --> 01:02:04,557
O heaven defend me!

791
01:02:05,864 --> 01:02:08,458
God buy you!
Take mine office.

792
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:11,635
To be direct and honest is not safe.

793
01:02:11,903 --> 01:02:15,669
I thank you for this profit.
From hence, I'll love no friend...

794
01:02:15,874 --> 01:02:18,240
...sith love breeds such offense!

795
01:02:20,545 --> 01:02:22,479
Nay, stay!

796
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,671
- Thou shouldst be honest.
- I should be wise...

797
01:02:24,883 --> 01:02:28,080
...for honesty's a fool,
and loses that it works for.

798
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,950
By the world,
I think my wife be honest...

799
01:02:31,156 --> 01:02:33,181
...and I think that she is not.

800
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:35,359
I think that thou art just
and that thou art not.

801
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,723
I'll have some proof.
Would I were satisfied!

802
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:44,763
I see, sir,
you are eaten up with passion.

803
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,460
I do repent me that I put it to you.

804
01:02:48,072 --> 01:02:50,199
- You would be satisfied?
- Would? Nay, I will.

805
01:02:50,408 --> 01:02:52,501
And may. But how?
How satisfied?

806
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:55,406
Would you grossly gape on?
Behold her topped?

807
01:02:55,613 --> 01:02:56,978
O, death and damnation!

808
01:02:57,182 --> 01:02:59,412
It were a tedious difficulty
to bring them to that prospect.

809
01:02:59,617 --> 01:03:01,141
Damn them then!
What shall I say?

810
01:03:01,352 --> 01:03:03,081
Where's satisfaction?

811
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:04,650
You would not see this...

812
01:03:04,856 --> 01:03:07,290
...were they as prime as goats,
as hot as monkeys...

813
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,723
But yet, I say, if imputation
and strong circumstances...

814
01:03:10,929 --> 01:03:14,695
...which lead directly to the door of
truth will give you satisfaction...

815
01:03:14,899 --> 01:03:16,560
...you might have it.

816
01:03:17,402 --> 01:03:20,633
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

817
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,931
I do not like the office.

818
01:03:23,141 --> 01:03:25,109
But sith I am entered in this cause...

819
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:29,110
...pricked to it by foolish honesty
and love, I will go on.

820
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:34,276
I lay with Cassio lately.

821
01:03:34,485 --> 01:03:38,444
And being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.

822
01:03:38,656 --> 01:03:40,817
There are a kind of men
so loose of soul...

823
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,357
...that in their sleeps will
mutter their affairs.

824
01:03:43,561 --> 01:03:45,893
One of this kind is Cassio.

825
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:49,498
In sleep, I heard him say:

826
01:03:50,335 --> 01:03:54,362
"Sweet Desdemona, let us be wary,
let us hide our loves."

827
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,702
And then, sir, would he grip
and wring my hand...

828
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,105
...cry, "Sweet creature!"
And then kiss me hard...

829
01:04:01,312 --> 01:04:04,543
...as if he plucked kisses from
the roots upon my lips...

830
01:04:04,749 --> 01:04:06,717
...then laid his leg over my thigh...

831
01:04:06,918 --> 01:04:09,216
...and sighed and kissed
and cried:

832
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,854
"Cursed fate
that gave thee to the Moor!"

833
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:14,183
- O monstrous!
- Nay, this was but his dream.

834
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,916
- Monstrous!
- Nay, yet be wise...

835
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,958
...yet we see nothing done.

836
01:04:18,162 --> 01:04:20,426
She may be honest yet.
Tell me but this:

837
01:04:20,632 --> 01:04:22,224
Did you not see
a handkerchief...

838
01:04:22,433 --> 01:04:24,492
...spotted with strawberries
in your wife's hand?

839
01:04:24,702 --> 01:04:27,068
I gave her such a one.
'Twas my first gift.

840
01:04:27,272 --> 01:04:29,467
I know not that.
But such a handkerchief...

841
01:04:29,674 --> 01:04:31,232
...l'm sure it was your wife's...

842
01:04:31,442 --> 01:04:34,570
...did I today see
Cassio wipe his beard with.

843
01:04:34,779 --> 01:04:36,713
O, if it be that...

844
01:04:58,903 --> 01:05:01,030
Where should I lose
that handkerchief, Emilia?

845
01:05:01,239 --> 01:05:02,206
I know not, madam.

846
01:05:02,407 --> 01:05:06,867
Believe me, I had rather lose
my purse full of crusadoes.

847
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:10,140
And, but my noble Moor
is true of mind...

848
01:05:10,348 --> 01:05:13,840
...and made of no such baseness as
jealous creatures are...

849
01:05:14,052 --> 01:05:16,782
...it were enough
to put him to ill thinking.

850
01:05:16,988 --> 01:05:19,286
- Is he not jealous?
- Who, he?

851
01:05:26,397 --> 01:05:27,989
How is it with you, my lord?

852
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:29,857
Well.

853
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:33,767
- And how do you, my lady?
- Well, my good lord.

854
01:05:34,272 --> 01:05:38,572
That handkerchief did an Egyptian
to my mother give.

855
01:05:38,776 --> 01:05:42,940
She was a charmer and could almost
read the thoughts of people.

856
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:46,139
She told her while she kept it,
'twould make her amiable...

857
01:05:46,351 --> 01:05:49,081
...and subdue my father entirely
to her love.

858
01:05:49,287 --> 01:05:52,723
But if she lost it
or made a gift of it...

859
01:05:52,924 --> 01:05:55,859
...my father's eye
should hold her loathed...

860
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,722
...and his spirits should hunt
after new fancies.

861
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,420
She dying...

862
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,598
...gave it me...

863
01:06:03,034 --> 01:06:06,765
...and bid me, when my fate would
have me wived...

864
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:08,165
...I give it her.

865
01:06:08,373 --> 01:06:09,897
I did so.

866
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:12,343
And take heed on it.

867
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:16,202
Make it a darling
like your precious eye.

868
01:06:16,881 --> 01:06:19,475
To lose it or give it away...

869
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:23,916
...were such perdition
as nothing else could match.

870
01:06:24,288 --> 01:06:25,687
Is it possible?

871
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:27,517
'Tis true.

872
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:29,890
There's magic in the web of it.

873
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,685
Then would to God I had never seen it!

874
01:06:32,897 --> 01:06:34,023
Wherefore?

875
01:06:34,232 --> 01:06:35,995
Why do you speak
so startingly and rash?

876
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,191
Is it lost? Is it gone?
Is it out of the way?

877
01:06:38,403 --> 01:06:39,927
Heaven bless us!

878
01:06:40,138 --> 01:06:41,605
- Say you?
- It is not lost.

879
01:06:41,806 --> 01:06:43,501
- But what an if it were?
- How?

880
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,471
I say it is not lost!

881
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:47,902
Fetch it.
Let me see it.

882
01:06:48,112 --> 01:06:51,309
Why, so I can, sir.
But I will not now.

883
01:06:51,516 --> 01:06:53,746
This is a trick
to put me from my suit.

884
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:56,852
I pray you,
let Cassio be received again.

885
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:59,079
Fetch me my handkerchief.
My mind misgives.

886
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:01,884
Come. You'll never meet
a more sufficient man.

887
01:07:02,093 --> 01:07:04,561
- The handkerchief!
- I pray you, talk me of Cassio...

888
01:07:04,762 --> 01:07:08,027
...a man that all his time hath founded
his good fortunes on your love.

889
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:10,359
The handkerchief!

890
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:12,501
In faith, you are to blame.

891
01:07:15,339 --> 01:07:17,273
'Zounds!

892
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:27,740
Is not this man jealous?

893
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,880
I never saw this before.

894
01:07:31,222 --> 01:07:34,055
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.

895
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:40,495
They are all but stomachs,
and we all but food.

896
01:07:40,698 --> 01:07:43,758
They eat us hungrily.
And when they are full...

897
01:07:43,968 --> 01:07:45,026
...they belch us.

898
01:07:50,675 --> 01:07:52,939
If I give my wife a handkerchief...

899
01:07:53,144 --> 01:07:54,634
...'tis hers, and being hers...

900
01:07:54,846 --> 01:07:56,939
...she may, I think,
bestow it on any man.

901
01:07:57,148 --> 01:08:00,413
What if I had said
I had seen him do you wrong?

902
01:08:01,185 --> 01:08:02,413
Or heard him say...

903
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,212
Hath he said anything?

904
01:08:04,689 --> 01:08:07,089
He hath, my lord.
But no more than he'll unswear.

905
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:10,454
- What hath he said?
- Faith, that he...

906
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:12,520
...did...

907
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:20,460
I know not what he did.

908
01:08:23,441 --> 01:08:24,408
What?

909
01:08:26,611 --> 01:08:27,703
What?

910
01:08:30,281 --> 01:08:31,543
Lie...

911
01:08:32,617 --> 01:08:33,879
With her?

912
01:08:34,785 --> 01:08:36,013
With her...

913
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,256
...on her, what you will.

914
01:08:43,694 --> 01:08:45,491
Lie with her?

915
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:56,803
Lie on her?

916
01:08:58,876 --> 01:09:01,071
'Zounds, that's fulsome!

917
01:09:45,022 --> 01:09:48,014
Work on, my medicine. Work!

918
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:52,894
Thus credulous fools are caught.

919
01:09:53,097 --> 01:09:56,794
And many worthy and chaste dames,
even thus...

920
01:09:57,001 --> 01:10:00,664
...all guiltless, meet reproach.

921
01:10:05,142 --> 01:10:07,007
What ho, my lord?

922
01:10:07,445 --> 01:10:08,878
My lord, I say! Othello!

923
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,638
What's the matter?

924
01:10:11,382 --> 01:10:12,781
My lord is in an epilepsy.

925
01:10:12,984 --> 01:10:14,975
This is his second fit.
He had one yesterday.

926
01:10:15,186 --> 01:10:17,120
- Rub him about the temples.
- Forbear!

927
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:19,619
The lethargy
must have his quiet course.

928
01:10:19,824 --> 01:10:22,884
If not, he foams at mouth and
breaks out to savage madness.

929
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:26,359
Look, he stirs.
Do you withdraw yourself a little.

930
01:10:26,564 --> 01:10:28,293
He will recover straight.

931
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:32,868
When he is gone, I would
on great occasion speak with you.

932
01:10:35,072 --> 01:10:37,097
How is it, general?

933
01:10:39,043 --> 01:10:40,908
Did he confess it?

934
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:48,051
Have you not hurt your head?

935
01:10:48,653 --> 01:10:50,086
Dost thou mock me?

936
01:10:50,554 --> 01:10:52,249
I mock you?

937
01:10:53,524 --> 01:10:54,548
No, by heaven.

938
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:59,858
Good sir, whilst you were here,
overwhelmed with your grief...

939
01:11:00,064 --> 01:11:01,258
...Cassio came hither.

940
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:03,660
I shifted him away and
laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy...

941
01:11:03,868 --> 01:11:07,929
...bade him anon return and here speak
with me, the which he promised.

942
01:11:08,506 --> 01:11:11,498
Do but encave yourself...

943
01:11:12,843 --> 01:11:15,903
...and mark the jeers, the gibes,
and notable scorns...

944
01:11:16,113 --> 01:11:18,240
...that dwell in
every region of his face.

945
01:11:18,449 --> 01:11:20,440
I will make him tell
the tale anew:

946
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,848
Where, how, how oft,
how long ago...

947
01:11:24,055 --> 01:11:28,458
...and when he hath and is again
to cope your wife.

948
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:31,389
Marry, patience!

949
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:36,227
Now, will I question Cassio of Bianca.

950
01:11:36,434 --> 01:11:38,459
He, when he hears of her...

951
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,035
...cannot refrain
from the excess of laughter.

952
01:11:41,238 --> 01:11:43,365
How do you now, lieutenant?

953
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,308
As he shall smile...

954
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:47,374
...Othello...

955
01:11:47,778 --> 01:11:49,143
...shall go mad.

956
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:51,974
You give me that same title,
whose want even kills me.

957
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:55,675
Ply Desdemona well
and you are sure on it.

958
01:11:55,886 --> 01:12:00,823
Now, if this suit
lay in Bianca's power...

959
01:12:01,325 --> 01:12:03,657
...how quickly should you speed!

960
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:06,591
Poor wretch!
I think, in faith, she loves me.

961
01:12:07,998 --> 01:12:09,659
Look how he laughs already!

962
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,995
She says that you shall
marry her. Do you intend it?

963
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:14,762
I marry her? What?

964
01:12:15,673 --> 01:12:17,436
I prithee, bear
some charity to my wit.

965
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:21,372
The cry goes that
you shall marry her.

966
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:24,275
- Prithee, say true.
- I am a very villain else.

967
01:12:24,849 --> 01:12:27,181
This is the monkey's own giving out.

968
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:30,911
She hangs and lolls and weeps upon me.
So hales...

969
01:12:31,122 --> 01:12:34,250
I see that nose of yours...

970
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:37,018
...but not that
dog I shall throw it to!

971
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:41,426
Before me!
Look, where she comes.

972
01:12:42,867 --> 01:12:46,928
How is it with you,
most fair Bianca?

973
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:49,562
Whence came this?

974
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:53,335
This is some token from
a newer friend.

975
01:12:53,544 --> 01:12:54,602
No, by my faith.

976
01:12:54,812 --> 01:12:55,904
Why, whose is it?

977
01:12:56,113 --> 01:12:58,946
I know not.
I found it in my chamber.

978
01:12:59,617 --> 01:13:02,609
A likely story that you should
find it in your chamber...

979
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,515
...and not know who left it.

980
01:13:04,722 --> 01:13:06,417
This is some minx's token.

981
01:13:07,191 --> 01:13:08,215
There!

982
01:13:08,692 --> 01:13:12,093
Give it to your hobbyhorse,
wheresoever you had it.

983
01:13:12,296 --> 01:13:15,231
How now, my sweet Bianca!

984
01:13:16,133 --> 01:13:18,533
How now, how now!

985
01:13:21,071 --> 01:13:24,973
If you come to
supper tonight, you may.

986
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:29,971
If you do not, come
when you are next prepared for.

987
01:13:30,581 --> 01:13:32,674
After her, after her.

988
01:13:32,883 --> 01:13:35,351
Faith, I must.
She'll rail in the streets else.

989
01:13:35,553 --> 01:13:37,578
- Will you sup there?
- I intend to.

990
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:40,655
I may chance to see you, for
I would fain speak with you.

991
01:13:40,858 --> 01:13:43,918
- Prithee, come.
- Go to, say no more.

992
01:13:56,507 --> 01:13:59,704
How shall I murder him, Iago?

993
01:14:00,077 --> 01:14:03,103
Did you perceive
how he laughed at his vice?

994
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:09,085
And did you see the handkerchief?

995
01:14:13,924 --> 01:14:15,118
Damn her!

996
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:17,418
Lewd minx!

997
01:14:17,761 --> 01:14:19,194
Damn her!

998
01:14:20,698 --> 01:14:22,666
A fine woman, a fair woman,
a sweet woman!

999
01:14:22,867 --> 01:14:23,856
You must forget that.

1000
01:14:24,068 --> 01:14:27,663
Let her perish, and be damned tonight,
for she shall not live.

1001
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:30,033
No, my heart is turned to stone.

1002
01:14:30,241 --> 01:14:33,301
I strike it,
and it hurts my hand.

1003
01:14:33,978 --> 01:14:37,778
But the pity of it, Iago!
O, Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

1004
01:14:37,982 --> 01:14:39,449
Nay, that's not your way.

1005
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:40,981
Damn her!

1006
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:44,017
- Cuckold me?
- O, 'tis foul in her.

1007
01:14:44,221 --> 01:14:47,384
- And with mine officer!
- That's fouler.

1008
01:14:47,591 --> 01:14:50,560
I'd have him nine years a-killing.

1009
01:14:55,933 --> 01:14:58,026
Look here, Iago.

1010
01:14:58,235 --> 01:15:01,329
All my fond love thus...

1011
01:15:03,007 --> 01:15:06,773
...do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.

1012
01:15:09,847 --> 01:15:13,283
Arise, black vengeance, from
thy hollow cell.

1013
01:15:13,484 --> 01:15:17,614
Yield up, O love, thy crown
and hearted throne to tyrannous hate.

1014
01:15:19,123 --> 01:15:22,854
Now, by yond marble heaven...

1015
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:26,086
...in the due reverence
of a sacred vow...

1016
01:15:26,297 --> 01:15:28,197
...I here engage my words.

1017
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:35,867
Witness, you ever-burning
lights above...

1018
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,735
...you elements
that clip us round about.

1019
01:15:38,943 --> 01:15:42,037
Witness that here, Iago doth give up...

1020
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:45,682
...the execution of his wit, hands...

1021
01:15:46,283 --> 01:15:47,341
...heart...

1022
01:15:47,785 --> 01:15:50,253
...to wronged Othello's service.

1023
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:52,384
Let him command.

1024
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:55,080
And to obey shall be
in me remorse...

1025
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:57,726
...what bloody business ever.

1026
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:18,706
I greet thy love.

1027
01:16:22,553 --> 01:16:24,521
Get me some poison,
Iago, this night.

1028
01:16:24,722 --> 01:16:26,690
I'll not expostulate with her...

1029
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:29,757
...lest her body and beauty
unprovide my mind again.

1030
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,355
Do it not with poison.

1031
01:16:32,563 --> 01:16:37,296
Strangle her in her bed,
even the bed she hath contaminated.

1032
01:16:37,501 --> 01:16:41,995
Good, good, the justice of it pleases.
Very good.

1033
01:16:43,107 --> 01:16:44,096
And for Cassio?

1034
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:47,334
Let me hear thee say,
Michael Cassio is not alive.

1035
01:16:49,747 --> 01:16:54,241
My friend is dead.
You shall know more by midnight.

1036
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,141
Excellent. Good.

1037
01:16:57,254 --> 01:16:59,313
Now art thou my lieutenant.

1038
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:09,397
I am your own...

1039
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,099
...forever.

1040
01:17:18,809 --> 01:17:21,277
God save you, worthy general!

1041
01:17:21,945 --> 01:17:23,037
With all my heart, sir.

1042
01:17:23,247 --> 01:17:25,681
The Duke and Senators
of Venice greet you.

1043
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:30,616
I kiss the instrument of their pleasure.
Welcome, Signor Gratiano.

1044
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:43,025
What's the news, uncle?

1045
01:17:45,135 --> 01:17:47,603
Good cousin Lodovico?

1046
01:17:49,406 --> 01:17:50,930
I am glad to see you, signor.

1047
01:17:51,141 --> 01:17:53,701
- Welcome to Cyprus.
- I thank you.

1048
01:17:53,911 --> 01:17:55,037
How does Lieutenant Cassio?

1049
01:17:57,848 --> 01:17:59,509
Lives, sir.

1050
01:17:59,817 --> 01:18:01,114
Cousin...

1051
01:18:01,351 --> 01:18:05,685
...there's fallen between him and
my lord an unkind breach.

1052
01:18:06,757 --> 01:18:09,692
- But you shall make all well.
- Are you sure of that?

1053
01:18:09,893 --> 01:18:12,361
- My lord?
- "This fail you not to do..."

1054
01:18:12,729 --> 01:18:15,664
He did not call.
Is there division between my lord...

1055
01:18:15,866 --> 01:18:17,857
...and Cassio?
- A most unhappy one.

1056
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:21,595
I would do much to atone them,
for the love I bear to Cassio.

1057
01:18:21,805 --> 01:18:23,670
Fire and brimstone!

1058
01:18:23,874 --> 01:18:24,932
My lord?

1059
01:18:25,142 --> 01:18:26,166
Are you wise?

1060
01:18:27,778 --> 01:18:30,212
What? Is he angry?

1061
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:32,041
Maybe the letter moved him.

1062
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:35,013
For as I think,
they do command him home...

1063
01:18:35,219 --> 01:18:37,653
...deputing Cassio in his government.

1064
01:18:39,156 --> 01:18:40,748
By my troth, I'm glad on it.

1065
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:42,220
Indeed!

1066
01:18:44,962 --> 01:18:45,951
My lord?

1067
01:18:46,163 --> 01:18:48,063
I am glad to see you mad.

1068
01:18:48,632 --> 01:18:50,190
Why, sweet Othello?

1069
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,424
Devil!

1070
01:18:57,674 --> 01:18:58,936
I have not deserved this.

1071
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:04,340
This would not be believed in Venice,
though I should swear I saw it.

1072
01:19:04,982 --> 01:19:08,213
'Tis very much.
Make her amends. She weeps.

1073
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:13,181
If that the earth could teem with
women's tears, each drop she falls...

1074
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:14,880
...would prove a crocodile.

1075
01:19:15,092 --> 01:19:16,491
Out of my sight!

1076
01:19:17,227 --> 01:19:19,627
I would not stay to offend you.

1077
01:19:25,502 --> 01:19:27,629
You have seen nothing then?

1078
01:19:28,372 --> 01:19:32,274
- Nor ever heard, nor suspected.
- You've seen Cassio and she together.

1079
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:36,344
I saw no harm. I heard each syllable
that breath made up between them.

1080
01:19:36,547 --> 01:19:38,640
- What! Did they never whisper?
- Never.

1081
01:19:38,849 --> 01:19:42,148
Nor send you to fetch her fan,
her gloves, her mask, nothing?

1082
01:19:42,352 --> 01:19:43,614
Never.

1083
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,712
That's strange.

1084
01:19:45,923 --> 01:19:50,155
I durst, my lord, to wager she
is honest, lay down my soul at stake.

1085
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:55,056
If you think other, remove your thought.
It doth abuse your bosom.

1086
01:19:55,265 --> 01:19:56,789
Bid her come hither.

1087
01:19:57,601 --> 01:19:58,898
Go!

1088
01:20:01,238 --> 01:20:05,572
She says enough, but she's a simple
bawd that cannot say as much.

1089
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:09,874
This is a subtle whore.

1090
01:20:10,647 --> 01:20:11,978
But look, she comes.

1091
01:20:14,084 --> 01:20:16,018
What is your pleasure?

1092
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,245
Let me see your eyes.

1093
01:20:19,223 --> 01:20:21,020
Look in my face.

1094
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:23,957
What horrible fancy's this?

1095
01:20:24,161 --> 01:20:26,629
What art thou?

1096
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:29,628
Your wife, my lord.
Your true and loyal wife.

1097
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:31,698
Come, swear it.

1098
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:36,138
Damn thyself.

1099
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:38,638
Swear thou art honest.

1100
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:44,476
Heaven doth truly know it.

1101
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:48,078
Heaven truly knows
thou art false as hell.

1102
01:20:48,919 --> 01:20:50,750
To whom, my lord?

1103
01:20:52,856 --> 01:20:54,551
With whom?

1104
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:57,686
How am I false?

1105
01:20:58,362 --> 01:20:59,761
O, Desdemona!

1106
01:20:59,963 --> 01:21:02,022
Away, away!

1107
01:21:04,167 --> 01:21:05,862
Alas the heavy day!

1108
01:21:06,637 --> 01:21:07,968
Why do you weep?

1109
01:21:12,776 --> 01:21:16,177
Am I the motive
of these tears, my lord?

1110
01:21:16,713 --> 01:21:19,511
Had it pleased heaven to
try me with affliction...

1111
01:21:19,716 --> 01:21:23,117
...had they rained all kinds
of sores and shames on my bare head...

1112
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,256
...I should have found in some
place of my soul a drop of patience.

1113
01:21:27,457 --> 01:21:30,893
But alas, there, where
I have garnered up my heart...

1114
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:33,528
...where either I must live
or bear no life...

1115
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:37,894
...the fountain from the which
my current runs or else dries up...

1116
01:21:38,101 --> 01:21:42,834
...to be discarded or keep as a cistern
for foul toads to knot and gender in!

1117
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,064
O thou...

1118
01:21:45,108 --> 01:21:48,236
...who art so lovely fair...

1119
01:21:49,346 --> 01:21:53,840
...and smells so sweet
that the sense aches at thee.

1120
01:21:55,919 --> 01:21:59,013
Wouldst thou had never been born!

1121
01:22:01,224 --> 01:22:04,387
Alas, what ignorant
sin have I committed?

1122
01:22:04,594 --> 01:22:07,927
Was this fair paper
made to write "whore" upon?

1123
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:11,692
- What committed! Impudent strumpet!
- By heaven, you do me wrong.

1124
01:22:11,902 --> 01:22:14,234
- Are you not a strumpet?
- I am a Christian!

1125
01:22:14,438 --> 01:22:15,598
What! Not a whore?

1126
01:22:15,806 --> 01:22:18,434
- No, as I shall be saved.
- Is it possible?

1127
01:22:19,176 --> 01:22:21,041
Heaven forgive us!

1128
01:22:22,779 --> 01:22:24,974
I cry you mercy then.

1129
01:22:25,515 --> 01:22:30,282
I took you for that cunning whore of
Venice that married with Othello.

1130
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:34,657
You, mistress...

1131
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:38,822
...who have the office opposite
St. Peter and keeps the gate of hell!

1132
01:22:41,064 --> 01:22:42,929
You, you, ay, you!

1133
01:22:46,069 --> 01:22:48,264
We have done our course.

1134
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:52,134
I pray you, turn the key,
and keep our counsel.

1135
01:22:54,644 --> 01:22:56,771
Am I that name, Iago?

1136
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:59,642
What name, fair lady?

1137
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:02,441
Such as my lord did say I was.

1138
01:23:02,652 --> 01:23:04,449
He called her whore.

1139
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:05,947
Why did he so?

1140
01:23:06,623 --> 01:23:08,147
I do not know.

1141
01:23:08,792 --> 01:23:11,386
I am sure I am none such.

1142
01:23:12,829 --> 01:23:14,820
Do not weep!

1143
01:23:15,098 --> 01:23:16,622
Do not weep.

1144
01:23:16,833 --> 01:23:18,733
Alas the day!

1145
01:23:19,102 --> 01:23:21,400
Hath she forsook
so many noble matches...

1146
01:23:21,605 --> 01:23:24,597
...her father, her country,
her friends to be called whore?

1147
01:23:24,941 --> 01:23:26,932
Would it not make one weep?

1148
01:23:30,947 --> 01:23:32,346
It is my wretched fortune.

1149
01:23:33,049 --> 01:23:35,574
O, good Iago...

1150
01:23:36,286 --> 01:23:39,653
...what shall I do to win my lord again?

1151
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,085
Good friend...

1152
01:23:42,926 --> 01:23:44,518
...go to him...

1153
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:49,594
...for by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him.

1154
01:23:52,035 --> 01:23:53,024
Here I kneel:

1155
01:23:58,942 --> 01:24:02,469
If ever my will did trespass
against his love...

1156
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:08,313
...either in discourse
of thought or actual deed...

1157
01:24:09,619 --> 01:24:12,952
...or that mine eyes, mine ears...

1158
01:24:14,057 --> 01:24:18,323
...or any sense, delighted
them in any other form...

1159
01:24:20,197 --> 01:24:22,427
...or that I do not yet...

1160
01:24:22,632 --> 01:24:25,829
...and ever did and ever will...

1161
01:24:27,404 --> 01:24:30,862
...though he do shake me
off to beggarly divorcement...

1162
01:24:31,208 --> 01:24:33,642
...love him dearly...

1163
01:24:34,511 --> 01:24:37,173
...comfort forswear me!

1164
01:24:40,817 --> 01:24:43,479
Unkindness may do much...

1165
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:47,787
...and his unkindness
may defeat my life...

1166
01:24:47,991 --> 01:24:50,084
...but never taint my love.

1167
01:24:53,830 --> 01:24:56,128
I cannot say "whore."

1168
01:24:56,533 --> 01:24:59,559
It does abhor me now
I speak the word.

1169
01:24:59,903 --> 01:25:02,531
To do the act that might
the addition earn...

1170
01:25:02,739 --> 01:25:06,140
...not the world's mass
of vanity could make me!

1171
01:25:06,443 --> 01:25:10,106
I pray you, be content.

1172
01:25:11,081 --> 01:25:12,548
'Tis but his humor:

1173
01:25:12,749 --> 01:25:16,913
The business of the state does him
offense, and he does chide with you.

1174
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:21,623
- If it were no other...
- It is so, I warrant.

1175
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,793
Hark, how these
instruments summon to supper!

1176
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:29,966
The messengers of Venice stay the meat.

1177
01:25:31,468 --> 01:25:34,733
Go in and weep not.

1178
01:25:35,238 --> 01:25:39,197
All things shall be well.

1179
01:25:55,191 --> 01:25:59,218
- How now, Roderigo?
- Thou deals unjustly with me.

1180
01:25:59,429 --> 01:26:02,364
- What in the contrary?
- Every day thou daffest me.

1181
01:26:02,566 --> 01:26:04,295
I will no longer endure it.

1182
01:26:04,501 --> 01:26:08,699
Nor am I persuaded to put up in
peace what already I've suffered.

1183
01:26:08,905 --> 01:26:12,466
- Will you hear me?
- Your words and performance are not kin.

1184
01:26:12,676 --> 01:26:15,839
- You charge me most unjustly.
- With nought but truth!

1185
01:26:18,815 --> 01:26:22,410
I will make myself known to Desdemona.

1186
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:31,319
If she will return me my jewels...

1187
01:26:31,528 --> 01:26:35,862
...I will give over my suit
and repent my unlawful solicitation.

1188
01:26:36,333 --> 01:26:37,823
If not...

1189
01:26:39,436 --> 01:26:44,271
...assure yourself, I will seek
satisfaction of you.

1190
01:26:46,643 --> 01:26:48,508
You have said now.

1191
01:26:48,712 --> 01:26:52,307
Ay, and said nothing but what
I protest intendment of doing.

1192
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:55,650
Why, now I see...

1193
01:26:56,987 --> 01:26:58,921
...there's mettle in thee.

1194
01:26:59,122 --> 01:27:02,990
And even from now do build on thee
a better opinion than before.

1195
01:27:03,193 --> 01:27:05,127
Give me thy hand, Roderigo.

1196
01:27:06,329 --> 01:27:09,560
Thou hast taken against me a just
exception. Yet, I protest...

1197
01:27:09,766 --> 01:27:12,667
...l've dealt most justly in thy affair.
- It's not appeared.

1198
01:27:12,869 --> 01:27:16,464
I grant that and your suspicions
are not without wit and judgment.

1199
01:27:16,673 --> 01:27:19,471
But if thou hast
that in thee indeed...

1200
01:27:19,676 --> 01:27:21,769
...which I have greater reason to
believe now...

1201
01:27:21,978 --> 01:27:26,244
...I mean purpose, courage and valor,
this night show it.

1202
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:30,886
If thou the next night following
enjoy not Desdemona...

1203
01:27:31,087 --> 01:27:35,990
...take me from this world
and devise engines on my life.

1204
01:27:39,896 --> 01:27:41,193
Well...

1205
01:27:43,733 --> 01:27:44,961
...what is it?

1206
01:27:55,412 --> 01:27:59,872
This is the night that either
makes me or fordoes me quite.

1207
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:24,399
Trouble yourself no further, sir.

1208
01:28:24,607 --> 01:28:27,701
O, pardon me.
It will do me good to walk.

1209
01:28:27,911 --> 01:28:29,606
Desdemona!

1210
01:28:31,715 --> 01:28:34,843
- My lord?
- Get thee to bed on the instant.

1211
01:28:35,051 --> 01:28:38,020
I shall return forthwith.
Dismiss your attendant there.

1212
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:40,386
Look it be done.

1213
01:28:41,624 --> 01:28:43,558
I will, my lord.

1214
01:28:45,962 --> 01:28:47,224
Madam, good night.

1215
01:28:47,597 --> 01:28:52,193
- I humbly thank your ladyship.
- Your honor is most welcome.

1216
01:28:52,402 --> 01:28:53,926
Will you walk, sir?

1217
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:58,507
Dismiss me?

1218
01:28:59,609 --> 01:29:01,201
'Twas his bidding.

1219
01:29:02,245 --> 01:29:03,678
I would you'd never seen him.

1220
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,677
So would not I!

1221
01:29:12,989 --> 01:29:14,047
Prithee...

1222
01:29:14,858 --> 01:29:16,655
...unpin me here.

1223
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:38,906
The poor soul sat sighing

1224
01:29:39,482 --> 01:29:43,282
By a sycamore tree

1225
01:29:46,956 --> 01:29:49,083
My mother had a maid called Barbary.

1226
01:29:49,292 --> 01:29:52,193
She was in love
and he she loved proved mad...

1227
01:29:52,395 --> 01:29:54,363
...and did forsake her.

1228
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,763
She had a song of "Willow."

1229
01:29:58,568 --> 01:30:02,060
An old thing it was,
but it expressed her fortune.

1230
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:05,206
And she died singing it.

1231
01:30:07,877 --> 01:30:11,040
That song tonight
will not go from my mind.

1232
01:30:12,549 --> 01:30:17,145
The poor soul sat sighing

1233
01:30:17,754 --> 01:30:21,485
By a sycamore tree

1234
01:30:22,025 --> 01:30:25,586
Sing willow, willow, willow

1235
01:30:27,463 --> 01:30:30,455
Her hand on her bosom

1236
01:30:30,667 --> 01:30:33,363
Her head on her knee

1237
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:37,972
Sing willow, willow, willow

1238
01:30:42,846 --> 01:30:46,873
Her salt tears fell from her

1239
01:30:48,051 --> 01:30:51,578
And softened the stones

1240
01:30:53,523 --> 01:30:57,186
Sing willow, willow, willow

1241
01:31:00,196 --> 01:31:03,359
So get thee gone, good night.

1242
01:31:05,635 --> 01:31:08,570
Mine eyes do itch.
Does that bode weeping?

1243
01:31:08,771 --> 01:31:10,500
'Tis neither here nor there.

1244
01:31:10,874 --> 01:31:13,206
I have heard it said so.

1245
01:31:14,577 --> 01:31:16,044
O, these men...

1246
01:31:16,579 --> 01:31:18,308
...these men!

1247
01:31:19,949 --> 01:31:24,511
Dost thou in conscience think,
tell me Emilia, that there be women...

1248
01:31:24,754 --> 01:31:27,655
...do abuse their husbands
in such gross kind?

1249
01:31:27,857 --> 01:31:29,381
There be some, no question.

1250
01:31:29,726 --> 01:31:31,990
Wouldst thou do such a deed?

1251
01:31:32,729 --> 01:31:35,129
- Would not you?
- No, by this heavenly light.

1252
01:31:35,331 --> 01:31:37,196
Nor I by this heavenly light.

1253
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,527
I might do it as well in the dark.

1254
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:44,128
Wouldst thou do
such a deed for all the world?

1255
01:31:44,674 --> 01:31:48,303
The world's a huge thing.
It is a great price for a small vice.

1256
01:31:48,845 --> 01:31:50,642
I think thou wouldst not.

1257
01:31:50,847 --> 01:31:54,214
I think I should
and undo it again when I'd done it.

1258
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:56,381
For the whole world?

1259
01:31:56,586 --> 01:32:00,852
Who'd not make her husband
a cuckold to make him a monarch?

1260
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:02,649
I should venture purgatory for it.

1261
01:32:02,859 --> 01:32:04,986
I don't think there
is any such woman.

1262
01:32:05,194 --> 01:32:06,525
Yes...

1263
01:32:07,997 --> 01:32:08,895
...a dozen.

1264
01:32:09,766 --> 01:32:13,133
But I do think it is their
husbands' faults if wives do fall.

1265
01:32:14,103 --> 01:32:16,571
Say that they slack their duties...

1266
01:32:17,307 --> 01:32:20,242
...and pour our treasures
into foreign laps.

1267
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:24,769
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
throwing restraint upon us.

1268
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,613
Or say they strike us.

1269
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:29,443
Why, we have galls...

1270
01:32:29,686 --> 01:32:33,645
...and though we have some grace,
yet have we some revenge.

1271
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:39,258
Let husbands know their wives
have sense like them.

1272
01:32:40,063 --> 01:32:41,792
They see and smell...

1273
01:32:42,165 --> 01:32:45,999
...and have their palates both for
sweet and sour as husbands have.

1274
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:50,696
What is it that they do
when they change us for others?

1275
01:32:51,474 --> 01:32:53,271
Is it sport?

1276
01:32:54,143 --> 01:32:55,838
I think it is.

1277
01:32:56,412 --> 01:32:58,903
And doth affection breed it?

1278
01:32:59,749 --> 01:33:01,478
I think it doth.

1279
01:33:02,585 --> 01:33:05,679
Is it frailty that thus errs?

1280
01:33:05,888 --> 01:33:08,914
I think so too.

1281
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:11,650
And have not we affections...

1282
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:14,455
...desires for sport,
and frailty as men have?

1283
01:33:15,264 --> 01:33:17,630
Then let them use us well.

1284
01:33:17,834 --> 01:33:22,567
Else let them know the ills we do,
their ills instruct us so.

1285
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:28,740
Good night.

1286
01:33:36,586 --> 01:33:40,044
- Be near at hand, I may miscarry in it.
- Here, at thy hand...

1287
01:33:40,256 --> 01:33:43,555
...be bold, and take thy stand.

1288
01:33:49,799 --> 01:33:53,701
'Tis but a man gone.
Forth my sword, he dies!

1289
01:33:54,303 --> 01:33:57,704
If Cassio do remain, he hath a daily
beauty in his life that makes me ugly.

1290
01:33:57,907 --> 01:34:00,137
Besides, he may unfold me to the Moor...

1291
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:03,437
...there stand I in much peril.
No, he must die.

1292
01:34:18,227 --> 01:34:19,285
Villain, thou diest!

1293
01:34:26,235 --> 01:34:27,725
Help, ho!

1294
01:34:28,671 --> 01:34:30,195
O villain that I am!

1295
01:34:31,507 --> 01:34:32,701
Murder! Murder!

1296
01:34:36,579 --> 01:34:37,705
Murder!

1297
01:34:38,781 --> 01:34:42,444
It is some mischance.
The cry is very direful!

1298
01:34:43,586 --> 01:34:44,848
Help!

1299
01:34:46,089 --> 01:34:47,386
O wretched villain!

1300
01:34:49,559 --> 01:34:50,583
Who's there?

1301
01:34:51,828 --> 01:34:54,524
- Who is this that cries on murder?
- We do not know.

1302
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:55,719
Did you hear a cry?

1303
01:34:55,932 --> 01:34:58,696
Here, for heaven's sake, help me!

1304
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:02,803
Give me some help.

1305
01:35:03,005 --> 01:35:05,769
O, me, lieutenant!
What villains have done this?

1306
01:35:05,975 --> 01:35:08,671
I think one is hereabout
and cannot make away.

1307
01:35:08,878 --> 01:35:10,402
Treacherous villains!

1308
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,405
What are you there?
Come and give some help!

1309
01:35:13,616 --> 01:35:15,743
- O, help me here!
- That's one of them!

1310
01:35:32,902 --> 01:35:36,030
O murderous slave!
O villain!

1311
01:35:42,145 --> 01:35:45,012
O, damned Iago.

1312
01:35:46,782 --> 01:35:48,807
Inhuman dog!

1313
01:35:54,891 --> 01:35:58,884
Where be these bloody thieves?
Ho! Murder! Murder!

1314
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:00,386
It is the cause...

1315
01:37:01,958 --> 01:37:04,256
...it is the cause, my soul.

1316
01:37:05,628 --> 01:37:09,587
Let me not name it to you,
you chaste stars!

1317
01:37:10,967 --> 01:37:12,696
It is the cause.

1318
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:16,266
Yet I'll not shed her blood...

1319
01:37:16,472 --> 01:37:19,600
...nor scar that whiter skin of hers
than snow...

1320
01:37:19,842 --> 01:37:22,834
...and smooth as monumental alabaster.

1321
01:37:25,281 --> 01:37:26,976
Yet she must die...

1322
01:37:28,484 --> 01:37:31,385
...else she'll betray more men.

1323
01:37:39,996 --> 01:37:41,793
Put out the light...

1324
01:37:44,767 --> 01:37:46,064
...and then...

1325
01:37:47,003 --> 01:37:48,800
...put out the light.

1326
01:38:03,586 --> 01:38:05,053
Who's there?

1327
01:38:21,237 --> 01:38:25,799
O, balmy breath, that doth almost
persuade justice to break her sword!

1328
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:47,388
Be thus when thou art dead, and
I will kill thee and love thee after.

1329
01:38:52,234 --> 01:38:54,134
One more...

1330
01:38:55,905 --> 01:38:58,032
...and this the last.

1331
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:02,869
So sweet was never so fatal.

1332
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:27,127
Othello?

1333
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:29,294
Ay...

1334
01:39:30,606 --> 01:39:31,903
...Desdemona.

1335
01:39:34,844 --> 01:39:36,937
Will you come to bed, my lord?

1336
01:39:39,415 --> 01:39:43,078
Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona?

1337
01:39:43,586 --> 01:39:44,610
Ay, my lord.

1338
01:39:45,321 --> 01:39:47,152
If you bethink yourself of any crime...

1339
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:50,018
...unreconciled to heaven,
solicit for it straight.

1340
01:39:50,226 --> 01:39:52,956
Alack, my lord, what
may you mean by that?

1341
01:39:53,162 --> 01:39:57,496
Well, do it and be brief.
I will walk by.

1342
01:39:59,802 --> 01:40:01,929
I'll not kill thy unprepared spirit.

1343
01:40:02,138 --> 01:40:04,265
Heaven forfend! I'll not kill thy soul.

1344
01:40:04,473 --> 01:40:06,998
- Talk you of killing?
- Ay, I do.

1345
01:40:07,943 --> 01:40:10,138
Then heaven...

1346
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,814
...have mercy on me.

1347
01:40:13,249 --> 01:40:14,511
Amen...

1348
01:40:15,017 --> 01:40:16,177
...with all my heart!

1349
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:19,047
If you say so, I hope
you will not kill me.

1350
01:40:19,955 --> 01:40:22,014
And yet I fear you.

1351
01:40:22,558 --> 01:40:24,048
Think on thy sins.

1352
01:40:26,061 --> 01:40:27,585
They are loves I bear to you.

1353
01:40:27,797 --> 01:40:29,094
And for that thou diest.

1354
01:40:29,298 --> 01:40:32,290
That death's unnatural
that kills for loving.

1355
01:40:32,501 --> 01:40:34,731
Peace and be still!

1356
01:40:36,071 --> 01:40:37,368
I will so.

1357
01:40:47,616 --> 01:40:49,049
What's the matter?

1358
01:40:50,553 --> 01:40:53,989
That handkerchief which I gave thee,
thou gave to Cassio.

1359
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:58,126
No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man and ask him.

1360
01:40:58,327 --> 01:41:03,230
Sweet soul, take heed of perjury.
Thou art on thy deathbed.

1361
01:41:03,432 --> 01:41:04,456
But not yet to die.

1362
01:41:04,667 --> 01:41:05,861
Yes, presently!

1363
01:41:07,837 --> 01:41:09,964
Then Lord have mercy on me!

1364
01:41:10,172 --> 01:41:11,104
I say...

1365
01:41:12,141 --> 01:41:13,199
...amen.

1366
01:41:13,409 --> 01:41:15,639
And have you mercy too!

1367
01:41:16,078 --> 01:41:19,241
I never did offend you in my life.
Never loved Cassio...

1368
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:23,384
...but with such general warranty
of heaven as I might love.

1369
01:41:23,586 --> 01:41:24,610
I never gave him token.

1370
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:28,551
By heaven, I saw my
handkerchief in his hand!

1371
01:41:28,757 --> 01:41:29,781
He found it then.

1372
01:41:29,992 --> 01:41:31,789
I never gave it him.

1373
01:41:32,328 --> 01:41:33,226
Send for him hither.

1374
01:41:33,696 --> 01:41:34,924
Let him confess a truth.

1375
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:37,394
He hath confessed.

1376
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,464
What, my lord?

1377
01:41:38,667 --> 01:41:40,464
That he hath used thee.

1378
01:41:40,769 --> 01:41:42,327
How?

1379
01:41:43,772 --> 01:41:47,868
- Unlawfully?
- Ay.

1380
01:41:48,911 --> 01:41:50,811
- He will not say so.
- No...

1381
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:54,377
...his mouth is stopped.

1382
01:41:55,351 --> 01:41:57,512
Honest Iago hath taken order for it.

1383
01:41:58,854 --> 01:42:00,446
What?

1384
01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:02,757
Is he dead?

1385
01:42:04,793 --> 01:42:06,283
Emilia...

1386
01:42:07,129 --> 01:42:10,155
...run and tell my lord and lady
what hath happened.

1387
01:42:17,673 --> 01:42:20,267
Alas, he is betrayed...

1388
01:42:21,076 --> 01:42:23,704
...and I undone.

1389
01:42:23,979 --> 01:42:27,176
Out, strumpet!

1390
01:42:27,383 --> 01:42:30,716
Weepest thou for him to my face?

1391
01:42:33,389 --> 01:42:37,257
O banish me, my lord,
but kill me not!

1392
01:42:40,796 --> 01:42:42,593
Down, strumpet!

1393
01:42:42,798 --> 01:42:44,595
IKill me tomorrow.

1394
01:42:51,173 --> 01:42:53,073
Let me live tonight.

1395
01:42:57,846 --> 01:42:58,835
Nay!

1396
01:43:03,619 --> 01:43:05,610
If you strive...

1397
01:43:16,732 --> 01:43:18,359
But half an hour!

1398
01:43:20,536 --> 01:43:23,699
- Being done, there is no pause.
- But while I say one prayer!

1399
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:25,032
It's too late.

1400
01:44:23,699 --> 01:44:26,099
What? Not dead?

1401
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:29,365
Not yet quite dead?

1402
01:44:29,571 --> 01:44:32,404
Good my lord, I would
speak a word with you.

1403
01:44:34,309 --> 01:44:35,901
Who's there?

1404
01:44:36,111 --> 01:44:39,808
I do beseech you that I may speak
with you, O, good my lord.

1405
01:44:44,119 --> 01:44:45,984
Yes, Emilia.

1406
01:44:46,188 --> 01:44:47,815
By and by.

1407
01:44:50,059 --> 01:44:54,428
- What is the matter with thee?
- My good lord, yonder's foul murder done.

1408
01:44:54,630 --> 01:44:56,461
- What, now?
- But now, my lord.

1409
01:44:56,665 --> 01:44:58,860
It is the very error of the moon.

1410
01:44:59,068 --> 01:45:01,866
She comes nearer earth than she
was wont and makes men mad.

1411
01:45:02,237 --> 01:45:04,603
Cassio hath killed
a Venetian called Roderigo.

1412
01:45:05,274 --> 01:45:07,071
Roderigo and Cassio killed?

1413
01:45:07,276 --> 01:45:11,144
- No, Cassio's not killed.
- Not Cassio killed!

1414
01:45:11,346 --> 01:45:15,077
Then murder's out of tune,
and sweet revenge grows harsh.

1415
01:45:16,418 --> 01:45:17,715
What cry is that?

1416
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:18,750
That? What?

1417
01:45:18,954 --> 01:45:21,650
Out, and alas,
that was my lady's voice!

1418
01:45:28,597 --> 01:45:30,224
O lady, speak again!

1419
01:45:30,432 --> 01:45:33,526
Sweet Desdemona!
O sweet mistress, speak!

1420
01:45:47,783 --> 01:45:49,876
O, who has done this deed?

1421
01:45:51,186 --> 01:45:52,517
'Twas I that killed her.

1422
01:45:55,224 --> 01:45:57,351
She turned to folly
and she was a whore.

1423
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,126
Thou dost belie her
and thou art a devil.

1424
01:46:00,329 --> 01:46:02,593
She was false as water.

1425
01:46:02,798 --> 01:46:06,859
Thou art rash as fire to say that she
was false. She was heavenly true!

1426
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:10,334
Cassio did top her!
Ask thy husband else.

1427
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:13,674
I were damned beneath hell,
but that I did proceed...

1428
01:46:13,876 --> 01:46:16,401
...justly to this extremity.
Thy husband knew.

1429
01:46:16,745 --> 01:46:18,940
- My husband?
- Thy husband.

1430
01:46:19,181 --> 01:46:20,341
That she was false?

1431
01:46:20,549 --> 01:46:22,517
With Cassio.
Nay, had she been true...

1432
01:46:22,718 --> 01:46:25,016
- My husband?
- Ay, 'twas he that told me.

1433
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:27,120
An honest man who hates the slime...

1434
01:46:27,356 --> 01:46:30,086
...that sticks on filthy deeds.
- My husband?

1435
01:46:30,292 --> 01:46:33,159
What needs this iterance, woman?
I say thy husband!

1436
01:46:33,362 --> 01:46:37,731
If he say so, may his pernicious
soul rot half a grain a day!

1437
01:46:37,933 --> 01:46:40,094
He lies to the heart.

1438
01:46:40,602 --> 01:46:42,832
She was too fond
of her filthy bargain.

1439
01:46:43,038 --> 01:46:43,936
Do thy worst.

1440
01:46:44,139 --> 01:46:47,836
This deed of thine is no more worthy
heaven than thou wast worthy her.

1441
01:46:48,043 --> 01:46:50,136
Help! Murder!

1442
01:46:50,913 --> 01:46:51,743
Peace...

1443
01:46:52,314 --> 01:46:53,542
...you were best.

1444
01:46:53,749 --> 01:46:56,877
Thou hast not half the power to
harm me as I have to be hurt.

1445
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:58,484
O gull!

1446
01:46:58,687 --> 01:47:03,624
O dolt! As ignorant as dirt!
Thou hast done a deed.

1447
01:47:04,193 --> 01:47:05,922
I care not for thy sword.

1448
01:47:06,128 --> 01:47:09,564
I'll make thee known
though I lost twenty lives.

1449
01:47:09,765 --> 01:47:11,528
Help! Help!

1450
01:47:11,733 --> 01:47:14,327
The Moor hath killed my mistress!

1451
01:47:14,536 --> 01:47:16,834
Murder! Murder!

1452
01:47:17,539 --> 01:47:18,528
Murder!

1453
01:47:19,308 --> 01:47:20,673
How now, general?

1454
01:47:20,876 --> 01:47:22,571
Who cries of murder?

1455
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:26,003
O, are you come, Iago?

1456
01:47:26,215 --> 01:47:29,082
You've done well, that men lay
their murders on your neck.

1457
01:47:29,284 --> 01:47:31,411
Disprove this villain,
if thou be a man.

1458
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:34,180
He says thou toldest him
that his wife is false.

1459
01:47:34,389 --> 01:47:38,120
Thou art not such a villain.
Speak, for my heart is full.

1460
01:47:38,327 --> 01:47:39,885
I told him what I thought...

1461
01:47:40,095 --> 01:47:43,553
...and told no more than what he
found himself was apt and true.

1462
01:47:43,765 --> 01:47:46,734
- But did you tell him she was false?
- I did.

1463
01:47:46,935 --> 01:47:48,664
You told a lie...

1464
01:47:49,004 --> 01:47:52,531
...an odious, damned lie.
Upon my a soul, a lie, a wicked lie!

1465
01:47:52,741 --> 01:47:54,675
She false with Cassio?
Did you say...?

1466
01:47:54,877 --> 01:47:56,777
With Cassio.
Go to, charm your tongue.

1467
01:47:57,145 --> 01:48:00,137
I will not charm my tongue.
I am bound to speak.

1468
01:48:00,382 --> 01:48:03,146
My mistress here lies
murdered in her bed.

1469
01:48:06,688 --> 01:48:08,485
Your reports have set the murder on.

1470
01:48:08,891 --> 01:48:11,519
Nay, stare not, masters.

1471
01:48:12,127 --> 01:48:15,187
It is true indeed.

1472
01:48:15,998 --> 01:48:17,022
Villainy...

1473
01:48:17,232 --> 01:48:19,530
...villainy, villainy!

1474
01:48:19,735 --> 01:48:20,861
I think upon it...

1475
01:48:21,737 --> 01:48:24,865
...I think, I smell it, O villainy!

1476
01:48:25,207 --> 01:48:28,768
What? Are you mad?
I charge you, get you home.

1477
01:48:28,977 --> 01:48:31,070
Good gentlemen, let me
have leave to speak.

1478
01:48:31,947 --> 01:48:34,381
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.

1479
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:36,884
Perchance I will never go home.

1480
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:40,218
Nay...

1481
01:48:41,089 --> 01:48:44,320
...lay thee down and roar!

1482
01:48:44,526 --> 01:48:47,757
Thou has killed the sweetest
innocent that ever did lift up eye.

1483
01:48:47,963 --> 01:48:51,091
O, she was foul!
Iago knows that she with Cassio...

1484
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:53,894
...hath the act of shame
a thousand times committed.

1485
01:48:54,102 --> 01:48:57,663
Cassio confessed, and she gratified his
amorous works with that handkerchief.

1486
01:48:57,873 --> 01:49:00,000
I saw it in his hand.

1487
01:49:03,011 --> 01:49:04,535
O God!

1488
01:49:06,882 --> 01:49:08,679
O heavenly God!

1489
01:49:10,986 --> 01:49:12,954
Be wise...

1490
01:49:13,855 --> 01:49:15,880
...and get you home.

1491
01:49:17,159 --> 01:49:19,286
I will not.

1492
01:49:21,530 --> 01:49:22,792
O thou dull Moor!

1493
01:49:24,299 --> 01:49:28,599
That handkerchief thou
speakest of I found by fortune...

1494
01:49:29,571 --> 01:49:30,868
...and did give my husband.

1495
01:49:31,073 --> 01:49:32,597
Filth...

1496
01:49:32,808 --> 01:49:33,638
...thou liest!

1497
01:49:33,842 --> 01:49:36,811
By heaven, I do not.
I do not, gentlemen. I found it!

1498
01:49:37,646 --> 01:49:41,241
Are there no stones in heaven
but what serves for thunder?

1499
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:43,979
Precious villain!

1500
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:00,495
Stop, villain!

1501
01:50:03,405 --> 01:50:05,498
Lay me by my mistress' side.

1502
01:50:44,446 --> 01:50:47,142
What did thy song bode, lady?

1503
01:50:47,983 --> 01:50:50,247
Hark, canst thou hear me?

1504
01:50:51,186 --> 01:50:54,451
I will play the swan and die in music.

1505
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:57,555
Willow...

1506
01:50:57,759 --> 01:51:00,057
...willow, willow

1507
01:51:01,096 --> 01:51:04,259
Moor, she was chaste.

1508
01:51:04,466 --> 01:51:07,401
She loved thee, cruel Moor.

1509
01:51:09,704 --> 01:51:12,468
So come my soul to bliss...

1510
01:51:13,108 --> 01:51:14,803
...as I speak true.

1511
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:18,673
So speaking as I think, I die...

1512
01:51:20,115 --> 01:51:22,049
...I die.

1513
01:51:25,587 --> 01:51:28,420
Where is this rash
and most unfortunate man?

1514
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,960
That's he that was Othello.

1515
01:51:37,466 --> 01:51:38,865
Here I am.

1516
01:51:39,935 --> 01:51:41,266
Where is that viper?

1517
01:51:41,837 --> 01:51:44,032
Bring the villain forth.

1518
01:51:53,381 --> 01:51:56,248
I look down towards his feet...

1519
01:51:57,452 --> 01:51:59,579
...but that's a fable.

1520
01:52:00,088 --> 01:52:02,249
If that thou be a devil...

1521
01:52:02,757 --> 01:52:04,588
...I cannot kill thee.

1522
01:52:20,842 --> 01:52:25,211
I bleed, sir...

1523
01:52:25,413 --> 01:52:26,937
...but not killed.

1524
01:52:27,516 --> 01:52:30,110
I am not sorry neither.

1525
01:52:30,652 --> 01:52:32,882
I'd have thee live.

1526
01:52:33,088 --> 01:52:35,852
For in my sense...

1527
01:52:36,057 --> 01:52:39,151
...'tis happiness to die.

1528
01:52:39,361 --> 01:52:40,919
This wretch...

1529
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:44,155
...hath part confessed his villainy.

1530
01:52:46,201 --> 01:52:49,170
Did you and he consent...

1531
01:52:49,371 --> 01:52:51,566
...in Cassio's death?

1532
01:52:52,574 --> 01:52:54,064
Ay.

1533
01:52:55,877 --> 01:52:58,175
Dear general, I never gave you cause.

1534
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:01,747
I do believe it and ask your pardon.

1535
01:53:03,185 --> 01:53:05,244
Will you, I pray...

1536
01:53:05,453 --> 01:53:07,683
...demand this demi-devil...

1537
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:12,124
...why he hath thus ensnared
my soul and body?

1538
01:53:13,128 --> 01:53:15,926
Demand me nothing.

1539
01:53:17,465 --> 01:53:19,330
What you know, you know.

1540
01:53:20,869 --> 01:53:22,769
From this time forth...

1541
01:53:23,104 --> 01:53:26,130
...I never will speak word.

1542
01:53:28,009 --> 01:53:29,533
Well...

1543
01:53:30,779 --> 01:53:32,940
...thou dost best.

1544
01:53:35,283 --> 01:53:37,183
Forsake this room and go with us.

1545
01:53:37,385 --> 01:53:39,319
Your power and command is taken off...

1546
01:53:39,955 --> 01:53:42,651
...and Cassio rules in Cyprus.

1547
01:53:52,534 --> 01:53:54,229
Come, bring him away.

1548
01:53:54,536 --> 01:53:55,935
A word before you go.

1549
01:53:56,338 --> 01:53:59,364
I have done the state
some service, and they know it.

1550
01:54:13,021 --> 01:54:15,046
No more of that.

1551
01:54:20,128 --> 01:54:21,720
I pray you...

1552
01:54:22,330 --> 01:54:25,356
...in your letters, when you
these unlucky deeds relate...

1553
01:54:25,900 --> 01:54:27,731
...speak of me as I am.

1554
01:54:28,169 --> 01:54:30,330
Nothing extenuate...

1555
01:54:30,538 --> 01:54:33,029
...nor set down aught in malice.

1556
01:54:33,708 --> 01:54:36,836
Then must you speak of one...

1557
01:54:37,045 --> 01:54:40,037
...that loved not wisely,
but too well.

1558
01:54:40,248 --> 01:54:44,617
Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought...

1559
01:54:44,819 --> 01:54:47,720
...perplexed in the extreme.

1560
01:54:48,490 --> 01:54:51,857
Of one whose hand,
like the base Indian...

1561
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:55,621
...threw a pearl away
richer than all his tribe.

1562
01:54:56,631 --> 01:54:59,225
Of one whose subdued eyes...

1563
01:54:59,434 --> 01:55:03,097
...albeit unused to the melting mood...

1564
01:55:03,305 --> 01:55:07,537
...drop tears as fast as
the Arabian trees...

1565
01:55:07,742 --> 01:55:09,437
...their medicinal gum.

1566
01:55:12,747 --> 01:55:14,544
Set you down this.

1567
01:55:15,617 --> 01:55:17,881
And say, besides...

1568
01:55:19,321 --> 01:55:21,312
...that in Aleppo once...

1569
01:55:22,490 --> 01:55:26,153
...where a malignant
and a turbanned Turk...

1570
01:55:26,361 --> 01:55:28,261
...beat a Venetian...

1571
01:55:28,663 --> 01:55:30,961
...and traduced the state...

1572
01:55:31,933 --> 01:55:35,334
...I took by the throat...

1573
01:55:35,537 --> 01:55:37,903
...the circumcised dog...

1574
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:40,073
...and smote him...

1575
01:55:42,043 --> 01:55:43,271
...thus.

1576
01:56:24,986 --> 01:56:27,147
I kissed thee...

1577
01:56:27,355 --> 01:56:29,880
...ere I killed thee.

1578
01:56:31,159 --> 01:56:33,627
No way but this...

1579
01:56:35,096 --> 01:56:37,462
...killing myself...

1580
01:56:38,233 --> 01:56:41,725
...to die upon a kiss.

1581
01:56:48,810 --> 01:56:52,439
This I did fear, but thought
he had no weapon.

1582
01:56:53,047 --> 01:56:55,038
For he was great of heart.

1583
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:57,343
O Spartan dog!

1584
01:57:00,388 --> 01:57:03,221
Look on the tragic
loading of this bed.

1585
01:57:04,092 --> 01:57:05,923
This is thy work.

1586
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:17,638
To you, lord governor...

1587
01:57:17,839 --> 01:57:21,434
...remains the censure
of this hellish villain.

1588
01:57:22,243 --> 01:57:23,710
The time...

1589
01:57:24,712 --> 01:57:26,179
...the place...

1590
01:57:27,649 --> 01:57:29,879
...the torture.
O, enforce it!

1591
01:57:33,421 --> 01:57:35,685
Myself will straight aboard...

1592
01:57:36,691 --> 01:57:39,091
...and to the state...

1593
01:57:39,294 --> 01:57:40,989
...this heavy act...

1594
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:44,197
...with heavy heart relate.
