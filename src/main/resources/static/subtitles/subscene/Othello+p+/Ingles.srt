1
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:06,134
There was once in venice
a moor othello who for

2
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,241
his merits in the affairs of war
was held in great esteem.

3
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,640
It happened that he fell in love
with a young and noble lady

4
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,108
called desdemona,

5
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,709
who drawn by his virtue,
became equally enamoured of him.

6
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:23,323
So it was that since her father
was much opposed to the union

7
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,555
of desdemona with a moor,
she fled her house at night.

8
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,621
In secret haste
they were married.

9
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,063
Now there was in othello's
company, an ensign named lago,

10
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,827
a very amiable outward appearance

11
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,504
but his character was
extremely treacherous.

12
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:48,245
I have told often and
i retell it again and again.

13
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,415
I hate the moore.

14
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,211
I'll poison his delight.

15
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:59,149
How? How, lago?

16
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,659
Proclaim him in the streets,
incense her kinsmen,

17
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:07,061
and though he in fertile climate
dwell, plague him with flies.

18
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,994
No, they come.

19
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,735
What will i do?

20
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,804
Why, go to bed and sleep.

21
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,009
- I'll incontinently drown myself.
Oh, bitterness.

22
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,606
What should i do?

23
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:20,974
Put money in thy purse.

24
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:24,083
Ere i would say i would drown
myself for love of a guinea

25
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,608
hen, i would change my
humanity with a baboon!

26
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,883
Come, be a man.

27
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,724
Drown thyself?

28
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,128
Drown cats and blind puppies.

29
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:45,232
It cannot be that desdemona
should long continue her love

30
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,396
to the moor or he his to her.

31
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,742
It was a violent commencement.

32
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,608
And thou shalt see an answerable
sequestration,

33
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,813
put buy money in thy purse.

34
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,118
When she is sated with his body

35
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,246
she'll fine the error
of her choice.

36
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:08,154
She must change, she must,
for youth.

37
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,555
Your daughter!

38
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,362
- Look, your house!
- Your house!

39
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,232
- Your daughter!
- Your daughter!

40
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,396
Senior, is all your family
within?

41
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,574
Why, wherefore ask you this?

42
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,140
Lf't be your pleasure for your
dull watch o' th' night,

43
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,144
transported, with no worse nor
better guard but with a knave

44
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,376
of common hire, a gondolier,
to the gross clasps of a

45
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,779
lascivious moor.

46
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,647
This thou shalt answer!

47
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,686
Straight satisfy yourself, if she
be in your chamber or your house,

48
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,790
lago, can i depend on the issue?

49
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,053
Thou are sure of me.
Go, make money.

50
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,921
It is too true an evil.
Gone she is.

51
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,862
Is there not charms by which
the property of youth

52
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,800
and maidhood may be abused?

53
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,267
Call up all my people!

54
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,907
Raise my kindred!

55
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,644
Where is the moor?

56
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,149
Keep up your bright swords
for the dew'll rust them.

57
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,116
Oh, thou foul thief!

58
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,755
Where hast thou stowed
my daughter?

59
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,824
Hold your hands! Good signor,

60
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:14,392
where will you that i go to
answer this your charge?

61
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,425
To prison till fit time of law

62
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,020
and course of direct session
call thee to answer.

63
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,801
Now at the same hour, there
came messengers in haste

64
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,637
to the senate for there was
news that the turkish armies

65
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,935
were moving against the
venetian garrison in cyprus.

66
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,673
The senators, already raised

67
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:37,112
the net, elected the moor to the
commander of their troops.

68
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,979
And officers were searching

69
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:40,814
the town to apprise othello
of this honor

70
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,184
when lo, desdemona's old
father himself brings the moor

71
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,485
at sword's point to the council
chamber upon a charge of

72
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:50,289
working from desdemona with
unlawful enchant.

73
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,428
She was abused,

74
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,533
stolen from me and, ay,
corrupted by magic spells.

75
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,861
I'm very sorry for't.

76
00:08:56,502 --> 00:09:00,495
If she in chains of magic were not
bound, whether a maid so tender,

77
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,343
fair and happy would ever have
to incur her general mock,

78
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,810
run from her father

79
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,375
to the sooty bosom of such a
fierce bat!

80
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,487
Damned as thou art,
thou hast enchanted her!

81
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,055
Othello, what in your own part
can you say to this?

82
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,454
Nothing but this is so!

83
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,622
Did you by indirect and forced

84
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,756
courses subdue and poison
this young maid of affection?

85
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,835
Most potent grave and
reverend signors,

86
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,003
my very noble and approved
good masters,

87
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,171
that i've taken away this old
man's daughter it's most true.

88
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,413
True i have married her.

89
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:52,620
The very head and front of my
offending has this extent,

90
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,520
no more.

91
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,260
Rude in my speech,

92
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,257
and little blessed with the soft
phrase of peace,

93
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,262
since these arms of mine had
seven years' pith till now some

94
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,566
nine moon wasted they
have used their dearest action

95
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:10,042
in the tented field and little
little of this great world can i

96
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,374
speak more than pertains
to feats of broil and battle.

97
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,509
And therefore little shall i grace
my cause in speaking of myself.

98
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,745
Yet by your gracious patience

99
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:24,289
i will round unvarnished tale
deliver of my whole course of love,

100
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,414
what drugs, what charms,

101
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,794
what conjuration and what

102
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,728
mighty magic, for such
proceedings am i charged withal

103
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,655
that i won his daughter.

104
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,163
Her father loved me, oft

105
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,233
invited me, still questioned me
the story of my life.

106
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,495
I ran it through even from my

107
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,597
boyish days wherein i speak of
the most disastrous chances

108
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,742
of moving accidents by flood
and fields of hair-breadth

109
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,074
scapes for the imminent
deadly breach.

110
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:52,073
Of being taken by insolent foe,
and sold to slavery,

111
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:57,115
of my redemption thence and
potency my travels history

112
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:01,554
wherein a venturous vast and
desert idle, rough quarries,

113
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:06,124
rocks and tills whose heads
touch heaven.

114
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,291
It was my head to speak.

115
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,261
Rest to hear, but desdemona
seriously inclined.

116
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,575
But still the house affairs would
draw her thence, which ever as

117
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,940
she could with haste dispatch,

118
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:23,775
come again and with a greedy
ear devour up my discourse.

119
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,609
I found good means to draw

120
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:32,382
from her a prayer of earnest
heart that i would all my

121
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,957
pilgrimage dilate, and often
did beguile her of her tears

122
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,086
when i did speak of some
distressed stroke of my use of it.

123
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:44,768
She gave me for my pains,
a world of sighs.

124
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:49,270
She swore, in faith: 'twas
strange, 'twas passing strange.

125
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,743
Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous
pitiful.

126
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,045
She wished she had not heard

127
00:11:56,148 --> 00:12:00,016
it, yet she wished that
heaven made her such a man.

128
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:06,054
She thanked me, and bade me
if i had a friend that loved her

129
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,321
i should but teach him how to
tell my story

130
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,593
and that would woo her.

131
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,595
Upon this hint i spake,

132
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,259
she loved my for the dangers
i had passed,

133
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,201
and i loved her that she
did pity them.

134
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,699
This only is the witchcraft
i have used.

135
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,773
I think this tale would win
my daughter, too.

136
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,275
Come hither, desdemona.

137
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,822
Do you perceive in all this
noble company

138
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,655
where most owe you obedience?

139
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,463
My noble father, i do perceive
here a divided duty.

140
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,392
To you i am bound for life
and education.

141
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,370
My life and education both do
learn me how to respect you.

142
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,407
You are the lord of duty.

143
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:05,013
I am hitherto your daughter.
But here's my husband.

144
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,578
And so much duty as my
mother showed to you

145
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,483
preferring you before her father

146
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,024
so much i challenge that i
may profess,

147
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:20,454
due to the moor, my lord.
God be with you. I have done.

148
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:22,534
When remedies are past
the griefs are ended.

149
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,468
Please it your grace on to
the state affairs.

150
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,867
The turk with a most mighty
preparation makes for cyprus.

151
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,339
Othello, the fortitude of the
place is vast known to you.

152
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,072
You must away this morning.

153
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,642
With all my heart.

154
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,976
When we consider the importance
of cyprus to the turk, we must

155
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,779
not think the turk is so
unskillful to leave that latest

156
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,285
which concerns them first,

157
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:46,084
neglecting an attempt of ease and
gain to wake and wage a danger.

158
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,799
Look to her, moor
if thou hast eyes to see.

159
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,758
She has deceived her father
and may thee.

160
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:00,037
My life upon her faith!

161
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,954
Mark me with what violence
she first loved the moor

162
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,549
but for bragging and dealing
a fantastical lie.

163
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,489
Will she love him still for prating?

164
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,460
Ah, let not thy discreet heart
think it.

165
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,666
- Lieutenant cassio.
- Largo

166
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:35,973
what a cannon.

167
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,005
I know my price.

168
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:37,665
I'm worth no worse a place.

169
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,209
But he, sir, had the election.

170
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,212
And what's he? This michael
cassio, this florentine,

171
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,681
that never set a squadron in the
field nor the division of a battle

172
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:49,754
knows more than a spinster.
Yet cassio must his lieutenant

173
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,120
be, by god bless the mark of
the fellow's ancient!

174
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,723
Well, i would not follow him that.

175
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:56,917
Oh, sir, content you.

176
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,721
I follow him to serve my turn
upon him.

177
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,526
Lago? Lago!

178
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,598
Honest lago!

179
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,399
I wake up on your lordship.

180
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,662
My desdemona must i leave
with thee.

181
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,500
I pray bring her after good time
to cyprus.

182
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,869
Well, me good lord, i'll do it.

183
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,409
The moor's of a free and
open nature, that thinks men

184
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,744
honest that seem to be so,
and will as tenderly be led by

185
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,408
th' nose as asses are.

186
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,923
We cannot all be masters.

187
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,190
Nor all masters cannot by
truly followed.

188
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,698
You shall mark many a duteous
and knee-crooking knave who

189
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,735
doting on his own obsequious
bondage wears out his time,

190
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,499
much like his master's ass, for
naught but provender; and when,

191
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,972
he's old, cashiered.

192
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,533
Whip me such honest knaves!

193
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:46,943
Others there are who, trimmed

194
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,113
in forms and visages of duty,
keep yet their hearts attending

195
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,180
on themselves,
and throwing but shows of

196
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,239
services on their lords,
do well thrive by them, and when

197
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,577
they have lined their coats
do themselves homage.

198
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,753
These fellows have some soul,

199
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,988
and such a one do i profess
myself for, sir, it is as sure

200
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:05,994
as you're roderigo, were
i the moor, i would not be lago.

201
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,991
In following him i follow
but myself.

202
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,362
When my outward action doth
demonstrate the native act and

203
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,441
figure of my heart in compliment

204
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:20,241
extern, 'tis not long after but
i will wear my heart upon my

205
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:28,150
sleeve, for daws to peck at.
I am not what i am.

206
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,533
I have but an hour of love
to spend with thee.

207
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,934
We must obey the time.

208
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,251
Oh, lago, what tidings can
you tell of my lord?

209
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,486
He's not yet arrived, but the

210
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:46,060
turkish fleets be not enshelterd
they are drowned.

211
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,436
It is there! I know
othello's trumpet!

212
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:04,448
News, lads! News! The desperate
tempest hath so banged the turks

213
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:05,909
that their designment halts.

214
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,618
Our wars are done!

215
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:23,994
He takes her by the palm.
Well said. An excellent courtship.

216
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:33,735
With as little a web as this will i
ensnare as great a fly as cassio.

217
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:05,474
It gives me wonder great as my
content to see you here before me.

218
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,508
Oh, my soul's joy!

219
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,039
If after every tempest come such

220
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,845
calms, may the winds blow
till they have wakened death.

221
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,555
- My dear othello!
- Oh, my fair warrior!

222
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,757
I prattle out of fashion, and
i dote in my own comforts.

223
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,152
- Worthy montano, your pardon
- sir

224
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,331
good michael, look you
to the guard tonight.

225
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,657
Come, my dear love.

226
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,038
Once more well met at cyprus.

227
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,360
It is othello's pleasure that
upon certain tidings now arrived

228
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,426
importing the destruction of
the turkish fleet, every man

229
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,294
put himself into triumph.

230
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,495
Each man what sport and revels
his addiction lead him.

231
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,904
For, besides these beneficial news,

232
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,637
it is the celebration of
our general's nuptial.

233
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:20,344
Heaven bless the isle of cyprus
and our noble general othello!

234
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,857
First, i must tell thee this.

235
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,960
Desdemona is directly
in love with him.

236
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,193
With cassio?
Why, 'tis not possible.

237
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,393
Her eyes must be fed.

238
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,463
And what delight shall she
have to look on the devil?

239
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,038
Very nature will compel her
to the second choice.

240
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,134
Now sir, this granted,

241
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:51,481
who stands so eminent in the degree
of this fortune as cassio does?

242
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:53,575
Why, none! Why, none!

243
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:58,451
A slipper and subtle knave,
a devilish knave!

244
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,588
- He is handsome.
- Cassio?

245
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,257
He has all the requisites in him

246
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:08,093
that folly and green minds
look after.

247
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,635
Oh, a pestilent complete knave

248
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,605
and the woman hath found
him already.

249
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:22,405
I cannot believe that in
desdemona.

250
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,456
Did you not see her paddle
with the palm of his hand?

251
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,115
Did not mark that?

252
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,693
Yes, that i did, but that was
but a courtesy.

253
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,693
Courtesy? Lechery. An index

254
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:43,726
and obscure prologue to the
history of lust and foul thoughts.

255
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,569
They met so near with their lips
that their breaths embraced together.

256
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,238
Villainous thoughts, roderigo.

257
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,973
But, sir, be you ruled by me.

258
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,940
Listen, listen to cassio tonight.
Watch him on the court of god.

259
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,917
Cassio knows you not.
I'll not be far from you.

260
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,918
Do you find some occasion
to anger him from what

261
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,119
other course you please.

262
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:05,113
Well

263
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,884
sir, he's rash and very sudden

264
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,890
in choler, and haply may
strike at you.

265
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,016
Provoke him that he may,

266
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:14,198
for even out of that will i
cause these of cyprus to mutiny

267
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,994
and the displanting of cassio.
Lieutenant cassio!

268
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:22,634
Lago, i'll say, you like me
well, lago?

269
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,435
In the sincerity of
love and friendship.

270
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,802
Come, lieutenant, a stoup of
wine!

271
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,340
Here a brace of gallants that

272
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:32,549
fain have a measure to the
health of black othello.

273
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:33,982
Not tonight, good lago.

274
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,577
I have very poor and unhappy
brains for drinking.

275
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,085
Oh, just one cup.

276
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,094
I must to the watch.

277
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,531
Not this hour, lieutenant,
'tis not yet ten o' th' clock.

278
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,162
Our general cast us thus early
for the love of his desdemona.

279
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,972
He hath not yet made wanton
the night with her

280
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,803
and she is sport for jove.

281
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,734
She's a most exquisite lady.

282
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,042
And full of game, i'll warrant.

283
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,477
What an eye she has
to provocation.

284
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:07,551
I object, i think right modest.

285
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:17,324
Well, happiness to their sheets.
Another cup, i'll drink for you.

286
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,624
I have drunk two cups and
i don't dare not to task

287
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,062
my weakness with any more.

288
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,790
My man, 'tis a night of revels.

289
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,264
I'll do't, but it dislikes me.

290
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,522
If it were now to die, 'twere
now to be most happy,

291
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,884
for i fear my soul hath her content

292
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:51,058
so absolute that not another
comfort like to this

293
00:23:51,263 --> 00:24:13,347
succeeds in unknown fate.
Ah, brothers on call tonight!

294
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,178
God, an excellent song!

295
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:17,981
I learned it in england, where

296
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,590
indeed they are most potent
in potting.

297
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:23,285
Your dane, your german,

298
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,022
and your swag-bellied hollander
- drink, ho! -

299
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,426
are nothing to your english.

300
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,660
Is your englishman so exquisite
in his drinking?

301
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,828
He drinks you with facility
you dane dead drunk,

302
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,100
he sweats not to overthrow
your almain,

303
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,471
he gives your hollander a vomit
ere the next pottle can be filled.

304
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,102
To the health of our general!

305
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,611
I am for it, lieutenant, and
i'll do you justice.

306
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:35,262
Good faith, a little one,
not past a pint, as i'm a soldier.

307
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,565
Well, god above all
and there be souls must be saved,

308
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,672
and there be souls must not
be saved.

309
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,072
It's true, good lieutenant.

310
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:22,408
For mine own part, no offense

311
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:28,413
to the general, nor any man
of quality, i hope to be saved.

312
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,856
Ay, but, by your leave,
not before me.

313
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,163
Do not think, gentlemen,
i am drunk.

314
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:46,631
This is my ancient, my right
hand, this is my left.

315
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,797
I am not drunk now. I can
stand well enough, and

316
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,440
i speak well enough.

317
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,341
Excellent well!

318
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,075
Very well. You must not think
then that i am drunk.

319
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:09,618
Zounds, you rogue, you rascal!

320
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:14,326
What noise is this?

321
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:18,127
A knave teach me my duty?

322
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,869
What's the matter, lieutenant?

323
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,338
I'll beat the knave into
a twiggen bottle.

324
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,288
Away, i say.

325
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,255
Go out and cry a mutiny!

326
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:51,796
Mutiny! Mutiny! Mutiny!
Mutiny! Mutiny! Mutiny!

327
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:03,679
Stop, lieutenant!

328
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,747
Hold this shame forever!

329
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,943
Have you forgot all place of
sense and duty?

330
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,144
Hold the rage!

331
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,474
Hold, gentlemen!

332
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:45,685
You're ordered above.
Yeah, move, come on!

333
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,891
Why, sir, the generals!

334
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,511
Silence that dreadful bell!

335
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,892
Who began this? Lago.

336
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,789
I do not know.

337
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:30,659
Friends all, but now, even now,
in quarter and terms like

338
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,704
bride and groom devesting
them for bed,

339
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:37,864
but now swords out and tilting
one at other's breasts.

340
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,834
Worthy montano, what's the matter

341
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,648
that you unlace your
reputation thus and spend your

342
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,208
rich opinion for the name
of a night-brawler?

343
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:51,285
Your officer, lago, can
inform you.

344
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:52,816
Fortunate. Town of war to manage
private and domestic quarrel?

345
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,124
In night, and on the court
and guard of safety?

346
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,159
Lago, who began't?

347
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,865
Thou dost deliver more or less
than truth, thou art no soldier.

348
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,935
I had rather have this tongue
cut from my mouth than it should

349
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,402
do offense to michael cassio.

350
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,199
Sir, men in rage strike those
that wish them best,

351
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,176
yet surely cassio i believe
received from him that fled

352
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,608
some strange dignity, which
patience could not pass.

353
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,613
I know, lago, the honesty
and love doth mince this matter,

354
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,984
making it light to cassio.

355
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:32,553
Cassio, i love thee,
but never more be officer of mine.

356
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,158
Look if my gentle love be not
raised up.

357
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,365
I'll make thee an example.

358
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:24,779
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
Ay, past all surgery.

359
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,908
Marry, heaven forbid!

360
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:30,383
Reputation, reputation,
reputation!

361
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,986
O, i have lost my reputation!

362
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,619
I have lost the immortal part
of myself,

363
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,818
and what remains is bestial.

364
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,192
My reputation, lago,
my reputation.

365
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,027
Reputation oft got without
merit and lost without deserving.

366
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:45,769
I tell you what you shall do.

367
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,236
Our general's wife is
now the general.

368
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,806
Confess yourself freely to her.

369
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:54,272
Desdemona is of so free, so
kind, so blessed a disposition

370
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,142
she holds it a vice in her
goodness not to do more than

371
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,237
she is requested.

372
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,082
Farewell, lieutenant.

373
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:12,720
Roderigo.

374
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,657
My money is almost spent,

375
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,793
i have been tonight exceedingly
well cudgeled.

376
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,694
And i think the issue will be,

377
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,109
i shall have so much experience
for my pains, and so, with

378
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:29,873
no money at all, and a little
more wit, return again to venice.

379
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:33,050
How poor are they that
have not patience!

380
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:34,777
Does not go well?

381
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,515
Cassio has beaten thee, and
thou by that small hurt hath

382
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,352
cashiered cassio.

383
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,789
Content thyself awhile.

384
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,387
For whiles this honest fool
plies desdemona to repair

385
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,124
his fortune, and she for him
pleads strongly to the moor.

386
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,464
Io, by how much she strives

387
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,433
to do him good, she shall
undo her credit with the moor.

388
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:56,598
So will i turn her virtue into pitch,
and out of her own

389
00:32:56,708 --> 00:33:00,109
goodness make the net
that shall enmesh them all.

390
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,845
Do not doubt, cassio.

391
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:47,581
I'll have my lord and you again
as friendly as you were.

392
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:50,956
Madam, whatever shall become
of michael cassio, he's never

393
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,427
anything but your true servant.

394
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,865
Ha! I like not that.

395
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,728
What dost thou say?

396
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:59,664
Nothing, my lord, or if,
i know not what.

397
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,496
How now, my lord?

398
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,835
I have been talking with
a suitor here.

399
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,873
A man that languishes in
your displeasure.

400
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:06,772
Who is't you mean?

401
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:07,936
Why, your lieutenant cassio.

402
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:09,180
Went he hence now?

403
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,115
I' sooth so humbled that he hath
left part of his grief with me

404
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,146
to suffer with him.

405
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,476
Good love, call him back.

406
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:15,483
Some other time.

407
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,779
- Shall't be shortly?
- The sooner, sweet, for you.

408
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:20,413
- Shall't be tonight at supper?
- No, not tonight.

409
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:20,991
Tomorrow dinner then?

410
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,393
I shall not dine at home.

411
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,951
I meet the captains
at the citadel.

412
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,426
Why then, tomorrow night.
I prithee name the time.

413
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,327
No more. Let him come
when he will.

414
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,495
I will deny thee nothing.

415
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,871
Whereon i do beseech thee

416
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,434
grant me this to leave me
but a little to myself.

417
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:44,980
Shall i deny you? No.
Farewell, my lord.

418
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:53,084
- My noble lord.
- What dost thou say, lago?

419
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,426
Did michael cassio, when you
wooed my lady,

420
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,552
know of your love?

421
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,695
He did, from first to last.
Why dost thou ask?

422
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,136
But for a satisfaction of my
thought, no further harm.

423
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,138
Why of thy thought, lago?

424
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,201
I did not think he had been
acquainted with her.

425
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,034
O, yes, and went between us
very oft.

426
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,770
- Indeed?
- Indeed? Ay, indeed.

427
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,941
Discern'st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

428
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:26,281
- Honest, my lord?
- Honest? Ay, honest!

429
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,414
My lord, for aught i know.

430
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,184
What dost thou think?

431
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,226
Think, my lord?

432
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,822
Think. Thou dost mean something.

433
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,461
I heard thee say even now,
thou lik'st not that,

434
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:40,036
when cassio left my wife.

435
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,466
If thou dost love me
show me thou thought.

436
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,839
My lord, you know i love you.

437
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,506
I think thou dost.

438
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,517
For michael cassio, i dare

439
00:35:56,254 --> 00:36:01,214
be sworn, i think he is honest.
I think so, too.

440
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,096
Men should be what they seem.

441
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,324
Certain, men should be
what they seem.

442
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,459
Why then, i think cassio's
an honest man.

443
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,830
Nay, yet there's more in this?

444
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,507
I prithee speak to me as
to thy thinkings.

445
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,249
Good name in man and woman,

446
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:31,719
dear my lord, is the immediate
jewel of their souls.

447
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,921
Who steals my purse steals
trash; 'this something, nothing.

448
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,291
Twas mine, 'tis his, and has
been slave to thousands.

449
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,257
But he that flinches from me
my good name robs me of

450
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:48,000
that which not enriches him
and makes me poor indeed.

451
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,437
By heaven, i'll know
thy thoughts.

452
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,203
Beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster,

453
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,108
which doth mock the meat
it feeds on.

454
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,408
That cuckold lives in bliss
who, certain of his fate,

455
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:58,445
loves not his wronger.

456
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:02,517
But o, what damned minutes
tells he over who dotes,

457
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:07,153
yet doubts, suspects,
yet fondly loves!

458
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,923
Why? Why is this?

459
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,562
Think'st thou i'd make a life of

460
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,534
jealousy to follow still the
changes of the moon with

461
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:23,696
fresh suspicions?
No, lago, i'll see before i doubt.

462
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,173
When i doubt, prove.
I speak not yet of proof.

463
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:32,613
Look to your wife.
Observe her well with cassio.

464
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:46,888
I know our country disposition
well.

465
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,760
In venice they do let heaven

466
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,700
see the pranks they dare not
show their husbands.

467
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,433
Their best conscience is not to
leave't undone but kept unknown.

468
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,700
Dost thou say so?

469
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,070
She did deceive her father,
marrying you.

470
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,543
And when she seemed to shake
and fear your looks,

471
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,612
she loved them most.

472
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:05,414
And so she did.

473
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:10,179
Why, go to then! She that so
young could give out such a

474
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:13,517
seeming to seel her father's
eyes up close as oak.

475
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:17,387
He thought 'twas witchcraft.
But i am much to blame.

476
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:20,361
I humbly do beseech you of my
pardon for too much loving you.

477
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,261
I'm bound to thee forever.

478
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,907
I see this hath a little
dashed your spirit.

479
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,144
Not a jot, not a jot.

480
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,379
Trust me, i fear it has.

481
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:48,323
I hope you will consider what
is spoke comes from my love.

482
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:50,887
Cassio's my worthy friend.

483
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,221
My lord, i see you're moved!

484
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,790
No, not much moved.

485
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:02,830
I do not think but
desdemona's honest.

486
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,871
Long live she so.
And long live you to think so.

487
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,879
And yet, how nature erring
from itself

488
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,110
ay, there's the point, as to

489
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:18,314
be bold with you, not to
affect many proposed matches

490
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,715
of her own clime, complexion,
and degree.

491
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:28,092
One may smell in such a will
most rank, foul disproportions,

492
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:29,926
thought unnatural.

493
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,737
My lord, i would i might entreat
your honor to scan this thing

494
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,276
no further. Leave it to time.

495
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,736
Farewell.

496
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,139
Leave me, lago.

497
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,152
How now, my dear othello?

498
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,154
My lord, i take my leave.

499
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:00,991
Are you not well?

500
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,492
I have a pain upon my
forehead here.

501
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:05,795
Why, that's with watching.

502
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:06,903
It will away again.

503
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,266
Let me but bind it hard, within
hours it will be well.

504
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,672
Your napkin is too little.
Let it alone!

505
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,070
I have a thing for you.

506
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:17,833
You have a thing for me?

507
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,535
It is a common thing to
have a foolish wife.

508
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,406
O, is that all? What will you

509
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,843
give me now for that
same handkerchief?

510
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:24,673
What handkerchief?

511
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,977
That which so often you
did bid me to steal.

512
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:27,845
Give it me.

513
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,350
If it be not for some purpose
of import, give't me again.

514
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:31,847
Poor lady, she'll run mad.

515
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:34,823
I have use for it. Leave me.

516
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:05,384
How now, general?

517
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,048
I swear 'tis better to be much

518
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,091
abused than but to
know't a little.

519
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,919
- My lord!
- Is my lord angry?

520
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,153
He went hence but now, and
certainly in strange unquietness.

521
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,491
- I will go seek him.
- I prithee do so.

522
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,067
There's matter in't indeed
if he be angry.

523
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:30,438
Villain, be sure thou prove
my love a whore, be sure of it!

524
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,816
Give me the ocular proof,

525
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,719
or, by the worth of mine eternal
soul, thou hadst been better

526
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,345
have been born a dog than
answer my waked wrath!

527
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:38,978
Is't come to this?

528
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:41,318
Make me to see't, or at the
least so prove it that

529
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,020
the probation bear no hinge
nor loop to hang a doubt on

530
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,760
or woe upon thy life!

531
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,957
Never pray more,
abandon all remorse.

532
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,964
For nothing canst thou to
damnation add greater than that.

533
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:53,003
O monstrous world!

534
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,628
Take note, take note, o world!

535
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,396
To be direct and honest
is not safe.

536
00:42:56,507 --> 00:43:04,004
By the world i think my wife
be honest, and think she is not.

537
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:08,584
I think that thou art just, and
think thou art not.

538
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,244
I'll have some proof. Her name,

539
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:16,220
that was as fresh as dian's
visage, is now begrimed and

540
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,329
black as mine own face.

541
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:22,455
Would i were satisfied!

542
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,099
How satisfied, my lord?

543
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:28,035
Would you, the supervisor,
grossly gape on?

544
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,233
Behold her topped?

545
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,805
It is impossible you should
see this.

546
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,143
Were they as prime as goats,
as hot as monkey?

547
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,843
Give me a living reason
she's disloyal!

548
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:46,522
I lay with cassio lately, and
being trouble with a raging

549
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,552
tooth, i could not sleep.

550
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:50,650
There are a kind of men so loose
or should that in their sleeps

551
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,194
will mutter their affairs.

552
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,355
One of this kind is cassio.

553
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,795
In sleep i heard him say,

554
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:03,433
sweet desdemona, let us
be wary, let us hid our loves.

555
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,241
And then, sir, would he gripe
and wring my hand, cry

556
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,369
o sweet creature! Then kiss

557
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:11,107
me hard as if he plucked up
kisses by the roots that grew

558
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:15,277
upon my lips, laid his leg o'er
my thigh, and sigh, and kiss

559
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,918
and then cry, cursed fate
that gave thee to the moor!

560
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,388
I'll tear her all to pieces!

561
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:23,585
Tell me but this. Have you not
sometimes seen a handkerchief

562
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,786
spotted with strawberries in
your wife's hand?

563
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,020
I gave her such a one.

564
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:30,157
Such a handkerchief, i'm sure
it was your wife's, did i today

565
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,098
see cassio wipe his face.

566
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,604
If it be that

567
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,800
if it be that, or any that was

568
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,940
hers, it speaks against her
with the other proofs.

569
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:46,180
Now do i see 'tis true.

570
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,917
O, that the slave had
forty thousand lives!

571
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:53,546
One is too poor, too week
for my revenge!

572
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:58,993
- Yet be content!
- Blood, blood, blood!

573
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:03,130
Patience, i say.
Your mind may change.

574
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,669
Never, lago. Like to the pontiac

575
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,502
sea, whose icy current and
compulsive course nev'r keeps

576
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,969
retiring ebb, but keeps due on
to the propontic and the

577
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:12,599
hellespont.

578
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,470
Even so my bloody thoughts,

579
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:18,047
with violent pace, shall nev'r
look back, nev'r ebb to humble

580
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:21,674
love, till that a capable and
wide revenge swallow them up.

581
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:24,915
Witness that here lago doth
give up the execution of

582
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,520
his wit, hands, heart to
wronged othello's service.

583
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:28,750
Within these three days let me

584
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,294
here thee say that
cassio's not alive.

585
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:34,522
My friend is dead. 'tis done
at your request.

586
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:36,959
But let her live.

587
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,466
Damn her, lewd minx!

588
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:41,060
O, damn her!

589
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:50,137
Now art thou my lieutenant.

590
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:53,114
I am your own forever.

591
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,569
Cassio! Cassio!

592
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,772
Give me your hand.

593
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,081
This hand is moist, my lady.

594
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,344
It hath felt no age nor
known no sorrow.

595
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:10,587
This argues fruitfulness and
liberal heart. Hot, hot and most.

596
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,961
'Tis a good hand, a frank one.

597
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:16,089
You may, indeed, say so
for 'twas that hand that

598
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,258
gave away my heart.

599
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,629
A liberal hand.

600
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,303
Come now, your promise.

601
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:23,202
- What promise, chuck?
- Let cassio be received again.

602
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,076
Lend me thy handkerchief.

603
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,640
I have it not about me.

604
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,676
- Not?
- No, indeed, my lord.

605
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:34,875
That's a fault. That handkerchief

606
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,043
did an egyptian to my mother
give.

607
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,111
The worms were hallowed that
did breed the silk.

608
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:40,790
Then would to god that
i had never seen't.

609
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:44,286
Is't lost? Is't gone?
Speak, is it out of the way?

610
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,390
It is not lost.
But what an if it were?

611
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:47,393
How?

612
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,856
I say it is not lost.

613
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:51,724
Fetch't, let me see it!

614
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,961
Why, so i can, but i will
not now.

615
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,297
This is a trick to put me
from my suit.

616
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,234
Pray you let cassio
be received again.

617
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,808
- The handkerchief!
- I pray talking of cassio

618
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:01,567
the handkerchief!

619
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,542
A man that all his time hath founded
his good fortunes on your love,

620
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,680
- shares dangers with you
- the handkerchief!

621
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,181
Come, come, you'll never
meet a more sufficient man.

622
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:17,326
Away. Away!
Away!

623
00:48:19,129 --> 00:48:21,256
Cassio, this handkerchief.
Whose is it?

624
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,829
I found it here.
I like the work well.

625
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,296
'Tis very good!
Shall i see you soon at night?

626
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,305
I will see you soon, bianca.

627
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,933
- Come, lieutenant.
- Cassio, handkerchief.

628
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,800
Take it. Have it copied
thee made for it.

629
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,081
Tell you yet once more,

630
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:43,979
importune desdemona to
put you in your place again.

631
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:49,954
Sure there's some wonder
in this handkerchief.

632
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,958
'Tis a year or two shows
us a man.

633
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,290
They're all but stomachs,
and we all but food. Cassio!

634
00:48:56,867 --> 00:49:02,328
They eat us hungerly, and
when they're full, they belch us.

635
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,942
How now, good cassio?
What's the news with you?

636
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:21,413
What trumpet is that same?
Something from venice.

637
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:41,970
My noble lord, whilest you
were here, overwhelmed with

638
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:45,146
your grief, cassio came hither.
I shifted him aways, bade him

639
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,112
anon return, and
here speak with me.

640
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,279
Mark the fleers, the gibes,

641
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,354
and notable scorns that dwell
in every region of his face.

642
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,293
For i will make him tell
the tale anew,

643
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:00,396
where, how, how oft, how
long ago, and when he hath

644
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:02,794
and is again to cope your wife.

645
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,139
I say, but mark his gesture.

646
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,204
Marry patience, or i shall say
you're all in all in spleen,

647
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,605
and nothing of a man.
Dost thou hear, lago?

648
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,675
I will be found most cunning
in my patience.

649
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:23,783
But - dost thou hear? -
most bloody.

650
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,649
- How do you know, lieutenant?
- Lago.

651
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,058
Now, if this suit lay in bianca's
power,

652
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,092
how quickly should you speed!

653
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,853
Alas, poor caitiff!

654
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,333
I never knew woman love
man so.

655
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:43,130
She gives it out that
you shall marry her.

656
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,900
Ay!

657
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,977
I was talking on the sea bank,
and the bauble falls me thus

658
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,086
about my neck

659
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,282
so hangs, and lolls, and
weeps upon me,

660
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:03,388
so shakes and pulls me!

661
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:06,360
- Cassio!
- I must leave her company.

662
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:10,427
What did you mean by that same
handkerchief you gave me even now?

663
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,561
A likely piece of work that
you should find it in your

664
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:14,862
chamber and know not who
left i t there!

665
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,239
This is some minx's token.

666
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,030
I'll take out no work on't.

667
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,036
Now now, my sweet bianca?
How now?

668
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,541
After her! After her!

669
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,978
Did you see how he laughed
at his vice?

670
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,721
O lago.

671
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:33,384
Did you see the handkerchief?

672
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,816
Was that mine?

673
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:40,153
Desdemona gave it him, and
he hath giv'n it his whore.

674
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,909
I had been happy if the general
camp, pioners and all, had

675
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,078
tasted her sweet body.

676
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,540
So i had nothing known.

677
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:05,145
What sense had i of her
stolen hours of lust?

678
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:08,920
I saw it not, it harmed me not.

679
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,826
I slept the next night well,
was free and merry!

680
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:18,295
I found not cassio's kisses
on her lips.

681
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:29,109
A fine woman, a fair woman,
a sweet woman.

682
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,414
Nay, you must forget that.

683
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:40,954
Ay, let her rot and perish,
and be damned.

684
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:47,728
No, my heart is turned to stone.
I strike it and it hurts my hand.

685
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,159
O, the world hath not a
sweeter creature!

686
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:58,970
She might lie by an emperor's
side and command him tasks.

687
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,209
Nay, that's not your way.

688
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:06,575
Hang her! I do but say
what she is.

689
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,013
So delicate with her needle.

690
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,880
An admirable musician.

691
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:19,153
O, she will sing the savageness
out of a bear.

692
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,922
Of so high and plenteous
wit and invention

693
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,065
she's the worse for all this.

694
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,632
O, a thousand, a thousand
times.

695
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,906
Of so gentle a condition?

696
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,267
Ay, too gentle.

697
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:37,512
Nay, that's certain.
Yet the pity of it, lago.

698
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:43,485
O lago, the pity of it, lago.

699
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,583
I will chop her into messes!

700
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,786
Cuckold me!

701
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,237
- Will you think so?
- Think so, lago?

702
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:06,399
- What, to kiss in private?
- An unauthorized kiss?

703
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:09,167
Or to be naked with her
friend in bed an hour or more

704
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,936
not meaning any harm.

705
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:12,641
Naked in bed?

706
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:13,678
But if i give my wife
a handkerchief

707
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:14,611
what then?

708
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:17,048
Why, then 'tis hers, my lord,
and being hers shy may,

709
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,152
i think, bestow't on any man.

710
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,017
By heaven, i would most
gladly have forgot it!

711
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,849
He had my handkerchief!

712
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,491
- Ay, what of that?
- That's not so good now.

713
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,888
What if i had said i had seen
him do you wrong?

714
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,857
- Or heard him say
- hath he said anything?

715
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:29,858
He hath, my lord, but
no more than

716
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:30,532
what hath he said?

717
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:34,431
That he did i know not what he did
what? What?

718
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,066
Lie.

719
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:41,808
Lie with her?

720
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:46,673
With her, on her, what you will.

721
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,293
Damnation!

722
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:35,390
My lord, i say, othello!

723
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,706
Dost thou mock me?

724
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:54,874
I mock you not, by heaven.

725
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:40,027
O now for ever farewell
the tranquil mind.

726
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,390
Farewell content.

727
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,095
Farewell the plumed troops,
and the big wars that make

728
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:54,876
ambition virtue. O farewell!

729
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:58,839
Farewell the neighing steed and
the shrill trump,

730
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:04,551
the spirit-stirring drum,
th'ear-piercing fife, the royal

731
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:11,024
banner, and all quality,
pride, pomp, and circumstance,

732
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,729
of glorious war.

733
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:19,802
And o you mortal engines
whose rude throats the immortal

734
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:23,132
jove's dread clamors
counterfeit.

735
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:29,500
Farewell! Othello's occupation's
gone!

736
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:12,649
- God save you, worthy general.
- Pray you.

737
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,621
The duke and the senators
of venice greet you.

738
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:25,433
I kiss the instrument of
their pleasures.

739
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:42,110
Is there division 'twixt my lord
and cassio?

740
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:45,413
A most unhappy one, i would
do much t' atome them,

741
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,488
for the love i bear to cassio.

742
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,252
My lord?

743
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,687
May be th' letter moved him,
for, i think, they do command

744
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,556
him home, deputing cassio
in his government.

745
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:56,230
- Trust me, i am glad on it.
- Indeed?

746
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:04,998
- Why, sweet othello
- devil! Out of my way!

747
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:06,632
I will not stay to offend you.

748
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,367
Truly an obedient lady.

749
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:10,912
I do beseech your lordship
call her back.

750
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,342
- Mistress!
- My lord!

751
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,516
What would you do with her, sir?

752
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,850
Who? I, my lord?

753
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:16,318
You did wish that i would make
her turn.

754
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:21,253
Sir, she can turn, and turn,
and yet go on and turn again,

755
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:22,751
and she can weep, sir, weep.

756
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,651
And she's obedient, as you say,
obedient. Very obedient.

757
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:28,022
Proceed you in your tears.

758
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:30,226
Concerning this, sir

759
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:35,836
o well-painted passion!
I am commanded home.

760
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:41,407
Get you away, i'll send
for you anon.

761
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:50,385
Sir, i obey the mandate and
will return to venice.

762
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,154
Cassio shall have my place.

763
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,395
You are welcome, sir,
to cyprus.

764
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:14,340
Goats and monkeys!

765
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:21,309
Is he not light of brain?

766
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,151
He's that he is.

767
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,643
Let me see your eyes.

768
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,651
Look in my face.

769
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:13,164
Why, what art thou?

770
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:16,137
Your wife, my lord.
Your true and loyal wife.

771
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:20,734
Had it pleased heaven to try me
with affliction, had they rained

772
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:25,209
all kinds of sores and shames
on my bare head, steeped me

773
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:29,112
in poverty to the very lips,
given to captivity me and

774
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,512
my utmost hopes.

775
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:37,722
I should have found in some
place of my soul a drop of patinece

776
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:43,858
but, alas, to make me the fixed
figure for the time of scorn

777
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:46,731
to point his slow and moving
finger at.

778
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:51,101
Yet could i bear that too, well,
very well.

779
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:58,603
But there where i have garnered
up my heart, where either

780
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:04,219
i must live or bear no life,
the fountain from the which my

781
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:14,352
current runs or else dries up,
to be discarded thence, or

782
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:19,367
keep it as a cistern for foul
toads to knot and gender in.

783
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,867
I hope my noble lord
esteems me honest.

784
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:26,402
O, ay, as summer flies are
in the shambles, that quicken

785
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,206
even with blowing.

786
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:37,385
O, thou weed, who art so
lovely fair, and smell'st so

787
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:42,521
sweet, that the sense aches
at thee, would thou hadst

788
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,763
never been born!

789
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:51,760
Alas, what ignorant sin
have i committed?

790
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:58,501
Committed? A thou public
commoner, i should make very

791
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:01,643
forges of my cheeks that would
to cinders burn up modestly.

792
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:04,575
Did i but speak thy deeds.
What committed?

793
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:07,442
Heaven stops the nose at it,
and the moon winks,

794
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,676
the bawdy wind that kisses all
it meets is hushed within the

795
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:15,187
hollow mine of earth and
will not hear't. What committed?

796
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:23,599
- Are not you a strumpet?
- By heaven you do me wrong!

797
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:27,430
- Are not you a strumpet?
- No, as i am a christian!

798
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:28,763
- Is't possible?
- O heaven forgive us!

799
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,768
I cry you mercy then.

800
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:35,602
I took you for that cunning
whore of venice that married with othello

801
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:09,275
how do you, madam?

802
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,845
How do you, my good lady?

803
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:15,551
Faith, half asleep.

804
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:18,152
Good madam, what's the
matter with my lord?

805
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,343
With who?

806
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:21,785
Why, with my lord, madam.

807
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:25,954
Who is thy lord?

808
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:27,925
He that is yours, sweet lady.

809
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:33,665
I have none. Do not talk
to me, emilia.

810
01:04:34,937 --> 01:04:38,532
I cannot weep, nor answers have
i none, but what should go by water

811
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:50,112
prithee tonight lay on my
wedding sheets, remember.

812
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:41,196
Get me some poison, lago,
this night.

813
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:46,331
I'll not expostulate with her,
lest her body and beauty

814
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,837
unprovide my mind again.

815
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,806
Do it not with poison.

816
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:56,779
Strangle her in her bed, even
the bed she hath contaminated.

817
01:05:56,986 --> 01:06:00,080
Good, good! The justice of
it pleases.

818
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:04,826
And for cassio, let me be
his undertaker.

819
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:08,924
Excellent good!

820
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,062
You shall hear more by midnight.

821
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,586
A halter pardon him!

822
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,887
And hell gnaw his ones!

823
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,116
Who should he call her whore?

824
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:39,358
Who keeps her company?

825
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:41,955
What time? What place?

826
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:45,960
What form? What likelihood?

827
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,799
The moor's abused by some
most villainous knave,

828
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:51,202
some base notorious knave,
some scurvy fellow!

829
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,807
Speak within doors.

830
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:55,937
Some such squire he was
that turned your wit the steamy

831
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:59,343
side without and made you to
suspect me with the moor.

832
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:00,949
Desdemona.

833
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,083
Get you to bed.

834
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,428
Dismiss your attendant there.

835
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:15,260
Look't be done.

836
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:22,263
I do not find that thou deal'st
justly with me.

837
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:23,626
What in the contrary?

838
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:26,997
Every day thou daff'st me
with some device, lago.

839
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:29,500
I have wasted myself out of
my means.

840
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,635
The jewels you have had from
me to deliver desdemona would

841
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,572
half have corrupted a votarist.

842
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:38,075
You have tole me she hath
received them, and returned

843
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,215
me expectations and comforts
of sudden respect and

844
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:43,375
acquaintance, but i find none.

845
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:46,020
Very well. Go to.

846
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:48,622
I cannot go to, man,
nor 'tis not very well.

847
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,291
I will make myself known
to desdemona.

848
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:53,761
She will return me my jewels.

849
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:59,197
If not, i will seek satisfaction
of you.

850
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:02,428
Now i see there's a mettle
in thee, and even from this

851
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:05,540
instant do build on thee a
better opinion than ever before.

852
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:07,843
Give me thy hand, roderigo.

853
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,615
I protest i have dealt
mostly directly in thy affair.

854
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:17,986
It hath not appeared.

855
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:22,017
I grant thee it hath not appeared,
and your suspicion is not

856
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:25,160
without wit and judgment.

857
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:29,326
If thou hast that in thee indeed
which i have greater reason

858
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:31,194
to believe now than ever,

859
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:37,334
i mean purpose, courage, and
valor, this night prove it.

860
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:44,311
If thou the next night following
enjoy not desdemona,

861
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:48,510
take me from this world
with treachery.

862
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:04,756
There is especial commission
come from venice to depute

863
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,232
cassio in othello's place.

864
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:11,801
Why, then othello and desdemona
return again to venice.

865
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:15,503
Unless his abode be lingered
here by some accident, wherein

866
01:10:15,811 --> 01:10:21,408
none can be so determinate
as the removing of cassio.

867
01:10:21,817 --> 01:10:24,615
How do you mean, removing him?

868
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,580
Why, by making him uncapable
of othello's place.

869
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:31,616
Knocking him out his brains.

870
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:36,325
And that you would have
me to do?

871
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:52,443
I will be near to second your attempt,
and he shall fall between us.

872
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:00,253
I have no great devotion
to the deed.

873
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:01,514
It makes us, or it mars us.

874
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:03,018
Think on that.

875
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,138
Lago.

876
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:38,119
Lago.

877
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:12,545
Hark! Who is it that knocks?

878
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:14,681
It is the wind.

879
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,699
I called my love false love.

880
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:28,694
But what said he then?

881
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,477
O, these men, these men

882
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:44,743
dost thou in conscience think,
tell me emilia, that there be

883
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:48,690
women do abuse their husbands
in such gross kind?

884
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,987
There be some such,
no question.

885
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:53,126
Wouldst thou do such a deed
for all the world?

886
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,623
Why, would not you?

887
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:55,886
No, by this heavenly light!

888
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:57,989
Nor i neither by this
heavenly light.

889
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,997
I might do it as well as
in the dark.

890
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:02,930
Wouldst thou do such a deed
for all the world?

891
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,275
The world's a huge place.

892
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,743
It is a great price for a small vice.

893
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:10,705
In troth, i think thou
wouldst not.

894
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,770
In troth, i think i should.

895
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:15,842
Marry, i would not do such a
thing for a joint-ring, nor for

896
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:18,748
measures of lawn, nor for
gowns, petticoats, nor caps,

897
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:22,323
nor any petty exhibition, but
for all the whole world?

898
01:14:22,424 --> 01:14:24,449
I do not think there is
any such woman.

899
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:29,561
Yes, a dozen, but i do think
it is their husbands' faults

900
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:30,858
if wives do fall.

901
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,862
Say that they slack their duties
and pour our treasures into

902
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:36,732
foreign laps, or else break out
in peevish jealousies, throwing

903
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:40,864
restraint upon us,
or say they strike us.

904
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:45,473
We have galls, and though
we have some grace.

905
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:47,138
Yet have we some revenge.

906
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:50,608
Let husbands know their wives
have sense like them.

907
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:51,708
They see, and smell.

908
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:55,353
And have their palates both for
sweet and sour, as husbands have.

909
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:58,251
What is it that they do when
they change us for others?

910
01:14:58,527 --> 01:15:00,051
Is it sport? I think it is.

911
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:02,393
And doth affection breed it?
I think it doth.

912
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:05,496
Is't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too.

913
01:15:05,934 --> 01:15:09,927
And have we not affections?
Desires for sport? And frailty?

914
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:11,800
As men have?

915
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:15,434
Then let them use us well,
else let them know, the ills

916
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:17,738
we do, their ills instructs us so.

917
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:20,914
Good night. Good night.

918
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:19,672
It is the cause, it is the cause,
my soul.

919
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:24,108
Let me not name it for you,
you chaste stars.

920
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:31,316
It is the cause. Yet i'll not
shed her blood.

921
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:37,155
Nor scar that whiter skin of
hers than snow, and smooth

922
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:39,726
as monumental alabaster.

923
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:46,490
Yet she must die, else she'll
betray more men.

924
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:51,461
Put out the light, and then
put out the light.

925
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:56,366
If i quench thee, thou flaming
minister, i can again they

926
01:17:56,638 --> 01:17:59,766
former light restore, should
i repent me.

927
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:05,573
But once put out thy light,
those cunning'st pattern of

928
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:10,844
excelling nature, i know not
where is that promethean heat

929
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:14,784
than can thy light relume.

930
01:18:15,657 --> 01:18:18,217
- Othello.
- Ay, desdemona.

931
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,189
Will you come to bed, my lord?

932
01:18:29,738 --> 01:18:31,069
Have you prayed tonight,
desdemona?

933
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:31,639
Ay, my lord.

934
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,206
If you bethink yourself of any
crime unreconciled as yet to

935
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:37,970
heaven and grace,
solicit for it straight.

936
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,712
Alas, my lord, what may you
mean by that?

937
01:18:41,316 --> 01:18:42,613
Well, do it, and be brief.

938
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:47,219
I would not kill thy
unprepared spirit.

939
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,221
No, heaven forfend!

940
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:54,056
I would not kill thy soul.

941
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:55,826
Talk you of killing?

942
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:58,758
Ay, i do.

943
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:00,961
Then heaven have mercy on me.

944
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:03,671
Amen, with all my heart.

945
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:08,968
If you say so, i hope
you will not kill me.

946
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:14,745
Peace! And be still.

947
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:20,046
I will so, and yet i fear you.

948
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:23,750
Why i should fear i know not,
since guiltiness i know not.

949
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:26,050
But yet i feel i fear.

950
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:29,930
That handkerchief!

951
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:33,658
That handkerchief which i so
loved and gave thee,

952
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:35,569
thou gave it to cassio.

953
01:19:35,971 --> 01:19:37,529
No, by my life and soul!

954
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,365
Send for the man and ask him.

955
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:40,472
Sweet soul, take heed.

956
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,301
Take heed of perjury,
thou art on thy deathbed.

957
01:19:44,546 --> 01:19:46,241
- Lord have mercy on me.
- I say amen.

958
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,511
And have your mercy too.
I never loved cassion in my life.

959
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:51,208
I saw the handkerchief.
He found it then,

960
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,215
i never gave it to him.

961
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:54,582
Send for him, let him
confess the truth.

962
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:55,757
He hath confessed.

963
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:56,449
What, my lord?

964
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:57,991
That he hath used thee.

965
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:03,521
How? Unlawfully?

966
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,332
Ay.

967
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:08,200
He will not say so.

968
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,495
No, his mouth is stopped.

969
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:14,033
Honest lago hath taken
order for it.

970
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:15,965
What, is he dead?

971
01:20:16,378 --> 01:20:19,347
Had all his hairs been lives,
my great revenge had

972
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:20,812
stomach for them all.

973
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:24,047
Out, strumpet! Weep'st thou
for him to my face?

974
01:20:24,252 --> 01:20:26,277
O, banish me, my lord,
but kill me not!

975
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:27,749
Down, strumpet!

976
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:30,015
Kill me tomorrow, let me
live tonight!

977
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:37,388
It is too late.

978
01:21:02,424 --> 01:21:04,517
Now how dost thou look now?

979
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:10,787
Cold, cold, my girl,
even like thy chastity!

980
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:14,124
O cursed, cursed slave!

981
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:16,827
Whip me, ye devils, from the
possession of this heavenly sight!

982
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:18,504
Blow me about in winds!

983
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:20,502
Roast me in sulphur!

984
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:25,135
Wash me in steep-down gulfs
of liquid fire!

985
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:33,979
O desdemon! Dead desdemon!
Dead, o! O!

986
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:36,117
My lord! My lord!

987
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:39,385
What, ho, my lord! My lord!

988
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,925
I do beseech you that
i may speak with you, my lord.

989
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:46,265
What, ho, my lord!

990
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:47,894
I had forgot thee.

991
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:50,697
O my good lord, yonder...,
alas, what cry is that?

992
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:52,064
Yonder's murders done.

993
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:56,207
It is the very error of the moon.

994
01:21:57,479 --> 01:22:00,312
She comes more nearer earth
than she was wont

995
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:03,278
and that makes men mad.

996
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:08,115
Alas! That was my lady's voice.

997
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:12,960
O! Sweet desdemona!
Who hath done this deed?

998
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,862
Nobody, i myself.

999
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,932
Commend me to my kind lord.

1000
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:49,019
You heard her say herself.

1001
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,423
It was not i.

1002
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,830
She said so. I must needs
report the truth.

1003
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:55,300
She's like a liar gone
to burning hell!

1004
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:57,299
It was i that killed her.

1005
01:22:57,772 --> 01:23:00,741
She turned to folly, and
she was a whore!

1006
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:01,601
Liar!

1007
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,040
Cassio did top her.

1008
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:04,438
Ask thy husband else!

1009
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:05,843
That she was false to wedlock?

1010
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,038
Ay, with cassio.

1011
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:11,651
Had she been true, if heaven
would make me such another

1012
01:23:11,786 --> 01:23:16,450
world of one entire and perfect
chrysolite,

1013
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:19,726
i'd not have sold her for it.

1014
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:21,987
My husband say she was false?

1015
01:23:22,163 --> 01:23:23,755
Ay, it was he that told me
on her first.

1016
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:27,025
An honest man he is, and hates
the slime that sticks

1017
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:28,462
on filthy deeds.

1018
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:31,232
She was too fond of her
most filthy bargain.

1019
01:23:31,373 --> 01:23:31,930
Peace.

1020
01:23:32,107 --> 01:23:33,904
- Do thy worst.
- Peace.

1021
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:35,969
This deed of thine is no more
worthy heaven than

1022
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,201
thou wast worthy her.

1023
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:38,539
Peace, you were best.

1024
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:43,174
O gull! O dolt! As ignorant
as dirt!

1025
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:45,809
I'll make thee known though
i lost twenty lives.

1026
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:48,748
Help! Help, ho, help!

1027
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,992
Murder! Help, ho!

1028
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:53,523
Disprove this villain, if thou
be'st a man.

1029
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:55,152
He says thou told'st him that
his wife was false.

1030
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:56,557
I know thou didst not.

1031
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:58,763
Speak, for my heart is full.

1032
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:00,992
I told him what i thought, and
told no more than what he

1033
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:02,567
found himself was apt and true.

1034
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:04,102
But did you ever tell him
she was false?

1035
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:05,664
I did.

1036
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:11,968
You told a lie, upon my
soul, a lie! A wicked lie!

1037
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,910
Did you say with cassio?

1038
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:15,639
With cassio, mistress.

1039
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:16,774
Go to, charm your tongue.

1040
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,079
I will not charm my tongue.

1041
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:19,811
I am bound to speak.

1042
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:22,983
My mistress here lies
murdered in her bed.

1043
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,384
Heaven forfend!

1044
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:29,328
Nay, stare not, masters.

1045
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:32,330
It is true indeed.

1046
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,536
Villainy, villainy, villainy!

1047
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:40,137
I think upon it, i think i smell it.

1048
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:43,276
O villainy! I thought so then.

1049
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,075
I'll kill myself for grief.

1050
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:49,439
What, are you mad?

1051
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:50,641
Good gentlemen!

1052
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:51,951
I'll charge you get your home.

1053
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:54,314
Let me have leave to speak.

1054
01:24:55,657 --> 01:24:59,718
It is proper i obey him,
but not now.

1055
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:05,992
Perchance, lago, i will
never go home.

1056
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:07,397
Nay, lay thee down and roar,
for thou hast killed the sweetest

1057
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:12,470
innocent that ever
did lift up eye.

1058
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:13,732
O, she was foul!

1059
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:16,470
Lago knows that she with
cassio hath the act of shame

1060
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,211
a thousand times committed.

1061
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:18,710
O heaven!

1062
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:21,839
Cassio confessed it, and she
did gratify his amorous works

1063
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,550
with that handkerchief!

1064
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:24,577
Handkerchief!

1065
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:27,287
- 'Twill out, 'twill out!
- Hold your peace.

1066
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,322
I peace? No! I will speak as
liberal as the north!

1067
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,356
Be wise.

1068
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:37,096
Heaven! A man, devil did
them all, all, all!

1069
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:40,358
I shame against me,
yet i'll speak.

1070
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:43,829
Oh, thou dull moor, that
handkerchief thou speaks of

1071
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:47,270
i found by fortune, and did
give my husband

1072
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:09,955
she was chaste, she loved thee.

1073
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:17,461
She loved thee.

1074
01:26:32,487 --> 01:26:35,718
Othello, did you and he
consent in cassio's death?

1075
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:36,812
Ay.

1076
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:39,223
Dear general, i never gave
you cause.

1077
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:42,553
Othello, your power and
your command is taken off,

1078
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:45,032
and cassio rules in cyprus.

1079
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:52,706
Be not afraid though you do
see me weaponed.

1080
01:26:57,245 --> 01:27:00,112
Here is my journey's end.

1081
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:05,210
Here is my butt, the very
seamark of my utmost sail.

1082
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:15,918
Will you, i pray, demand that
demi-devil why he hath thus

1083
01:27:16,064 --> 01:27:17,793
ensnared my soul and body?

1084
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,799
Demand me nothing.

1085
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:25,773
What you know, you know.

1086
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:32,736
Are there no stones in heaven
but what serves for the thunder?

1087
01:28:03,478 --> 01:28:10,441
I pray you, when you shall
these unlucky deeds relate,

1088
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:15,044
speak of me as i am.

1089
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:20,927
Nothing extenuate, nor set
down aught in malice.

1090
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:32,900
Then must you speak of one that
loved not wisely, but too well.

1091
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:38,779
Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought,

1092
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:49,815
perplexed in the extreme,
of one whose hand like the

1093
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:58,293
base indian, threw a pearl
away richer than all his tribe.

1094
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:04,496
Set you down this.
