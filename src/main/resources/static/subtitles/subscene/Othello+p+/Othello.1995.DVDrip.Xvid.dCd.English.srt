1
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:50,070
'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.

2
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:56,719
But who shall lead our business
against the Turkish fleet?

3
00:02:58,355 --> 00:02:59,617
Othello.

4
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:02,919
Another of his fathom
we have none.

5
00:03:05,128 --> 00:03:07,824
The fortitude of the place
is best known to him.

6
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,915
I take it much unkindly
that thou, Iago...

7
00:03:37,127 --> 00:03:40,187
...who hast had my purse
as if the strings were thine...

8
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:42,228
...shouldst know of this.

9
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:45,697
By the faith of man,
I know my price.

10
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:50,839
I am worth no worse a place.
But he, one Michael Cassio...

11
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:55,671
...a Florentine,
must his lieutenant be.

12
00:03:55,946 --> 00:03:59,575
And I, of whom
his eyes had seen the proof...

13
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:04,243
- God bless the mark!...
his Moorship's ensign.

14
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:07,651
O by heaven, I rather
would have been his hangman.

15
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:12,591
Why, there's no remedy.
'Tis the curse of service.

16
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:17,729
I would not follow him then.

17
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:20,835
O, sir, content you.

18
00:04:21,037 --> 00:04:24,803
I follow him
to serve my turn upon him.

19
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:29,945
We cannot all be masters, nor
all masters cannot be truly followed.

20
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,243
You shall mark...

21
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:37,010
...heaven is my judge,
not I for love and duty...

22
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,316
...but seeming so for my peculiar end.

23
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:45,427
I am not what I am.

24
00:04:47,597 --> 00:04:52,534
What a full fortune does the thick-
lips owe, if he can carry it thus.

25
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:57,135
Call up her father.

26
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:13,718
Awake! Thieves! Signor!

27
00:05:13,924 --> 00:05:17,519
Thieves! Look to your house,
your daughter and your bags!

28
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,626
Signor Brabantio!
Ho!

29
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,228
- Awake!
- Sir!

30
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:24,958
Thieves! Look to your house, your
daughter and your bags!

31
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:27,830
Thieves! Thieves!

32
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:31,339
What is the reason
of this terrible summons?

33
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,634
What is the matter here?

34
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:39,072
Signor...

35
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:41,913
...is all your family within?

36
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:44,643
I know you, Roderigo...

37
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:48,585
...and have charged thee
not to haunt about my doors.

38
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,317
In honest plainness,
thou has heard me say...

39
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:53,621
...my daughter is not for thee.

40
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,957
Are your doors locked?

41
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,163
Why? Wherefore ask you this?

42
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:02,304
Even now, now, very now...

43
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:06,271
...an old black ram
is tupping your white ewe.

44
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:08,569
What profane wretch art thou?

45
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:10,439
I am one
that comes to tell you...

46
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:13,741
...your daughter and the Moor are
making the beast with two backs.

47
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,008
Thou art a villain.

48
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:17,413
You are a senator.

49
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:20,882
This thou shalt answer, Roderigo.

50
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:22,183
Ay, sir!

51
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:24,318
I will answer anything.

52
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:27,394
But I beseech you,
straight satisfy yourself:

53
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:31,026
If she be in her chamber
or your house...

54
00:06:31,234 --> 00:06:35,728
...let loose on me the justice
of the state for thus deluding you.

55
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:40,173
Strike on the tinder, ho!

56
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:43,505
Give me a taper!
Call up all my people!

57
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:49,080
This accident is not unlike my dream.

58
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,820
Belief of it oppresses me already.

59
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:54,453
Light, I say!

60
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:56,057
Light!

61
00:06:57,961 --> 00:07:00,122
Get weapons, ho!

62
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:04,396
Farewell, for I must leave you.

63
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:25,478
The goodness of the night
upon you, friends.

64
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:31,222
I pray you, sir,
are you fast married?

65
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,656
Sir, you've been hotly called for.

66
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:39,427
Have with you.

67
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:56,411
- Halt!
- You!

68
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:02,591
IKeep up your bright swords,
for the dew will rust them.

69
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,958
O, thou foul thief!

70
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:09,358
Where hast thou stowed my daughter?

71
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:12,194
Damned as thou art,
thou hast enchanted her...

72
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:17,271
...to run from her garden to the sooty
bosom of such a thing as thou.

73
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,575
Lay hold upon him.

74
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:26,544
Hold your hands...

75
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:29,374
...both you of my inclining
and the rest.

76
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:36,056
Were it my cue to fight, I should have
known it without a prompter.

77
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:39,495
Good signor...

78
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,660
...where will you that I go
to answer this, your charge?

79
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,231
To prison...

80
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:47,767
...till fit time of law and course of
direct session call thee to answer.

81
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:49,996
What if I do obey?

82
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,800
How may the Duke
be therewith satisfied...

83
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,469
...whose messengers are
here about my side to bring me to him?

84
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:59,474
'Tis true,
most worthy signor.

85
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:02,776
The Duke's in council, and your
noble self, surely, is sent for.

86
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:06,114
How? The Duke in council?
In this time of night?

87
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,321
Bring him away.

88
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,907
Valiant Othello...

89
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:36,016
...we must straight employ you
against the general Turkish foe.

90
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:39,052
Welcome, gentle signor.

91
00:09:39,255 --> 00:09:42,156
We lacked your counsel
and your help tonight.

92
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:43,848
So did I yours.

93
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:46,019
Good Your Grace, pardon me.

94
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:48,754
Neither my place,
nor aught I heard of business...

95
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:51,092
...has raised me from my bed.

96
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:53,298
My daughter!

97
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:55,863
O, my daughter!

98
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:57,004
Dead?

99
00:09:57,507 --> 00:10:01,204
She is abused,
stolen from me and corrupted.

100
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:06,615
For nature so preposterously to err,
sans witchcraft could not.

101
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:11,216
Whoever he be
that in this foul proceeding...

102
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:16,358
...hath thus beguiled your daughter
of herself, and you of her...

103
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:20,322
...the bloody book of law you
shall yourself read...

104
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,660
...in the bitter letter after
your own sense.

105
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:29,401
Humbly, I thank Your Grace.

106
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:40,910
Here is the man.

107
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:46,917
Othello?

108
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:49,717
What in your own part can you
say to this?

109
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:52,417
Nothing, but this is so.

110
00:10:58,935 --> 00:11:03,872
Most potent, grave
and reverend signors...

111
00:11:04,974 --> 00:11:08,307
...my very noble
and approved good masters...

112
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:12,539
...that I have taken away this
old man's daughter...

113
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:15,616
...'tis most true.
True, I have married her.

114
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:20,382
The very head and front of my offending
hath this extent, no more.

115
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:23,083
Rude am I in my speech...

116
00:11:23,293 --> 00:11:28,060
...and little blessed
with the soft phrase of peace.

117
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:31,392
For since these arms of mine
had seven years' pith...

118
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:33,569
...till now some nine moons wasted...

119
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,933
...they have used their dearest action
in the tented field.

120
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,041
And little of this great world
can I speak...

121
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:43,679
...more than pertains to feats
of broil and battle.

122
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:46,711
Therefore, little shall I
grace my cause...

123
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:51,114
...in speaking of myself.
Yet, by your gracious patience...

124
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:55,553
...I will a round,
unvarnished tale deliver...

125
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:58,191
...of my whole course of love:

126
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:01,761
What drugs, what charms...

127
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:06,265
...what conjuration
and what mighty magic...

128
00:12:06,469 --> 00:12:11,202
- for such proceedings am I
charged withal... I won his daughter.

129
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,204
A maiden never bold...

130
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:17,004
...of spirit so still and quiet
that her motion blushed at herself...

131
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:19,681
...and she, in spite of nature,
to fall in love...

132
00:12:19,882 --> 00:12:21,782
...with what she feared to look on!

133
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:23,976
I do beseech you, send for the lady...

134
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:26,417
...and let her speak of me
before her father.

135
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:29,091
If you do find me foul in her report...

136
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:33,058
...the trust, the office I do hold
of you, not only take away...

137
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:36,824
...but let your sentence even
fall upon my life.

138
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:41,703
Fetch Desdemona.

139
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:54,840
Her father loved me...

140
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:57,049
...oft invited me...

141
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,183
...still questioned me the story
of my life from year to year...

142
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:05,760
...the battles, sieges, fortunes
that I have passed.

143
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:08,226
Even from my boyish days...

144
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:10,194
...to the moment
he bade me tell it.

145
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,732
Wherein I spoke of
most disastrous chances...

146
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:15,335
...of moving accidents by
flood and field...

147
00:13:15,538 --> 00:13:18,837
...hair-breadth escapes
in the imminent deadly breach...

148
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:22,068
...of being taken by the insolent foe...

149
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:24,803
...and sold to slavery.

150
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:27,574
And of the cannibals that
each other eat...

151
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:29,547
...the Anthropophagi...

152
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:33,153
...and men whose heads do grow
beneath their shoulders.

153
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:36,723
These things to hear
would Desdemona seriously incline.

154
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:41,863
And with a greedy ear
devour up my discourse...

155
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:44,063
...which I observing...

156
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:46,628
...took once a pliant hour...

157
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:50,101
...and found means to draw
from her a prayer of earnest heart...

158
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:52,934
...which I would
all my pilgrimage dilate.

159
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:56,302
She gave me for my pains...

160
00:13:57,747 --> 00:13:59,681
...a world of sighs.

161
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:03,181
She swore, in faith, 'twas strange...

162
00:14:03,386 --> 00:14:06,685
...'twas passing strange,
'twas pitiful...

163
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,948
...'twas wondrous pitiful.

164
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:15,158
She loved me
for the dangers I had passed...

165
00:14:15,365 --> 00:14:18,334
...and I loved her
that she did pity them.

166
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:23,035
This only is
the witchcraft I have used.

167
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:38,785
Come hither, gentle mistress.

168
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:45,626
Do you perceive in all this company
where most you owe obedience?

169
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:50,389
My noble father...

170
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,027
...to you I am bound
for life and education.

171
00:14:55,671 --> 00:15:00,404
My life and education both
do learn me how to respect you.

172
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,511
You are lord of all my duty.

173
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:06,545
I am hitherto your daughter.

174
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:09,809
But here's my husband.

175
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,447
And so much duty
as my mother showed to you...

176
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:18,991
...preferring you before her father...

177
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:23,598
...so much I challenge
that I may profess due to the Moor...

178
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,358
...my lord.

179
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:35,240
God by you! I have done.

180
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,145
I had rather to adopt a child
than get it.

181
00:15:43,753 --> 00:15:45,448
Come hither, Moor.

182
00:15:49,926 --> 00:15:52,724
I here do give thee that
with all my heart...

183
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:55,523
...which, but thou hast already...

184
00:15:55,731 --> 00:16:00,668
...with all my heart I would
keep from thee.

185
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:17,249
I humbly beseech you, proceed
with the affairs of state.

186
00:16:23,226 --> 00:16:28,163
The Turk, with a mighty preparation,
makes for Cyprus.

187
00:16:28,397 --> 00:16:29,659
Othello...

188
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:32,064
...you must away tonight.

189
00:16:32,268 --> 00:16:35,795
The affair cries haste,
and speed must answer it.

190
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:39,407
Most gracious Duke...

191
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:49,981
What would you, Desdemona?

192
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:55,657
That I did love the Moor
to live with him...

193
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:59,419
...my downright violence
and scorn of fortunes...

194
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:01,722
...may trumpet to the world.

195
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:07,335
My heart is subdued even to
the utmost pleasure of my lord.

196
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:14,409
I saw Othello's visage in his mind...

197
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:18,076
...and to his honors
and his valiant parts...

198
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:21,614
...did I my soul
and fortunes consecrate.

199
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:26,785
So that, dear lords...

200
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:31,923
...if I be left behind, a moth of peace,
and he go to the war...

201
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:35,461
...the rites for which I love him
are bereft me.

202
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:39,157
And I, a heavy interim,
shall support by his dear absence.

203
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:41,029
Let me go with him.

204
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,335
Let her have your voice.

205
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:45,404
And heaven defend your good souls...

206
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:50,409
...that you think I will your serious
business scant for she is with me.

207
00:17:53,182 --> 00:17:55,844
Be it as you shall privately determine.

208
00:17:57,386 --> 00:18:01,652
At 9 in the morning,
here we'll meet again.

209
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,983
Good night to everyone.

210
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:08,487
And, noble signor...

211
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:13,858
...if virtue no delighted beauty lack...

212
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,803
...your son-in-law
is far more fair than black.

213
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:27,882
Look to her, Moor,
if thou hast eyes to see.

214
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:32,850
She has deceived her father
and may thee.

215
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,422
My life upon her faith!

216
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:43,462
Good Iago, my Desdemona
must I leave to thee.

217
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:47,625
Let thy wife attend on her, and bring
them after in the best advantage.

218
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:50,328
Come, we must obey the time.

219
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:03,210
Iago!

220
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:09,017
What sayest thou, noble heart?

221
00:19:12,495 --> 00:19:14,725
What will I do, thinkest thou?

222
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:16,960
Why, go to bed and sleep.

223
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,333
I will incontinently drown myself.

224
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:23,801
If thou dost,
I shall never love thee after.

225
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:26,270
Why, thou silly gentleman!

226
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:31,412
It is silliness to live
when to live is a torment.

227
00:19:32,248 --> 00:19:34,045
Desdemona!

228
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,742
Villainous!

229
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:43,618
I've looked upon the world for
four times seven years...

230
00:19:43,826 --> 00:19:47,523
...and I never yet found a man that
knew how to love himself.

231
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,598
Ere I would say I would drown myself
for the love of a guinea hen...

232
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:55,897
...l'd change my humanity with a baboon.
- What should I do?

233
00:19:56,472 --> 00:19:58,906
I confess it is my shame
to be so fond...

234
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:01,372
...but it is not in my virtue
to amend it.

235
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,010
Virtue? A fig.

236
00:20:03,212 --> 00:20:05,544
'Tis in ourselves
that we are thus or thus.

237
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:08,649
We have reason
to cool our raging motions...

238
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:11,615
...our carnal stings, our
unbitted lusts...

239
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:15,086
...whereof I take this, which you call
love, to be a sect or scion.

240
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:16,451
It cannot be!

241
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:20,561
It is merely a lust of the blood
and a permission of the will.

242
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:22,230
Come, be a man!

243
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:24,695
Drown thyself?

244
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:28,193
Drown cats and blind puppies.

245
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:33,239
I have professed me thy friend
and I confess me...

246
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:36,275
...knit to thy deserving with cables
of perdurable toughness.

247
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,074
I could never
better stead thee than now.

248
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:46,787
Put money in thy purse.

249
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,053
Follow thou these wars.

250
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:55,193
Disguise thy features with
an usurped beard.

251
00:20:55,397 --> 00:20:57,126
I say, put money in thy purse.

252
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,064
It cannot be that Desdemona should
long continue her love to the Moor.

253
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,238
Put but money in thy purse.

254
00:21:03,439 --> 00:21:06,408
When she's sated with his body,
she'll find the error of her choice.

255
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:09,271
She must have change, she must.

256
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:11,970
Fill thy purse with money.

257
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:16,174
If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian...

258
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:19,980
...and a super-subtle Venetian
be not too hard for my wits...

259
00:21:20,189 --> 00:21:21,816
...and all the tribe of hell...

260
00:21:22,024 --> 00:21:25,118
...thou shall enjoy her.

261
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,454
Therefore, put...

262
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,130
"Money in thy purse."

263
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,795
A pox on drowning, huh?

264
00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:35,436
'Tis clean out of the way.

265
00:21:35,638 --> 00:21:38,334
Seek thou rather to be hanged
in compassing thy joy...

266
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,975
...than to be drowned
and go without her.

267
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:48,443
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes?

268
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:51,211
Thou art sure of me.

269
00:21:51,453 --> 00:21:55,981
There are many events in
the womb of time...

270
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,952
...which will be delivered.

271
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,561
Go, provide thy money.

272
00:22:02,998 --> 00:22:05,296
We will have more of this tomorrow.
Adieu.

273
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:07,435
Where shall we meet in the morning?

274
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,595
- At my lodging.
- All right.

275
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:13,675
- I'll be with thee betimes.
- Go to, farewell.

276
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,036
Does thou hear?

277
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:16,211
What say thou?

278
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:18,505
No more of drowning, do you hear?

279
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:19,738
I am changed.

280
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:26,446
Go to, farewell.
Put money enough in your purse!

281
00:22:26,655 --> 00:22:28,555
I'll sell all my land.

282
00:22:31,427 --> 00:22:34,225
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.

283
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,126
For I mine own gained knowledge
should profane...

284
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,166
...if I would time
expend with such a snipe...

285
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:42,860
...but for my sport and profit.

286
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,947
I hate the Moor...

287
00:22:54,617 --> 00:22:57,484
...and it is thought abroad that
'twixt my sheets...

288
00:22:57,686 --> 00:23:02,055
...he's done my office.

289
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:04,419
I know not if it be true...

290
00:23:04,627 --> 00:23:08,859
...but I, for mere suspicion
in that kind...

291
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:14,569
...will do as if for surety.

292
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,540
He holds me well...

293
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:24,807
...the better shall my purpose
work on him.

294
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:30,181
Cassio's a proper man.

295
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:34,287
Let me see now...
To get his place...

296
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:39,393
...and to plume up my will
in double knavery...

297
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:41,388
How?

298
00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:45,597
How?

299
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,069
I have it.

300
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,348
It is engendered.

301
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,510
Hell and night...

302
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:08,156
...must bring this monstrous birth
to the world's light.

303
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:28,562
- Hail to thee, lady.
- Thank you, valiant Cassio.

304
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:42,180
Very good.
Ay, well said, whisper.

305
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,888
With as little a web as this,
will I ensnare...

306
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:51,048
...as great a fly as Cassio.

307
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:13,911
O, my fair warrior!

308
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:17,275
My dear Othello!

309
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:22,249
It gives me wonder great as my content
to see you here before me.

310
00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:31,098
O my soul's joy!

311
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:34,959
I cannot speak enough of this content.
It stops me here.

312
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,730
It is too much of joy.

313
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:49,107
News, friends:

314
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:52,287
Our wars are done,
the Turks are drowned!

315
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,620
This desperate storm
hath seen a grievous wrack...

316
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,228
...and sufferance
on most part of their fleet.

317
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:03,921
Worthy Montano.

318
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:07,434
How does my old acquaintance
of this isle?

319
00:27:07,636 --> 00:27:10,127
Honey, you shall be
well desired in Cyprus.

320
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,773
I have found great love amongst them.

321
00:27:13,642 --> 00:27:16,668
O, you are well tuned now!

322
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:21,782
But I'll set down the pegs that
make this music, as honest as I am.

323
00:28:41,697 --> 00:28:45,155
If thou be'st valiant... as they say
base men being in love have then...

324
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:49,269
...a nobility in their nature
more than is native to them... list me.

325
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:53,199
The lieutenant tonight watches
on the court of guard.

326
00:28:53,742 --> 00:28:55,869
First, I must tell thee this:

327
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:58,975
Desdemona is directly in love with him.

328
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:00,977
With Cassio?

329
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:03,277
Why, 'tis not possible!

330
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:06,215
Lay thy finger thus,
and let thy soul be instructed.

331
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:08,286
Mark me. Her eye must be fed.

332
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,720
What delight shall she have
to look on the devil?

333
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:13,759
Her delicate tenderness has
found itself abused...

334
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:18,126
...begun to heave the gorge,
disrelish and abhor the Moor.

335
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:21,666
Her nature instructs her to it,
and compels her to some second choice.

336
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,306
I cannot believe that.
She is full of most blessed condition.

337
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:27,065
Blessed fig's-end!

338
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:29,602
The wine she drinks is made of grapes.

339
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:33,778
If she were blessed, she would never
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding.

340
00:29:34,082 --> 00:29:36,550
Didst thou not see her paddle
with his hand?

341
00:29:36,752 --> 00:29:38,117
Didst thou not mark that?

342
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,778
- But that was but courtesy.
- Lechery, by this hand...

343
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:45,920
...an index and obscure prologue...

344
00:29:46,128 --> 00:29:48,653
...to the history
of lust and foul thoughts.

345
00:29:48,864 --> 00:29:52,391
They met so near with their lips
that their breaths embraced together.

346
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,296
Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!

347
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:57,267
When these mutualities
so marshal the way...

348
00:29:57,472 --> 00:29:59,372
...hard at hand comes the master...

349
00:29:59,574 --> 00:30:02,134
...and main exercise,
the incorporate conclusion.

350
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:05,905
But sir, be you ruled by me.
I have brought you from Venice.

351
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:11,143
Watch you with the guard tonight...

352
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:14,754
...for the command I'll lay it upon you.
I'll not be far from you.

353
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,693
Do you find some occasion
to anger Cassio.

354
00:30:21,763 --> 00:30:22,593
Well...

355
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:32,430
Welcome, Iago.
We must to the watch.

356
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:35,906
Not this hour, lieutenant.
'Tis not yet 10 of the clock.

357
00:30:36,111 --> 00:30:38,978
Our general cast us thus early for
the love of his Desdemona...

358
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:40,944
...who let us not therefore blame.

359
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:42,810
He hath not yet...

360
00:30:43,018 --> 00:30:46,647
...made wanton the night with her,
and she is sport for Jove.

361
00:30:46,855 --> 00:30:48,516
She's a most exquisite lady.

362
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,784
And I'll warrant her, full of game.

363
00:30:51,993 --> 00:30:53,824
She is indeed perfection.

364
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:55,155
Well...

365
00:30:55,364 --> 00:30:56,922
...happiness to their sheets!

366
00:30:57,132 --> 00:30:58,895
Come, I have a stoop of wine...

367
00:30:59,101 --> 00:31:01,262
...and here without are
a brace of Cyprus gallants...

368
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,563
...that would have a measure to
the health of black Othello.

369
00:31:03,772 --> 00:31:05,239
Not tonight, good Iago.

370
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,499
I have very poor and unhappy
brains for drinking.

371
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:10,041
I could well wish courtesy
would invent...

372
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:12,440
...some other custom of entertainment.

373
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:16,310
They are our friends.

374
00:31:17,552 --> 00:31:19,452
But one cup?
I'll drink for you.

375
00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:23,249
I have drunk a cup tonight already and
dare not task my weakness with anymore.

376
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:26,052
What, man!
'Tis a night of revels.

377
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:28,422
The gallants desire it.

378
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:32,298
Where are they?

379
00:31:36,204 --> 00:31:39,196
If I can fasten
but one cup upon him...

380
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:17,275
The purchase made...

381
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:20,781
...the fruits are to ensue...

382
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:25,552
...that profit's yet to come
between me and you.

383
00:33:47,302 --> 00:33:49,532
Is your Englishman so expert
in his drinking?

384
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,707
Why, he drinks you with facility,
your Dane dead drunk.

385
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:55,035
He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.

386
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:59,111
And he gives your Hollander a vomit
ere the next pottle can be filled.

387
00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:00,713
Health to our general!

388
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,146
I am for it, lieutenant...

389
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:06,010
...and I'll do you justice.

390
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,199
Sweet England!

391
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:32,337
Save you, friend Cassio.

392
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:35,015
Well, how is it with you, most fair?

393
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,880
Bianca.

394
00:34:42,223 --> 00:34:45,090
Let be gallantly!

395
00:34:48,363 --> 00:34:52,163
He was a wight of high renown

396
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:56,025
And thou art but of low degree

397
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:02,067
'Tis pride that pulls the country down

398
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:06,310
Then take thine auld cloak...

399
00:35:06,514 --> 00:35:09,108
...about thee

400
00:35:14,356 --> 00:35:16,221
Let's have no more of this.

401
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:17,982
Let's to our affairs.

402
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:21,452
God forgive us our sins.

403
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,024
Gentlemen, let's look to our business.

404
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:29,799
Do not think, gentlemen,
that I am drunk.

405
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,869
This is my ensign.

406
00:35:33,074 --> 00:35:34,837
This is my right hand.

407
00:35:35,744 --> 00:35:37,302
This is my left hand.

408
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:40,738
I am not drunk now.

409
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,975
I can stand well enough...

410
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:45,686
...and I speak well enough.

411
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:47,582
- Excellent well.
- Why, very well.

412
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:52,256
You must not think then
that I am drunk.

413
00:35:56,831 --> 00:35:59,664
To the platform, masters.
Come, let's set the watch.

414
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:02,166
You see this fellow that is gone before?

415
00:36:02,804 --> 00:36:06,900
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
and give direction.

416
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,369
And do but see his vice.

417
00:36:09,611 --> 00:36:11,511
But is he often thus?

418
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,115
'Tis evermore the prologue
to his sleep.

419
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:21,488
- What's the matter, lieutenant?
- A knave teach me my duty!

420
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,783
I'll beat the knave
into a twiggen bottle.

421
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:26,620
- Beat me!
- Dost thou prate, rogue?

422
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:29,056
Nay, good lieutenant.

423
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:33,030
I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

424
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:37,499
Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you
over the mazzard.

425
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:40,939
Come, come...

426
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:42,609
...you're drunk.

427
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:50,775
Drunk?

428
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:54,815
Nay, good lieutenant.

429
00:36:56,558 --> 00:36:57,718
God's will, gentlemen!

430
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,699
Good lieutenant, hold!

431
00:37:07,902 --> 00:37:09,870
Mutiny!

432
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:12,030
Mutiny!

433
00:37:21,216 --> 00:37:22,376
Help, ho! Lieutenant!

434
00:37:31,025 --> 00:37:32,458
God's will, lieutenant.
Hold!

435
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,220
Hold, for your lives!

436
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,556
Hold, for shame!

437
00:37:36,765 --> 00:37:38,630
What's the matter here?!

438
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,698
Are we turned Turks?!

439
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:44,927
For Christian shame,
put by this barbarous brawl.

440
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,341
He who stirs next
to carve for his own rage...

441
00:37:48,543 --> 00:37:49,908
...holds his soul light.

442
00:37:50,111 --> 00:37:52,944
He dies upon his motion.

443
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:57,540
What is the matter, masters?

444
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,780
Michael...

445
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:02,489
...how comes it you are thus forgot?

446
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,287
I pray you, pardon me, sir!

447
00:38:08,029 --> 00:38:09,656
I cannot speak.

448
00:38:12,967 --> 00:38:14,594
Worthy Montano...

449
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:19,802
...what is the matter that
you unlace your reputation thus...

450
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:23,273
...and spend your rich opinion for
the name of a night-brawler?

451
00:38:23,478 --> 00:38:28,279
- Give me answer to it.
- Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.

452
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:31,577
Your officer, Iago, can inform you,
while I spare speech...

453
00:38:31,786 --> 00:38:34,118
...of all that I do know.

454
00:38:43,298 --> 00:38:47,462
Now, by heaven, my blood begins
my safer guides to rule.

455
00:38:47,669 --> 00:38:51,730
On thy love I charge thee, Iago.
Who began it?

456
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,204
If partially affined or
leagued in office...

457
00:38:54,409 --> 00:38:57,606
...thou dost deliver more
or less than truth...

458
00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:59,712
...thou art no soldier.

459
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:02,849
Touch me not so near!
I had rather cut this tongue...

460
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:05,315
...than it should do offense
to Michael Cassio.

461
00:39:08,423 --> 00:39:10,721
Yet to speak the truth
shall nothing wrong him.

462
00:39:10,925 --> 00:39:12,392
This it is, general:

463
00:39:12,961 --> 00:39:15,896
Montano and myself being in speech,
comes a fellow crying for help...

464
00:39:16,097 --> 00:39:19,965
...and Cassio following him with
determined sword to execute upon him.

465
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:23,135
Sir, this gentleman steps in
to Cassio...

466
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:36,510
- but more of this matter
can I not report.

467
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:45,356
But men are men.
The best sometime forget.

468
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,653
Though Cassio did
some little wrong to him...

469
00:39:47,862 --> 00:39:50,558
...as men in rage strike those
that wish them best...

470
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:51,697
...yet surely Cassio...

471
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,360
I know, Iago, thy honesty and love
doth mince this matter...

472
00:39:56,571 --> 00:39:59,506
...making it light to Cassio.

473
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:19,818
Cassio...

474
00:40:22,997 --> 00:40:27,093
...he that you hurt
is of great fame in Cyprus...

475
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:30,199
...and great affinity.

476
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:32,905
I love thee...

477
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:37,400
...but nevermore be officer of mine.

478
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:39,337
What is the matter, dear?

479
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:42,515
Look, if my gentle love
be not raised up.

480
00:40:42,717 --> 00:40:45,015
I'll make thee an example.

481
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:48,916
All's well now, sweeting.
Come away to bed.

482
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:50,852
Look with care about the town...

483
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:53,755
...and silence those
whom this vile brawl distracted.

484
00:40:53,962 --> 00:40:55,930
Come, sweet Desdemona.

485
00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:12,073
- Are you hurt, lieutenant?
- Ay, past all surgery.

486
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,443
- Marry, God forbid!
- I have lost my reputation.

487
00:41:16,084 --> 00:41:18,678
I have lost the immortal
part of myself...

488
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:21,446
...and what remains is bestial.

489
00:41:21,656 --> 00:41:23,851
My reputation, Iago!

490
00:41:24,058 --> 00:41:24,956
My reputation!

491
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:27,093
I thought you'd received some wound.

492
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:30,059
There's more offense in that
than in reputation.

493
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,633
What, man! There are ways
to recover the general again.

494
00:41:35,837 --> 00:41:37,361
You are but now cast in his mood...

495
00:41:37,572 --> 00:41:39,767
...a punishment more in policy
than in malice.

496
00:41:39,974 --> 00:41:41,566
Sue to him again, and he's yours.

497
00:41:41,776 --> 00:41:43,403
I would rather sue to be despised...

498
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:45,442
...than to deceive
so good a commander...

499
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:49,514
...with so slight, so drunken and
so indiscreet an officer.

500
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:51,048
He that you followed...

501
00:41:51,252 --> 00:41:53,686
...what had he done to you?
- I know not.

502
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:54,718
Is it possible?

503
00:41:54,922 --> 00:41:55,752
Drunk!

504
00:41:55,957 --> 00:41:58,687
Wine is a good
familiar creature, if it be well used.

505
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:01,259
Exclaim no more against it.

506
00:42:01,462 --> 00:42:04,659
And good lieutenant...

507
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:08,159
...I think you think I love you.

508
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:11,570
I have well approved it, sir.

509
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,833
I'll tell you what you shall do.

510
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:18,245
Our general's wife is now the general.

511
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,742
Confess yourself freely to Desdemona.

512
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:25,282
Importune her. She'll help
to put you in your place again.

513
00:42:25,486 --> 00:42:28,353
This broken joint
between you and her husband...

514
00:42:28,556 --> 00:42:30,319
...entreat her to splinter.

515
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:33,892
And my fortunes
against any lay worth naming...

516
00:42:34,095 --> 00:42:38,498
...this crack of your love shall
grow stronger than it was before.

517
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:41,828
You advise me well.

518
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,864
I protest, in the sincerity of love
and honest kindness.

519
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:47,939
I think it freely.

520
00:42:54,315 --> 00:42:56,112
Good night, lieutenant.

521
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:58,342
I must to the watch.

522
00:42:58,686 --> 00:43:01,086
Good night, honest Iago.

523
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:08,125
How am I then a villain...

524
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:10,854
...when this advice is free I give
and honest...

525
00:43:11,065 --> 00:43:15,001
...probal to thinking, and indeed
the course to win the Moor again?

526
00:43:15,203 --> 00:43:19,606
His soul is so enfettered
to Desdemona's love...

527
00:43:19,807 --> 00:43:23,402
...that she may make, unmake,
do what she list...

528
00:43:23,611 --> 00:43:27,638
...even as her appetite shall
play the god with his weak function.

529
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:30,249
How am I then a villain
to counsel Cassio...

530
00:43:30,451 --> 00:43:33,477
...to this parallel course,
directed to his good?

531
00:43:34,288 --> 00:43:36,950
Divinity of hell!

532
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:41,819
When devils will the blackest sins
put on, they do suggest at first...

533
00:43:42,029 --> 00:43:44,361
...with heavenly shows, as I do now.

534
00:43:44,565 --> 00:43:49,195
For whiles this honest fool plies
Desdemona to repair his fortunes...

535
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:52,566
...and she for him
pleads strongly to the Moor...

536
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:55,241
...l'll pour this pestilence
into his ear...

537
00:43:55,443 --> 00:43:59,277
...that she repeals him for
her body's lust...

538
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,506
...and by how much she strives
to do him good...

539
00:44:02,717 --> 00:44:07,120
...she shall undo her credit
with the Moor.

540
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,885
So will I turn her virtue...

541
00:44:18,299 --> 00:44:20,096
...into pitch.

542
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:23,564
And out of her own goodness...

543
00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:25,796
...make the net...

544
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:27,941
...that shall...

545
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:30,007
...enmesh them all.

546
00:44:34,615 --> 00:44:36,480
How now, Roderigo?

547
00:44:37,018 --> 00:44:39,714
I do follow here in the chase...

548
00:44:39,954 --> 00:44:42,718
...not like a hound that hunts...

549
00:44:42,924 --> 00:44:45,722
...but one that fills up the cry.

550
00:44:46,194 --> 00:44:48,822
My money is almost spent.

551
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:52,966
I have been tonight
exceedingly well-cudgeled.

552
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:56,928
And I think the issue will be...

553
00:44:57,138 --> 00:45:00,369
...that I shall have
so much experience for my pains.

554
00:45:00,575 --> 00:45:01,940
And so...

555
00:45:02,677 --> 00:45:06,545
...with no money at all and
a little more wit...

556
00:45:07,882 --> 00:45:10,316
...return again to Venice.

557
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:14,884
How poor are they
that have not patience.

558
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:19,519
What wound did ever heal
but by degrees?

559
00:45:20,094 --> 00:45:22,619
Thou knowest we work by wit...

560
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,695
...and not by witchcraft.

561
00:45:24,899 --> 00:45:28,164
And wit depends on dilatory time.

562
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:30,631
Does it not go well?

563
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:34,764
Cassio hath beaten thee.

564
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:40,947
And thou, by that small hurt...

565
00:45:41,148 --> 00:45:44,276
...hath cashiered Cassio.

566
00:45:48,356 --> 00:45:50,256
Content thyself awhile.

567
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:03,468
By the mass, 'tis morning.

568
00:46:03,904 --> 00:46:07,271
Pleasure and action
make the hours seem short.

569
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:09,399
Retire thee awhile.

570
00:46:12,413 --> 00:46:14,074
Away, I say.

571
00:46:14,582 --> 00:46:16,880
Thou shalt know more hereafter.

572
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:20,382
Nay, get thee gone.

573
00:46:38,139 --> 00:46:39,401
Bounteous madam...

574
00:46:39,607 --> 00:46:41,598
...whatever shall become of
Michael Cassio?

575
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:45,438
- He's never anything but your servant.
- I know it.

576
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,142
I thank you.

577
00:46:48,482 --> 00:46:49,779
Madam, here comes my lord.

578
00:46:53,187 --> 00:46:56,054
- I like not that.
- What dost thou say?

579
00:46:56,624 --> 00:46:57,591
Nothing, my lord.

580
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:00,654
- Madam, I take my leave.
- Farewell.

581
00:47:03,464 --> 00:47:05,489
Was not that Cassio
parted from my wife?

582
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:06,632
Cassio, my lord.

583
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:10,800
How now, my lord?

584
00:47:11,372 --> 00:47:13,840
I have been talking with
a suitor here...

585
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,100
...a man that languishes in
your displeasure.

586
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,800
Who is it you mean?

587
00:47:18,012 --> 00:47:20,037
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.

588
00:47:20,514 --> 00:47:23,142
Good my lord, if he be not one
that truly loves you...

589
00:47:23,351 --> 00:47:26,013
...I have no judgment in an honest face.

590
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:43,636
Excellent wretch!

591
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:48,004
Perdition catch my soul,
but I do love thee!

592
00:47:50,311 --> 00:47:52,506
And when I love thee not...

593
00:47:53,481 --> 00:47:55,506
...chaos is come again.

594
00:47:57,118 --> 00:48:00,110
- My noble lord...
- What dost thou say, Iago?

595
00:48:00,321 --> 00:48:03,722
Did Cassio, when you wooed
my lady, know of your love?

596
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:05,755
He did, from first to last.

597
00:48:10,531 --> 00:48:12,158
Why dost thou ask?

598
00:48:12,366 --> 00:48:15,699
But for a satisfaction of my thought...
No further harm.

599
00:48:20,908 --> 00:48:23,308
Why of thy thought, Iago?

600
00:48:23,577 --> 00:48:26,045
I did not think he had been
acquainted with her.

601
00:48:26,247 --> 00:48:27,612
O, yes.

602
00:48:28,482 --> 00:48:30,109
And went between us very oft.

603
00:48:30,317 --> 00:48:32,080
- Indeed!
- Indeed?

604
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,149
Ay, indeed.

605
00:48:35,389 --> 00:48:37,789
Discernest thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

606
00:48:37,992 --> 00:48:39,289
Honest, my lord?

607
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,250
Honest? Ay, honest.

608
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:43,324
My lord, for aught I know.

609
00:48:43,531 --> 00:48:45,396
- What dost thou think?
- Think, my lord?

610
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,261
"Think, my lord"!
By heaven, he echoes me.

611
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:50,061
Thou dost mean something.

612
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:53,240
If thou dost love me,
show me thy thought.

613
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:57,833
- My lord, you know I love you.
- I think thou dost.

614
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:00,679
And for I know
thou art full of love...

615
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:02,280
...and honesty...

616
00:49:02,783 --> 00:49:05,547
...and weighest thy words
before thou givest them breath.

617
00:49:05,753 --> 00:49:08,449
Therefore, these stops of thine
fright me the more.

618
00:49:08,656 --> 00:49:11,489
For Cassio, I dare be sworn
I think that he is honest.

619
00:49:12,092 --> 00:49:13,320
I think so too.

620
00:49:13,527 --> 00:49:14,960
Men should be what they seem.

621
00:49:15,162 --> 00:49:17,596
Or those that be not,
would they might seem none.

622
00:49:17,798 --> 00:49:19,561
Certain, men should be
what they seem.

623
00:49:19,767 --> 00:49:22,235
Why then, I think Cassio's
an honest man.

624
00:49:22,436 --> 00:49:24,199
Nay, yet there's more in this!

625
00:49:24,405 --> 00:49:26,669
I prithee, speak to me as to
thy thinkings.

626
00:49:26,874 --> 00:49:30,435
As thou dost ruminate, give thy
worst of thoughts the worst of words.

627
00:49:30,644 --> 00:49:32,509
I do beseech you...

628
00:49:33,647 --> 00:49:35,945
Though I perchance am
vicious in my guess...

629
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:40,109
...as I confess, it is my
nature's plague to spy into abuses...

630
00:49:40,321 --> 00:49:42,551
...and oft my jealousy...

631
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:46,224
...shapes faults that are not.

632
00:49:46,961 --> 00:49:49,930
I entreat you then, it were not for
your quiet nor your good...

633
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:55,067
...nor for my manhood, honesty and
wisdom to let you know my thoughts.

634
00:49:55,302 --> 00:49:56,701
What dost thou mean?

635
00:49:57,738 --> 00:50:00,866
Good name in man and woman,
dear my lord...

636
00:50:01,075 --> 00:50:04,442
...is the immediate jewel
of their souls.

637
00:50:04,645 --> 00:50:07,170
Who steals my purse,
steals trash.

638
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:10,475
'Tis something, nothing.
'Twas mine, 'tis his...

639
00:50:10,684 --> 00:50:11,878
...has been slave to thousands.

640
00:50:12,086 --> 00:50:15,180
But he that filches from me
my good name...

641
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:17,857
...robs me of that
which not enriches him...

642
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:20,652
...and makes me poor indeed.

643
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:25,858
By heaven, I'll know thy thought.

644
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,863
You cannot, if my heart
were in your hand.

645
00:50:28,068 --> 00:50:30,935
Nor shall not,
while 'tis in my custody.

646
00:50:32,606 --> 00:50:35,439
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!

647
00:50:35,709 --> 00:50:39,941
'Tis the green-eyed monster
that doth mock the meat it feeds on.

648
00:50:40,548 --> 00:50:41,640
Why?

649
00:50:44,418 --> 00:50:46,113
Why is this?

650
00:50:47,521 --> 00:50:50,979
Thinkest thou I'd make
a life of jealousy...

651
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:55,355
...to follow still the changes of
the moon with fresh suspicions? No!

652
00:50:56,397 --> 00:50:58,991
To be once in doubt
is once to be resolved.

653
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:02,294
Nor from mine own weak merits
shall I draw...

654
00:51:02,503 --> 00:51:07,236
...the smallest fear or doubt of her
revolt, for she had eyes and chose me.

655
00:51:07,441 --> 00:51:08,430
No, Iago...

656
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:13,412
...l'll see before I doubt.
When I doubt, prove.

657
00:51:13,614 --> 00:51:15,639
And on the proof,
there is no more but this:

658
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:18,010
Away at once with love or jealousy.

659
00:51:18,218 --> 00:51:19,845
I am glad, for now I have reason...

660
00:51:20,054 --> 00:51:23,148
...to show the love and duty
that I bear you with franker spirit.

661
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:27,316
Therefore, as I am bound,
receive it from me.

662
00:51:28,228 --> 00:51:30,196
I speak not yet of proof.

663
00:51:36,203 --> 00:51:37,602
Look to your wife.

664
00:51:40,274 --> 00:51:43,539
Observe her well with Cassio.

665
00:51:44,612 --> 00:51:46,136
Look to it.

666
00:51:47,348 --> 00:51:49,509
I know our country disposition well.

667
00:51:49,717 --> 00:51:52,413
In Venice, they do
let heaven see the pranks...

668
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,611
...they dare not show their husbands.

669
00:51:54,822 --> 00:51:57,313
Their best conscience
is not to leave it undone...

670
00:51:57,524 --> 00:51:59,492
...but keep it unknown.

671
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:08,601
- Dost thou say so?
- She did deceive her father.

672
00:52:08,802 --> 00:52:11,464
And when she seemed to fear your looks,
she loved them most.

673
00:52:11,672 --> 00:52:14,232
- And so she did.
- Why, go to then.

674
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,275
But I am much to blame.

675
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:27,443
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
for too much loving you.

676
00:52:27,655 --> 00:52:29,646
I am bound to thee forever.

677
00:52:33,027 --> 00:52:34,619
I see this hath dashed your spirits.

678
00:52:34,828 --> 00:52:37,422
- Not a jot, not a jot.
- In faith, I fear it has.

679
00:52:37,631 --> 00:52:40,122
I hope you consider what is spoke
comes from my love.

680
00:52:40,334 --> 00:52:42,268
But I do see you're moved.

681
00:52:42,469 --> 00:52:45,836
I am to pray you not to strain
my speech to grosser issues...

682
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,167
...nor to larger reach than
to suspicion.

683
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:50,002
Should you do so, my lord...

684
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:53,145
...my speech should fall into vile
success as my thoughts aimed not at.

685
00:52:53,347 --> 00:52:55,941
Cassio's my worthy friend...
My lord, you're moved.

686
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:57,481
No, not much moved!

687
00:52:57,685 --> 00:52:59,550
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

688
00:52:59,753 --> 00:53:02,813
Long live she so.
And long live you to think so.

689
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:07,015
And yet, how nature erring from itself...

690
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:08,956
Ay, there's the point!

691
00:53:09,163 --> 00:53:11,529
As to be bold not to enter
into a marriage...

692
00:53:11,732 --> 00:53:14,326
...of her own clime, complexion
and degree...

693
00:53:14,535 --> 00:53:18,471
...whereto we see in all things
nature tends...

694
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:21,399
One may smell in such
a will most rank...

695
00:53:21,608 --> 00:53:25,510
...foul disproportion,
thoughts unnatural.

696
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:43,059
But pardon me. I do not in position
distinctly speak of her.

697
00:53:43,263 --> 00:53:47,825
Though I may fear, her will,
recoiling to her better judgment...

698
00:53:48,035 --> 00:53:51,266
...may fall to match you with
her country forms...

699
00:53:51,472 --> 00:53:53,463
...and happily repent.

700
00:53:55,142 --> 00:53:56,769
Farewell, farewell.

701
00:53:56,977 --> 00:54:00,435
If more thou dost perceive,
let me know more.

702
00:54:00,948 --> 00:54:02,347
Leave me, Iago.

703
00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:04,574
My lord, I take my leave.

704
00:54:10,724 --> 00:54:12,624
Why did I marry?

705
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:16,652
My lord, I would
I might entreat your honor...

706
00:54:16,864 --> 00:54:19,128
...to scan this thing no farther.

707
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:20,322
Leave it to time.

708
00:54:21,468 --> 00:54:23,368
Let me be thought too busy
in my fears...

709
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:26,596
- as worthy cause
I have to fear I am...

710
00:54:27,074 --> 00:54:29,065
- and hold her free.

711
00:54:29,443 --> 00:54:30,876
Fear not my government.

712
00:54:38,385 --> 00:54:42,446
That we can call
these delicate creatures ours...

713
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:45,324
...and not their appetites!

714
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:25,525
How now, my dear Othello!

715
00:55:25,766 --> 00:55:28,564
Your dinner and the generous
islanders by you invited...

716
00:55:28,769 --> 00:55:30,964
...do attend your presence.

717
00:55:31,605 --> 00:55:35,336
- I am to blame.
- Why do you speak so faintly?

718
00:55:38,478 --> 00:55:40,070
Are you not well?

719
00:55:50,123 --> 00:55:53,251
Come, I'll go with you.

720
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,870
I have a thing for you.

721
00:56:48,081 --> 00:56:51,482
You have a thing for me?

722
00:56:52,085 --> 00:56:55,782
It is a common thing
to have a foolish wife.

723
00:56:55,989 --> 00:56:57,581
O, is that all?

724
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,051
What will you give me for
that handkerchief?

725
00:57:02,262 --> 00:57:03,889
What handkerchief?

726
00:57:04,298 --> 00:57:06,027
What handkerchief?

727
00:57:06,967 --> 00:57:11,904
Why, that the Moor
first gave to Desdemona...

728
00:57:12,973 --> 00:57:16,602
...that which so often you did
bid me steal.

729
00:57:17,511 --> 00:57:21,811
Hast stolen it from her?

730
00:57:22,015 --> 00:57:23,004
No, faith.

731
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:26,008
She let it drop by negligence.

732
00:57:41,134 --> 00:57:43,762
What will you do with it,
that you've been so earnest...

733
00:57:43,971 --> 00:57:45,632
...to have me filch it?

734
00:57:59,486 --> 00:58:01,681
Trifles light as air...

735
00:58:01,888 --> 00:58:06,825
...are to the jealous confirmations
strong as proofs of holy writ.

736
00:58:08,395 --> 00:58:10,090
This may do something.

737
00:58:50,737 --> 00:58:53,137
My life upon her faith.

738
00:59:00,981 --> 00:59:03,347
If she be false...

739
00:59:03,817 --> 00:59:05,944
...heaven mocks itself.

740
00:59:08,722 --> 00:59:10,553
I'll not believe it.

741
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:15,251
Look to her, Moor,
if thou hast eyes to see.

742
00:59:15,729 --> 00:59:18,562
She has deceived her father...

743
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:20,528
...and may thee.

744
00:59:45,492 --> 00:59:47,892
The Moor already changes
with my poison.

745
00:59:48,662 --> 00:59:52,291
Dangerous conceits
are in their natures, poisons.

746
00:59:52,499 --> 00:59:56,663
Which at the first
are scarce found to distaste.

747
00:59:56,870 --> 01:00:00,567
But with a little
act upon the blood...

748
01:00:00,774 --> 01:00:04,733
...burn like the mines of sulfur.

749
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:07,677
I did say so.

750
01:00:08,248 --> 01:00:09,237
Look!

751
01:00:11,551 --> 01:00:14,384
Not poppy, nor mandragora...

752
01:00:14,588 --> 01:00:16,419
...nor all the drowsy syrups
of the world...

753
01:00:16,623 --> 01:00:19,148
...shall ever medicine thee
to that sweet sleep...

754
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:21,919
...which thou owedst yesterday.

755
01:00:23,763 --> 01:00:25,731
Why, how now, general!

756
01:00:27,801 --> 01:00:28,995
Avaunt!

757
01:00:29,836 --> 01:00:31,098
Be gone!

758
01:00:31,771 --> 01:00:34,001
Thou hast set me on the rack.

759
01:00:34,207 --> 01:00:37,973
I swear 'tis better to be much abused
than but to know it a little.

760
01:00:38,178 --> 01:00:39,338
How now, my lord!

761
01:00:39,546 --> 01:00:42,447
What sense had I
of her stolen hours of lust?

762
01:00:42,649 --> 01:00:46,745
I saw it not, thought it not,
it harmed not me.

763
01:00:46,953 --> 01:00:49,012
I found not Cassio's kisses
on her lips.

764
01:00:49,222 --> 01:00:50,746
I am sorry to hear this.

765
01:00:50,957 --> 01:00:53,482
I had been happy if the general camp,
pioneers and all...

766
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:56,161
...had tasted her sweet body,
so I had nothing known.

767
01:00:56,363 --> 01:01:00,356
Now forever farewell the tranquil mind!

768
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:01,966
Farewell content!

769
01:01:02,235 --> 01:01:05,261
Farewell the plumed troop and
wars that make ambition virtue.

770
01:01:05,472 --> 01:01:06,962
O, farewell!

771
01:01:07,174 --> 01:01:09,642
Othello's occupation's gone.

772
01:01:09,843 --> 01:01:10,935
Is it possible, my lord?

773
01:01:11,144 --> 01:01:14,705
Villain, be sure
thou prove my love a whore!

774
01:01:14,915 --> 01:01:15,939
Be sure of it.

775
01:01:16,149 --> 01:01:18,014
Give me the ocular proof...

776
01:01:18,218 --> 01:01:20,516
...or by the worth
of mine eternal soul...

777
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,280
...thou hadst been better
been born a dog...

778
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:25,685
...than answer my waked wrath!

779
01:01:25,892 --> 01:01:27,587
Make me to see it...

780
01:01:27,794 --> 01:01:29,489
...or at least, so prove it...

781
01:01:29,696 --> 01:01:32,164
...that the probation bear no hinge...

782
01:01:32,365 --> 01:01:34,196
...nor loop to hang a doubt on...

783
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:36,392
...or woe upon thy life!
- My noble lord!

784
01:01:36,603 --> 01:01:40,403
If thou dost slander her
and torture me...

785
01:01:40,607 --> 01:01:43,701
...never pray more,
abandon all remorse!

786
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,401
On horror's head, horrors accumulate!

787
01:01:46,613 --> 01:01:48,444
Do deeds to make heaven weep...

788
01:01:48,648 --> 01:01:53,017
...for nothing to damnation
canst thou add greater than that!

789
01:01:55,989 --> 01:01:57,513
O grace!

790
01:02:00,427 --> 01:02:02,657
O heaven defend me!

791
01:02:03,964 --> 01:02:06,558
God buy you!
Take mine office.

792
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:09,735
To be direct and honest is not safe.

793
01:02:10,003 --> 01:02:13,769
I thank you for this profit.
From hence, I'll love no friend...

794
01:02:13,974 --> 01:02:16,340
...sith love breeds such offense!

795
01:02:18,645 --> 01:02:20,579
Nay, stay!

796
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,771
- Thou shouldst be honest.
- I should be wise...

797
01:02:22,983 --> 01:02:26,180
...for honesty's a fool,
and loses that it works for.

798
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,050
By the world,
I think my wife be honest...

799
01:02:29,256 --> 01:02:31,281
...and I think that she is not.

800
01:02:31,491 --> 01:02:33,459
I think that thou art just
and that thou art not.

801
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,823
I'll have some proof.
Would I were satisfied!

802
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:42,863
I see, sir,
you are eaten up with passion.

803
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:45,560
I do repent me that I put it to you.

804
01:02:46,172 --> 01:02:48,299
- You would be satisfied?
- Would? Nay, I will.

805
01:02:48,508 --> 01:02:50,601
And may. But how?
How satisfied?

806
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:53,506
Would you grossly gape on?
Behold her topped?

807
01:02:53,713 --> 01:02:55,078
O, death and damnation!

808
01:02:55,282 --> 01:02:57,512
It were a tedious difficulty
to bring them to that prospect.

809
01:02:57,717 --> 01:02:59,241
Damn them then!
What shall I say?

810
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:01,181
Where's satisfaction?

811
01:03:01,488 --> 01:03:02,750
You would not see this...

812
01:03:02,956 --> 01:03:05,390
...were they as prime as goats,
as hot as monkeys...

813
01:03:05,592 --> 01:03:08,823
But yet, I say, if imputation
and strong circumstances...

814
01:03:09,029 --> 01:03:12,795
...which lead directly to the door of
truth will give you satisfaction...

815
01:03:12,999 --> 01:03:14,660
...you might have it.

816
01:03:15,502 --> 01:03:18,733
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

817
01:03:18,938 --> 01:03:21,031
I do not like the office.

818
01:03:21,241 --> 01:03:23,209
But sith I am entered in this cause...

819
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:27,210
...pricked to it by foolish honesty
and love, I will go on.

820
01:03:30,283 --> 01:03:32,376
I lay with Cassio lately.

821
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:36,544
And being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.

822
01:03:36,756 --> 01:03:38,917
There are a kind of men
so loose of soul...

823
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:41,457
...that in their sleeps will
mutter their affairs.

824
01:03:41,661 --> 01:03:43,993
One of this kind is Cassio.

825
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:47,598
In sleep, I heard him say:

826
01:03:48,435 --> 01:03:52,462
"Sweet Desdemona, let us be wary,
let us hide our loves."

827
01:03:53,139 --> 01:03:56,802
And then, sir, would he grip
and wring my hand...

828
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:59,205
...cry, "Sweet creature!"
And then kiss me hard...

829
01:03:59,412 --> 01:04:02,643
...as if he plucked kisses from
the roots upon my lips...

830
01:04:02,849 --> 01:04:04,817
...then laid his leg over my thigh...

831
01:04:05,018 --> 01:04:07,316
...and sighed and kissed
and cried:

832
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,954
"Cursed fate
that gave thee to the Moor!"

833
01:04:10,156 --> 01:04:12,283
- O monstrous!
- Nay, this was but his dream.

834
01:04:12,492 --> 01:04:14,016
- Monstrous!
- Nay, yet be wise...

835
01:04:14,227 --> 01:04:16,058
...yet we see nothing done.

836
01:04:16,262 --> 01:04:18,526
She may be honest yet.
Tell me but this:

837
01:04:18,732 --> 01:04:20,324
Did you not see
a handkerchief...

838
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:22,592
...spotted with strawberries
in your wife's hand?

839
01:04:22,802 --> 01:04:25,168
I gave her such a one.
'Twas my first gift.

840
01:04:25,372 --> 01:04:27,567
I know not that.
But such a handkerchief...

841
01:04:27,774 --> 01:04:29,332
...l'm sure it was your wife's...

842
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:32,670
...did I today see
Cassio wipe his beard with.

843
01:04:32,879 --> 01:04:34,813
O, if it be that...

844
01:04:57,003 --> 01:04:59,130
Where should I lose
that handkerchief, Emilia?

845
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:00,306
I know not, madam.

846
01:05:00,507 --> 01:05:04,967
Believe me, I had rather lose
my purse full of crusadoes.

847
01:05:06,045 --> 01:05:08,240
And, but my noble Moor
is true of mind...

848
01:05:08,448 --> 01:05:11,940
...and made of no such baseness as
jealous creatures are...

849
01:05:12,152 --> 01:05:14,882
...it were enough
to put him to ill thinking.

850
01:05:15,088 --> 01:05:17,386
- Is he not jealous?
- Who, he?

851
01:05:24,497 --> 01:05:26,089
How is it with you, my lord?

852
01:05:26,933 --> 01:05:27,957
Well.

853
01:05:28,568 --> 01:05:31,867
- And how do you, my lady?
- Well, my good lord.

854
01:05:32,372 --> 01:05:36,672
That handkerchief did an Egyptian
to my mother give.

855
01:05:36,876 --> 01:05:41,040
She was a charmer and could almost
read the thoughts of people.

856
01:05:41,247 --> 01:05:44,239
She told her while she kept it,
'twould make her amiable...

857
01:05:44,451 --> 01:05:47,181
...and subdue my father entirely
to her love.

858
01:05:47,387 --> 01:05:50,823
But if she lost it
or made a gift of it...

859
01:05:51,024 --> 01:05:53,959
...my father's eye
should hold her loathed...

860
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,822
...and his spirits should hunt
after new fancies.

861
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:58,520
She dying...

862
01:05:59,265 --> 01:06:00,698
...gave it me...

863
01:06:01,134 --> 01:06:04,865
...and bid me, when my fate would
have me wived...

864
01:06:05,071 --> 01:06:06,265
...I give it her.

865
01:06:06,473 --> 01:06:07,997
I did so.

866
01:06:08,475 --> 01:06:10,443
And take heed on it.

867
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:14,302
Make it a darling
like your precious eye.

868
01:06:14,981 --> 01:06:17,575
To lose it or give it away...

869
01:06:17,784 --> 01:06:22,016
...were such perdition
as nothing else could match.

870
01:06:22,388 --> 01:06:23,787
Is it possible?

871
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:25,617
'Tis true.

872
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:27,990
There's magic in the web of it.

873
01:06:28,294 --> 01:06:30,785
Then would to God I had never seen it!

874
01:06:30,997 --> 01:06:32,123
Wherefore?

875
01:06:32,332 --> 01:06:34,095
Why do you speak
so startingly and rash?

876
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,291
Is it lost? Is it gone?
Is it out of the way?

877
01:06:36,503 --> 01:06:38,027
Heaven bless us!

878
01:06:38,238 --> 01:06:39,705
- Say you?
- It is not lost.

879
01:06:39,906 --> 01:06:41,601
- But what an if it were?
- How?

880
01:06:41,808 --> 01:06:43,571
I say it is not lost!

881
01:06:43,977 --> 01:06:46,002
Fetch it.
Let me see it.

882
01:06:46,212 --> 01:06:49,409
Why, so I can, sir.
But I will not now.

883
01:06:49,616 --> 01:06:51,846
This is a trick
to put me from my suit.

884
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:54,952
I pray you,
let Cassio be received again.

885
01:06:55,154 --> 01:06:57,179
Fetch me my handkerchief.
My mind misgives.

886
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,984
Come. You'll never meet
a more sufficient man.

887
01:07:00,193 --> 01:07:02,661
- The handkerchief!
- I pray you, talk me of Cassio...

888
01:07:02,862 --> 01:07:06,127
...a man that all his time hath founded
his good fortunes on your love.

889
01:07:06,332 --> 01:07:08,459
The handkerchief!

890
01:07:08,701 --> 01:07:10,601
In faith, you are to blame.

891
01:07:13,439 --> 01:07:15,373
'Zounds!

892
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:25,840
Is not this man jealous?

893
01:07:26,853 --> 01:07:28,980
I never saw this before.

894
01:07:29,322 --> 01:07:32,155
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.

895
01:07:35,194 --> 01:07:38,595
They are all but stomachs,
and we all but food.

896
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:41,858
They eat us hungrily.
And when they are full...

897
01:07:42,068 --> 01:07:43,126
...they belch us.

898
01:07:48,775 --> 01:07:51,039
If I give my wife a handkerchief...

899
01:07:51,244 --> 01:07:52,734
...'tis hers, and being hers...

900
01:07:52,946 --> 01:07:55,039
...she may, I think,
bestow it on any man.

901
01:07:55,248 --> 01:07:58,513
What if I had said
I had seen him do you wrong?

902
01:07:59,285 --> 01:08:00,513
Or heard him say...

903
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,312
Hath he said anything?

904
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:05,189
He hath, my lord.
But no more than he'll unswear.

905
01:08:05,391 --> 01:08:08,554
- What hath he said?
- Faith, that he...

906
01:08:09,562 --> 01:08:10,620
...did...

907
01:08:15,568 --> 01:08:18,560
I know not what he did.

908
01:08:21,541 --> 01:08:22,508
What?

909
01:08:24,711 --> 01:08:25,803
What?

910
01:08:28,381 --> 01:08:29,643
Lie...

911
01:08:30,717 --> 01:08:31,979
With her?

912
01:08:32,885 --> 01:08:34,113
With her...

913
01:08:35,922 --> 01:08:38,356
...on her, what you will.

914
01:08:41,794 --> 01:08:43,591
Lie with her?

915
01:08:53,106 --> 01:08:54,903
Lie on her?

916
01:08:56,976 --> 01:08:59,171
'Zounds, that's fulsome!

917
01:09:43,122 --> 01:09:46,114
Work on, my medicine. Work!

918
01:09:48,161 --> 01:09:50,994
Thus credulous fools are caught.

919
01:09:51,197 --> 01:09:54,894
And many worthy and chaste dames,
even thus...

920
01:09:55,101 --> 01:09:58,764
...all guiltless, meet reproach.

921
01:10:03,242 --> 01:10:05,107
What ho, my lord?

922
01:10:05,545 --> 01:10:06,978
My lord, I say! Othello!

923
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:08,738
What's the matter?

924
01:10:09,482 --> 01:10:10,881
My lord is in an epilepsy.

925
01:10:11,084 --> 01:10:13,075
This is his second fit.
He had one yesterday.

926
01:10:13,286 --> 01:10:15,220
- Rub him about the temples.
- Forbear!

927
01:10:15,421 --> 01:10:17,719
The lethargy
must have his quiet course.

928
01:10:17,924 --> 01:10:20,984
If not, he foams at mouth and
breaks out to savage madness.

929
01:10:21,194 --> 01:10:24,459
Look, he stirs.
Do you withdraw yourself a little.

930
01:10:24,664 --> 01:10:26,393
He will recover straight.

931
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:30,968
When he is gone, I would
on great occasion speak with you.

932
01:10:33,172 --> 01:10:35,197
How is it, general?

933
01:10:37,143 --> 01:10:39,008
Did he confess it?

934
01:10:42,715 --> 01:10:46,151
Have you not hurt your head?

935
01:10:46,753 --> 01:10:48,186
Dost thou mock me?

936
01:10:48,654 --> 01:10:50,349
I mock you?

937
01:10:51,624 --> 01:10:52,648
No, by heaven.

938
01:10:53,726 --> 01:10:57,958
Good sir, whilst you were here,
overwhelmed with your grief...

939
01:10:58,164 --> 01:10:59,358
...Cassio came hither.

940
01:10:59,565 --> 01:11:01,760
I shifted him away and
laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy...

941
01:11:01,968 --> 01:11:06,029
...bade him anon return and here speak
with me, the which he promised.

942
01:11:06,606 --> 01:11:09,598
Do but encave yourself...

943
01:11:10,943 --> 01:11:14,003
...and mark the jeers, the gibes,
and notable scorns...

944
01:11:14,213 --> 01:11:16,340
...that dwell in
every region of his face.

945
01:11:16,549 --> 01:11:18,540
I will make him tell
the tale anew:

946
01:11:18,751 --> 01:11:21,948
Where, how, how oft,
how long ago...

947
01:11:22,155 --> 01:11:26,558
...and when he hath and is again
to cope your wife.

948
01:11:26,759 --> 01:11:29,489
Marry, patience!

949
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:34,327
Now, will I question Cassio of Bianca.

950
01:11:34,534 --> 01:11:36,559
He, when he hears of her...

951
01:11:36,769 --> 01:11:39,135
...cannot refrain
from the excess of laughter.

952
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:41,465
How do you now, lieutenant?

953
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:43,408
As he shall smile...

954
01:11:43,609 --> 01:11:45,474
...Othello...

955
01:11:45,878 --> 01:11:47,243
...shall go mad.

956
01:11:47,446 --> 01:11:50,074
You give me that same title,
whose want even kills me.

957
01:11:50,283 --> 01:11:53,775
Ply Desdemona well
and you are sure on it.

958
01:11:53,986 --> 01:11:58,923
Now, if this suit
lay in Bianca's power...

959
01:11:59,425 --> 01:12:01,757
...how quickly should you speed!

960
01:12:01,961 --> 01:12:04,691
Poor wretch!
I think, in faith, she loves me.

961
01:12:06,098 --> 01:12:07,759
Look how he laughs already!

962
01:12:07,967 --> 01:12:11,095
She says that you shall
marry her. Do you intend it?

963
01:12:11,304 --> 01:12:12,862
I marry her? What?

964
01:12:13,773 --> 01:12:15,536
I prithee, bear
some charity to my wit.

965
01:12:15,741 --> 01:12:19,472
The cry goes that
you shall marry her.

966
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,375
- Prithee, say true.
- I am a very villain else.

967
01:12:22,949 --> 01:12:25,281
This is the monkey's own giving out.

968
01:12:25,484 --> 01:12:29,011
She hangs and lolls and weeps upon me.
So hales...

969
01:12:29,222 --> 01:12:32,350
I see that nose of yours...

970
01:12:32,558 --> 01:12:35,118
...but not that
dog I shall throw it to!

971
01:12:36,329 --> 01:12:39,526
Before me!
Look, where she comes.

972
01:12:40,967 --> 01:12:45,028
How is it with you,
most fair Bianca?

973
01:12:45,671 --> 01:12:47,662
Whence came this?

974
01:12:48,841 --> 01:12:51,435
This is some token from
a newer friend.

975
01:12:51,644 --> 01:12:52,702
No, by my faith.

976
01:12:52,912 --> 01:12:54,004
Why, whose is it?

977
01:12:54,213 --> 01:12:57,046
I know not.
I found it in my chamber.

978
01:12:57,717 --> 01:13:00,709
A likely story that you should
find it in your chamber...

979
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:02,615
...and not know who left it.

980
01:13:02,822 --> 01:13:04,517
This is some minx's token.

981
01:13:05,291 --> 01:13:06,315
There!

982
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:10,193
Give it to your hobbyhorse,
wheresoever you had it.

983
01:13:10,396 --> 01:13:13,331
How now, my sweet Bianca!

984
01:13:14,233 --> 01:13:16,633
How now, how now!

985
01:13:19,171 --> 01:13:23,073
If you come to
supper tonight, you may.

986
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:28,071
If you do not, come
when you are next prepared for.

987
01:13:28,681 --> 01:13:30,774
After her, after her.

988
01:13:30,983 --> 01:13:33,451
Faith, I must.
She'll rail in the streets else.

989
01:13:33,653 --> 01:13:35,678
- Will you sup there?
- I intend to.

990
01:13:35,888 --> 01:13:38,755
I may chance to see you, for
I would fain speak with you.

991
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:42,018
- Prithee, come.
- Go to, say no more.

992
01:13:54,607 --> 01:13:57,804
How shall I murder him, Iago?

993
01:13:58,177 --> 01:14:01,203
Did you perceive
how he laughed at his vice?

994
01:14:03,749 --> 01:14:07,185
And did you see the handkerchief?

995
01:14:12,024 --> 01:14:13,218
Damn her!

996
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,518
Lewd minx!

997
01:14:15,861 --> 01:14:17,294
Damn her!

998
01:14:18,798 --> 01:14:20,766
A fine woman, a fair woman,
a sweet woman!

999
01:14:20,967 --> 01:14:21,956
You must forget that.

1000
01:14:22,168 --> 01:14:25,763
Let her perish, and be damned tonight,
for she shall not live.

1001
01:14:25,972 --> 01:14:28,133
No, my heart is turned to stone.

1002
01:14:28,341 --> 01:14:31,401
I strike it,
and it hurts my hand.

1003
01:14:32,078 --> 01:14:35,878
But the pity of it, Iago!
O, Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

1004
01:14:36,082 --> 01:14:37,549
Nay, that's not your way.

1005
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:39,081
Damn her!

1006
01:14:39,785 --> 01:14:42,117
- Cuckold me?
- O, 'tis foul in her.

1007
01:14:42,321 --> 01:14:45,484
- And with mine officer!
- That's fouler.

1008
01:14:45,691 --> 01:14:48,660
I'd have him nine years a-killing.

1009
01:14:54,033 --> 01:14:56,126
Look here, Iago.

1010
01:14:56,335 --> 01:14:59,429
All my fond love thus...

1011
01:15:01,107 --> 01:15:04,873
...do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.

1012
01:15:07,947 --> 01:15:11,383
Arise, black vengeance, from
thy hollow cell.

1013
01:15:11,584 --> 01:15:15,714
Yield up, O love, thy crown
and hearted throne to tyrannous hate.

1014
01:15:17,223 --> 01:15:20,954
Now, by yond marble heaven...

1015
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:24,186
...in the due reverence
of a sacred vow...

1016
01:15:24,397 --> 01:15:26,297
...I here engage my words.

1017
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:33,967
Witness, you ever-burning
lights above...

1018
01:15:34,173 --> 01:15:36,835
...you elements
that clip us round about.

1019
01:15:37,043 --> 01:15:40,137
Witness that here, Iago doth give up...

1020
01:15:40,346 --> 01:15:43,782
...the execution of his wit, hands...

1021
01:15:44,383 --> 01:15:45,441
...heart...

1022
01:15:45,885 --> 01:15:48,353
...to wronged Othello's service.

1023
01:15:48,721 --> 01:15:50,484
Let him command.

1024
01:15:50,689 --> 01:15:53,180
And to obey shall be
in me remorse...

1025
01:15:53,392 --> 01:15:55,826
...what bloody business ever.

1026
01:16:14,713 --> 01:16:16,806
I greet thy love.

1027
01:16:20,653 --> 01:16:22,621
Get me some poison,
Iago, this night.

1028
01:16:22,822 --> 01:16:24,790
I'll not expostulate with her...

1029
01:16:24,990 --> 01:16:27,857
...lest her body and beauty
unprovide my mind again.

1030
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:30,455
Do it not with poison.

1031
01:16:30,663 --> 01:16:35,396
Strangle her in her bed,
even the bed she hath contaminated.

1032
01:16:35,601 --> 01:16:40,095
Good, good, the justice of it pleases.
Very good.

1033
01:16:41,207 --> 01:16:42,196
And for Cassio?

1034
01:16:42,408 --> 01:16:45,434
Let me hear thee say,
Michael Cassio is not alive.

1035
01:16:47,847 --> 01:16:52,341
My friend is dead.
You shall know more by midnight.

1036
01:16:52,751 --> 01:16:54,241
Excellent. Good.

1037
01:16:55,354 --> 01:16:57,413
Now art thou my lieutenant.

1038
01:17:05,097 --> 01:17:07,497
I am your own...

1039
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,199
...forever.

1040
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:19,377
God save you, worthy general!

1041
01:17:20,045 --> 01:17:21,137
With all my heart, sir.

1042
01:17:21,347 --> 01:17:23,781
The Duke and Senators
of Venice greet you.

1043
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:28,716
I kiss the instrument of their pleasure.
Welcome, Signor Gratiano.

1044
01:17:39,965 --> 01:17:41,125
What's the news, uncle?

1045
01:17:43,235 --> 01:17:45,703
Good cousin Lodovico?

1046
01:17:47,506 --> 01:17:49,030
I am glad to see you, signor.

1047
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:51,801
- Welcome to Cyprus.
- I thank you.

1048
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:53,137
How does Lieutenant Cassio?

1049
01:17:55,948 --> 01:17:57,609
Lives, sir.

1050
01:17:57,917 --> 01:17:59,214
Cousin...

1051
01:17:59,451 --> 01:18:03,785
...there's fallen between him and
my lord an unkind breach.

1052
01:18:04,857 --> 01:18:07,792
- But you shall make all well.
- Are you sure of that?

1053
01:18:07,993 --> 01:18:10,461
- My lord?
- "This fail you not to do..."

1054
01:18:10,829 --> 01:18:13,764
He did not call.
Is there division between my lord...

1055
01:18:13,966 --> 01:18:15,957
...and Cassio?
- A most unhappy one.

1056
01:18:16,168 --> 01:18:19,695
I would do much to atone them,
for the love I bear to Cassio.

1057
01:18:19,905 --> 01:18:21,770
Fire and brimstone!

1058
01:18:21,974 --> 01:18:23,032
My lord?

1059
01:18:23,242 --> 01:18:24,266
Are you wise?

1060
01:18:25,878 --> 01:18:28,312
What? Is he angry?

1061
01:18:28,514 --> 01:18:30,141
Maybe the letter moved him.

1062
01:18:30,349 --> 01:18:33,113
For as I think,
they do command him home...

1063
01:18:33,319 --> 01:18:35,753
...deputing Cassio in his government.

1064
01:18:37,256 --> 01:18:38,848
By my troth, I'm glad on it.

1065
01:18:39,058 --> 01:18:40,320
Indeed!

1066
01:18:43,062 --> 01:18:44,051
My lord?

1067
01:18:44,263 --> 01:18:46,163
I am glad to see you mad.

1068
01:18:46,732 --> 01:18:48,290
Why, sweet Othello?

1069
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,524
Devil!

1070
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:57,036
I have not deserved this.

1071
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:02,440
This would not be believed in Venice,
though I should swear I saw it.

1072
01:19:03,082 --> 01:19:06,313
'Tis very much.
Make her amends. She weeps.

1073
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,281
If that the earth could teem with
women's tears, each drop she falls...

1074
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:12,980
...would prove a crocodile.

1075
01:19:13,192 --> 01:19:14,591
Out of my sight!

1076
01:19:15,327 --> 01:19:17,727
I would not stay to offend you.

1077
01:19:23,602 --> 01:19:25,729
You have seen nothing then?

1078
01:19:26,472 --> 01:19:30,374
- Nor ever heard, nor suspected.
- You've seen Cassio and she together.

1079
01:19:30,576 --> 01:19:34,444
I saw no harm. I heard each syllable
that breath made up between them.

1080
01:19:34,647 --> 01:19:36,740
- What! Did they never whisper?
- Never.

1081
01:19:36,949 --> 01:19:40,248
Nor send you to fetch her fan,
her gloves, her mask, nothing?

1082
01:19:40,452 --> 01:19:41,714
Never.

1083
01:19:42,254 --> 01:19:43,812
That's strange.

1084
01:19:44,023 --> 01:19:48,255
I durst, my lord, to wager she
is honest, lay down my soul at stake.

1085
01:19:49,595 --> 01:19:53,156
If you think other, remove your thought.
It doth abuse your bosom.

1086
01:19:53,365 --> 01:19:54,889
Bid her come hither.

1087
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:56,998
Go!

1088
01:19:59,338 --> 01:20:03,672
She says enough, but she's a simple
bawd that cannot say as much.

1089
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:07,974
This is a subtle whore.

1090
01:20:08,747 --> 01:20:10,078
But look, she comes.

1091
01:20:12,184 --> 01:20:14,118
What is your pleasure?

1092
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,345
Let me see your eyes.

1093
01:20:17,323 --> 01:20:19,120
Look in my face.

1094
01:20:19,725 --> 01:20:22,057
What horrible fancy's this?

1095
01:20:22,261 --> 01:20:24,729
What art thou?

1096
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:27,728
Your wife, my lord.
Your true and loyal wife.

1097
01:20:27,933 --> 01:20:29,798
Come, swear it.

1098
01:20:32,304 --> 01:20:34,238
Damn thyself.

1099
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:36,738
Swear thou art honest.

1100
01:20:40,312 --> 01:20:42,576
Heaven doth truly know it.

1101
01:20:42,981 --> 01:20:46,178
Heaven truly knows
thou art false as hell.

1102
01:20:47,019 --> 01:20:48,850
To whom, my lord?

1103
01:20:50,956 --> 01:20:52,651
With whom?

1104
01:20:53,659 --> 01:20:55,786
How am I false?

1105
01:20:56,462 --> 01:20:57,861
O, Desdemona!

1106
01:20:58,063 --> 01:21:00,122
Away, away!

1107
01:21:02,267 --> 01:21:03,962
Alas the heavy day!

1108
01:21:04,737 --> 01:21:06,068
Why do you weep?

1109
01:21:10,876 --> 01:21:14,277
Am I the motive
of these tears, my lord?

1110
01:21:14,813 --> 01:21:17,611
Had it pleased heaven to
try me with affliction...

1111
01:21:17,816 --> 01:21:21,217
...had they rained all kinds
of sores and shames on my bare head...

1112
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:25,356
...I should have found in some
place of my soul a drop of patience.

1113
01:21:25,557 --> 01:21:28,993
But alas, there, where
I have garnered up my heart...

1114
01:21:29,194 --> 01:21:31,628
...where either I must live
or bear no life...

1115
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:35,994
...the fountain from the which
my current runs or else dries up...

1116
01:21:36,201 --> 01:21:40,934
...to be discarded or keep as a cistern
for foul toads to knot and gender in!

1117
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:42,164
O thou...

1118
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:46,336
...who art so lovely fair...

1119
01:21:47,446 --> 01:21:51,940
...and smells so sweet
that the sense aches at thee.

1120
01:21:54,019 --> 01:21:57,113
Wouldst thou had never been born!

1121
01:21:59,324 --> 01:22:02,487
Alas, what ignorant
sin have I committed?

1122
01:22:02,694 --> 01:22:06,027
Was this fair paper
made to write "whore" upon?

1123
01:22:06,231 --> 01:22:09,792
- What committed! Impudent strumpet!
- By heaven, you do me wrong.

1124
01:22:10,002 --> 01:22:12,334
- Are you not a strumpet?
- I am a Christian!

1125
01:22:12,538 --> 01:22:13,698
What! Not a whore?

1126
01:22:13,906 --> 01:22:16,534
- No, as I shall be saved.
- Is it possible?

1127
01:22:17,276 --> 01:22:19,141
Heaven forgive us!

1128
01:22:20,879 --> 01:22:23,074
I cry you mercy then.

1129
01:22:23,615 --> 01:22:28,382
I took you for that cunning whore of
Venice that married with Othello.

1130
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:32,757
You, mistress...

1131
01:22:33,759 --> 01:22:36,922
...who have the office opposite
St. Peter and keeps the gate of hell!

1132
01:22:39,164 --> 01:22:41,029
You, you, ay, you!

1133
01:22:44,169 --> 01:22:46,364
We have done our course.

1134
01:22:46,605 --> 01:22:50,234
I pray you, turn the key,
and keep our counsel.

1135
01:22:52,744 --> 01:22:54,871
Am I that name, Iago?

1136
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:57,742
What name, fair lady?

1137
01:22:58,016 --> 01:23:00,541
Such as my lord did say I was.

1138
01:23:00,752 --> 01:23:02,549
He called her whore.

1139
01:23:02,955 --> 01:23:04,047
Why did he so?

1140
01:23:04,723 --> 01:23:06,247
I do not know.

1141
01:23:06,892 --> 01:23:09,486
I am sure I am none such.

1142
01:23:10,929 --> 01:23:12,920
Do not weep!

1143
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:14,722
Do not weep.

1144
01:23:14,933 --> 01:23:16,833
Alas the day!

1145
01:23:17,202 --> 01:23:19,500
Hath she forsook
so many noble matches...

1146
01:23:19,705 --> 01:23:22,697
...her father, her country,
her friends to be called whore?

1147
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:25,032
Would it not make one weep?

1148
01:23:29,047 --> 01:23:30,446
It is my wretched fortune.

1149
01:23:31,149 --> 01:23:33,674
O, good Iago...

1150
01:23:34,386 --> 01:23:37,753
...what shall I do to win my lord again?

1151
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:40,185
Good friend...

1152
01:23:41,026 --> 01:23:42,618
...go to him...

1153
01:23:42,995 --> 01:23:47,694
...for by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him.

1154
01:23:50,135 --> 01:23:51,124
Here I kneel:

1155
01:23:57,042 --> 01:24:00,569
If ever my will did trespass
against his love...

1156
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:06,413
...either in discourse
of thought or actual deed...

1157
01:24:07,719 --> 01:24:11,052
...or that mine eyes, mine ears...

1158
01:24:12,157 --> 01:24:16,423
...or any sense, delighted
them in any other form...

1159
01:24:18,297 --> 01:24:20,527
...or that I do not yet...

1160
01:24:20,732 --> 01:24:23,929
...and ever did and ever will...

1161
01:24:25,504 --> 01:24:28,962
...though he do shake me
off to beggarly divorcement...

1162
01:24:29,308 --> 01:24:31,742
...love him dearly...

1163
01:24:32,611 --> 01:24:35,273
...comfort forswear me!

1164
01:24:38,917 --> 01:24:41,579
Unkindness may do much...

1165
01:24:42,554 --> 01:24:45,887
...and his unkindness
may defeat my life...

1166
01:24:46,091 --> 01:24:48,184
...but never taint my love.

1167
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:54,228
I cannot say "whore."

1168
01:24:54,633 --> 01:24:57,659
It does abhor me now
I speak the word.

1169
01:24:58,003 --> 01:25:00,631
To do the act that might
the addition earn...

1170
01:25:00,839 --> 01:25:04,240
...not the world's mass
of vanity could make me!

1171
01:25:04,543 --> 01:25:08,206
I pray you, be content.

1172
01:25:09,181 --> 01:25:10,648
'Tis but his humor:

1173
01:25:10,849 --> 01:25:15,013
The business of the state does him
offense, and he does chide with you.

1174
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:19,723
- If it were no other...
- It is so, I warrant.

1175
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,893
Hark, how these
instruments summon to supper!

1176
01:25:25,097 --> 01:25:28,066
The messengers of Venice stay the meat.

1177
01:25:29,568 --> 01:25:32,833
Go in and weep not.

1178
01:25:33,338 --> 01:25:37,297
All things shall be well.

1179
01:25:53,291 --> 01:25:57,318
- How now, Roderigo?
- Thou deals unjustly with me.

1180
01:25:57,529 --> 01:26:00,464
- What in the contrary?
- Every day thou daffest me.

1181
01:26:00,666 --> 01:26:02,395
I will no longer endure it.

1182
01:26:02,601 --> 01:26:06,799
Nor am I persuaded to put up in
peace what already I've suffered.

1183
01:26:07,005 --> 01:26:10,566
- Will you hear me?
- Your words and performance are not kin.

1184
01:26:10,776 --> 01:26:13,939
- You charge me most unjustly.
- With nought but truth!

1185
01:26:16,915 --> 01:26:20,510
I will make myself known to Desdemona.

1186
01:26:26,291 --> 01:26:29,419
If she will return me my jewels...

1187
01:26:29,628 --> 01:26:33,962
...I will give over my suit
and repent my unlawful solicitation.

1188
01:26:34,433 --> 01:26:35,923
If not...

1189
01:26:37,536 --> 01:26:42,371
...assure yourself, I will seek
satisfaction of you.

1190
01:26:44,743 --> 01:26:46,608
You have said now.

1191
01:26:46,812 --> 01:26:50,407
Ay, and said nothing but what
I protest intendment of doing.

1192
01:26:50,849 --> 01:26:53,750
Why, now I see...

1193
01:26:55,087 --> 01:26:57,021
...there's mettle in thee.

1194
01:26:57,222 --> 01:27:01,090
And even from now do build on thee
a better opinion than before.

1195
01:27:01,293 --> 01:27:03,227
Give me thy hand, Roderigo.

1196
01:27:04,429 --> 01:27:07,660
Thou hast taken against me a just
exception. Yet, I protest...

1197
01:27:07,866 --> 01:27:10,767
...l've dealt most justly in thy affair.
- It's not appeared.

1198
01:27:10,969 --> 01:27:14,564
I grant that and your suspicions
are not without wit and judgment.

1199
01:27:14,773 --> 01:27:17,571
But if thou hast
that in thee indeed...

1200
01:27:17,776 --> 01:27:19,869
...which I have greater reason to
believe now...

1201
01:27:20,078 --> 01:27:24,344
...I mean purpose, courage and valor,
this night show it.

1202
01:27:24,549 --> 01:27:28,986
If thou the next night following
enjoy not Desdemona...

1203
01:27:29,187 --> 01:27:34,090
...take me from this world
and devise engines on my life.

1204
01:27:37,996 --> 01:27:39,293
Well...

1205
01:27:41,833 --> 01:27:43,061
...what is it?

1206
01:27:53,512 --> 01:27:57,972
This is the night that either
makes me or fordoes me quite.

1207
01:28:20,372 --> 01:28:22,499
Trouble yourself no further, sir.

1208
01:28:22,707 --> 01:28:25,801
O, pardon me.
It will do me good to walk.

1209
01:28:26,011 --> 01:28:27,706
Desdemona!

1210
01:28:29,815 --> 01:28:32,943
- My lord?
- Get thee to bed on the instant.

1211
01:28:33,151 --> 01:28:36,120
I shall return forthwith.
Dismiss your attendant there.

1212
01:28:36,621 --> 01:28:38,486
Look it be done.

1213
01:28:39,724 --> 01:28:41,658
I will, my lord.

1214
01:28:44,062 --> 01:28:45,324
Madam, good night.

1215
01:28:45,697 --> 01:28:50,293
- I humbly thank your ladyship.
- Your honor is most welcome.

1216
01:28:50,502 --> 01:28:52,026
Will you walk, sir?

1217
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,607
Dismiss me?

1218
01:28:57,709 --> 01:28:59,301
'Twas his bidding.

1219
01:29:00,345 --> 01:29:01,778
I would you'd never seen him.

1220
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,777
So would not I!

1221
01:29:11,089 --> 01:29:12,147
Prithee...

1222
01:29:12,958 --> 01:29:14,755
...unpin me here.

1223
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:37,006
The poor soul sat sighing

1224
01:29:37,582 --> 01:29:41,382
By a sycamore tree

1225
01:29:45,056 --> 01:29:47,183
My mother had a maid called Barbary.

1226
01:29:47,392 --> 01:29:50,293
She was in love
and he she loved proved mad...

1227
01:29:50,495 --> 01:29:52,463
...and did forsake her.

1228
01:29:53,531 --> 01:29:55,863
She had a song of "Willow."

1229
01:29:56,668 --> 01:30:00,160
An old thing it was,
but it expressed her fortune.

1230
01:30:00,872 --> 01:30:03,306
And she died singing it.

1231
01:30:05,977 --> 01:30:09,140
That song tonight
will not go from my mind.

1232
01:30:10,649 --> 01:30:15,245
The poor soul sat sighing

1233
01:30:15,854 --> 01:30:19,585
By a sycamore tree

1234
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:23,686
Sing willow, willow, willow

1235
01:30:25,563 --> 01:30:28,555
Her hand on her bosom

1236
01:30:28,767 --> 01:30:31,463
Her head on her knee

1237
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:36,072
Sing willow, willow, willow

1238
01:30:40,946 --> 01:30:44,973
Her salt tears fell from her

1239
01:30:46,151 --> 01:30:49,678
And softened the stones

1240
01:30:51,623 --> 01:30:55,286
Sing willow, willow, willow

1241
01:30:58,296 --> 01:31:01,459
So get thee gone, good night.

1242
01:31:03,735 --> 01:31:06,670
Mine eyes do itch.
Does that bode weeping?

1243
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:08,600
'Tis neither here nor there.

1244
01:31:08,974 --> 01:31:11,306
I have heard it said so.

1245
01:31:12,677 --> 01:31:14,144
O, these men...

1246
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:16,408
...these men!

1247
01:31:18,049 --> 01:31:22,611
Dost thou in conscience think,
tell me Emilia, that there be women...

1248
01:31:22,854 --> 01:31:25,755
...do abuse their husbands
in such gross kind?

1249
01:31:25,957 --> 01:31:27,481
There be some, no question.

1250
01:31:27,826 --> 01:31:30,090
Wouldst thou do such a deed?

1251
01:31:30,829 --> 01:31:33,229
- Would not you?
- No, by this heavenly light.

1252
01:31:33,431 --> 01:31:35,296
Nor I by this heavenly light.

1253
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,627
I might do it as well in the dark.

1254
01:31:38,770 --> 01:31:42,228
Wouldst thou do
such a deed for all the world?

1255
01:31:42,774 --> 01:31:46,403
The world's a huge thing.
It is a great price for a small vice.

1256
01:31:46,945 --> 01:31:48,742
I think thou wouldst not.

1257
01:31:48,947 --> 01:31:52,314
I think I should
and undo it again when I'd done it.

1258
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:54,481
For the whole world?

1259
01:31:54,686 --> 01:31:58,952
Who'd not make her husband
a cuckold to make him a monarch?

1260
01:31:59,157 --> 01:32:00,749
I should venture purgatory for it.

1261
01:32:00,959 --> 01:32:03,086
I don't think there
is any such woman.

1262
01:32:03,294 --> 01:32:04,625
Yes...

1263
01:32:06,097 --> 01:32:06,995
...a dozen.

1264
01:32:07,866 --> 01:32:11,233
But I do think it is their
husbands' faults if wives do fall.

1265
01:32:12,203 --> 01:32:14,671
Say that they slack their duties...

1266
01:32:15,407 --> 01:32:18,342
...and pour our treasures
into foreign laps.

1267
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:22,869
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
throwing restraint upon us.

1268
01:32:23,348 --> 01:32:24,713
Or say they strike us.

1269
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,543
Why, we have galls...

1270
01:32:27,786 --> 01:32:31,745
...and though we have some grace,
yet have we some revenge.

1271
01:32:33,058 --> 01:32:37,358
Let husbands know their wives
have sense like them.

1272
01:32:38,163 --> 01:32:39,892
They see and smell...

1273
01:32:40,265 --> 01:32:44,099
...and have their palates both for
sweet and sour as husbands have.

1274
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:48,796
What is it that they do
when they change us for others?

1275
01:32:49,574 --> 01:32:51,371
Is it sport?

1276
01:32:52,243 --> 01:32:53,938
I think it is.

1277
01:32:54,512 --> 01:32:57,003
And doth affection breed it?

1278
01:32:57,849 --> 01:32:59,578
I think it doth.

1279
01:33:00,685 --> 01:33:03,779
Is it frailty that thus errs?

1280
01:33:03,988 --> 01:33:07,014
I think so too.

1281
01:33:07,225 --> 01:33:09,750
And have not we affections...

1282
01:33:09,961 --> 01:33:12,555
...desires for sport,
and frailty as men have?

1283
01:33:13,364 --> 01:33:15,730
Then let them use us well.

1284
01:33:15,934 --> 01:33:20,667
Else let them know the ills we do,
their ills instruct us so.

1285
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:26,840
Good night.

1286
01:33:34,686 --> 01:33:38,144
- Be near at hand, I may miscarry in it.
- Here, at thy hand...

1287
01:33:38,356 --> 01:33:41,655
...be bold, and take thy stand.

1288
01:33:47,899 --> 01:33:51,801
'Tis but a man gone.
Forth my sword, he dies!

1289
01:33:52,403 --> 01:33:55,804
If Cassio do remain, he hath a daily
beauty in his life that makes me ugly.

1290
01:33:56,007 --> 01:33:58,237
Besides, he may unfold me to the Moor...

1291
01:33:58,443 --> 01:34:01,537
...there stand I in much peril.
No, he must die.

1292
01:34:16,327 --> 01:34:17,385
Villain, thou diest!

1293
01:34:24,335 --> 01:34:25,825
Help, ho!

1294
01:34:26,771 --> 01:34:28,295
O villain that I am!

1295
01:34:29,607 --> 01:34:30,801
Murder! Murder!

1296
01:34:34,679 --> 01:34:35,805
Murder!

1297
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:40,544
It is some mischance.
The cry is very direful!

1298
01:34:41,686 --> 01:34:42,948
Help!

1299
01:34:44,189 --> 01:34:45,486
O wretched villain!

1300
01:34:47,659 --> 01:34:48,683
Who's there?

1301
01:34:49,928 --> 01:34:52,624
- Who is this that cries on murder?
- We do not know.

1302
01:34:52,830 --> 01:34:53,819
Did you hear a cry?

1303
01:34:54,032 --> 01:34:56,796
Here, for heaven's sake, help me!

1304
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:00,903
Give me some help.

1305
01:35:01,105 --> 01:35:03,869
O, me, lieutenant!
What villains have done this?

1306
01:35:04,075 --> 01:35:06,771
I think one is hereabout
and cannot make away.

1307
01:35:06,978 --> 01:35:08,502
Treacherous villains!

1308
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:11,505
What are you there?
Come and give some help!

1309
01:35:11,716 --> 01:35:13,843
- O, help me here!
- That's one of them!

1310
01:35:31,002 --> 01:35:34,130
O murderous slave!
O villain!

1311
01:35:40,245 --> 01:35:43,112
O, damned Iago.

1312
01:35:44,882 --> 01:35:46,907
Inhuman dog!

1313
01:35:52,991 --> 01:35:56,984
Where be these bloody thieves?
Ho! Murder! Murder!

1314
01:36:56,621 --> 01:36:58,486
It is the cause...

1315
01:37:00,058 --> 01:37:02,356
...it is the cause, my soul.

1316
01:37:03,728 --> 01:37:07,687
Let me not name it to you,
you chaste stars!

1317
01:37:09,067 --> 01:37:10,796
It is the cause.

1318
01:37:12,637 --> 01:37:14,366
Yet I'll not shed her blood...

1319
01:37:14,572 --> 01:37:17,700
...nor scar that whiter skin of hers
than snow...

1320
01:37:17,942 --> 01:37:20,934
...and smooth as monumental alabaster.

1321
01:37:23,381 --> 01:37:25,076
Yet she must die...

1322
01:37:26,584 --> 01:37:29,485
...else she'll betray more men.

1323
01:37:38,096 --> 01:37:39,893
Put out the light...

1324
01:37:42,867 --> 01:37:44,164
...and then...

1325
01:37:45,103 --> 01:37:46,900
...put out the light.

1326
01:38:01,686 --> 01:38:03,153
Who's there?

1327
01:38:19,337 --> 01:38:23,899
O, balmy breath, that doth almost
persuade justice to break her sword!

1328
01:38:40,892 --> 01:38:45,488
Be thus when thou art dead, and
I will kill thee and love thee after.

1329
01:38:50,334 --> 01:38:52,234
One more...

1330
01:38:54,005 --> 01:38:56,132
...and this the last.

1331
01:38:58,409 --> 01:39:00,969
So sweet was never so fatal.

1332
01:39:24,101 --> 01:39:25,227
Othello?

1333
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:27,394
Ay...

1334
01:39:28,706 --> 01:39:30,003
...Desdemona.

1335
01:39:32,944 --> 01:39:35,037
Will you come to bed, my lord?

1336
01:39:37,515 --> 01:39:41,178
Have you prayed tonight, Desdemona?

1337
01:39:41,686 --> 01:39:42,710
Ay, my lord.

1338
01:39:43,421 --> 01:39:45,252
If you bethink yourself of any crime...

1339
01:39:45,456 --> 01:39:48,118
...unreconciled to heaven,
solicit for it straight.

1340
01:39:48,326 --> 01:39:51,056
Alack, my lord, what
may you mean by that?

1341
01:39:51,262 --> 01:39:55,596
Well, do it and be brief.
I will walk by.

1342
01:39:57,902 --> 01:40:00,029
I'll not kill thy unprepared spirit.

1343
01:40:00,238 --> 01:40:02,365
Heaven forfend! I'll not kill thy soul.

1344
01:40:02,573 --> 01:40:05,098
- Talk you of killing?
- Ay, I do.

1345
01:40:06,043 --> 01:40:08,238
Then heaven...

1346
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:10,914
...have mercy on me.

1347
01:40:11,349 --> 01:40:12,611
Amen...

1348
01:40:13,117 --> 01:40:14,277
...with all my heart!

1349
01:40:14,485 --> 01:40:17,147
If you say so, I hope
you will not kill me.

1350
01:40:18,055 --> 01:40:20,114
And yet I fear you.

1351
01:40:20,658 --> 01:40:22,148
Think on thy sins.

1352
01:40:24,161 --> 01:40:25,685
They are loves I bear to you.

1353
01:40:25,897 --> 01:40:27,194
And for that thou diest.

1354
01:40:27,398 --> 01:40:30,390
That death's unnatural
that kills for loving.

1355
01:40:30,601 --> 01:40:32,831
Peace and be still!

1356
01:40:34,171 --> 01:40:35,468
I will so.

1357
01:40:45,716 --> 01:40:47,149
What's the matter?

1358
01:40:48,653 --> 01:40:52,089
That handkerchief which I gave thee,
thou gave to Cassio.

1359
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:56,226
No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man and ask him.

1360
01:40:56,427 --> 01:41:01,330
Sweet soul, take heed of perjury.
Thou art on thy deathbed.

1361
01:41:01,532 --> 01:41:02,556
But not yet to die.

1362
01:41:02,767 --> 01:41:03,961
Yes, presently!

1363
01:41:05,937 --> 01:41:08,064
Then Lord have mercy on me!

1364
01:41:08,272 --> 01:41:09,204
I say...

1365
01:41:10,241 --> 01:41:11,299
...amen.

1366
01:41:11,509 --> 01:41:13,739
And have you mercy too!

1367
01:41:14,178 --> 01:41:17,341
I never did offend you in my life.
Never loved Cassio...

1368
01:41:17,548 --> 01:41:21,484
...but with such general warranty
of heaven as I might love.

1369
01:41:21,686 --> 01:41:22,710
I never gave him token.

1370
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:26,651
By heaven, I saw my
handkerchief in his hand!

1371
01:41:26,857 --> 01:41:27,881
He found it then.

1372
01:41:28,092 --> 01:41:29,889
I never gave it him.

1373
01:41:30,428 --> 01:41:31,326
Send for him hither.

1374
01:41:31,796 --> 01:41:33,024
Let him confess a truth.

1375
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:35,494
He hath confessed.

1376
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:36,564
What, my lord?

1377
01:41:36,767 --> 01:41:38,564
That he hath used thee.

1378
01:41:38,869 --> 01:41:40,427
How?

1379
01:41:41,872 --> 01:41:45,968
- Unlawfully?
- Ay.

1380
01:41:47,011 --> 01:41:48,911
- He will not say so.
- No...

1381
01:41:49,747 --> 01:41:52,477
...his mouth is stopped.

1382
01:41:53,451 --> 01:41:55,612
Honest Iago hath taken order for it.

1383
01:41:56,954 --> 01:41:58,546
What?

1384
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:00,857
Is he dead?

1385
01:42:02,893 --> 01:42:04,383
Emilia...

1386
01:42:05,229 --> 01:42:08,255
...run and tell my lord and lady
what hath happened.

1387
01:42:15,773 --> 01:42:18,367
Alas, he is betrayed...

1388
01:42:19,176 --> 01:42:21,804
...and I undone.

1389
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:25,276
Out, strumpet!

1390
01:42:25,483 --> 01:42:28,816
Weepest thou for him to my face?

1391
01:42:31,489 --> 01:42:35,357
O banish me, my lord,
but kill me not!

1392
01:42:38,896 --> 01:42:40,693
Down, strumpet!

1393
01:42:40,898 --> 01:42:42,695
IKill me tomorrow.

1394
01:42:49,273 --> 01:42:51,173
Let me live tonight.

1395
01:42:55,946 --> 01:42:56,935
Nay!

1396
01:43:01,719 --> 01:43:03,710
If you strive...

1397
01:43:14,832 --> 01:43:16,459
But half an hour!

1398
01:43:18,636 --> 01:43:21,799
- Being done, there is no pause.
- But while I say one prayer!

1399
01:43:22,006 --> 01:43:23,132
It's too late.

1400
01:44:21,799 --> 01:44:24,199
What? Not dead?

1401
01:44:25,736 --> 01:44:27,465
Not yet quite dead?

1402
01:44:27,671 --> 01:44:30,504
Good my lord, I would
speak a word with you.

1403
01:44:32,409 --> 01:44:34,001
Who's there?

1404
01:44:34,211 --> 01:44:37,908
I do beseech you that I may speak
with you, O, good my lord.

1405
01:44:42,219 --> 01:44:44,084
Yes, Emilia.

1406
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,915
By and by.

1407
01:44:48,159 --> 01:44:52,528
- What is the matter with thee?
- My good lord, yonder's foul murder done.

1408
01:44:52,730 --> 01:44:54,561
- What, now?
- But now, my lord.

1409
01:44:54,765 --> 01:44:56,960
It is the very error of the moon.

1410
01:44:57,168 --> 01:44:59,966
She comes nearer earth than she
was wont and makes men mad.

1411
01:45:00,337 --> 01:45:02,703
Cassio hath killed
a Venetian called Roderigo.

1412
01:45:03,374 --> 01:45:05,171
Roderigo and Cassio killed?

1413
01:45:05,376 --> 01:45:09,244
- No, Cassio's not killed.
- Not Cassio killed!

1414
01:45:09,446 --> 01:45:13,177
Then murder's out of tune,
and sweet revenge grows harsh.

1415
01:45:14,518 --> 01:45:15,815
What cry is that?

1416
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:16,850
That? What?

1417
01:45:17,054 --> 01:45:19,750
Out, and alas,
that was my lady's voice!

1418
01:45:26,697 --> 01:45:28,324
O lady, speak again!

1419
01:45:28,532 --> 01:45:31,626
Sweet Desdemona!
O sweet mistress, speak!

1420
01:45:45,883 --> 01:45:47,976
O, who has done this deed?

1421
01:45:49,286 --> 01:45:50,617
'Twas I that killed her.

1422
01:45:53,324 --> 01:45:55,451
She turned to folly
and she was a whore.

1423
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:58,226
Thou dost belie her
and thou art a devil.

1424
01:45:58,429 --> 01:46:00,693
She was false as water.

1425
01:46:00,898 --> 01:46:04,959
Thou art rash as fire to say that she
was false. She was heavenly true!

1426
01:46:05,169 --> 01:46:08,434
Cassio did top her!
Ask thy husband else.

1427
01:46:08,839 --> 01:46:11,774
I were damned beneath hell,
but that I did proceed...

1428
01:46:11,976 --> 01:46:14,501
...justly to this extremity.
Thy husband knew.

1429
01:46:14,845 --> 01:46:17,040
- My husband?
- Thy husband.

1430
01:46:17,281 --> 01:46:18,441
That she was false?

1431
01:46:18,649 --> 01:46:20,617
With Cassio.
Nay, had she been true...

1432
01:46:20,818 --> 01:46:23,116
- My husband?
- Ay, 'twas he that told me.

1433
01:46:23,320 --> 01:46:25,220
An honest man who hates the slime...

1434
01:46:25,456 --> 01:46:28,186
...that sticks on filthy deeds.
- My husband?

1435
01:46:28,392 --> 01:46:31,259
What needs this iterance, woman?
I say thy husband!

1436
01:46:31,462 --> 01:46:35,831
If he say so, may his pernicious
soul rot half a grain a day!

1437
01:46:36,033 --> 01:46:38,194
He lies to the heart.

1438
01:46:38,702 --> 01:46:40,932
She was too fond
of her filthy bargain.

1439
01:46:41,138 --> 01:46:42,036
Do thy worst.

1440
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:45,936
This deed of thine is no more worthy
heaven than thou wast worthy her.

1441
01:46:46,143 --> 01:46:48,236
Help! Murder!

1442
01:46:49,013 --> 01:46:49,843
Peace...

1443
01:46:50,414 --> 01:46:51,642
...you were best.

1444
01:46:51,849 --> 01:46:54,977
Thou hast not half the power to
harm me as I have to be hurt.

1445
01:46:55,219 --> 01:46:56,584
O gull!

1446
01:46:56,787 --> 01:47:01,724
O dolt! As ignorant as dirt!
Thou hast done a deed.

1447
01:47:02,293 --> 01:47:04,022
I care not for thy sword.

1448
01:47:04,228 --> 01:47:07,664
I'll make thee known
though I lost twenty lives.

1449
01:47:07,865 --> 01:47:09,628
Help! Help!

1450
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:12,427
The Moor hath killed my mistress!

1451
01:47:12,636 --> 01:47:14,934
Murder! Murder!

1452
01:47:15,639 --> 01:47:16,628
Murder!

1453
01:47:17,408 --> 01:47:18,773
How now, general?

1454
01:47:18,976 --> 01:47:20,671
Who cries of murder?

1455
01:47:22,579 --> 01:47:24,103
O, are you come, Iago?

1456
01:47:24,315 --> 01:47:27,182
You've done well, that men lay
their murders on your neck.

1457
01:47:27,384 --> 01:47:29,511
Disprove this villain,
if thou be a man.

1458
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:32,280
He says thou toldest him
that his wife is false.

1459
01:47:32,489 --> 01:47:36,220
Thou art not such a villain.
Speak, for my heart is full.

1460
01:47:36,427 --> 01:47:37,985
I told him what I thought...

1461
01:47:38,195 --> 01:47:41,653
...and told no more than what he
found himself was apt and true.

1462
01:47:41,865 --> 01:47:44,834
- But did you tell him she was false?
- I did.

1463
01:47:45,035 --> 01:47:46,764
You told a lie...

1464
01:47:47,104 --> 01:47:50,631
...an odious, damned lie.
Upon my a soul, a lie, a wicked lie!

1465
01:47:50,841 --> 01:47:52,775
She false with Cassio?
Did you say...?

1466
01:47:52,977 --> 01:47:54,877
With Cassio.
Go to, charm your tongue.

1467
01:47:55,245 --> 01:47:58,237
I will not charm my tongue.
I am bound to speak.

1468
01:47:58,482 --> 01:48:01,246
My mistress here lies
murdered in her bed.

1469
01:48:04,788 --> 01:48:06,585
Your reports have set the murder on.

1470
01:48:06,991 --> 01:48:09,619
Nay, stare not, masters.

1471
01:48:10,227 --> 01:48:13,287
It is true indeed.

1472
01:48:14,098 --> 01:48:15,122
Villainy...

1473
01:48:15,332 --> 01:48:17,630
...villainy, villainy!

1474
01:48:17,835 --> 01:48:18,961
I think upon it...

1475
01:48:19,837 --> 01:48:22,965
...I think, I smell it, O villainy!

1476
01:48:23,307 --> 01:48:26,868
What? Are you mad?
I charge you, get you home.

1477
01:48:27,077 --> 01:48:29,170
Good gentlemen, let me
have leave to speak.

1478
01:48:30,047 --> 01:48:32,481
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.

1479
01:48:33,050 --> 01:48:34,984
Perchance I will never go home.

1480
01:48:37,488 --> 01:48:38,318
Nay...

1481
01:48:39,189 --> 01:48:42,420
...lay thee down and roar!

1482
01:48:42,626 --> 01:48:45,857
Thou has killed the sweetest
innocent that ever did lift up eye.

1483
01:48:46,063 --> 01:48:49,191
O, she was foul!
Iago knows that she with Cassio...

1484
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:51,994
...hath the act of shame
a thousand times committed.

1485
01:48:52,202 --> 01:48:55,763
Cassio confessed, and she gratified his
amorous works with that handkerchief.

1486
01:48:55,973 --> 01:48:58,100
I saw it in his hand.

1487
01:49:01,111 --> 01:49:02,635
O God!

1488
01:49:04,982 --> 01:49:06,779
O heavenly God!

1489
01:49:09,086 --> 01:49:11,054
Be wise...

1490
01:49:11,955 --> 01:49:13,980
...and get you home.

1491
01:49:15,259 --> 01:49:17,386
I will not.

1492
01:49:19,630 --> 01:49:20,892
O thou dull Moor!

1493
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:26,699
That handkerchief thou
speakest of I found by fortune...

1494
01:49:27,671 --> 01:49:28,968
...and did give my husband.

1495
01:49:29,173 --> 01:49:30,697
Filth...

1496
01:49:30,908 --> 01:49:31,738
...thou liest!

1497
01:49:31,942 --> 01:49:34,911
By heaven, I do not.
I do not, gentlemen. I found it!

1498
01:49:35,746 --> 01:49:39,341
Are there no stones in heaven
but what serves for thunder?

1499
01:49:40,384 --> 01:49:42,079
Precious villain!

1500
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:58,595
Stop, villain!

1501
01:50:01,505 --> 01:50:03,598
Lay me by my mistress' side.

1502
01:50:42,546 --> 01:50:45,242
What did thy song bode, lady?

1503
01:50:46,083 --> 01:50:48,347
Hark, canst thou hear me?

1504
01:50:49,286 --> 01:50:52,551
I will play the swan and die in music.

1505
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:55,655
Willow...

1506
01:50:55,859 --> 01:50:58,157
...willow, willow

1507
01:50:59,196 --> 01:51:02,359
Moor, she was chaste.

1508
01:51:02,566 --> 01:51:05,501
She loved thee, cruel Moor.

1509
01:51:07,804 --> 01:51:10,568
So come my soul to bliss...

1510
01:51:11,208 --> 01:51:12,903
...as I speak true.

1511
01:51:13,610 --> 01:51:16,773
So speaking as I think, I die...

1512
01:51:18,215 --> 01:51:20,149
...I die.

1513
01:51:23,687 --> 01:51:26,520
Where is this rash
and most unfortunate man?

1514
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:32,060
That's he that was Othello.

1515
01:51:35,566 --> 01:51:36,965
Here I am.

1516
01:51:38,035 --> 01:51:39,366
Where is that viper?

1517
01:51:39,937 --> 01:51:42,132
Bring the villain forth.

1518
01:51:51,481 --> 01:51:54,348
I look down towards his feet...

1519
01:51:55,552 --> 01:51:57,679
...but that's a fable.

1520
01:51:58,188 --> 01:52:00,349
If that thou be a devil...

1521
01:52:00,857 --> 01:52:02,688
...I cannot kill thee.

1522
01:52:18,942 --> 01:52:23,311
I bleed, sir...

1523
01:52:23,513 --> 01:52:25,037
...but not killed.

1524
01:52:25,616 --> 01:52:28,210
I am not sorry neither.

1525
01:52:28,752 --> 01:52:30,982
I'd have thee live.

1526
01:52:31,188 --> 01:52:33,952
For in my sense...

1527
01:52:34,157 --> 01:52:37,251
...'tis happiness to die.

1528
01:52:37,461 --> 01:52:39,019
This wretch...

1529
01:52:39,229 --> 01:52:42,255
...hath part confessed his villainy.

1530
01:52:44,301 --> 01:52:47,270
Did you and he consent...

1531
01:52:47,471 --> 01:52:49,666
...in Cassio's death?

1532
01:52:50,674 --> 01:52:52,164
Ay.

1533
01:52:53,977 --> 01:52:56,275
Dear general, I never gave you cause.

1534
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:59,847
I do believe it and ask your pardon.

1535
01:53:01,285 --> 01:53:03,344
Will you, I pray...

1536
01:53:03,553 --> 01:53:05,783
...demand this demi-devil...

1537
01:53:06,390 --> 01:53:10,224
...why he hath thus ensnared
my soul and body?

1538
01:53:11,228 --> 01:53:14,026
Demand me nothing.

1539
01:53:15,565 --> 01:53:17,430
What you know, you know.

1540
01:53:18,969 --> 01:53:20,869
From this time forth...

1541
01:53:21,204 --> 01:53:24,230
...I never will speak word.

1542
01:53:26,109 --> 01:53:27,633
Well...

1543
01:53:28,879 --> 01:53:31,040
...thou dost best.

1544
01:53:33,383 --> 01:53:35,283
Forsake this room and go with us.

1545
01:53:35,485 --> 01:53:37,419
Your power and command is taken off...

1546
01:53:38,055 --> 01:53:40,751
...and Cassio rules in Cyprus.

1547
01:53:50,634 --> 01:53:52,329
Come, bring him away.

1548
01:53:52,636 --> 01:53:54,035
A word before you go.

1549
01:53:54,438 --> 01:53:57,464
I have done the state
some service, and they know it.

1550
01:54:11,121 --> 01:54:13,146
No more of that.

1551
01:54:18,228 --> 01:54:19,820
I pray you...

1552
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:23,456
...in your letters, when you
these unlucky deeds relate...

1553
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,831
...speak of me as I am.

1554
01:54:26,269 --> 01:54:28,430
Nothing extenuate...

1555
01:54:28,638 --> 01:54:31,129
...nor set down aught in malice.

1556
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:34,936
Then must you speak of one...

1557
01:54:35,145 --> 01:54:38,137
...that loved not wisely,
but too well.

1558
01:54:38,348 --> 01:54:42,717
Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought...

1559
01:54:42,919 --> 01:54:45,820
...perplexed in the extreme.

1560
01:54:46,590 --> 01:54:49,957
Of one whose hand,
like the base Indian...

1561
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:53,721
...threw a pearl away
richer than all his tribe.

1562
01:54:54,731 --> 01:54:57,325
Of one whose subdued eyes...

1563
01:54:57,534 --> 01:55:01,197
...albeit unused to the melting mood...

1564
01:55:01,405 --> 01:55:05,637
...drop tears as fast as
the Arabian trees...

1565
01:55:05,842 --> 01:55:07,537
...their medicinal gum.

1566
01:55:10,847 --> 01:55:12,644
Set you down this.

1567
01:55:13,717 --> 01:55:15,981
And say, besides...

1568
01:55:17,421 --> 01:55:19,412
...that in Aleppo once...

1569
01:55:20,590 --> 01:55:24,253
...where a malignant
and a turbanned Turk...

1570
01:55:24,461 --> 01:55:26,361
...beat a Venetian...

1571
01:55:26,763 --> 01:55:29,061
...and traduced the state...

1572
01:55:30,033 --> 01:55:33,434
...I took by the throat...

1573
01:55:33,637 --> 01:55:36,003
...the circumcised dog...

1574
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:38,173
...and smote him...

1575
01:55:40,143 --> 01:55:41,371
...thus.

1576
01:56:23,086 --> 01:56:25,247
I kissed thee...

1577
01:56:25,455 --> 01:56:27,980
...ere I killed thee.

1578
01:56:29,259 --> 01:56:31,727
No way but this...

1579
01:56:33,196 --> 01:56:35,562
...killing myself...

1580
01:56:36,333 --> 01:56:39,825
...to die upon a kiss.

1581
01:56:46,910 --> 01:56:50,539
This I did fear, but thought
he had no weapon.

1582
01:56:51,147 --> 01:56:53,138
For he was great of heart.

1583
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:55,443
O Spartan dog!

1584
01:56:58,488 --> 01:57:01,321
Look on the tragic
loading of this bed.

1585
01:57:02,192 --> 01:57:04,023
This is thy work.

1586
01:57:13,770 --> 01:57:15,738
To you, lord governor...

1587
01:57:15,939 --> 01:57:19,534
...remains the censure
of this hellish villain.

1588
01:57:20,343 --> 01:57:21,810
The time...

1589
01:57:22,812 --> 01:57:24,279
...the place...

1590
01:57:25,749 --> 01:57:27,979
...the torture.
O, enforce it!

1591
01:57:31,521 --> 01:57:33,785
Myself will straight aboard...

1592
01:57:34,791 --> 01:57:37,191
...and to the state...

1593
01:57:37,394 --> 01:57:39,089
...this heavy act...

1594
01:57:39,863 --> 01:57:42,297
...with heavy heart relate.
