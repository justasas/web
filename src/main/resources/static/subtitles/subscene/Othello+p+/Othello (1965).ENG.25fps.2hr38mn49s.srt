didst hold him in thy hate.

Despise me, if I do not.

4
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:53,987
Three great ones of the city in personal
suit to make me his lieutenant...

5
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:55,347
...off-capped to him.

6
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:59,787
And by the faith of man, I know my
price. I am worth no worse a place.

7

But he evades them...

8
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:04,786
...and non-suits my mediators.

9
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:08,626
"For certes," says he, "I
have already chose my officer."

10
00:02:08,786 --> 00:02:11,026
And what was he? Forsooth,
a great arithmetician.

11
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:14,185
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine.

12
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:16,545
A fellow that never set
a squadron in the field...

13
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:19,265
...nor the division of a battle
knows more than a spinster.

14
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:21,425
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be...

15
00:02:21,585 --> 00:02:25,064
...and I, God bless the
mark, his Moorship's ancient.

16
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:27,824
Now, sir, be judge yourself
whether I in any just term...

17
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:30,064
...am affined to love the Moor.

18
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,343
I would not follow him then.

19

20
00:02:42,023 --> 00:02:45,822

21

Heaven is my judge, not
I for love and duty...

22

...but seeming so for my peculiar end.

23
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,381

action doth demonstrate...

24
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,501
...the native act and figure of
my heart in compliment extern...

accent and dire yell...

For shame, put on your gown.

...or else that devil will
make a grandsire of you.

- Arise, I say.
- What, have you lost your wits?

48

Most reverend signor, do you know my voice?

49

- My name is Roderigo.

- The worse welcome. RoDERIGo: Sir.

51
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:28,053
I have told thee not to haunt about my doors.

52

In honest plainness thou hast heard me say...

- Patience, good sir.

will not serve God if the devil bid you.

are now making a beast with two backs.

- You're a senator.

answer. I know thee, Roderigo.

...that your fair daughter at this
odd-even and dull watch o'th'night...

67

...transported with no
worse nor better guard...

68

...but with a knave of
common hire, a gondolier...

69
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:21,687
...to the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor.

a taper, call up all my people.

- Against the Moor.

loud reason to the Cyprus wars.

fathom they have not to lead their business.

hate him as I do hell's pains...

must show out a flag and sign of love...

provoking terms against your honor...

I have, I did full hard forbear him.

00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:56,661
...for I'll refer me to
all things of sense...

166
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,661
...whether a maid so
tender, fair and happy...

167
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:02,101
...could ever have t'incur a general mock...

168
00:10:02,261 --> 00:10:06,180
...run from her guardage to the
sooty bosom of such a thing as thou?

169
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,900
To fear, not to delight.

170
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,740
I therefore apprehend and do attach
thee for an abuser of the world.

171
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,620
A practicer of arts
inhibited and out of warrant.

172
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,979
- Lay hold upon him.
- Halt!

173
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:20,459
Hold your hands, both you
of my inclining and the rest.

174
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:24,619
Were it my cue to fight, I should
have known it without a prompter.

175
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,938
Where will you that I go
to answer this your charge?

176
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,498
To prison.

177
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:32,658
Till fit time of law and direct
session call thee to answer.

178
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:35,018
How may the duke be therewith satisfied...

179
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:37,137
...whose messengers are here about my side...

180
00:10:37,297 --> 00:10:40,057
...upon some present business
of the state to bring me to him?

181
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:42,537
'Tis true, most worthy
signor, the duke's in council.

182
00:10:42,697 --> 00:10:45,737
- And your noble self, I am sure, is sent for.
- How?

183
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:48,936
The duke in council in
this time of the night?

184
00:10:49,096 --> 00:10:50,456
Bring him away.

185
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:00,935
Mine's not an idle cause.

186
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,975
The duke himself or any of
my brothers of the state...

187
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:06,935
...cannot but feel this
wrong as 'twere their own.

188
00:11:07,095 --> 00:11:09,694
For if such actions
shall have passage free...

189
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:13,894
...bond slaves and pagans
shall our statesmen be.

190
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:21,413
Valiant othello, we must
straight employ you...

191
00:11:21,573 --> 00:11:24,173
...against the general enemy ottoman.

192
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,213
I did not see you. Welcome, gentle signor.

193
00:11:27,413 --> 00:11:29,413
We lacked your counsel and your help tonight.

194
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,532
So did I yours.

195
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,772
Good your grace, pardon me.

196
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:36,172
Neither my place, nor
aught I heard of business...

197
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:38,292
...hath raised me from my bed...

198
00:11:38,452 --> 00:11:41,491
...nor doth the general
care take any hold on me.

199
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:45,531
For my particular grief is of so
floodgate and o'erbearing nature...

200
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:48,571
...that it engluts and
swallows other sorrows.

201
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:49,971
And it is still itself.

202
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:52,890
- Why, what's the matter?
- My daughter.

203
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,250
O, my daughter.

204
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,170
- Dead?
- Ay, to me.

205
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,210
She is abused, stolen from me...

206
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,129
...and corrupted by spells and
medicines bought of mountebanks.

207
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,809
For nature so preposterously to err...

208
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:09,129
...being not deficient,
blind nor lame of sense...

209
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:11,489
...sans witchcraft could not.

210
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,608
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding...

211
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:17,568
...hath thus beguiled your daughter
of herself and you of her...

212
00:12:17,728 --> 00:12:20,128
...the bloody book of law
you shall yourself read...

213
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:24,927
...in the bitter letter after its own sense
though our proper son stood in your action.

214
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:26,967
Humbly I thank your grace.

215
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:30,487
Here is the man. This Moor...

216
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:34,686
...whom now it seems your special mandate
for the state affairs hath hither brought.

217
00:12:37,726 --> 00:12:39,286
DUKE: We are very sorry for't.

218
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:43,206
What, in your own part, can you say to this?

219
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:45,845
Nothing, but this is so.

220
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:51,525
Most potent, grave and reverend signors...

221
00:12:51,725 --> 00:12:55,364
...my very noble and approved good masters...

222
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,044
...that I have ta'en away
this old man's daughter...

223
00:12:59,204 --> 00:13:00,884
...it is most true.

224
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:03,684
True, I have married her.

225
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:08,443
The very head and front of my
offending hath this extent, no more.

226
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:10,243
Rude am I in my speech...

227
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:13,643
...and little blessed with
the soft phrase of peace...

228
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:16,562
...for since these arms of
mine had seven years' pith...

229
00:13:16,722 --> 00:13:20,122
...till now some nine moons wasted...

230
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:23,922
...they have used their dearest
action in the tented field...

231
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:26,401
...and little of this
great world can I speak...

232
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:30,081
...more than pertains to
feats of broil and battle.

233
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:34,721
Therefore, little shall I grace
my cause in speaking for myself.

234
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:36,360
Yet by your gracious patience...

235
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,760
...I will a round unvarnished tale
deliver of my whole course of love.

236
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,320
What drugs, what charms...

237
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,879
...what conjurations or what mighty magic...

238
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:50,839
...for such proceedings am I charged withal.

239
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:53,519
I won his daughter.

240
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,559
A maiden never bold...

241
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,518
...of spirit so still and quiet
that her motion blushed at itself.

242
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:06,118
And she, in spite of nature of years,
of country, credit, everything...

243
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,357
...to fall in love with
what she feared to look on.

244
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:13,117
It is a judgment maimed and most imperfect...

245
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:18,276
...that will confess perfection so
could err against all rules of nature.

246
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:22,076
I therefore vouch again that with
some mixture powerful o'er the blood...

247
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:24,636
...or with some dram
conjured to that effect...

248
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:26,476
...he wrought upon her.

249
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:30,395
To vouch this is no proof without
more certain and more overt test.

250
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:35,195
These are thin habits and poor likelihoods
of modern seeming you prefer against him.

251
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:36,635
But, othello, speak.

252
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:39,314
Did you by indirect and forced courses...

253
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:41,674
...subdue and poison this
young maid's affections?

254
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:45,634
Or came it by request and such fair
question as soul to soul affordeth?

255
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:46,954
I do beseech you.

256
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:51,073
Send for the lady to the Sagittary and
let her speak of me before her father.

257
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:53,153
If you do find me foul in her report...

258
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:56,433
...the trust the office I do
hold of you not only take away...

259
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:59,193
...but let your sentence
even fall upon my life.

260
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:02,112
Fetch Desdemona hither.

261
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:05,752
Ancient, conduct them.
You best know the place.

262
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:09,072
And till she come...

263
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:12,151
...as truly as to heaven, I do
confess the vices of my blood...

264
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,911
...so justly to your
grave ears I'll present...

265
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:18,671
...how I did thrive in
this fair lady's love...

266
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,111
...and she in mine.

267
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:22,230
Say it, othello.

268
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,670
Her father loved me.

269
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,550
Oft invited me.

270
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,229
Still questioned me the story
of my life from year to year:

271
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:38,669
The battles, sieges,
fortunes that I have passed.

272
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:41,429
I ran it through even from my boyish days...

273
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:44,348
...to th'very moment
that he bade me tell it...

274
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:47,908
...wherein I spake of
most disastrous chances...

275
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:51,188
...of moving accidents by flood and field...

276
00:15:51,388 --> 00:15:54,667
...of hairbreadth scapes
i'th'imminent deadly breach...

277
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:58,387
...of being taken by the insolent
foe and sold to slavery...

278
00:15:58,547 --> 00:16:00,667
...of my redemption thence...

279
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,947
...and portance in my travels' history.

280
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:06,066
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle...

281
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:09,866
...rough quarries, rocks and
hills whose heads touch heaven...

282
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:11,466
...it was my hint to speak.

283
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:16,345
Such was the process and of the
cannibals that each other eat...

284
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:19,025
...the anthropophagi...

285
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:25,184
...and men whose heads do
grow beneath their shoulders.

286
00:16:27,064 --> 00:16:32,104
This to hear would
Desdemona seriously incline.

287
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:35,183
But still the house affairs
would draw her thence...

288
00:16:35,383 --> 00:16:37,703
...which ever as she could
with haste dispatch...

289
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,743
...she'd come again...

290
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:44,943
...and with a greedy ear,
devour up my discourse.

291
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:49,022
Which, I observing, took
once a pliant hour...

292
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:52,742
...and found good means to draw
from her a prayer of earnest heart...

293
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:54,942
...that I would all my pilgrimage dilate...

294
00:16:55,102 --> 00:16:57,701
...whereof by parcels
she had something heard...

295
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:59,701
...but not intentively.

296
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:01,861
I did consent...

297
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,101
...and often did beguile her of her tears...

298
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:10,380
...when I did tell of some distressful
stroke that my youth suffered.

299
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,420
My story being done...

300
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,739
...she gave me for my pains a world of sighs.

301
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:23,499
She swore, in faith 'twas
strange, 'twas passing strange...

302
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,658
...'twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.

303
00:17:27,858 --> 00:17:29,378
She wished she had not heard it...

304
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:34,778
...yet she wished heaven
had made her such a man.

305
00:17:35,538 --> 00:17:40,257
She thanked me...

306
00:17:41,657 --> 00:17:44,497
...and bade me, if I had
a friend that loved her...

307
00:17:44,657 --> 00:17:47,177
...I should but teach him
how to tell my story...

308
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:50,656
...and that would woo her.

309
00:17:51,056 --> 00:17:52,776
Upon this hint I spake.

310
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:56,376
She loved me for the dangers I had passed...

311
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:59,455
...and I loved her that she did pity them.

312
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:03,855
This only is the witchcraft I have used.

313
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:07,455
Here comes the lady, let her witness it.

314
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:20,293
I think this tale would win my daughter too.

315
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:22,053
Good Brabantio...

316
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:25,093
...take up this mangled matter at the best.

317
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:28,693
Men do their broken weapons
rather use than their bare hands.

318
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:30,932
I pray you, hear her speak.

319
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:33,972
If she confess that she was half the wooer...

320
00:18:34,132 --> 00:18:38,052
...destruction light on me if
my bad blame light on the man.

321
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:40,452
Come hither, gentle mistress.

322
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,771
Do you perceive in all this noble company...

323
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:47,651
...where most you owe obedience?

324
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:52,290
My noble father, I do
perceive here a divided duty.

325
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,090
To you I am bound for life and education.

326
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,370
My life and education both do
learn me how to respect you.

327
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,169
You are the lord of duty,
I am hitherto your daughter.

328
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:08,729
But here's my husband.

329
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:10,889
And so much duty as my
mother showed to you...

330
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,648
...preferring you before her father...

331
00:19:13,808 --> 00:19:17,688
...so much I challenge that I may
profess due to the Moor, my lord.

332
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,128
God be with you.

333
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:23,687
I hath done. On to the affairs of state.

334
00:19:23,847 --> 00:19:28,207
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.

335
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:34,006
Moor, I here do give thee
that with all my heart...

336
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,606
...which, but thou hast already...

337
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:40,406
...with all my heart I would keep from thee.

338
00:19:40,926 --> 00:19:46,005
For thy sake, jewel, I am glad
at soul I have no other child...

339
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:50,565
...for thy escape would teach
me tyranny to hang clogs on them.

340
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:52,365
I have done, my lord.

341
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,084
Beseech you. On to the affairs of state.

342
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:01,124
The Turk with most mighty
preparation makes for Cyprus.

343
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:05,284
Othello, the fortitude of the
place is best known to you.

344
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:08,443
And though we have there a substitute
of most allowed sufficiency...

345
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:11,203
...yet opinion, a sovereign
mistress of effects...

346
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:14,403
...throws a more safer voice on you.

347
00:20:15,403 --> 00:20:19,282
You must therefore be content to
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes...

348
00:20:19,442 --> 00:20:21,722
...with this more stubborn
and boisterous expedition.

349
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:23,922
The tyrant custom, most grave senators...

350
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:26,202
...hath made the flinty
and steel couch of war...

351
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:28,721
...my thrice-driven bed of down.

352
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:32,281
I do agnise a natural and prompt
alacrity I find in hardness...

353
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,641
...and do undertake these present
wars against the ottomites.

354
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:38,840
Most humbly therefore
bending to your state...

355
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,440
...I crave fit disposition for my wife...

356
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,560
...due reference of place and exhibition...

357
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,719
...in such accommodation and
besort as levels with her breeding.

358
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,679
- Lf you please, be't at her father's.
- I'll not have it so.

359
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,399
- Nor I.
- Nor I.

360
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,879
I would not there reside to put my father
in impatient thoughts by being in his eye.

361
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:00,198
Most gracious duke...

362
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,998
...to my unfolding, lend a prosperous ear...

363
00:21:03,198 --> 00:21:06,918
...and let me find a charter in
your voice t'assist my simpleness.

364
00:21:07,078 --> 00:21:09,797
What would you? Speak.

365
00:21:10,157 --> 00:21:12,957
That I did love the Moor to live with him...

366
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:15,517
...my downright violence
and storm of fortunes...

367
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:18,237
...may trumpet to the world.

368
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:23,876
My heart's subdued even to
the utmost pleasure of my lord.

369
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:27,916
I saw othello's visage in his mind...

370
00:21:28,076 --> 00:21:33,835
...and to his honors and his valiant parts
did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.

371
00:21:33,995 --> 00:21:37,675
So that, dear lords, if I be
left behind, a moth of peace...

372
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:41,714
...and he go to the war, the rites
for why I love him are bereft me...

373
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:45,394
...and I a heavy interim shall
support by his dear absence.

374
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:48,714
- Let me go with him.
- I do beseech you, let her have your voice.

375
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:53,393
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it
not to please the palate of my appetite...

376
00:21:53,593 --> 00:21:57,233
...but to be free and bounteous of her mind.

377
00:21:57,393 --> 00:21:59,793
Heaven defend your good
souls that you think I will...

378
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:04,032
...your serious and great
business scant for she is with me.

379
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:07,872
Be it as you shall privately
determine, either for her stay or going.

380
00:22:08,032 --> 00:22:10,872
Th'affair cries haste
and speed must answer it.

381
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:12,711
You must hence tonight.

382
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:14,351
- Tonight, my lord?
- This night.

383
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:15,951
With all my heart.

384
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:20,031
At 1 o i'th'morning, here we'll meet again.

385
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:24,470
Othello, leave some officer behind and
he shall our commission bring to you...

386
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:28,270
...with such things else of
courtesy and respect as doth concern.

387
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,710
So please your grace, my ancient.
A man he is of honesty and trust.

388
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,629
To his conveyance I assign my wife...

389
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:37,349
...with what else needful your good
grace shall think to be sent after me.

390
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:38,669
Let it be so.

391
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,189
Good night to everyone.

392
00:22:43,828 --> 00:22:45,868
And, noble signor...

393
00:22:46,028 --> 00:22:48,868
...if virtue no delighted beauty lack...

394
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:53,388
...your son-in-law is
far more fair than black.

395
00:23:12,946 --> 00:23:17,305
Adieu, brave Moor. Use Desdemona well.

396
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:32,424
Look to her, Moor, have a quick eye to see.

397
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:36,823
She has deceived her father and may thee.

398
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:40,623
My life upon her faith.

399
00:23:43,343 --> 00:23:46,822
Honest lago, my Desdemona
must I leave to thee.

400
00:23:47,022 --> 00:23:52,102
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her and
bring them after in the best advantage.

401
00:23:52,262 --> 00:23:54,542
Come, my Desdemona, I
have but an hour of love...

402
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:57,781
...of worldly matters and
direction to spend with thee.

403
00:23:57,941 --> 00:24:00,901
We must obey the time.

404
00:24:06,981 --> 00:24:08,540
Lago.

405
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,100
What sayst thou, noble heart?

406
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,660
What shall I do, thinkest thou?

407
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:17,020
Why, go to bed and sleep.

408
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,179
I will incontinently drown myself.

409
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:22,739
Well, if thou dost, I shall
never love thee after it.

410
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:25,979
Why, thou silly gentleman?

411
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:28,219
What shall I do?

412
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:32,978
I confess it is my shame to be so fond,
but it is not in my virtue to amend it.

413
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,258
Virtue? A fig.

414
00:24:35,418 --> 00:24:37,498
'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.

415
00:24:37,658 --> 00:24:41,057
Our bodies are gardens to the
which our wills are gardeners.

416
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:43,777
If the balance of our lives
had not one scale of reason...

417
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:46,257
...to poise another of sensuality...

418
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:48,497
...by the blood and
baseness of our natures...

419
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:52,176
...would conduct us to most
preposterous conclusions.

420
00:24:52,336 --> 00:24:55,656
But we have reason to
cool our raging motions...

421
00:24:55,816 --> 00:25:00,335
...our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts.

422
00:25:00,495 --> 00:25:04,655
Whereof I take this, that you
call love, to be a sect or scion.

423
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:07,735
- It cannot be.
- It is merely a lust of the blood...

424
00:25:07,895 --> 00:25:09,895
...and a permission of the will.

425
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:12,494
Come, be a man.

426
00:25:12,654 --> 00:25:14,334
Drown thyself.

427
00:25:14,494 --> 00:25:18,774
Drown cats and blind puppies.

428
00:25:19,214 --> 00:25:21,134
I professed me thy friend...

429
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:26,973
...and I confess me knit to thy deserving
with cables of perdurable toughness.

430
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:30,093
I could never better stead thee than now.

431
00:25:32,292 --> 00:25:34,772
Put money in thy purse.

432
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:37,532
Follow these wars.

433
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:40,412
Defeat thy favor with an usurped beard.

434
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:43,651
It cannot be that Desdemona should
long continue her love to the Moor.

435
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:46,091
She must change for youth.

436
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:50,651
When she is sated with his body, she
will find the error of her choice.

437
00:25:51,011 --> 00:25:53,690
She must have change.

438
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,290
She must.

439
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,010
Therefore put money in thy purse.

440
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:03,210
If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do
it a more delicate way than drowning.

441
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:05,009
Make all the money thou canst.

442
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:09,209
If sanctimony and a frail vow
betwixt an erring barbarian...

443
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:12,209
...and a super-subtle venetian,
be not too hard for my wits...

444
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:14,688
...and all the tribe of
hell, thou shalt enjoy her.

445
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:16,128
Go, make money.

446
00:26:16,288 --> 00:26:19,568
A pox of drowning thyself.
It's clean out of the way.

447
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:22,608
Seek thou rather to be hanged
in compassing thy joy...

448
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:26,087
...than to be drowned and go without her.

449
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,727
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes
if I depend on the issue?

450
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,607
Thou art sure of me.

451
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:32,527
Go, make money.

452
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:35,566
I have told thee often and
I tell thee again and again...

453
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:37,526
...I hate the Moor.

454
00:26:37,686 --> 00:26:41,566
My cause is hearted,
thine hath no less reason.

455
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:45,206
Let us be conjunctive in
our revenge against him.

456
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:46,645
If thou canst cuckold him...

457
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:50,845
...thou dost thyself a
pleasure and me a sport.

458
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:55,605
There are many events in the womb
of time which will be delivered.

459
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:58,644
Traverse. Go, provide thy money.
We'll have more of this tomorrow.

460
00:26:58,844 --> 00:27:01,244
- Where shall we meet in the morning?
- At my lodging.

461
00:27:01,404 --> 00:27:03,444
- I'll be with thee betimes.
- Go to. Farewell.

462
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:05,124
Do you hear, Roderigo?

463
00:27:05,284 --> 00:27:06,683
What sayst thou?

464
00:27:06,843 --> 00:27:09,523
No more of drowning, do you hear?

465
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:11,323
I am changed.

466
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:14,763
- I'll go sell all my land.
- Go to. Farewell.

467
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:17,722
Put money enough in your purse.

468
00:27:19,482 --> 00:27:21,882
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse.

469
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,282
For I mine own gained
knowledge should profane...

470
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:29,161
...if I would time expend with such
a snipe but for my sport and profit.

471
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:32,641
I hate the Moor.

472

my sheets he has done my office.

I know not if't be true...

474
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,840
...yet I, for mere suspicion in
that kind, will do as if for surety.

475
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,760
He holds me well, the better
shall my purpose work on him.

476
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,679
Cassio is a proper man.

477
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,399
Let me see, now. To get his place...

478
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,918
...and to plume up my will a double knavery.

479
00:28:01,518 --> 00:28:02,918
How?

480
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:07,038
How? Let me see.

481
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:16,797
After some time, to abuse othello's ear
that he is too familiar with his wife.

482
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:21,116
He hath a person and a smooth
dispose to be suspected...

483
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:23,556
...framed to make women false.

484
00:28:23,716 --> 00:28:25,636
The Moor is of a free and open nature...

485
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:28,756
...that thinks men honest
that but seem to be so...

486
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:32,995
...and would as tenderly be
led by the nose as asses are.

487
00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:36,435
I have it.

488
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:38,835
It is engendered.

489
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:42,234
Hell and night must bring
this monstrous birth...

1003
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:05,701
In happy time, lago.

1004
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:08,741
- You have not been abed, then?
- Why, no.

1005
00:59:08,901 --> 00:59:10,741
The day had broke before we parted.

1006
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:13,820
I have made bold, good lago,
to send in to your wife.

1007
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:17,740
My suit to her is that she will to
virtuous Desdemona procure me some access.

1008
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,380
I'll send her to you presently.

1009
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:22,420
And I'll devise a mean to
draw the Moor out of the way...

1010
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,299
...so that your converse and
business may be more free.

1011
00:59:25,499 --> 00:59:27,459
I humbly thank you for it.

1012
00:59:27,619 --> 00:59:31,539
I never knew a Florentine
more kind and honest.

1013
00:59:32,179 --> 00:59:33,858
Lo, the happiness.

1014
00:59:34,018 --> 00:59:35,578
Good morrow, good lieutenant.

1015
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,778
I am sorry for your displeasure,
but all will sure be well.

1016
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:42,458
The general and his wife are talking
of it and she speaks for you stoutly.

1017
00:59:42,618 --> 00:59:45,497
The Moor replies that he you
hurt is of great fame in Cyprus...

1018
00:59:45,657 --> 00:59:46,937
...and great affinity...

1019
00:59:47,097 --> 00:59:50,537
...and that in wholesome wisdom,
he might not but refuse you...

1020
00:59:50,697 --> 00:59:54,257
...but he protests he loves you and
needs no other suitor but his likings...

1021
00:59:54,417 --> 00:59:57,336
...to take the safest occasion by
the front to bring you in again.

1022
00:59:57,536 --> 01:00:01,536
Yet I beseech you, if you think
it fit, or that it may be done...

1023
01:00:01,696 --> 01:00:05,256
...give me advantage of some brief
discourse with Desdemona alone.

1024
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:06,615
I pray you, come in.

1025
01:00:06,775 --> 01:00:09,975
I will bestow you where you shall
have time to speak your bosom freely.

1026
01:00:10,135 --> 01:00:12,375
I am much bound to you.

1027
01:00:14,335 --> 01:00:17,854
These letters give, lago, to the pilot
and by him do my duties to the senate.

1028
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:20,734
That done, I will be walking on
the works. Repair there to me.

1029
01:00:20,894 --> 01:00:23,334
Well, my good lord, I'll do it.

1030
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,894
OTHELLo: This fortification,
gentlemen, shall we see't?

1031
01:00:26,054 --> 01:00:27,653
We'll wait upon your lordship.

1032
01:00:27,813 --> 01:00:31,893
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will
do all my abilities in thy behalf.

1033
01:00:32,093 --> 01:00:35,133
Good madam, do, I know it grieves
my husband as if the case were his.

1034
01:00:35,293 --> 01:00:37,332
DESDEMoNA: O, that's an honest fellow.

1035
01:00:37,492 --> 01:00:39,092
Do not doubt, Cassio...

1036
01:00:39,252 --> 01:00:42,252
...I will have my lord and you
again as friendly as you were.

1037
01:00:42,412 --> 01:00:44,612
Madam, whatever shall
become of Michael Cassio...

1038
01:00:44,772 --> 01:00:46,932
...he's never anything but your true servant.

1039
01:00:47,092 --> 01:00:49,331
O, sir, I thank you.

1040
01:00:49,531 --> 01:00:51,691
You do love my lord.

1041
01:00:51,851 --> 01:00:55,771
You have known him long
and be you well assured...

1042
01:00:55,931 --> 01:01:00,130
...he shall in strangeness stand no
further off than in a politic distance.

1043
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:03,250
Ay, but, lady, that policy
may either last so long...

1044
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:07,810
...or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
or breed itself so out of circumstance...

1045
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:10,129
...that, I being absent
and my place supplied...

1046
01:01:10,289 --> 01:01:12,369
...my general will forget
my love and service.

1047
01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:17,409
Do not doubt that. Before Emilia
here, I give thee warrant of thy place.

1048
01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:22,528
Assure thee, if I do vow a friendship,
I'll perform it to the last article.

1049
01:01:22,688 --> 01:01:24,888
My lord shall never rest.

1050
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:28,288
I'll watch him tame and
talk him out of patience.

1051
01:01:28,448 --> 01:01:31,447
His bed shall seem a
school, his board a shrift.

1052
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:35,407
I'll intermingle everything
he does with Cassio's suit.

1053
01:01:35,607 --> 01:01:37,647
Therefore be merry, Cassio...

1054
01:01:37,807 --> 01:01:41,046
...for thy solicitor shall rather
die than give thy cause away.

1055
01:01:41,206 --> 01:01:43,966
Madam, here comes my lord.

1056
01:01:44,126 --> 01:01:47,086
DESDEMoNA: Why, stay and hear me speak.
CASSlo: Not now, I am very ill at ease,

1057
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:50,725
- Unfit for mine own purposes.
DESDEMoNA: Well, do your discretion.

1058
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:54,485
Ha! I like not that.

1059
01:01:57,645 --> 01:01:59,445
What dost thou say?

1060
01:02:00,005 --> 01:02:02,924
Nothing, my lord, or if, I know not what.

1061
01:02:05,644 --> 01:02:07,804
Was that not Cassio parted from my wife?

1062
01:02:07,964 --> 01:02:09,364
Cassio, my lord?

1063
01:02:09,524 --> 01:02:11,564
No, sure, I cannot think it...

1064
01:02:11,723 --> 01:02:15,243
...that he would sneak away so
guilty-like, seeing you coming.

1065
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:17,923
[CHUCKLES]

1066
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:22,043
- I do believe 'twas he.
- How now, my lord?

1067
01:02:22,202 --> 01:02:26,522
I have been talking with a suitor here,
a man that languishes in your displeasure.

1068
01:02:26,682 --> 01:02:30,122
- Who is't you mean?
- Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.

1069
01:02:30,322 --> 01:02:33,961
Good my lord, if I have any
grace or power to move you...

1070
01:02:34,161 --> 01:02:36,841
...his present reconciliation take.

1071
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:39,721
For if he be not one that truly loves you...

1072
01:02:39,921 --> 01:02:42,121
...that errs in ignorance
and not in cunning...

1073
01:02:42,281 --> 01:02:44,960
...I have no judgment in an honest face.

1074
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,200
- I prithee, call him back.
- Went he hence now?

1075
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:51,120
Ay, sooth, so humbled he hath
left part of his grief with me.

1076
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,920
I suffer with him.

1077
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,239
Good love, call him back.

1078
01:02:54,399 --> 01:02:56,479
Not now, sweet Desdemon. Some other time.

1079
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:57,759
But shall't be shortly?

1080
01:02:57,919 --> 01:03:00,599
- The sooner, sweet, for you.
- Shall't be tonight, at supper?

1081
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:02,999
- No, not tonight.
- Tomorrow dinner, then?

1082
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:05,638
I shall not dine at
home. I meet the captains.

1083
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:08,158
Why, then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn.

1084
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:10,398
On Tuesday noon or night, or Wednesday morn.

1085
01:03:10,558 --> 01:03:14,758
I prithee, name the time, but
let it not exceed three days.

1086
01:03:14,917 --> 01:03:18,237
When shall he come? Tell me, othello.

1087
01:03:18,437 --> 01:03:20,797
I wonder in my soul what
you would ask of me...

1088
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:24,197
...that I should deny
or stand so mammering on.

1089
01:03:24,357 --> 01:03:28,356
What, Michael Cassio that
came a-wooing with you.

1090
01:03:28,516 --> 01:03:31,116
And many a time when I have
spoke of you dispraisingly...

1091
01:03:31,276 --> 01:03:34,516
...hath ta'en your part to have
so much to do to bring him in.

1092
01:03:34,676 --> 01:03:37,635
- By'r lady, I could do much.
- Prithee, no more.

1093
01:03:37,795 --> 01:03:40,435
Let him come when he will,
I will deny thee nothing.

1094
01:03:40,595 --> 01:03:42,315
Why, this is not a boon.

1095
01:03:42,475 --> 01:03:44,555
'Tis as I should entreat
you wear your gloves...

1096
01:03:44,715 --> 01:03:48,594
...or feed on nourishing
dishes, or keep you warm...

1097
01:03:48,754 --> 01:03:51,554
...or sue to you to do a peculiar
profit to your own person.

1098
01:03:52,994 --> 01:03:57,753
Nay, when I have a suit wherein
I mean to touch your love indeed...

1099
01:03:57,913 --> 01:04:00,313
...it shall be full of
poise and difficult weight...

1100
01:04:00,473 --> 01:04:02,193
...and fearful to be granted.

1101
01:04:02,353 --> 01:04:04,673
I will deny thee nothing.

1102
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:06,753
Whereon, I do beseech you, grant me this:

1103
01:04:06,913 --> 01:04:09,712
To leave me but a little to myself.

1104
01:04:09,872 --> 01:04:12,952
Shall I deny you? No.

Farewell, my lord.

Farewell, my Desdemona.
I'll come to thee straight.

your fancies teach you.

Whate'er you be, I am obedient.

Excellent wretch.

...but I do love thee.

...chaos is come again.

1115

My noble lord.

1116
01:04:55,948 --> 01:04:58,948
What dost thou say, lago?

1117
01:04:59,108 --> 01:05:01,787
Did Michael Cassio...

1118
01:05:01,947 --> 01:05:06,067
...when you wooed my lady, know of your love?

1119
01:05:06,227 --> 01:05:09,507
He did from first to last. Why dost thou ask?

1120
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:12,826
But for a satisfaction of
my thoughts, no further harm.

1121
01:05:12,986 --> 01:05:15,826
Why of thy thought, lago?

1122
01:05:16,026 --> 01:05:18,386
I did not think he had
been acquainted with her.

1123
01:05:18,546 --> 01:05:20,226
O, yes...

1124
01:05:20,386 --> 01:05:23,425
...and went between us very oft.

1125
01:05:24,065 --> 01:05:27,185
- Indeed.
- "Indeed"? Ay, indeed.

1126
01:05:27,345 --> 01:05:29,705
Discern'st thou aught in that?

1127
01:05:29,865 --> 01:05:31,704
Is he not honest?

1128
01:05:35,024 --> 01:05:37,144
- Honest, my lord?
- "Honest"? Ay, honest.

1129
01:05:37,304 --> 01:05:39,544
My lord, for aught I know.

1130
01:05:39,704 --> 01:05:41,784
What dost thou think?

1131
01:05:42,903 --> 01:05:44,343
Think, my lord?

1132
01:05:44,503 --> 01:05:46,703
"Think, my lord?" By heaven, he echoes me...

1133
01:05:46,863 --> 01:05:50,583
...as if there were some monster in
his thoughts too hideous to be shown.

1134
01:05:50,743 --> 01:05:53,622
Thou dost mean something.

1135
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:56,142
I heard thee say even now,
thou lik'st not that...

1136
01:05:56,342 --> 01:05:59,182
...when Cassio left my
wife. What did'st not like?

1137
01:06:00,542 --> 01:06:03,901
And when I told thee he was of my
counsel in my whole course of wooing...

1138
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:08,341
...thou cried'st, "Indeed," and didst
contract and purse thy brows together...

1139
01:06:08,501 --> 01:06:12,741
...as if thou then hadst shut up
in thy brain some horrible conceit.

1140
01:06:12,901 --> 01:06:15,300
If thou dost love me, show me thy thought.

1141
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:18,420
- My lord, you know I love you.
- I think thou dost.

1142
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,100
And for I know thou'rt
full of love and honesty...

1143
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:25,259
...and weigh'st thy words
before thou giv'st them breath...

1144
01:06:25,459 --> 01:06:30,019
...therefore these stops
of thine fright me the more.

1145
01:06:30,179 --> 01:06:34,179
For such things in a false disloyal
knave are tricks of custom...

1146
01:06:34,339 --> 01:06:37,058
...but in a man that's just,
they are close denotements...

1147
01:06:37,218 --> 01:06:40,458
...working from the heart
that passion cannot rule.

1148
01:06:40,618 --> 01:06:44,738
For Michael Cassio, I dare be
sworn I think that he is honest.

1149
01:06:44,898 --> 01:06:48,177
- I think so too.
- Men should be that they seem.

1150
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:51,457
Or if they be not, would
they might seem none.

1151
01:06:53,537 --> 01:06:56,936
Certain, men should be what they seem.

1152
01:06:57,136 --> 01:06:59,536
Why, then, I think Cassio is an honest man.

1153
01:07:02,376 --> 01:07:03,936
Nay!

1154
01:07:04,456 --> 01:07:06,815
Yet there's more in this.

1155
01:07:08,015 --> 01:07:13,135
I prithee, speak to me as to thy
thinkings as thou dost ruminate...

1156
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:16,735
...and give thy worst of
thoughts the worst of words.

1157
01:07:16,895 --> 01:07:19,214
Good my lord, pardon me.

1158
01:07:19,374 --> 01:07:24,294
Though I am bound to every act of duty, I
am not bound to that all slaves are free to.

1159
01:07:24,454 --> 01:07:26,494
Utter my thoughts?

1160
01:07:26,654 --> 01:07:29,613
Why, say they are vile and false...

1161
01:07:29,773 --> 01:07:32,973
...as where's that palace where into
foul things sometimes intrude not?

1162
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:36,573
Thou dost conspire against thy friend
if thou but think'st him wronged...

1163
01:07:36,733 --> 01:07:38,972

plague to spy into abuses...

1167

- Ha!

1329
01:18:24,551 --> 01:18:27,431
- To have a foolish wife.
- O, is that all?

1330
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:29,991
What would you give me now
for that same handkerchief?

1331
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:35,110
- What handkerchief?
- What handkerchief?

1332
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:38,350
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona...

1333
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:40,550
...that which so often you did bid me steal.

1334
01:18:40,750 --> 01:18:43,749
- Hast stol'n it from her?
- No, faith, she let it drop by negligence.

1335
01:18:43,909 --> 01:18:46,789
To th'advantage, I, being there,
took't up. Look, here it is.

1336
01:18:46,949 --> 01:18:49,189
A good wench, give it me.

1337
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:50,509
What will you do with't...

1338
01:18:50,669 --> 01:18:54,068
...that you have been so
earnest to have me filch it?

1339
01:18:55,148 --> 01:18:57,708
Why, what's that to you?

1340
01:18:57,868 --> 01:19:00,268
If it be not for some
purpose of import, give't me.

1341
01:19:00,428 --> 01:19:02,907
Poor lady, she'll run mad if she do lack it.

1342
01:19:03,067 --> 01:19:06,947
Be not acknown on't. I have a use for it.

1343
01:19:09,627 --> 01:19:11,947
O, go, relieve me.

1344
01:19:15,106 --> 01:19:18,906
I will in Cassio's lodging lose
this napkin and let him find it.

1345
01:19:19,066 --> 01:19:21,786
Trifles light as air are to
the jealous confirmations...

1346
01:19:21,946 --> 01:19:23,905
...strong as proofs of holy writ.

1347
01:19:24,065 --> 01:19:25,825
This may do something.

1348
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:29,465
The Moor already changes with my poison.

1349
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:31,865
Dangerous conceits are in
their natures poisons...

1350
01:19:32,025 --> 01:19:34,384
...which at the first are
scarce found to distaste...

1351
01:19:34,544 --> 01:19:39,104
...but with a little act upon the
blood burn like the mines of sulfur.

1352
01:19:39,944 --> 01:19:42,344
I did say so. Look where he comes.

1353
01:19:45,703 --> 01:19:47,903
Not poppy, nor mandragora...

1354
01:19:48,063 --> 01:19:50,383
...nor all the drowsy syrups of the world...

1355
01:19:50,543 --> 01:19:52,743
...shall ever medicine
thee to that sweet sleep...

1356
01:19:52,903 --> 01:19:55,542
...which thou owedst yesterday.

1357
01:19:58,342 --> 01:20:01,302
False to me?

1358
01:20:01,462 --> 01:20:04,102
- To me!
- How now, general. No more of that.

1359
01:20:04,262 --> 01:20:06,861
Avaunt. Be gone.

1360
01:20:07,021 --> 01:20:09,941
Thou hast set me on the rack.

1361
01:20:10,101 --> 01:20:11,941
I swear 'tis better to be much abused...

1362
01:20:12,101 --> 01:20:13,941
...than but to know't a little.
- How now.

1363
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:16,380
What sense had I of her stolen hours of lust?

1364
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:18,700
I saw't not, thought it
not, it harmed not me.

1365
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:21,860
I slept the next night
well, was free and merry.

1366
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:25,460
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips.

1367
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:29,499
He that is robbed not wanting what is stolen,
let him not know't and he's not robbed.

1368
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:32,419
- I am sorry to hear.
- I had been happy if the general camp...

1369
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:35,379
...pioneers and all, had
tasted her sweet body...

1370
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:38,658
...so I had nothing known.

1371
01:20:38,818 --> 01:20:42,098
O, now...

1372
01:20:42,258 --> 01:20:45,778
...for ever farewell the tranquil mind.

1373
01:20:45,938 --> 01:20:49,177
Farewell content.

1374
01:20:49,337 --> 01:20:54,017
Farewell the plumed troops and the
big wars that make ambition virtue.

1375
01:20:54,177 --> 01:20:56,537
O, farewell.

1376
01:20:56,737 --> 01:21:00,176
Farewell the neighing steed
and the shrill trump...

1377
01:21:00,336 --> 01:21:03,776
...the spirit-stirring drum,
the ear- piercing fife...

1378
01:21:03,936 --> 01:21:06,816
...the royal banner and all quality...

1379
01:21:06,976 --> 01:21:11,055
...pride, pomp and
circumstance of glorious war!

1380
01:21:11,215 --> 01:21:13,455
And, o, you mortal engines,
whose rude throats...

1381
01:21:13,615 --> 01:21:17,655
...th'immortal Jove's dread
clamors counterfeit, farewell!

1382
01:21:18,135 --> 01:21:21,054
- Othello's occupation's gone!
- Is't possible, my lord?

1383
01:21:21,214 --> 01:21:24,614
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore.

1384
01:21:24,774 --> 01:21:29,613
Be sure of it, give me the ocular proof
or by the worth of man's eternal soul...

1385
01:21:29,773 --> 01:21:32,893
...thou hadst been better have born
a dog than answer my waked wrath.

1386
01:21:33,053 --> 01:21:35,453
- Is't come to this?
- Make me to see't or prove it...

1387
01:21:35,613 --> 01:21:38,613
...that the probation bear no
hinge nor loop to hang a doubt on...

1388
01:21:38,773 --> 01:21:40,652
...or woe upon thy life!
- My noble lord...

1389
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:43,732
If thou dost slander her and
torture me, never pray more.

1390
01:21:43,892 --> 01:21:47,292
Abandon all remorse, on horror's
head horrors accumulate...

1391
01:21:47,452 --> 01:21:50,252
...do deeds to make heaven
weep, all earth amazed...

1392
01:21:50,412 --> 01:21:53,931
...for nothing canst thou to
damnation add greater than that.

1393
01:21:54,091 --> 01:21:56,171
O, grace! O, heaven defend me.

1394
01:21:56,331 --> 01:21:59,451
Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?

1395
01:21:59,611 --> 01:22:01,610
God bu'y, take mine office.

1396
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:04,570
O, wretched fool that liv'st
to make thine honesty a vice.

1397
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:09,010
O, monstrous world! Take note, o, world,
to be direct and honest is not safe.

1398
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:12,049
I thank you for this profit, and
from hence I'll love no friend...

1399
01:22:12,249 --> 01:22:16,289
...since love breeds such offense.
- Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.

1400
01:22:16,449 --> 01:22:19,489
I should be wise, for honesty's a
fool and loses that it works for.

1401
01:22:19,649 --> 01:22:22,568
By the world, I think my wife
be honest and think she is not.

1402
01:22:22,728 --> 01:22:26,088
I think thou art just and think
thou art not. I'll have some proof.

1403
01:22:26,288 --> 01:22:29,528
Thy name which was as
fresh as Dian's visage...

1404
01:22:29,688 --> 01:22:33,207
...is now begrimed and
black as mine own face.

1405
01:22:33,367 --> 01:22:37,567
If there be cords or knives, poison
or fire or suffocating streams...

1406
01:22:37,727 --> 01:22:39,207
...l'll not endure it.

1407
01:22:39,367 --> 01:22:42,767
- Would I were satisfied.
- I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion.

1408
01:22:42,927 --> 01:22:45,886
I do repent me that I put it
to you. You would be satisfied?

1409
01:22:46,046 --> 01:22:49,046
- Would. Nay, I will.
- And may, but how?

1410
01:22:49,206 --> 01:22:52,486
How satisfied, my lord? Would you,
the supervisor, grossly gape on?

1411
01:22:52,646 --> 01:22:55,365
- Behold her topped?
- Death and damnation! O!

1412
01:22:55,525 --> 01:22:58,645
It were a tedious difficulty, I
think, to bring them to that prospect.

1413
01:22:58,805 --> 01:23:02,045
Damn them if ever mortal eyes shall
see them bolster more than their own.

1414
01:23:02,205 --> 01:23:05,564
What then? How then? What shall
I say? Where is satisfaction?

1415
01:23:05,724 --> 01:23:08,884
It is impossible you should see
this, were they as prime as goats...

1416
01:23:09,044 --> 01:23:12,044
...as hot as monkeys, as
salt as wolves in pride...

1417
01:23:12,204 --> 01:23:14,564
...and fools as gross
as ignorance made drunk.

1418
01:23:14,724 --> 01:23:17,723
Yet I say if imputation
and strong circumstance...

1419
01:23:17,883 --> 01:23:21,883
...that lead to the door of truth will
give you satisfaction, you may have it.

1420
01:23:22,043 --> 01:23:26,602
- Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
- I do not like the office.

1421
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:29,882
But sith I am entered in this cause so far...

1422
01:23:30,042 --> 01:23:32,842
...pricked to't by
foolish honesty and love...

1423
01:23:33,002 --> 01:23:35,002
...I will go on.

1424
01:23:37,201 --> 01:23:39,441
I lay with Cassio lately...

1425
01:23:39,601 --> 01:23:42,561
...and being troubled with a
raging tooth, I could not sleep.

1426
01:23:42,721 --> 01:23:47,280
There are a kind of men so loose of soul that
in their sleeps will mutter their affairs.

1427
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,520
One of this kind is Cassio.

1428
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:52,240
In sleep I heard him say:

1429
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,400
"Sweet Desdemona...

1430
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,919
...let us be wary. Let us hide our loves."

1431
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:03,279
Then, sir, would he gripe and wring
my hand, cry out, "Sweet creature."

1432
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:07,399
Then he kissed me hard, as if he plucked up
kisses by the roots that grew upon my lips.

1433
01:24:07,558 --> 01:24:12,118
Then laid his leg over my thigh and
sighed and kissed and then cried:

1434
01:24:12,278 --> 01:24:15,038
"Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!"

1435
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:17,318
O, monstrous!

1436
01:24:17,478 --> 01:24:19,557
- Monstrous!
- Nay, this was but a dream.

1437
01:24:19,717 --> 01:24:24,037
- But this denoted a foregone conclusion.
- A shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.

1438
01:24:24,237 --> 01:24:27,357
And this may help to thicken other
proofs that do demonstrate thinly.

1439
01:24:27,517 --> 01:24:31,156
I'll tear her all to pieces!

1440
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:35,036
Nay, but be wise, yet we see
nothing done. She may be honest yet.

1441
01:24:35,196 --> 01:24:38,156
Tell me but this, have you not
sometimes seen a handkerchief...

1442
01:24:38,316 --> 01:24:41,635
...spotted with strawberries
in your wife's hand?

1443
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:45,795
I gave her such a one. 'Twas my first gift.

1444
01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:50,434
I know not that, but such a handkerchief...
I am sure it was your wife's.

1445
01:24:50,914 --> 01:24:55,714
- Did I today see Cassio
wipe his beard with.

1446
01:24:59,714 --> 01:25:02,193
- Lf it be that...
- lf it be that or any that was hers...

1447
01:25:02,353 --> 01:25:05,393
...it speaks against her
with the other proofs.

1448
01:25:05,553 --> 01:25:09,873
That the slave had 4o, ooo lives!

1449
01:25:10,033 --> 01:25:14,872
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.

1450
01:25:15,592 --> 01:25:19,232
Now do I see 'tis true.

1451
01:25:21,311 --> 01:25:25,031
Look here, lago.

1452
01:25:26,231 --> 01:25:29,111
All my fond love...

1453
01:25:29,271 --> 01:25:33,670
...thus do I blow to heaven.

1454
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:37,150
'Tis gone.

1455
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:40,550
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell.

1456
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:45,149
Yield up, o, love, thy crown and
hearted throne to tyrannous hate.

1457
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:48,829
Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
for 'tis of aspics' tongues!

1458
01:25:49,029 --> 01:25:52,389
IAGo: Pray, be content. OTHELLo: O, blood!

1459
01:25:52,549 --> 01:25:54,468
Blood!

1460
01:25:55,268 --> 01:25:56,428
- Blood!
- Patience, I say.

1461
01:25:56,588 --> 01:26:00,028
- Your mind perhaps may change.
- Never, lago.

1462
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:01,628
Like to the Pontic sea...

1463
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:05,307
...whose icy current and compulsive
course ne'er feels retiring ebb...

1464
01:26:05,467 --> 01:26:08,747
...but keeps due on to the
Propontic and the Hellespont...

1465
01:26:08,907 --> 01:26:12,187
...even so my bloody
thoughts, with violent pace...

1466
01:26:12,347 --> 01:26:17,346
...shall ne'er look back,
ne'er ebb to humble...

1467
01:26:19,226 --> 01:26:21,106
...love...

1468
01:26:22,066 --> 01:26:26,625
...till that a capable and
wide revenge swallow them up.

1469
01:26:27,145 --> 01:26:30,545
Now, by yond marble heaven...

1470
01:26:30,705 --> 01:26:34,505
...in the due reverence of a
sacred vow, I here engage my words.

1471
01:26:34,665 --> 01:26:37,064
Do not rise yet. Witness,
ever-burning lights above...

1472
01:26:37,224 --> 01:26:40,104
...you elements that clip us
round about, witness that here...

1473
01:26:40,264 --> 01:26:43,704
...lago doth give up the execution
of his wit, hands, heart...

1474
01:26:43,864 --> 01:26:45,543
...to wronged othello's service.

1475
01:26:45,703 --> 01:26:48,743
Let him command and to obey
shall be in me remorse...

1476
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:52,543
...what bloody work soever.

1477
01:26:54,903 --> 01:26:56,822
I greet thy love...

1478
01:26:56,982 --> 01:26:59,982
...not with vain thanks, but
with acceptance bounteous.

1479
01:27:00,142 --> 01:27:02,622
And will upon the instant put thee to't.

1480
01:27:02,782 --> 01:27:06,621
Within these three days,
let me hear thee say...

1481
01:27:06,781 --> 01:27:09,301
...that Cassio is not alive.

1482
01:27:09,501 --> 01:27:14,341
My friend is dead, 'tis done as
you request. But let her live.

1483
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:18,980
[YELLS]

1484
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:21,380
Damn her, lewd minx!

1485
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:24,500
O, damn her! Damn her.
Come, go with me apart.

1486
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:29,019
I will go furnish me with some swift

I know not, madam.

1494
01:28:09,918 --> 01:28:13,357
Believe me, I had rather lose
my purse full of crusadoes.

1495
01:28:13,517 --> 01:28:16,637
And, but my noble Moor is true of

- Is he not jealous?
- Who, he?

I think the sun where he was born
drew all such humors from him.

1582
01:32:43,732 --> 01:32:46,772
I have seen the cannon when it
hath blown his ranks into the air...

1583
01:32:46,932 --> 01:32:49,732
...and like the devil from his

And is he angry?

1585

- There's matter in't indeed if he
be angry. DESDEMoNA: I prithee do so.

either from venice...

demonstrable here in Cyprus to him...

...hath puddled his clear spirit.

1590
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:11,010
And in such cases, men's natures
wrangle with inferior things...

1591

And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.

01:34:48,361 --> 01:34:52,481
What, keep a week away?
Seven days and nights?

1618
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:55,000
- Eight score eight hours?
- Shh! Oh!

1619
01:34:55,160 --> 01:35:00,800
And lovers' absent hours more tedious
than the dial eight score times?

01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:04,599
- O, weary reckoning.
- Pardon me, Bianca.

leaden thoughts been pressed.

01:35:07,479 --> 01:35:12,879
But I shall in a more convenient
time strike off this score of absence.

1623
01:35:14,798 --> 01:35:18,318
Sweet Bianca, make me this work out.

1624
01:35:18,918 --> 01:35:20,598
Cassio, whence came this?

1625
01:35:20,758 --> 01:35:22,918
I know not, sweet. I found it in my chamber.

1626
01:35:23,078 --> 01:35:27,277
I like the work well. Ere it be demanded...
As like enough it will.... I'd have it copied.

1627
01:35:27,437 --> 01:35:29,477
Take it, do't and leave me for this time.

1628

01:35:42,116 --> 01:35:44,116
Will you think so?

1630
01:35:46,835 --> 01:35:48,395
Think so, lago?

1631
01:35:48,595 --> 01:35:51,315
What, to kiss in private?

1632
01:35:51,475 --> 01:35:53,235
An unauthorized kiss.

1633
01:35:53,395 --> 01:35:58,314
Or to be naked with her friend in bed
an hour or more, not meaning any harm?

1634
01:35:58,514 --> 01:36:02,954
Naked in bed, lago, and not mean harm?
It is hypocrisy against the devil.

1635
01:36:03,114 --> 01:36:06,874
They that mean virtuously and yet do
so, the devil their virtue tempts...

1636
01:36:07,034 --> 01:36:08,513
...and they tempt heaven.

1637
01:36:08,673 --> 01:36:14,673
So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.

1638
01:36:14,833 --> 01:36:17,553
But if I give my wife a handkerchief...

1639
01:36:17,713 --> 01:36:19,113
What then?

1640
01:36:19,672 --> 01:36:20,992
Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord.

1641
01:36:21,152 --> 01:36:24,072
And, being hers, she may, I
think, bestow't on any man.

1642
01:36:24,232 --> 01:36:26,792
She is protectress of her
honor too. May she give that?

1643
01:36:26,992 --> 01:36:29,232
Her honor is an essence that's not seen.

1644
01:36:29,392 --> 01:36:31,231
They have it very oft that have it not.

1645
01:36:31,391 --> 01:36:33,711
- But for the handkerchief...
- oh!

1646
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:37,111
By heaven, I would most
gladly have forgot it.

1647
01:36:37,271 --> 01:36:39,511
Thou said'st... o, it comes o'er my memory...

1648
01:36:39,671 --> 01:36:43,670
...as doth the raven o'er the
infected house, boding to all.

01:36:43,830 --> 01:36:45,030

01:56:21,922 --> 01:56:25,321
Why, he that is yours, sweet lady.

1978
01:56:25,481 --> 01:56:29,241
I have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia.

1979
01:56:29,641 --> 01:56:35,160
I cannot weep, nor answer have I
none, but what should go by water.

1980
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:39,480
Prithee, tonight lay on my
bed our wedding sheets...

1981
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,800
...remember...

1982
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,919
...and call thy husband hither.

1983
01:56:47,799 --> 01:56:50,719
Here is a change indeed.

1984
01:56:52,119 --> 01:56:57,238
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.

1985
01:56:57,758 --> 01:56:58,918
How have I been behaved...

1986
01:56:59,078 --> 01:57:03,198
...that he might stick the
smallest opinion on my least misuse?

1987
01:57:04,318 --> 01:57:06,677
What is your pleasure,
madam? How is't with you?

1988
01:57:06,877 --> 01:57:08,837
I cannot tell.

1989
01:57:08,997 --> 01:57:13,917
Those that do teach young babes do
it with gentle means and easy tasks.

1990
01:57:14,077 --> 01:57:17,716
He might have chid me so, for, in
good faith, I am a child at chiding.

1991
01:57:17,916 --> 01:57:19,156
What's the matter, lady?

1992
01:57:19,316 --> 01:57:21,276
Alas, lago, my lord hath so bewhored her...

1993
01:57:21,436 --> 01:57:24,916
...thrown such despite and heavy terms
upon her, as true hearts cannot bear.

1994
01:57:25,596 --> 01:57:27,036
Am I that name, lago?

1995
01:57:27,196 --> 01:57:28,555
What name, fair lady?

1996
01:57:28,715 --> 01:57:31,155
Such as she says my lord did say I was.

1997
01:57:31,355 --> 01:57:34,595
He called her whore. A beggar could not
have laid such terms upon his callet.

1998
01:57:34,755 --> 01:57:37,795
- Why did he so?
- I do not know.

1999
01:57:37,955 --> 01:57:39,874
I am sure I am none such.

2000
01:57:40,034 --> 01:57:44,794
O, do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day.

2001
01:57:44,954 --> 01:57:46,954
Hath she forsook so many noble matches...

2002
01:57:47,114 --> 01:57:49,794
...her father, her country,
her friends, to be called whore?

2003
01:57:49,953 --> 01:57:52,593
- Would it not make one weep?
- It is my wretched fortune.

2004
01:57:52,753 --> 01:57:56,233
O, beshrew him for't. How
comes this trick upon him?

2005
01:57:56,393 --> 01:57:57,553
Heaven doth know.

2006
01:57:57,753 --> 01:58:01,152
I will be hanged if some eternal villain,
some busy and insinuating rogue...

...some cozening slave to get some
office, have not devised this slander.

2008
01:58:04,792 --> 01:58:06,992
- I'll be hanged else.
- Fie, there is no such man.

2009
01:58:07,192 --> 01:58:08,112
It is impossible.

2010

DESDEMoNA: If any such
there be, heaven pardon him.

2011

A halter pardon him and hell gnaw his bones.

2012

whore? Who keeps her company?

what form, what likelihood?

2015

...some base notorious
knave, some scurvy fellow.

- Speak within door.
- O, fie.

your wit the seamy side without...

2018
01:58:29,390 --> 01:58:31,350
...and made you to suspect me with the Moor.

2019
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:32,590
You are a fool, go to.

2020
01:58:32,790 --> 01:58:35,469
O, good lago, what can I
do to win my lord again?

2021
01:58:35,629 --> 01:58:37,549
Good friend, go to him.

2022
01:58:37,709 --> 01:58:41,549
For, by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him.

thought or actual deed...

- Love him dearly, comfort forswear me.

2031

Unkindness may do much...

2032
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:13,306
...and his unkindness may defeat
my life, but never taint my love.

2033

I cannot say "whore."

2034
01:59:19,025 --> 01:59:22,945
It does abhor me now I speak the word.

To do the act that might the addition earn...

of vanity could make me.

With naught but truth.

I have wasted myself out of means.

The jewels you have had from
me to deliver to Desdemona...

2054

Yes, presently. Therefore
confess thee freely of thy sin.

2328

oath cannot remove nor choke...
