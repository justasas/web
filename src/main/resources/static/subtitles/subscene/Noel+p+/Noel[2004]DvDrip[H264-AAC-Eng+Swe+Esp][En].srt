1
00:01:07,195 --> 00:01:10,165
Merry Christmas.

2
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,399
Rose?

3
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:55,520
Debbie Carmichael?
Rose Harrison?

4
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:56,399
Oh, my gosh.

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,085
I haven't seen you since-

6
00:01:58,086 --> 00:01:59,706
High school, I'm sure.

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,548
How are ya?

8
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,538
Well, you know I married
Bobby Gidecki.

9
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:04,565
No.
Oh, my.

10
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,720
Four amazing kids.
Can you believe it?

11
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:08,806
But enough about me.
What about you?

12
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:09,848
Tell me everything.

13
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:11,597
I'm married.

14
00:02:11,685 --> 00:02:14,240
Hal, he's a lawyer
down on Wall Street.

15
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,818
Two girls, twins.

16
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:16,799
Aw.
Yeah.

17
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,493
Britney and Ashley.

18
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:20,235
And in less than-

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,756
oh, my gosh-
seven hours,

20
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:23,233
I've got to have
Christmas Eve dinner

21
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:25,964
for 35 friends and family,
so I got to go.

22
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:27,844
Oh, 35.
Oh.

23
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,876
Yeah, well,
it was nice to see you.

24
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:31,438
We should... get together.

25
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,930
Absolutely.
We're listed.

26
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:34,530
We're the only Gidecki
in Hartford.

27
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:36,015
I bet.

28
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,615
Oh, incredible to see you.

29
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:38,538
Yeah.

30
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,698
All right, well, I got to go.

31
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:40,703
Would you like to share a cab?

32
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,056
No, no, no,
I'm just going down here.

33
00:02:42,057 --> 00:02:43,374
Well, merry Christmas.
Same to you.

34
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,385
Unbelievable.

35
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,572
Hi, I was just wondering

36
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:12,613
what time your party started.

37
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:14,808
I beg your pardon.

38
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:16,221
You know, your Christmas party.

39
00:03:16,222 --> 00:03:17,199
What time does that start?

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,995
This is an emergency room,
not Radio City Music Hall.

41
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:22,757
But you usually have
a Christmas party, don't you?

42
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:23,766
Usually.

43
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:26,727
Patients only, though.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,251
You planning on being a patient?

45
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:31,216
You never know.

46
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:51,499
You look beautiful.
You really do.

47
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,362
Morning.

48
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:16,276
How ya doing?

49
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:21,757
Guess what I brought you.

50
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,932
All your favourites:

51
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:26,457
smoked salmon with capers

52
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,936
and Arugula salad

53
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,565
and a mousse cake for desert.

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,648
And what's the occasion,
you might ask yourself.

55
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:40,129
Well, I'll tell you.
Tomorrow's Christmas.

56
00:04:40,164 --> 00:04:41,394
And that means
that we get to spend

57
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:44,199
the whole day together,
just the two of us.

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,421
How about that, huh, Mom?

59
00:04:46,462 --> 00:04:49,509
Hm?

60
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:52,372
And you'll never guess
who I ran into.

61
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:53,774
Debbie Carmichael.

62
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:55,427
Yep, oh, Debbie Gidecki now.

63
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,431
She married Bobby.
Surprise, surprise.

64
00:04:57,432 --> 00:05:00,820
They have four kids,
a house in Connecticut

65
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:04,208
just filled with oodles
of joy and happiness.

66
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:05,368
I could have smacked her.

67
00:05:05,369 --> 00:05:06,409
Here, let's try some salmon.

68
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,556
Hm?

69
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,452
You love salmon, remember?

70
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,072
You know, you got to
keep your strength up, Mom.

71
00:05:13,073 --> 00:05:14,475
That means eating.

72
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:16,968
You haven't eaten
anything since yesterday.

73
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:19,929
Let's give a little salmon
a little try.

74
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:24,747
You don't get any dessert
if you don't try your salmon.

75
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:27,100
Come on.

76
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:28,709
Okay.

77
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:30,223
All right, all right, all right.

78
00:05:30,224 --> 00:05:32,455
Well, you know what?

79
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,023
We'll try again later, okay?

80
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,801
Look at this.

81
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:42,546
Look what I found:

82
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,985
an angel for your wreath.

83
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:49,789
How beautiful, huh?

84
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:50,656
Yep.

85
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:09,696
Oh.
Hello.

86
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:10,565
Oh, hi.

87
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,466
I didn't realize
anybody else was here.

88
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:13,826
Just me.

89
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:14,869
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:16,132
I just thought maybe

91
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:17,525
I'd cheer things up a little bit.

92
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:21,273
I felt bad 'cause he never
gets any visitors.

93
00:06:21,316 --> 00:06:22,712
It seems so sad.

94
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,501
Except you, of course,

95
00:06:24,588 --> 00:06:26,940
but I've never seen you before.

96
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:28,826
Not that you've never
been here before.

97
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:30,633
I'm sure you have;
it's just that I've...

98
00:06:30,634 --> 00:06:33,080
never seen you before.

99
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:34,825
It's an angel.

100
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:37,606
Yes, and very beautiful,
a renaissance angel.

101
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:38,702
Thank you.

102
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,007
It's very kind.

103
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:42,567
Oh, well,
it's Christmas, you know.

104
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,018
Merry Christmas.

105
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,195
Well, got to get going.

106
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,331
Excuse me.

107
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,776
Morning, Rose.

108
00:06:57,811 --> 00:06:58,953
Oh, Dr. Barrow.

109
00:06:58,996 --> 00:06:59,989
Good to see you.

110
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,824
You too.

111
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:03,006
Have you been in
to see your mother?

112
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:05,089
Oh, yes, we had a nice,
long visit, and you?

113
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,883
I was just on my way in.

114
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,530
Feeling okay
this morning, I hope.

115
00:07:08,531 --> 00:07:09,454
Oh, sure.

116
00:07:09,543 --> 00:07:10,804
I mean, I know it looks bad,

117
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,278
single woman over 40
at Christmastime,

118
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,421
but I'll be fine.

119
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:15,721
Just keep me away
from the kitchen knives

120
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:18,572
and open windows
for the next few days.

121
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,733
You meant my mother, didn't you?

122
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:22,529
Yes.

123
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,565
Oops.

124
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,646
Okay, bye.

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,059
Hey.

126
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,196
Hey, listen.

127
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:48,773
Hey, what do you say
I give you a ride?

128
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:50,263
Come on, I'm a cop.

129
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:51,652
You can trust me.

130
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:53,178
This is where I'm having lunch.

131
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:54,877
Then let me
take you round the block.

132
00:07:54,878 --> 00:07:57,264
I'll bring you right back
where I found you; I promise.

133
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,544
Oh, I've been around the block.

134
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,672
Ain't nothing
I haven't seen before.

135
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:04,881
Well, then marry me.

136
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:06,486
I'll take you anywhere
you want to go.

137
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,374
Don't tell me a man like you

138
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,598
isn't already married.

139
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,386
I've been holding out.

140
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:14,923
Oh, yeah?
For what?

141
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,338
For you.

142
00:08:16,425 --> 00:08:17,866
Oh.

143
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,982
Okay. But let's make it fast.
I get bored easily,

144
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,590
and I only have
an hour for lunch.

145
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,551
Do you know how much I love you,

146
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:40,466
Ms. Nina Vasquez,
about to be Mrs. Riley?

147
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:42,309
No.

148
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:45,101
How much?

149
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:48,285
More than you ever know.

150
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,848
Enough to learn
how to dance with me?

151
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:52,079
Not right now.

152
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:53,828
Please.
Not right now.

153
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,578
You're gonna have to
dance with me at the wedding.

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,095
Morning.
Morning.

155
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:07,620
Or should I say afternoon.

156
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:09,969
Did you type up
the Sulley/Seth revisions?

157
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,419
Yes, I put them on your desk.

158
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,426
Great.

159
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,903
And merry Christmas.

160
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:14,953
Ooh.

161
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,565
If you hate it,
you can return it.

162
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:18,259
I'm sure I'll love it.

163
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,882
I'm sure you'll return it.

164
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:22,373
Your sister called, and she can't

165
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,161
spend Christmas Eve
with you after all.

166
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:26,505
Seems it's too painful
since your father died,

167
00:09:26,506 --> 00:09:28,000
so she's spending the next week

168
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:30,915
meditating with Buddhist monks
in the Catskills.

169
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,747
Good for her.
Also, your ex-husband called.

170
00:09:32,748 --> 00:09:34,025
Wanted to know if you would like

171
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:36,153
to spend tonight with him
and his beautiful wife

172
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:38,013
and their two perfect kids
in Connecticut.

173
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:39,186
And... oh, finally,
your shrink called.

174
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:41,158
She's got to cancel
your session today

175
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,563
because her husband surprised her

176
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:45,083
with a fabulous trip
to Paris for Christmas.

177
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,453
That's... all?

178
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:48,760
It rang a couple more times,

179
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:51,326
but I was scared for you,
so I stopped answering it.

180
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:53,426
What's so funny?

181
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:56,649
Oh, it just struck me
as being funny

182
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:58,394
that a, you know, a woman

183
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:00,829
who's never had a child
is editing a children's book

184
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,576
when maybe
it would be more appropriate

185
00:10:02,577 --> 00:10:05,032
for me to work on Cooking For One

186
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:06,169
or, you know,

187
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:08,873
How to Survive
the Holidays Alone.

188
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,138
Don't look at me that way.

189
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:11,019
I'm fine.

190
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:12,264
Do you want my advice?

191
00:10:12,265 --> 00:10:12,999
No.

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,054
You've been looking
after your mother for...

193
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:16,748
nearly ten years now, right?

194
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:17,802
Yeah.
Before that,

195
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:19,898
you were looking after
your father

196
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,724
and also your husband,
who walked out on you

197
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:23,514
the day your mother
came to live with you,

198
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:24,508
and let's not forget-

199
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:25,433
What is the point?

200
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:27,224
It's time that you stop

201
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:28,971
taking care of everybody else

202
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:30,486
and start thinking
about yourself.

203
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:33,095
As my nana used to say,
what you need is-

204
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:34,616
I know; I know. Someone to
take care of me for a change.

205
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:38,617
Wrong, what you need is sex.
Good sex.

206
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:41,752
Your nana said that?
Yes, she did.

207
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,932
And by the way,

208
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,239
Marco has been
looking for you again.

209
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,476
Hm?

210
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,489
He is so tenacious.

211
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:50,847
That guy is sexy.

212
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:52,763
He's too young for me.

213
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:54,893
Every woman
in the building wants him.

214
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:56,085
Not me.

215
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:57,776
I just want some coffee.

216
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:59,534
Coffee it is.

217
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:02,561
Please, Rose,
sleep with him for me.

218
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,551
No.

219
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:05,615
You can tell me all the details.

220
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:06,933
I'll love it.
No.

221
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,943
Coffee.
Just get coffee.

222
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,425
Geez.

223
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:11,694
Okay, okay.

224
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,360
Nina, no.

225
00:11:18,405 --> 00:11:19,574
No, I got to go.

226
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:20,838
I can't be late.

227
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,428
Listen, Dennis is waiting
for me, all right?

228
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:27,230
I got to go.

229
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,786
I can't be late.

230
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,362
I was beginning to worry.

231
00:12:37,363 --> 00:12:38,899
Absent from work yesterday

232
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,367
and apparent
no-show today,

233
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,153
thought maybe
you'd run off to Tahiti

234
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:43,297
and gotten married on me.

235
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:44,665
I'd never do a thing like that

236
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,998
without checking with you first.

237
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:46,972
Of course.

238
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:49,331
So when are we going to dinner?

239
00:12:50,121 --> 00:12:52,865
Don't you have deadlines
or something?

240
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:54,252
Hey, I got to eat.

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,278
Okay.

242
00:12:58,367 --> 00:12:59,545
When?

243
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:02,303
Uh, well...

244
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:05,362
Tonight?

245
00:13:06,983 --> 00:13:09,640
It's Christmas Eve,
so I figure you must have-

246
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:12,623
No, no, no, no.
Nothing.

247
00:13:13,714 --> 00:13:15,420
Okay, let's do it.

248
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:16,737
Okay.
Tonight.

249
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:18,354
Yeah.

250
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:19,929
After work.

251
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:21,853
Yeah, it's a date.

252
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:23,557
Okay.

253
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,597
Those earrings new?

254
00:13:35,632 --> 00:13:36,956
Yeah.

255
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:37,965
Cute, huh?

256
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,213
They were a gift.

257
00:13:39,214 --> 00:13:41,765
From who?

258
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:44,916
Mr. Brenner.
Mr. Brenner?

259
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:47,143
Is that normal, lawyers giving gifts
to paralegals?

260
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:48,905
Uh-huh.

261
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:51,795
Mm-hm.

262
00:13:53,148 --> 00:13:54,484
Don't start, Mike.

263
00:13:54,552 --> 00:13:56,128
What?

264
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,899
You know,
some women would be flattered.

265
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,993
Of what, that the man
they were about to marry

266
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:02,131
was a jealous psycho?

267
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,805
Yeah.

268
00:14:09,143 --> 00:14:10,931
See you at home tonight, okay?

269
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:12,781
Okay.

270
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,149
Hey, I love you.

271
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,323
Excuse me,
can I ask you for a Coke?

272
00:14:48,324 --> 00:14:49,517
Sure thing.

273
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:50,789
So anyway, so my plan

274
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,881
is to spend Christmas
in the hospital.

275
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:54,199
I know that sounds strange.

276
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,304
I mean, the hospital's
probably the last place

277
00:14:56,305 --> 00:14:59,228
anybody would want to be,
especially this time of year.

278
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:00,115
Thanks.

279
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:01,341
But see, the thing is,

280
00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:03,828
see, out of all the Christmases
I've ever had,

281
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:05,617
the only one
that was halfway decent

282
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:07,341
was the Christmas where I was 14.

283
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:09,741
I busted my nose open
in this sledding accident.

284
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,104
They made me spend
the whole day at the hospital.

285
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:13,721
That's a shame.
No, but it wasn't.

286
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,263
That's what I'm trying
to tell you,

287
00:15:15,264 --> 00:15:17,448
because they threw
this killer Christmas party

288
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,200
where the nurses
were dressed as elves,

289
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:20,642
and they were singing songs,

290
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:22,061
and they were handing out eggnog

291
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:23,605
with a little bit of booze in it,

292
00:15:23,606 --> 00:15:25,109
and they even made
little presents,

293
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,688
which was really cool.

294
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:28,131
That was awesome.

295
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:30,760
That was the best time
I ever had.

296
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:35,140
I know.

297
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:35,999
What-
I...

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,314
I know.
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:38,995
You know what cup
of coffee this is?

300
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:40,637
Number four.
Where the hell you been?

301
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:42,530
Wedding plans, you know.

302
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:44,665
Just one cup, I promise,
and we're out of here.

303
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,297
What can I get you?

304
00:15:46,387 --> 00:15:48,445
Just coffee.

305
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,758
Oh, hi.

306
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:52,608
Hi.

307
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,053
Just coffee,
and we're in a bit of a hurry.

308
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,552
Okay.

309
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,007
What was that all about?

310
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:03,271
I don't know.
Beats me.

311
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:04,685
You know the guy?

312
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:06,467
No, I never laid eyes
on him before.

313
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:07,441
You sure?

314
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,162
Yeah, I'm sure.

315
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:11,979
Because he's looking at you
with that, you know, like...

316
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,050
it's, like, weird,
you know what I'm saying?

317
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:15,994
No, what are you saying?

318
00:16:16,082 --> 00:16:17,342
Okay, here you go.

319
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,533
Here's your coffee.

320
00:16:18,534 --> 00:16:20,263
I had a feeling
you'd want it black.

321
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:21,808
Right, black.

322
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:24,172
And I got you
almond butter cookies.

323
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:26,708
Almond butter cookies,
those are my favourite.

324
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:29,188
I know.

325
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,649
Ah, he's got a thing for ya.

326
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,960
Come on.
Cut it out.

327
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,764
Come on; his eyes
are all over you.

328
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,699
And that silly smile.
I know that smile. I've used it.

329
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,706
Ah, you're crazy. He's just one
of those real nice guys. You know.

330
00:16:42,707 --> 00:16:45,300
He's like Greek or something.
They're always hugging and kissing.

331
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:47,666
- Or maybe, he seems kinda slow.
- No no, he's not slow Mikey.

332
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,900
I think the guy's got a
thing for two guys in uniform.

333
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:50,966
You know what I'm saying.

334
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:54,266
Two guys?
Nah, he was looking at me, not you.

335
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:55,632
Nah, he was looking at me too.

336
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:57,466
Nah, he wasn't looking
anywhere near you.

337
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:59,126
What are you saying
Mikey? Tha-that guys...

338
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:00,866
...don't notice me? Is
that what you're saying?

339
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,475
Tha-that I walk down the street and...

340
00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:04,634
...guys don't turn their
head to take look at me?

341
00:17:04,635 --> 00:17:05,666
No, I'm not saying that at all.

342
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,097
I just think the guy's interested
in me and not you.

343
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:09,332
Oh.

344
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:12,600
What am I saying?
Just... forget about it all right.

345
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:14,101
Fine he's all yours.

346
00:17:14,605 --> 00:17:15,766
Come on. Stop it.

347
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,866
You two gonna go
furniture shopping together?

348
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,547
I said forget about it!

349
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:25,499
I'm gonna straighten this out
right now.

350
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,234
All right, Mikey.
All right. All right.

351
00:17:26,235 --> 00:17:27,061
Calm down now.

352
00:17:27,062 --> 00:17:28,143
Come on;
come on.

353
00:17:28,144 --> 00:17:29,191
Now, you're a cop, for Christ sake.

354
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:30,199
Now cut it out.

355
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,834
Easy with that famous temper.

356
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:33,799
Come on now.
You're a cop, okay?

357
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,950
Your turkey club's up,
Artie.

358
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,670
You got my money?

359
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:39,802
Not yet.

360
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,578
Aw, come on, Jules, look,

361
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:43,003
if you want to meet Arizona,

362
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:44,361
I have to get paid first.

363
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:45,732
Look, you know
I'm good for it, right?

364
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,241
I just got to go do
this one thing,

365
00:17:47,242 --> 00:17:48,881
so why don't you
tell me where to meet you,

366
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:50,184
and I'll bring you the money.

367
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:51,345
All right, look.

368
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,874
Meet me at the old theatre

369
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:55,643
on Avenue A
at about 10:00, all right?

370
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:57,684
But don't go in without me.

371
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:58,895
You wait for me.

372
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,248
Why?

373
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:03,341
Oh, you don't want
to surprise a guy

374
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:05,034
like Arizona;
that's why.

375
00:18:05,035 --> 00:18:05,785
All right.

376
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,228
Well, Glen, you know

377
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:09,749
I really appreciate this, right?

378
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:11,816
It's Christmastime, man.

379
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,400
- Can we meet later?
- What?

380
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,999
I get off at 9. Can we get together?
I mean it's been so long.

381
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,888
- So long since what?
- Since you and I...

382
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:24,119
- What?
- Since you...

383
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,499
Now wait a minute, I don't know you.
Now you'd better cut this out...

384
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,768
- Mikey, Mikey, Mikey. Wait outside.
- Well you'd better straighten this out.

385
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:31,299
All right, all right, I'll handle it.
Wait outside, ok?

386
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,529
- Hey don't...
- Hey buddy, do you want to get locked up?

387
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,799
- No.
- Stop hassling my friend will you please?

388
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,899
You don't understand,
it's been such a long time...

389
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,926
Hey, hey, hey... enough! Ok?
You've got the wrong guy. Stop it!

390
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:47,000
Ok?!

391
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,493
He never has any visitors,

392
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:07,574
not even family.

393
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:09,090
Oh, except for this one guy

394
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:10,472
that was there this morning,

395
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:11,815
but I've never seen him before,

396
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:12,899
and I just-
I don't know.

397
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,826
I wish there was something
I could do, you know.

398
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:16,685
To be sick and alone
and during the holidays,

399
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:18,806
it's awful.

400
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:20,596
You know, that's what
I like about you, Rose.

401
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:24,470
- What?
- You care about other people.

402
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:26,246
You know, I have to say

403
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:28,252
that I-
I'm...

404
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:31,467
Well, I just don't feel
like I'm really your type.

405
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:36,796
I think you should
let me decide that.

406
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:41,434
I'm a little uncomfortable
with you, Marco, sometimes.

407
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:43,488
Let's just relax
and have fun, Rose.

408
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:45,127
Okay.

409
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:46,875
Good, because that's all
I really want to do...

410
00:19:46,876 --> 00:19:49,786
...is just have some fun.
- Hey, me too.

411
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,428
Didn't I tell you?

412
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:55,456
Best pizza in the city.

413
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:56,361
Mm, mm.

414
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:57,552
It's very good.

415
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,811
This place has been here forever.

416
00:19:58,812 --> 00:20:02,363
On the weekends,
there's a line around the block.

417
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,595
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

418
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:12,071
Or do you have a girlfriend?

419
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:13,012
Well, I did,

420
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,150
but we broke up a few months ago.

421
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:17,515
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

422
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,405
Don't be.
It was good that it happened.

423
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:20,726
Why was it good that it happened?

424
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:21,968
Ooh, hold it.
What?

425
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:22,812
Cheese.

426
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:24,173
Cheese?

427
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:26,399
Yeah, on the side of your mouth.

428
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,036
Oh, God.

429
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:29,753
No, let me do it.

430
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,867
So now that I've saved you
from Tony's pizza-

431
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:47,613
what shall we do now?

432
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:51,165
Um...

433
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,776
You want to see a movie?

434
00:20:52,777 --> 00:20:55,624
No, not really.

435
00:20:57,814 --> 00:20:59,965
Want to walk somewhere?

436
00:21:00,054 --> 00:21:02,584
Yeah, but it's getting cold.

437
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:04,643
Don't you live around here?

438
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,600
Yes.

439
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,864
Well, we could, uh,
go back to your place,

440
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:12,920
maybe have a nightcap.

441
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:16,663
Um...

442
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:18,426
Marco, I-I...

443
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:20,780
Rose, we work together
in the same building.

444
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:22,285
What's the big deal?

445
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:26,035
You know me,

446
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,883
and it's Christmas Eve.

447
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,922
I don't have any...
real liquor.

448
00:21:32,923 --> 00:21:34,435
I just have eggnog.

449
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,942
No, I love eggnog.

450
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:37,400
Let's do it.

451
00:21:42,046 --> 00:21:43,423
Okay.

452
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:46,643
Okay.

453
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,993
Do you have family in the city?

454
00:22:00,994 --> 00:22:01,903
No.

455
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:03,830
My family's all down in Florida,

456
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:05,444
so it's just me here.

457
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,571
Great place.

458
00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:09,845
You live here all by yourself?

459
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:11,582
It's my mother's house.

460
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,120
Well, here we are.

461
00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:18,422
I'll get the eggnog.

462
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:20,357
You know, Rose.

463
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:22,004
I find you very sexy.

464
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:24,263
Thank you.

465
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,482
I'm gonna get the nog.

466
00:22:31,189 --> 00:22:33,163
You're not attracted to me?

467
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:38,884
No, um...

468
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:40,518
I'm attracted to you.

469
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,838
But this, you know,
it's going a little fast for me.

470
00:22:45,924 --> 00:22:47,645
Okay.

471
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,443
Let's just start with a kiss.

472
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:51,120
All you have to do is say stop,

473
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,684
and I promise I will.

474
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:58,441
Okay.

475
00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:02,528
You promise?

476
00:23:02,574 --> 00:23:04,976
Yes.

477
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,593
Okay, stop.

478
00:23:22,636 --> 00:23:25,260
All right,
that was a little quick.

479
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:28,572
Yeah, I know it was,
but I'm-I...

480
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:30,064
How long has it been, Rose?

481
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,154
What?

482
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:34,110
How long it's been
since you've been on a date.

483
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:35,021
Um...

484
00:23:35,106 --> 00:23:37,476
You're a very beautiful woman.

485
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:39,840
You should be with someone.

486
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:41,091
Someone like me.

487
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,714
You know, you work all the time.

488
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,393
I never see you go out, you know.

489
00:23:45,394 --> 00:23:47,512
You got to live a little.

490
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:49,266
Life ain't that bad, Rose.

491
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:51,240
You just got to lighten up.

492
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:54,092
Relax.

493
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:57,321
Oh, gosh, I just, uh...

494
00:23:57,364 --> 00:23:59,290
It's just not working for me.

495
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,365
What did I say?

496
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,763
Someone tells me
to lighten up and relax,

497
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:08,038
I just tighten up and get tense.

498
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:09,930
Hey, I just thought
we could have a good time.

499
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:12,044
Yeah, me too, but...

500
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:13,714
I was just trying
to make you feel better.

501
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:17,338
I know;
I know.

502
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:18,973
It didn't, though.

503
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,750
I see.

504
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,342
I guess I better go.

505
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,470
Yeah.

506
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,347
Okay.

507
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:31,471
I'm sorry.

508
00:24:31,515 --> 00:24:32,589
No, no, no, I'm sorry.

509
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,213
I was too forward.
I was wrong.

510
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:36,008
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

511
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,830
It's not you.
It's me.

512
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,028
You're right, Rose.
It is you.

513
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,600
Merry Christmas, Rose.

514
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:48,863
Merry Christmas.

515
00:24:48,906 --> 00:24:50,409
Yeah.

516
00:25:05,736 --> 00:25:07,200
Hey, you okay?

517
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:09,567
My stomach is a little nauseous.

518
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,255
I think I'm just stressed out.

519
00:25:12,288 --> 00:25:14,792
Nina, can you please just relax?

520
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,009
Look, it's the glam rock look.

521
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:23,145
Hey.

522
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:26,564
What are you doing home so early?

523
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,586
You must be Mike.

524
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:30,045
Surprise.

525
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,691
What are you doing?

526
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:33,844
This was for you, you idiot.

527
00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:34,776
He hit my lip.

528
00:25:34,777 --> 00:25:37,229
What's going on
with this guy, Nina?

529
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,703
You can clean up here.

530
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,140
What the hell is he doing
in the apartment?

531
00:25:40,141 --> 00:25:41,061
You have a serious problem.

532
00:25:41,062 --> 00:25:42,187
Oh, I got a problem?

533
00:25:42,188 --> 00:25:43,595
What's he doing in the apartment?

534
00:25:43,596 --> 00:25:45,288
Are you insane?

535
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:46,847
Who is that guy, Nina?

536
00:25:46,848 --> 00:25:48,385
This guy's my friend!

537
00:25:48,386 --> 00:25:50,532
He was helping me
to prepare a surprise for you.

538
00:25:50,533 --> 00:25:51,992
What kind of surprise?

539
00:25:51,993 --> 00:25:53,615
He's a tree decorator!

540
00:25:54,545 --> 00:25:56,131
All right, look,
I'm sorry, all right?

541
00:25:56,132 --> 00:25:57,632
I made a mistake.
You know what?

542
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,543
You always make a mistake.

543
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:01,381
Last week, you started
a fight on the street

544
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:03,139
because you thought a guy
was looking at me.

545
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,002
He was looking-
So what!

546
00:26:04,003 --> 00:26:05,485
Men look at me.

547
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:06,650
Get over it.

548
00:26:06,684 --> 00:26:08,661
All right, look,
I'm sorry, all right?

549
00:26:08,662 --> 00:26:09,856
It was just a misunderstanding.

550
00:26:09,857 --> 00:26:10,993
It's just driving me crazy.

551
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:12,576
I saw the two of you
talking today-

552
00:26:12,577 --> 00:26:13,663
Talking when?

553
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,170
When I dropped you off
at work today.

554
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:17,054
I dropped you off at the office,
and I saw you guys.

555
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:18,440
Do you spy on me?

556
00:26:18,527 --> 00:26:19,814
No, I don't spy on you.

557
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:21,159
Listen to me.

558
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,745
I just-I saw
the two of you talking, okay?

559
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:24,854
And then the next thing I know,
you're hugging and kissing

560
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:26,240
on each other...

561
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:28,688
It was innocent, all right,
believe me, completely.

562
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:29,410
She was thanking me.

563
00:26:29,411 --> 00:26:30,263
Thanking you for what?

564
00:26:30,264 --> 00:26:31,059
This is insane.

565
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,477
Look, I can clear everything up.

566
00:26:32,478 --> 00:26:33,594
Oh, that's not the point.

567
00:26:33,595 --> 00:26:34,595
I'm gay.

568
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:39,934
All right?

569
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,567
Nina, look, I'm sorry.

570
00:26:48,657 --> 00:26:50,166
I'm sorry.
Come on.

571
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,519
Mr. Calvert.

572
00:27:10,604 --> 00:27:11,812
Mr. Calvert!

573
00:27:11,855 --> 00:27:13,319
Mr. Calvert,
your rent is due.

574
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,897
Mr. Calvert,
I evict you if I have to.

575
00:27:15,898 --> 00:27:17,379
I evict you!

576
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,887
Yeah, but she told me
she was gonna stay with you.

577
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,372
I don't know.

578
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:35,656
Yeah, I don't know.
Look, uh...

579
00:28:35,657 --> 00:28:38,229
Look, just tell her
I called, okay?

580
00:28:38,264 --> 00:28:40,603
And tell her I love her.

581
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:42,549
And, uh...

582
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,889
And, uh...

583
00:28:49,014 --> 00:28:50,482
Tell her I'm sorry.

584
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:56,391
Bye.

585
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,845
What the hell are you doing here?

586
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:03,242
I need to see you.

587
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:03,999
I have to talk to you.

588
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,061
Look, pal, you picked
a bad day to mess with me.

589
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:07,358
Now, you obviously
got me mixed up

590
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,574
with somebody else.

591
00:29:08,575 --> 00:29:10,010
I just need
ten minutes of your time.

592
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:11,379
I'm not gonna give you
ten seconds.

593
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,181
You beat it.
- Ten minutes, that's all I ask.

594
00:29:13,182 --> 00:29:14,438
I'll explain everything to you,

595
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:15,964
and then I won't
bother you anymore.

596
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:17,450
Look, it's Christmas Eve,
all right?

597
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:18,623
Don't you have someplace to be,

598
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,260
family waiting
for you or something?

599
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:25,252
What do you want from me?

600
00:29:25,253 --> 00:29:27,456
Ten minutes.

601
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:30,481
Please.

602
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:32,173
All right, come on.
Ten minutes.

603
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:33,324
Let's go quick.

604
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,628
This is for you.

605
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:45,801
It's not much.

606
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:47,872
Just something I wanted to...

607
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,151
It's a little, uh...

608
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:49,989
Thanks.

609
00:29:50,075 --> 00:29:51,327
Take a seat.

610
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,803
Could I have
something warm to drink?

611
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:59,708
Yeah, you want some coffee?

612
00:29:59,754 --> 00:30:01,251
Yeah, that would be
very kind of you.

613
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:02,296
Thanks.

614
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:04,757
Listen,

615
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,260
I didn't mean
to frighten you before.

616
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:07,539
I hope I didn't.

617
00:30:07,608 --> 00:30:10,319
It's just I was afraid
I was never gonna see you again.

618
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,450
Look, you know, it's obvious

619
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:12,959
you got me mixed up
with somebody else.

620
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,980
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on here.

621
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,449
Nothing person, uh, Mister...

622
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,010
Artie.

623
00:30:24,874 --> 00:30:25,955
Mm.

624
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,048
Almond butter cookies.

625
00:30:34,092 --> 00:30:35,821
Your favourite, right?

626
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,593
Right.

627
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:41,312
May I have one?

628
00:30:42,995 --> 00:30:45,923
Yeah, sure.

629
00:31:37,445 --> 00:31:38,398
Emilio, ven.

630
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,783
Ayuda, ayuda.

631
00:31:44,597 --> 00:31:46,319
Oh.

632
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,099
So heavy.

633
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,118
Thank you.

634
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,888
Hello, familia.

635
00:31:55,922 --> 00:31:57,529
Tengo hambre.

636
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,318
Are you all right?

637
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:08,046
Mm-hm.

638
00:32:11,078 --> 00:32:13,457
I might be pregnant.

639
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,099
Oh.
Congratulations.

640
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:18,651
Thank you.

641
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:21,507
But actually,
I just left my fiancé

642
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,658
who I am supposed to marry
in one week

643
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:25,625
and who I love very, very much

644
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:27,515
but who is a jealous psychopath

645
00:32:27,516 --> 00:32:30,579
who thinks that every guy
wants to sleep with me

646
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,573
and who drives me crazy.

647
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,401
You must think
I'm some crazy person,

648
00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:39,495
blurting all this out.

649
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,499
Oh, no, no.
Not at all.

650
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,734
You know, because I'm
a blurter myself.

651
00:32:43,735 --> 00:32:45,681
Sometimes, you know,
you just have to

652
00:32:45,682 --> 00:32:47,584
get it out
so that you can figure out

653
00:32:47,585 --> 00:32:48,939
what to do.

654
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:50,357
Thank you.

655
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,646
I'm Nina, by the way.

656
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:57,453
Nice to meet you.

657
00:32:57,498 --> 00:32:58,665
Rose.

658
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,760
Uncle Pedro's friend
from Pittsburgh, right?

659
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,141
Dinner's ready.
Let's go inside.

660
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,513
Do I look like I've been crying?

661
00:33:09,514 --> 00:33:11,588
No, no, no, you look beautiful.

662
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,433
I really-
I can't-

663
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:15,268
Let's go have some fun.

664
00:33:15,355 --> 00:33:16,907
I have to go.
I really-

665
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:18,087
Nina, por favor.

666
00:33:18,131 --> 00:33:20,781
I could use a hand inside.
Come on.

667
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,099
Oh, please...

668
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:24,833
Thank you.

669
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:28,208
Cariño,
pasamé ese plato.

670
00:33:28,294 --> 00:33:31,204
Maria, come on.
Everyone's at the table.

671
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,892
Um, maybe there's somewhere
I could use the bathroom?

672
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:37,975
Oh, yeah, right behind you.

673
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,718
Thanks.
Thank you.

674
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,107
A ver, venga.

675
00:33:41,192 --> 00:33:42,911
A comer.

676
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,027
Why not?

677
00:33:59,236 --> 00:34:00,751
Yeah, okay.

678
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,500
¿No es ella?

679
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,455
Wait, Rose.

680
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:33,666
Rose, wait.

681
00:34:33,753 --> 00:34:35,962
Oh, I'm so sorry, really.

682
00:34:35,997 --> 00:34:37,283
That was so stupid.

683
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,888
Stay with us please.
Please stay with us.

684
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:40,923
- Tell your-
- Please come back inside.

685
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:43,243
- Tell your family I am so sorry.
- Sorry for what?

686
00:34:43,244 --> 00:34:44,813
For crashing
your Christmas dinner.

687
00:34:44,814 --> 00:34:45,728
For trespassing.

688
00:34:45,729 --> 00:34:46,856
For breaking and entering.

689
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:48,403
For being just...
crazy.

690
00:34:48,404 --> 00:34:51,184
Please come back inside.
We'll make room.

691
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:53,747
- That is so sweet, but I am...
- Please.

692
00:34:53,748 --> 00:34:57,958
I don't... I don't fit in.

693
00:35:05,393 --> 00:35:07,277
Me neither.

694
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:09,762
Not tonight.

695
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,661
I know a place around the corner.

696
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:14,605
Maybe we can go there and talk.

697
00:35:14,606 --> 00:35:17,001
They're gonna miss you.

698
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:18,565
Yeah.

699
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,243
I'll come back.

700
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:22,548
Okay?

701
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:24,928
You're crazier than I am.

702
00:35:25,014 --> 00:35:26,395
Come on, it's freezing.

703
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:27,955
It's so cold.

704
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,486
I know he loves me,

705
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:53,119
and he's a great guy
with a huge heart.

706
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,462
Otherwise,
I wouldn't be with him,

707
00:35:55,463 --> 00:35:56,899
but he's just so-

708
00:35:56,934 --> 00:35:58,405
Controlling?

709
00:35:58,493 --> 00:36:00,565
Yes, controlling.

710
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,451
He doesn't have faith
in what we have,

711
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:03,387
how we feel.

712
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:04,888
He won't trust it.

713
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,244
I mean, I find myself praying

714
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:10,678
that he will change,
but I don't know anymore.

715
00:36:11,407 --> 00:36:13,919
I mean, we're supposed
to get married in one week.

716
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,616
This is it.
This is forever.

717
00:36:16,703 --> 00:36:18,997
And I can't live like this.

718
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,639
But I can't picture my life
without him either.

719
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,561
You love him very much.

720
00:36:23,604 --> 00:36:26,200
Yeah, so much.

721
00:36:26,244 --> 00:36:27,373
We even decided

722
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:29,316
that we were gonna try
to have a baby

723
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:31,936
since we just got the apartment.

724
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:34,556
We both want a baby very badly.

725
00:36:34,642 --> 00:36:36,893
Even though it's a long shot.

726
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:38,284
I thought you were pregnant.

727
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:39,716
Yeah.

728
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:42,567
To tell you the truth,
I'm not sure.

729
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:45,921
Well, then you have
to take a test and find out.

730
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:47,668
Doctors have always told me

731
00:36:47,669 --> 00:36:49,999
that I have a very low chance
of getting pregnant,

732
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,859
and I thought I was
a few times before,

733
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,087
and then I wasn't,

734
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:54,897
so I don't want to take
another test

735
00:36:54,898 --> 00:36:56,708
and be disappointed again.

736
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,665
Besides, I know I'm just nauseous

737
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:02,199
from all the stress
of everything going on.

738
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,955
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

739
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:05,167
We're having
a little impromptu contest.

740
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:07,982
Winner takes home
the stunning Christmas tree

741
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:09,135
on my piano.

742
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:10,750
Just step up to the mic
and tell us

743
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:12,198
why you hate Christmas.

744
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,376
Best reason wins.

745
00:37:13,377 --> 00:37:16,627
All those interested, follow me.

746
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,834
Look, all I know is that, um...

747
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:27,297
nobody's perfect,
and if you find love,

748
00:37:27,298 --> 00:37:28,194
I mean real love,

749
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:32,627
you just don't throw it away
without a hell of a fight.

750
00:37:35,134 --> 00:37:37,078
Yeah.

751
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,834
Yes.

752
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,833
My wife used to do that
with her coffee.

753
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:45,483
It was her one vice,
if you can call it that.

754
00:37:45,484 --> 00:37:48,086
It was more like
a simple pleasure, really,

755
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:51,463
just to put a little brandy
in her evening coffee,

756
00:37:51,464 --> 00:37:54,633
and B&B, just the way you do it.

757
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:57,033
Who are you?

758
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,055
Look, you've been
very, very kind to me,

759
00:38:00,056 --> 00:38:01,707
and I owe you an explanation.

760
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:04,442
It's just very hard for me
to get the words out.

761
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:05,923
What I would like...

762
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,299
Anybody home?

763
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:18,199
Oh, he's home.

764
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,673
Ho ho ho.
Merry Christmas, Mikey.

765
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,058
What are you doing here?

766
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:23,281
What am I doing here?

767
00:38:23,282 --> 00:38:24,659
I come to cheer you up, man.

768
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,008
Look, this is Holly and Mary.

769
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:27,734
Mikey, get it?

770
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,456
Holly and Mary.

771
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,928
Come on, Christmas.

772
00:38:31,014 --> 00:38:32,056
Dennis, I'm not sure

773
00:38:32,057 --> 00:38:33,494
this is such
a good time right now.

774
00:38:33,495 --> 00:38:35,658
Yeah, the girl's room
is right around the corner here.

775
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:37,427
Okay, okay, we're going.

776
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,704
Look what I brought you.

777
00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:41,845
Yeah, but, Dennis-

778
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:44,036
Mike, I get the redhead, okay?

779
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,216
What's going on here, Mikey?

780
00:38:46,217 --> 00:38:48,299
That's the guy from the diner.
What's he doing here?

781
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,802
I'm trying to get
to the bottom of this thing.

782
00:38:49,803 --> 00:38:52,549
You invited him to your apartment.
Mikey, what are you thinking?

783
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,938
He could be some sort of psycho.

784
00:38:53,939 --> 00:38:55,126
He's not a psycho.

785
00:38:55,127 --> 00:38:57,199
Little strange maybe,
but he's sweet.

786
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,567
Sweet?

787
00:38:58,651 --> 00:39:00,378
Mike, is there something
you want to tell me?

788
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,997
What are you talking about?

789
00:39:01,998 --> 00:39:04,504
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on with this guy.

790
00:39:04,505 --> 00:39:07,835
I'm your partner.
You could tell me anything.

791
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:12,252
Dennis, you got to get them
out of here.

792
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:14,165
Girls, Dennis,
I really appreciate

793
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,725
you coming by
and your concern and everything.

794
00:39:16,726 --> 00:39:18,337
Mike, I don't trust
this guy, okay?

795
00:39:18,338 --> 00:39:19,462
I'm on my cell if you need me.

796
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:21,158
Nah, I'll be all right.

797
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,812
Mike, I'm on my cell, okay?

798
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:25,130
I'll be fine.

799
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,519
What?

800
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:34,408
I find that I'm very
attracted to you.

801
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:37,119
Oh, wait a minute.

802
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,032
- I'm not gay.
- I'm not gay either.

803
00:39:39,033 --> 00:39:41,488
- I like women.
- I love women.

804
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:44,280
- No, I mean I really like women.
- I love women too.

805
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,321
And I'm getting married.

806
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:46,516
I'm getting married really soon

807
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,131
to a really great woman
that I love very much.

808
00:39:49,132 --> 00:39:51,726
I was married once
to a woman that I really loved,

809
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:54,433
and that woman was you.

810
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:57,261
Excuse me?

811
00:39:57,305 --> 00:39:59,031
Do you believe in reincarnation?

812
00:39:59,032 --> 00:40:00,260
How could you not?

813
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:01,822
When I looked at you
and you looked at me,

814
00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:03,440
I knew it was she.

815
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,741
I knew it was my Angeline,

816
00:40:04,742 --> 00:40:05,712
my wife.

817
00:40:05,747 --> 00:40:07,347
All right, that's it.
You're out of here.

818
00:40:07,348 --> 00:40:08,814
No, you're out of here!
You're my wife.

819
00:40:08,815 --> 00:40:09,999
Stay away from me!

820
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,434
Please, don't do this to me.

821
00:40:18,574 --> 00:40:19,708
Come on in, baby.

822
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:23,967
- The car's warm.
- It's freezing.

823
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,364
What's the matter, Dennis?

824
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:26,655
You're no fun tonight.

825
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:27,872
Give me one second, all right?

826
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:29,438
I don't trust this guy
with my partner.

827
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:31,047
Something's wrong.

828
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:32,665
Oh, nothing's wrong.

829
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:36,371
Give me a minute.
Give me a minute.

830
00:40:36,406 --> 00:40:37,331
Come on, Dennis.

831
00:40:37,332 --> 00:40:39,517
Son of a bitch.
I knew it.

832
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,083
No, no, Dennis.

833
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:46,178
My goodness, look at...

834
00:40:47,435 --> 00:40:49,183
All right, listen,

835
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:50,558
I got to straighten this guy out.

836
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:52,530
I got to.
I got to.

837
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,753
What I do for my friends, my God.

838
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,023
All right, just-
I got to.

839
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:01,281
All right, listen,

840
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:03,257
I got to straighten this guy out.

841
00:41:03,258 --> 00:41:05,195
Just stay here.
Stay in the car.

842
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,339
Oh, come on.

843
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:08,204
Dennis, wait in the car?

844
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,551
Nina.

845
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:17,826
What's the matter?

846
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,606
I really love you.

847
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,968
But your jealousy is killing me.

848
00:41:42,058 --> 00:41:45,814
You hold on so tight.

849
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:47,092
I can't breathe.

850
00:41:47,116 --> 00:41:50,071
That's because
I love you so much, though.

851
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,365
Too much.

852
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,151
Come on, that's crazy.

853
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:55,965
No, it's not.

854
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,105
You have to let go, Mike.

855
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:00,499
If we're gonna make it,

856
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,343
then you have to let go a little.

857
00:42:05,378 --> 00:42:06,239
I do have another life,

858
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,632
a career,

859
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:11,601
a job where I have to
talk to men.

860
00:42:11,645 --> 00:42:13,816
There's nothing
the matter with that.

861
00:42:13,817 --> 00:42:15,605
Yeah, but all these guys want

862
00:42:15,606 --> 00:42:17,146
is to take you to bed.

863
00:42:17,147 --> 00:42:19,721
So some of them try.
So what?

864
00:42:19,811 --> 00:42:22,426
You have to trust me.

865
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,955
Who?

866
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,488
Who what?

867
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:27,793
What guys try?

868
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:29,026
No.

869
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:30,464
No, are they friends of mine?

870
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,068
Do I know these guys? I didn't say that.

871
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:33,324
No, are they guys from your work?

872
00:42:33,325 --> 00:42:34,552
Did I ever meet them?

873
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:36,038
Mike, did you hear
a word that I said?

874
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:37,351
What guys?

875
00:42:37,394 --> 00:42:38,884
Who are they?

876
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,565
Why the hell did I come here?

877
00:42:41,566 --> 00:42:43,268
Come on.
Listen to me.

878
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,787
I don't want to talk to you.

879
00:42:44,788 --> 00:42:46,196
Now you're starting to scare me.

880
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,868
You're gonna have to talk to me.

881
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,467
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

882
00:42:49,468 --> 00:42:52,075
Mikey, your friend here's
waiting in the doorway hiding.

883
00:42:52,076 --> 00:42:53,041
I wasn't hiding.

884
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:53,961
I wanted to be near you.

885
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:55,219
I thought you might
come down again.

886
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,228
Not now, Artie.

887
00:42:56,229 --> 00:42:57,525
Nina, please.
Come on.

888
00:42:57,526 --> 00:42:58,306
Don't leave.

889
00:42:58,307 --> 00:42:59,457
Get in the car.

890
00:43:01,238 --> 00:43:02,637
This is all your fault.

891
00:43:02,638 --> 00:43:04,456
Why do you keep doing this to me?

892
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,431
You're my life.

893
00:43:05,432 --> 00:43:06,991
You stay away from me.

894
00:43:06,992 --> 00:43:08,168
I'm warning you.

895
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,450
Stay away from me!

896
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:10,711
You understand me?

897
00:43:10,712 --> 00:43:11,714
Shit.

898
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:14,481
Mikey, what'd you do?

899
00:43:14,482 --> 00:43:16,079
I didn't do anything.

900
00:43:16,114 --> 00:43:17,676
Get an ambulance.

901
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:21,692
And our last contestant,
Ms. Rose Harrison.

902
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,147
All right, let's see.

903
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:34,070
I hate Christmas because, uh...

904
00:43:34,105 --> 00:43:35,313
Well, you know, actually,

905
00:43:35,314 --> 00:43:37,176
I don't completely
hate Christmas.

906
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:38,965
I, um...

907
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,877
There's... quite frankly,
a lot of things

908
00:43:41,878 --> 00:43:43,063
I love about Christmas:

909
00:43:43,064 --> 00:43:46,162
those little
dome things that you shake-

910
00:43:47,994 --> 00:43:50,402
Right, okay, sorry.

911
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:51,365
Um...

912
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,028
Okay, I got pregnant
the summer that I turned 25,

913
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:56,622
and it wasn't something
that my husband and I

914
00:43:56,623 --> 00:43:58,771
really planned, but, you know,

915
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:01,399
we always wanted kids,
so we were thrilled.

916
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,727
And we found out we were
gonna have a little girl

917
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:06,820
and we painted the room pink
with little bunnies and all that.

918
00:44:06,821 --> 00:44:11,100
And we named her
after our maternal grandparents,

919
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:12,524
Olivia May.

920
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,910
And the pregnancy was great,
and the delivery was great,

921
00:44:14,911 --> 00:44:18,099
and when she came out of me,
she looked perfect.

922
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:22,546
She had just these little tiny,
tiny little fingers, all of them

923
00:44:22,547 --> 00:44:24,699
and little toes,
and she was blonde.

924
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:28,470
And you know, I don't know
what colour eyes she had

925
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:33,942
because, um, well, I never...
um, I never saw her eyes...

926
00:44:33,996 --> 00:44:38,784
because she, um... well, she...
her heart stopped.

927
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:43,199
It just stopped, and they told us
that it was defective.

928
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,204
And I tried to get pregnant
again after that,

929
00:44:45,205 --> 00:44:46,743
and it didn't happen.

930
00:44:46,744 --> 00:44:51,377
And so I guess that's why
I hate Christmas sometimes

931
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:55,181
when I think of Olivia May.

932
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:56,516
That's a sad story, lady,

933
00:44:56,517 --> 00:45:00,843
but what's that got to do
with Christmas?

934
00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:04,432
Oh, right.

935
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:06,265
She, um...

936
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:11,922
Olivia May was born...
... died on Christmas Day.

937
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,976
Don't you die
on me, Artie.

938
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,219
A woman in the Bronx

939
00:45:35,306 --> 00:45:36,392
killed her husband

940
00:45:36,393 --> 00:45:39,370
and then turned the gun
on herself.

941
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:40,764
The woman left a note
by the scene

942
00:45:40,765 --> 00:45:41,599
saying just one line:

943
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,971
"This is something
I just wanted to do for myself. "

944
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:50,704
On the house, lady.

945
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,276
We'll have details

946
00:45:52,362 --> 00:45:56,444
on this controversial new diet
coming up when we return.

947
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,268
So where the hell
does this guy live?

948
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,595
Arizona?
He lives wherever he can.

949
00:46:14,596 --> 00:46:15,864
He's a squatter.

950
00:46:15,952 --> 00:46:17,129
Moves around a lot.

951
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,543
Don't worry;
you'll see what I mean.

952
00:46:18,544 --> 00:46:19,888
I don't know
if I like this, Glen.

953
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:22,095
Just got to trust me
on this one, all right?

954
00:46:22,096 --> 00:46:24,654
This guy will take care of you.

955
00:46:24,689 --> 00:46:27,213
Well, what if I change my mind?

956
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:31,291
Well I don't give a shit what you do,
I got my money.

957
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,898
Who's that?

958
00:46:33,899 --> 00:46:35,299
It's Glen.

959
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,090
Glen, welcome.

960
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,499
- I got somebody here to see you.
- Well, come on down and bring him over.

961
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,234
- All right, you go and I'll wait here.
- You're not gonna go with me?

962
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,599
It's cool.
Don't worry about it.

963
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,680
Hi.

964
00:47:03,894 --> 00:47:06,144
So what can I do for you, son?

965
00:47:06,536 --> 00:47:08,756
Well, Glen said that, um...

966
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,999
Glen said what?

967
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,420
Glen said that you break hands.

968
00:47:14,321 --> 00:47:16,137
Yes.

969
00:47:16,229 --> 00:47:17,941
That's absolutely right.

970
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,750
And whose hands
are we talking about?

971
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,764
Mine.

972
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,451
Oh, sheez.

973
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:45,259
I'm s-oh, oh.

974
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:45,995
I'm sorry.

975
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,790
I'm so-
my fault.

976
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,430
Everything okay?

977
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:50,680
I'm fine.

978
00:47:50,715 --> 00:47:54,626
Just maybe a few too many
Christmas parties, but...

979
00:47:54,661 --> 00:47:55,800
You meant me, didn't you?

980
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:57,073
Right.

981
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:58,763
I was just checking.

982
00:47:58,805 --> 00:48:00,765
Um...

983
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,200
So how's Helen?

984
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:06,528
Well, her blood pressure's
still a little high,

985
00:48:06,576 --> 00:48:08,311
but it's much improved
since this morning.

986
00:48:08,312 --> 00:48:12,165
- Good.
- But she's still not eating.

987
00:48:12,185 --> 00:48:14,501
And I'm very concerned
about that.

988
00:48:14,502 --> 00:48:16,131
If she doesn't eat
something tonight,

989
00:48:16,132 --> 00:48:17,999
we're gonna have to
insert a feeding tube.

990
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,198
Oh, don't worry about that.

991
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,234
She's gonna eat tonight

992
00:48:20,235 --> 00:48:21,386
because mother and
I have big plans,

993
00:48:21,387 --> 00:48:22,299
don't we?

994
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,396
Mother and I, we're
going to sing some carols

995
00:48:24,397 --> 00:48:26,233
and eat some cake
and sip some nog

996
00:48:26,234 --> 00:48:27,799
and light the
Christmas tree.

997
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,865
Sounds fun.

998
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,568
It does sound like
fun, doesn't it?

999
00:48:30,569 --> 00:48:31,834
What do you
think mom?

1000
00:48:31,835 --> 00:48:33,984
Do ya think it's
going to be fun?

1001
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:34,701
I think so.

1002
00:48:34,702 --> 00:48:37,034
Aww, look at her.
How beautiful she was, hm?

1003
00:48:37,035 --> 00:48:40,399
- She still is.
- Hm.

1004
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,965
And me, I was such
a timid little kid.

1005
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,697
My first day
at kindergarten,

1006
00:48:45,698 --> 00:48:47,249
I got one look
at the Nuns

1007
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,799
and I just wouldn't
go in.

1008
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,559
And mum here

1009
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,824
she took my
hand and

1010
00:48:50,825 --> 00:48:53,399
brought me inside and
said she would stay.

1011
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,117
Sure enough when I sat
a my little desk

1012
00:48:55,118 --> 00:48:56,359
and looked out
the window

1013
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,404
I could see her

1014
00:48:57,405 --> 00:48:58,599
waiting there
for hours

1015
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,884
leaning against
her car,

1016
00:48:59,885 --> 00:49:01,051
and I was ok 'coz

1017
00:49:01,052 --> 00:49:03,552
I knew, she was
there for me.

1018
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,490
And now I'm going
to be there for her.

1019
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,340
I just don-
I-

1020
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,800
I don't know
that she knows

1021
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:15,799
that I am though,
you know.

1022
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,816
She knows you're
here though Rose.

1023
00:49:17,817 --> 00:49:19,999
I know that's hard
to see, but she knows.

1024
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,684
Your mother's lost
her memory

1025
00:49:21,685 --> 00:49:23,504
and her ability to
recognise people.

1026
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:25,049
But one thing
she'll never lose

1027
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,451
is her emotion.

1028
00:49:27,052 --> 00:49:29,695
She can sense and
she can feel.

1029
00:49:31,196 --> 00:49:32,416
I know that.

1030
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,591
That's why we
tell the families

1031
00:49:34,592 --> 00:49:35,864
to touch them,

1032
00:49:35,865 --> 00:49:37,160
talk to them.

1033
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,621
I know I'm telling you
things you already know

1034
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:41,050
but, you know,

1035
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:42,892
sometimes you forget.

1036
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:46,199
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1037
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,447
I'm gonna come back
a little later and...

1038
00:49:49,448 --> 00:49:50,573
check on her.

1039
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,282
All right.

1040
00:49:57,363 --> 00:49:59,513
Let's start the celebration

1041
00:49:59,547 --> 00:50:01,684
with some carrot cake, huh?

1042
00:50:01,768 --> 00:50:03,696
Let's see.

1043
00:50:03,736 --> 00:50:05,376
Here we go.

1044
00:50:08,647 --> 00:50:10,454
Just a little nibble.

1045
00:50:10,498 --> 00:50:11,768
Here you go, Mom.

1046
00:50:11,796 --> 00:50:13,810
Come on.

1047
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:15,440
Please.

1048
00:50:15,485 --> 00:50:16,418
Come on.

1049
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:17,542
Did you hear the doctor?

1050
00:50:17,543 --> 00:50:19,426
It's really important
that you eat, okay?

1051
00:50:19,427 --> 00:50:21,272
Let's just try,
just a little nibble.

1052
00:50:21,273 --> 00:50:22,624
Please.

1053
00:50:22,669 --> 00:50:24,806
Come on.

1054
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,852
Why won't you eat anything?

1055
00:50:26,853 --> 00:50:29,090
Oh, God.

1056
00:50:32,023 --> 00:50:34,655
Okay, let's do the tree.

1057
00:50:34,692 --> 00:50:37,306
Look what I won, Mom.

1058
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:38,861
Huh, nice tree?

1059
00:50:38,904 --> 00:50:41,595
It'll cheer up the room.

1060
00:50:41,681 --> 00:50:42,593
Okay.

1061
00:50:42,633 --> 00:50:44,104
Let's see.

1062
00:50:49,689 --> 00:50:51,486
You like that, Mom, hm?

1063
00:50:51,573 --> 00:50:52,794
Merry Christmas.

1064
00:50:54,169 --> 00:50:55,353
Oh.

1065
00:50:55,438 --> 00:50:56,556
Hold on.
I'll get it.

1066
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:57,924
I can fix it.

1067
00:50:57,958 --> 00:50:59,292
Let's see.

1068
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:01,602
Just a little bit of...

1069
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,480
What the hell's
wrong with this thing?

1070
00:51:04,497 --> 00:51:05,965
Ah, just get this.

1071
00:51:06,048 --> 00:51:07,006
I'm gonna fix it.

1072
00:51:07,007 --> 00:51:09,447
Don't worry.

1073
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:11,202
Damn it!

1074
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,744
I love you.

1075
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,500
Get him in room two.

1076
00:52:21,145 --> 00:52:22,453
What's going on here?

1077
00:52:22,454 --> 00:52:24,148
It's a pileup
on the West Side Highway.

1078
00:52:24,149 --> 00:52:25,487
You save him!

1079
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:26,852
He needs help!

1080
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:28,695
Sir, I'll be
right with you.

1081
00:52:28,696 --> 00:52:29,882
Looking for my mother.

1082
00:52:29,883 --> 00:52:31,581
She was involved
in an accident on the highway.

1083
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,382
Her name is Evelyn Jents.

1084
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,288
I guess there isn't
gonna be a party now.

1085
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:36,756
Not tonight, sweetie.
Sorry.

1086
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:38,845
I'll try to scrounge up
some leftover eggnog for you.

1087
00:52:38,846 --> 00:52:39,718
All right.

1088
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,675
Sure wasn't like this
when I was 14.

1089
00:52:43,676 --> 00:52:45,919
That was the best Christmas
I ever had.

1090
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,907
That's great.

1091
00:52:46,941 --> 00:52:47,898
Excuse me.

1092
00:52:47,981 --> 00:52:49,616
Excuse me,
but I've been waiting for hours.

1093
00:52:49,617 --> 00:52:51,184
Is there any news
on Artie Venezelos yet?

1094
00:52:51,185 --> 00:52:54,205
You're gonna have
to talk to Nurse Stein.

1095
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,878
Excuse me.

1096
00:52:55,967 --> 00:52:57,770
I was hoping
you could give me some news

1097
00:52:57,771 --> 00:52:58,832
on Artie Venezelos.

1098
00:52:58,833 --> 00:52:59,901
Are you family?

1099
00:52:59,902 --> 00:53:01,547
No, not really.
I just-

1100
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:03,748
Either you are, or you're not.

1101
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,326
I'm a friend.

1102
00:53:05,414 --> 00:53:06,713
I'm sorry;
I can't give out

1103
00:53:06,714 --> 00:53:07,973
any medical information.

1104
00:53:07,974 --> 00:53:09,028
He's his friend.

1105
00:53:09,029 --> 00:53:10,701
You know,
like his friend-friend.

1106
00:53:10,702 --> 00:53:12,354
I don't care if he's his priest.

1107
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,008
Okay, thank you, Nurse Ratched.

1108
00:53:14,009 --> 00:53:15,665
Listen.

1109
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,185
I will find out what I can, okay?

1110
00:53:17,186 --> 00:53:19,399
Oh, man,
I really appreciate that.

1111
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,672
You know, but the truth of it is,

1112
00:53:20,673 --> 00:53:21,905
we're not even really friends.

1113
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:23,099
Really?

1114
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,498
It's okay.

1115
00:53:24,533 --> 00:53:26,593
I figured that.

1116
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,317
Can't swim.

1117
00:54:04,872 --> 00:54:07,365
Love to learn.

1118
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,737
You're the guy from the hospital.

1119
00:54:08,738 --> 00:54:10,061
Yeah, Charlie Boyd.

1120
00:54:10,062 --> 00:54:11,684
You're the angel lady.

1121
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,865
What are you doing here?

1122
00:54:13,866 --> 00:54:15,545
Did you follow me?

1123
00:54:15,581 --> 00:54:17,235
No, not at all.

1124
00:54:17,276 --> 00:54:19,136
Well, then,
well, why are you here?

1125
00:54:19,137 --> 00:54:21,118
I could ask you
the same question.

1126
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,028
I just want you
to leave me alone.

1127
00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:23,962
Can't do that.

1128
00:54:23,963 --> 00:54:25,090
I see a woman standing alone

1129
00:54:25,091 --> 00:54:26,892
on a pier looking over a ledge,
I gotta help.

1130
00:54:26,893 --> 00:54:29,041
I don't want any help.

1131
00:54:29,085 --> 00:54:30,589
If you jump in, I'm gonna have to

1132
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:31,892
jump in right after you.

1133
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,297
Who said anything
about jumping in?

1134
00:54:34,298 --> 00:54:36,645
But if I did jump,
you'd jump in after me

1135
00:54:36,646 --> 00:54:39,175
after you told me
that you can't swim?

1136
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:41,688
Yeah, because it's
the right thing to do.

1137
00:54:41,689 --> 00:54:42,903
And you always do
the right thing?

1138
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,090
Yeah, I do.

1139
00:54:44,174 --> 00:54:45,593
It's a bad habit.

1140
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,170
You want to tell me
your sad story?

1141
00:54:50,171 --> 00:54:53,831
I'm a really good listener.

1142
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:56,827
I'm all ears.

1143
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:59,001
Good, I'll tell you mine.

1144
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:03,247
It's Christmas Eve,
and I'm all alone.

1145
00:55:05,893 --> 00:55:06,949
That's it?

1146
00:55:07,031 --> 00:55:08,621
You're all alone?

1147
00:55:08,707 --> 00:55:10,374
That's the best you can do?

1148
00:55:10,375 --> 00:55:12,150
There's more.

1149
00:55:12,234 --> 00:55:13,371
I'm a priest.

1150
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:14,677
Really?

1151
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:16,012
Yeah, for 20 years.

1152
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:18,273
Then last year,
I left the priesthood.

1153
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:20,521
Kicked the habit.

1154
00:55:20,563 --> 00:55:22,277
Started my life over.

1155
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:24,121
Now here I am.

1156
00:55:24,206 --> 00:55:25,685
No more Catholic family,

1157
00:55:25,686 --> 00:55:27,219
no personal family here,

1158
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,504
no one.

1159
00:55:29,585 --> 00:55:31,359
Wow.

1160
00:55:31,443 --> 00:55:33,031
Now you want me to guess yours?

1161
00:55:33,032 --> 00:55:35,768
Take your best shot.

1162
00:55:35,807 --> 00:55:37,827
You're an attractive lady
who forgot her hat,

1163
00:55:37,828 --> 00:55:39,412
and your ears are very cold.

1164
00:55:39,413 --> 00:55:40,510
Bingo.

1165
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:41,736
Hah.

1166
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:44,091
Take anything off the top shelf.

1167
00:55:46,316 --> 00:55:48,658
Want to get a cab
and get a cup of coffee,

1168
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:51,212
and I'll guess more
of your story?

1169
00:55:58,298 --> 00:56:00,308
After you.

1170
00:56:09,384 --> 00:56:11,612
Still my turn to guess, Rose?

1171
00:56:11,696 --> 00:56:13,582
You're this amazing person,

1172
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:15,554
but you're too busy
helping others

1173
00:56:15,555 --> 00:56:19,000
to see it.

1174
00:56:19,088 --> 00:56:21,808
You take good care
of your friend, right?

1175
00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:23,247
Thanks.

1176
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:25,225
Is he a close friend?

1177
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,891
What's the matter?

1178
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:32,541
Kind of a bad stomach.

1179
00:56:32,586 --> 00:56:35,225
Hurts.

1180
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,371
Hope we get someplace soon.

1181
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:44,571
I don't feel so good.

1182
00:56:44,637 --> 00:56:46,612
All right, well...

1183
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:49,446
My place is actually
not far from here.

1184
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,152
Do you want to go there?

1185
00:56:51,153 --> 00:56:52,533
You sure?
Yeah.

1186
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:55,225
Driver, three lights,

1187
00:56:55,266 --> 00:56:57,128
take a left.

1188
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,570
Hey, you know, I really
appreciate you doing this.

1189
00:56:59,571 --> 00:57:00,843
Aw, man, I'm glad I could help.

1190
00:57:00,844 --> 00:57:02,722
I know hospital policy
isn't always on our side.

1191
00:57:02,723 --> 00:57:03,827
They can be a little stuffy.

1192
00:57:03,828 --> 00:57:05,146
I remember when
my lover got sick-

1193
00:57:05,147 --> 00:57:06,557
Hey, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

1194
00:57:06,558 --> 00:57:07,906
You made a mistake, uh, Randy.

1195
00:57:07,907 --> 00:57:09,654
Yeah, you're making
the wrong assumption

1196
00:57:09,655 --> 00:57:10,681
about Artie and I.

1197
00:57:10,682 --> 00:57:12,580
I appreciate you
bringing me up here and all,

1198
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:14,215
but the truth of it is,
we ain't a couple.

1199
00:57:14,216 --> 00:57:15,857
As a matter of fact,
I just met the guy.

1200
00:57:15,858 --> 00:57:17,546
He's a waiter,
and I ordered some coffee-

1201
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:19,200
Oh, my God,
that's how my parents met.

1202
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:20,554
My mother waited on my father,

1203
00:57:20,555 --> 00:57:21,973
only he ordered
a tuna fish sandwich

1204
00:57:21,974 --> 00:57:23,171
and a ginger ale.

1205
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:24,338
No, now, now look.

1206
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:26,518
I just, I want
to make it clear that-

1207
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:27,870
Don't worry.

1208
00:57:27,955 --> 00:57:29,929
Your secret's safe with me.

1209
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,910
He's stable now.

1210
00:57:35,991 --> 00:57:38,878
Just thank God
for small blessings, right?

1211
00:57:38,879 --> 00:57:39,894
Let him know you're here.

1212
00:57:39,895 --> 00:57:41,681
I don't care
what the doctors say.

1213
00:57:41,682 --> 00:57:43,422
Talk to him.
Tell him how you feel.

1214
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,705
He'll hear you.

1215
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,712
Mike, we got to talk.

1216
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:47,766
Oh, hi.

1217
00:57:47,808 --> 00:57:48,726
Oh, my.

1218
00:57:48,772 --> 00:57:49,655
Who's that?

1219
00:57:49,743 --> 00:57:51,003
Nah, forget about it.

1220
00:57:51,004 --> 00:57:52,675
What do you got? I went to the station.

1221
00:57:52,676 --> 00:57:54,028
I got some info on this guy.

1222
00:57:54,029 --> 00:57:56,131
Did you know your friend here
served four years

1223
00:57:56,132 --> 00:57:59,436
on a ten-year sentence
for manslaughter back in '79?

1224
00:57:59,437 --> 00:58:01,471
This guy?
Yeah, that's him.

1225
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:03,484
It was a domestic dispute.

1226
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:05,463
This Venezelos comes home,

1227
00:58:05,503 --> 00:58:07,266
finds his wife
with another guy, right,

1228
00:58:07,267 --> 00:58:09,109
but it's no boyfriend or nothing,

1229
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,536
just an old friend.

1230
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,986
He goes into a rage,

1231
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:13,736
accuses her
of being unfaithful, right?

1232
00:58:13,737 --> 00:58:15,460
Him and this guy
get into some words.

1233
00:58:15,461 --> 00:58:17,156
They start going at each other.

1234
00:58:17,157 --> 00:58:19,713
He throws the guy
down a flight of stairs.

1235
00:58:19,714 --> 00:58:21,105
The guy's neck breaks.

1236
00:58:21,106 --> 00:58:22,492
He died in the hospital

1237
00:58:22,493 --> 00:58:23,633
a few hours later.

1238
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:24,721
Wait, it gets worse.

1239
00:58:24,722 --> 00:58:27,236
The wife takes off
before the cops show up, right?

1240
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,046
She jumps in her car
and speeds away.

1241
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,354
She's doing, like, about 80

1242
00:58:30,355 --> 00:58:32,574
when she skids out
on this icy curve

1243
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,817
and hits an oncoming car head on.

1244
00:58:34,818 --> 00:58:36,913
She was killed instantly.

1245
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:40,734
Mike.

1246
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,653
Whoa, Mikey, you all right?

1247
00:58:44,735 --> 00:58:45,819
Yeah.

1248
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:47,165
Yeah, I'm okay.

1249
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,040
Well, at least we know
who the nut is now, right?

1250
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:50,642
Naw, he's not nuts.

1251
00:58:50,724 --> 00:58:51,948
Yeah, all right.
Whatever.

1252
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:53,476
Let's get out of here.
I'll take you home.

1253
00:58:53,477 --> 00:58:54,964
Nah, I'm gonna stay
around here for a while.

1254
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,489
For what?
They can take care of him.

1255
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:57,704
Come on, let's get out of here.

1256
00:58:57,705 --> 00:59:00,190
Dennis, listen to me.

1257
00:59:00,273 --> 00:59:01,581
Something's going on here.

1258
00:59:01,582 --> 00:59:03,921
I don't know what it is,
but I'm gonna find out.

1259
00:59:03,922 --> 00:59:05,702
I appreciate you coming by
and everything,

1260
00:59:05,703 --> 00:59:08,138
but I got to figure this one out.

1261
00:59:08,985 --> 00:59:10,418
You gonna be all right?

1262
00:59:10,419 --> 00:59:12,650
Yeah, I'm gonna be all right.

1263
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:13,986
All right.

1264
00:59:15,542 --> 00:59:17,221
All right,
merry Christmas, partner, huh?

1265
00:59:17,222 --> 00:59:18,337
Merry Christmas.

1266
00:59:18,364 --> 00:59:19,289
Whoa.

1267
00:59:19,328 --> 00:59:20,328
I didn't see nothing.

1268
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:21,377
What is it with this guy?

1269
00:59:21,378 --> 00:59:22,398
You don't even want to know.

1270
00:59:22,399 --> 00:59:23,703
All right, later.

1271
00:59:23,785 --> 00:59:26,019
Take care.

1272
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,542
This is really hot.

1273
00:59:33,543 --> 00:59:34,733
Be careful.

1274
00:59:34,817 --> 00:59:36,034
It's tea with bitters.

1275
00:59:36,035 --> 00:59:37,708
It's good for your stomach.

1276
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:38,970
Thanks for letting me come here.

1277
00:59:38,971 --> 00:59:39,856
Oh, sure.

1278
00:59:39,938 --> 00:59:40,869
It's not right, you know.

1279
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,434
I should be the one helping you.

1280
00:59:42,435 --> 00:59:44,228
Oh, no, I'm the one that always

1281
00:59:44,229 --> 00:59:45,982
takes care of everybody,
remember?

1282
00:59:45,983 --> 00:59:47,174
My thing.

1283
00:59:47,258 --> 00:59:49,012
Must be something
you need, though.

1284
00:59:49,013 --> 00:59:50,019
What do you mean?

1285
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,259
Well,

1286
00:59:51,342 --> 00:59:54,779
what do you want most
in the whole world, Rose?

1287
00:59:57,518 --> 01:00:01,339
I guess just to make it
through the night would be nice.

1288
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,496
Now we're talking.

1289
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:05,812
I can definitely help with that.

1290
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:10,853
Did I just invite myself
to spend the night?

1291
01:00:10,854 --> 01:00:12,710
Sort of.

1292
01:00:14,263 --> 01:00:15,594
Maybe I should go.

1293
01:00:15,629 --> 01:00:16,560
No.

1294
01:00:17,653 --> 01:00:19,044
Stay.

1295
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:20,888
You sure?

1296
01:00:22,429 --> 01:00:23,860
Yeah.

1297
01:00:23,901 --> 01:00:26,325
On condition that you tell me
what it is that you want.

1298
01:00:26,326 --> 01:00:28,775
That's fair.

1299
01:00:28,816 --> 01:00:31,250
I don't want to be alone
when I die.

1300
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:33,194
Is that too much?

1301
01:00:36,101 --> 01:00:37,979
No. No.

1302
01:00:38,024 --> 01:00:39,591
No.

1303
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,691
You sure that's him?

1304
01:00:43,692 --> 01:00:44,703
Doctor, believe me.

1305
01:00:44,704 --> 01:00:45,843
He was just here this morning.

1306
01:00:45,844 --> 01:00:47,474
So you think
that it was self-inflicted.

1307
01:00:47,475 --> 01:00:48,631
Absolutely.

1308
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:50,559
Well, if that's the case,

1309
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,924
we can hold him
for up to 24 hours

1310
01:00:52,925 --> 01:00:55,075
for observation if we think
he's a danger to himself.

1311
01:00:55,076 --> 01:00:57,201
Have the resident psychiatrist
have a talk to him

1312
01:00:57,202 --> 01:00:58,463
before we decide to let him go.

1313
01:00:58,464 --> 01:01:00,189
Okay.

1314
01:01:02,502 --> 01:01:04,012
Look, if there's not
gonna be a party,

1315
01:01:04,013 --> 01:01:05,063
I want to go now.

1316
01:01:05,064 --> 01:01:06,793
Can't leave right now.
Why?

1317
01:01:06,794 --> 01:01:08,499
You have to speak
to another doctor.

1318
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,567
For what?

1319
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:10,947
Those are the rules.

1320
01:01:10,948 --> 01:01:13,346
Look, you can't
just keep me here.

1321
01:01:13,347 --> 01:01:14,958
I can't, but he can.

1322
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:18,940
Now sit down.

1323
01:01:25,961 --> 01:01:29,658
Charlie, I hope
you don't mind my asking, but...

1324
01:01:29,742 --> 01:01:33,314
Why did you leave the priesthood
after 20 years?

1325
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:37,390
I lost my faith.

1326
01:01:39,795 --> 01:01:43,065
And I began to question
the existence of God.

1327
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:46,258
If you're a priest,
that's not good.

1328
01:01:46,305 --> 01:01:49,120
So here I am.

1329
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:50,048
I'm sorry.

1330
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,323
It's all right.

1331
01:01:52,819 --> 01:01:54,493
What about you?
What about me?

1332
01:01:54,494 --> 01:01:55,592
How's your faith?

1333
01:01:55,593 --> 01:01:56,679
Oh, it's pretty shaky.

1334
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:57,782
Really?
Why?

1335
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:00,681
Well, my mom's been sick

1336
01:02:00,682 --> 01:02:02,271
for a long time with Alzheimer's,

1337
01:02:02,272 --> 01:02:03,619
and she was always the glue

1338
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,131
that kind of
kept the family together.

1339
01:02:05,132 --> 01:02:06,910
Now she can't even bathe herself.

1340
01:02:06,911 --> 01:02:09,588
And I keep trying
to reconnect with her.

1341
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:11,433
How do you do that
with someone who's not there?

1342
01:02:11,434 --> 01:02:14,130
Well, I put...

1343
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,096
I put pictures of the family
all around the room,

1344
01:02:16,097 --> 01:02:17,446
and I bring her
her favourite foods.

1345
01:02:17,447 --> 01:02:18,674
I play her favourite music.

1346
01:02:18,675 --> 01:02:20,005
You know,
I'm just trying to find her

1347
01:02:20,006 --> 01:02:22,241
just even for, like, a second,

1348
01:02:22,248 --> 01:02:24,803
just to have some kind
of moment of clarity, you know,

1349
01:02:24,804 --> 01:02:27,582
so that I know she's still there.

1350
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:30,569
Does it work?

1351
01:02:30,609 --> 01:02:34,178
No.

1352
01:02:34,222 --> 01:02:36,071
Do you pray?

1353
01:02:36,155 --> 01:02:38,724
No, not anymore.

1354
01:02:38,765 --> 01:02:40,831
Yeah, I know how that is.

1355
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,809
Only five more hours to go.

1356
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:49,878
Till what?

1357
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:52,622
Till you make it
through the night.

1358
01:02:56,949 --> 01:02:59,089
This is mesmerizing.

1359
01:02:59,133 --> 01:03:00,218
Not for five hours.

1360
01:03:00,219 --> 01:03:01,198
No.

1361
01:03:01,284 --> 01:03:03,519
We should put another tape on.

1362
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:08,346
How you doing?

1363
01:03:11,243 --> 01:03:12,601
Look, I want to go home now!

1364
01:03:12,602 --> 01:03:13,891
All right?
This is all wrong.

1365
01:03:13,892 --> 01:03:16,161
This is not the way
it's supposed to be!

1366
01:03:16,162 --> 01:03:17,261
Calm down, Mr. Calvert.

1367
01:03:17,262 --> 01:03:18,519
Oh, you want me to calm down.

1368
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,043
Calm down, Mr. Calvert.

1369
01:03:20,044 --> 01:03:21,374
Calm down.
I can calm down.

1370
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:22,682
That calm enough for you?

1371
01:03:22,683 --> 01:03:24,921
What about that?

1372
01:03:27,276 --> 01:03:28,571
Get him on the other side.

1373
01:03:28,572 --> 01:03:29,917
What are you doing?

1374
01:03:29,918 --> 01:03:31,226
I got a broken hand.

1375
01:03:31,227 --> 01:03:32,281
Put me-

1376
01:03:32,368 --> 01:03:33,976
I didn't do anything wrong.

1377
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:35,559
Orderly!
Let me go.

1378
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,945
Come on.
Come on.

1379
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:40,616
You know, Artie,
I got to tell you,

1380
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:42,720
I feel really bad
about what happened

1381
01:03:42,721 --> 01:03:45,026
at the apartment today,
and I want you to know that,

1382
01:03:45,027 --> 01:03:47,342
you know, I wasn't mad at you.

1383
01:03:47,343 --> 01:03:49,609
See, I was...
I was mad...

1384
01:03:52,093 --> 01:03:53,182
Man, Artie,

1385
01:03:53,266 --> 01:03:56,041
I really screwed things up
between Nina and me.

1386
01:03:56,042 --> 01:03:57,609
You have no idea.

1387
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,528
Actually, you probably do,
don't you?

1388
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,575
Hey, Artie.

1389
01:04:15,654 --> 01:04:18,387
I got to know.

1390
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:20,698
That stuff you were saying today,

1391
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:25,754
about you and me, you know,

1392
01:04:25,797 --> 01:04:28,519
about your wife,
that was just crazy, right?

1393
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,437
Just some
big misunderstanding, right?

1394
01:04:35,521 --> 01:04:36,478
Who are you?

1395
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,085
I'm a friend.

1396
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:42,137
I've never met you before.

1397
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:43,684
Paul Venezelos.

1398
01:04:43,726 --> 01:04:44,765
Hi.

1399
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,568
Michael Reilly.

1400
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,457
I'm the guy that took him here.

1401
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,643
I'm a cop.

1402
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:50,731
Oh, thank you.

1403
01:04:50,732 --> 01:04:51,748
Yeah.

1404
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:53,683
So how's he doing?

1405
01:04:53,768 --> 01:04:55,328
He's stable.

1406
01:04:58,863 --> 01:05:00,166
All right.

1407
01:05:00,252 --> 01:05:02,134
Well, thanks for sitting
with him.

1408
01:05:02,135 --> 01:05:03,441
It was good to meet you.

1409
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,513
Yeah, of course.

1410
01:05:11,872 --> 01:05:12,840
Mike.

1411
01:05:13,853 --> 01:05:14,765
Yeah?

1412
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,360
He didn't give you
some cockamamy story

1413
01:05:16,361 --> 01:05:19,831
about you being
my reincarnated mother, did he?

1414
01:05:21,664 --> 01:05:23,811
He did, didn't he?

1415
01:05:25,378 --> 01:05:27,809
He's been doing that
to some poor unsuspecting chump

1416
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:30,059
every Christmas since she died.

1417
01:05:31,104 --> 01:05:32,160
Well, look,

1418
01:05:32,243 --> 01:05:33,544
I promise I'll let him know

1419
01:05:33,545 --> 01:05:35,305
that you were here
when he wakes up, all right?

1420
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,382
Yeah.

1421
01:05:37,463 --> 01:05:39,231
I appreciate it.

1422
01:06:44,274 --> 01:06:46,693
Can't believe you're still here.

1423
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,975
So he likes to tell people

1424
01:06:50,976 --> 01:06:52,653
they're your
reincarnated mother, huh?

1425
01:06:52,654 --> 01:06:53,804
Yeah.

1426
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,786
Always around Christmas.

1427
01:07:00,293 --> 01:07:01,634
Look, I'm sorry about your mother

1428
01:07:01,635 --> 01:07:03,271
and all that happened.

1429
01:07:04,763 --> 01:07:06,568
He told you what happened?

1430
01:07:06,569 --> 01:07:08,308
Yeah, a little.

1431
01:07:08,349 --> 01:07:10,017
You know, he mentioned it once.

1432
01:07:10,018 --> 01:07:11,003
Wow.

1433
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:13,595
My father
never talked about that.

1434
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:18,126
Anyhow, I'm sorry.

1435
01:07:18,213 --> 01:07:20,986
Pop, you know,
he just can't seem to forget it.

1436
01:07:20,987 --> 01:07:23,471
It's the past
that holds onto him.

1437
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,552
We don't count.

1438
01:07:25,633 --> 01:07:26,935
No matter what we do,

1439
01:07:26,936 --> 01:07:28,485
no matter how much
we try to be there for him,

1440
01:07:28,486 --> 01:07:31,449
we just can't reach him.

1441
01:07:31,531 --> 01:07:34,013
I can't reach him.

1442
01:07:35,242 --> 01:07:36,815
Do you know he still keeps

1443
01:07:36,816 --> 01:07:38,931
that glass angel by his bed?

1444
01:07:39,331 --> 01:07:41,177
I swear he sees her face in it.

1445
01:07:41,178 --> 01:07:44,138
Glass angel?

1446
01:07:44,181 --> 01:07:45,733
Yeah, my mother
had it blown out of glass

1447
01:07:45,734 --> 01:07:47,803
to put on top of the tree.

1448
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:49,867
It was a surprise for Pop.

1449
01:07:51,428 --> 01:07:53,903
Sounds like
they loved each other very much.

1450
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:55,179
They did.

1451
01:07:56,706 --> 01:07:59,220
All my father's looking for
is a little forgiveness.

1452
01:07:59,221 --> 01:08:01,149
Where's the harm in that?

1453
01:08:02,395 --> 01:08:04,668
Forgiveness from who?

1454
01:08:04,757 --> 01:08:06,567
From her.

1455
01:08:06,656 --> 01:08:09,443
He screwed up, and he's sorry.

1456
01:08:09,526 --> 01:08:12,547
He just never got a chance
to tell her.

1457
01:08:18,372 --> 01:08:20,066
I got to take a walk.

1458
01:08:20,146 --> 01:08:23,936
I'll be right back.

1459
01:08:24,019 --> 01:08:26,088
Keep an eye on him.

1460
01:08:26,122 --> 01:08:28,156
Yeah, you got it.

1461
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,102
Morning.

1462
01:10:08,585 --> 01:10:09,881
Morning.

1463
01:10:09,924 --> 01:10:12,003
How you feeling?

1464
01:10:12,088 --> 01:10:13,603
Rose.

1465
01:10:13,647 --> 01:10:15,327
Charlie, if you have to leave,

1466
01:10:15,328 --> 01:10:16,545
I understand, really.

1467
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:17,739
It's fine.

1468
01:10:17,825 --> 01:10:19,716
Look, I made it
through the night, didn't I?

1469
01:10:19,717 --> 01:10:21,461
Yes, you have.

1470
01:10:21,545 --> 01:10:23,326
But is that
what you really wanted?

1471
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:25,087
Just to make it through the night

1472
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:26,983
and that's all?

1473
01:10:27,070 --> 01:10:30,700
Well, I suppose I'd like to think

1474
01:10:30,743 --> 01:10:32,648
that my life matters.

1475
01:10:32,736 --> 01:10:34,800
Oh, your life matters.

1476
01:10:34,885 --> 01:10:36,433
You've touched
other people's lives

1477
01:10:36,434 --> 01:10:37,927
in ways you don't even realize.

1478
01:10:37,928 --> 01:10:39,359
How do you know that?

1479
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,037
Because you touched my life.

1480
01:10:41,038 --> 01:10:42,691
You're just being nice, Charlie.

1481
01:10:42,692 --> 01:10:43,762
No, Rose, I'm not.

1482
01:10:43,763 --> 01:10:45,345
It's more than that.

1483
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,915
You saved me, Rose.

1484
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,542
I was wondering where God was,

1485
01:10:48,543 --> 01:10:50,812
and the next thing you know,
there you are

1486
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,935
at the bedside
of a complete stranger

1487
01:10:52,936 --> 01:10:56,165
telling him you love him
with such meaning.

1488
01:10:56,187 --> 01:10:58,011
And then I knew God was there

1489
01:10:58,012 --> 01:11:00,378
in that room with you.

1490
01:11:00,461 --> 01:11:01,772
You were there?

1491
01:11:01,815 --> 01:11:02,874
Yeah.

1492
01:11:02,914 --> 01:11:04,910
Why did you do that, Rose?

1493
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:08,377
I...

1494
01:11:11,453 --> 01:11:13,194
Because he was just so alone,

1495
01:11:13,195 --> 01:11:15,516
and...

1496
01:11:17,471 --> 01:11:20,295
I guess I know
what it feels like.

1497
01:11:20,378 --> 01:11:21,690
I know.

1498
01:11:21,733 --> 01:11:23,751
That's why your mother
wants you to let go

1499
01:11:23,752 --> 01:11:26,212
and live a life.

1500
01:11:26,297 --> 01:11:27,740
What?

1501
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:30,144
Your mother wants you
to live your life, Rose.

1502
01:11:30,145 --> 01:11:31,172
You don't know my mother.

1503
01:11:31,173 --> 01:11:32,345
She knows you love her

1504
01:11:32,346 --> 01:11:33,540
and you're there for her.

1505
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:34,677
Why are you doing this?

1506
01:11:34,678 --> 01:11:36,053
Because she told me to tell you.

1507
01:11:36,054 --> 01:11:37,844
That's not funny.

1508
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:39,480
And you're scaring me.

1509
01:11:39,481 --> 01:11:40,636
No, Rose, listen.

1510
01:11:40,637 --> 01:11:41,812
I don't have much time.

1511
01:11:41,813 --> 01:11:42,747
Charlie, please.

1512
01:11:42,748 --> 01:11:44,023
I don't want to listen.

1513
01:11:44,024 --> 01:11:45,531
Please listen
to what I have to say.

1514
01:11:45,532 --> 01:11:46,465
Get out of the house.

1515
01:11:46,466 --> 01:11:47,690
I don't want you here anymore.

1516
01:11:47,691 --> 01:11:48,792
I'm not gonna leave

1517
01:11:48,793 --> 01:11:50,146
till you hear what I have to say.

1518
01:11:50,147 --> 01:11:52,472
She spoke to me last night.

1519
01:11:52,554 --> 01:11:54,069
All right,
I'm calling the police.

1520
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:55,216
I know it's hard to believe.

1521
01:11:55,217 --> 01:11:56,309
I mean it, Charlie.
Get out!

1522
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:57,379
That's what she wants.

1523
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,182
I know that would make her happy.

1524
01:11:59,183 --> 01:12:00,382
Happy?

1525
01:12:00,425 --> 01:12:01,937
Happy.

1526
01:12:02,023 --> 01:12:04,429
My mother doesn't even know
she's my mother.

1527
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:05,503
She doesn't hear me.

1528
01:12:05,504 --> 01:12:06,509
She doesn't see me.

1529
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:07,909
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1530
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:10,017
When you look in her eyes,
you see absolutely nothing.

1531
01:12:10,018 --> 01:12:11,373
She's not there,
do you understand?

1532
01:12:11,374 --> 01:12:13,731
I'm watching
my mother die bit by bit.

1533
01:12:13,732 --> 01:12:16,061
So don't you tell me
about my mother.

1534
01:12:16,062 --> 01:12:17,162
Get out of here!

1535
01:12:17,163 --> 01:12:18,856
Just go!

1536
01:12:20,894 --> 01:12:23,220
I love you, Rose.

1537
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,648
Did you do that
to yourself, Jules?

1538
01:12:34,649 --> 01:12:36,474
No.

1539
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:38,724
Well, there are some people
here at the hospital

1540
01:12:38,725 --> 01:12:41,180
that think you might have.

1541
01:12:41,264 --> 01:12:43,365
Hey, look, this is bull
have to go through with this?

1542
01:12:43,366 --> 01:12:46,603
If you want to leave, yes.

1543
01:12:46,647 --> 01:12:47,785
All right.

1544
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:49,824
Fine.

1545
01:12:49,864 --> 01:12:51,182
I'll play this game.

1546
01:12:51,183 --> 01:12:54,021
My dad died
when I was real young.

1547
01:12:54,063 --> 01:12:55,371
My mother married some guy

1548
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:57,612
with quick hands
who didn't have time for me.

1549
01:12:57,613 --> 01:12:58,845
So he hit you?

1550
01:12:58,887 --> 01:12:59,864
Yes.

1551
01:12:59,902 --> 01:13:00,832
A lot?

1552
01:13:00,916 --> 01:13:02,437
When he felt like it.

1553
01:13:02,438 --> 01:13:03,892
They still married?

1554
01:13:03,977 --> 01:13:05,768
I heard he died years ago,

1555
01:13:05,769 --> 01:13:07,575
which made me very happy.

1556
01:13:07,578 --> 01:13:09,513
When was the last time
you spoke to your mother?

1557
01:13:09,514 --> 01:13:11,889
I told you,
I don't have a mother.

1558
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,411
I want to help you, Jules,

1559
01:13:13,412 --> 01:13:14,939
but unless you tell me the truth,

1560
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:15,800
I can't.

1561
01:13:15,885 --> 01:13:17,573
So tell me,

1562
01:13:17,613 --> 01:13:19,859
did you do that to your hand?

1563
01:13:21,632 --> 01:13:24,017
Yes.

1564
01:13:24,096 --> 01:13:26,125
Why?

1565
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,550
By the time I was 14,

1566
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:31,793
I was taking a beating every day.

1567
01:13:31,794 --> 01:13:33,319
And once, it got so bad,

1568
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,772
he even threw my mother

1569
01:13:34,773 --> 01:13:36,252
halfway across the room.

1570
01:13:36,253 --> 01:13:38,787
And that's when
I told him to stop.

1571
01:13:38,788 --> 01:13:40,282
That's all I said.

1572
01:13:40,367 --> 01:13:41,592
"Stop it. "

1573
01:13:41,637 --> 01:13:43,458
And you know what he did?

1574
01:13:43,459 --> 01:13:46,122
He broke my nose in three places

1575
01:13:46,167 --> 01:13:48,904
and then threw me
out of the house.

1576
01:13:49,861 --> 01:13:51,256
And after they fixed me up,

1577
01:13:51,257 --> 01:13:52,617
the hospital called my mother,

1578
01:13:52,618 --> 01:13:54,200
and she never showed.

1579
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:55,969
Never even picked me up.

1580
01:13:56,595 --> 01:13:58,772
If she'd just given me a little hint.

1581
01:13:58,773 --> 01:13:59,903
That she wanted me to stay.

1582
01:13:59,904 --> 01:14:01,705
That she cared... something.

1583
01:14:01,706 --> 01:14:03,044
Then I would've stayed.

1584
01:14:03,045 --> 01:14:05,654
But you know what,
I felt she choose him over me.

1585
01:14:05,655 --> 01:14:08,615
I wasn't going to
stick around for that.

1586
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,179
Maybe she was scared, Jules.

1587
01:14:12,263 --> 01:14:14,020
Maybe she was just as scared
as you

1588
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:16,569
when she allowed those things
to happen to you.

1589
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:20,021
She might have been happy
when you ran away

1590
01:14:20,057 --> 01:14:23,482
because she knew
he couldn't hurt you anymore.

1591
01:14:23,562 --> 01:14:25,727
Maybe she loved you that much.

1592
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:29,066
Why don't you call her?

1593
01:14:29,107 --> 01:14:31,678
I'm sure she'd love
to hear from you.

1594
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,227
I can't.

1595
01:14:33,312 --> 01:14:37,821
It's just a phone call, Jules.

1596
01:14:37,905 --> 01:14:39,521
No one should be stuck

1597
01:14:39,522 --> 01:14:40,770
in an emergency room on Christmas

1598
01:14:40,771 --> 01:14:43,524
if they don't want to be.

1599
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,149
Be back in a few minutes.

1600
01:15:26,323 --> 01:15:29,449
I thought I was never
gonna see you again.

1601
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:31,613
Hey.

1602
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:33,118
Long time no see.

1603
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,038
Should I get the nurse?

1604
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:38,864
No.

1605
01:15:40,735 --> 01:15:43,155
What are you still doing here?

1606
01:15:43,191 --> 01:15:45,695
I was waiting for you to wake up.

1607
01:15:46,988 --> 01:15:48,778
Thanks so much
for helping me out.

1608
01:15:48,779 --> 01:15:52,118
I'm very-
very grateful.

1609
01:15:52,162 --> 01:15:55,248
You're welcome.

1610
01:16:03,704 --> 01:16:06,828
Artie, listen to me.

1611
01:16:06,873 --> 01:16:09,539
I want you to know something.

1612
01:16:12,373 --> 01:16:13,962
I forgive you.

1613
01:16:15,754 --> 01:16:17,169
You understand?

1614
01:16:19,796 --> 01:16:22,501
It's over.

1615
01:16:22,582 --> 01:16:24,686
I forgive you for everything.

1616
01:16:40,966 --> 01:16:44,139
Looks like there's somebody
ok to see you.

1617
01:16:51,885 --> 01:16:53,343
Hello, son.

1618
01:16:53,387 --> 01:16:55,715
Hey, Pop.

1619
01:16:57,759 --> 01:17:00,131
You okay?

1620
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,724
Nina, dear.

1621
01:17:44,763 --> 01:17:47,136
I'll be right there.

1622
01:17:47,218 --> 01:17:48,800
Ay, Nina.

1623
01:17:48,842 --> 01:17:51,008
Come and see what I see.

1624
01:18:07,415 --> 01:18:09,207
What are you doing here?

1625
01:18:09,247 --> 01:18:11,648
Listen, I've been thinking
about what you said last night,

1626
01:18:11,649 --> 01:18:13,413
about being scared.

1627
01:18:13,454 --> 01:18:15,223
I shouldn't have
said it like that.

1628
01:18:15,224 --> 01:18:17,407
No, I know what you meant.

1629
01:18:17,491 --> 01:18:19,066
But you're wrong.

1630
01:18:19,107 --> 01:18:20,440
I'm the one that's scared,

1631
01:18:20,441 --> 01:18:22,773
not you.

1632
01:18:22,814 --> 01:18:25,929
Look, it's not
that I don't trust you, Nina.

1633
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:27,260
I don't trust who I am,

1634
01:18:27,261 --> 01:18:29,345
you know?

1635
01:18:29,386 --> 01:18:31,054
What you see in me.

1636
01:18:31,137 --> 01:18:34,756
You know,
I'm just a cop, you know?

1637
01:18:34,799 --> 01:18:36,967
I...

1638
01:18:37,051 --> 01:18:38,335
I don't have a fancy suit

1639
01:18:38,336 --> 01:18:39,624
or a fancy degree on the wall.

1640
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:40,877
I don't have the words

1641
01:18:40,878 --> 01:18:42,245
to make all the things I did
go away.

1642
01:18:42,246 --> 01:18:44,317
I wish I did, but I don't.

1643
01:18:44,998 --> 01:18:49,352
I just know I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1644
01:18:50,169 --> 01:18:51,662
Michael...

1645
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:55,151
Look, if you don't want
to get married,

1646
01:18:55,152 --> 01:18:56,449
it's fine.

1647
01:18:56,533 --> 01:18:58,146
You don't want to see me anymore,

1648
01:18:58,147 --> 01:18:59,398
all right.

1649
01:18:59,438 --> 01:19:02,847
You don't even know
if you love me anymore...

1650
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:04,398
well, I'll just have to
accept that,

1651
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:07,693
because you're more important
to me than us.

1652
01:19:09,766 --> 01:19:11,511
But if you give me
one more chance-

1653
01:19:11,512 --> 01:19:13,583
I know I've said this before,

1654
01:19:13,584 --> 01:19:15,676
but this time,
this is for life-

1655
01:19:15,677 --> 01:19:17,386
I won't let you down.

1656
01:19:17,422 --> 01:19:20,142
I won't-
I won't let you down.

1657
01:19:20,223 --> 01:19:21,705
You have to believe me.
I've changed.

1658
01:19:21,706 --> 01:19:23,793
I'm not the same anymore.

1659
01:19:23,881 --> 01:19:25,596
Mike.

1660
01:19:25,636 --> 01:19:26,835
You don't have to say

1661
01:19:26,836 --> 01:19:28,003
anything right now.

1662
01:19:28,004 --> 01:19:29,411
I want you to think
about what I just told you.

1663
01:19:29,412 --> 01:19:31,526
You know,
it's like you used to tell me.

1664
01:19:31,527 --> 01:19:33,334
I mean, this is it.

1665
01:19:33,376 --> 01:19:35,037
This is forever,

1666
01:19:35,116 --> 01:19:37,135
and I want you to be sure.

1667
01:19:39,877 --> 01:19:41,489
Okay?

1668
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,197
All right.

1669
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,942
Hey, you know, one more thing.

1670
01:19:50,976 --> 01:19:53,404
Whatever you decide, be happy,

1671
01:19:53,446 --> 01:19:57,107
because that's more important
to me than anything.

1672
01:20:13,585 --> 01:20:14,790
Excuse me, nurse.

1673
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:16,827
Have you seen the gentleman
that visits this patient?

1674
01:20:16,828 --> 01:20:18,316
No one comes to visit him.

1675
01:20:18,317 --> 01:20:19,743
I've never seen anyone.

1676
01:20:19,744 --> 01:20:21,079
His friend's name
is Charlie Boyd,

1677
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:22,826
and I saw him here myself
yesterday morning.

1678
01:20:22,827 --> 01:20:24,091
You're mistaken, ma'am.

1679
01:20:24,092 --> 01:20:25,288
This is Charles Boyd,

1680
01:20:25,289 --> 01:20:26,811
and no one has ever
come to see him.

1681
01:20:26,812 --> 01:20:27,874
Excuse me.

1682
01:20:27,915 --> 01:20:29,696
I have rounds to make.

1683
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:52,058
Charlie.

1684
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,386
Oh, my God.

1685
01:20:54,472 --> 01:20:56,591
It is you.

1686
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:18,441
Hey, Charlie.

1687
01:21:28,103 --> 01:21:30,851
Charlie.

1688
01:21:30,934 --> 01:21:32,271
Hi.

1689
01:21:40,056 --> 01:21:41,387
It's okay.

1690
01:21:43,261 --> 01:21:45,335
I'm here now, Charlie.

1691
01:21:48,502 --> 01:21:51,040
You can leave now.

1692
01:21:51,125 --> 01:21:53,291
It's okay to let go.

1693
01:22:03,867 --> 01:22:06,277
Look what you forgot.

1694
01:22:21,643 --> 01:22:23,023
Thank you, Charlie.

1695
01:23:19,962 --> 01:23:21,171
Hi.

1696
01:23:22,298 --> 01:23:23,252
Hi.

1697
01:23:24,618 --> 01:23:26,002
Can I come in?

1698
01:23:26,044 --> 01:23:28,502
Yeah, come on in.

1699
01:23:33,862 --> 01:23:36,784
I thought I'd come by and...

1700
01:23:36,865 --> 01:23:38,984
give you your gift.

1701
01:23:41,105 --> 01:23:43,764
Where is it?

1702
01:23:49,147 --> 01:23:50,687
It's right here.

1703
01:23:59,473 --> 01:24:01,927
Merry Christmas, Mike.

1704
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:04,925
Really?

1705
01:24:06,756 --> 01:24:08,709
Really?

1706
01:24:08,791 --> 01:24:10,966
Yeah.

1707
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,756
Oh, I love you.

1708
01:24:14,798 --> 01:24:15,792
I love you.

1709
01:24:15,877 --> 01:24:17,444
So will you marry me now?

1710
01:24:17,445 --> 01:24:19,829
Yeah.

1711
01:24:19,911 --> 01:24:21,241
Let's get married.

1712
01:24:21,242 --> 01:24:22,908
Oh, my God.
I missed you.

1713
01:24:22,909 --> 01:24:25,367
I love you so much.

1714
01:24:42,141 --> 01:24:43,925
So, Helen,
do you think your daughter

1715
01:24:43,926 --> 01:24:45,760
would go out to dinner with me?

1716
01:24:45,761 --> 01:24:47,383
You know, I was hoping

1717
01:24:47,384 --> 01:24:49,584
you might put in
a good word for me.

1718
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:51,248
What do you think?

1719
01:24:51,334 --> 01:24:52,271
I'm a nice-

1720
01:24:52,298 --> 01:24:53,425
She's eating.

1721
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:56,129
Mom, you're eating.

1722
01:24:56,171 --> 01:24:57,701
That's so great.

1723
01:24:57,787 --> 01:25:00,337
Congratulations.

1724
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:01,289
I was just-

1725
01:25:01,371 --> 01:25:03,199
You're talking, I know that.

1726
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:04,151
She's a great listener.

1727
01:25:04,152 --> 01:25:05,743
Yes, she is.

1728
01:25:05,783 --> 01:25:08,026
I suppose I should
continue my rounds.

1729
01:25:08,027 --> 01:25:09,076
Oh, Doctor.

1730
01:25:11,613 --> 01:25:13,484
What's your first name?

1731
01:25:15,445 --> 01:25:17,612
Matthew.

1732
01:25:17,695 --> 01:25:21,113
That's Matthew, Mom.

1733
01:25:21,196 --> 01:25:22,355
I'm sorry about what you heard

1734
01:25:22,356 --> 01:25:24,930
when I was talking
to your mother.

1735
01:25:25,518 --> 01:25:27,795
You know, as a doctor, you say
things to your patients that-

1736
01:25:27,796 --> 01:25:30,682
You don't really mean.

1737
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:32,128
No, no,
it's just that sometimes-

1738
01:25:32,129 --> 01:25:34,874
You don't... you don't want
to take me to dinner.

1739
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:35,717
No.

1740
01:25:35,804 --> 01:25:38,211
I mean yes.

1741
01:25:38,255 --> 01:25:40,942
I would like
to take you to dinner.

1742
01:25:41,421 --> 01:25:42,839
Oh.

1743
01:25:42,925 --> 01:25:44,786
Well, good, because, uh...

1744
01:25:44,787 --> 01:25:47,995
Well, I think,
I think that's a good idea.

1745
01:25:47,996 --> 01:25:49,416
Really?

1746
01:25:49,455 --> 01:25:52,462
Yes.

1747
01:25:52,505 --> 01:25:53,988
That's great.

1748
01:25:54,033 --> 01:25:55,689
I would really like that.

1749
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,325
Me too.

1750
01:25:57,361 --> 01:25:59,108
Merry Christmas, Rose.

1751
01:25:59,191 --> 01:26:03,231
Merry Christmas, Matthew.

1752
01:26:05,408 --> 01:26:07,153
You too, Helen.

1753
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,143
He seems like a good guy.

1754
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:12,222
What do you think, Mother?

1755
01:26:12,223 --> 01:26:14,393
Do you like him?

1756
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,375
Merry Christmas, Mom.
