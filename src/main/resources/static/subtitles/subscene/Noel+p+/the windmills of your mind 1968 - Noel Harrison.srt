1
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,600
Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,300
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,100
Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,300
Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,000
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,300
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,500
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,600
Like a tunnel you can follow to a tunnel of its own

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,600
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,600
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,900
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,400
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,600
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,500
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,440
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head

16
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,700
When did summer go so quickly? Was it something that you said?

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,700
Lovers walk along a shore, leave their footprints in the sand

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,900
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,200
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,000
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?

21
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,200
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,800
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair

23
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,600
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel

24
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,100
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel

25
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,400
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find 

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,100
In the windmills of your mind...
