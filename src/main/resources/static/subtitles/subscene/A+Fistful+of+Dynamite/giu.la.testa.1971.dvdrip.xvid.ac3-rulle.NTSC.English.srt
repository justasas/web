1
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,482
<i>¡Andale, caballo!</i>

2
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,226
<i>¡Andale, caballo!</i>

3
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,141
<i>¡Señor!</i>

4
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,746
<i>¡Señor!</i>

5
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,275
<i>¡Señor!</i>

6
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,693
<i>- Tighten up that girth.
- Señor, I must go to San Felipe.</i>

7
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,442
My mother is dead!

8
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,145
Straight down the road about 50 miles.

9
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,834
Please?

10
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,484
Yeah, get outta here.

11
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,802
<i>Hey. Hey, amigo.</i>

12
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,303
Come here.

13
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,963
Perfect.

14
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,311
You're perfect!

15
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,707
I swear to God, boys, he's just right.

16
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:43,397
I'm gonna put you on that stage and
watch those faces when they see you come in!

17
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,562
Move.

18
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,037
- By God, I...
- Never mind, dear.

19
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,618
Over there.

20
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,698
Not that door, the other one, there.

21
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,419
Pull. Pull.

22
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:18,946
There you are. Now just sit down
and be quiet, like a good little boy.

23
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,357
You see? He does understand.

24
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,427
Who knows, perhaps he can even talk.

25
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:32,190
Now, now, even the peasants...
A bit of mustard?

26
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,141
Thank you.
Even the peasants are entitled to their rights.

27
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,584
After all, they have won a revolution.

28
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,411
Or at least, almost.

29
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,482
Animals, that's what they are. Animals.

30
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,317
Even animals can be tame and harmless.

31
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,369
Personally, I consider them unfortunate brutes.

32
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,970
Yes, brutes. Quite right.

33
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,237
Precisely, my dear lady, precisely.

34
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:01,811
I hate saying it,
but you should hear them in the confessional.

35
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:06,562
- You would never imagine. Did you know?
- I can imagine, Father.

36
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,518
I can imagine.

37
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,946
Living in such promiscuity,
all of them in one room,

38
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,291
male and female together,
lying in a heap, like rats in a sewer.

39
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:21,035
At night, when the lights are out,
all their inhibitions disappear.

40
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:27,826
You never know who is next:
Mother, sister, daughter... goat.

41
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,270
Every country has its own plague.

42
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:38,294
- Just like them niggers we got back home.
- Just like animals. That's what they are.

43
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,290
Exactly. Which is why they're half-wits.

44
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,299
Hey, you. Do you know who your father was?

45
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,230
Do you know how old you are?

46
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,705
He doesn't know.

47
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:04,051
Do you know how many kids you have? Huh?

48
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,086
Do you know how many kids your mother had?

49
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,392
He doesn't know anything.

50
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,604
It was to benefit scum like this
that the Agrarian Reform was imposed.

51
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:24,455
And that ass, Madero, wanted to give
the government and our land to idiots like this.

52
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,714
We are all pawns in the hands of Almighty God.

53
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,795
Fortunately, Divine Providence
has disposed of that rash individual Madero.

54
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,207
My dear Monsignor, let us be realistic.

55
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:41,338
What you call Providence, I call General Huerta.
He put the peasants in their place.

56
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:45,798
Which is the best place for animals
because that's what they are.

57
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,616
Animals.

58
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,417
<i>I can imagine.</i>

59
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:58,082
- I can imagine, living in such promiscuity...
... wanted to give the government and our land

60
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,963
to idiots like this!

61
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,232
- Goats.
- Animals.

62
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,169
- Rats!
- Just like them niggers we got back home.

63
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,088
- Half-wits!
- Animals!

64
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:11,410
Divine Providence has disposed...

65
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,295
Just like them niggers.

66
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,466
Animals. Because that's what they are. Animals.

67
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,354
...like them niggers.
- Brutes!

68
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,830
That's what they are, animals.

69
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,491
- Like them niggers.
- Brutes!

70
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,163
Animals!

71
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,787
- I consider them unfortunate brutes.
- I can imagine...

72
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,660
Niggers.

73
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,610
- Brutes!
- Niggers!

74
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,771
...like them niggers.
- Idiots!

75
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,579
- Niggers!
- Idiots!

76
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,534
...like them niggers.
- Idiots! Half-wits!

77
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,848
<i>¡Anda, caballo anda!</i>

78
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,025
<i>¡Anda, caballo!</i>

79
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,832
Hey, you, give us a hand and push.

80
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:05,976
<i>- Move, you lazy bunch of greasers!
- ¡Anda!</i>

81
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:11,261
Think they'd get off their asses to help us,
the bastards? Hell, no!

82
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:16,312
<i>¡Anda! ¡Caballo, huyo!</i>

83
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,951
Haaaahh!

84
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,161
Take him away before he dirties everything.

85
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:56,484
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen, you will give
everything to my niños, without any trouble.</i>

86
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,430
<i>We kill them all, OK, Papá?</i>

87
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,629
<i>I've told you, Chulo,
no shooting unless Papá pulls the trigger.</i>

88
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,464
Come.

89
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,641
Come, come, come, come!

90
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,906
You wanted to know my family? That's my sons.

91
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,680
Each one of them from a different mother.

92
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,754
And now, you kneel.

93
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,366
Kneel!

94
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,144
Kneel!

95
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,734
<i>¡Papá!</i>

96
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,868
This is my father. I think.

97
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,493
- Pleased to meet...
- Go inside before Chulo kills everyone.

98
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:04,367
My mother had the blood of the Aztecs,
which was before your people.

99
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,363
And now I ask you a question.

100
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,611
Can you make a baby?

101
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,974
Can you make a baby?

102
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,342
That's sad. But we will fix that.

103
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,578
<i>¡Señora!</i>

104
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,434
<i>Let me go! Let go.</i>

105
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,309
Go on.

106
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,705
Go.

107
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:19,312
<i>Go... go... go... go... go!</i>

108
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,039
Pretty good, huh?

109
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:42,391
Oh, Jesus, help me, I'm going to faint.

110
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:50,077
No, no, no, no, no.
You faint now and you miss the best part.

111
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,153
Juanito, you get everything?

112
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,381
You'll pay for this, you bastard!

113
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:12,725
- I'm a citizen of the United States of America!
- You're an American son of a bitch.

114
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,900
Understand, Yankee?

115
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,216
Thank you.

116
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,441
Thank you. For everything.

117
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,427
Have you a light?

118
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:38,891
Duck, you sucker!

119
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:47,877
There is a hole in the roof.

120
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:57,296
Hey!

121
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:19,322
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Why?

122
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,306
You pull that trigger and shoot me, I fall.

123
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:54,381
And if I fall, they'll have to alter all the maps.

124
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:20,941
You see, when I go,
half this bloody country goes with me.

125
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,270
Including yourself.

126
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:09,543
<i>- You understand now?
- Ah, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí. I understand.</i>

127
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,710
<i>¡Sí!</i>

128
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:15,916
It's like a miracle of God.
You, you are a great magician.

129
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:20,770
I stop your motorcycle,
you do the magic with my coach. We are even.

130
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,169
<i>- Even?
- Sí.</i>

131
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,215
No, we're not even.

132
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,824
To fix my motorcycle would be even.

133
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,253
I'll be inside.

134
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:43,974
<i>Oh! We kill him now, Papá?</i>

135
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:47,478
No. First we fix the motorcycle. Shh!

136
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:05,966
- It's whisky.
- Thank God for that, huh?

137
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:09,341
Where are you going in this contraption?

138
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:12,245
Well... Where are you going?

139
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:17,041
- Shaver Mines.
- Oh-ho.

140
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,033
Lucanina, huh? I know that place.

141
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:24,435
I know the man who owns it,
that fat, German son of a bitch!

142
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:29,183
That crazy tub of lard, Mr Aschenbach,
who wrings our people dry like slaves,

143
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:32,140
even his personal servants.
One girl had an ass:

144
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:36,531
Her cheeks were hard like drums.
I got her pregnant and he...

145
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:41,551
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Will you shut up and go and fix my motorcycle?

146
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:46,218
OK.

147
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:48,945
OK.

148
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,782
Anything you say, Firecracker.

149
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:04,164
<i>Take your hands off that. Now!</i>

150
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:51,970
Well, good for you, Firecracker.

151
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,722
Not even one lousy peso!

152
00:29:55,879 --> 00:30:01,954
I don't know why I named you Napoleon
when you have no imagination. This is a bank!

153
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:05,939
<i>- Mesa Verde.
- Sí, Papá, Mesa Verde. Mesa Verde.</i>

154
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:10,852
If we can get this Firecracker to come with us,
we will be rich.

155
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:14,576
Where does he come in?
The dynamite's right here.

156
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:18,132
No, no. You need an expert for that.

157
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,948
You only need matches and balls.
And I got those.

158
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,230
<i>- ¿Sí?
- ¡Sí!</i>

159
00:30:31,373 --> 00:30:33,364
See that tree over there?

160
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,026
Short fuse.

161
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:29,605
Now you understand
why we need the firecracker?

162
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,301
Huh?

163
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:24,489
- Where the hell are we?
- What kind of work you do for the German?

164
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:30,265
Listen, I asked you a question.
What do you do for the German?

165
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:34,700
- I've been looking for silver for him.
- Silver?

166
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,646
You know something? I don't understand you.

167
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:44,445
Why do you waste your time and your holy water
looking for silver? To me, that's a sin.

168
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:51,850
<i>- Have you any better ideas?
- Sí. Gold is better than silver.</i>

169
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,546
There isn't any gold in these hills.

170
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,934
<i>Yes, there is.</i>

171
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:59,312
In Mesa Verde.

172
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:05,041
Mesa Verde? It's a city.

173
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:10,205
Of course.
Whoever heard of having a bank in the country!

174
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,764
Uh-huh. A bank?

175
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,958
<i>Not a bank. The bank.</i>

176
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:29,620
The most beautiful, wonderful, fantastic,
gorgeous, magnificent bank in the world.

177
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,664
When you stand before the bank

178
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:37,821
and you see it has the gates of gold,
like it was the gates of heaven.

179
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:43,679
<i>And when you go inside,
everything, everything is gold.</i>

180
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,920
Gold spittoons, gold handles. And money.

181
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,367
Money, money is everywhere.

182
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:55,831
I know, 'cause I saw when I was
eight years old. I went there with my father.

183
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:00,809
<i>He tried to rob the bank. They caught him,
but they won't catch me. ¿Eh, Papá?</i>

184
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,461
Right.

185
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:05,522
Listen, Firecracker, you listen to me.

186
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,577
Listen, why don't you come with me

187
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,334
and we will work together?

188
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:18,532
And we will become rich.

189
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,907
What the hell is your name?

190
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,202
John.

191
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:32,413
What?

192
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:36,019
John.

193
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:42,225
- What is your name?
- John.

194
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:46,184
<i>That's fantastic. That is incredible.</i>

195
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:49,869
My name is Juan and yours is John.
Juan and John.

196
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,822
So what?

197
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:55,702
Can't you understand that is, that is the...

198
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,945
Oh...

199
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,069
Destiny.

200
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:39,293
No. And I mean it.

201
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,340
Why?

202
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:46,422
You want more money? I'll give you more
than half. I don't care about the money.

203
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:49,439
As long as we can work together.

204
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,597
Listen what I'm telling you.

205
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:53,405
We are like two brothers.

206
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:59,841
You make the holes with the holy water
and then I walk in and do the dirty work.

207
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:04,413
<i>Listen, it takes one bandito to know another.</i>

208
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:29,320
- So you can read?
- You don't have to read.

209
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:35,031
I see a man's picture, I see a price,
I know that man is in trouble.

210
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:44,525
Hey, what kind of trouble are you in?

211
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:55,264
- Oh, we fought a revolution in Ireland.
- A revolution?

212
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:59,017
Seems revolutions are all over the world,
like the crops.

213
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:02,175
We had a revolution.
The brave people went in.

214
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:09,024
What it did to them was terrible. Pancho Villa,
the world's best bandit chief, two balls like a bull,

215
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:14,301
he went in the revolution as a great bandit,
came out as what? Nothing.

216
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:18,082
A general. That, to me, is the bullshit.

217
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:27,114
Wait a minute.
You come here to join the revolution?

218
00:39:29,327 --> 00:39:31,363
No, no.

219
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:35,800
One was enough for me.

220
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:44,691
Stop! You dirty...

221
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,721
...son of a bitch!

222
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:50,166
Gringo... bastard!

223
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:44,932
Hey!

224
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,740
Duck, you sucker!

225
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:08,081
- Say, which way is it to Lucanina?
- Fuck you! Go find it yourself!

226
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:13,999
Mexico is big,
but for you, it is going to be very big!

227
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:09,106
<i>John, where are you? It's us!</i>

228
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:16,978
Come on, come on, you.

229
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:24,285
Come on in there.

230
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:27,952
Just a little further inside.

231
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:31,698
That's right, heathen bastards.

232
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,873
What's this?
You crazy? You talk to yourself now?

233
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:40,987
Oh, my friend, didn't I tell you Mexico was big?

234
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:47,072
Oh, shit.

235
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:49,920
Who are those people inside?

236
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:54,596
<i>You mean, who were those people inside?</i>

237
00:46:19,946 --> 00:46:23,222
Who were they? Who were those people inside?

238
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:25,129
<i>Chulo!</i>

239
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:32,747
Who were those people, for Christ's sake?

240
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:38,280
Well, one of them was Aschenbach,
then there was three soldiers and one captain.

241
00:46:38,631 --> 00:46:41,270
Everybody dead in there.

242
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:45,184
Will you keep quiet
and go get our friend's equipment together?

243
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:52,396
Anyway, when I went to Aschenbach
and I told him,

244
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:56,764
I said you wanted to see him,
he wouldn't believe that.

245
00:46:57,067 --> 00:47:00,264
I said, "That's too bad
because he's discovered silver. "

246
00:47:00,528 --> 00:47:02,484
Then he was ready to come running.

247
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:07,896
The other one, the captain... I think the captain
and Aschenbach were working together.

248
00:47:08,244 --> 00:47:11,042
The captain says, "I want to see the man. "

249
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:18,365
I said, "How can you see him? He's blown off
his hand with dynamite, he is bleeding to death. "

250
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:22,995
When they heard that,
they broke their asses to get here.

251
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:28,485
Anyway, it's no problem because
there are diamonds here, no questions.

252
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:33,005
Also, you have no contract, so... you are free.

253
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:38,589
There will be one little problem, with the army.

254
00:47:38,858 --> 00:47:43,886
They will have a hot ass
when it comes to the death of a captain.

255
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,027
But don't worry.
I am your friend Juan and I will help.

256
00:47:48,326 --> 00:47:50,601
I will do anything, say anything...

257
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:56,142
No, no, no. I don't need any help from you
to know I've been screwed.

258
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:00,164
You fuckin' chicken thief.

259
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:10,493
What do you want with me?

260
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:15,759
Nothing.

261
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:19,312
I just thought that maybe...

262
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:24,109
...we could go to Mesa Verde.

263
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:33,280
The bank. Isn't there anything else
you remember about Mesa Verde?

264
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,698
Yes, there's a place
where you can sit down and eat.

265
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:40,834
- When you look in front, you...
- See the bank.

266
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:43,237
That's right. How do you know?

267
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:48,398
Listen, Mesa Verde, that's only the beginning.

268
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:55,311
<i>Let me tell you, it will be Juan and John,
the two especialistas in banks, eh?</i>

269
00:48:57,604 --> 00:49:01,119
We'll call it Johnny and Johnny.
That's more American.

270
00:49:01,399 --> 00:49:04,914
<i>Amigo, we go to America,
there are banks all over the place.</i>

271
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:08,665
In California, Colorado,
Kansas City, Texas and Austin.

272
00:49:08,948 --> 00:49:13,738
You have to think of the big future
that we have ahead of us.

273
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,912
I'm thinking of the big train behind us.

274
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:20,157
Hey! Out of the way!

275
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:03,111
Hey, you.

276
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:06,735
I know that face.

277
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:10,080
Where have I seen you before?

278
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:42,336
<i>Stop right where you are!</i>

279
00:53:49,729 --> 00:53:51,720
Drop that knife, you bastard.

280
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,804
I have family.

281
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,590
I have a family too.

282
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:27,068
Beautiful, eh?

283
00:56:27,303 --> 00:56:29,498
<i>My children!</i>

284
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:40,826
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno, dos, uno, dos!
¡Pelotón... izquierda!</i>

285
00:56:43,236 --> 00:56:45,909
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno, dos, uno, dos!</i>

286
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:53,933
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno, dos, uno, dos!</i>

287
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:30,731
<i>¿Tienen algo qué pedir?</i>

288
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:49,572
<i>¿Ytu?</i>

289
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,799
<i>Listos.</i>

290
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,779
<i>¡Armas!</i>

291
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:31,818
<i>¡Preparen!</i>

292
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,551
<i>Apunten.</i>

293
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:48,350
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

294
00:58:58,955 --> 00:59:02,345
Hey, God, you're sure this is Mesa Verde?

295
01:00:46,438 --> 01:00:49,316
Do you have your beans with chilli?

296
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:51,921
I don't want nothing from you.

297
01:00:52,152 --> 01:00:55,861
- Aw, come on, have some beans.
- Listen, you son of a bitch!

298
01:00:56,156 --> 01:01:00,149
You pull that trick on me again,
I break your goddamn head!

299
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:04,270
Well, for Christ's sake.

300
01:01:05,623 --> 01:01:07,853
A train comes along and I take it.

301
01:01:08,084 --> 01:01:12,362
- Been waiting in your Mesa Verde ever since.
- It's not my Mesa Verde.

302
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:17,621
- This place is covered with soldiers like flies.
- Just the way we like it.

303
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:21,189
Just the way we like it?

304
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:28,583
If it's a revolution... it's confusion.

305
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:17,400
What are you talking about?
Revolution, confusion?

306
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:23,569
Where there's confusion,
a man who knows what he wants...

307
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:28,264
...stands a good chance of getting it.
- I don't understand you.

308
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:38,690
This him?

309
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:45,546
That's him.

310
01:02:50,729 --> 01:02:52,685
Him who?

311
01:02:52,897 --> 01:02:55,092
- Do you trust me?
- No.

312
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:58,434
<i>- You want to get inside there?
- Sí.</i>

313
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:03,610
Well, I'm going to see to it
you have that chance. Come on.

314
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:26,879
<i>Don't move, goddamn it!
Hold him still.</i>

315
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:04,299
That does it. Relax now. Relax.

316
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:07,813
It's all over.

317
01:04:08,974 --> 01:04:14,492
If you'd let this infection go any longer,
your widow would be paying my bill.

318
01:04:21,611 --> 01:04:23,203
Mallory!

319
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:26,992
You've hardly joined us here in Mesa Verde.

320
01:04:27,993 --> 01:04:30,632
Already, you're front-page news.

321
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:35,197
"Irish dynamiter wanted for murder. "

322
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:44,843
You have a real talent for making friends.

323
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:49,052
<i>You've stirred up a hornet's nest.</i>

324
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:53,469
I'll grant you the captain, but...

325
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:58,315
...till now, nobody dared
take a crack at foreign capitalists.

326
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:01,886
Not even Pancho Villa.

327
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:08,022
It seems even His Majesty's Secret Service
would like to get their hands on you.

328
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:12,799
And yet, you are an asset to us.

329
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:17,216
Even if sometimes, you do drink a bit too much.

330
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,650
Who says I drink too much?

331
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:22,804
Your liver does.

332
01:05:23,006 --> 01:05:25,440
What about that one, him?

333
01:05:26,634 --> 01:05:28,511
He's all right.

334
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,917
Except that when operating,
he cuts deeper than I do.

335
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:37,570
What the doctor means is,
one time we did a little work together.

336
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:41,088
And now, to our work, friends.

337
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,351
I have good news.

338
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:51,122
In two days, Villa and Zapata
will attack simultaneously from north and south.

339
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:58,577
We here, like those in other cities,
must begin parallel actions of harassment.

340
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:01,875
Pereto's downfall is just a question of weeks.

341
01:06:03,171 --> 01:06:07,722
Whereas Miguel's is only a question of hours
if he doesn't stop smoking.

342
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:10,440
Easy to say.

343
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:18,468
We'll attack in four places at the same time.
Antonio, you hit the city hall and old prisons.

344
01:06:18,895 --> 01:06:24,174
You will need to divide into two groups,
one of them under the command of José.

345
01:06:24,526 --> 01:06:29,122
Jesús, the railway station
and the marshalling yards as planned, right?

346
01:06:29,447 --> 01:06:33,759
Get in position in good time in small groups,
so you won't attract attention.

347
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:37,353
And act like ordinary travellers,
or railroad employees.

348
01:06:37,622 --> 01:06:42,776
You, Manolo, together with Juanito, will attack
the army barracks with our main forces, agreed?

349
01:06:44,045 --> 01:06:50,393
This is their point of maximum concentration,
and is the key to the success of our plan.

350
01:06:50,802 --> 01:06:54,192
You must create
the impression of a massive attack.

351
01:06:54,472 --> 01:06:57,987
And if necessary,
be prepared to make the final sacrifice.

352
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:02,735
The fourth and last target,
Ortega, the post office.

353
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:08,150
When the enemy is busy on four fronts,

354
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:10,879
we'll move against our real objective.

355
01:07:11,948 --> 01:07:14,257
Do we still agree?

356
01:07:16,494 --> 01:07:20,533
- You'll need men.
- I only need one man.

357
01:07:22,542 --> 01:07:24,533
One?

358
01:07:24,753 --> 01:07:26,709
<i>Sí.</i>

359
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:29,477
Him?

360
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:33,337
Him? Him?

361
01:07:33,553 --> 01:07:39,025
What is with this "him"? Him who? Who him?
To do what? That's what I want to know!

362
01:07:39,392 --> 01:07:41,906
To attack the bank.

363
01:07:43,647 --> 01:07:46,286
The bank?

364
01:07:46,524 --> 01:07:49,163
We will take care of the bank.

365
01:07:49,402 --> 01:07:52,712
That's why we're here,
so don't worry about that.

366
01:07:55,158 --> 01:07:57,547
Well, then, what can I say?

367
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:01,521
Except... I hope you make it.

368
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:04,952
Me too. And him.

369
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:11,460
Well, we'll meet again tonight to discuss details.
I have to go now.

370
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:17,079
I left a woman in labour
and she can't wait till the revolution is over.

371
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:23,695
<i>- Tierra y libertad.
- ¡Tierra y libertad!</i>

372
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,438
Leave one at a time and keep out of sight.

373
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:30,769
Speaking of sight, how's your cataract?

374
01:08:30,986 --> 01:08:34,262
At least I have a good eye. With the other...

375
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:37,523
Shh! You don't have to say anything.

376
01:08:39,577 --> 01:08:41,966
I understand everything.

377
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:45,257
<i>¡Tierra y libertad!</i>

378
01:08:46,418 --> 01:08:48,568
<i>Ylibertad.</i>

379
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:19,318
<i>¡Capitán! ¡Avíselas, Capitán!</i>

380
01:10:20,136 --> 01:10:22,445
<i>¡Pronto! ¡Hola, muénvase!</i>

381
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,469
Go.

382
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:49,924
<i>Psst, psst! ¡Oye!</i>

383
01:10:55,630 --> 01:10:57,621
Bravo, Chulo.

384
01:11:01,386 --> 01:11:03,616
Take it, take it.

385
01:11:16,151 --> 01:11:20,941
There must be a lot of money in the bank,
look at all those soldiers.

386
01:11:27,037 --> 01:11:31,349
<i>- You know how this works?
- Sí. It's a...</i>

387
01:11:32,584 --> 01:11:34,575
...short fuse.

388
01:11:35,712 --> 01:11:37,703
- No.
- No?

389
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:40,671
Normal rate.

390
01:11:40,884 --> 01:11:42,681
30 seconds.

391
01:11:43,845 --> 01:11:46,723
<i>Sí. 30 seconds.</i>

392
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:55,159
- What did you find?
- Nothing but scrap paper.

393
01:12:58,753 --> 01:13:01,984
Wait a minute. Hey, it's pointing down there.

394
01:13:18,273 --> 01:13:19,706
Psst!

395
01:15:40,707 --> 01:15:42,698
There is the safe!

396
01:16:09,653 --> 01:16:11,644
Duck, you suckers!

397
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:56,890
- Where are you going, for Christ's sake?
- I don't know, but something's wrong.

398
01:16:57,242 --> 01:17:00,996
I went into the bank.
There's no money there, nothing.

399
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:05,360
The bank and the money were transferred
to Mexico City a month ago.

400
01:17:05,667 --> 01:17:09,546
They've been using this place
for a political prison ever since.

401
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:16,091
- What? A political prison?
- I never said a thing about money.

402
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:19,696
All I asked was if you wanted to get inside.

403
01:17:19,973 --> 01:17:23,443
But this bank is my life, this is my dream.

404
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:31,361
The reality is, you've just liberated 150 patriots
through sheer courage in the face of danger.

405
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:41,642
Ah, yes...

406
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:47,273
...you're a grand hero of the revolution now.

407
01:17:48,793 --> 01:17:52,786
<i>- I Vívela, Juan!
- I don't want to be a hero. I want the money!</i>

408
01:17:53,089 --> 01:17:54,727
The money!

409
01:17:55,842 --> 01:17:59,357
- You taught me one thing.
- What?

410
01:18:00,305 --> 01:18:02,694
How to get fucked!

411
01:19:29,853 --> 01:19:33,129
- What's that?
- It's a map.

412
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:39,162
It's your country you're lying all over.

413
01:19:40,572 --> 01:19:45,168
Not my country.
My country is me and my family.

414
01:19:45,493 --> 01:19:48,053
Well, your country's also Huerta...

415
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:51,192
...and the Governor and landlords.

416
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:54,517
And Gunther Ruiz and his locusts.

417
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:58,264
- This little revolution we're having here.
- Revolution?

418
01:19:58,506 --> 01:20:03,580
Please don't try to tell me about revolution!
I know how revolutions start.

419
01:20:03,928 --> 01:20:08,046
People that read books
go to people that don't read books and say,

420
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,500
- "The time has come for change. "
- Shh!

421
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:13,366
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shit, shush!

422
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:18,042
I know what I'm talking about
when I'm talking about revolutions!

423
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:23,559
The people who read books go to the people
who can't read and say, "We need change,"

424
01:20:23,907 --> 01:20:26,057
so the poor people make the change.

425
01:20:26,284 --> 01:20:31,881
The people who read the books sit around
big polished tables and talk and talk and eat.

426
01:20:32,248 --> 01:20:35,160
But what has happened to the poor people?

427
01:20:36,127 --> 01:20:38,322
They are dead!

428
01:20:40,507 --> 01:20:42,498
That's your revolution.

429
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:51,518
Shh.

430
01:20:51,726 --> 01:20:55,844
So please, don't tell me about revolutions.

431
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,556
Then what happens?
The same fucking thing starts all over again!

432
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,975
<i>¡Capitán!</i>

433
01:22:09,512 --> 01:22:11,867
<i>¡Vamos!</i>

434
01:22:26,738 --> 01:22:28,854
I don't like it either.

435
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:34,910
Only Gunther Ruiz is less than 20 miles
from here, on the road that leads to that bridge.

436
01:22:35,288 --> 01:22:38,200
They will comb the area bush by bush.

437
01:22:38,458 --> 01:22:42,610
So the order is to pull back,
hide in the San Ysidro caves.

438
01:22:42,921 --> 01:22:44,912
Oh, that's a brilliant order.

439
01:22:47,217 --> 01:22:49,128
Here we are, facing it.

440
01:22:50,261 --> 01:22:54,812
You, and the rest of you dreamers,
want to piss it up against the wall!

441
01:22:55,141 --> 01:22:57,450
Not everybody can fight.

442
01:22:57,686 --> 01:22:59,995
There are those who must organise,
co-ordinate.

443
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:02,221
Yes, yes, of course.

444
01:23:04,943 --> 01:23:07,138
Yeah, well...

445
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:09,353
...don't pay any attention to me.

446
01:23:10,657 --> 01:23:13,251
It's personal.

447
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:26,635
Sorry about those orders. I'm staying.

448
01:23:28,466 --> 01:23:31,026
I don't give a fuck about your revolutions.

449
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:36,289
I'm tired of running up and down these
mountains and getting nowhere, so I've stopped.

450
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:39,792
Right here, at the bridge of San Jorge.

451
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:47,038
Maybe it's out of spite for you
and your slow dream, or maybe...

452
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:51,588
Ah, maybe my feet are sore.

453
01:24:00,498 --> 01:24:06,937
<i>If he's gonna stay, I'm gonna stay.
Maybe 'cause my feet are sore too, huh?</i>

454
01:24:09,591 --> 01:24:15,382
<i>¡Hombres! Me and irlandés are gonna catch
ourselves a couple of fucking locusts.</i>

455
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:20,610
<i>¡Atente! You go back and hide in the grotto.</i>

456
01:24:20,894 --> 01:24:24,773
If things go bad here, every man for himself.

457
01:24:25,065 --> 01:24:27,818
<i>You move your asses! ¿Comprenden?</i>

458
01:24:59,808 --> 01:25:04,882
If something happens
and your father doesn't come back,

459
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:09,542
then I pray that the great God in heaven
takes care of you.

460
01:25:34,509 --> 01:25:38,184
Well... Good luck.

461
01:25:38,471 --> 01:25:40,063
Thank you.

462
01:26:03,496 --> 01:26:08,490
<i>Listen, when they are out of sight,
we will make a run for it. ¿Sí?</i>

463
01:26:16,384 --> 01:26:22,141
No? You can't mean to stay here? All those
explosions must have gone to your head!

464
01:26:26,227 --> 01:26:29,742
Remember John and Juan?

465
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:33,117
America.

466
01:26:34,152 --> 01:26:35,949
The millions.

467
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:38,323
No?

468
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,712
No.

469
01:26:41,826 --> 01:26:45,705
I don't understand!
Wasn't that was a trick for us to get out?

470
01:26:45,997 --> 01:26:50,752
- What can we do against those locusts?
- You'd be doing me a favour if you'd leave.

471
01:26:51,086 --> 01:26:56,922
If I had a choice between a chicken thief
and ridding the world of a few uniforms,

472
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,495
I'd not choose the chicken thief.

473
01:27:02,347 --> 01:27:03,860
OK.

474
01:27:07,268 --> 01:27:09,065
OK.

475
01:27:10,438 --> 01:27:12,076
No!

476
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:17,882
Oh, no, no. You will like that, huh?

477
01:27:18,822 --> 01:27:25,455
Well, you listen to me, you Irish piece of shit!

478
01:27:26,413 --> 01:27:31,123
You think you're the only man
with the balls to stay? You are wrong!

479
01:27:31,459 --> 01:27:34,815
I have the balls and I stay.

480
01:27:54,232 --> 01:27:58,748
He says there's no danger,
just watch the bridge from a long way.

481
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:04,990
No matter how I look with them,
I'm still too close to the bridge.

482
01:28:06,244 --> 01:28:09,361
Why am I mixed up in this revolution anyway?

483
01:28:09,622 --> 01:28:15,458
God, why didn't you strike me down
instead of letting me say, "I stay too"?

484
01:28:16,671 --> 01:28:20,346
Oh, look at him! All because of him.

485
01:28:20,634 --> 01:28:23,387
He acts like a tourist, only he's staying.

486
01:28:23,637 --> 01:28:26,026
<i>Look at him.</i>

487
01:28:26,264 --> 01:28:28,858
What the hell does he care?

488
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,455
He is having fun.

489
01:28:31,686 --> 01:28:36,043
I'm glad he's having fun, God,
because I am not having fun.

490
01:28:36,358 --> 01:28:38,394
Oh-ho, no.

491
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:43,432
Hey...

492
01:28:44,866 --> 01:28:47,141
What's this?

493
01:28:51,915 --> 01:28:54,110
Now he goes to sleep, huh?

494
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:58,221
Go ahead, you sleep, sleep.

495
01:28:59,172 --> 01:29:03,006
I tell you something, when he's asleep, I'll go.
Shh!

496
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,353
May the good Lord watch over you.

497
01:29:56,021 --> 01:29:58,091
Stop over there, Sergeant.

498
01:30:27,135 --> 01:30:28,932
Hey!

499
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:36,850
God, only an idiot could sleep at a time like this!

500
01:30:41,358 --> 01:30:42,916
Hey!

501
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:21,166
Abandon the trucks!
Break ranks and take cover under the bridge!

502
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:24,450
Artillery, fire. The bridge!

503
01:37:45,573 --> 01:37:47,768
All of them.

504
01:37:50,161 --> 01:37:52,436
Six.

505
01:37:56,042 --> 01:37:59,398
I've never counted them before.

506
01:39:45,318 --> 01:39:47,593
No, Juan, no.

507
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:51,257
No, for Christ's sake.
They're waiting for you out there.

508
01:42:38,533 --> 01:42:40,603
<i>¡No se mueven!</i>

509
01:42:40,827 --> 01:42:42,818
<i>¡Capitán!</i>

510
01:42:45,707 --> 01:42:49,336
<i>Hold it!
Move that bastard out of the truck.</i>

511
01:42:49,628 --> 01:42:52,506
<i>See that he gets to the camp alive!</i>

512
01:46:02,487 --> 01:46:04,717
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno!</i>

513
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:17,874
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno, dos!</i>

514
01:46:22,924 --> 01:46:25,996
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno, dos, uno, dos!</i>

515
01:46:27,554 --> 01:46:30,512
<i>¡Pelotón alto!</i>

516
01:46:32,726 --> 01:46:34,125
<i>¡Izquierda!</i>

517
01:46:34,311 --> 01:46:36,302
<i>¡Posición de tiro!</i>

518
01:46:43,695 --> 01:46:45,208
<i>¿Tienen algo qué pedir?</i>

519
01:46:51,202 --> 01:46:53,477
<i>Pelotón...</i>

520
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,195
<i>¡Preparen!</i>

521
01:46:59,419 --> 01:47:01,535
<i>¡Armas!</i>

522
01:47:02,672 --> 01:47:04,628
<i>¡Apunten!</i>

523
01:50:50,442 --> 01:50:52,433
<i>¿Tienes algo qué pedir?</i>

524
01:51:43,954 --> 01:51:46,263
<i>¡Posición de tiro!</i>

525
01:51:52,671 --> 01:51:54,901
<i>¡Preparen armas!</i>

526
01:51:58,551 --> 01:51:59,825
<i>¡Apunten!</i>

527
01:52:00,011 --> 01:52:02,002
<i>Duck, you suckers!</i>

528
01:54:50,598 --> 01:54:53,749
<i>¡Preparen! ¡Armas!</i>

529
01:55:00,817 --> 01:55:02,216
<i>¡Apunten!</i>

530
01:55:02,402 --> 01:55:03,596
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

531
01:57:18,788 --> 01:57:21,222
But for the rich, you sing.

532
01:57:35,472 --> 01:57:37,702
Oh, Jesus, Juan.

533
01:57:43,146 --> 01:57:48,345
Anyway, if they ever get this thing under way,
you might be able to...

534
01:57:48,693 --> 01:57:53,972
...might be make the border by, what,
some time tonight, don't you think?

535
01:57:58,370 --> 01:58:02,409
America. It's America, Juan!

536
01:58:03,583 --> 01:58:07,656
Oh, Jesus, if it's as great as they say it is,

537
01:58:07,963 --> 01:58:10,272
filled bags stuffed full of dreams...

538
01:58:10,507 --> 01:58:12,384
Juan?

539
01:58:16,930 --> 01:58:19,490
Oh, Jesus.

540
01:58:22,894 --> 01:58:25,328
Jesus, Juan.

541
01:58:27,649 --> 01:58:31,119
What is it, Juan and... John?

542
01:58:33,071 --> 01:58:35,790
Johnny and Johnny?

543
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:40,230
I make the holes and you get in. 50-50, right?

544
02:00:04,829 --> 02:00:06,785
What's happening?

545
02:00:07,582 --> 02:00:10,574
Oh, they're just moving the train around.

546
02:00:11,419 --> 02:00:13,728
Seems we'll be leaving shortly.

547
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:18,412
The uniforms have loaded the last of their shit.

548
02:03:17,814 --> 02:03:20,453
Get out of the way.

549
02:03:29,409 --> 02:03:32,685
What do you want from me, you scum?

550
02:03:32,954 --> 02:03:34,751
Let me by.

551
02:05:23,982 --> 02:05:26,177
It's yours.

552
02:05:29,821 --> 02:05:32,733
There's a fortune inside.

553
02:05:32,991 --> 02:05:36,028
Money, jewels...

554
02:05:37,746 --> 02:05:39,623
...pearls.

555
02:07:26,938 --> 02:07:29,406
<i>¡Jóvenes, a México!</i>

556
02:07:57,552 --> 02:08:01,431
Well, this will not be going to America.

557
02:08:01,723 --> 02:08:04,681
<i>Maybe the train won't, but we will.</i>

558
02:08:18,073 --> 02:08:20,189
Hey...

559
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:24,196
Which way is America?

560
02:08:28,959 --> 02:08:33,589
Well, it's sure as hell not that way.
That's the way.

561
02:08:37,884 --> 02:08:40,273
Well, then...

562
02:08:46,518 --> 02:08:48,509
...let's go.

563
02:09:06,538 --> 02:09:09,371
Even Pancho Villa's heard much about you.

564
02:09:09,624 --> 02:09:13,139
He's always saying,
"I want to meet this Miranda. "

565
02:09:17,382 --> 02:09:19,373
Me?

566
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:22,914
That's right.

567
02:09:23,138 --> 02:09:26,972
<i>The military junta commander
told us everything that you've done.</i>

568
02:09:27,267 --> 02:09:30,737
Whatever you heard, I assure you,
they were only words.

569
02:09:31,938 --> 02:09:36,090
Words cannot describe
what Juan has done and suffered for the cause.

570
02:09:38,945 --> 02:09:41,300
Hey, doctor.

571
02:09:43,074 --> 02:09:45,349
How you been, eh?

572
02:09:46,202 --> 02:09:49,478
This is a man who should talk to Villa.

573
02:09:50,999 --> 02:09:53,467
Hey.

574
02:09:56,171 --> 02:09:58,162
John.

575
02:10:01,801 --> 02:10:03,951
Doctor.

576
02:10:07,849 --> 02:10:10,158
We thought we'd lost you, doctor.

577
02:10:27,786 --> 02:10:30,061
Have you got a light?

578
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:39,085
Listen, Gunther Ruiz is after us
and Villa wants to talk to me.

579
02:10:39,422 --> 02:10:41,697
We should get outta here.

580
02:10:43,009 --> 02:10:49,084
Jesus, Juan, you can't leave now.
You're a glorious hero of the revolution.

581
02:10:49,474 --> 02:10:51,146
Can I tell you something?

582
02:10:51,351 --> 02:10:53,342
Fuck you!

583
02:10:58,692 --> 02:11:00,967
That's all.

584
02:11:14,749 --> 02:11:19,869
A military train carrying over 1,000 soldiers and
heavy weapons is heading straight towards us.

585
02:11:20,213 --> 02:11:22,727
What about Villa's troops?

586
02:11:22,966 --> 02:11:27,994
He met resistance in the Sierra,
and asks us to hold out for 24 hours.

587
02:11:37,314 --> 02:11:40,226
- Where the hell are we?
- Approximately here.

588
02:11:41,860 --> 02:11:44,658
Ah, it's a beautiful desert there.

589
02:11:44,904 --> 02:11:47,623
Not a stream or a canyon in 100 miles.

590
02:11:47,866 --> 02:11:52,701
- How long you think it'll take them to get here?
- Three hours, more or less.

591
02:11:53,038 --> 02:11:54,949
Three hours.

592
02:12:08,053 --> 02:12:13,002
Well, it looks as though
we'll have to stop 'em right here, doesn't it?

593
02:12:14,851 --> 02:12:18,241
All that takes
is unbolting a couple of yards of track.

594
02:12:18,521 --> 02:12:21,638
But then what? They'd still slaughter us.

595
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:23,219
Wait.

596
02:12:23,401 --> 02:12:26,393
There's more than one way to stop a train.

597
02:12:28,073 --> 02:12:31,622
- How much dynamite have we?
- Maybe 200 Ibs.

598
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:34,265
Is that enough for you?

599
02:12:35,705 --> 02:12:38,617
Oh, yes. It'll have to do all right.

600
02:12:39,459 --> 02:12:44,249
<i>- But I also need a locomotive and a man.
- Sí, sí, sí. OK.</i>

601
02:12:46,549 --> 02:12:48,221
OK.

602
02:12:48,426 --> 02:12:54,296
- Someone who's brave and loyal to the cause.
- Never mind that. What do I have to do?

603
02:12:56,559 --> 02:12:58,470
Someone like Dr Villega.

604
02:13:05,402 --> 02:13:07,996
Well...

605
02:13:09,322 --> 02:13:13,793
<i>- I... I'm honoured.
- I don't doubt it, doctor.</i>

606
02:13:14,995 --> 02:13:19,307
Also, because an old friend of ours
is in command of that train.

607
02:13:19,624 --> 02:13:21,660
A Colonel Gunther Ruiz.

608
02:14:31,613 --> 02:14:36,050
<i>Let's get shovelling, man.
We'll never get up enough pressure that way.</i>

609
02:14:50,465 --> 02:14:53,662
Come on, put your back in it, Villega.

610
02:15:02,519 --> 02:15:07,035
Let's stop pretending, right away.
You know everything, don't you?

611
02:15:07,357 --> 02:15:11,953
- You sensed it, or guessed it.
- Simpler than that, Villega.

612
02:15:12,279 --> 02:15:15,954
I saw you, that night in the rain.

613
02:15:26,501 --> 02:15:30,653
I see.
You've already judged and condemned me.

614
02:15:41,016 --> 02:15:44,850
That's why you brought me with you. To kill me.

615
02:15:46,104 --> 02:15:49,858
It's easy to judge. Have you ever been tortured?

616
02:15:50,150 --> 02:15:54,826
Are you sure you wouldn't talk?
I was sure. And yet I talked.

617
02:15:56,323 --> 02:16:01,078
Some men died because of me.
What should I do? Kill myself? Why?

618
02:16:01,411 --> 02:16:04,369
The dead remain dead, but I have not changed.

619
02:16:04,623 --> 02:16:09,139
I still believe in the same things.
I can still serve the cause.

620
02:16:09,461 --> 02:16:12,453
Shut up, Villega! Shut up, for Christ's sake.

621
02:18:23,261 --> 02:18:29,416
When I started using dynamite,
I believed in many things. All of it!

622
02:18:31,478 --> 02:18:33,833
Finally, I believe only in dynamite.

623
02:18:34,981 --> 02:18:36,972
I don't judge you, Villega.

624
02:18:39,778 --> 02:18:42,929
I did that only once in my life.

625
02:18:44,366 --> 02:18:46,596
Get shovelling!

626
02:20:23,006 --> 02:20:25,759
<i>The end of the line, Villega.</i>

627
02:20:28,595 --> 02:20:30,870
And I can't help you now.

628
02:20:45,946 --> 02:20:48,858
Just close your eyes and jump.

629
02:20:56,539 --> 02:20:59,258
For Christ's sake, save yourself!

630
02:21:17,435 --> 02:21:20,108
<i>¡Dios mío, frena!</i>

631
02:25:09,584 --> 02:25:11,461
Oh, shit...

632
02:25:15,048 --> 02:25:17,004
God...

633
02:26:36,796 --> 02:26:38,752
Hey.

634
02:26:38,965 --> 02:26:42,241
Man, remember, huh?

635
02:26:44,387 --> 02:26:47,026
You remember what you told me, huh?

636
02:26:47,807 --> 02:26:50,480
You told me about America.

637
02:26:51,311 --> 02:26:55,509
And the banks and the gold.

638
02:26:55,815 --> 02:26:59,285
Like you told me on the train, remember?

639
02:27:03,823 --> 02:27:05,973
Hey, hey.

640
02:27:07,494 --> 02:27:09,769
Hey.

641
02:27:11,331 --> 02:27:16,928
No, you son of a bitch. Come on,
you son of a bitch. You know, you told me that.

642
02:27:17,295 --> 02:27:21,527
You leave me now,
what the fuck is gonna happen to me?

643
02:27:24,094 --> 02:27:28,884
- You'll make it, General.
- Oh, shit, I don't want to be a general.

644
02:27:35,355 --> 02:27:37,664
Come on, talk to me.

645
02:27:37,899 --> 02:27:39,617
Keep talking.

646
02:27:39,818 --> 02:27:43,731
Talk. Tell me about Villega, Villega.
Remember Villega?

647
02:27:44,030 --> 02:27:46,305
<i>- Villega?
- Sí.</i>

648
02:27:47,409 --> 02:27:49,798
He died.

649
02:27:51,329 --> 02:27:54,560
He died a great...

650
02:27:55,792 --> 02:27:59,501
...grand, glorious hero of the revolution.

651
02:28:19,107 --> 02:28:20,984
OK.

652
02:28:21,901 --> 02:28:26,770
Easy, easy. I'll go, I'll get help, huh?

653
02:28:33,371 --> 02:28:35,089
General?

654
02:28:41,296 --> 02:28:43,287
<i>- Have you a light?
- Sí.</i>

655
02:29:22,379 --> 02:29:24,734
Oh, my friend...

656
02:29:26,132 --> 02:29:29,249
...I'd hate to give you a royal screwing.

657
02:29:57,163 --> 02:29:59,154
I go get help.

658
02:33:58,655 --> 02:34:01,215
Johnny!

659
02:34:48,997 --> 02:34:51,306
<i>What about me?</i>
