1
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:30,125
You? You again? Get out!

2
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:35,882
Go on, I told you. Get out!

3
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:45,559
Go on! Go on!

4
00:03:54,007 --> 00:03:55,406
Papa!

5
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:01,680
You filthy dog! You settle with me!

6
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,243
Papa!

7
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:07,765
Ah..

8
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:25,358
Let's go.

9
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:21,359
Welcome to you, señor.
My name is Juan de Dios.

10
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:24,598
I am the bell-ringer. Why are you here?

11
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:28,202
To see the Rojos? No, not the Rojos.

12
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:32,405
Is it the Baxters? No, maybe not even
the Baxters. You want to get rich?

13
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:36,321
Well, for that you have come to
the right place, if you use your head.

14
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:40,161
That's because everybody here
has become very rich,

15
00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:45,640
or else they are dead. What do you want
to buy? Some guns? Liquor?

16
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:48,685
You don't buy, you sell.
Lead in exchange for gold?

17
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:54,080
You will get rich here. Or you'll be killed.
Juan de Dios tolls the bell once again.

18
00:07:10,007 --> 00:07:15,365
Saludos, amigo. It's not smart
to go wandering so far from home.

19
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:21,445
- I reckon he picked the wrong trail.
- He could have picked the wrong town.

20
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:24,166
His big mistake, I
think, was getting born.

21
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:29,958
If you want any work, lookin' like that,
you could try bein' a scarecrow.

22
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,437
Oh, no! The crows are liable
to scare him, maybe.

23
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:52,879
Hello.

24
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,286
Saludos.

25
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:08,325
You can't get rich like that. At most,
you will only succeed in being killed.

26
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:15,040
With all the trouble, all we needed
was you. What are you looking for?

27
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,322
Food, somethin' to drink.

28
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,717
- Water's over there.
- No. No water.

29
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:26,086
Eating and drinking and killing. That's all
you can do, just like the rest of your kind.

30
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:30,160
By the way, you'll have to mark this up.

31
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:32,477
I know, you have no money.

32
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:36,799
After all, you just got into town.
If you don't mind doing a little killing,

33
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:41,677
you will have no trouble
finding someone eager to pay you.

34
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:46,435
Hm-mm.

35
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:50,566
My roulette wheel.
That, too, was murdered.

36
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:55,437
No one comes here to play. We spend our
time here between funerals and burials.

37
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:58,678
Yeah. Never saw a town
as dead as this one.

38
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,483
You will never see another like it.

39
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:08,355
- What's wrong with the place?
- We've had too many killings.

40
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:12,076
You have seen the women?
None of them are women, they're widows.

41
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:16,445
The place has only widows. Here, you can
only gain respect by killing other men.

42
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:19,121
So nobody works any more.

43
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:23,321
Seems somebody doesn't
share your opinion.

44
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:25,398
Mm-hm. Yes.

45
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:31,244
¡Saludos!

46
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:38,125
You know why Piripero looked you over?
To take your measurements.

47
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:42,644
He is so experienced he can do it
with a glance. You will be a customer.

48
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:45,082
- Hm.
- Don't laugh. I'm not joking.

49
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,876
I wanna warn you those murderers
will make a corpse out of you one day.

50
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,527
That's why I want you to get out of here.

51
00:09:51,607 --> 00:09:54,519
You don't want to stay in this cemetery,

52
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:57,201
Finish up and get out.

53
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,243
I told ya I can't pay ya.

54
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:03,397
Be my guest.

55
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:06,320
But get out of San Miguel, will you?

56
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,764
- Where does that lead?
- The balcony.

57
00:10:14,087 --> 00:10:17,796
- Why are you going there? Hey!
- Uh..

58
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:21,277
To have a look. Things always
look different from higher up.

59
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:25,155
But nothing's up there.
Go ahead and get out.

60
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:36,643
- Who are they?
- Hm. Bandits.

61
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:38,763
Bandits and smugglers.

62
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:43,637
They come down from Texas, cross the
frontier to stock up on guns and liquor.

63
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:49,597
The cost is less here. Then they go back and
sell the guns and liquor to the lndians.

64
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,206
Any town that sells guns
and liquor gotta be rich.

65
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:56,324
Not the town.
Only those who buy and sell.

66
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,921
The bosses are the ones who clean up.

67
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:02,283
Yeah, somebody has to run the place.
Every town has a boss.

68
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:07,236
That's true, but when there are two,
then I'd say that there is one too many.

69
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:11,366
Two bosses? Very interesting.

70
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:16,157
Interesting is right. The Rojos boys,
three brothers who sell liquor.

71
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:19,842
And then there's the Baxters,
big gun merchants.

72
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:25,199
Ah, if I'm not mistaken, you already
met Baxter's gang, didn't you?

73
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:28,438
- Yeah, we met.
- But you're lucky.

74
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:31,087
They don't usually limit
their fire to the mule.

75
00:11:31,167 --> 00:11:34,000
A man leaves his land
and looks around for any reason,

76
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:37,875
Juan de Dios tolls the bell,
Piripero sells another coffin.

77
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,958
Two bosses.

78
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:46,085
They've enlisted all the scum that hangs
around both sides of the frontier.

79
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:48,920
And they pay in dollars.

80
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,600
Baxters over there.

81
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:56,281
Rojos there.

82
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:59,359
- Me right in the middle.
- Where you do what?

83
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:03,197
Crazy bell-ringer was right.

84
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,755
There's money to be made
in a place like this.

85
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:10,079
If you're thinking what I suspect..
l tell you, don't try it.

86
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:16,525
- Which one of the two is the stronger?
- Which one of them is stronger?

87
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:19,679
Well, the Rojos, especially Ramón.

88
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:34,396
Don Miguel Rojo, I wanna talk to you.

89
00:12:35,407 --> 00:12:38,444
Don Miguel, I hear you're hirin' on men.

90
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:42,598
Well, I might just be available.

91
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:46,439
I gotta tell you before you hire me..

92
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,281
I don't work cheap.

93
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:08,765
- Get three coffins ready.
- Huh?

94
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:36,600
- Adios, amigo.
- Listen, stranger, didn't you get the idea?

95
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:40,760
We don't like to see bad boys
like you in town. Go get your mule.

96
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:44,044
You let him get away from you?

97
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:46,721
See, that's what I wanna talk about.

98
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:49,879
- He's feelin' real bad.
- Huh?

99
00:13:49,967 --> 00:13:54,916
My mule. You see, he got all riled up
when you fired those shots at his feet.

100
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:58,680
Hey.

101
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:02,646
- Are you makin' some kinda joke?
- Oh, no. No.

102
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:07,721
I understand you were just playin' around.
But the mule, he just doesn't get it.

103
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:11,163
Of course, if you were to all apologise..

104
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,844
I don't think it's nice, you laughin'.

105
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:31,156
See, my mule don't like people laughin'.

106
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:34,239
He gets the crazy idea
you're laughin' at him.

107
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:38,002
Now, if you apologise,
like I know you're going to,

108
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:41,443
I might convince him
that you really didn't mean it.

109
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:11,603
I saw the whole thing.
You killed all four of them.

110
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:15,605
You'll pay, all right.
You'll be strung up.

111
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:20,125
- Who are you?
- Don't fire a shot.

112
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:25,483
I'm John Baxter. Sheriff.

113
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:32,683
Yeah. Well, if you're the sheriff,
you better get these men underground.

114
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:46,846
My mistake. Four coffins.

115
00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,444
Hey!

116
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:09,086
I told you I wasn't cheap, but I think
you'll find it's worth your while.

117
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,840
98, 99, 100.

118
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:14,316
The rest when you're all done.

119
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,841
When do I start?

120
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:19,600
I'm not in a hurry, at
least for the moment.

121
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:23,680
I'd say with four less Baxters, right
now is as good a time to start as any.

122
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:27,601
In a few days there will be
a troop of cavalry passing through,

123
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:32,886
and I wouldn't want the military sticking
their long noses into our business.

124
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:35,686
You seem to be well-informed.

125
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:41,556
In these parts, a man's life often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

126
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:42,636
Hm.

127
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:46,800
This thing couldn't have been
very useful to its owner.

128
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:51,965
My brother Ramón did that.
He often uses it for target practice.

129
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:55,881
With a gun in his hand,
no one stands in his way.

130
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:58,435
The armour is one of
his favourite targets,

131
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:02,236
naturally, when he does not have
anything better to shoot.

132
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:07,082
Well, I'll be kinda curious
to meet this brother of yours.

133
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:08,646
Ah.

134
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,402
This is Chico,
one of the most trusted of my men.

135
00:17:12,487 --> 00:17:15,445
Follow him.
He will bring you to your room.

136
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:17,961
I would like you to feel at home.

137
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:22,359
Well, I never found home that great,
but let's go.

138
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:41,879
- Who's that?
- Her name is Marisol.

139
00:17:41,967 --> 00:17:44,720
You just forget about her.

140
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,206
This one will be your room.

141
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:23,877
You gave him $100. We've never
paid out as much as that before.

142
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:26,083
Can you explain why
you have taken him on?

143
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:29,876
To have a filthy gringo around,
and to give him $100 besides?

144
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:33,801
- We have never paid anybody so much.
- You cannot leave someone like that

145
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:39,917
to do what he wants here. He is capable
of anything, and I want law and order.

146
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:44,364
If that is all you want,
there is a much cheaper way.

147
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,915
Just snuff him out.

148
00:18:48,487 --> 00:18:51,559
- And who will be the one? You?
- Yes. Why not?

149
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:58,039
A shot in his back and then you would
have him out of the way in no time at all.

150
00:18:58,127 --> 00:19:01,756
Listen, I could do it easily right now.

151
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:05,601
He won't be expecting it,
and I'd get back the hundred.

152
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:12,880
You are stupid, Esteban.
Even if you are my brother.

153
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:16,084
A bullet in the back and it is ended.

154
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:20,285
What happens if your hand should tremble
slightly and he's only been hurt?

155
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:24,883
With the cavalry arriving in town,
and that Yankee so quick on the draw..

156
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:27,765
- But I was only thinking..
- You mustn't think!

157
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:29,838
You let me do the thinking instead.

158
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:35,923
Go and see the americano. Just ask him
if he needs anything and make friends.

159
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:42,401
Get one thing clear. This is going to be
a quiet town until Ramón gets back.

160
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:45,559
Is that clear? A quiet town.

161
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:01,765
I am Esteban Rojo.
My brother asked me to..

162
00:20:06,487 --> 00:20:08,921
What are you doing?

163
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,077
Moving.

164
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:14,443
But didn't you know
all our men live here with us?

165
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:21,276
That's all very cosy, but, uh,
I don't find you men all that appealin'.

166
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:27,237
Besides, your brother said he didn't
have any need for me any more right now.

167
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:49,878
Halt!

168
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:53,807
- Sergeant.
- Yes, Capitán?

169
00:20:54,607 --> 00:20:57,041
Tell the men we'll be
spending tonight here.

170
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:59,243
Arrange so they can pick up the supplies.

171
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:01,761
Double the guard
to watch the stagecoach.

172
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:03,565
Yes, sir.

173
00:21:04,207 --> 00:21:06,767
What do you suppose they're carrying?

174
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:11,045
It would be easy to find out. Get up
close and take a look at what's in it.

175
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:14,164
If they fire at you, you know it's gold.

176
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:16,283
Not a bad idea.

177
00:21:29,007 --> 00:21:30,122
Hm.

178
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:43,397
Looking for anything?

179
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,600
Hello.

180
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:48,520
Get out of here, Yankee. Vamoose.

181
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:03,521
Why aren't you sleeping?

182
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:07,077
When I see you staring like that,
it bothers me.

183
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:10,204
I still keep wondering
what was in that stagecoach.

184
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,245
It's something they seem
to think is very important.

185
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:17,525
I asked a few questions of the captain
and almost was arrested.

186
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:20,438
Who's Marisol?

187
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:24,599
You'd better get some sleep. You need it.

188
00:22:24,687 --> 00:22:27,406
It's much too dangerous, even for you.

189
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:32,157
All I did is ask who she was.

190
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:36,365
She is a woman.
Ramón's madly in love with her.

191
00:22:36,447 --> 00:22:38,881
Does that make it clear to you?

192
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:40,923
Mm.

193
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:44,079
Everybody in this town
talks about Ramón.

194
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:46,237
I'm curious to meet him.

195
00:22:46,327 --> 00:22:52,118
If you're smart, you'll try to stay
clear of Ramón as long as possible.

196
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:56,721
Ah!

197
00:22:56,807 --> 00:23:00,766
There are the soldiers.
They're moving on very quietly.

198
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:08,916
Strange. They're headed for the frontier.

199
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:15,798
Tell me..

200
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:20,644
is that the way you go to bed every night?

201
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:23,844
Don't worry. I didn't dirty the sheets.

202
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:27,037
Oh, no, wait. I'm coming, too.

203
00:23:27,127 --> 00:23:30,517
I want to see for myself
how you're going to get in trouble.

204
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:33,201
All right, all right. Go ahead.

205
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,845
It's like playing cowboys and lndians.

206
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,282
- Captain.
- Welcome, Lieutenant.

207
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:27,562
There is your gold as promised.

208
00:24:27,647 --> 00:24:31,037
I hope the guns you will be
giving us will be equally useful.

209
00:24:31,127 --> 00:24:35,120
Rest assured, Captain.
We'll check 'em over together.

210
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:07,319
Get their clothes on again, and hurry.

211
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:12,442
Be sure to place them right.
They died fighting among themselves.

212
00:26:30,407 --> 00:26:32,284
Rubio!

213
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:39,003
There. It's Ramón.

214
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:55,041
This is my brother Ramón.

215
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:58,836
- I think I mentioned him.
- Everybody talks about Ramón.

216
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:03,079
And many speak of you, too.
My dear brother included.

217
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:06,443
Well, I hope they say.. nice things.

218
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,877
Did you have a good trip?

219
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:14,722
It was tiring. It was terribly hot
on the road during the day.

220
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:18,800
And stagecoaches are
an uncomfortable way to travel.

221
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,084
Well, I'm sure you'll be
in great shape in no time.

222
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:25,523
The americano cannot wait
to get into action.

223
00:27:25,607 --> 00:27:30,078
- I'm sorry. He's going to be disappointed.
- How's that?

224
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:34,638
The Baxters accepted the invitation.
They'll come tonight, Don Miguel.

225
00:27:34,727 --> 00:27:36,843
You must be out of your head.

226
00:27:36,927 --> 00:27:39,839
Chico followed my orders.
I told him to invite them.

227
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:42,316
Ramón, what is this?

228
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:47,326
I found out many things when I was
travelling and I have decided that..

229
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:53,039
it's very stupid to just keep on shooting
at each other, and without any results.

230
00:27:53,127 --> 00:27:55,322
You've gone out of your mind, Ramón.

231
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,524
No, I've come to my senses, Esteban.

232
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:00,598
Believe me.

233
00:28:00,687 --> 00:28:02,962
Trust me.

234
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:05,163
Life can be so precious.

235
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:08,762
It's foolish to risk losing it
every minute, no?

236
00:28:09,927 --> 00:28:15,479
There's plenty of space for everybody
in this town. Even Baxters, hm?

237
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:17,797
For this reason..

238
00:28:18,807 --> 00:28:21,765
I've decided to hang my gun
up on the wall.

239
00:28:22,287 --> 00:28:24,357
I think that Ramón has the right idea.

240
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:28,884
L, too, am getting tired of these killings.
They must stop.

241
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:34,246
- This is all.. very, very touching.
- You mean you don't admire peace?

242
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:38,206
It's not really easy to like something
you know nothing about.

243
00:28:38,807 --> 00:28:42,117
Stay in San Miguel
and you may profit from the experience.

244
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:45,324
No, thanks. I'll be movin' on.

245
00:28:51,447 --> 00:28:55,998
Oh, here's your money, Don Miguel.
I only used a small amount of it.

246
00:28:56,087 --> 00:29:01,366
I don't like to take money
unless I feel I've earned it.

247
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:04,439
Now, why are you so hasty?
You should stay here.

248
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:07,041
You might enjoy dining with us tonight.

249
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:10,722
You see, the Baxters have four men
in the cemetery on account of me.

250
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:14,197
I don't think
they'd appreciate my presence.

251
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,323
I don't like that americano.
Too smart to be a hired fighter.

252
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:28,559
- Shooting a pistol, no one can touch him.
- I see that. When someone with that face

253
00:29:28,647 --> 00:29:30,763
works with his gun, count on two things.

254
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:33,680
He's fast on the trigger
but he's also intelligent.

255
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:38,841
- That makes him too dangerous for you.
- Now he's gone, explain that nonsense

256
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:42,442
about hanging up your gun
and making up with the Baxters.

257
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:47,999
Is it possible that you'll never be able
to reach any conclusions on your own?

258
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:53,320
Don't you think our government and
the americanos will find those bodies?

259
00:29:53,407 --> 00:29:59,004
They'll investigate, all right. And we'll
be quiet and peacefully bide our time.

260
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:02,523
We know nothing about a massacre
at the Rio Bravo, eh?

261
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:08,000
I arranged for the bodies to be lying
as if both companies killed each other.

262
00:30:08,087 --> 00:30:10,555
But do you think they'll believe it?

263
00:30:10,647 --> 00:30:15,084
Ah, yes, I think so. Because if
they don't find some guilty party,

264
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:18,318
it would be a good reason
to call off the investigation.

265
00:30:18,407 --> 00:30:21,001
Yes, but.. what about the Baxters?

266
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:26,559
The Baxters? They want nothing
more than to live in peace.

267
00:30:26,647 --> 00:30:30,322
We'll let them have their own way
for a while. So forget the Baxters.

268
00:30:30,407 --> 00:30:34,798
We'll take care of them later
when the investigation finishes.

269
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:45,123
That was a fine idea that you had.
What was it again?

270
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:47,641
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

271
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:52,084
The Baxters on one side,
the Rojos on the other.

272
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:56,441
And you'd be in the middle.

273
00:30:56,527 --> 00:30:59,519
The only problem is
that they've joined up.

274
00:31:01,487 --> 00:31:05,526
Now you're without a job and you don't
have money to pay me what you owe me.

275
00:31:05,607 --> 00:31:08,917
There is only one thing for you to do.
Leave immediately.

276
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:10,998
I will forget about what you owe me.

277
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:14,716
You leave San Miguel and never come
back for the rest of your days.

278
00:31:14,807 --> 00:31:18,436
Hey, Joe! I prepared the wagon
the way you asked me to.

279
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:21,599
We're sitting in the back here
with two empty coffins.

280
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:23,757
Hey, what are you up to?

281
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:26,122
Are you changing your profession?

282
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:28,596
If you want to go on living, you'd better.

283
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:32,157
In my opinion,
you will make a fine pallbearer.

284
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:38,796
- Close this place and come with me.
- Oh, close up, huh? It's done.

285
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:44,280
Where are we going? I'd like to know
where we are going. Or is it a secret?

286
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:48,645
Down by the river, to have a look
at some corpses down there.

287
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:35,606
The Rojos say, "Come to dinner" and
we must go, but I don't like it at all,

288
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:40,283
even if they've granted
all the guarantees we've demanded.

289
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:43,996
We'll go along with it,
but don't touch anything.

290
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,477
You mustn't eat. You mustn't drink.

291
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:51,640
You just keep your eyes open
and keep your wits about you.

292
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:16,237
Whoa.

293
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,682
Are you sure that nobody has seen us?

294
00:33:18,767 --> 00:33:20,803
Only a ghost or two.

295
00:33:20,887 --> 00:33:23,685
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't joke about things like this.

296
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:26,327
Ghosts are better left where they are.

297
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:30,200
You look as though
this place suits you very well.

298
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:33,643
And if you go on like this,
you will soon be here permanently.

299
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:50,597
I do not understand why, with all those
bodies, we are just burying these two?

300
00:33:50,687 --> 00:33:52,837
We're not.. gonna bury 'em.

301
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:55,122
What? We are not burying them?

302
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:57,960
That's right, we're not gonna bury 'em.

303
00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:03,519
If we are not going to bury them, I would
like to know what we will use them for.

304
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:06,883
Why are we taking the trouble to do this?

305
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:09,959
The dead can be very useful sometimes.

306
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:16,282
They've helped me out
of tough spots more than once.

307
00:34:21,647 --> 00:34:24,036
First, they don't talk.

308
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:28,758
Second, they can be made
to look alive if I manage it right.

309
00:34:28,847 --> 00:34:30,280
Yeah.

310
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:33,437
And third..

311
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:39,885
Well, if you shoot 'em, there's no worry
cos they're dead already. Understand?

312
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:43,077
It doesn't make sense. I'm getting out.

313
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:47,080
I want to remain with the living.
When I'm dead, I'll remain with the dead

314
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:52,764
and I would be unhappy if somebody living
forces me to remain with the living.

315
00:34:52,847 --> 00:34:56,237
I don't like the idea that
you've placed those bodies there.

316
00:34:56,327 --> 00:35:00,559
The man in that grave is the only one
who ever died of pneumonia in this town.

317
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:04,959
Take it easy, will ya? These friends of
ours are gonna help me pay your bill.

318
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:07,959
Ah, giddap, there!

319
00:35:34,247 --> 00:35:36,681
The only reason
they could have to start a war

320
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,998
would be to kidnap you
from your husband's side.

321
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:45,717
He is gallant, this Rojo. I really didn't
think him capable of compliments.

322
00:35:45,807 --> 00:35:49,720
And he's not. All that he says is false,
like his proposals.

323
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:55,245
Huh! You women. If things aren't
complicated, you become suspicious.

324
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:58,922
Yes. Because to me
it just didn't seem right.

325
00:35:59,007 --> 00:36:02,363
It went too smoothly. I don't trust them.

326
00:36:02,447 --> 00:36:07,123
You'd like to prove me wrong,
wouldn't you? Always the same thing.

327
00:36:08,727 --> 00:36:11,321
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

328
00:36:47,807 --> 00:36:50,799
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt ya.

329
00:36:50,887 --> 00:36:56,086
I just want ya to know why the Rojos
wanna make peace all of a sudden.

330
00:36:56,167 --> 00:37:00,604
There was once a wagonload of gold
the soldiers were takin' to the border.

331
00:37:08,447 --> 00:37:11,359
John! Come up here quickly.

332
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:21,563
Sorry. When a husband finds
a man in his wife's bedroom,

333
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:24,605
you're never sure how he's gonna react.

334
00:37:26,927 --> 00:37:29,202
- Give him $500.
- How's that?

335
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:34,156
Give the money to him. He has an
interesting story. Listen to him.

336
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:38,962
- That's the right idea?
- I get the wrong idea when it suits me.

337
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:40,366
- Ramón!
- What?

338
00:37:40,447 --> 00:37:43,120
- The soldiers escorting the gold..
- Two got away.

339
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:48,759
They're hiding out in the cemetery. The
Baxters, they're about to capture them.

340
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:50,883
Hey! Rubio!

341
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:52,958
Get the men.

342
00:37:54,527 --> 00:37:56,518
You are well-informed.

343
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,520
A man's life in these parts often depends
on a scrap of information.

344
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:02,677
Your brother's own words.

345
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:05,804
Tell me, why are you doing this for us?

346
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:10,444
$500.

347
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:20,040
With these soldiers
as witnesses against Ramón,

348
00:38:20,127 --> 00:38:23,676
the government will rid the town
of the Rojos and their band.

349
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:26,235
Then San Miguel will have just one boss.

350
00:38:26,327 --> 00:38:28,124
Hurry!

351
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:44,238
Let's go!

352
00:38:46,927 --> 00:38:49,964
- Coming with us?
- No. When a man's got money

353
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:53,164
he begins to appreciate peace.

354
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,238
Come on!

355
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:00,916
Whoa!

356
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:03,475
Let's leave the horses here.

357
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,838
¡Por Dios!

358
00:40:24,727 --> 00:40:27,116
Who is there? Come out!

359
00:40:47,687 --> 00:40:51,396
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

360
00:40:51,487 --> 00:40:53,682
There's somethin' about it I don't like.

361
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:56,645
Too still to be wounded,
more like dummies.

362
00:40:56,727 --> 00:41:01,721
Sure. Dummies that are very interesting
to the Rojos. Better hide. Hurry.

363
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:13,484
- What do we do?
- Take two men. Circle around to the side.

364
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:19,437
Try to keep them busy long enough
for me to get those two. Go on. Quickly.

365
00:43:54,807 --> 00:43:58,482
Keep me covered.
I'm going to take care of those two.

366
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:37,320
Listen, Baxter.
You can have them now if you like,

367
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:40,205
since dead men can't talk.

368
00:44:50,927 --> 00:44:53,680
It seems they didn't like my joke.

369
00:44:53,767 --> 00:44:56,565
We'll let them go home in a little while.

370
00:46:36,447 --> 00:46:40,759
Keep this bad boy as our guest
only until Baxter leaves for the frontier.

371
00:46:40,847 --> 00:46:43,680
Put him in the cellar.

372
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:50,522
Ah, Esteban, good work.

373
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:54,520
With Antonio as our prisoner,
the Baxters are going to have to give in.

374
00:46:54,607 --> 00:46:59,283
- Now we can make any kind of demand.
- Don Miguel! Don Miguel!

375
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:05,961
What has happened? Talk, will you?

376
00:47:06,047 --> 00:47:08,515
I don't know who,
but somebody shot at me.

377
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:10,598
Marisol!

378
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:13,159
Marisol!

379
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,636
Where are you, Marisol?!

380
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:34,037
Strange.. how you always manage to be
in the right place at the right time.

381
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:44,318
It's nothing serious,
a headache that will pass. She'll sleep.

382
00:47:48,687 --> 00:47:53,761
Keep your eyes open. She's not
to move from that room. You hear?

383
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:02,204
I wouldn't mention anything
about me bringing her here.

384
00:48:02,287 --> 00:48:05,484
I wouldn't want the Rojos
to think I was on your side.

385
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:08,320
Don't be worried.
I'm a woman who's rich enough

386
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:12,366
to appreciate the men
that my money can buy.

387
00:48:12,447 --> 00:48:15,962
I've been to the Rojos.
They'll give back Antonio for Marisol.

388
00:48:16,047 --> 00:48:18,641
It'll take place in the morning.

389
00:48:20,807 --> 00:48:23,719
Very soon, you're going to be rich.

390
00:48:24,607 --> 00:48:26,404
Uh-huh.

391
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:31,886
Yeah, and that's not gonna
break my heart.

392
00:50:11,647 --> 00:50:16,198
Where is she? You said
I'd be able to see her. Where is she?

393
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:21,519
- I want to see her.
- Come back here, Jesus.

394
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:23,962
I want to see her. I want to see her.

395
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:28,677
Why can't I look at her?
I want to see her!

396
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:48,361
Go. Go to him, Marisol.

397
00:51:12,087 --> 00:51:13,918
Mama!

398
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:18,642
- Mama!
- Jesus!

399
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:27,558
Mama!

400
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,206
- Jesus!
- Mama! Mama!

401
00:51:37,247 --> 00:51:38,919
Mama!

402
00:52:20,447 --> 00:52:22,438
Julio.

403
00:52:22,527 --> 00:52:24,438
Marisol.

404
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,718
Get Julio.

405
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:41,683
You were warned to get outta town.
Now I'm gonna make you pay,

406
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:44,156
- once and for all.
- No!

407
00:52:45,007 --> 00:52:46,998
Let him be.

408
00:53:23,927 --> 00:53:27,317
You better get goin'. Ramón's waitin'.

409
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:33,955
And you, get that kid home
where he belongs.

410
00:54:18,727 --> 00:54:21,560
A pig, that Ramón.

411
00:54:21,647 --> 00:54:24,241
Tell me, what's Ramón
got to do with them?

412
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:26,522
You weren't told, eh?

413
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:33,516
In this part of the world, the story is old.
A happy family until trouble comes along.

414
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:36,997
Trouble has the name Ramón.
Claiming the husband cheated at cards,

415
00:54:37,087 --> 00:54:41,638
which wasn't true, he gets the wife
to live with him as hostage.

416
00:54:41,727 --> 00:54:46,323
- And the husband?
- Oh, him? There's nothing for him to do.

417
00:54:46,407 --> 00:54:52,403
The Rojos threatened to kill his little boy
Jesus, and he was forced to accept things.

418
00:54:53,607 --> 00:54:55,996
That Ramón is smart.

419
00:54:57,487 --> 00:55:00,240
Where are you going?

420
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:05,361
To the Rojos, to look for a job.

421
00:55:11,047 --> 00:55:13,242
I'm glad we have the americano with us.

422
00:55:13,327 --> 00:55:16,080
It's the best thing
that could have happened to us

423
00:55:16,167 --> 00:55:22,276
cos if either government starts an
enquiry, we'll need every man we can get.

424
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:27,316
To be at war with the Baxters now is
worse than sitting on a case of dynamite.

425
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,683
- Where should we put this?
- Put it over there.

426
00:55:38,087 --> 00:55:40,442
Come on, everybody. Drink up.

427
00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:14,163
- Good shooting. Very good.
- When you want to kill a man,

428
00:56:14,247 --> 00:56:18,160
you must shoot for his heart,
and a Winchester is the best weapon.

429
00:56:18,247 --> 00:56:21,796
That's very nice,
but I'll stick with my .45.

430
00:56:21,887 --> 00:56:25,004
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

431
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:28,716
the man with the pistol
will be a dead man.

432
00:56:28,807 --> 00:56:33,005
That's an old Mexican proverb,
and it's true.

433
00:56:33,087 --> 00:56:35,078
You believe that?

434
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:42,243
Paquito, take five men. Escort Marisol to
the small house. Stay there until I return.

435
00:56:50,167 --> 00:56:53,284
- Everything is prepared.
- Do not be worried.

436
00:56:53,367 --> 00:56:56,882
- I will return tomorrow.
- All the wagons are ready. We can leave.

437
00:56:56,967 --> 00:57:00,926
Everyone! Enjoy yourselves
during my absence!

438
00:57:17,847 --> 00:57:20,964
You heard Ramón. Let's have a good time.

439
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:31,763
? Do you remember
sweet Betsy from Pike?

440
00:57:31,847 --> 00:57:35,806
? She roamed the world with her lover lke

441
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:37,957
? Ike, Betsy

442
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,038
? Betsy from Pike

443
00:57:43,087 --> 00:57:47,877
- He weighs over a ton.
- Of course, with all he poured in himself.

444
00:59:01,487 --> 00:59:03,717
Papa,

445
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:07,163
did you not tell me
no one could go see Mama?

446
00:59:08,167 --> 00:59:11,239
- That's right.
- Then why does that man see her

447
00:59:11,327 --> 00:59:13,557
when I cannot?

448
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:19,920
- I want Mama. I want Mama.
- Come away from the door. Sh. Quiet.

449
00:59:20,007 --> 00:59:24,125
Quiet. We cannot show ourselves. You
must remember that. You must stay away.

450
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,324
Hello.

451
00:59:55,207 --> 01:00:01,203
- Somebody shooting at the small house.
- Saddle the horses immediately. Let's go.

452
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:29,678
Look out!

453
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:18,082
Here you are. Take this money.
It's enough to live on for a while.

454
01:01:18,167 --> 01:01:22,843
Get across the border. As much distance
between you and San Miguel as possible.

455
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:25,760
How may we thank you
for what you are doing?

456
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:29,601
Don't try. Just get goin'
before the Rojos get here.

457
01:01:32,927 --> 01:01:35,885
Why do you do this for us?

458
01:01:35,967 --> 01:01:40,199
Why? I knew someone like you once.
There was no one there to help.

459
01:01:40,287 --> 01:01:42,642
Now get movin'.

460
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,283
Get movin'.

461
01:01:46,967 --> 01:01:48,958
Get outta here!

462
01:02:29,327 --> 01:02:31,557
What do you see, Chico?

463
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:36,437
- They're all dead. Massacred.
- They kidnapped Marisol.

464
01:02:36,527 --> 01:02:38,518
The work of the Baxters.

465
01:02:38,607 --> 01:02:42,919
Quick. Let's get back before
they attack our house in the town.

466
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:34,806
Chico, give out the ammunition.

467
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:38,596
Esteban, spread your men
around the house. Keep your eyes open.

468
01:04:38,687 --> 01:04:43,886
Miguel, Paco, Vincente, Martin, behind the
house. Manolo and Alvaro, come with me.

469
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:49,121
Stay alert. The way they killed the men
in the small house, there must be a lot.

470
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:59,036
It's a warm evening.

471
01:05:01,927 --> 01:05:06,364
One of our wagons lost a wheel
so we had to turn back here to get help.

472
01:05:07,927 --> 01:05:14,002
One of the men tells me..
the Baxters attacked the small house.

473
01:05:15,247 --> 01:05:17,636
Do you know about it?

474
01:05:20,367 --> 01:05:22,676
Tell me what you know.

475
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,279
Well?

476
01:05:44,087 --> 01:05:46,726
Where did you hide Marisol?

477
01:05:48,567 --> 01:05:50,364
Rubio.

478
01:06:14,487 --> 01:06:17,365
You are thirsty? You want to drink?

479
01:06:17,447 --> 01:06:20,598
No, no. It is too soon to drink.

480
01:06:20,687 --> 01:06:22,006
Ooh!

481
01:06:24,087 --> 01:06:26,476
Bring him over here.

482
01:06:53,447 --> 01:06:57,679
You are a stubborn idiot. Tell us
where Marisol is and it'll all be ended.

483
01:06:57,767 --> 01:07:02,397
In a week, you'll be back in shape,
and you can go wherever you want.

484
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:14,957
That's enough for today.

485
01:07:15,047 --> 01:07:19,006
Sooner or later he'll talk.
It's just a matter of time.

486
01:07:19,087 --> 01:07:23,717
Watch out he doesn't escape or die.
Otherwise, do as you like.

487
01:07:26,087 --> 01:07:30,638
But wait till he comes to.
This way he hardly feels anything.

488
01:08:00,967 --> 01:08:03,276
I have a poker hand waiting for me.

489
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:06,484
Now I am stuck here
guarding this americano idiot.

490
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:11,004
I think you will find this more amusing.
All orders are to be sure he does not die,

491
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,602
and also make sure
he regrets the day he was born.

492
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:21,161
The gringo is asleep, I imagine. That's all right.
I'll enjoy waking him up.

493
01:09:22,727 --> 01:09:26,003
- Esteban, what was that noise?
- I do not know.

494
01:09:26,087 --> 01:09:28,362
I heard a yell and then a crash.

495
01:09:58,887 --> 01:10:01,276
It's useless to hide.

496
01:10:02,927 --> 01:10:06,522
You are finished playing the smart boy.

497
01:10:06,607 --> 01:10:09,599
Go up and look in the loft.

498
01:10:09,687 --> 01:10:12,485
And take a look behind the barrels.

499
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:25,795
Let's get out of here.

500
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:38,606
- Hurry! Hurry! Hurry with that water!
- Come on!

501
01:10:38,687 --> 01:10:41,076
Hey, you! Come along with me!

502
01:10:54,327 --> 01:10:58,081
Surround the town!
Block all the streets leading out!

503
01:10:58,167 --> 01:11:01,000
Find him for me!

504
01:11:01,087 --> 01:11:04,875
- Esteban, search the whole town.
- Follow me.

505
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:08,883
Get him back right now!
You've got to at any cost!

506
01:11:08,967 --> 01:11:12,482
Look in the stables,
in every corral, in the store!

507
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:16,924
Look for him in the church!
Go in there! Search every inch of it!

508
01:11:17,007 --> 01:11:20,636
Search everywhere! Rubio, in here!

509
01:11:21,167 --> 01:11:25,957
If somebody is hiding him, burn their
house down and kill them like dogs.

510
01:11:26,047 --> 01:11:29,881
You, come here. Look for him near
the Baxters', but take him alive.

511
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:33,004
I want him alive. Alive!

512
01:11:34,847 --> 01:11:36,166
Rubio.

513
01:11:36,247 --> 01:11:38,681
In the bar.

514
01:12:06,327 --> 01:12:09,524
He says he knows nothing.
Trying to be smart.

515
01:12:09,607 --> 01:12:11,996
Bring him here to me.

516
01:12:15,487 --> 01:12:20,322
- Well.. you know nothing, huh?
- No. I have not seen him.

517
01:12:20,407 --> 01:12:22,841
Rubio, you take care of him.

518
01:13:02,567 --> 01:13:05,718
Where have you hidden him?

519
01:13:05,807 --> 01:13:08,321
L.. didn't.. hide..

520
01:13:12,567 --> 01:13:15,957
You are the right friend
for that filthy americano.

521
01:13:16,047 --> 01:13:18,720
You'll end up the same way.

522
01:13:18,807 --> 01:13:23,358
We looked everywhere.
In the cellar, in the attic, on the roof.

523
01:13:23,447 --> 01:13:27,486
- But there is no trace. - I couldn't
find anybody in the back room.

524
01:13:27,567 --> 01:13:32,118
I'm certain he has taken refuge with
the Baxters. The americano isn't stupid.

525
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:35,643
He knows that that's
the best place for him to hide.

526
01:13:37,087 --> 01:13:39,920
The Baxters, eh?

527
01:13:40,007 --> 01:13:42,396
Then better go and get him.

528
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:48,316
And that's for being his friend.

529
01:14:20,927 --> 01:14:22,918
Curse them.

530
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:31,120
- Piripero.
- ¿ Si?

531
01:14:38,007 --> 01:14:40,316
- Piripero.
- Hm?

532
01:14:50,367 --> 01:14:54,076
- Come here.
- I can't see anybody.

533
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:56,761
- Come here.
- ¡Dios m¡o!

534
01:15:04,407 --> 01:15:07,558
What are you doing in there?

535
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:10,002
Never mind. Get me outta here.

536
01:15:10,087 --> 01:15:12,203
But you're not dead yet.

537
01:15:12,287 --> 01:15:17,520
I will be, if you don't get me
outta here quick. Get the lid down.

538
01:16:39,767 --> 01:16:41,917
Rubio.

539
01:17:01,807 --> 01:17:04,560
I see some signs of life.

540
01:17:04,647 --> 01:17:08,276
Let's be ready
when they decide to come out.

541
01:17:11,247 --> 01:17:14,717
Don't shoot! We surrender! Don't shoot!

542
01:17:16,007 --> 01:17:19,795
Stop! Don't shoot! We're coming out!

543
01:17:22,407 --> 01:17:24,716
We're surrendering! Hold back your fire!

544
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:27,401
Don't shoot! We're surrendering!

545
01:17:55,567 --> 01:17:59,162
Stop. I wanna take a look at this.

546
01:19:31,807 --> 01:19:35,846
Ramón! Don't shoot.
We're comin' out.

547
01:19:39,047 --> 01:19:42,244
We surrender. Listen, you've won.

548
01:19:42,327 --> 01:19:45,876
It's enough. I'll get outta town.
I'll do whatever you like.

549
01:19:45,967 --> 01:19:49,084
- You promise that?
- I swear it, Ramón!

550
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:52,398
- You won't try a trick of any kind?
- None.

551
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:56,162
No, no tricks. I said before,
I give you my word, we'll leave.

552
01:19:56,247 --> 01:20:00,126
Are you sure? You had better
ask permission of your wife.

553
01:20:01,527 --> 01:20:04,200
Maybe she won't be too happy.

554
01:20:16,207 --> 01:20:18,562
Antonio!

555
01:20:19,167 --> 01:20:20,839
John!

556
01:20:43,967 --> 01:20:45,764
Murderers.

557
01:20:47,127 --> 01:20:49,516
They had no guns!

558
01:20:49,607 --> 01:20:52,405
Murderers! I hope you rot in hell!

559
01:20:52,487 --> 01:20:56,765
May you and your brothers die
spitting blood! Curse you for this!

560
01:20:56,847 --> 01:20:58,917
Murderers!

561
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:22,846
Let's go. The show's over anyway.

562
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:30,556
Keep looking for him.
Search among those bodies.

563
01:21:30,647 --> 01:21:33,480
The filthy americano
has to be somewhere.

564
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:48,123
Silvanito?

565
01:23:52,167 --> 01:23:54,283
Where's Silvanito?

566
01:23:56,727 --> 01:23:58,797
Any news today?

567
01:23:58,887 --> 01:24:03,119
I have to tell you some news that's pretty bad.
I hate to tell you this, but..

568
01:24:03,207 --> 01:24:06,119
Where is Silvanito?

569
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:10,280
Silvanito, he was captured this morning
by those men of Ramón's.

570
01:24:10,367 --> 01:24:13,200
They grabbed him
on his way to this mine.

571
01:24:13,287 --> 01:24:16,199
He was bringing in some provisions.
Ramón's got him.

572
01:24:16,287 --> 01:24:20,280
He is being tortured, but he won't talk.
I know him well. He's stubborn.

573
01:24:20,367 --> 01:24:24,076
No matter what they do, he won't say
a word, even if it means his life.

574
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:27,079
Listen to me.
They'll never be able to force him.

575
01:24:38,047 --> 01:24:41,084
Now, old fool, loosen up your tongue.

576
01:24:44,327 --> 01:24:46,318
- No.
- Rubio!

577
01:24:48,607 --> 01:24:50,962
You better get back to your shop, old man.

578
01:24:51,047 --> 01:24:55,677
- You're liable to have business there.
- Very good. That's what I wanted to hear.

579
01:24:55,767 --> 01:25:00,522
And I have a little surprise for you. L
know how much you are going to need it.

580
01:25:00,607 --> 01:25:04,316
It was hard to get my hands on it
but I got it by first using my head.

581
01:25:04,407 --> 01:25:08,161
No one can resist two bottles of wine.
Isn't that right?

582
01:25:08,247 --> 01:25:11,284
Then I thought that, well,
you might need that pistol.

583
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:14,643
And I brought another present.

584
01:25:14,727 --> 01:25:18,117
It's dynamite. I stole it from the Rojos.

585
01:25:19,087 --> 01:25:22,966
And now it seems to me the moment's
come for you to light the fuse

586
01:25:23,047 --> 01:25:25,880
and send it back to them.

587
01:25:43,647 --> 01:25:46,241
Still lots of light.

588
01:25:48,847 --> 01:25:51,645
Too early to be asleep yet.

589
01:25:55,247 --> 01:25:57,397
Rubio, here.

590
01:26:02,207 --> 01:26:07,679
I shouldn't like to ruin the rifle.
I could never find another like this one.

591
01:26:07,767 --> 01:26:11,123
Listen, Ramón.
Let's try it with this one now.

592
01:28:10,447 --> 01:28:12,802
Gringo!

593
01:28:18,567 --> 01:28:21,001
I heard you wanted to see me.

594
01:28:21,767 --> 01:28:24,361
The americano's dead.

595
01:28:25,287 --> 01:28:27,926
Cut the old man down.

596
01:28:44,447 --> 01:28:47,439
What's wrong, Ramón?

597
01:28:47,527 --> 01:28:50,485
You losing your touch?

598
01:28:57,047 --> 01:28:59,720
Are you afraid, Ramón?

599
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:05,443
If you shoot to kill,
you'd better hit the heart.

600
01:29:06,367 --> 01:29:08,756
Your own words, Ramón.

601
01:29:23,927 --> 01:29:25,918
The heart, Ramón.

602
01:29:26,007 --> 01:29:28,475
Don't forget the heart.

603
01:29:30,767 --> 01:29:33,884
Aim for the heart or you'll never stop me.

604
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:09,637
When a man with a.45
meets a man with a rifle,

605
01:31:10,167 --> 01:31:13,637
you said the man
with the pistol's a dead man.

606
01:31:13,727 --> 01:31:16,116
Let's see if that's true.

607
01:31:38,607 --> 01:31:40,882
Go ahead. Load up and shoot.

608
01:33:39,167 --> 01:33:40,964
Hey.

609
01:33:41,047 --> 01:33:43,163
Hey, listen, Joe.

610
01:33:43,247 --> 01:33:45,966
Listen, Joe, I.. l..

611
01:33:47,487 --> 01:33:49,921
Oh, Joe.. Joe..

612
01:34:20,687 --> 01:34:24,760
Well, I guess your government'll
be glad to see that gold back.

613
01:34:24,847 --> 01:34:28,999
And you? You don't want
to be here when they get it, eh?

614
01:34:30,687 --> 01:34:33,645
You mean,
the Mexican government on one side,

615
01:34:33,727 --> 01:34:36,036
maybe the Americans on the other side,

616
01:34:36,127 --> 01:34:38,880
and me right smack in the middle?

617
01:34:38,967 --> 01:34:41,686
Mm-mm. Too dangerous.

618
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:44,996
- So long.
- Adios.

619
