1
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:35,371
You? You again! Get out!

2
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,877
Do what I told you.
Get out!

3
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,554
Go on! Run! I'll teach you
to keep away from me!

4
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:54,015
Run!

5
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,940
Papa!

6
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:06,402
You filthy dog!

7
00:04:07,111 --> 00:04:08,738
You'll settle with me!

8
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:32,554
Let's go.

9
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,507
Welcome to you, stranger.

10
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,760
My name is Juan de Dios.
I am the bell ringer.

11
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:39,055
Why are you here?
To see the Rojos?

12
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:42,850
No, not the Rojos.
Is it the Baxters, maybe?

13
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:44,644
No, maybe not
even the Baxters.

14
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:47,730
You want to get rich? Well, for that
you have come to the right place,

15
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,774
if you use your head.

16
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:53,569
That's because everybody here
has become very rich,

17
00:06:53,653 --> 00:06:55,321
or else they are dead.

18
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:59,033
What you want to buy?
Some guns? Liquor?

19
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:02,704
You don't buy. You sell.
You sell lead in exchange for gold.

20
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,957
You will get rich here,
or you'll be killed.

21
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:08,376
Juan de Dios tolls the bell
once again.

22
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:30,440
It's not smart to go
wandering so far from home.

23
00:07:32,942 --> 00:07:35,028
I reckon he picked
the wrong trail.

24
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:37,155
Or he could have
picked the wrong town.

25
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,782
His big mistake, I think,
was getting born.

26
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:43,453
If you want any work,
looking like that

27
00:07:43,953 --> 00:07:45,872
you could try
being a scarecrow.

28
00:07:45,955 --> 00:07:50,126
Oh, no, the crows are
liable to scare him, maybe.

29
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:09,312
Hello.

30
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:22,075
You can't get rich like that.

31
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:25,578
At most, you will only
succeed in being killed.

32
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:31,584
With all of the trouble we
have, all we needed was you.

33
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:32,835
What are you
looking for?

34
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,254
Food and
something to drink.

35
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:36,464
Water's over there.

36
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:38,591
No, no water.

37
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:40,635
Eating and drinking
and killing.

38
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:44,347
That's all you can do, just
like the rest of your kind.

39
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,601
By the way, you'll
have to mark this up.

40
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:53,481
I know. You have no money.
After all, you just got into town.

41
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:55,775
But if you don't mind
doing a little killing,

42
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:59,779
you will have no trouble finding
someone eager to pay you.

43
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,326
Hmm.

44
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:08,871
My roulette wheel.
That, too, was bartered.

45
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:12,125
No one ever comes here
to play.

46
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,128
We spend our time here between
funerals and burials.

47
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:17,755
Yeah. Never saw a town
as dead as this one.

48
00:09:22,135 --> 00:09:24,262
You will never see
another like it.

49
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,972
What's wrong
with the place?

50
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:28,057
We've had
too many killings.

51
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:30,143
You have seen the women?

52
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:32,228
None of them are women.
They're widows.

53
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:34,272
The place
has only widows.

54
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:36,816
Here you can only gain respect
by killing other men.

55
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,901
So nobody works any more.

56
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:44,031
Seems somebody doesn't
share your opinion.

57
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:45,575
Yes.

58
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:57,420
Know why Piripero
looked you over?

59
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,463
To take
your measurements.

60
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,841
He is so experienced he
can do it with a glance.

61
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:03,843
You will be a customer.

62
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,846
Don't laugh.
I'm not joking.

63
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:10,683
I want to warn you that those murderers
will make a corpse out of you one day.

64
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:13,352
That's why I want you
to get out of here.

65
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:16,439
You don't want to stay
in this cemetery.

66
00:10:16,522 --> 00:10:18,608
Finish up and get out.

67
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,613
I told you
I can't pay you.

68
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:25,656
Be my guest,

69
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:28,743
but get out of San Miguel,
will you?

70
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:32,997
Where does that lead?

71
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,832
The balcony.

72
00:10:36,834 --> 00:10:39,795
Why are you
going there? Hey.

73
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:42,131
To have a look.

74
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:44,550
Things always look
different from higher up.

75
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:46,385
But nothing's up there.

76
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:47,762
Go ahead and get out!

77
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:58,689
Who are they?

78
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:02,485
Bandits.
Bandits and smugglers.

79
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:04,570
They come down from Texas.

80
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:07,657
They cross the frontier to
stock up on guns and liquor.

81
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,659
The cost is
much less here.

82
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:13,537
Then they go back and sell the
guns and liquor to the Indians.

83
00:11:14,914 --> 00:11:17,667
Any town that sells guns and
liquor has gotta be a rich one.

84
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,836
Not the town, only those
who buy and sell,

85
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,631
and the bosses are the
ones who clean up.

86
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:27,093
Yeah? Somebody has to run the place.
Every town has a boss.

87
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:29,720
That's true, but when
there are two around,

88
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:32,306
then I'd say that
there is one too many.

89
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,642
Two bosses?

90
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:36,644
Very interesting.

91
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:39,105
Interesting is right.

92
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:41,732
The Rojos boys, three
brothers who sell liquor.

93
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:45,903
And then there's the Baxters,
big gun merchants.

94
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:51,117
If I'm not mistaken, you already
met Baxter's gang, didn't you?

95
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,868
Yeah, we met.

96
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:57,206
But you're lucky. They don't usually
limit their fire to the mule.

97
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,293
A man leaves his own land and
looks around for any reason,

98
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:04,463
Juan de Dios tolls the bell and
Piripero sells another coffin.

99
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:06,007
Two bosses.

100
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:12,930
They've enlisted all the scum that hangs
around both sides of the frontier,

101
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:15,141
and they pay in dollars.

102
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:20,021
The Baxters over there.

103
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,523
The Rojos there.

104
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:25,026
Me right in the middle.

105
00:12:25,109 --> 00:12:27,111
Where you do what?

106
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:30,740
Crazy bell ringer
was right.

107
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:33,326
There's money to be made
in a place like this.

108
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:37,913
If you're thinking what I suspect,
I tell you, don't try it.

109
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:41,459
Which one of the two
is the stronger?

110
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:44,503
Which one of them
is stronger?

111
00:12:44,587 --> 00:12:48,007
Well, the Rojos,
especially Ramon.

112
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:03,105
Don Miguel Rojo,
I want to talk to you.

113
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,902
Don Miguel, I hear
you're hiring on men.

114
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:11,197
Well, I might
just be available.

115
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:15,701
I gotta tell you
before you hire me,

116
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,456
I don't work cheap.

117
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:37,807
Get three coffins ready.

118
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:08,129
Listen, stranger.
Didn't you get the idea?

119
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:10,589
We don't like to see bad
boys like you in town.

120
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:12,258
Go get your mule.

121
00:14:12,633 --> 00:14:15,761
You let him get away from you?

122
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:18,597
That's what I want to
talk to you about.

123
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:21,767
He's feeling real bad.

124
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:23,561
My mule.

125
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:27,481
You see, he got all riled up when you
men fired those shots at his feet.

126
00:14:29,692 --> 00:14:32,862
Hey, are you making
some kind of joke?

127
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:34,321
Mmm-mmm. No.

128
00:14:35,322 --> 00:14:37,825
See, I understand you men
were just playing around.

129
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:40,578
But the mule...
He just doesn't get it.

130
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:42,872
Of course, if you were
to all apologize...

131
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:57,136
I don't think it's nice,
you laughing.

132
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:04,518
You see, my mule
don't like people laughing.

133
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:08,272
He gets the crazy idea
you're laughing at him.

134
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:11,025
Now, if you apologize,
like I know you're going to,

135
00:15:11,942 --> 00:15:15,404
I might convince him that
you really didn't mean it.

136
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:46,310
I saw the whole thing.
You killed all four of them.

137
00:15:48,103 --> 00:15:50,773
You'll pay all right.
You'll be strung up.

138
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,443
Who are you?

139
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:57,196
Don't fire a shot.

140
00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:01,367
I'm John Baxter, sheriff.

141
00:16:03,077 --> 00:16:07,790
Yeah? Well, if you're the sheriff, you
better get these men underground.

142
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:23,639
My mistake. Four coffins.

143
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,742
I told you I wasn't cheap,

144
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,203
but I think you'll find
it's worth your while.

145
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:48,998
...97,98,99, 100.

146
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,585
The rest
when you're all done.

147
00:16:52,668 --> 00:16:54,837
When do I start?

148
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:57,923
I'm not in a hurry,
at least for the moment.

149
00:16:58,132 --> 00:16:59,675
I'd say with
four less Baxters,

150
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:02,261
right now is as good a
time to start as any.

151
00:17:02,344 --> 00:17:06,432
In a few days I hear there will be a troop
of cavalry passing through San Miguel.

152
00:17:06,515 --> 00:17:10,894
I wouldn't want the military sticking
their long noses into our business.

153
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:14,064
You seem to be
well-informed.

154
00:17:15,816 --> 00:17:20,863
In these parts, a man's life often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

155
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:25,117
This thing couldn't have been
very useful to its owner.

156
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:31,790
My brother Ramon did that.
He often uses it for target practice.

157
00:17:31,874 --> 00:17:35,919
With a gun in his hand,
no one stands in his way.

158
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:38,547
The suit of armor is
one of his favorite targets,

159
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:42,384
naturally, when he does not
have anything better to shoot.

160
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:46,722
Well, I'll be kind of curious
to meet this brother of yours.

161
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:48,766
Ah.

162
00:17:49,308 --> 00:17:52,895
This is Chico,
one of the most trusted of my men.

163
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:56,315
Follow him.
He will bring you to your room.

164
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:58,942
I would like you
to feel at home.

165
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:02,279
Well, I never found home
that great, but let's go.

166
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:22,341
Who's that?

167
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:26,512
Her name's Marisol.
You just forget about her.

168
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:31,850
This one will be your room.

169
00:19:02,965 --> 00:19:04,550
You gave him $100.

170
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:05,592
Yes.

171
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:07,761
We never pay that much.

172
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:10,055
Can you explain to me
why you have taken him on?

173
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:13,642
To have that filthy gringo around the
house and to give him $100 besides?

174
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:16,854
We have never paid
anybody so much.

175
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:19,565
You cannot leave someone like that
to do what he wants around here.

176
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:24,278
He's capable of doing anything.
And I want law and order in this place.

177
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:28,949
If that is all you want,
there is a much cheaper way.

178
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:31,201
Just snuff him out.

179
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,289
And who will be
the one? You?

180
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:37,374
Yes, why not?

181
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,584
A shot in his back,

182
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:41,837
and then you would have him out
of the way in no time at all.

183
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:46,925
Listen, I could do it
easily right now.

184
00:19:47,176 --> 00:19:51,680
He won't be expecting it,
and I'd get back the 100.

185
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,687
You're stupid, Esteban!
Even if you are my brother!

186
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:02,107
A bullet in the back, eh?
And it is ended!

187
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:04,777
And what happens if your hand
should tremble slightly?

188
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,612
And he's only been hurt?

189
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:11,408
And with the cavalry arriving in town
and that Yankee so quick on the draw.

190
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:12,493
I was
only thinking...

191
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:14,203
You mustn't
think of anything!

192
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:16,371
You let me
do the thinking instead.

193
00:20:16,455 --> 00:20:21,210
Go and see the americano.
Just ask him if he needs anything and make friends.

194
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:24,880
Get one thing clear
in that head of yours.

195
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:28,342
This is going to be a quiet
town until Ramon gets back!

196
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:32,888
Is that clear?
A quiet town.

197
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:49,488
I am Esteban Rojo.
My brother asked me to...

198
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:56,286
What are you doing?

199
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:59,414
Moving.

200
00:20:59,498 --> 00:21:02,167
But didn't you know all our
men live here with us?

201
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:09,925
That's all very cozy, but I don't
find you men all that appealing.

202
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:14,471
Besides, your brother said he didn't
have any need for me any more right now.

203
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:39,872
Halt!

204
00:21:41,832 --> 00:21:43,709
<i>Sergeant?
Yes, Capitan?</i>

205
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:47,713
Tell the men we'll be spending
tonight here in this place.

206
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:49,882
Arrange it so they can
pick up the supplies here.

207
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:52,467
Also, double the guard in order
to watch the stagecoach there.

208
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:54,219
Yes, sir.

209
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,639
Now what do you suppose they're
carrying in that coach?

210
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:59,558
It'd be easy
to find out.

211
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:02,102
Get up close to it and take a
little look at what's in it.

212
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:04,813
If they fire at you,
you know it's gold.

213
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:06,732
Not a bad idea.

214
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:21,955
Mmm.

215
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,302
Looking for anything?

216
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:38,013
Hello.

217
00:22:38,347 --> 00:22:39,514
Get out of here, Yankee.

218
00:22:54,112 --> 00:22:56,031
Why aren't you sleeping?

219
00:22:56,949 --> 00:23:00,160
When I see you staring
like that, it bothers me.

220
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:03,830
I still keep wondering
what was in that stagecoach.

221
00:23:03,914 --> 00:23:07,042
It's something they seem to
think is very important.

222
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:11,505
I asked a few questions of the
captain and almost was arrested.

223
00:23:12,547 --> 00:23:14,383
Who's Marisol?

224
00:23:15,801 --> 00:23:18,845
You better get some sleep.
You need it.

225
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:21,390
It's much too dangerous,
even for you.

226
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:25,727
All I did is ask
who she was.

227
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:28,730
She is a woman.

228
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:31,233
And Ramon's madly
in love with her.

229
00:23:31,316 --> 00:23:33,360
Does that make it
clear to you?

230
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:39,157
Everybody in this town
talks about Ramon.

231
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:41,368
Kind of curious
to meet him.

232
00:23:41,576 --> 00:23:45,998
If you are smart, you will try to stay
clear of Ramon as long as possible

233
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:56,591
There are the soldiers.
They are moving on very quietly.

234
00:24:01,304 --> 00:24:03,223
Strange.

235
00:24:03,306 --> 00:24:05,934
They're headed
for the frontier.

236
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,648
Tell me,

237
00:24:13,942 --> 00:24:16,194
is that the way
you go to bed every night?

238
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:20,323
Don't worry.
I didn't dirty the sheets.

239
00:24:21,783 --> 00:24:24,077
No, wait.
I'm coming, too.

240
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:27,664
I want to see for myself how you're
going to get yourself in trouble.

241
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:29,791
All right. All right.
Go ahead.

242
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:17,631
It's like playing
cowboys and Indians.

243
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:23,470
Captain.
Welcome, Lieutenant.

244
00:25:24,846 --> 00:25:27,140
There is your gold
as promised.

245
00:25:27,224 --> 00:25:30,811
I hope the guns you will be giving us
will be equally useful to our army.

246
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:34,272
Rest assured, Captain.
We'll check them over together.

247
00:27:08,116 --> 00:27:10,785
Get their clothes on again,
and hurry.

248
00:27:12,704 --> 00:27:14,372
Be sure to place them around right.

249
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:16,458
Remember. They died
fighting among themselves.

250
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,478
Rubio!

251
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,361
There. It's Ramon.

252
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:00,961
This is my brother Ramon.

253
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:03,088
I think
I mentioned him.

254
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:04,923
Everybody talks
about Ramon.

255
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:09,010
And many speak of you, too,
my dear brother included.

256
00:28:09,177 --> 00:28:12,764
Well, I hope
they say nice things.

257
00:28:14,015 --> 00:28:16,017
Did you have a good trip?

258
00:28:16,434 --> 00:28:18,353
It was tiring.

259
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:21,481
It was terribly hot
on the road during the day.

260
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:25,777
And stagecoaches are an
uncomfortable way to travel.

261
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,197
Well, I'm sure you'll be
in great shape in no time.

262
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:32,784
The americano cannot
wait to get into action.

263
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:35,912
I am sorry. He's going
to be a disappointed man.

264
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:37,455
How's that?

265
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:39,457
The Baxters accepted
the invitation.

266
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:42,043
They'll come tonight,
Don Miguel.

267
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,629
The Baxters coming here?
You must be out of your head.

268
00:28:44,713 --> 00:28:47,716
Chico followed my orders.
I told him to invite them here.

269
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,843
Ramon,
what is this?

270
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,638
I have found out many things
when I was traveling,

271
00:28:53,722 --> 00:28:57,142
and I have decided
that it's very stupid,

272
00:28:57,225 --> 00:29:01,313
to just keep on shooting at each
other and without any results.

273
00:29:01,396 --> 00:29:03,815
You've gone out of
your mind, Ramon.

274
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:06,735
No, I have come
to my senses, Esteban.

275
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,195
Believe me.

276
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:10,739
Trust me.

277
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:13,992
Life can be
so precious.

278
00:29:14,075 --> 00:29:18,330
It's foolish to risk losing
it every minute, no?

279
00:29:18,955 --> 00:29:21,833
There's plenty of space
for everybody in this town.

280
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,918
Even Baxters.

281
00:29:24,878 --> 00:29:27,255
For this reason,

282
00:29:28,256 --> 00:29:31,301
I've decided to hang
my gun up on the wall.

283
00:29:31,926 --> 00:29:33,970
I think that Ramon
has the right idea.

284
00:29:34,054 --> 00:29:37,932
I, too, am getting tired of these killings.
They must stop.

285
00:29:38,808 --> 00:29:42,145
This is all
very, very touching.

286
00:29:42,771 --> 00:29:44,689
You mean you don't admire peace?

287
00:29:44,773 --> 00:29:48,526
It's not real easy to like
something you know nothing about.

288
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:52,655
Stay in San Miguel and you may
just profit from the experience.

289
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:55,909
No, thanks.
I'll be moving on.

290
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,751
Here's your money,
Don Miguel.

291
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:07,087
I only used
a small amount of it.

292
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:11,049
I don't like to take money
unless I feel I've earned it.

293
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:15,720
Now, why are you so hasty?
You should stay here.

294
00:30:15,804 --> 00:30:18,431
You might enjoy
dining with us tonight.

295
00:30:18,598 --> 00:30:22,310
You see, the Baxters have four men
in the cemetery on account of me.

296
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:25,563
I don't think they'd
appreciate my presence.

297
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:36,533
I don't like that americano.
He's too smart to be just a hired fighter.

298
00:30:36,616 --> 00:30:38,243
At shooting a pistol
no one can touch him.

299
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:39,327
I can see that.

300
00:30:39,411 --> 00:30:43,331
When someone with that face works with
his gun, you may count on two things.

301
00:30:43,415 --> 00:30:46,334
He's fast on the trigger,
but he's also intelligent.

302
00:30:46,418 --> 00:30:49,087
That makes him too dangerous
for you, I think, my brothers.

303
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,965
And now that he's gone, will you please
explain to me that silly nonsense

304
00:30:52,048 --> 00:30:55,427
about hanging up your gun and
making up with the Baxters?

305
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,387
Is it possible,
old fellow,

306
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,266
that you'll never be able to reach
any conclusions on your own?

307
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:04,686
Don't you think our government and the
americanos will find those bodies,

308
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:06,771
and then start
an invesfigafion?

309
00:31:06,855 --> 00:31:08,440
They'll investigate,
all right,

310
00:31:08,523 --> 00:31:12,193
and we'll be quiet and
peacefully abide our time.

311
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:16,448
We know nothing about the
massacre at the Rio Bravo, eh?

312
00:31:16,531 --> 00:31:18,783
I arranged for the bodies
to be lying,

313
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:21,661
as if both companies
killed each other.

314
00:31:22,162 --> 00:31:24,747
But do you think
they'll believe it?

315
00:31:24,831 --> 00:31:27,333
Yes, I think so.

316
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:29,502
Because if they don't
find some guilty party,

317
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:32,922
it would be a pretty good reason
to call off the investigation.

318
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:35,717
Yes, but what
about the Baxters?

319
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,136
The Baxters?

320
00:31:38,887 --> 00:31:41,556
They want nothing more
than to live in peace.

321
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:44,058
We'll let them have
their own way for a while.

322
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:45,477
So forget
about the Baxters.

323
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,564
We'll take care of them later
when the investigation finishes.

324
00:31:56,112 --> 00:31:58,781
That was a fine idea
that you had.

325
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:00,783
What was it again?

326
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:02,619
Ah, yes, yes, Yes-

327
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:08,166
The Baxters on one side.
The Rojos on the other.

328
00:32:10,084 --> 00:32:12,212
And you'd be
in the middle.

329
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:15,632
The only problem is that
they've joined up.

330
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,138
Now you are without a job, and you don't
have money to pay me what you owe me.

331
00:32:22,222 --> 00:32:25,683
There is only one thing for you to do.
Leave here immediately.

332
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,810
I will forget about
what you owe me.

333
00:32:27,894 --> 00:32:31,689
And you leave San Miguel and never
come back for the rest of your days.

334
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:35,693
Joe, I have prepared the wagon
the way you asked me to.

335
00:32:35,777 --> 00:32:39,322
It's sitting out in the back
here with two empty coffins.

336
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:41,115
What are you up to?

337
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:43,493
Are you changing
your profession?

338
00:32:43,576 --> 00:32:45,954
If you want to go on
living, you'd better.

339
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:50,041
In my opinion, you'll
make a fine pallbearer.

340
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:53,836
Close this place
and come with me, huh?

341
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,216
Oh, close up? It's done.
Where are we going?

342
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:01,803
I'd like to know where we are
going, or is it a secret?

343
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,683
Down by the river.
Have a look at some corpses down there.

344
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,396
The Rojos say, "Come to
dinner," and we must go.

345
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:56,024
But l don't
like it at all,

346
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:59,444
even if they've granted all the
guarantees we've demanded.

347
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:04,782
We'll go along with it,
but don't touch anything.

348
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:07,619
You mustn't eat.
You mustn't drink.

349
00:34:08,494 --> 00:34:12,707
You just keep your eyes open
and keep your wits about you.

350
00:34:38,483 --> 00:34:40,985
Are you sure that
nobody has seen us?

351
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:43,154
Only a ghost or two.

352
00:34:43,237 --> 00:34:45,990
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't joke about things like this.

353
00:34:46,074 --> 00:34:48,910
Ghosts are better left
where they are.

354
00:34:50,161 --> 00:34:52,830
You look as though this
place suits you very well.

355
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:56,125
And if you go on like this, you
will soon be here permanently.

356
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:10,181
I do not understand.

357
00:35:10,264 --> 00:35:14,352
Why is it with all those bodies down by
the river we are just burying these two?

358
00:35:14,435 --> 00:35:16,729
We're not.
We're not gonna bury them.

359
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:19,023
What do you mean
we're not burying them?

360
00:35:19,107 --> 00:35:21,818
That's right.
We're not gonna bury them.

361
00:35:23,194 --> 00:35:24,445
If we are not going to
bury them,

362
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:27,615
I would like to know
what we will use them for?

363
00:35:27,782 --> 00:35:30,785
Why are we taking
the trouble to do this?

364
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:33,871
The dead can be
very useful sometimes.

365
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:40,586
They've helped me out of
tough spots more than once.

366
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:48,886
First, they don't talk.

367
00:35:50,638 --> 00:35:54,308
Second, they can be made to look
alive if I manage it right.

368
00:35:56,602 --> 00:35:58,229
And, third...

369
00:35:59,897 --> 00:36:02,191
Well, third, if you shoot
them, there's no worry,

370
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:04,277
'cause they're dead already.

371
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,653
Understand?

372
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:08,990
It doesn't make a bit of sense
to me, and I'm getting out.

373
00:36:09,073 --> 00:36:11,200
I'm alive, and I want to remain
with the living, understand?

374
00:36:11,284 --> 00:36:13,161
And when I'm dead, I'll want
to remain with the dead.

375
00:36:13,244 --> 00:36:15,955
I would be unhappy if somebody living
forces me to remain with the living.

376
00:36:16,038 --> 00:36:18,166
I hope that's clear.

377
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:22,628
And, also, I don't like the idea that
you've placed those bodies there!

378
00:36:22,712 --> 00:36:23,921
The man we buried
in that grave

379
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:27,091
is the only one who ever died of
pneumonia in this cursed town!

380
00:36:27,175 --> 00:36:28,760
Take it easy now,
will you?

381
00:36:28,843 --> 00:36:32,597
These two friends of ours here
are gonna help me pay your bill.

382
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,932
Get up there!

383
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:04,962
The only reason they could
have to start a war with us,

384
00:37:05,046 --> 00:37:08,132
would be to kidnap you
from your husband's side.

385
00:37:09,342 --> 00:37:11,302
He's gallant, this Rojo.

386
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:14,305
I really didn't think him
capable of compliments.

387
00:37:14,388 --> 00:37:19,143
And he's not. All that he says
is false, like his proposals.

388
00:37:19,227 --> 00:37:23,689
You women. If things aren't complicated
for you, you become suspicious.

389
00:37:24,232 --> 00:37:28,110
Yes, because to me, it
just didn't seem right.

390
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:31,572
It went too smoothly.
I don't trust them.

391
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:34,242
You'd like to prove me
wrong, wouldn't you?

392
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:36,244
Always the same thing.

393
00:37:38,246 --> 00:37:40,873
Good night.

394
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:21,998
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

395
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:26,627
I just want you to know why the Rojos
want to make peace all of a sudden.

396
00:38:27,795 --> 00:38:29,714
You see, there was once
a wagon load of gold

397
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:32,300
that the soldiers were
taking to the border.

398
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,269
John, come up here quickly.

399
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:54,155
Sorry, but when a husband finds
a man in his wife's bedroom,

400
00:38:54,238 --> 00:38:56,866
you're never sure
how he's gonna react.

401
00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:00,953
Give him $500.

402
00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:02,079
How's that?

403
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:04,582
Give the money to him.

404
00:39:04,832 --> 00:39:07,585
He has an interesting story.
Listen to him.

405
00:39:08,586 --> 00:39:10,588
That's the right idea?
You didn't misunderstand?

406
00:39:10,671 --> 00:39:12,590
I get the wrong idea
only when it suits me.

407
00:39:12,673 --> 00:39:13,841
- Ramon.
- What is it?

408
00:39:13,925 --> 00:39:15,760
The soldiers, the ones who
were escorting the gold...

409
00:39:15,843 --> 00:39:18,596
Two of those soldiers got away.
They are hiding out in the cemetery.

410
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:21,766
The Baxters.
They're about to capture them.

411
00:39:24,101 --> 00:39:25,895
Rubio! Get the men!

412
00:39:28,522 --> 00:39:30,608
You are well-informed, eh?

413
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:34,779
A man's life in these parts often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

414
00:39:34,862 --> 00:39:36,989
Your brother's
own words.

415
00:39:37,198 --> 00:39:39,700
Tell me. Why are you
doing this for us?

416
00:39:43,245 --> 00:39:44,705
$500.

417
00:39:52,254 --> 00:39:55,216
With these two soldiers
as witnesses against Ramon,

418
00:39:55,299 --> 00:39:58,970
the government will be able to rid the
town of the Rojos and their whole band.

419
00:39:59,053 --> 00:40:01,722
Then San Miguel
will have just one boss.

420
00:40:01,806 --> 00:40:03,015
Hurry!

421
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,740
Let's go!

422
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,370
Coming with us?

423
00:40:24,453 --> 00:40:26,497
Oh, no. When a man's got
money in his pocket,

424
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,749
he begins to
appreciate peace.

425
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:31,127
Come on!

426
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:42,740
Let's leave the horses here.

427
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:07,223
Who's there? Come out!

428
00:42:29,078 --> 00:42:31,122
What do you think?

429
00:42:31,205 --> 00:42:32,623
I don't know.

430
00:42:33,332 --> 00:42:35,501
There's something
about it I don't like.

431
00:42:35,584 --> 00:42:38,629
Too still to be wounded.
More like dummies.

432
00:42:38,712 --> 00:42:40,714
Sure, dummies that are very
interesting to the Rojos.

433
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:42,716
Better hide. Hurry.

434
00:44:57,685 --> 00:44:58,978
What'll we do?

435
00:44:59,061 --> 00:45:01,230
Take two men and circle
around to the side.

436
00:45:01,313 --> 00:45:04,566
Try to keep them busy long enough
for me to get those two down there.

437
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:07,111
Go on. Go on. Quickly.

438
00:45:44,231 --> 00:45:47,401
Keep me covered.
I am going to take care of those two.

439
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:28,275
Listen, Baxter!
You can have them now if you like!

440
00:46:28,692 --> 00:46:31,445
Since dead men
can't talk!

441
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:45,709
It seems they didn't
like my joke.

442
00:46:45,793 --> 00:46:48,962
We'll let them go home
in a little while.

443
00:48:32,774 --> 00:48:34,151
Keep this bad boy
as our guest,

444
00:48:34,234 --> 00:48:37,237
only until Baxter leaves San
Miguel and heads for the frontier.

445
00:48:37,321 --> 00:48:39,114
Put him in the cellar.

446
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:47,498
Esteban, good work.

447
00:48:47,581 --> 00:48:51,710
With Antonio as our prisoner, the Baxters
are going to have to give in to us.

448
00:48:51,793 --> 00:48:53,504
Now we can make
any kind of demand.

449
00:48:53,587 --> 00:48:55,756
Don Miguel!
Don Miguel!

450
00:49:01,094 --> 00:49:03,555
What has happened?
Talk, will you?

451
00:49:03,639 --> 00:49:06,266
I don't know, but
somebody shot at me.

452
00:49:06,350 --> 00:49:07,893
Marisol!

453
00:49:09,394 --> 00:49:10,604
Marisol!

454
00:49:11,188 --> 00:49:13,440
Where are you, Marisol?

455
00:49:26,703 --> 00:49:29,706
It's strange how you
always manage to be

456
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,792
in the right place
at the right time.

457
00:49:38,799 --> 00:49:43,595
It's nothing serious.
A headache that will pass. She'll sleep.

458
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:52,729
Keep your eyes open.
She's not to move from that room. You hear?

459
00:49:59,361 --> 00:50:02,239
I wouldn't mention anything
about me bringing her here.

460
00:50:02,322 --> 00:50:05,325
I wouldn't want the Rojos
to think I was on your side.

461
00:50:05,576 --> 00:50:07,160
Don't be worried.

462
00:50:07,327 --> 00:50:12,416
I'm a woman who's rich enough to
appreciate the men that my money can buy.

463
00:50:12,749 --> 00:50:14,418
I've been to talk
to the Rojos.

464
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:16,712
They'll give back Antonio
in exchange for Marisol.

465
00:50:16,795 --> 00:50:18,880
It'll take place
in the morning.

466
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:24,803
Very soon you are
going to be rich.

467
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,937
Yeah, and that's not
gonna break my heart.

468
00:52:17,082 --> 00:52:20,210
Where is she?
You said I'd be able to see her!

469
00:52:20,293 --> 00:52:21,795
Where is she?

470
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:25,173
I wanna see her!

471
00:52:25,257 --> 00:52:26,550
Come back here, Jesus.
Come here.

472
00:52:26,633 --> 00:52:27,718
Where is she?

473
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:30,178
I want to see her!
I want to see her!

474
00:52:30,262 --> 00:52:34,099
Why can't I look at her?
I want to see her!

475
00:52:52,826 --> 00:52:55,537
Go. Go to him, Marisol.

476
00:53:20,312 --> 00:53:21,521
Mama!

477
00:53:24,608 --> 00:53:26,109
Mama!

478
00:53:26,193 --> 00:53:27,360
Jesus!

479
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:35,494
Mama!

480
00:53:37,996 --> 00:53:39,039
Jesus!

481
00:53:39,122 --> 00:53:41,041
Mama!Mama!

482
00:54:31,424 --> 00:54:32,551
Julio!

483
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,970
Marisol.

484
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,431
Get Julio.

485
00:54:48,817 --> 00:54:51,278
You were warned
to get out of town.

486
00:54:51,778 --> 00:54:54,906
Now I'm gonna make you
pay once and for all.

487
00:54:56,992 --> 00:54:58,785
Let him be.

488
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:40,201
You better get going.
Ramon's waiting.

489
00:55:44,164 --> 00:55:47,083
And, you, get that kid
home where he belongs.

490
00:56:34,673 --> 00:56:36,591
A pig, that Ramon.

491
00:56:37,801 --> 00:56:40,512
Tell me, what's Ramon
got to do with them?

492
00:56:40,595 --> 00:56:42,722
You weren't told, eh?

493
00:56:44,975 --> 00:56:47,310
In this part of the world,
the story is very old.

494
00:56:47,394 --> 00:56:50,271
A happy little family
until trouble comes along.

495
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:52,273
And trouble has
the name of Ramon.

496
00:56:52,357 --> 00:56:54,985
Claiming the husband cheated
at cards, which wasn't true,

497
00:56:55,068 --> 00:56:58,530
he gets the wife to live
with him as hostage.

498
00:56:58,613 --> 00:57:00,240
And the husband?

499
00:57:00,323 --> 00:57:03,201
Him? There's nothing
for him to do.

500
00:57:03,493 --> 00:57:05,870
The Rojos threatened to
kill his little boy Jesus,

501
00:57:05,954 --> 00:57:08,623
and he was forced
to accept things.

502
00:57:11,126 --> 00:57:13,211
That Ramon is smart.

503
00:57:15,171 --> 00:57:17,090
Where are you going?

504
00:57:20,635 --> 00:57:23,596
To the Rojos
to look for a job.

505
00:57:29,436 --> 00:57:31,688
I am glad we have
the americano with us.

506
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:34,524
It's the best thing that could
have happened to us, you know,

507
00:57:34,607 --> 00:57:37,569
'cause if either government
starts an inquiry,

508
00:57:37,652 --> 00:57:39,654
we'll need every man
we can get.

509
00:57:41,114 --> 00:57:44,701
I guess you know to be at
war with the Baxters now,

510
00:57:44,784 --> 00:57:46,619
is worse than sitting
on a big case of dynamite.

511
00:57:46,703 --> 00:57:47,996
Where should
we put this?

512
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,956
Put it over there.

513
00:57:57,464 --> 00:57:59,924
Come on, everybody!
Drink up!

514
00:58:31,664 --> 00:58:34,042
Good shooting.
Very good shooting.

515
00:58:34,209 --> 00:58:36,419
When you want to kill a man,
you must shoot for his heart.

516
00:58:36,503 --> 00:58:39,297
And the Winchester
is the best weapon.

517
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,842
That's very nice, but
I'll stick with my .45.

518
00:58:43,176 --> 00:58:46,513
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

519
00:58:46,596 --> 00:58:49,516
the man with the pistol
will be a dead man.

520
00:58:50,308 --> 00:58:53,269
That's an old Mexican
proverb, and it's true.

521
00:58:54,854 --> 00:58:56,773
You believe that?

522
00:58:58,233 --> 00:59:01,319
Paquito, take five men and escort
Marisol to the small house.

523
00:59:01,402 --> 00:59:03,613
And stay there
till I return.

524
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:13,665
Everything's
prepared.

525
00:59:13,748 --> 00:59:15,416
Do not be worried.

526
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:18,044
I will return tomorrow.

527
00:59:18,128 --> 00:59:19,796
All the wagons are ready.
We can leave.

528
00:59:19,879 --> 00:59:23,800
Everyone, enjoy yourselves
during my absence.

529
00:59:41,526 --> 00:59:44,070
You heard Ramon.
Let's have a good time.

530
00:59:52,495 --> 00:59:55,915
<i>Do you remember
sweet Becky from Pike</i>

531
00:59:56,249 --> 00:59:59,586
<i>She roamed the world
with her lover Ike</i>

532
01:00:00,336 --> 01:00:02,297
<i>Ike and Betsy</i>

533
01:00:02,589 --> 01:00:04,382
<i>Betsy from Pike...</i>

534
01:00:08,011 --> 01:00:09,929
He weighs over a ton.
Of course,

535
01:00:10,013 --> 01:00:12,182
with all he poured
into himself.

536
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:30,969
Papa,

537
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:35,515
did you not tell me
no one could go see Mama?

538
01:01:36,641 --> 01:01:38,101
That's right.

539
01:01:38,601 --> 01:01:41,646
Then why does that man
see her when I cannot?

540
01:01:44,774 --> 01:01:45,775
I want Mama.

541
01:01:45,858 --> 01:01:47,610
Go away
from the door.

542
01:01:47,694 --> 01:01:50,655
Quiet! Quiet.
We cannot show ourselves.

543
01:01:50,738 --> 01:01:52,907
You must remember that.
You must stay away.

544
01:02:04,127 --> 01:02:05,712
Hello.

545
01:02:25,648 --> 01:02:27,608
There's somebody shooting
up at the small house.

546
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:30,945
Saddle the horses immediately!
Come on. Let's go!

547
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,933
Look out!

548
01:03:48,314 --> 01:03:50,858
Here you are.
Now, take this money.

549
01:03:50,942 --> 01:03:54,153
It's enough to live on for a while.
Now, get across the border.

550
01:03:54,237 --> 01:03:56,906
Get as much distance between
yourselves and San Miguel as possible.

551
01:03:56,989 --> 01:03:59,867
How may we thank you
for what you are doing?

552
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,162
Don't try. Just get going
before the Rojos get here.

553
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:09,377
Why do you do this for us?

554
01:04:10,837 --> 01:04:13,881
Why? 'Cause I knew
someone like you once.

555
01:04:13,965 --> 01:04:17,051
There was no one there
to help. Now, get moving.

556
01:04:19,345 --> 01:04:20,763
Get moving.

557
01:04:22,223 --> 01:04:24,183
Get out of here!

558
01:05:06,392 --> 01:05:08,686
What do you see, Chico?

559
01:05:08,769 --> 01:05:12,190
They're all dead.
They massacred them.

560
01:05:12,273 --> 01:05:13,733
They kidnapped Marisol!

561
01:05:13,816 --> 01:05:15,985
This looks like the work of the Baxters.

562
01:05:16,068 --> 01:05:19,655
Quick, let's get back before
they attack our house and the town.

563
01:07:14,562 --> 01:07:17,231
Chico, give out the ammunition.

564
01:07:17,315 --> 01:07:21,193
Esteban, spread your men around the house.
Keep your eyes open.

565
01:07:21,277 --> 01:07:24,322
Miguel, Paco, Vincente,
Martin, behind the house.

566
01:07:24,405 --> 01:07:28,284
Manolo and Alvaro,
come with me. Stay alert.

567
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:31,871
The way they killed the men in the small
house, there must be a lot of them.

568
01:07:40,004 --> 01:07:41,922
It's a warm evening.

569
01:07:45,468 --> 01:07:49,889
One of our wagons lost a wheel, so we
had to turn back here to get help.

570
01:07:51,724 --> 01:07:54,018
One of the men tells me,

571
01:07:54,894 --> 01:07:57,521
the Baxters
attacked the small house.

572
01:07:59,398 --> 01:08:01,317
Do you know about it?

573
01:08:04,737 --> 01:08:06,906
Tell me what you know.

574
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:27,927
Well?

575
01:08:29,428 --> 01:08:31,347
Where did you hide Marisol?

576
01:08:34,058 --> 01:08:35,226
Rubio.

577
01:09:01,168 --> 01:09:03,879
You are thirsty.
You want to drink?

578
01:09:04,463 --> 01:09:07,299
No, no,
it is too soon to drink.

579
01:09:11,137 --> 01:09:13,097
Bring him over here!

580
01:09:41,834 --> 01:09:43,461
You are behaving
like a stubborn idiot.

581
01:09:43,544 --> 01:09:46,088
Tell us where Marisol is,
and it will all be ended!

582
01:09:46,172 --> 01:09:47,423
In a week,
you'll be back in shape.

583
01:09:47,506 --> 01:09:50,342
You'll get out and you can
go wherever you want.

584
01:10:01,771 --> 01:10:03,856
That's enough for today.

585
01:10:04,398 --> 01:10:07,818
Sooner or later, he'll talk.
It's just a matter of time.

586
01:10:08,486 --> 01:10:12,281
Watch out he doesn't escape or die.
Otherwise, do as you like.

587
01:10:15,868 --> 01:10:19,497
But wait till he comes to.
This way, he hardly feels anything.

588
01:10:52,112 --> 01:10:54,532
I've had a poker hand waiting
for me for three days.

589
01:10:54,615 --> 01:10:57,952
Now I'm stuck here! I can't get to it
while I'm guarding this americano idiot!

590
01:10:58,035 --> 01:11:00,204
I think you will find this
more amusing than cards.

591
01:11:00,287 --> 01:11:02,623
All orders are to be sure
he does not die,

592
01:11:02,706 --> 01:11:06,168
and also make sure he regrets
the day he was born.

593
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,506
The gringo is asleep,
I imagine.

594
01:11:10,589 --> 01:11:13,425
That's all right.
I'll enjoy waking him up.

595
01:12:17,323 --> 01:12:19,408
Esteban, what was that noise?

596
01:12:19,491 --> 01:12:20,826
I do not know.

597
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:22,995
I heard a yell,
and then a crash.

598
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:57,029
It's useless to hide.

599
01:12:59,281 --> 01:13:01,200
You're finished playing
the smart boy.

600
01:13:03,118 --> 01:13:05,037
Go up and look in the loft.

601
01:13:06,538 --> 01:13:08,999
And take a look
behind the barrels!

602
01:13:20,594 --> 01:13:22,554
Let's get out of here!

603
01:13:32,398 --> 01:13:34,775
Hurry! Quick!

604
01:13:34,858 --> 01:13:38,237
Hurry with that water!
Hey, you, come with me!

605
01:13:53,043 --> 01:13:56,672
Surround the town!
Block all the streets leading out!

606
01:13:56,755 --> 01:13:58,716
Find him for me!

607
01:14:00,092 --> 01:14:01,844
Esteban, search
the whole town.

608
01:14:01,927 --> 01:14:03,178
Follow me!

609
01:14:04,555 --> 01:14:08,017
Get him back right now!
You've got to at any cost!

610
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:11,895
Look in the stables, in every
corral, in the storeroom!

611
01:14:11,979 --> 01:14:13,647
Look for him in the church!

612
01:14:14,023 --> 01:14:16,567
Go in there!
Search every inch of it!

613
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:20,029
Search everywhere!
Rubio, in here!

614
01:14:20,863 --> 01:14:23,699
If somebody is hiding him,
burn their house down,

615
01:14:23,782 --> 01:14:25,784
and kill them like dogs!

616
01:14:25,993 --> 01:14:27,453
You, up here!

617
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:31,999
Look for him near the Baxters, but
take him alive! I want him alive!

618
01:14:32,082 --> 01:14:33,667
Alive!

619
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:37,463
Rubio, in the bar.

620
01:15:08,077 --> 01:15:11,538
He says he knows nothing.
He's trying to be smart.

621
01:15:11,622 --> 01:15:13,540
Bring him here to me.

622
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:17,461
I swear I'm telling the truth.

623
01:15:17,544 --> 01:15:20,172
Well, you know nothing, huh?

624
01:15:21,924 --> 01:15:22,925
I've not seen him.

625
01:15:23,008 --> 01:15:25,094
Rubio, you take care of him.

626
01:16:06,635 --> 01:16:08,554
Where have you hidden him?

627
01:16:10,055 --> 01:16:12,349
I didn't...

628
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:20,566
You're the right friend
for that filthy americano.

629
01:16:20,649 --> 01:16:22,568
And you'll end up
the same way.

630
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:25,529
We looked everywhere.

631
01:16:25,612 --> 01:16:28,323
In his cellar, in the
attic, on the roof.

632
01:16:28,407 --> 01:16:30,534
But there is no trace.

633
01:16:30,742 --> 01:16:32,661
I couldn't find anybody
there in the back room.

634
01:16:32,744 --> 01:16:35,831
I'm certain he has taken
refuge with the Baxters.

635
01:16:35,914 --> 01:16:37,207
The americano
isn't stupid.

636
01:16:37,291 --> 01:16:40,586
He knows that that's the
best place for him to hide.

637
01:16:42,671 --> 01:16:44,590
The Baxters, eh?

638
01:16:45,757 --> 01:16:47,843
Then better go
and get him.

639
01:16:51,889 --> 01:16:53,807
And that's for
being his friend.

640
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:29,885
Curse them.

641
01:17:37,684 --> 01:17:38,936
Eh?

642
01:17:46,026 --> 01:17:47,486
Piripero.

643
01:17:59,081 --> 01:18:00,082
Come here.

644
01:18:00,165 --> 01:18:01,792
I can't see anybody.

645
01:18:03,043 --> 01:18:04,628
Come here.

646
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,265
What are you doing
in there?

647
01:18:16,974 --> 01:18:19,184
Never mind.
Get me out of here.

648
01:18:19,559 --> 01:18:21,853
But you're not dead yet.

649
01:18:21,937 --> 01:18:26,066
I will be if you don't get me out of here, quick.
Get that lid down.

650
01:19:52,986 --> 01:19:53,987
Rubio.

651
01:20:16,051 --> 01:20:18,303
I see some signs of life.

652
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:21,556
Let's be ready when they
decide to come out.

653
01:20:25,685 --> 01:20:27,979
Don't shoot!
We surrender!

654
01:20:28,188 --> 01:20:29,189
Don't shoot!

655
01:20:30,857 --> 01:20:34,569
Stop! Don't shoot!
We're coming out!

656
01:20:37,572 --> 01:20:39,950
I'm surrendering!
Hold back your fire!

657
01:20:40,033 --> 01:20:41,118
Don't shoot!

658
01:20:41,201 --> 01:20:43,829
We're surrendering!

659
01:21:12,065 --> 01:21:13,400
Stop.

660
01:21:14,276 --> 01:21:16,194
I wanna take a look at this.

661
01:22:52,457 --> 01:22:56,378
Ramon, don't shoot!
We're coming out!

662
01:22:59,965 --> 01:23:01,675
We surrender!

663
01:23:01,758 --> 01:23:04,678
Listen, you've won.
It's enough!

664
01:23:04,761 --> 01:23:07,097
I'll get out of town!
I'll do whatever you like!

665
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,223
You promise that?

666
01:23:08,306 --> 01:23:10,183
I swear it, Ramon!

667
01:23:10,642 --> 01:23:12,644
You won't try a trick
of any kind?

668
01:23:12,894 --> 01:23:15,438
None! No, no tricks!

669
01:23:15,522 --> 01:23:17,816
I said before, I give you my word.
We'll leave!

670
01:23:17,899 --> 01:23:21,570
Are you sure? You had better
ask permission of your wife.

671
01:23:23,405 --> 01:23:26,032
Maybe she won't
be too happy!

672
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:40,130
Antonio!

673
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:42,841
John!

674
01:24:07,782 --> 01:24:09,367
Murderers.

675
01:24:10,994 --> 01:24:13,622
They had no guns.

676
01:24:13,705 --> 01:24:16,541
Murderers!
I hope you rot in hell!

677
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:20,587
May you and your brothers die spitting blood!
Curse you for this!

678
01:24:21,087 --> 01:24:22,881
Murderers!

679
01:24:45,528 --> 01:24:48,031
Let's go.
The show's over, anyway.

680
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:55,664
Keep looking for him.
Search among those bodies.

681
01:24:56,331 --> 01:24:58,458
The filthy americano
has to be somewhere!

682
01:27:17,806 --> 01:27:18,807
Silvanito?

683
01:27:23,978 --> 01:27:25,980
Where's Silvanito?

684
01:27:29,234 --> 01:27:30,777
Any news today?

685
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:33,696
I have to tell you some
news that's pretty bad.

686
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:35,490
I hate to tell you
this, Joe,but“

687
01:27:35,573 --> 01:27:37,325
Where is Silvanito?

688
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:42,747
Silvanito, he was captured this
morning by those men of Ramon's.

689
01:27:42,914 --> 01:27:45,959
They grabbed him outside the village.
He was on his way to this mine.

690
01:27:46,042 --> 01:27:49,045
He was bringing in some provisions.
Ramon's got him now.

691
01:27:49,128 --> 01:27:51,130
He's being tortured,
but he won't talk.

692
01:27:51,214 --> 01:27:53,174
I know him well.
He's a stubborn man.

693
01:27:53,258 --> 01:27:57,262
No matter what they do to him, he won't
say a word, even if it means his life.

694
01:27:57,345 --> 01:28:00,431
Listen to me.
They'll never be able to force him.

695
01:28:11,734 --> 01:28:14,904
Now, old fool,
loosen up your tongue.

696
01:28:18,324 --> 01:28:20,285
O
Rubio!

697
01:28:22,829 --> 01:28:25,206
You better get back
to your shop, old man.

698
01:28:25,331 --> 01:28:26,708
You're liable to
have some business.

699
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:28,209
Very good!

700
01:28:28,293 --> 01:28:30,211
That's what
I wanted to hear.

701
01:28:30,295 --> 01:28:33,548
And I have a little surprise
for you that I brought along.

702
01:28:33,631 --> 01:28:35,300
I know how much you
are going to need it.

703
01:28:35,383 --> 01:28:37,218
It was very hard
to get my hands on it.

704
01:28:37,302 --> 01:28:41,806
But I got it by first using my head.
No one can resist two barrels of wine.

705
01:28:41,890 --> 01:28:44,475
Isn't that right?
Then I thought that,

706
01:28:44,559 --> 01:28:48,396
well, you might need that pistol,
and I brought another present.

707
01:28:50,064 --> 01:28:53,985
It's dynamite.
I stole it from the Rojos.

708
01:28:54,485 --> 01:28:55,695
And now it seems to me

709
01:28:55,778 --> 01:28:58,656
the moment's come for
you to light the fuse

710
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:00,742
and send it
back to them.

711
01:29:20,136 --> 01:29:22,055
Still lots of light.

712
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,478
Too early
to be asleep, yet.

713
01:29:32,357 --> 01:29:33,942
Rubio, here.

714
01:29:39,489 --> 01:29:43,826
I shouldn't like to ruin the rifle.
I could never find another like this.

715
01:29:45,328 --> 01:29:47,664
Listen, Ramon, let's try
it with this one now.

716
01:31:53,289 --> 01:31:54,499
Gringo!

717
01:32:01,756 --> 01:32:04,175
Heard you wanted
to see me.

718
01:32:05,051 --> 01:32:07,386
<i>The americano's</i> dead.

719
01:32:08,679 --> 01:32:10,640
Let the old man down.

720
01:32:28,699 --> 01:32:31,119
What's wrong, Ramon?

721
01:32:31,702 --> 01:32:33,663
You losing your touch?

722
01:32:41,879 --> 01:32:43,297
Are you afraid, Ramon?

723
01:32:47,093 --> 01:32:50,471
You shoot to kill,
you better hit the heart.

724
01:32:51,514 --> 01:32:53,349
Your own words, Ramon.

725
01:33:09,907 --> 01:33:11,742
The heart, Ramon.

726
01:33:12,076 --> 01:33:13,995
Don't forget the heart.

727
01:33:17,081 --> 01:33:19,917
Aim for the heart
or you'll never stop me.

728
01:34:56,514 --> 01:35:00,017
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

729
01:35:00,518 --> 01:35:02,937
you said the man with the
pistol's a dead man.

730
01:35:04,146 --> 01:35:06,732
Let's see if that's true.

731
01:35:30,256 --> 01:35:32,550
Go ahead, load up and shoot.

732
01:37:38,008 --> 01:37:40,136
Hey, listen, Joe.

733
01:37:40,219 --> 01:37:43,055
Listen, Joe, I...

734
01:37:44,807 --> 01:37:46,934
Oh, Joe, Joe.

735
01:38:19,383 --> 01:38:23,596
Well, guess your government will
be glad to see that gold back.

736
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:28,058
And you, you don't want to be
here when they get it, eh?

737
01:38:29,727 --> 01:38:32,771
You mean, the Mexican
government on one side,

738
01:38:32,855 --> 01:38:35,399
and maybe the Americans
on the other side?

739
01:38:35,483 --> 01:38:38,319
Me, right smack
in the middle?

740
01:38:38,402 --> 01:38:40,279
Mmm-mmm.
Too dangerous.

741
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:43,491
So long..
