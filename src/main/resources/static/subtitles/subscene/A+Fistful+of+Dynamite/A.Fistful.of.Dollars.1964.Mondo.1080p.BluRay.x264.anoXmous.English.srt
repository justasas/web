1
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:34,968
You? You again! Get out!

2
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,468
Do what I told you.
Get out!

3
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:51,133
Go on! Run! I'll teach you
to keep away from me!

4
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:53,591
Run!

5
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,507
Papa!

6
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,964
You filthy dog!

7
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:08,298
You'll settle with me!

8
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:32,087
Let's go.

9
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:31,907
Welcome to you, stranger.

10
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,157
My name is Juan de Dios.
I am the bell ringer.

11
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:38,448
Why are you here?
To see the Rojos?

12
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,239
No, not the Rojos.
Is it the Baxters, maybe?

13
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:44,031
No, maybe not
even the Baxters.

14
00:06:44,114 --> 00:06:47,113
You want to get rich? Well, for that
you have come to the right place,

15
00:06:47,197 --> 00:06:49,155
if you use your head.

16
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:52,946
That's because everybody here
has become very rich,

17
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,696
or else they are dead.

18
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,404
What you want to buy?
Some guns? Liquor?

19
00:06:58,987 --> 00:07:02,071
You don't buy. You sell.
You sell lead in exchange for gold.

20
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:05,320
You will get rich here,
or you'll be killed.

21
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:07,736
Juan de Dios tolls the bell
once again.

22
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:29,776
It's not smart to go
wandering so far from home.

23
00:07:32,275 --> 00:07:34,359
I reckon he picked
the wrong trail.

24
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:36,483
Or he could have
picked the wrong town.

25
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:39,108
His big mistake, I think,
was getting born.

26
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:42,774
If you want any work,
looking like that

27
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:45,191
you could try
being a scarecrow.

28
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:49,440
Oh, no, the crows are
liable to scare him, maybe.

29
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:08,605
Hello.

30
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:21,354
You can't get rich like that.

31
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:24,853
At most, you will only
succeed in being killed.

32
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:30,852
With all of the trouble we
have, all we needed was you.

33
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:32,102
What are you
looking for?

34
00:08:32,186 --> 00:08:34,518
Food and
something to drink.

35
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:35,727
Water's over there.

36
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,851
No, no water.

37
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,893
Eating and drinking
and killing.

38
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:43,601
That's all you can do, just
like the rest of your kind.

39
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:47,850
By the way, you'll
have to mark this up.

40
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:52,725
I know. You have no money.
After all, you just got into town.

41
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:55,016
But if you don't mind
doing a little killing,

42
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:59,016
you will have no trouble finding
someone eager to pay you.

43
00:09:03,432 --> 00:09:04,557
Hmm.

44
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:08,098
My roulette wheel.
That, too, was bartered.

45
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,348
No one ever comes here
to play.

46
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,348
We spend our time here between
funerals and burials.

47
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:16,972
Yeah. Never saw a town
as dead as this one.

48
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:23,472
You will never see
another like it.

49
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,180
What's wrong
with the place?

50
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:27,262
We've had
too many killings.

51
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,346
You have seen the women?

52
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:31,429
None of them are women.
They're widows.

53
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:33,470
The place
has only widows.

54
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:36,012
Here you can only gain respect
by killing other men.

55
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:38,094
So nobody works any more.

56
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:43,219
Seems somebody doesn't
share your opinion.

57
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:44,761
Yes.

58
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,593
Know why Piripero
looked you over?

59
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:58,633
To take
your measurements.

60
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:01,009
He is so experienced he
can do it with a glance.

61
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:03,009
You will be a customer.

62
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,008
Don't laugh.
I'm not joking.

63
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:09,841
I want to warn you that those murderers
will make a corpse out of you one day.

64
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:12,507
That's why I want you
to get out of here.

65
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:15,591
You don't want to stay
in this cemetery.

66
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:17,757
Finish up and get out.

67
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:22,757
I told you
I can't pay you.

68
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,797
Be my guest,

69
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,881
but get out of San Miguel,
will you?

70
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,130
Where does that lead?

71
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:33,963
The balcony.

72
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:38,921
Why are you
going there? Hey.

73
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:41,254
To have a look.

74
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:43,670
Things always look
different from higher up.

75
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:45,503
But nothing's up there.

76
00:10:45,587 --> 00:10:46,879
Go ahead and get out!

77
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:57,794
Who are they?

78
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,586
Bandits.
Bandits and smugglers.

79
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:03,668
They come down from Texas.

80
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:06,752
They cross the frontier to
stock up on guns and liquor.

81
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:08,752
The cost is
much less here.

82
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,625
Then they go back and sell the
guns and liquor to the Indians.

83
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:16,751
Any town that sells guns and
liquor has gotta be a rich one.

84
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:19,916
Not the town, only those
who buy and sell,

85
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,708
and the bosses are the
ones who clean up.

86
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:26,166
Yeah? Somebody has to run the place.
Every town has a boss.

87
00:11:26,249 --> 00:11:28,790
That's true, but when
there are two around,

88
00:11:28,874 --> 00:11:31,373
then I'd say that
there is one too many.

89
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,707
Two bosses?

90
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,707
Very interesting.

91
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:38,165
Interesting is right.

92
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:40,789
The Rojos boys, three
brothers who sell liquor.

93
00:11:40,873 --> 00:11:44,955
And then there's the Baxters,
big gun merchants.

94
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:50,164
If I'm not mistaken, you already
met Baxter's gang, didn't you?

95
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:51,913
Yeah, we met.

96
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:56,246
But you're lucky. They don't usually
limit their fire to the mule.

97
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,329
A man leaves his own land and
looks around for any reason,

98
00:11:59,412 --> 00:12:03,495
Juan de Dios tolls the bell and
Piripero sells another coffin.

99
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:05,037
Two bosses.

100
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:11,952
They've enlisted all the scum that hangs
around both sides of the frontier,

101
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:14,161
and they pay in dollars.

102
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,035
The Baxters over there.

103
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:21,535
The Rojos there.

104
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,035
Me right in the middle.

105
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,118
Where you do what?

106
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:29,743
Crazy bell ringer
was right.

107
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:32,326
There's money to be made
in a place like this.

108
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:36,908
If you're thinking what I suspect,
I tell you, don't try it.

109
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:40,450
Which one of the two
is the stronger?

110
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:43,490
Which one of them
is stronger?

111
00:12:43,574 --> 00:12:46,990
Well, the Rojos,
especially Ramon.

112
00:12:58,323 --> 00:13:02,072
Don Miguel Rojo,
I want to talk to you.

113
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:06,863
Don Miguel, I hear
you're hiring on men.

114
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:10,155
Well, I might
just be available.

115
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:14,654
I gotta tell you
before you hire me,

116
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,403
I don't work cheap.

117
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:36,735
Get three coffins ready.

118
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:07,023
Listen, stranger.
Didn't you get the idea?

119
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:09,481
We don't like to see bad
boys like you in town.

120
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,148
Go get your mule.

121
00:14:11,522 --> 00:14:14,647
You let him get away from you?

122
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,480
That's what I want to
talk to you about.

123
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:20,646
He's feeling real bad.

124
00:14:20,896 --> 00:14:22,438
My mule.

125
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:26,354
You see, he got all riled up when you
men fired those shots at his feet.

126
00:14:28,562 --> 00:14:31,729
Hey, are you making
some kind of joke?

127
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:33,186
Mmm-mmm. No.

128
00:14:34,186 --> 00:14:36,686
See, I understand you men
were just playing around.

129
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:39,436
But the mule...
He just doesn't get it.

130
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,728
Of course, if you were
to all apologize...

131
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,976
I don't think it's nice,
you laughing.

132
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:03,350
You see, my mule
don't like people laughing.

133
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,100
He gets the crazy idea
you're laughing at him.

134
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:09,850
Now, if you apologize,
like I know you're going to,

135
00:15:10,766 --> 00:15:14,224
I might convince him that
you really didn't mean it.

136
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:45,095
I saw the whole thing.
You killed all four of them.

137
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:49,553
You'll pay all right.
You'll be strung up.

138
00:15:51,845 --> 00:15:53,219
Who are you?

139
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:55,969
Don't fire a shot.

140
00:15:56,969 --> 00:16:00,136
I'm John Baxter, sheriff.

141
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:06,552
Yeah? Well, if you're the sheriff, you
better get these men underground.

142
00:16:19,883 --> 00:16:22,383
My mistake. Four coffins.

143
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:42,464
I told you I wasn't cheap,

144
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:44,922
but I think you'll find
it's worth your while.

145
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:47,714
...97,98,99, 100.

146
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:51,297
The rest
when you're all done.

147
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,546
When do I start?

148
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:56,629
I'm not in a hurry,
at least for the moment.

149
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:58,379
I'd say with
four less Baxters,

150
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:00,962
right now is as good a
time to start as any.

151
00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:05,128
In a few days I hear there will be a troop
of cavalry passing through San Miguel.

152
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:09,585
I wouldn't want the military sticking
their long noses into our business.

153
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:12,752
You seem to be
well-informed.

154
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:19,543
In these parts, a man's life often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

155
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:23,793
This thing couldn't have been
very useful to its owner.

156
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:30,458
My brother Ramon did that.
He often uses it for target practice.

157
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:34,583
With a gun in his hand,
no one stands in his way.

158
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:37,208
The suit of armor is
one of his favorite targets,

159
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:41,041
naturally, when he does not
have anything better to shoot.

160
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:45,374
Well, I'll be kind of curious
to meet this brother of yours.

161
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:47,415
Ah.

162
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:51,540
This is Chico,
one of the most trusted of my men.

163
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,956
Follow him.
He will bring you to your room.

164
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,580
I would like you
to feel at home.

165
00:17:57,664 --> 00:18:00,913
Well, I never found home
that great, but let's go.

166
00:18:19,203 --> 00:18:20,953
Who's that?

167
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:25,120
Her name's Marisol.
You just forget about her.

168
00:18:28,286 --> 00:18:30,452
This one will be your room.

169
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:03,115
You gave him $100.

170
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:04,156
Yes.

171
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,323
We never pay that much.

172
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,614
Can you explain to me
why you have taken him on?

173
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:12,197
To have that filthy gringo around the
house and to give him $100 besides?

174
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:15,406
We have never paid
anybody so much.

175
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,114
You cannot leave someone like that
to do what he wants around here.

176
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:22,821
He's capable of doing anything.
And I want law and order in this place.

177
00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:27,487
If that is all you want,
there is a much cheaper way.

178
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,737
Just snuff him out.

179
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:33,820
And who will be
the one? You?

180
00:19:33,903 --> 00:19:35,903
Yes, why not?

181
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:37,112
A shot in his back,

182
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:40,361
and then you would have him out
of the way in no time at all.

183
00:19:41,694 --> 00:19:45,443
Listen, I could do it
easily right now.

184
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:50,193
He won't be expecting it,
and I'd get back the 100.

185
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,192
You're stupid, Esteban!
Even if you are my brother!

186
00:19:57,401 --> 00:20:00,608
A bullet in the back, eh?
And it is ended!

187
00:20:00,692 --> 00:20:03,275
And what happens if your hand
should tremble slightly?

188
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:05,108
And he's only been hurt?

189
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:09,899
And with the cavalry arriving in town
and that Yankee so quick on the draw.

190
00:20:09,983 --> 00:20:10,983
I was
only thinking...

191
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:12,691
You mustn't
think of anything!

192
00:20:12,774 --> 00:20:14,857
You let me
do the thinking instead.

193
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,690
Go and see the americano.
Just ask him if he needs anything and make friends.

194
00:20:21,231 --> 00:20:23,356
Get one thing clear
in that head of yours.

195
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:26,814
This is going to be a quiet
town until Ramon gets back!

196
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:31,355
Is that clear?
A quiet town.

197
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:47,937
I am Esteban Rojo.
My brother asked me to...

198
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:54,727
What are you doing?

199
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:57,852
Moving.

200
00:20:57,936 --> 00:21:00,602
But didn't you know all our
men live here with us?

201
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:08,351
That's all very cozy, but I don't
find you men all that appealing.

202
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:12,892
Besides, your brother said he didn't
have any need for me any more right now.

203
00:21:36,473 --> 00:21:38,265
Halt!

204
00:21:40,223 --> 00:21:42,098
<i>Sergeant?
Yes, Capitan?</i>

205
00:21:43,514 --> 00:21:46,097
Tell the men we'll be spending
tonight here in this place.

206
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,264
Arrange it so they can
pick up the supplies here.

207
00:21:48,347 --> 00:21:50,846
Also, double the guard in order
to watch the stagecoach there.

208
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,596
Yes, sir.

209
00:21:53,346 --> 00:21:56,012
Now what do you suppose they're
carrying in that coach?

210
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,929
It'd be easy
to find out.

211
00:21:58,012 --> 00:22:00,470
Get up close to it and take a
little look at what's in it.

212
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:03,178
If they fire at you,
you know it's gold.

213
00:22:03,553 --> 00:22:05,095
Not a bad idea.

214
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:20,301
Mmm.

215
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,633
Looking for anything?

216
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:36,341
Hello.

217
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:37,841
Get out of here, Yankee.

218
00:22:52,422 --> 00:22:54,339
Why aren't you sleeping?

219
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:58,464
When I see you staring
like that, it bothers me.

220
00:22:58,922 --> 00:23:02,130
I still keep wondering
what was in that stagecoach.

221
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,338
It's something they seem to
think is very important.

222
00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:09,796
I asked a few questions of the
captain and almost was arrested.

223
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:12,671
Who's Marisol?

224
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:17,128
You better get some sleep.
You need it.

225
00:23:17,212 --> 00:23:19,670
It's much too dangerous,
even for you.

226
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:24,002
All I did is ask
who she was.

227
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:27,002
She is a woman.

228
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:29,502
And Ramon's madly
in love with her.

229
00:23:29,585 --> 00:23:31,627
Does that make it
clear to you?

230
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:37,417
Everybody in this town
talks about Ramon.

231
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:39,626
Kind of curious
to meet him.

232
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:44,251
If you are smart, you will try to stay
clear of Ramon as long as possible

233
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:54,832
There are the soldiers.
They are moving on very quietly.

234
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,457
Strange.

235
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,165
They're headed
for the frontier.

236
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:09,872
Tell me,

237
00:24:12,164 --> 00:24:14,413
is that the way
you go to bed every night?

238
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,538
Don't worry.
I didn't dirty the sheets.

239
00:24:19,996 --> 00:24:22,288
No, wait.
I'm coming, too.

240
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:25,871
I want to see for myself how you're
going to get yourself in trouble.

241
00:24:25,954 --> 00:24:27,995
All right. All right.
Go ahead.

242
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:15,782
It's like playing
cowboys and Indians.

243
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,615
Captain.
Welcome, Lieutenant.

244
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,281
There is your gold
as promised.

245
00:25:25,364 --> 00:25:28,947
I hope the guns you will be giving us
will be equally useful to our army.

246
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,405
Rest assured, Captain.
We'll check them over together.

247
00:27:06,144 --> 00:27:08,810
Get their clothes on again,
and hurry.

248
00:27:10,727 --> 00:27:12,393
Be sure to place them around right.

249
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:14,477
Remember. They died
fighting among themselves.

250
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:34,475
Rubio!

251
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:42,349
There. It's Ramon.

252
00:27:56,348 --> 00:27:58,931
This is my brother Ramon.

253
00:27:59,014 --> 00:28:01,055
I think
I mentioned him.

254
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,888
Everybody talks
about Ramon.

255
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:06,971
And many speak of you, too,
my dear brother included.

256
00:28:07,138 --> 00:28:10,721
Well, I hope
they say nice things.

257
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,970
Did you have a good trip?

258
00:28:14,387 --> 00:28:16,303
It was tiring.

259
00:28:16,386 --> 00:28:19,428
It was terribly hot
on the road during the day.

260
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:23,719
And stagecoaches are an
uncomfortable way to travel.

261
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,135
Well, I'm sure you'll be
in great shape in no time.

262
00:28:27,219 --> 00:28:30,718
The americano cannot
wait to get into action.

263
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:33,843
I am sorry. He's going
to be a disappointed man.

264
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,384
How's that?

265
00:28:35,468 --> 00:28:37,384
The Baxters accepted
the invitation.

266
00:28:37,468 --> 00:28:39,967
They'll come tonight,
Don Miguel.

267
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,550
The Baxters coming here?
You must be out of your head.

268
00:28:42,634 --> 00:28:45,634
Chico followed my orders.
I told him to invite them here.

269
00:28:45,717 --> 00:28:47,758
Ramon,
what is this?

270
00:28:49,175 --> 00:28:51,549
I have found out many things
when I was traveling,

271
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:55,049
and I have decided
that it's very stupid,

272
00:28:55,132 --> 00:28:59,216
to just keep on shooting at each
other and without any results.

273
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:01,715
You've gone out of
your mind, Ramon.

274
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:04,632
No, I have come
to my senses, Esteban.

275
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:07,089
Believe me.

276
00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:08,631
Trust me.

277
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,881
Life can be
so precious.

278
00:29:11,964 --> 00:29:16,214
It's foolish to risk losing
it every minute, no?

279
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,713
There's plenty of space
for everybody in this town.

280
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,796
Even Baxters.

281
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:25,129
For this reason,

282
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:29,170
I've decided to hang
my gun up on the wall.

283
00:29:29,795 --> 00:29:31,837
I think that Ramon
has the right idea.

284
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,794
I, too, am getting tired of these killings.
They must stop.

285
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:40,002
This is all
very, very touching.

286
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:42,544
You mean you don't admire peace?

287
00:29:42,628 --> 00:29:46,376
It's not real easy to like
something you know nothing about.

288
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:50,501
Stay in San Miguel and you may
just profit from the experience.

289
00:29:50,585 --> 00:29:53,751
No, thanks.
I'll be moving on.

290
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:02,583
Here's your money,
Don Miguel.

291
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:04,917
I only used
a small amount of it.

292
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,874
I don't like to take money
unless I feel I've earned it.

293
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:13,540
Now, why are you so hasty?
You should stay here.

294
00:30:13,624 --> 00:30:16,248
You might enjoy
dining with us tonight.

295
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:20,123
You see, the Baxters have four men
in the cemetery on account of me.

296
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:23,372
I don't think they'd
appreciate my presence.

297
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,330
I don't like that americano.
He's too smart to be just a hired fighter.

298
00:30:34,413 --> 00:30:36,038
At shooting a pistol
no one can touch him.

299
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:37,121
I can see that.

300
00:30:37,205 --> 00:30:41,120
When someone with that face works with
his gun, you may count on two things.

301
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:44,120
He's fast on the trigger,
but he's also intelligent.

302
00:30:44,204 --> 00:30:46,870
That makes him too dangerous
for you, I think, my brothers.

303
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:49,745
And now that he's gone, will you please
explain to me that silly nonsense

304
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:53,203
about hanging up your gun and
making up with the Baxters?

305
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:55,161
Is it possible,
old fellow,

306
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:59,036
that you'll never be able to reach
any conclusions on your own?

307
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:02,452
Don't you think our government and the
americanos will find those bodies,

308
00:31:02,535 --> 00:31:04,534
and then start
an invesfigafion?

309
00:31:04,618 --> 00:31:06,202
They'll investigate,
all right,

310
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:09,950
and we'll be quiet and
peacefully abide our time.

311
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:14,201
We know nothing about the
massacre at the Rio Bravo, eh?

312
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:16,533
I arranged for the bodies
to be lying,

313
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:19,408
as if both companies
killed each other.

314
00:31:19,908 --> 00:31:22,491
But do you think
they'll believe it?

315
00:31:22,574 --> 00:31:25,074
Yes, I think so.

316
00:31:25,158 --> 00:31:27,240
Because if they don't
find some guilty party,

317
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:30,656
it would be a pretty good reason
to call off the investigation.

318
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,448
Yes, but what
about the Baxters?

319
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:35,865
The Baxters?

320
00:31:36,615 --> 00:31:39,281
They want nothing more
than to live in peace.

321
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,780
We'll let them have
their own way for a while.

322
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:43,198
So forget
about the Baxters.

323
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,280
We'll take care of them later
when the investigation finishes.

324
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:56,487
That was a fine idea
that you had.

325
00:31:56,654 --> 00:31:58,487
What was it again?

326
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,320
Ah, yes, yes, Yes-

327
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,861
The Baxters on one side.
The Rojos on the other.

328
00:32:07,777 --> 00:32:09,903
And you'd be
in the middle.

329
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:13,319
The only problem is that
they've joined up.

330
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:19,818
Now you are without a job, and you don't
have money to pay me what you owe me.

331
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:23,359
There is only one thing for you to do.
Leave here immediately.

332
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:25,484
I will forget about
what you owe me.

333
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:29,358
And you leave San Miguel and never
come back for the rest of your days.

334
00:32:29,442 --> 00:32:33,358
Joe, I have prepared the wagon
the way you asked me to.

335
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:36,983
It's sitting out in the back
here with two empty coffins.

336
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:38,774
What are you up to?

337
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:41,149
Are you changing
your profession?

338
00:32:41,232 --> 00:32:43,607
If you want to go on
living, you'd better.

339
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:47,690
In my opinion, you'll
make a fine pallbearer.

340
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:51,481
Close this place
and come with me, huh?

341
00:32:51,565 --> 00:32:55,856
Oh, close up? It's done.
Where are we going?

342
00:32:55,981 --> 00:32:59,439
I'd like to know where we are
going, or is it a secret?

343
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:04,313
Down by the river.
Have a look at some corpses down there.

344
00:33:48,142 --> 00:33:50,974
The Rojos say, "Come to
dinner," and we must go.

345
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:53,600
But l don't
like it at all,

346
00:33:53,682 --> 00:33:57,016
even if they've granted all the
guarantees we've demanded.

347
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:02,348
We'll go along with it,
but don't touch anything.

348
00:34:02,432 --> 00:34:05,182
You mustn't eat.
You mustn't drink.

349
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:10,264
You just keep your eyes open
and keep your wits about you.

350
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:38,511
Are you sure that
nobody has seen us?

351
00:34:38,595 --> 00:34:40,677
Only a ghost or two.

352
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,510
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't joke about things like this.

353
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:46,427
Ghosts are better left
where they are.

354
00:34:47,676 --> 00:34:50,342
You look as though this
place suits you very well.

355
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:53,634
And if you go on like this, you
will soon be here permanently.

356
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:07,674
I do not understand.

357
00:35:07,757 --> 00:35:11,841
Why is it with all those bodies down by
the river we are just burying these two?

358
00:35:11,924 --> 00:35:14,215
We're not.
We're not gonna bury them.

359
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:16,506
What do you mean
we're not burying them?

360
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,298
That's right.
We're not gonna bury them.

361
00:35:20,673 --> 00:35:21,922
If we are not going to
bury them,

362
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:25,089
I would like to know
what we will use them for?

363
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,255
Why are we taking
the trouble to do this?

364
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:31,338
The dead can be
very useful sometimes.

365
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:38,045
They've helped me out of
tough spots more than once.

366
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:46,336
First, they don't talk.

367
00:35:48,086 --> 00:35:51,752
Second, they can be made to look
alive if I manage it right.

368
00:35:54,044 --> 00:35:55,669
And, third...

369
00:35:57,335 --> 00:35:59,626
Well, third, if you shoot
them, there's no worry,

370
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,710
'cause they're dead already.

371
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:03,085
Understand?

372
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:06,418
It doesn't make a bit of sense
to me, and I'm getting out.

373
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:08,625
I'm alive, and I want to remain
with the living, understand?

374
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:10,584
And when I'm dead, I'll want
to remain with the dead.

375
00:36:10,667 --> 00:36:13,375
I would be unhappy if somebody living
forces me to remain with the living.

376
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:15,584
I hope that's clear.

377
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:20,041
And, also, I don't like the idea that
you've placed those bodies there!

378
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,332
The man we buried
in that grave

379
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:24,499
is the only one who ever died of
pneumonia in this cursed town!

380
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,166
Take it easy now,
will you?

381
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:29,999
These two friends of ours here
are gonna help me pay your bill.

382
00:36:30,082 --> 00:36:32,331
Get up there!

383
00:36:59,745 --> 00:37:02,328
The only reason they could
have to start a war with us,

384
00:37:02,412 --> 00:37:05,494
would be to kidnap you
from your husband's side.

385
00:37:06,703 --> 00:37:08,661
He's gallant, this Rojo.

386
00:37:08,786 --> 00:37:11,660
I really didn't think him
capable of compliments.

387
00:37:11,743 --> 00:37:16,493
And he's not. All that he says
is false, like his proposals.

388
00:37:16,577 --> 00:37:21,034
You women. If things aren't complicated
for you, you become suspicious.

389
00:37:21,576 --> 00:37:25,450
Yes, because to me, it
just didn't seem right.

390
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,908
It went too smoothly.
I don't trust them.

391
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:31,575
You'd like to prove me
wrong, wouldn't you?

392
00:37:31,658 --> 00:37:33,575
Always the same thing.

393
00:37:35,575 --> 00:37:38,199
Good night.

394
00:38:16,237 --> 00:38:19,278
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

395
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:23,902
I just want you to know why the Rojos
want to make peace all of a sudden.

396
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,986
You see, there was once
a wagon load of gold

397
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:29,569
that the soldiers were
taking to the border.

398
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,526
John, come up here quickly.

399
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:51,400
Sorry, but when a husband finds
a man in his wife's bedroom,

400
00:38:51,482 --> 00:38:54,108
you're never sure
how he's gonna react.

401
00:38:56,982 --> 00:38:58,190
Give him $500.

402
00:38:58,274 --> 00:38:59,315
How's that?

403
00:38:59,399 --> 00:39:01,815
Give the money to him.

404
00:39:02,065 --> 00:39:04,815
He has an interesting story.
Listen to him.

405
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:07,814
That's the right idea?
You didn't misunderstand?

406
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:09,814
I get the wrong idea
only when it suits me.

407
00:39:09,897 --> 00:39:11,064
- Ramon.
- What is it?

408
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,981
The soldiers, the ones who
were escorting the gold...

409
00:39:13,063 --> 00:39:15,813
Two of those soldiers got away.
They are hiding out in the cemetery.

410
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:18,980
The Baxters.
They're about to capture them.

411
00:39:21,312 --> 00:39:23,104
Rubio! Get the men!

412
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:27,812
You are well-informed, eh?

413
00:39:27,895 --> 00:39:31,978
A man's life in these parts often
depends on a mere scrap of information.

414
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:34,186
Your brother's
own words.

415
00:39:34,395 --> 00:39:36,894
Tell me. Why are you
doing this for us?

416
00:39:40,435 --> 00:39:41,893
$500.

417
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:52,393
With these two soldiers
as witnesses against Ramon,

418
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:56,143
the government will be able to rid the
town of the Rojos and their whole band.

419
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:58,892
Then San Miguel
will have just one boss.

420
00:39:58,975 --> 00:40:00,183
Hurry!

421
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,890
Let's go!

422
00:40:20,265 --> 00:40:21,514
Coming with us?

423
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:23,639
Oh, no. When a man's got
money in his pocket,

424
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,889
he begins to
appreciate peace.

425
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:28,264
Come on!

426
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:39,797
Let's leave the horses here.

427
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:04,253
Who's there? Come out!

428
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:28,126
What do you think?

429
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:29,625
I don't know.

430
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:32,500
There's something
about it I don't like.

431
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:35,624
Too still to be wounded.
More like dummies.

432
00:42:35,707 --> 00:42:37,707
Sure, dummies that are very
interesting to the Rojos.

433
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:39,707
Better hide. Hurry.

434
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:55,818
What'll we do?

435
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,067
Take two men and circle
around to the side.

436
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,399
Try to keep them busy long enough
for me to get those two down there.

437
00:45:01,483 --> 00:45:03,942
Go on. Go on. Quickly.

438
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,187
Keep me covered.
I am going to take care of those two.

439
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:25,015
Listen, Baxter!
You can have them now if you like!

440
00:46:25,432 --> 00:46:28,182
Since dead men
can't talk!

441
00:46:39,514 --> 00:46:42,430
It seems they didn't
like my joke.

442
00:46:42,514 --> 00:46:45,679
We'll let them go home
in a little while.

443
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:30,752
Keep this bad boy
as our guest,

444
00:48:30,835 --> 00:48:33,834
only until Baxter leaves San
Miguel and heads for the frontier.

445
00:48:33,918 --> 00:48:35,709
Put him in the cellar.

446
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:44,084
Esteban, good work.

447
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:48,291
With Antonio as our prisoner, the Baxters
are going to have to give in to us.

448
00:48:48,374 --> 00:48:50,083
Now we can make
any kind of demand.

449
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:52,333
Don Miguel!
Don Miguel!

450
00:48:57,665 --> 00:49:00,123
What has happened?
Talk, will you?

451
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:02,831
I don't know, but
somebody shot at me.

452
00:49:02,915 --> 00:49:04,456
Marisol!

453
00:49:05,956 --> 00:49:07,164
Marisol!

454
00:49:07,748 --> 00:49:09,997
Where are you, Marisol?

455
00:49:23,245 --> 00:49:26,245
It's strange how you
always manage to be

456
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:28,329
in the right place
at the right time.

457
00:49:35,328 --> 00:49:40,119
It's nothing serious.
A headache that will pass. She'll sleep.

458
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:49,242
Keep your eyes open.
She's not to move from that room. You hear?

459
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,742
I wouldn't mention anything
about me bringing her here.

460
00:49:58,825 --> 00:50:01,824
I wouldn't want the Rojos
to think I was on your side.

461
00:50:02,075 --> 00:50:03,657
Don't be worried.

462
00:50:03,824 --> 00:50:08,908
I'm a woman who's rich enough to
appreciate the men that my money can buy.

463
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,907
I've been to talk
to the Rojos.

464
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,199
They'll give back Antonio
in exchange for Marisol.

465
00:50:13,282 --> 00:50:15,364
It'll take place
in the morning.

466
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:21,281
Very soon you are
going to be rich.

467
00:50:26,822 --> 00:50:30,405
Yeah, and that's not
gonna break my heart.

468
00:52:13,435 --> 00:52:16,560
Where is she?
You said I'd be able to see her!

469
00:52:16,643 --> 00:52:18,143
Where is she?

470
00:52:19,476 --> 00:52:21,517
I wanna see her!

471
00:52:21,601 --> 00:52:22,893
Come back here, Jesus.
Come here.

472
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,059
Where is she?

473
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:26,517
I want to see her!
I want to see her!

474
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:30,433
Why can't I look at her?
I want to see her!

475
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:51,847
Go. Go to him, Marisol.

476
00:53:16,595 --> 00:53:17,803
Mama!

477
00:53:20,886 --> 00:53:22,386
Mama!

478
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:23,635
Jesus!

479
00:53:30,469 --> 00:53:31,760
Mama!

480
00:53:34,259 --> 00:53:35,301
Jesus!

481
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:37,301
Mama!Mama!

482
00:54:27,628 --> 00:54:28,754
Julio!

483
00:54:29,961 --> 00:54:31,170
Marisol.

484
00:54:33,128 --> 00:54:34,627
Get Julio.

485
00:54:45,002 --> 00:54:47,460
You were warned
to get out of town.

486
00:54:47,959 --> 00:54:51,084
Now I'm gonna make you
pay once and for all.

487
00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:54,959
Let him be.

488
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:36,329
You better get going.
Ramon's waiting.

489
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,203
And, you, get that kid
home where he belongs.

490
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,656
A pig, that Ramon.

491
00:56:33,865 --> 00:56:36,573
Tell me, what's Ramon
got to do with them?

492
00:56:36,656 --> 00:56:38,780
You weren't told, eh?

493
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:43,363
In this part of the world,
the story is very old.

494
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:46,321
A happy little family
until trouble comes along.

495
00:56:46,405 --> 00:56:48,321
And trouble has
the name of Ramon.

496
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,030
Claiming the husband cheated
at cards, which wasn't true,

497
00:56:51,113 --> 00:56:54,571
he gets the wife to live
with him as hostage.

498
00:56:54,654 --> 00:56:56,279
And the husband?

499
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:59,236
Him? There's nothing
for him to do.

500
00:56:59,528 --> 00:57:01,903
The Rojos threatened to
kill his little boy Jesus,

501
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:04,652
and he was forced
to accept things.

502
00:57:07,153 --> 00:57:09,235
That Ramon is smart.

503
00:57:11,193 --> 00:57:13,110
Where are you going?

504
00:57:16,651 --> 00:57:19,609
To the Rojos
to look for a job.

505
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,692
I am glad we have
the americano with us.

506
00:57:27,775 --> 00:57:30,525
It's the best thing that could
have happened to us, you know,

507
00:57:30,608 --> 00:57:33,566
'cause if either government
starts an inquiry,

508
00:57:33,649 --> 00:57:35,649
we'll need every man
we can get.

509
00:57:37,107 --> 00:57:40,690
I guess you know to be at
war with the Baxters now,

510
00:57:40,773 --> 00:57:42,606
is worse than sitting
on a big case of dynamite.

511
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,982
Where should
we put this?

512
00:57:44,065 --> 00:57:45,940
Put it over there.

513
00:57:53,439 --> 00:57:55,897
Come on, everybody!
Drink up!

514
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:29,977
Good shooting.
Very good shooting.

515
00:58:30,143 --> 00:58:32,351
When you want to kill a man,
you must shoot for his heart.

516
00:58:32,435 --> 00:58:35,226
And the Winchester
is the best weapon.

517
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:38,767
That's very nice, but
I'll stick with my .45.

518
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,434
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

519
00:58:42,517 --> 00:58:45,433
the man with the pistol
will be a dead man.

520
00:58:46,225 --> 00:58:49,182
That's an old Mexican
proverb, and it's true.

521
00:58:50,766 --> 00:58:52,682
You believe that?

522
00:58:54,141 --> 00:58:57,223
Paquito, take five men and escort
Marisol to the small house.

523
00:58:57,306 --> 00:58:59,515
And stay there
till I return.

524
00:59:08,472 --> 00:59:09,556
Everything's
prepared.

525
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:11,305
Do not be worried.

526
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,930
I will return tomorrow.

527
00:59:14,014 --> 00:59:15,680
All the wagons are ready.
We can leave.

528
00:59:15,763 --> 00:59:19,679
Everyone, enjoy yourselves
during my absence.

529
00:59:37,386 --> 00:59:39,927
You heard Ramon.
Let's have a good time.

530
00:59:48,343 --> 00:59:51,759
<i>Do you remember
sweet Becky from Pike</i>

531
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:55,426
<i>She roamed the world
with her lover Ike</i>

532
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,134
<i>Ike and Betsy</i>

533
00:59:58,425 --> 01:00:00,216
<i>Betsy from Pike...</i>

534
01:00:03,841 --> 01:00:05,757
He weighs over a ton.
Of course,

535
01:00:05,841 --> 01:00:08,008
with all he poured
into himself.

536
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:26,707
Papa,

537
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:31,248
did you not tell me
no one could go see Mama?

538
01:01:32,373 --> 01:01:33,831
That's right.

539
01:01:34,331 --> 01:01:37,372
Then why does that man
see her when I cannot?

540
01:01:40,497 --> 01:01:41,497
I want Mama.

541
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,330
Go away
from the door.

542
01:01:43,414 --> 01:01:46,371
Quiet! Quiet.
We cannot show ourselves.

543
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:48,621
You must remember that.
You must stay away.

544
01:01:59,828 --> 01:02:01,412
Hello.

545
01:02:21,326 --> 01:02:23,283
There's somebody shooting
up at the small house.

546
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:26,617
Saddle the horses immediately!
Come on. Let's go!

547
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,571
Look out!

548
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,441
Here you are.
Now, take this money.

549
01:03:46,525 --> 01:03:49,732
It's enough to live on for a while.
Now, get across the border.

550
01:03:49,816 --> 01:03:52,482
Get as much distance between
yourselves and San Miguel as possible.

551
01:03:52,565 --> 01:03:55,440
How may we thank you
for what you are doing?

552
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:58,731
Don't try. Just get going
before the Rojos get here.

553
01:04:03,022 --> 01:04:04,939
Why do you do this for us?

554
01:04:06,398 --> 01:04:09,438
Why? 'Cause I knew
someone like you once.

555
01:04:09,522 --> 01:04:12,605
There was no one there
to help. Now, get moving.

556
01:04:14,896 --> 01:04:16,313
Get moving.

557
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,729
Get out of here!

558
01:05:01,891 --> 01:05:04,182
What do you see, Chico?

559
01:05:04,265 --> 01:05:07,683
They're all dead.
They massacred them.

560
01:05:07,766 --> 01:05:09,224
They kidnapped Marisol!

561
01:05:09,307 --> 01:05:11,473
This looks like the work of the Baxters.

562
01:05:11,556 --> 01:05:15,139
Quick, let's get back before
they attack our house and the town.

563
01:07:09,919 --> 01:07:12,585
Chico, give out the ammunition.

564
01:07:12,669 --> 01:07:16,542
Esteban, spread your men around the house.
Keep your eyes open.

565
01:07:16,626 --> 01:07:19,668
Miguel, Paco, Vincente,
Martin, behind the house.

566
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:23,626
Manolo and Alvaro,
come with me. Stay alert.

567
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:27,209
The way they killed the men in the small
house, there must be a lot of them.

568
01:07:35,332 --> 01:07:37,248
It's a warm evening.

569
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:45,207
One of our wagons lost a wheel, so we
had to turn back here to get help.

570
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,331
One of the men tells me,

571
01:07:50,206 --> 01:07:52,830
the Baxters
attacked the small house.

572
01:07:54,705 --> 01:07:56,622
Do you know about it?

573
01:08:00,038 --> 01:08:02,205
Tell me what you know.

574
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:23,202
Well?

575
01:08:24,702 --> 01:08:26,618
Where did you hide Marisol?

576
01:08:29,326 --> 01:08:30,493
Rubio.

577
01:08:56,406 --> 01:08:59,114
You are thirsty.
You want to drink?

578
01:08:59,698 --> 01:09:02,531
No, no,
it is too soon to drink.

579
01:09:06,364 --> 01:09:08,322
Bring him over here!

580
01:09:37,027 --> 01:09:38,652
You are behaving
like a stubborn idiot.

581
01:09:38,735 --> 01:09:41,277
Tell us where Marisol is,
and it will all be ended!

582
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,610
In a week,
you'll be back in shape.

583
01:09:42,693 --> 01:09:45,526
You'll get out and you can
go wherever you want.

584
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,025
That's enough for today.

585
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:02,982
Sooner or later, he'll talk.
It's just a matter of time.

586
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:07,440
Watch out he doesn't escape or die.
Otherwise, do as you like.

587
01:10:11,023 --> 01:10:14,648
But wait till he comes to.
This way, he hardly feels anything.

588
01:10:47,227 --> 01:10:49,645
I've had a poker hand waiting
for me for three days.

589
01:10:49,727 --> 01:10:53,061
Now I'm stuck here! I can't get to it
while I'm guarding this americano idiot!

590
01:10:53,144 --> 01:10:55,310
I think you will find this
more amusing than cards.

591
01:10:55,393 --> 01:10:57,727
All orders are to be sure
he does not die,

592
01:10:57,809 --> 01:11:01,268
and also make sure he regrets
the day he was born.

593
01:11:03,018 --> 01:11:05,601
The gringo is asleep,
I imagine.

594
01:11:05,684 --> 01:11:08,517
That's all right.
I'll enjoy waking him up.

595
01:12:12,344 --> 01:12:14,426
Esteban, what was that noise?

596
01:12:14,509 --> 01:12:15,843
I do not know.

597
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:18,009
I heard a yell,
and then a crash.

598
01:12:50,089 --> 01:12:52,006
It's useless to hide.

599
01:12:54,255 --> 01:12:56,172
You're finished playing
the smart boy.

600
01:12:58,088 --> 01:13:00,005
Go up and look in the loft.

601
01:13:01,504 --> 01:13:03,962
And take a look
behind the barrels!

602
01:13:15,544 --> 01:13:17,502
Let's get out of here!

603
01:13:27,335 --> 01:13:29,710
Hurry! Quick!

604
01:13:29,793 --> 01:13:33,168
Hurry with that water!
Hey, you, come with me!

605
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:51,582
Surround the town!
Block all the streets leading out!

606
01:13:51,665 --> 01:13:53,624
Find him for me!

607
01:13:54,999 --> 01:13:56,749
Esteban, search
the whole town.

608
01:13:56,831 --> 01:13:58,081
Follow me!

609
01:13:59,457 --> 01:14:02,915
Get him back right now!
You've got to at any cost!

610
01:14:02,998 --> 01:14:06,788
Look in the stables, in every
corral, in the storeroom!

611
01:14:06,872 --> 01:14:08,538
Look for him in the church!

612
01:14:08,914 --> 01:14:11,455
Go in there!
Search every inch of it!

613
01:14:11,538 --> 01:14:14,913
Search everywhere!
Rubio, in here!

614
01:14:15,746 --> 01:14:18,579
If somebody is hiding him,
burn their house down,

615
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:20,662
and kill them like dogs!

616
01:14:20,871 --> 01:14:22,329
You, up here!

617
01:14:22,995 --> 01:14:26,870
Look for him near the Baxters, but
take him alive! I want him alive!

618
01:14:26,953 --> 01:14:28,536
Alive!

619
01:14:30,078 --> 01:14:32,328
Rubio, in the bar.

620
01:15:02,908 --> 01:15:06,365
He says he knows nothing.
He's trying to be smart.

621
01:15:06,449 --> 01:15:08,365
Bring him here to me.

622
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:12,282
I swear I'm telling the truth.

623
01:15:12,365 --> 01:15:14,990
Well, you know nothing, huh?

624
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:17,740
I've not seen him.

625
01:15:17,822 --> 01:15:19,906
Rubio, you take care of him.

626
01:16:01,401 --> 01:16:03,318
Where have you hidden him?

627
01:16:04,817 --> 01:16:07,109
I didn't...

628
01:16:11,983 --> 01:16:15,317
You're the right friend
for that filthy americano.

629
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:17,316
And you'll end up
the same way.

630
01:16:18,357 --> 01:16:20,274
We looked everywhere.

631
01:16:20,357 --> 01:16:23,065
In his cellar, in the
attic, on the roof.

632
01:16:23,149 --> 01:16:25,273
But there is no trace.

633
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:27,398
I couldn't find anybody
there in the back room.

634
01:16:27,481 --> 01:16:30,565
I'm certain he has taken
refuge with the Baxters.

635
01:16:30,648 --> 01:16:31,939
The americano
isn't stupid.

636
01:16:32,023 --> 01:16:35,314
He knows that that's the
best place for him to hide.

637
01:16:37,397 --> 01:16:39,314
The Baxters, eh?

638
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,563
Then better go
and get him.

639
01:16:46,605 --> 01:16:48,521
And that's for
being his friend.

640
01:17:22,975 --> 01:17:24,559
Curse them.

641
01:17:32,349 --> 01:17:33,600
Eh?

642
01:17:40,682 --> 01:17:42,140
Piripero.

643
01:17:53,722 --> 01:17:54,722
Come here.

644
01:17:54,805 --> 01:17:56,430
I can't see anybody.

645
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,263
Come here.

646
01:18:08,345 --> 01:18:10,887
What are you doing
in there?

647
01:18:11,595 --> 01:18:13,803
Never mind.
Get me out of here.

648
01:18:14,177 --> 01:18:16,469
But you're not dead yet.

649
01:18:16,553 --> 01:18:20,677
I will be if you don't get me out of here, quick.
Get that lid down.

650
01:19:47,501 --> 01:19:48,501
Rubio.

651
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:12,790
I see some signs of life.

652
01:20:13,456 --> 01:20:16,039
Let's be ready when they
decide to come out.

653
01:20:20,163 --> 01:20:22,455
Don't shoot!
We surrender!

654
01:20:22,664 --> 01:20:23,664
Don't shoot!

655
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:29,038
Stop! Don't shoot!
We're coming out!

656
01:20:32,037 --> 01:20:34,413
I'm surrendering!
Hold back your fire!

657
01:20:34,495 --> 01:20:35,579
Don't shoot!

658
01:20:35,662 --> 01:20:38,287
We're surrendering!

659
01:21:06,492 --> 01:21:07,825
Stop.

660
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,616
I wanna take a look at this.

661
01:22:46,772 --> 01:22:50,689
Ramon, don't shoot!
We're coming out!

662
01:22:54,272 --> 01:22:55,980
We surrender!

663
01:22:56,063 --> 01:22:58,980
Listen, you've won.
It's enough!

664
01:22:59,063 --> 01:23:01,396
I'll get out of town!
I'll do whatever you like!

665
01:23:01,479 --> 01:23:02,521
You promise that?

666
01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:04,479
I swear it, Ramon!

667
01:23:04,937 --> 01:23:06,937
You won't try a trick
of any kind?

668
01:23:07,187 --> 01:23:09,728
None! No, no tricks!

669
01:23:09,812 --> 01:23:12,103
I said before, I give you my word.
We'll leave!

670
01:23:12,186 --> 01:23:15,853
Are you sure? You had better
ask permission of your wife.

671
01:23:17,686 --> 01:23:20,310
Maybe she won't
be too happy!

672
01:23:33,434 --> 01:23:34,393
Antonio!

673
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:37,101
John!

674
01:24:02,014 --> 01:24:03,597
Murderers.

675
01:24:05,222 --> 01:24:07,847
They had no guns.

676
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:10,763
Murderers!
I hope you rot in hell!

677
01:24:10,847 --> 01:24:14,805
May you and your brothers die spitting blood!
Curse you for this!

678
01:24:15,304 --> 01:24:17,096
Murderers!

679
01:24:39,718 --> 01:24:42,218
Let's go.
The show's over, anyway.

680
01:24:46,592 --> 01:24:49,843
Keep looking for him.
Search among those bodies.

681
01:24:50,509 --> 01:24:52,634
The filthy americano
has to be somewhere!

682
01:27:11,827 --> 01:27:12,827
Silvanito?

683
01:27:17,992 --> 01:27:19,992
Where's Silvanito?

684
01:27:23,242 --> 01:27:24,783
Any news today?

685
01:27:24,866 --> 01:27:27,699
I have to tell you some
news that's pretty bad.

686
01:27:27,783 --> 01:27:29,491
I hate to tell you
this, Joe,butâ€œ

687
01:27:29,574 --> 01:27:31,324
Where is Silvanito?

688
01:27:32,658 --> 01:27:36,740
Silvanito, he was captured this
morning by those men of Ramon's.

689
01:27:36,907 --> 01:27:39,949
They grabbed him outside the village.
He was on his way to this mine.

690
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:43,031
He was bringing in some provisions.
Ramon's got him now.

691
01:27:43,114 --> 01:27:45,114
He's being tortured,
but he won't talk.

692
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:47,156
I know him well.
He's a stubborn man.

693
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:51,239
No matter what they do to him, he won't
say a word, even if it means his life.

694
01:27:51,322 --> 01:27:54,405
Listen to me.
They'll never be able to force him.

695
01:28:05,695 --> 01:28:08,861
Now, old fool,
loosen up your tongue.

696
01:28:12,278 --> 01:28:14,237
O
Rubio!

697
01:28:16,778 --> 01:28:19,152
You better get back
to your shop, old man.

698
01:28:19,277 --> 01:28:20,652
You're liable to
have some business.

699
01:28:20,735 --> 01:28:22,152
Very good!

700
01:28:22,236 --> 01:28:24,151
That's what
I wanted to hear.

701
01:28:24,235 --> 01:28:27,485
And I have a little surprise
for you that I brought along.

702
01:28:27,568 --> 01:28:29,235
I know how much you
are going to need it.

703
01:28:29,318 --> 01:28:31,151
It was very hard
to get my hands on it.

704
01:28:31,235 --> 01:28:35,734
But I got it by first using my head.
No one can resist two barrels of wine.

705
01:28:35,818 --> 01:28:38,400
Isn't that right?
Then I thought that,

706
01:28:38,484 --> 01:28:42,316
well, you might need that pistol,
and I brought another present.

707
01:28:43,982 --> 01:28:47,899
It's dynamite.
I stole it from the Rojos.

708
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:49,607
And now it seems to me

709
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:52,565
the moment's come for
you to light the fuse

710
01:28:52,649 --> 01:28:54,649
and send it
back to them.

711
01:29:14,021 --> 01:29:15,938
Still lots of light.

712
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:22,354
Too early
to be asleep, yet.

713
01:29:26,228 --> 01:29:27,812
Rubio, here.

714
01:29:33,353 --> 01:29:37,685
I shouldn't like to ruin the rifle.
I could never find another like this.

715
01:29:39,185 --> 01:29:41,518
Listen, Ramon, let's try
it with this one now.

716
01:31:47,004 --> 01:31:48,213
Gringo!

717
01:31:55,462 --> 01:31:57,878
Heard you wanted
to see me.

718
01:31:58,753 --> 01:32:01,085
<i>The americano's dead.</i>

719
01:32:02,377 --> 01:32:04,336
Let the old man down.

720
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:24,792
What's wrong, Ramon?

721
01:32:25,374 --> 01:32:27,333
You losing your touch?

722
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:36,957
Are you afraid, Ramon?

723
01:32:40,748 --> 01:32:44,123
You shoot to kill,
you better hit the heart.

724
01:32:45,164 --> 01:32:46,997
Your own words, Ramon.

725
01:33:03,537 --> 01:33:05,370
The heart, Ramon.

726
01:33:05,704 --> 01:33:07,620
Don't forget the heart.

727
01:33:10,703 --> 01:33:13,536
Aim for the heart
or you'll never stop me.

728
01:34:50,026 --> 01:34:53,525
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

729
01:34:54,025 --> 01:34:56,441
you said the man with the
pistol's a dead man.

730
01:34:57,649 --> 01:35:00,232
Let's see if that's true.

731
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:26,022
Go ahead, load up and shoot.

732
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:33,466
Hey, listen, Joe.

733
01:37:33,549 --> 01:37:36,382
Listen, Joe, I...

734
01:37:38,132 --> 01:37:40,256
Oh, Joe, Joe.

735
01:38:12,669 --> 01:38:16,878
Well, guess your government will
be glad to see that gold back.

736
01:38:16,961 --> 01:38:21,335
And you, you don't want to be
here when they get it, eh?

737
01:38:23,002 --> 01:38:26,043
You mean, the Mexican
government on one side,

738
01:38:26,126 --> 01:38:28,668
and maybe the Americans
on the other side?

739
01:38:28,752 --> 01:38:31,584
Me, right smack
in the middle?

740
01:38:31,667 --> 01:38:33,542
Mmm-mmm.
Too dangerous.

741
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:36,751
So long..

742
01:38:41,069 --> 01:39:02,193
