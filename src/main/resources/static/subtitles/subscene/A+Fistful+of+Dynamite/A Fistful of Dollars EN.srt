1
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:34,383
You? You again? Get out!

2
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,342
Go on, I told you. Get out!

3
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:50,342
Go on! Go on!

4
00:03:58,758 --> 00:04:00,717
Papa!

5
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:07,133
You filthy dog! You settle with me!

6
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:13,508
Ha...

7
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:30,425
Let's go.

8
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:33,091
Welcome to you, señor.
My name is Juan de Dios.

9
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:35,258
I am the bell-ringer.

10
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:40,091
Why are you here?
To see the Rojos? No, not the Rojos.

11
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:43,258
Is it the Baxters? No, maybe not.

12
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,258
You want to get rich?
Well, it's the right place.

13
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:48,466
If you use your head.

14
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:52,550
That's because everybody here
has become very rich,

15
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:54,675
or else they are dead.

16
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:57,841
What do you want to buy?
Some guns? Liquor?

17
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,550
You don't buy, you sell.
You sell lead in exchange for gold?

18
00:07:01,841 --> 00:07:04,341
You will get rich here. Or you'll be killed.

19
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,925
Juan de Dios tolls the bell once again.

20
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:28,841
Saludos, amigo. It's not smart
to go wandering so far from home.

21
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,633
I reckon he picked the wrong trail.

22
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:38,508
- Or he could have picked the wrong town.
- His big mistake was getting born.

23
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,925
You want any work,

24
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:44,508
Iookin' like that,
ya could try bein' a scarecrow!

25
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:47,800
Oh, no! The crows are liable
to scare him maybe.

26
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:54,591
Ha-ha!

27
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:07,300
Hello.

28
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:09,675
Saludos.

29
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:20,050
You can't get rich like that!

30
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:24,175
At most, you will only succeed
in being killed!

31
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,550
We have enough trouble.
What are you looking for?

32
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:33,966
Food, somethin' to drink.

33
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:37,549
- Water's over there.
- No. No water.

34
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:39,632
Eating, drinking, killing.

35
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:42,966
That's all you can do,
just like the rest of your kind.

36
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:47,257
By the way, you'll have to mark this up.

37
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:52,132
I know, you have no money.
After all, you just got into town.

38
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:58,049
But if you don't mind killing,
you will find someone eager to pay you.

39
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:05,507
Hm-mm. My roulette wheel.

40
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:10,424
That, too, was murdered.
No-one ever comes here to play.

41
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,799
We spend our time
between funerals and burials.

42
00:09:14,007 --> 00:09:16,716
Yeah. Never saw a town
as dead as this one.

43
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:23,216
You will never see another like it.

44
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:26,882
- What's wrong with the place?
- We've had too many killings.

45
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,882
You have seen the women?
None of them are women, they're widows.

46
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:33,007
The place has only widows.

47
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:38,299
Here, you can only gain respect
by killing other men. So nobody works.

48
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:45,091
- Somebody doesn't share your opinion.
- Yes.

49
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:50,966
Saludos!

50
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:57,966
You know why Piripero looked you over?
To take your measurements.

51
00:09:58,466 --> 00:10:02,466
He can do it with a glance.
You will be a customer.

52
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:03,882
Hm.

53
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:09,257
I'm not joking. Those murderers
will make a corpse out of you one day.

54
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:12,049
That's why I want you to get out of here.

55
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:17,257
You don't want to stay in this cemetery,
finish up and get out.

56
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:22,049
I told ya I can't pay ya.

57
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:24,424
Be my guest.

58
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,257
But get out of San Miguel, will you?

59
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:33,632
- Where does that lead?
- The balcony.

60
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,632
Why are you going there?

61
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:38,716
Hey!

62
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:42,716
To have a look. Things always
look different from higher up.

63
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:46,799
But nothing's up there!
Go ahead and get out!

64
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,716
- Who are they?
- Hm. Bandits.

65
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,091
Bandits and smugglers.

66
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:06,299
They come down from Texas
to stock up on guns and liquor.

67
00:11:06,716 --> 00:11:11,174
The cost is much less here.
They sell guns and liquor to the lndians.

68
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:16,507
Any town that sells guns and liquor
has gotta be rich.

69
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:19,674
Not the town.
Only those who buy and sell.

70
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:22,382
The bosses are the ones who clean up.

71
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:25,799
Somebody has to run the place.
Every town has a boss.

72
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:30,966
That's true, but when there are two,
I'd say that there is one too many.

73
00:11:31,382 --> 00:11:33,091
Two bosses?

74
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:35,382
Very interesting.

75
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:40,257
Interesting is right. The Rojos,
three brothers who sell liquor.

76
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:44,966
And then there's the Baxters,
big gun merchants.

77
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:49,674
Ah, if I'm not mistaken,
you already met Baxter's gang.

78
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:51,549
Yeah, we met.

79
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:55,841
But you're lucky. They don't usually
limit their fire to the mule.

80
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,841
A man looks around for any reason,

81
00:11:58,757 --> 00:12:02,632
Juan de Dios tolls the bell,
Piripero sells another coffin.

82
00:12:02,507 --> 00:12:04,424
Two bosses.

83
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:10,507
They've enlisted all the scum
from both sides of the frontier.

84
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,799
And they pay in dollars.

85
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,924
Baxters over there.

86
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:20,299
Rojos there.

87
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,591
Me right in the middle.

88
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:24,799
Where you do what?

89
00:12:26,091 --> 00:12:28,091
Crazy bell-ringer was right.

90
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:31,091
There's money to be made
in a place like this.

91
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:36,382
If you're thinking what I suspect -
I tell you, don't try it.

92
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,299
Which one of the two is the stronger?

93
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:42,299
Which one of them is stronger?

94
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:45,299
Well, the Rojos, especially Ramon.

95
00:12:57,174 --> 00:13:01,049
Don Miguel Rojo, I wanna talk to you.

96
00:13:02,174 --> 00:13:05,841
Don Miguel, I hear you're hirin' on men.

97
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:09,174
Well, I might just be available.

98
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,841
I gotta tell ya before you hire me,

99
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:18,257
I don't work cheap.

100
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:37,507
- Get three coffins ready.
- Huh?

101
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,299
Adios, amigo.

102
00:14:03,591 --> 00:14:08,174
Stranger, didn't you get the idea?
We don't like bad boys like you in town.

103
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:13,174
Go get your mule.
You let him get away from you?

104
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:16,882
That's what I wanna talk about.
He's feelin' real bad.

105
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:19,382
Huh?

106
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:24,382
My mule. You see, he got all riled up
when you fired those shots at his feet.

107
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:32,257
- Hey, are you makin' some kinda joke?
- No.

108
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:38,049
I understand you were playin' around.
But the mule, he just doesn't get it.

109
00:14:38,466 --> 00:14:40,341
If you were to all apologise...

110
00:14:52,257 --> 00:14:54,632
I don't think it's nice, you laughin'.

111
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:02,632
See, my mule don't like people laughin'.

112
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,549
He gets the idea you're laughin' at him.

113
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:08,424
Now, if you apologise,
like I know you will,

114
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:13,007
I might convince him
that you really didn't mean it.

115
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:43,382
I saw it. You killed all four of them.

116
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,591
You'll pay, all right. You'll be strung up.

117
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,674
Who are you?

118
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:54,799
Don't fire a shot.

119
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:58,299
I'm John Baxter - Sheriff.

120
00:16:00,674 --> 00:16:06,257
Yeah. Well, if you're the sheriff,
you better get these men underground.

121
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:21,174
My mistake. Four coffins.

122
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,257
Hey!

123
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:43,632
I told you I wasn't cheap,
but I think you'll find it's worth your while.

124
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:45,924
..98, 99, 100.

125
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,007
The rest when you're all done.

126
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:52,216
When do I start?

127
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:55,632
I'm not in a hurry, at least for the moment.

128
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:59,716
With four less Baxters,
now is as good a time to start as any.

129
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:03,924
In a few days, a troop of cavalry
will pass through San Miguel.

130
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:09,216
I wouldn't want the military sticking
their long noses into our business.

131
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:12,216
You seem to be well informed.

132
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:17,716
In these parts, a man's life often depends
on a mere scrap of information.

133
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,299
Hm. This thing couldn't have been
very useful to its owner.

134
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:29,174
My brother Ramon did that!
He often uses it for target practice.

135
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:32,966
With a gun in his hand,
no-one stands in his way.

136
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,966
The armour is one of his favourite targets.

137
00:17:36,174 --> 00:17:39,966
Naturally, when he doesn't have
anything better to shoot.

138
00:17:40,174 --> 00:17:44,966
Well, I'll be kinda curious
to meet this brother of yours.

139
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:49,966
Ah, this is Chico,
one of the most trusted of my men.

140
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:53,758
Follow him.
He will bring you to your room.

141
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:56,466
I would like you to feel at home.

142
00:17:56,674 --> 00:18:00,549
Well, I never found home that great.
Let's go.

143
00:18:18,133 --> 00:18:19,716
Who's that?

144
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:23,924
Her name is Marisol.
You just forget about her.

145
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:29,716
This one will be your room.

146
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,591
You gave him 100.
We've never paid that much before.

147
00:19:05,008 --> 00:19:07,383
Can you explain
why you have taken him on?

148
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:11,091
To have a filthy gringo here,
and to give him 100 besides?

149
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,174
We have never paid anybody so much.

150
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:17,591
You cannot leave someone like that
to do what he wants!

151
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:21,674
He might do anything
and I want law and order in this place!

152
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:26,383
If that is all you want,
there is a much cheaper way.

153
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,883
Just snuff him out.

154
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:32,841
And who will be the one? You?

155
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:34,758
Yes. Why not?

156
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,758
A shot in his back

157
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:40,633
and then you would have him
out of the way in no time at all.

158
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:44,341
Listen, I could do it easily right now.

159
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:49,049
He won't be expecting it,
and I'd get back the 100.

160
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:55,258
You are stupid, Esteban!
Even if you are my brother!

161
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:58,424
A bullet in the back and it is ended!

162
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:03,341
And what happens if your hand
should tremble and he's only been hurt?

163
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:08,133
With the cavalry arriving in town,
and that Yankee so quick on the draw...

164
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:13,633
- But I was only thinking...
- Don't think! You let me do the thinking.

165
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:19,424
Go and see the Americano.
Ask if he needs anything. Make friends.

166
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,508
Get one thing clear.

167
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:25,799
This is going to be a quiet town
until Ramon gets back!

168
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:29,883
Is that clear? A quiet town.

169
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:46,799
I am Esteban Rojo.
My brother asked me to...

170
00:20:52,174 --> 00:20:54,091
What are you doing?

171
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:56,383
Moving.

172
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,966
But didn't you know
all our men live here with us?

173
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:07,258
That's all very cosy, but, uh,
I don't find you men all that appealin'.

174
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:13,174
Besides, your brother said he didn't have
any need for me any more right now.

175
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:36,841
Halt!

176
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:41,133
- Sergeant.
- Yes, Capitan?

177
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,424
Tell the men we'll spend tonight here.

178
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:46,633
Arrange it so they can pick up
the supplies here.

179
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,508
Also double the guard
on the stagecoach there.

180
00:21:49,716 --> 00:21:51,299
Yes, sir.

181
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:54,716
Now, what do you suppose
is in that coach?

182
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:59,091
It would be easy to find out.
Get up close and take a look inside.

183
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,091
If they fire at you, you know it's gold.

184
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:04,508
Not a bad idea.

185
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:20,008
Mm.

186
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:32,674
Looking for anything?

187
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:35,174
Hello.

188
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:37,966
Get out of here, Yankee. Vamos.

189
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:53,549
Why aren't you sleeping?

190
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,466
When I see you staring like that,
it bothers me.

191
00:22:57,841 --> 00:23:00,758
I keep wondering
what was in that stagecoach.

192
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:03,841
It's something
they think is very important.

193
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:08,133
I asked a few questions of the captain
and almost was arrested.

194
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:11,258
Who's Marisol?

195
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:18,424
You'd better get some sleep. You need it.
Much too dangerous, even for you.

196
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:22,841
All I did is ask who she was.

197
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:27,924
She is a woman.
Ramon's madly in love with her.

198
00:23:28,216 --> 00:23:30,716
Does that make it clear to you?

199
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:34,799
Mm. Everybody in this town
talks about Ramon.

200
00:23:36,424 --> 00:23:38,633
I'm curious to meet him.

201
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:44,424
If you're smart, you'll try to stay
clear of Ramon as long as possible.

202
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,883
Ah! There are the soldiers.

203
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:53,383
They're moving off very quietly.

204
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:02,299
Strange. They're headed for the frontier.

205
00:24:07,091 --> 00:24:08,591
Tell me,

206
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:12,966
is that the way you go to bed every night?

207
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:17,383
Don't worry. I didn't dirty the sheets.

208
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:20,883
No, wait! I'm coming, too!

209
00:24:21,091 --> 00:24:23,966
I want to see
how you're going to get in trouble.

210
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:26,966
Ha-ha. All right, all right. Go ahead.

211
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:15,216
It's like playing cowboys and lndians.

212
00:25:18,508 --> 00:25:21,008
- Captain.
- Welcome, Lieutenant.

213
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,591
There is your gold as promised.

214
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,924
I hope the guns you are giving us
will be equally useful to our army.

215
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:32,799
Rest assured, Captain.
We'll check 'em over together.

216
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:08,383
Get their clothes on again, and hurry.

217
00:27:08,716 --> 00:27:13,383
Be sure to place them around right.
They died fighting among themselves.

218
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,841
Rubio!

219
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:40,633
There. It's Ramon.

220
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:59,341
This is my brother Ramon.
I think I mentioned him.

221
00:27:59,716 --> 00:28:01,633
Everybody talks about Ramon.

222
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:05,716
And many speak of you, too.
My dear brother included.

223
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:09,424
Well, I hope they say... nice things?

224
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:12,008
Did you have a good trip?

225
00:28:13,008 --> 00:28:17,799
It was tiring. It was terribly hard
on the road during the day.

226
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:22,091
And stagecoaches are
an uncomfortable way to travel.

227
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:25,299
Well, I'm sure you'll be
in great shape in no time.

228
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:29,508
The Americano cannot wait
to get into action!

229
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,674
I am sorry.
He is going to be a disappointed man.

230
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:33,966
How's that?

231
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:38,591
The Baxters accepted the invitation.
They'll come tonight, Don Miguel.

232
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:40,966
You must be out of your head!

233
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:44,091
I told Chico to invite them here.

234
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:46,466
Ramon, what is this?

235
00:28:47,883 --> 00:28:53,466
I found out many things travelling.
I have decided that... it's very stupid.

236
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:57,758
We just keep on shooting at each other -
and without results.

237
00:28:58,174 --> 00:29:00,258
You've gone out of your mind, Ramon!

238
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:03,466
No, I've come to my senses, Esteban.

239
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:05,466
Believe me.

240
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:07,633
Trust me.

241
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:10,466
Life can be so precious.

242
00:29:10,758 --> 00:29:14,133
It's foolish to risk
losing it every minute, no?

243
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:21,049
There's enough space for everybody
in this town. Even Baxters, hm?

244
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:23,549
For this reason,

245
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:27,716
I've decided to hang my gun up
on the wall.

246
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:32,341
I think that Ramon is right.
I, too, am tired of these killings.

247
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:34,508
They must stop!

248
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:37,924
This is all... very, very touching.

249
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:40,799
You don't admire peace?

250
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:44,799
It's not really easy to like
something you know nothing about.

251
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:48,924
Stay here and you may just
profit from the experience.

252
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:51,924
No, thanks. I'll be movin' on.

253
00:29:58,883 --> 00:30:03,383
Here's your money, Don Miguel.
I only used a small amount of it.

254
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:08,174
I don't like to take money
unless I feel I've earned it.

255
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:14,091
Why are you so hasty? Stay here.
You might enjoy dining with us tonight.

256
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,674
You see, the Baxters have four men
in the cemetery on account of me.

257
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:22,383
I don't think
they'd appreciate my presence.

258
00:30:29,258 --> 00:30:34,549
- He is too smart to be just a hired fighter.
- With a pistol, no-one can touch him.

259
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:39,549
When someone with that face
works with his gun, count on two things.

260
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:45,466
He's fast, but he's also intelligent.
That makes him too dangerous for you.

261
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:49,549
Now he's gone, explain that nonsense
about hanging up your gun

262
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:51,841
and making up with the Baxters.

263
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:57,549
Is it possible that you'll never be able
to reach any conclusions on your own?

264
00:30:57,924 --> 00:31:03,049
Our government and the Americanos
will find those bodies and investigate.

265
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,424
They'll investigate, all right.

266
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:08,633
And we'll be quiet
and peacefully bide our time.

267
00:31:08,924 --> 00:31:12,633
We know nothing about a massacre
at the Rio Bravo, eh?

268
00:31:13,008 --> 00:31:18,133
I arranged for the bodies to be lying
as if both companies killed each other.

269
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:21,008
But do you think they'll believe it?

270
00:31:21,216 --> 00:31:23,424
Ah, yes, I think so.

271
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:29,008
Because if they don't find a guilty party,
they will call off the investigation.

272
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:32,091
Yes, but... what about the Baxters?

273
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:34,299
The Baxters?

274
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,799
They want nothing more
than to live in peace.

275
00:31:38,008 --> 00:31:41,883
We'll let them have their own way
for a while. So, forget the Baxters.

276
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,383
We'll take care of them later
when the investigation finishes!

277
00:31:52,383 --> 00:31:56,966
That was a fine idea that you had.
What was it again?

278
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:59,758
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes.

279
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:04,258
The Baxters on one side,
the Rojos on the other.

280
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,758
And you'd be in the middle.

281
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:13,049
The only problem is
that they've joined up.

282
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:18,258
Now you have no job and no money
to pay me what you owe me.

283
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:23,966
There is only one thing for you to do.
Leave. I'll forget about what you owe me.

284
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:28,049
Leave San Miguel and never come back
for the rest of your days.

285
00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:31,758
Hey, Joe! I prepared the wagon
the way you asked me to.

286
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:35,258
We're sitting in the back here
with two empty coffins.

287
00:32:35,758 --> 00:32:38,924
What are you up to?
Are you changing your profession?

288
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:42,341
If you want to go on living, you'd better.

289
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:45,633
In my opinion,
you will make a fine pallbearer.

290
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,008
Close this place and come with me.

291
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:53,133
Oh, close up, huh? It's done.

292
00:32:53,424 --> 00:32:58,799
Where are we going?
I'd like to know, or is it a secret?

293
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:03,299
Down by the river, to have a look
at some corpses down there.

294
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:52,258
The Rojos say come to dinner
and we must go, but I don't like it at all.

295
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:57,049
Even if they've granted
all the guarantees we demanded.

296
00:33:57,466 --> 00:34:01,049
We'll go along with it,
but don't touch anything!

297
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:04,258
You mustn't eat. You mustn't drink.

298
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:08,925
You just keep your eyes open
and keep your wits about you.

299
00:34:32,508 --> 00:34:34,008
Whoa...

300
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:37,217
Are you sure that nobody has seen us?

301
00:34:37,508 --> 00:34:39,508
Only a ghost or two.

302
00:34:39,717 --> 00:34:42,425
No, no, no.
Don't joke about things like this.

303
00:34:42,592 --> 00:34:45,300
Ghosts are better left where they are.

304
00:34:45,508 --> 00:34:49,092
You look as though
this place suits you very well.

305
00:34:49,508 --> 00:34:55,008
And if you go on like this, you will
soon be here permanently. Hee-hee!

306
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:09,967
Why is it, with all those bodies,
we are just burying these two?

307
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,967
We're not... gonna bury 'em.

308
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:15,383
We are not burying them?

309
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:18,175
That's right, we're not gonna bury 'em.

310
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:23,883
If we are not burying them, I would
like to know what we will use them for?

311
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:27,050
Why are we taking the trouble to do this?

312
00:35:27,883 --> 00:35:31,675
The dead can be very useful sometimes.

313
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:36,133
They've helped me outta tough spots
more than once.

314
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,133
First, they don't talk.

315
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:50,133
Second, they can be made to look alive
if I manage it right.

316
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:51,842
Yeah.

317
00:35:53,342 --> 00:35:55,133
And third,

318
00:35:56,342 --> 00:36:01,633
if you shoot 'em, there's no worry
cos they're dead already. Understand?

319
00:36:02,717 --> 00:36:05,217
It makes no sense to me
and I'm getting out!

320
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:08,008
I'm alive
and I want to remain with the living.

321
00:36:08,217 --> 00:36:12,008
And when I'm dead,
I'll want to remain with the dead.

322
00:36:12,425 --> 00:36:14,300
I hope that's clear.

323
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:18,800
Also, I don't like the idea
that you've placed those bodies there.

324
00:36:19,092 --> 00:36:23,300
The man buried there is the only one
who ever died of pneumonia here!

325
00:36:23,717 --> 00:36:27,883
Take it easy, will ya? Our friends here
are gonna help me pay your bill.

326
00:36:28,217 --> 00:36:30,592
Ah, get up there!

327
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:04,175
Their only reason to start a war would be
to kidnap you from your husband's side.

328
00:37:04,675 --> 00:37:07,467
He is gallant, this Rojo.

329
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,467
I didn't think him capable of compliments.

330
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:14,467
He's not. All that he says is false,
like his proposals.

331
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:20,258
You women! lf things aren't complicated
for you, you become suspicious.

332
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:25,842
Yes. Because to me it just didn't
seem right. It went too smoothly.

333
00:37:26,258 --> 00:37:27,925
I don't trust them.

334
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,550
You'd like to prove me wrong,
wouldn't you? Always the same thing.

335
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:37,050
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

336
00:38:15,383 --> 00:38:18,300
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt ya.

337
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:22,967
I just want ya to know why the Rojos
wanna make peace all of a sudden.

338
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:28,383
There was once a wagonload of gold
that the soldiers were takin' to the border.

339
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:39,675
John! Come up here quickly.

340
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:46,758
Sorry.

341
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:49,675
When a husband finds
a man in his wife's bedroom,

342
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:52,342
you're never sure how he's gonna react.

343
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:58,258
- Give him 500.
- How's that?

344
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:03,342
Give the money to him.
He has an interesting story. Listen to him.

345
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,133
That's the right idea?

346
00:39:06,342 --> 00:39:08,717
I get the wrong idea only when it suits me.

347
00:39:08,925 --> 00:39:11,633
Ramon! The soldiers escorting the gold...

348
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:15,633
Two of them got away.
They're hiding out in the cemetery.

349
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:18,633
The Baxters are about to capture them.

350
00:39:18,925 --> 00:39:21,508
Hey! Rubio! Get the men.

351
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:26,800
You are well informed.

352
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:31,133
A man's life here often depends
on a mere scrap of information.

353
00:39:31,508 --> 00:39:33,217
Your brother's own words.

354
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,092
Tell me, why are you doing this for us?

355
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:41,300
500.

356
00:39:48,508 --> 00:39:51,883
With these two soldiers
as witnesses against Ramon,

357
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:55,008
the government
will rid the town of the Rojos.

358
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,675
Then San Miguel will have just one boss.

359
00:39:57,967 --> 00:39:59,592
Hurry!

360
00:40:14,383 --> 00:40:16,383
Let's go!

361
00:40:18,967 --> 00:40:20,467
Coming with us?

362
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:25,675
No, no. When a man's got money
in his pocket, he appreciates peace.

363
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:27,758
Come on!

364
00:41:33,467 --> 00:41:35,092
Whoa!

365
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:38,300
Let's leave the horses here.

366
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:51,883
Por Dios!

367
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,967
Who is there? Come out!

368
00:42:03,258 --> 00:42:04,175
Ohh!

369
00:42:24,633 --> 00:42:26,342
What do you think?

370
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:30,717
I don't know.
There's somethin' about it I don't like.

371
00:42:31,008 --> 00:42:33,842
Too still to be wounded,
more like dummies.

372
00:42:34,008 --> 00:42:37,800
Sure! Dummies that interest the Rojos.
Better hide. Hurry!

373
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,383
- What do we do?
- Circle around to the side.

374
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:59,675
Keep them busy long enough
for me to get those two.

375
00:44:59,967 --> 00:45:02,175
Go on! Go on! Quickly!

376
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:42,342
Keep me covered.
I'll take care of those two.

377
00:46:19,883 --> 00:46:23,800
Listen, Baxter!
You can have them now if you like!

378
00:46:24,092 --> 00:46:26,675
Since dead men can't talk!

379
00:46:37,258 --> 00:46:40,758
It seems they didn't like my joke.

380
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:43,050
We'll let them go home in a while.

381
00:48:27,383 --> 00:48:32,342
This bad boy will be our guest only until
Baxter leaves San Miguel for the frontier.

382
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:34,258
Put him in the cellar.

383
00:48:40,258 --> 00:48:44,050
Esteban, good work!
With Antonio as our prisoner,

384
00:48:44,342 --> 00:48:48,550
the Baxters will have to give in to us.
Now we can make any kind of demand!

385
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:51,217
Don Miguel! Don Miguel!

386
00:48:56,342 --> 00:48:58,717
What has happened? Talk, will you!

387
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,508
I don't know who,
but somebody shot at me.

388
00:49:01,717 --> 00:49:03,717
Marisol!

389
00:49:04,633 --> 00:49:07,717
Marisol! Where are you, Marisol?!

390
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:27,800
Strange... how you always manage
to be in the right place at the right time.

391
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:39,175
It's nothing serious,
a headache that will pass. She'll sleep.

392
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:48,383
Keep your eyes open. She's not to move
from that room, you hear?

393
00:49:54,675 --> 00:49:57,050
I wouldn't mention I brought her here.

394
00:49:57,258 --> 00:50:00,675
I wouldn't want the Rojos to think
I was on your side.

395
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,758
Don't be worried. I'm rich enough

396
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,967
to appreciate the men
that my money can buy.

397
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:10,050
I've been to talk to the Rojos.

398
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:14,550
They'll give back Antonio
in exchange for Marisol in the morning.

399
00:50:16,758 --> 00:50:19,758
Very soon, you're going to be rich.

400
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:22,425
Uh-huh.

401
00:50:25,217 --> 00:50:28,925
Yeah, that's not gonna break my heart.

402
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:16,842
Where is she?
You said I'd see her! Where is she?

403
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:19,342
I want to see her!

404
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,217
Come back here, Jesus. Come here.

405
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:28,133
I want to see her!
Why can't I look at her? I want to see her!

406
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,008
Go. Go to him, Marisol.

407
00:53:14,967 --> 00:53:15,758
Mama!

408
00:53:19,592 --> 00:53:21,675
- Mama!
- Jesus!

409
00:53:29,175 --> 00:53:29,967
Mama!

410
00:53:33,258 --> 00:53:35,967
- Jesus!
- Mama! Mama!

411
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:42,842
Mama!

412
00:54:26,008 --> 00:54:28,008
Julio.

413
00:54:28,592 --> 00:54:30,092
Marisol.

414
00:54:30,592 --> 00:54:32,508
Get Julio.

415
00:54:43,883 --> 00:54:46,592
You were warned to get outta town.

416
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,675
Now I'm gonna make you pay
once and for all.

417
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:53,092
Let him be.

418
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:34,717
You better get goin'. Ramon's waitin'.

419
00:55:39,008 --> 00:55:42,633
And you, get that kid home
where he belongs.

420
00:56:29,675 --> 00:56:31,758
A pig, that Ramon!

421
00:56:32,675 --> 00:56:35,175
Tell me, what's Ramon
got to do with them?

422
00:56:35,383 --> 00:56:37,550
You weren't told, eh?

423
00:56:39,758 --> 00:56:42,050
In these parts, the story is very old.

424
00:56:42,258 --> 00:56:46,550
A happy little family until trouble
comes along. Trouble is Ramon.

425
00:56:46,842 --> 00:56:50,467
Claiming the husband cheated at cards,
which wasn't true,

426
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:53,467
he gets the wife
to live with him as hostage.

427
00:56:53,758 --> 00:56:54,842
The husband?

428
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:58,258
Him, there's nothing for him to do.

429
00:56:58,467 --> 00:57:04,050
The Rojos threatened to kill his boy,
Jesus. He was forced to accept things.

430
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:08,133
That Ramon is smart.

431
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:11,717
Where are you going?

432
00:57:15,508 --> 00:57:18,008
To the Rojos, to look for a job.

433
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:22,217
Poo!

434
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:29,217
I'm glad we have the Americano with us.
It's the best thing to happen to us.

435
00:57:29,508 --> 00:57:34,592
If either government starts an enquiry,
we'll need every man we can get.

436
00:57:36,008 --> 00:57:41,383
To be at war with the Baxters now is
worse than sitting on a case of dynamite.

437
00:57:41,717 --> 00:57:44,383
- Where should we put this?
- Put it over there.

438
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,592
Come on, everybody. Drink up!

439
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:28,758
Good shooting. Very good shooting.

440
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:33,842
To kill a man, you shoot for his heart,
and a Winchester is the best weapon.

441
00:58:34,258 --> 00:58:37,633
That's very nice, but I'll stick with my .45.

442
00:58:37,925 --> 00:58:41,550
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

443
00:58:41,842 --> 00:58:44,842
the man with the pistol
will be a dead man.

444
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:49,050
That's an old Mexican proverb,
and it's true.

445
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:51,550
You believe that?

446
00:58:53,008 --> 00:58:57,508
Paquito, take five men
and escort Marisol to the small house.

447
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:12,008
- Everything is prepared.
- Do not worry. I will return tomorrow.

448
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:14,425
The wagons are ready. We can leave.

449
00:59:14,508 --> 00:59:16,008
Everyone!

450
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:18,508
Enjoy yourselves during my absence!

451
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:39,383
You heard Ramon,
let's have a good time.

452
01:00:01,342 --> 01:00:03,342
He weighs over a ton.

453
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:07,342
Of course, with all he poured into himself.

454
01:01:24,258 --> 01:01:25,675
Papa,

455
01:01:25,967 --> 01:01:28,967
did you not tell me
no-one could go see Mama?

456
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:33,133
That's right.

457
01:01:33,467 --> 01:01:37,925
Then, why does that man see her
when I cannot?

458
01:01:39,342 --> 01:01:42,633
- I want Mama!
- Come away from the door. Quiet.

459
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:47,633
We cannot show ourselves.
You must stay away.

460
01:01:58,133 --> 01:01:59,133
Hello.

461
01:02:19,508 --> 01:02:22,008
There's somebody shooting
at the small house.

462
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:25,383
Saddle the horses immediately!
Come on, let's go!

463
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:54,758
Look out!

464
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:48,508
Take this money. It's enough to live on
for a while. Now, get across the border.

465
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:51,425
Get as far away from San Miguel
as possible.

466
01:03:51,592 --> 01:03:54,217
How may we thank you
for what you are doing?

467
01:03:54,508 --> 01:03:57,383
Don't try. Just get goin'
before the Rojos get here.

468
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,800
Why do you do this for us?

469
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:10,800
Why? I knew someone like you once.
No-one was there to help. Get movin'.

470
01:04:14,175 --> 01:04:15,675
Get movin'.

471
01:04:16,675 --> 01:04:18,675
Get outta here!

472
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:03,050
What do you see, Chico?

473
01:05:03,342 --> 01:05:06,133
They're all dead. They massacred them.

474
01:05:06,425 --> 01:05:10,425
- They kidnapped Marisol!
- This looks like the work of the Baxters.

475
01:05:10,717 --> 01:05:14,717
Quick! Let's get back before
they attack our house in the town.

476
01:07:08,925 --> 01:07:11,508
Chico, give out the ammunition.

477
01:07:11,717 --> 01:07:15,383
Esteban, spread your men
around the house. Keep your eyes open.

478
01:07:15,717 --> 01:07:21,008
Miguel, Paco, behind the house.
Manolo and Alvaro, come with me.

479
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,800
Stay alert!

480
01:07:23,008 --> 01:07:26,383
The way they killed those men,
there must be a lot of them.

481
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,592
It's a warm evening.

482
01:07:39,883 --> 01:07:44,258
One of our wagons lost a wheel
so we had to turn back here to get help.

483
01:07:46,175 --> 01:07:51,467
One of the men tells me...
the Baxters attacked the small house.

484
01:07:53,758 --> 01:07:55,967
Do you know about it?

485
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:01,342
Tell me what you know.

486
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,258
Oh!

487
01:08:21,217 --> 01:08:22,842
Well?

488
01:08:23,842 --> 01:08:26,425
Where did you hide Marisol?

489
01:08:28,425 --> 01:08:30,007
Rubio.

490
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:58,300
You are thirsty? You want to drink?

491
01:08:58,507 --> 01:09:01,592
No, no. It is too soon to drink.

492
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,175
Ooh!

493
01:09:04,882 --> 01:09:06,300
Bring him over here.

494
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:40,257
You are a stubborn idiot. Tell us
where Marisol is and it'll all be ended.

495
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:45,132
In a week, you'll be back in shape,
and you can go wherever you want.

496
01:09:56,342 --> 01:09:58,550
That's enough for today.

497
01:09:58,842 --> 01:10:02,007
Sooner or later he'll talk.
It's just a matter of time.

498
01:10:02,342 --> 01:10:04,925
He mustn't escape or die.
Otherwise, do as you like.

499
01:10:10,007 --> 01:10:13,425
Wait till he comes to.
This way he hardly feels anything.

500
01:10:46,467 --> 01:10:52,092
I have a poker hand waiting for me.
Now I am stuck here! I can't get back to it!

501
01:10:52,467 --> 01:10:56,757
This is more amusing than cards.
Just be sure he does not die,

502
01:10:57,092 --> 01:11:00,382
and also make sure
he regrets the day he was born.

503
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:07,175
The gringo is asleep, I imagine.
That's all right. I'll enjoy waking him up.

504
01:12:11,882 --> 01:12:13,882
Esteban, what was that noise?

505
01:12:14,092 --> 01:12:17,300
I do not know.
I heard a yell and then a crash.

506
01:12:49,467 --> 01:12:51,342
It's useless to hide!

507
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:55,467
You are finished playing the smart boy.

508
01:12:57,467 --> 01:13:00,257
Go up and look in the loft!

509
01:13:00,925 --> 01:13:03,842
And take a look behind the barrels!

510
01:13:14,925 --> 01:13:17,217
Let's get out of here!

511
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,800
Hurry! Hurry!

512
01:13:29,217 --> 01:13:32,092
- Come on!
- You, come along with me!

513
01:13:47,217 --> 01:13:52,800
Surround the town! Block the streets
leading out! Find him for me!

514
01:13:53,882 --> 01:13:57,592
- Esteban, search the whole town!
- Follow me!

515
01:13:58,507 --> 01:14:01,882
Get him back right now!
You've got to at any cost!

516
01:14:02,175 --> 01:14:05,675
Look in the stables, in every corral,
in the store!

517
01:14:05,967 --> 01:14:10,175
Look for him in the church!
Go in there! Search every inch of it!

518
01:14:10,592 --> 01:14:13,467
Search everywhere! Rubio, in here!

519
01:14:14,882 --> 01:14:19,675
If somebody is hiding him,
burn their house down and kill them!

520
01:14:19,967 --> 01:14:21,882
You, come here!

521
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:25,882
Look for him near the Baxters',
but take him alive. I want him alive!

522
01:14:26,257 --> 01:14:27,757
Alive!

523
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:31,257
Rubio,... in the bar.

524
01:15:01,925 --> 01:15:05,132
He says he knows nothing.
He's being smart.

525
01:15:05,425 --> 01:15:07,632
Bring him here to me.

526
01:15:09,132 --> 01:15:11,217
I swear I'm telling the truth.

527
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:14,132
Well,... you know nothing, huh?

528
01:15:14,717 --> 01:15:16,717
Nothing! I have not seen him!

529
01:15:16,925 --> 01:15:19,300
Rubio, you take care of him!

530
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:03,050
Where have you hidden him?

531
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,257
I... didn't... hide...

532
01:16:10,967 --> 01:16:14,132
You are the right friend
for that filthy Americano.

533
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,550
You'll end up the same way.

534
01:16:16,842 --> 01:16:18,842
We looked everywhere.

535
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:23,050
In his cellar, in the attic, on the roof,
but there is no trace.

536
01:16:23,925 --> 01:16:26,425
I couldn't find anybody in the back room.

537
01:16:26,842 --> 01:16:31,050
He has taken refuge with the Baxters.
The Americano isn't stupid.

538
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:34,842
He knows that's the best place to hide.

539
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:40,632
The Baxters, eh?
Then better go and get him.

540
01:16:45,507 --> 01:16:47,507
And that's for being his friend.

541
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:24,092
Curse them!

542
01:17:29,757 --> 01:17:31,467
Piripero!

543
01:17:31,757 --> 01:17:33,175
Eh?

544
01:17:40,175 --> 01:17:42,175
- Piripero!
- Hm?

545
01:17:52,967 --> 01:17:56,132
- Come here.
- I can't see anybody.

546
01:17:56,632 --> 01:17:59,132
- Come here.
- Dios mio!

547
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:10,217
What are you doing in there?

548
01:18:10,717 --> 01:18:13,217
Never mind. Get me outta here.

549
01:18:13,425 --> 01:18:15,717
But you're not dead yet.

550
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:20,842
I will be, if you don't get me
outta here quick. Get the lid down.

551
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,132
Rubio.

552
01:20:10,092 --> 01:20:12,425
I see some signs of life.

553
01:20:13,007 --> 01:20:16,507
Let's be ready
when they decide to come out.

554
01:20:18,092 --> 01:20:22,592
Don't shoot!
We surrender! Don't shoot!

555
01:20:25,882 --> 01:20:28,507
Don't shoot! We're coming out!

556
01:20:31,675 --> 01:20:33,882
I surrender! Hold back your fire!

557
01:20:34,092 --> 01:20:36,882
Don't shoot! We're surrendering!

558
01:21:06,132 --> 01:21:09,050
Stop. I wanna take a look at this.

559
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:50,092
Ramon! Don't shoot!
We're comin' out.

560
01:22:53,507 --> 01:22:55,092
We surrender!

561
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:58,882
Listen, you've won! It's enough!
I'll get outta town!

562
01:22:59,092 --> 01:23:01,007
I'll do whatever you like!

563
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,800
- You promise that?
- I swear it, Ramon!

564
01:23:04,007 --> 01:23:05,800
You won't try any tricks?

565
01:23:06,007 --> 01:23:11,175
None. No, no tricks. I said before,
I give you my word, we'll leave!

566
01:23:11,675 --> 01:23:15,382
Are you sure? You had better
ask permission of your wife.

567
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:18,592
Maybe she won't be too happy!

568
01:23:32,757 --> 01:23:35,550
Antonio! John!

569
01:24:01,842 --> 01:24:03,550
Murderers.

570
01:24:04,842 --> 01:24:07,050
They had no guns!

571
01:24:07,425 --> 01:24:10,342
Murderers! I hope you rot in hell!

572
01:24:10,632 --> 01:24:13,842
May you all die spitting blood!
Curse you for this!

573
01:24:14,007 --> 01:24:16,217
Murderers!

574
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,592
Let's go. The show's over anyway.

575
01:24:45,675 --> 01:24:48,882
Keep looking for him!
Search among those bodies!

576
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,882
The filthy Americano
has to be somewhere.

577
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:12,050
Silvanito?

578
01:27:17,425 --> 01:27:19,342
Where's Silvanito?

579
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:24,342
Any news today?

580
01:27:24,425 --> 01:27:28,842
I have to tell you some bad news.
I hate to tell you this, Joe, but...

581
01:27:29,132 --> 01:27:31,007
Where is Silvanito?

582
01:27:32,132 --> 01:27:36,217
He was captured this morning
by those men of Ramon's.

583
01:27:36,425 --> 01:27:39,217
They grabbed him on his way here.

584
01:27:39,507 --> 01:27:44,425
He was bringing in some provisions.
He is being tortured, but he won't talk.

585
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,925
He's stubborn.

586
01:27:46,007 --> 01:27:50,382
Whatever they do, he won't say a word,
even if it means his life.

587
01:27:50,507 --> 01:27:53,300
Listen to me.
They'll never be able to force him.

588
01:28:05,007 --> 01:28:08,800
Now, old fool, loosen up your tongue.

589
01:28:11,507 --> 01:28:12,592
No.

590
01:28:12,882 --> 01:28:14,382
Rubio!

591
01:28:15,967 --> 01:28:19,882
Get back to your shop.
You're liable to have business there.

592
01:28:20,175 --> 01:28:22,882
Very good! That's what I wanted to hear.

593
01:28:23,092 --> 01:28:28,257
I brought a little surprise for you.
I know how much you will need it.

594
01:28:28,592 --> 01:28:32,175
It was hard to get my hands on it.
I got it by using my head.

595
01:28:32,467 --> 01:28:36,257
No-one can resist two bottles of wine.

596
01:28:36,467 --> 01:28:39,467
I thought you might need that pistol.

597
01:28:39,757 --> 01:28:42,467
And I brought another present.

598
01:28:43,257 --> 01:28:44,967
It's dynamite.

599
01:28:45,175 --> 01:28:47,467
I stole it from the Rojos.

600
01:28:47,757 --> 01:28:51,550
The moment's come
for you to light the fuse

601
01:28:51,967 --> 01:28:55,550
and send it back to them.

602
01:29:13,425 --> 01:29:15,632
Still lots of light.

603
01:29:18,842 --> 01:29:21,425
Too early to be asleep yet.

604
01:29:25,507 --> 01:29:27,217
Rubio, here.

605
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:37,382
I shouldn't like to ruin the rifle.
I could never find another like this one.

606
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:40,717
Later, Ramon.
Let's try it with this one now.

607
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:48,050
Gringo!

608
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:57,175
I heard you wanted to see me.

609
01:31:57,675 --> 01:31:59,550
The Americano's dead.

610
01:32:01,842 --> 01:32:03,967
Cut the old man down.

611
01:32:22,132 --> 01:32:26,007
What's wrong, Ramon?
You losing your touch?

612
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:36,300
Are you afraid, Ramon?

613
01:32:39,632 --> 01:32:42,300
If you shoot to kill,
you'd better hit the heart.

614
01:32:44,717 --> 01:32:47,007
Your own words, Ramon.

615
01:33:03,092 --> 01:33:06,800
The heart, Ramon. Don't forget the heart.

616
01:33:09,675 --> 01:33:11,967
Aim for the heart or you'll never stop me.

617
01:34:49,467 --> 01:34:52,757
When a man with a .45
meets a man with a rifle,

618
01:34:52,967 --> 01:34:55,467
you said the man with the pistol's
a dead man.

619
01:34:57,092 --> 01:34:59,300
Let's see if that's true.

620
01:35:22,967 --> 01:35:25,050
Go ahead. Load up and shoot.

621
01:37:28,425 --> 01:37:31,632
Hey. Hey, listen, Joe.

622
01:37:33,007 --> 01:37:35,217
Listen, Joe, l... I...

623
01:37:37,425 --> 01:37:39,300
Oh, Joe... Joe...

624
01:38:12,175 --> 01:38:15,882
I guess your government'll be glad
to see that gold back.

625
01:38:16,257 --> 01:38:19,967
And you? You don't want to be here
when they get it, eh?

626
01:38:22,257 --> 01:38:25,175
You mean,
the Mexican government on one side,

627
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:30,757
maybe the Americans on the other,
and me, right smack in the middle?

628
01:38:31,175 --> 01:38:33,257
Uh-uh. Too dangerous.

629
01:38:34,342 --> 01:38:35,967
So long.

630
01:38:36,175 --> 01:38:37,675
Adios.

631
01:38:51,842 --> 01:38:55,132
Let me see... Five seven.
