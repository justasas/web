1
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:39,438
<i>¡Andale, caballo!</i>

2
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,660
<i>¡Andale, caballo!</i>

3
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,718
<i>¡Señor!</i>

4
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,175
<i>¡Señor!</i>

5
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,601
<i>¡Señor!</i>

6
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:21,838
<i>- Tighten up that girth.
- Señor, I must go to San Felipe.</i>

7
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,474
My mother is dead!

8
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,067
Straight down the road about 50 miles.

9
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:37,318
Please?

10
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:42,736
Yeah, get outta here.

11
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,427
<i>Hey. Hey, amigo.</i>

12
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:02,703
Come here.

13
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,271
Perfect.

14
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,481
You're perfect!

15
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,656
I swear to God, boys, he's just right.

16
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:44,031
I'm gonna put you on that stage and
watch those faces when they see you come in!

17
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,002
Move.

18
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,205
- By God, I...
- Never mind, dear.

19
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,164
Over there.

20
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:00,504
Not that door, the other one, there.

21
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,113
Pull. Pull.

22
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,209
There you are. Now just sit down
and be quiet, like a good little boy.

23
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,399
You see? He does understand.

24
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:21,343
Who knows, perhaps he can even talk.

25
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,911
Now, now, even the peasants...
A bit of mustard?

26
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:29,700
Thank you.
Even the peasants are entitled to their rights.

27
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,002
After all, they have won a revolution.

28
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,754
Or at least, almost.

29
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:37,699
Animals, that's what they are. Animals.

30
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,336
Even animals can be tame and harmless.

31
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,263
Personally, I consider them unfortunate brutes.

32
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:47,758
Yes, brutes. Quite right.

33
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:49,932
Precisely, my dear lady, precisely.

34
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,318
I hate saying it,
but you should hear them in the confessional.

35
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,875
- You would never imagine. Did you know?
- I can imagine, Father.

36
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,751
I can imagine.

37
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,038
Living in such promiscuity,
all of them in one room,

38
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:08,205
male and female together,
lying in a heap, like rats in a sewer.

39
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,755
At night, when the lights are out,
all their inhibitions disappear.

40
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:19,268
You never know who is next:
Mother, sister, daughter... goat.

41
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,612
Every country has its own plague.

42
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:29,307
- Just like them niggers we got back home.
- Just like animals. That's what they are.

43
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:33,139
Exactly. Which is why they're half-wits.

44
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,943
Hey, you. Do you know who your father was?

45
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:44,590
Do you know how old you are?

46
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:49,841
He doesn't know.

47
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,009
Do you know how many kids you have? Huh?

48
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,838
Do you know how many kids your mother had?

49
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,049
He doesn't know anything.

50
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:05,089
It was to benefit scum like this
that the Agrarian Reform was imposed.

51
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:13,577
And that ass, Madero, wanted to give
the government and our land to idiots like this.

52
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:16,703
We are all pawns in the hands of Almighty God.

53
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,617
Fortunately, Divine Providence
has disposed of that rash individual Madero.

54
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,889
My dear Monsignor, let us be realistic.

55
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:29,769
What you call Providence, I call General Huerta.
He put the peasants in their place.

56
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,046
Which is the best place for animals
because that's what they are.

57
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:38,667
Animals.

58
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,394
<i>I can imagine.</i>

59
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:45,827
- I can imagine, living in such promiscuity...
... wanted to give the government and our land

60
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,631
to idiots like this!

61
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,766
- Goats.
- Animals.

62
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:53,583
- Rats!
- Just like them niggers we got back home.

63
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,423
- Half-wits!
- Animals!

64
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,609
Divine Providence has disposed...

65
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,376
Just like them niggers.

66
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:05,376
Animals. Because that's what they are. Animals.

67
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,187
...like them niggers.
- Brutes!

68
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:09,561
That's what they are, animals.

69
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,154
- Like them niggers.
- Brutes!

70
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:12,758
Animals!

71
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,274
- I consider them unfortunate brutes.
- I can imagine...

72
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,071
Niggers.

73
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,900
- Brutes!
- Niggers!

74
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:21,972
...like them niggers.
- Idiots!

75
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,706
- Niggers!
- Idiots!

76
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,540
...like them niggers.
- Idiots! Half-wits!

77
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,718
<i>¡Anda, caballo anda!</i>

78
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,479
<i>¡Anda, caballo!</i>

79
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,966
Hey, you, give us a hand and push.

80
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,940
<i>- Move, you lazy bunch of greasers!
- ¡Anda!</i>

81
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:56,009
Think they'd get off their asses to help us,
the bastards? Hell, no!

82
00:11:56,979 --> 00:12:00,853
<i>¡Anda! ¡Caballo, huyo!</i>

83
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,769
Haaaahh!

84
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,817
Take him away before he dirties everything.

85
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,922
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen, you will give
everything to my niños, without any trouble.</i>

86
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:39,747
<i>We kill them all, OK, Papá?</i>

87
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:44,733
<i>I've told you, Chulo,
no shooting unless Papá pulls the trigger.</i>

88
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:58,001
Come.

89
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,089
Come, come, come, come!

90
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,606
You wanted to know my family? That's my sons.

91
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,266
Each one of them from a different mother.

92
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:22,255
And now, you kneel.

93
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,801
Kneel!

94
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,507
Kneel!

95
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,990
<i>¡Papá!</i>

96
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,914
This is my father. I think.

97
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,391
- Pleased to meet...
- Go inside before Chulo kills everyone.

98
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,024
My mother had the blood of the Aztecs,
which was before your people.

99
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,693
And now I ask you a question.

100
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:51,849
Can you make a baby?

101
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:55,074
Can you make a baby?

102
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,263
That's sad. But we will fix that.

103
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:04,284
<i>¡Señora!</i>

104
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,023
<i>Let me go! Let go.</i>

105
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,248
Go on.

106
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,423
Go.

107
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:53,899
<i>Go... go... go... go... go!</i>

108
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,852
Pretty good, huh?

109
00:18:06,939 --> 00:18:11,118
Oh, Jesus, help me, I'm going to faint.

110
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:18,489
No, no, no, no, no.
You faint now and you miss the best part.

111
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:30,070
Juanito, you get everything?

112
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:35,084
You'll pay for this, you bastard!

113
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:40,209
- I'm a citizen of the United States of America!
- You're an American son of a bitch.

114
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,295
Understand, Yankee?

115
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:05,615
Thank you.

116
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,438
Thank you. For everything.

117
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,758
Have you a light?

118
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,016
Duck, you sucker!

119
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:01,634
There is a hole in the roof.

120
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,667
Hey!

121
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,791
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Why?

122
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:49,038
You pull that trigger and shoot me, I fall.

123
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,414
And if I fall, they'll have to alter all the maps.

124
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,886
You see, when I go,
half this bloody country goes with me.

125
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,078
Including yourself.

126
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,497
<i>- You understand now?
- Ah, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí. I understand.</i>

127
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:19,575
<i>¡Sí!</i>

128
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:23,609
It's like a miracle of God.
You, you are a great magician.

129
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:28,264
I stop your motorcycle,
you do the magic with my coach. We are even.

130
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,565
<i>- Even?
- Sí.</i>

131
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,445
No, we're not even.

132
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:37,906
To fix my motorcycle would be even.

133
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,154
I'll be inside.

134
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:50,518
<i>Oh! We kill him now, Papá?</i>

135
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:53,878
No. First we fix the motorcycle. Shh!

136
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:11,609
- It's whisky.
- Thank God for that, huh?

137
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:14,846
Where are you going in this contraption?

138
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,631
Well... Where are you going?

139
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:22,230
- Shaver Mines.
- Oh-ho.

140
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:25,100
Lucanina, huh? I know that place.

141
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:29,321
I know the man who owns it,
that fat, German son of a bitch!

142
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,875
That crazy tub of lard, Mr Aschenbach,
who wrings our people dry like slaves,

143
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,711
even his personal servants.
One girl had an ass:

144
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,922
Her cheeks were hard like drums.
I got her pregnant and he...

145
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:45,736
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Will you shut up and go and fix my motorcycle?

146
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:50,212
OK.

147
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,827
OK.

148
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,507
Anything you say, Firecracker.

149
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,423
<i>Take your hands off that. Now!</i>

150
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,271
Well, good for you, Firecracker.

151
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,910
Not even one lousy peso!

152
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:02,846
I don't know why I named you Napoleon
when you have no imagination. This is a bank!

153
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,668
<i>- Mesa Verde.
- Sí, Papá, Mesa Verde. Mesa Verde.</i>

154
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:11,379
If we can get this Firecracker to come with us,
we will be rich.

155
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,951
Where does he come in?
The dynamite's right here.

156
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:18,361
No, no. You need an expert for that.

157
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,980
You only need matches and balls.
And I got those.

158
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:25,169
<i>- ¿Sí?
- ¡Sí!</i>

159
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,969
See that tree over there?

160
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,375
Short fuse.

161
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,907
Now you understand
why we need the firecracker?

162
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,492
Huh?

163
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:17,085
- Where the hell are we?
- What kind of work you do for the German?

164
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:22,625
Listen, I asked you a question.
What do you do for the German?

165
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:26,878
- I've been looking for silver for him.
- Silver?

166
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,703
You know something? I don't understand you.

167
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:36,224
Why do you waste your time and your holy water
looking for silver? To me, that's a sin.

168
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:43,325
<i>- Have you any better ideas?
- Sí. Gold is better than silver.</i>

169
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,911
There isn't any gold in these hills.

170
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:48,201
<i>Yes, there is.</i>

171
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,482
In Mesa Verde.

172
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:55,976
Mesa Verde? It's a city.

173
00:32:57,099 --> 00:33:00,929
Of course.
Whoever heard of having a bank in the country!

174
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,260
Uh-huh. A bank?

175
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:11,241
<i>Not a bank. The bank.</i>

176
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:19,548
The most beautiful, wonderful, fantastic,
gorgeous, magnificent bank in the world.

177
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,468
When you stand before the bank

178
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,413
and you see it has the gates of gold,
like it was the gates of heaven.

179
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,031
<i>And when you go inside,
everything, everything is gold.</i>

180
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,140
Gold spittoons, gold handles. And money.

181
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,446
Money, money is everywhere.

182
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,686
I know, 'cause I saw when I was
eight years old. I went there with my father.

183
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:49,460
<i>He tried to rob the bank. They caught him,
but they won't catch me. ¿Eh, Papá?</i>

184
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:51,044
Right.

185
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,980
Listen, Firecracker, you listen to me.

186
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:59,787
Listen, why don't you come with me

187
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,431
and we will work together?

188
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,457
And we will become rich.

189
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,489
What the hell is your name?

190
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,649
John.

191
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,769
What?

192
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,228
John.

193
00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:29,179
- What is your name?
- John.

194
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:32,976
<i>That's fantastic. That is incredible.</i>

195
00:34:33,259 --> 00:34:36,510
My name is Juan and yours is John.
Juan and John.

196
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,383
So what?

197
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,104
Can't you understand that is, that is the...

198
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,256
Oh...

199
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,293
Destiny.

200
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,452
No. And I mean it.

201
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,416
Why?

202
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:28,289
You want more money? I'll give you more
than half. I don't care about the money.

203
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,183
As long as we can work together.

204
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,252
Listen what I'm telling you.

205
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,986
We are like two brothers.

206
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:41,159
You make the holes with the holy water
and then I walk in and do the dirty work.

207
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,543
<i>Listen, it takes one bandito to know another.</i>

208
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:09,430
- So you can read?
- You don't have to read.

209
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:14,907
I see a man's picture, I see a price,
I know that man is in trouble.

210
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,012
Hey, what kind of trouble are you in?

211
00:37:29,139 --> 00:37:34,312
- Oh, we fought a revolution in Ireland.
- A revolution?

212
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,911
Seems revolutions are all over the world,
like the crops.

213
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:40,940
We had a revolution.
The brave people went in.

214
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:47,508
What it did to them was terrible. Pancho Villa,
the world's best bandit chief, two balls like a bull,

215
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:52,569
he went in the revolution as a great bandit,
came out as what? Nothing.

216
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,195
A general. That, to me, is the bullshit.

217
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:04,857
Wait a minute.
You come here to join the revolution?

218
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:08,932
No, no.

219
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,187
One was enough for me.

220
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,714
Stop! You dirty...

221
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,620
...son of a bitch!

222
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,965
Gringo... bastard!

223
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:17,030
Hey!

224
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:24,518
Duck, you sucker!

225
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:36,773
- Say, which way is it to Lucanina?
- Fuck you! Go find it yourself!

226
00:41:37,779 --> 00:41:42,449
Mexico is big,
but for you, it is going to be very big!

227
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:32,841
<i>John, where are you? It's us!</i>

228
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,391
Come on, come on, you.

229
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,398
Come on in there.

230
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:50,915
Just a little further inside.

231
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,508
That's right, heathen bastards.

232
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,471
What's this?
You crazy? You talk to yourself now?

233
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:03,416
Oh, my friend, didn't I tell you Mexico was big?

234
00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:09,252
Oh, shit.

235
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,983
Who are those people inside?

236
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:16,468
<i>You mean, who were those people inside?</i>

237
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:43,921
Who were they? Who were those people inside?

238
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:45,750
<i>Chulo!</i>

239
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:53,056
Who were those people, for Christ's sake?

240
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:58,362
Well, one of them was Aschenbach,
then there was three soldiers and one captain.

241
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,230
Everybody dead in there.

242
00:45:01,459 --> 00:45:04,984
Will you keep quiet
and go get our friend's equipment together?

243
00:45:06,379 --> 00:45:11,900
Anyway, when I went to Aschenbach
and I told him,

244
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,089
I said you wanted to see him,
he wouldn't believe that.

245
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,446
I said, "That's too bad
because he's discovered silver. "

246
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:21,575
Then he was ready to come running.

247
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:26,765
The other one, the captain... I think the captain
and Aschenbach were working together.

248
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,783
The captain says, "I want to see the man. "

249
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:36,806
I said, "How can you see him? He's blown off
his hand with dynamite, he is bleeding to death. "

250
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,246
When they heard that,
they broke their asses to get here.

251
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,511
Anyway, it's no problem because
there are diamonds here, no questions.

252
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,846
Also, you have no contract, so... you are free.

253
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:56,201
There will be one little problem, with the army.

254
00:45:56,459 --> 00:46:01,281
They will have a hot ass
when it comes to the death of a captain.

255
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,253
But don't worry.
I am your friend Juan and I will help.

256
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:07,721
I will do anything, say anything...

257
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:13,035
No, no, no. I don't need any help from you
to know I've been screwed.

258
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,892
You fuckin' chicken thief.

259
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:26,798
What do you want with me?

260
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:31,849
Nothing.

261
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,256
I just thought that maybe...

262
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,857
...we could go to Mesa Verde.

263
00:46:44,899 --> 00:46:48,652
The bank. Isn't there anything else
you remember about Mesa Verde?

264
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,889
Yes, there's a place
where you can sit down and eat.

265
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,897
- When you look in front, you...
- See the bank.

266
00:46:56,139 --> 00:46:58,201
That's right. How do you know?

267
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,151
Listen, Mesa Verde, that's only the beginning.

268
00:47:03,419 --> 00:47:09,781
<i>Let me tell you, it will be Juan and John,
the two especialistas in banks, eh?</i>

269
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:15,351
We'll call it Johnny and Johnny.
That's more American.

270
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:18,990
<i>Amigo, we go to America,
there are banks all over the place.</i>

271
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,588
In California, Colorado,
Kansas City, Texas and Austin.

272
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:27,453
You have to think of the big future
that we have ahead of us.

273
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,497
I'm thinking of the big train behind us.

274
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,609
Hey! Out of the way!

275
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,431
Hey, you.

276
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:10,906
I know that face.

277
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:14,114
Where have I seen you before?

278
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,049
<i>Stop right where you are!</i>

279
00:51:52,139 --> 00:51:54,049
Drop that knife, you bastard.

280
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,474
I have family.

281
00:52:27,499 --> 00:52:29,409
I have a family too.

282
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:23,034
Beautiful, eh?

283
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:25,364
<i>My children!</i>

284
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:36,228
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno, dos, uno, dos!
¡Pelotón... izquierda!</i>

285
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:41,103
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno, dos, uno, dos!</i>

286
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,798
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno, dos, uno, dos!</i>

287
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:24,089
<i>¿Tienen algo qué pedir?</i>

288
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,158
<i>¿Ytu?</i>

289
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:04,434
<i>Listos.</i>

290
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:14,964
<i>¡Armas!</i>

291
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,674
<i>¡Preparen!</i>

292
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,049
<i>Apunten.</i>

293
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:38,529
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

294
00:56:48,699 --> 00:56:51,951
Hey, God, you're sure this is Mesa Verde?

295
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,540
Do you have your beans with chilli?

296
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:37,038
I don't want nothing from you.

297
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,817
- Aw, come on, have some beans.
- Listen, you son of a bitch!

298
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,929
You pull that trick on me again,
I break your goddamn head!

299
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,881
Well, for Christ's sake.

300
00:58:50,179 --> 00:58:52,318
A train comes along and I take it.

301
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:56,642
- Been waiting in your Mesa Verde ever since.
- It's not my Mesa Verde.

302
00:58:56,939 --> 00:59:01,686
- This place is covered with soldiers like flies.
- Just the way we like it.

303
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,107
Just the way we like it?

304
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:12,199
If it's a revolution... it's confusion.

305
00:59:56,299 --> 00:59:59,016
What are you talking about?
Revolution, confusion?

306
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,932
Where there's confusion,
a man who knows what he wants...

307
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:09,435
...stands a good chance of getting it.
- I don't understand you.

308
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,434
This him?

309
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,009
That's him.

310
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,856
Him who?

311
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:35,164
- Do you trust me?
- No.

312
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:38,369
<i>- You want to get inside there?
- Sí.</i>

313
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:43,333
Well, I'm going to see to it
you have that chance. Come on.

314
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,649
<i>Don't move, goddamn it!
Hold him still.</i>

315
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,537
That does it. Relax now. Relax.

316
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:44,907
It's all over.

317
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:51,312
If you'd let this infection go any longer,
your widow would be paying my bill.

318
01:01:58,139 --> 01:01:59,666
Mallory!

319
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,300
You've hardly joined us here in Mesa Verde.

320
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,791
Already, you're front-page news.

321
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,169
"Irish dynamiter wanted for murder. "

322
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:20,420
You have a real talent for making friends.

323
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:24,456
<i>You've stirred up a hornet's nest.</i>

324
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,692
I'll grant you the captain, but...

325
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:33,340
...till now, nobody dared
take a crack at foreign capitalists.

326
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,765
Not even Pancho Villa.

327
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:42,649
It seems even His Majesty's Secret Service
would like to get their hands on you.

328
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,231
And yet, you are an asset to us.

329
01:02:48,019 --> 01:02:51,467
Even if sometimes, you do drink a bit too much.

330
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:53,801
Who says I drink too much?

331
01:02:55,299 --> 01:02:56,826
Your liver does.

332
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,354
What about that one, him?

333
01:03:00,499 --> 01:03:02,299
He's all right.

334
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,566
Except that when operating,
he cuts deeper than I do.

335
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:10,987
What the doctor means is,
one time we did a little work together.

336
01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:14,361
And now, to our work, friends.

337
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,449
I have good news.

338
01:03:18,659 --> 01:03:23,984
In two days, Villa and Zapata
will attack simultaneously from north and south.

339
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:31,134
We here, like those in other cities,
must begin parallel actions of harassment.

340
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:34,297
Pereto's downfall is just a question of weeks.

341
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:39,904
Whereas Miguel's is only a question of hours
if he doesn't stop smoking.

342
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:42,511
Easy to say.

343
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:50,210
We'll attack in four places at the same time.
Antonio, you hit the city hall and old prisons.

344
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:55,682
You will need to divide into two groups,
one of them under the command of José.

345
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:00,428
Jesús, the railway station
and the marshalling yards as planned, right?

346
01:04:00,739 --> 01:04:04,875
Get in position in good time in small groups,
so you won't attract attention.

347
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,321
And act like ordinary travellers,
or railroad employees.

348
01:04:08,579 --> 01:04:13,522
You, Manolo, together with Juanito, will attack
the army barracks with our main forces, agreed?

349
01:04:14,739 --> 01:04:20,827
This is their point of maximum concentration,
and is the key to the success of our plan.

350
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:24,471
You must create
the impression of a massive attack.

351
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:28,110
And if necessary,
be prepared to make the final sacrifice.

352
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:32,664
The fourth and last target,
Ortega, the post office.

353
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,857
When the enemy is busy on four fronts,

354
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,474
we'll move against our real objective.

355
01:04:41,499 --> 01:04:43,714
Do we still agree?

356
01:04:45,859 --> 01:04:49,733
- You'll need men.
- I only need one man.

357
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:53,569
One?

358
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,656
<i>Sí.</i>

359
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,310
Him?

360
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,012
Him? Him?

361
01:05:02,219 --> 01:05:07,467
What is with this "him"? Him who? Who him?
To do what? That's what I want to know!

362
01:05:07,819 --> 01:05:10,230
To attack the bank.

363
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,431
The bank?

364
01:05:14,659 --> 01:05:17,190
We will take care of the bank.

365
01:05:17,419 --> 01:05:20,594
That's why we're here,
so don't worry about that.

366
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:25,231
Well, then, what can I say?

367
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:29,042
Except... I hope you make it.

368
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:32,332
Me too. And him.

369
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:38,574
Well, we'll meet again tonight to discuss details.
I have to go now.

370
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:43,963
I left a woman in labour
and she can't wait till the revolution is over.

371
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:50,308
<i>- Tierra y libertad.
- ¡Tierra y libertad!</i>

372
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:54,856
Leave one at a time and keep out of sight.

373
01:05:55,139 --> 01:05:57,092
Speaking of sight, how's your cataract?

374
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:00,442
At least I have a good eye. With the other...

375
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,569
Shh! You don't have to say anything.

376
01:06:05,539 --> 01:06:07,830
I understand everything.

377
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,986
<i>¡Tierra y libertad!</i>

378
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,162
<i>Ylibertad.</i>

379
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:41,195
<i>¡Capitán! ¡Avíselas, Capitán!</i>

380
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:44,194
<i>¡Pronto! ¡Hola, muénvase!</i>

381
01:08:05,019 --> 01:08:07,234
Go.

382
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:10,547
<i>Psst, psst! ¡Oye!</i>

383
01:08:16,019 --> 01:08:17,929
Bravo, Chulo.

384
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,678
Take it, take it.

385
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:40,294
There must be a lot of money in the bank,
look at all those soldiers.

386
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:50,275
<i>- You know how this works?
- Sí. It's a...</i>

387
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,369
...short fuse.

388
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:56,369
- No.
- No?

389
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,216
Normal rate.

390
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,143
30 seconds.

391
01:09:02,259 --> 01:09:05,020
<i>Sí. 30 seconds.</i>

392
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,652
- What did you find?
- Nothing but scrap paper.

393
01:10:14,099 --> 01:10:17,198
Wait a minute. Hey, it's pointing down there.

394
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:34,194
Psst!

395
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,329
There is the safe!

396
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:19,089
Duck, you suckers!

397
01:13:57,419 --> 01:14:02,482
- Where are you going, for Christ's sake?
- I don't know, but something's wrong.

398
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:06,420
I went into the bank.
There's no money there, nothing.

399
01:14:06,699 --> 01:14:10,605
The bank and the money were transferred
to Mexico City a month ago.

400
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:14,620
They've been using this place
for a political prison ever since.

401
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,897
- What? A political prison?
- I never said a thing about money.

402
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:24,354
All I asked was if you wanted to get inside.

403
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:27,948
But this bank is my life, this is my dream.

404
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:35,541
The reality is, you've just liberated 150 patriots
through sheer courage in the face of danger.

405
01:14:43,219 --> 01:14:45,401
Ah, yes...

406
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:50,801
...you're a grand hero of the revolution now.

407
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:56,089
<i>- I Vívela, Juan!
- I don't want to be a hero. I want the money!</i>

408
01:14:56,379 --> 01:14:57,950
The money!

409
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:02,391
- You taught me one thing.
- What?

410
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,591
How to get fucked!

411
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:32,322
- What's that?
- It's a map.

412
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,108
It's your country you're lying all over.

413
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:43,868
Not my country.
My country is me and my family.

414
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:46,634
Well, your country's also Huerta...

415
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,645
...and the Governor and landlords.

416
01:16:50,499 --> 01:16:52,834
And Gunther Ruiz and his locusts.

417
01:16:53,939 --> 01:16:56,427
- This little revolution we're having here.
- Revolution?

418
01:16:56,659 --> 01:17:01,525
Please don't try to tell me about revolution!
I know how revolutions start.

419
01:17:01,859 --> 01:17:05,808
People that read books
go to people that don't read books and say,

420
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,162
- "The time has come for change. "
- Shh!

421
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,911
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shit, shush!

422
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:15,395
I know what I'm talking about
when I'm talking about revolutions!

423
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:20,686
The people who read books go to the people
who can't read and say, "We need change,"

424
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:23,082
so the poor people make the change.

425
01:17:23,299 --> 01:17:28,667
The people who read the books sit around
big polished tables and talk and talk and eat.

426
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:31,812
But what has happened to the poor people?

427
01:17:32,739 --> 01:17:34,844
They are dead!

428
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:38,849
That's your revolution.

429
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,500
Shh.

430
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:51,649
So please, don't tell me about revolutions.

431
01:18:02,539 --> 01:18:05,758
Then what happens?
The same fucking thing starts all over again!

432
01:18:46,099 --> 01:18:48,358
<i>¡Capitán!</i>

433
01:19:02,299 --> 01:19:04,558
<i>¡Vamos!</i>

434
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,849
I don't like it either.

435
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:26,657
Only Gunther Ruiz is less than 20 miles
from here, on the road that leads to that bridge.

436
01:19:27,019 --> 01:19:29,812
They will comb the area bush by bush.

437
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:34,041
So the order is to pull back,
hide in the San Ysidro caves.

438
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:36,249
Oh, that's a brilliant order.

439
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:40,293
Here we are, facing it.

440
01:19:41,379 --> 01:19:45,744
You, and the rest of you dreamers,
want to piss it up against the wall!

441
01:19:46,059 --> 01:19:48,274
Not everybody can fight.

442
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,714
There are those who must organise,
co-ordinate.

443
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:52,849
Yes, yes, of course.

444
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,565
Yeah, well...

445
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,689
...don't pay any attention to me.

446
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:03,427
It's personal.

447
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:16,263
Sorry about those orders. I'm staying.

448
01:20:18,019 --> 01:20:20,474
I don't give a fuck about your revolutions.

449
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:25,522
I'm tired of running up and down these
mountains and getting nowhere, so I've stopped.

450
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:28,881
Right here, at the bridge of San Jorge.

451
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:35,831
Maybe it's out of spite for you
and your slow dream, or maybe...

452
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,194
Ah, maybe my feet are sore.

453
01:20:48,739 --> 01:20:54,914
<i>If he's gonna stay, I'm gonna stay.
Maybe 'cause my feet are sore too, huh?</i>

454
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:03,014
<i>¡Hombres! Me and irlandés are gonna catch
ourselves a couple of fucking locusts.</i>

455
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:08,027
<i>¡Atente! You go back and hide in the grotto.</i>

456
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:12,020
If things go bad here, every man for himself.

457
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,940
<i>You move your asses! ¿Comprenden?</i>

458
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:50,486
If something happens
and your father doesn't come back,

459
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:54,955
then I pray that the great God in heaven
takes care of you.

460
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,424
Well... Good luck.

461
01:22:22,699 --> 01:22:24,226
Thank you.

462
01:22:46,699 --> 01:22:51,489
<i>Listen, when they are out of sight,
we will make a run for it. ¿Sí?</i>

463
01:22:59,059 --> 01:23:04,580
No? You can't mean to stay here? All those
explosions must have gone to your head!

464
01:23:08,499 --> 01:23:11,870
Remember John and Juan?

465
01:23:13,459 --> 01:23:15,107
America.

466
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,823
The millions.

467
01:23:18,419 --> 01:23:20,100
No?

468
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:22,391
No.

469
01:23:23,459 --> 01:23:27,179
I don't understand!
Wasn't that was a trick for us to get out?

470
01:23:27,459 --> 01:23:32,020
- What can we do against those locusts?
- You'd be doing me a favour if you'd leave.

471
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:37,937
If I had a choice between a chicken thief
and ridding the world of a few uniforms,

472
01:23:38,299 --> 01:23:40,404
I'd not choose the chicken thief.

473
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:44,591
OK.

474
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:49,582
OK.

475
01:23:50,899 --> 01:23:52,470
No!

476
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:58,038
Oh, no, no. You will like that, huh?

477
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:05,301
Well, you listen to me, you Irish piece of shit!

478
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:10,737
You think you're the only man
with the balls to stay? You are wrong!

479
01:24:11,059 --> 01:24:14,278
I have the balls and I stay.

480
01:24:32,899 --> 01:24:37,230
He says there's no danger,
just watch the bridge from a long way.

481
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:43,217
No matter how I look with them,
I'm still too close to the bridge.

482
01:24:44,419 --> 01:24:47,409
Why am I mixed up in this revolution anyway?

483
01:24:47,659 --> 01:24:53,256
God, why didn't you strike me down
instead of letting me say, "I stay too"?

484
01:24:54,419 --> 01:24:57,944
Oh, look at him! All because of him.

485
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:00,860
He acts like a tourist, only he's staying.

486
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,391
<i>Look at him.</i>

487
01:25:03,619 --> 01:25:06,107
What the hell does he care?

488
01:25:06,339 --> 01:25:08,598
He is having fun.

489
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:12,998
I'm glad he's having fun, God,
because I am not having fun.

490
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,253
Oh-ho, no.

491
01:25:18,939 --> 01:25:20,084
Hey...

492
01:25:21,459 --> 01:25:23,641
What's this?

493
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:30,325
Now he goes to sleep, huh?

494
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:34,267
Go ahead, you sleep, sleep.

495
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:38,856
I tell you something, when he's asleep, I'll go.
Shh!

496
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:44,943
May the good Lord watch over you.

497
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,685
Stop over there, Sergeant.

498
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:01,263
Hey!

499
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:08,857
God, only an idiot could sleep at a time like this!

500
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:14,674
Hey!

501
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:48,900
Abandon the trucks!
Break ranks and take cover under the bridge!

502
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:52,049
Artillery, fire. The bridge!

503
01:34:00,019 --> 01:34:02,124
All of them.

504
01:34:04,419 --> 01:34:06,601
Six.

505
01:34:10,059 --> 01:34:13,278
I've never counted them before.

506
01:35:54,859 --> 01:35:57,041
No, Juan, no.

507
01:35:57,260 --> 01:36:00,555
No, for Christ's sake.
They're waiting for you out there.

508
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:42,965
<i>¡No se mueven!</i>

509
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:45,089
<i>¡Capitán!</i>

510
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:51,340
<i>Hold it!
Move that bastard out of the truck.</i>

511
01:38:51,620 --> 01:38:54,380
<i>See that he gets to the camp alive!</i>

512
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:58,718
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno!</i>

513
01:42:07,659 --> 01:42:11,336
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno, dos!</i>

514
01:42:16,179 --> 01:42:19,126
<i>¡Uno, dos, uno, dos, uno, dos!</i>

515
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:23,457
<i>¡Pelotón alto!</i>

516
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:26,922
<i>¡Izquierda!</i>

517
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:29,009
<i>¡Posición de tiro!</i>

518
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:37,551
<i>¿Tienen algo qué pedir?</i>

519
01:42:43,299 --> 01:42:45,481
<i>Pelotón...</i>

520
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:50,965
<i>¡Preparen!</i>

521
01:42:51,180 --> 01:42:53,209
<i>¡Armas!</i>

522
01:42:54,299 --> 01:42:56,175
<i>¡Apunten!</i>

523
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:34,649
<i>¿Tienes algo qué pedir?</i>

524
01:47:24,060 --> 01:47:26,274
<i>¡Posición de tiro!</i>

525
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:34,559
<i>¡Preparen armas!</i>

526
01:47:38,059 --> 01:47:39,281
<i>¡Apunten!</i>

527
01:47:39,459 --> 01:47:41,369
<i>Duck, you suckers!</i>

528
01:50:23,059 --> 01:50:26,081
<i>¡Preparen! ¡Armas!</i>

529
01:50:32,860 --> 01:50:34,201
<i>¡Apunten!</i>

530
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:35,525
<i>¡Fuego!</i>

531
01:52:45,179 --> 01:52:47,514
But for the rich, you sing.

532
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:03,319
Oh, Jesus, Juan.

533
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:13,526
Anyway, if they ever get this thing under way,
you might be able to...

534
01:53:13,859 --> 01:53:18,922
...might be make the border by, what,
some time tonight, don't you think?

535
01:53:23,140 --> 01:53:27,014
America. It's America, Juan!

536
01:53:28,139 --> 01:53:32,046
Oh, Jesus, if it's as great as they say it is,

537
01:53:32,340 --> 01:53:34,554
filled bags stuffed full of dreams...

538
01:53:34,780 --> 01:53:36,580
Juan?

539
01:53:40,940 --> 01:53:43,395
Oh, Jesus.

540
01:53:46,659 --> 01:53:48,994
Jesus, Juan.

541
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:54,548
What is it, Juan and... John?

542
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:59,027
Johnny and Johnny?

543
01:53:59,259 --> 01:54:03,285
I make the holes and you get in. 50-50, right?

544
01:55:24,419 --> 01:55:26,295
What's happening?

545
01:55:27,059 --> 01:55:29,929
Oh, they're just moving the train around.

546
01:55:30,739 --> 01:55:32,954
Seems we'll be leaving shortly.

547
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:37,446
The uniforms have loaded the last of their shit.

548
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:32,030
Get out of the way.

549
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:43,761
What do you want from me, you scum?

550
01:58:44,019 --> 01:58:45,743
Let me by.

551
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:32,605
It's yours.

552
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:38,892
There's a fortune inside.

553
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:42,052
Money, jewels...

554
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:45,500
...pearls.

555
02:02:28,419 --> 02:02:30,786
<i>¡Jóvenes, a México!</i>

556
02:02:57,779 --> 02:03:01,500
Well, this will not be going to America.

557
02:03:01,780 --> 02:03:04,616
<i>Maybe the train won't, but we will.</i>

558
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:19,489
Hey...

559
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:23,332
Which way is America?

560
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:32,340
Well, it's sure as hell not that way.
That's the way.

561
02:03:36,459 --> 02:03:38,751
Well, then...

562
02:03:44,740 --> 02:03:46,649
...let's go.

563
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:06,657
Even Pancho Villa's heard much about you.

564
02:04:06,899 --> 02:04:10,270
He's always saying,
"I want to meet this Miranda. "

565
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:16,249
Me?

566
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:19,645
That's right.

567
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:23,537
<i>The military junta commander
told us everything that you've done.</i>

568
02:04:23,820 --> 02:04:27,148
Whatever you heard, I assure you,
they were only words.

569
02:04:28,299 --> 02:04:32,281
Words cannot describe
what Juan has done and suffered for the cause.

570
02:04:35,019 --> 02:04:37,278
Hey, doctor.

571
02:04:38,979 --> 02:04:41,161
How you been, eh?

572
02:04:41,979 --> 02:04:45,121
This is a man who should talk to Villa.

573
02:04:46,580 --> 02:04:48,947
Hey.

574
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:53,449
John.

575
02:04:56,939 --> 02:04:59,001
Doctor.

576
02:05:02,739 --> 02:05:04,954
We thought we'd lost you, doctor.

577
02:05:21,860 --> 02:05:24,042
Have you got a light?

578
02:05:28,059 --> 02:05:32,696
Listen, Gunther Ruiz is after us
and Villa wants to talk to me.

579
02:05:33,019 --> 02:05:35,201
We should get outta here.

580
02:05:36,459 --> 02:05:42,286
Jesus, Juan, you can't leave now.
You're a glorious hero of the revolution.

581
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:44,263
Can I tell you something?

582
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:46,369
Fuck you!

583
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:53,682
That's all.

584
02:06:06,899 --> 02:06:11,810
A military train carrying over 1,000 soldiers and
heavy weapons is heading straight towards us.

585
02:06:12,139 --> 02:06:14,550
What about Villa's troops?

586
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:19,602
He met resistance in the Sierra,
and asks us to hold out for 24 hours.

587
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:31,333
- Where the hell are we?
- Approximately here.

588
02:06:32,900 --> 02:06:35,583
Ah, it's a beautiful desert there.

589
02:06:35,819 --> 02:06:38,427
Not a stream or a canyon in 100 miles.

590
02:06:38,660 --> 02:06:43,297
- How long you think it'll take them to get here?
- Three hours, more or less.

591
02:06:43,620 --> 02:06:45,453
Three hours.

592
02:06:58,020 --> 02:07:02,766
Well, it looks as though
we'll have to stop 'em right here, doesn't it?

593
02:07:04,539 --> 02:07:07,791
All that takes
is unbolting a couple of yards of track.

594
02:07:08,059 --> 02:07:11,048
But then what? They'd still slaughter us.

595
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:12,565
Wait.

596
02:07:12,739 --> 02:07:15,609
There's more than one way to stop a train.

597
02:07:17,220 --> 02:07:20,624
- How much dynamite have we?
- Maybe 200 Ibs.

598
02:07:20,900 --> 02:07:23,158
Is that enough for you?

599
02:07:24,539 --> 02:07:27,332
Oh, yes. It'll have to do all right.

600
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:32,733
<i>- But I also need a locomotive and a man.
- Sí, sí, sí. OK.</i>

601
02:07:34,939 --> 02:07:36,543
OK.

602
02:07:36,739 --> 02:07:42,369
- Someone who's brave and loyal to the cause.
- Never mind that. What do I have to do?

603
02:07:44,539 --> 02:07:46,372
Someone like Dr Villega.

604
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:55,508
Well...

605
02:07:56,779 --> 02:08:01,067
<i>- I... I'm honoured.
- I don't doubt it, doctor.</i>

606
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:06,355
Also, because an old friend of ours
is in command of that train.

607
02:08:06,659 --> 02:08:08,612
A Colonel Gunther Ruiz.

608
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:19,955
<i>Let's get shovelling, man.
We'll never get up enough pressure that way.</i>

609
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:36,846
Come on, put your back in it, Villega.

610
02:09:45,340 --> 02:09:49,671
Let's stop pretending, right away.
You know everything, don't you?

611
02:09:49,980 --> 02:09:54,387
- You sensed it, or guessed it.
- Simpler than that, Villega.

612
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:58,225
I saw you, that night in the rain.

613
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:12,321
I see.
You've already judged and condemned me.

614
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:25,937
That's why you brought me with you. To kill me.

615
02:10:27,140 --> 02:10:30,740
It's easy to judge. Have you ever been tortured?

616
02:10:31,020 --> 02:10:35,504
Are you sure you wouldn't talk?
I was sure. And yet I talked.

617
02:10:36,940 --> 02:10:41,500
Some men died because of me.
What should I do? Kill myself? Why?

618
02:10:41,820 --> 02:10:44,656
The dead remain dead, but I have not changed.

619
02:10:44,900 --> 02:10:49,231
I still believe in the same things.
I can still serve the cause.

620
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:52,409
Shut up, Villega! Shut up, for Christ's sake.

621
02:12:57,859 --> 02:13:03,762
When I started using dynamite,
I believed in many things. All of it!

622
02:13:05,740 --> 02:13:07,998
Finally, I believe only in dynamite.

623
02:13:09,099 --> 02:13:11,009
I don't judge you, Villega.

624
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:16,722
I did that only once in my life.

625
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:20,239
Get shovelling!

626
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:55,340
<i>The end of the line, Villega.</i>

627
02:14:58,060 --> 02:15:00,242
And I can't help you now.

628
02:15:14,700 --> 02:15:17,493
Just close your eyes and jump.

629
02:15:24,859 --> 02:15:27,467
For Christ's sake, save yourself!

630
02:15:44,899 --> 02:15:47,463
<i>¡Dios mío, frena!</i>

631
02:19:27,539 --> 02:19:29,340
Oh, shit...

632
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:34,656
God...

633
02:20:51,179 --> 02:20:53,055
Hey.

634
02:20:53,259 --> 02:20:56,401
Man, remember, huh?

635
02:20:58,459 --> 02:21:00,990
You remember what you told me, huh?

636
02:21:01,739 --> 02:21:04,303
You told me about America.

637
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:09,126
And the banks and the gold.

638
02:21:09,419 --> 02:21:12,747
Like you told me on the train, remember?

639
02:21:17,099 --> 02:21:19,161
Hey, hey.

640
02:21:20,620 --> 02:21:22,802
Hey.

641
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:29,667
No, you son of a bitch. Come on,
you son of a bitch. You know, you told me that.

642
02:21:30,019 --> 02:21:34,078
You leave me now,
what the fuck is gonna happen to me?

643
02:21:36,540 --> 02:21:41,134
- You'll make it, General.
- Oh, shit, I don't want to be a general.

644
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:49,554
Come on, talk to me.

645
02:21:49,779 --> 02:21:51,427
Keep talking.

646
02:21:51,620 --> 02:21:55,373
Talk. Tell me about Villega, Villega.
Remember Villega?

647
02:21:55,659 --> 02:21:57,841
<i>- Villega?
- Sí.</i>

648
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:01,191
He died.

649
02:22:02,659 --> 02:22:05,758
He died a great...

650
02:22:06,940 --> 02:22:10,497
...grand, glorious hero of the revolution.

651
02:22:29,300 --> 02:22:31,100
OK.

652
02:22:31,979 --> 02:22:36,649
Easy, easy. I'll go, I'll get help, huh?

653
02:22:42,979 --> 02:22:44,627
General?

654
02:22:50,580 --> 02:22:52,489
<i>- Have you a light?
- Sí.</i>

655
02:23:29,980 --> 02:23:32,238
Oh, my friend...

656
02:23:33,579 --> 02:23:36,569
...I'd hate to give you a royal screwing.

657
02:24:03,339 --> 02:24:05,249
I go get help.

658
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:57,395
Johnny!

659
02:28:43,220 --> 02:28:45,434
<i>What about me?</i>
