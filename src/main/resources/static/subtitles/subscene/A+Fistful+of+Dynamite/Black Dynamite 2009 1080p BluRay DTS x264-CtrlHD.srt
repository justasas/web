1
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,444
Leon St. James
for Anaconda Malt Liquor.

2
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,614
With the delectable combination
of the finest barleys and hops...

3
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,241
it's the only malt liquor...

4
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:36,452
that carries the seal of excellence
from Uncle Sam himself.

5
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:43,126
And when you pop the top,
the panties drop.

6
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,796
Is that Anaconda Malt Liquor?

7
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:51,092
The only malt liquor to be approved
by the United States government?

8
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,512
That's right. Anaconda Malt Liquor.

9
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,819
Anaconda Malt Liquor,
brewed in Piedmont, Georgia.

10
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,685
Gentlemen, every one of you
are the most respected men...

11
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,274
Doing business with me,
you'll find you'll be protected...

12
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:52,695
and you will be supplied
with as much as you can distribute.

13
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:58,159
However, one of us here
is not who he appears to be.

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,373
Come on, you jive turkeys.

15
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,918
What kind of rundown is this?

16
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,337
Look, man...

17
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:13,299
I gotta get back to the streets
where I come from, sucker.

18
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,009
Hold it.

19
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:20,223
I told you jive chumps,
I ain't no snitch.

20
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,641
Who said you were?

21
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,745
He's dead.

22
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,709
My God, men.

23
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,628
Do you know what this means?

24
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,589
Do you know whose brother...?

25
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,636
This ghetto is gonna be turned
upside-down, I tell you, upside-down.

26
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:02,598
The streets are gonna run crimson
with the blood of the men...

27
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,600
responsible
for his brother's death.

28
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:07,603
Man I am speaking of
is a veritable one-man army.

29
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,648
And if you get on his bad side,
brother, you're done for.

30
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:13,109
It's only a matter of time
before he finds out...

31
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,528
and when he does,
no matter where he is...

32
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,947
get ready, gentlemen,
because hell's a-coming.

33
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,491
Coming, coming, coming.

34
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,797
Black Dynamite,
that was the best loving I ever had.

35
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,632
Me too.

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,259
That goes triple for me.

37
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:42,388
Mama, you're gonna waske up
the rest of the bitches.

38
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,934
I wanna tell you a story
about a friend I've had.

39
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:50,313
He's a mean motherfucker
and he's super bad.

40
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,275
So grab on to your seats
and hang on tight...

41
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:57,486
while I tell you a story
about Black Dynamite.

42
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,310
Yeah?

43
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,063
Dynamite, baby,
Nipsy still ain't paid up.

44
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,857
Solid. I'm on it, Bee.

45
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,035
Who's there?

46
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,454
I'm looking for Nipsy.

47
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,708
There's no Nipsy here.

48
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,966
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

49
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,634
Where's Nipsy?

50
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,386
Here I am, sucker.

51
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,090
Honeybee,
what's happening, baby?

52
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,635
Black Dynamite.
What did you do to Nipsy?

53
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,888
Now, word on the street
is that he's gonna be in traction.

54
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,475
You know me. I just talked to him.

55
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,187
Thank you, Black Dynamite.

56
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,897
I'm so happy.

57
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,401
Hey, they mess with you, Mama,
they're messing with me.

58
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,487
Black Dynamite, I wanna thank you
for taking care of us girls...

59
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,115
while we was down and out
and didn't have no pimp.

60
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,492
I almost forgot.

61
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,203
Ain't nobody seen Pimpin' Jake
for two days...

62
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,789
and he ain't been by here
with your money.

63
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,000
- And...
- I knew I forgot something.

64
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,835
Tiny.

65
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,087
Get Pimpin' Jake out of my trunk.

66
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,215
Tell him the rest by Wednesday
or I'll make him stick himself.

67
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,967
I'm sorry. Go on, Bee.

68
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,971
They replaced the chain on your
nunchucks and oiled the bearings.

69
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,933
They're sitting there on your desk,
next to the dry cleaning.

70
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,661
All right. What's wrong, Honeybee?

71
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,663
I've known you too long.

72
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,167
Now, if something's bothering you,
why don't you lay it on me?

73
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,837
Black Dynamite,
I got to go to the hospital.

74
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,965
It's my little nephew, Bucky.
He OD'd.

75
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,427
Where is Bucky
and what has he had?

76
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,679
It's that new drug on the street.

77
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,682
All the kids are falling prey to it.

78
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,311
What we gonna do,
Black Dynamite?

79
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,690
I know what I'm gonna do.

80
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,651
I'm gonna fight.

81
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,694
The only way I know how.

82
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,490
Ever since I was a boy,
all I knew was how to fight.

83
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,283
Fight, fight, fight.

84
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,538
And when I got tired,
I would fight some more.

85
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,541
And now that the Man
has got our backs to the wall...

86
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,252
I ain't gonna let him hurt the kids.

87
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,629
I'm gonna take him down.

88
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,549
I'm gonna take them all down.

89
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,692
Who the hell is interrupting
my kung fu?

90
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,992
- Who the hell is this?
- Black Dynamite, it's your Aunt Billy.

91
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,244
How many times
I told you not to call here...

92
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,704
and interrupt my kung fu?

93
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,290
It's bad news, Dynamite.

94
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,126
It's your only brother, Jimmy.

95
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,629
He's dead, Dynamite.

96
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,797
Jimmy's dead.

97
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,011
Scram.

98
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,554
I said split.

99
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,224
Shake the scene, you turkeys.
Get out of my house.

100
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,392
I'll see you all tomorrow.

101
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,145
How did it happen, Aunt Billy?

102
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:27,233
They found him shot full of holes
in an old shipping yard.

103
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,901
Dead as a dog.

104
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,362
Said he had drugs on him.

105
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,365
I guess he was still on that stuff.

106
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,826
Now, I thought you promised
your mama on her deathbed...

107
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,705
you wass gonna get him
off that stuff, Black Dynamite.

108
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,916
Whoever did this is gonna pay.

109
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,584
I can promise you that.

110
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,545
Well, I hope it ain't like
when you promised your mama...

111
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,839
you wass gonna get him
off of that stuff...

112
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,759
for the rest of his natural life...

113
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:07,439
Black Dynamite,
I want you to promise me...

114
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,401
that you'll look after your brother...

115
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:15,990
and make sure
he doesn't end up on drugs...

116
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,117
or dead.

117
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,453
I promise.

118
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,917
Jimmy, I am 18-year-old
Black Dynamite...

119
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,378
and you are my 16... year-old
kid brother...

120
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,298
and you are high
as a kite yet again.

121
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,258
Who gave you the drugs, Jimmy?

122
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,801
Who?

123
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,901
Your mama would turn over
in her grave...

124
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,571
if she were here to see this.

125
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,907
She loved Jimmy with all her heart.

126
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,619
You promised your mama
on her deathbed...

127
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,913
that you would look after Jimmy.

128
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,583
Now he's dead.

129
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,468
I scoured the crime scene
like you told me to.

130
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,470
Dig what I found.

131
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:27,644
Now, this is some heavy shit.

132
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,019
Freeze, turkeys.

133
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,690
I see you haven't lost your touch,
B.D.

134
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,901
O'Leary?

135
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,658
The old "pie on the windowsill" trick.
I can't believe I fell for that.

136
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,412
That was the same trap you used
in Nam to save my ass.

137
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,499
B.D. Took our fatigues
and put them on two dead gooks.

138
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,960
I remember we circled back
and turned the tables.

139
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,796
I guess you forgot about the time
you and Bravo company...

140
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,173
left my black ass for dead?

141
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,467
But I remember.

142
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,928
I remember everything.

143
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,264
I remember Vietnam
like it was yesterday.

144
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:50,352
I remember that village
in Tainan that we cut down.

145
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:53,313
It was a massacre.

146
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,693
All the dead Chinamen
we left in our tracks.

147
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:01,697
I remember the faces, the children.

148
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,783
This one child I'll never forget.

149
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,661
Poor little bastard was still alive.

150
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,831
His little Chinese legs
were blown clean off.

151
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,749
Still see his little shins and feet...

152
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,335
hanging from the ceiling fan
across the hut.

153
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,923
He was charred from his head down
to his little Chinese knees.

154
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,010
He tried to get up...

155
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,638
but he fell over when what wass left
of his right leg broke off.

156
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,935
As he laid there flat on his face...

157
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,271
he looked up at me.

158
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,232
His little Chinese eyes
burned right into my stomach...

159
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,568
deep into my soul.

160
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,530
He said something to me
in Chinese, like:

161
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,157
Sounds like some cartoon shit...

162
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,410
but I understood it to be a question
that he was asking me.

163
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,787
And I don't have to know
how to speak Chinese...

164
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,207
to know what that question was.

165
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,918
"Why, Black Dynamite?

166
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,669
Why?"

167
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,968
We're a long way from Nam.

168
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,178
Look at this place.

169
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,014
It must have an eight-track player
in every room.

170
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:14,061
What's going on today
is a smack problem of epic proportion.

171
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,814
Corruption is running rampant
and we don't know who to trust.

172
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,277
We need you, Black Dynamite,
now more than ever.

173
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,615
I know I was the best CIA agent
that the CIA ever had...

174
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,117
but I thought I told you honkies
from the CIA...

175
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,286
that Black Dynamite
was out of the game.

176
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:35,541
- You're never out of the game.
- I've known you for a long time.

177
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,960
And there's something
that you're not telling me.

178
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,130
Okay.

179
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:45,551
We heard about your brother's death.
The last thing we need...

180
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,637
is you running through the streets
creating a river of blood.

181
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,181
Tell me who did it
and I'll just leave a puddle.

182
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,100
We don't know who killed Jimmy.

183
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,269
But I do know this.

184
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,273
You step out of line, friendship or not,
and I'm gonna take you down.

185
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,567
In case you forgot,
when you left the agency...

186
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,610
you relinquished
your license to kill.

187
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,654
Well, you do what you have to.

188
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,156
Just don't get in my way.

189
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,699
Come on, give it up
to Afroditey and the Moonchild.

190
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,286
Give them a nice round of applause,
big round of applause, yeah.

191
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,998
Black Dynamite,
you came to see me.

192
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,584
Bitch, no, I gotta go rap a taste
with my man Horn...

193
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:04,046
but afterwards since I'm here,
maybe I'll throw you one right quick.

194
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,548
Out of sight.

195
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,967
I get off in 15 minutes.

196
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,470
You're right about that, sugar.

197
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,055
You're right about that.

198
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,062
Bullhorn, can I get you anything?

199
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,482
Yes. I would like some of that ass.

200
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,819
Yes, yes, yes.

201
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:35,911
Man, who dare knock
when I'm planning to plant my...?

202
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,039
Main man Black Dynamite.

203
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,916
What it is, Bullhorn?

204
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,584
What you want to eat, man?

205
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,296
Sister Betty made some hog maws
and, man, she put her ankle in it.

206
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,092
I ain't here for no food, Horn.

207
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,929
Man.

208
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,889
I can dig it.

209
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,393
Sugar, give us a minute.

210
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,943
You know, man...

211
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:11,113
I'm really sorry to hear
about what happened to Jimmy.

212
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,283
You know, me and you
been tight for a long time.

213
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:19,371
- So you know if you need anything...
- Thanks, Horn.

214
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,041
I need to know about the kind of cats
that Jimmy was running with.

215
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,086
You know, he came around here
about a week ago...

216
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:29,589
with some cats
that I had never seen before.

217
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,591
Man, I mean,
these cats looked mean.

218
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,053
Meaner than two fat motherfuckers
wrestling over pork chops and greens.

219
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,847
Can you dig it?

220
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,268
Yeah. I can dig it.

221
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,734
That little old half-a-player,
Cream Corn, was with them.

222
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,819
You remember Cream Corn.

223
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,826
So where is Cream Corn
these days?

224
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,327
Yep, that's right.

225
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,662
I'm running things.

226
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,751
Cream Corn.
That's why they call me that.

227
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,085
Smooth.

228
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,880
I got my measure for your pleasure.

229
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,841
Stick with me, baby,
I'll have you farting through silk.

230
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,468
And let a nigga mess with me.

231
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:19,514
I'll jump on him,
all 93 pounds of pure dynamite...

232
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,154
Let me catch my breath,
Black Dynamite.

233
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,864
Shut up, sucker. I need answers.

234
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,867
I wanna know who the cats were
that Jimmy was hanging with.

235
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:23,161
Man, I don't know nothing
but nothing.

236
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,413
Okay, all right, all right.

237
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,083
Their leader's name
is Chicago Wind.

238
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:32,087
They hang out at a place
called the Hip Pocket on Crenshaw.

239
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,089
Now, get me up.

240
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,523
So you must be Black Dynamite.

241
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,778
Cream Corn, you jive mother.

242
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,120
Chicago Wind, I presume.

243
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,539
Your presumption is correct, nigga.

244
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,792
If you presume that I killed
your brother then you presume wrong.

245
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,711
Not that it means shit to me.

246
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:16,256
Either way, shit.

247
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,384
I wish I'd have killed
that nigga myself.

248
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,553
Somebody else beat me to it.

249
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,305
Is that so?

250
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,807
Well, Mr. Chicago Wind...

251
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,602
what do you know about this?

252
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,482
Some heavy shit.

253
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,818
But dig.

254
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,323
Let me explain something to you,
supernigga.

255
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,325
I don't answer questions.

256
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,410
I ask them.

257
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,164
Even if I did know who killed
that brother of yours...

258
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,167
what would make you think
I'm gonna tell you?

259
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,130
Get your black ass out of my joint...

260
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,507
before we beat you
like a rented mule.

261
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,932
That's right, you jive-ass punk.

262
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,935
Don't be coming to the Hip Pocket
talking that shit, you dig?

263
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:13,396
That's right, nigga.
Don't ever, ever come ba...

264
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:39,107
Go catch Chicago Wind
before he disappears.

265
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:42,110
I'll take care
of this gorilla-eating goon here.

266
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:51,036
You's a corn-fed fool
with a lot of muscle mass.

267
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:56,291
But it's time for Bullhorn
to get up in that ass.

268
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,298
Motherfucker.

269
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,974
Let everybody know
and suckers be warned...

270
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:17,896
that this is the outcome
when you mess with Bullhorn.

271
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,658
Try to catch me now, sucker.

272
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,669
Motherfucker.

273
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:51,679
Now you know why they call me
Chicago Wind, fool.

274
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,892
Because I left your ass
blowing in the breeze.

275
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,728
Man, don't you ever, ever...

276
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:12,909
That black son of a bitch,
he killed my best dealer.

277
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:19,290
I want Black Dynamite dead,
and I wasnt him dead now.

278
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,293
Before you support
any of these candidates...

279
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,797
find out if they're going to rid
our communities...

280
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,258
of the hustlers and pushers.

281
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,761
Or are they gonna destroy all
the programs that help our children...

282
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:36,891
and give their corporate friends
free reign to exploit our community...

283
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,309
like Congressman James.

284
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,645
Watch me turn this shit around.

285
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,397
Power to the people.

286
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:46,818
With all due respect
to the young sister here...

287
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,653
you all know me.

288
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:49,904
Yes.

289
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:51,656
Now, young lady...

290
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:55,410
these fine folks
don't need to be misled.

291
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:57,620
All they want is a little bit of bread.

292
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,667
And you can't just stick it
to the Man.

293
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,128
You also
got to have yourself a plan.

294
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:12,010
Now, we got to take this
from the jukebox to the ballot box.

295
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:16,931
We got to go from the poor house
to the White House.

296
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,851
Instead of maligning me...

297
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,522
let's take this land
from sea to shining sea.

298
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,275
Keep the faith, brothers and sisters.

299
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,203
Say, Mama, you're gonna have
to work on your delivery...

300
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,622
if you wanna take on
Congressman James.

301
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,125
The shame is, half these people
don't know what y'all talking about...

302
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,920
but at least they can put his
to a beat.

303
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,339
So, what do you do
to make a difference?

304
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,175
Do you march? Do you vote?

305
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,593
Let me guess.

306
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,386
You're one of Tom Slick brothers...

307
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,473
think you can get by on good looks,
a wink and a smile?

308
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,642
I don't know about Tom Slick.

309
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,393
But thank you for the compliments.

310
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,437
That's not what I meant.

311
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,564
Not that I think
that you have good look...

312
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,359
I mean, you know these guys
with their...

313
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,654
- Winks and smiles.
- Yeah.

314
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,491
What about the smile?

315
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,160
I am smiling.

316
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,563
Right on, right on.

317
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,990
Excuse me, brothers.

318
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,284
The militants turn, startled.

319
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,493
This is private.

320
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,370
How'd you get in here?

321
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,038
I walked in.

322
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,874
So you one of them
sneaky brothers?

323
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,127
Or maybe you an undercover pig.

324
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:11,796
Or maybe you just a federal hit man.

325
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,966
If I was,
you cats would already be dead.

326
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:18,052
Now, let me speak
to the man in charge.

327
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,888
Sarcastically, I'm in charge.

328
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,557
Right on.

329
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,642
If you were in charge...

330
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,562
the people might as well surrender
to whitey right now...

331
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,398
because your survival skills
ain't worth a damn.

332
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:32,692
Black Dynamite.

333
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:36,070
It has been a long time, my brother.

334
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,406
What it is, Saheed?

335
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,117
You know this Uncle Tom?

336
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:42,910
Listen, sucker.

337
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,621
I'm blacker than the ace of spades
and more militant...

338
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,499
than you and your whole damn army
put together.

339
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,001
And while you're out there...

340
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,587
chanting at rallies
and browbeating politicians...

341
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:55,298
I'm taking out any money
front sucker on a humble...

342
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,549
that gets in my way.

343
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,426
So I'll tell you what.

344
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,888
When your so-called revolution starts,
you call me...

345
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:04,807
and I'll be right down front
showing you how it's done...

346
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,268
but until then,
you need to shut the fuck up...

347
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,145
when grown folks is talking.

348
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,777
I'm sorry.

349
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,239
Yeah, we heard about
what went down at the Hip Pocket.

350
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,450
That was righteous.

351
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,660
That was personal, brother.

352
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:29,165
Personal or not, you saved
a lot of brothers and sisters.

353
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,835
You need our help, we're here.

354
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,213
I can dig it.

355
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,550
What can you tell me about this?

356
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,053
Yeah.

357
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,266
I ain't seen one of these in a while.

358
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,313
I was gonna fuck him up.

359
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,579
There it is.

360
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,790
AR-48.

361
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,834
I wish we could get
some shit like this.

362
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,629
That round will go through
a bulletproof vest like it was a pillow.

363
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,173
Any idea who would have it?

364
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,760
Whoever it is,
he must work for the Man...

365
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,722
because that right there
is strictly government issue.

366
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,113
You mind telling me
how this was found...

367
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,449
at the scene
of my brother's death?

368
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,750
Okay, Black Dynamite.

369
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,919
Want me to level with you?

370
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,714
Your brother Jimmy
wasn't a two-bit drug dealer.

371
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:01,883
- He was one of us.
- What?

372
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,218
He was working undercover.

373
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,721
And he wanted to be just like you.

374
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,896
Jimmy, why didn't you tell me?

375
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,859
Vincent Rafelli.

376
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,445
Don of the Carbozi family.

377
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,073
Heads up a shipping company.

378
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,618
We believe he's distributing dope.

379
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,245
Jimmy felt that the don
and Congressman James...

380
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,372
had something up their sleeve.

381
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,583
He didn't quite know what it was.

382
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,752
He died trying to find out.

383
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,881
So I don't need to tell you
the importance of this mission.

384
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,966
But I just have one question.

385
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,511
Are you in or are you out?

386
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:49,972
Because God knows
you're the only one we can trust.

387
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,852
I'm in.

388
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,189
Good.

389
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,943
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

390
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,736
Hope you don't mind.

391
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,447
I took the liberty
of reinstating your license to kill.

392
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,954
You're gonna need this.

393
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,504
Black Dynamite's looking for us.

394
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,172
You said you would handle it.

395
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,635
I'm bringing in
the heavy hitters now.

396
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:34,809
Somebody broke into
my dead brother Jimmy's apartment.

397
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,574
Breathe deeply, baby.

398
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,410
Daddy, you make my heart beat.

399
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,997
Yeah, Dr. Dynamite can hear that.

400
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:40,207
But I think
you're running a temperature.

401
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:44,837
Let me see if I can find
a thermometer for you.

402
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,466
What the...?

403
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:53,262
I told you urine sample,
Nurse Jenny.

404
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,389
Black Dynamite.

405
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,059
I mean, really.

406
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,144
You sent her in here
with them titties.

407
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,937
What did you expect?

408
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,481
How's my x-ray?

409
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,066
Well, no fragments.

410
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,692
In and out.

411
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,569
You're lucky, Black Dynamite.

412
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,738
Three inches to the left...

413
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,407
and we wouldn't even be having
this conversation.

414
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,494
Three inches to the right,
it would've missed my black ass.

415
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:19,246
Well, you need a new line of work.

416
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,666
This is the second time this year.

417
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,752
I know, I know.

418
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,755
Why do I bother?
There's no helping you.

419
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,758
No, doc, you help me just fine.

420
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:32,093
See you next time.

421
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,350
You hang in there, Leon.
You hear me?

422
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,905
Hey, Mama, what's going down?
That your kid in there?

423
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,532
No.

424
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,283
Nephew? Cousin?

425
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,910
I said no.

426
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:00,204
No relation, he...

427
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,290
He happens to be one of the kids
at the orphanage where I work.

428
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,001
He overdosed on smack.
Third one this month.

429
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,796
And why?
What does it matter to you anyway?

430
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,298
Whoa, Mama, just trying to help.

431
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,093
I don't need your kind of help.

432
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:17,054
Men like you only help
when there's something in it for them.

433
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,472
They can't be bothered.

434
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,768
Too busy chasing their chicks
and their bread and their fancy car.

435
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,145
No, Mr. Black Dynamite.

436
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,481
The only help you know
is how to help yourself.

437
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,025
Whoa, Mama, it ain't about me.

438
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,819
It's about that kid in there.

439
00:34:32,154 --> 00:34:33,571
Now do you really want help...

440
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,408
or are you just trying to prove to the
world you can do it all on your own?

441
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,076
Mama always said:

442
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,037
"A helping hand is a helping hand,
clean or dirty."

443
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,999
Guess my hands
ain't clean enough for you.

444
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,378
Wait.

445
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,049
These politicians don't give a damn.

446
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,052
I mean, look, look at these ads.

447
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,765
Congressman James
made promises to the people.

448
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,142
Then he took away
his drug-awareness programs...

449
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,187
and allowed his bedfellows
to sell crap to the kids.

450
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,022
He even invested in these products.

451
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,441
Now the dope is everywhere.
It's even...

452
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,067
It's even in the orphanage.

453
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,446
Not the orphanage.

454
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,575
I used to be an orphan.

455
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,953
You ain't got no mommy
and you ain't got no daddy.

456
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,205
You're an orphan.

457
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:28,417
Orphan, orphan, orphan.

458
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,215
No, not the orphans.

459
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,303
I think I need
to show you something.

460
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:44,225
We've been trying
to reach these children.

461
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,728
But this new smack on the street
is proving too much of a match for us.

462
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,565
The worst thing
about these pushers...

463
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:54,276
getting these children
addicted to this new smack...

464
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:58,531
is that these children are orphans,
and orphans don't have parents.

465
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,409
Ain't nothing in the world
get Black Dynamite more mad...

466
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,162
than some jive-ass sucker
dealing smack to the kids.

467
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,498
Bobby, stop it.

468
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,708
You'll kick soon.

469
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,130
You dealing, brother?

470
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,966
I need my smack, I need it now.

471
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:21,262
Put a few of these honeys on the street
and I'll get you your bread, partner.

472
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,224
I refuse to let this happen to you,
little man.

473
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,269
I will shake this poisonous shit
out of your smacked-up body...

474
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,478
if I have to.

475
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:32,940
Black Dynamite, stop.
We've tried that, nothing works.

476
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,862
I can't look at these kids no more.

477
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,868
This orphanage used to be alive
with laughter, kids playing.

478
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,494
Now look at it, it's sickening.

479
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,664
Whoever's responsible is gonna pay,
if it's the last thing I do.

480
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,749
Black Dynamite,
I wish it was that simple.

481
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,960
But this is much bigger
than you and me.

482
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,128
Hey, Little Mama.

483
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,964
It may be bigger than you
and it may be bigger than me.

484
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,592
But it ain't bigger than you and me.
Can you dig it?

485
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,968
I think so.

486
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,137
I gotta split.

487
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,055
You need me to drop you off
somewhere?

488
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,850
No, I think I'm gonna go down
the street and grab a bite.

489
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,643
I'll drive you.

490
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,821
Thanks for the ride.

491
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,589
Can I get some hot sauce
for my donut?

492
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:39,840
Excuse me, lady.

493
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,600
- My God.
- What is it? What is going on?

494
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,602
How did you know?

495
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:55,522
Donuts don't wear alligator shoes.

496
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,006
Damn.

497
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,272
Sorry, Roscoe.

498
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,233
It's cool, man.

499
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:42,569
Chili and donuts ain't working out
for me no how.

500
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,446
Maybe it's time for a change.

501
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,242
What have you gotten me into?

502
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,119
It wasn't me they were after, sugar.

503
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,747
You must have pissed off some people
in some pretty high places.

504
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,334
I'm gonna take you somewhere
you'll be safe.

505
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:01,005
Black Dynamite,
you ain't got to worry about Gloria.

506
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,257
She gonna be safe up in here.

507
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,427
I been keeping the girls up
on their kung fu like you told me to.

508
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:11,432
Now, they find her up in here,
we will fricassee they honky asses.

509
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,477
You sure about this?
Maybe we should call the police.

510
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,689
No, Mama. You can bet
your sweet ass and half a titty...

511
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:22,526
whoever put that hit on you, already
got the cops in their back pocket.

512
00:39:23,236 --> 00:39:24,570
You be cool, Mama.

513
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:26,947
Bee here will keep you tight
and out of sight.

514
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:30,784
I'm gonna shake the tree
from the roots and rake up the fruits...

515
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,580
rip it up out the ground,
find out what's going down.

516
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:37,374
Don't worry about tomorrow, Mama,
because tonight...

517
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,294
Dynamite's gonna make
everything all right.

518
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,212
Euphoria, shut up.
I know that was you.

519
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,464
I ain't even gotta look.

520
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,633
I should send you to Crenshaw Pete
with his hot-ass coat hangers.

521
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,218
Would you like that?

522
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,608
Black Dynamite,
I know that we just met...

523
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:05,152
but somehow I feel
that I can trust you.

524
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,572
I'll be here waiting
till you come to get me.

525
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,410
Thank you for saving my life.

526
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,205
You be cool, Little Mama.

527
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,832
I'll be back before too long.

528
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,725
Order, order, order.

529
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,560
Order, nigga.

530
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,483
The game is at an all-time low.

531
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,863
Never in the history of the game
has there been such devastation.

532
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:51,073
- That's right.
- Yeah.

533
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:54,743
Tricks running low,
cops pushing harder than ever.

534
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:55,953
- Yeah.
- That's right.

535
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,955
These little bitches just running wild.

536
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:01,542
I thought we had
these poop-butt pigs paid off.

537
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,918
- Come to find out.
- Yeah.

538
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,629
They trapping my ho's
every time they hit the track.

539
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:10,134
I'm spending more bail money
than I'm getting tail money.

540
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,719
Yeah, yeah.
I can dig it, Chocolate, I can dig it.

541
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,597
Come on, this has been
my worst physical year ever.

542
00:41:15,765 --> 00:41:17,307
Fiscal, nigga. With a F. Fiscal.

543
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,353
Well, it's been the worst one ever.
I can't even afford to get my hair fixed.

544
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,230
Sounds like you're assed out.

545
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,690
You know what they say.

546
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:26,567
The bitch won't sell her ass.

547
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,069
- A pimp will.
- Will.

548
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,404
Shut up, Tasty.

549
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,032
I turned you onto the game...

550
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,577
when you nothing
but a little jailhouse tramp.

551
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,747
Now, listen up.

552
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,461
Pimping has been around
since the world started turning.

553
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:50,591
And it's going to keep right on
turning right along with it...

554
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:55,429
until this little planet
rotates off its axis...

555
00:41:55,597 --> 00:42:01,852
as a result of its core overheating
and explodes into cosmic dust.

556
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,187
Damn.

557
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,314
- Can you dig it?
- It's done, brother.

558
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,940
You know what I'm saying?

559
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:09,610
Now look here.
These times, they come and they go.

560
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,154
- Right.
- And if you live long enough...

561
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:14,907
you'll be around
to see them come again.

562
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:20,954
But what we need to do
is we need to collectivize.

563
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,956
- Yeah.
- Right on, right on.

564
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,750
Now, look here.

565
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,919
Listen.

566
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,380
Stop all the bullshit and take a vote.

567
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,467
Yes, O.

568
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,637
All in favor, raise your hand.

569
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,972
Kotex?

570
00:42:39,307 --> 00:42:42,267
- Mo Bitches?
- I can dig it, baby.

571
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,769
Chocolate Giddy-Up?

572
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:46,313
Chocolate Giddy-Up.

573
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:47,981
Crenshaw Pete?

574
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,817
Captain Kangaroo Pimp?

575
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,530
- Willie?
- I'm with you.

576
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:59,326
Nigga, even if they don't
knock the broads...

577
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:04,122
there ain't enough tricks
to go around.

578
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,417
Now, look here.

579
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,962
I don't know about the rest of y'all.

580
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,673
But it looks like I have
to keep selling heroin...

581
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,049
just to make ends meet.

582
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,343
Then you'll have
a much bigger problem.

583
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,053
Black Dynamite.

584
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,972
What's happening, baby?

585
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,306
What it is, Big O?

586
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:24,851
To what do we owe this pleasure?

587
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,021
I just got one thing to lay on you cats
and then I'll split.

588
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,856
That I'm declaring war...

589
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,859
on anybody who sells drugs
in our community.

590
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:37,281
But, Black Dynamite,
I sell drugs to the community.

591
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,742
Well, be that as it may,
if I catch you...

592
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,036
I will not consider you
a brother or friend.

593
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,705
Now, can you dig it?

594
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,082
Hell no, nigga.

595
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,252
I can't dig it.

596
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,297
- Now who you supposed to be?
- That's Black Dynamite.

597
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,382
I ain't ask you, nigga. Shut up.

598
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,884
I'm gonna tell you like this.

599
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:01,722
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do.

600
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,726
- Yeah.
- Well, the choice is yours, brother.

601
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,853
But if me and my people
catch you...

602
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:10,689
you're gonna have
a lot more to deal with.

603
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:13,275
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Goodbye, Black Dynamite.

604
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:16,153
Will you stop that?

605
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,119
Hold it right there.

606
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,496
It's me, Black Dynamite.

607
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,249
- What the hell do you wasnt?
- I wanna help you.

608
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,584
Why should I trust you...

609
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:33,003
after you dropped dime on me
to Chicago Wind?

610
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,214
Because your brother Jimmy
saved my life.

611
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,925
I was supposed to be with him
the night he got killed.

612
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,637
But he called me
and told me to stay at home.

613
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,348
I guess I owe him one.

614
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,729
I'll need a list
of names and locations.

615
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:51,938
Ain't no thing.

616
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,900
Man, everything is gonna be okay.

617
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,443
Bullhorn...

618
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:00,280
Cream Corn here says he can
help us find the cats we're looking for.

619
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,199
Now, what do you think?

620
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:05,786
Man,
I think we should put our ankles in it.

621
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,868
They broke into my home.

622
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,537
They got the ledger.

623
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:32,706
They got the manifest,
they got everything.

624
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,833
Everything.
Names, dates, schedules.

625
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,460
We even got the shipping routes.

626
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,336
They won't be able to take a shit...

627
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,380
without us knowing
when or what color.

628
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:43,216
We cleaned up the streets
and gave them back to the people.

629
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:47,429
Once again, making them a pleasant
place to take an afternoon stroll.

630
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:54,561
Extra, extra. Hot off the presses.

631
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,230
Black Dynamite
cleans up the street.

632
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,734
It's unbelievable, Black Dynamite.

633
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,903
Everyone looks so happy...

634
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,654
and it's all thanks to you.

635
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,990
I'd like to take the credit
but dig, Mama.

636
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:10,243
There's no I in "revolut..." In "team."

637
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,747
Look, I'm know I'm gonna be rusty,
but I have to try.

638
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,501
Hi, girls. What is your name?

639
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,753
I'm Shawanda,
and her name's Brikwilla.

640
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,129
Those are beautiful names.

641
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:24,090
I'm Gloria
and this is Black Dynamite.

642
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,093
My mama said
my daddy's name is Black Dynamite.

643
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,429
So did my mama.

644
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,682
Hush up, little girls.

645
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,143
A lot of cats have that name.

646
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:21,439
Well, that was amazing.

647
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,484
Thank you
for a beautiful day and night.

648
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:31,491
But I think I should be going.

649
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,744
I think you'll be safer
if you stay here tonight.

650
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:37,706
You do, do you?

651
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,834
I hope you don't think you're
gonna get any of this cookie.

652
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,169
Because if I offered you
some of this cookie...

653
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,838
this cookie might kill you.

654
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,757
Don't think because
we've been frolicking in the park...

655
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,801
you got this closed
because it takes...

656
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,344
Yeah, yeah, Mama.

657
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:55,724
You can hit the sheets or the streets.
It don't make me no never mind.

658
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,184
That's your bag, baby.
You can go or you can come.

659
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,644
Can you dig it?

660
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:14,928
Yeah.

661
00:50:15,096 --> 00:50:16,137
Black Dynamite.

662
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,223
We read the ledger
and it just don't stop.

663
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:22,394
There's a trail of paper
that leads all the way to the top.

664
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,187
A big shipment is coming to town...

665
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,981
and it's right there
where that cracker wrote it down.

666
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,734
Now, we don't know the whens,
but we do know the wheres.

667
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:33,613
And however the fuck the whats,
we'll sure enough be there.

668
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:39,494
Looks like he's got two warehouses.

669
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:42,997
One big one,
and one smaller one here.

670
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,793
We break into the two units,
we hit the smaller one first...

671
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:49,421
then we scale the fence,
enter from the south...

672
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,966
use an acetylene blowtorch to
breech the warehouse from the back.

673
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,968
That way we avoid the guards.

674
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:58,513
Man, them honkies gonna be running
for cover when us brothers get...

675
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,099
Get... Get...

676
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,771
The torch is an issue.

677
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,315
We won't be able to get
an acetylene torch in time.

678
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,276
Think again, brother.

679
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:13,653
You know somebody that's got one?

680
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,281
I know just the cat.

681
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,716
All right, snowflake.
Where's the dope?

682
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:18,927
Up yours, coon.

683
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,264
It's right over there
in the body bags, jeez.

684
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,815
So how much dope
is in the big warehouse?

685
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:37,821
They're gonna kill me anyway.
I'm not gonna tell you nothing, coon.

686
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,742
Dynamite, I got something
that will make him talk.

687
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,708
I ain't gonna tell you nothing.

688
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:54,420
Operation Code Kansas.
Can't stop it, too late.

689
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,966
Operation Code Kansas
gonna fix all the niggas.

690
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:04,430
Yeah, you won't be so big
and so bad anymore...

691
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,809
because Kansas gonna fix you.

692
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,478
Just the niggas.

693
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:13,189
Just the nig...

694
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:19,779
Damn, Smoke.

695
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:21,990
I think you gave him
too much of that shit.

696
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,034
How long till it wears off?

697
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,716
It's malt liquor?

698
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,803
It's that new Anaconda Malt Liquor
from the billboards.

699
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,014
It's supposed to give you:

700
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:52,979
Tastes good too.

701
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,772
I know the drugs
are here somewhere.

702
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,942
We're gonna check every crate
until we find it.

703
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,283
I can't believe it, fellas.

704
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:08,620
That entire shipment
was just malt liquor.

705
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,330
Don't beat yourself up, Dynamite.

706
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:13,291
We still kept the 50 keys
we found in that first warehouse...

707
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:14,959
from getting on the streets.

708
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,712
I'm gonna go home
and drink the rest of this, man.

709
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,007
Y'all should've grabbed some
of this shit. This shit is incredible.

710
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,514
I tell you, brothers,
it just don't make no damn sense.

711
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,517
The manifest, the shipping log,
the ledgers.

712
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,520
All records are consistent
with that damned beer shipment.

713
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:38,024
If anything else was in there,
it would have to weigh something.

714
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,443
They got it out before we got there.

715
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,694
No.

716
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:44,864
Why would they have guards there
if they got the drugs out?

717
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,200
No, them crackers
was protecting something.

718
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:50,954
B.D., we checked every single crate,
every stinking bottle.

719
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,039
Man, I'm with you, Dynamite.

720
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,375
That babbling cracker
knew something.

721
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:58,836
What that guard said,
I keep running through my head.

722
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,005
Code Kansas.

723
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,591
"You people
won't be so big anymore."

724
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,551
Code Kansas.

725
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,553
It just don't make no damn sense.

726
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,055
Hey, sweet thing.

727
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:12,225
What don't make no sense is
the service around this motherfucker.

728
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:13,893
Bitch, do you see us?

729
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,438
I'd like two sausage links,
two sausage patties...

730
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:20,149
two hot dogs,
split down the middle twice, okay?

731
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,859
Baloney, fry that up into a dome.

732
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:24,737
Slice that,
take a spatula, smush fry it.

733
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,239
And one waffle, please.

734
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:27,740
I can get your waffle...

735
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,159
but all we got
is the chicken from last night.

736
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,121
Now, I can bring you some of that
if you wasnt some meat.

737
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,957
Chicken and waffles?

738
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:37,625
That's it.

739
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,255
Take it easy, brother.
It ain't her fault.

740
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,465
Sorry, sister,
we all just a little uptight.

741
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,051
But if you bring us
some of them good-ass waffles...

742
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,262
everything will be all right.

743
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,765
Man, you guys
ain't had no waffles like these.

744
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,934
These waffles are so good...

745
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:57,186
they're like they come
from down South.

746
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,772
These buttery motherfuckers
will melt in your mouth.

747
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,775
- Man, you ain't had no waffles...
- Wait.

748
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:06,404
Bullhorn, what did you just say?

749
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,740
You said:

750
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,659
"Melts in your mouth."

751
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:14,912
Quick.

752
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:17,457
What else melts in your mouth?

753
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,501
- M&M's.
- Exactly.

754
00:56:20,669 --> 00:56:23,296
And not in your hands.

755
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,591
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

756
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,134
And who makes M&M's?

757
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,511
Mars Candy Company makes it.

758
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:32,055
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's right.

759
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,974
And Mars is also...

760
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:38,978
- The Roman god of war.
- That's what I'm telling you.

761
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,773
Who is the Greek god of war?

762
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,566
- Ares.
- Right on.

763
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:48,696
Now, you take Mars
and spell it backwards, drop the S.

764
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,615
- What is it? What did you get?
- R...

765
00:56:50,783 --> 00:56:52,158
Ram. That's right.

766
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:56,662
And ram is the zodialogical sign
for Aries.

767
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,331
- Now dig.
- That right.

768
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:02,168
- Ares's half sister is Athena.
- Now you're getting it.

769
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,088
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Athena, Athens.

770
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,174
Which is the capital of Greece.

771
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:09,634
And as we all know...

772
00:57:09,802 --> 00:57:13,096
zodialogical astronomy
was created by the Greeks in...

773
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,640
785 B.C.

774
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:19,352
And 785 is the area code of Topeka.
My God.

775
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,606
785 is the area code
to Topeka, Kansas.

776
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,858
Code Kansas.

777
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:29,612
Now you take that,
spell it backwards and drop the S.

778
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:32,698
Snake doc. Snake doctor, yeah.

779
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,325
- Yes.
- Yeah.

780
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:35,576
And brothers...

781
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:38,788
who is the Greek demigod
of medicine...

782
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:42,416
who believed that snakes' tongues
had mystical healing powers?

783
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,585
Aesculapius, of course.

784
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:48,798
He had a staff with snakes
intertwining all around that bitch.

785
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,967
They called it Aesculapius's staff.

786
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:53,845
It's a symbol the medical field uses
to this day.

787
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,054
I've seen it.

788
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:58,933
Now,
what legend involving snakes...

789
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:02,145
is in both Greek and Roman
mythology?

790
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,690
Now, come on.
It involves Aesculapius's own father.

791
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:07,275
Apollo.

792
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,777
Yeah. Thanks, lady.

793
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:10,987
That's right.

794
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:17,493
Apollo slew the serpent at Delphi
which was a big-ass snake.

795
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,703
That's right.

796
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:22,081
And what, brothers,
is the biggest snake in the world?

797
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:25,084
The South American anaconda.

798
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:29,589
- What she said.
- Anaconda Malt Liquor.

799
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:33,426
And what is the slogan
for Anaconda Malt Liquor?

800
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,344
"Anaconda Malt Liquor gives you..."

801
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:37,471
Gives you what?

802
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,683
And who else is famous for:

803
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,435
Little Richard.

804
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:44,145
- Who?
- Little Richard.

805
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:47,231
So, what they're really saying is...

806
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:51,611
Anaconda Malt Liquor
gives you Little Richard.

807
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:56,073
What is another word for Richard?

808
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,913
- Gunsmoke. Come on, get up.
- Gunsmoke!

809
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,043
Damn.

810
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:11,130
Anaconda Malt Liquor
gives you a little dick.

811
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,764
Should we kill him?

812
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:23,893
Man, do you wasnt to live?

813
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,480
I said, do you want to go on?

814
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:41,327
Man, this time these crackers
have gone too far.

815
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,164
- The warehouse.
- The warehouse.

816
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:50,836
Freeze, you jive-time suckers.

817
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,506
Who's in charge?

818
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:57,551
Brothers, make these honkies load
this dick-shrinking poison...

819
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,763
back into the warehouse
so we can burn this mother down.

820
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,848
Waste them if they make a sound.

821
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,643
I'm gonna go inside and find out
who's running this shit.

822
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:09,855
- All right, men, move it.
- Come on, you heard him.

823
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,732
Sucker, you drop it right there.

824
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,943
- O'Leary?
- That's right.

825
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,404
Go ahead, guys, I got this.

826
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:21,242
O'Leary, you son of a bitch.
I should have known it was you.

827
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,451
You should have.

828
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,329
You were too busy
and trying to lay that orphan mama...

829
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:27,540
to not see
what was in front of your face.

830
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:30,543
You diabolical
dick-shrinking motherfuckers.

831
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,253
You were the leak all the time.

832
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:34,463
And I bet you were behind
Jimmy's death.

833
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,382
Hey, man,
I was just following orders.

834
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,260
That's what a good soldier does,
follow orders, unlike you.

835
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:41,721
Everything's gotta be done
the Black Dynamite way.

836
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,055
I gave the order on Jimmy.

837
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,224
I gave it to James,
who gave it to the don.

838
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:47,560
What good's it gonna do you now?

839
01:00:56,903 --> 01:01:00,072
The old birthday-candle trick
from Nam.

840
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,825
Just when you think it's out...

841
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:08,414
O'Leary. O'Leary, where are you?

842
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,333
Yeah, who's this?

843
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:41,572
Fellas, we going on a boat ride
to Kung Fu Island.

844
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:50,623
Hey, Black Dynamite,
there's the island.

845
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,010
Okay.

846
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,638
Now, here's the plan.

847
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,478
Yeah.

848
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:15,356
Okay, let's split up.

849
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,629
He's here.

850
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:43,676
We kicked their ass.

851
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:46,011
Power to the people, brothers.

852
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,514
This is it, brothers.

853
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:52,351
- This is where we stick it to the Man.
- Yeah.

854
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:53,936
Now, let's go get that lab.

855
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:57,523
All right, let's go.

856
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,821
You know, when we get back home,
I'm gonna retire from the revolution.

857
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,281
Start a family.

858
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:06,866
Show this picture.

859
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,200
That's Betty Jo.

860
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:10,494
Yeah, right on, yeah.

861
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:13,539
Buy a home in the country.
Raise our own fruits and vegetables.

862
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,416
Bake our own bread,
know what I mean?

863
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:16,917
Bake our own...

864
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:22,214
Who saw that coming...?
Who saw where that came from?

865
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,842
Let's go.

866
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,916
I should've known you would be
behind this, Fiendish Dr. Wu.

867
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,086
Your knowledge of scientific
biological transmogrifications...

868
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:04,590
is only out-matched by your zest
for kung-fu treachery.

869
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:12,264
Your kung fu is quite extraordinary,
Black Dynamite.

870
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:13,933
But no match for mine.

871
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:18,479
You should have joined us
when you had the chance.

872
01:04:18,647 --> 01:04:21,273
But now you must die.

873
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:24,527
Man, I'll take this jive-ass turkey.

874
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:31,450
Bullhorn, no.

875
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:35,704
At long last, our friendship bonded
by the struggle against the Man...

876
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,250
has been brought to an end
by kung-fu treachery.

877
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:43,420
Brother, your death
will not go unavenged.

878
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:47,800
Fiendish Dr. Wu,
you done fucked up now.

879
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,719
Get him.

880
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:12,825
You must try the Wu family
Red Silk Kung Fu.

881
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:25,337
Black Dynamite Panther Fist.

882
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,567
What the fuck?

883
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,402
Keep your eye on Black Dynamite.

884
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:41,789
Looking for me?

885
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:50,923
Can you see where I'm coming from,
you jive motherfucker?

886
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:56,095
No rush? Come on?

887
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,932
You told him
to keep an eye out for me.

888
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:13,195
I threw that shit
before I walked in the room.

889
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,664
I wanna know
who's pulling your strings.

890
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:26,125
Now start talking. Talk.

891
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,295
- I said, start talking.
- Okay.

892
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,589
Your government
has been preoccupied...

893
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,008
with building the bigger penis
for years.

894
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,723
What's this green one?

895
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,559
It did exactly opposite
of what it was intended.

896
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:49,064
It made the penis shrivel to the size
of a 2-month-old snapping turtle.

897
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,650
This is what you've been putting
in the malt liquor?

898
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,069
I was under orders.

899
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,405
They threatened to fire me.

900
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,074
Speaking of fire.

901
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,912
Suddenly,
I'd like to leave your island.

902
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,998
No! No!

903
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,541
No.

904
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,179
You dirty motherfucker.

905
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:28,353
Hey, Black Dynamite,
I found a helicopter.

906
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,022
Quick, give me a hairpin.

907
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:45,370
What's in the briefcase,
Black Dynamite?

908
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,914
How far does this all go, man?

909
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,374
Cream Corn,
this goes all the way to the top.

910
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:53,545
And when I say top,
I mean the tippety-top.

911
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,673
There it is, Black Dynamite.
The Honky House.

912
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,550
I'm going down.

913
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:00,719
- This shouldn't take long.
- Whoa, hey...

914
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:03,305
- Take the controls.
- What are you talking about?

915
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,266
Whoa, hey, hey, man.

916
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,771
Son of a bitch.

917
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:18,737
Cream Corn, no!

918
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,696
I should have known it was you
all the time.

919
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:47,117
I should have asked myself,
"Who's the man so wicked...

920
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:50,287
so cruel to serve smack
to the orphanage...

921
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:55,334
kill my brother Jimmy, and put out
a drug to shrink black men's dicks?"

922
01:10:55,835 --> 01:11:00,005
Only one man,
and that's you, Tricky Dick.

923
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:09,348
So I'm here to deliver you one
presidential ass-whooping.

924
01:11:11,059 --> 01:11:12,935
Black Dynamite.

925
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,854
There is a perfectly...

926
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,901
reasonable explanation for that.

927
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,867
Showtime, motherfucker.

928
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,036
Fucking...

929
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:34,539
Black Dynamite.

930
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,875
Who the fuck would duck?

931
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:41,046
Piece of shit.

932
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:07,739
Don't fuck with me.

933
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,409
Motherfucker.

934
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:37,644
Take your filthy black hands
off the presidential dinnerware...

935
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:39,438
you moon cricket.

936
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,712
And now, Black Dynamite,
you must die.

937
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:00,435
You had enough, Mr. President?

938
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:04,064
You'll never get away with this.

939
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,233
Watch me,
you little insecure cracker.

940
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,193
You think
by shrinking our johnsons...

941
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:10,403
it's gonna make your situation
any better?

942
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,907
That's your problem, Tricky Dick.
You are paranoid.

943
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,451
Like sending those two-bit crooks
to Watergate.

944
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,245
For what?

945
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:20,580
For these?

946
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:23,542
- Look at you.
- What?

947
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,710
You lost it all, turkey.

948
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,465
- Kill me.
- Say what?

949
01:14:30,633 --> 01:14:33,009
- Kill me.
- No.

950
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,678
That's the easy way out for you.

951
01:14:34,846 --> 01:14:37,722
Unless you want the rest
of this freaky shit to hit the news...

952
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:40,142
I suggest you take care
of me and my people.

953
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,351
Can you dig it?

954
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,229
I said, can you dig it?

955
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:45,772
Yes, I can dig it.

956
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,024
Thought you could.

957
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:21,600
First Lady, I'm sorry I pimp-slapped
you into that china cabinet.

958
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:24,186
I used excessive force.

959
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,438
Oftentimes, I cross the line...

960
01:15:26,606 --> 01:15:29,441
but I try to do so
in the name of what's right.

961
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:32,527
Most of the time,
the ends justifies the means.

962
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:36,990
But in this case, I feel like I betrayed
my own code of ethics...

963
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:40,035
and for that, sugar, I apologize.

964
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,454
But I shot at you.

965
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:44,956
I tried to kill you, Black Dynamite.

966
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:48,501
This is true,
but you did not connect.

967
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:49,961
You shot a plate.

968
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:53,048
Had you connected,
maybe pimp-slapping you into that...

969
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:55,050
might have been justified.

970
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:57,344
But I feel I crossed the line.

971
01:15:57,511 --> 01:16:00,305
And for that,
please accept my apology.

972
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,140
I do.

973
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:03,767
I do, it's just...

974
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:07,479
Black Dynamite,
you're so righteous.

975
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:09,856
This is also true.

976
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,816
Because
whenever there's injustice...

977
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:13,818
wrongs to be...

978
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,363
Black Dynamite.

979
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:20,575
Go on, honey.

980
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:25,664
Because wherever there's injustice,
wrongs to be righted...

981
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:29,000
innocents to be defended,
Black Dynamite will be there...

982
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:31,503
delivering ass-whoopings.

983
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:34,673
And I will not hesitate to lay
the hammer down on any clown...

984
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,174
that comes around.

985
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:40,178
Because if they wanna fight,
they best come see me...

986
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:42,973
because I'm Black Dynamite.

987
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,156
How you doing
with that midget girl you sent out?

988
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:48,867
Man, she keeps coming up short.

989
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,966
And better no nigga
mess with me, neither.

990
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:08,803
I would jump on him,
all 93 pounds of dynamite.

991
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:10,805
That's right.

992
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:27,780
So I says, "Bitch, you look like
you need a pimp in your life."

993
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,616
She said, "I got a pimp."

994
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:32,494
I said,
"Shit, that nigga ain't no pimp.

995
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,038
He a valet for ho's."

996
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:46,382
It's called the
Mo Bitches Variety Pack.

997
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,592
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

998
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,471
I send out a big ho, a little ho,
a skinny ho, and one Navajo.

999
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:54,390
- Is that right?
- That's right.

1000
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,460
Take that, you cracker-ass cracker.

1001
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:26,297
All right, girls, let's take them down.

1002
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:51,281
I only do two things well
in this world.

1003
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:56,995
I take money from bitches
and I sell drugs to the community.

1004
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,514
I had to send your ho back
the other day.

1005
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:17,932
- No?
- Yeah, man.

1006
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,811
She reckless eyeballing
and carrying on.

1007
01:22:21,979 --> 01:22:26,065
She fine, but I said,
"Hey, your man is bona fide."

1008
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:28,359
See? You're a righteous pimp.

1009
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:30,820
Shit, the real pimping lives here.

1010
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:32,238
It ain't ego.

1011
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:34,907
That's how we go. You like that?

1012
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:03,561
You gotta cross the lines sometimes.

1013
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:09,108
Sometimes to do the right thing,
you got to do the ugly thing.

1014
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:14,822
You know people, they don't want
to see the cow killed...

1015
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,866
they just want their steak
on a plate.

1016
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:18,368
Can you dig it?

1017
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:42,433
Good evening, gentlemen.

1018
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,062
Who let that nigga in my house?
