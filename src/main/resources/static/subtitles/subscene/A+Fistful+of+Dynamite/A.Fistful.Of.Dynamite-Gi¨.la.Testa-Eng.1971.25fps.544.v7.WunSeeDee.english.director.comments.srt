1
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:12,364
I'm Christopher Frayling
biographer of Sergio Leone.

2
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:15,604
I'm talking about Leone's
fifth major film

3
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:20,437
Gíú La Testa Once Upon A Time
The Revolution or Duck You Sucker

4
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:25,281
The quotation from Chairman Mao
Tse-Tung that opens this film

5
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:27,204
is important for lots of reasons.

6
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:36,237
on the wall of those rebelling students
in the university rebellion of May '68 in Paris.

7
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:41,395
It was almost a sacred text amongst
left-wing students in the late 1960s.

8
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:45,042
It goes on beyond the words
that are on this card.

9
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:47,840
The revolution is an act of violence
said Mao

10
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:54,599
So they slightly pruned it
and the Mao quote wasn 't on many prints

11
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:56,922
when the film was first issued.

12
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:01,840
The film opens with someone
urinating over a colony of ants.

13
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:07,200
This scene too was missing from a lot of prints
when the film was first put out.

14
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:09,795
It was said by some critics
to be a reference

15
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:12,646
to the opening of Sam Peckinpah's
The Wild Bunch

16
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:15,679
which has children with ants
with scorpions

17
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:20,562
and setting fire to the scorpions
as an image of the anarchy of society

18
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:22,962
in the borders between
the US and Mexico.

19
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:27,956
It is in fact a reference to the
childhood of the director Sergio Leone

20
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,806
who grew up in Trastevere
a suburb of Rome

21
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:34,715
and used to climb some steep steps
with a gang of friends as a kid.

22
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:38,044
They'd lay plank s on the steps
urinate on the plank s

23
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:41,364
and see whose urine reached
the bottom of the steps first.

24
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:44,843
The screenwriter Sergio Donati
and Luciano Vincenzoni

25
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:48,164
were asked to make reference to this
in the opening scene.

26
00:01:48,287 --> 00:01:52,405
Most international release prints
began with these shots

27
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:55,837
with Rod Steiger
as the peasant Juan Miranda

28
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:58,925
looking at a coach
coming along the road.

29
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:02,357
Rod Steiger wasn 't the first choice
of actor for this film.

30
00:02:02,487 --> 00:02:06,400
The first choice was Eli Wallach Tuco
in The Good The Bad And The Ugly

31
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,643
The part was written for Eli Wallach

32
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:12,157
but when they looked at the budget
and size of the production

33
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:16,997
United Artists said they wanted
a bigger actor a prestige actor.

34
00:02:17,127 --> 00:02:20,483
Steiger had won an Oscar in 1968
for his performance

35
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,758
as a Mississippi police chief
in In the Heat of the Night

36
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:27,675
So he was very hot in the early 19T'Os
so Rod Steiger it was.

37
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:32,005
Eli Wallach remained very sore
not only that he'd lost the part

38
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:34,925
but about the way in which it was done.

39
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:39,245
The coach hurtling along with all
those horses has a big story behind it.

40
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,881
Sergio Leone was
a great antiques collector

41
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:44,316
in common with his father before him.

42
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:48,360
His house in Rome was full of
objets d'art from the 18th century

43
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:51,479
from the Renaissance
and of 20th-century art.

44
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:54,326
He wanted the stagecoach
in the first sequence

45
00:02:54,447 --> 00:02:57,519
to be the most grand stagecoach
that you'd ever seen.

46
00:02:57,647 --> 00:03:00,525
He got craftsmen in Rome
to make it out of solid wood

47
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,798
he had genuine antique
Louis Vuitton luggage inside it

48
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:07,203
he had a lavatory inside it
like a Pullman car on a railway.

49
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:11,605
The biggest stagecoach you've ever seen
to create an impact on the screen.

50
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:15,606
Everything had to be
larger than life with Leone.

51
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:19,879
On the first day of shooting the thing
wouldn 't move it was so solid.

52
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:24,205
They tried two horses four horses
six horses eight horses

53
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:28,525
and it kept getting stuck in the dust
of the Spanish desert in Almería.

54
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:31,445
For some shots
they have the horses pulling it

55
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:34,286
and a tractor behind it
pushing the coach along.

56
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:37,763
They made a duplicate in light wood
for the action sequences

57
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,923
so this coach would actually move.

58
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:42,436
That is attention to detail.

59
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,881
Most of the film was shot
in the countryside

60
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:54,884
between Guadix and Almería
in southern Spain

61
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:57,396
in the ramblas the dried-up riverbeds

62
00:03:57,527 --> 00:04:01,725
and the roads and the mountains
of that part of southern Spain

63
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:05,078
a very distinctive topography
of Andalucía.

64
00:04:10,247 --> 00:04:14,763
This line was the first one to be shot
on the first day of shooting.

65
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,323
Steiger who was a graduate of
The Actors Studio in the 1950s

66
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:22,122
a method actor who believed in
a psychological approach to acting

67
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:25,125
and finding the motivation
inside himself

68
00:04:25,247 --> 00:04:28,125
walked about a kilometre away
according to Leone

69
00:04:28,247 --> 00:04:32,320
and started walking towards the set
where he was supposed to speak.

70
00:04:32,447 --> 00:04:34,961
He said "My mother is dead."

71
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:38,159
He says the line over and over
to psych himself up.

72
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:42,246
All the Spanish technicians
were roaring with laughter.

73
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,927
Usually the words
were dubbed on afterwards

74
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:47,959
so why bother about
the psychological performance?

75
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:52,603
There was tension throughout the movie
between Leone's approach to filmmaking

76
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:55,480
post-synchronisation location shooting

77
00:04:55,607 --> 00:04:58,599
using actors' faces
as part of the design

78
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:03,198
and Rod Steiger's philosophy of acting
which is find the truth inside yourself

79
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:07,206
look at the detail try and get
the truth in the first two takes.

80
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:10,285
Leone went up to
1825 takes with Steiger

81
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:13,126
to tire him out
to make the performance smaller.

82
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:16,557
He felt that Steiger was being too big
for this performance.

83
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:20,077
He also thought Steiger
was too cerebral too intellectual.

84
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:25,076
The whole point is this is
a simple peasant bandit in Mexico.

85
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:28,438
The performance had to be
reduced in size because of that.

86
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:30,364
They settled their differences

87
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:34,366
and Steiger gives an extraordinary
performance in this film.

88
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:45,239
The film is set at a very precise moment
in the Mexican Revolution of 1913.

89
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:48,484
The revolution began in 1911
went through to 1920.

90
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:51,121
But in 1913 there was
a very particular moment

91
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:54,000
when the early energy
of the Mexican Revolution

92
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:57,437
under President Madero
with lots of land reforms

93
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,400
and attempts to democratise Mexico

94
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:05,157
had gone into reverse
under a man called Huerta.

95
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:09,519
This film is set in 1913
when Huerta is clinging on to power

96
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:12,525
and trying to stop the revolution
from happening.

97
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:16,526
This explains some of the violence
and the cruelty and the decadence

98
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:18,444
that happens later in the film.

99
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:23,083
We're looking at the dying embers of
a fascistic regime clinging on to power

100
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:25,198
but it also explains this sequence

101
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:28,000
where the peasant
goes inside this stagecoach

102
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:32,439
this Pullman carriage on wheels and
you see the reaction of the bourgeoisie

103
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:35,639
who've recently been
dispossessed by President Madero

104
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:39,316
to the intrusion
of this member of the proletariat.

105
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:42,325
All sorts of professions
are in the carriage.

106
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:45,917
You have a cardinal
a landowner a lawyer.

107
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:49,164
They're about to comment
on this experience

108
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:51,278
of meeting a real-life peasant

109
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:54,444
in their sanctuary
inside this well-padded coach.

110
00:06:54,567 --> 00:07:00,039
This sequence is shot like a Sergei Eisenstein
movie in the Soviet Union as we'll see

111
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:05,036
a collision of shots of people's faces
uncomfortable close-ups

112
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,557
as they say these horrible
racist and derogatory things

113
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:12,202
about the Mexican peasant
who's just joined them.

114
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:30,240
Juan Miranda
is an interesting character.

115
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:34,599
He's very instinctive. He doesn 't seem
to have much of a conscience.

116
00:07:34,727 --> 00:07:37,639
He seems to be out of place
almost everywhere.

117
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:42,079
In the coach
later on at the town of Mesa Verde

118
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:44,004
amongst the revolutionaries.

119
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,642
The only time he feels comfortable
and relaxed and in place

120
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,759
is when he's with his extended family
as we'll see

121
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,641
which makes the tragedy
in the middle of the film poignant.

122
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:57,361
Here begin the Eisenstein -type shots.

123
00:07:57,487 --> 00:08:00,399
It's like an early Eisenstein film
made in the 1920s

124
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:04,122
a film like Strike or October
or The Battleship Potemkin

125
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:07,205
where you get these close-ups
of social types

126
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:10,763
in order to make a point
about the class war

127
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:13,481
the overthrow of one class by another.

128
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:34,806
The landowner's wife's name
is Adelita in the film.

129
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:38,442
She's played by
the Italian actress Maria Monti.

130
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:42,321
The name Adelita was the name
given by the Mexican revolutionaries

131
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:44,836
to the heroines of the revolution

132
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:49,438
the soldaderas who followed the troops
of Pancho Villa and Zapata around.

133
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:53,446
They were known as Adelita. It was
the name of a revolutionary anthem.

134
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:57,196
So to give this very reactionary lady
the name Adelita

135
00:08:57,327 --> 00:09:01,605
would have meant a lot to people
who knew about the Mexican Revolution.

136
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:21,199
There's always a lot of eating
in Leone films.

137
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:25,206
He himself had a gargantuan appetite
for pasta and Italian food

138
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:27,761
and there's often a scene
of people eating

139
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:30,765
but this is the only scene
in Leone's cinema

140
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:34,038
where the eating is deliberately
presented as disgusting.

141
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:38,080
Close-ups of the mouths
noises of eating noises of swallowing

142
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:40,243
the juice round their mouths.

143
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:43,837
It's deliberately physically repulsive

144
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:48,165
to represent the attitudes of the people
who are speaking as well.

145
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:06,846
A critic in Italy said that these
close-ups of mouths eating food

146
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:10,516
were like a series of close-ups
of unwiped bottoms.

147
00:10:14,487 --> 00:10:16,682
A montage of what they've been saying

148
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:21,597
these racist patronising and derogatory
comments about Juan Miranda.

149
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:26,566
And he just sits there
impassive watching.

150
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:00,998
Adelita is fantasising
about this brutish peasant

151
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:06,121
in a rather unreconstructed way as
we'll see later on when the coach stops.

152
00:11:12,847 --> 00:11:15,042
There are a lot of aspects of this film
which relate to Leone's early cinema.

153
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,964
The arrival of a vehicle.

154
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:21,922
In Once Upon A Time In The West and
For A Few Dollars More it was a train.

155
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:26,165
We'll later have an elaborate bank
robbery the blowing up of a bridge

156
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:30,166
a kind of duel in a circular space
the killing of a child

157
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:33,723
and lots of catchphrases
of the two central characters.

158
00:11:33,847 --> 00:11:36,520
These were by now trademark s
of Leone's cinema

159
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:40,196
but it's a very different film
to Leone's earlier Westerns

160
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:42,318
for all sorts of reasons.

161
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:46,599
One he'd fallen out of love
with the traditional West.

162
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:48,797
After Once Upon A Time In The West

163
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:51,999
he said "I never want
to make a Western again."

164
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,766
He was only going to produce this film.

165
00:11:54,887 --> 00:11:57,242
In fact he didn 't want to produce it.

166
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,439
United Artists insisted
that he was the producer.

167
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:04,606
All sorts of people were slotted
to direct it under his supervision.

168
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:07,446
There was talk of Peter Bogdanovich

169
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,764
who flew over from Hollywood
and stayed with Leone in Rome

170
00:12:10,887 --> 00:12:13,879
to talk through the script
and discuss the direction.

171
00:12:14,007 --> 00:12:16,475
Bogdanovich had just made Targets

172
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:18,802
But they had some blazing rows.

173
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:22,966
You can 't imagine two people with
such different philosophies of film.

174
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:26,602
Bogdanovich the classic movies
of John Ford and Howard Hawk s

175
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:30,561
a film buff who knew a lot about
Hollywood in the golden age

176
00:12:30,687 --> 00:12:34,726
versus Leone who loved close-ups
zooms elaborate editing

177
00:12:34,847 --> 00:12:36,838
who loved very theatrical effects.

178
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,958
They couldn 't be further apart.

179
00:12:39,087 --> 00:12:42,045
So they in fact had a terminal row.

180
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:46,001
It took place in Luciano Vincenzoni
the scriptwriter's apartment

181
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:48,641
and Bogdanovich flew back
to Hollywood.

182
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,043
Then there was talk of
Sam Peckinpah directing this film.

183
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,806
Leone flew over to London
where Peckinpah was

184
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:59,079
and left with the impression
that Peckinpah might be interested.

185
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:01,596
He thought what a great idea
for the poster

186
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:04,287
Sam Peckinpah
and Sergio Leone together.

187
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:06,477
But that didn 't happen either.

188
00:13:06,607 --> 00:13:08,882
Leone turned to his assistant director

189
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:12,602
on Once Upon A Time In The West
Giancarlo Santi

190
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:16,606
who was slotted to direct it
and directed the first day of shooting.

191
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:19,002
But Rod Steiger and James Coburn

192
00:13:19,127 --> 00:13:24,599
said "We want the real McCoy.
We want Leone to direct this film."

193
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:29,164
So in the end Santi became
the second unit director on this film

194
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:31,676
and Leone took over
slightly reluctantly

195
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:34,037
or so he claimed as director.

196
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:38,957
So the circumstances of its making
were very different to the other films.

197
00:13:39,087 --> 00:13:42,397
The other important aspect
of the context for this film

198
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,202
is what was happening in
the Italian Western in the late 1960s.

199
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:50,445
From about '66 to '69 a whole series
of Italian Westerns were made

200
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,683
with very political themes.

201
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:54,843
They were partly about Vietnam

202
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,606
partly about the Third World
as it was called

203
00:13:57,727 --> 00:14:01,276
and they usually involved
an American or a European

204
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:06,640
going to Mexico and meeting up with
a peasant bandit the hero of the film.

205
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:10,885
The focus was no longer the cold
superhero the Clint Eastwood character

206
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:15,444
but it became the peasant usually
played by a Cuban actor Tomas Milian.

207
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:19,640
The peasant would eventually be
persuaded to take on the revolution

208
00:14:19,767 --> 00:14:23,601
become a revolutionary
and would either kill or send packing

209
00:14:23,727 --> 00:14:25,877
the American or German mercenary.

210
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:29,920
These were transparent political
parables of a socialist character.

211
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:31,844
Leone detested them.

212
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:35,846
He thought they were preachy
and he didn 't approve of their politics.

213
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,561
He wanted to make a film
about the revolution

214
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:42,282
which had a completely cynical attitude
towards revolution.

215
00:14:42,407 --> 00:14:47,117
When the Mao Tse-Tung quote came
everyone knew what he was doing.

216
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:51,923
He was taking this hallowed moment
from student revolution in 1968

217
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:54,607
and saying "I don 't believe a word of it."

218
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:59,118
"I have complete cynicism about
that kind of doctrinaire socialism."

219
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:15,245
Here's a farm with the circular
cobbled threshing yard

220
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:20,441
like the ones that had appeared in earlier
Leone films as the site for the final duel.

221
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:25,766
But on this occasion he didn 't want the
settling of accounts to take place here.

222
00:15:25,887 --> 00:15:28,082
He wanted a sordid and vulgar incident.

223
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:31,085
He wanted to say
"I'm doing something different."

224
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:36,361
You think Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria
Volonté are gonna draw their guns here

225
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:40,162
but we're having Juan Miranda
played by Rod Steiger

226
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,757
in effect raping Adelita
played by Maria Monti

227
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:49,325
in an extremely vulgar
and off-putting way.

228
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:52,757
This sequence was missing
from the British print of the film

229
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,276
when it was first released.

230
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:25,080
of a piece of violence
or a moment of revelation.

231
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:29,041
You get cock s crowing at
all sorts of moments in Leone's films

232
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,237
at all times of day.

233
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,483
There's a running gag in the movie

234
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:36,041
about the size
of Juan Miranda's equipment

235
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:39,477
and how it compares to the size
of Pancho Villa's equipment.

236
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:42,201
Clearly Maria Monti is impressed.

237
00:16:49,287 --> 00:16:54,600
At one point in reference to
the 1930s Hollywood movie Viva Villa'

238
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:57,719
with Wallace Beery
about the life of Pancho Villa

239
00:16:57,847 --> 00:17:01,283
Juan Miranda says
"Villa had balls like a bull."

240
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:06,162
This idea of the bull
runs through this film as well.

241
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:09,882
The sexual politics are
I'm afraid not very subtle.

242
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:33,719
There was a cutaway just before this
sequence to the moment afterwards

243
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:37,601
when the inabitants of the coach
are walking past stark naked.

244
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:42,517
We were just left to imagine what
might have happened inside this shack.

245
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:11,599
This is the children the extended
family of Juan Miranda and his father

246
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:17,006
stripping the coach and the inabitants
ritually humiliating them

247
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:20,483
and of course
having built up a montage

248
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:23,485
of their horrible attitudes
towards the peasant bandit

249
00:18:23,607 --> 00:18:27,282
we think they deserve it
that they too are being stripped naked

250
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:32,276
in the way that they imagined
Juan Miranda was stripped naked earlier.

251
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:38,198
which recurs later in the film.

252
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:42,764
It's a mixture of usually
a penny whistle

253
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:46,277
a banjo or guitar whistling.

254
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:50,446
It's a kind of march
of the impoverished.

255
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:54,606
This will recur in a big scene
when they get to Mesa Verde.

256
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:58,515
The music was written in advance
but because things were so rushed

257
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:01,844
there was no opportunity
to have it recorded in advance

258
00:19:01,967 --> 00:19:06,199
so it wasn 't played on the set unlike
with Once Upon A Time In The West

259
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:09,205
but there are references
to the music in the film.

260
00:19:09,327 --> 00:19:11,318
People whistle the main theme

261
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:14,996
using the internal music
that Morricone specialised in.

262
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:17,687
So there are references to it
in the movie.

263
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:23,439
But the music is very different again
to the earlier Westerns.

264
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:29,085
There's less of it there are more
subtle variations on the main themes

265
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:32,756
and there's a lot of emphasis
on the singing of Edda dell'Orso

266
00:19:32,887 --> 00:19:34,878
the great soprano...

267
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,799
...whose voice is used
like a musical instrument.

268
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:42,036
At the very beginning we heard a bang

269
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:45,477
when Steiger was urinating
on the colony of ants.

270
00:19:45,607 --> 00:19:48,405
Was it thunder?
No it was an explosion.

271
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,324
Now we hear the whistling

272
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:54,360
the theme of the character
who's about to be introduced to us

273
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:56,284
the second great character.

274
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:58,557
If one theme is the Mexican Revolution

275
00:19:58,687 --> 00:20:02,919
and that turning point in 1913 when
things got completely out of control

276
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:07,598
the second theme is the friendship
between these two characters

277
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:09,524
and their effect on each other.

278
00:20:09,647 --> 00:20:12,207
On the one hand
a simple peasant bandit

279
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:15,239
who's instinctive
and isn 't interested in the revolution

280
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:20,839
and an intellectual revolutionary
from Ireland played by James Coburn

281
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:24,243
who after contact with the peasant
begins to understand

282
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,927
there's more to life than revolution

283
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:30,403
and becomes dependent on the peasant

284
00:20:30,527 --> 00:20:33,405
just as the peasant
develops a conscience

285
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:36,360
and begins to get involved
in the revolution.

286
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:40,526
So you've got a real relationship
between two human beings

287
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:43,445
making them develop as characters.

288
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:47,799
These are no longer the puppets
the icons of the early Italian Westerns.

289
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:51,124
These are human beings
who learn from each other.

290
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:06,563
James Coburn enters
not on a horse but on a motorbike.

291
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,396
A lot of the design of this film
was done by Andrea Crisanti

292
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,758
not Leone's usual designer
Carlo Simi

293
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:18,438
who was busy partly designing offices
for producer Alberto Grimaldi

294
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,762
and partly working on other films.

295
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:25,915
Andrea Crisanti's brief was to design
a film on the cusp of the modern world.

296
00:21:26,047 --> 00:21:30,837
Horses are turning into motorbikes
pistols into automatic weapons.

297
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:35,199
There are machine guns
barbed wire armoured cars trenches.

298
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,444
The modern world of World War I
is about to begin.

299
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:42,640
So the whole design is
what Crisanti called "transitional".

300
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:47,443
To have one of the cowboys enter
on a motorbike is an example of this.

301
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,558
James Coburn in a long duster

302
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:53,362
like those worn in
Once Upon A Time In The West

303
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:02,401
The film was to begin with an animated
sequence behind the credits

304
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:04,518
which is in the shooting script

305
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:07,923
where you have a map of Mexico
ringed with flame

306
00:22:08,047 --> 00:22:11,642
and you have Steiger the peasant
ploughing a field

307
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:16,238
and next to the field
is a trace of white line.

308
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:21,964
The white line goes down across the map
and it ends up at a detonator.

309
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:25,762
An animated hand comes into the frame
presses the detonator

310
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:29,880
there's a huge explosion
and the entire landscape is pulverised.

311
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:34,364
The peasant comes out look s around
and gets on with his ploughing.

312
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:38,002
The main title says in Italian
Gíú La Testa

313
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:41,676
keep your head down
keep out of it don 't get involved.

314
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:44,685
The phrase gíú la testa
was well-known Roman slang.

315
00:22:44,807 --> 00:22:49,403
Actually gíú la testa coglioni
which I won 't translate. It's very rude.

316
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:53,076
In France the film was known as
II était une fois la révolution

317
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,916
Once Upon A Time The Revolution
a much better title I think.

318
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:59,800
In America the film
was known as Duck You Sucker

319
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:03,397
which Leone thought
was a common phrase in the US

320
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:07,042
despite the fact that
everyone told him no one used it.

321
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:11,922
When the film wasn 't all that successful
at the box office first time round

322
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:14,845
the title was changed to
A Fistful Of Dynamite

323
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:19,563
to cash in on the success of Fistful Of
Dollars and the other two Dollars films.

324
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:22,918
The relationship between
the peasant and the revolution

325
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:25,720
is central to this theme of friendship.

326
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:29,840
The explosives man
and the instinctive peasant bandit.

327
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:05,517
James Coburn with his shrug

328
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:09,117
and his insouciant smile
and his fair colouring

329
00:24:09,247 --> 00:24:12,956
and his laid-back attitude
isn 't everyone's idea of an Irishman

330
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:16,284
but in this film he plays
an Irishman who's on the run

331
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:20,195
from the Irish troubles of 1913.

332
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:25,922
He's an IRA man
and this was an unusual historical slip.

333
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,844
If you're being pedantic

334
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:32,245
the IRA wasn 't founded till 1919
out of the Irish Republican Brotherhood.

335
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:34,358
In 1913 it didn 't exist.

336
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:39,117
But this isn 't the IRA of history
this is the IRA of John Ford's films

337
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:41,920
of the film The Informer of 1935

338
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:45,437
a huge influence on
the flashback sequences in this film

339
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,161
and of the film The Quiet Man
made in 1952

340
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,847
for the lush greenery
of the Irish landscape.

341
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:56,724
The Ireland of this film is the Ireland
of cinema rather than of the real world

342
00:24:56,847 --> 00:25:00,317
just as the Mexican Revolution
in this film

343
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:04,520
is the Mexican Revolution of Hollywood
of Pancho Villa La Cucaracha

344
00:25:04,647 --> 00:25:10,563
of cactus and crucifixes
Marlon Brando playing Zapata.

345
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:16,125
That's what Leone's making a film about
the Mexican Revolution of cinema.

346
00:25:16,247 --> 00:25:20,559
Here's the first religious reference.
You always get these in Leone's films.

347
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:26,041
Steiger imagines that he can rob
the national bank of Mesa Verde

348
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:28,635
so a halo appears over James Coburn

349
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:31,600
and an angelic choir sings
to a church organ

350
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:34,924
because he sees that this man
will help him rob the bank.

351
00:25:35,047 --> 00:25:37,959
Bank is associated
with the Holy Grail in this film

352
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:41,682
and lots of religious references
cluster round that.

353
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:07,799
There'll be a drawing
in the ruined stagecoach

354
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:11,966
of an altar with the Virgin Mary
associated with the bank at Mesa Verde.

355
00:26:12,087 --> 00:26:16,717
Later when they get to Mesa Verde
the entire bank will turn in Juan 's mind

356
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:19,441
into the exposition
of the Blessed Sacrament

357
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:21,637
with the holy wafer in the middle

358
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:25,601
It's about the most profane image
in Leone's entire cinema.

359
00:26:25,727 --> 00:26:28,605
The bank is associated
with the holiest of moments

360
00:26:28,727 --> 00:26:31,116
the transubstantiation of the communion.

361
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:35,081
So in Juan 's mind
money equals religion.

362
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:53,484
Coburn wasn 't the first choice
to play the Irishman.

363
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:56,485
As Eli Wallach was the first choice
to play Miranda

364
00:26:56,607 --> 00:27:01,522
the first choice for the Irishman Sean
was in fact Jason Robards.

365
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:11,118
But it didn 't work out and then the part
was slotted for Malcolm McDowell

366
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:14,125
the British actor
who'd just made his name in If

367
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:18,081
about a revolution in a private school
but that didn 't work out.

368
00:27:18,207 --> 00:27:21,995
United Artists wanted two big stars
the Oscar-winning Rod Steiger

369
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:24,118
and they wanted Coburn

370
00:27:24,247 --> 00:27:28,160
who'd made his name
in a Western in the late 1950s

371
00:27:33,247 --> 00:27:38,367
and The Great Escape and had been
a spy in a series of films about Flint

372
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:41,718
a spin -off from the James Bond films
in the mid 1960s.

373
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:45,476
In terms of popular cinema
Coburn was very well known in Europe

374
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:47,404
so James Coburn it was.

375
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:51,076
Leone wanted to contrast
the two acting styles the laid-back

376
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:55,200
and now Juan in Gíú La Testa
in Keep Your Head Down

377
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:59,843
the peasant bandit who eats a lot
swears a lot

378
00:27:59,967 --> 00:28:01,958
is on speaking terms with God.

379
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:05,443
He keeps talking to God
like the character Don Camillo

380
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:08,684
in the famous book s
written in Italy in the 1950s.

381
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:12,163
He seems to be on speaking terms
with God. He's very vulgar.

382
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:17,315
He stands against the high culture
of some of the other characters.

383
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:20,007
Leone's heart was
with characters like this.

384
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:24,678
He said "You can make movies
about revolution May '68 in Paris

385
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:27,799
be fashionably socialist
in the Italian Western

386
00:28:27,927 --> 00:28:30,600
but my heart is with the anarchist."

387
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:35,960
The anarchist who has cynicism
and really doesn 't believe in ideologies.

388
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:40,319
This is where Leone's heart lies.
Usually associated also with the family.

389
00:28:40,447 --> 00:28:42,722
We know about
Juan 's family background

390
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,600
just as we know
about Tuco with his brother

391
00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:48,287
and Cheyenne with his mother.

392
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:54,164
There's a background for these people
because Leone's heart is with them.

393
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:20,322
Italian politics at this time
in the late '60s early 'T'Os

394
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:22,438
was in something of a mess.

395
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:27,322
It was a time of polarisation
of the rise of terrorism for the first time

396
00:29:27,447 --> 00:29:30,007
of the far Left and the far Right.

397
00:29:30,127 --> 00:29:32,925
There was six months
when it proved impossible

398
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:35,277
to form a government in Italy.

399
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:39,685
Leone got increasingly disillusioned
with the political culture of Italy.

400
00:29:39,807 --> 00:29:42,879
He said "This movie
is saying all the things

401
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:45,805
I've been let down with
in the way of promises."

402
00:29:45,927 --> 00:29:49,556
The promise after the war
that a new society would be formed

403
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:53,316
the historic compromise
between the Left and the Right in Italy

404
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:57,042
the economic boom of the 1960s
didn 't turn into stable politics.

405
00:29:57,167 --> 00:30:00,603
So not only is he reacting
against political cinema

406
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:03,525
he's also reacting
against the politics of Italy.

407
00:30:03,647 --> 00:30:06,002
He said "When I look at the politics

408
00:30:06,127 --> 00:30:10,200
I'm left with my family
and my anarchic attitude to life."

409
00:30:10,327 --> 00:30:13,717
That was the baseline.
That's partly what this film's about.

410
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:18,235
The more that Juan gets drawn
into the revolution through Sean

411
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:20,756
the more he is doomed.

412
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:53,281
Second religious reference to the bank
in this drawing of the altar.

413
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:56,877
A little votive altar
put in the stagecoach

414
00:30:57,007 --> 00:31:01,080
to worship at the bank of Mesa Verde
the dream of a lifetime.

415
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:05,644
Often Leone's characters have a dream
of a lifetime that often destroys them

416
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:16,879
the most fortified bank in New York
and it destroys him.

417
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:20,602
There's a similar theme
coming through in Gíú La Testa

418
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:26,721
A lot of left-wing critics
were upset with Leone's attitude.

419
00:31:26,847 --> 00:31:30,396
They didn 't like this
keep your head down keep out of it

420
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:33,280
l-don 't-give-a-damn approach
to the revolution.

421
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:35,967
It wasn 't a fashionable stance.

422
00:31:36,087 --> 00:31:40,160
Many of the left-wing filmmakers
wrote saying that they thought

423
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:44,565
that by losing his innocence Leone had
moved into waters too deep for him

424
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:48,202
and that a film on this theme
didn 't do him any credit.

425
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:50,921
But interestingly Pier Paolo Pasolini

426
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:54,437
a socialist and at the height
of his powers as a filmmaker

427
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:58,276
said "Leone is incapable
of making an uninteresting film."

428
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:02,002
"This is one of the most
interesting films he's made."

429
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:05,437
There's an increasing seriousness
an interest in human beings

430
00:32:05,567 --> 00:32:09,526
and less of an interest in the idea
of the movie as a puppet show.

431
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:11,638
Still an interest in the surreal.

432
00:32:11,767 --> 00:32:15,157
They're sitting in the Almerían desert
on antique furniture

433
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:19,678
with Louis Vuitton luggage lying around
an extraordinary juxtaposition

434
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:26,201
the Almerían wilderness and all these
symbols of bourgeois respectability.

435
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:54,325
A heated discussion about this film was
whether it should be post-synchronised.

436
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:58,281
Steiger didn 't want to post-synchronise
his dialogue. He said

437
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:01,285
"I like my dialogue
to come out of me as I'm acting."

438
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:04,365
"You're taking away
half the performance."

439
00:33:04,487 --> 00:33:09,083
Leone said "Yeah
but we want to be noisy on the set

440
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:14,076
and there's aeroplanes from Madrid
airport so can 't we post-synchronise?"

441
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:19,565
So Steiger isn 't post-synchronised
for the dialogue-only scenes

442
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:23,123
but he is during the big action
sequences and the explosions

443
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:26,557
because they couldn 't record
his dialogue at the same time.

444
00:33:26,687 --> 00:33:30,965
This is the first non -post-synchronised
performance in Leone's cinema

445
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:34,079
because Rod Steiger
absolutely insisted on it.

446
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:18,040
Sean the Irish for John.

447
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:21,839
So he's Juan and the Irishman is John.

448
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:24,561
Both John.

449
00:34:38,247 --> 00:34:40,238
The first flashback.

450
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:45,000
As Sean remembers his time in Ireland

451
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,561
before he left for Mexico.

452
00:34:47,687 --> 00:34:52,203
His friend on the left played by
the New Zealand actor David Warbeck

453
00:34:52,327 --> 00:34:57,401
and an Irish colleen on the back seat
played by the actress Vivienne Chandler.

454
00:34:57,527 --> 00:35:00,803
These locations
for the outdoor scenes in Ireland

455
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:06,126
were done in County Wicklow in the
Sally Gap and the Glendalough Valley

456
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:10,365
the lush greenery of Wicklow in Ireland.

457
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:15,163
The soaring soprano voice
of Edda dell'Orso for Sean 's theme.

458
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:18,723
Originally
there weren 't to be words to this theme

459
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:23,079
but at an early stage standing round
a piano in Ennio Morricone's flat

460
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:26,165
Carla Leone Mrs Sergio Leone

461
00:35:26,287 --> 00:35:30,838
said "Why don 't you put words to it
and say Sean Sean Sean?"

462
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:35,279
So you have James Coburn 's name
woven into the lyric of the song

463
00:35:35,407 --> 00:35:38,843
the first time there'd been
a lyric with a point to it

464
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:41,322
in a Morricone theme for a Leone film.

465
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:46,157
The lyrics in the Westerns had been
completely incomprehensible.

466
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:49,882
There's a triangular relationship
between these Irish buddies

467
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:52,396
and the girl on the back seat.

468
00:35:57,367 --> 00:36:00,325
Again transformation of technology.

469
00:36:00,447 --> 00:36:04,326
There's a car. The horse has
turned into the horseless carriage

470
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:07,245
just as James Coburn rides a motorbike.

471
00:36:23,127 --> 00:36:25,960
Nitroglycerine referred to
as holy water

472
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:30,080
another religious reference
in the iconography of the film.

473
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:39,524
As a way of signalling the fact
that he was moving in a new direction

474
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:42,161
as Leone put it this film is set

475
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:46,838
between the twilight of the American
frontier and the dark night of the city

476
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:50,243
which would be Once Upon A Time
In America that followed it.

477
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:52,517
Signalling this changed atmosphere

478
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:56,435
there are various new people
on the technical side in the movie.

479
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:59,365
Director of photography
was Giuseppe Ruzzolini

480
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:03,241
the man who worked very often
with Pasolini rather than with Leone

481
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:08,395
no longer Tonino Delli Colli who shot
The Good The Bad And The Ugly

482
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:12,759
The designer as we've heard is
Andrea Crisanti rather than Carlo Simi.

483
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:18,245
Same editor as The Good
The Bad And The Ugly Nino Baragli

484
00:37:18,367 --> 00:37:22,918
but different actors different key
personnel the other side of the camera.

485
00:37:23,047 --> 00:37:26,881
This is as Leone put it a prelude
to Once Upon A Time In America

486
00:37:27,007 --> 00:37:30,283
Once Upon A Time In The West
was the Western to end them all

487
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:32,398
about the ending of the frontier.

488
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:36,679
This is between the frontier and
the rise of the gangsters in the 1920s.

489
00:37:36,807 --> 00:37:41,278
There are lots of references written
into the film quite late in the process

490
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:44,797
to immigration to the United States
the melting pot.

491
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:49,876
They talk about crossing the border
to "the land of milk and honey".

492
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:54,876
Not to do evening classes
or make something of themselves

493
00:37:55,007 --> 00:37:59,319
but because the bank s may be bigger
and more juicy on the other side.

494
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:03,838
This is the immigrants' dream
of this period the 1910s the 1920s

495
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:06,561
so the title Once Upon A Time The Revolution

496
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:13,760
Once Upon A Time In The West
The Revolution In America

497
00:38:13,887 --> 00:38:18,199
Three fairy tales on an epic tapestry
of the story of America

498
00:38:18,327 --> 00:38:23,321
in the first part of the 20th century
and the last part of the 19th century.

499
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:30,917
James Coburn like Clint Eastwood

500
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:34,483
persuaded Leone to reduce
the number of lines that he had.

501
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:37,917
He twigged that he'd be
the strong silent type

502
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:40,436
and Steiger would be the voice.

503
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:44,757
In fact Leone treated Coburn as he put it

504
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:50,280
as a Clint Eastwood with extra panache
attached to his performance.

505
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:54,525
He found Coburn hilarious
and very professional to work with.

506
00:38:54,647 --> 00:38:57,366
Although Leone and Steiger rowed a lot on set

507
00:38:57,487 --> 00:38:59,557
in fact it was during this sequence

508
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:04,761
that the row came to a head
with Steiger walking off

509
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:07,242
in retrospect Steiger said Leone was

510
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:10,359
one of the best directors of actors
he'd encountered.

511
00:39:10,487 --> 00:39:14,196
So many close-ups so many
great charismatic introductions

512
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:18,525
you can 't imagine getting
a better push to your performance

513
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,081
than the cinematic style of Sergio Leone.

514
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:24,677
He said this at a seminar which
Martin Scorsese was present at

515
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:28,356
which introduced Martin Scorsese
to the work of Sergio Leone.

516
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:32,366
But on this day they'd worked
till eight o'clock at night

517
00:39:32,487 --> 00:39:36,196
it had been a 13-hour day
and Steiger said "Enough's enough."

518
00:39:36,327 --> 00:39:41,959
"We've been over these scenes.
I'm going back to the hotel in Almería."

519
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:45,682
Leone said "You do that
and I won 't speak to you again."

520
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:50,483
Steiger did go back to his hotel in
Almería which was about 15 miles away.

521
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:54,202
For a couple of days
Leone would only speak to him

522
00:39:54,327 --> 00:39:58,115
through an interpreter or an assistant director

523
00:39:58,247 --> 00:40:00,238
with various messages such as

524
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:04,360
"Will you tell Mr Steiger to stop
wiggling his ears so much?"

525
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:23,478
The sounds associated with Juan are

526
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:28,283
as Ennio Morricone put it
like the stomach rumbling.

527
00:40:28,407 --> 00:40:31,956
It's the stomach.
It's the sound of a hungry peasant.

528
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:35,079
It's also a sound
of bodily functions and vulgarity

529
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:38,085
which will be contrasted
with other forms of music.

530
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:41,085
So Sean gets the whistling
and the Sean Sean Sean.

531
00:40:41,207 --> 00:40:43,801
Juan gets the burping noises
of the bassoon.

532
00:41:12,247 --> 00:41:16,160
The international release print
of this film stopped here

533
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:19,996
and cut a huge chunk
out of the end of this sequence

534
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:22,163
and the subsequent sequence

535
00:41:22,287 --> 00:41:25,677
which lost a lot of material
for understanding the story

536
00:41:25,807 --> 00:41:28,241
because we cut from
the explosion of the stagecoach

537
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,275
to Sean who seems to be
the worst for wear

538
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,126
he's been drinking
or he's got a hangover

539
00:41:36,247 --> 00:41:38,636
or there's something on his mind

540
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:41,998
next to a detonator.

541
00:41:56,527 --> 00:41:58,836
Sean is a self-destructive character.

542
00:41:58,967 --> 00:42:02,721
He's a revolutionary who's
in the process of losing his ideals

543
00:42:02,847 --> 00:42:04,917
and he takes it out on himself.

544
00:42:05,047 --> 00:42:07,959
He's almost suicidally self-destructive

545
00:42:08,087 --> 00:42:10,681
and of course at the end

546
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:13,560
this does lead to a form of suicide.

547
00:42:13,687 --> 00:42:19,717
But here he's paralytic drunk
next to a detonator in Mexico at night.

548
00:42:19,847 --> 00:42:22,122
We don 't quite know what's going on

549
00:42:22,247 --> 00:42:26,320
except there are figures running around
who are Juan 's children

550
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:28,244
in this ruined place.

551
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:30,801
The whole of this sequence was missing.

552
00:42:30,927 --> 00:42:33,521
It was only put back recently.

553
00:42:34,607 --> 00:42:36,996
The wire to the detonator.

554
00:42:38,927 --> 00:42:42,476
Sean has said that he work s
for a German called Aschenbach

555
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:46,919
who employs him
on behalf of mining interests.

556
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:51,325
This scene is all about
getting rid of Mr Aschenbach.

557
00:42:53,927 --> 00:42:58,842
Juan wants to get rid of Aschenbach
so that Sean will concentrate on his task

558
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:02,642
which is to get to Mesa Verde
and rob that big bank.

559
00:43:02,767 --> 00:43:04,678
He doesn 't want any distractions.

560
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:07,480
It's a strangely callous
and odd sequence.

561
00:43:07,607 --> 00:43:10,917
So the detonator is wired up.

562
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:14,642
Coburn clearly doesn 't know
what's going on around him.

563
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:21,839
There's no narrative background to this.
Leone doesn 't give us any clues.

564
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:46,118
You don 't need to see Steiger
just his shoes and his legs.

565
00:43:46,247 --> 00:43:50,798
That tells you all you need to know.
People are signalled by their clothes.

566
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:53,919
We now recognise him
by his hat and his shoes.

567
00:43:58,127 --> 00:44:01,244
Juan has less of a conscience.

568
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:04,200
He's prepared to blow up
whoever's inside there.

569
00:44:04,327 --> 00:44:07,080
It is in fact Aschenbach
and his mine workers

570
00:44:07,207 --> 00:44:09,198
all destroyed.

571
00:44:10,847 --> 00:44:14,522
Coburn has more of a refined sensibility.

572
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:25,678
But there's no explanation at this stage
of why Coburn was drinking

573
00:44:25,807 --> 00:44:30,801
why he's finding himself paralytic drunk
in this part of the country

574
00:44:30,927 --> 00:44:35,000
and why Juan assisted him
in this explosion.

575
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:47,765
The characteristic shape of the screen
referred to on three occasions

576
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:51,641
when a letterbox image appears
within the letterbox image

577
00:44:51,767 --> 00:44:54,361
was part of the Techniscope process

578
00:44:54,487 --> 00:44:58,116
that Leone had used
since his early days of making Westerns

579
00:44:58,247 --> 00:45:00,966
A Fistful Of Dollars a few years before.

580
00:45:01,087 --> 00:45:04,636
It's a poor man 's CinemaScope
a cheap version of CinemaScope

581
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:07,520
which was very popular
in Italy in the 1960s.

582
00:45:07,647 --> 00:45:10,115
It's great for going in on people's faces

583
00:45:10,247 --> 00:45:15,002
cutting off their chins the top of
their heads and great for long shots.

584
00:45:15,127 --> 00:45:19,484
It had limitations but it became
a characteristic pictorial shape

585
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:22,599
for this period
in Italian popular cinema.

586
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:26,481
Later on Juan will carve

587
00:45:26,607 --> 00:45:31,840
a letterbox-shaped hole to see through
when he gets to Mesa Verde.

588
00:45:31,967 --> 00:45:36,040
And on the railway truck they'll
take a slat out and look through it

589
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,158
providing a letterbox image.

590
00:45:38,287 --> 00:45:43,680
So he's drawing attention to the shape
of the screen during the story.

591
00:46:04,087 --> 00:46:07,523
The expletives in the film
were also cut on first release.

592
00:46:07,647 --> 00:46:11,242
Both Sean and John use
the word "fucking" quite liberally

593
00:46:11,367 --> 00:46:13,403
on various occasions.

594
00:46:13,527 --> 00:46:16,803
It's part of the flamboyance
of their relationship.

595
00:46:16,927 --> 00:46:19,805
In 19T'1 this was thought to be too strong

596
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:24,159
so all references to that word were
excised from the international print.

597
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:26,676
They've now been put back.

598
00:46:31,327 --> 00:46:35,445
This was where the cut came back in
in the original print in 19T'1

599
00:46:35,567 --> 00:46:37,797
missing out the whole of that digression.

600
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:40,361
So we went from the stagecoach blowing up

601
00:46:40,487 --> 00:46:44,321
to their riding along the railway line together.

602
00:46:51,807 --> 00:46:55,561
The usual theme of Hollywood movies
about the Mexican Revolution

603
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:59,282
was of an American journalist
or soldier of fortune

604
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:03,400
going south across the border
and intervening in the revolution.

605
00:47:07,047 --> 00:47:11,518
and countless popular films about
Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata.

606
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:14,207
What tended to happen
was he was a journalist

607
00:47:14,327 --> 00:47:17,683
or with Robert Mitchum in one film
a soldier of fortune.

608
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:20,640
The focus of the film was on the American

609
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:24,601
and Mexico was a place where
a lot of violent things happened

610
00:47:24,727 --> 00:47:27,161
a place of lost ideals of redemption.

611
00:47:27,287 --> 00:47:31,963
In Sam Peckinpah's movies it's where
you go to recover your lost illusions

612
00:47:32,087 --> 00:47:34,476
and drink yourself silly.

613
00:47:34,607 --> 00:47:38,395
So Mexico is a symbolic place.
You cross the border into another land

614
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:40,324
where things happen to you.

615
00:47:40,447 --> 00:47:43,723
But Leone wants to take Mexico
for Mexico's sake

616
00:47:43,847 --> 00:47:45,883
not treat it as that kind of symbol.

617
00:47:46,007 --> 00:47:49,158
The focus is not
on an American soldier of fortune.

618
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:53,758
It's on an Irish dynamite expert
and a Mexican peasant.

619
00:47:54,687 --> 00:47:56,837
But he's playing cinematic games.

620
00:47:56,967 --> 00:48:00,357
Just as he refers to Hollywood Westerns
in his Dollars films

621
00:48:00,487 --> 00:48:04,162
he's referring to Hollywood movies
about the Mexican Revolution

622
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:06,801
and playing with people's expectations.

623
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:10,285
The third major character
played by Romolo Valli

624
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:15,322
was in fact a theatre actor in the
1950s who'd run a theatrical festival.

625
00:48:15,447 --> 00:48:19,838
He was trained as a medic and he'd
appeared in two Visconti films recently

626
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,401
in the The Leopard
as the Jesuit priest

627
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:26,122
attached to the house of Don Fabrizio
played by Burt Lancaster

628
00:48:26,247 --> 00:48:29,876
and in Death in Venice he played
the manager of the Hotel des Bains

629
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,804
on the lido in Venice.

630
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:33,804
He was a close friend of Leone.

631
00:48:33,927 --> 00:48:39,081
Leone added the medical background
to the character of Dr Villega

632
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:44,201
as a reference to the fact that Romolo
Valli in real life was a trained medic.

633
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:47,284
A third acting style.

634
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:53,004
If Steiger is the method and Coburn
is the traditional Hollywood hero

635
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:55,880
Romolo Valli comes from a theatrical tradition.

636
00:48:56,007 --> 00:48:58,123
It's very much part of his character.

637
00:48:58,247 --> 00:49:01,444
The character is full of ambiguities
as we'll see.

638
00:49:01,567 --> 00:49:06,038
He's the one who break s under interrogation

639
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:10,797
and causes a whole chain of tragedies
to follow from that later in the story.

640
00:49:10,927 --> 00:49:17,446
In the Dollars films double crosses
and people being tortured

641
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:22,083
and the idea of capture and escape
were treated as a joke

642
00:49:22,207 --> 00:49:26,837
as a picaresque fantasy a never-ending
adventure in the style of Don Quixote.

643
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:29,561
In this film such things have consequences.

644
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:34,203
When someone's betrayed when
there's violence it has consequences.

645
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:37,763
There's a seriousness about people's actions

646
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:40,959
which was completely lacking
from the Dollars films.

647
00:49:41,087 --> 00:49:44,557
There are also lots of references
to subsequent events

648
00:49:44,687 --> 00:49:47,326
in the 20th century in this film.

649
00:49:47,447 --> 00:49:52,157
The pivotal sequence that takes place
in the grotto of San Isidro

650
00:49:52,287 --> 00:49:57,680
is in fact a reference to a very famous
event that occurred just outside Rome

651
00:49:57,807 --> 00:50:01,766
at the end of the Via Ardeatine
in the Ardeatine caves

652
00:50:01,887 --> 00:50:05,926
where the SS which had been based
in the Via Tasso in Rome

653
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:08,686
went out and as a reprisal for a bomb attack

654
00:50:08,807 --> 00:50:13,562
shot 335 Roman civilians who'd just been
rounded up off the streets.

655
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:18,807
They were put into a cave and
the entrance to the cave was dynamited.

656
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:24,718
When the Nazis left Rome in 1945
they hoped no trace of it would be found.

657
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:27,202
In fact it was dug out shortly afterwards

658
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:30,922
and it became a major piece of Italian history

659
00:50:31,047 --> 00:50:33,880
the massacre in the Ardeatine caves.

660
00:50:34,007 --> 00:50:39,240
The grotto later on in this film is
a reference to what happened in 1944

661
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:44,157
just as the ditches in which Huerta's
soldiers massacre people later on

662
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:48,121
is a reference to the Nazi death camps
with their ditches.

663
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:50,363
As Sergio Leone said

664
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:54,400
the ditches and death pits
of Dachau and Mauthausen

665
00:50:54,527 --> 00:50:57,166
were a direct reference at that point.

666
00:50:57,287 --> 00:51:01,166
He even shows an actor at one point
who resembled the young Mussolini

667
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:04,279
'cause he wanted to make a point
about the fascist regime.

668
00:51:04,407 --> 00:51:07,717
Although this is a film
about the Mexican Revolution 1913

669
00:51:07,847 --> 00:51:10,919
it's also about warfare and cruelty

670
00:51:11,047 --> 00:51:14,676
and the end of fascism and decadence
and redundant violence

671
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:18,925
as a regime clings on to power at this
particular moment in the revolution.

672
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:22,119
So it's about the whole of the 20th century.

673
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:24,044
In The Good The Bad And The Ugly

674
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:27,762
the concentration camp sequences
referenced the 20th century.

675
00:51:27,887 --> 00:51:31,926
So did the battle of the bridge like
the trenches of the First World War.

676
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:35,722
There's lots of detail
it's very historically specific

677
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:38,964
but the setups are also
about other aspects of history

678
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:43,842
which would have made complete sense
to viewers in Italy in the early 19T'Os.

679
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,764
There's even autobiography.

680
00:51:45,887 --> 00:51:48,924
There's the opening
with the urination competition.

681
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:55,839
Also in 1944 the resistance
was in the hills outside Rome.

682
00:51:55,967 --> 00:51:58,276
The revolutionary cells of Pancho Villa

683
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:01,717
referred to later
are very like the resistance movements

684
00:52:01,847 --> 00:52:04,725
when the Nazis
had occupied Rome in 1944-5.

685
00:52:04,847 --> 00:52:08,840
The young Leone desperately wanted
to join the resistance in the hills.

686
00:52:08,967 --> 00:52:14,166
His father Vincenzo Leone
shielded some Jewish families

687
00:52:14,287 --> 00:52:17,996
in order to protect them from the Nazis in 1944.

688
00:52:18,127 --> 00:52:21,324
But Leone's mother
Bice Beatrice wouldn 't let him go.

689
00:52:21,447 --> 00:52:24,519
He was a much-Ioved only child.

690
00:52:24,647 --> 00:52:27,207
A lot of Leone's contemporaries did join

691
00:52:27,327 --> 00:52:30,080
who became directors of films in the 1960s.

692
00:52:30,207 --> 00:52:33,279
Part of the politics
of those 1960s Italian Westerns

693
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,399
is reference to the Second World War.

694
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:56,360
Now they arrive at Mesa Verde.
The location was Almería station.

695
00:52:57,447 --> 00:53:01,440
It's still there
a wonderful 19th-century construction.

696
00:53:19,727 --> 00:53:25,324
With their suitcases Juan 's extended
family are like a bunch of tourists

697
00:53:25,447 --> 00:53:27,438
arriving at a tourist site in Spain.

698
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:30,957
Here they are in the waiting room
of Almería station.

699
00:53:33,527 --> 00:53:37,520
The arrival in Mesa Verde.
These are rural people arriving in the city

700
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:42,038
where all the streets are paved
with gold or they hope they are.

701
00:54:07,927 --> 00:54:13,160
These sequences were filmed
in the town of Guadix north of Almería

702
00:54:13,287 --> 00:54:16,996
in the esplanade in front
of the 16th-century church of Santiago

703
00:54:17,127 --> 00:54:18,924
which has a slope.

704
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:22,960
It's the old town of Guadix
which was used for lots of sequences

705
00:54:23,087 --> 00:54:24,884
in particular here a wall

706
00:54:25,007 --> 00:54:28,920
against which the firing squad
is shooting various partisans.

707
00:54:29,047 --> 00:54:31,561
So Huerta's regime clinging on to power

708
00:54:31,687 --> 00:54:35,236
against the revolutionary impulse
unleashed by Madero

709
00:54:35,367 --> 00:54:39,201
are shooting left right and centre
in order to hang on.

710
00:54:39,327 --> 00:54:43,525
This is the world that Juan has entered
by coming to Mesa Verde.

711
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:47,956
It's like a police state.

712
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:32,398
This scene was based on
a series of archive photographs

713
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:35,439
that Leone found
of the Mexican Revolution

714
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:39,765
in an archive near Mexico City
which had been reproduced in book s

715
00:55:39,887 --> 00:55:41,957
of a famous shot of a firing squad

716
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:45,238
where someone is lighting a cigar
just before being shot

717
00:55:45,367 --> 00:55:49,280
and the next shot is them lying
on the ground in their civilian clothes

718
00:55:49,407 --> 00:55:52,001
having been shot by the firing squad.

719
00:56:05,847 --> 00:56:10,284
Here's the letterbox reference
the first of them.

720
00:56:10,407 --> 00:56:15,720
So Juan look s through the poster of
the governor and sees what's going on.

721
00:56:16,927 --> 00:56:19,316
A letterbox within a letterbox.

722
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:33,318
Bernardo Bertolucci said this was
one of his favourite moments in the film

723
00:56:33,447 --> 00:56:39,204
because it draws attention to the artificiality
of the shape of the image.

724
00:56:39,967 --> 00:56:42,117
This is the bank in Mesa Verde

725
00:56:42,247 --> 00:56:45,398
with the showing of the
Blessed Sacrament over the door

726
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,485
with the host in the middle
with church organ music.

727
00:56:48,607 --> 00:56:50,598
This is the Holy Grail.

728
00:56:50,727 --> 00:56:53,446
All the book s about Leone
and people at the time

729
00:56:53,567 --> 00:56:56,161
said this was located in Burgos in Spain.

730
00:56:56,287 --> 00:57:00,405
I went to Burgos and I couldn 't find it.
It isn 't located in Burgos.

731
00:57:00,527 --> 00:57:02,802
Andrea Crisanti built the whole square

732
00:57:02,927 --> 00:57:06,806
including the bank
and the cafe to the left as a set.

733
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:12,126
It was the square of Medinaceli in a
small village near Guadalajara in Spain.

734
00:57:12,247 --> 00:57:17,082
It was a deserted village
occupied only by a colony of painters.

735
00:57:17,207 --> 00:57:20,802
They built the central square
of Mesa Verde around it.

736
00:57:20,927 --> 00:57:25,045
So this place doesn 't exist.
It was built to Andrea Crisanti's design.

737
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:29,319
They bought lots of fixtures and fittings
from markets in Madrid

738
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:32,405
and tiles and mosaics
and decorated the set

739
00:57:32,527 --> 00:57:35,121
to make it look authentically Mexican.

740
00:57:43,647 --> 00:57:48,243
The sound of motors in the background
a new sound in Leone's cinema.

741
00:57:48,367 --> 00:57:52,360
He'd been used to horses' hooves
gunshots and the cocking of rifles.

742
00:57:52,487 --> 00:57:55,684
But now we have the sound of lorries
and armoured cars

743
00:57:55,807 --> 00:57:59,880
and more modern locomotives
and automatic weapons.

744
00:58:00,007 --> 00:58:04,125
It's a different kind of sound in the
background to the story of the heroes.

745
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:07,239
Here's Sean having another drink

746
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:10,962
as we saw him having a drink
when killing Aschenbach.

747
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:51,358
Sean is luring Juan into this idea
of robbing the bank of Mesa Verde

748
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:55,480
as we discover for his own purposes
and Juan is taking the bait.

749
00:58:55,607 --> 00:58:59,566
A second reference to Ireland
where Sean 's friend

750
00:58:59,687 --> 00:59:03,839
the David Warbeck character
is distributing leaflets in Ireland

751
00:59:03,967 --> 00:59:06,686
before Sean and friend left.

752
00:59:06,807 --> 00:59:11,801
This sequence was filmed
in Toner's pub in Dublin which is still there

753
00:59:11,927 --> 00:59:15,840
and is one of the more traditional pubs
of Dublin that's survived.

754
00:59:15,967 --> 00:59:18,401
It's sacred turf for Leone buffs.

755
00:59:18,527 --> 00:59:21,280
They have a drink there
when they're in Ireland.

756
00:59:21,407 --> 00:59:24,285
The locations were found
by Sergio Leone

757
00:59:24,407 --> 00:59:27,365
with help from John Boorman
the film director

758
00:59:27,487 --> 00:59:31,241
who lives outside Dublin and had
made Point Blank and Deliverance

759
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,164
two favourite Leone films.

760
00:59:33,287 --> 00:59:38,407
So Boorman located the pub
the landscapes in County Wicklow

761
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:42,202
where the rural scenes
of the flashback s were shown.

762
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:50,524
to the Westerns of John Ford
in particular those starring John Wayne

763
00:59:50,647 --> 00:59:53,639
films such as Stagecoach
and The Searchers

764
00:59:53,767 --> 00:59:57,806
so in this film there are references
to John Ford's two Irish films

765
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:01,602
The Informer which was run
during the writing of the film

766
01:00:01,727 --> 01:00:04,719
and also The Quiet Man in the 1950s.

767
01:00:04,847 --> 01:00:08,806
The script started life as a remake

768
01:00:08,927 --> 01:00:11,999
of Ben Hecht's script for Viva Villa'

769
01:00:16,327 --> 01:00:20,115
Leone thought he'd buy the rights
to this and remake Viva Villa'

770
01:00:20,247 --> 01:00:22,556
he had a lot of time for that script

771
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:27,442
with Toshirô Mifune who played
the samurai in Yojimbo for Kurosawa

772
01:00:27,567 --> 01:00:30,445
and also appeared in The Seven Samurai

773
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:32,558
playing the part of Pancho Villa.

774
01:00:32,687 --> 01:00:35,360
So it started out
as a remake of Viva Villa'

775
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:41,119
Then Sergio Donati by now one of
Sergio Leone's regular scriptwriters

776
01:00:41,247 --> 01:00:45,843
came up with this treatment about
an IRA man and a Mexican peasant

777
01:00:45,967 --> 01:00:47,958
and the relationship between them

778
01:00:48,087 --> 01:00:52,717
as a riff on the kind of political
movie being made in Italy at the time.

779
01:00:52,847 --> 01:00:55,964
They worked on it together
on Once Upon A Time In The West

780
01:00:56,087 --> 01:01:00,683
in the spring of 1968 and refined the story.

781
01:01:00,807 --> 01:01:05,198
Then Donati wrote it as a script
by the late '60s

782
01:01:05,327 --> 01:01:09,957
at which point Leone handed it
on to Luciano Vincenzoni

783
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:12,157
who added the more humorous moments.

784
01:01:12,287 --> 01:01:14,721
Social comedy was very much his forte.

785
01:01:14,847 --> 01:01:18,476
Then the script went back to Donati
for the final polishing-up.

786
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:23,158
So it was a script by Sergio Donati
with additions by Luciano Vincenzoni.

787
01:01:23,287 --> 01:01:27,166
It's interesting that it started out
as a remake of a Hollywood movie.

788
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:29,278
Leone was getting big ideas.

789
01:01:29,407 --> 01:01:34,003
He announced in 1969 that he was
going to remake Gone With The Wind

790
01:01:34,127 --> 01:01:36,516
It showed the extent his ambition.

791
01:01:36,647 --> 01:01:40,560
His films were getting bigger and
bigger more and more expensive.

792
01:01:40,687 --> 01:01:43,042
So the gestation of this film was odd.

793
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:45,727
Leone wasn 't to direct it

794
01:01:45,847 --> 01:01:49,965
the script had turned into something
different to what they started with

795
01:01:50,087 --> 01:01:52,885
the music wasn 't written very far in advance

796
01:01:53,007 --> 01:01:57,239
and they were actors that
Leone wasn 't used to dealing with.

797
01:01:57,367 --> 01:01:59,562
But there's a maturity about the film

798
01:01:59,687 --> 01:02:03,157
suggesting that it had been
on Leone's mind for a long time.

799
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:05,881
He claimed that
when he took over as director

800
01:02:06,007 --> 01:02:09,283
he only had about a week
to get things together

801
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:12,604
but clearly he'd been
thinking about it for six months.

802
01:02:12,727 --> 01:02:16,356
When he arrived he had every sequence
imprinted in his mind.

803
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:19,877
No storyboards but he had
an enormous visual memory.

804
01:02:20,007 --> 01:02:22,805
The thing Rod Steiger
remembered most about Leone

805
01:02:22,927 --> 01:02:26,636
was he had an extraordinarily
pure vision in his head.

806
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:29,645
He'd arrive tell everyone
where to put the setups.

807
01:02:29,767 --> 01:02:32,520
He had an absolutely clear idea
of what he wanted.

808
01:02:32,647 --> 01:02:37,437
They worked long days
and sometimes did 25 takes to get there

809
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:40,286
but he knew exactly what he wanted in the end.

810
01:02:40,407 --> 01:02:44,798
For Steiger that was one of
the most impressive things about Leone.

811
01:02:50,927 --> 01:02:53,805
Another setting
where Juan doesn 't feel at home

812
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:58,318
the revolutionary cell under Dr Villega
the revolutionary strategist.

813
01:02:58,447 --> 01:03:01,484
He's a medical doctor
who does a bit of surgery

814
01:03:01,607 --> 01:03:04,121
but he's also
a revolutionary strategist.

815
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:08,638
The idea of the revolutionary cell
the revolutionary programme

816
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:12,885
had been part of a lot of
celebrated Italian movies in the 1960s

817
01:03:13,007 --> 01:03:16,443
including Gillo Pontecorvo's
The Battle Of Algiers

818
01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:19,559
The Battle Of Algiers
was written by Franco Solinas

819
01:03:19,687 --> 01:03:22,599
who went on to write
either the story or the treatment

820
01:03:22,727 --> 01:03:27,039
for a whole series of political Italian
Westerns in the mid to late 1960s.

821
01:03:27,167 --> 01:03:30,557
The revolutionary cell
was usually treated with reverence.

822
01:03:30,687 --> 01:03:35,158
This was where strategy was planned.
It was a chance to talk about socialism.

823
01:03:35,287 --> 01:03:38,916
In this the point is
that Juan is completely out of place

824
01:03:39,047 --> 01:03:43,199
and doesn 't quite know why he's here
and why are we listening to this?

825
01:03:43,327 --> 01:03:47,206
Juan isn 't a revolutionary.
He's had no contact with the revolution.

826
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:50,285
He says keep your head down
and so does Sean

827
01:03:50,407 --> 01:03:52,762
so why are we hearing about this strategy?

828
01:03:52,887 --> 01:03:55,401
It's to build up the character of Villega

829
01:03:55,527 --> 01:04:00,760
but it's also to show how
Juan is perhaps beginning to think

830
01:04:00,887 --> 01:04:04,880
that there's more to this revolution
than meets the eye.

831
01:04:44,607 --> 01:04:48,077
Juan think s he's attacking the bank
because of the money in it

832
01:04:48,207 --> 01:04:50,767
something he's dreamed about for years

833
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,606
but the revolutionary cell has different ideas.

834
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:57,083
Something else going on
in the bank serves their interests

835
01:04:57,207 --> 01:05:00,279
which is why they're using Juan
quite mercilessly

836
01:05:00,407 --> 01:05:03,558
to achieve their objective for them.

837
01:05:03,687 --> 01:05:07,202
Romolo Valli would have been
remembered by Italian audiences

838
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:12,685
as appearing in the two big Luchino
Visconti films of the mid to late 1960s.

839
01:05:12,807 --> 01:05:17,198
There's an interesting relationship
between Leone's and Visconti's cinema.

840
01:05:17,327 --> 01:05:22,560
Visconti interested in detailed production design
in a peepshow view of the past.

841
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:28,239
Layers of historical accuracy
in The Leopard to look at an estate

842
01:05:28,367 --> 01:05:31,598
run by the aristocrat Don Fabrizio
in the 19th century.

843
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:35,925
In Death In Venice
the decadence of Venice in the off season.

844
01:05:36,047 --> 01:05:38,959
Incredible period detail.
That they have in common.

845
01:05:39,087 --> 01:05:41,555
There's a scene in
Once Upon A Time In The West

846
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:45,965
of Claudia Cardinale lying on her bed
shot from above by Tonino Delli Colli.

847
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:50,080
The camera comes down through
the lace netting of the four-poster bed

848
01:05:50,207 --> 01:05:53,040
and changes focus
and goes onto Cardinale's face

849
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:59,481
which is very similar to a shot in The Leopard
where Cardinale also appeared.

850
01:05:59,607 --> 01:06:02,246
Bernardo Bertolucci once said of Leone

851
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:06,682
that he's like Visconti only
he's coming at it from a different angle.

852
01:06:06,807 --> 01:06:12,279
There's the sense of mise en scéne
of design of opera that the two share

853
01:06:12,407 --> 01:06:17,561
but with Leone it's a Roman
petit bourgeois approach

854
01:06:17,687 --> 01:06:23,364
and in the case of Visconti it's
an aristocrat looking at the past of Italy.

855
01:06:23,487 --> 01:06:28,083
I would argue that although Visconti
is much revered as a filmmaker

856
01:06:28,207 --> 01:06:31,165
Sergio Leone was a much better storyteller.

857
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:35,246
Visconti didn 't have that common touch
of how to tell these stories

858
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:40,395
in a way that kept the audience interested
and told these popular stories.

859
01:06:40,527 --> 01:06:45,965
Visconti felt as if he was slumming it
when he made films whereas Leone loves it.

860
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:49,796
He loved the movies and was
a movie man from his fingertips.

861
01:06:49,927 --> 01:06:52,885
Leone once said
"I was born in the cinema almost."

862
01:06:53,007 --> 01:06:56,124
Aged 12 he visited Cinecittá studios
to see his father

863
01:06:56,247 --> 01:06:58,044
Vincenzo Leone make a movie.

864
01:06:58,167 --> 01:07:02,080
And Leone died in 1989
while watching a movie on television

865
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:06,439
called I Want to Live' with Susan Hayward
as his heart packed up.

866
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:08,558
His life was book-ended by cinema.

867
01:07:08,687 --> 01:07:11,565
He was the most cine-literate man
you can imagine.

868
01:07:11,687 --> 01:07:15,362
He could describe whole sequences
of Hollywood movies.

869
01:07:15,487 --> 01:07:18,081
That is not something Visconti could say.

870
01:07:18,207 --> 01:07:20,562
He didn 't have that cinematic culture.

871
01:07:20,687 --> 01:07:25,203
So I'd argue against all the critics
that Leone was the better storyteller

872
01:07:25,327 --> 01:07:27,602
one of the greatest filmic storytellers

873
01:07:27,727 --> 01:07:30,799
to have come out of Europe
in the 20th century.

874
01:07:30,927 --> 01:07:34,283
The toy train with
"Johnny & Johnny" written on it

875
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:36,841
is another Leone favourite.

876
01:07:36,967 --> 01:07:41,119
Very often in Leone's films you have
characters playing with toy devices

877
01:07:41,247 --> 01:07:43,124
which play a part in the plot.

878
01:07:43,247 --> 01:07:46,956
El Indio in For A Few Dollars More
with the toy safe from El Paso.

879
01:07:47,087 --> 01:07:50,363
Mr Morton in Once Upon A Time
In The West with the toy train

880
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:55,117
explaining how he's trying to lay track s
right across America.

881
01:07:55,247 --> 01:07:58,557
Here a toy train is pulled in front of the bank

882
01:07:58,687 --> 01:08:03,477
as a decoy for the explosives
to blow the entrance of Mesa Verde.

883
01:08:17,407 --> 01:08:21,798
Sean knows why so many soldiers
surround the bank but Juan doesn 't.

884
01:08:28,207 --> 01:08:32,644
In the background some of the tiles
purchased by Andrea Crisanti

885
01:08:32,767 --> 01:08:36,806
as set dressing to give
a sense of early 20th-century detail

886
01:08:36,927 --> 01:08:41,079
to this café on the corner
of the square in Mesa Verde.

887
01:08:41,207 --> 01:08:43,516
The design is different to Carlo Simi.

888
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:48,482
It's less larger than life less over
the top than Simi's Western towns.

889
01:08:48,607 --> 01:08:53,556
There's more realism in the backgrounds.
It's a different approach.

890
01:08:53,687 --> 01:08:57,396
Andrea Crisanti had designed films
for Francesco Rosi

891
01:08:57,527 --> 01:09:02,362
who was a friend of Leone and this was
his big breakthrough as a designer.

892
01:09:02,487 --> 01:09:06,480
He's gone on to design
some very distinguished productions.

893
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,962
The March of the Beggars again

894
01:09:27,087 --> 01:09:31,797
played on a flageolet
bassoon and military drums

895
01:09:31,927 --> 01:09:37,081
as Juan and extended family
go into the bank in Mesa Verde

896
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:41,246
to make their dream come true
or so they think.

897
01:09:41,367 --> 01:09:44,996
With these belching noises.
These are the hungry peasants.

898
01:09:45,127 --> 01:09:47,960
There's a wonderful moment in this music

899
01:09:48,087 --> 01:09:53,036
where these vulgar sounds
of stomachs rumbling and belching

900
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:56,796
are juxtaposed with Mozart
from Eine Kleine Nachtmusik

901
01:09:56,927 --> 01:10:02,445
to mock classical music
in the way that Juan Miranda might.

902
01:10:02,567 --> 01:10:06,116
It's a wonderful wordless sequence
as the march builds up

903
01:10:06,247 --> 01:10:11,002
and Juan raids the bank
and slowly realises what's going on.

904
01:10:38,527 --> 01:10:42,645
The sequence was based on a sequence
in Charlie Chaplin 's Modern Times

905
01:10:42,767 --> 01:10:44,997
Chaplin being a great hero for Leone

906
01:10:45,127 --> 01:10:50,076
where Chaplin pick s up a red flag
without realising what it is.

907
01:10:50,207 --> 01:10:55,281
He starts walking and an entire workers'
demonstration has formed behind him.

908
01:10:55,407 --> 01:11:00,879
That's exactly what's happening here.
Juan has broken into a political prison.

909
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:05,239
The vaults of the bank
have been turned into cells.

910
01:11:05,367 --> 01:11:07,483
Slowly he begins to realise it.

911
01:11:07,607 --> 01:11:11,395
A wonderful fusion
of Morricone's music and the image.

912
01:11:34,487 --> 01:11:38,366
Where's the money?
This isn 't what he imagined at all.

913
01:11:38,487 --> 01:11:40,478
Mozart.

914
01:11:44,607 --> 01:11:46,962
Stomach noises meet Mozart.

915
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:52,036
An extraordinary version of the carnival
approach to culture Leone so often used

916
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:55,955
at the expense of classical music
rather than the classic Western.

917
01:11:56,087 --> 01:12:00,080
This is a carnivalesque scene
as the carnival has its revenge.

918
01:12:02,007 --> 01:12:07,161
Wonderful range of expressions
on Steiger's face as he realises what's going on.

919
01:12:07,887 --> 01:12:10,879
His dream of a lifetime
is being shattered.

920
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:33,358
Organ added to the
March Of The Beggars to give it body

921
01:12:33,487 --> 01:12:36,240
with the military drum.

922
01:12:37,287 --> 01:12:42,042
He's now in the vaults of this cathedral
as he saw it of Mesa Verde.

923
01:12:42,167 --> 01:12:45,284
What does he find in the cathedral?
Not the Holy Grail.

924
01:12:45,407 --> 01:12:48,285
He's become a revolutionary
without realising it

925
01:12:48,407 --> 01:12:53,720
just as Chaplin did when he picked up
the red flag in Modern Times

926
01:13:13,287 --> 01:13:17,121
Is this going to be the vault
with the gold in at last?

927
01:13:17,247 --> 01:13:22,037
There's 150 political prisoners now
standing there in the corridor

928
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:24,556
just waiting to get out.

929
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:30,763
Instead it leads out into the street

930
01:13:30,887 --> 01:13:33,879
and he finds himself
in the middle of Mesa Verde again

931
01:13:34,007 --> 01:13:36,680
being treated as
a huge revolutionary hero

932
01:13:36,807 --> 01:13:39,958
for having taken the prisoners
out of their prison.

933
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:44,478
It is the most cynical thought
that this great hero of the revolution

934
01:13:44,607 --> 01:13:48,998
did it by mistake and really
doesn 't want anything to do with it.

935
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:14,679
If the music is an integral part
of that sequence so is the editing.

936
01:14:14,807 --> 01:14:20,086
Nino Baragli the editor who'd gone
back to the Dollars films with Leone

937
01:14:20,207 --> 01:14:25,327
and Leone would sit in those days
in a Moviola suite agonising for days and days.

938
01:14:25,447 --> 01:14:27,836
The editing of this film took a long time.

939
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:31,323
Leone referred to it subsequently
as a very difficult edit.

940
01:14:31,447 --> 01:14:35,645
They'd sit there counterpointing
the music and the image

941
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:37,564
the dialogue and the image.

942
01:14:37,687 --> 01:14:41,282
The cutting of the celluloid
was incredibly important to Leone.

943
01:14:41,407 --> 01:14:44,080
A technical breakthrough
made his job easier.

944
01:14:44,207 --> 01:14:49,600
He could look at the rushes
of what he'd just shot on video

945
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:53,561
which he'd never been able to do before 19T'1

946
01:14:54,807 --> 01:14:57,765
so he could assemble the shots in his
mind at the time he was shooting them.

947
01:14:57,887 --> 01:15:01,562
Before he had to wait until
they came back from the laboratories.

948
01:15:01,687 --> 01:15:04,599
But the editing and the sound editing
is incredible.

949
01:15:04,727 --> 01:15:09,039
People always reminisced about Baragli
Morricone and Leone

950
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:14,366
sitting in the editing suite putting
layer upon layer of sound onto this.

951
01:15:14,487 --> 01:15:17,797
Movies in Italy were like a blank canvas.

952
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:20,122
Most of it was post-synchronised.

953
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:25,037
So you could put all sorts of sounds on
afterwards and create another reality.

954
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:28,637
Natural sounds musical sounds
amplified sounds.

955
01:15:28,767 --> 01:15:32,999
The laying of the different levels of
sound was very important to Leone.

956
01:15:33,127 --> 01:15:36,005
Now we cut to another reference
to the modern world.

957
01:15:36,127 --> 01:15:40,962
A strange German armoured car
in the Mexican desert.

958
01:15:41,087 --> 01:15:45,956
At the helm of the armoured car
a general Günther Ruiz

959
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:48,555
who look s just like
a Nazi tank commander

960
01:15:48,687 --> 01:15:53,807
a panzer division in 1913
in the Mexican Revolution.

961
01:15:53,927 --> 01:15:57,715
There's usually
a historical justification of sorts.

962
01:15:57,847 --> 01:16:01,044
This was the most advanced
armoured car around in 1913

963
01:16:01,167 --> 01:16:03,840
and Leone was keen to make reference to it.

964
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:08,085
Also the horses are wearing goggles
because of the dust in the desert.

965
01:16:08,207 --> 01:16:12,837
You don 't often see horses
wearing goggles in any movies.

966
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:15,845
This was a tiny detail
that fascinated Leone.

967
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:19,277
He'd look at archive photos
read book s about the period

968
01:16:19,407 --> 01:16:23,195
and steep himself in these tiny odd details.

969
01:16:23,327 --> 01:16:28,242
Later some of the troops in Mesa Verde
will wear colonial pith helmets

970
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:31,882
which we normally associate
with the Indian subcontinent.

971
01:16:32,007 --> 01:16:34,999
But he discovered
people wore pith helmets in Mexico

972
01:16:35,127 --> 01:16:38,278
during the Mexican Revolution
of 1910 to the early '20s

973
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:42,525
and so they find a place in this movie as well.

974
01:16:42,647 --> 01:16:46,003
This sequence
the most serious dialogue in the film

975
01:16:46,127 --> 01:16:48,800
was written very late in the day by Leone

976
01:16:48,927 --> 01:16:52,920
and added to the script of Sergio Donati
and Luciano Vincenzoni.

977
01:16:53,047 --> 01:16:57,996
A debate about revolution between
the man who reads the book s Sean

978
01:16:58,127 --> 01:17:02,996
and the man who can 't read Juan about
exactly what happens in a revolution.

979
01:17:03,127 --> 01:17:07,518
Of course to people in the early 'T'Os

980
01:17:07,647 --> 01:17:12,163
when a lot of book s were coming out
people were talking about revolution

981
01:17:12,287 --> 01:17:15,484
this debate was very timely.

982
01:17:15,607 --> 01:17:17,962
Juan does not like revolution.

983
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,956
This is the key moment in the film

984
01:17:50,087 --> 01:17:53,204
where Juan has let rip
about his attitude to revolution.

985
01:17:53,327 --> 01:17:58,082
Intellectuals run them the peasants die
and the intellectuals stay in control.

986
01:17:58,207 --> 01:18:03,201
Sean starts thinking maybe he's got a point.

987
01:18:03,327 --> 01:18:07,798
Sean a disillusioned revolutionary
on the run from the Irish Revolution

988
01:18:07,927 --> 01:18:09,918
is not entirely convinced himself.

989
01:18:10,047 --> 01:18:16,156
He's reading but he's about to throw
his book in disgust into the mud.

990
01:18:16,287 --> 01:18:19,916
It's a book by the Russian
anarchist author Mikhael Bakunin.

991
01:18:20,047 --> 01:18:24,006
An unusually bad translation.
It says The Patriotism

992
01:18:24,127 --> 01:18:26,880
It should be
On Patriotism or Patriotism

993
01:18:27,007 --> 01:18:30,283
Sean has thrown
the anarchist's book into the mud.

994
01:18:30,407 --> 01:18:33,126
It's picked up subsequently by a soldier

995
01:18:33,247 --> 01:18:35,636
who takes it to the captain...

996
01:18:44,767 --> 01:18:49,124
...who takes it to the colonel
in his armoured car.

997
01:18:49,247 --> 01:18:52,000
A wonderful visual link
with that conversation

998
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:55,199
about people who read the book s
versus those who don 't.

999
01:18:57,647 --> 01:18:59,877
The colonel is reading the book.
It's a clue there's a revolutionary nearby.

1000
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:05,001
It's like in The Good The Bad And The Ugly
where Tuco finds a cigar stub

1001
01:19:05,127 --> 01:19:07,766
and realises Clint Eastwood has been there.

1002
01:19:07,887 --> 01:19:10,640
The stub is still alight so he's getting close.

1003
01:19:10,767 --> 01:19:13,520
The Bakunin book in the mud shows the colonel

1004
01:19:13,647 --> 01:19:18,880
he's on the scent of this revolutionary
who's giving him trouble.

1005
01:19:40,967 --> 01:19:46,280
This bridge set in a valley built of stone
designed by Andrea Crisanti

1006
01:19:46,447 --> 01:19:51,202
was in fact about five kilometres away
from the standing set for El Paso

1007
01:19:51,327 --> 01:19:55,115
designed by Carlo Simi for
For A Few Dollars More in the hills.

1008
01:19:55,247 --> 01:20:00,037
Five kilometres winding track up
into the hills of Almería.

1009
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:03,955
It's still there what's left of it
as are the two gun emplacements

1010
01:20:04,087 --> 01:20:08,524
occupied by Coburn and Steiger
as they set up their machine guns.

1011
01:20:08,647 --> 01:20:12,356
No one's troubled to erase them since.

1012
01:20:12,487 --> 01:20:17,003
Leone said "There tend to be
big explosions in my films."

1013
01:20:17,207 --> 01:20:21,359
There was a big explosion when the bank
is blown up in For A Few Dollars More

1014
01:20:21,487 --> 01:20:25,002
A huge explosion when
the battle of the bridge took place

1015
01:20:25,127 --> 01:20:28,164
in Good The Bad And The Ugly

1016
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:32,644
Here's an explosion to end them all
but unlike in the other films

1017
01:20:32,767 --> 01:20:36,442
the music which accompanies it
is played against the image.

1018
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:40,606
This isn 't exciting action music
to get the audience all whipped up

1019
01:20:40,727 --> 01:20:43,446
to give a sense of scale to the explosion.

1020
01:20:43,567 --> 01:20:46,764
This is romantic lyrical music
that's going to come in

1021
01:20:46,887 --> 01:20:51,677
because the explosion reminds Sean
of when he still believed in revolution.

1022
01:20:51,807 --> 01:20:54,162
An interesting use of music with action

1023
01:20:54,287 --> 01:20:57,723
not to punctuate it
not to reinforce it not to emphasise it

1024
01:20:57,847 --> 01:21:01,999
but to play against it
and that'll be part of this sequence.

1025
01:21:02,127 --> 01:21:05,358
There's a cluster of references in this idea

1026
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:11,164
of a soldier of fortune from overseas
coming to fight in a revolution.

1027
01:21:11,287 --> 01:21:16,202
It relates to the work of Joseph Conrad
an explicit source for the screenplay

1028
01:21:21,327 --> 01:21:25,366
set in the Spanish Civil War where
Gary Cooper as a soldier of fortune

1029
01:21:25,487 --> 01:21:27,682
finds himself in the Spanish Civil War.

1030
01:21:27,807 --> 01:21:33,882
It's not just movies about the Mexican
Revolution he's touching base with

1031
01:21:34,007 --> 01:21:39,001
it's also movies about the Spanish Civil War
and versions of Joseph Conrad.

1032
01:22:19,087 --> 01:22:22,682
Why is Juan staying
when the odds look so bad?

1033
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:26,163
An entire division of troops
is coming across the bridge

1034
01:22:26,287 --> 01:22:30,200
and there's just the two of them
at these gun emplacements.

1035
01:22:30,327 --> 01:22:34,923
He seems to have been machoed into it
by the James Coburn character.

1036
01:22:35,047 --> 01:22:39,996
He feels he won 't be treated as a man
unless he takes part in this action.

1037
01:22:40,127 --> 01:22:42,118
So it isn 't yet a revolutionary act.

1038
01:22:42,247 --> 01:22:45,444
He's not staying because
ideologically he wants to fight

1039
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:48,525
the Nazi tank commander
the troops of Huerta.

1040
01:22:48,647 --> 01:22:52,959
He doesn 't want to do that.
It's personal between him and Sean.

1041
01:22:53,087 --> 01:22:55,476
He's been machoed into doing it.

1042
01:22:57,647 --> 01:23:01,640
A lot of the references to America
in the script were added at a late stage

1043
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:05,521
when Leone took over
the direction of the film

1044
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:08,559
and explicitly wanted to sew into it

1045
01:23:08,687 --> 01:23:11,076
a trailer for Once Upon A Time In America

1046
01:23:11,207 --> 01:23:14,358
Already Leone was working
on his great gangster epic

1047
01:23:14,487 --> 01:23:18,162
which he first read as a book in 196T'.

1048
01:23:18,287 --> 01:23:20,482
The project was gestating in his mind.

1049
01:23:20,607 --> 01:23:24,998
He sewed into this film various
references to going to America.

1050
01:23:25,127 --> 01:23:28,403
The people involved in the teams
in the Mexican Revolution

1051
01:23:28,527 --> 01:23:33,157
could have got involved in city America
in the 1920s as gangsters.

1052
01:23:33,287 --> 01:23:36,006
It's like a missing piece
between the Wild West

1053
01:23:36,127 --> 01:23:38,197
and Once Upon A Time In America

1054
01:23:38,327 --> 01:23:42,798
a film he wouldn 't in fact make
until the early to mid 1980s.

1055
01:23:47,327 --> 01:23:51,684
Here's the macho bit. Juan is saying
"Are you calling me not a man?"

1056
01:23:51,807 --> 01:23:56,358
Without saying anything Sean simply
look s at him with withering glances

1057
01:23:56,487 --> 01:24:01,481
Juan persuades himself to stay on
this suicidal self-destructive mission

1058
01:24:01,607 --> 01:24:04,121
against the forces of Huerta.

1059
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:07,159
Sean is constantly dicing with death

1060
01:24:07,287 --> 01:24:12,520
and enjoying himself far too much
when it comes to these scenes.

1061
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:15,878
He really doesn 't see
much point in living.

1062
01:24:16,007 --> 01:24:18,202
As he says later
"At one point I believed in revolution."

1063
01:24:19,607 --> 01:24:22,201
"Now all I believe in is dynamite."

1064
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:38,118
Another conversation with God
like Don Camillo

1065
01:24:38,247 --> 01:24:42,684
the village priest who chats with God
in the book s by Guareschi

1066
01:24:42,807 --> 01:24:46,959
which were written in the 1950s
and have been huge bestsellers in Italy.

1067
01:24:47,087 --> 01:24:51,922
This country priest who chats to God and
crosses the path of the communist mayor

1068
01:24:52,047 --> 01:24:56,643
in the same way that Juan crosses
the path of the Irish ideologue Sean.

1069
01:25:09,807 --> 01:25:13,083
Leone reminisced that
when he worked with Clint Eastwood

1070
01:25:13,207 --> 01:25:19,555
Eastwood would go to sleep on the set
or put his hat over his eyes and snooze.

1071
01:25:19,687 --> 01:25:23,282
When the moment came to appear
on the set he'd dust himself down

1072
01:25:23,407 --> 01:25:26,956
get up and give a wonderful performance
as The Man With No Name.

1073
01:25:27,087 --> 01:25:31,046
That's what Coburn 's doing.
He seems to be having a snooze

1074
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:34,398
waiting for the big action
the dynamite the explosion

1075
01:25:34,527 --> 01:25:39,123
the blowing up of the bridge
and the machine-gunning of the troops.

1076
01:25:47,687 --> 01:25:52,715
The distant sound of engines
ricocheting round the valley.

1077
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:55,202
This piece of music by Morricone

1078
01:25:55,327 --> 01:25:58,683
which is a very advanced
almost atonal piece of music

1079
01:25:58,807 --> 01:26:04,279
relates to musical researches Morricone
had been doing since the 1950s.

1080
01:26:04,407 --> 01:26:08,639
He was involved in a group called
the Nuovo Consonanza

1081
01:26:08,767 --> 01:26:12,555
which started life in a series
of seminars in the late 1950s

1082
01:26:12,687 --> 01:26:15,042
by the American composer John Cage.

1083
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:18,637
The idea of these seminars
was that all sound is music

1084
01:26:18,767 --> 01:26:22,123
that it depends on the context
that it's being played in.

1085
01:26:22,247 --> 01:26:26,638
So famously John Cage played
a silent piece of piano music

1086
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:28,758
on the stage of a concert hall.

1087
01:26:28,887 --> 01:26:32,926
The music became the coughing
the rustling the shuffling of feet

1088
01:26:33,047 --> 01:26:35,607
and the eating of sweets in the audience.

1089
01:26:35,727 --> 01:26:41,165
All sound is music in the context of the
concert hall like a similar attitude to visual art.

1090
01:26:41,287 --> 01:26:45,758
You could put an object in a gallery
and the gallery turns it into art.

1091
01:26:45,887 --> 01:26:49,880
A lot of these experiments with music
found their way in a diluted form

1092
01:26:50,007 --> 01:26:52,202
into the soundtrack s for the Westerns.

1093
01:26:52,327 --> 01:26:56,878
The idea of using concrete sounds
whip crack s and bells and shouting

1094
01:26:57,007 --> 01:27:01,683
and incomprehensible lyrics in the main
title themes of the Dollars films.

1095
01:27:01,807 --> 01:27:06,927
We have this thunderous metallic music
as the armoured car crosses the bridge

1096
01:27:07,047 --> 01:27:09,322
which is like music by Nuovo Consonanza

1097
01:27:09,447 --> 01:27:14,840
using instruments in a strange way
and using sound as if it was music.

1098
01:27:14,967 --> 01:27:19,643
Morricone explicitly related the
soundtrack of this film and that theme

1099
01:27:19,767 --> 01:27:23,157
to his experiments
with the Nuovo Consonanza.

1100
01:28:00,127 --> 01:28:02,800
Juan 's not used to
this newfangled technology.

1101
01:28:02,927 --> 01:28:05,600
He prefers a traditional pistol.

1102
01:28:09,287 --> 01:28:12,085
It's all like all those scenes
in Peckinpah movies

1103
01:28:12,207 --> 01:28:15,756
where the Mexican generalissimo
is given a machine gun

1104
01:28:22,407 --> 01:28:28,084
The Steiger character doesn 't quite know
what this new machine gun is for either.

1105
01:28:28,207 --> 01:28:31,722
The machine guns
are there to pin down the troops

1106
01:28:31,847 --> 01:28:37,046
to keep them there so they'll be
in situ when the bridge blows up.

1107
01:28:37,167 --> 01:28:42,446
This relates to a whole tradition of
bridge blowing up sequences in movies.

1108
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:46,719
The Bridge On The River Kwai
The Pride And The Passion

1109
01:28:46,847 --> 01:28:50,157
The Good The Bad And The Ugly
The Wild Bunch most recently

1110
01:28:50,287 --> 01:28:53,757
with the bounty hunters chasing the bunch

1111
01:28:53,887 --> 01:28:56,526
falling into the river as they go into Mexico.

1112
01:28:56,647 --> 01:28:58,797
There's a whole cinematic tradition.

1113
01:28:58,927 --> 01:29:01,999
But what's about to happen
is playing against type

1114
01:29:02,127 --> 01:29:05,278
because of the kind of music
that will accompany it

1115
01:29:05,407 --> 01:29:08,558
and the size of the explosion
like a nuclear explosion

1116
01:29:08,687 --> 01:29:12,077
with the amount of dust
and smoke that it brings.

1117
01:29:14,487 --> 01:29:17,718
Strange combination
of costumes and design here.

1118
01:29:17,847 --> 01:29:21,362
The heroes not in cowboy hats
but in 20th-century hats

1119
01:29:21,487 --> 01:29:24,797
troops in pith helmets
associated with empire movies

1120
01:29:24,927 --> 01:29:27,316
a Nazi tank commander in his armoured car

1121
01:29:27,447 --> 01:29:30,086
all in the wilderness of Mexico.

1122
01:29:30,207 --> 01:29:33,643
There's a lot of strangeness
about the visual language.

1123
01:29:33,767 --> 01:29:37,680
Andrea Crisanti the designer
related a lot of this strangeness

1124
01:29:37,807 --> 01:29:41,482
to the work of the Italian
surrealist painter Giorgio de Chirico

1125
01:29:41,607 --> 01:29:43,404
a favourite of Sergio Leone.

1126
01:29:43,527 --> 01:29:46,599
Leone owned two paintings by de Chirico.

1127
01:29:46,727 --> 01:29:52,165
De Chirico during the First World War
specialised in paintings of arcades

1128
01:29:52,287 --> 01:29:54,676
going back in very sharp perspective

1129
01:29:54,807 --> 01:29:58,322
painted under the midday sun with big shadows

1130
01:29:58,447 --> 01:30:01,757
and figures in front of them
out of scale with the arcades.

1131
01:30:01,887 --> 01:30:07,598
This bridge with the hole in the middle of it
is very like a painting by de Chirico.

1132
01:30:07,727 --> 01:30:12,403
So it's like surrealism rides the range.
Giorgio de Chirico out West.

1133
01:30:12,527 --> 01:30:16,202
And here comes
the mother and father of explosions.

1134
01:30:17,247 --> 01:30:22,196
Bigger than in The Good The Bad And
The Ugly almost like a mushroom cloud.

1135
01:30:22,327 --> 01:30:25,125
This romantic music played against it.

1136
01:30:25,247 --> 01:30:29,206
We're supposed to be getting
drum beats whipping the audience up

1137
01:30:29,327 --> 01:30:34,606
but what we get is a reminiscence
of Ireland the Sean theme - Sean Sean.

1138
01:30:43,407 --> 01:30:47,559
Famously in The Good The Bad
And The Ugly the bridge blew up early

1139
01:30:47,687 --> 01:30:51,396
in a variation on the
"Ready when you are" Cecil B DeMille gag

1140
01:30:51,527 --> 01:30:55,440
where someone blew up the bridge
because they misunderstood an order.

1141
01:30:55,567 --> 01:30:59,037
It blew up before they were ready.
This time they got it in one.

1142
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:02,159
It must have taken days
for the dust to settle.

1143
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:16,757
Günther Ruiz or Guttierez as he's
called in some versions of the credits

1144
01:31:16,887 --> 01:31:19,560
was played by Domingo Antoine

1145
01:31:19,687 --> 01:31:25,205
who also appears as Antonio Domingo
on some versions of the cast list.

1146
01:31:25,327 --> 01:31:30,640
So they can 't make up their mind about
his name as a character or as an actor.

1147
01:31:31,327 --> 01:31:36,640
But he was chosen for his resemblance
to the ultimate panzer commander.

1148
01:31:36,767 --> 01:31:40,555
Here we are at the grotto of San Isidro

1149
01:31:40,687 --> 01:31:43,565
where they've agreed
to recce after the explosion.

1150
01:31:43,687 --> 01:31:46,565
This is where the references
to the great massacre

1151
01:31:46,687 --> 01:31:50,521
at the end of the Via Ardeatine
which happened in 1944

1152
01:31:50,647 --> 01:31:53,036
begin to happen.

1153
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:59,397
In the original international print
you saw Steiger's face

1154
01:31:59,527 --> 01:32:03,315
and you cut in faces
of lots of corpses around him

1155
01:32:03,447 --> 01:32:05,802
including corpses of all his children.

1156
01:32:05,927 --> 01:32:08,646
It's much more effective in the restored print

1157
01:32:08,767 --> 01:32:14,080
where all you see is Steiger's facial reaction
and we don 't know what he's seeing yet.

1158
01:32:14,207 --> 01:32:17,643
We'll only see it through Sean 's eyes
later in the sequence.

1159
01:32:17,767 --> 01:32:19,758
Sheer resignation.

1160
01:32:21,567 --> 01:32:26,118
His entire family has been massacred
as a reprisal for the explosion.

1161
01:32:26,247 --> 01:32:29,796
Whereas the explosion is jokey
in The Good The Bad And The Ugly

1162
01:32:29,927 --> 01:32:36,275
and the explosions in the Dollars films
are an excuse for a gag this is very serious.

1163
01:32:36,407 --> 01:32:39,126
Yet another action
has had consequences.

1164
01:32:39,247 --> 01:32:43,240
The troops get their own back by
massacring the contents of the grotto

1165
01:32:43,367 --> 01:32:48,122
just like the Gestapo in the Via Tasso
in the Second World War.

1166
01:32:48,247 --> 01:32:53,640
There was a man who served
in the Italian resistance called Cervi

1167
01:32:53,767 --> 01:32:56,998
who lost seven sons killed by the Nazis.

1168
01:32:57,127 --> 01:33:01,325
He was something of a mythological
figure in the Second World War in Italy.

1169
01:33:01,447 --> 01:33:06,521
In the declining days of Nazism as they
were retreating he lost his seven sons.

1170
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:08,717
That's what's happening to Juan.

1171
01:33:08,847 --> 01:33:12,442
Another reference
to the Second World War in Italy.

1172
01:33:13,927 --> 01:33:18,284
Which in the early 'T'Os
was still well in living memory

1173
01:33:18,407 --> 01:33:23,401
and part of the folk culture
of the Italian audience going to the cinema.

1174
01:34:13,327 --> 01:34:16,558
And so Juan takes off his crucifix
look s up to God

1175
01:34:16,687 --> 01:34:20,805
with whom he's been having
conversations throughout the film

1176
01:34:20,927 --> 01:34:23,316
puts his hand round his neck

1177
01:34:23,447 --> 01:34:25,836
and removes his crucifix.

1178
01:34:30,447 --> 01:34:33,439
This is the absolute
moment of truth for him.

1179
01:34:51,887 --> 01:34:57,041
This is no longer a game between him
and Sean as to who can be more macho.

1180
01:34:58,047 --> 01:35:01,676
And Sean realises that
by drawing Juan into the revolution

1181
01:35:01,807 --> 01:35:05,004
he's been the cause of such terrible grief.

1182
01:35:05,127 --> 01:35:07,038
So he too has a conscience.

1183
01:35:07,167 --> 01:35:12,036
It was all a game in Mesa Verde
to get Juan to break into the bank

1184
01:35:12,167 --> 01:35:15,876
to spring the political prisoners
but this isn 't a game any more.

1185
01:35:16,007 --> 01:35:19,044
The reprisals have started happening.

1186
01:35:22,407 --> 01:35:25,558
But we haven 't seen what it is he's looking at.

1187
01:35:26,647 --> 01:35:29,241
We have to imagine it at this stage.

1188
01:35:40,367 --> 01:35:43,837
The way in which
the massacre is revealed to us

1189
01:35:43,967 --> 01:35:48,438
is a world away from
the Italian Westerns of 1965-9

1190
01:35:48,567 --> 01:35:51,957
against which Gíú La Testa was reacting.

1191
01:35:52,087 --> 01:35:56,365
In those films you tended to have
a Mexican peon Tomas Milian.

1192
01:36:00,807 --> 01:36:03,367
or Professional Gun by Sergio Corbucci

1193
01:36:03,487 --> 01:36:07,366
or Compañeros by Corbucci
or A Bullet For The General by Damiani

1194
01:36:07,487 --> 01:36:09,637
the peon figure would be a bandit

1195
01:36:09,767 --> 01:36:13,476
who goes through a simple epiphany
and becomes a revolutionary

1196
01:36:13,607 --> 01:36:17,680
so at the end he represents
the wretched the dispossessed peasants.

1197
01:36:17,807 --> 01:36:20,002
It's a very simple equation.

1198
01:36:20,127 --> 01:36:25,201
But in this one the subtlety
the modulated journey that Steiger goes on

1199
01:36:25,327 --> 01:36:31,402
in converting him to the revolutionary
cause or stoking up his cynicism

1200
01:36:31,527 --> 01:36:33,563
is a very complex journey

1201
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:39,796
and is really in a completely different universe
to the Italians Westerns of the late '60s.

1202
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:43,283
This is Leone's most mature film
so far in every way.

1203
01:36:43,407 --> 01:36:47,002
The critics picked up on this
when they wrote about it.

1204
01:36:47,127 --> 01:36:49,766
With this movie Leone lost his innocence.

1205
01:36:49,887 --> 01:36:54,165
The Left didn 't like it.
Some people liked it a lot.

1206
01:36:54,287 --> 01:36:59,680
It didn 't go down well in France because
it was rude about the generation of '68

1207
01:36:59,807 --> 01:37:01,957
the children of Marx and Coca-Cola

1208
01:37:02,087 --> 01:37:05,523
who had put up the barricades
in Paris in May 1968.

1209
01:37:05,647 --> 01:37:07,444
They didn 't like that.

1210
01:37:07,567 --> 01:37:13,164
But now we can see what it was
that upset Juan so much.

1211
01:37:13,287 --> 01:37:17,997
Amongst all these people are
his six children all from different mothers.

1212
01:37:18,127 --> 01:37:20,516
I never counted them before.

1213
01:37:25,007 --> 01:37:29,000
The sound of machine gun and gunfire
on the soundtrack not justified.

1214
01:37:29,127 --> 01:37:34,121
We don 't know what's going on outside.
It's a kind of musical use of gunfire...

1215
01:37:35,447 --> 01:37:38,484
...to accompany
the wandering camera in the grotto.

1216
01:37:45,807 --> 01:37:49,516
Leone at this time
where most Italian critics were concerned

1217
01:37:49,647 --> 01:37:54,243
with a few exceptions was treated
as a prophet without honour in his country.

1218
01:37:54,367 --> 01:38:00,158
Visconti Bertolucci Pasolini
Francesco Rosi Rossellini

1219
01:38:00,287 --> 01:38:03,563
they were the greats
the maestri of Italian cinema.

1220
01:38:03,687 --> 01:38:06,076
Leone was of a different order.

1221
01:38:06,207 --> 01:38:09,961
He'd been brought up in Rome.
His father was Neapolitan.

1222
01:38:10,087 --> 01:38:12,885
He belonged to southern Italian
popular culture.

1223
01:38:13,007 --> 01:38:17,205
He wasn 't the kind of filmmaker that
showed their movies at film festivals

1224
01:38:17,327 --> 01:38:19,397
in the north and in Europe

1225
01:38:19,527 --> 01:38:24,840
the kind that got all the prizes
in Berlin Venice London and Cannes.

1226
01:38:24,967 --> 01:38:26,958
He wasn 't that sort of character.

1227
01:38:27,087 --> 01:38:30,045
So he was rather patronised
by most Italian critics.

1228
01:38:30,167 --> 01:38:34,001
They couldn 't forgive him
for not making movies about Italy.

1229
01:38:34,127 --> 01:38:39,679
All his movies are set in the past in a
different era and they're movies about movies.

1230
01:38:39,807 --> 01:38:43,083
They're movies made by a cineaste
which crossed the line.

1231
01:38:43,207 --> 01:38:47,803
They're art films for a popular audience.
That confused everybody.

1232
01:38:47,927 --> 01:38:50,077
There's an art-film element

1233
01:38:50,207 --> 01:38:54,758
but Leone had his finger on the pulse
so they're extremely popular films.

1234
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:59,483
Critics couldn 't understand this person
who straddled both those worlds

1235
01:38:59,607 --> 01:39:04,158
who had references to Italian paintings
and avant-garde Italian music

1236
01:39:04,287 --> 01:39:07,245
and all sorts of cultural references
in his movies

1237
01:39:07,367 --> 01:39:11,963
but at the same time made rip-roaring
action movies that everyone could enjoy.

1238
01:39:12,087 --> 01:39:14,317
So his reputation in the early 'T'Os...

1239
01:39:14,447 --> 01:39:18,235
I started writing about Leone in 1968.

1240
01:39:18,367 --> 01:39:23,487
Most people thought I was mad
making any claims for his significance.

1241
01:39:23,607 --> 01:39:27,680
All my friends went to see the movies
and said "We don 't get it."

1242
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:32,160
"The design 's interesting
but these are just rot-gut Westerns."

1243
01:39:32,287 --> 01:39:35,916
It's taken 2030 years
for Leone to establish his reputation.

1244
01:39:36,047 --> 01:39:40,040
He's now treated by everyone
as one of the great Italian filmmakers.

1245
01:39:40,167 --> 01:39:44,319
There are retrospectives exhibitions
and book s about him.

1246
01:39:44,447 --> 01:39:47,086
It's a huge change in his critical reputation.

1247
01:39:47,207 --> 01:39:50,438
He's now amongst the maestrí,
but it took a long time.

1248
01:39:50,567 --> 01:39:54,480
When I was trying to get a festival
of Leone films in the '60s

1249
01:39:54,607 --> 01:39:57,440
the Italian embassy in London
sent this curt letter

1250
01:39:57,567 --> 01:40:02,163
saying they didn 't consider Leone was
a good advertisement for their culture.

1251
01:40:02,287 --> 01:40:08,362
If I wanted to do a season of Bertolucci or
Pasolini or Visconti fine but not Sergio Leone.

1252
01:40:08,487 --> 01:40:12,036
He was a Western filmmaker
and that wasn 't respectable.

1253
01:40:12,167 --> 01:40:16,285
But that's all changed
and now he's very respectable indeed.

1254
01:40:16,407 --> 01:40:18,796
This firing squad sequence in the rain

1255
01:40:18,927 --> 01:40:22,715
it's quite clear that Dr Villega
has been tortured

1256
01:40:22,847 --> 01:40:26,920
and that under torture he's broken
and he's started naming names.

1257
01:40:29,167 --> 01:40:32,716
There's a kind of treachery treason
that's going on here.

1258
01:40:32,847 --> 01:40:36,237
The whole of this sequence
was based on another painting

1259
01:40:36,367 --> 01:40:41,395
one of Leone's favourite paintings
that was housed in the Prado in Madrid

1260
01:40:41,527 --> 01:40:46,282
which he used to go and see in between
shooting the Dollars films in Spain.

1261
01:40:46,407 --> 01:40:48,762
It's by Goya the Spanish artist.

1262
01:40:48,887 --> 01:40:51,037
It's called the 3rd of May in Madrid.

1263
01:40:51,167 --> 01:40:57,845
It was painted in 1814 and it depicts
the soldiers of Napoleon 's army

1264
01:40:57,967 --> 01:41:03,041
with the firing squad shooting
at a Spanish patriot in a white shirt.

1265
01:41:03,167 --> 01:41:07,319
Leone referred to it
as a CinemaScope shoot-out.

1266
01:41:07,447 --> 01:41:09,722
It was even backlit he said.

1267
01:41:09,847 --> 01:41:12,884
It was as if a movie art director
had set up a sequence

1268
01:41:13,007 --> 01:41:15,726
set in the Peninsular War in 1814.

1269
01:41:15,847 --> 01:41:21,319
Giuseppe Ruzzolini and others were
shown a reproduction of Goya's painting

1270
01:41:21,447 --> 01:41:25,235
before shooting this sequence
which is directly derived from it.

1271
01:41:25,367 --> 01:41:28,677
The rain is not just the weather it's tears.

1272
01:41:28,807 --> 01:41:32,720
There was a sequence shot
of Villega being tortured

1273
01:41:32,847 --> 01:41:36,442
in the form of shadows on the wall
as he was strapped to a chair

1274
01:41:36,567 --> 01:41:40,719
like the torture sequence of Tuco
in The Good The Bad And The Ugly

1275
01:41:40,847 --> 01:41:42,838
only this time it's for real.

1276
01:41:42,967 --> 01:41:48,837
But they cut it and made a cut to this sequence
assuming we understand what's going on.

1277
01:41:48,967 --> 01:41:51,162
Leone doesn 't like being literal.

1278
01:41:51,287 --> 01:41:56,407
He likes the audience to work out
what's going on and here is an example.

1279
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:59,803
So Coburn stands in the rain
looking at the firing squad

1280
01:42:04,647 --> 01:42:07,445
looking at the corpses of his fellow gangsters

1281
01:42:07,567 --> 01:42:11,446
lying in the street in New York
in a very similar sequence.

1282
01:42:11,567 --> 01:42:16,357
In this case lit by the headlights
of the armoured vehicles.

1283
01:42:18,207 --> 01:42:20,960
Villega's betrayal here has consequences.

1284
01:42:21,687 --> 01:42:25,885
Things that have been treated in
a jokey fashion in the earlier Westerns

1285
01:42:28,127 --> 01:42:32,757
The idea of betrayal in history
and Italian cinema went very deep.

1286
01:42:32,887 --> 01:42:35,196
Obviously the roots of 1943-4.

1287
01:42:35,327 --> 01:42:38,558
Who collaborated with the Nazis? Who didn 't?

1288
01:42:38,687 --> 01:42:40,962
Who turned in their friends? Who didn 't?

1289
01:42:41,087 --> 01:42:44,159
A famous sequence of Rossellini's film
Rome Open City

1290
01:42:44,287 --> 01:42:47,802
showed a man being tortured
by the Gestapo in the Via Tasso

1291
01:42:47,927 --> 01:42:52,239
and not breaking under that sort of interrogation.

1292
01:42:52,367 --> 01:42:57,395
Now we're back in Dublin in Toner's pub
as the British soldiers bring in

1293
01:42:57,527 --> 01:43:00,837
another man who's been tortured
and who is betrayed:

1294
01:43:00,967 --> 01:43:03,356
Sean 's friend back in Ireland.

1295
01:43:05,807 --> 01:43:09,402
When they were shooting this
Coburn remembers that Leone said

1296
01:43:09,527 --> 01:43:12,485
"The drink s are on the house"
and then regretted it

1297
01:43:12,607 --> 01:43:15,804
as everyone was blind drunk
and falling off their chairs.

1298
01:43:15,927 --> 01:43:20,603
But they're trying to be serious for
this betrayal which Coburn remembers.

1299
01:43:20,727 --> 01:43:24,959
Betrayal in the present with
the Romolo Valli character Dr Villega

1300
01:43:25,087 --> 01:43:28,716
and betrayal in the past in Ireland before he left.

1301
01:43:30,047 --> 01:43:32,038
Is he going to be betrayed?

1302
01:43:53,207 --> 01:43:56,677
singing like another musical instrument.

1303
01:43:56,807 --> 01:44:01,164
No words but just a tune to represent Sean.

1304
01:44:01,287 --> 01:44:03,323
Is he nostalgic or is he bitter?

1305
01:44:03,447 --> 01:44:07,440
He's looking at them in the mirror
to see what'll happen next.

1306
01:44:10,207 --> 01:44:12,004
Is it him?

1307
01:44:21,727 --> 01:44:23,718
And he nods.

1308
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:35,638
But unlike in John Ford's film
The Informer of 1935 Sean isn 't a victim.

1309
01:44:35,767 --> 01:44:39,157
The character played by
Victor McLaglen was a victim

1310
01:44:39,287 --> 01:44:42,404
who achieves a transfiguration
in the last scene

1311
01:44:42,527 --> 01:44:46,156
as he gets forgiven by the mother
of the man he betrayed.

1312
01:44:46,287 --> 01:44:48,926
But Sean isn 't a victim he's an avenger.

1313
01:44:49,047 --> 01:44:52,801
He's got something on his mind
which will work its way through.

1314
01:44:52,927 --> 01:44:55,441
That moment of betrayal
took him to Mexico

1315
01:44:55,567 --> 01:44:58,240
gave him his self-destructive attitude

1316
01:44:58,367 --> 01:45:02,804
this dilettante of revolution
in the Mexican setting

1317
01:45:02,927 --> 01:45:05,236
and everything flowed from that moment.

1318
01:45:05,367 --> 01:45:09,360
It's a take on John Ford's The Informer
rather than a rerun.

1319
01:45:30,807 --> 01:45:33,275
That scene was entirely without dialogue.

1320
01:45:33,407 --> 01:45:37,525
Just music image and lots of rain.

1321
01:45:37,647 --> 01:45:42,084
Leone was getting better at dialogue.
He could speak a bit of English.

1322
01:45:42,207 --> 01:45:45,040
He started off when he made the first
Westerns just being able to say

1323
01:45:46,247 --> 01:45:49,159
"Watch me Clint."
"Watch me Lee." "Watch me Eli."

1324
01:45:49,287 --> 01:45:53,565
By now he had a smattering of English
but he never learnt English properly.

1325
01:45:53,687 --> 01:45:56,599
He loved watching American movies

1326
01:45:56,727 --> 01:46:00,083
which hadn 't been dubbed into Italian
but were subtitled

1327
01:46:00,207 --> 01:46:03,563
the sound of the words
and the catchphrases in English.

1328
01:46:03,687 --> 01:46:09,319
He wanted to remain an Italian
and have an Italian take on these things.

1329
01:46:09,447 --> 01:46:14,282
Everyone noted the fact that he never
really attempted to learn English.

1330
01:46:16,247 --> 01:46:19,603
Here we have another firing squad.

1331
01:46:19,727 --> 01:46:22,287
Juan has virtually given himself up

1332
01:46:22,407 --> 01:46:26,844
after staggering out of the grotto of San Isidro

1333
01:46:26,967 --> 01:46:31,563
and thrown himself into the arms
of Guttierez or Günther Ruiz.

1334
01:46:38,487 --> 01:46:41,001
Looking up. Is God gonna help him?

1335
01:46:41,127 --> 01:46:44,324
Every time he look s up
you know what he means.

1336
01:46:44,447 --> 01:46:49,043
There's no salvation there.
This is the moment. He's going to die.

1337
01:46:52,847 --> 01:46:55,600
He's curling up his fingers
on his hands

1338
01:46:55,727 --> 01:46:58,161
a reference to Leone's hand gesture.

1339
01:46:58,287 --> 01:47:04,362
On the set he would move his fingers
into his fists in a nervous gesture

1340
01:47:04,487 --> 01:47:07,285
and Steiger decided to use
Leone's hand movement.

1341
01:47:07,407 --> 01:47:10,604
He uses it first when the family
arrives in Mesa Verde.

1342
01:47:10,727 --> 01:47:12,843
Now he's using it again.

1343
01:47:12,967 --> 01:47:16,198
It's the nervous tic of Leone
as he was walking round

1344
01:47:16,327 --> 01:47:19,364
making sure that everything
was spick-and-span.

1345
01:47:22,487 --> 01:47:25,365
He hears a whistle.

1346
01:47:29,847 --> 01:47:33,886
When Peter Bogdanovich
was slotted to be director of this film

1347
01:47:34,007 --> 01:47:38,558
he argued with Leone "That phrase
duck you sucker nobody uses it."

1348
01:47:38,687 --> 01:47:42,236
Leone said "I'm sure they do.
It's a great American phrase."

1349
01:47:42,367 --> 01:47:46,485
They had long arguments about it.
He insisted on calling the film that.

1350
01:47:46,607 --> 01:47:52,318
When it came out in the United States
one reason for it not being a success

1351
01:47:52,447 --> 01:47:56,759
was said to be the odd title -
Duck You Sucker who says that?

1352
01:47:56,887 --> 01:47:58,957
A Fistful Of Dynamite is unsuitable

1353
01:48:02,727 --> 01:48:06,515
Once Upon A Time The Revolution
is the best of all.

1354
01:48:09,527 --> 01:48:13,600
This sequence of these trenches
with civilians being mown down

1355
01:48:13,727 --> 01:48:15,524
by the troops of Huerta

1356
01:48:15,647 --> 01:48:18,002
a sequence pruned beyond all recognition

1357
01:48:18,127 --> 01:48:21,244
in the original release prints
but has been put back

1358
01:48:21,367 --> 01:48:24,279
was shot at a disused sugar factory in Guadix.

1359
01:48:24,407 --> 01:48:29,959
The stone ditches where
the sugar beet would be washed.

1360
01:48:30,087 --> 01:48:34,558
It's the sugar factory of San Turcuato
just outside the centre of Guadix.

1361
01:48:34,687 --> 01:48:39,044
It took Andrea Crisanti's eye to spot
this would be a marvellous location

1362
01:48:39,167 --> 01:48:43,638
for the ditches as Leone said
the ditches of Dachau and Mauthausen

1363
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:47,885
which are re-enacted in these reprisals
for revolutionary activity.

1364
01:48:48,007 --> 01:48:52,319
Here's a refugee train with everyone
getting out of Mesa Verde.

1365
01:48:52,447 --> 01:48:56,804
The railway line was extended from
the depot at Guadix to the sugar factory

1366
01:48:56,927 --> 01:49:01,717
in order to get the locomotive in the
same shot as the edge of the factory.

1367
01:49:10,447 --> 01:49:15,521
Much of this was cut originally to save time.
The movie was thought to be too long.

1368
01:49:15,647 --> 01:49:20,596
Most of Leone's films
had been cut for reasons of time.

1369
01:49:20,727 --> 01:49:23,958
A lot of background
to the American Civil War in Texas went

1370
01:49:24,087 --> 01:49:27,875
in The Good The Bad And The Ugly
and has recently been put back.

1371
01:49:28,007 --> 01:49:33,001
Here a lot of the political background
about Huerta was removed.

1372
01:49:33,127 --> 01:49:36,437
Part of the texture of the film
one theme is friendship

1373
01:49:36,567 --> 01:49:40,355
another the Mexican Revolution
this theme of the fascistic regime

1374
01:49:40,487 --> 01:49:44,958
clinging on to power
and all these random acts of cruelty.

1375
01:49:45,087 --> 01:49:49,000
Here's an actor who look s
just like the young Mussolini

1376
01:49:49,127 --> 01:49:51,118
who was chosen for his physiognomy.

1377
01:49:51,247 --> 01:49:54,762
Leone knew Italian audiences
would recognise him for a moment

1378
01:49:54,887 --> 01:49:59,722
which again was cut from the release
print when the film first came out.

1379
01:49:59,847 --> 01:50:04,238
These textures these layers these
contexts for everything that's going on

1380
01:50:04,367 --> 01:50:09,043
this idea of Huerta's regime clinging on
with all these redundant things.

1381
01:50:09,167 --> 01:50:12,318
These people don 't have to die.
This needless cruelty.

1382
01:50:12,447 --> 01:50:16,042
It's something that went missing
when the film first came out.

1383
01:50:16,167 --> 01:50:19,398
Another reference
to the letterbox shape of the image

1384
01:50:19,527 --> 01:50:23,361
like the poster earlier in Mesa Verde.

1385
01:50:28,927 --> 01:50:32,840
Steiger is watching all this mayhem
that's going on in Mesa Verde

1386
01:50:32,967 --> 01:50:37,119
sitting in a cattle truck another
20th-century historical reference

1387
01:50:37,247 --> 01:50:39,044
with ghoulish connotations

1388
01:50:39,167 --> 01:50:44,241
the cattle truck s that took the victims
to the concentration camps from Poland.

1389
01:50:44,367 --> 01:50:46,676
It's a deliberate reference.

1390
01:50:46,807 --> 01:50:51,642
Just as the troops massacring people
in ditches are reminiscent of the Nazis

1391
01:50:51,767 --> 01:50:55,555
so the cattle truck s are reminiscent
of the same regime.

1392
01:50:56,967 --> 01:51:00,596
It's a way of making the politics
of a distant period and land

1393
01:51:00,727 --> 01:51:05,164
come alive to a European audience
by giving it historical reference.

1394
01:51:05,287 --> 01:51:11,362
In an intuitive way Leone was good at
assembling these cultural references.

1395
01:51:11,487 --> 01:51:13,478
He wasn 't an intellectual.

1396
01:51:13,607 --> 01:51:17,998
He wasn 't a deeply read man.
He'd never been in higher education.

1397
01:51:18,127 --> 01:51:21,119
He'd never done history or English
or studied cinema.

1398
01:51:21,247 --> 01:51:26,924
He studied to be a lawyer - his father
wanted him to be a lawyer - in the late 1940s.

1399
01:51:27,047 --> 01:51:30,323
He was working out of his system
his own biography.

1400
01:51:30,447 --> 01:51:32,438
He was born in the late '20s

1401
01:51:32,567 --> 01:51:36,845
grew up in the 1930s in a suburb
of Rome in Mussolini's Italy

1402
01:51:36,967 --> 01:51:39,561
where American movies
were a model of freedom.

1403
01:51:39,687 --> 01:51:43,805
Wide open spaces the Westerns
gangster films fast talking of Cagney

1404
01:51:43,927 --> 01:51:48,239
all these things Leone has remembered
as having an impact on his psyche.

1405
01:51:48,367 --> 01:51:52,280
It was the land of plenty
the other side of the sea.

1406
01:51:52,407 --> 01:51:56,002
Then in 1944 he met American troops in person

1407
01:51:56,127 --> 01:51:59,119
after the Sicily landings
when they were going north.

1408
01:51:59,247 --> 01:52:03,843
The American troops weren 't anything
like the comic book heroes of his youth

1409
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:06,356
or the movies he'd seen in the '30s.

1410
01:52:06,487 --> 01:52:09,797
That juxtaposition between
the American troops of reality

1411
01:52:09,927 --> 01:52:11,918
at a very impressionable age

1412
01:52:12,047 --> 01:52:15,119
and the image on the silver screen in the 1930s

1413
01:52:15,247 --> 01:52:17,841
was something he was
working out of his system.

1414
01:52:17,967 --> 01:52:21,516
He loved American movies American fairy tales

1415
01:52:21,647 --> 01:52:23,956
but he didn 't always like the ideology.

1416
01:52:24,087 --> 01:52:26,965
It's that collision that runs through his films

1417
01:52:27,087 --> 01:52:29,885
in this one in a very serious setting.

1418
01:52:32,447 --> 01:52:35,996
As the relationship
between Sean and Juan develops

1419
01:52:36,127 --> 01:52:40,405
we're at the point where Juan is no
longer interested in money and bank s

1420
01:52:40,527 --> 01:52:45,317
in robbery and this lust for life he had
in the first half of the movie.

1421
01:52:45,447 --> 01:52:49,998
And Sean is beginning to question
his commitment to the revolution.

1422
01:52:50,127 --> 01:52:54,598
We're balanced as the two
become dependent on each other.

1423
01:52:54,727 --> 01:53:00,518
Sean has been leading Juan a merry dance
but Juan has been a compliant victim.

1424
01:53:00,647 --> 01:53:05,163
But now they're beginning to see that
maybe they should both go to America.

1425
01:53:05,287 --> 01:53:08,279
Maybe they should get out of Mexico completely.

1426
01:53:08,407 --> 01:53:14,198
Sean is trying to cheer Juan up. He realises
the depth of his grief and that he caused it.

1427
01:53:14,327 --> 01:53:17,637
Let's cheer him up
talk about the land of milk and honey.

1428
01:53:17,767 --> 01:53:22,682
The trouble is that both the exits from
this carriage lead into the revolution.

1429
01:54:02,607 --> 01:54:04,996
Another reference to the letterbox image

1430
01:54:05,127 --> 01:54:09,518
as Sean look s out of the cattle truck
at what's going on beyond.

1431
01:54:09,647 --> 01:54:12,400
This film was shot between April and July 19T'O

1432
01:54:12,527 --> 01:54:15,803
a very particular moment in Italian film history.

1433
01:54:15,927 --> 01:54:19,044
A series of films were
being made or in the pipeline

1434
01:54:19,167 --> 01:54:24,685
which were revisionist versions of the
Second World War revisiting the Nazi period.

1435
01:54:24,807 --> 01:54:28,322
The Night Porter Salon Kitty

1436
01:54:28,447 --> 01:54:31,007
And Pasolini was shortly to make Salo

1437
01:54:31,127 --> 01:54:35,245
a film about the decaying embers
of fascism in northern Italy

1438
01:54:35,367 --> 01:54:41,442
where the cruelty and the decadence
and the general atmosphere of mayhem

1439
01:54:41,567 --> 01:54:43,444
resembles that in this film.

1440
01:54:43,567 --> 01:54:46,320
Sean sees the car pull up and sees

1441
01:54:46,447 --> 01:54:49,245
accompanied by Morricone's dissonant music

1442
01:54:49,367 --> 01:54:52,803
the governor Don Jaime get out of the car.

1443
01:54:52,927 --> 01:54:57,603
We've seen him on the poster
in Mesa Verde and we recognise him.

1444
01:54:57,727 --> 01:55:00,161
He's getting on the train.

1445
01:55:00,287 --> 01:55:02,676
But Juan doesn 't know that yet.

1446
01:55:09,527 --> 01:55:13,759
When the original soundtrack album
to this film came out in Italy

1447
01:55:16,887 --> 01:55:21,881
He'd produced scores for 25 films
in the last year alone

1448
01:55:24,647 --> 01:55:27,639
He was at his peak as a film composer.

1449
01:55:27,767 --> 01:55:30,804
Leone wrote a postcard
on the back of the album sleeve

1450
01:55:30,927 --> 01:55:34,886
where he said to Morricone "I have
seen you sleep on benches at school

1451
01:55:35,007 --> 01:55:37,202
heard you snore on the editing table

1452
01:55:37,327 --> 01:55:40,717
but this music is so beautiful
these sounds so magnificent

1453
01:55:40,847 --> 01:55:43,315
I wonder when you could have composed them."

1454
01:55:43,447 --> 01:55:45,438
It became a gag between them.

1455
01:55:45,567 --> 01:55:49,082
Morricone was used to getting up
at six in the morning.

1456
01:55:49,207 --> 01:55:51,198
Leone liked working in the evening.

1457
01:55:51,327 --> 01:55:53,477
On one occasion in the editing room

1458
01:55:53,607 --> 01:55:58,681
Morricone fell asleep while they were
talking about the soundtrack

1459
01:55:58,807 --> 01:56:01,924
something Leone never forgot
and reminded him of.

1460
01:56:02,047 --> 01:56:06,677
In fact he elaborated the story.
Leone liked embellishing stories.

1461
01:56:06,807 --> 01:56:08,798
As the story gathered momentum

1462
01:56:08,927 --> 01:56:12,442
he claimed that Morricone
was standing in the recording studio

1463
01:56:12,567 --> 01:56:14,444
and slumped down and fell asleep

1464
01:56:14,567 --> 01:56:18,924
at which point Leone went
to the microphone in the glass booth

1465
01:56:19,047 --> 01:56:23,677
and pretended to be the voice of God
"Wake up. This is the voice of doom."

1466
01:56:23,807 --> 01:56:27,561
It never happened. Morricone
would never be that unprofessional

1467
01:56:27,687 --> 01:56:30,759
but it became folklore in the Italian film industry.

1468
01:56:30,887 --> 01:56:33,401
Another piece of folklore surrounding Leone

1469
01:56:33,527 --> 01:56:37,600
was about the detail that he put
into the backgrounds of his sequences.

1470
01:56:37,727 --> 01:56:41,322
The story relates to
The Good The Bad And The Ugly

1471
01:56:41,447 --> 01:56:44,007
It became folklore at Cinecittá studios.

1472
01:56:45,087 --> 01:56:49,160
When they were filming
The Good The Bad And The Ugly

1473
01:56:49,287 --> 01:56:55,237
Leone said to the crew
"We haven 't quite finished this sequence."

1474
01:56:55,367 --> 01:56:58,325
"There's just the detail of the spur to finish."

1475
01:56:58,447 --> 01:57:03,123
"We'll do the detail of the spur
as a cutaway at some later date."

1476
01:57:03,247 --> 01:57:05,522
So they decided to leave the detail.

1477
01:57:05,647 --> 01:57:09,879
Just towards the end they decide
to film this moment of the spur.

1478
01:57:10,007 --> 01:57:15,365
Leone says "There's 400 troops
600 horses and a bridge blowing up."

1479
01:57:15,487 --> 01:57:19,605
That was the detail of the spur.
This was the reputation Leone was getting.

1480
01:57:19,727 --> 01:57:23,003
Bigger and bigger movies
lots going on in the background

1481
01:57:23,127 --> 01:57:25,482
including this ambush on the train.

1482
01:57:31,207 --> 01:57:36,042
By now he had very large budgets
United Artists backing him

1483
01:57:36,167 --> 01:57:38,886
two top-line actors on the international stage.

1484
01:57:41,327 --> 01:57:44,364
but an Oscar-winning actor
and a famous action actor.

1485
01:57:44,487 --> 01:57:48,765
He's propelled into a different league
in this big-budget action movie.

1486
01:57:48,887 --> 01:57:51,321
He's shading into David Lean territory

1487
01:57:51,447 --> 01:57:56,282
and leaving the territory
of the popular Italian cinema behind.

1488
01:58:05,327 --> 01:58:09,878
One might ask here we're in Franco's Spain

1489
01:58:10,007 --> 01:58:12,362
and here's a film about politics

1490
01:58:12,487 --> 01:58:16,241
a debate about revolution commitment

1491
01:58:16,367 --> 01:58:19,086
bandit turning into revolutionary

1492
01:58:19,207 --> 01:58:23,120
peasant getting a conscience
intellectual getting disillusioned.

1493
01:58:23,247 --> 01:58:26,159
How were they allowed
to make movies of this kind

1494
01:58:26,287 --> 01:58:29,279
at a time of fascist regime in Spain?

1495
01:58:29,407 --> 01:58:34,003
Clint Eastwood once said
that if the movie was set in the past

1496
01:58:34,127 --> 01:58:36,482
in a historical setting no one minded.

1497
01:58:36,607 --> 01:58:40,441
100 Italian Westerns had been made in Almería

1498
01:58:40,567 --> 01:58:43,001
since 1964 since Fistful Of Dollars

1499
01:58:43,127 --> 01:58:48,440
250 Italian/Spanish Westerns had been
made between 1964 and 19T'O

1500
01:58:48,567 --> 01:58:51,320
an avalanche of movies
but they were in the past

1501
01:58:51,447 --> 01:58:54,757
folklore cowboy films
no one paid much attention to them.

1502
01:58:54,887 --> 01:59:00,405
But sometimes hidden within them
is an interesting debate about politics

1503
01:59:00,527 --> 01:59:03,678
and this is a very political moment.

1504
01:59:03,807 --> 01:59:06,196
Will Juan shoot the governor?

1505
01:59:08,807 --> 01:59:10,638
And if so what would his motivation be?

1506
01:59:10,767 --> 01:59:12,997
Is it revenge for his family?

1507
01:59:13,127 --> 01:59:16,597
Is it showing solidarity with the revolution?

1508
01:59:16,727 --> 01:59:21,721
He's certainly got well beyond simply
wanting to take the treasure from him.

1509
01:59:27,287 --> 01:59:30,085
Like the Wanted poster
in For A Few Dollars More

1510
01:59:30,207 --> 01:59:33,358
a cinematic moment of the camera
going in on the poster

1511
01:59:33,487 --> 01:59:38,686
to Steiger's eyes the machine gun
sound and pictures of his six children.

1512
01:59:38,807 --> 01:59:41,844
A purely visual image
of what's going through his mind

1513
01:59:41,967 --> 01:59:45,562
constructed on the editing bench
like in For A Few Dollars More

1514
01:59:45,687 --> 01:59:49,805
where Van Cleef Eastwood and
the poster of El Indio meet together.

1515
01:59:49,927 --> 01:59:53,806
The governor realises exactly
what's going through his head

1516
01:59:53,927 --> 01:59:57,317
and that this means he's going to pull the trigger.

1517
02:00:19,327 --> 02:00:21,124
He offers Juan the treasure.

1518
02:00:21,247 --> 02:00:25,559
The Juan early on in the film
who saw the bank as the Holy Grail

1519
02:00:25,687 --> 02:00:28,155
would accept this treasure.

1520
02:00:29,807 --> 02:00:33,880
Revolution means confusion.
Revolution means we can take the spoils.

1521
02:00:34,007 --> 02:00:38,239
Like a lot of characters in the Italian
Westerns of the late 1960s.

1522
02:00:38,367 --> 02:00:40,517
But he's got well beyond that.

1523
02:00:40,647 --> 02:00:44,037
He's not interested in the treasure any more.

1524
02:00:44,167 --> 02:00:49,400
He's developed a conscience honour and he
has a very good reason to kill the governor.

1525
02:00:49,527 --> 02:00:53,315
He associates him
with the massacre of his family.

1526
02:00:53,447 --> 02:00:57,918
Family is so often a touchstone in
Leone's films for people's motivation.

1527
02:00:58,047 --> 02:01:00,959
Like the holy family in Fistful Of Dollars

1528
02:01:01,087 --> 02:01:05,444
Like Tuco's brother in
The Good The Bad And The Ugly

1529
02:01:05,567 --> 02:01:11,244
In a not very moral universe
the family remains important.

1530
02:01:30,087 --> 02:01:32,396
Treasure or revenge?

1531
02:01:44,127 --> 02:01:46,846
Juan for the second time becomes the hero.

1532
02:01:46,967 --> 02:01:49,401
The first time by mistake at the bank

1533
02:01:49,527 --> 02:01:53,918
and this time because of his personal
vendetta against the governor.

1534
02:02:09,207 --> 02:02:11,516
Another reference to Leone's hands.

1535
02:02:11,647 --> 02:02:17,517
When Leone got nervous he'd pull on
a cigarette packet or shake his hands.

1536
02:02:17,647 --> 02:02:21,720
A lot of very active body language.
So much to think about.

1537
02:02:21,847 --> 02:02:24,759
Without storyboards so much to get right

1538
02:02:24,887 --> 02:02:27,037
in order to implement his vision.

1539
02:02:27,167 --> 02:02:31,240
The letterbox image. By now Leone
is making self-conscience references

1540
02:02:31,367 --> 02:02:35,246
to his careful use of framing
which a lot of critics have noticed.

1541
02:02:35,367 --> 02:02:39,519
The way in which Leone places figures
in the frame is so cinematic.

1542
02:02:39,647 --> 02:02:42,639
It would never work in a theatrical context.

1543
02:02:42,767 --> 02:02:46,362
Now he's making jokes
about his own letterbox images.

1544
02:02:55,647 --> 02:02:58,286
A lyrical version of the March of the Beggars

1545
02:02:58,407 --> 02:03:03,117
which we first saw as the stagecoach
disgorged its contents into the pigsty

1546
02:03:03,247 --> 02:03:06,319
then we saw
at the political prison in Mesa Verde

1547
02:03:06,447 --> 02:03:09,439
as Juan fingers the treasure.

1548
02:03:36,767 --> 02:03:39,759
Like the blasting of the wall in Mesa Verde

1549
02:03:39,887 --> 02:03:43,926
they open the cattle truck
and he becomes a hero.

1550
02:03:44,047 --> 02:03:47,244
He may not want to be a great general
to be Pancho Villa

1551
02:03:47,447 --> 02:03:50,041
but somehow he's turned into that.

1552
02:03:50,167 --> 02:03:55,446
For the final part of the film
we have some detail about the villistas

1553
02:03:55,567 --> 02:03:59,879
the revolutionary cell
planning its campaign against Huerta

1554
02:04:00,007 --> 02:04:02,362
into which Juan has now been enmeshed.

1555
02:04:16,127 --> 02:04:19,802
Whereas Villega was
the intellectual revolutionary earlier

1556
02:04:19,927 --> 02:04:25,126
this is a soldier strategist
a soldier revolutionary.

1557
02:04:25,247 --> 02:04:27,238
Villega doesn 't know that they know

1558
02:04:27,367 --> 02:04:30,518
that he betrayed all those people
in the firing squad.

1559
02:04:30,647 --> 02:04:32,877
And nor does Juan.

1560
02:04:33,007 --> 02:04:36,602
Unusual for Leone to have
a reference to a historical character.

1561
02:04:36,727 --> 02:04:40,800
He tried to avoid real-life characters in his films.

1562
02:04:40,927 --> 02:04:43,964
He said "I don 't like
a waxwork s view of history"

1563
02:04:44,087 --> 02:04:51,767
a film about the past where someone wears a
costume impersonating a historical character.

1564
02:04:51,887 --> 02:04:54,526
Rod Steiger had recently done just that

1565
02:04:54,647 --> 02:04:59,960
in the Russian version of Waterloo
where Steiger played Napoleon

1566
02:05:00,087 --> 02:05:04,638
And where he'd had famous rows
with Serge Bondarchuk the director

1567
02:05:07,167 --> 02:05:10,398
that Steiger felt he was losing spontaneity

1568
02:05:10,527 --> 02:05:12,916
like Leone only on an even bigger scale.

1569
02:05:13,047 --> 02:05:15,925
That waxwork view of history
was far from Leone

1570
02:05:16,047 --> 02:05:18,925
so it's rare to have a reference to Villa.

1571
02:05:19,047 --> 02:05:21,481
That locates it in a very specific context

1572
02:05:21,607 --> 02:05:25,600
rather then the diffuse one
which he's been painting up to now.

1573
02:05:31,247 --> 02:05:34,637
Another expletive cut
in the international release prints.

1574
02:05:34,767 --> 02:05:39,158
The world seems to have caught up
with that kind of language today.

1575
02:06:06,127 --> 02:06:09,119
So we're in 1913 Huerta is hanging on

1576
02:06:09,247 --> 02:06:14,275
Villa is coming down from the north
Zapata is coming up from the south.

1577
02:06:14,407 --> 02:06:17,240
They're about to converge on Mexico City.

1578
02:06:17,367 --> 02:06:20,564
This is the historical context for this film.

1579
02:06:23,407 --> 02:06:28,083
The revolution is in the balance.
Will the social reforms be set back?

1580
02:06:28,207 --> 02:06:32,405
Or will Villa and Zapata get there
and continue the momentum?

1581
02:06:32,527 --> 02:06:35,325
Is Villa a bandit or a revolutionary?

1582
02:06:35,447 --> 02:06:37,438
Will he have the staying power

1583
02:06:37,567 --> 02:06:40,877
or like Juan will he go away with the loot?

1584
02:06:42,647 --> 02:06:46,526
Issues like that which had been
part of the Hollywood vision

1585
02:06:46,647 --> 02:06:50,117
of the Mexican Revolution
from Viva Villa' onwards

1586
02:06:50,247 --> 02:06:54,320
the bandit who becomes a revolutionary
but at heart is a bandit

1587
02:06:54,447 --> 02:06:57,325
had filtered their way into the Italian Western

1588
02:06:57,447 --> 02:07:01,520
but in the form of Gíú La Testa
Once Upon A Time The Revolution

1589
02:07:01,647 --> 02:07:05,959
it was making quite large demands
on the popular audience.

1590
02:07:06,087 --> 02:07:09,796
It showed in the box office takings
of Gíú La Testa first time round.

1591
02:07:09,927 --> 02:07:12,316
Fistful Of Dollars had been a huge success

1592
02:07:12,447 --> 02:07:18,079
For A Few Dollars More the most popular
Italian film till the early 'T'Os.

1593
02:07:18,207 --> 02:07:23,201
Once Upon A Time In The West not
so successful because it was badly cut

1594
02:07:23,327 --> 02:07:26,683
and the Italian audience
was a bit baffled by it in.

1595
02:07:26,807 --> 02:07:29,082
They didn 't know what to make of it.

1596
02:07:29,207 --> 02:07:34,122
Someone said going to Monument Valley
to film had had a bad effect on Leone.

1597
02:07:34,247 --> 02:07:36,283
He should have stayed in Italy.

1598
02:07:36,407 --> 02:07:40,878
He was making this strange
slow elegiac film.

1599
02:07:41,007 --> 02:07:44,283
So this captured a moment
Gíú La Testa in Italy.

1600
02:07:44,407 --> 02:07:47,604
People realised how it related
to the political context

1601
02:07:47,727 --> 02:07:50,400
but it didn 't feel like
a huge popular success.

1602
02:07:53,447 --> 02:07:57,235
From the point of violence
it was quite restrained for Leone.

1603
02:07:57,367 --> 02:07:59,164
It was dealing with big issues

1604
02:07:59,287 --> 02:08:02,563
of betrayal and commitment
and mutual dependence.

1605
02:08:04,167 --> 02:08:05,122
It didn 't have a huge
either critical or popular success

1606
02:08:06,407 --> 02:08:10,764
in Italy when it came out
but this was a story Leone liked telling.

1607
02:08:10,887 --> 02:08:15,278
Just after the premiere in France
he was sitting in a restaurant

1608
02:08:15,407 --> 02:08:19,559
and someone came over and put
a bottle of Champagne on his table.

1609
02:08:19,687 --> 02:08:24,556
He said "Why are you doing that?"
This man said "I'd like to thank you."

1610
02:08:24,687 --> 02:08:29,317
"I have two children and both have been
deeply involved in left-wing politics."

1611
02:08:29,447 --> 02:08:35,044
They were students and they'd been
drawn into semi-revolutionary activity.

1612
02:08:35,167 --> 02:08:36,964
"They went to see your movie

1613
02:08:37,087 --> 02:08:42,036
and decided they don 't want to do that
with their lives so I owe you a lot."

1614
02:08:42,167 --> 02:08:47,036
Leone said that was won'th all
the criticisms in Italian newspapers

1615
02:08:47,167 --> 02:08:50,364
that he'd had an effect
on two young people's lives.

1616
02:08:50,487 --> 02:08:55,925
In Italy various people said
this "I don 't give a damn attitude"

1617
02:08:56,047 --> 02:08:58,607
where did Leone's heart lie in this debate?

1618
02:08:58,727 --> 02:09:01,924
He's saying that revolution means confusion

1619
02:09:02,047 --> 02:09:05,198
and ideological revolutionaries aren 't humane.

1620
02:09:05,327 --> 02:09:08,637
He's saying people cling on to power
regimes come and go

1621
02:09:08,767 --> 02:09:12,282
but most of them are violent
and the sufferers are the peasants

1622
02:09:12,407 --> 02:09:14,398
so that's not an option.

1623
02:09:14,527 --> 02:09:18,884
The simple man Rod Steiger has been
drawn into more complex issues.

1624
02:09:19,007 --> 02:09:24,161
He'll never be the same again. He has
a conscience and it's destroying him.

1625
02:09:24,287 --> 02:09:27,438
So what in the end
is the position of this film?

1626
02:09:27,567 --> 02:09:33,483
There's a political position in Italy
which is l-don 't-give-a-damn politics.

1627
02:09:33,607 --> 02:09:37,077
"I don 't like central government.
I don 't like the state."

1628
02:09:37,207 --> 02:09:40,756
"I want to get on with my life.
I don 't give a damn."

1629
02:09:40,887 --> 02:09:44,482
This film was related to that
rather dangerous political ideology

1630
02:09:44,607 --> 02:09:47,405
of never getting involved in anything.

1631
02:09:47,527 --> 02:09:49,518
That debate about the revolution

1632
02:09:49,647 --> 02:09:52,207
people who read book s
pushing people around

1633
02:09:52,327 --> 02:09:55,239
could be interpreted
as a plea for ignorance.

1634
02:09:58,607 --> 02:10:01,883
So in bursting the bubble of 1968

1635
02:10:02,007 --> 02:10:06,683
and of the myth of political
Italian Westerns and cinema

1636
02:10:06,807 --> 02:10:09,162
and making a statement about politics

1637
02:10:09,287 --> 02:10:12,245
Leone is dangerously close
to saying leave me alone

1638
02:10:12,367 --> 02:10:14,881
I just want to be with my family

1639
02:10:15,007 --> 02:10:17,646
I don 't give a damn about formal politics.

1640
02:10:17,767 --> 02:10:20,884
Keep your head down
don 't get involved or committed.

1641
02:10:21,007 --> 02:10:24,761
That really angered a lot of critics in Italy.

1642
02:10:24,887 --> 02:10:27,685
They found it a dangerous position.

1643
02:10:27,807 --> 02:10:30,799
One should get committed.
One should be a citizen.

1644
02:10:37,567 --> 02:10:39,558
Here we have another flashback

1645
02:10:39,687 --> 02:10:45,319
as Villega has recovered from being tortured

1646
02:10:45,447 --> 02:10:48,086
and betraying his friends.

1647
02:10:48,207 --> 02:10:52,359
Sean remembers a similar moment
catching up with where we were

1648
02:10:52,487 --> 02:10:54,876
in the pub in Dublin.

1649
02:10:58,967 --> 02:11:01,356
The moment of betrayal.

1650
02:11:11,327 --> 02:11:16,242
Sean turns round and shoots the British
soldiers.

1651
02:11:20,687 --> 02:11:24,475
Again with this romantic
Sean theme on the soundtrack

1652
02:11:24,607 --> 02:11:27,565
which plays against the image.

1653
02:11:27,687 --> 02:11:31,475
He's shooting two people
but the music isn 't telling you that.

1654
02:11:31,607 --> 02:11:36,476
It's a nostalgic reverie but it also
is unlocking traumas about the past.

1655
02:11:37,807 --> 02:11:40,719
Will he shoot the friend who betrayed him?

1656
02:11:43,367 --> 02:11:45,597
Gypo Nolan played by Victor McLaglen

1657
02:11:45,727 --> 02:11:49,800
who betrays his friend Frankie to
the police in order to get blood money

1658
02:11:49,927 --> 02:11:53,317
in order to pay for the passage
to America so he can emigrate.

1659
02:11:53,447 --> 02:11:55,836
It's a very similar situation.

1660
02:12:00,567 --> 02:12:03,798
Leone said of John Ford's vision of Ireland

1661
02:12:03,927 --> 02:12:08,045
that Ford as himself
an immigrant of Irish parenthood

1662
02:12:08,167 --> 02:12:11,000
moving to the East Coast then to Hollywood

1663
02:12:11,127 --> 02:12:13,800
that his films are optimistic in the end

1664
02:12:13,927 --> 02:12:17,317
about the melting pot
integrating into American society.

1665
02:12:20,567 --> 02:12:24,719
In The Quiet Man impossibly green lush rural.

1666
02:12:24,847 --> 02:12:27,361
It's like a picture-postcard view of Ireland.

1667
02:12:27,487 --> 02:12:31,799
But this is something
very different to a picture postcard.

1668
02:12:31,927 --> 02:12:34,316
Sean has just shot his best friend.

1669
02:12:42,247 --> 02:12:44,841
Should he kill Villega?

1670
02:12:44,967 --> 02:12:51,236
Or has he matured to the point where
he doesn 't take his revenge that far?

1671
02:12:53,887 --> 02:12:55,878
"I believe only in dynamite."

1672
02:12:56,007 --> 02:13:00,000
All his ideals have gone
all that revolutionary fervour from Ireland.

1673
02:13:00,127 --> 02:13:03,517
Now he's just a technician that blows people up.

1674
02:13:11,047 --> 02:13:17,520
He wants to turn Villega into a manual worker
who's going to stoke the coal on the train.

1675
02:13:17,647 --> 02:13:22,163
This strategist who sits in back rooms
thinking how to send people into action

1676
02:13:22,287 --> 02:13:25,802
it's time he did something
so he's going to stoke up the train

1677
02:13:25,927 --> 02:13:30,717
which is gonna go full speed into
the train coming in the other direction

1678
02:13:30,847 --> 02:13:34,999
with Huerta's troops
in an almighty head-on collision.

1679
02:13:46,167 --> 02:13:49,716
The trains were craftsmen -made
scale models from Rome.

1680
02:13:49,847 --> 02:13:52,441
I hate to spoil this. They're not real trains.

1681
02:13:52,567 --> 02:13:55,559
They were models made by craftsmen in Rome.

1682
02:13:55,687 --> 02:13:58,963
Andrea Crisanti took a lot of trouble to get right

1683
02:13:59,087 --> 02:14:02,079
the verisimilitude of these two trains.

1684
02:14:22,007 --> 02:14:23,998
Villega realises what's going on.

1685
02:14:24,127 --> 02:14:27,881
He realises that Sean knows
he betrayed his comrades

1686
02:14:28,007 --> 02:14:30,396
and that he's setting him up.

1687
02:14:31,407 --> 02:14:34,126
Typical Leone moment.
Nothing's explained.

1688
02:14:34,247 --> 02:14:38,559
You just look at Villega's face
as it dawns on him what's happening.

1689
02:14:38,687 --> 02:14:42,680
He's being sent to his doom by Sean
in revenge for the betrayal.

1690
02:14:52,207 --> 02:14:57,406
Does Villega stay on the train commit
suicide in the cause of the revolution?

1691
02:14:57,527 --> 02:15:01,406
Or does he jump off
at the last minute to save himself?

1692
02:15:13,687 --> 02:15:19,205
"Save yourself." So in the end
Sean is humane enough to save Villega.

1693
02:15:19,327 --> 02:15:22,285
He doesn 't want him
to go on this suicidal mission

1694
02:15:22,407 --> 02:15:24,204
but Villega think s otherwise.

1695
02:15:38,047 --> 02:15:40,038
He hasn 't jumped.

1696
02:15:53,567 --> 02:15:55,558
Another Leone explosion.

1697
02:15:56,887 --> 02:16:01,358
He keeps upping the ante.
We have the explosion of the stagecoach

1698
02:16:01,487 --> 02:16:05,241
the explosion of the bridge
and this huge explosion of the train

1699
02:16:05,367 --> 02:16:09,519
these two forces hitting each other
like an atomic explosion

1700
02:16:09,647 --> 02:16:12,878
for the meeting of the two trains.

1701
02:16:13,007 --> 02:16:14,998
Leone likes explosions.

1702
02:16:20,367 --> 02:16:24,679
His brother-in -law Fulvio Morsella
one of the producers of this film

1703
02:16:24,807 --> 02:16:27,367
and who helped to write the treatment

1704
02:16:27,487 --> 02:16:33,278
once told me that Leone had this
spectacularising tendency in movies and in life.

1705
02:16:33,407 --> 02:16:37,958
In his life he liked to embroider
stories he'd heard like Falstaff

1706
02:16:38,087 --> 02:16:41,284
and make them a little bit better in the telling.

1707
02:16:41,407 --> 02:16:45,241
He enjoyed telling after-dinner stories
and smoking Havana cigars

1708
02:16:45,367 --> 02:16:48,757
and guffawing with laughter with film friends.

1709
02:16:48,887 --> 02:16:52,004
In the movies he had
this spectacularising tendency.

1710
02:16:52,127 --> 02:16:56,757
As his career developed
each film revisits situations

1711
02:16:56,887 --> 02:17:00,004
he's looked at in the past in a symphonic way

1712
02:17:00,127 --> 02:17:04,643
this time taking them in new directions
and making them more spectacular.

1713
02:17:04,767 --> 02:17:10,444
The set of the town of Flagstone
in Once Upon A Time In The West

1714
02:17:10,567 --> 02:17:13,639
cost more than the entire budget
of Fistful Of Dollars

1715
02:17:13,767 --> 02:17:17,282
So one set cost more
than the whole budget of Fistful

1716
02:17:17,407 --> 02:17:20,558
Here a huge budget movie
with lots of action sequences.

1717
02:17:20,687 --> 02:17:22,678
The traditional Italian Western

1718
02:17:22,807 --> 02:17:26,482
has one or two big action sequences
to give body to the film

1719
02:17:26,607 --> 02:17:29,405
to give the impression that it is big budget.

1720
02:17:29,527 --> 02:17:32,485
Here the action sequences
are sewn through the film.

1721
02:17:32,607 --> 02:17:36,600
This is an international
Hollywood Italian production.

1722
02:17:36,727 --> 02:17:39,924
The spectacularising effect gets bigger.

1723
02:17:40,047 --> 02:17:44,757
Fulvio Morsella said Leone would have
made a great director of operas.

1724
02:17:44,887 --> 02:17:46,878
He was very often offered operas.

1725
02:17:49,567 --> 02:17:52,365
which was the first spaghetti western

1726
02:17:52,487 --> 02:17:56,685
which premiered at the Met in New York
just before the First World War.

1727
02:17:56,807 --> 02:18:01,483
But he wasn 't interested in people
singing before getting on their horses.

1728
02:18:01,607 --> 02:18:04,917
He wanted people to get on with it
where character is action

1729
02:18:05,047 --> 02:18:09,245
and people are defined by what they do
so he turned down offers of operas.

1730
02:18:09,367 --> 02:18:12,996
He was offered Carmen
which Francesco Rosi went on to make

1731
02:18:13,127 --> 02:18:15,800
but for the same reason Leone turned it down.

1732
02:18:15,927 --> 02:18:20,318
Although his films have been called
operas in which the arias are stared

1733
02:18:20,447 --> 02:18:22,756
and they're also called horse operas

1734
02:18:22,887 --> 02:18:26,641
and you could argue the relationship
with Morricone is like

1735
02:18:26,767 --> 02:18:30,476
director and musician
composer for the opera

1736
02:18:30,607 --> 02:18:33,997
in a literal sense
Leone didn 't have much time for opera

1737
02:18:34,127 --> 02:18:37,119
but he certainly had a taste for spectacle.

1738
02:18:45,687 --> 02:18:50,761
By now he was brilliant at logistics
at working out an extremely complex set

1739
02:18:50,887 --> 02:18:53,685
with an idea of the story in his head.

1740
02:19:01,687 --> 02:19:06,807
If this was an Italian Western we'd be
building up to a duel at this stage

1741
02:19:06,927 --> 02:19:10,044
where the two characters would meet

1742
02:19:10,167 --> 02:19:15,400
and one of them would finally
get his revenge on the other

1743
02:19:15,527 --> 02:19:17,722
and the whole thing would be resolved.

1744
02:19:17,847 --> 02:19:20,315
This is too complicated a world for that.

1745
02:19:20,447 --> 02:19:25,805
Sean is shot in the back several times
and Juan look s completely lost.

1746
02:19:27,247 --> 02:19:31,320
The dance of death
the duel at the end of Leone's films

1747
02:19:31,447 --> 02:19:33,517
becomes a different kind of dance

1748
02:19:33,647 --> 02:19:39,677
as Guttierez gets shot
by Juan 's machine gun.

1749
02:19:52,567 --> 02:19:55,957
By the time Leone reached
Once Upon A Time In America

1750
02:19:56,087 --> 02:19:58,885
the duel is explicitly rejected in the last scene

1751
02:20:00,047 --> 02:20:02,561
where Noodles played by
Robert de Niro is given the gun

1752
02:20:06,767 --> 02:20:11,204
but refuses to take up the challenge
of a settling of accounts.

1753
02:20:11,327 --> 02:20:13,318
Life is too complicated for that.

1754
02:20:13,447 --> 02:20:16,837
That was fine for the world
of the Italian Western

1755
02:20:16,967 --> 02:20:20,039
but this is a movie about friendship.

1756
02:20:20,167 --> 02:20:24,319
It's a more complicated movie
than those Dollars films.

1757
02:20:59,847 --> 02:21:02,884
It's Juan 's turn to cheer up Sean for once

1758
02:21:03,007 --> 02:21:05,282
remembering the land of milk and honey.

1759
02:21:19,327 --> 02:21:21,124
"What's going to happen to me?"

1760
02:21:21,247 --> 02:21:24,000
Juan realises he's become
dependent on Sean

1761
02:21:24,127 --> 02:21:27,324
just as Sean has become
dependent on Juan.

1762
02:21:27,447 --> 02:21:32,043
They're locked into this relationship.
Juan will be lost without him.

1763
02:21:57,087 --> 02:21:59,965
"A great grand glorious hero
of the revolution"

1764
02:22:00,087 --> 02:22:03,841
first used after the raiding
of the bank in Mesa Verde

1765
02:22:03,967 --> 02:22:06,765
where Steiger becomes a reluctant hero.

1766
02:22:31,847 --> 02:22:37,046
Another theme that recurs. "I don 't want
to be a general" said Steiger earlier.

1767
02:22:40,767 --> 02:22:44,601
Sean 's about to light
one of his strange cigarettes

1768
02:22:44,727 --> 02:22:48,117
which he often uses
to light the fuse of his dynamite.

1769
02:23:00,447 --> 02:23:06,443
In his hand is the crucifix
which Juan took off his neck

1770
02:23:06,567 --> 02:23:09,798
at the grotto of San Isidro when his family died.

1771
02:23:09,927 --> 02:23:13,522
For the rest of the story
Sean has been hanging on to it

1772
02:23:13,647 --> 02:23:16,639
to give back to his friend just before he dies.

1773
02:23:25,687 --> 02:23:28,076
"I gave you a royal screwing."

1774
02:23:28,207 --> 02:23:33,440
He has a conscience about the way he led Juan
getting him involved in the revolution.

1775
02:23:33,567 --> 02:23:37,242
But Juan says no it was won'th it.

1776
02:23:38,567 --> 02:23:41,081
They've become good friends.

1777
02:23:41,207 --> 02:23:44,916
Leone had wanted to cast Coburn
ever since Fistful Of Dollars

1778
02:23:45,047 --> 02:23:48,437
He wanted him for The Man With
No Name but couldn 't afford him.

1779
02:23:48,567 --> 02:23:51,559
James Coburn wasn 't sure
whether to get involved

1780
02:23:51,687 --> 02:23:54,884
but he had dinner with
his friend Henry Fonda one night.

1781
02:23:55,007 --> 02:23:57,999
Henry Fonda said
"You must work with Sergio Leone."

1782
02:23:58,127 --> 02:24:01,722
"He's the finest director
I've worked with in my entire career."

1783
02:24:01,847 --> 02:24:05,362
Which is something for the man
who'd worked with all the greats.

1784
02:24:05,487 --> 02:24:08,320
Coburn said "You're joking."
Fonda said "No."

1785
02:24:08,447 --> 02:24:10,438
"He is an amazing experience."

1786
02:24:10,567 --> 02:24:15,641
So Coburn accepted took on the role
and became part of Gíú La Testa

1787
02:24:15,767 --> 02:24:19,442
It was not the success
everyone hoped it at the time

1788
02:24:19,567 --> 02:24:22,559
although it's achieved
this huge reputation since

1789
02:24:22,687 --> 02:24:25,884
so it didn 't do wonders
for Coburn 's reputation.

1790
02:24:27,807 --> 02:24:30,605
Flashback in the greenery of Ireland.

1791
02:24:33,367 --> 02:24:36,757
The two friends and the Irish colleen
in slow motion

1792
02:24:36,887 --> 02:24:41,005
representing the dreams of revolution
when the two of them were comrades.

1793
02:24:41,127 --> 02:24:43,118
She is in some strange way

1794
02:24:43,247 --> 02:24:47,240
a symbol of the revolution
that they're both part of in Ireland.

1795
02:24:50,007 --> 02:24:52,999
The sense of a ménage á trois between them

1796
02:24:54,047 --> 02:24:58,518
which makes the betrayal
and the shooting even more poignant

1797
02:24:58,647 --> 02:25:04,836
and in a way is the final piece
of Sean 's psychology that we need to know.

1798
02:25:04,967 --> 02:25:06,958
It wasn 't just shooting a friend.

1799
02:25:07,087 --> 02:25:12,161
It was a very close bond
between the three of them

1800
02:25:12,287 --> 02:25:14,278
and Mother Ireland.

1801
02:25:17,327 --> 02:25:22,003
This flashback was missing from
the Italian print when it first came out.

1802
02:25:22,127 --> 02:25:24,561
It made the ending particularly enigmatic

1803
02:25:24,687 --> 02:25:28,396
because there was no resolution
of what was on Sean 's mind

1804
02:25:28,527 --> 02:25:30,961
and no resolution to the Irish theme

1805
02:25:31,087 --> 02:25:34,124
which had been sewn
through all the flashback s.

1806
02:25:34,247 --> 02:25:39,241
This was one of the longest and most
elaborate flashback s in Leone's cinema.

1807
02:25:53,967 --> 02:25:55,958
With Once Upon A Time In America

1808
02:25:56,087 --> 02:25:59,363
Leone even dared
to finish the movie on a flashback

1809
02:25:59,487 --> 02:26:02,206
creating the impression in the audience's mind

1810
02:26:02,327 --> 02:26:04,887
that the entire movie had been a fantasy

1811
02:26:05,007 --> 02:26:09,205
of the Robert de Niro character
sitting in an opium den in New York.

1812
02:26:09,327 --> 02:26:13,036
The Italian distributors were worried
that with a flashback of this length

1813
02:26:13,167 --> 02:26:16,398
in slow motion with this music
at the end of a movie

1814
02:26:16,527 --> 02:26:20,600
that the audience would get up and
walk out before the flashback finished

1815
02:26:20,727 --> 02:26:23,764
and miss the climax of the film so they cut it.

1816
02:26:23,887 --> 02:26:27,163
It's only recently been restored in Italian prints.

1817
02:26:27,287 --> 02:26:31,678
Part of it was there in international
release prints but not at this length.

1818
02:26:31,807 --> 02:26:36,517
The Sean theme by Morricone is about
to make way for another theme

1819
02:26:36,647 --> 02:26:39,241
for the final part of the flashback.

1820
02:27:03,407 --> 02:27:05,523
This is the point.

1821
02:27:05,647 --> 02:27:08,957
She kisses
the David Warbeck character as well.

1822
02:27:09,087 --> 02:27:14,207
So the bond between them
this triangle is very deep.

1823
02:27:16,167 --> 02:27:18,556
And Sean 's quite happy about that.

1824
02:27:34,327 --> 02:27:38,525
Out of focus. We're exiting the flashback.

1825
02:27:40,887 --> 02:27:44,277
Which has been shared by Juan
in some strange way.

1826
02:27:44,407 --> 02:27:48,241
We think he was imagining it too
but then there's a huge explosion

1827
02:27:48,367 --> 02:27:54,602
as that strange cigarette makes contact
with the dynamite inside Sean 's coat.

1828
02:27:55,647 --> 02:27:58,036
So he's blown himself up.

1829
02:28:30,847 --> 02:28:34,806
"What about me?" Duck You Sucker

1830
02:28:34,927 --> 02:28:39,284
So in the Italian version
Juan look s at the audience

1831
02:28:39,407 --> 02:28:41,398
and says "What about me?"

1832
02:28:41,527 --> 02:28:45,440
And up comes Gíú La Testa
keep your head down don 't get involved.

1833
02:28:45,567 --> 02:28:51,278
None of this would have happened
if you hadn 't got involved in the revolution.

1834
02:28:51,407 --> 02:28:54,399
You'd still have your family
your way of life intact.

1835
02:28:57,847 --> 02:29:00,156
What about me? Gíú La Testa

1836
02:29:00,287 --> 02:29:04,883
It's an extraordinary ending
addressed directly to the audience.

1837
02:29:06,807 --> 02:29:10,846
The next film that Leone made
would be an even darker film.

1838
02:29:10,967 --> 02:29:14,516
There's an increasing melancholy
about his films as he got older.

1839
02:29:14,647 --> 02:29:19,880
Just as this one is between the twilight
of the frontier and the dark night of the city

1840
02:29:20,007 --> 02:29:23,920
his final film Once Upon I Time
In America which came out in the 1980s

1841
02:29:24,047 --> 02:29:29,201
is about the gangster era of the 1920s
the '30s and the 1960s

1842
02:29:29,327 --> 02:29:32,399
and is a very dark film indeed.

1843
02:29:32,527 --> 02:29:38,397
It's really about two characters
who sleepwalk their way into oblivion.

1844
02:29:38,527 --> 02:29:43,760
It's surprising that Leone was only
in early middle age at this time

1845
02:29:43,887 --> 02:29:45,957
but he's having autumnal thoughts.

1846
02:29:46,087 --> 02:29:50,683
It's like the movie of an old man
looking back that kind of melancholia.

1847
02:29:50,807 --> 02:29:54,686
But he was still a relatively young man
born in 1928.

1848
02:29:54,807 --> 02:29:59,722
It's not like Visconti making
one of his autumnal films.

1849
02:29:59,847 --> 02:30:05,524
This is the film of a young man the
most mature film he'd made up to now.
