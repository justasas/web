1
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:20,082
(clap of thunder)

2
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,882
(man shouts at horses)

3
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:25,122
(stage coach driver) 'Andale caballo'

4
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:37,360
'Andale caballo'

5
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:44,878
(shouts in Spanish)

6
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,397
'Señor '

7
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:00,838
'Señor '

8
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:03,246
'Señor '

9
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:07,599
- Tighten up that girth.
- Señor I must go to San Felipe.

10
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:10,161
My mother is dead!

11
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,755
Straight down the road about 50 miles.

12
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:28,440
Yeah get outta here.

13
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,115
Hey. Hey amigo

14
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,364
Come here.

15
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,956
Perfect.

16
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:17,157
You're perfect!

17
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,360
I swear to God boys he's just right.

18
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:29,886
I'm gonna put you on that stage and
watch those faces when they see you come in!

19
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:53,522
(both laugh)

20
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:57,677
v ovo

21
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:50,877
- By God I...
- Never mind dear.

22
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:26,517
(tuts)

23
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,842
Over there.

24
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:46,242
Not that door the other one there.

25
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,801
Pull. Pull.

26
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:59,001
There you are. Now just sit down
and be quiet like a good little boy.

27
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:04,118
You see? He does understand.

28
00:08:04,247 --> 00:08:07,045
Who knows perhaps he can even talk.

29
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:11,683
Now now even the peasants...
A bit of mustard?

30
00:08:11,807 --> 00:08:15,436
Thank you.
Even the peasants are entitled to their rights.

31
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:18,718
After all they have won a revolution.

32
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:20,405
Or at least almost.

33
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:23,405
Animals that's what they are. Animals.

34
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:25,085
(burps)

35
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:28,040
Even animals can be tame and harmless.

36
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,965
Personally I consider them unfortunate brutes.

37
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:33,442
Yes brutes. Quite right.

38
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:35,603
Precisely my dear lady precisely.

39
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:40,084
I hate saying it
but you should hear them in the confessional.

40
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:44,644
- You would never imagine. Did you know...?
- I can imagine Father.

41
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:46,405
I can imagine.

42
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,758
Living in such promiscuity
all of them in one room

43
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:53,960
male and female together
lying in a heap like rats in a sewer.

44
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:58,524
At night when the lights are out
all their inibitions disappear.

45
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:05,120
You never know who is next:
mother sister daughter... goat.

46
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:07,283
Every country has its own plague.

47
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:15,124
- Just like them niggers we got back home.
- Just like animals. That's what they are.

48
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:18,876
Exactly. Which is why they're half-wits.

49
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,676
Hey you. Do you know who your father was?

50
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,281
Do you know how old you are?

51
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,517
He doesn 't know.

52
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:39,765
Do you know how many kids you have? Huh?

53
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:44,599
Do you know how many kids your mother had?

54
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:46,718
He doesn 't know anything.

55
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:50,840
It was to benefit scum like this
that the Agrarian Reform was imposed.

56
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:59,481
And that ass Madero wanted to give
the government and our land to idiots like this.

57
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:02,405
We are all pawns in the hands of Almighty God.

58
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:06,361
Fortunately Divine Providence
has disposed of that rash individual Madero.

59
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:09,604
My dear Monsignor let us be realistic.

60
00:10:09,727 --> 00:10:15,597
What you call Providence I call General Huerta.
He put the peasants in their place.

61
00:10:15,727 --> 00:10:19,800
Which is the best place for animals
because that's what they are.

62
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:24,366
Animals.

63
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:26,045
(voices echo) I can imagine.

64
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:31,639
- I can imagine living in such promiscuity...
...wanted to give the government and our land

65
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,280
to idiots like this!

66
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:36,479
- Goats.
- Animals.

67
00:10:36,607 --> 00:10:39,280
- Rats!
- Just like them niggers we got back home.

68
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:41,079
- Half-wits!
- Animals!

69
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:44,324
Divine Providence has disposed...

70
00:10:45,087 --> 00:10:47,043
Just like them niggers.

71
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,126
Animals. Because that's what they are. Animals.

72
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:52,839
...like them niggers.
- Brutes!

73
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:55,242
That's what they are animals.

74
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,800
- Like them niggers.
- Brutes!

75
00:10:56,927 --> 00:10:58,406
Animals!

76
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:00,961
- I consider them unfortunate brutes.
- I can imagine...

77
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:02,725
Niggers.

78
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,600
- Brutes!
- Niggers!

79
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:07,638
...like them niggers.
- Idiots!

80
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,359
- Niggers!
- Idiots!

81
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:12,240
...like them niggers.
- Idiots! Half-wits!

82
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:15,397
(driver) 'Anda caballo anda'

83
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,162
(driver) 'Anda caballo'

84
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:32,684
Hey you give us a hand and push.

85
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:41,801
Think they'd get off their asses to help us
the bastards? Hell no!

86
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:46,606
'Anda' 'Caballo huyo'

87
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:53,877
(driver shouts horses neigh)

88
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:03,438
Haaaahh!

89
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:19,878
(gasps)

90
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,845
(cockerel crows)

91
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:17,561
Take him away before he dirties everything.

92
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:22,715
Now ladies and gentlemen you will give
everything to my niños without any trouble.

93
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:25,441
- We kill them all OK Papá?
- (gunshot)

94
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:30,486
I've told you Chulo
no shooting unless Papá pulls the trigger.

95
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:43,636
Come.

96
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,758
Come come come come!

97
00:13:45,887 --> 00:13:48,765
(boys chatter in Spanish in background)

98
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:03,360
You wanted to know my family? That's my sons.

99
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:05,955
Each one of them from a different mother.

100
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,918
And now you kneel.

101
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,446
Kneel!

102
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,159
Kneel!

103
00:14:11,287 --> 00:14:13,676
'Papá'

104
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,601
This is my father. I think.

105
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:22,117
- Pleased to meet...
- Go inside before Chulo kills everyone.

106
00:14:23,127 --> 00:14:27,803
My mother had the blood of the Aztecs
which was before your people.

107
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:35,399
And now I ask you a question.

108
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,518
Can you make a baby?

109
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:40,761
Can you make a baby?

110
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:44,960
That's sad. But we will fix that.

111
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:49,926
'Señora'

112
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:52,720
(Adelita) Let me go! Let go.

113
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:07,876
Go on.

114
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:13,079
Go.

115
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,280
(cow moos)

116
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:32,238
(whistles)

117
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:39,682
- Go... go... go... go... go!
- (Adelita screams)

118
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:41,798
(gasps)

119
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,965
(cockerel crows)

120
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:44,523
Pretty good huh?

121
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:56,884
Oh Jesus help me I'm going to faint.

122
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:04,317
No no no no no.
You faint now and you miss the best part.

123
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:06,836
(chatter and laughter)

124
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,756
Juanito you get everything?

125
00:18:18,687 --> 00:18:20,757
You'll pay for this you bastard!

126
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:26,007
- I'm a citizen of the United States of America!
- You're an American son of a bitch.

127
00:18:26,127 --> 00:18:27,958
Understand Yankee?

128
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:49,318
(chuckles)

129
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,278
Thank you.

130
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:24,163
Thank you. For everything.

131
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,685
(all gasp)

132
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:32,275
(laughter)

133
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:25,758
(horses whinny)

134
00:21:30,487 --> 00:21:32,478
(all laugh)

135
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:10,437
Have you a light?

136
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:47,321
There is a hole in the roof.

137
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:56,319
Hey!

138
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:07,158
(gun barrels click)

139
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:17,522
- I wouldn 't do that if I were you.
- Why?

140
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:34,763
You pull that trigger and shoot me I fall.

141
00:24:46,287 --> 00:24:51,202
And if I fall they'll have to alter all the maps.

142
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:16,645
You see when I go
half this bloody country goes with me.

143
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:19,762
Including yourself.

144
00:25:48,127 --> 00:25:50,482
(laughs)

145
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:03,277
- You understand now?
- Ah sí sí sí sí sí sí I understand.

146
00:26:03,407 --> 00:26:05,238
'Sí

147
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:09,360
It's like a miracle of God.
You you are a great magician.

148
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:14,038
I stop your motorcycle
you do the magic with my coach. We are even.

149
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:16,237
- Even?
- Sí

150
00:26:21,127 --> 00:26:23,595
To fix my motorcycle would be even.

151
00:26:25,407 --> 00:26:27,841
I'll be inside.

152
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:36,243
Oh! We kill him now Papá?

153
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:39,598
No. First we fix the motorcycle. Shh!

154
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:57,365
- It's whisky.
- Thank God for that huh?

155
00:26:57,487 --> 00:27:00,559
Where are you going in this contraption?

156
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:03,326
Well... Where are you going?

157
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:07,926
- Shaver Mines.
- Oh-ho.

158
00:27:08,047 --> 00:27:10,800
Lucanina huh? I know that place.

159
00:27:10,927 --> 00:27:15,079
I know the man who owns it
that fat German son of a bitch!

160
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:19,644
That crazy tub of lard Mr Aschenbach
who wrings our people dry like slaves

161
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:22,406
even his personal servants.
One girl had an ass:

162
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:26,679
her cheek s were hard like drums.
I got her pregnant and he...

163
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:31,517
Oh Jesus Christ!
Will you shut up and go and fix my motorcycle?

164
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:35,878
OK.

165
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,485
OK.

166
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:42,206
Anything you say Firecracker.

167
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:47,918
(all shout at once)

168
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:53,120
(Juan) Take your hands off that. Now!

169
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:35,837
(laughs)

170
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:38,956
Well good for you Firecracker.

171
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:48,682
I don 't know why I named you Napoleon
when you have no imagination. This is a bank!

172
00:28:48,807 --> 00:28:52,402
- Mesa Verde
- Sí Papá Mesa Verde. Mesa Verde.

173
00:28:52,527 --> 00:28:57,157
If we can get this Firecracker to come with us
we will be rich.

174
00:28:57,287 --> 00:29:00,677
Where does he come in?
The dynamite's right here.

175
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:04,083
No no. You need an expert for that.

176
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:08,716
You only need matches and balls.
And I got those.

177
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,838
- ¿ Sí?
- 'Sí

178
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:18,638
See that tree over there?

179
00:29:39,887 --> 00:29:41,923
(explosion)

180
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:48,043
Short fuse.

181
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:12,606
Now you understand
why we need the firecracker?

182
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:15,158
Huh?

183
00:31:57,687 --> 00:32:02,886
- Where the hell are we?
- What kind of work you do for the German?

184
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:08,398
Listen I asked you a question.
What do you do for the German?

185
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:12,598
- I've been looking for silver for him.
- Silver?

186
00:32:12,727 --> 00:32:15,400
You know something? I don 't understand you.

187
00:32:15,527 --> 00:32:22,080
Why do you waste your time and your holy water
looking for silver? To me that's a sin.

188
00:32:25,007 --> 00:32:29,080
- Have you any better ideas?
- Sí Gold is better than silver.

189
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:31,596
There isn 't any gold in these hills.

190
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:33,877
(laughs) Yes there is.

191
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:36,157
In Mesa Verde.

192
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:46,680
Of course.
Whoever heard of having a bank in the country!

193
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:51,960
Uh-huh. A bank?

194
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:56,958
Not a bank. The bank.

195
00:32:58,087 --> 00:33:05,437
The most beautiful wonderful fantastic
gorgeous magnificent bank in the world.

196
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,161
When you stand before the bank

197
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:13,202
and you see it has the gates of gold
like it was the gates of heaven.

198
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:18,845
And when you go inside
everything everything is gold.

199
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:21,845
Gold spittoons gold handles. And money.

200
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:30,486
I know 'cause I saw when I was
eight years old. I went there with my father.

201
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:35,237
He tried to rob the bank. They caught him
but they won 't catch me. ¿ Eh Papá?

202
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,686
Right.

203
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,685
Listen Firecracker you listen to me.

204
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:45,481
Listen why don 't you come with me

205
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,121
and we will work together?

206
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,160
And we will become rich.

207
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:56,922
(laughs)

208
00:33:58,047 --> 00:34:00,163
What the hell is your name?

209
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:03,318
John.

210
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:05,438
What?

211
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:08,921
John.

212
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:14,885
- What is your name?
- John.

213
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:18,716
(Juan laughs) That's fantastic. That is incredible.

214
00:34:18,847 --> 00:34:22,237
My name is Juan and yours is John.
Juan and John.

215
00:34:22,367 --> 00:34:24,039
So what?

216
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:27,842
Can 't you understand that is that is the...

217
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:29,923
Oh...

218
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:31,958
Destiny.

219
00:36:05,087 --> 00:36:07,123
No. And I mean it.

220
00:36:07,247 --> 00:36:09,078
Why?

221
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:14,076
You want more money? I'll give you more
than half. I don 't care about the money.

222
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:16,880
As long as we can work together.

223
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:18,918
Listen what I'm telling you.

224
00:36:19,047 --> 00:36:20,639
We are like two brothers.

225
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:27,002
You make the holes with the holy water
and then I walk in and do the dirty work.

226
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:31,276
Listen it takes one bandito to know another.

227
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,158
(laughs)

228
00:36:52,487 --> 00:36:55,126
- So you can read?
- You don 't have to read.

229
00:36:55,247 --> 00:37:00,719
I see a man 's picture I see a price
I know that man is in trouble.

230
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:09,755
Hey what kind of trouble are you in?

231
00:37:14,727 --> 00:37:20,120
- Oh we fought a revolution in Ireland.
- A revolution?

232
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:23,637
Seems revolutions are all over the world
like the crops.

233
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:26,645
We had a revolution.
The brave people went in.

234
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:33,366
What it did to them was terrible. Pancho Villa
the world's best bandit chief two balls like a bull

235
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:38,356
he went in the revolution as a great bandit
came out as what? Nothing.

236
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:41,923
A general. That to me is the bullshit.

237
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:45,797
(begins to kick-start motorcycle)

238
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:50,637
Wait a minute.
You come here to join the revolution?

239
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:54,603
No no.

240
00:37:57,127 --> 00:37:58,845
One was enough for me.

241
00:37:58,967 --> 00:38:00,764
(motorcycle revs up)

242
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:07,437
Stop! You dirty...

243
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:10,320
...son of a bitch!

244
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:12,642
Gringo... bastard!

245
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:16,880
(gunshot)

246
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:18,679
(hissing)

247
00:38:18,807 --> 00:38:20,957
(squeaking)

248
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:02,685
Hey!

249
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:10,197
Duck, yo u sucko"

250
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:22,557
- Say which way is it to Lucanina?
- Fuck you! Go find it yourself!

251
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:28,236
Mexico is big
but for you it is going to be very big!

252
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:30,679
(Juan 's voice echoes)

253
00:42:18,447 --> 00:42:20,677
(distant laughter)

254
00:43:09,407 --> 00:43:12,797
(clatter of hooves horse whinnies)

255
00:43:15,407 --> 00:43:18,558
(Juan) John where are you? It's us!

256
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,081
Come on come on you.

257
00:43:30,847 --> 00:43:33,077
Come on in there.

258
00:43:33,207 --> 00:43:36,643
Just a little further inside.

259
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:40,237
That's right heathen bastards.

260
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:45,202
What's this?
You crazy? You talk to yourself now?

261
00:43:45,327 --> 00:43:49,161
Oh my friend didn 't I tell you Mexico was big?

262
00:43:52,887 --> 00:43:54,923
Oh shit.

263
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:57,644
Who are those people inside?

264
00:43:58,727 --> 00:44:02,197
You mean who were those people inside?

265
00:44:10,487 --> 00:44:14,082
(explosion resounds)

266
00:44:26,367 --> 00:44:29,643
Who were they? Who were those people inside?

267
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,405
(Juan) Chulo!

268
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:38,760
Who were those people for Christ's sake?

269
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:44,166
Well one of them was Aschenbach
then there was three soldiers and one captain.

270
00:44:44,287 --> 00:44:46,926
Everybody dead in there.

271
00:44:47,047 --> 00:44:50,722
Will you keep quiet
and go get our friend's equipment together?

272
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:57,724
Anyway when I went to Aschenbach
and I told him

273
00:44:57,847 --> 00:45:01,840
I said you wanted to see him
he wouldn 't believe that.

274
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:05,164
I said "That's too bad
because he's discovered silver."

275
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:07,243
Then he was ready to come running.

276
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:12,566
The other one the captain... I think the captain
and Aschenbach were working together.

277
00:45:12,687 --> 00:45:15,485
The captain says "I want to see the man."

278
00:45:15,607 --> 00:45:22,683
I said "How can you see him? He's blown off
his hand with dynamite he is bleeding to death."

279
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:27,005
When they heard that
they broke their asses to get here.

280
00:45:27,887 --> 00:45:32,278
Anyway it's no problem because
there are diamonds here no questions.

281
00:45:32,407 --> 00:45:36,605
Also you have no contract so... you are free.

282
00:45:36,727 --> 00:45:38,638
(Juan laughs)

283
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:41,918
There will be one little problem with the army.

284
00:45:42,047 --> 00:45:47,075
They will have a hot ass
when it comes to the death of a captain.

285
00:45:47,207 --> 00:45:50,995
But don 't worry.
I am your friend Juan and I will help.

286
00:45:51,127 --> 00:45:53,402
I will do anything say anything...

287
00:45:53,527 --> 00:45:58,840
No no no. I don 't need any help from you
to know I've been screwed.

288
00:46:00,527 --> 00:46:02,563
You fuckin ' chicken thief.

289
00:46:10,127 --> 00:46:12,482
What do you want with me?

290
00:46:15,407 --> 00:46:17,523
Nothing.

291
00:46:18,127 --> 00:46:20,960
I just thought that maybe...

292
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:25,606
...we could go to Mesa Verde.

293
00:46:28,647 --> 00:46:29,875
(chuckles)

294
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:34,400
The bank. Isn 't there anything else
you remember about Mesa Verde?

295
00:46:34,527 --> 00:46:38,645
Yes there's a place
where you can sit down and eat.

296
00:46:38,767 --> 00:46:41,600
- When you look in front you...
- See the bank.

297
00:46:41,727 --> 00:46:43,877
That's right. How do you know?

298
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:48,882
Listen Mesa Verde that's only the beginning.

299
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:55,640
Let me tell you it will be Juan and John
the two especialistas in bank s eh?

300
00:46:57,567 --> 00:47:01,082
We'll call it Johnny and Johnny.
That's more American.

301
00:47:01,207 --> 00:47:04,722
Amigo we go to America
there are bank s all over the place.

302
00:47:04,847 --> 00:47:08,317
In California Colorado
Kansas City Texas and Austin.

303
00:47:08,447 --> 00:47:13,237
You have to think of the big future
that we have ahead of us.

304
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:16,200
I'm thinking of the big train behind us.

305
00:47:16,327 --> 00:47:19,319
Hey! Out of the way!

306
00:47:19,447 --> 00:47:21,438
(horn blasts)

307
00:49:06,807 --> 00:49:09,162
(horn blasts)

308
00:50:01,887 --> 00:50:03,878
(train wheels screech)

309
00:50:31,607 --> 00:50:34,405
(train chuffs)

310
00:50:50,607 --> 00:50:53,121
Hey you.

311
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:56,595
I know that face.

312
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:59,801
Where have I seen you before?

313
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:30,718
(conductor) Stop right where you are!

314
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,718
Drop that knife you bastard.

315
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:44,442
(knife drops)

316
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:55,161
I have family.

317
00:52:08,407 --> 00:52:10,682
(laughs)

318
00:52:13,087 --> 00:52:15,078
I have a family too.

319
00:52:15,207 --> 00:52:16,686
(conductor screams)

320
00:52:49,847 --> 00:52:51,838
(train wheels screech)

321
00:53:22,087 --> 00:53:24,078
(train horn blasts)

322
00:53:28,607 --> 00:53:30,598
(hubbub of conversation)

323
00:54:06,407 --> 00:54:08,716
Beautiful eh?

324
00:54:14,647 --> 00:54:22,122
'Uno dos uno dos uno dos'
'Pelotón izquierda'

325
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:26,800
'Uno dos uno dos uno dos'

326
00:54:32,127 --> 00:54:34,482
'Uno dos uno dos uno dos'

327
00:54:37,247 --> 00:54:40,000
(officer shouts in Spanish)

328
00:55:07,647 --> 00:55:09,763
¿ Tienen algo qué pedir?

329
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:27,842
¿ Y tu?

330
00:55:43,167 --> 00:55:44,919
(shouts orders in Spanish)

331
00:55:47,807 --> 00:55:50,116
Listos

332
00:55:57,207 --> 00:55:59,163
(orders continue)

333
00:55:59,287 --> 00:56:00,606
'Armas'

334
00:56:06,887 --> 00:56:08,320
'Preparen '

335
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,438
(gun barrels click)

336
00:56:14,727 --> 00:56:16,718
Apunten

337
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:24,239
- 'Fuego'
- (gunshots)

338
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:34,158
(gunshot)

339
00:56:34,287 --> 00:56:37,677
Hey God you're sure this is Mesa Verde?

340
00:58:17,367 --> 00:58:20,245
Do you have your beans with chilli?

341
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:22,722
I don 't want nothing from you.

342
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:26,556
- Aw come on have some beans.
- Listen you son of a bitch!

343
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:30,680
You pull that trick on me again
I break your goddamn head!

344
00:58:32,287 --> 00:58:34,562
Well for Christ's sake.

345
00:58:35,767 --> 00:58:37,997
A train comes along and I take it.

346
00:58:38,127 --> 00:58:42,405
- Been waiting in your Mesa Verde ever since.
- It's not my Mesa Verde.

347
00:58:42,527 --> 00:58:47,476
- This place is covered with soldiers like flies.
- Just the way we like it.

348
00:58:48,087 --> 00:58:50,806
Just the way we like it?

349
00:58:53,727 --> 00:58:57,959
If it's a revolution... it's confusion.

350
00:58:58,087 --> 00:59:00,078
(mouths silently)

351
00:59:41,887 --> 00:59:44,720
What are you talking about?
Revolution confusion?

352
00:59:47,607 --> 00:59:50,644
Where there's confusion
a man who knows what he wants...

353
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:55,204
...stands a good chance of getting it.
- I don 't understand you.

354
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:05,080
This him?

355
01:00:09,687 --> 01:00:11,678
That's him.

356
01:00:16,567 --> 01:00:18,523
Him who?

357
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:20,842
- Do you trust me?
- No.

358
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:24,084
- You want to get inside there?
- Sí

359
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:29,122
Well I'm going to see to it
you have that chance. Come on.

360
01:00:40,247 --> 01:00:42,238
(man groans)

361
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:48,124
(man shrieks)

362
01:00:48,247 --> 01:00:51,364
(doctor) Don 't move goddamn it!
Hold him still.

363
01:00:57,567 --> 01:00:59,558
(man shrieks)

364
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:08,359
(man gasps and groans)

365
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:19,647
(man screams)

366
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:27,281
That does it. Relax now. Relax.

367
01:01:28,967 --> 01:01:30,559
It's all over.

368
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:37,125
If you'd let this infection go any longer
your widow would be paying my bill.

369
01:01:39,047 --> 01:01:41,038
(old man coughs)

370
01:01:43,727 --> 01:01:45,319
Mallory!

371
01:01:46,127 --> 01:01:49,005
You've hardly joined us here in Mesa Verde.

372
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:52,486
Already you're front-page news.

373
01:01:54,727 --> 01:01:56,843
"Irish dynamiter wanted for murder."

374
01:02:03,247 --> 01:02:06,125
You have a real talent for making friends.

375
01:02:06,247 --> 01:02:10,206
(chuckles) You've stirred up a hornet's nest.

376
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:14,363
I'll grant you the captain but...

377
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:19,117
...till now nobody dared
take a crack at foreign capitalists.

378
01:02:20,247 --> 01:02:22,442
Not even Pancho Villa.

379
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:28,447
It seems even His Majesty's Secret Service
would like to get their hands on you.

380
01:02:29,567 --> 01:02:32,957
And yet you are an asset to us.

381
01:02:33,607 --> 01:02:37,202
Even if sometimes you do drink a bit too much.

382
01:02:37,327 --> 01:02:39,477
Who says I drink too much?

383
01:02:40,887 --> 01:02:42,479
Your liver does.

384
01:02:42,607 --> 01:02:45,041
What about that one him?

385
01:02:46,087 --> 01:02:47,964
He's all right.

386
01:02:48,087 --> 01:02:51,284
Except that when operating
he cuts deeper than I do.

387
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:56,758
What the doctor means is
one time we did a little work together.

388
01:02:57,767 --> 01:03:00,042
And now to our work friends.

389
01:03:02,127 --> 01:03:04,118
I have good news.

390
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:09,799
In two days Villa and Zapata
will attack simultaneously from north and south.

391
01:03:09,927 --> 01:03:11,997
(man coughs)

392
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:16,917
We here like those in other cities
must begin parallel actions of harassment.

393
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:20,005
Pereto's downfall is just a question of week s.

394
01:03:21,127 --> 01:03:25,678
Whereas Miguel's is only a question of hours
if he doesn 't stop smoking.

395
01:03:25,807 --> 01:03:28,196
Easy to say.

396
01:03:29,087 --> 01:03:36,084
We'll attack in four places at the same time.
Antonio you hit the city hall and old prisons.

397
01:03:36,207 --> 01:03:41,486
You will need to divide into two groups
one of them under the command of José.

398
01:03:41,607 --> 01:03:46,203
Jesús the railway station
and the marshalling yards as planned right?

399
01:03:46,327 --> 01:03:50,639
Get in position in good time in small groups
so you won 't attract attention.

400
01:03:50,767 --> 01:03:54,043
And act like ordinary travellers
or railroad employees.

401
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:59,321
You Manolo together with Juanito will attack
the army barrack s with our main forces agreed?

402
01:04:00,327 --> 01:04:06,675
This is their point of maximum concentration
and is the key to the success of our plan.

403
01:04:06,807 --> 01:04:10,197
You must create
the impression of a massive attack.

404
01:04:10,327 --> 01:04:13,842
And if necessary
be prepared to make the final sacrifice.

405
01:04:14,727 --> 01:04:18,402
The fourth and last target
Ortega the post office.

406
01:04:19,887 --> 01:04:23,596
When the enemy is busy on four fronts

407
01:04:23,727 --> 01:04:26,161
we'll move against our real objective.

408
01:04:27,087 --> 01:04:29,396
Do we still agree?

409
01:04:31,447 --> 01:04:35,486
- You'll need men.
- I only need one man.

410
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:39,238
One?

411
01:04:39,367 --> 01:04:41,323
Sí

412
01:04:42,327 --> 01:04:43,965
Him?

413
01:04:45,647 --> 01:04:47,683
Him? Him?

414
01:04:47,807 --> 01:04:53,279
What is with this "him"? Him who? Who him?
To do what? That's what I want to know!

415
01:04:53,407 --> 01:04:55,921
To attack the bank.

416
01:04:57,487 --> 01:05:00,126
The bank?

417
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:02,886
We will take care of the bank.

418
01:05:03,007 --> 01:05:06,317
That's why we're here
so don 't worry about that.

419
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:10,916
Well then what can I say?

420
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:14,758
Except... I hope you make it.

421
01:05:15,967 --> 01:05:18,003
Me too. And him.

422
01:05:19,567 --> 01:05:24,357
Well we'll meet again tonight to discuss details.
I have to go now.

423
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:29,766
I left a woman in labour
and she can 't wait till the revolution is over.

424
01:05:29,887 --> 01:05:31,605
(all laugh)

425
01:05:32,447 --> 01:05:36,042
- Tierra y libertad
- (all) 'Tierra y libertad'

426
01:05:36,647 --> 01:05:40,606
Leave one at a time and keep out of sight.

427
01:05:40,727 --> 01:05:42,763
Speaking of sight how's your cataract?

428
01:05:42,887 --> 01:05:46,163
At least I have a good eye. With the other...

429
01:05:46,287 --> 01:05:49,279
Shh! You don 't have to say anything.

430
01:05:51,127 --> 01:05:53,516
I understand everything.

431
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:56,675
'Tierra y libertad'

432
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:59,837
Y libertad

433
01:07:17,807 --> 01:07:19,798
(rapid gunfire)

434
01:07:20,807 --> 01:07:22,718
(shouting)

435
01:07:24,327 --> 01:07:26,887
'Capitán ' 'Aviselas Capitán '

436
01:07:27,567 --> 01:07:29,876
'Pronto' 'Hola muénvase'

437
01:07:31,367 --> 01:07:33,881
(gunfire continues)

438
01:07:50,607 --> 01:07:52,916
Go.

439
01:07:53,647 --> 01:07:56,241
Psst psst! 'Oye'

440
01:07:58,087 --> 01:08:00,317
(gunfire and explosions)

441
01:08:01,607 --> 01:08:03,598
Bravo Chulo.

442
01:08:07,127 --> 01:08:09,357
Take it take it.

443
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:13,518
(gunfire explosions shouting in Spanish)

444
01:08:21,287 --> 01:08:26,077
There must be a lot of money in the bank
look at all those soldiers.

445
01:08:31,727 --> 01:08:36,039
- You know how this work s?
- Sí It's a...

446
01:08:37,047 --> 01:08:39,038
...short fuse.

447
01:08:40,047 --> 01:08:42,038
- No.
- No?

448
01:08:43,047 --> 01:08:44,878
Normal rate.

449
01:08:45,007 --> 01:08:46,804
30 seconds.

450
01:08:47,847 --> 01:08:50,725
Sí 30 seconds.

451
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:34,598
(man shrieks)

452
01:09:52,487 --> 01:09:56,400
- What did you find?
- Nothing but scrap paper.

453
01:09:59,687 --> 01:10:02,918
Wait a minute. Hey it's pointing down there.

454
01:10:03,047 --> 01:10:05,766
(gunshot)

455
01:10:18,407 --> 01:10:19,840
Psst!

456
01:11:27,927 --> 01:11:29,918
(gunshot resounds)

457
01:11:43,207 --> 01:11:45,277
(gunshot)

458
01:11:56,247 --> 01:11:57,805
(gunshot)

459
01:11:58,807 --> 01:12:00,365
(gunshot)

460
01:12:35,007 --> 01:12:36,998
There is the safe!

461
01:13:02,767 --> 01:13:04,758
Duck, yo u sucko 's

462
01:13:43,007 --> 01:13:48,286
- Where are you going for Christ's sake?
- I don 't know but something's wrong.

463
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:52,161
I went into the bank.
There's no money there nothing.

464
01:13:52,287 --> 01:13:56,360
The bank and the money were transferred
to Mexico City a month ago.

465
01:13:56,487 --> 01:14:00,366
They've been using this place
for a political prison ever since.

466
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:02,564
(laughs)

467
01:14:02,687 --> 01:14:06,646
- What? A political prison?
- I never said a thing about money.

468
01:14:06,767 --> 01:14:10,077
All I asked was if you wanted to get inside.

469
01:14:10,207 --> 01:14:13,677
But this bank is my life this is my dream.

470
01:14:13,807 --> 01:14:21,441
The reality is you've just liberated 150 patriots
through sheer courage in the face of danger.

471
01:14:23,447 --> 01:14:25,756
(laughs)

472
01:14:25,887 --> 01:14:27,878
(crowds shout in distance)

473
01:14:28,807 --> 01:14:31,082
Ah yes...

474
01:14:33,367 --> 01:14:36,518
...you're a grand hero of the revolution now.

475
01:14:37,847 --> 01:14:41,840
- ¡ Vivela Juan!
- I don 't want to be a hero. I want the money!

476
01:14:41,967 --> 01:14:43,605
The money!

477
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:48,122
- You taught me one thing.
- What?

478
01:14:48,887 --> 01:14:51,276
How to get fucked!

479
01:15:56,487 --> 01:15:58,478
(man sings softly)

480
01:16:14,767 --> 01:16:18,043
- What's that?
- It's a map.

481
01:16:21,087 --> 01:16:23,806
It's your country you're lying all over.

482
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:29,643
Not my country.
My country is me and my family.

483
01:16:29,767 --> 01:16:32,327
Well your country's also Huerta...

484
01:16:33,127 --> 01:16:35,322
...and the Governor and landlords.

485
01:16:36,087 --> 01:16:38,521
And Gunther Ruiz and his locusts.

486
01:16:39,527 --> 01:16:42,121
- This little revolution we're having here.
- Revolution?

487
01:16:42,247 --> 01:16:47,321
Please don 't try to tell me about revolution!
I know how revolutions start.

488
01:16:47,447 --> 01:16:51,565
People that read book s
go to people that don 't read book s and say

489
01:16:51,687 --> 01:16:53,837
- "The time has come for change."
- Shh!

490
01:16:53,967 --> 01:16:56,606
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shit shush!

491
01:16:56,727 --> 01:17:01,164
I know what I'm talking about
when I'm talking about revolutions!

492
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:06,486
The people who read book s go to the people
who can 't read and say "We need change"

493
01:17:06,607 --> 01:17:08,757
so the poor people make the change.

494
01:17:08,887 --> 01:17:14,484
The people who read the book s sit around
big polished tables and talk and talk and eat.

495
01:17:14,607 --> 01:17:17,519
But what has happened to the poor people?

496
01:17:18,327 --> 01:17:20,522
They are dead!

497
01:17:22,527 --> 01:17:24,518
That's your revolution.

498
01:17:31,287 --> 01:17:33,164
Shh.

499
01:17:33,287 --> 01:17:37,405
So please don 't tell me about revolutions.

500
01:17:48,127 --> 01:17:51,483
Then what happens?
The same fucking thing starts all over again!

501
01:18:31,687 --> 01:18:34,042
'Capitán '

502
01:18:47,887 --> 01:18:50,242
'Vamos'

503
01:19:00,247 --> 01:19:02,238
(sighs)

504
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:06,523
I don 't like it either.

505
01:19:06,647 --> 01:19:12,483
Only Gunther Ruiz is less than 20 miles
from here on the road that leads to that bridge.

506
01:19:12,607 --> 01:19:15,519
They will comb the area bush by bush.

507
01:19:15,647 --> 01:19:19,799
So the order is to pull back
hide in the San Ysidro caves.

508
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:21,918
Oh that's a brilliant order.

509
01:19:24,047 --> 01:19:25,958
Here we are facing it.

510
01:19:26,967 --> 01:19:31,518
You and the rest of you dreamers
want to piss it up against the wall!

511
01:19:31,647 --> 01:19:33,956
Not everybody can fight.

512
01:19:34,087 --> 01:19:36,396
There are those who must organise
co-ordinate.

513
01:19:36,527 --> 01:19:38,518
Yes yes of course.

514
01:19:41,047 --> 01:19:43,242
Yeah well...

515
01:19:43,367 --> 01:19:45,358
...don 't pay any attention to me.

516
01:19:46,527 --> 01:19:49,121
It's personal.

517
01:19:59,287 --> 01:20:01,960
Sorry about those orders. I'm staying.

518
01:20:03,607 --> 01:20:06,167
I don 't give a fuck about your revolutions.

519
01:20:06,287 --> 01:20:11,315
I'm tired of running up and down these
mountains and getting nowhere so I've stopped.

520
01:20:11,447 --> 01:20:14,598
Right here at the bridge of San Jorge.

521
01:20:17,207 --> 01:20:21,598
Maybe it's out of spite for you
and your slow dream or maybe...

522
01:20:23,447 --> 01:20:25,881
Ah maybe my feet are sore.

523
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:48,838
'Hombres' Me and irlandés are gonna catch
ourselves a couple of fucking locusts.

524
01:20:48,967 --> 01:20:50,161
(commotion)

525
01:20:50,287 --> 01:20:53,757
'Atente' You go back and hide in the grotto.

526
01:20:53,887 --> 01:20:57,766
If things go bad here every man for himself.

527
01:20:57,887 --> 01:21:00,640
You move your asses! ¿ Comprenden?

528
01:21:02,367 --> 01:21:04,119
(men shout)

529
01:21:31,207 --> 01:21:36,281
If something happens
and your father doesn 't come back

530
01:21:36,407 --> 01:21:40,719
then I pray that the great God in heaven
takes care of you.

531
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:08,162
Well... Good luck.

532
01:22:08,287 --> 01:22:09,879
Thank you.

533
01:22:30,047 --> 01:22:32,163
(men shout)

534
01:22:32,287 --> 01:22:37,281
Listen when they are out of sight
we will make a run for it. ¿ SÍ?

535
01:22:44,647 --> 01:22:50,404
No? You can 't mean to stay here? All those
explosions must have gone to your head!

536
01:22:54,087 --> 01:22:57,602
Remember John and Juan?

537
01:22:59,047 --> 01:23:00,765
America.

538
01:23:01,687 --> 01:23:03,484
The millions.

539
01:23:06,527 --> 01:23:08,040
No.

540
01:23:09,047 --> 01:23:12,926
I don 't understand!
Wasn 't that was a trick for us to get out?

541
01:23:13,047 --> 01:23:17,802
- What can we do against those locusts?
- You'd be doing me a favour if you'd leave.

542
01:23:17,927 --> 01:23:23,763
If I had a choice between a chicken thief
and ridding the world of a few uniforms

543
01:23:23,887 --> 01:23:26,082
I'd not choose the chicken thief.

544
01:23:28,727 --> 01:23:30,240
OK.

545
01:23:33,447 --> 01:23:35,244
OK.

546
01:23:36,487 --> 01:23:38,125
No!

547
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:40,283
(laughs)

548
01:23:40,407 --> 01:23:43,763
Oh no no. You will like that huh?

549
01:23:44,527 --> 01:23:51,160
Well you listen to me you Irish piece of shit!

550
01:23:51,807 --> 01:23:56,517
You think you're the only man
with the balls to stay? You are wrong!

551
01:23:56,647 --> 01:24:00,003
I have the balls and I stay.

552
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:23,003
He says there's no danger
just watch the bridge from a long way.

553
01:24:24,167 --> 01:24:29,002
No matter how I look with them
I'm still too close to the bridge.

554
01:24:30,007 --> 01:24:33,124
Why am I mixed up in this revolution anyway?

555
01:24:33,247 --> 01:24:39,083
God why didn 't you strike me down
instead of letting me say "I stay too"?

556
01:24:40,007 --> 01:24:43,682
Oh look at him! All because of him.

557
01:24:43,807 --> 01:24:46,560
He acts like a tourist only he's staying.

558
01:24:46,687 --> 01:24:49,076
(laughs) Look at him.

559
01:24:49,207 --> 01:24:51,801
What the hell does he care?

560
01:24:51,927 --> 01:24:54,282
He is having fun.

561
01:24:54,407 --> 01:24:58,764
I'm glad he's having fun God
because I am not having fun.

562
01:24:58,887 --> 01:25:00,923
Oh-ho no.

563
01:25:04,527 --> 01:25:05,721
Hey...

564
01:25:07,047 --> 01:25:09,322
What's this?

565
01:25:13,807 --> 01:25:16,002
Now he goes to sleep huh?

566
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:19,997
Go ahead you sleep sleep.

567
01:25:20,767 --> 01:25:24,601
I tell you something when he's asleep I'll go.
Shh!

568
01:25:41,047 --> 01:25:43,038
(laughs)

569
01:26:15,287 --> 01:26:17,357
Stop over there Sergeant.

570
01:26:45,127 --> 01:26:46,924
Hey!

571
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:54,601
God only an idiot could sleep at a time like this!

572
01:26:58,767 --> 01:27:00,325
Hey!

573
01:27:12,407 --> 01:27:15,240
(clatter of hooves)

574
01:27:57,647 --> 01:27:59,638
(clicks)

575
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,518
(gun rattles)

576
01:28:30,767 --> 01:28:34,646
Abandon the truck s!
Break rank s and take cover under the bridge!

577
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:37,759
Artillery fire. The bridge!

578
01:28:37,887 --> 01:28:39,764
(gunfire continues)

579
01:28:57,487 --> 01:28:59,921

580
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:35,358
(gunfire ceases)

581
01:33:45,607 --> 01:33:47,802
All of them.

582
01:33:50,007 --> 01:33:52,282
Six.

583
01:33:55,647 --> 01:33:59,003
I've never counted them before.

584
01:35:40,447 --> 01:35:42,722
No Juan no.

585
01:35:42,847 --> 01:35:46,283
No for Christ's sake.
They're waiting for you out there.

586
01:36:32,887 --> 01:36:35,162
(rapid gunfire)

587
01:37:00,087 --> 01:37:02,078
(gunfire continues)

588
01:37:29,807 --> 01:37:31,798

589
01:37:34,087 --> 01:37:36,396
(gunfire recommences)

590
01:37:37,647 --> 01:37:39,877

595
01:38:33,447 --> 01:38:37,076
(man) Hold it!
Move that bastard out of the truck.

596
01:38:37,207 --> 01:38:40,085
(man) See that he gets to the camp alive!

597
01:38:40,207 --> 01:38:42,323
(truck moves away)

598
01:39:32,887 --> 01:39:35,162

'Posición de tiro'

606

607

616
01:47:02,407 --> 01:47:04,762

617
01:47:09,647 --> 01:47:11,956

'Apunten '

621
01:47:25,047 --> 01:47:27,038

622
01:47:56,647 --> 01:47:59,366

(gunshots)

632
01:52:30,767 --> 01:52:33,201
But for the rich you sing.

633
01:52:46,767 --> 01:52:48,997
Oh Jesus Juan.

634
01:52:50,007 --> 01:52:51,998
(John laughs)

635
01:52:54,127 --> 01:52:59,326
Anyway if they ever get this thing under way
you might be able to...

636
01:52:59,447 --> 01:53:04,726
...might be make the border by what
some time tonight don 't you think?

637
01:53:08,727 --> 01:53:12,766
America. It's America Juan!

638
01:53:13,727 --> 01:53:17,800
Oh Jesus if it's as great as they say it is

639
01:53:17,927 --> 01:53:20,236
filled bags stuffed full of dreams...

640
01:53:20,367 --> 01:53:22,244
Juan?

641
01:53:26,527 --> 01:53:29,087
Oh Jesus.

642
01:53:32,247 --> 01:53:34,681
Jesus Juan.

643
01:53:36,807 --> 01:53:40,277
What is it Juan and... John?

644
01:53:42,007 --> 01:53:44,726
Johnny and Johnny?

645
01:53:44,847 --> 01:53:49,045
I make the holes and you get in. 50-50 right?

646
01:53:49,167 --> 01:53:51,158

(siren blasts)

650
01:55:10,007 --> 01:55:11,963
What's happening?

651
01:55:12,647 --> 01:55:15,639
Oh they're just moving the train around.

652
01:55:16,327 --> 01:55:18,636
Seems we'll be leaving shortly.

653
01:55:20,087 --> 01:55:23,159
The uniforms have loaded the last of their shit.

654
01:55:23,767 --> 01:55:25,439
(whistle blows)

655
01:55:38,247 --> 01:55:40,283
(train whistle blows)

656
01:55:47,047 --> 01:55:49,038
(squawks)

657
01:56:15,887 --> 01:56:18,037
(squawking persists)

658
01:56:28,327 --> 01:56:30,318
(chicken clucks softly)

659
01:56:37,367 --> 01:56:39,358
(squawking recommences)

660
01:56:41,367 --> 01:56:43,562
(intense squawk)

661
01:56:43,687 --> 01:56:45,678
(silence)

662
01:56:53,407 --> 01:56:55,398
(train whistle blows)

663
01:57:05,247 --> 01:57:07,238
(crashing)

664
01:57:18,327 --> 01:57:20,443
(rapid gunfire)

665
01:58:15,087 --> 01:58:17,726
Get out of the way.

666
01:58:26,207 --> 01:58:29,483
What do you want from me you scum?

667
01:58:29,607 --> 01:58:31,404
Let me by.

668
01:58:59,927 --> 01:59:01,963
(gunfire continues outside)

669
01:59:24,127 --> 01:59:27,802
(noise of gunfire intensifies)

670
02:00:16,087 --> 02:00:18,282
It's yours.

671
02:00:21,687 --> 02:00:24,599
There's a fortune inside.

672
02:00:29,287 --> 02:00:31,164
...pearls.

673
02:02:14,007 --> 02:02:16,475
(man shouts) 'Jóvenes a México'

674
02:02:43,367 --> 02:02:47,246
Well this will not be going to America.

675
02:02:47,367 --> 02:02:50,325
(Juan) Maybe the train won 't but we will.

676
02:03:03,047 --> 02:03:05,163
Hey...

677
02:03:06,967 --> 02:03:09,003
Which way is America?

678
02:03:13,487 --> 02:03:18,117
Well it's sure as hell not that way.
That's the way.

679
02:03:22,047 --> 02:03:24,436
Well then...

680
02:03:30,327 --> 02:03:32,318
...let's go.

681
02:03:33,407 --> 02:03:35,398
(both laugh)

682
02:03:41,887 --> 02:03:43,878
(cheering)

683
02:03:49,527 --> 02:03:52,360
Even Pancho Villa's heard much about you.

684
02:03:52,487 --> 02:03:56,002
He's always saying
"I want to meet this Miranda."

685
02:03:59,927 --> 02:04:01,918
Me?

686
02:04:03,127 --> 02:04:05,322
That's right.

687
02:04:05,447 --> 02:04:09,281
The military junta commander
told us everything that you've done.

688
02:04:09,407 --> 02:04:12,877
Whatever you heard I assure you
they were only words.

689
02:04:13,887 --> 02:04:18,039
Words cannot describe
what Juan has done and suffered for the cause.

690
02:04:18,167 --> 02:04:19,964
(Juan laughs)

691
02:04:20,607 --> 02:04:22,962
Hey doctor.

692
02:04:24,567 --> 02:04:26,842
How you been eh?

693
02:04:27,567 --> 02:04:30,843
This is a man who should talk to Villa.

694
02:04:32,167 --> 02:04:34,635
Hey.

695
02:04:37,127 --> 02:04:39,118
John.

696
02:04:48,327 --> 02:04:50,636
We thought we'd lost you doctor.

697
02:04:53,447 --> 02:04:55,722
(wheels screech)

698
02:05:03,887 --> 02:05:05,878
(crashing)

699
02:05:07,447 --> 02:05:09,722
Have you got a light?

700
02:05:13,647 --> 02:05:18,482
Listen Gunther Ruiz is after us
and Villa wants to talk to me.

701
02:05:18,607 --> 02:05:20,882
We should get outta here.

702
02:05:22,047 --> 02:05:28,122
Jesus Juan you can 't leave now.
You're a glorious hero of the revolution.

703
02:05:28,247 --> 02:05:29,919
Can I tell you something?

704
02:05:30,047 --> 02:05:32,038
Fuck you!

705
02:05:37,087 --> 02:05:39,362
That's all.

706
02:05:52,487 --> 02:05:57,607
A military train carrying over 1000 soldiers and
heavy weapons is heading straight towards us.

707
02:05:57,727 --> 02:06:00,241
What about Villa's troops?

708
02:06:00,367 --> 02:06:05,395
He met resistance in the Sierra
and ask s us to hold out for 24 hours.

709
02:06:14,127 --> 02:06:17,039
- Where the hell are we?
- Approximately here.

710
02:06:18,487 --> 02:06:21,285
Ah it's a beautiful desert there.

711
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:24,126
Not a stream or a canyon in 100 miles.

712
02:06:24,247 --> 02:06:29,082
- How long you think it'll take them to get here?
- Three hours more or less.

713
02:06:29,207 --> 02:06:31,118
Three hours.

714
02:06:43,607 --> 02:06:48,556
Well it look s as though
we'll have to stop 'em right here doesn 't it?

715
02:06:50,127 --> 02:06:53,517
All that takes
is unbolting a couple of yards of track.

716
02:06:53,647 --> 02:06:56,764
But then what? They'd still slaughter us.

717
02:06:56,887 --> 02:06:58,206
Wait.

718
02:06:58,327 --> 02:07:01,319
There's more than one way to stop a train.

719
02:07:02,807 --> 02:07:06,356
- How much dynamite have we?
- Maybe 200 Ibs.

720
02:07:06,487 --> 02:07:08,842
Is that enough for you?

721
02:07:10,127 --> 02:07:13,039
Oh yes. It'll have to do all right.

722
02:07:13,727 --> 02:07:18,517
- But I also need a locomotive and a man.
- Sí sí sí OK.

723
02:07:20,527 --> 02:07:22,199
OK.

724
02:07:22,327 --> 02:07:28,197
- Someone who's brave and loyal to the cause.
- Never mind that. What do I have to do?

725
02:07:30,127 --> 02:07:32,038
Someone like Dr Villega.

726
02:07:38,607 --> 02:07:41,201
Well...

727
02:07:42,367 --> 02:07:46,838
- I... I'm honoured.
- (John) I don 't doubt it doctor.

728
02:07:47,807 --> 02:07:52,119
Also because an old friend of ours
is in command of that train.

729
02:07:52,247 --> 02:07:54,283
A Colonel Gunther Ruiz.

730
02:08:02,447 --> 02:08:05,007
(train whistle blows)

731
02:09:01,287 --> 02:09:05,724
(John) Let's get shovelling man.
We'll never get up enough pressure that way.

732
02:09:19,367 --> 02:09:22,564
Come on put your back in it Villega.

733
02:09:30,927 --> 02:09:35,443
Let's stop pretending right away.
You know everything don 't you?

734
02:09:35,567 --> 02:09:40,163
- You sensed it or guessed it.
- Simpler than that Villega.

735
02:09:40,287 --> 02:09:43,962
I saw you that night in the rain.

736
02:09:53,927 --> 02:09:58,079
I see.
You've already judged and condemned me.

737
02:10:07,847 --> 02:10:11,681
That's why you brought me with you. To kill me.

738
02:10:12,727 --> 02:10:16,481
It's easy to judge. Have you ever been tortured?

739
02:10:16,607 --> 02:10:21,283
Are you sure you wouldn 't talk?
I was sure. And yet I talked.

740
02:10:22,527 --> 02:10:27,282
Some men died because of me.
What should I do? Kill myself? Why?

741
02:10:27,407 --> 02:10:30,365
The dead remain dead but I have not changed.

742
02:10:30,487 --> 02:10:35,003
I still believe in the same things.
I can still serve the cause.

743
02:10:35,127 --> 02:10:38,119
Shut up Villega! Shut up for Christ's sake.

744
02:12:43,447 --> 02:12:49,602
When I started using dynamite
I believed in many things. All of it!

745
02:12:51,327 --> 02:12:53,682
Finally I believe only in dynamite.

746
02:12:54,687 --> 02:12:56,678
I don 't judge you Villega.

747
02:12:59,287 --> 02:13:02,438
I did that only once in my life.

748
02:13:03,687 --> 02:13:05,917
Get shovelling!

749
02:14:38,287 --> 02:14:41,040
(John) The end of the line Villega.

750
02:14:43,647 --> 02:14:45,922
And I can 't help you now.

751
02:15:00,287 --> 02:15:03,199
Just close your eyes and jump.

752
02:15:30,487 --> 02:15:33,160
'Dios mío frena'

753
02:15:33,287 --> 02:15:35,642
(screechging)

754
02:15:36,487 --> 02:15:38,478
(whistle blows)

755
02:17:19,927 --> 02:17:21,918
(gunfire and explosions)

756
02:17:52,807 --> 02:17:54,798
(explosion)

757
02:18:38,567 --> 02:18:40,558
(gunfire continues)

758
02:19:06,927 --> 02:19:08,918
(piercing gunshot)

759
02:19:10,687 --> 02:19:12,405
(second gunshot)

760
02:19:13,127 --> 02:19:15,004
Oh shit...

761
02:19:18,367 --> 02:19:20,323
God...

762
02:20:00,047 --> 02:20:01,560
(groans)

763
02:20:36,767 --> 02:20:38,723
Hey.

764
02:20:38,847 --> 02:20:42,123
Man remember huh?

765
02:20:44,047 --> 02:20:46,686
You remember what you told me huh?

766
02:20:47,327 --> 02:20:50,000
You told me about America.

767
02:20:50,687 --> 02:20:54,885
And the bank s and the gold.

768
02:20:55,007 --> 02:20:58,477
Like you told me on the train remember?

769
02:21:02,687 --> 02:21:04,837
Hey hey.

770
02:21:06,207 --> 02:21:08,482
Hey.

771
02:21:08,607 --> 02:21:09,756
(Juan laughs)

772
02:21:09,887 --> 02:21:15,484
No you son of a bitch. Come on
you son of a bitch. You know you told me that.

773
02:21:15,607 --> 02:21:19,839
You leave me now
what the fuck is gonna happen to me?

774
02:21:22,127 --> 02:21:26,917
- You'll make it General.
- Oh shit I don 't want to be a general.

775
02:21:32,927 --> 02:21:35,236
Come on talk to me.

776
02:21:35,367 --> 02:21:37,085
Keep talking.

777
02:21:37,207 --> 02:21:41,120
Talk. Tell me about Villega Villega.
Remember Villega?

778
02:21:41,247 --> 02:21:43,522
- Villega?
- Sí

779
02:21:44,487 --> 02:21:46,876
He died.

780
02:21:48,247 --> 02:21:51,478
He died a great...

781
02:21:52,527 --> 02:21:56,236
...grand glorious hero of the revolution.

782
02:22:00,087 --> 02:22:02,078
(John laughs)

783
02:22:14,887 --> 02:22:16,764
OK.

784
02:22:17,567 --> 02:22:22,436
Easy easy. I'll go I'll get help huh?

785
02:22:28,567 --> 02:22:30,285
General?

786
02:22:36,167 --> 02:22:38,158
- Have you a light?
- Sí

787
02:23:15,567 --> 02:23:17,922
Oh my friend...

788
02:23:19,167 --> 02:23:22,284
...I'd hate to give you a royal screwing.

789
02:23:48,927 --> 02:23:50,918
I go get help.

790
02:23:56,687 --> 02:23:58,678
(gunfire continues)

791
02:27:40,527 --> 02:27:43,087
Johnny!

792
02:28:28,807 --> 02:28:31,116
(thinks) What about me?
