1
00:00:00,927 --> 00:00:04,761
My name's Christopher Frayling.
l wrote the book Spaghetti Westerns,

2
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:07,964
and then l wrote this large
biography of Sergio Leone,

3
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:11,676
and l'm going to talk you
through Fistful of Dollars.

4
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:18,400
The credit titles for Fistful of Dollars
were designed by Luigi Lardani, in Rome,

5
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:21,559
and signalled this was to be
a different kind of Western.

6
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,878
They were half-based
on the James Bond credit titles,

7
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:27,845
with the idea of Rotoscoping,
and semi-animation,

8
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,122
and Andy Warhol-type colours.

9
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:33,165
With a noisy soundtrack.
That was the first new thing.

10
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:38,162
The second was, of course, the title track
of the music, by Ennio Morricone.

11
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,284
You have sounds of gunfire,
and bells, and whip cracks,

12
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:43,403
and incomprehensible lyrics.

13
00:00:43,487 --> 00:00:48,083
Fender Stratocaster guitar, which was
very fashionable with the Beach Boys,

14
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,442
and the Shadows, and other such bands.

15
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:54,281
So this isn't a Western with orchestral,
Hollywood-type score.

16
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:57,996
lt's a rock-and-roll score.
This is a rock-and-roll Western.

17
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:01,921
And the emphasis in the Rotoscoping
is on the most violent scenes,

18
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:04,965
or the most action-type
scenes in the movie.

19
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:08,403
The cast is a mixture of American lead,

20
00:01:08,487 --> 00:01:11,047
ltalian actors,
Spanish actors, West Germans.

21
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:14,597
This is an ltalian-Spanish-West
German coproduction,

22
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:17,599
and each wanted a slice
of the action with the cast.

23
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:19,837
Here's a direct James Bond reference.

24
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:23,602
The iris looking down onto the horseman.

25
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:26,918
James Bond had been successful
in ltaly, and you could say

26
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:31,159
part of the impetus for this film is
to bring Bond together with the Western,

27
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:34,284
to turn it into a mid-1 960s
grown-up kind of Western

28
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:38,997
that would appeal to the audience
for James Bond movies.

29
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:48,757
Shot in Techniscope, known as
the poor man's CinemaScope,

30
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:53,079
a two-perforation system where you
printed two frames for the price of one.

31
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:56,318
lt was quite difficult to use,
and encouraged the use

32
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,479
of either long shots or extreme close-ups,

33
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:06,086
which, of course, is one of the technical
innovations of the ltalian Western.

34
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:13,399
ln the shooting script, the movie
begins with a map of the Rio Grande,

35
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:15,523
or the Rio Bravo, as Mexicans call it,

36
00:02:15,607 --> 00:02:18,917
with northern Mexico
and the southern United States.

37
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:24,639
And it's 1872, New Mexico. You see
the water, you see the mule's feet.

38
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:28,276
You see the rider go across
the water, and his name is Ray.

39
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:31,837
He's a Confederate sergeant.
And you see him steal a poncho

40
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:36,637
off a hatless Mexican peon
who's having a swim in the Rio Grande.

41
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:39,764
He puts on the poncho, cut,
and then the movie begins.

42
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:44,443
But in the final version, it's much more
enigmatic, and more iconic as a costume,

43
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:50,443
because you don't know why he's wearing
it, but he looks at home in Mexico.

44
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:54,122
This sequence was shot
in Almeria, in southern Spain,

45
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:58,439
at a place called Cortijo el Sotillo,
at San Jose, east of Almeria,

46
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:04,205
and it looks much the same now
as it did then. This is an actual place.

47
00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:09,440
Now, in a traditional Western,
the hero would look at this child,

48
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:12,087
and take an interest in what was going on.

49
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:15,477
Perhaps intervene in some way
in what's about to happen.

50
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:18,445
But Eastwood is simply
having a drink, watching,

51
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:22,566
sussing out what's happening around him,
he's not going to intervene.

52
00:03:22,647 --> 00:03:26,765
At this stage, he's just an onlooker,
trying to see what's going on.

53
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:30,920
And the look of Eastwood
is so distinctive in Western terms.

54
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:34,477
The stubble. American
Western heroes didn't have stubble.

55
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:39,482
There's the poncho. There's the sort of
laid-back look, the coolness of the hero.

56
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:42,923
Plus he's a big man on a little mule,
which is interesting.

57
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:46,886
One of the references in the opening
is to Shane, a favourite with Leone,

58
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:51,006
where you have a little man on
a big horse, Alan Ladd, at the beginning.

59
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:56,400
But this is a big man on a mule,
and he's dressed in a very stylish way.

60
00:03:56,487 --> 00:04:00,799
This is a Roman actor called Mario Brega
playing Chico, a sadistic thug,

61
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:04,197
kicking the baby,
and what's the hero doing?

62
00:04:04,287 --> 00:04:07,677
He's not intervening. He's just watching.

63
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:11,840
This is a very different
kind of Wild West hero.

64
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:23,443
These villages in Almeria in Spain,
with their single-story adobe dwellings,

65
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:26,087
whitewashed, were used
a lot in ltalian Westerns.

66
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:30,365
They were existing places. Minimal set
dressing would enable them to be used

67
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:35,885
as 1 9th-century villages
on the Mexican-American border.

68
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,800
The actress is Marianne Koch,
a West German actress

69
00:04:38,887 --> 00:04:42,436
who had just been voted by
the West German magazine Filmmaker

70
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:46,042
the most popular actress
for films in Germany.

71
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:50,882
She agreed to appear in this movie, even
though it's almost a nonspeaking part.

72
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:56,963
Wearing a lot of eye makeup, Cleopatra
style. l guess that was the thing in 1 964.

73
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:03,926
Of course, there weren't trees
in this part of Almeria. lt's desert.

74
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:07,397
According to Clint Eastwood,
Sergio Leone and his crew

75
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:11,560
were driving past a hapless farmer's
courtyard and saw this tree,

76
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:14,082
and thought,
''That's the tree we want.''

77
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:17,364
They got out, said,
''We're from the highway department.''

78
00:05:17,447 --> 00:05:21,076
''Your tree is a danger to traffic.''
Got permission to cut it down,

79
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:25,285
pinched it, stuck it into the ground,
and put it in this opening sequence.

80
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,518
You can't see the roots,
they're resting in the ground.

81
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:30,916
lt was a very low-rent production.

82
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:36,639
This street is further north, a village
called Los Albaricoques, ''the apricots'',

83
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:39,161
which appeared in
a lot of Leone's Westerns.

84
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:42,603
The main cobbled street,
with single-story adobe dwellings.

85
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:47,602
And the rider goes by with
''Adios, amigo'' written on his back.

86
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,598
ln Yojimbo, by Kurosawa,

87
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:55,078
the samurai movie on which
Fistful of Dollars was directly based,

88
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:59,558
what happens at this moment is that a dog
walks by with a human hand in its mouth.

89
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:04,118
And the samurai hears this
bickering family, which sets up the plot.

90
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:07,722
lnstead, Clint Eastwood
is greeted by the local bell-ringer,

91
00:06:07,807 --> 00:06:13,404
who acts as a kind of chorus, like in a
Shakespearian play, or traditional theatre.

92
00:06:13,487 --> 00:06:19,483
The chorus tells him exactly what's going
on in the background to the town.

93
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:37,119
ln Yojimbo, the village in 1 9th-century
Japan is divided into two factions:

94
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:39,767
the silk merchants
and the sake merchants.

95
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:42,759
And the shambling,
itchy, bow-legged samurai

96
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:44,838
with his sword strapped to his waist

97
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:49,000
walks into town and sells his services,
first to one faction then the other.

98
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,239
As we're told by the crazy bell-ringer,
this town is run by two factions.

99
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:57,718
One is gunrunners,
and the other runs liquor.

100
00:06:57,807 --> 00:07:00,844
Eastwood rides into the main set
of Fistful of Dollars,

101
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:05,284
which actually was
an existing set 35km north of Madrid,

102
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,801
at a place called Hoyo de Manzanares.

103
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:12,324
The set was built in 1 962
for a series of Spanish Zorro films.

104
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:15,240
lt resembled a ghost town,
wasn't used for a while.

105
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:17,921
lt was redressed
by the designer, Carlo Simi,

106
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:20,316
who put new frontages
on part of the town.

107
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,557
Basically it was a pre-existing set.

108
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:26,162
They really hadn't got
any money to play with.

109
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:29,205
Lots of references
to Easter and resurrection,

110
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:31,960
and the idea of a town
of widows, a town of death.

111
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:34,925
There's coffins,
there's bells, bell-ringers,

112
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:37,885
there's Eastwood crucified
on the cantina sign.

113
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:40,925
There's a resurrection towards the end.

114
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:45,000
There's a Last Supper, when
the baddies all get together for a meal.

115
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:48,523
lt's riddled with Catholic iconography,

116
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:51,964
which wasn't, l think,
a deep decision by Leone,

117
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:56,359
simply that it would be recognisable
to a largely southern ltalian audience,

118
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:59,359
at which this movie
was originally pitched.

119
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:03,281
The bartender, whose name
is Silvanito, is played by José Calvo,

120
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:07,155
a well-known Spanish actor
who'd appeared in ltalian Westerns.

121
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:11,445
Fistful of Dollars was not the first
ltalian Western, as people think.

122
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:15,805
There had been about 25 Spanish
and ltalian and West German Westerns

123
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:19,004
made between 1 962 and 1 964.

124
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:22,204
But they were copy American Westerns.

125
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:26,917
Where Fistful of Dollars scored was it was
the first distinctively ltalian Western.

126
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:31,319
The critics compare copyists to
ltalianisers, and ltalianisers begin here.

127
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:35,639
The distinctive features are those
of an ltalian movie applied to the West.

128
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:40,926
And this came through
in Fistful of Dollars for the first time.

129
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:49,878
José Calvo had, in fact, been making
movies since the early 1 950s in Spain,

130
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:54,722
and bore a startling resemblance to Walt
Disney's Geppetto in the film Pinocchio,

131
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:58,482
which endeared him
to audiences in the west.

132
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:30,847
The coffin maker, Piripero, is played
by an Austrian actor called Joseph Egger,

133
00:09:30,927 --> 00:09:34,363
who was 75 years old at
the time he made this film,

134
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:40,283
and went on to appear as the old prophet
in For A Few Dollars More, his last movie.

135
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:43,359
He was a music-hall star,
a sort of stand-up comedian,

136
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:46,120
who was very popular
with West German audiences.

137
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:52,316
So Spanish bartender, American
stranger, Austrian coffin maker outside.

138
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,602
And the three choruses in this movie,

139
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,839
the three characters who introduce us
to the theatre of San Miguel,

140
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:02,044
this flyblown village
just across the Mexican border,

141
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:05,358
are the bell-ringer,
the coffin maker, and the bartender,

142
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:09,963
which are exact equivalents of the same
characters in Kurosawa's film Yojimbo,

143
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,278
where there's a cooper
and a coffin maker and a watchman,

144
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:16,245
who serve a very similar function.

145
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:24,720
ln Kurosawa, it's the fire tower
in the 1 9th-century Japanese village

146
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:28,402
where the yojimbo sits
and watches the mayhem that he causes,

147
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:31,240
looking down upon
the two factions as they fight.

148
00:10:31,327 --> 00:10:34,046
Here, it's the balcony of the saloon,

149
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:38,325
which was specially designed as
a frontage by Carlo Simi, the designer.

150
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:44,198
Carlo Simi had walked into Sergio Leone's
office in Rome, just before filming started,

151
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:48,075
had looked at the existing designs
for the film Fistful of Dollars,

152
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:51,796
which was called The Magnificent
Stranger, its working title,

153
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:54,117
and thought they looked terrible.

154
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:57,199
He got the drawings,
made them larger than life,

155
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,721
with huge Mexican interiors and beams

156
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:04,676
and a rather over-the-top form
of Wild West, or Wild Southwest, design.

157
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:07,327
Leone hired him,
thinking he had something.

158
00:11:07,407 --> 00:11:09,443
He was a qualified architect,

159
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:13,679
and his contribution to Sergio Leone's
Westerns has been much underrated.

160
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:17,442
The look of those Leone towns,
the way in which the sets are dressed.

161
00:11:17,527 --> 00:11:20,803
Carlo Simi designed
the costumes in this film as well,

162
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:24,197
some of which were ready-mades,
some specially designed.

163
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,245
The poncho, for example,
was specially designed,

164
00:11:27,327 --> 00:11:31,639
although one member of the crew
remembers, perhaps falsely,

165
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:35,515
that they found it in a flea market
in Madrid, on the way to the shoot.

166
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,996
But l doubt that that's true.

167
00:11:46,927 --> 00:11:50,203
ln the shooting script,
it wasn't Baxters versus Rojos,

168
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:54,041
in other words,
an Anglo family and a Mexican family,

169
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:56,482
it was the Morales instead of the Baxters.

170
00:11:56,567 --> 00:12:00,526
ln the original version it was
in fact two Mexican clans fighting it out.

171
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:06,364
But in the transformation of shooting
script into final script that they made,

172
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:11,680
the idea of an Anglo family and a Mexican
family gave it a kind of racial edge.

173
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:17,763
We're in a Hispanic society where there's
a racial conflict within the community.

174
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:39,285
Eastwood worked
very cheap indeed for this film.

175
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:44,282
He worked for $1 5,000 all-in fee,
plus a six-week holiday in Spain.

176
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:47,279
The other actors who
were considered for the part,

177
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,200
Charles Bronson,
James Coburn, Henry Fonda,

178
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:55,156
and even some expatriate American
actors living in Rome like Rod Cameron,

179
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:58,045
aged 54, who'd been
Buck Jones' stunt man

180
00:12:58,127 --> 00:13:02,439
but was still around making Westerns
in ltaly, they all proved too expensive.

181
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:07,203
Eastwood, who was a refugee
from the TV series Rawhide

182
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:11,963
when he went over for the summer to
shoot in Spain and ltaly, came for $1 5,000.

183
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:15,164
So, Don Miguel, l do work cheap.

184
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:30,602
This is the first classic Mexican
face-off in Leone's Westerns,

185
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:35,556
where the lone stranger
has this sharp, hip dialogue,

186
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:39,879
and the baddies are much more abusive
than they are in American Westerns.

187
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,844
And the tension builds up.

188
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:45,397
ln a Hollywood movie of the time,
this would take ten seconds.

189
00:13:45,487 --> 00:13:49,082
Stranger would stand there,
pull his gun, there'd be a fight.

190
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:51,681
This is heightened into a form of rhetoric.

191
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:56,363
lt's the first example of Leone taking a
classic situation from a Hollywood movie,

192
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,324
pumping it up,

193
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:02,480
and making it into something
a bit more exciting for '60s audiences.

194
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:06,003
They feel they've seen it before,
but never quite like this.

195
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:10,126
There's gonna be violence,
but how much of it?

196
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:00,087
Five shots, four people fall down.

197
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,955
The ratio is rather greater than
in Hollywood Westerns of the time,

198
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:07,244
where you'd expect a one-on-one duel.

199
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:10,524
The scene is almost directly
from Kurosawa's Yojimbo,

200
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:13,121
but with a completely
different atmosphere.

201
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:17,041
There's an element of parody, taking
hallowed moments of the Western

202
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:20,437
and turning them into something else,
whereas in Yojimbo

203
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:25,442
the face-offs have a more informal,
historical quality.

204
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:28,883
And the hero in Yojimbo
was a well-known hero, Sanjuro,

205
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:32,801
who'd appeared in other films,
so Toshirô Mifune, the character,

206
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:36,675
brought that with him. Whereas
this stranger we know nothing about.

207
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:39,406
We never learn anything
about his background.

208
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:44,925
He's come from nowhere, he's going
nowhere, he goes round shooting people.

209
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:48,283
''My mistake. Four coffins.''
ln Kurosawa it's three.

210
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:51,279
There's a bit of inflation.
Typical Leone gag.

211
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:55,758
A rather macabre gag,
involving the coffin maker.

212
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:01,678
The town is deserted.

213
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:05,204
ln other Westerns which use this set,
and there were plenty,

214
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:08,836
the town is teeming with life,
with marketplaces and wagons.

215
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:13,478
Leone simply couldn't afford, on the
budget from his three coproducers,

216
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,285
to have extras.

217
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:21,363
Basically, it's the principals and
that's it, except for a couple of scenes.

218
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,879
Some of the interiors
of the film were shot in Rome,

219
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,245
and some of them
were shot at a Spanish museum

220
00:16:56,327 --> 00:17:02,163
which was called the Casa de Campo,
which is a museum of rural life in Madrid,

221
00:17:02,247 --> 00:17:07,924
where they had lots of ceramic pots
and wagons and Hispanic design.

222
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:10,157
The courtyard and part of the interior

223
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:14,126
were shot at the Casa de Campo,
and the rest was reconstructed in Rome.

224
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:18,644
They started in Rome,
for the interiors, went to the set in Spain,

225
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:22,356
the second unit went to Almeria,
shot the Almerian material,

226
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:25,200
and then postproduction
took place in Rome.

227
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:30,236
This was a Carlo Simi interior,
which would have been shot in Rome.

228
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:47,002
Mario Brega, playing the rather large
Mexican baddie, the sadistic baddie,

229
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:52,316
had a huge afterlife in ltalian Westerns,
where he was typecast in a similar role,

230
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:56,320
and he ended up in The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly as Sergeant Wallace,

231
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:59,877
and spaghetti buffs spot him everywhere.

232
00:18:11,247 --> 00:18:15,126
Ennio Morricone's music was...
lf we've got the production design,

233
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:19,598
the design of the costumes,
the personal style of the hero,

234
00:18:19,687 --> 00:18:23,839
and the Almerian locations
as features of this new kind of Western,

235
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:25,918
then the other element is the music,

236
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:29,443
which we've already heard
at full whack behind the credits.

237
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:33,281
Morricone wasn't, in fact,
the first choice of composer.

238
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:38,487
Leone wanted a man called Lavagnino
who had scored The Last Days of Pompeii

239
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,684
and The Colossus of Rhodes,
which Leone had worked on.

240
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:45,157
But eventually he agreed
to go and see Morricone in Rome,

241
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:47,966
discovered he'd been
to school with Morricone,

242
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:52,643
in their primary school together,
and they started reminiscing.

243
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:56,322
They were keen to have
a very different kind of score for this.

244
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:59,524
Much more hip.
Rather as James Bond had been, hip.

245
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:03,646
With the famous main title of James Bond
played on an amplified guitar.

246
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:08,039
And they tried a bit to find a theme,
and eventually Morricone recalled

247
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:12,484
he'd written an arrangement of the
Woody Guthrie song ''Pastures of Plenty''

248
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,161
a few years before,
with Fender Stratocaster,

249
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:18,523
with choir, with all these
natural sounds and whipcracks.

250
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:21,804
Leone said,
''Take the vocal track off it, let's hear it.''

251
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:26,961
They did, and it is identical
to the main track of Fistful of Dollars.

252
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:32,121
Morricone and Leone wanted
Mexican gypsy peasant music

253
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:36,439
as part of the background to the
musical track, this idea of San Miguel,

254
00:19:36,527 --> 00:19:39,678
a village in northern Mexico,
which is a village of death.

255
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:44,397
So they were keen to have
mariachi trumpet, gypsy sounds.

256
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:47,001
Leone particularly
remembered ''Deguello'',

257
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:50,238
the theme that Dmitri Tiomkin
had written for Rio Bravo,

258
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:55,037
when John Wayne as Sheriff Chance
and Ricky Nelson are holed up in the jail,

259
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,199
and they can hear this lament
going on down the street.

260
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:01,438
Ricky Nelson says,
''That was what they played at the Alamo

261
00:20:01,527 --> 00:20:07,159
to try and destabilise the defenders, the
Texans who were defending the Alamo.''

262
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,320
Leone remembered that, said,
''l want a lot of that in the music.''

263
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:16,879
''This dirgelike, funereal music.
lt'll be perfect. A Mexican dance of death.''

264
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:20,437
Later on in the movie,
the ''Deguello'' would come in full whack.

265
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:23,678
Morricone was a trumpeter
by training, as was his father.

266
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:28,045
So there's a big emphasis
on trumpet in the soundtrack.

267
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:38,244
This part of the score is like some
Renaissance ltalian piece of music.

268
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:42,523
lt recurs a little bit later on, as well.

269
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:49,642
Very, very strange. Odd juxtaposition.
You're in 1 9th-century northern Mexico,

270
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:53,197
you get a Renaissance piece
of dance music on the soundtrack.

271
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:56,199
Those were the kind of...
To make the audience sit up.

272
00:20:56,287 --> 00:21:00,041
Leone said, ''My philosophy
can be summed up with the thought:

273
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:02,595
'l never want the audience to get bored'.''

274
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:06,396
He said, ''l get bored with Westerns.
People talk too much.''

275
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:11,322
''You know, there's a lot of method acting
and a lot of extensive verbiage,

276
00:21:11,407 --> 00:21:16,242
and much too much music, and the music
doesn't have much to do with the image.''

277
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:21,355
''This method acting has got to the point
where in a film like The Left Handed Gun,

278
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:26,043
if a social worker had been around,
Billy the Kid would never have happened.''

279
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:30,962
''l want to go back to the Westerns of the
1 930s when l was growing up in Rome.''

280
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:35,245
''Lots of action, lots of surprise.
A fairy tale for grown-ups.''

281
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:39,605
So the music is important as part
of this strategy of making people jump.

282
00:21:39,687 --> 00:21:43,919
''This is odd. l haven't seen it like this,
and it'll keep me concentrating.''

283
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:47,795
And also strange elisions of the plot.
As Leone's cinema matured,

284
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:51,197
he'd get very used to telling
stories in a very indirect way.

285
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:54,040
You're not quite sure what you're seeing,

286
00:21:54,367 --> 00:22:00,840
then it'd be explained later - all part of the
strategy of keeping the audience on edge.

287
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:17,843
ln 1 950, Hollywood Westerns
had been 34 per cent of all releases

288
00:22:17,927 --> 00:22:20,646
that were made in Hollywood.
That's 1 50 movies.

289
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:24,766
ln 1 963, when Fistful of Dollars
was first planned,

290
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:29,238
Westerns represented nine per cent
of Hollywood output. That's 1 5 films.

291
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:34,162
So it had gone from 1 50
in 1 950 to 1 5 films in 1 963.

292
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:37,045
Leone said,
''The Western's dying in Hollywood.''

293
00:22:37,127 --> 00:22:41,962
There was a huge market for Westerns in
Europe, particularly in ltaly and Germany.

294
00:22:42,047 --> 00:22:44,561
People who'd grown up in the 1 930s,

295
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:47,115
for whom the Western
was a model of freedom.

296
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:49,767
They'd grown up under Mussolini.

297
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:53,760
And the Western had been
something to see - this land of plenty,

298
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:57,965
the wide open spaces,
the hero who has freedom of movement.

299
00:22:58,047 --> 00:23:00,277
And looking towards the Western

300
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:03,484
was a way of clearing their minds
of what went on at home.

301
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:07,685
They were disappointed with the '50s,
hated television Westerns.

302
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:12,443
Too overlit, too anodyne, too clean.
Everyone's teeth sparkled too much.

303
00:23:12,527 --> 00:23:15,121
So let's rough up
the Western, make it grungy.

304
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:17,960
You have a revisionist
grunge in the foreground,

305
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:22,040
with the stubble, and the cheroot,
and everyone looking a bit dirty,

306
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:28,123
with a kind of epic pretension in the
background. That's what Leone was after.

307
00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:38,680
Now, this location was south of Madrid,

308
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:42,077
but not as far south as Almeria.

309
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:46,763
Aldea del Fresno, ''the valley
of the ash trees'', by the river Alberche.

310
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:51,637
lt's a favourite Leone moment. They ride
together, the camera goes up on a crane,

311
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:54,560
and you can see beyond
it a whole crowd of people.

312
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:57,081
One of those visual surprises that you get,

313
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:00,079
trompe l'oeil effects
that you get in his films.

314
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:05,480
One of Leone's favourite painters was
Magritte, who specialised in juxtaposition.

315
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:08,559
ln The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
there's a famous one.

316
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:11,923
They look through the bushes
and there's the trenches

317
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:14,441
with literally thousands of troops.

318
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:19,078
This is the first of those moments, at
the Rio Bravo canyon, called Rio Bravo

319
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:23,877
because it's the Mexican side and the
Rio Grande was known as the Rio Bravo.

320
00:24:23,967 --> 00:24:29,917
This is the first of the major sequences
in the film that was not in Yojimbo.

321
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:33,522
There's no reference to this
in Yojimbo at all. This was added.

322
00:24:33,607 --> 00:24:36,599
The consignment of gold,
the massacre of the troops,

323
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:39,759
the introduction
of the baddie Ramón Rojo,

324
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:42,805
Gian Maria Volonté,
an ltalian theatre actor.

325
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:45,447
All this was added by the scriptwriters

326
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:50,043
to fill out the story of Yojimbo,
and make it even more mean.

327
00:24:50,127 --> 00:24:52,766
The massacre doesn't happen in Yojimbo.

328
00:24:52,847 --> 00:24:56,044
This ups the ante in terms
of the body count in the movie,

329
00:24:56,127 --> 00:25:00,803
and makes the violence
that much more larger than life.

330
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,604
Most of this sequence,
apart from the cutaways

331
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:16,282
to Clint Eastwood
and Silvanito, the bartender,

332
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:20,280
were in fact shot by Franco Giraldi,
the assistant director,

333
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:23,598
who was called in
at the last minute as an assistant

334
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:27,646
and told by the producers,
''We don't believe in assistants,

335
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:31,925
but we want to shoot this so quickly
we must have two crews working.''

336
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,805
So this famous sequence,
apart from the cutaways,

337
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:40,086
was shot by Franco Giraldi, who recalls
sitting in Spain with Gian Maria Volonté...

338
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,725
Here he is, Ramón.

339
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:45,277
Who is rather a left-wing
character in ltalian politics,

340
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:50,077
sitting in this flyblown location
in Spain, in spring 1 964,

341
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:54,445
in Franco's Spain, where a fascist
regime was running the country, saying:

342
00:25:54,527 --> 00:25:58,759
''What on earth are we doing here?
We're making a Western, set in the 1870s,

343
00:25:58,847 --> 00:26:00,838
in a fascist country.''

344
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:04,283
''What a strange situation
for a socialist in ltaly to be in.''

345
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:09,760
And Giraldi recalls long conversations
with Volonté of this kind.

346
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:22,282
Volonté was a graduate
of a Roman drama academy,

347
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:26,918
had made his name playing Romeo
in Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare,

348
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:29,999
and then entered
the film industry in the early '60s.

349
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:32,920
Was a difficult character to work with,

350
00:26:33,007 --> 00:26:35,202
had appeared in one or two pepla,

351
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:38,120
Hercules Conquers Atlantis,
and one or two others,

352
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:41,119
but hadn't really
made his name in the movies.

353
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:44,483
This turned him into an international star.

354
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:48,803
His theatrical performance
was deliberately heightened,

355
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:52,721
so that the baddie would seem
a sort of narcissistic, childlike,

356
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:57,005
self-regarding kind of baddie,
rather than an underplayed one.

357
00:26:57,087 --> 00:27:00,523
ln For A Few Dollars More,
they'd ratchet up the performance.

358
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:02,723
The baddie wears a white shirt.

359
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:07,278
ln Hollywood the baddie wore black,
and certainly on television Westerns.

360
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:10,325
But in this one,
the first vocal entry of the baddie,

361
00:27:10,407 --> 00:27:13,444
of the real baddie, is in a white shirt.

362
00:27:14,447 --> 00:27:17,166
Just as the goodie wears
a rather dirty brown hat.

363
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:19,238
This isn't white hats and black hats,

364
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:22,319
everyone wears grey hats,
as Clint Eastwood put it.

365
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,602
You're not sure who the goodies are.

366
00:27:24,687 --> 00:27:28,600
You know Ramón is the baddie,
but what's Clint Eastwood's role in this?

367
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:30,678
The stranger has been watching,

368
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:34,806
showing a great interest,
selling himself from one side to the other.

369
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:38,323
We're not sure of his motivation.
ls he on the side of law?

370
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:42,161
ls he after personal profit?
Does he have any sense of honour at all?

371
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:44,238
Time will tell.

372
00:27:56,727 --> 00:28:02,085
Esteban Rojo was played by Sieghardt
Rupp, who was a West German actor,

373
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:05,523
like the leader of the Baxters,
John Baxter, the sheriff,

374
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:09,520
was played by Wolfgang Lukschy,
who was a West German actor.

375
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:15,603
A lot of the baddies are played by West
Germans, and Ramón was an ltalian actor.

376
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,165
This white fluff passing across the screen,

377
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:29,001
which was a production touch
by Carlo Simi, white shirt, white fluff,

378
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:31,965
the idea of almost snow falling,
playing against...

379
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:36,916
Here you've got a psychopathic baddie,
and he appears in the whiteness of snow,

380
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:41,046
the whiteness of his shirt. They play
always against your expectations.

381
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:46,599
ln the casting, in ltaly,
and also in the production design.

382
00:28:47,807 --> 00:28:50,685
A trill on the soundtrack
as he moves his cheroot.

383
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:54,885
lt was an ltalian cigar called a Toscano,
which is virtually unsmokable.

384
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:59,006
You have to cut it with a knife
in order to open up the tobacco.

385
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:03,080
Eastwood didn't like smoking very much,
in fact was very antismoking.

386
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,283
He'd gone on record as antismoking.

387
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:10,202
But they felt this cigarillo,
this Toscano was part of the character.

388
00:29:10,287 --> 00:29:14,041
ln the 1 960s, smoking was seen
as a sign of control and masculinity.

389
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:18,598
Today l guess it's the opposite. But in
the 1 960s it was seen as that symbol.

390
00:29:18,687 --> 00:29:21,918
And Eastwood said whenever
he lit up, which wasn't often,

391
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:25,363
the cheroot often is half-smoked
and he's not smoking it.

392
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:29,486
When he does, he said, ''lt put me in
the right frame of mind. Kind of a fog.''

393
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:33,355
And when it came to the second movie,
For A Few Dollars More,

394
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:36,917
Eastwood said to Leone,
''Do l have to smoke the cigar?''

395
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:39,475
''l don't like it very much.'' Leone replied:

396
00:29:39,567 --> 00:29:44,436
''Of course you must smoke the cigar.
lt's playing the lead.''

397
00:29:58,407 --> 00:30:02,082
ln Yojimbo, there's a strong sense
at this stage in the story

398
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:06,206
of this 1 9th-century village in Japan
belonging to a wider community.

399
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:08,847
A government inspector
comes to the village

400
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:11,680
and gives you a sense
of the politics beyond,

401
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,600
and you also get a sense
that there is law and order

402
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:20,637
in the society of 1 9th-century Japan, but
it's broken down in this particular place.

403
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:24,436
ln Fistful of Dollars,
there is no sense of law and order at all.

404
00:30:24,527 --> 00:30:28,964
That there's no law, the sheriff
is corrupt like all sheriffs in Leone's films,

405
00:30:29,047 --> 00:30:34,804
so the bounty hunters, those on
the take, the factions, the families,

406
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:39,962
the Hispanic Mafia which runs these
towns is the substitute for law and order.

407
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,720
There's a complete
absence of morality and law,

408
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:46,083
which makes it take place
in a kind of moral vacuum.

409
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:50,638
References to governments outside are
perfunctory. This isn't put in a context.

410
00:30:50,727 --> 00:30:55,562
lt's a piece of theatre about a town
that is a kind of never-never land

411
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:58,241
where morality doesn't exist.

412
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:05,000
You want Eastwood to be the goodie,
but he never quite behaves like that.

413
00:31:10,047 --> 00:31:12,641
ln most of the film,
he doesn't wear his poncho,

414
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:15,525
although that's what
everyone remembers him for.

415
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,565
He wore it in the opening
and the final sequences,

416
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:23,482
but in between, the sheepskin waistcoat,
the blue shirt, the shrunk-to-fit jeans -

417
00:31:23,567 --> 00:31:25,876
they had one of each
so had to look after it,

418
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,879
if they got it wet or dirty
they had to dry-clean it

419
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:33,757
so he could wear it for the next setup -
was what Eastwood wore.

420
00:31:57,127 --> 00:31:59,800
Here's the ''Deguello'' theme, the trumpet

421
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:04,085
with the strumming guitar in the
background. A Mexican funeral dirge.

422
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:07,045
The death-rattle song from The Alamo.

423
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:11,642
Leone wanted to use the theme
from The Alamo and from Rio Bravo,

424
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:15,356
which was the same theme,
but they discovered it wasn't a folk tune,

425
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:19,360
it was written by Dmitri Tiomkin
in the 1 950s, and was in copyright.

426
00:32:19,447 --> 00:32:21,802
So they made this adaptation.

427
00:32:21,887 --> 00:32:25,846
And here's the Baxter clan,
waiting to visit the Rojo clan.

428
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:29,761
ls this peace plan
worth anything, or isn't it?

429
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:37,516
Consuelo Baxter, the Madonna
who runs the Baxter clan, effectively,

430
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:41,202
because her husband isn't strong,
is played by Margarita Lozano,

431
00:32:41,287 --> 00:32:46,645
a Spanish actor who had made
her name in Luis Buñuel's film, Viridiana.

432
00:32:46,727 --> 00:32:53,405
And Leone was very fond of Buñuel's
work, so he cast her as Consuelo Baxter.

433
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:59,723
Some of the shots which are made
day-for-night in this film don't work well.

434
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:03,959
Some work, where you have torches
and it's obvious that Massimo Dallamano,

435
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:07,562
the director of photography,
filmed at night.

436
00:33:07,887 --> 00:33:12,358
But some are done with filters, and it
shows what a low-budget movie this was.

437
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:16,122
This is the second sequence
which has nothing to do with Yojimbo.

438
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:18,437
The scene in the cemetery, this subplot

439
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:23,681
of taking the bodies of the massacred
soldiers from the Rio Bravo canyon,

440
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:27,123
putting them into a cemetery
and pretending they survived.

441
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:29,675
This was the second of Leone's inventions

442
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:32,725
which wasn't based
on the Kurosawa original.

443
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:36,004
lnevitably, it's with coffins,
crosses, cemeteries,

444
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:39,762
the iconography of death, with
which he appears to be obsessed.

445
00:33:39,847 --> 00:33:43,840
A lot of graveyards
appear in Leone's Westerns.

446
00:34:00,567 --> 00:34:05,277
lt's interesting that they're using these
bodies as if they were puppets, or decoys,

447
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:09,485
because Leone claimed that
one of the inspirations for his Westerns,

448
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:12,957
particularly Fistful of Dollars,
was puppet theatre.

449
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:17,245
Particularly the Sicilian puppets
called the Pupi Siciliani,

450
00:34:17,327 --> 00:34:22,879
rather like Punch and Judy in England, or
other puppet traditions all over the world.

451
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:28,246
They were large, metal puppets
which were operated by rods from above,

452
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:31,956
which enacted stories from
the middle ages. The Song of Roland.

453
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:36,279
Orlando and his magic steed
and his magic spear and his sidekick,

454
00:34:36,367 --> 00:34:40,360
who would fight the Moors
in a re-enactment of medieval battles.

455
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:43,962
Puppeteers would go round Sicily,
perform these stories,

456
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:46,038
but adapt them to the locality.

457
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:50,006
They'd find out who's the local mayor,
the chemist, the bank manager,

458
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:55,445
and those characters would appear
in this traditional mythological setting.

459
00:34:55,527 --> 00:35:00,442
And Leone said when he made his first
Western, he was doing exactly the same.

460
00:35:00,527 --> 00:35:02,483
He took the Hollywood Western,

461
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:06,640
and in the case of Fistful of Dollars,
two Westerns he was very fond of:

462
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:11,847
Shane, with Alan Ladd, made by George
Stevens, and Edward Dmytryk's Warlock,

463
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:15,442
a complicated Western
made in the 1 950s with Henry Fonda.

464
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:20,476
He was taking those two films, reworking
them in this ltalian and Spanish context,

465
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:23,559
and doing exactly
as the Sicilian puppeteers did.

466
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:28,482
Take the puppet show, take the Western
as a given, adapt it to the local culture.

467
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:33,436
And there are the two puppets sitting
there, lying against the gravestone.

468
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:54,197
West German actor playing Baxter,

469
00:35:54,287 --> 00:35:58,200
conversing with Spanish actor
playing his wife Consuelo.

470
00:35:58,287 --> 00:36:03,281
And officials and sheriffs
and bank managers and bank tellers

471
00:36:03,367 --> 00:36:06,677
and schoolteachers
and hotel clerks in Leone's films

472
00:36:06,767 --> 00:36:09,042
tend to be treated with some derision.

473
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:13,006
A very traditional commedia dell'arte
approach to officialdom,

474
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,318
where the official
is probably on the take, corrupt.

475
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,683
There was the odd corrupt
sheriff in Hollywood movies,

476
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:21,803
but they were taken as the exception.

477
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:26,039
ln Leone's Wild West,
all officialdom is on the take.

478
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:29,403
lt's dog eat dog.
And where life has no value,

479
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:33,162
people like the stranger
are the ones that give it value.

480
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:35,238
A monetary value.

481
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:54,075
Now, Leone had made various films
in the late '50s and early '60s

482
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,635
in the sword-and-sandal genre.

483
00:36:56,727 --> 00:37:00,561
He'd been an assistant director
on the chariot race for Ben-Hur,

484
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:03,480
he worked on Helen of Troy,
he worked on Quo Vadis.

485
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:05,558
He'd made The Colossus of Rhodes.

486
00:37:05,647 --> 00:37:08,241
He completed the film
The Last Days of Pompeii,

487
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:11,842
after his mentor, Mario Bonnard,
the director, fell ill.

488
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:15,363
So he'd dealt with a very
masculine world of mythology,

489
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:18,007
set in ancient Greece or Rome,

490
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:23,559
and he certainly had difficulties
in locating female characters in his films.

491
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:29,202
The old thing about ''Madonna and whore''
goes very much for Leone's early films.

492
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:34,156
The characters are very saintly,
like the Marianne Koch character, Marisol,

493
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:38,480
or they're trollops, as a lot of the
characters in For A Few Dollars More are.

494
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:42,560
The central family in this film,
with the mother played by Marianne Koch,

495
00:37:42,647 --> 00:37:47,437
in case you hadn't got the point,
are called Julio, Marisol and little Jesus.

496
00:37:47,527 --> 00:37:51,566
The baby we saw is called Jesus,
his mother's called Mary, Marisol,

497
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:53,922
and his father's Julio, or Joseph.

498
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:56,646
So we've got a Holy Family in this story.

499
00:37:56,727 --> 00:37:59,082
One kind of family are the good guys,

500
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:02,045
the stranger looks after
them and protects them.

501
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:07,042
But the other kind of family is factions, the
Rojos and the Baxters, which is a Mafia,

502
00:38:07,127 --> 00:38:11,405
a clan, a faction, the dark side of
family life - two visions of the family.

503
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:14,836
Female characters, Leone's uneasy with.

504
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:19,364
He doesn't really know how
to fit them in, so they're treated as...

505
00:38:19,447 --> 00:38:21,756
ln the factions, as one of the boys.

506
00:38:21,847 --> 00:38:25,886
Basically, it's a kind of
adolescent view of sexuality,

507
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:29,755
which you imagine was pitched
at the audiences in southern ltaly,

508
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:31,838
who had a low boredom threshold

509
00:38:31,927 --> 00:38:35,636
and talked unless something
happened every ten minutes.

510
00:38:35,727 --> 00:38:38,958
lt's that kind of audience
that this film was pitched at.

511
00:38:39,047 --> 00:38:41,641
Hence there's action every ten minutes.

512
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:44,764
Hence you keep the audience
on their toes all the time,

513
00:38:44,847 --> 00:38:48,157
assume the audience needs
to be entertained constantly.

514
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:53,799
And l think the sexuality of the movie
makes that assumption as well.

515
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:16,285
This was the museum
in Madrid, the courtyard.

516
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:21,122
This museum of rural folkloric life
which was a ready-made.

517
00:39:21,207 --> 00:39:23,641
The crew went in and shot inside it.

518
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:27,720
Other ltalian Westerns
used the same location.

519
00:39:40,807 --> 00:39:45,801
Not too many stunt men around.
The budget couldn't run to it.

520
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:53,846
The crosscutting between
the Rojos riding to the cemetery

521
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:57,237
to see what's going on
with the two dead soldiers,

522
00:39:57,327 --> 00:40:02,606
and Eastwood doing a bit of detective
work back at the Rojo residence,

523
00:40:02,687 --> 00:40:07,203
is in fact not based on Yojimbo,
but it's loosely based on passages

524
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:09,517
in Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest,

525
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:14,044
a detective novel written
about the Continental Operative,

526
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:18,996
who was a private investigator, which has
a very similar story to Fistful of Dollars,

527
00:40:19,087 --> 00:40:21,521
and Yojimbo,
and The Servant of Two Masters.

528
00:40:21,607 --> 00:40:23,723
That whole idea of two clans fighting,

529
00:40:23,807 --> 00:40:26,162
and someone sets them
against each other.

530
00:40:26,247 --> 00:40:29,125
But the detective element
of this part of the movie

531
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:31,767
has a kind of Dashiell
Hammett feeling to it.

532
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:35,396
Leone claimed he'd brought
Hammett together with Yojimbo,

533
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:40,322
and taken the Japanese story home again,
when he adapted it into Fistful of Dollars.

534
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:43,877
Eastwood is about to try
and find where the gold is hidden,

535
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:46,765
and he does it not by thoughtfulness.

536
00:40:48,327 --> 00:40:52,957
Sanjuro in Yojimbo is a very thoughtful
character, who sits back and reflects a lot.

537
00:40:53,047 --> 00:40:55,845
The Eastwood character doesn't do that.

538
00:40:55,927 --> 00:40:58,316
Action is character in this film.

539
00:40:58,407 --> 00:41:02,241
Nevertheless, he's trying to work
out where the gold must be buried,

540
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:06,206
by exploring the stores
in the Rojo residence.

541
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:19,204
Soundtrack design
is another distinctive feature.

542
00:41:19,287 --> 00:41:24,407
Not only the music, but the way
in which natural sounds are amplified.

543
00:41:24,487 --> 00:41:26,876
ln ltaly, everything was postsynchronised.

544
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:29,925
There wasn't a tradition
of shooting direct sound.

545
00:41:30,007 --> 00:41:33,044
So you have a guide track
when you're making the film,

546
00:41:33,127 --> 00:41:35,880
but when you go into dubbing
you do what you like.

547
00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:38,527
You can construct
all the layers of sound.

548
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:42,646
Fellini had done it, Pasolini
was to do it, Visconti had done it.

549
00:41:42,727 --> 00:41:45,560
All the greats in ltalian cinema
used sound design.

550
00:41:45,647 --> 00:41:49,162
Leone said that sound
was 40 per cent of a movie.

551
00:41:49,247 --> 00:41:53,035
So what you get is, say, a gunshot
followed by a horse whinnying,

552
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:56,039
followed by silence.
lt's all constructed that way,

553
00:41:56,127 --> 00:42:01,520
in order that the soundtrack should also
contribute to the tension in the audience.

554
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:06,044
And, of course, Morricone and Leone
collaborated on the sound design,

555
00:42:06,127 --> 00:42:08,687
by also superimposing the music on that,

556
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,235
bringing natural sounds
to the soundtrack.

557
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:15,445
Score, as well. So music
and natural sound play off each other.

558
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:17,643
But they're experimenting.

559
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,446
lt's an apprentice movie
for Leone, in a sense.

560
00:42:20,527 --> 00:42:23,758
He'd made sword and sandal,
it's his apprentice Western.

561
00:42:23,847 --> 00:42:29,080
They're experimenting with sound, trying
to bring it out, but they haven't the budget.

562
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:33,797
The dream was that all the music would
be written before the movie was shot,

563
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:37,323
and the entire movie be shot
to a prerecorded soundtrack.

564
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:41,605
But they couldn't afford that,
and couldn't afford that for the next movie.

565
00:42:41,687 --> 00:42:47,205
They began with The Good, the Bad and
the Ugly, Once Upon A Time in the West.

566
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:10,327
This shootout, it has to be said, does
resemble a traditional B-movie shootout.

567
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:15,640
Two sides taking pot shots and no one
shooting each other, like a TV Western.

568
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:19,640
What makes it distinctive is this
crosscutting between the cemetery

569
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:25,324
and the stranger banging the barrels, and
there's syncopation between the sounds.

570
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:29,764
He bangs the barrels once or twice,
a similar number of shots at the cemetery.

571
00:43:29,847 --> 00:43:33,317
He bangs it again,
you get a similar number of gunshots.

572
00:43:33,407 --> 00:43:39,004
So the sound is what links
these two simultaneous events together.

573
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:45,476
Four bangs, four shots.
One, two, one, two.

574
00:43:46,287 --> 00:43:51,361
First example of Leone's fast crosscutting
that became distinctive of his cinema.

575
00:43:51,447 --> 00:43:55,679
The idea of two simultaneous things
that can't know about what they're doing,

576
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:59,840
but there's an aural connection
or a visual connection between them.

577
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:04,796
lt's pure style, it's got nothing
to do with the real world.

578
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:17,724
There's a lot more shooting than there
tended to be in Hollywood Westerns.

579
00:44:17,807 --> 00:44:21,197
One of the people in the dubbing room
remembers Leone saying:

580
00:44:21,287 --> 00:44:23,596
''l want more gunshots, more gunshots.''

581
00:44:23,687 --> 00:44:29,842
So they got someone to go
to a canyon, or a quarry, near Rome,

582
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:32,441
to film various sounds of guns.

583
00:44:32,527 --> 00:44:37,726
And in fact the rifle shots
were the ones that Leone used

584
00:44:37,807 --> 00:44:40,640
for the pistol shots
in the film, to heighten it.

585
00:44:40,727 --> 00:44:44,276
So the pistols sound like rifles,
the rifles like cannons,

586
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:46,562
and cannons like a nuclear explosion.

587
00:44:46,647 --> 00:44:50,037
He wanted to heighten the sound
in any way that he could.

588
00:44:50,127 --> 00:44:52,925
There's a distinctive gunshot
in ltalian Westerns,

589
00:44:53,007 --> 00:44:59,276
the result of putting a different sound,
a different calibre of gun, onto the pistol.

590
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:05,558
And then the stranger
discovers the gold by mistake.

591
00:45:06,887 --> 00:45:09,799
ln the American version
of Fistful of Dollars,

592
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:13,197
the Eastwood character was
called ''the man with no name''.

593
00:45:13,287 --> 00:45:16,484
And on the posters for United Artists,
the man with no name

594
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:19,479
heralds a new style of adventure.

595
00:45:19,567 --> 00:45:22,764
ln the release script he's called Joe.

596
00:45:22,847 --> 00:45:25,566
ln the film there's one
or two references to Joe.

597
00:45:25,647 --> 00:45:30,721
The coffin maker refers to him
as Joe, Joe the stranger.

598
00:45:30,807 --> 00:45:33,162
ln the shooting script
he was known as Ray.

599
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:36,000
But he reached the US
as ''the man with no name''.

600
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:40,126
Here's a good example of him
treating the girls as one of the chaps.

601
00:45:40,207 --> 00:45:44,246
He walks into the room, punches
her in the face, and down she falls.

602
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:48,923
This is not an adult
relationship with a woman,

603
00:45:49,007 --> 00:45:52,363
with which Leone had
huge problems in his cinema.

604
00:46:04,687 --> 00:46:09,124
Admittedly, Joe the stranger
feels rather guilty about what he's done,

605
00:46:09,207 --> 00:46:13,439
but it's a surprise moment

606
00:46:13,527 --> 00:46:17,964
that is rather unpleasant
in its sexual implications.

607
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:36,075
Lots of hoof noises and whinnying as the
horses arrive, superimposed afterwards.

608
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:40,160
Most of the actors would have spoken
their own language on the set.

609
00:46:40,247 --> 00:46:43,876
The German actors spoke German,
the Spanish actors spoke Spanish,

610
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,164
the ltalians spoke ltalian,
and Eastwood spoke American.

611
00:46:47,247 --> 00:46:51,638
Sometimes you get a kind of pause for
a second or two in moments of dialogue,

612
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:54,195
as people register what the other's saying.

613
00:46:54,287 --> 00:46:58,565
Then they went into the dubbing studio
and recorded different languages.

614
00:46:58,647 --> 00:47:01,923
Leone himself hardly spoke English at all.

615
00:47:02,007 --> 00:47:05,124
He just had one phrase, ''Watch me.''

616
00:47:05,207 --> 00:47:09,917
So what he would do is he would stand on
the set in a cowboy hat with thick glasses,

617
00:47:10,007 --> 00:47:13,556
wearing a pair of toy guns,
looking a bit like Yosemite Sam.

618
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:17,526
''Watch me, Clint.'' And he'd act out
what he wanted the characters to do.

619
00:47:17,607 --> 00:47:21,680
So his direction was all done
at the level of mime.

620
00:47:23,327 --> 00:47:25,887
The assistant director reminisced to me

621
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:29,755
that he thought one of the distinctive
ltalian features of this movie

622
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:35,319
is that in doing the mime, Leone would
turn the character into a Roman character.

623
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:38,399
That actually
in performing it for the actors,

624
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:42,002
the Western hero
became this Roman trickster.

625
00:47:42,087 --> 00:47:44,885
This Harlequin figure from ltalian culture,

626
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:49,722
a very strong figure within
ltalian theatrical traditions.

627
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:51,957
lt was the miming, ''Watch me, Clint'',

628
00:47:52,047 --> 00:47:57,679
that created, partly, the character of
the man with no name, Joe the stranger.

629
00:47:57,767 --> 00:48:01,885
Partly that, and partly the fact
that when Eastwood arrived in Spain,

630
00:48:01,967 --> 00:48:04,162
he thought the script was much too talky

631
00:48:04,247 --> 00:48:07,876
and he cut a lot of dialogue to
make the character more enigmatic.

632
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:12,802
The shooting script contains lots of long
speeches. Leone put a line through it.

633
00:48:12,887 --> 00:48:17,642
He may be the only actor in movie history
who's actually fought for less lines.

634
00:48:17,727 --> 00:48:20,082
Most actors want more,
but he wanted less,

635
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:25,366
because he felt it created the magic,
the enchantment. lt created the enigma.

636
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:53,482
The second big set piece scene
is the exchange of hostages.

637
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:57,242
lnstead of white fluff,
autumn leaves blowing over the camera.

638
00:48:57,327 --> 00:49:00,239
The idea of a brown, autumnal colour.

639
00:49:00,327 --> 00:49:03,319
And we've got the Rojos in all their finery.

640
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:09,323
Their hidalguia, the sort of hierarchical
sense of a clan, a Spanish-Mexican clan,

641
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:12,001
on one side, the Baxters on the other.

642
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:15,602
ln the middle, the man with no name.
That trill on the soundtrack

643
00:49:15,687 --> 00:49:19,600
is a typical Morricone commentary
on the character through music.

644
00:49:19,687 --> 00:49:22,838
That had never appeared
in a Western before.

645
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:27,125
And then the cigar shifts,
or Eastwood does a double-take.

646
00:49:27,207 --> 00:49:30,438
lt's a kind of musical punctuation.

647
00:49:30,527 --> 00:49:34,202
The ''Deguello'' again on the
soundtrack, the mariachi trumpet,

648
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:37,484
with the Spanish guitar backing.

649
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:42,238
Very ritualised, very rhetorical.

650
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:47,236
Leone had been involved in
an exchange-of-hostage sequence before,

651
00:49:47,327 --> 00:49:51,320
when he was assistant director
on Helen Of Troy.

652
00:49:57,847 --> 00:50:00,042
Big close-ups.

653
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,277
Guns.

654
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,325
Ramón's Winchester '73. Marianne Koch.

655
00:50:05,407 --> 00:50:10,117
So you've had the establishing shot, now
you have a series of extreme close-ups,

656
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,767
the Techniscope frame
creating a letterbox

657
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:15,122
around these big close-ups of faces.

658
00:50:15,207 --> 00:50:18,882
The close-up plays a different
function to traditional Westerns,

659
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:23,961
where it tended to be reaction shots
in conversation, or in gunfights.

660
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:27,756
These are faces treated
as if they're gargoyles on a cathedral.

661
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:31,556
Big close-ups of the faces
with all their imperfections,

662
00:50:31,647 --> 00:50:35,356
creating a visual grammar
to build up the tension of the scene.

663
00:50:35,447 --> 00:50:40,726
These aren't reactions, these are simply
pieces of design to go with the music.

664
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:44,482
ln a way, this is the origin
of the famous cemetery shootout

665
00:50:44,567 --> 00:50:48,321
in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
Music with big close-ups.

666
00:50:48,407 --> 00:50:52,195
Only instead of a duel,
it's an exchange of hostages.

667
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:22,365
Very operatic. The music builds up.

668
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:26,486
''Mama, Mama,'' says Jesus,
little Jesus as he rushes out.

669
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:31,436
lt's like a scene from an opera
of the 1 9th century in ltaly.

670
00:51:32,887 --> 00:51:34,957
A Verdi opera.

671
00:51:35,047 --> 00:51:36,958
Someone called these Westerns:

672
00:51:37,047 --> 00:51:40,323
''An opera in which the arias
aren't sung, they're stared.''

673
00:51:40,407 --> 00:51:46,243
And that Leone had given a whole new
meaning to the phrase ''horse opera''.

674
00:51:46,327 --> 00:51:51,481
lt's an odd combination of realism in
the foreground, with these grungy faces,

675
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:54,240
and operatic quality in the background.

676
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:59,082
A mixture of cinematic grammar creating
this opera, and very grungy foreground.

677
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:02,079
You don't believe fairy tales
unless they look real.

678
00:52:02,167 --> 00:52:05,603
Leone said, ''l don't like
Disney fairy tales or movies.''

679
00:52:05,687 --> 00:52:08,247
''They're too clean. l don't believe them.''

680
00:52:08,327 --> 00:52:11,842
You've got to have grunge,
but it's still a fairy tale.

681
00:52:11,927 --> 00:52:14,157
A fairy tale for grown-ups.

682
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:17,603
Welcome home by slapping the boy.

683
00:52:17,687 --> 00:52:22,681
That's not something that
happened in Hollywood Westerns.

684
00:52:50,887 --> 00:52:54,277
ln the morality of Leone's Westerns,

685
00:52:54,367 --> 00:52:59,885
you can often tell who the real baddies are
by the way they treat children.

686
00:52:59,967 --> 00:53:04,040
Everyone's pretty bad,
and some are worse than others,

687
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:07,085
but the real baddies
tend to threaten children,

688
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:11,479
or in the case of For A Few Dollars More
actually shoot a child.

689
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:14,127
That's the signal
that this guy is really bad.

690
00:53:14,207 --> 00:53:17,119
So he's upped the ante
on the morality stakes,

691
00:53:17,207 --> 00:53:21,359
and this is the moment where
Marisol, Mary, the Virgin Mary,

692
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:24,120
looks at the stranger.

693
00:53:24,207 --> 00:53:26,277
She wants to be protected.

694
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:31,836
The setup of them is like a painting of the
Holy Family, in the middle of the street,

695
00:53:31,927 --> 00:53:37,923
which was quite deliberate, just as the
Last Supper will come a little bit later on.

696
00:53:42,407 --> 00:53:48,164
You could argue that most Hollywood
Westerns were, in fact, Protestant,

697
00:53:48,247 --> 00:53:52,559
and Socially Darwinist
in their attitude towards the West.

698
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:56,640
That you do get references to the
Holy Family, particularly in Shane,

699
00:53:56,727 --> 00:53:58,843
a model of Fistful of Dollars.

700
00:53:58,927 --> 00:54:03,682
Marian and little Joey
in their log cabin in the wilderness,

701
00:54:03,767 --> 00:54:07,999
and there's Shane the redeemer
coming in and saving the Holy Family.

702
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:10,203
But the profusion of iconography,

703
00:54:10,287 --> 00:54:14,200
and the setting in the southwest,
and the ltalianising of the Western

704
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:19,601
creates a Roman Catholic atmosphere,
rather than the Protestant Western.

705
00:54:19,687 --> 00:54:23,760
Just as the locale shifts from
the middle West, or Wyoming,

706
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:28,875
or the setting of the Johnson County War,
which was where Shane was set,

707
00:54:28,967 --> 00:54:33,802
further southwest into
a Latin, ltalian, Hispanic setting.

708
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:38,119
Lots of things flow from that,
including Roman-Catholic iconography,

709
00:54:38,207 --> 00:54:40,596
which is part of Leone's project.

710
00:54:40,687 --> 00:54:44,600
lt's not a religious Western.
He's mocking much of the iconography.

711
00:54:44,687 --> 00:54:50,683
He's saying, ''We can recognise this
as something we can identify with.''

712
00:54:56,447 --> 00:55:01,475
So we're not judging Ramón,
we're saying he's smart. Smart wins.

713
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:07,005
Somebody once said about the character
that Eastwood epitomised in this film

714
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:10,716
that in the old films,
the hero was the best shot.

715
00:55:11,047 --> 00:55:13,515
ln a film like this, the best shot is the hero.

716
00:55:13,607 --> 00:55:16,201
ln other words,
the guy who's good with a gun,

717
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:19,199
whose technique is superior
to everyone's else's,

718
00:55:19,287 --> 00:55:22,836
who is a trickster who can outwit
everyone, that is the hero,

719
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:26,124
rather than the hero being
able to mobilise those forces.

720
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,596
So here we have
the Last Supper sequence,

721
00:55:28,687 --> 00:55:32,885
with the suit of armour that apparently
did duty in countless Zorro films,

722
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:35,800
in the governor's residence
in old California,

723
00:55:35,887 --> 00:55:41,678
now standing in as a prop to be shot at
as Ramón and his disciples sit at the table

724
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:45,601
in a deliberate reference
to Leonardo's painting of The Last Supper,

725
00:55:45,687 --> 00:55:48,076
which is in Milan.

726
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:05,923
''Aim for the heart, Ramón.''
This comes up later in the film.

727
00:56:06,007 --> 00:56:10,205
Ramón with his Winchester '73,
a fantastic shot.

728
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:13,245
Obviously, good shooting
to create this heart shape.

729
00:56:13,327 --> 00:56:17,036
But that will come up later.
''Aim for the heart, Ramón'',

730
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:21,325
will become the catchphrase
of the end of the film.

731
00:56:31,687 --> 00:56:33,996
A Mexican proverb
invented for this movie.

732
00:56:34,087 --> 00:56:38,717
''When a man with a .45 meets a man with
a rifle, the man with a rifle will be dead.''

733
00:56:38,807 --> 00:56:41,321
The man with no name, Joe the stranger,

734
00:56:41,407 --> 00:56:46,401
will disprove this old Mexican proverb
in style in the final sequence of the film,

735
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:50,275
by pitting his .45
against the rifle of Ramón.

736
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:59,159
The Anglo sidekick of Ramón
is played by Benito Steffanelli,

737
00:56:59,247 --> 00:57:04,605
an interesting ltalian actor who was
also the co-stunt director of the film,

738
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:08,962
and became the armourer and
stunt director of Leone's films.

739
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:12,437
Quite a lot of characters
in this film represent the assembling

740
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:16,156
of a kind of repertory company for Leone.

741
00:57:16,247 --> 00:57:20,126
Mario Brega as the overweight baddie,

742
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:25,042
Benito Steffanelli as the stunt man,
Morricone with the music.

743
00:57:25,127 --> 00:57:27,561
This is the establishment of a home team

744
00:57:27,647 --> 00:57:31,879
that Leone would work with in the future,
over and over and over again.

745
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:34,720
Various Spanish actors
pop up in the background.

746
00:57:34,807 --> 00:57:37,401
Aldo Sambrell,
who is in this film as a baddie,

747
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:41,196
plays a baddie in
nearly all Leone's Westerns.

748
00:57:41,287 --> 00:57:46,566
So he's assembling a crew that he will
work with in future, Spanish and ltalian.

749
00:57:46,647 --> 00:57:48,797
And in this case, American as well,

750
00:57:48,887 --> 00:57:53,722
because a member of the Baxter clan,
the gunman who wears the green shirt,

751
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:57,595
was played by Bill Thomkins,
who was in fact Eastwood's stunt double

752
00:57:57,687 --> 00:58:00,121
that he brought over
from the United States.

753
00:58:00,207 --> 00:58:03,358
So Bill Thomkins appears
as one of the Baxter gunmen.

754
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:08,441
And on some prints of the film, he was
actually billed as ''Western consultant'',

755
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:13,362
so Bill Thomkins not only
did stunts for Eastwood

756
00:58:13,447 --> 00:58:17,440
and appeared as one of the gunmen,
but was Western consultant.

757
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,405
One can only wonder
what sort of consultancy,

758
00:58:20,487 --> 00:58:24,765
because it is so different
to the traditional Hollywood Western.

759
00:58:25,767 --> 00:58:28,964
Here's a dried-up riverbed in Almeria.

760
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:34,804
Almeria's full of dried-up riverbeds called
ramblas, which were rivers but dried up.

761
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:37,640
So you get canyon walls, and these wide,

762
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:42,357
almost street-like
spaces in between them.

763
00:58:42,447 --> 00:58:44,677
These ramblas were incredibly useful

764
00:58:44,767 --> 00:58:48,476
for shooting sequences
of horses going at full tilt.

765
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:52,685
You could keep the outside world out
and let 'em rip, like a racecourse.

766
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:55,235
The ramblas of Almeria
appear in this movie,

767
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:59,161
as indeed they do
in all Leone's Westerns.

768
00:59:25,247 --> 00:59:29,160
A rare shot of Eastwood
actually lighting up his Toscano.

769
00:59:29,247 --> 00:59:32,683
One thing about them is that
they're difficult to keep alight.

770
00:59:32,767 --> 00:59:36,999
They keep going out,
and that's certainly the case here.

771
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:42,957
Another moment of ultraviolence,
like with the Baxters falling off the gate.

772
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:46,835
And the sound of the cat, which in one
or two of Leone's Westerns you get

773
00:59:46,927 --> 00:59:50,397
as a soundtrack thing,
to punctuate the action,

774
00:59:50,487 --> 00:59:54,366
the cat shrieking
as the violence takes place.

775
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:06,484
A machete. lt's interesting.

776
01:00:06,567 --> 01:00:12,119
ln Yojimbo, Sanjuro wears
his sword strapped to his waist.

777
01:00:12,207 --> 01:00:16,439
lt's a sword-fighting movie, and the
violence is about a rather languid hero,

778
01:00:16,527 --> 01:00:20,236
who has moments of violence
with spectacular swordplay,

779
01:00:20,327 --> 01:00:22,397
then sheaths his sword and walks off.

780
01:00:22,487 --> 01:00:24,876
This is, l think, a reference to Yojimbo,

781
01:00:24,967 --> 01:00:27,640
with Eastwood's use of the machete.

782
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:34,402
This had an X certificate
when it came out,

783
01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:37,718
because the violence really came
as something of a shock.

784
01:00:37,807 --> 01:00:40,162
Perhaps not the violence. The brutality.

785
01:00:40,247 --> 01:00:44,877
The sense of the enjoyment of physical
punishment which comes through,

786
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:49,165
is true of all Leone's films,
and is still controversial to some extent.

787
01:00:49,247 --> 01:00:51,966
You've got the style,
the production design,

788
01:00:52,047 --> 01:00:54,481
the music, these distinctive features,

789
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:58,526
but you've also got this lingering
on moments of brutality,

790
01:00:58,607 --> 01:01:03,886
which, even in this first Western, it would
become more extreme later, is present.

791
01:01:03,967 --> 01:01:09,963
And as the film builds up, so upping
the ante on brutality becomes important.

792
01:01:41,647 --> 01:01:44,081
''l knew someone
like you and no one helped.''

793
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:47,000
The only moment in the film
where any motivation

794
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:49,521
is attributed to the Eastwood character.

795
01:01:49,607 --> 01:01:52,405
Up to now, he's been
on the take, from the Rojos,

796
01:01:52,487 --> 01:01:55,126
from the Baxters,
set one against the other.

797
01:01:55,207 --> 01:01:57,801
But here, he's actually doing a moral act.

798
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:02,039
He's protecting the Holy Family and
sending them back across the border

799
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:05,642
because, ''l knew someone like you,
and there was no one to help.''

800
01:02:05,727 --> 01:02:09,845
And in the shooting script, there were
about three pages of explanation,

801
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:14,318
which referred to a prologue which Leone
originally wanted to put into the movie

802
01:02:14,407 --> 01:02:18,195
of an earlier incident in the stranger's life.

803
01:02:18,287 --> 01:02:21,040
That was cut out,
and instead just that one line.

804
01:02:21,127 --> 01:02:25,564
lt's the only moment in the whole film
where you get a sense of moral position

805
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:28,923
on the part of the stranger.
Otherwise, he works for cash.

806
01:02:29,007 --> 01:02:31,601
lnstead of, ''Man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do'',

807
01:02:31,687 --> 01:02:34,724
the crusading element
in Hollywood Westerns,

808
01:02:34,807 --> 01:02:39,483
what you've got is a much more
pragmatic, hip, streetwise,

809
01:02:39,567 --> 01:02:43,924
1 960s, on the take, sort of
James Bondian kind of approach.

810
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:48,717
Although even James Bond, of course, is
working for Her Majesty's secret service.

811
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:54,723
He has a sense of values there,
but that's a rare moment in this film.

812
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:57,275
San Miguel is not a moral place.

813
01:03:02,367 --> 01:03:06,201
The ramblas of Almeria, done in long shot.

814
01:03:06,807 --> 01:03:10,436
Stunt work as the horse
goes down the side of the sand dunes.

815
01:03:10,527 --> 01:03:14,805
The colouring of Almeria is completely
different to Arizona and New Mexico.

816
01:03:14,887 --> 01:03:19,165
lt's olive trees, it's grey, it's ash.

817
01:03:19,247 --> 01:03:24,196
lt's not red sandstone. lt just
doesn't have the same colour palette.

818
01:03:24,287 --> 01:03:27,836
The browns.
Leone's cameraman, Tonino Delli Colli,

819
01:03:27,927 --> 01:03:31,840
who took over from Dallamano from
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, said:

820
01:03:31,927 --> 01:03:34,361
''Yellows, and beiges, and dust,

821
01:03:34,447 --> 01:03:38,281
and the colour of Almeria became
the colour of the ltalian Western.''

822
01:03:38,367 --> 01:03:44,363
lt is a completely different colour palette,
one of the distinctive features of the film.

823
01:03:45,927 --> 01:03:49,966
The choir was conducted
by Alessandro Alessandroni,

824
01:03:50,047 --> 01:03:53,960
who also did the whistling
and also played the guitar in this film.

825
01:03:54,047 --> 01:03:58,325
And, in fact, it was
a Fender Stratocaster guitar

826
01:03:58,407 --> 01:04:02,685
which l have played when
l went to visit Alessandro in Rome.

827
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:05,201
The sacred guitar.

828
01:04:05,287 --> 01:04:09,326
He was a performer in nightclubs and
music halls with his Cantori Moderni,

829
01:04:09,407 --> 01:04:11,967
''The Modern Singers''.

830
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:17,838
Alessandro was responsible for
a lot of the sounds on the soundtrack.

831
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:28,524
As Leone's cinema progressed,
the music started using

832
01:04:28,607 --> 01:04:31,440
traditional folk instruments much more,

833
01:04:31,527 --> 01:04:34,917
so you have the marranzano,
or the Jew's harp,

834
01:04:35,927 --> 01:04:39,966
that twanging which became
associated with the Eastwood character.

835
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:43,596
And the argilophone,
a ceramic instrument,

836
01:04:43,687 --> 01:04:46,281
also a traditional Sicilian instrument.

837
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:49,120
And the sense of ltalian folk story

838
01:04:49,447 --> 01:04:53,759
superimposed on the Western... You get
a sense of unusual instruments, whistling,

839
01:04:53,847 --> 01:04:55,997
and this sense of isolation in the music,

840
01:04:56,087 --> 01:05:00,160
but this would develop
as Leone's cinema developed.

841
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:23,676
Gian Maria's Volonté's voice
was dubbed by someone else.

842
01:05:23,767 --> 01:05:28,045
He didn't speak English at all,
and it was dubbed in the dubbing studio.

843
01:05:28,127 --> 01:05:30,721
ln For A Few Dollars More,
he had to use his voice,

844
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:35,676
so he had to learn it phonetically
and speak English on the soundtrack.

845
01:05:35,767 --> 01:05:39,157
Here's the famous beating-up sequence.

846
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:43,604
The stranger seems invulnerable,
he seems entirely on top of the situation,

847
01:05:43,687 --> 01:05:45,996
but he's made a mistake
and he's gonna pay.

848
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:50,444
ln most ltalian Westerns, and indeed
in most subsequent Clint Eastwood films,

849
01:05:50,527 --> 01:05:53,837
you get a scene where
he gets very thoroughly beaten up,

850
01:05:53,927 --> 01:05:57,715
and then resurrects in order to
get his own back in the final reel.

851
01:05:57,807 --> 01:06:01,163
But this was taking it
several steps further than Hollywood.

852
01:06:01,247 --> 01:06:07,641
The gleeful laughing of the boys as they
punch him around. lt's pure sadism.

853
01:06:07,727 --> 01:06:12,005
Hurting him because they enjoy it,
not just because they want to hurt him.

854
01:06:12,087 --> 01:06:15,318
Stubbing out the cigar
on his hand, that was missing

855
01:06:15,407 --> 01:06:18,763
from most prints in the 1 960s
cos it was thought too strong.

856
01:06:18,847 --> 01:06:25,082
Pouring tequila onto his wounds.
That was also cut by the British censor.

857
01:06:26,287 --> 01:06:28,847
And it does go on for a very long time.

858
01:06:28,927 --> 01:06:32,317
Like a Marlon Brando style
beating-up, in On The Waterfront.

859
01:06:32,407 --> 01:06:36,605
That urban violence rather than
the traditional punch-up of the Western,

860
01:06:36,687 --> 01:06:42,683
where you break a chair over someone's
head, laugh, and John Wayne goes home.

861
01:07:01,087 --> 01:07:05,399
''ln a week, you'll be back in shape.''
lt would take about three months.

862
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:08,081
And there's still more to come.

863
01:07:16,487 --> 01:07:19,365
And at this moment, Chico the thug,

864
01:07:19,447 --> 01:07:23,679
played by Mario Brega,
brings his heel down on Eastwood's hand.

865
01:07:23,767 --> 01:07:26,679
Only it's his left hand,
so Chico isn't bright enough

866
01:07:26,767 --> 01:07:29,565
to bring his heel down
on Eastwood's gun hand.

867
01:07:29,647 --> 01:07:32,036
lnstead, he does this to his left hand,

868
01:07:32,127 --> 01:07:38,077
which isn't going to affect his gunfighting
abilities. Chico ain't that bright.

869
01:07:39,287 --> 01:07:43,644
ln Leone's cinema, there's
a lot of sequences involving torture

870
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:47,276
and, ''Will someone talk,
will someone betray?''

871
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:51,042
Leone reckoned that
his obsession with that kind of setup,

872
01:07:51,127 --> 01:07:54,199
the Eli Wallach scene in
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,

873
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:59,042
the Doctor Villega scene in Giù La Testa,
A Fistful of Dynamite, Duck You Sucker,

874
01:07:59,127 --> 01:08:01,800
someone being punished,
and will they betray?

875
01:08:01,887 --> 01:08:04,959
This is a folk memory in Leone's mind

876
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:09,598
of what happened in the 1 940s
in Rome, when the Nazis occupied,

877
01:08:09,687 --> 01:08:14,602
when a lot of people did business with the
Nazis and some went into the Resistance.

878
01:08:14,927 --> 01:08:19,205
This issue of, ''Did you talk? Were you
tortured? Did you give away secrets?''

879
01:08:19,287 --> 01:08:22,962
was an important part of ltalian culture.

880
01:08:27,287 --> 01:08:32,759
That's Chico out of the way,
with a barrel, full one, into his body.

881
01:08:36,527 --> 01:08:42,318
So the stranger hasn't talked,
and his only option is to get away.

882
01:08:43,967 --> 01:08:49,724
But there's a lot of ltalian history in these
films, in particular recent ltalian history,

883
01:08:49,807 --> 01:08:54,403
of those that fought in the resistance
against the Nazis, those who collaborated.

884
01:08:54,487 --> 01:08:59,402
Those who had some things they might
be ashamed of in the Second World War,

885
01:08:59,487 --> 01:09:01,955
and those who were treated
as heroes after.

886
01:09:02,047 --> 01:09:05,596
As the ltalian Western matured
enough to cope with politics,

887
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:08,281
a lot of this comes through in the films.

888
01:09:08,367 --> 01:09:11,837
And certainly the beatings-up,
and, ''How strong are you?''

889
01:09:11,927 --> 01:09:15,920
''Will you throw your lot in with
the fascists?'' comes into Leone's films.

890
01:09:16,007 --> 01:09:19,283
He didn't fight in the Resistance.
His mum wouldn't let him.

891
01:09:19,367 --> 01:09:21,642
And he always regretted it.

892
01:09:55,367 --> 01:09:58,040
These films, when they first came out,

893
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:03,042
were treated by most
of the critics as ersatz American films.

894
01:10:03,127 --> 01:10:06,324
The early ltalian Westerns,
made between 1 962 and 1 964,

895
01:10:06,407 --> 01:10:08,841
undoubtedly were ersatz American films.

896
01:10:08,927 --> 01:10:11,122
They tried to look like Hollywood,

897
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,675
the main characters
hid under pseudonyms

898
01:10:13,767 --> 01:10:17,157
so ltalian audiences
would think they were American films.

899
01:10:17,247 --> 01:10:19,636
They were about Buffalo Bill,

900
01:10:19,727 --> 01:10:22,924
directed by people named
John Fordson, that sort of thing.

901
01:10:23,007 --> 01:10:25,043
Pretending to be Hollywood films.

902
01:10:25,127 --> 01:10:30,155
Cowboy and lndians, liquor,
gunrunners and this sort of thing.

903
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:33,399
But the whole point
about Fistful of Dollars

904
01:10:33,487 --> 01:10:36,684
is that it's the first really ltalian Western.

905
01:10:36,767 --> 01:10:40,646
lt's no longer something that
seems a carbon copy American film.

906
01:10:40,727 --> 01:10:43,082
The more you look at it,
the stranger it gets

907
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:46,284
in comparison with
the Hollywood originals.

908
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:51,600
l think a lot of the critics missed the point,
seeing an attempt to emulate Hollywood.

909
01:10:51,687 --> 01:10:54,121
These were ltalian and Spanish movies,

910
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:59,042
and the cultural references are, in a way,
the most important thing. The difference.

911
01:10:59,127 --> 01:11:03,996
But of course, yes, they're taking the idea
of the Wild West as a starting point.

912
01:11:04,087 --> 01:11:09,764
lt was clever of Leone to see that Yojimbo
by Kurosawa would make a Western.

913
01:11:09,847 --> 01:11:15,126
He went to see the film in autumn
of 1 963 at the Harlequin cinema in Rome,

914
01:11:15,207 --> 01:11:17,243
and asked his friends to go see it,

915
01:11:17,327 --> 01:11:20,285
and then adapted Yojimbo into a Western,

916
01:11:20,367 --> 01:11:25,395
just as John Sturges adapted The Seven
Samurai into The Magnificent Seven.

917
01:11:25,487 --> 01:11:28,923
lt was a clever idea to nourish
the Western, not doing too well,

918
01:11:29,007 --> 01:11:31,965
with ideas from a different culture, Japan.

919
01:11:32,047 --> 01:11:35,323
Kurosawa himself admitted
when he made his samurai movies,

920
01:11:35,407 --> 01:11:39,241
it was a homage to the Western.
So the whole thing went full circle.

921
01:11:39,327 --> 01:11:42,239
The trouble was that
nobody had cleared the rights,

922
01:11:42,327 --> 01:11:45,876
and during the shooting of
Fistful of Dollars, word came round:

923
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:50,722
''Nobody mentioned Yojimbo, all right?
Nobody mentioned Yojimbo. "

924
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,844
Lawyers exchanged letters,
Kurosawa wrote to Leone

925
01:11:53,927 --> 01:11:55,883
when he saw Fistful of Dollars.'

926
01:11:55,967 --> 01:11:59,277
''l like your film very much.
lt's a very interesting film.''

927
01:11:59,367 --> 01:12:01,642
''Unfortunately, it's my film, not yours.''

928
01:12:01,727 --> 01:12:05,197
Leone couldn't understand
how rude this was, plagiarism.

929
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:08,643
He showed this letter to everyone.
''Kurosawa says it's great.''

930
01:12:08,727 --> 01:12:13,005
And they said, ''But he's saying, 'lt's not
your movie. lt's based on my movie.'''

931
01:12:13,087 --> 01:12:17,797
They eventually settled out of court.
Papi and Colombo, the producers,

932
01:12:17,887 --> 01:12:21,960
their defence was that the plot had
been taken from an ltalian original,

933
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:25,676
an 18th-century play by Carlo Goldoni,
The Servant of Two Masters,

934
01:12:25,767 --> 01:12:29,316
Arlecchino or The Servant of Two
Masters, which was partly true,

935
01:12:29,407 --> 01:12:35,357
but unfortunately it didn't stick,
so Kurosawa, in Japan,

936
01:12:35,447 --> 01:12:38,086
was awarded all the Far-Eastern rights.

937
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:41,762
Japan, Formosa,
now Taiwan, and South Korea,

938
01:12:41,847 --> 01:12:43,997
plus a percentage of the gross,

939
01:12:44,087 --> 01:12:47,921
and in fact the takings from
Fistful of Dollars which Kurosawa made

940
01:12:48,007 --> 01:12:51,397
was more than any movie that
Kurosawa had ever made himself.

941
01:12:51,487 --> 01:12:54,604
So in the end he did quite well out of it.

942
01:12:55,767 --> 01:12:59,123
lt's interesting, you could
mount a more subtle argument.

943
01:12:59,207 --> 01:13:02,916
Yes, the plot is very similar
to Yojimbo, but all the detail,

944
01:13:03,007 --> 01:13:07,000
the cultural atmosphere,
and the originality, is very different.

945
01:13:07,087 --> 01:13:09,681
lt's more to do
with Leone and ltalian cinema

946
01:13:09,767 --> 01:13:12,964
than with Japanese,
but that was too subtle an argument.

947
01:13:13,047 --> 01:13:15,959
Of course, they should
have cleared the rights.

948
01:13:16,047 --> 01:13:19,403
Some claimed they'd written,
some claimed they didn't.

949
01:13:19,487 --> 01:13:23,162
Some claimed they hadn't got
the money and thought they'd risk it.

950
01:13:23,247 --> 01:13:29,117
Whichever way, Kurosawa did very,
very well out of Fistful of Dollars.

951
01:13:49,447 --> 01:13:53,725
Lots of sadistic laughter. That's what
baddies do in Leone's Westerns.

952
01:13:53,807 --> 01:13:58,323
Again, not something they would
tend to do in the Hollywood equivalent,

953
01:13:58,407 --> 01:14:00,477
where baddies were very colourful.

954
01:14:00,567 --> 01:14:04,162
A lot of the baddies
in Leone's films were based

955
01:14:04,487 --> 01:14:10,437
on the colourful villains in the cycle of
films made in the '50s by Budd Boetticher,

956
01:14:10,527 --> 01:14:13,758
the so-called Renown cycle
with Randolph Scott as hero.

957
01:14:13,847 --> 01:14:19,160
Very colourful villains played by Lee Van
Cleef, Richard Boone, James Coburn,

958
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:21,522
Pernell Roberts, and so on.

959
01:14:22,727 --> 01:14:26,925
You have a taciturn hero who underplays
all the time, and doesn't say much,

960
01:14:27,007 --> 01:14:31,000
and an over-the-top villain
that talks a lot and is very colourful,

961
01:14:31,087 --> 01:14:35,797
and lots and lots of detail, was something
Leone said he got from Budd Boetticher.

962
01:14:35,887 --> 01:14:39,163
ln Boetticher they didn't
laugh when they kicked people,

963
01:14:39,247 --> 01:14:43,035
which is what they tend
to do in Leone's films.

964
01:14:55,887 --> 01:14:59,880
Clint Eastwood has recalled that
when he was shooting these sequences

965
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,765
where he's covered
in makeup from the beating-up

966
01:15:02,847 --> 01:15:06,476
that he's had at the hands of the Rojos,
he arrived one day on set

967
01:15:06,567 --> 01:15:10,401
and there was a huge argument
going on between Spanish and ltalians.

968
01:15:10,487 --> 01:15:13,047
Not uncommon on this shoot.

969
01:15:13,127 --> 01:15:16,961
He couldn't work out what was said,
but Leone said through an interpreter:

970
01:15:17,047 --> 01:15:20,596
''lt's all right, Clint, put on your
makeup and come back to the set.''

971
01:15:21,447 --> 01:15:26,077
So he put on the makeup and arrived
back, and found the set deserted.

972
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:30,683
Just the arc lights there,
looking like vultures in the desert.

973
01:15:30,767 --> 01:15:35,522
And so he thought, ''This is it. l'm wearing
all this makeup, l'm hot, l'm fed up.''

974
01:15:35,607 --> 01:15:39,316
So he went back to the hotel
and said, ''l'm off to America.''

975
01:15:39,407 --> 01:15:42,319
As he was leaving,
Leone intercepted him and said:

976
01:15:42,407 --> 01:15:45,683
''Look, it'll be all right.
There won't be rows any more.''

977
01:15:45,767 --> 01:15:49,476
''There isn't much money, it's tense,
but let's get this finished.''

978
01:15:49,567 --> 01:15:54,163
And all was forgiven, and that was
the last of the big rows on the set.

979
01:16:16,127 --> 01:16:20,723
An elaborate set piece.
This wasn't an expensive movie.

980
01:16:20,807 --> 01:16:25,358
lt was in fact treated as the B-movie
of two films which were being made

981
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:30,885
by the ltalian producers,
Giorgio Papi and Arrigo Colombo.

982
01:16:30,967 --> 01:16:36,439
They made a film back to back with this,
Pistols Don't Argue, or Guns Don't Argue,

983
01:16:36,527 --> 01:16:41,555
directed by Mario Caiano, using the
same sets, some of the same costumes,

984
01:16:41,647 --> 01:16:44,605
and the same composer,

985
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:47,360
and indeed the same designer.

986
01:16:47,447 --> 01:16:51,360
And Fistful was there
to use the residue of that movie.

987
01:16:51,447 --> 01:16:55,360
So the main one was Pistols Don't Argue,
which no one's heard of since.

988
01:16:55,447 --> 01:16:58,359
Fistful was there as the also-ran.

989
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,837
So there wasn't much money,
that's why they went for Eastwood

990
01:17:01,927 --> 01:17:05,442
as the cheapest actor. There were
lots of squabbles about money.

991
01:17:05,527 --> 01:17:08,997
The money ran out three-quarters
of the way through shooting,

992
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:11,123
because the Spanish coproducer,

993
01:17:11,207 --> 01:17:16,361
whose name appears on one of the
gravestones in the cemetery as an in-joke,

994
01:17:16,447 --> 01:17:20,599
the Spanish coproducer
hadn't paid his money to the technicians,

995
01:17:20,687 --> 01:17:23,406
so the technicians
arrived on set at Manzanares

996
01:17:23,487 --> 01:17:25,682
and removed all the windows and frames.

997
01:17:25,767 --> 01:17:29,316
They arrived and there were
no windows, so they couldn't shoot.

998
01:17:29,407 --> 01:17:34,037
At which point Papi and Colombo came
from Rome with a suitcase full of money,

999
01:17:34,127 --> 01:17:36,516
which wasn't legal at the time,
cash money,

1000
01:17:36,607 --> 01:17:39,167
crossed the border,
paid off the technicians,

1001
01:17:39,247 --> 01:17:42,603
the windows went back in,
and the movie could continue.

1002
01:17:42,687 --> 01:17:46,123
ln fact, Leone fell out
very seriously with Papi and Colombo

1003
01:17:46,207 --> 01:17:50,359
cos he felt he was owed money
for this film, which he never received.

1004
01:17:50,447 --> 01:17:53,200
They cross-collateralised
with the next movie.

1005
01:17:53,287 --> 01:17:55,517
''We'll pay if you make another movie.''

1006
01:17:55,607 --> 01:18:01,557
At which point Leone threw his lot in with
the entertainment lawyer Alberto Grimaldi,

1007
01:18:01,647 --> 01:18:06,402
who became the producer of his second
and one or two of his subsequent films.

1008
01:18:06,487 --> 01:18:10,799
This sequence was the second
one that was shot by Franco Giraldi,

1009
01:18:10,887 --> 01:18:13,799
assistant director,
who shot the Rio Bravo canyon.

1010
01:18:13,887 --> 01:18:17,880
The burning of the Baxter
house was shot by Giraldi,

1011
01:18:17,967 --> 01:18:20,435
with the cutaways done by Leone.

1012
01:18:20,527 --> 01:18:26,523
And the editor, Roberto Cinquini,
pieced it together from little pieces of film

1013
01:18:26,607 --> 01:18:29,599
with the close-ups
and the reflection of the flames,

1014
01:18:29,687 --> 01:18:34,442
in order to construct this extraordinary
scene of the baddies roaring with laughter

1015
01:18:34,527 --> 01:18:37,599
as they massacre the Baxter clan.

1016
01:18:37,687 --> 01:18:40,520
More sadism,
and it goes on, and it goes on.

1017
01:18:40,607 --> 01:18:44,566
A lot was cut from the British print,
though it got an X certificate.

1018
01:18:44,647 --> 01:18:48,276
The censor couldn't take it.
The enjoyment, the massacre.

1019
01:18:48,367 --> 01:18:50,722
The fact that it's so protracted.

1020
01:18:50,807 --> 01:18:56,279
So Cinquini does the editing, and
Franco Giraldi does the shooting for this,

1021
01:18:56,367 --> 01:18:59,120
while Leone was busy with Eastwood.

1022
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:09,287
You often get in Leone's films someone
peering through a letterbox-shaped space.

1023
01:19:09,367 --> 01:19:12,564
The image is letterboxed,
the Techniscope frame,

1024
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:15,719
but you get someone peering,
like Eastwood.

1025
01:19:15,807 --> 01:19:17,638
So his view is framed,

1026
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:21,436
like the Techniscope frame
this movie is gonna be projected in.

1027
01:19:21,527 --> 01:19:25,566
Rather like Rod Steiger
in Giù La Testa, in Duck You Sucker,

1028
01:19:25,647 --> 01:19:28,878
tearing a poster and seeing
a slat between the wood

1029
01:19:28,967 --> 01:19:32,164
and looking through at a firing squad.

1030
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:38,966
lt's a reminder of the artificiality of the
frame, but he loves the letterbox frame,

1031
01:19:39,047 --> 01:19:44,326
and the way in which that frame
can be filled to push on the action.

1032
01:20:12,887 --> 01:20:15,162
Again, the hero is impassive.

1033
01:20:15,247 --> 01:20:18,523
You'd expect Randolph Scott,
or John Wayne, or Gary Cooper

1034
01:20:18,607 --> 01:20:21,997
to react to this massacre.
lt's pointless.

1035
01:20:22,087 --> 01:20:25,602
And here comes Consuelo,
the matriarch of the clan coming out.

1036
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:29,043
Surely they won't shoot her.
Even in the worst Western,

1037
01:20:29,127 --> 01:20:33,006
no one shot the heroine
or one of the lead female characters.

1038
01:20:33,087 --> 01:20:35,965
But this is an ltalian Western.

1039
01:20:51,207 --> 01:20:54,563
A very elaborate Spanish
curse being cast at them.

1040
01:20:54,647 --> 01:20:58,925
And it's not in fact Ramón
that shoots her, it's his brother.

1041
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:14,165
And Ramón looks at him,
a slightly enigmatic look.

1042
01:21:14,247 --> 01:21:16,317
Would he have done that?

1043
01:21:16,407 --> 01:21:19,080
Was the brother right to do that?

1044
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:21,556
ln any normal morality he wasn't right,

1045
01:21:21,647 --> 01:21:25,765
but in the strange morality of Leone's
film that's an interesting moment.

1046
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:29,806
Ramón doesn't quite approve
of what his brother's done.

1047
01:21:30,327 --> 01:21:35,196
The view from the coffin as we go out.
The whole movie is a view from a coffin,

1048
01:21:35,527 --> 01:21:40,317
in a sense, this town of death, this town
of widows, of cemeteries and bell-ringers.

1049
01:21:40,407 --> 01:21:43,160
No priest, and a corrupt sheriff.

1050
01:21:43,247 --> 01:21:45,966
lt's the view from the coffin.

1051
01:21:46,047 --> 01:21:49,801
And here's Eastwood in a mine shaft,
rehearsing his gun hand

1052
01:21:49,887 --> 01:21:52,242
for the final showdown.

1053
01:21:56,927 --> 01:22:01,478
With a piece of metal
that's been cut out of...

1054
01:22:02,087 --> 01:22:05,397
l don't know, a railcar,
or a boiler, or whatever it is.

1055
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:11,483
But it's gonna turn into a suit of armour,
like the armour in the Rojo residence.

1056
01:22:12,687 --> 01:22:17,238
With the ''Deguello'' theme,
but this time not played on the trumpet.

1057
01:22:17,327 --> 01:22:19,841
More orchestral version.

1058
01:22:19,927 --> 01:22:25,206
A Mexican funeral lament,
because that's what's gonna happen.

1059
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:32,644
When l first saw this l couldn't
work out what was going on.

1060
01:22:32,727 --> 01:22:38,279
Nothing tells you it's a mineshaft, nothing
tells you what's going on, why this metal.

1061
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:41,484
lt's part of Leone's
intriguing form of cinema.

1062
01:22:41,567 --> 01:22:44,525
By the time you've worked
it out it's too late anyway.

1063
01:22:44,607 --> 01:22:47,326
They're onto the next action sequence.

1064
01:22:47,407 --> 01:22:53,277
Syncopating the bangs with the music
again. lt's sort of justified music.

1065
01:22:53,367 --> 01:22:56,803
There'll be a lot of music
in Leone's films justified by action.

1066
01:22:56,887 --> 01:23:01,802
A chiming watch in For A Few Dollars
More, whistling in Duck You Sucker,

1067
01:23:01,887 --> 01:23:05,516
something that happens
justifies the music that goes with it.

1068
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:08,485
The bang of the hammer
in syncopation with the music

1069
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:11,764
sort of justifies the music with the action.

1070
01:23:28,207 --> 01:23:32,519
ltalian Western heroes like to strike
matches on any available surface.

1071
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:36,839
Whether it's chin, the boot
of a hanging man, or a piece of metal.

1072
01:23:36,927 --> 01:23:41,000
These matches strike on anything.
And it's part of the cool of the hero.

1073
01:23:41,087 --> 01:23:44,875
He's actually smoking in this sequence,
which is quite unusual.

1074
01:23:44,967 --> 01:23:50,325
You strike your match on any surface.
lt's a cool thing to do in the 1 960s.

1075
01:23:50,407 --> 01:23:55,276
Even on your teeth sometimes, in some
ltalian Westerns. Which must hurt.

1076
01:24:04,487 --> 01:24:06,842
So the coffin maker calls him Joe.

1077
01:24:06,927 --> 01:24:11,762
Now, is that his name, or is it
an all-purpose name, like John Doe?

1078
01:24:11,847 --> 01:24:17,205
Joe, Gl Joe. An American
is called Joe in a Mexican setting.

1079
01:24:17,287 --> 01:24:19,323
ls it everyman? No one's quite sure.

1080
01:24:19,407 --> 01:24:22,843
lt is quite clear, though,
that he did have a name in this film,

1081
01:24:22,927 --> 01:24:27,079
and that the United Artists publicists who
turned him into the man with no name

1082
01:24:27,407 --> 01:24:34,040
and expunged all references to his name
in the soundtrack, as far as they could,

1083
01:24:34,127 --> 01:24:38,598
is an example of a marketing department
inventing the name of the lead character.

1084
01:24:38,687 --> 01:24:43,681
Or rather, the no name of the lead
character. Unusual in modern cinema.

1085
01:24:43,767 --> 01:24:46,156
The man with no name.

1086
01:24:55,527 --> 01:24:59,042
Running gag. The coffin maker's
the only person making money.

1087
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:02,403
Since Eastwood's arrived
there's a high mortality rate.

1088
01:25:02,487 --> 01:25:06,685
l'm not sure who'll pay for all
the funerals, there's no one left to pay.

1089
01:25:06,767 --> 01:25:09,884
But the coffin maker,
played by this music-hall star,

1090
01:25:09,967 --> 01:25:15,963
is enjoying himself hugely with this.
He's going to get a lot of business.

1091
01:25:23,247 --> 01:25:26,842
So Piripero has given him
some sticks of dynamite,

1092
01:25:26,927 --> 01:25:30,522
and you might expect that
he's going to blow up the cantina,

1093
01:25:30,607 --> 01:25:33,201
he's going to blow up the Rojo residence.

1094
01:25:33,287 --> 01:25:36,802
He'll use the dynamite for some
tactical or aggressive purpose.

1095
01:25:36,887 --> 01:25:42,086
He doesn't do any of those. He uses
the dynamite to give himself presence,

1096
01:25:42,167 --> 01:25:44,761
to enhance his charisma
so that as he walks in,

1097
01:25:44,847 --> 01:25:48,886
he's going to make one of the
great entrances in Western movies.

1098
01:25:48,967 --> 01:25:53,836
By explosion, lots of dust,
the creation of dust in the sequence,

1099
01:25:53,927 --> 01:25:59,126
which, according to Leone, was based
on John Ford's My Darling Clementine,

1100
01:25:59,207 --> 01:26:01,516
where the shootout takes place in dust.

1101
01:26:01,607 --> 01:26:04,883
Dust the stagecoach has whipped up,
dust from the desert.

1102
01:26:04,967 --> 01:26:10,564
And the gunfight at the OK Corral in My
Darling Clementine is a very dusty ending.

1103
01:26:10,647 --> 01:26:14,879
There's a dusty ending here, created
by dynamite. Very theatrical entrance.

1104
01:26:30,367 --> 01:26:33,643
So the dynamite
is beefing up his charisma.

1105
01:26:33,727 --> 01:26:39,085
They won't shoot him while he's walking,
because they're so in awe of this entrance

1106
01:26:39,167 --> 01:26:42,204
that they're just gobsmacked.

1107
01:26:42,287 --> 01:26:48,920
And out of the smoke and dust comes
Joe the stranger for the final shootout.

1108
01:26:49,007 --> 01:26:52,602
What was the significance of that
metal plate he cut out and shot?

1109
01:26:52,687 --> 01:26:55,804
We're going to discover that in a minute.

1110
01:26:55,887 --> 01:26:59,357
Remember that the old Mexican
proverb says that a man with a .45

1111
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:04,316
meets a man with a rifle,
the man with the .45 is a dead man.

1112
01:27:04,407 --> 01:27:07,240
We've been told Eastwood
doesn't stand a chance,

1113
01:27:07,327 --> 01:27:10,558
we know the Rojos are well-armed,
there are several of them.

1114
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:12,922
So what's going to happen?

1115
01:27:13,007 --> 01:27:15,919
The first of Leone's big duels.

1116
01:27:16,007 --> 01:27:18,601
And the duel in
the Western was a linear thing,

1117
01:27:18,687 --> 01:27:21,360
people walk towards
each other on the street.

1118
01:27:21,447 --> 01:27:25,759
Like at the end of Stagecoach with the
Plummer brothers, or like in High Noon.

1119
01:27:25,847 --> 01:27:29,476
But this is a completely different setup.
First, the entrance.

1120
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:33,606
The explosive music of the ''Deguello''
theme played at full whack,

1121
01:27:33,687 --> 01:27:35,598
trumpet with the volume turned up.

1122
01:27:35,687 --> 01:27:39,885
The rhetoric of it, you get close-ups
of their boots to tell you who they are.

1123
01:27:39,967 --> 01:27:43,039
That's all you need to know.
Eastwood wears brown boots,

1124
01:27:43,127 --> 01:27:46,563
the Rojos wear black leather boots.
That's all you need to know.

1125
01:27:46,647 --> 01:27:48,842
There's no inner personality,

1126
01:27:48,927 --> 01:27:51,885
no psychology to these people.
You are what you wear.

1127
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:57,360
But the way the camera presents this final
shootout is almost circular, as we'll see.

1128
01:27:57,447 --> 01:27:58,596
A circle constructed

1129
01:27:58,927 --> 01:28:05,082
of close-ups of the Rojos, but also circles
created in the sky, as Ramón dies.

1130
01:28:05,567 --> 01:28:09,640
The first of Leone's circular duels,
although it isn't quite there yet.

1131
01:28:09,727 --> 01:28:14,596
That will happen in the second film,
For A Few Dollars More.

1132
01:28:30,527 --> 01:28:33,997
This is strange.
He got him with the first shot.

1133
01:28:34,087 --> 01:28:36,157
But they're apprehensive.

1134
01:28:36,687 --> 01:28:40,123
And they're right to be,
cos he gets up again.

1135
01:28:40,207 --> 01:28:46,203
This is where that metal sheet comes in.
He's wearing armour under his poncho.

1136
01:28:48,647 --> 01:28:54,483
Just like that piece of armour in the earlier
sequence, the Last Supper sequence,

1137
01:28:54,567 --> 01:28:58,446
Ramón is brilliant at aiming for the heart.
''Aim for the heart, Ramón.''

1138
01:28:58,527 --> 01:29:00,916
But like the armour, he doesn't realise it,

1139
01:29:01,007 --> 01:29:05,444
but he's aiming for a metal plate
underneath the poncho.

1140
01:29:14,927 --> 01:29:18,124
lt's illogical. All they have
to do is shoot his feet.

1141
01:29:18,207 --> 01:29:21,165
But they don't.
lt's all ritual. ''Aim for the heart.''

1142
01:29:21,247 --> 01:29:25,445
Well-known Mexican proverb. Ritual
is actually constructing what they do.

1143
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:29,520
They're not doing anything to do
with the real world, aim for his head.

1144
01:29:29,607 --> 01:29:33,885
As long as he keeps aiming
for the heart, the stranger is safe.

1145
01:29:38,447 --> 01:29:45,239
And the Rojos aren't awfully bright, they
haven't quite twigged what's going on.

1146
01:29:47,287 --> 01:29:51,200
But now, of course,
Eastwood's walked into Colt .45 range.

1147
01:29:51,287 --> 01:29:56,759
So maybe he does stand a chance. Down
the street, he wouldn't stand a chance.

1148
01:29:56,847 --> 01:30:00,965
By using these proverbs and dynamite
and charisma, sheer charisma,

1149
01:30:01,047 --> 01:30:04,676
he's managed to get within
range for a proper shootout.

1150
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:09,477
And Ramón hasn't lost his touch.
He shot all round the heart.

1151
01:30:20,607 --> 01:30:23,883
High-pitched trill on the soundtrack,
lots of close-ups.

1152
01:30:23,967 --> 01:30:26,527
Around the central fountain of San Miguel.

1153
01:30:26,607 --> 01:30:28,723
And now it turns into pure theatre.

1154
01:30:28,807 --> 01:30:30,877
Real time is suspended,

1155
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:35,802
where this turns into
just a piece of cinematic rhetoric.

1156
01:30:35,887 --> 01:30:41,439
They just stand there staring at each
other, in time-honoured Leone fashion.

1157
01:30:47,447 --> 01:30:52,043
Well, that's all of them down
except Ramón, with one go.

1158
01:30:54,767 --> 01:30:57,327
Now the odds are even.
But Piripero's not sure.

1159
01:30:57,407 --> 01:31:00,717
He's seen the stranger
do all these feats of marksmanship,

1160
01:31:00,807 --> 01:31:04,117
but he's still not quite sure
he can win. The odds are stacked

1161
01:31:04,447 --> 01:31:06,915
so heavily against him.

1162
01:31:12,287 --> 01:31:16,963
But the choruses in the film, the coffin
maker, the bartender, and the bell-ringer,

1163
01:31:17,047 --> 01:31:19,800
are the ones who survive.

1164
01:31:19,887 --> 01:31:25,837
ln fact, they're the only ones who survive.
''Let's see if the proverb is true.''

1165
01:31:29,687 --> 01:31:32,804
The stranger's been very clever,
because, of course,

1166
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:36,766
it takes a lot longer to load
a Winchester '73 than it does a Colt .45.

1167
01:31:36,847 --> 01:31:40,044
So if they place
their weapons on the ground,

1168
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:42,721
he knows that he's going to win.

1169
01:31:46,607 --> 01:31:51,203
The gun belt and the pistol grips
on the gun, which are metal snakes,

1170
01:31:51,287 --> 01:31:53,642
had been borrowed from Rawhide.

1171
01:31:53,727 --> 01:31:56,799
Eastwood brought them
to Spain as a good luck charm.

1172
01:31:56,887 --> 01:32:01,836
And wore them throughout the trilogy
of films that Leone subsequently made.

1173
01:32:01,927 --> 01:32:06,045
So we've got a Colt on the ground, and
we've got a Winchester on the ground.

1174
01:32:06,127 --> 01:32:12,282
And we're in pure theatre. The puppet
show has become pure puppets.

1175
01:32:12,367 --> 01:32:17,725
ln American Westerns, there'd
be dialogue now. lt's just sounds.

1176
01:32:18,727 --> 01:32:22,561
And it is quicker to load a Colt. This is it.

1177
01:32:22,647 --> 01:32:28,199
So extend time even more. Close-ups
of eyes, drums on the soundtrack.

1178
01:32:29,207 --> 01:32:31,198
Not extended as much as it will be.

1179
01:32:31,287 --> 01:32:33,960
This goes on for a reel
in subsequent Leone films.

1180
01:32:34,047 --> 01:32:37,596
But the dilation of time,
the stretching of time at that moment.

1181
01:32:37,687 --> 01:32:41,236
They're not talking to each other,
unlike Hollywood Westerns.

1182
01:32:41,327 --> 01:32:45,400
lt's just pure ritual, all the rituals
that precede the moment of death.

1183
01:32:45,487 --> 01:32:50,277
The moment of death itself is... lt's not
Sam Peckinpah, there's not lots of blood.

1184
01:32:50,367 --> 01:32:54,883
But here's the camera
describing circular motions in the sky.

1185
01:32:54,967 --> 01:33:00,837
And this will turn into the circular duel in
subsequent Leone films, set in a bullring.

1186
01:33:00,927 --> 01:33:04,681
This isn't the linear duel,
this is the circular one.

1187
01:33:04,767 --> 01:33:06,837
And Ramón bites the dust.

1188
01:33:11,487 --> 01:33:14,285
There's always a surprise, though.

1189
01:33:23,167 --> 01:33:27,206
A chance for Silvanito,
the bartender, to take part in this.

1190
01:33:27,287 --> 01:33:31,200
He's been detached from the squabble,
he said, ''Don't get involved.''

1191
01:33:31,287 --> 01:33:37,317
But at this moment he does get involved.
And saves the stranger.

1192
01:33:37,407 --> 01:33:39,841
And so, just as at the beginning,

1193
01:33:39,927 --> 01:33:43,158
the stranger rides into town
and the curtain of dust parts

1194
01:33:43,247 --> 01:33:45,841
and we're in this theatre of San Miguel,

1195
01:33:45,927 --> 01:33:50,557
so at the end this is just like the last scene
of some 16th or 1 7th-century tragedy,

1196
01:33:50,647 --> 01:33:54,560
with the bodies lying on the stage,
the protagonist standing there.

1197
01:33:54,647 --> 01:33:58,879
And the show is about to end,
the theatre is about to close.

1198
01:34:00,647 --> 01:34:05,357
lt's gonna be the end of the show, and out
we go from the cinema into the real world.

1199
01:34:05,447 --> 01:34:08,120
The realism of the
American Western was different.

1200
01:34:08,207 --> 01:34:11,563
lt related to everyday life.
This is myth about myth.

1201
01:34:11,647 --> 01:34:15,117
And the great ltalian novelist,
Alberto Moravia,

1202
01:34:15,447 --> 01:34:17,483
wrote about this.

1203
01:34:17,567 --> 01:34:21,037
''There is no West in ltaly,
no cowboys and bandits, no frontier,

1204
01:34:21,127 --> 01:34:23,243
no gold mines or pioneers.''

1205
01:34:23,327 --> 01:34:26,399
''The ltalian Western was born
not from memory,

1206
01:34:26,487 --> 01:34:31,925
but from the instinct of filmmakers who
were in love with the American Western.''

1207
01:34:32,007 --> 01:34:34,760
The Hollywood Western
was born from a myth.

1208
01:34:34,847 --> 01:34:38,840
The ltalian one is born
from a myth about a myth.

1209
01:34:38,927 --> 01:34:40,997
So this is a movie about the Western,

1210
01:34:41,087 --> 01:34:44,238
transposed into an ltalian
and Spanish cultural context.

1211
01:34:44,327 --> 01:34:48,525
ln one sense it's not a Western,
it's a super-Western. lt's about a Western.

1212
01:34:48,607 --> 01:34:54,637
And at the end of it, you're reminded
of its artificiality as we leave San Miguel.

1213
01:34:54,727 --> 01:34:58,276
And as Morricone's
main title track takes over,

1214
01:34:58,367 --> 01:35:02,804
Eastwood gets back on his mule,
a big man on a little animal,

1215
01:35:02,887 --> 01:35:06,641
like Shane riding off into the hills,
like Young Mr Lincoln.

1216
01:35:06,727 --> 01:35:09,605
Like Jesus riding into
Jerusalem on Palm Sunday.

1217
01:35:09,687 --> 01:35:13,362
Off he goes on his mule
for the end of the show.

1218
01:35:13,447 --> 01:35:18,123
Curtain down.
You could imagine this being in a theatre.

1219
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:24,046
No one's alive in San Miguel
except the chorus.

1220
01:35:42,407 --> 01:35:44,398
