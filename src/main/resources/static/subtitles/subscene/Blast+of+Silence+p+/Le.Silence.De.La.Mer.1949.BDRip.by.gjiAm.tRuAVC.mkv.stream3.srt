1
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:41,075
Vercors' famous novel

2
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:16,843
The Silence of the Sea

3
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,763
In memory of the murdered poet,
Saint-Pol-Roux

4
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:07,620
This film does not claim to provide
a solution to the relations...

5
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:10,622
...between France and Germany,
which will remain problematic...

6
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:12,539
...while the barbaric Nazi crimes...

7
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:17,416
...carried out with the collusion
of the German people stay in our minds

8
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:45,471
He had left like that

9
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:52,636
He submitted to life like all the others

10
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,094
Like the whole wretched nation

11
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:01,508
And I tried to remember everything
that had happened in these six months

12
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:04,633
The evenings, his words...

13
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:09,715
...the rebellion that even this man
did not have the courage to continue...

14
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,924
...against his master's orders

15
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:25,169
His arrival was preceded by a great deal
of military preparation

16
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:01,078
Later the gangling soldier came back
accompanied by another

17
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:28,445
They spoke to me
in what they thought was French

18
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,403
I didn't understand a word

19
00:04:33,152 --> 00:04:35,653
But I showed them
the unoccupied rooms

20
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,567
They seemed satisfied

21
00:04:48,566 --> 00:04:50,108
The next morning...

22
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:03,021
...an army car
made its way into the garden

23
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:29,723
Two soldiers extricated two boxes

24
00:05:56,258 --> 00:06:01,673
The car left and a few hours later
I heard horses

25
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:03,715
Three men on horseback appeared

26
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:29,209
They had pushed my workbench clamp
between stones in the wall...

27
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:36,539
...attached a rope to it and the horses
to the rope by the barn, my workshop

28
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,414
Nothing happened for the next two days

29
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,246
I didn't see anyone

30
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,787
The men left early with their horses

31
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:51,160
They returned with them in the evening,
sleeping on the straw they had put down

32
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:59,492
Then on the morning of the third day,
the army car returned

33
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,021
A pair of sheets, please

34
00:07:56,353 --> 00:08:00,893
My niece had just brought me my coffee
as she did every evening

35
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:02,685
Coffee helps me to sleep

36
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:09,392
I was sitting at the end of the room,
more or less in the dark

37
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,218
If you please

38
00:08:58,214 --> 00:09:00,463
My name is Werner von Ebrennac

39
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:04,212
I'm very sorry, I...

40
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:28,706
It was necessary, of course.
I would have avoided it, if I'd been able

41
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:35,912
My orderly will do everything he can
not to disrupt you

42
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:06,362
I have a deep respect
for people who love their country

43
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:39,938
I could go to my room now,
but I don't know the way

44
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:46,354
My niece opened the door leading
onto the stairs and started to climb...

45
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,436
...without looking at the officer
as if she was alone

46
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:52,851
The officer followed her

47
00:10:54,018 --> 00:10:56,808
I noticed that he had a limp

48
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:21,802
My niece came back down

49
00:11:56,252 --> 00:11:59,127
Thank God, he seems quite decent

50
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:18,081
Next morning the officer came down
as we were breakfasting in the kitchen

51
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,413
A different staircase leads down to it

52
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:26,787
I don't know if he'd heard us
or if he just happened to come this way

53
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,119
He said

54
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:30,245
I had a very good night

55
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:33,368
I hope yours was as good

56
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:02,278
Your old mayor said
I'd be staying at the ChĞ²teau

57
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:08,985
But I'll thank my men for getting it wrong.
It's much more beautiful here

58
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,229
He returned at the same time as before.
We were having coffee

59
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:41,603
He knocked but didn't wait for my niece
and opened the door himself

60
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:49,396
I fear I'm disturbing you

61
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:59,729
If you prefer,
I'll come in via the kitchen?

62
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:04,437
Then you can lock this door

63
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:20,604
I bid you good night

64
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:24,396
We never locked the door

65
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:29,021
I'm not sure this was for a very clear
or blameless reason

66
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:34,813
My niece and I had silently agreed
not to change our lives at all...

67
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:36,938
...not even the slightest detail

68
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:41,771
As if the officer didn't exist.
As if he were a ghost

69
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:46,064
But in my heart
there may have been another reason

70
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:51,855
It pains me to offend anyone,
even if he is my enemy

71
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:58,814
For a long time, more than a month,
the same scenario was played out

72
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,772
The officer would knock and enter

73
00:15:01,897 --> 00:15:06,106
He would say something about
the weather, the temperature

74
00:15:06,231 --> 00:15:08,855
or some such subject of little importance

75
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:12,398
Their common trait -
none of them required a response

76
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:17,230
He always lingered at the hearth.
He looked around him

77
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:22,564
A faint smile betrayed the pleasure
he took in this exercise

78
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:26,146
Always the same exercise,
always the same pleasure

79
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:30,897
His eyes rested
on my niece's bowed profile...

80
00:15:31,022 --> 00:15:34,022
...which was always severe
and impassive

81
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:37,148
When he finally took his eyes off her...

82
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:40,982
...I saw in them
a kind of smiling approval

83
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,066
I bid you good night

84
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:50,941
Things suddenly changed one evening

85
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:56,940
A light snow was falling, mixed with rain,
it would both freeze and drench you

86
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:25,029
I put the thickest logs on the fire
that had been set aside for such days

87
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:30,284
I imagined the officer outside covered in
a sprinkling of snow on his return

88
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:32,494
But he didn't return

89
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:34,832
It was long past his usual time...

90
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:38,877
...and to my annoyance
I found myself thinking about him

91
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:44,218
My niece was knitting slowly
and with great concentration

92
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:47,847
Finally we heard footsteps...

93
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:50,683
...but they came from inside the house

94
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:55,228
From the uneven sound
I could tell it was the officer

95
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:59,568
He'd come in by the other door
and was now leaving his room

96
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:04,739
He no doubt hadn't wanted to appear
inglorious in his drenched uniform

97
00:17:04,864 --> 00:17:06,952
He had first changed

98
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:10,747
The footsteps, one loud, one quiet,
came down the stairs

99
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,168
The door opened
and the officer appeared

100
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:16,297
He was in mufti

101
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:21,553
Excuse me, I'm not very warm.
I got drenched and my room is very cold

102
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:25,182
I'll warm myself by your fire
for a moment

103
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,321
That's good

104
00:17:39,906 --> 00:17:44,412
This is nothing.
The French winter is mild

105
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,958
It's hard where I'm from, very hard

106
00:17:48,918 --> 00:17:52,754
We have fir trees,
the forests are tightly packed

107
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,467
The snow sits heavy on them

108
00:17:56,341 --> 00:18:00,472
The trees here are delicate
the snow covers them like lace

109
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:06,355
Germany is like a powerful thickset bull...

110
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,609
...which needs all its strength to stay alive

111
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:16,826
Here, it's all intellect, thought,
subtle and poetic

112
00:18:27,422 --> 00:18:29,506
I've always loved France. Always

113
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:35,306
My childhood thoughts
in the last war mean nothing

114
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:38,099
But I've always loved it since

115
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:43,230
But it was from a distance.
Like the "Faraway Princess"

116
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:48,570
Because of my father

117
00:18:56,497 --> 00:18:58,583
Because of my father

118
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,255
He was very patriotic

119
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:07,050
The defeat was very painful for him

120
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:12,433
But he loved France

121
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,397
He liked Briand. He believed
in the Weimar Republic and in Briand

122
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:23,194
He was very enthusiastic

123
00:19:25,782 --> 00:19:29,993
He would say,
"He'll unite us like man and wife"

124
00:19:31,286 --> 00:19:34,707
He thought the sun
would finally rise over Europe

125
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:36,794
But Briand was defeated

126
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:42,549
My father saw that France
was still run by your cruel upper classes

127
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:48,392
Men like de Wendels, Henri Bordeaux
and the old Marshal

128
00:19:48,517 --> 00:19:52,647
He said to me, never go to France...

129
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:55,190
...unless it is in a soldier's garb

130
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:59,738
I made him that promise
because he was dying

131
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:04,702
When war broke out,
I knew all of Europe, except France

132
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:13,295
I'm a musician.
I'm not a performer, I compose music

133
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,844
It's my whole life

134
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:24,682
So it's strange for me to see myself
as a fighting man

135
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:30,939
But I don't...
I don't regret this war

136
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:36,574
No, I think
some great good will come of it

137
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:49,339
Forgive me if I have offended you
but I sincerely believe what I said

138
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:52,717
Out of love for France

139
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:56,887
Great things will come of it
for both Germany and France

140
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:02,603
I think as my father did
that the sun will shine again on Europe

141
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:18,205
I bid you good night

142
00:21:36,435 --> 00:21:40,064
Perhaps it's inhumane
to refuse to speak to him

143
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,696
I almost felt myself blush

144
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:51,269
From that day on
this was the pattern his visits took

145
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:53,686
We rarely saw him in his uniform...

146
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:58,479
...he changed first,
then knocked at our door

147
00:21:58,604 --> 00:22:01,354
Whether to spare us the enemy uniform...

148
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,147
...to make us forget
or to get to know the man?

149
00:22:05,272 --> 00:22:07,231
Both, no doubt

150
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:12,482
He knocked and entered, not waiting
for the reply he knew we wouldn't give

151
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:17,942
He did it in the most natural way
and warmed himself

152
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:23,151
This was always his excuse,
but neither he nor we believed it...

153
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:27,360
...and he did not try to disguise
its conventionality

154
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,820
He didn't come every single evening
but I don't remember one...

155
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:35,112
...when he did not talk

156
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:40,947
He leaned over the fire,
and while he warmed himself...

157
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:43,656
...his deep voice would gently rise...

158
00:22:43,782 --> 00:22:48,574
...and he would talk about the things
close to his heart...

159
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:52,075
...his country, music, France

160
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:54,867
It was always a monologue...

161
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:59,077
...as he never tried to prise from us
a response, an agreement...

162
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:01,078
...or even a look

163
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:07,913
He wouldn't speak for long,
never longer than on the first evening

164
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,914
He would say a few sentences,
sometimes broken by silence...

165
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:16,123
...sometimes linked up with the
monotonous continuity of a prayer

166
00:23:16,248 --> 00:23:20,458
He would sometimes stand motionless,
a caryatid against the chimney breast...

167
00:23:20,582 --> 00:23:25,124
...or without breaking off,
go up to an object or a picture

168
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:29,793
Then he would fall silent,
bow and bid us goodnight

169
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:41,837
Once, in the early days of his visits,
he said...

170
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,213
How is this different from
a fire at home?

171
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:51,339
The wood, the hearth, the flame
are the same, but the light is different

172
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:56,007
This one depends on the objects it lights,
the people in this room

173
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:07,259
Why do I like this room so much?

174
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:13,887
It's not so beautiful.
Oh, I'm sorry, I mean...

175
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:19,054
It's not a museum piece.
Your furniture, not beautiful artefacts...

176
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:21,722
No, but this room has a soul

177
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:26,014
The whole house has a soul

178
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:32,058
Balzac, Baudelaire, Corneille, Descartes,
FĞ¹nelon, Gautier, Hugo

179
00:24:32,183 --> 00:24:35,600
What a line-up! And I've only got to 'H'

180
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:41,434
Not as far as MoliĞ¸re, Racine, Rabelais.
Pascal, Stendhal, Voltaire, Montaigne...

181
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:42,852
...and all the others

182
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:49,979
With the English,
you immediately think of Shakespeare

183
00:24:50,104 --> 00:24:52,063
With the Italians, Dante

184
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:54,605
With Spain, Cervantes...

185
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,313
...and with us, immediately Goethe

186
00:24:57,438 --> 00:24:59,773
Then you have to stop and think...

187
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:04,816
...but if someone says France,
who immediately springs to mind?

188
00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:10,109
MoliĞ¸re? Racine? Hugo?

189
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:13,442
Voltaire? Rabelais?
Or who of the others?

190
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:21,945
They're like a crowd at a theatre entrance.
You don't know who to let in first

191
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:26,904
But in terms of music, you think of us

192
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:34,448
Bach, HĞ´ndel,
Beethoven, Wagner, Mozart

193
00:25:35,864 --> 00:25:38,199
Which name do you put first?

194
00:25:46,285 --> 00:25:49,410
And we are at war with each other!

195
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:06,080
But it is the last. We won't fight any more,
we will marry

196
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:12,249
Yes

197
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,838
It will be the most beautiful wedding
in the world

198
00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:44,381
I bid you good night

199
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:14,597
My dear, I'm going back to warm up

200
00:27:59,149 --> 00:28:01,734
But he never mentioned this meeting

201
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:11,278
When we entered Saintes,
I was happy that we got a good reception

202
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:15,986
I was very happy.
I thought it would be easy

203
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:21,113
Then I saw that it was not
that at all, it was cowardice

204
00:28:21,988 --> 00:28:25,406
I felt contempt for them
and I feared for France

205
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:28,615
I thought, "Has it really come to this?"

206
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:34,074
No, I've since seen it's not so...

207
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,034
...and now I'm happy to see
its stern expression

208
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:58,663
I'm happy to have found here
a dignified old man...

209
00:29:00,332 --> 00:29:02,414
...and a silent young lady

210
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:08,875
We have to overcome this silence,
we have to overcome France's silence

211
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm glad it's so

212
00:29:17,793 --> 00:29:19,461
Then one evening...

213
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:26,462
Yes, it's better like this, much better.
It makes for a better union

214
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:30,088
A union in which each side
grows in greatness

215
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:39,882
There's a lovely fairytale that I've read,
that you've read, that everyone has read

216
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:45,967
I don't know if the title is the same
We call it 'Das Tier und die SchÑne'...

217
00:29:46,093 --> 00:29:48,134
'Beauty and the Beast'

218
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:56,178
Poor Beauty. She is at the mercy
of the Beast, his powerless prisoner

219
00:29:56,302 --> 00:30:00,678
She is subjected to his impassive
and heavy presence all day long

220
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:06,305
Beauty is proud, dignified,
she has become hard

221
00:30:08,347 --> 00:30:13,807
But the Beast is better than it seems
It doesn't have the finest manners

222
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:16,015
It is gauche, brutal

223
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:20,517
It seems uncouth
next to the refined Beauty

224
00:30:20,975 --> 00:30:25,476
But it has a heart.
Yes, a soul which aspires to greater things

225
00:30:27,518 --> 00:30:29,185
If Beauty wanted

226
00:30:32,062 --> 00:30:34,604
Beauty takes a long time to do so

227
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:40,189
But gradually she discovers a light
in her hated captor's eyes...

228
00:30:40,314 --> 00:30:44,440
...a light where entreaty
and love are discernible

229
00:30:45,482 --> 00:30:49,649
She becomes less aware
of its heavy paw, her prison chains

230
00:30:49,774 --> 00:30:54,858
She stops hating it. Its constancy
touches her and she gives it her hand

231
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:56,943
The Beast is immediately transformed

232
00:30:57,067 --> 00:31:02,193
The spell that had trapped him
in this barbaric pelt is broken

233
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:08,529
He is a handsome knight with a pure heart,
sensitive and cultured...

234
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:13,363
...and every kiss from Beauty adorns him
with ever more glorious qualities

235
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:19,322
Their union leads
to their sublime happiness

236
00:31:20,991 --> 00:31:25,741
Their children who combine
their parents' talents...

237
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:28,117
...are the most beautiful on earth

238
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:38,370
Don't you like this fairytale?

239
00:31:39,411 --> 00:31:41,328
I've always loved it

240
00:31:41,453 --> 00:31:43,620
I'm always reading it

241
00:31:44,996 --> 00:31:47,121
It used to make me cry

242
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:52,247
I especially like the Beast
because I understood his suffering

243
00:31:52,372 --> 00:31:55,914
It still moves me today
when I talk about it

244
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:05,459
I bid you good night

245
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,306
One evening when I went up to my room
to get some tobacco...

246
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:23,232
...I heard the strains of the harmonium

247
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,432
The Eighth Prelude and Fugue my niece
had been practising before the disaster

248
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:35,856
The score stayed open at that page...

249
00:32:35,982 --> 00:32:41,416
...but until then
my niece had not practised again

250
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:45,094
I was pleased and surprised
she had gone back to it

251
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:27,442
What emotional need could have suddenly
made her take it up again?

252
00:33:47,048 --> 00:33:50,979
No, she had not left her chair or her work

253
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,512
There's nothing greater

254
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,387
Great is not quite the right word

255
00:35:46,262 --> 00:35:48,888
Beyond man, beyond his flesh

256
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:54,223
It makes us realise... no... guess... no...

257
00:35:54,348 --> 00:35:58,682
...sense what nature is...

258
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:03,100
...divine nature,
divested of the human mind

259
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:06,351
Yes, it's inhuman music

260
00:36:10,976 --> 00:36:14,353
Bach. He could only be German

261
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:19,354
Our land has this inhuman characteristic

262
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:24,563
By 'inhuman' I mean
it's not on the same scale as men

263
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:33,816
I love this music, I admire it
It overwhelms me

264
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:37,900
It is like God's presence in me

265
00:36:39,025 --> 00:36:40,734
But it's not my music

266
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:45,027
I want to compose music
on a human scale

267
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:52,404
It's a way of arriving at the truth.
My way

268
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:56,738
I don't want another,
I can't follow any other

269
00:36:56,862 --> 00:37:00,447
I know that now. I know it for sure

270
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,697
Since when?

271
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:08,740
Since I've been here

272
00:37:13,742 --> 00:37:19,661
Now I need France, but I ask a lot of her.
I ask her to welcome me

273
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:25,828
It doesn't mean anything to be here
as a foreigner, a traveller, a conqueror

274
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:31,080
She doesn't give anything
because you can't take anything from her

275
00:37:31,205 --> 00:37:35,289
Her wealth, her great wealth
will not be conquered

276
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,998
You have to drink her milk

277
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:44,249
She has to offer you her milk
like a mother

278
00:37:44,374 --> 00:37:48,709
I know that depends on us
but it depends on her, too

279
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,376
She has to be willing
to understand our thirst...

280
00:37:54,502 --> 00:37:56,544
...and to quench it

281
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,795
She has to be ready to join with us

282
00:38:04,504 --> 00:38:10,588
I need to live here for a long time,
in a house like this

283
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:16,257
Like the son of a village, a village like this
I need...

284
00:38:24,259 --> 00:38:27,968
Obstacles have to be overcome

285
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:31,261
Sincerity can always overcome obstacles

286
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:43,179
I bid you good night

287
00:38:50,474 --> 00:38:54,766
I don't remember all that was said
over a hundred winter evenings

288
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:57,892
But it was always the same

289
00:38:58,018 --> 00:39:02,227
Always his rapture
about his discovery of France

290
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:05,644
The love he had felt from afar
before coming here

291
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:11,646
The love which grew each day
since he had the good fortune to live here

292
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:24,898
And I have to say I admired him

293
00:39:25,773 --> 00:39:32,150
He never got discouraged, never tried
to break our intractable silence...

294
00:39:32,275 --> 00:39:34,359
...by any verbal outbursts

295
00:39:35,317 --> 00:39:39,611
On the contrary, when he sometimes
let the silence take over the room...

296
00:39:39,736 --> 00:39:44,446
...and seep into its corners
like a heavy unbreathable gas...

297
00:39:44,571 --> 00:39:48,904
...of the three of us,
he seemed to be most at ease

298
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:51,655
He looked approvingly at my niece...

299
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,823
...his expression
both smiling and solemn...

300
00:39:55,948 --> 00:39:58,615
...as it had been from the first day

301
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:05,907
And I felt my niece's soul struggle
in her self-imposed prison

302
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:12,035
I saw it in the little signs,
like the slight trembling of her fingers

303
00:40:16,912 --> 00:40:23,204
When Werner von Ebrennac finally
gently and smoothly broke this silence...

304
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:29,706
...with his deep voice
I felt able to breathe more easily

305
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:37,291
I was born in my house in the forest.
I went to the village school

306
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:43,752
I didn't leave it until I went to Munich for my
exams and to Salzburg for the music

307
00:40:43,877 --> 00:40:48,460
I've always lived there.
I didn't like the cities

308
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:53,795
I've been to London, Vienna,
Rome, Warsaw...

309
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:56,253
...and of course to German cities

310
00:40:57,004 --> 00:40:59,338
I wouldn't like to live there

311
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:03,963
I did like Prague.
It has a soul like no other

312
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:07,215
And Nuremberg above all else

313
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:10,301
It's the city that fills a German's heart...

314
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:14,262
...because you find ghosts
which are close to your heart...

315
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:19,142
...every stone imbued with the memory
of those who made Germany noble

316
00:41:22,101 --> 00:41:25,729
I imagine the French must feel the same
at Chartres

317
00:41:26,438 --> 00:41:29,690
They must also feel the presence
of their ancestors...

318
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:34,860
...their graciousness of spirit,
the splendour of their faith, their kindness

319
00:41:38,322 --> 00:41:40,406
Fate took me to Chartres

320
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,690
Attention!

321
00:42:26,607 --> 00:42:29,608
350 metres. Prepare

322
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:33,736
Fire!

323
00:42:38,907 --> 00:42:43,870
It's so. So many things are going on
in a German's head

324
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:48,956
Even in the best German,
and he'd be glad to be cured of them

325
00:43:01,848 --> 00:43:05,849
In the country house near us
lives a young woman

326
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:09,349
She is very beautiful and very sweet

327
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:13,601
My father would have been happy
if I had married her

328
00:43:13,726 --> 00:43:16,726
We were practically engaged
when he died...

329
00:43:16,851 --> 00:43:19,727
...and we went for long walks on our own

330
00:43:49,776 --> 00:43:53,026
One day we were in the forest and...

331
00:44:21,365 --> 00:44:23,907
I'm so happy, Werner

332
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:30,950
- All God's creations are so wonderful.
- Yes, I'm happy too

333
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,244
Wretched creature! It stung me

334
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,039
Look, I've caught it, Werner

335
00:44:45,913 --> 00:44:47,954
Now I'm going to punish it

336
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:54,165
I'll tear off its legs, one by one

337
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:05,333
Fortunately she had a lot of other suitors

338
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:07,793
I have no regrets

339
00:45:07,918 --> 00:45:11,877
But I'm terrified of German girls now

340
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:23,504
Our politicians are like that too
I never wanted anything to do with them

341
00:45:23,629 --> 00:45:28,339
Even though my friends wrote saying,
"Come and join us"

342
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:29,506
No

343
00:45:30,547 --> 00:45:32,881
I always preferred to stay at home

344
00:45:41,091 --> 00:45:46,841
It wasn't the best thing for the success
of my music, but too bad

345
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:50,635
Success counts for little
compared to a clear conscience

346
00:45:50,759 --> 00:45:56,511
I know that my friends and the FÑhrer
have the greatest and most noble ideas

347
00:45:57,553 --> 00:46:03,179
But I also know that they would tear off
mosquitoes' legs, one by one

348
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:06,846
That always happens to Germans
when they are lonely

349
00:46:06,971 --> 00:46:08,971
It always comes back

350
00:46:09,848 --> 00:46:14,348
Who is lonelier than the men in the Party
when they rule?

351
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:20,225
Fortunately they're not alone now.
They are in France

352
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,225
France will cure them

353
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,976
And they know it

354
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:30,811
They know France will teach them
to be truly great and pure-hearted

355
00:46:38,854 --> 00:46:40,854
But for that, they need love

356
00:46:41,397 --> 00:46:43,271
A shared love

357
00:46:44,854 --> 00:46:46,523
I bid you good night

358
00:46:47,689 --> 00:46:50,439
The long spring days arrived

359
00:46:50,564 --> 00:46:54,482
The officer now returned
with the last of the sun's rays

360
00:47:24,572 --> 00:47:28,073
The FÑhrer announces far-reaching
historic decisions will be made

361
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:47,703
One evening he came down,
a book closed over his finger

362
00:47:48,577 --> 00:47:52,327
He wore the suppressed half smile
of one who knows...

363
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,578
...he is about to make others happy...

364
00:47:54,703 --> 00:47:55,954
He said

365
00:47:57,914 --> 00:48:03,123
I'm sorry to disturb you so early
but I have this for you

366
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:05,374
It's from 'Macbeth'

367
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,708
Such greatness

368
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:14,292
It's at the end

369
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:20,126
Macbeth's power is slipping away
and with it the loyalty of those...

370
00:48:20,251 --> 00:48:23,460
...who finally realise
the depths of his ambition

371
00:48:24,419 --> 00:48:29,169
The noblemen who defend Scotland's
honour waiting for his imminent downfall

372
00:48:30,003 --> 00:48:33,920
One of them describes
the dramatic symptoms of this downfall

373
00:48:36,796 --> 00:48:42,589
Angus: Now does he feel
his secret murders sticking on his hands

374
00:48:43,505 --> 00:48:48,465
He is upbraided by a revolt each minute
for his breach of faith

375
00:48:49,507 --> 00:48:52,508
Those he commands
move only in command

376
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:54,301
Nothing in love

377
00:48:55,384 --> 00:48:58,676
Now does he feel his title
hang loose about him...

378
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:02,510
...like a giant's robe
upon a dwarfish thief

379
00:49:08,262 --> 00:49:11,678
That's what must give your president
some sleepless nights

380
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:19,555
I pity this man, despite the contempt
he inspires in me and in you

381
00:49:21,181 --> 00:49:25,724
Those he commands
move only in command, nothing in love

382
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:33,224
A leader who does not have the love
of his people is a miserable puppet

383
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:36,101
But can we hope for anything else?

384
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:41,644
Who but a dreary climber
would have taken on this role?

385
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:46,561
There needed to be someone
who would sell his country...

386
00:49:46,686 --> 00:49:52,314
...because today France
cannot willingly fall into our open arms...

387
00:49:52,438 --> 00:49:55,813
...without losing her dignity
in her own eyes

388
00:49:56,772 --> 00:50:03,024
Often the most sordid go-between
is responsible for the happiest union

389
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:07,774
The go-between is no less contemptible
for it, nor the union less happy

390
00:50:09,733 --> 00:50:11,442
The Paris train

391
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:15,651
I must inform my hosts
I shall be away for two weeks

392
00:50:17,985 --> 00:50:20,068
I'm delighted about going to Paris

393
00:50:20,194 --> 00:50:25,487
I have my leave and I'm going to spend it
in Paris, for the first time

394
00:50:25,612 --> 00:50:27,613
It's a big day for me

395
00:50:27,738 --> 00:50:33,615
The biggest, while I wait for another
which I hope for with all my soul

396
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:36,489
It will be an even bigger day

397
00:50:37,032 --> 00:50:40,698
I can wait. For years, if need be

398
00:50:41,783 --> 00:50:43,865
My heart is very patient

399
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,950
In Paris I'll see my friends

400
00:50:49,075 --> 00:50:52,951
Many are party to the negotiations
being conducted with your politicians...

401
00:50:53,076 --> 00:50:56,702
...in preparation for the wonderful union
of our two nations

402
00:50:56,827 --> 00:51:00,411
In a way I'll witness this marriage

403
00:51:02,328 --> 00:51:08,330
I want to tell you that I'm happy for France
whose wounds will quickly heal

404
00:51:09,954 --> 00:51:14,289
But I'm even happier for Germany
and for myself

405
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:20,957
No one will ever have benefited more
from a good deed than Germany will...

406
00:51:21,082 --> 00:51:24,958
...by restoring France's greatness
and freedom

407
00:51:34,293 --> 00:51:36,377
I bid you good night

408
00:52:56,646 --> 00:53:01,355
The French army
threatened to invade England

409
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:04,980
The Third Coalition took up arms
on the continent

410
00:53:05,106 --> 00:53:07,980
Napoleon entered Vienna,
he triumphed at Austerlitz

411
00:53:08,106 --> 00:53:11,564
In less than 100 days
the Coalition was dissolved

412
00:53:16,983 --> 00:53:22,359
I was sent here by God, King of Heaven,
to drive you out of France

413
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:54,836
We didn't see him when he returned

414
00:53:54,961 --> 00:54:00,843
We knew he was there, there are
many signs of a guest in the house...

415
00:54:00,969 --> 00:54:03,054
...even if he remains invisible

416
00:54:04,514 --> 00:54:10,105
But for a number of days,
more than a week, we didn't see him

417
00:54:11,357 --> 00:54:15,652
Should I admit to it?
This absence troubled me

418
00:54:16,613 --> 00:54:18,615
I thought about him

419
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:21,493
I think I felt regret and concern

420
00:54:23,997 --> 00:54:27,083
Neither my niece nor I spoke of it

421
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:32,549
But when in the evening,
we heard his uneven tread...

422
00:54:33,591 --> 00:54:38,556
...I saw from the way she suddenly and
stubbornly applied herself to her work...

423
00:54:38,681 --> 00:54:41,352
...and from the faint lines
on her face...

424
00:54:41,477 --> 00:54:45,608
...giving her an expression that was
both determined and expectant...

425
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:49,319
...that her thoughts were similar to mine

426
00:54:56,245 --> 00:55:01,710
I had to go to the German headquarters
to make some declaration about tyres

427
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:24,446
Come in

428
00:55:38,754 --> 00:55:40,842
For a free Europe

429
00:56:12,757 --> 00:56:14,885
What do you want?

430
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:16,428
Lieutenant

431
00:56:16,553 --> 00:56:19,890
- Make five copies and send them one.
- Yes, Lieutenant

432
00:56:57,686 --> 00:57:03,651
I didn't say anything about it to my niece,
but women have a feline intuition

433
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:09,827
All evening she kept looking up
from her work...

434
00:57:09,953 --> 00:57:16,293
...and looking at me
trying to discern something in my face...

435
00:57:16,419 --> 00:57:22,301
...which I forced into an expressionless
blank by diligently drawing on my pipe

436
00:57:33,564 --> 00:57:38,153
She finally dropped her hands
as if she was tired...

437
00:57:50,251 --> 00:57:55,008
...and folding the material asked for
my permission to go to bed early

438
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:17,994
She kissed me and I think I saw
in her beautiful grey eyes...

439
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:22,000
...a reproach and a heavy sadness

440
00:58:23,585 --> 00:58:28,548
Once she had left
I felt an absurd anger rise in me

441
00:58:28,674 --> 00:58:32,762
Anger at being absurd
and having an absurd niece

442
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:37,894
What was this stupidity?
I couldn't answer that

443
00:58:38,394 --> 00:58:43,109
If it was stupidity
it seemed to be deeply ingrained

444
00:59:39,053 --> 00:59:43,725
Three days later,
just as we were finishing our coffee...

445
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:48,565
...we heard the familiar footsteps
with their irregular tread...

446
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,777
...coming in our direction

447
00:59:53,279 --> 00:59:58,077
I suddenly remembered that winter evening
when we had first heard his footsteps...

448
00:59:58,202 --> 01:00:00,288
...six months earlier

449
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:03,416
I thought, it's raining today too

450
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:08,589
My niece had put a square of printed silk
around her shoulders

451
01:00:08,714 --> 01:00:14,305
I was warming my hands on the bowl
of my pipe and it was summer!

452
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:18,268
I thought I could see a man
behind the door...

453
01:00:18,393 --> 01:00:21,230
...his forefinger raised, ready to knock...

454
01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:24,609
...and delaying the moment...

455
01:00:24,735 --> 01:00:29,701
...for by the very act of knocking,
he would set in motion the future

456
01:00:31,576 --> 01:00:33,663
Finally he knocked

457
01:00:35,749 --> 01:00:41,463
Not with the lightness of one hesitating
nor the brusqueness of shyness overcome

458
01:00:41,588 --> 01:00:44,675
They were three full and long knocks

459
01:00:44,801 --> 01:00:49,390
Calm, assured knocks of a decision
on which there was no going back

460
01:00:50,265 --> 01:00:54,563
I was expecting to see the door open
immediately as usual

461
01:00:55,438 --> 01:01:01,362
But it remained shut and I was overcome
by an uncontrollable uneasiness

462
01:01:09,956 --> 01:01:12,042
He's going to leave

463
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:23,057
What should I do to behave with dignity
on this evening?

464
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:30,732
Come in, sir

465
01:01:42,747 --> 01:01:46,503
I learned then that the hands,
if you observe them well...

466
01:01:46,628 --> 01:01:49,839
...can be as expressive as the face

467
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:53,092
Even better than the face...

468
01:01:53,217 --> 01:01:56,389
...as they more easily escape
the control of the will

469
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:24,173
I have something serious to tell you

470
01:03:00,635 --> 01:03:03,765
Everything I have said
these past six months

471
01:03:05,392 --> 01:03:09,020
Everything the walls of this room
have heard...

472
01:03:14,903 --> 01:03:16,780
...you have to...

473
01:03:18,363 --> 01:03:20,242
...you have to forget

474
01:03:32,884 --> 01:03:34,928
Such a light!

475
01:03:52,492 --> 01:03:54,537
I saw these victorious men

476
01:03:56,538 --> 01:03:58,624
I spoke to them

477
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:01,961
They laughed at me

478
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:09,971
I had been so happy to go there

479
01:04:58,747 --> 01:05:00,663
Treblinka?

480
01:05:00,788 --> 01:05:04,123
- Yes, what about it?
- What's the significance of Treblinka?

481
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:07,667
- Nothing, nothing now.
- Why "not any more"?

482
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:12,791
Let's not talk about that.
It's not for the faint-hearted

483
01:05:26,087 --> 01:05:31,339
<i>The mass executions take place
in the gas chambers constructed here...</i>

484
01:05:31,464 --> 01:05:35,798
<i>... with carbon monoxide
and in the cremation ovens</i>

485
01:05:35,923 --> 01:05:40,593
<i>There is currently
a throughput of 500 people a day...</i>

486
01:05:41,508 --> 01:05:44,634
<i>... but improvements are underway...</i>

487
01:05:44,759 --> 01:05:47,385
<i>... so that whithin two months...</i>

488
01:05:47,509 --> 01:05:52,179
<i>... this figure can be increased
to 2,000 people a day</i>

489
01:05:54,304 --> 01:05:57,971
<i>Treblinka, 21 March, 1941</i>

490
01:05:58,804 --> 01:06:00,680
The start of spring!

491
01:06:02,722 --> 01:06:04,598
The start of spring!

492
01:06:08,558 --> 01:06:11,683
So these gas chambers
are currently in use

493
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:18,477
No, Treblinka has already
served its purpose. It's done with

494
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:23,270
There's no one left to execute

495
01:06:41,983 --> 01:06:46,858
Chemical examination post
Medical centre

496
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,760
I'm surprised by your opinion on this

497
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:25,259
Haven't you realised
that we're duping them?

498
01:10:25,385 --> 01:10:29,553
Do you think we're foolish enough
to let France rise up again?

499
01:10:32,763 --> 01:10:34,932
We're not musicians

500
01:10:35,057 --> 01:10:40,143
Politics isn't the stuff of fantasy.
Why do you think we went to war?

501
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:44,270
- For the sake of their old Marshal?
- We're not mad

502
01:10:44,395 --> 01:10:48,854
We have the opportunity to destroy
France and that's what we will do

503
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,106
Not just its power, but its spirit as well

504
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:56,942
That's where the greatest danger lies.
That's our duty

505
01:10:57,066 --> 01:11:02,611
Make no mistake,
we'll do it with smiles and with care...

506
01:11:02,736 --> 01:11:05,612
...but we'll make France crawl on its belly

507
01:11:05,737 --> 01:11:10,239
You've been too influenced by France
in your youth, that's the danger...

508
01:11:10,364 --> 01:11:14,992
...but we'll cure Europe of this disease,
we'll root out this poison

509
01:11:15,118 --> 01:11:18,244
We'll flatter the writers of course...

510
01:11:18,369 --> 01:11:21,121
...but we've already taken
the necessary measures

511
01:11:21,246 --> 01:11:25,872
In Belgium and Holland
and in every country we occupy

512
01:11:25,996 --> 01:11:32,792
French books will be allowed
except technical publications

513
01:11:32,918 --> 01:11:36,127
There will be no literary works.
None!

514
01:11:36,252 --> 01:11:38,837
We'll rip the venom from the beast

515
01:11:39,794 --> 01:11:41,546
Getting frightened

516
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:47,590
Now they fear for their pockets,
their stomachs, their industry and trade

517
01:11:49,175 --> 01:11:51,010
That's all they're worried about

518
01:11:51,135 --> 01:11:57,429
There are exceptions, of course,
but we'll flatter them to death

519
01:11:58,638 --> 01:12:02,433
- Nothing could be easier.
- Just for a plate of lentils

520
01:12:02,558 --> 01:12:04,851
Do you realise what you're doing?

521
01:12:06,267 --> 01:12:09,852
- Do you realise?
- Do you think we'll falter?

522
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:12,020
We're made of stronger stuff

523
01:12:14,022 --> 01:12:17,982
You will seal France's downfall
forever

524
01:12:18,607 --> 01:12:21,901
It's a matter of life and death

525
01:12:22,025 --> 01:12:25,567
Violence can conquer but it cannot rule

526
01:12:25,692 --> 01:12:30,403
We know that.
It takes more than an army to rule

527
01:12:30,528 --> 01:12:34,571
Not at the price of the spirit
Not at that price

528
01:12:34,696 --> 01:12:38,449
The spirit? It has already seen a lot

529
01:12:38,574 --> 01:12:43,617
The spirit is immortal.
We're building a thousand year Reich

530
01:12:43,742 --> 01:12:45,535
First we have to destroy

531
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:48,704
That's our right and our duty

532
01:13:20,385 --> 01:13:23,887
On September 19, 1941
another German soldier was murdered

533
01:13:24,012 --> 01:13:27,931
To atone for this cowardly crime
the following were shot

534
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:46,095
Wait a moment

535
01:14:56,889 --> 01:14:58,766
A box of matches, please

536
01:15:16,859 --> 01:15:18,942
There is no hope

537
01:15:19,693 --> 01:15:21,363
No hope

538
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:33,576
Nothing

539
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:36,785
No one

540
01:15:36,909 --> 01:15:42,829
Not just the modern authors.
Not just PĞ¹guy, Proust, Bergson

541
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:47,665
But all the others, all of these.
All of them

542
01:15:55,627 --> 01:15:57,712
They will extinguish the light

543
01:15:58,628 --> 01:16:00,296
Completely

544
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,049
That light will never shine again on Europe

545
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:18,054
One of these men was my friend

546
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:20,264
He was like a brother

547
01:16:20,722 --> 01:16:25,308
We studied together.
We shared a room in Stuttgart

548
01:16:27,601 --> 01:16:30,185
We spent three months together
in Nuremberg

549
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:35,438
I played him my music

550
01:16:35,563 --> 01:16:37,647
He read me his poems

551
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:41,816
He was sensitive and romantic

552
01:16:45,109 --> 01:16:46,777
But he left me

553
01:16:47,693 --> 01:16:51,987
He went to read his poems in MÑnchen,
in Munich

554
01:16:52,111 --> 01:16:54,281
To new friends

555
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:57,906
He was always writing
asking me to join him

556
01:17:00,242 --> 01:17:04,161
It was he I saw in Paris with his friends

557
01:17:04,952 --> 01:17:07,829
I saw what they had done to him

558
01:17:09,371 --> 01:17:13,499
He was the angriest of them all
He combined anger and laughter

559
01:17:15,791 --> 01:17:21,336
He shouted "It's venomous, we have
to extract the venom from the beast"

560
01:17:24,128 --> 01:17:28,047
I said,
"Do you realise what you're doing?"

561
01:17:30,173 --> 01:17:33,925
I looked at him,
I looked into his bright eyes

562
01:17:35,092 --> 01:17:38,634
He meant what he said,
that's the worst part

563
01:17:40,386 --> 01:17:42,301
They will do what they say...

564
01:17:43,346 --> 01:17:45,429
...methodically and resolutely

565
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:48,848
I know these stubborn devils

566
01:17:56,017 --> 01:18:00,729
His lips opened and I thought he was
going to launch into some exhortation

567
01:18:00,854 --> 01:18:04,522
I thought he was going to encourage us
to rebel

568
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:07,733
But no word passed his lips

569
01:18:11,858 --> 01:18:15,444
They said to me,
"It's our right and our duty"

570
01:18:17,695 --> 01:18:19,779
"Our duty"

571
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:24,990
Lucky the man
who so easily finds the path to his duty

572
01:18:30,118 --> 01:18:33,078
At the crossroads, you're told,
take that route

573
01:18:34,953 --> 01:18:39,748
This route does not take you
towards the shining heights...

574
01:18:41,791 --> 01:18:46,002
...it descends into a gloomy valley...

575
01:18:46,127 --> 01:18:50,169
...deep into the dark, dank forest

576
01:18:57,922 --> 01:19:03,093
Oh God, show me where my duty lies

577
01:19:16,766 --> 01:19:19,725
Can duty ever mean accepting the crime?

578
01:19:37,609 --> 01:19:42,527
I've exercised my rights.
I've asked to join a fighting division

579
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:46,237
They've finally agreed to it

580
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:53,158
I'm authorised to leave tomorrow
and return to battle

581
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:00,786
Towards Hell

582
01:20:17,336 --> 01:20:19,047
I bid you good night

583
01:20:25,924 --> 01:20:27,175
Goodbye

584
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,971
Goodbye

585
01:20:37,764 --> 01:20:41,557
You'd have to have been waiting
to have heard this word

586
01:20:41,682 --> 01:20:46,351
But finally I heard it.
Von Ebrennac heard it, too

587
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:32,077
Take my things downstairs

588
01:23:20,517 --> 01:23:25,770
It is a fine thing when a soldier disobeys
criminal orders

589
01:23:47,154 --> 01:23:48,447
All set, Lieutenant

590
01:23:57,409 --> 01:23:59,867
Yes, I'm coming

591
01:24:50,601 --> 01:24:53,978
My niece had made me breakfast
as usual

592
01:24:55,104 --> 01:24:57,230
She served me in silence

593
01:24:58,438 --> 01:25:00,647
We drank our coffee in silence

594
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:16,490
Outside a pale sun was shining
through the mist

595
01:25:17,991 --> 01:25:21,492
It felt very cold to me

596
01:25:29,454 --> 01:25:35,499
It felt very cold to me
October 1941

597
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:40,667
The publication of this book
was funded by a patriot

598
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:45,711
The printing was completed under
Nazi Occupation on 20 February 1942
