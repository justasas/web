00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,030
<i>Vercors' famous novel</i>

2
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,353
<i>The Silence of the Sea</i>

3
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,117
In memory of the murdered poet,
Saint-Pol-Roux

4
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,072
This film does not claim to provide
a solution to the relations...

5
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,953
...between France and Germany,
which will remain problematic...

6
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,798
...while the barbaric Nazi crimes...

7
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,471
...carried out with the collusion
of the German people stay in our minds

8
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,390
He had left like that

9
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,276
He submitted to life like all the others

10
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,593
Like the whole wretched nation

11
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,794
And I tried to remember everything
that had happened in these six months

12
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,798
The evenings, his words

13
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,675
...the rebellion that even this man
did not have the courage to continue

14
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,791
against his master's orders

15
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,517
His arrival was preceded by a great deal
of military preparation

16
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,998
Later the gangling soldier came back
accompanied by another

17
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,273
They spoke to me
in what they thought was French

18
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,152
I didn't understand a word

19
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,189
But I showed them
the unoccupied rooms

20
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,917
They seemed satisfied

21
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,079
The next morning...

22
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,476
...an army car
made its way into the garden

23
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,116
Two soldiers extricated two boxes

24
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,799
The car left and a few hours later
I heard horses

25
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,751
Three men on horseback appeared

26
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,239
They had pushed my workbench clamp
between stones in the wall...

27
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,276
...attached a rope to it and the horses
to the rope by the barn, my workshop

28
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,998
Nothing happened for the next two days

29
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,758
I didn't see anyone

30
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,153
The men left early with their horses

31
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,308
They returned with them in the evening,
sleeping on the straw they had put down

32
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,311
Then on the morning of the third day,
the army car returned

33
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,868
A pair of sheets, please

34
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,277
My niece had just brought me my coffee
as she did every evening

35
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,992
Coffee helps me to sleep

36
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,437
I was sitting at the end of the room,
more or less in the dark

37
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,158
If you please

38
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,470
My name is Werner von Ebrennac

39
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,072
I'm very sorry, I...

40
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,595
It was necessary, of course.
I would have avoided it, if I'd been able

41
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,518
My orderly will do everything he can
not to disrupt you

42
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,758
I have a deep respect
for people who love their country

43
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,992
I could go to my room now,
but I don't know the way

44
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,153
My niece opened the door leading
onto the stairs and started to climb...

45
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,068
...without looking at the officer
as if she was alone

46
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,399
The officer followed her

47
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,193
I noticed that he had a limp

48
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,191
My niece came back down

49
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,033
Thank God, he seems quite decent

50
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,231
Next morning the officer came down
as we were breakfasting in the kitchen

51
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,435
A different staircase leads down to it

52
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,588
I don't know if he'd heard us
or if he just happened to come this way

53
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,869
He said

54
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,911
I had a very good night

55
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,915
I hope yours was as good

56
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,675
Your old mayor said
I'd be staying at the ChÃ¢teau

57
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,113
But I'll thank my men for getting it wrong.
It's much more beautiful here

58
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,116
He returned at the same time as before.
We were having coffee

59
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,239
He knocked but didn't wait for my niece
and opened the door himself

60
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,711
I fear I'm disturbing you

61
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,637
If you prefer,
I'll come in via the kitchen?

62
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,155
Then you can lock this door

63
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,672
I bid you good night

64
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,310
We never locked the door

65
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,752
I'm not sure this was for a very clear
or blameless reason

66
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,315
My niece and I had silently agreed
not to change our lives at all...

67
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,351
...not even the slightest detail

68
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,996
As if the officer didn't exist.
As if he were a ghost

69
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,113
But in my heart
there may have been another reason

70
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,671
It pains me to offend anyone,
even if he is my enemy

71
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,352
For a long time, more than a month,
the same scenario was played out

72
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,199
The officer would knock and enter

73
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,359
He would say something about
the weather, the temperature

74
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,994
or some such subject of little importance

75
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,396
Their common trait -
none of them required a response

76
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,029
He always lingered at the hearth.
He looked around him

77
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,154
A faint smile betrayed the pleasure
he took in this exercise

78
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,590
Always the same exercise,
always the same pleasure

79
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,149
His eyes rested
on my niece's bowed profile...

80
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,158
...which was always severe
and impassive

81
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,158
When he finally took his eyes off her...

82
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,829
...I saw in them
a kind of smiling approval

83
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,837
I bid you good night

84
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,399
Things suddenly changed one evening

85
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,152
A light snow was falling, mixed with rain,
it would both freeze and drench you

86
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,398
I put the thickest logs on the fire
that had been set aside for such days

87
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,435
I imagined the officer outside covered in
a sprinkling of snow on his return

88
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,551
But he didn't return

89
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,796
It was long past his usual time...

90
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,674
...and to my annoyance
I found myself thinking about him

91
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,789
My niece was knitting slowly
and with great concentration

92
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,269
Finally we heard footsteps...

93
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,994
...but they came from inside the house

94
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,352
From the uneven sound
I could tell it was the officer

95
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,519
He'd come in by the other door
and was now leaving his room

96
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,475
He no doubt hadn't wanted to appear
inglorious in his drenched uniform

97
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,591
He had first changed

98
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,235
The footsteps, one loud, one quiet,
came down the stairs

99
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,508
The door opened
and the officer appeared

100
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,551
He was in mufti

101
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,595
Excuse me, I'm not very warm.
I got drenched and my room is very cold

102
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,076
I'll warm myself by your fire
for a moment

103
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,717
That's good

104
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,512
This is nothing.
The French winter is mild

105
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,908
It's hard where I'm from, very hard

106
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,515
We have fir trees,
the forests are tightly packed

107
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,117
The snow sits heavy on them

108
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,919
The trees here are delicate
the snow covers them like lace

109
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,551
Germany is like a powerful thickset bull...

110
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,672
...which needs all its strength to stay alive

111
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,595
Here, it's all intellect, thought,
subtle and poetic

112
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,751
I've always loved France. Always

113
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,319
My childhood thoughts
in the last war mean nothing

114
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,000
But I've always loved it since

115
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,909
But it was from a distance.
Like the "Faraway Princess"

116
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,031
Because of my father

117
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,631
Because of my father

118
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,112
He was very patriotic

119
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,759
The defeat was very painful for him

120
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,915
But he loved France

121
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,670
He liked Briand. He believed
in the Weimar Republic and in Briand

122
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,231
He was very enthusiastic

123
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,759
He would say,
"He'll unite us like man and wife"

124
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,276
He thought the sun
would finally rise over Europe

125
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,277
But Briand was defeated

126
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,793
My father saw that France
was still run by your cruel upper classes

127
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,392
Men like de Wendels, Henri Bordeaux
and the old Marshal

128
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,479
He said to me, never go to France...

129
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,909
...unless it is in a soldier's garb

130
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,277
I made him that promise
because he was dying

131
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,028
When war broke out,
I knew all of Europe, except France

132
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,276
I'm a musician.
I'm not a performer, I compose music

133
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,597
It's my whole life

134
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,189
So it's strange for me to see myself
as a fighting man

135
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,199
But I don't ...
I don't regret this war

136
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,599
No, I think
some great good will come of it

137
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,832
Forgive me if I have offended you
but I sincerely believe what I said

138
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,075
Out of love for France

139
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,079
Great things will come of it
for both Germany and France

140
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,551
I think as my father did
that the sun will shine again on Europe

141
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,518
I bid you good night

142
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,470
Perhaps it's inhumane
to refuse to speak to him

143
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,874
I almost felt myself blush

144
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,039
From that day on
this was the pattern his visits took

145
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,355
We rarely saw him in his uniform...

146
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,951
...he changed first,
then knocked at our door

147
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,719
Whether to spare us the enemy uniform...

148
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,355
...to make us forget
or to get to know the man?

149
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,357
Both, no doubt

150
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,395
He knocked and entered, not waiting
for the reply he knew we wouldn't give

151
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,631
He did it in the most natural way
and warmed himself

152
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,629
This was always his excuse,
but neither he nor we believed it...

153
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,673
...and he did not try to disguise
its conventionality

154
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,912
He didn't come every single evening
but I don't remember one...

155
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,110
...when he did not talk

156
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,712
He leaned over the fire,
and while he warmed himself...

157
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,308
...his deep voice would gently rise...

158
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,036
...and he would talk about the things
close to his heart...

159
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,391
...his country, music, France

160
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,070
It was always a monologue...

161
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,113
...as he never tried to prise from us
a response, an agreement...

162
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,037
...or even a look

163
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,588
He wouldn't speak for long,
never longer than on the first evening

164
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,429
He would say a few sentences,
sometimes broken by silence...

165
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,473
...sometimes linked up with the
monotonous continuity of a prayer

166
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,639
He would sometimes stand motionless,
a caryatid against the chimney breast...

167
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,117
...or without breaking off,
go up to an object or a picture

168
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,597
Then he would fall silent,
bow and bid us goodnight

169
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,148
Once, in the early days of his visits,
he said...

170
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,397
How is this different from
a fire at home?

171
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:56,278
The wood, the hearth, the flame
are the same, but the light is different

172
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,757
This one depends on the objects it lights,
the people in this room

173
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,560
Why do I like this room so much?

174
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,909
It's not so beautiful.
Oh, I'm sorry, I mean...

175
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,872
It's not a museum piece.
Your furniture, not beautiful artefacts...

176
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,434
No, but this room has a soul

177
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,550
The whole house has a soul

178
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,357
Balzac, Baudelaire, Corneille, Descartes,
FÃ©nelon, Gautier, Hugo

179
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,756
What a line-up! And I've only got to 'H'

180
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,352
Not as far as MoliÃ¨re, Racine, Rabelais.
Pascal, Stendhal, Voltaire, Montaigne...

181
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,708
...and all the others

182
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,557
With the English,
you immediately think of Shakespeare

183
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,557
With the Italians, Dante

184
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,989
With Spain, Cervantes...

185
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,588
...and with us, immediately Goethe

186
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,950
Then you have to stop and think...

187
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,790
...but if someone says France,
who immediately springs to mind?

188
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,876
MoliÃ¨re? Racine? Hugo?

189
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,072
Voltaire? Rabelais?
Or who of the others?

190
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,230
They're like a crowd at a theatre entrance.
You don't know who to let in first

191
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,997
But in terms of music, you think of us

192
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,237
Bach, HÃ¤ndel,
Beethoven, Wagner, Mozart

193
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,830
Which name do you put first?

194
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,592
And we are at war with each other!

195
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,588
But it is the last. We won't fight any more,
we will marry

196
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,519
Yes

197
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,114
It will be the most beautiful wedding
in the world

198
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,357
I bid you good night

199
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,359
My dear, I'm going back to warm up

200
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,588
But he never mentioned this meeting

201
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,758
When we entered Saintes,
I was happy that we got a good reception

202
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,271
I was very happy.
I thought it would be easy

203
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,190
Then I saw that it was not
that at all, it was cowardice

204
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,316
I felt contempt for them
and I feared for France

205
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,398
I thought, "Has it really come to this?"

206
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,637
No, I've since seen it's not so...

207
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,390
...and now I'm happy to see
its stern expression

208
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,236
I'm happy to have found here
a dignified old man...

209
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,831
...and a silent young lady

210
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,030
We have to overcome this silence,
we have to overcome France's silence

211
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,031
I'm glad it's so

212
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,192
Then one evening...

213
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,910
Yes, it's better like this, much better.
It makes for a better union

214
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,396
A union in which each side
grows in greatness

215
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:30,796
There's a lovely fairytale that I've read,
that you've read, that everyone has read

216
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:36,631
I don't know if the title is the same
We call it 'Das Tier und die SchÃ¶ne'...

217
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,716
'Beauty and the Beast'

218
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:46,434
Poor Beauty. She is at the mercy
of the Beast, his powerless prisoner

219
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,758
She is subjected to his impassive
and heavy presence all day long

220
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,158
Beauty is proud, dignified,
she has become hard

221
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,353
But the Beast is better than it seems
It doesn't have the finest manners

222
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,471
It is gauche, brutal

223
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,793
It seems uncouth
next to the refined Beauty

224
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,552
But it has a heart.
Yes, a soul which aspires to greater things

225
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,112
If Beauty wanted

226
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,314
Beauty takes a long time to do so

227
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,673
But gradually she discovers a light
in her hated captor's eyes...

228
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,759
...a light where entreaty
and love are discernible

229
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,753
She becomes less aware
of its heavy paw, her prison chains

230
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,749
She stops hating it. Its constancy
touches her and she gives it her hand

231
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,757
The Beast is immediately transformed

232
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,795
The spell that had trapped him
in this barbaric pelt is broken

233
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,870
He is a handsome knight with a pure heart,
sensitive and cultured...

234
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,516
...and every kiss from Beauty adorns him
with ever more glorious qualities

235
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,233
Their union leads
to their sublime happiness

236
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,391
Their children who combine
their parents' talents...

237
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,670
...are the most beautiful on earth

238
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,511
Don't you like this fairytale?

239
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,351
I've always loved it

240
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,550
I'm always reading it

241
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,916
It used to make me cry

242
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,833
I especially like the Beast
because I understood his suffering

243
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,350
It still moves me today
when I talk about it

244
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,517
I bid you good night

245
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,358
One evening when I went up to my room
to get some tobacco...

246
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,153
...I heard the strains of the harmonium

247
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,915
The Eighth Prelude and Fugue my niece
had been practising before the disaster

248
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,235
The score stayed open at that page...

249
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,559
...but until then
my niece had not practised again

250
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,070
I was pleased and surprised
she had gone back to it

251
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,596
What emotional need could have suddenly
made her take it up again?

252
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,114
No, she had not left her chair or her work

253
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,870
There's nothing greater

254
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,600
Great is not quite the right word

255
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,954
Beyond man, beyond his flesh

256
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,074
It makes us realise... no... guess... no...

257
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,352
...sense what nature is...

258
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,598
...divine nature,
divested of the human mind

259
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,712
Yes, it's inhuman music

260
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,391
Bach. He could only be German

261
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,195
Our land has this inhuman characteristic

262
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,193
By 'inhuman' I mean
it's not on the same scale as men

263
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,078
I love this music, I admire it
It overwhelms me

264
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,988
It is like God's presence in me

265
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,718
But it's not my music

266
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,836
I want to compose music
on a human scale

267
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,911
It's a way of arriving at the truth.
My way

268
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,079
I don't want another,
I can't follow any other

269
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,636
I know that now. I know it for sure

270
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,752
Since when?

271
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,591
Since I've been here

272
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,077
Now I need France, but I ask a lot of her.
I ask her to welcome me

273
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,000
It doesn't mean anything to be here
as a foreigner, a traveller, a conqueror

274
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,029
She doesn't give anything
because you can't take anything from her

275
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,073
Her wealth, her great wealth
will not be conquered

276
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,634
You have to drink her milk

277
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,675
She has to offer you her milk
like a mother

278
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,952
I know that depends on us
but it depends on her, too

279
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,433
She has to be willing
to understand our thirst...

280
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,476
...and to quench it

281
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,557
She has to be ready to join with us

282
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:40,956
I need to live here for a long time,
in a house like this

283
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,398
Like the son of a village, a village like this
I need...

284
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,629
Obstacles have to be overcome

285
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,797
Sincerity can always overcome obstacles

286
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,237
I bid you good night

287
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,358
I don't remember all that was said
over a hundred winter evenings

288
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,350
But it was always the same

289
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,519
Always his rapture
about his discovery of France

290
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,791
The love he had felt from afar
before coming here

291
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,552
The love which grew each day
since he had the good fortune to live here

292
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,273
And I have to say I admired him

293
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:59,229
He never got discouraged, never tried
to break our intractable silence...

294
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,351
...by any verbal outbursts

295
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,398
On the contrary, when he sometimes
let the silence take over the room...

296
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,036
...and seep into its corners
like a heavy unbreathable gas...

297
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,312
...of the three of us,
he seemed to be most at ease

298
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,954
He looked approvingly at my niece...

299
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,959
...his expression
both smiling and solemn...

300
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,640
...as it had been from the first day

301
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,636
And I felt my niece's soul struggle
in her self-imposed prison

302
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,517
I saw it in the little signs,
like the slight trembling of her fingers

303
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,230
When Werner von Ebrennac finally
gently and smoothly broke this silence...

304
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:54,469
...with his deep voice
I felt able to breathe more easily

305
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,756
I was born in my house in the forest.
I went to the village school

306
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,955
I didn't leave it until I went to Munich for my
exams and to Salzburg for the music

307
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,471
I've always lived there.
I didn't like the cities

308
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,594
I've been to London, Vienna,
Rome, Warsaw...

309
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,950
...and of course to German cities

310
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,910
I wouldn't like to live there

311
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,348
I did like Prague.
It has a soul like no other

312
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,476
And Nuremberg above all else

313
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,433
It's the city that fills a German's heart...

314
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,235
...because you find ghosts
which are close to your heart...

315
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,911
...every stone imbued with the memory
of those who made Germany noble

316
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,230
I imagine the French must feel the same
at Chartres

317
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,037
They must also feel the presence
of their ancestors...

318
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,995
...their graciousness of spirit,
the splendour of their faith, their kindness

319
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,311
Fate took me to Chartres

320
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,759
Attention!

321
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,518
350 metres. Prepare

322
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,474
Fire!

323
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,195
It's so. So many things are going on
in a German's head

324
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:08,075
Even in the best German,
and he'd be glad to be cured of them

325
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,034
In the country house near us
lives a young woman

326
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,400
She is very beautiful and very sweet

327
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,470
My father would have been happy
if I had married her

328
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,478
We were practically engaged
when he died...

329
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,353
...and we went for long walks on our own

330
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,317
One day we were in the forest and...

331
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,954
I'm so happy, Werner

332
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,719
- All God's creations are so wonderful.
- Yes, I'm happy too

333
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,636
Wretched creature! It stung me

334
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,235
Look, I've caught it, Werner

335
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,036
Now I'm going to punish it

336
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,996
I'll tear off its legs, one by one

337
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,718
Fortunately she had a lot of other suitors

338
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,070
I have no regrets

339
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,988
But I'm terrified of German girls now

340
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:35,156
Our politicians are like that too
