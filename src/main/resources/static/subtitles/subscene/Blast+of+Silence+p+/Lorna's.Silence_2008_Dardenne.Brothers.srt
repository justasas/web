I beg you.

130
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,228

- Above the cabinet, among my things.

150
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,065
Put it into my pocket.

151
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,069
Is there someone to look after me?.

152
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,039
The admissions officer said that you send a nurse.
I'm going.

153
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,010
Tomorrow I bring the
CD reader and CDs?.

154
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:17,018
- Do not leave me alone.
- It is a nurse.

155
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,057
Expects me.

00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,058
Please.

157
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,996
Yes, low.

158
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,210
- I'm waiting in the taxi.
- Okay.

159
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,087
- Claudy Moreau?.
- Room 110.

160
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,214
The visiting hours are from 16 to 19.

161
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,289
Do not come to visit,
bring a health card.

162
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,030
- Go to admissions, ground floor.
- Okay.

163
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,033
- Can you give these things personal?.
- Is your wife?.

164
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,035

168
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,274
Ask for divorce, as he
had led to believe.

169
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,108
No.

170
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,178
Why?.

171
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:18,096
We had chosen a junkie
to prevent divorce.

172
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:20,154
And it would take too much.

173
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,263
What if the Russian is in agreement
delaying marriage?.

174
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,108
I have set for June I gave my word.

175
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:34,136
Dale andalusia wipers.

00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,182
The button on the left.

177
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,052
Basta.

178
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,223
Now I find myself on a faster
to obtain a divorce.

179
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,036
And who pays 5,000 euros
andalusia drogata?.

180
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,107
I have 5000 of 10,000 euros
I was given the Russian.

181
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:07,110
- Are you engaged with him or what?.
- I was sweating. I am with Sokol.

182
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,205
- And why did you miss the back?.
- I do not echo back.

183
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,149
But to stop the drug and then
die overdose is strange.

184
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,185
I told you no.

185
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:20,124
Almost everyone left and
then back again.

186
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:26,095
Divorce has many risks, it
is best to stay widow.

187
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,044
Sokol,!

188
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,255
I was afraid you'd gone.

189
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,263
The minibus to Germany
has not reached yet.

190
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,265
- Okay without a beard.
- Really?.

191
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,041
- Look...
- What?.

192
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,145
Watch...

193
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,088
I am now Belgian.

194
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,094
Near Colonia in the reactor core.

195
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,187
One minute into the reactor,
1,000 euros.

196
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:37,092
- Is not it dangerous?.
- I will not do it every month.

197
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:41,127
- Back here?.
- No, we return directly to Italy.

198
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,134
Takes...

199
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,238
1200 euros.

200
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:53,080
- How much we have in mind?.
- Nearly 20,000 euros.

201
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,186
Vuelveme to teach the document.

202
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,152
What a joy to live with you.

203
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,255
- We must still wait for the Russian.
- Yes

204
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,227
- Did you see any room for the bar?.
- I deal with it next week.

205
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:15,029
The bank will give me some direction.

206
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,198
Tell me you love me!

207
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,107
- I love you. What's wrong?.
- None.

208
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,147
The minibus. I gotta go.

209
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,066
The drogata is in the hospital,
wants to leave.

210
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,226
- Again?.
- This time is serious.

211
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,096
- I would prefer instead of divorce...
- Have you spoken to Fabio?.

212
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,139
Do not want to wait for the Russian,

213
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,268
but the divorce will be quicker if
I say that my husband beats me.

214
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:57,139
- Do not you investigate?.
- I think it always works.

215
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,240
If fails, send all the shit!

216
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:05,018
- To decide what Fabio.
- I'd rather not die.

217
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:09,026
It is too late.
Were agreement is only a drug addict.

218
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:13,257
Lorna, you can not leave now.
We are near the end...

219
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,124
If something does not work, call me.

220
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,066
Come.

221
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,100
That's it. The other arm.

222
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,111
Ya, you can now dress.

223
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,992
2007, 21 hours...

224
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,197
In"17 Street Ferreire,
domicilio marriage.

225
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:04,031
Circumstances: abstinence heroin.

226
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:08,003
Wednesday November 14 2007 21:00.

227
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:13,203
- He said he is now in the hospital.
- Yes, since that Wednesday night.

228
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,237
Okay.

229
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,040
Should have been that very evening.

230
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,045
Present the complaint
before the judge,

231
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,250
but I do not think that is sufficient
to expedite a divorce.

232
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,050
Why?.

233
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:33,255
Given the position of the hematoma,
could argue that they made you.

234
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,056
It was he wanted drugs.

235
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:40,000
If at least one witness had...
but we do not have.

236
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,108
Sign here, please.

237
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,180
Because I need money,

238
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:03,021
and may soon to remarry, I will soon.

239
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,224
- A real marriage?.
- No.

240
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,224
Like ours.

241
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,101
A foreigner who pays to be Belgian.

242
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:20,043
I've helped you leave
and was not expected.

243
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,979
Now you can help me, right?.

244
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,284
Do you agree?.

245
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:43,260
I do not want me fiche as abusive.

246
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:47,195
- Already booked for drugs and theft.
- It is not the same.

247
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,207
I've never stuck to one woman.

248
00:31:55,246 --> 00:32:00,013
And 5000 euros dei divorce, which
could get before, do not you care?.

249
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,186
I can wait.

250
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:07,088
Collection allowance and
could find work.

251
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,995
If you accept, you will help
avoid back on drugs.

252
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,067
Even after the divorce.

253
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,079
People come.

254
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,116
Come on, Hit me. Hit me!, Claudy!

255
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,049
Come on!

256
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:14,115
I should have eaten before the king
that I will eat the horse.

257
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,135
Are three and ten.

258
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:29,197
- Is the last one?.
- We said to all three.

259
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,983
Already.

260
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,083
Come on.

261
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,249
Get up.

262
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,251
Get up!

263
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:52,253
You said that if I was
you pegaras me!

264
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,091
Come on!

265
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,102
With the fist!

266
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,074
I can not.

267
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,148
You okay?.

268
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,078
Lorna?.

269
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:31,294
No!

270
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,109
Okay?.

271
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,151
I was stuck and I have beaten
head against the wall.

272
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,088
You should complain to the police.

273
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:56,126
I want to do.

274
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,067
Do you agree to testify
if the police needed?.

275
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,034
Sure.

276
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,265
Seems not a violent person.
As to trust appearances.

277
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:17,205
What is your name, madam?.

278
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,181
Monique Sobel.

279
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:29,091
Can you sign your name on a piece
of paper and phone number?.

280
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,025
Yes, of course.

281
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,172
Fabio wants to see, is
Park behind there.

282
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,210
The girl has done the laundry
and it worked.

283
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,057
I'm afraid, Lorna.

284
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,217
Why?. I have not done anything.

285
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:40,094
Do not do it.
Do not go to the police.

286
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,031
- And if it works?.
- Do not do it!

287
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,004
You are his wife, thinks of him.
I got it from the rest.

288
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,066
Do not trust me?.

289
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,039
Mandatory.

290
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,023
Okay, go.

291
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,224
,Lorna!

292
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,005
You are also required.

293
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,111
I hope not to send the shit the
matter with the Russians.

294
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,239
It is the best with them
and I can not fail.

295
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:35,042
Nor do I want. I want my money.

296
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,984
Now you admit it.

297
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,127
Who was that of the other
night at the station?.

298
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,999
- Sokol.
- But Sokol brings beard.

299
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,159
Yes, but it has been shaved.

300
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,258
Someone asked about you.

301
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,214
- Excuse me, back in two minutes.
- Okay.

302
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,256
I left, I wanted to give
you a surprise.

303
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:49,253
- You mean you're cured?.
- Yes

304
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:54,120
If I am wrong, can I call
a number of the hospital.

305
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,100
You must resist.

306
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,130
- Can you tell me the house keys?.
- I am by them.

307
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,165
And on the money.

308
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,029
Here.

309
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,161
I return to you, I just want
10 euros for cigarettes.

310
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:39,007
- We eat together to celebrate?.
- I can not, there are a lot of work.

311
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,207
Prepare dinner for tonight, well I'm busy.
Are you doing well?.

312
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:49,013
- If you want...
- Then I pick more money
for the purchase.

313
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:56,022
- What time again?.
- Non know, about seven.

314
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:59,126
- Okay, bye.
- Yes

315
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,238
- Who is it?.
- Lorna.

316
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,145
Since almost everything is.

317
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,246
I made the pasta carbonara.

318
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:08,064
A letter has come for you
I have left on their bed.

319
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:35,082
It is a letter from the judge,
has granted a divorce.

320
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,092
Back in an hour.

321
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,219
I have cooked, and almost is.

322
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,124
You can wait an hour, right?.

323
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:47,100
- I thought we were going to celebrate!
- I had in an hour, okay?.

324
00:41:58,315 --> 00:42:01,113
Roberto, have you seen Fabio?.

325
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,174
No.

326
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,288
Fabio waits in the taxi at the plaza.

327
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:30,076
I have not done anything
more, I swear.

328
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,039
It is a consequence of the complaint.

329
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,054
Too late for Russian, can not wait.

330
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,215
,Ask, is only one month!

331
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:48,027
And you get to marry one weeks after divorce...
They suck!

332
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:51,260
Why?.
I have a husband who attacked me.

333
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,129
I could hear another man waiting
for the divorce, why not?.

334
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,038
I make the race.

335
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:03,070
And you give him 5000 andalusia
drogata the day of the divorce?.

336
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,172
Yes, the lame of the 10,000 Russian.

337
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,111
Okay, I'll call it, just
accept expected this month.

338
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:14,021
- Will you call me when you've talked about?.
- Yes

339
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:47,155
I spoke with Russian, agrees.

340
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,272
- Get out of here with all your shit!
- Money.

341
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:06,008
- Let go first! Go!
- Shut up, my money!

342
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,044
I want to talk first!

343
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:12,080
- Wait here.
- 10 minutes, no more.

344
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,047
And back.

345
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,113
- Give me my money.
- Want to start over?.

346
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:22,022
- My money!
- Call the hospital.

347
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,184
Give it to me!

348
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,261
Wait, calm down!

349
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:31,158
- I do not want to start again.
- You got your divorce,
what do you care?.

350
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:34,068
- Give me my money!
- Now I give you.

351
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:41,011
- I've forgotten in the laundry.

00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:29,212

The autopsy confirms that

Do you know of any enemy
I wanted dead?.

429
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,188

Friday, 4 days ago.

442
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,232
That night her husband called
a camel to buy heroin.

443
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,103
Perhaps the news of the divorce?.

444
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:01,208

or accidentally?.

00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,146

463
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:48,190

For the girl...

467
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:02,204
We do not want your money

468
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,299

01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,010
I turn to go tonight.

473
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,212
What do we do?.

474
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,245
- Do you sleep?.
- No.

475
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:24,264
Non haunts you.

476
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,203
Prefer a drug addict Drugs to life.

477
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,209
Sooner or later known to lie.

478
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,086
And who knows die.

479
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:49,130

Here, the number 36.

483
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,164
Is too small.

484
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,034
You're right.

485
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:29,227
Or not enter a table in
front the counter.

486
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:52,995
Watch yourself.

487
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:02,169
Do you see anything?.

488
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:04,170

490
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,202
Is it big?.

491
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,206
Yes, in summer could
put tables outside.

492
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,165
I like it.

493
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:34,159

01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,032
Something for you?.

01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:52,197
No, I do not take anything either.

503
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,240
Roberto, a beer.

504
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,286
Do you like your Belgian
identity card.

505
01:07:22,104 --> 01:07:23,128
Please.

506
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,003
Thank you.

507
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:28,076

- All right?.
- It seems so.

511
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,076
I have a breakthrough.

512
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:14,051
You can take your hand three bundles.

513
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,027
At 20 tickets.

514
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,032
Is the price of a pack of
cigarettes in Moscow.

515
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:41,174
Want to 1,000 euros to be rejected?.

I'm so happy, Sokol! Our bar!

520
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,015
Expected to measure.

521
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:35,290
One, two, three, four...

522
01:10:36,298 --> 01:10:40,029
Roughly four meters.

523
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:43,197
The counter can be put
in this location.

524
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,074
The second...

525
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,142

526
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,211

Plus or minus five meters.
Fit five or six tables.

529

01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:04,216
Tables also fit here.

531
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:06,995
There is a door...

532
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,222
We can make a kitchen here small.

533
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:15,102
The door to the garden.

534
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,143
,Que bonito!

535
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,048
You have until trees.

536
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:29,242
Perfect for summer.

537
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,147
Yes, yes.

538
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:41,252
Now I am on the first floor.

539
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:47,133
Up the stairs is a bathroom...

540
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:49,134
With the tub!

541
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:51,171
It's great!

542
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,241
Beside there is a room.

543
01:11:54,109 --> 01:11:56,100
We could put the living room.

544
01:11:57,146 --> 01:12:00,115
In this one can do the kitchen.

545
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:02,115
Climb to the second floor.

546
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:04,208
Sure that it is the bedroom.

547
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:15,187
I go up...

548
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:32,238
Sokol?.

549
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,084
Yes, I'm fine.

550
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:41,022
I was too excited...

551
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:44,089
I skipped breakfast and play and eat.

552
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:49,096
I loaded mobile me I
came directly here.

553
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:17,055
I'm better.

554
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:24,027
It will be a lowering of tension.

555
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:26,164

556
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,247

A month ago and three weeks.

566
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:22,149
What comes for a visit or for
a particular control?.

567
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:25,126
I want to abort.

568
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:29,027
Voluntary interruption of pregnancy.
Well.

569
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:32,157
We will do an ultrasound to establish
The exact date of pregnancy

570

572
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,263
Come on.

573
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:42,269

574
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:45,304

01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:12,261
We can not open an account in the name
a person that does not exist.

583
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:15,230
Born in seven months and
a half eight months.

584
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:21,004
But was not born yet!
I can only Book an account number.

585
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,237

587
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,047
Agreed.

588
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:35,080

596
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:29,200
Can you tell Andrei that got away?.

597
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:32,171
Yes, I know, I had a problem
with the taxi.

598
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,180
I ask a thousand apologies.

599
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:39,983
Quickly, the Russians
have already arrived!

600
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,121
Do not have anything else to get?.

601
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:06,247
I am pregnant.

602
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,280

- What if I have it?.
- Forget it.

610
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,108
The agreement with Russia
is not expected.

611
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:47,245
- I would ask you to recognize it.
- Never mind, not in the pact.

612
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:51,150
Come on.

613
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:59,292
Micky introduces you to one of
the wedding of two witnesses.

614
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,263
- Good evening.

Of confidence.

619
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,016
Sometimes the police
interrogate witnesses.

620
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:28,253
Cheers!

621
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:38,229
You should dance together,
that you see.

622
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:41,167
Andrei, you should dance with her.

623
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:47,042
The waiter can confirm conocais you.

624
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:08,032
All right for you if I have a child?.
Me, a child?.

625
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:12,006
- A boy Andrei?.
- No, mine, not you.

626
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,004
Marriage itself, not children.

627
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,271
No, you just married,
I'm the child!

628
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:24,042
No, no. We talk, never mind.

629
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:27,212
No trouble is nothing.

630
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:35,058
No child wants you, just married.

631
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:39,191
Only to be told that if pregnant
As we married.

632
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:41,127
Just a question.

633
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:53,013
No, do not agree, then would
to pay child support.

634
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:56,048
- You do not want unexpected.

635
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:57,106
Nothing.

636
01:20:57,185 --> 01:21:01,019
Andrei asked if he married
be pregnant.

637
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:04,190
- Why have you asked?.
- Nothing...

638
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:08,119
- In my life, it could happen.
- If true, abort.

639
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:11,255
Say you're quiet no children.

640
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:17,036
You can make a medical examination.

641
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:26,180
He says he agrees with the
doctor, has a friend.

642
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:32,219
I left dancing.

643
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:27,041
I asked you not to say.

644
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:30,040
I just wanted to know
what you thought.

645
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:36,148
Never again! Never again, right?.

646
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,144
,Do what I tell you and stop!

647
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:48,120
Tomorrow morning abortions,

What happens?.

649
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,198
The doctor who visited arrives away.

650
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:34,002
Thank you.

651
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,980
.Ask about abortion?.

652
01:23:42,183 --> 01:23:44,151
Do you claim abortion?.

653
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:45,241
No.

654
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:47,145
Why?.

655
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,128
Got the number of Sokol?.

656
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:57,288
On the phone, inside the bag.

657
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:15,274
Sokol is not the father, Claudy is.

658
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:19,049
Is the drug addict?.

659
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:22,085
- Fucking with the drug addict?.
- It's called Claudy.

660
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:23,215

- Good evening.
- Good evening.

662
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:31,095
- Is your husband, your partner?.
- A friend, I brought the car.

663
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,996
Does the sedative begins
to take effect?.

664
01:24:36,137 --> 01:24:39,197
As I have shown on ultrasound,
you are not pregnant.

665
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:43,142
Refuses to admit it is disturbed.

666
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:48,015
It is better to stay in 3 days observation
to make some consideration.

667
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:49,981
Do you agree?.

668
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,053

Why tell me you were Pregnant?.

673

- I am.
- You said you're not.

674
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:09,202
I know better than you!

675
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:10,993
No.

676
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:19,171
Mrs Sobel?.

677

- Can I stay in your room?.
- Yes, there is a sofa bed.

683
01:25:58,019 --> 01:26:00,988
- I do not want to return to Albania.
- This is the best solution.

684
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:06,117
- Tell him to let me stay.
- He will say no.

685
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:10,063
You talk too much, no
longer trusts you.

686
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:14,135
- All wanted to nurse.
- Claudy knew y...

687
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:16,032
Shut up!

688
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:30,211
If you love me, understand
why wanted the child.

689
01:26:30,285 --> 01:26:33,152

695
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,220
You just want to recover your money.

696
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:16,054
I've done to lose money
of the Russians.

697
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:19,031

01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:56,985
What?.

713
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:00,285
See you.

714
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:55,240
- Give me the phone.
- Why?.

715
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:57,209
SIM card.

716
01:30:58,052 --> 01:31:01,021
- What if I call you?.
- We asked Spirou.

717
01:31:57,178 --> 01:32:01,205
- Why do not you get the highway?.
- I have to make gasoline.

718
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:26,128
There is a gas station,
go to while refueling.

719
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,231
Not here, there is another cheaper.

720
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:48,252
For, I have to pee.

721
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,998
- Can not wait?.
- No.

722
01:33:07,014 --> 01:33:09,039
You do not need the bag to urinate.

723
01:33:50,057 --> 01:33:52,025
They want to kill you.

724
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:56,220
Do not be afraid, I protect you.

725
01:35:30,024 --> 01:35:32,015
Run a little more.

726
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:34,091
It is safer.

727
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:50,087
If we could fire.

728
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:25,088
I'm going to get some firewood.

729
01:38:58,198 --> 01:39:00,063
Do you hear?.

730
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:27,050
Do not let die.

731
01:39:28,195 --> 01:39:29,992
Never.

732
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:34,225
I left your father dying.

733
01:39:37,137 --> 01:39:39,071
You will live.

734
01:40:38,165 --> 01:40:40,133
Sleep now.

735
01:40:41,068 --> 01:40:43,036
We will continue tomorrow morning.

736
01:40:46,106 --> 01:40:50,008
Looking for something
to eat and drink.

737
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:55,106
Ask in any home.

738
01:40:57,284 --> 01:40:59,149
Do not worry.

739
01:41:00,254 --> 01:41:03,018
Somebody help us.

740
01:41:34,188 --> 01:41:36,019
To rest.

741
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:07,178
Our friend Henry Ingberg
