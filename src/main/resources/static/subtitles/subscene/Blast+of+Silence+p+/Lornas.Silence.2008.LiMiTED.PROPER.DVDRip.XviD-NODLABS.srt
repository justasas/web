1
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,151
- 340.
- Yes.

2
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,958
Can I see the manager?

3
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,759
I can give you an appointment
tomorrow.

4
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,480
Yes, at 12:30 if possible.

5
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,153
What's it about?

6
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,595
A loan I talked about to him.

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,520
I'll be Belgian soon,
so I can do it.

8
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,069
Yes.

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,632
Fourteen thousand.

10
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,869
In a month, if it all goes smoothly.

11
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,919
When do I see you?

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,754
All right...

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,319
I'll hang up now.

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,559
I love you.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,194
Me too.

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,588
Bye.

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,075
One euro fifty, please.

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,389
Excuse me.

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,679
What is it?

20
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,512
I know.
You called me three times already.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,035
Thank you.

22
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,390
Thanks.

23
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,199
What do I owe you?

24
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,112
One euro ten.

25
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,513
I'm going to bed.

26
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,759
Want to play cards?

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,830
No.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,558
Close the curtains.

29
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,029
Coming?

30
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,715
No.

31
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,389
I said no!

32
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,590
You heard? I told him no.

33
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,239
Yes, I heard.

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,069
Good night.

35
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,799
No cards then?

36
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,075
No.

37
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,511
Turn the music down!

38
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,311
The music... Not so loud!

39
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,995
Lorna...

40
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,749
Lorna...

41
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,069
Lorna!

42
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,989
What?

43
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,398
I want to talk. Let me in.

44
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,595
No.

45
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,555
I have to be up at six tomorrow.

46
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,395
I'm not going out tonight. I quit.

47
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,435
Like every week. Let me sleep.

48
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,070
I can stick it out this time
if you help me.

49
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,834
Promise me you'll help.
On my own, I...

50
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,195
Let me sleep, Claudy!

51
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,351
I need to know,
to set myself a goal for the day.

52
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,556
I don't knowwhen I'll be back.

53
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,995
Just give me a time.
Any time.

54
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,755
Five? Six?

55
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,709
Nine?

56
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,352
What time? Seven? Seven, ok?

57
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,794
If you want.

58
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,236
If you're late, you can call me.

59
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,440
Don't forget
to put your mattress back.

60
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,792
- What are you doing?
- I mustn't go out. Lock me in.

61
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,474
- You won't go out?
- I have to resist.

62
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,390
Lock me in.

63
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,788
I'm not doing that.

64
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,551
Why not?

65
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,996
You'll want to go out
and I'll have to come back.

66
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,832
No, I promise. Lorna!

67
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,350
If I get back late,
tell the boss I'll stay tonight.

68
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,350
I'll tell her.

69
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,430
Thanks.

70
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,117
He told them I could come back
during my break.

71
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,793
So say evenings only.

72
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,110
I said that. He didn't understand.

73
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,197
He's a mess. He's quitting.

74
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,110
Terminal 4.

75
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,357
Mr Ventura.
Can you take it, Fabio?

76
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,399
I'll take it.

77
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,915
He wants to quit this time.
He asked me to help.

78
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,389
He'll be high again tomorrow.

79
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,153
If he does manage to quit,
what do we do?

80
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,311
As planned, we give him an OD.

81
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,311
Will the police believe it?

82
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,118
Of course they will.

83
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,397
Junkies quit, use again
and OD all the time.

84
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,677
Damn cops!
Nothing for six months till now.

85
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,671
Just when you become Belgian.

86
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,835
Wait for me?

87
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,752
I have to go to the airport.

88
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,116
Showthem the wedding photo.

89
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,029
Claudy?

90
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,719
Where's the police?

91
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,079
Not here.
I felt bad, I wanted to see you.

92
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,639
Get out of my bed.

93
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,440
- I thought I could.
- On it, not in it!

94
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,793
Look what you've done!

95
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,109
Sorry.

96
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,158
Get a cloth.

97
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,432
The police weren't here.

98
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,270
He just wanted me to come back.

99
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,998
Don't ever do this again.

100
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,752
I didn't feel good.

101
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,353
I don't care.

102
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,038
I'll be late.
I won't have time to eat.

103
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,838
Shall I make a sandwich?

104
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,035
Who is it?

105
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,390
- Want anything?
- Get lost!

106
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,072
He's been twice already.

107
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,068
Can you get Buscopan for my cramps?

108
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,394
It costs 18 or 19 euros.

109
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,591
Why should I go for you?

110
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,149
If I see the others, I won't resist.

111
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,515
That's not my problem.

112
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,309
You got paid to marry.
You'll get double that to divorce.

113
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,630
- Don't ask me nothing!
- Screwthe money!

114
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,270
Just help me. Get some Buscopan!

115
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,351
Get it yourself!

116
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,158
Help me, Lorna!

117
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,356
- Get up.
- Help me...

118
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,394
Get up.

119
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,354
Write the name down for me.

120
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,350
Give me that.

121
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,955
- What's it called?
- Buscopan.

122
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,429
Lock me in.

123
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,555
No.

124
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,235
Lorna!

125
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,150
My key!

126
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,998
It fell in the truck!

127
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,471
Good evening. Number 3.

128
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,234
It's me.

129
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,952
I wanted to talk to you.

130
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,953
Goodbye. I'll call on Sunday.

131
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,589
Good evening.

132
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,990
I'd like some Buscopan, please.

133
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,832
Do you have a prescription?

134
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,035
No.

135
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,469
Are you in pain?

136
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,517
No, it's not me, it's...

137
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,994
It's my husband. He's having cramps.

138
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,718
All right,
but usually I need a prescription.

139
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,029
Thank you.

140
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,995
Lorna!

141
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,875
What's wrong?

142
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,996
What?

143
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,315
Water?

144
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,797
Let go.

145
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,949
Help me up.

146
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,439
Let go of me, Claudy.

147
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,835
Let go!

148
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,031
Help me up, the cramps hurt!

149
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,553
Take the Buscopan.

150
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,473
I already did but it hurts.
Please...

151
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,592
Wait...

152
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,111
Here, call my doctor.

153
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,191
Why don't you call him?

154
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,039
Lorna! Help me! Help me!

155
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,109
Help me...

156
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,154
Under D. Call Doctor Mayro.

157
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,073
- What?
- Under D. Doctor Mayro.

158
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,073
Tell him he has to get me
into hospital.

159
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,314
Good evening.

160
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,475
This is Claudy Moreau's wife.

161
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,350
He says he's coming off drugs...

162
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,794
It's been two days.

163
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,951
He wants to go to hospital.

164
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,998
Yes, I put him on.

165
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:18,956
Come on.

166
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,073
There, he's registered.

167
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,389
I don't have to pay?

168
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,233
No, but bring his health card
tomorrow.

169
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,197
All right. Thank you.

170
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,709
Your money.

171
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,512
Claudy, your money.

172
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,750
Keep it. I don't need it here.

173
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,470
Just leave me 20 for cigarettes.

174
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,678
I have to bring your health card.
Where is it?

175
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,273
On my shelfwith my stuff.

176
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,994
Put it in my pocket. The inside one.

177
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,837
Will someone take care of me?

178
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,798
The receptionist said
a nurse would come.

179
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,995
I'm going.

180
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,319
Can you bring me
my CD player and discs?

181
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,675
Lorna!

182
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,949
Don't leave me.

183
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,792
The nurse will be here soon.

184
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,439
Wait for him with me.

185
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,599
Please.

186
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,918
Yes, I'm coming down.

187
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,673
I'll be at the taxi park.

188
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,874
- Claudy Moreau?
- Room 110.

189
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,270
But visiting hours are from 4 to 7.

190
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,637
I'm not visiting.
I've brought his health card.

191
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,677
Admissions is on level zero.

192
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,230
All right. Could you give him this?
It's his stuff.

193
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,913
Are you his wife?

194
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,798
- You can take it to him.
- No, it's ok.

195
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,916
Go on, but don't stay long.

196
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,117
The last door but one on the left.
Room 110.

197
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,835
Claudy?

198
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,879
What should we do?

199
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,315
Divorce, like he thinks we will.

200
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,435
No.

201
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,675
Why not?

202
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,119
We picked a junkie
to avoid a divorce.

203
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,077
It would take too long.

204
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,392
What if the Russian's ready
to delay the wedding?

205
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,548
We agreed on June.
I'll keep my word.

206
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,471
Press the windshield washer.

207
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,199
The left-hand lever.

208
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,869
Ok!

209
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,028
I'll try to find out
if we can get a quicker divorce.

210
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,195
Who'll give the junkie his 5,000?

211
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,591
Take it out of my 10,000
from the Russian.

212
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,318
You fucking the junkie?

213
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,152
Screwhim. I'm with Sokol.

214
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,719
Why back down then?

215
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,552
I'm not backing down.

216
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,029
But if he ODs now, it'll look weird.

217
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,519
I told you it won't.

218
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,152
Nearly all junkies who quit
start using again.

219
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,878
The cops look into divorces.
You need to be a widow.

220
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,355
Sokol!

221
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,556
I was worried you'd left.

222
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,713
The van for Germany isn't here yet.

223
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,309
I like you without the beard.

224
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,715
Look!

225
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,949
Look!

226
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,112
You're Belgian now.

227
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,993
Near Cologne, in the main reactor.

228
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,991
One minute inside: 1,000 euros.

229
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,513
Isn't it dangerous?

230
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,398
Only if you do it every month.

231
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,359
Will you come back?

232
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,511
No, we go straight to Italy.

233
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,880
Here's 1,200.

234
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,753
- What's on the account?
- Almost 20,000.

235
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,277
Let me see your card again.

236
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,751
I'm so glad I'm with you.

237
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,712
We must wait for the Russian.

238
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,756
Yes.

239
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,952
Seen places for the snack bar?

240
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,473
I'll go next week.

241
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,712
The banker will give me
a couple of addresses.

242
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,073
Tell me you love me.

243
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,632
I love you. What's wrong?

244
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,869
Nothing.

245
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,551
That's the van. I have to go.

246
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,794
The junkie's in hospital,
trying to quit.

247
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,551
Again?

248
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,119
He's serious this time.

249
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,396
Maybe we should get divorced, not...

250
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,993
You talked to Fabio?

251
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,276
He won't make the Russian wait

252
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,874
but a divorce is quick
if my husband beats me.

253
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,393
Will they investigate?

254
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,516
Yes, but I hear it always works.

255
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,353
If it doesn't,
you'll wreck everything.

256
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,950
Let Fabio decide.

257
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,838
I'd rather he didn't die.

258
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,356
It's too late. We agreed.
He's just a junkie.

259
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,149
Listen, Lorna.

260
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,232
You can't give in
this close to our goal.

261
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,915
If anything's wrong, call me.

262
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,389
Come closer.

263
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,478
Nowyour other arm.

264
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,554
All right, you can get dressed.

265
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,994
17, Rue Ferreire,
at the marital home.

266
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,516
Circumstances:
Drug withdrawal. Heroin.

267
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,195
Wednesday, November 14th, 2007,
at 9 pm.

268
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,239
You say he's in hospital now?

269
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,994
Yes, since Wednesday, that evening.

270
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,395
All right.

271
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,677
You should have come then.

272
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,033
We'll file the complaint

273
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,079
but I don't think it's enough
for a fast-track divorce.

274
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,229
Why not?

275
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,752
The bruising
could easily be self-inflicted.

276
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,117
It was him. He wanted his fix.

277
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,470
It would help if you had a witness,
but you don't.

278
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,037
Sign here, please.

279
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,158
I need money.

280
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,997
The sooner I can remarry,
the sooner I'll get it.

281
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,398
A real marriage?

282
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,549
No.

283
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,229
Like us.

284
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,238
With a foreigner
who'll pay to be Belgian.

285
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,479
I'm helping you quit!
That wasn't planned.

286
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,912
Can't you help me too?

287
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,955
You'll do it?

288
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,710
I won't go on file as violent.

289
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,511
You're a junkie and a thief.

290
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,999
It's not the same.

291
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,518
I've never hit a woman.

292
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,638
The 5,000 euros for the divorce,
that doesn't interest you?

293
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,515
I can wait.

294
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,517
I'm on minimum benefit.
Maybe I'll find a job.

295
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,758
If you agree,
I'll help you stay clean,

296
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,031
even after we divorce.

297
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,592
Someone's coming.

298
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,634
Go on, hit me. Hit me, Claudy!

299
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,149
Do it!

300
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,157
You should have played your king
before my queen.

301
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,392
It's ten past three.

302
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,230
One last hand?

303
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,913
We said three o'clock.

304
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,875
She's there.

305
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,315
Come on.

306
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,469
Get up.

307
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,714
Get up!

308
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,593
You said you'd hit me if I stayed.

309
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,955
Do it.

310
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,633
With your fist!

311
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,315
I can't.

312
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,030
Are you ok?

313
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,950
Lorna?

314
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,795
Ok?

315
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,399
He hit me
and my head struck on the wall.

316
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,629
You should go to the police.

317
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,519
I'll do that.

318
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,355
Will you be my witness
if the police ask?

319
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,919
Yes, of course.

320
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,916
He didn't seem violent.
But you never can tell.

321
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,991
What's your name?

322
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,992
Monique Sobel.

323
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,354
Can you put your name and number
on a bit of paper?

324
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,794
Of course.

325
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,553
Fabio wants you.
He's on the parking lot.

326
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,238
It worked for a girl
at the dry-cleaner's.

327
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,353
You scare me, Lorna.

328
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,075
Why? I've done nothing against you.

329
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,596
You don't do this.
You don't go to the cops.

330
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,035
- What if it worked?
- You don't do it!

331
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,350
You're his wife. Look after him.
The rest's up to me.

332
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,751
You don't trust me anymore?

333
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,112
I have to. I need you.

334
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,554
Ok, you can go.

335
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,957
Remember, you need me too.

336
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,154
Don't make me screwup on this deal.

337
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,716
It's my first with the Russians.

338
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,713
I don't want that either.
I want my money.

339
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,512
That's the Lorna I know.

340
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,550
Who was the guy at the station?

341
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,828
Sokol.

342
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,355
Sokol has a beard.

343
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,476
Yes, but he shaved it off.

344
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,270
Lorna!

345
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,476
Someone to see you in the shop!

346
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,589
Sorry, I'll only be a minute.

347
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,508
I'm out. I wanted to surprise you.

348
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,514
You're cured then?

349
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,556
Yes.

350
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,193
If ever I feel bad,
I can call a number at the hospital.

351
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,433
You have to resist.

352
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,631
I need the apartment keys.

353
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,557
I'll get them.

354
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,119
And my money too.

355
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,956
Here.

356
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,239
I just want 10 euros for cigarettes.

357
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,878
Want lunch to celebrate?

358
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,110
I can't, I have too much work.

359
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,231
I'll make dinner tonight.
It'll keep me busy. Ok?

360
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,071
If you want.

361
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,879
I'll need more money then,
to buy food.

362
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,433
When'll you be back?

363
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,511
I don't know. Around seven.

364
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,069
See you later.

365
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,629
Who is it?

366
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,115
It's nearly ready.

367
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,237
Cheese and ham macaroni.

368
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,398
There was a letter for you.
It's on your bed.

369
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,238
It's from the judge.
I'm getting the divorce.

370
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,992
I'll be back in an hour.

371
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,392
Dinner's nearly ready.

372
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,473
I'll be back in an hour.
Can't you wait?

373
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,671
We're celebrating me getting out.

374
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,910
We'll do it in an hour, ok?

375
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,236
Roberto, have you seen Fabio?

376
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,270
Fabio's waiting on the square.

377
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,309
I didn't do anything else, I swear.

378
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,836
It's that complaint I filed.

379
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,315
The Russian won't wait any longer.

380
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,433
Ask him. It's only another month.

381
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,271
A wedding two weeks
after the divorce? That stinks.

382
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,555
Why?

383
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,073
My husband beats me.

384
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,516
Can't I meet someone
before the divorce is final?

385
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,468
Ok, I'll take it.

386
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,359
You'll pay the junkie's 5,000
when you divorce?

387
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,950
Yes, out of the Russian's 10,000.

388
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,239
Ok. I'll see if he can wait a month.

389
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,239
You'll call me after?

390
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,995
I spoke to the Russian. He agrees.

391
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,354
Take your shit away!

392
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,794
- My money!
- He goes first!

393
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,870
Just get out!

394
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,836
I want my money!

395
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,479
I need to talk to you.

396
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,634
Wait downstairs.

397
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,991
- Ten minutes, no more.
- I'll be there.

398
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,476
Give it to me!

399
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,278
- You're using again?
- My money!

400
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,158
Let's call the hospital...

401
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,673
Give me my money!

402
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,035
Wait. Calm down.

403
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,112
I don't want you
to get hooked again.

404
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,111
You got your divorce. Hand it over!

405
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,713
I'll give it to you.

406
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,789
It's at the shop.

407
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,712
You're lying! Hand it over!

408
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,515
Give me the envelope!

409
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,394
Give me the key!

410
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,876
Give it to me!

411
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,429
Do the bikes work?

412
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,396
Which one?

413
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,959
- The blue one.
- Yeah.

414
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,108
50 euros.

415
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,314
I'll take the bike.

416
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,559
60 euros to open your door,
10 for two keys, that makes 70.

417
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,676
Half and half?

418
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,478
No, the door's my fault.

419
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,993
It's my fault too.

420
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,035
All right.

421
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,754
35 each.

422
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,159
I'll ride all day.

423
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,590
It'll give me something to do.

424
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,192
Can I come by at midday?

425
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,755
I'll be alone at the shop.

426
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,592
Not to have lunch.

427
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,873
It gives me a goal
in the middle of the day.

428
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,872
I'll stop by and leave again.

429
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,829
All right.

430
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,955
I need to see you. It helps me.

431
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,915
I'm going now.

432
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,029
Here, I'd rather you keep it.

433
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,638
See you later.

434
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,154
The family was here.
They'll handle the funeral costs.

435
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,631
I said I would.

436
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,711
I told them but they refused.

437
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,957
Can I see him one last time?

438
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,350
You already identified him.
I can't...

439
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,431
The duty officer has left.

440
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,953
I'm his wife.

441
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,315
All right.

442
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,158
Sure you won't stay here?

443
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,149
It looks like you're running away.

444
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,553
Did you hear me?

445
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,712
The police may get suspicious.

446
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,030
They have my phone number.

447
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,229
Give that back.

448
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,270
What?

449
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,994
The player.

450
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,918
He won't need it now.

451
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,589
Give it to her.

452
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,914
You could stay another week.

453
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,513
It would look more normal.

454
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,556
No.

455
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,274
Where will you go?

456
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,954
Where I was before.

457
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,518
You sublet that place.

458
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,750
I worked it out with the girl.

459
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,392
Not taking his razor and stuff?

460
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,676
No.

461
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,790
Spirou! Get the junkie's stuff
from the bathroom.

462
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,831
Going to sulk much longer?

463
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,514
You'd have told the junkie

464
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,399
if you knew
the Russian wouldn't wait.

465
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,158
I helped you keep going.

466
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:06,476
Thank me instead of sulking.

467
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:12,990
Here...

468
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,235
For the extra work, another 1,000.

469
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,229
What extra work?

470
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,711
Taking care of him when he tried
to quit was work, right?

471
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,234
Refusing means you're not with us.

472
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,438
Are you still with us?

473
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,196
Yes.

474
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,112
You always have been, ok.

475
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,197
Because you kept quiet,
we were able to make him OD.

476
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,915
Ok?

477
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,910
Yes.

478
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,154
The 1,000 is yours when you want it.

479
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,554
Take the photo.

480
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,796
Spirou...

481
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,629
Take a bag.

482
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,750
Good evening, is Mrs Moreau in?

483
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,429
Good evening.

484
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,232
Mrs Moreau,
we have a fewmore questions,

485
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,992
following the autopsy.

486
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,194
I'll take your bag.

487
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,831
- We'll wait in the car.
- Ok.

488
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,829
Come in.

489
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,557
The autopsy
confirms it was an overdose.

490
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,192
Do you know
if anyone wanted him dead?

491
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,670
No.

492
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,033
Someone who'd gain from killing him
with an overdose?

493
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,236
No.

494
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,153
He'd just come off drugs.
Was he depressed?

495
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,110
No.

496
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,238
Did he mention suicide?

497
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,870
No.

498
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,032
You filed for divorce
because he beat you...

499
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,431
Yes.

500
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,750
He knewyou were going to get it?

501
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:07,591
Yes.

502
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,954
Since when?

503
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,196
Since I got the judge's letter.

504
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,634
Four days ago.

505
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,592
What day did the dealer say?

506
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,032
Friday. Four days ago.

507
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,875
That evening, your husband
called a dealer to buy heroin.

508
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,874
Maybe after hearing
about the divorce?

509
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,718
The dealer says
you stopped him from buying it.

510
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,470
Yes.

511
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,918
Alone and depressed,
could he have taken a fix

512
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,637
and deliberately
or accidentally overdosed?

513
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,399
Possibly.

514
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,755
All right.

515
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,388
We'll be going now.

516
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,029
Goodbye.

517
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,194
Goodbye, Mrs Moreau.

518
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:42,951
Excuse me.

519
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,313
Are you Claudy's mother?

520
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,914
No, the lady in that car there.

521
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,400
I'm Lorna, Claudy's wife.

522
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,710
I wanted you to have this.

523
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,236
It's the money he had left.

524
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,633
Did he talk about me?

525
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,190
No.

526
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,279
My son. His brother.

527
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,238
This is Claudy's wife.

528
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,029
What's that?

529
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,919
Claudy's money. What he had left.

530
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,590
You're his wife. It's yours.

531
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,709
For the little girl.

532
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,235
We don't need your money, or his.

533
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,516
Take it.

534
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,231
No...
Just like that. That feels good.

535
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,470
You call me, I come.
1,000 kilometres.

536
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,438
I leave again tonight.

537
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,989
What shall we do?

538
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,915
Lorna...

539
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,155
Are you asleep?

540
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,556
No.

541
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,676
You shouldn't worry about it.

542
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,474
Ajunkie prefers drugs to life.

543
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,194
He'd have started using again

544
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,199
and died one day.

545
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,519
Shall we take a look at the places
for the snack bar?

546
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,390
All right.

547
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,470
It's here. Number 36.

548
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,912
It's tiny.

549
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,988
Yes.

550
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,758
There won't be any room for tables.

551
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,158
Come on, take a look.

552
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,035
Can you see?

553
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,397
There are three rooms.

554
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,514
And a garden.

555
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,795
Is it big?

556
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,914
Yes, we can serve outdoors
in summer.

557
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,879
I like it here.

558
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,036
You have to go tonight?

559
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,630
Yes, the truck leaves at six.

560
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,235
Want to dance?

561
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,070
Lorna, meet Andrei Aslikov.

562
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,839
Kostia, the interpreter.

563
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,235
Sit down.

564
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:50,708
Want a drink?

565
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,756
A beer.

566
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,433
You want another?

567
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,631
Nothing for him. Me neither.

568
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,399
Roberto, a beer!

569
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,954
He wants to see her Belgian ID card.

570
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,478
- You have the paper?
- Yes.

571
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,910
This certifies she's a widow
and free to marry.

572
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,513
They paid a deposit.

573
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,675
Take your share. Three wads.

574
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,148
20-euro notes.

575
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,718
What they sell a carton
of cigarettes for in Moscow.

576
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,871
Want the 1,000 you turned down?

577
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,150
I said I'd keep it for you.

578
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,110
See you.

579
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:16,830
What?

580
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,514
Yes, I signed this morning.

581
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,750
I'm so happy, Sokol!
It's our snack bar.

582
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,911
Wait, let me measure it.

583
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,557
Four metres, more or less.

584
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,190
That's the room for the counter.

585
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,672
The second...
Same width. The length...

586
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,797
Just a second...

587
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,758
Almost five metres long.

588
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,388
We could have five or six tables.

589
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,512
And the third room...

590
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,310
We can have more tables.

591
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,232
And there's a door...

592
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,956
We can make a small kitchen.

593
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,072
I'm going out into the garden.

594
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,353
It's beautiful.

595
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,438
It even has trees.

596
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,395
Ideal for serving outdoors
in summer.

597
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,752
I'm on the first floor.

598
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:42,829
Opposite the stairs,
there's a bathroom with a tub.

599
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,999
Pretty big.

600
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,993
Another room...

601
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,671
It can be our living room.

602
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,672
And another room
where we can have a kitchen.

603
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,672
The second floor now.

604
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,149
There have to be bedrooms.

605
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,189
Hold on...

606
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,719
Yes, I'm fine.

607
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,434
I was so excited...

608
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,629
I haven't eaten all day.

609
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,471
I got a phone card
and came straight here.

610
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,233
Yes, I'm fine.

611
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,831
It must be lowblood pressure.

612
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:16,039
I'll call you later.

613
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,269
Mrs Deda?

614
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,479
Come with me.

615
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,551
Undress, put the smock on
and I'll call you.

616
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:51,195
No.

617
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,631
Any surgical operations?

618
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,710
No.

619
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,519
Any chronic illness?

620
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,556
No.

621
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,112
Are you on any medication?

622
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,190
No.

623
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,992
Your last period?

624
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,437
A month and three weeks ago.

625
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,598
Are you here for a specific reason?

626
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,433
I want an abortion.

627
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,311
A termination of pregnancy.
All right...

628
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,472
We'll do a scan
to date the pregnancy,

629
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,790
then set a date for the operation.

630
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,839
There's a legal wait of 8 days
for you to think it over.

631
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,308
Come and lie down.

632
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,914
Lie down.

633
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,109
What is it? Is something wrong?

634
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,752
You don't want the scan?

635
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,471
I'm not aborting.

636
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,869
In your name?

637
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,270
In the name of the baby I'm having.

638
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,716
Only people who really exist
can have accounts.

639
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,474
He'll be born in about eight months.

640
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,358
But he hasn't been born yet.

641
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,671
What I can do is reserve
an account number for him.

642
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,274
I'd like to put money on it now.

643
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:07,915
Put it on your account

644
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,548
and we'll transfer it
after he's born.

645
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,195
All right.

646
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:17,198
First I'll reserve
the account number.

647
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,034
First name, not yet. Surname?

648
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:23,635
Moreau.

649
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,713
M-O-R-E-A-U.

650
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,837
We're meeting the Russian!

651
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,348
I fell asleep.

652
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,716
I called and tried the buzzer.

653
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,831
I'm lucky someone came out.

654
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,599
It's Fabio.

655
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,550
Tell Andrei we're on our way.

656
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,190
I know, trouble with my taxi.

657
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:14,869
I'm sorry.

658
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,116
Move it. They're waiting.

659
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,999
You're going like that?

660
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,918
I'm expecting a baby.

661
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:51,755
What?

662
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,394
Are you sure?

663
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,308
You saw a doctor?

664
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,188
And the Russian?

665
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:07,628
Couldn't you have been careful?
Sokol's dumb! You too, damn it!

666
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,315
We'll get you an abortion next week.

667
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,274
Hurry it up.

668
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,675
- What if I want to keep it?
- No way!

669
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:20,195
The Russian
doesn't want you pregnant.

670
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,271
He won't have to recognize it.

671
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,908
I don't care. It wasn't planned.

672
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:27,630
Come on.

673
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,479
Meet Micky, one of your witnesses.

674
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,434
Have a drink on me.

675
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,798
He delivers papers.
I've worked for him, Lorna too.

676
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,439
Totally trustworthy.

677
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,033
The police
may try questioning witnesses.

678
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:03,749
Cheers.

679
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,834
People should see you
dance together.

680
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,955
Andrei should dance with her.

681
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,312
If they say they met here,
they'll have witnesses.

682
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,391
You ok if I have child?

683
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,033
Me, baby?

684
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,310
Baby Andrei?

685
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,675
No, me baby, not with you.

686
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,996
Marriage yes, baby no.

687
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,232
You just marriage, me baby.

688
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,792
No, we'll talk some other time.
Forget it.

689
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,430
No problem, it's nothing.

690
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,276
No child with you, just marriage.

691
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,273
It's not that.
I asked if I was pregnant,

692
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:13,477
would he marry me anyway?
I was just asking.

693
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:26,193
No. He won't pay the child's upkeep.
He wants it to go as planned.

694
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,395
What's up?

695
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,470
Nothing.

696
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,474
She asked if Andrei would marry her
if she was pregnant.

697
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,439
Why ask him that?

698
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,353
No reason. I have my life.
It can happen.

699
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,476
If it does, you'll abort.

700
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,551
No problem, there's no child.

701
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,838
If he wants,
a doctor can examine her.

702
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,673
He agrees. A doctor friend of his.

703
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:02,519
We'll let you dance now.

704
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,831
I told you not to mention it.

705
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,908
I wanted to knowwhat he thought.

706
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:04,038
Never do that again! Ever!
Understand?

707
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,436
You do as I say and that's it!

708
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,270
I'll take you to abort tomorrow.

709
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,594
What's wrong?

710
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,709
The doctor
who examined her is coming.

711
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,711
You asked about an abortion?

712
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,997
You asked about an abortion?

713
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,155
No.

714
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,715
Why not?

715
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,039
Got Sokol's number?

716
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,956
On my phone, in my bag...

717
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,155
Sokol's not the father. Claudy is.

718
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,069
The junkie?

719
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,070
- You fucked the junkie?
- His name's Claudy.

720
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,309
Shut up!

721
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,953
Are you her husband?

722
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,190
A friend. I drove her here.

723
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,231
Is the sedative helping?

724
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:01,877
As I showed you on the scan,
you're not pregnant.

725
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,508
You're too upset to accept it.

726
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,875
It's best to stay a few days
so we can run tests.

727
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,268
Do you agree?

728
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:12,790
Yes.

729
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,995
Good.

730
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,954
Someone will take you to your room.

731
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,633
Can it be a single room?

732
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,119
Yes, I think so.

733
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,510
Why did you say you were pregnant?

734
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:26,676
I am.

735
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,150
The doctor says you aren't.
She should know.

736
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:31,876
No.

737
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,313
Mrs Sobel?

738
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,069
Good evening.

739
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:44,356
- Do you remember me?
- Yes.

740
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,080
- And Claudy too?
- Your husband? Of course.

741
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,435
I have to go.

742
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,352
- You'll come to see me?
- Yes.

743
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,635
I'll check which room you're in.

744
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:04,438
Can I stay the night?

745
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:07,114
If you want.
There's a foldaway bed.

746
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,792
- I'm not going back to Albania.
- It's for the best.

747
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,149
- Ask him to let me stay.
- He won't agree.

748
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,912
He doesn't trust you.
You talk too much.

749
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,797
You'd have told that nurse.

750
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:33,916
- She knew Claudy. I...
- Shut up!

751
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:48,119
If you loved me, you'd know
why I want the child.

752
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,919
There is no child.
Stop this craziness.

753
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,674
- I didn't want to cheat on you...
- Stop it.

754
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,713
Fill it out here and here.

755
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,997
But don't sign it
until you meet the banker.

756
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,115
She cancelled the loan, so the bank
takes part of the deposit.

757
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,508
This sum here.

758
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:17,709
Bastards.

759
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,030
Call me once the doctor's been.

760
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,349
All right.

761
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,152
7,000 euros wasted. Bravo.

762
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:26,548
You're like him.

763
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:29,559
You just want
to get your money back.

764
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,631
You lost him money
with the Russians.

765
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,358
He wants it back. It's normal.

766
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,794
I'm talking about you.

767
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:39,515
You'll take what you put in
and I'll never see you again.

768
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:42,673
I'll come to Gramsh.

769
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,393
No, you won't.

770
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,590
Your copy confirming
the cancellation of the loan...

771
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,998
The receipt to sign...

772
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,354
And your money.

773
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,469
Goodbye.

774
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,749
I'm taking back
that extra 1,000 I gave you too.

775
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:54,830
I paid in 5,600?

776
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,315
5,600 was what I paid in?

777
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,438
You knowbetter than I do.

778
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,596
The first truck.

779
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,672
I'll be in Milan a month.

780
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,789
Then I'll come to see you in Gramsh.

781
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,035
What?

782
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,709
See you soon.

783
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,834
Give me your phone.

784
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,591
Why?

785
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,159
Your SIM card.

786
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,279
What if I need to call?

787
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:07,919
Ask Spirou.

788
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,518
Not taking the motorway?

789
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,112
I need to get petrol.

790
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,193
There's a place.

791
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,476
I'll pee while you get petrol.

792
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:32,029
Not this one.
I know a cheaper place.

793
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:51,115
I need to pee. Stop.

794
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,072
Can't you wait?

795
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,116
No.

796
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,556
You don't need your bag to piss.

797
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,637
They want to kill us.

798
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:56,276
Don't be scared. I'll protect you.

799
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:27,711
We'll keep running.

800
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,593
It's safer.

801
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,950
We can make ourselves a fire.

802
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,830
I'll get us firewood.

803
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:46,874
You hear that?

804
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,315
I won't let you die.

805
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:15,675
Ever.

806
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,759
I let your father die.

807
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:24,837
You'll live.

808
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,277
We'll sleep now.

809
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,429
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

810
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:32,635
We'll find something
to drink and eat.

811
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,834
We'll go and ask at a house.

812
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,633
Don't worry.

813
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,872
Someone's bound
to give us something.

814
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,793
Sleep tight.
