1
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,230
Vercors' famous novel

2
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,553
The Silence of the Sea

3
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,317
In memory of the murdered poet,
Saint-Pol-Roux

4
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,272
This film does not claim to provide
a solution to the relations...

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,153
...between France and Germany,
which will remain problematic...

6
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,998
...while the barbaric Nazi crimes...

7
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,671
...carried out with the collusion
of the German people stay in our minds

8
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,590
He had left like that

9
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,476
He submitted to life like all the others

10
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,793
Like the whole wretched nation

11
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,994
And I tried to remember everything
that had happened in these six months

12
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,998
The evenings, his words...

13
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,875
...the rebellion that even this man
did not have the courage to continue...

14
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,991
...against his master's orders

15
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,717
His arrival was preceded by a great deal
of military preparation

16
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,198
Later the gangling soldier came back
accompanied by another

17
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,473
They spoke to me
in what they thought was French

18
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,352
I didn't understand a word

19
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,389
But I showed them
the unoccupied rooms

20
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,117
They seemed satisfied

21
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,279
The next morning...

22
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,676
...an army car
made its way into the garden

23
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,316
Two soldiers extricated two boxes

24
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,999
The car left and a few hours later
I heard horses

25
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,951
Three men on horseback appeared

26
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,439
They had pushed my workbench clamp
between stones in the wall...

27
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,476
...attached a rope to it and the horses
to the rope by the barn, my workshop

28
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,198
Nothing happened for the next two days

29
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,958
I didn't see anyone

30
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,353
The men left early with their horses

31
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,508
They returned with them in the evening,
sleeping on the straw they had put down

32
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,511
Then on the morning of the third day,
the army car returned

33
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,068
A pair of sheets, please

34
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,477
My niece had just brought me my coffee
as she did every evening

35
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,192
Coffee helps me to sleep

36
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,637
I was sitting at the end of the room,
more or less in the dark

37
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,358
If you please

38
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,670
My name is Werner von Ebrennac

39
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,272
I'm very sorry, I...

40
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,795
It was necessary, of course.
I would have avoided it, if I'd been able

41
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,718
My orderly will do everything he can
not to disrupt you

42
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,958
I have a deep respect
for people who love their country

43
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,192
I could go to my room now,
but I don't know the way

44
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,353
My niece opened the door leading
onto the stairs and started to climb...

45
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,268
...without looking at the officer
as if she was alone

46
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,599
The officer followed her

47
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,393
I noticed that he had a limp

48
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,391
My niece came back down

49
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,233
Thank God, he seems quite decent

50
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,431
Next morning the officer came down
as we were breakfasting in the kitchen

51
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,635
A different staircase leads down to it

52
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,788
I don't know if he'd heard us
or if he just happened to come this way

53
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,069
He said

54
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,111
I had a very good night

55
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,115
I hope yours was as good

56
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,875
Your old mayor said
I'd be staying at the Château

57
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,313
But I'll thank my men for getting it wrong.
It's much more beautiful here

58
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,316
He returned at the same time as before.
We were having coffee

59
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,439
He knocked but didn't wait for my niece
and opened the door himself

60
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,911
I fear I'm disturbing you

61
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,837
If you prefer,
I'll come in via the kitchen?

62
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,355
Then you can lock this door

63
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,872
I bid you good night

64
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,510
We never locked the door

65
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,952
I'm not sure this was for a very clear
or blameless reason

66
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,515
My niece and I had silently agreed
not to change our lives at all...

67
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,551
...not even the slightest detail

68
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,196
As if the officer didn't exist.
As if he were a ghost

69
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,313
But in my heart
there may have been another reason

70
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,871
It pains me to offend anyone,
even if he is my enemy

71
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,552
For a long time, more than a month,
the same scenario was played out

72
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,399
The officer would knock and enter

73
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,559
He would say something about
the weather, the temperature

74
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,194
or some such subject of little importance

75
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,596
Their common trait -
none of them required a response

76
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,229
He always lingered at the hearth.
He looked around him

77
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,354
A faint smile betrayed the pleasure
he took in this exercise

78
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,790
Always the same exercise,
always the same pleasure

79
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,349
His eyes rested
on my niece's bowed profile...

80
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,358
...which was always severe
and impassive

81
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,358
When he finally took his eyes off her...

82
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,029
...I saw in them
a kind of smiling approval

83
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,037
I bid you good night

84
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,599
Things suddenly changed one evening

85
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,352
A light snow was falling, mixed with rain,
it would both freeze and drench you

86
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,598
I put the thickest logs on the fire
that had been set aside for such days

87
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,635
I imagined the officer outside covered in
a sprinkling of snow on his return

88
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,751
But he didn't return

89
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,996
It was long past his usual time...

90
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,874
...and to my annoyance
I found myself thinking about him

91
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,989
My niece was knitting slowly
and with great concentration

92
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,469
Finally we heard footsteps...

93
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,194
...but they came from inside the house

94
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,552
From the uneven sound
I could tell it was the officer

95
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,719
He'd come in by the other door
and was now leaving his room

96
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,675
He no doubt hadn't wanted to appear
inglorious in his drenched uniform

97
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,791
He had first changed

98
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,435
The footsteps, one loud, one quiet,
came down the stairs

99
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,708
The door opened
and the officer appeared

100
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,751
He was in mufti

101
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,795
Excuse me, I'm not very warm.
I got drenched and my room is very cold

102
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,276
I'll warm myself by your fire
for a moment

103
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,917
That's good

104
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,712
This is nothing.
The French winter is mild

105
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,108
It's hard where I'm from, very hard

106
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,715
We have fir trees,
the forests are tightly packed

107
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,317
The snow sits heavy on them

108
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,119
The trees here are delicate
the snow covers them like lace

109
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,751
Germany is like a powerful thickset bull...

110
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,872
...which needs all its strength to stay alive

111
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,795
Here, it's all intellect, thought,
subtle and poetic

112
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,951
I've always loved France. Always

113
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,519
My childhood thoughts
in the last war mean nothing

114
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,200
But I've always loved it since

115
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,109
But it was from a distance.
Like the "Faraway Princess"

116
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,231
Because of my father

117
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,831
Because of my father

118
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,312
He was very patriotic

119
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,959
The defeat was very painful for him

120
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,115
But he loved France

121
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,870
He liked Briand. He believed
in the Weimar Republic and in Briand

122
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,431
He was very enthusiastic

123
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,959
He would say,
"He'll unite us like man and wife"

124
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,476
He thought the sun
would finally rise over Europe

125
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,477
But Briand was defeated

126
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,993
My father saw that France
was still run by your cruel upper classes

127
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:51,592
Men like de Wendels, Henri Bordeaux
and the old Marshal

128
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,679
He said to me, never go to France...

129
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,109
...unless it is in a soldier's garb

130
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,477
I made him that promise
because he was dying

131
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,228
When war broke out,
I knew all of Europe, except France

132
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,476
I'm a musician.
I'm not a performer, I compose music

133
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,797
It's my whole life

134
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,389
So it's strange for me to see myself
as a fighting man

135
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,399
But I don't ...
I don't regret this war

136
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,799
No, I think
some great good will come of it

137
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:50,032
Forgive me if I have offended you
but I sincerely believe what I said

138
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,275
Out of love for France

139
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,279
Great things will come of it
for both Germany and France

140
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,751
I think as my father did
that the sun will shine again on Europe

141
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,718
I bid you good night

142
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,670
Perhaps it's inhumane
to refuse to speak to him

143
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,074
I almost felt myself blush

144
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,239
From that day on
this was the pattern his visits took

145
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,555
We rarely saw him in his uniform...

146
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,151
...he changed first,
then knocked at our door

147
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,919
Whether to spare us the enemy uniform...

148
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,555
...to make us forget
or to get to know the man?

149
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,557
Both, no doubt

150
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,595
He knocked and entered, not waiting
for the reply he knew we wouldn't give

151
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,831
He did it in the most natural way
and warmed himself

152
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,829
This was always his excuse,
but neither he nor we believed it...

153
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,873
...and he did not try to disguise
its conventionality

154
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,112
He didn't come every single evening
but I don't remember one...

155
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,310
...when he did not talk

156
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,912
He leaned over the fire,
and while he warmed himself...

157
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,508
...his deep voice would gently rise...

158
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,236
...and he would talk about the things
close to his heart...

159
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,591
...his country, music, France

160
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,270
It was always a monologue...

161
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,313
...as he never tried to prise from us
a response, an agreement...

162
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,237
...or even a look

163
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,788
He wouldn't speak for long,
never longer than on the first evening

164
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,629
He would say a few sentences,
sometimes broken by silence...

165
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,673
...sometimes linked up with the
monotonous continuity of a prayer

166
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,839
He would sometimes stand motionless,
a caryatid against the chimney breast...

167
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,317
...or without breaking off,
go up to an object or a picture

168
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,797
Then he would fall silent,
bow and bid us goodnight

169
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,348
Once, in the early days of his visits,
he said...

170
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,597
How is this different from
a fire at home?

171
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,478
The wood, the hearth, the flame
are the same, but the light is different

172
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,957
This one depends on the objects it lights,
the people in this room

173
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,760
Why do I like this room so much?

174
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,109
It's not so beautiful.
Oh, I'm sorry, I mean...

175
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,072
It's not a museum piece.
Your furniture, not beautiful artefacts...

176
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,634
No, but this room has a soul

177
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,750
The whole house has a soul

178
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,557
Balzac, Baudelaire, Corneille, Descartes,
Fénelon, Gautier, Hugo

179
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,956
What a line-up! And I've only got to 'H'

180
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,552
Not as far as Molière, Racine, Rabelais.
Pascal, Stendhal, Voltaire, Montaigne...

181
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,908
...and all the others

182
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,757
With the English,
you immediately think of Shakespeare

183
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,757
With the Italians, Dante

184
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,189
With Spain, Cervantes...

185
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,788
...and with us, immediately Goethe

186
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,150
Then you have to stop and think...

187
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,990
...but if someone says France,
who immediately springs to mind?

188
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,076
Molière? Racine? Hugo?

189
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,272
Voltaire? Rabelais?
Or who of the others?

190
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:11,430
They're like a crowd at a theatre entrance.
You don't know who to let in first

191
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,197
But in terms of music, you think of us

192
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,437
Bach, Händel,
Beethoven, Wagner, Mozart

193
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,030
Which name do you put first?

194
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,792
And we are at war with each other!

195
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,788
But it is the last. We won't fight any more,
we will marry

196
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,719
Yes

197
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,314
It will be the most beautiful wedding
in the world

198
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,557
I bid you good night

199
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,559
My dear, I'm going back to warm up

200
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,788
But he never mentioned this meeting

201
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,958
When we entered Saintes,
I was happy that we got a good reception

202
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,471
I was very happy.
I thought it would be easy

203
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,390
Then I saw that it was not
that at all, it was cowardice

204
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,516
I felt contempt for them
and I feared for France

205
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,598
I thought, "Has it really come to this?"

206
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,837
No, I've since seen it's not so...

207
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,590
...and now I'm happy to see
its stern expression

208
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,436
I'm happy to have found here
a dignified old man...

209
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,031
...and a silent young lady

210
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:49,230
We have to overcome this silence,
we have to overcome France's silence

211
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,231
I'm glad it's so

212
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,392
Then one evening...

213
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:06,110
Yes, it's better like this, much better.
It makes for a better union

214
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,596
A union in which each side
grows in greatness

215
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,996
There's a lovely fairytale that I've read,
that you've read, that everyone has read

216
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,831
I don't know if the title is the same
We call it 'Das Tier und die Schöne'...

217
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,916
'Beauty and the Beast'

218
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,634
Poor Beauty. She is at the mercy
of the Beast, his powerless prisoner

219
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,958
She is subjected to his impassive
and heavy presence all day long

220
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,358
Beauty is proud, dignified,
she has become hard

221
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,553
But the Beast is better than it seems
It doesn't have the finest manners

222
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,671
It is gauche, brutal

223
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,993
It seems uncouth
next to the refined Beauty

224
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,752
But it has a heart.
Yes, a soul which aspires to greater things

225
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,312
If Beauty wanted

226
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,514
Beauty takes a long time to do so

227
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,873
But gradually she discovers a light
in her hated captor's eyes...

228
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,959
...a light where entreaty
and love are discernible

229
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,953
She becomes less aware
of its heavy paw, her prison chains

230
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,949
She stops hating it. Its constancy
touches her and she gives it her hand

231
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,957
The Beast is immediately transformed

232
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,995
The spell that had trapped him
in this barbaric pelt is broken

233
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,070
He is a handsome knight with a pure heart,
sensitive and cultured...

234
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,716
...and every kiss from Beauty adorns him
with ever more glorious qualities

235
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,433
Their union leads
to their sublime happiness

236
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,591
Their children who combine
their parents' talents...

237
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,870
...are the most beautiful on earth

238
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,711
Don't you like this fairytale?

239
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,551
I've always loved it

240
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,750
I'm always reading it

241
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,116
It used to make me cry

242
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,033
I especially like the Beast
because I understood his suffering

243
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,550
It still moves me today
when I talk about it

244
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,717
I bid you good night

245
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,558
One evening when I went up to my room
to get some tobacco...

246
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,353
...I heard the strains of the harmonium

247
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,115
The Eighth Prelude and Fugue my niece
had been practising before the disaster

248
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,435
The score stayed open at that page...

249
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,759
...but until then
my niece had not practised again

250
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,270
I was pleased and surprised
she had gone back to it

251
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,796
What emotional need could have suddenly
made her take it up again?

252
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,314
No, she had not left her chair or her work

253
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,070
There's nothing greater

254
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,800
Great is not quite the right word

255
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,154
Beyond man, beyond his flesh

256
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,274
It makes us realise... no... guess... no...

257
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,552
...sense what nature is...

258
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,798
...divine nature,
divested of the human mind

259
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,912
Yes, it's inhuman music

260
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,591
Bach. He could only be German

261
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,395
Our land has this inhuman characteristic

262
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,393
By 'inhuman' I mean
it's not on the same scale as men

263
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,278
I love this music, I admire it
It overwhelms me

264
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,188
It is like God's presence in me

265
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,918
But it's not my music

266
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,036
I want to compose music
on a human scale

267
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,111
It's a way of arriving at the truth.
My way

268
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,279
I don't want another,
I can't follow any other

269
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,836
I know that now. I know it for sure

270
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,952
Since when?

271
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,791
Since I've been here

272
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:40,277
Now I need France, but I ask a lot of her.
I ask her to welcome me

273
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,200
It doesn't mean anything to be here
as a foreigner, a traveller, a conqueror

274
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,229
She doesn't give anything
because you can't take anything from her

275
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:55,273
Her wealth, her great wealth
will not be conquered

276
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,834
You have to drink her milk

277
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,875
She has to offer you her milk
like a mother

278
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,152
I know that depends on us
but it depends on her, too

279
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,633
She has to be willing
to understand our thirst...

280
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,676
...and to quench it

281
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,757
She has to be ready to join with us

282
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:29,156
I need to live here for a long time,
in a house like this

283
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,598
Like the son of a village, a village like this
I need...

284
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,829
Obstacles have to be overcome

285
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,997
Sincerity can always overcome obstacles

286
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,437
I bid you good night

287
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,558
I don't remember all that was said
over a hundred winter evenings

288
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,550
But it was always the same

289
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,719
Always his rapture
about his discovery of France

290
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,991
The love he had felt from afar
before coming here

291
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:27,752
The love which grew each day
since he had the good fortune to live here

292
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,473
And I have to say I admired him

293
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:47,429
He never got discouraged, never tried
to break our intractable silence...

294
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,551
...by any verbal outbursts

295
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,598
On the contrary, when he sometimes
let the silence take over the room...

296
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,236
...and seep into its corners
like a heavy unbreathable gas...

297
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,512
...of the three of us,
he seemed to be most at ease

298
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,154
He looked approvingly at my niece...

299
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,159
...his expression
both smiling and solemn...

300
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,840
...as it had been from the first day

301
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,836
And I felt my niece's soul struggle
in her self-imposed prison

302
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,717
I saw it in the little signs,
like the slight trembling of her fingers

303
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,430
When Werner von Ebrennac finally
gently and smoothly broke this silence...

304
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,669
...with his deep voice
I felt able to breathe more easily

305
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,956
I was born in my house in the forest.
I went to the village school

306
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:56,155
I didn't leave it until I went to Munich for my
exams and to Salzburg for the music

307
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,671
I've always lived there.
I didn't like the cities

308
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,794
I've been to London, Vienna,
Rome, Warsaw...

309
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,150
...and of course to German cities

310
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,110
I wouldn't like to live there

311
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,548
I did like Prague.
It has a soul like no other

312
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,676
And Nuremberg above all else

313
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,633
It's the city that fills a German's heart...

314
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,435
...because you find ghosts
which are close to your heart...

315
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,111
...every stone imbued with the memory
of those who made Germany noble

316
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,430
I imagine the French must feel the same
at Chartres

317
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,237
They must also feel the presence
of their ancestors...

318
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,195
...their graciousness of spirit,
the splendour of their faith, their kindness

319
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,511
Fate took me to Chartres

320
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,959
Attention!

321
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,718
350 metres. Prepare

322
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,674
Fire!

323
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,395
It's so. So many things are going on
in a German's head

324
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,275
Even in the best German,
and he'd be glad to be cured of them

325
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,234
In the country house near us
lives a young woman

326
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,600
She is very beautiful and very sweet

327
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,670
My father would have been happy
if I had married her

328
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,678
We were practically engaged
when he died...

329
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,553
...and we went for long walks on our own

330
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,517
One day we were in the forest and...

331
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,154
I'm so happy, Werner

332
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,919
- All God's creations are so wonderful.
- Yes, I'm happy too

333
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,836
Wretched creature! It stung me

334
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,435
Look, I've caught it, Werner

335
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,236
Now I'm going to punish it

336
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:55,196
I'll tear off its legs, one by one

337
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,918
Fortunately she had a lot of other suitors

338
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,270
I have no regrets

339
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,188
But I'm terrified of German girls now

340
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:23,356
Our politicians are like that too
I never wanted anything to do with them

341
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,996
Even though my friends wrote saying,
"Come and join us"

342
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,109
No

343
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,350
I always preferred to stay at home

344
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,758
It wasn't the best thing for the success
of my music, but too bad

345
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,395
Success counts for little
compared to a clear conscience

346
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,038
I know that my friends and the Führer
have the greatest and most noble ideas

347
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,433
But I also know that they would tear off
mosquitoes' legs, one by one

348
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,950
That always happens to Germans
when they are lonely

349
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,991
It always comes back

350
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,152
Who is lonelier than the men in the Party
when they rule?

351
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,795
Fortunately they're not alone now.
They are in France

352
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,717
France will cure them

353
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,320
And they know it

354
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,956
They know France will teach them
to be truly great and pure-hearted

355
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,591
But for that, they need love

356
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,917
A shared love

357
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,032
I bid you good night

358
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,799
The long spring days arrived

359
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,674
The officer now returned
with the last of the sun's rays

360
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,916
The Führer announces far-reaching
historic decisions will be made

361
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,749
One evening he came down,
a book closed over his finger

362
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,195
He wore the suppressed half smile
of one who knows...

363
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,356
...he is about to make others happy...

364
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,674
He said

365
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,554
I'm sorry to disturb you so early
but I have this for you

366
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,716
It's from 'Macbeth'

367
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,872
Such greatness

368
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,273
It's at the end

369
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,872
Macbeth's power is slipping away
and with it the loyalty of those...

370
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,072
...who finally realise
the depths of his ambition

371
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,551
The noblemen who defend Scotland's
honour waiting for his imminent downfall

372
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,114
One of them describes
the dramatic symptoms of this downfall

373
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,432
Angus: now does he feel
his secret murders sticking on his hands

374
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,075
He is upbraided by a revolt each minute
for his breach of faith

375
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,958
Those he commands
move only in command

376
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,672
Nothing in love

377
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,871
Now does he feel his title
hang loose about him...

378
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,549
...like a giant's robe
upon a dwarfish thief

379
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,356
That's what must give your president
some sleepless nights

380
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,909
I pity this man, despite the contempt
he inspires in me and in you

381
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,837
Those he commands
move only in command, nothing in love

382
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,035
A leader who does not have the love
of his people is a miserable puppet

383
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,799
But can we hope for anything else?

384
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,119
Who but a dreary climber
would have taken on this role?

385
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:35,836
There needed to be someone
who would sell his country...

386
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:41,353
...because today France
cannot willingly fall into our open arms...

387
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,711
...without losing her dignity
in her own eyes

388
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:51,636
Often the most sordid go-between
is responsible for the happiest union

389
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,197
The go-between is no less contemptible
for it, nor the union less happy

390
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,718
The Paris train

391
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,753
I must inform my hosts
I shall be away for two weeks

392
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,991
I'm delighted about going to Paris

393
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:13,194
I have my leave and I'm going to spend it
in Paris, for the first time

394
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,231
It's a big day for me

395
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:20,992
The biggest, while I wait for another
which I hope for with all my soul

396
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,759
It will be an even bigger day

397
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,795
I can wait. For years, if need be

398
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,831
My heart is very patient

399
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,710
In Paris I'll see my friends

400
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,549
Many are party to the negotiations
being conducted with your politicians...

401
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,150
...in preparation for the wonderful union
of our two nations

402
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,716
In a way I'll witness this marriage

403
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:54,317
I want to tell you that I'm happy for France
whose wounds will quickly heal

404
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,032
But I'm even happier for Germany
and for myself

405
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,428
No one will ever have benefited more
from a good deed than Germany will...

406
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,269
...by restoring France's greatness
and freedom

407
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,231
I bid you good night

408
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,796
The French army
threatened to invade England

409
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,276
The Third Coalition took up arms
on the continent

410
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,153
Napoleon entered Vienna,
he triumphed at Austerlitz

411
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,590
In less than 100 days
the Coalition was dissolved

412
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,954
I was sent here by God, King of Heaven,
to drive you out of France

413
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,798
We didn't see him when he returned

414
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,552
We knew he was there, there are
many signs of a guest in the house...

415
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,671
...even if he remains invisible

416
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:49,438
But for a number of days,
more than a week, we didn't see him

417
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,758
Should I admit to it?
This absence troubled me

418
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,591
I thought about him

419
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,359
I think I felt regret and concern

420
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,718
Neither my niece nor I spoke of it

421
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,960
But when in the evening,
we heard his uneven tread...

422
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:16,715
...I saw from the way she suddenly and
stubbornly applied herself to her work...

423
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,400
...and from the faint lines
on her face...

424
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,479
...giving her an expression that was
both determined and expectant...

425
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,036
...that her thoughts were similar to mine

426
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,913
I had to go to the German headquarters
to make some declaration about tyres

427
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,712
Come in

428
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,431
For a free Europe

429
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,076
What do you want?

430
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,553
Lieutenant

431
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,877
- Make five copies and send them one.
- Yes, Lieutenant

432
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:35,831
I didn't say anything about it to my niece,
but women have a feline intuition

433
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,755
All evening she kept looking up
from her work...

434
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,955
...and looking at me
trying to discern something in my face...

435
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:53,712
...which I forced into an expressionless
blank by diligently drawing on my pipe

436
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,911
She finally dropped her hands
as if she was tired...

437
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:25,071
...and folding the material asked for
my permission to go to bed early

438
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:47,117
She kissed me and I think I saw
in her beautiful grey eyes...

439
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,949
...a reproach and a heavy sadness

440
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,235
Once she had left
I felt an absurd anger rise in me

441
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,273
Anger at being absurd
and having an absurd niece

442
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,192
What was this stupidity?
I couldn't answer that

443
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:11,196
If it was stupidity
it seemed to be deeply ingrained

444
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,311
Three days later,
just as we were finishing our coffee...

445
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,956
...we heard the familiar footsteps
with their irregular tread...

446
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:17,038
...coming in our direction

447
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,076
I suddenly remembered that winter evening
when we had first heard his footsteps...

448
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,191
...six months earlier

449
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,198
I thought, it's raining today too

450
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,153
My niece had put a square of printed silk
around her shoulders

451
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,638
I was warming my hands on the bowl
of my pipe and it was summer!

452
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,436
I thought I could see a man
behind the door...

453
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,279
...his forefinger raised, ready to knock...

454
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,517
...and delaying the moment...

455
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,395
...for by the very act of knocking,
he would set in motion the future

456
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,191
Finally he knocked

457
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:04,672
Not with the lightness of one hesitating
nor the brusqueness of shyness overcome

458
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,758
They were three full and long knocks

459
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,271
Calm, assured knocks of a decision
on which there was no going back

460
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,238
I was expecting to see the door open
immediately as usual

461
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:23,757
But it remained shut and I was overcome
by an uncontrollable uneasiness

462
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,991
He's going to leave

463
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:44,555
What should I do to behave with dignity
on this evening?

464
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,912
Come in, sir

465
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,035
I learned then that the hands,
if you observe them well...

466
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,232
...can be as expressive as the face

467
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,349
Even better than the face...

468
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,517
...as they more easily escape
the control of the will

469
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:43,159
I have something serious to tell you

470
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,112
Everything I have said
these past six months

471
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,150
Everything the walls of this room
have heard...

472
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,597
...you have to...

473
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,917
...you have to forget

474
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,996
Such a light!

475
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,796
I saw these victorious men

476
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,711
I spoke to them

477
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,913
They laughed at me

478
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,592
I had been so happy to go there

479
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,231
Treblinka?

480
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,557
- Yes, what about it?
- What's the significance of Treblinka?

481
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,956
- Nothing, nothing now.
- Why "not any more"?

482
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,874
Let's not talk about that.
It's not for the faint-hearted

483
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:42,668
<i>The mass executions take place</i>
<i>in the gas chambers constructed here...

484
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,952
<i>...with carbon monoxide</i>
<i>and in the cremation ovens</i>

485
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:51,551
<i>There is currently</i>
<i>a throughput of 500 people a day...

486
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:55,432
<i>...but improvements are underway...

487
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,074
<i>...so that within two months...

488
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,671
<i>...this figure can be increased</i>
<i>to 2, 000 people a day</i>

489
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,235
<i>Treblinka, 21 March, 1941</i>

490
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,837
The start of spring!

491
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,597
The start of spring!

492
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,392
So these gas chambers
are currently in use

493
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,911
No, Treblinka has already
served its purpose. It's done with

494
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,510
There's no one left to execute

495
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,156
Chemical examination post
Medical centre

496
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:21,594
I'm surprised by your opinion on this

497
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,948
Haven't you realised
that we're duping them?

498
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,073
Do you think we're foolish enough
to let France rise up again?

499
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:34,230
We're not musicians

500
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:39,229
Politics isn't the stuff of fantasy.
Why do you think we went to war?

501
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:43,194
- For the sake of their old Marshal?
- We're not mad

502
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:47,598
We have the opportunity to destroy
France and that's what we will do

503
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,712
Not just its power, but its spirit as well

504
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:55,356
That's where the greatest danger lies.
That's our duty

505
01:07:55,480 --> 01:08:00,793
Make no mistake,
we'll do it with smiles and with care...

506
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:03,673
...but we'll make France crawl on its belly

507
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:08,112
You've been too influenced by France
in your youth, that's the danger...

508
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,677
...but we'll cure Europe of this disease,
we'll root out this poison

509
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,792
We'll flatter the writers of course...

510
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,559
...but we've already taken
the necessary measures

511
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,117
In Belgium and Holland
and in every country we occupy

512
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:29,759
French books will be allowed
except technical publications

513
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,952
There will be no literary works.
None!

514
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,548
We'll rip the venom from the beast

515
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,152
Getting frightened

516
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:43,957
Now they fear for their pockets,
their stomachs, their industry and trade

517
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,232
That's all they're worried about

518
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:53,390
There are exceptions, of course,
but we'll flatter them to death

519
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,189
- Nothing could be easier.
- Just for a plate of lentils

520
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:00,515
Do you realise what you're doing?

521
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:05,316
- Do you realise?
- Do you think we'll falter?

522
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,396
We're made of stronger stuff

523
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:13,108
You will seal France's downfall
forever

524
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,871
It's a matter of life and death

525
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,390
Violence can conquer but it cannot rule

526
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:25,036
We know that.
It takes more than an army to rule

527
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:29,039
Not at the price of the spirit
Not at that price

528
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,755
The spirit? It has already seen a lot

529
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,715
The spirit is immortal.
We're building a thousand year Reich

530
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,558
First we have to destroy

531
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,592
That's our right and our duty

532
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,356
On September 19, 1941
another German soldier was murdered

533
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,234
To atone for this cowardly crime
the following were shot

534
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,237
Wait a moment

535
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,397
A box of matches, please

536
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,751
There is no hope

537
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,072
No hope

538
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,792
Nothing

539
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,871
No one

540
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,677
Not just the modern authors.
Not just Péguy, Proust, Bergson

541
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,315
But all the others, all of these.
All of them

542
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,951
They will extinguish the light

543
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,432
Completely

544
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,992
That light will never shine again on Europe

545
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,478
One of these men was my friend

546
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,591
He was like a brother

547
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:10,431
We studied together.
We shared a room in Stuttgart

548
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,108
We spent three months together
in Nuremberg

549
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,148
I played him my music

550
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,271
He read me his poems

551
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,271
He was sensitive and romantic

552
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,032
But he left me

553
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,038
He went to read his poems in München,
in Munich

554
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,230
To new friends

555
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,716
He was always writing
asking me to join him

556
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,714
It was he I saw in Paris with his friends

557
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,233
I saw what they had done to him

558
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:56,679
He was the angriest of them all
He combined anger and laughter

559
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:04,193
He shouted "It's venomous, we have
to extract the venom from the beast"

560
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,634
I said,
"Do you realise what you're doing?"

561
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:16,275
I looked at him,
I looked into his bright eyes

562
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,790
He meant what he said,
that's the worst part

563
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,311
They will do what they say...

564
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,311
...methodically and resolutely

565
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,591
I know these stubborn devils

566
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:41,996
His lips opened and I thought he was
going to launch into some exhortation

567
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,635
I thought he was going to encourage us
to rebel

568
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,710
But no word passed his lips

569
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:56,116
They said to me,
"It's our right and our duty"

570
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:00,271
"Our duty"

571
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:05,269
Lucky the man
who so easily finds the path to his duty

572
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,033
At the crossroads, you're told,
take that route

573
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:19,436
This route does not take you
towards the shining heights...

574
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:25,439
...it descends into a gloomy valley...

575
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:29,439
...deep into the dark, dank forest

576
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,829
Oh God, show me where my duty lies

577
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,793
Can duty ever mean accepting the crime?

578
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,670
I've exercised my rights.
I've asked to join a fighting division

579
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,231
They've finally agreed to it

580
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:29,872
I'm authorised to leave tomorrow
and return to battle

581
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,192
Towards Hell

582
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,718
I bid you good night

583
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,514
Goodbye

584
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:11,914
Goodbye

585
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:16,309
You'd have to have been waiting
to have heard this word

586
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:20,911
But finally I heard it.
Von Ebrennac heard it, too

587
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,271
Take my things downstairs

588
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:54,788
It is a fine thing when a soldier disobeys
criminal orders

589
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:16,548
All set, Lieutenant

590
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:27,515
Yes, I'm coming

591
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,431
My niece had made me breakfast
as usual

592
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,556
She served me in silence

593
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,836
We drank our coffee in silence

594
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:41,032
Outside a pale sun was shining
through the mist

595
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,836
It felt very cold to me

596
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:59,271
It felt very cold to me
October 1941

597
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,236
The publication of this book
was funded by a patriot

598
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:09,070
The printing was completed under
Nazi Occupation on 20 February 1942
