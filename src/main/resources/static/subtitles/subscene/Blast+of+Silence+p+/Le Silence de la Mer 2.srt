1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,450
I always preferred to stay at home

2
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,858
It wasn't the best thing for the success
of my music, but too bad

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,495
Success counts for little
compared to a clear conscience

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:26,138
I know that my friends and the FÃ¼hrer
have the greatest and most noble ideas

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,533
But I also know that they would tear off
mosquitoes' legs, one by one

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,050
That always happens to Germans
when they are lonely

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,091
It always comes back

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,252
Who is lonelier than the men in the Party
when they rule?

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,895
Fortunately they're not alone now.
They are in France

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,817
France will cure them

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,420
And they know it

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,056
They know France will teach them
to be truly great and pure-hearted

13
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,691
But for that, they need love

14
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,017
A shared love

15
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,132
I bid you good night

16
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,899
The long spring days arrived

17
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,774
The officer now returned
with the last of the sun's rays

18
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,016
The Fuhrer announces far-reaching
historic decisions will be made

19
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,849
One evening he came down,
a book closed over his finger

20
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,295
He wore the suppressed half smile
of one who knows...

21
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,456
...he is about to make others happy...

22
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,774
He said

23
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,654
I'm sorry to disturb you so early
but I have this for you

24
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,816
It's from 'Macbeth'

25
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,972
Such greatness

26
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,373
It's at the end

27
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,972
Macbeth's power is slipping away
and with it the loyalty of those...

28
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,172
...who finally realise
the depths of his ambition

29
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,651
The noblemen who defend Scotland's
honour waiting for his imminent downfall

30
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,214
One of them describes
the dramatic symptoms of this downfall

31
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,532
Angus: now does he feel
his secret murders sticking on his hands

32
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,175
He is upbraided by a revolt each minute
for his breach of faith

33
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,058
Those he commands
move only in command

34
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,772
Nothing in love

35
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,971
Now does he feel his title
hang loose about him...

36
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,649
...like a giant's robe
upon a dwarfish thief

37
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,456
That's what must give your president
some sleepless nights

38
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,009
I pity this man, despite the contempt
he inspires in me and in you

39
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,937
Those he commands
move only in command, nothing in love

40
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,135
A leader who does not have the love
of his people is a miserable puppet

41
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,899
But can we hope for anything else?

42
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,219
Who but a dreary climber
would have taken on this role?

43
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,936
There needed to be someone
who would sell his country...

44
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,453
...because today France
cannot willingly fall into our open arms...

45
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,811
...without losing her dignity
in her own eyes

46
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:22,736
Often the most sordid go-between
is responsible for the happiest union

47
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,297
The go-between is no less contemptible
for it, nor the union less happy

48
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,818
The Paris train

49
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,853
I must inform my hosts
I shall be away for two weeks

50
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,091
I'm delighted about going to Paris

51
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,294
I have my leave and I'm going to spend it
in Paris, for the first time

52
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,331
It's a big day for me

53
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,092
The biggest, while I wait for another
which I hope for with all my soul

54
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,859
It will be an even bigger day

55
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,895
I can wait. For years, if need be

56
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,931
My heart is very patient

57
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,810
In Paris I'll see my friends

58
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,649
Many are party to the negotiations
being conducted with your politicians...

59
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,250
...in preparation for the wonderful union
of our two nations

60
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,816
In a way I'll witness this marriage

61
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,417
I want to tell you that I'm happy for France
whose wounds will quickly heal

62
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,132
But I'm even happier for Germany
and for myself

63
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,528
No one will ever have benefited more
from a good deed than Germany will...

64
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,369
...by restoring France's greatness
and freedom

65
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,331
I bid you good night

66
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,896
The French army
threatened to invade England

67
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,376
The Third Coalition took up arms
on the continent

68
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,253
Napoleon entered Vienna,
he triumphed at Austerlitz

69
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,690
In less than 100 days
the Coalition was dissolved

70
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,054
I was sent here by God, King of Heaven,
to drive you out of France

71
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,898
We didn't see him when he returned

72
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,652
We knew he was there, there are
many signs of a guest in the house...

73
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,771
...even if he remains invisible

74
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,538
But for a number of days,
more than a week, we didn't see him

75
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,858
Should I admit to it?
This absence troubled me

76
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,691
I thought about him

77
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,459
I think I felt regret and concern

78
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,818
Neither my niece nor I spoke of it

79
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,060
But when in the evening,
we heard his uneven tread...

80
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,815
...I saw from the way she suddenly and
stubbornly applied herself to her work...

81
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,500
...and from the faint lines
on her face...

82
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,579
...giving her an expression that was
both determined and expectant...

83
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,136
...that her thoughts were similar to mine

84
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:10,013
I had to go to the German headquarters
to make some declaration about tyres

85
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,812
Come in

86
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,531
For a free Europe

87
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,176
What do you want?

88
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,653
Lieutenant

89
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,977
- Make five copies and send them one.
- Yes, Lieutenant

90
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,931
I didn't say anything about it to my niece,
but women have a feline intuition

91
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,855
All evening she kept looking up
from her work...

92
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,055
...and looking at me
trying to discern something in my face...

93
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,812
...which I forced into an expressionless
blank by diligently drawing on my pipe

94
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,011
She finally dropped her hands
as if she was tired...

95
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,171
...and folding the material asked for
my permission to go to bed early

96
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,217
She kissed me and I think I saw
in her beautiful grey eyes...

97
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,049
...a reproach and a heavy sadness

98
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,335
Once she had left
I felt an absurd anger rise in me

99
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,373
Anger at being absurd
and having an absurd niece

100
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,292
What was this stupidity?
I couldn't answer that

101
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,296
If it was stupidity
it seemed to be deeply ingrained

102
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,411
Three days later,
just as we were finishing our coffee...

103
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,056
...we heard the familiar footsteps
with their irregular tread...

104
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,138
...coming in our direction

105
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,176
I suddenly remembered that winter evening
when we had first heard his footsteps...

106
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,291
...six months earlier

107
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,298
I thought, it's raining today too

108
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,253
My niece had put a square of printed silk
around her shoulders

109
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,738
I was warming my hands on the bowl
of my pipe and it was summer!

110
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,536
I thought I could see a man
behind the door...

111
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,379
...his forefinger raised, ready to knock...

112
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,617
...and delaying the moment...

113
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,495
...for by the very act of knocking,
he would set in motion the future

114
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,291
Finally he knocked

115
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,772
Not with the lightness of one hesitating
nor the brusqueness of shyness overcome

116
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,858
They were three full and long knocks

117
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,371
Calm, assured knocks of a decision
on which there was no going back

118
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,338
I was expecting to see the door open
immediately as usual

119
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,857
But it remained shut and I was overcome
by an uncontrollable uneasiness

120
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,091
He's going to leave

121
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,655
What should I do to behave with dignity
on this evening?

122
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,012
Come in, sir

123
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,135
I learned then that the hands,
if you observe them well...

124
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,332
...can be as expressive as the face

125
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,449
Even better than the face...

126
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,617
...as they more easily escape
the control of the will

127
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,259
I have something serious to tell you

128
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,212
Everything I have said
these past six months

129
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,250
Everything the walls of this room
have heard...

130
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,697
...you have to...

131
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,017
...you have to forget

132
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,096
Such a light!

133
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,896
I saw these victorious men

134
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,811
I spoke to them

135
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,013
They laughed at me

136
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,692
I had been so happy to go there

137
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,331
Treblinka?

138
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,657
- Yes, what about it?
- What's the significance of Treblinka?

139
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,056
- Nothing, nothing now.
- Why "not any more"?

140
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,974
Let's not talk about that.
It's not for the faint-hearted

141
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:13,768
<i>The mass executions take place
in the gas chambers constructed here...</i>

142
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,052
<i>...with carbon monoxide
and in the cremation ovens</i>

143
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,651
<i>There is currently
a throughput of 500 people a day...</i>

144
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,532
<i>...but improvements are underway...</i>

145
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,174
<i>...so that within two months...</i>

146
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,771
<i>...this figure can be increased
to 2, 000 people a day</i>

147
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,335
<i>Treblinka, 21 March, 1941</i>

148
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,937
The start of spring!

149
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,697
The start of spring!

150
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,492
So these gas chambers
are currently in use

151
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,011
No, Treblinka has already
served its purpose. It's done with

152
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,610
There's no one left to execute

153
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,256
Chemical examination post
Medical centre

154
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,694
I'm surprised by your opinion on this

155
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,048
Haven't you realised
that we're duping them?

156
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,173
Do you think we're foolish enough
to let France rise up again?

157
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,330
We're not musicians

158
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,329
Politics isn't the stuff of fantasy.
Why do you think we went to war?

159
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,294
- For the sake of their old Marshal?
- We're not mad

160
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,698
We have the opportunity to destroy
France and that's what we will do

161
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,812
Not just its power, but its spirit as well

162
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,456
That's where the greatest danger lies.
That's our duty

163
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,893
Make no mistake,
we'll do it with smiles and with care...

164
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,773
...but we'll make France crawl on its belly

165
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,212
You've been too influenced by France
in your youth, that's the danger...

166
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,777
...but we'll cure Europe of this disease,
we'll root out this poison

167
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,892
We'll flatter the writers of course...

168
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,659
...but we've already taken
the necessary measures

169
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,217
In Belgium and Holland
and in every country we occupy

170
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:00,859
French books will be allowed
except technical publications

171
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,052
There will be no literary works.
None!

172
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,648
We'll rip the venom from the beast

173
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,252
Getting frightened

174
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:15,057
Now they fear for their pockets,
their stomachs, their industry and trade

175
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,332
That's all they're worried about

176
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,490
There are exceptions, of course,
but we'll flatter them to death

177
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,289
- Nothing could be easier.
- Just for a plate of lentils

178
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,615
Do you realise what you're doing?

179
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,416
- Do you realise?
- Do you think we'll falter?

180
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,496
We're made of stronger stuff

181
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,208
You will seal France's downfall
forever

182
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,971
It's a matter of life and death

183
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,490
Violence can conquer but it cannot rule

184
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,136
We know that.
It takes more than an army to rule

185
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,139
Not at the price of the spirit
Not at that price

186
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,855
The spirit? It has already seen a lot

187
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,815
The spirit is immortal.
We're building a thousand year Reich

188
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,658
First we have to destroy

189
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,692
That's our right and our duty

190
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,456
On September 19, 1941
another German soldier was murdered

191
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,334
To atone for this cowardly crime
the following were shot

192
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,337
Wait a moment

193
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,497
A box of matches, please

194
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,851
There is no hope

195
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,172
No hope

196
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,892
Nothing

197
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,971
No one

198
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,777
Not just the modern authors.
Not just PÃ©guy, Proust, Bergson

199
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,415
But all the others, all of these.
All of them

200
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,051
They will extinguish the light

201
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,532
Completely

202
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,092
That light will never shine again on Europe

203
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,578
One of these men was my friend

204
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,691
He was like a brother

205
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,531
We studied together.
We shared a room in Stuttgart

206
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,208
We spent three months together
in Nuremberg

207
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,248
I played him my music

208
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,371
He read me his poems

209
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,371
He was sensitive and romantic

210
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,132
But he left me

211
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,138
He went to read his poems in MÃ¼nchen,
in Munich

212
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,330
To new friends

213
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,816
He was always writing
asking me to join him

214
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,814
It was he I saw in Paris with his friends

215
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,333
I saw what they had done to him

216
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,779
He was the angriest of them all
He combined anger and laughter

217
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,293
He shouted "It's venomous, we have
to extract the venom from the beast"

218
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,734
I said,
"Do you realise what you're doing?"

219
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,375
I looked at him,
I looked into his bright eyes

220
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,890
He meant what he said,
that's the worst part

221
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,411
They will do what they say...

222
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,411
...methodically and resolutely

223
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,691
I know these stubborn devils

224
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:13,096
His lips opened and I thought he was
going to launch into some exhortation

225
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,735
I thought he was going to encourage us
to rebel

226
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,810
But no word passed his lips

227
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:27,216
They said to me,
"It's our right and our duty"

228
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,371
"Our duty"

229
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,369
Lucky the man
who so easily finds the path to his duty

230
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,133
At the crossroads, you're told,
take that route

231
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:50,536
This route does not take you
towards the shining heights...

232
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,539
...it descends into a gloomy valley...

233
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,539
...deep into the dark, dank forest

234
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,929
Oh God, show me where my duty lies

235
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,893
Can duty ever mean accepting the crime?

236
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,770
I've exercised my rights.
I've asked to join a fighting division

237
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,331
They've finally agreed to it

238
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,972
I'm authorised to leave tomorrow
and return to battle

239
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,292
Towards Hell

240
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,818
I bid you good night

241
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,614
Goodbye

242
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,014
Goodbye

243
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,409
You'd have to have been waiting
to have heard this word

244
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,011
But finally I heard it.
Von Ebrennac heard it, too

245
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,371
Take my things downstairs

246
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:25,888
It is a fine thing when a soldier disobeys
criminal orders

247
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,648
All set, Lieutenant

248
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,615
Yes, I'm coming

249
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,531
My niece had made me breakfast
as usual

250
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,656
She served me in silence

251
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,936
We drank our coffee in silence

252
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,132
Outside a pale sun was shining
through the mist

253
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,936
It felt very cold to me

254
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,371
It felt very cold to me
October 1941

255
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,336
The publication of this book
was funded by a patriot

256
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,170
The printing was completed under
Nazi Occupation on 20 February 1942
