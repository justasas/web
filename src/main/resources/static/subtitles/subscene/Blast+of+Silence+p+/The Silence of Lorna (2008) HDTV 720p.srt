1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,877
- 340.
- Yes.

2
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,673
Can I see the manager?

3
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:38,474
I can give you an appointment
tomorrow.

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,194
Yes, at 12:30 if possible.

5
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:42,879
What's it about?

6
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,309
A loan I talked about to him.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,234
I'll be Belgian soon,
so I can do it.

8
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:01,795
Yes.

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,359
Fourteen thousand.

10
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:10,596
In a month, if it all goes smoothly.

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,634
When do I see you?

12
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:16,470
All right...

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,034
I'll hang up now.

14
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:22,274
I love you.

15
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,911
Me too.

16
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:26,314
Bye.

17
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,791
One euro fifty, please.

18
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,116
Excuse me.

19
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:51,394
What is it?

20
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:55,239
I know.
You called me three times already.

21
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:04,751
Thank you.

22
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,119
Thanks.

23
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:41,916
What do I owe you?

24
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:43,841
One euro ten.

25
00:03:25,843 --> 00:03:27,243
I'm going to bed.

26
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:29,478
Want to play cards?

27
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:30,558
No.

28
00:03:31,763 --> 00:03:33,276
Close the curtains.

29
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,759
Coming?

30
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:16,433
No.

31
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:18,119
I said no!

32
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:35,320
You heard? I told him no.

33
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,957
Yes, I heard.

34
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:38,799
Good night.

35
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,517
No cards then?

36
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:41,794
No.

37
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:30,242
Turn the music down!

38
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:45,041
The music... Not so loud!

39
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:10,714
Lorna...

40
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:12,481
Lorna...

41
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:21,801
Lorna!

42
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:29,722
What?

43
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:32,119
I want to talk. Let me in.

44
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:33,314
No.

45
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:36,276
I have to be up at six tomorrow.

46
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:42,116
I'm not going out tonight. I quit.

47
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:45,156
Like every week. Let me sleep.

48
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:48,803
I can stick it out this time
if you help me.

49
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:51,566
Promise me you'll help.
On my own, I...

50
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:53,916
Let me sleep, Claudy!

51
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:14,083
I need to know,
to set myself a goal for the day.

52
00:07:14,286 --> 00:07:16,278
I don't know when I'll be back.

53
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:18,717
Just give me a time.
Any time.

54
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:22,475
Five? Six?

55
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:24,442
Nine?

56
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:42,086
What time? Seven? Seven, ok?

57
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:43,515
If you want.

58
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,958
If you're late, you can call me.

59
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:49,161
Don't forget
to put your mattress back.

60
00:07:53,648 --> 00:07:56,526
- What are you doing?
- I mustn't go out. Lock me in.

61
00:07:56,728 --> 00:07:59,196
- You won't go out?
- I have to resist.

62
00:07:59,408 --> 00:08:00,124
Lock me in.

63
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:01,522
I'm not doing that.

64
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:02,285
Why not?

65
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:05,719
You'll want to go out
and I'll have to come back.

66
00:08:05,928 --> 00:08:07,566
No, I promise. Lorna!

67
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:26,085
If I get back late,
tell the boss I'll stay tonight.

68
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:27,084
I'll tell her.

69
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:28,165
Thanks.

70
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:34,841
He told them I could come back
during my break.

71
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,528
So say evenings only.

72
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,844
I said that. He didn't understand.

73
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:40,919
He's a mess. He's quitting.

74
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:41,844
Terminal 4.

75
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:45,081
Mr Ventura.
Can you take it, Fabio?

76
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:47,122
I'll take it.

77
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:51,639
He wants to quit this time.
He asked me to help.

78
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:54,123
He'll be high again tomorrow.

79
00:08:56,088 --> 00:08:58,887
If he does manage to quit,
what do we do?

80
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,046
As planned, we give him an OD.

81
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:04,045
Will the police believe it?

82
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:05,841
Of course they will.

83
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:09,122
Junkies quit, use again
and OD all the time.

84
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:16,401
Damn cops!
Nothing for six months till now.

85
00:09:16,609 --> 00:09:18,406
Just when you become Belgian.

86
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:20,558
Wait for me?

87
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,487
I have to go to the airport.

88
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,840
Show them the wedding photo.

89
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,764
Claudy?

90
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:45,442
Where's the police?

91
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,803
Not here.
I felt bad, I wanted to see you.

92
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,363
Get out of my bed.

93
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:54,163
- I thought I could.
- On it, not in it!

94
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,529
Look what you've done!

95
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,846
Sorry.

96
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,882
Get a cloth.

97
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,169
The police weren't here.

98
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,006
He just wanted me to come back.

99
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:37,722
Don't ever do this again.

100
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,489
I didn't feel good.

101
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,090
I don't care.

102
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,764
I'll be late.
I won't have time to eat.

103
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:46,563
Shall I make a sandwich?

104
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:02,760
Who is it?

105
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:05,128
- Want anything?
- Get lost!

106
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:10,809
He's been twice already.

107
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:16,805
Can you get Buscopan for my cramps?

108
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:20,132
It costs 18 or 19 euros.

109
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:22,329
Why should I go for you?

110
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:24,886
If I see the others, I won't resist.

111
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:27,241
That's not my problem.

112
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:31,046
You got paid to marry.
You'll get double that to divorce.

113
00:11:31,251 --> 00:11:33,367
- Don't ask me nothing!
- Screw the money!

114
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:36,007
Just help me. Get some Buscopan!

115
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,088
Get it yourself!

116
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:39,883
Help me, Lorna!

117
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:42,082
- Get up.
- Help me...

118
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,121
Get up.

119
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,079
Write the name down for me.

120
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:08,088
Give me that.

121
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:14,682
- What's it called?
- Buscopan.

122
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:22,167
Lock me in.

123
00:12:22,372 --> 00:12:23,282
No.

124
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:28,962
Lorna!

125
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:30,888
My key!

126
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:34,725
It fell in the truck!

127
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:15,210
Good evening. Number 3.

128
00:13:37,813 --> 00:13:38,963
It's me.

129
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,692
I wanted to talk to you.

130
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:48,693
Goodbye. I'll call on Sunday.

131
00:14:19,214 --> 00:14:20,329
Good evening.

132
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,731
I'd like some Buscopan, please.

133
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:24,573
Do you have a prescription?

134
00:14:24,775 --> 00:14:25,763
No.

135
00:14:26,254 --> 00:14:27,209
Are you in pain?

136
00:14:27,414 --> 00:14:29,245
No, it's not me, it's...

137
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:32,735
It's my husband. He's having cramps.

138
00:14:33,694 --> 00:14:36,448
All right,
but usually I need a prescription.

139
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:37,769
Thank you.

140
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:56,724
Lorna!

141
00:15:22,536 --> 00:15:23,604
What's wrong?

142
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:26,726
What?

143
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,044
Water?

144
00:15:58,935 --> 00:15:59,527
Let go.

145
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:00,691
Help me up.

146
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:02,170
Let go of me, Claudy.

147
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:03,566
Let go!

148
00:16:03,817 --> 00:16:05,772
Help me up, the cramps hurt!

149
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:07,295
Take the Buscopan.

150
00:16:07,496 --> 00:16:10,216
I already did but it hurts.
Please...

151
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:23,334
Wait...

152
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:25,853
Here, call my doctor.

153
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:27,933
Why don't you call him?

154
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:30,770
Lorna! Help me! Help me!

155
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:33,851
Help me...

156
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:37,884
Under D. Call Doctor Mayro.

157
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:40,816
- What?
- Under D. Doctor Mayro.

158
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:47,815
Tell him he has to get me
into hospital.

159
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,045
Good evening.

160
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:55,207
This is Claudy Moreau's wife.

161
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:58,093
He says he's coming off drugs...

162
00:16:58,297 --> 00:16:59,526
It's been two days.

163
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:01,694
He wants to go to hospital.

164
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:03,729
Yes, I put him on.

165
00:17:15,858 --> 00:17:16,688
Come on.

166
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:26,817
There, he's registered.

167
00:17:27,018 --> 00:17:28,132
I don't have to pay?

168
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,977
No, but bring his health card
tomorrow.

169
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:32,930
All right. Thank you.

170
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:38,452
Your money.

171
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:41,256
Claudy, your money.

172
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:43,494
Keep it. I don't need it here.

173
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,213
Just leave me 20 for cigarettes.

174
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:50,410
I have to bring your health card.
Where is it?

175
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:52,017
On my shelf with my stuff.

176
00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:55,738
Put it in my pocket. The inside one.

177
00:17:57,738 --> 00:17:59,570
Will someone take care of me?

178
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,531
The receptionist said
a nurse would come.

179
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:03,727
I'm going.

180
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:07,051
Can you bring me
my CD player and discs?

181
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:09,406
Lorna!

182
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:15,693
Don't leave me.

183
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:17,536
The nurse will be here soon.

184
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:19,171
Wait for him with me.

185
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:21,331
Please.

186
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:57,653
Yes, I'm coming down.

187
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:41,419
I'll be at the taxi park.

188
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,610
- Claudy Moreau?
- Room 110.

189
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,016
But visiting hours are from 4 to 7.

190
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:59,371
I'm not visiting.
I've brought his health card.

191
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,411
Admissions is on level zero.

192
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:04,976
All right. Could you give him this?
It's his stuff.

193
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,659
Are you his wife?

194
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,532
- You can take it to him.
- No, it's ok.

195
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,652
Go on, but don't stay long.

196
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:13,852
The last door but one on the left.
Room 110.

197
00:20:33,501 --> 00:20:34,569
Claudy?

198
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:53,616
What should we do?

199
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:56,052
Divorce, like he thinks we will.

200
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:57,172
No.

201
00:21:58,343 --> 00:21:59,411
Why not?

202
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:08,857
We picked a junkie
to avoid a divorce.

203
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:10,814
It would take too long.

204
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:17,140
What if the Russian's ready
to delay the wedding?

205
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:20,296
We agreed on June.
I'll keep my word.

206
00:22:22,422 --> 00:22:24,220
Press the windshield washer.

207
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:27,936
The left-hand lever.

208
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:35,618
Ok!

209
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:45,777
I'll try to find out
if we can get a quicker divorce.

210
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:48,933
Who'll give the junkie his 5,000?

211
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:52,340
Take it out of my 10,000
from the Russian.

212
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:54,056
You fucking the junkie?

213
00:22:54,263 --> 00:22:55,902
Screw him. I'm with Sokol.

214
00:22:56,104 --> 00:22:57,456
Why back down then?

215
00:22:57,664 --> 00:22:59,301
I'm not backing down.

216
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:01,778
But if he ODs now, it'll look weird.

217
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:03,257
I told you it won't.

218
00:23:06,024 --> 00:23:08,901
Nearly all junkies who quit
start using again.

219
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:13,617
The cops look into divorces.
You need to be a widow.

220
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:30,093
Sokol!

221
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:47,294
I was worried you'd left.

222
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:50,463
The van for Germany isn't here yet.

223
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:54,060
I like you without the beard.

224
00:23:54,385 --> 00:23:55,453
Look!

225
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,699
Look!

226
00:24:08,225 --> 00:24:09,862
You're Belgian now.

227
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:16,744
Near Cologne, in the main reactor.

228
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,742
One minute inside: 1,000 euros.

229
00:24:18,945 --> 00:24:20,264
Isn't it dangerous?

230
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:22,136
Only if you do it every month.

231
00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:24,097
Will you come back?

232
00:24:24,304 --> 00:24:26,261
No, we go straight to Italy.

233
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:33,619
Here's 1,200.

234
00:24:34,785 --> 00:24:37,505
- What's on the account?
- Almost 20,000.

235
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:40,017
Let me see your card again.

236
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:48,502
I'm so glad I'm with you.

237
00:24:48,825 --> 00:24:50,463
We must wait for the Russian.

238
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:51,495
Yes.

239
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:53,704
Seen places for the snack bar?

240
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:55,224
I'll go next week.

241
00:24:55,424 --> 00:24:58,462
The banker will give me
a couple of addresses.

242
00:25:00,346 --> 00:25:01,824
Tell me you love me.

243
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:08,384
I love you. What's wrong?

244
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:09,621
Nothing.

245
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:16,302
That's the van. I have to go.

246
00:25:21,985 --> 00:25:24,545
The junkie's in hospital,
trying to quit.

247
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:25,303
Again?

248
00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:26,860
He's serious this time.

249
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,136
Maybe we should get divorced, not...

250
00:25:29,346 --> 00:25:30,744
You talked to Fabio?

251
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:33,017
He won't make the Russian wait

252
00:25:33,226 --> 00:25:35,616
but a divorce is quick
if my husband beats me.

253
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,144
Will they investigate?

254
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:39,256
Yes, but I hear it always works.

255
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:42,105
If it doesn't,
you'll wreck everything.

256
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,701
Let Fabio decide.

257
00:25:44,985 --> 00:25:46,578
I'd rather he didn't die.

258
00:25:46,786 --> 00:25:50,097
It's too late. We agreed.
He's just a junkie.

259
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:51,902
Listen, Lorna.

260
00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:54,984
You can't give in
this close to our goal.

261
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:57,656
If anything's wrong, call me.

262
00:28:06,108 --> 00:28:07,143
Come closer.

263
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,222
Now your other arm.

264
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:24,308
All right, you can get dressed.

265
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:34,749
17, Rue Ferreire,
at the marital home.

266
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:38,260
Circumstances:
Drug with drawal. Heroin.

267
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,939
Wednesday, November 14th, 2007,
at 9 pm.

268
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:44,982
You say he's in hospital now?

269
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:47,748
Yes, since Wednesday, that evening.

270
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:49,138
All right.

271
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:53,420
You should have come then.

272
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:56,788
We'll file the complaint

273
00:28:56,989 --> 00:29:00,824
but I don't think it's enough
for a fast-track divorce.

274
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,984
Why not?

275
00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:06,508
The bruising
could easily be self-inflicted.

276
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,861
It was him. He wanted his fix.

277
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,226
It would help if you had a witness,
but you don't.

278
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,781
Sign here, please.

279
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,901
I need money.

280
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,741
The sooner I can remarry,
the sooner I'll get it.

281
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,142
A real marriage?

282
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,305
No.

283
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,985
Like us.

284
00:29:42,231 --> 00:29:44,983
With a foreigner
who'll pay to be Belgian.

285
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,223
I'm helping you quit!
That wasn't planned.

286
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:53,668
Can't you help me too?

287
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:03,699
You'll do it?

288
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:13,467
I won't go on file as violent.

289
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:16,268
You're a junkie and a thief.

290
00:30:16,471 --> 00:30:17,745
It's not the same.

291
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,262
I've never hit a woman.

292
00:30:25,232 --> 00:30:29,383
The 5,000 euros for the divorce,
that doesn't interest you?

293
00:30:31,191 --> 00:30:32,260
I can wait.

294
00:30:33,111 --> 00:30:36,262
I'm on minimum benefit.
Maybe I'll find a job.

295
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:43,503
If you agree,
I'll help you stay clean,

296
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:45,788
even after we divorce.

297
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,350
Someone's coming.

298
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,380
Go on, hit me. Hit me, Claudy!

299
00:31:03,871 --> 00:31:04,907
Do it!

300
00:31:37,753 --> 00:31:40,903
You should have played your king
before my queen.

301
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:51,150
It's ten past three.

302
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:52,989
One last hand?

303
00:31:53,192 --> 00:31:54,672
We said three o'clock.

304
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:04,622
She's there.

305
00:32:06,072 --> 00:32:07,062
Come on.

306
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:09,228
Get up.

307
00:32:12,313 --> 00:32:13,462
Get up!

308
00:32:14,712 --> 00:32:17,352
You said you'd hit me if I stayed.

309
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:21,703
Do it.

310
00:32:24,073 --> 00:32:25,392
With your fist!

311
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:31,061
I can't.

312
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,790
Are you ok?

313
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,709
Lorna?

314
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:04,543
Ok?

315
00:33:07,474 --> 00:33:10,147
He hit me
and my head struck on the wall.

316
00:33:14,114 --> 00:33:16,389
You should go to the police.

317
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:18,267
I'll do that.

318
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:27,104
Will you be my witness
if the police ask?

319
00:33:27,394 --> 00:33:28,668
Yes, of course.

320
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:33,665
He didn't seem violent.
But you never can tell.

321
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:38,751
What's your name?

322
00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:40,752
Monique Sobel.

323
00:33:46,394 --> 00:33:50,103
Can you put your name and number
on a bit of paper?

324
00:33:50,315 --> 00:33:51,543
Of course.

325
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:11,314
Fabio wants you.
He's on the parking lot.

326
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:47,988
It worked for a girl
at the dry-cleaner's.

327
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:52,114
You scare me, Lorna.

328
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:54,826
Why? I've done nothing against you.

329
00:34:55,036 --> 00:34:58,346
You don't do this.
You don't go to the cops.

330
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:00,786
- What if it worked?
- You don't do it!

331
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:05,112
You're his wife. Look after him.
The rest's up to me.

332
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:10,512
You don't trust me anymore?

333
00:35:14,316 --> 00:35:15,875
I have to. I need you.

334
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:22,304
Ok, you can go.

335
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:41,707
Remember, you need me too.

336
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,906
Don't make me screw up on this deal.

337
00:35:45,396 --> 00:35:47,467
It's my first with the Russians.

338
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:50,475
I don't want that either.
I want my money.

339
00:35:52,557 --> 00:35:54,274
That's the Lorna I know.

340
00:35:58,276 --> 00:36:00,312
Who was the guy at the station?

341
00:36:01,397 --> 00:36:02,590
Sokol.

342
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:04,106
Sokol has a beard.

343
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:06,227
Yes, but he shaved it off.

344
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,034
Lorna!

345
00:36:34,238 --> 00:36:36,229
Someone to see you in the shop!

346
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:51,353
Sorry, I'll only be a minute.

347
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:59,272
I'm out. I wanted to surprise you.

348
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:01,266
You're cured then?

349
00:37:01,478 --> 00:37:02,308
Yes.

350
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:06,956
If ever I feel bad,
I can call a number at the hospital.

351
00:37:07,878 --> 00:37:09,197
You have to resist.

352
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,395
I need the apartment keys.

353
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:15,308
I'll get them.

354
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:16,871
And my money too.

355
00:37:39,878 --> 00:37:40,709
Here.

356
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:43,991
I just want 10 euros for cigarettes.

357
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:47,630
Want lunch to celebrate?

358
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:49,874
I can't, I have too much work.

359
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:55,995
I'll make dinner tonight.
It'll keep me busy. Ok?

360
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:56,836
If you want.

361
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,633
I'll need more money then,
to buy food.

362
00:38:02,878 --> 00:38:04,198
When'll you be back?

363
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:06,276
I don't know. Around seven.

364
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:08,834
See you later.

365
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,396
Who is it?

366
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:03,869
It's nearly ready.

367
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,991
Cheese and ham macaroni.

368
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,153
There was a letter for you.
It's on your bed.

369
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,994
It's from the judge.
I'm getting the divorce.

370
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:42,759
I'll be back in an hour.

371
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,159
Dinner's nearly ready.

372
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:48,240
I'll be back in an hour.
Can't you wait?

373
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:50,437
We're celebrating me getting out.

374
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,676
We'll do it in an hour, ok?

375
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,993
Roberto, have you seen Fabio?

376
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:18,037
Fabio's waiting on the square.

377
00:40:31,801 --> 00:40:34,076
I didn't do anything else, I swear.

378
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,593
It's that complaint I filed.

379
00:40:39,921 --> 00:40:42,071
The Russian won't wait any longer.

380
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,201
Ask him. It's only another month.

381
00:40:47,841 --> 00:40:51,039
A wedding two weeks
after the divorce? That stinks.

382
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:52,311
Why?

383
00:40:53,522 --> 00:40:54,841
My husband beats me.

384
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:58,273
Can't I meet someone
before the divorce is final?

385
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:00,236
Ok, I'll take it.

386
00:41:02,442 --> 00:41:05,114
You'll pay the junkie's 5,000
when you divorce?

387
00:41:05,522 --> 00:41:07,717
Yes, out of the Russian's 10,000.

388
00:41:10,402 --> 00:41:12,995
Ok. I'll see if he can wait a month.

389
00:41:13,561 --> 00:41:14,995
You'll call me after?

390
00:41:45,443 --> 00:41:47,751
I spoke to the Russian. He agrees.

391
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:02,112
Take your shit away!

392
00:42:02,323 --> 00:42:03,551
- My money!
- He goes first!

393
00:42:03,763 --> 00:42:04,639
Just get out!

394
00:42:04,843 --> 00:42:05,593
I want my money!

395
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:07,236
I need to talk to you.

396
00:42:09,163 --> 00:42:10,392
Wait downstairs.

397
00:42:10,803 --> 00:42:12,759
- Ten minutes, no more.
- I'll be there.

398
00:42:16,484 --> 00:42:17,233
Give it to me!

399
00:42:17,443 --> 00:42:19,035
- You're using again?
- My money!

400
00:42:19,243 --> 00:42:20,915
Let's call the hospital...

401
00:42:21,123 --> 00:42:22,443
Give me my money!

402
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:24,794
Wait. Calm down.

403
00:42:27,164 --> 00:42:28,881
I don't want you
to get hooked again.

404
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,881
You got your divorce. Hand it over!

405
00:42:31,084 --> 00:42:32,483
I'll give it to you.

406
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:37,558
It's at the shop.

407
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,482
You're lying! Hand it over!

408
00:42:41,044 --> 00:42:43,274
Give me the envelope!

409
00:42:50,924 --> 00:42:52,151
Give me the key!

410
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:54,633
Give it to me!

411
00:45:27,247 --> 00:45:28,201
Do the bikes work?

412
00:45:28,406 --> 00:45:29,157
Which one?

413
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:30,720
- The blue one.
- Yeah.

414
00:45:31,686 --> 00:45:32,881
50 euros.

415
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:42,076
I'll take the bike.

416
00:45:56,487 --> 00:46:00,321
60 euros to open your door,
10 for two keys, that makes 70.

417
00:46:00,687 --> 00:46:01,437
Half and half?

418
00:46:01,648 --> 00:46:03,238
No, the door's my fault.

419
00:46:03,446 --> 00:46:04,766
It's my fault too.

420
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:06,796
All right.

421
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:08,517
35 each.

422
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:22,921
I'll ride all day.

423
00:46:23,168 --> 00:46:25,363
It'll give me something to do.

424
00:46:27,408 --> 00:46:28,966
Can I come by at midday?

425
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,518
I'll be alone at the shop.

426
00:46:31,728 --> 00:46:33,366
Not to have lunch.

427
00:46:33,848 --> 00:46:36,645
It gives me a goal
in the middle of the day.

428
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:38,645
I'll stop by and leave again.

429
00:46:39,648 --> 00:46:40,602
All right.

430
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:43,718
I need to see you. It helps me.

431
00:46:44,687 --> 00:46:45,677
I'm going now.

432
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:49,803
Here, I'd rather you keep it.

433
00:46:50,888 --> 00:46:52,401
See you later.

434
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:06,919
The family was here.
They'll handle the funeral costs.

435
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:09,407
I said I would.

436
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,487
I told them but they refused.

437
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:29,723
Can I see him one last time?

438
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,125
You already identified him.
I can't...

439
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,208
The duty officer has left.

440
00:49:34,411 --> 00:49:35,730
I'm his wife.

441
00:49:37,011 --> 00:49:38,080
All right.

442
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:36,923
Sure you won't stay here?

443
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:40,927
It looks like you're running away.

444
00:50:49,933 --> 00:50:51,331
Did you hear me?

445
00:50:51,853 --> 00:50:53,489
The police may get suspicious.

446
00:50:53,691 --> 00:50:55,808
They have my phone number.

447
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:58,008
Give that back.

448
00:50:59,252 --> 00:51:00,049
What?

449
00:51:00,613 --> 00:51:01,760
The player.

450
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,684
He won't need it now.

451
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,367
Give it to her.

452
00:51:15,293 --> 00:51:17,681
You could stay another week.

453
00:51:17,892 --> 00:51:19,291
It would look more normal.

454
00:51:19,492 --> 00:51:20,322
No.

455
00:51:22,893 --> 00:51:24,042
Where will you go?

456
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:27,721
Where I was before.

457
00:51:28,772 --> 00:51:30,286
You sublet that place.

458
00:51:33,414 --> 00:51:35,529
I worked it out with the girl.

459
00:51:41,454 --> 00:51:43,170
Not taking his razor and stuff?

460
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:44,443
No.

461
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:49,569
Spirou! Get the junkie's stuff
from the bathroom.

462
00:51:51,813 --> 00:51:53,610
Going to sulk much longer?

463
00:51:56,134 --> 00:51:57,282
You'd have told the junkie

464
00:51:57,493 --> 00:52:00,166
if you knew
the Russian wouldn't wait.

465
00:52:00,413 --> 00:52:01,926
I helped you keep going.

466
00:52:02,254 --> 00:52:04,245
Thank me instead of sulking.

467
00:52:09,973 --> 00:52:10,770
Here...

468
00:52:12,774 --> 00:52:15,004
For the extra work, another 1,000.

469
00:52:15,893 --> 00:52:17,009
What extra work?

470
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:20,490
Taking care of him when he tried
to quit was work, right?

471
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:28,003
Refusing means you're not with us.

472
00:52:30,694 --> 00:52:32,206
Are you still with us?

473
00:52:33,133 --> 00:52:33,964
Yes.

474
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:35,892
You always have been, ok.

475
00:52:36,814 --> 00:52:39,966
Because you kept quiet,
we were able to make him OD.

476
00:52:40,693 --> 00:52:41,683
Ok?

477
00:52:41,894 --> 00:52:42,690
Yes.

478
00:52:47,534 --> 00:52:49,923
The 1,000 is yours when you want it.

479
00:52:51,174 --> 00:52:52,323
Take the photo.

480
00:52:55,734 --> 00:52:56,565
Spirou...

481
00:52:57,454 --> 00:52:58,409
Take a bag.

482
00:53:01,494 --> 00:53:03,530
Good evening, is Mrs Moreau in?

483
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:08,209
Good evening.

484
00:53:10,134 --> 00:53:13,013
Mrs Moreau,
we have a few more questions,

485
00:53:13,215 --> 00:53:14,773
following the autopsy.

486
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:16,963
I'll take your bag.

487
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:20,612
- We'll wait in the car.
- Ok.

488
00:53:22,654 --> 00:53:23,610
Come in.

489
00:53:30,334 --> 00:53:33,327
The autopsy
confirms it was an overdose.

490
00:53:35,015 --> 00:53:37,974
Do you know
if anyone wanted him dead?

491
00:53:39,655 --> 00:53:40,451
No.

492
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:44,814
Someone who'd gain from killing him
with an overdose?

493
00:53:46,176 --> 00:53:47,004
No.

494
00:53:47,214 --> 00:53:49,934
He'd just come off drugs.
Was he depressed?

495
00:53:51,015 --> 00:53:51,891
No.

496
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:54,008
Did he mention suicide?

497
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:56,651
No.

498
00:53:56,855 --> 00:53:59,813
You filed for divorce
because he beat you...

499
00:54:00,576 --> 00:54:01,213
Yes.

500
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:03,531
He knew you were going to get it?

501
00:54:04,815 --> 00:54:05,372
Yes.

502
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,725
Since when?

503
00:54:08,896 --> 00:54:10,966
Since I got the judge's letter.

504
00:54:12,175 --> 00:54:13,403
Four days ago.

505
00:54:13,655 --> 00:54:15,374
What day did the dealer say?

506
00:54:16,255 --> 00:54:17,814
Friday. Four days ago.

507
00:54:18,016 --> 00:54:21,645
That evening, your husband
called a dealer to buy heroin.

508
00:54:22,255 --> 00:54:24,645
Maybe after hearing
about the divorce?

509
00:54:26,576 --> 00:54:29,488
The dealer says
you stopped him from buying it.

510
00:54:38,456 --> 00:54:39,251
Yes.

511
00:54:41,777 --> 00:54:44,689
Alone and depressed,
could he have taken a fix

512
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:49,408
and deliberately
or accidentally overdosed?

513
00:54:55,896 --> 00:54:57,170
Possibly.

514
00:55:01,616 --> 00:55:02,526
All right.

515
00:55:02,976 --> 00:55:04,170
We'll be going now.

516
00:55:07,777 --> 00:55:08,812
Goodbye.

517
00:55:09,816 --> 00:55:10,966
Goodbye, Mrs Moreau.

518
00:55:40,177 --> 00:55:40,734
Excuse me.

519
00:55:41,617 --> 00:55:43,095
Are you Claudy's mother?

520
00:55:43,296 --> 00:55:45,686
No, the lady in that car there.

521
00:55:51,657 --> 00:55:54,171
I'm Lorna, Claudy's wife.

522
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:58,494
I wanted you to have this.

523
00:56:00,097 --> 00:56:02,008
It's the money he had left.

524
00:56:02,938 --> 00:56:04,416
Did he talk about me?

525
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:05,974
No.

526
00:56:07,378 --> 00:56:10,050
My son. His brother.

527
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:12,010
This is Claudy's wife.

528
00:56:13,698 --> 00:56:14,813
What's that?

529
00:56:15,018 --> 00:56:17,691
Claudy's money. What he had left.

530
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:20,374
You're his wife. It's yours.

531
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,493
For the little girl.

532
00:56:22,698 --> 00:56:25,006
We don't need your money, or his.

533
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:27,287
Take it.

534
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:29,016
No...
Just like that. That feels good.

535
00:58:33,821 --> 00:58:37,255
You call me, I come.
1,000 kilometres.

536
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,213
I leave again tonight.

537
00:59:11,661 --> 00:59:12,775
What shall we do?

538
00:59:14,621 --> 00:59:15,690
Lorna...

539
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:17,931
Are you asleep?

540
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:19,331
No.

541
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,452
You shouldn't worry about it.

542
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:44,250
Ajunkie prefers drugs to life.

543
00:59:46,502 --> 00:59:48,970
He'd have started using again

544
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:50,975
and died one day.

545
01:00:01,381 --> 01:00:05,295
Shall we take a look at the places
for the snack bar?

546
01:00:09,302 --> 01:00:10,177
All right.

547
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:22,258
It's here. Number 36.

548
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:34,700
It's tiny.

549
01:00:36,582 --> 01:00:37,776
Yes.

550
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:41,535
There won't be any room for tables.

551
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:03,935
Come on, take a look.

552
01:01:11,743 --> 01:01:12,812
Can you see?

553
01:01:13,424 --> 01:01:15,174
There are three rooms.

554
01:01:16,063 --> 01:01:17,290
And a garden.

555
01:01:17,503 --> 01:01:18,572
Is it big?

556
01:01:19,223 --> 01:01:21,692
Yes, we can serve outdoors
in summer.

557
01:01:38,384 --> 01:01:39,657
I like it here.

558
01:01:41,903 --> 01:01:43,814
You have to go tonight?

559
01:01:44,143 --> 01:01:47,420
Yes, the truck leaves at six.

560
01:01:55,024 --> 01:01:56,012
Want to dance?

561
01:03:34,826 --> 01:03:36,861
Lorna, meet Andrei Aslikov.

562
01:03:38,346 --> 01:03:39,619
Kostia, the interpreter.

563
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:42,014
Sit down.

564
01:03:47,306 --> 01:03:48,499
Want a drink?

565
01:03:48,706 --> 01:03:49,536
A beer.

566
01:03:49,746 --> 01:03:51,225
You want another?

567
01:03:54,545 --> 01:03:56,422
Nothing for him. Me neither.

568
01:04:00,825 --> 01:04:02,178
Roberto, a beer!

569
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,735
He wants to see her Belgian ID card.

570
01:04:33,666 --> 01:04:35,258
- You have the paper?
- Yes.

571
01:04:47,427 --> 01:04:50,702
This certifies she's a widow
and free to marry.

572
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:11,306
They paid a deposit.

573
01:05:12,307 --> 01:05:14,457
Take your share. Three wads.

574
01:05:18,747 --> 01:05:19,942
20-euro notes.

575
01:05:21,587 --> 01:05:24,499
What they sell a carton
of cigarettes for in Moscow.

576
01:05:38,788 --> 01:05:40,664
Want the 1,000 you turned down?

577
01:05:50,908 --> 01:05:52,943
I said I'd keep it for you.

578
01:06:33,028 --> 01:06:33,904
See you.

579
01:07:13,748 --> 01:07:14,625
What?

580
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:17,297
Yes, I signed this morning.

581
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:22,545
I'm so happy, Sokol!
It's our snack bar.

582
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:25,705
Wait, let me measure it.

583
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:34,341
Four metres, more or less.

584
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,985
That's the room for the counter.

585
01:07:38,349 --> 01:07:42,467
The second...
Same width. The length...

586
01:07:42,749 --> 01:07:44,580
Just a second...

587
01:07:48,869 --> 01:07:50,542
Almost five metres long.

588
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:53,184
We could have five or six tables.

589
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:55,308
And the third room...

590
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:58,106
We can have more tables.

591
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,028
And there's a door...

592
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,741
We can make a small kitchen.

593
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:07,869
I'm going out into the garden.

594
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,150
It's beautiful.

595
01:08:17,709 --> 01:08:19,223
It even has trees.

596
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:22,180
Ideal for serving outdoors
in summer.

597
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:33,548
I'm on the first floor.

598
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:40,625
Opposite the stairs,
there's a bathroom with a tub.

599
01:08:41,431 --> 01:08:42,783
Pretty big.

600
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,789
Another room...

601
01:08:45,511 --> 01:08:47,467
It can be our living room.

602
01:08:48,431 --> 01:08:51,468
And another room
where we can have a kitchen.

603
01:08:51,751 --> 01:08:53,469
The second floor now.

604
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,946
There have to be bedrooms.

605
01:09:04,871 --> 01:09:05,987
Hold on...

606
01:09:25,231 --> 01:09:26,506
Yes, I'm fine.

607
01:09:27,671 --> 01:09:30,231
I was so excited...

608
01:09:31,152 --> 01:09:33,426
I haven't eaten all day.

609
01:09:33,911 --> 01:09:38,269
I got a phone card
and came straight here.

610
01:10:03,713 --> 01:10:05,030
Yes, I'm fine.

611
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:11,628
It must be low blood pressure.

612
01:10:12,553 --> 01:10:13,825
I'll call you later.

613
01:10:32,032 --> 01:10:33,068
Mrs Deda?

614
01:10:33,992 --> 01:10:35,267
Come with me.

615
01:10:43,153 --> 01:10:46,349
Undress, put the smock on
and I'll call you.

616
01:10:48,072 --> 01:10:48,982
No.

617
01:10:49,633 --> 01:10:51,430
Any surgical operations?

618
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:52,509
No.

619
01:10:53,033 --> 01:10:54,307
Any chronic illness?

620
01:10:54,512 --> 01:10:55,342
No.

621
01:10:56,193 --> 01:10:57,911
Are you on any medication?

622
01:10:58,113 --> 01:10:58,989
No.

623
01:10:59,233 --> 01:11:00,791
Your last period?

624
01:11:01,393 --> 01:11:03,223
A month and three weeks ago.

625
01:11:04,633 --> 01:11:07,386
Are you here for a specific reason?

626
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:10,233
I want an abortion.

627
01:11:10,993 --> 01:11:14,110
A termination of pregnancy.
All right...

628
01:11:14,393 --> 01:11:17,271
We'll do a scan
to date the pregnancy,

629
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:19,589
then set a date for the operation.

630
01:11:19,793 --> 01:11:23,627
There's a legal wait of 8 days
for you to think it over.

631
01:11:25,913 --> 01:11:27,108
Come and lie down.

632
01:11:40,553 --> 01:11:41,703
Lie down.

633
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,909
What is it? Is something wrong?

634
01:11:55,834 --> 01:11:57,552
You don't want the scan?

635
01:12:03,473 --> 01:12:05,271
I'm not aborting.

636
01:12:46,635 --> 01:12:47,670
In your name?

637
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:50,070
In the name of the baby I'm having.

638
01:12:50,275 --> 01:12:53,505
Only people who really exist
can have accounts.

639
01:12:53,715 --> 01:12:56,275
He'll be born in about eight months.

640
01:12:56,475 --> 01:12:58,148
But he hasn't been born yet.

641
01:12:58,356 --> 01:13:01,471
What I can do is reserve
an account number for him.

642
01:13:01,674 --> 01:13:04,065
I'd like to put money on it now.

643
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:05,704
Put it on your account

644
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:08,349
and we'll transfer it
after he's born.

645
01:13:09,075 --> 01:13:09,985
All right.

646
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:14,989
First I'll reserve
the account number.

647
01:13:17,275 --> 01:13:19,835
First name, not yet. Surname?

648
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:21,425
Moreau.

649
01:13:21,875 --> 01:13:24,514
M-O-R-E-A-U.

650
01:13:48,795 --> 01:13:50,627
We're meeting the Russian!

651
01:13:50,955 --> 01:13:52,150
I fell asleep.

652
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:54,507
I called and tried the buzzer.

653
01:13:54,836 --> 01:13:56,633
I'm lucky someone came out.

654
01:14:02,956 --> 01:14:04,390
It's Fabio.

655
01:14:05,235 --> 01:14:07,352
Tell Andrei we're on our way.

656
01:14:07,956 --> 01:14:09,992
I know, trouble with my taxi.

657
01:14:11,556 --> 01:14:12,672
I'm sorry.

658
01:14:14,996 --> 01:14:16,907
Move it. They're waiting.

659
01:14:25,357 --> 01:14:26,790
You're going like that?

660
01:14:41,116 --> 01:14:42,709
I'm expecting a baby.

661
01:14:48,477 --> 01:14:49,545
What?

662
01:14:51,037 --> 01:14:52,186
Are you sure?

663
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:57,111
You saw a doctor?

664
01:14:59,797 --> 01:15:00,991
And the Russian?

665
01:15:01,677 --> 01:15:05,431
Couldn't you have been careful?
Sokol's dumb! You too, damn it!

666
01:15:08,958 --> 01:15:11,108
We'll get you an abortion next week.

667
01:15:11,837 --> 01:15:13,065
Hurry it up.

668
01:15:13,317 --> 01:15:15,467
- What if I want to keep it?
- No way!

669
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,986
The Russian
doesn't want you pregnant.

670
01:15:18,197 --> 01:15:20,074
He won't have to recognize it.

671
01:15:20,277 --> 01:15:22,712
I don't care. It wasn't planned.

672
01:15:24,637 --> 01:15:25,434
Come on.

673
01:15:31,678 --> 01:15:34,272
Meet Micky, one of your witnesses.

674
01:15:37,998 --> 01:15:39,225
Have a drink on me.

675
01:15:42,758 --> 01:15:45,591
He delivers papers.
I've worked for him, Lorna too.

676
01:15:45,798 --> 01:15:47,230
Totally trust worthy.

677
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:51,838
The police
may try questioning witnesses.

678
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:01,552
Cheers.

679
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:10,626
People should see you
dance together.

680
01:16:11,518 --> 01:16:13,748
Andrei should dance with her.

681
01:16:16,078 --> 01:16:19,115
If they say they met here,
they'll have witnesses.

682
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:38,195
You ok if I have child?

683
01:16:38,519 --> 01:16:39,838
Me, baby?

684
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:41,115
Baby Andrei?

685
01:16:41,319 --> 01:16:43,468
No, me baby, not with you.

686
01:16:43,879 --> 01:16:45,790
Marriage yes, baby no.

687
01:16:45,999 --> 01:16:49,036
You just marriage, me baby.

688
01:16:51,638 --> 01:16:54,597
No, we'll talk some other time.
Forget it.

689
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,236
No problem, it's nothing.

690
01:17:02,999 --> 01:17:05,069
No child with you, just marriage.

691
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:08,076
It's not that.
I asked if I was pregnant,

692
01:17:08,278 --> 01:17:11,271
would he marry me anyway?
I was just asking.

693
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:23,998
No. He won't pay the child's upkeep.
He wants it to go as planned.

694
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:25,189
What's up?

695
01:17:25,399 --> 01:17:26,275
Nothing.

696
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:30,268
She asked if Andrei would marry her
if she was pregnant.

697
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,233
Why ask him that?

698
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:35,158
No reason. I have my life.
It can happen.

699
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:37,270
If it does, you'll abort.

700
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,356
No problem, there's no child.

701
01:17:42,879 --> 01:17:45,633
If he wants,
a doctor can examine her.

702
01:17:51,839 --> 01:17:54,479
He agrees. A doctor friend of his.

703
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,313
We'll let you dance now.

704
01:18:50,761 --> 01:18:52,638
I told you not to mention it.

705
01:18:53,281 --> 01:18:55,714
I wanted to know what he thought.

706
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:01,834
Never do that again! Ever!
Understand?

707
01:19:02,241 --> 01:19:04,231
You do as I say and that's it!

708
01:19:10,962 --> 01:19:13,077
I'll take you to abort tomorrow.

709
01:19:28,162 --> 01:19:29,390
What's wrong?

710
01:19:53,242 --> 01:19:55,517
The doctor
who examined her is coming.

711
01:19:59,642 --> 01:20:01,519
You asked about an abortion?

712
01:20:04,962 --> 01:20:06,794
You asked about an abortion?

713
01:20:07,043 --> 01:20:07,952
No.

714
01:20:08,522 --> 01:20:09,512
Why not?

715
01:20:14,402 --> 01:20:15,836
Got Sokol's number?

716
01:20:17,683 --> 01:20:19,752
On my phone, in my bag...

717
01:20:34,722 --> 01:20:36,952
Sokol's not the father. Claudy is.

718
01:20:38,763 --> 01:20:39,878
The junkie?

719
01:20:40,763 --> 01:20:42,878
- You fucked the junkie?
- His name's Claudy.

720
01:20:43,082 --> 01:20:44,118
Shut up!

721
01:20:48,364 --> 01:20:49,762
Are you her husband?

722
01:20:49,963 --> 01:20:51,998
A friend. I drove her here.

723
01:20:53,243 --> 01:20:55,040
Is the sedative helping?

724
01:20:56,604 --> 01:20:59,675
As I showed you on the scan,
you're not pregnant.

725
01:21:00,883 --> 01:21:03,317
You're too upset to accept it.

726
01:21:04,203 --> 01:21:07,673
It's best to stay a few days
so we can run tests.

727
01:21:07,883 --> 01:21:09,077
Do you agree?

728
01:21:09,883 --> 01:21:10,599
Yes.

729
01:21:10,804 --> 01:21:11,792
Good.

730
01:21:12,363 --> 01:21:14,752
Someone will take you to your room.

731
01:21:14,964 --> 01:21:16,442
Can it be a single room?

732
01:21:16,643 --> 01:21:17,917
Yes, I think so.

733
01:21:21,284 --> 01:21:23,320
Why did you say you were pregnant?

734
01:21:23,644 --> 01:21:24,473
I am.

735
01:21:24,683 --> 01:21:27,960
The doctor says you aren't.
She should know.

736
01:21:28,844 --> 01:21:29,674
No.

737
01:21:36,804 --> 01:21:38,123
Mrs Sobel?

738
01:21:38,764 --> 01:21:39,880
Good evening.

739
01:21:40,085 --> 01:21:42,154
- Do you remember me?
- Yes.

740
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:44,878
- And Claudy too?
- Your husband? Of course.

741
01:21:45,164 --> 01:21:46,234
I have to go.

742
01:21:46,444 --> 01:21:48,163
- You'll come to see me?
- Yes.

743
01:21:58,203 --> 01:22:00,434
I'll check which room you're in.

744
01:22:00,645 --> 01:22:02,236
Can I stay the night?

745
01:22:02,444 --> 01:22:04,913
If you want.
There's a foldaway bed.

746
01:22:14,724 --> 01:22:17,603
- I'm not going back to Albania.
- It's for the best.

747
01:22:20,685 --> 01:22:22,959
- Ask him to let me stay.
- He won't agree.

748
01:22:23,845 --> 01:22:26,723
He doesn't trust you.
You talk too much.

749
01:22:27,845 --> 01:22:29,598
You'd have told that nurse.

750
01:22:29,806 --> 01:22:31,716
- She knew Claudy. I...
- Shut up!

751
01:22:43,245 --> 01:22:45,918
If you loved me, you'd know
why I want the child.

752
01:22:46,126 --> 01:22:48,719
There is no child.
Stop this craziness.

753
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:51,473
- I didn't want to cheat on you...
- Stop it.

754
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:05,524
Fill it out here and here.

755
01:23:05,725 --> 01:23:08,797
But don't sign it
until you meet the banker.

756
01:23:09,286 --> 01:23:12,914
She cancelled the loan, so the bank
takes part of the deposit.

757
01:23:13,126 --> 01:23:14,319
This sum here.

758
01:23:14,565 --> 01:23:15,521
Bastards.

759
01:23:15,726 --> 01:23:17,842
Call me once the doctor's been.

760
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:19,161
All right.

761
01:23:21,245 --> 01:23:22,963
7,000 euros wasted. Bravo.

762
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:24,360
You're like him.

763
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:27,360
You just want
to get your money back.

764
01:23:27,567 --> 01:23:29,442
You lost him money
with the Russians.

765
01:23:29,646 --> 01:23:31,158
He wants it back. It's normal.

766
01:23:31,365 --> 01:23:32,594
I'm talking about you.

767
01:23:33,766 --> 01:23:37,314
You'll take what you put in
and I'll never see you again.

768
01:23:39,086 --> 01:23:40,485
I'll come to Gramsh.

769
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,206
No, you won't.

770
01:23:47,046 --> 01:23:50,403
Your copy confirming
the cancellation of the loan...

771
01:23:51,286 --> 01:23:52,800
The receipt to sign...

772
01:24:05,926 --> 01:24:07,155
And your money.

773
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:14,282
Goodbye.

774
01:24:35,046 --> 01:24:38,562
I'm taking back
that extra 1,000 I gave you too.

775
01:24:50,608 --> 01:24:52,643
I paid in 5,600?

776
01:24:55,967 --> 01:24:58,117
5,600 was what I paid in?

777
01:24:58,647 --> 01:25:00,239
You know better than I do.

778
01:25:45,328 --> 01:25:47,398
The first truck.

779
01:25:52,769 --> 01:25:54,486
I'll be in Milan a month.

780
01:25:55,249 --> 01:25:57,604
Then I'll come to see you in Gramsh.

781
01:26:02,929 --> 01:26:03,839
What?

782
01:26:06,488 --> 01:26:07,523
See you soon.

783
01:26:58,409 --> 01:26:59,638
Give me your phone.

784
01:26:59,849 --> 01:27:00,406
Why?

785
01:27:00,609 --> 01:27:01,963
Your SIM card.

786
01:27:02,649 --> 01:27:04,082
What if I need to call?

787
01:27:04,289 --> 01:27:05,722
Ask Spirou.

788
01:27:59,651 --> 01:28:01,323
Not taking the motorway?

789
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:03,928
I need to get petrol.

790
01:28:23,691 --> 01:28:25,010
There's a place.

791
01:28:25,211 --> 01:28:27,280
I'll pee while you get petrol.

792
01:28:27,490 --> 01:28:29,845
Not this one.
I know a cheaper place.

793
01:28:46,772 --> 01:28:48,922
I need to pee. Stop.

794
01:28:50,251 --> 01:28:51,889
Can't you wait?

795
01:28:52,091 --> 01:28:52,921
No.

796
01:29:06,372 --> 01:29:08,362
You don't need your bag to piss.

797
01:29:47,613 --> 01:29:49,444
They want to kill us.

798
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:54,082
Don't be scared. I'll protect you.

799
01:31:23,653 --> 01:31:25,531
We'll keep running.

800
01:31:26,014 --> 01:31:27,413
It's safer.

801
01:33:35,736 --> 01:33:37,772
We can make ourselves a fire.

802
01:34:09,456 --> 01:34:11,652
I'll get us firewood.

803
01:34:43,538 --> 01:34:44,686
You hear that?

804
01:35:08,898 --> 01:35:11,128
I won't let you die.

805
01:35:12,419 --> 01:35:13,486
Ever.

806
01:35:15,897 --> 01:35:18,571
I let your father die.

807
01:35:20,819 --> 01:35:22,649
You'll live.

808
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,090
We'll sleep now.

809
01:36:21,899 --> 01:36:24,254
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

810
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:30,448
We'll find something
to drink and eat.

811
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:35,660
We'll go and ask at a house.

812
01:36:37,979 --> 01:36:39,459
Don't worry.

813
01:36:40,819 --> 01:36:43,698
Someone's bound
to give us something.

814
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:14,619
Sleep tight.
