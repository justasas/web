1
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,357
- 340.
- Yes.

2
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,204
Can I see
the director?

3
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:41,019
You can see him tomorrow.
Do you want to make an appointment?

4
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,416
- Yes, at 12:30, if possible.
- The reason?

5
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,562
A loan,
we have already spoken.

6
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:51,191
I am about to obtain Belgian nationality,
Now, I can do so.

7
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,157
14,000

8
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,591
In a month,
if all goes as planned.

9
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,357
When will I see you?

10
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,957
I am hanging up now.

11
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,157
I love you.

12
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,752
Me too. Bye.

13
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,168
50 Euros, please.

14
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,152
What do you want?

15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,987
I know... and it is the
third time you called.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,080
- Thanks.
- Thank You.

17
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,391
- How much do I owe you?
- 10 Euros.

18
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,158
I am going to sleep.

19
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,557
- Do not you fancy a game of cards?
- No.

20
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,957
Close the curtains.

21
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,752
Are you coming?

22
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,776
No... I said no!

23
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,968
Have you heard? I said no.

24
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,981
Yes, I heard. Goodnight.

25
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,358
Are we going to play then?

26
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,758
Lower the music!

27
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,558
The music, a little lower!

28
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,595
- What do you want?
- I have to talk to you. Open.

29
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,763
Tomorrow I have
to get up at six.

30
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:47,639
Tonight I will not go out.
It is over.

31
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,396
No, this time is serious,
but you have to help me.

32
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,816
- Promise me that you will.
- Let me sleep, Claudy!

33
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,591
I must know
so I set a target.

34
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,630
- I do not know when I will return.
- Tell me a time, any time.

35
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,016
Five?... Six?...
At nine?...

36
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,787
What time then?
At seven? Ok?

37
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,601
- Whatever.
- If you are late, call me.

38
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,186
Do not forget
to return the mattress.

39
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,186
- What are you doing?
- Lock me inside.

40
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,186
- And if you want to leave?
- I have to resist!

41
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,758
No, I will not do it.

42
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,396
You will want to go out
and I will have to come back.

43
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,768
No, I swear no! Lorna!

44
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,795
If I am late, tell her
that I will stay here tonight.

45
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,558
I will tell her.

46
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,596
He told them
I would return during my break.

47
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,201
- Only at nights.
- I said so. But did not understand.

48
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,563
It is bad. He is stopping.

49
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,015
Terminal 4.
Can you do the pick up, Fabio?

50
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,157
I will.

51
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:54,195
He says he wants to quit this time.
He has asked me to help him.

52
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,567
Tomorrow he will be the same

53
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,382
If he quits though,
what shall we do?

54
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,181
As we said, we overdose him.

55
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,195
- And will the police believe it?
- Of course.

56
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,201
It will not be the first time that someone
lies dying from overdoses.

57
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,834
The cops! Six months, nothing!
But now you are becoming a Belgian!

58
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,392
- Will you wait?
- No, I have to go to the airport.

59
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,368
Show them the photo
of the wedding.

60
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,358
Where are the police?

61
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,816
- I do not feel well, I wanted to see you.
- Get out of my bed.

62
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,777
- I thought I could.
- Get out! Go!

63
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,382
- Look what you have done! Shit!
- Sorry.

64
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,557
Bring a towel.

65
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,758
It was not the police

66
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,157
He wanted me to come back.

67
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,991
- Do not do that again.
- I was not feeling well.

68
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,958
I do not care!

69
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,177
I arrived late,
it gives me no time to eat.

70
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,358
- Do you want me to prepare a sandwich?
- No.

71
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,572
- Who is it?
- You need something?

72
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,153
Go away!

73
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,557
This is the second time
this morning.

74
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:19,376
Will you go to buy Buscopan?
I have cramps.

75
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,620
- Here, it costs 18 or 19 Euros.
- Why do I need to do something for you?

76
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,830
- If I see the others, I will be in trouble!
- And? It is not my business.

77
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,235
You got married for money,
you will get twice to divorce!

78
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,795
I do not mind the money! Help me!
Buy the Buscopan!

79
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,557
You go!

80
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,967
- Help me, Lorna!
- Get up!

81
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,948
Get up!

82
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,777
Write the name of medicine
on a piece of paper.

83
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,948
Give it.

84
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,372
- What is the name?
- Buscopan.

85
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,557
Loc me inside.

86
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,358
My key!

87
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,557
It fell into the truck!

88
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,157
Go to the cabin 3, please.

89
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,157
It is me.

90
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,358
I wanted to talk to you.

91
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,792
Bye...
I will call you on Sunday...

92
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,400
Good evening...
A Buscopan, please.

93
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,157
Do you have a prescription?

94
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:31,376
- Is it really bad?
- It is not for me...

95
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,177
For my husband...
He has cramps...

96
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,795
Ok I will give you,
but usually you need a prescription.

97
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,758
What?

98
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,157
What do you want? Water?

99
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,567
- Let me.
- Help me get up.

100
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,358
Let me, Claudy!

101
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,801
- Help me, I have cramps, I am hurting!
- Take the Buscopan!

102
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,577
I have taken it,
but I am still hurting.

103
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,753
Wait...

104
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,596
- Call my doctor.
- Why do not you call him?

105
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:33,171
Lorna, help me! Help me!

106
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,577
In D, Dr. Mayr.

107
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,795
Tell him I want to go
to the hospital.

108
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,615
Good evening...
I am the wife of Claudy Moreau

109
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,771
He quit drugs...

110
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,758
He is in pain
for two days now...

111
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:06,195
He wants to go to the hospital...
Yes, I am giving him to you...

112
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,582
- Already registered.
- Does it cost anything?

113
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,986
No, but tomorrow will bring
healthcare card.

114
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,353
Your money.

115
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,800
- Claudy, your money!
- I do not need them here.

116
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,768
Let me just 20 Euros
to snuff.

117
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:54,829
Tomorrow I have to bring your health card,
where is it?

118
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,972
Put it into my pocket.

119
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:05,229
- Is there someone to look after me?
- The admissions officer said that they will

120
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,986
Tomorrow, will you bring
the CD player and CDs?

121
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,191
- Do not leave me alone.
- A nurse is coming now.

122
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:24,205
Stay until he comes.
Please.

123
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,153
Yes, I am coming down.

124
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,563
I will be
in the taxi parking.

125
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,835
- Claudy Moreau?
- Room 110.

126
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,040
- I brought his health card.
- Go to admissions, ground floor.

127
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,805
Can you give him these things?
Are you his wife?

128
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,611
- Yes!
- Go, but do not stay too much.

129
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,792
The last door on the left.
Room 110.

130
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,805
- What shall we do?
- Ask for divorce, as he believes.

131
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,347
Why not?

132
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,624
We have chosen a junkie to prevent divorce.
And it would take too long.

133
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,377
What if the Russian
is in agreement?

134
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,591
I have set for June.
I gave my word.

135
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,576
Put on the window wipers.

136
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,957
The button on the left.

137
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,406
I will find a faster way
to obtain a divorce.

138
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,571
And who pays 5,000 Euros
to a junkie?

139
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,992
Take 5,000 from the 10,000
Euros of the Russian.

140
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:58,595
- Are you engaged with him or what?
- Fuck it. I am with Sokol.

141
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,996
- And why are you backing off?
- I am not backing off.

142
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,395
To die from overdose
will look strange.

143
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,792
Almost everyone leaves
and then come back again.

144
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:16,595
Divorce has many risks,
it is best to become a widow.

145
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,944
Sokol!

146
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,558
I was afraid you were gone.

147
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:53,181
The minibus to Germany
has not arrived yet.

148
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,976
I like you more
without the beard.

149
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,558
You are now Belgian.

150
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,377
Near Colonia.
At the reactor core.

151
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,795
- One minute into the reactor, 1,000 Euros.
- It is not dangerous?

152
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,600
- Only if you do it every month.
- You will go back?

153
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,377
No, we will return
directly to Italy.

154
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,377
Take... 1,200 Euros.

155
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,795
- How much we have in mind?
- Nearly 20,000 Euros.

156
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,962
Let me see your card again.

157
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,371
What a joy to live with you.

158
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:53,362
We must still have to wait
for the Russian.

159
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,787
- Did you find any space for the bar?
- Next week.

160
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:01,395
The bank will give me
some addresses.

161
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,558
Tell me you love me!

162
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,981
- I love you. What's wrong?
- Nothing

163
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,962
The minibus. I got to go.

164
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,635
Claudy is trying to quit.
He believes it this time.

165
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,401
- I would prefer a divorce...
- Have you spoken to Fabio?

166
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,153
He is afraid of the Russian.

167
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:38,391
But the divorce will be quicker if
I say that my husband beats me.

168
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,996
- Wont they investigate?
- I think it always works.

169
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:44,371
If it falls,
all will be shit!

170
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:48,800
- Let Fabio decide.
- I do not want him to die.

171
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,000
It is too late.
We have an agreement, is only a drug addict.

172
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,615
Lorna, you can not leave now.
We are near the end...

173
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:00,576
If something does not work,
call me.

174
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,353
Come.

175
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,957
That's it. The other arm.

176
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,957
You can now dress.

177
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,377
17 Ferreire Street
Marital Home

178
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,792
abstinence of heroin.

179
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,395
Wednesday,
November 14, 2007  21:00.

180
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,576
He is now in the hospital?

181
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,172
Yes, since that
Wednesday night.

182
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:56,162
You should have come
that very evening.

183
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,835
Present the complaint before the judge,
but I do not think that is sufficient

184
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,948
Why not?

185
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,595
Given the position of the hematoma,
they could argue that you did it.

186
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,763
It was him, he wanted drugs.

187
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,795
If at least you had one witness...
but you do not.

188
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,563
Sign here, please.

189
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,757
I need money,

190
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,005
The sooner I get to remarry,
the sooner I will get them.

191
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,410
- A real marriage?
- No. Like ours.

192
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,992
A foreigner who pays
to be Belgian

193
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,395
I have helped you quit.
And that was not the deal.

194
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,563
Now you can help me, right?

195
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:06,752
Do you agree?

196
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:16,167
I do not want me
characterised as abusive.

197
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,395
- You are already booked for drugs and theft.
- It is not the same.

198
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,367
I have never struck a woman.

199
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,016
And 5,000 Euros for the divorce,
you do not you care?

200
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,358
I can wait.

201
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,996
I am collecting allowance
and I could find a job.

202
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,386
If you accept,
I will help you to stay clean.

203
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,358
Even after the divorce.

204
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,157
Someone is coming.

205
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,972
Come on, Hit me.
Hit me, Claudy!

206
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:07,952
Come on!

207
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:43,591
You should have played your
king before your dame.

208
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,358
It is 10 to 3.

209
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,382
- One last game?
- We said until 3.

210
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,752
It is there.

211
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,153
Come on.

212
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,148
Get up.

213
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:20,186
You said you would hit me
if I stayed!

214
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,747
Come on!

215
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,358
With the fist!

216
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,153
I can not.

217
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,752
Are you okay?

218
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,196
I was struck and
I hit my head against the wall.

219
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,763
You should complain
to the police.

220
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,157
I will.

221
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:29,595
Do you agree to testify
if the police asks?

222
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:36,395
He did not seem a violent person.
Do not always trust appearances.

223
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,000
- What is your name, madam?
- Monique Sobel.

224
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,805
Can you write your name on a piece
of paper and your phone number?

225
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,982
Fabio wants to see you.
He is at the parking.

226
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,582
All fine with
the girl from the laundry.

227
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,416
- I am afraid, Lorna.
- Why? I have not done anything.

228
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,992
Do not do it.
Do not go to the police.

229
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,576
- And if it works?
- Do not do it!

230
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,795
You are his wife, take care of him.
The rest leave them to me.

231
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:13,157
Do not trust me?

232
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,757
Mandatory. I need you.

233
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,357
Okay, go now.

234
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,176
Lorna! Do not forget,
you need me too.

235
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,620
Do not want the job to get ruined.
It is my first one with the Russians.

236
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,982
Nor do I. I want my money.

237
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,958
Now you admit it.

238
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,763
Who was that guy the other
night at the station?

239
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:06,781
- Sokol.
- But Sokol has a beard.

240
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,558
Yes, but he shaved it.

241
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:38,791
Lorna, someone asked about you.

242
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,157
Excuse me,
back in two minutes.

243
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,386
I left,
I wanted to surprise you.

244
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,157
- You mean you are cured?
- Yes

245
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,615
If I am bad,
I can call the hospital.

246
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,157
You must resist.

247
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,781
- Can you give me the house keys?
- Let me get them.

248
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,757
And my money.

249
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,172
I just want 10 Euros
for cigarettes.

250
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,610
- Shall we eat together to celebrate?
- I can not, I have a lot of work.

251
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,596
Shall I prepare dinner for tonight.
It will do me good.

252
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:02,791
I need some more money
for shopping.

253
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:08,591
- When will you be back?
- I do not know, about seven.

254
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,548
Okay, bye.

255
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,552
Yes. Who is it?

256
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,552
Almost ready.

257
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,357
I made the pasta carbonara.

258
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,992
A letter came for you.
I have left it on the bed.

259
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,586
It is a letter from the judge,
he has granted the divorce.

260
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,606
- Back in an hour.
- I have cooked, and it is almost ready.

261
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,576
You can wait an hour, right?

262
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,215
- I thought we were going to celebrate!
- In an hour, okay?

263
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:08,567
Roberto, have you seen Fabio?

264
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,982
Fabio waits in the taxi
at the plaza.

265
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,982
I have not done anything more,
I swear.

266
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,163
It is a consequence
of the complaint.

267
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,163
Too late for the Russian,
he can not wait.

268
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,787
Ask!
It is only one month more!

269
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,596
And you get to marry for one week
and after divorce... it sucks!

270
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:00,419
Why?
I have a husband who attacked me.

271
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:03,157
I will make the race.

272
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,787
And you will give him 5000 Euros
the day of the divorce?

273
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,558
Yes, from the lame 10,000
of the Russian.

274
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,787
Okay, I'll call him,
just to see if he accept the month.

275
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:17,962
- Will you call me when you have talked?
- Yes

276
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,371
I spoke with the Russian,
he agrees.

277
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,757
Get out of here
with all your shit!

278
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,172
- Go!
- Shut up, my money!

279
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,801
I want to talk first!

280
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,157
Wait here.

281
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:15,976
- 10 minutes, no more.
- Alright.

282
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,576
- Give me my money!
- You started again?

283
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:24,791
- Call the hospital.
- My money!

284
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,163
Wait, calm down!

285
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:33,200
- I do not want you to start again.
- You got your divorce, what do you care?

286
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:35,362
- Give me my money!
- I will!

287
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,600
- I have left them at the laundry.
- Liar! Give them to me!

288
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,157
Give me the envelope!

289
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:55,157
- Give me the key!
- No!

290
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,567
- Is this bike alright?
- Which?

291
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,353
The blue one.

292
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,958
Yes, 50 Euros.

293
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:45,157
I will take it.

294
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,395
60 Euros to open the door
and 10 by two keys.

295
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,143
50-50?

296
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,596
- No, it is my fault, the door.
- It is also my fault.

297
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,558
- 35 per head?
- Alright.

298
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:28,010
I will ride all day.
It is something to do.

299
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,016
- Can I come at noon?
- I will be alone in the shop.

300
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,825
Not to have lunch. I need a target
in the middle of the day.

301
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:41,157
I will come by
and then leave.

302
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:45,962
I have the need to see you.

303
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,552
I am off now.

304
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,600
Here, it is better than what you have them.
See you later...

305
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:09,815
The family was here.
They will pay the funeral.

306
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:13,805
- I said I will pay.
- I told them but they said no.

307
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:34,615
- Can I see him for the last time?
- You already recognised him.

308
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,805
- The officer is gone.
- I am his wife.

309
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,763
Are you sure
you do not want to stay here?

310
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,191
The police will think
that you are fleeing.

311
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:55,795
Have you heard what I said?
They might suspect something.

312
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,163
The police has my phone number.

313
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:00,952
Give it back.

314
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,986
- The CD player.
- He does not need it anymore.

315
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,353
Give it to her.

316
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,606
You can stay one more week.
It will seem normal.

317
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,548
Where are you going to go?

318
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,401
- Where I was before.
- But the rent.

319
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,558
I have already made an agreement
with the girl.

320
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,763
- Won't you take his razor blade and things?
- No.

321
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:52,410
Spirou, come and collect things
of the junkie from the bathroom.

322
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,163
Are you going to continue
with the long face?

323
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,610
Would you tell him if you knew
the Russian would not wait?

324
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:07,016
I have helped you.
Say thanks instead of the long face.

325
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,982
For the unexpected work
another 1,000.

326
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,995
That you took care of him when
he wanted to quit. It was a job.

327
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,196
If you deny it
then it means you are not with us.

328
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,757
Still with us, right?

329
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:38,767
You were always alright!

330
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,801
You did not talk,
so we were able to overdose him.

331
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:52,781
I have the 1,000 Euros,
I will give them to you whenever you want.

332
00:52:53,719 --> 00:52:55,357
Take the photo.

333
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:00,576
Spirou. Take the bag.

334
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,377
Ms. Moreau is at home?

335
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:16,819
We had still some questions pending.
It is for the autopsy report.

336
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,757
I will take your bag.

337
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,368
We will wait in the car.

338
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,548
Come in.

339
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:36,405
The autopsy confirms that he dies
of a drug overdose.

340
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,386
Do you know of any enemy
that wanted him dead?

341
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,416
Would anybody earn anything
by killing him with an overdose?

342
00:53:49,719 --> 00:53:52,791
- He just quit them.
- He was depressed?

343
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,558
- Have he ever talked of suicide?
- No.

344
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,777
You asked for divorce
because he beat you...

345
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,558
Did he know you will get it?

346
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,148
Since when?

347
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,825
Since you received the letter from
the judge, four days ago.

348
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:20,215
- When did the dealer tell us?
- Friday, 4 days ago.

349
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:24,000
You husband called him
to buy heroin.

350
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,381
Perhaps the news
of the divorce?

351
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,395
According to the dealer,
you prevented him to buy it.

352
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,596
Alone and depressed
he could have taken the dose...

353
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,992
...which killed him on purpose or by mistake?

354
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,753
Possibly.

355
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,958
Well. We are going now.

356
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,777
- Good evening, Mrs. Moreau.
- Good evening.

357
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:45,567
Excuse me, are you the
mother of Claudy?

358
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,558
No, it is the lady
who is in the car behind you.

359
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:56,576
I am Lorna,
the wife of Claudy...

360
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,968
I wanted to give you this.

361
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:04,357
It is the money he left me.

362
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:07,157
Has he talked about me?

363
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,172
It is my son, his brother.

364
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,757
This is the wife of Claudy.

365
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:20,215
- What is that?
- The money that was left by Claudy.

366
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,763
You are his wife,
they are yours.

367
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:27,200
- For the girl...
- We do not want your money specially of Claudy.

368
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,148
Take them.

369
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,576
Good... I feel better...

370
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,596
Call me and I come...
1000 kilometers...

371
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,958
I am leaving again tonight.

372
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,757
What do we do?

373
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:20,743
- Are you asleep?
- No.

374
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:41,962
You should not worry.

375
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,596
A junkie prefers drugs
instead of life.

376
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,215
Sooner or later he would start again...
and who knows... he would die.

377
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,606
Shall we see sites
you have found for the bar?

378
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:12,947
Agreed.

379
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:24,181
Here, the number 36...

380
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,357
It is too small.

381
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,777
There is no room
for tables...

382
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,558
Come and see.

383
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:15,347
You see?

384
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,558
Only three rooms...

385
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:20,976
- And a garden?
- Is it big?

386
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:24,586
Yes, in summer
we could put tables outside.

387
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,353
I like it.

388
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:47,795
- You really have to go tonight?
- Yes.

389
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:49,757
Well, the minibus
will leave at six.

390
01:01:57,519 --> 01:01:58,747
Shall we dance?

391
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,163
Lorna, this is
Andrei Aslikov.

392
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:42,357
Kosti, the interpreter.

393
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:44,747
Sit down.

394
01:03:49,719 --> 01:03:51,971
- Want something to drink?
- A beer.

395
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,958
Something for you?

396
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,558
No, he does not take anything,
me neither.

397
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,958
Roberto, a beer!

398
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:15,381
Do you like your
Belgian identity card.

399
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:37,552
- Do you have the document?
- Yes.

400
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:53,395
The official document that says
that she is a widow and can marry again.

401
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:14,157
They paid in advance.

402
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,377
Take your share.
Three bundles.

403
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,753
In twenties.

404
01:05:24,119 --> 01:05:26,986
This is the price of a pack of
cigarettes in Moscow.

405
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,368
Want the 1,000 Euros
you rejected?

406
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,777
Like I said,
I would save them for you.

407
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:36,952
See you soon.

408
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,801
What?
Yes, I signed this morning.

409
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,401
I am so happy, Sokol!
Our bar!

410
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,572
Let me count...

411
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:36,562
One, two, three, four...
Roughly four meters.

412
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,962
The counter can be put
in this location.

413
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,606
Width is the same...
Length... wait...

414
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:55,615
One, two, three, four, five...
Fits five or six tables.

415
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:00,416
The third...
Tables also fit here.

416
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,558
There is a door...

417
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,163
We can make
a small kitchen there.

418
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,558
The door to the garden.

419
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:21,425
How nice...
It has even trees.

420
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:25,387
Perfect for summer.
Yes, yes.

421
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,957
Now I am
on the first floor...

422
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:43,029
Up the stairs there is a bathroom...
with a tub...

423
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,353
Very big...

424
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:50,020
Beside there is a room...
We could put the living room.

425
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:53,992
In this one
we can do the kitchen.

426
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:58,010
The second floor.
For sure that it is for the bedroom.

427
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,748
Wait...

428
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:28,757
Yes, I'm fine...

429
01:09:30,119 --> 01:09:32,167
I was so excited...

430
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:35,563
I had nothing to eat...

431
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,415
I loaded my mobile
and I came straight here...

432
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:07,757
Yes, I am better...

433
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:13,962
I must have
low blood pressure...

434
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,558
I will call you later.

435
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,996
Come with me...

436
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,996
Take off your clothes, put this robe on
and wait until I call you.

437
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:53,962
Any operations?

438
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,158
Any chronic disease?

439
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,358
- Do you take any medication?
- No.

440
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,196
- Your last period?
- Seven weeks ago.

441
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:09,576
Are you here for a reason?

442
01:11:11,319 --> 01:11:12,752
I want an abortion.

443
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:16,595
Voluntary interruption of pregnancy.
Alright...

444
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:22,034
We will do an ultrasound to establish
the exact date of pregnancy and set the date.

445
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:26,215
By law, we must give you
8 days to think.

446
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,158
Come and lie down.

447
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,148
Lie down.

448
01:11:48,119 --> 01:11:49,962
What, madam?
Anything wrong?

449
01:11:58,119 --> 01:11:59,757
You do not want
the ultrasound?

450
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,558
I do not want the abortion!

451
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:52,395
- In your name?
- In the name of the child I will give birth.

452
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,996
We can not open an account in that name,
a person that does not exist.

453
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:00,415
- It will be born in eight months.
- It is not born yet though.

454
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,787
I can only Book
an account number.

455
01:13:04,119 --> 01:13:06,167
Yes, but I want
to pay the money quickly.

456
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:10,600
Into your account, and transfer
to the new one when it is born.

457
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,748
Alright.

458
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,177
First I will come to the reservation
account number of the child.

459
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,177
- Still has no name. Surname?
- Moreau. M-O-R-E-A-U.

460
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:54,595
Have you forgotten the appointment
with the Russian?

461
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:59,215
You did not hear the bell?
Luckily someone came out.

462
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,616
Fabio here...
Tell Andrei we are coming...

463
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,820
Yes, I know, I had a problem
with the taxi. I am sorry.

464
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,158
Quickly, the Russians
have already arrived!

465
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,558
Are you coming like that?

466
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,158
I am pregnant.

467
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,992
What? Are you sure?

468
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:00,158
- Have you seen a doctor?
- Yes.

469
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:03,957
What about the Russian?

470
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:07,600
Why you were not careful?
You and the idiot Sokol?

471
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,411
Next week we will go for abortion.
Be quick now...

472
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,972
- What if I want to have it?
- Forget it.

473
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:22,419
- The Russian does not want you like that.
- I would ask him to recognize it.

474
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,177
Never mind,
it was not planed like that!

475
01:15:34,119 --> 01:15:36,576
Micky will be one
of the wedding witnesses.

476
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:41,957
Have something from me.

477
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:47,986
He circulates papers.
We have worked for him.

478
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:49,957
Totally trustworthy.

479
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,182
Sometimes the police
interrogate witnesses.

480
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,177
They have to see
you dancing together.

481
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,377
Andrei, you should dance
with her.

482
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:22,201
If they say they met here,
they need witnesses.

483
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,996
All right for you if I have a child?
Me, a child?

484
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:48,020
- A child, not with you.
- Marriage yes, child no!

485
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:50,977
You the wedding,
me the child!

486
01:16:54,119 --> 01:16:57,395
- No, no. We talk later.
- Never mind.

487
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:01,792
No trouble. It is nothing.

488
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:07,367
No child, only wedding.

489
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:10,587
I just asked,
If I was pregnant

490
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,382
Would he marry me?
That was the question.

491
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:26,234
He would not pay for the child.
We did not agree that.

492
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,768
- Anything wrong?
- All fine.

493
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:32,395
She asked if he would take her
if she was pregnant.

494
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:37,619
- Why did you ask him?
- I have my own life, it could happen.

495
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:39,558
If it happens,
you will have an abortion.

496
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,377
No problem.
There is no child.

497
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:47,981
If he wants,
a doctor can exam her.

498
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:56,776
He agrees.
He has a doctor as a friend.

499
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:03,162
We will let you dance now.

500
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:54,962
I told you not to mention it.

501
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,563
I just wanted to know
what he is thinking.

502
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,435
Do not do that again.
Never! Do you understand?

503
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,568
We will go
for the abortion tomorrow.

504
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,948
What is wrong?

505
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,177
The doctor who examined her
is coming.

506
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:03,757
You asked for abortion?

507
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,158
You asked for abortion?

508
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,977
- No!
- Why not?

509
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,558
You have the number of Sokol?

510
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:22,776
In my mobile, in my bag.

511
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,191
Sokol is not the father,
Claudy is.

512
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:42,347
The junkie?

513
01:20:43,319 --> 01:20:46,186
- You fucked with the junkie?
- His name is Claudy.

514
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:54,201
- Are you her partner?
- Friend. I brought her here.

515
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,358
Does the sedative
begin to take effect?

516
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:01,986
As I have shown on ultrasound,
you are not pregnant.

517
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,387
You are too disturbed
to accept it.

518
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,996
It is better to stay in 2 days
for observation.

519
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:11,752
- Do you agree?
- Yes

520
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:16,768
They will prepare your room.

521
01:21:17,319 --> 01:21:20,391
- Individual, if possible.
- I think so.

522
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,992
Why did you tell me you were pregnant?
- I am.

523
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:30,395
The doctor said you are not.

524
01:21:39,319 --> 01:21:42,391
- Mrs. Sobel?
- Ah, good evening, ma'am.

525
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:47,020
- Do you remember me? And Claudy?
- Your husband? Of course.

526
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,387
- I have to go.
- Will you come and see me?

527
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,972
One moment, I will look at the
room you were given.

528
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:07,210
- Can I stay in your room?
- Yes, there is a sofa bed.

529
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:20,191
- I do not want to return to Albania.
- This is the best solution.

530
01:22:23,319 --> 01:22:25,981
- Tell him to let me stay.
- He will say no.

531
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:28,776
He does not trust you.
You talk too much.

532
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:33,800
- You would tell it to the nurse...
- She knew Claudy...

533
01:22:46,119 --> 01:22:48,576
If you love me, understand
why I wanted the child.

534
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:51,377
There are no child,
do not get crazy.

535
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,387
- I did not want to betray you.
- Shut up!

536
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:11,025
You must complete this and this, but unsigned.
You must sign in the bank.

537
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,201
Cancel the loan. The bank only keeps
part of the money.

538
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,977
- That amount?
- The bastards!

539
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:19,962
Call me
when the doctor arrives.

540
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,363
7,000 are gone!

541
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:29,816
You are like him.
You just want your money back.

542
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,196
He lost his money with the Russians.
It is natural to want them back.

543
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:35,558
I am talking about you.

544
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:39,800
You will take as much as you gave
and then I will not see you again.

545
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,158
I will come at Gramsh.

546
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:46,552
You will not.

547
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,996
Your certificate
for the annulment of the loan...

548
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,968
and the receipt to sign.

549
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,358
Here is your money.

550
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:40,587
I take back
and the 1,000 I gave you.

551
01:24:53,119 --> 01:24:54,962
5600 is what they had spent?

552
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:00,363
5600 I paid in?

553
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:02,957
You know better.

554
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,558
The first track.

555
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,772
I will be in a month in Milan.

556
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,377
Then I'm going
to see you at Gramsh.

557
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,953
What do you want?

558
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:10,552
See you.

559
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,358
Give me the phone.

560
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,768
- Why?
- For your card.

561
01:27:05,319 --> 01:27:08,391
- What if I call you?
- Aske Spirou.

562
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:06,415
Why do not you get the highway?
I have to make refuel.

563
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:30,005
There is a gas station,
I will go while refueling.

564
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:32,776
Not here,
there is another cheaper.

565
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:51,363
I have to pee. Stop.

566
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,558
- Can't you wait?
- No

567
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,992
You do not need the bag
to urinate.

568
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:51,957
They want to kill us.

569
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,363
Do not be afraid,
I will protect you.

570
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:30,210
We will continue running...
It is safer...

571
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:40,162
We will start a fire...

572
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:13,962
I am going to get
some firewood.

573
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:47,752
Do you hear?

574
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,363
I will not let you die.

575
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:16,552
Never.

576
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:21,387
I left your father to die.

577
01:35:23,319 --> 01:35:24,957
You will live.

578
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,558
Sleep now.

579
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,363
We will leave
tomorrow morning.

580
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:33,206
We will find
something to eat and drink...

581
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,558
We will ask from a house.

582
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,153
Do not worry.

583
01:36:43,319 --> 01:36:45,981
Somebody will help us.

584
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:17,153
Goodnight

585
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,080
To our friend Henry Ingberg

586
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:52,400
A film written and directed by
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne
