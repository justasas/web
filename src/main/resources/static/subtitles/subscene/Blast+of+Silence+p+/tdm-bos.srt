00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,754
<i>Remembering, out of the black silence...</i>

2
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,958
<i>you were born in pain.</i>

3
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,635
<i>Easy. Easy does it, little mother.</i>

4
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,766
<i>We've never lost a father.</i>

5
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,738
<i>Your job is done, little mother.</i>

6
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,916
<i>You were born with hate and anger built in.</i>

7
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:00,186
<i>Took a slap on the backside</i>
<i>to blast out the scream...</i>

8
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,921
<i>and then you knew you were alive.</i>

9
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,520
<i>Eight pounds, five ounces.</i>

10
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,123
<i>Baby boy Frankie Bono.</i>

11
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,202
<i>Father doing well.</i>

12
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:17,542
<i>Later you learned to</i>
<i>hold back the scream...</i>

13
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,135
<i>and let out the hate and anger</i>
<i>another way.</i>

14
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:30,889
<i>You come into Manhattan by dark,</i>
<i>whatever time of day it is...</i>

15
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,289
<i>through tunnels,</i>
<i>like sewers hidden under the city.</i>

16
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:38,888
<i>But you don't mind that.</i>
<i>It's always that way, whatever city it is.</i>

17
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:04,813
<i>You're alone.</i>
<i>But you don't mind that.</i>

18
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,484
<i>You're a loner.</i>
<i>That's the way it should be.</i>

19
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,528
<i>You've always been alone.</i>

20
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,859
<i>By now it's your trademark.</i>

21
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,399
<i>You like it that way.</i>

22
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:27,673
<i># Silent night #</i>

23
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:32,841
<i>The railroad company makes sure you don't</i>
<i>forget you're coming to town on Christmas.</i>

24
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,886
<i>It gives you the creeps.</i>

25
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,823
<i>But that's all right.</i>
<i>Everyone on the goodwill kick,</i>
<i>maybe they'll leave you alone.</i>

26
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,253
<i>You hate cities,</i>
<i>especially at Christmas.</i>

27
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,255
<i>But that's all right too.</i>

28
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,825
<i>When the Better Business Bureau</i>
<i>rings the Christmas bell...</i>

29
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,555
<i>the suckers forget</i>
<i>there's such a business as murder...</i>

30
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,791
<i>and businessmen</i>
<i>who make it their exclusive line.</i>

31
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:23,562
<i>Like you.</i>
<i>Baby boy Frankie Bono.</i>

32
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,638
<i>Out of Cleveland.</i>

33
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,056
Nice view we have here.

34
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,720
Thank you, mister.
Merry Christmas.

35
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,958
<i>Registered as Fred Moore of Albany.</i>

36
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,503
<i>In town for a week or less,</i>
<i>on business.</i>

37
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,767
By the way, mister, if you need anything,
just ask for George.

38
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,841
Okay.

39
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:11,010
<i>At noon, you make contact.</i>

40
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,416
<i>The wind is cold as you
approach the ferry...</i>

41
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,010
<i>but the palms of your hands</i>
<i>start to sweat.</i>

42
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,452
<i>This is the first bad moment.</i>

43
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,532
<i>There's always a few on every job</i>
<i>when you're not alone.</i>

44
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,658
<i>You can depend on yourself,</i>
<i>no one else.</i>

45
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,293
<i>You've learned the hard way.</i>

46
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,702
<i>They all hate the gun they hire.</i>

47
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:38,266
<i>When people look at you,</i>
<i>baby boy Frankie Bono, they see death</i>--

48
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,278
<i>death across the counter.</i>

49
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,348
<i>Remembering.</i>

50
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,192
<i>Watch it, Frankie.</i>
<i>You almost missed him.</i>

51
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,894
<i>You'll know him by the hate in his eye</i>
<i>when he asks for a light.</i>

52
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,938
You got a match, bud?

53
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,754
Ever been in Ohio?

54
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,720
Yeah. Cleveland.

55
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,816
I got a friend that practices in Cleveland.

56
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,823
- <i>You know him?</i>
- Yeah, I know Fat Nick.

57
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,832
You got my passport?

58
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,269
Half the dough is in the envelope. You get
the other half when the job is finished.

59
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,469
- How do I get in touch?
- <i>There's a number in the envelope.</i>

60
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:49,014
<i>Call after you make the hit. I'll let you know</i>
<i>where to meet me for the payoff.</i>

61
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,015
Okay.

62
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,085
Uh, one more thing.

63
00:05:55,355 --> 00:06:00,122
If you get spotted before the hit,
the contract's off. You understand me?

64
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,094
Yeah, I understand ya.

65
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,796
<i>Now you're alone again.</i>

66
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:17,069
<i>You relax. Your hands are cold now,</i>
<i>even with gloves on.</i>

67
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,304
<i>On your own again.</i>
<i>Nothing to worry about.</i>

68
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,317
<i>The target's name is Troiano.</i>
<i>You know the type.</i>

69
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,554
<i>Second-string syndicate boss</i>
<i>with too much ambition...</i>

70
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:40,393
<i>and a mustache</i>
<i>to hide the fact he has lips like a woman...</i>

71
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,934
<i>the kind of face you hate.</i>

72
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,673
<i>Nice little home.</i>

73
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,808
<i>Quiet little community.</i>

74
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,148
<i>An hour out in the suburbs.</i>

75
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,982
<i>Every morning he's picked up</i>
<i>by two bodyguards.</i>

76
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,292
<i>Hood written all over them.</i>

77
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,386
<i>But when the neighbors read</i>
<i>the headlines, "Mobster Killed"...</i>

78
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:16,298
<i>they'll say, "But Mr. Troiano seemed like</i>
<i>such a respectable man.</i>

79
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:20,031
<i>He went to work every morning,</i>
<i>9:30 on the dot."</i>

80
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,013
<i>You already know one thing:</i>
<i>You can't make the kill at his house.</i>

81
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,018
<i>Too easily spotted.</i>

82
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,088
<i>Twenty-four hour streetlamps.</i>

83
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,085
<i>It's a laugh.</i>

84
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,632
<i>You could afford a house like that,</i>
<i>if you wanted it.</i>

85
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,962
<i>You're in the upper</i>
<i>five percent income bracket.</i>

86
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:52,060
<i>Killing pays well,</i>
<i>for a reason.</i>

87
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:56,540
<i>You have the experience and the know-how.</i>
<i>You're proud of your reputation.</i>

88
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,110
<i>Expert and thorough.</i>

89
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,612
<i>You don't have to know a man</i>
<i>to live with him.</i>

90
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,945
<i>But you have to know a man</i>
<i>like a brother to kill him.</i>

91
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,267
<i>Watch it.</i>

92
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,271
<i>Bodyguards slowing down.</i>

93
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,307
<i>Could be they're watching for a tail.</i>

94
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,308
<i>Pass them.</i>

95
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,504
<i>Don't ever take chances.</i>
<i>You're not a gambler.</i>

96
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,419
<i>Now you know the pattern</i>
<i>the job will take:</i>

97
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,459
<i>a waiting job.</i>

98
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,028
<i>Waiting to find where Troiano goes</i>
<i>to be alone.</i>

99
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,063
<i>And you know another thing.</i>

100
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,064
<i>It'll have to be quick and silent...</i>

101
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,259
<i>while he's away from his bodyguards.</i>

102
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,702
<i>It'll be a job for a gun.</i>
<i>That means another bad moment.</i>

103
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,705
<i>Another contact.</i>

104
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,900
<i>Your hands sweat a little</i>
<i>on the wheel...</i>

105
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:08,071
<i>remembering another Christmas</i>
<i>running from the cops.</i>

106
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:20,447
<i>Watch it, Frankie.</i>
<i>Danger signal. Your mind's wandering.</i>

107
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,891
<i>But you know why.</i>

108
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,328
<i>You have to do business with Ralphie,</i>
<i>and he turns your stomach.</i>

109
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,423
Oh, yeah.

110
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,424
Uh, Frankie, huh?

111
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,426
- Uh --
- Bono.

112
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,894
Bono. Hey, yeah. Come on in.

113
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,965
Geez. It's good to see ya.

114
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,660
You really surprised me.
I didn't expect nobody.

115
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,966
Kids been knocking on the door all day.

116
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,008
Trying to bother me, you know.

117
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:23,587
<i>Place is kind of a mess. You have to excuse</i>
<i>me. I didn't expect no company or nothing.</i>

118
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,428
I just had my lunch here. Hey.

119
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,327
So how you been?
You makin' a dollar?

120
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,333
- Doin' all right.
- Yeah?

121
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:39,268
Yeah. Yeah, you always did all right.

122
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:42,000
- Sit down, Frank.
- <i>I'm in a hurry, Ralph.</i>

123
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,874
Ah. Uh, you got one of them for me?

124
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,613
I, uh --

125
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,923
I heard you did a little time, huh?

126
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,959
Still in business, Ralphie.

127
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,029
What can I --
What can I do for you?

128
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,031
- I need a piece.
- That's no problem.

129
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,101
Thirty-eight with a silencer.

130
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,627
Oh.

131
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,263
A silencer, huh?

132
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,977
That, uh --

133
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:24,278
That may, uh, be a little problem.

134
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,351
You know, I, uh --

135
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,219
I gotta worry about a machinist.

136
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,290
But, uh...

137
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,189
we'll work something out.

138
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,230
But it'll cost ya.

139
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,100
Hey, Nancy.
How you doing, huh?

140
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,106
Coo, coo, coo.

141
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,439
Look how she knows me, huh?
How you doing, sweetie?

142
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,343
Coo, coo, coo, coo, coo, coo.

143
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,042
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

144
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,143
- Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.
- How much?

145
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,848
She hasn't eaten all day.
Let me get her something.

146
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,256
Here you go.
Here you go, sweetie.

147
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:13,923
Hey. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Ah!

148
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:17,366
Come on.
Yeah. You like that, don't you?

149
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,268
You like that.

150
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,533
$500, Frank.

151
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,143
Coo, coo, coo, coo.

152
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:31,706
- I'll give you two. - Oh, I'd like
to help you out, Frank, but two?

153
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,785
Ah.

154
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,056
Come on. Come on.
Here you go.

155
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,193
There's another one.

156
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,957
I'll tell you what I'll do, Frank.

157
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,829
$400. But that's rock bottom.

158
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,568
Three.

159
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:58,006
A yard and a half now,
and the rest when I get the piece.

160
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,738
Aw, Frank, make it another 50.
Come on.

161
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,781
What does it mean to you?
I gotta make something on the deal.

162
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,046
Just another 50.
Come on, Frank. Please.

163
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:13,021
All right. I'll give you the other 50.
But that's it.

164
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,753
- Do you understand?
- Sure. Sure, Frank.

165
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,761
When I make a deal, it's a deal.

166
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,763
Now we'll have a drink, huh?

167
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,095
I'm in a hurry, Ralph.
Where do I pick it up?

168
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,897
Aw, just one for the new year, Frank.

169
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,265
Hey.

170
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:34,676
Whatever happened to that, uh --
that girl you used to go with, the redhead?

171
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,748
What was her name?

172
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,345
Sally. Yeah.
Hey, Frank.

173
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,353
She, uh --

174
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,389
She liked me, didn't she?

175
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,425
Yeah. She liked you.

176
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:50,552
Yeah. Here's to, uh --

177
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,756
Here's to Sally.

178
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,163
Ralph, where do I get the goods?

179
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,531
Oh, yeah. Over on the East Side.

180
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,969
There's a barge called the <i>Katherine L.</i>
Pier 21.

181
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,839
Ask to speak to Joe Boniface.
Tell him Vinny Sintera sent you.

182
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,378
Tell him you're from Cleveland.
He'll deliver the goods.

183
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,349
- Where is that near?
- Between 23rd and 24th Street.

184
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,579
- And I want this quick.
- Oh, yeah. Anytime after tomorrow, Frank.

185
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:21,149
- All right.
- Hey. Wh-What's your rush, Frank?

186
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,629
- Gotta run, Ralphie.
- I thought we could talk over old times.

187
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,608
Hey.

188
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,544
Look here, huh?

189
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,342
Look what big Ralph got for Christmas.
Isn't that nice?

190
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,509
Yeah. Isn't that nice?

191
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,650
<i>Now you're alone again,
in another rented car.</i>

192
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,957
<i>You pick up the target</i>
<i>where you left off yesterday...</i>

193
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:33,031
<i>right on schedule.</i>

194
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:41,398
<i>Today the breaks are with you,</i>
<i>and you stay with him while</i>
<i>he makes his morning rounds.</i>

195
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,135
<i>The streets of Harlem are busy enough.</i>
<i>No one notices you.</i>

196
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,973
<i>You catch a danger signal.</i>

197
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,879
<i>Your hands are sweating, but that's</i>
<i>all right, because you know what it is:</i>

198
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,883
<i>the hate of Harlem.</i>

199
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,545
<i>You hate them, and they hate you.</i>

200
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,418
<i>Like another Harlem</i>
<i>where you grew up.</i>

201
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,504
<i>Watch it, Frankie.</i>
<i>Save your hate for Troiano.</i>

202
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,869
<i>He runs the girls and the dope</i>
<i>and the books and the numbers.</i>

203
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,500
<i>There's a guy you could
really learn to hate.</i>

204
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,171
<i>You will, before the time comes.</i>
<i>You always do.</i>

205
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,944
<i>Somehow you always hate the targets</i>
<i>before you hit 'em.</i>

206
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:42,993
<i>The sisters at the orphanage used to say,</i>
<i>"God moves in mysterious ways."</i>

207
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:48,936
<i>Sometimes you wonder if he moved you in</i>
<i>to rid the world of men like Troiano.</i>

208
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,683
<i>He thinks he looks like a gentleman</i>
<i>if his shoes are shined.</i>

209
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,254
<i>You could kill him</i>
<i>right now with pleasure.</i>

210
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,962
<i>Knock it off for today.</i>

211
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,259
<i>Pick him up tomorrow</i>
<i>when he leaves the restaurant.</i>

212
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:01,676
<i>Time to kill. Twenty-four hours</i>
<i>to stay faceless in the crowd.</i>

213
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,146
<i>Get yourself lost in the city.</i>

214
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,184
<i>Lose yourself in the Christmas spirit</i>
<i>with the rest of the suckers.</i>

215
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:12,690
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
Hello! Hello, little boys and girls.

216
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,885
Merry Christmas to you all.

217
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:20,260
Hello! Merry Christmas to you all.
- Mommy, can I ask Santa
for my presents now?

218
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:24,495
- No, honey. No. - I hope you've all
been good little boys and girls...

219
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:28,562
because Santa is here
with lots of toys and candy...

220
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:30,938
and goodies for all of you.

221
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:35,844
Ho, ho, ho. Make sure you all
go to sleep early Christmas Eve...

222
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,384
because I'll be coming down
your chimney.

223
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,385
Away!

224
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,684
<i># Deck the halls with boughs of holly #</i>

225
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,987
<i># Fa, la, la, la, la</i>
<i>la, la, la, la #</i>

226
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,187

<i># Fa, la, la, la, la</i>

232
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,218
<i>Funny. Your hands are cold</i>
<i>when you think of Christmas.</i>

233
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:24,261
- <i>Remembering.</i>
- <i># Joyful and triumphant #</i>

234
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:28,459
<i># O come ye</i>
<i>O come ye #</i>

235
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:34,096
<i># To Bethlehem #</i>

236
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:38,802

00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,247
<i># O come let us adore him #</i>

239
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,253
<i>Remembering other Christmases.</i>

240
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,196
<i>Pushing your nose against</i>
<i>the plate glass store windows...</i>

241
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,495
<i>till the cold of it</i>
<i>made your head ache.</i>

242
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,765
<i>Wishing for something.</i>
<i>What was it?</i>

243
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,238
<i>Roller skates? Bike?</i>

244
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,935
<i>Sled? Games?</i>

245
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,808
<i>Nothing like that.</i>
<i>Something bigger.</i>

246
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,404
<i>More important.</i>
<i>Something special.</i>

247
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,938
<i>Alone at dinner.</i>

248
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,476
<i>Your hands are hot</i>
<i>remembering the hot, sweaty hands...</i>

249
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,445
<i>of the mother superior holding you.</i>

250
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,979
- <i>It can't be.</i>
- <i>Watch it. Danger signal.</i>

251
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,113
<i>And now you catch it.</i>
<i>Another bad moment.</i>

252
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,454
<i>Of all crummy times.</i>

253
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,087
<i>The familiar face out of the past.</i>
<i>Good old Pete from the orphanage.</i>

254
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,722
<i>It has to happen now and then.</i>
<i>You can handle it.</i>

255
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:46,861
<i>But why now? You feel hot, like they</i>
<i>were crowding in and pushing you.</i>

256
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,236
<i>Who? Anyone. Everyone.</i>

257
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,605
<i>Pete. You hate the type.</i>

258
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,178
<i>You'd like to push his loud mouth in.</i>

259
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,009
<i>You smile. You're polite.</i>
<i>You don't even hear the words.</i>

260
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,015
<i>Yak, yak, yak, like a parrot.</i>

261
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:04,521
<i>Then he's reminding you.</i>
<i>There was a girl</i>--<i>his sister. Lori.</i>

262
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:08,286
<i>You don't usually remember names,</i>
<i>especially women's names.</i>

263
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:11,726
<i>But Lori.</i>
<i>There was something special there.</i>

264
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,492
Tell me about yourself, Frankie.

265
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,658
What have you been doing?

266
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,260
Petey, I can't stay.
I've gotta take off.

267
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,840
What, are you kidding?

268
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,034
Hey, waiter.
Bring me two more here.

269
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,111
You're going no place, man.

270
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,546
Come on.

271
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,210
Do I have to lay you out like I used to?

272
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,383
Come on now, Frankie.
Fill me in.

273
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,187
<i>Where the hell did you disappear to?</i>

274
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:46,058
Well, I've... been on the move a lot.

275
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,132
And I --

276
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:53,134
Well, sure. Sure. Who hasn't?

277
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:57,140
As for me, maybe you remember.
I was always pretty fair with a paintbrush.

278
00:22:57,242 --> 00:23:01,235
So when I came out of the army,
I studied commercial art. G.I. Bill.

279
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:04,975
And finally got myself a job
with an advertising agency.

280
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,515
I guess I been kind of lucky.

281
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,521
Glad to hear it, Petey.

282
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,183
<i>S-Say.</i>

283
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:18,888
<i>What are you doing tonight? I mean,</i>
<i>Lori's giving a party, and you're coming.</i>

284
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,932
No. I can't make it, kid.
I've gotta go.

285
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:24,433
- Waiter.
- Aw, nonsense. Listen, Frankie.

286
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,767
It's Christmas Eve.
Aw, Frankie. You gotta come.

287
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,671
- I can't make it. - There'll be a
lot of real swinging people there.

288
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,177
You'll have a wonderful time.
Besides, here she comes now.

289
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,477
Hey, Lori. Look who's here. How about
it, huh, Lori? You recognize this guy?

290
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,448
Hello, Frankie.

291
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,122
Hello.

292
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,520
- You sure have changed.
- Go on. She hasn't changed a bit.

293
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:51,255
Maybe a little longer, wider.
That's all.

294
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,730
Hey, Lori. We gonna let him have
a lonely old beer on Christmas Eve?

295
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,733
<i>You know you're making a mistake.</i>

296
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,736
<i>But you tell yourself</i>
<i>maybe it's smarter to play it cool.</i>

297
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,274
<i>Go for one drink,</i>
<i>stay for a dance maybe, then get out.</i>

298
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:07,402
<i>You tell yourself they might get</i>
<i>suspicious if you turn down the invite.</i>

299
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:09,742
<i>Maybe you're right.</i>
<i>Maybe you're smart.</i>

300
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,840
<i>Maybe you're kidding yourself.</i>
<i>So watch it.</i>

301
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,319
<i>You hate parties.</i>

302
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,025
<i>You sit alone waiting for a chance</i>
<i>to blow the noisy crowd out of your ears...</i>

303
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,102
<i>wondering what you're doing here.</i>

304
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,703
<i>If you want a woman, buy one.</i>

305
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,709
<i>In the dark,</i>
<i>so she won't remember your face.</i>

306
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,041
<i>But for some reason you stall around...</i>

307
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,275
<i>telling yourself it's as good a way</i>
<i>as any to kill time.</i>

308
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,181
<i>Ding. Ding, dong, ding.</i>

309
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,187
<i>Ding, dong, ding.</i>

310
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,952
<i>Ding, dong, ding.</i>

311
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:27,681
I've always wanted
to dance with you, Frankie.

312
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,726
Come on. Go ahead.
We're all friends here.

313
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,661
Yeah. Go ahead, Frankie.
My sister only asks once, you know.

314
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,171
You're not having a very good time,
are you?

315
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,873
I guess I just don't mix in.

316
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,949
Try.

317
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,320
That's more like it.

318
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,616
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Listen. Quiet down. Listen.

319
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,525
Twenty years ago I won a great contest.
I'll never forget it.

320
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,121
And just to prove my manhood,
I'm gonna do so again.

321
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:13,671
Frankie, I hereby challenge you to another
peanut-pushing contest with the nose.

322
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,206
Of course, I have a slight advantage.

323
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:20,301
- Will you take this loudmouth?
- Come on. He hasn't a chance.
I've been practicing for years.

324
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:24,542
Come on, Frankie. I'm giving
you a second chance. Very few
people get that in their life.

325
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,549
- Come on.
- Go get 'em, Frankie.

326
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,856
One for you.

327
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,393
On your mark, get set, go!

328
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,106
Well, you son of a gun. You won.

329
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,096
<i>December 25.</i>

330
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,130
<i>You have all of Christmas Day to kill.</i>

331
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,132
<i>You hate Christmas so much...</i>

332
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,260
<i>you can't stand the thought of sweating</i>
<i>it out alone in a crummy hotel room.</i>

333
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:58,104
<i># In excelsis Deo #</i>

334
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:02,771
<i># Gloria #</i>

335
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,617

337
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,561
- Hi.
- Hello.

338
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:31,233
You know, I had such a funny feeling.
I wasn't sure you'd come.

339
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,811
- Uh, here.
- Oh.

340
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,813
Thanks, Frankie.

341
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,974
Merry Christmas to you.

342
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,177
Hey, come on in.

343
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,462
No, it really was great.

344
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:56,129
I haven't eaten a meal like this in years.

345
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,829
Why not, Frankie?

346
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:03,669
Well, you know, I've, uh, moved around
a lot. Never settled in one place.

347
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,800
Doing what?

348
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,937
<i>You certainly can be evasive.</i>

349
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,717
Where did you go
when you left Chillicothe?

350
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,715
<i>Frankie.</i>

351
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,597
Cleveland.

352
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,429
I was sick of that little burg.
I wanted a big city.

353
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,370
And what did you do?

354
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,437
I got a job in this big parking lot.

355
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,744
The old guy who ran it -- he liked me.
He treated me like a father.

356
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,147
He made me manager.

357
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,619
And I was doing pretty good...

358
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:52,849
until the whole damn thing fell apart.

359
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,016
What do you mean?

360
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,562
Oh, there were these local racket guys,
and they tried to shake the old man down.

361
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,427
They bombed his house,
and they killed his wife.

362
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,501
- Why?
- Why?

363
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,762
You just don't ask questions like that.
That's why.

364
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,670
All I know is the old guy took off
for Florida like a scared rabbit.

365
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:12,607
- Maybe I should have gone with him.
- What did you do?

366
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,042
What do you mean what did I do?

367
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,671
I look to stay alive. That's what I do.

368
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:20,012
- Now I --
- Let's just forget the whole thing, shall we?

369
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,881
I vote we dance.

370
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:56,249
Unless, of course, you'd rather push
another peanut across the floor.

371
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,790
Come on, Frankie.

372
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,182
That was some dance.

373
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,616
- Let's sit down.
- No, Frankie.

374
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,688
Frankie, no!

375
00:31:30,788 --> 00:31:32,756
No! Frankie!

376
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:46,803
I'm sorry.

377
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,875
I'm very sorry.

378
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,378
Sometimes I just don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

379
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:15,098
I think you better go, Frank.

380
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:20,332
Oh, Lori, please.
Let me stay. I --

381
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,736
I promise you I won't get rough anymore.

382
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,444
<i>I just got carried away.</i>

383
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,811
Please, Lori.

384
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,824
Please.

385
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,327
Suppose we have
a warm-up on the coffee.

386
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,848
Lori, look. I want to explain
about what happened over there.

387
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:18,417
Frankie, look.
Just forget it. Really.

388
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:22,397
There's nothing to say,
and... it's okay. It's fine.

389
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,036
You know, Frankie,
you're really a very attractive guy.
How come you're not married?

390
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,107
I don't know.

391
00:33:32,243 --> 00:33:35,144
Well, I think--
I think what you probably need is...

392
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,646
a girl, or someone.

393
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:41,082
<i>You know, someone</i>
<i>that you could feel good with.</i>

394
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,590
Someone who could make
you feel at home. That's all.

395
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,262
Drink your coffee, Frankie.

396
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,832
And then you'd better leave.
I really am very tired.

397
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,150
<i>December 26.</i>

398
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:26,196
<i>Troiano has had his day in church,</i>
<i>and he's back at work.</i>

399
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,265
<i>So are you.</i>

400
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:41,508
<i>You're feeling better now</i>
<i>you got Christmas out of your system.</i>

401
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:45,412
<i>You begin to feel the excitement</i>
<i>that always comes as you start to close in.</i>

402
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,950
<i>You have a crazy hunch something new</i>
<i>will happen today...</i>

403
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,043
<i>to break the monotony of waiting.</i>

404
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:52,054
<i>And you're right.</i>

405
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:13,007
<i>In the middle of the afternoon,</i>
<i>Troiano goes into a small brownstone.</i>

406
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,511
<i>He leaves his protection outside.</i>

407
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,878
<i>Now you know where Troiano goes alone.</i>

408
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,281
<i>But you still don't know why.</i>

409
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,536
<i>You should have figured it.</i>

410
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,606
<i>Troiano was strictly in character.</i>

411
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:47,610
<i>Christmas Day with the family. Day after</i>
<i>Christmas shacked up with a dame.</i>

412
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,613
<i>Four hours alone.</i>
<i>Or almost alone.</i>

413
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,513
<i>Now you know</i>
<i>where the target is going to get hit.</i>

414
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,677
<i>The details will have to be worked out.</i>

415
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,981
<i>But the general setup is perfect.</i>

416
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:02,423
<i>And you're learning to hate Troiano like you</i>
<i>haven't hated anyone since the old man.</i>

417

<i># Oh, why does it happen #</i>

How you doin', Frankie?

482
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,412
You, uh, see the birthday party outside?

483
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,210
I usually don't like birthday parties.

484
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,979
You know, I figure like it's bad luck.

485
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,020
I mean, like why tempt fate?

486
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,147
What are you drivin' at, fatty?

487
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,782
You know, Frank,
I may be fat over here...

488
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,861
but I'm not fat up here.

489
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:08,625
You know, I figure we're gonna
have to renegotiate the contract.

490
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,929
Renegotiate this.
We made a deal.

491
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,004
Yeah, I know we made a deal, Frank...

492
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:17,505
but I'd had no idea I'd have to outfit
the whole safari out there.

493
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,701
I mean, you're goin' after
big game, Frank.

494
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,938
Yeah, you're gonna have to
pay luxury prices, boy.

495
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,981
I'll pay you nothin'.

496
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,550
I'm warnin' you, fatty. You're stickin'
your belly where it doesn't belong.

497
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,142
Don't threaten me.

498
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,222
Without a gun in your fist,
you're nothin'.

499
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,398
You know, I overpaid you
in the first place.

500
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,501
Why don't you go home
and feed your rats?

501
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,201
Fine, Frank. I'll go home.

502
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:54,777
But if I just happen
to read in the newspaper...

503
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:58,371
that our friend out there
ain't havin' no more birthday parties...

504
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,575
well, you come by and see old Ralph.

505
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,380
I figure you're gonna owe him
a few bucks or somethin'.

506
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,723
You're over your head, fatty.

507
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,724
We'll see, Frank. We'll see.

508
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,423
I gotta run now.
I'm in a hurry.

509
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,674
# The orange sky is burning
on the scaffold looking down #

510
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:29,575
# I'll soon be with my baby #

511
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,807
# Far away #

512
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,714
# From this torrid #

513
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:41,724
# Torrid town #

514
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,867
<i>You're not marked up. That's a break.</i>

515
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,132
<i>You're sweating all over your body.</i>

516
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,401
<i>You tell yourself it's the steam heat...</i>

517
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,603
<i>but you know the radiator's</i>
<i>been cold all night.</i>

518
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:40,046
<i>You know you'll stay in a sweat</i>
<i>till they find the body and the news breaks.</i>

519
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:52,227
That was a fine ballad
from Gus Lowen and his ensemble.

520
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,992
And now --

521
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,383
- Yeah?
- This is Cleveland.

522
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,391
Oh, hello, Cleveland.

523
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,121
- Listen, I gotta talk to you.
- So talk.

524
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:34,595
I mean, not on the phone.
I wanna meet with you.

525
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:36,825
Did you take care of everything?

526
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:40,391
No. What I'm trying to tell you
is there's been some trouble.

527
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,904
Did you see the papers?

528
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:46,840
- How the hell did you get into
that? - I couldn't help it. He
was trying to shake me down.

529
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:49,912
All right. Were you spotted?

530
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:53,813
- No, but what I want to tell you --
- I ain't interested in the details.

531
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,943
- But listen. Let me tell you --
- I told you, I ain't interested.

532
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,113
You got no time to play with.

533
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:04,125
We're only interested in one thing:
you gettin' that job done.

534
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,821
What I wanna tell you
is I don't want to do the job!

535
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,989
What?

536
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,863
I want out!

537
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:14,994
All right.
Now listen careful, Cleveland.

538
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,573
Item one: For just thinkin'
what you just said...

539
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,574
you're in real trouble...

540
00:51:19,676 --> 00:51:21,644
and they're gonna hear
about this call.

541
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,975
- But I --
- Item two:

542
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:29,018
You made a contract with us,
so you'll do the job and you'll do it right.

543
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,644
Then we'll listen to your problems.

544
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,280
You've got till New Year's Eve.

545
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:37,519
And remember,
you're in trouble now.

546
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:55,740
<i>The worst trouble in your life,</i>
<i>but you can't get the scream</i>
<i>out of your head to concentrate.</i>

547
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,815
<i>For the first time in your life,</i>
<i>you don't wanna be alone.</i>

548
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:18,597
Hello?

549
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:21,000
Lori? This is Frank.

550
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:25,303
Oh. Hello, Frank.

551
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,603
Lori, I've gotta see you.

552
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,077
Is something wrong?

553
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,171
Are you in trouble?

554
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,375
No, uh -- No trouble. I --

555
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,180
I've just gotta see you.
It's important.

556
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,551
Frank, I'm sorry,
but it's just impossible for me...

557
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,181
to get away
for the next couple of days.

558
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,954
Christmas week practically
my whole family comes to town...

559
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,621
and, well, you know how it is.

560
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,566
Yeah, I know.

561
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,659
Couldn't you tell me over the phone?

562
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:58,207
No. No, I -- I wanted to see you
when I tell you.

563
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,402
Frank...

564
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,639
if it's about the other night...

565
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:07,376
I'd like you to know
I have no hard feelings...

566
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:11,716
and as far as I'm concerned,
we're still the same friends.

567
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,248
Okay?

568
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,826
Okay.

569
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:21,125
Frank, I really can't
talk any longer now...

570
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:25,759
but why don't you call me next week
when things won't be as hectic?

571
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:32,705
All right, Lori.
I'll -- I'll speak to you soon.

572
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,277
Okay. Bye, Frank.

573
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,505
Oh, by the way--

574
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:39,946
I'd like to wish you
a happy New Year.

575
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,580
Thanks.

576
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:55,989
<i>Okay, she doesn't know it,</i>
<i>but she just did you a big favor.</i>

577
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:59,034
<i>You're alone, the way you were born.</i>

578
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:02,263
<i>Your head's cooler</i>
<i>and the scream's fading away.</i>

579
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,000
<i>Your hands are still hot,</i>
<i>but you know why.</i>

580
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,900
<i>Another bad moment.</i>

581
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:35,961
<i>Another contact, to pick up the gun</i>
<i>fat Ralphie ordered.</i>

582
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:40,031
<i>And you wonder how much the contact</i>
<i>knows about Ralphie's being whacked out...</i>

583
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:43,271
<i>and if it means something to him.</i>

584
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,678
Hey.

585
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:49,309
- Where can I find Joe Boniface?
- What do you wanna know for?

586
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:53,048
I'm a friend of Vinny Sintera's.
He asked me to say hello.

587
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:55,056
I'm Joe Boniface.

588
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:59,924
You got some merchandise
I'm interested in.

589
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,930
Come on up.

590
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:07,265
What do you want?

591
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:10,567
I can use a .38 special
with a silencer.

592
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,574
Oh, yeah.
Had a lot of trouble gettin' that.

593
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,474
- They're not easy to get these days,
you know. - Oh, cut your cryin', pop.

594
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,206
- You're gettin' paid for it.
- Uh-huh.

595
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:31,152
<i>You're all right.</i>
<i>He doesn't know or doesn't care.</i>

596
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:35,027
<i>You're relaxing now,</i>
<i>hands cold again.</i>

597
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:37,099
<i>There'll be a gun in them soon.</i>

598
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,464
<i>And your mind's running</i>
<i>clear and cool.</i>

599
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:44,097
<i>Expert, as an engineer</i>
<i>designing a bridge.</i>

600
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:46,175
<i>You could have been an engineer.</i>

601
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:04,283
<i>You're moving now, smooth...</i>

602
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:07,192
<i>like a piece of precision machinery.</i>

603
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:09,765
<i>Before you hit the target</i>
<i>in his little love nest...</i>

604
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,391
<i>you have to know everything</i>
<i>about the flat and the building...</i>

605
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,868
<i>as well as the architect</i>
<i>who built it.</i>

606
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:17,439
<i>You could have been an architect too.</i>

607
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:17,391
Hello. Hello, Mr. Troiano.
It's so good to see you.

608
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,264
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm so tired.

609
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,430
Can never get through here. There's
so much work, I can never get through.

610
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,135
- Thank you for taking care
of the apartment. - Thank
you. Thank you so much.

611
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:31,304
You know, the people upstairs don't think
I'm entitled to a life of my own.

612
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:34,645
<i>I have a right to my own life!</i>
<i>4:00 this afternoon</i>--

613
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,645
<i>I'm supposed to meet my sister at 6:30.</i>

614
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,528
<i>Keeping watch on Troiano...</i>

615
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,997
<i>you feel the hate shaping up at the back</i>
<i>of your neck where the hair is short.</i>

616
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,000
<i>That's a good sign.</i>

617
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:56,367
<i>You get a feeling</i>
<i>this is how it was meant to be</i>--

618
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,600
<i>like you are Troiano's fate...</i>

619
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:01,609
<i>like you're God.</i>

620
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:41,449
<i>Now you know you have a free hour</i>
<i>inside the love nest.</i>

621
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,645
<i>Relax! Watch it. Steady, Frankie boy.</i>

622
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,344
<i>So the dame's phone rings.</i>

623
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:59,580
<i>Where'd you get the crazy idea</i>
<i>it was Lori? Calling you here?</i>

624
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,987
<i>Concentrate.</i>

625
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,559
<i>No gun. Concentrate.</i>

626
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,960
<i>Concentrate. A life depends on it.</i>

627
01:01:08,064 --> 01:01:10,555
<i>No neighbors</i>
<i>to peek in from any window.</i>

628
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,192
<i>Troiano wanted his privacy.</i>

629
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:19,870
<i>Okay. That just about wraps it up</i>
<i>in a beautiful package.</i>

630
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:23,935
<i>Just a couple more details</i>
<i>before you tie the baby blue ribbon on it.</i>

631
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,866
<i>The last day.</i>

632
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:48,994
<i>In just a few more hours,</i>
<i>your job will be done.</i>

633
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,073
<i>Check and recheck.</i>

634
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:05,195
<i>Nothing can go wrong. No mistakes.</i>

635
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,902
<i>Because this is your last job.</i>

636
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:11,104
<i>You've got that figured out now.</i>
<i>You faced fact.</i>

637
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:13,182
<i>You know you're through.</i>

638
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:24,621
<i>You killed fat Ralphie in panic,</i>
<i>then you tried to run out.</i>

639
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:27,787
<i>They don't like that,</i>
<i>the people who hire you.</i>

640
01:04:27,897 --> 01:04:30,798
<i>They say a guy's cracking up</i>
<i>when that happens.</i>

641
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,800
<i>Maybe they're right.</i>
<i>Watch it.</i>

642
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:34,870
<i>Hold on till it's over.</i>

643
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:45,942
<i>How do you like that?</i>

644
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,482
<i>It's not in your head at all.</i>

645
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:53,044
<i>An orphanage. A crummy orphanage</i>
<i>right under your nose.</i>

646
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:00,928
<i>Remembering.</i>

647
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:29,214
<i>Just one more killing, Frankie,</i>
<i>then you're through.</i>

648
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:33,284
<i>One more to die,</i>
<i>and then you won't have to be alone.</i>

649
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,006
<i>You know, Frankie,</i>
<i>you're really a very attractive guy.</i>

650
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,077
<i>How come you're not married?</i>

651
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:52,511
<i>What you probably need is a girl...</i>

652
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,583
<i>or someone.</i>

653
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:57,482
<i>You know, someone</i>
<i>that you could feel good with.</i>

654
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:00,111
<i>Someone who could</i>
<i>make you feel at home.</i>

655
01:06:31,253 --> 01:06:34,450
- Frankie.
- Lori, I-I wanna talk to you.

656
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:38,084
Oh, I-I'm terribly sorry, Frank.
It's so early, and I --

657
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:40,128
It's -- It's important.

658
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:43,630
You know, what we said
the other night about --

659
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:46,998
what you told me about --
about needing somebody.

660
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:50,095
Well, I -- I've been thinking about it,
and you were right.

661
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,565
I do need somebody.

662
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,804
What I'm trying to say is this:

663
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:59,676
Lori, I need you.

664
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:02,979
- <i>Frank, I'm sorry</i>--
- <i>Lori, sweetheart, have you got</i>--

665
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,985
Hello, Frank.

666
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:11,359
- What the hell is this?
- I'm -- I'm terribly sorry, Frankie.

667
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,561
You must have misunderstood.

668
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:16,631
What?

669
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,530
<i>It's just that you were so lonely.</i>

670
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:22,126
- <i>I just thought</i>--
- You thought what?

671
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:24,206
- <i>Well, you really ought to call</i>--
- Shut up!

672
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:28,008
What?

673
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,844
- That --
- Never mind. Never mind.

674
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,017
I understand.

675
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,051
Merry Christmas.

676
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,150
<i>Watch it, Frankie. Danger signals.</i>

677
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:46,387
<i>Like electric current, like lightning,</i>
<i>like fire in the night...</i>

678
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:48,861
<i>and sirens screaming in your head.</i>

679
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:51,956
<i>Don't think. Don't remember.</i>
<i>Don't look ahead.</i>

680
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,434
<i>Concentrate.</i>

681
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:56,971
<i>You have a job to do,</i>
<i>and you're an expert.</i>

682
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,837
<i>A killer who doesn't kill</i>
<i>gets killed.</i>

683
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:02,642
<i>One last contact</i>-- <i>to pick up your money.</i>

684
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:05,714
<i>Only a few minutes,</i>
<i>and then you'll be alone again...</i>

685
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:09,875
<i>the way you were meant to be,</i>
<i>the way you like it.</i>

686
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,602
This is Cleveland.

687
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,962
<i>"God moves in mysterious ways,"they said.</i>

688
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:50,596
<i>Maybe he is on your side,</i>
<i>the way it all worked out.</i>

689
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,970
<i>Remembering other Christmases...</i>

690
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:56,875
<i>wishing for something,</i>
<i>something important, something special.</i>

691
01:16:56,979 --> 01:17:00,107
<i>And this is it,</i>
<i>baby boy Frankie Bono.</i>

692
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,547
<i>You're alone now. All alone.</i>

693
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,776
<i>The scream is dead.</i>

694
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:08,549
<i>There's no pain.</i>
<i>You're home again.</i>

695
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:11,990
<i>Back in the cold, black silence.</i>
