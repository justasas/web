1
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,453
Er, you folks are
American citizens?

2
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,788
I am, yes.

3
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,290
- Where were you born, miss?
- Mrs.

4
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,209
- What?
- Philadelphia.

5
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,128
The name is Vargas.

6
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,714
Hey, Jim! You see who's here?

7
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,967
Sure. Mr Vargas.
Hot on the trail of another dope ring?

8
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,761
Hot on the trail of a chocolate soda
for my wife.

9
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,930
- Your wife?
- Barely a bride, officer.

10
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,808
Hey, can I get through?

11
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,269
A lot of talk up here about
how you cracked that Grandi business.

12
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,354
I hear you caught the big boss.

13
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,940
No, only one of them.
The Grandis are a big family.

14
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,066
Good night.

15
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,609
No purchases, Mr Linnekar?

16
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,069
Hey. Hey, I got this...

17
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,864
- You're an American citizen, miss?
- No, I got this ticking noise.

18
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,657
- Yeah, OK.
- No, really.

19
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,410
- This ticking noise in my head.
- Good night.

20
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,875
Mike? Do you realise
this is the very first time

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,877
we've been together
in my country?

22
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,464
Do you realise I haven't kissed you
in over an hour?

23
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,769
Mike, what happened?

24
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,062
That car that just passed us
exploded.

25
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,023
The car?
How could it do that?

26
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,358
I don't know.
I'll have to try to find out.

27
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,028
You'd better not come any closer.
The...

28
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,906
We'll have to postpone that soda,
I'm afraid.

29
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,997
- But Mike, couldn't <i>I...</i>
- Susie, please be careful.

30
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,588
- This could be very bad for us.
- For us?

31
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,173
For Mexico, I mean.

32
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,550
Anyway, there's nothing
I can do over here.

33
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,512
- So?
- So, I'll try not to be too long.

34
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,305
Go on, darling.

35
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,098
You wait at the hotel.

36
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,816
Blaine, I thought you were
back in Washington.

37
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,942
I leave tomorrow.

38
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,652
You know Schwartz
of the local D.A.'s office.

39
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,362
- How do you do, sir?
- Hi.

40
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,155
Can you tell me
who's in charge here?

41
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,949
I can't even tell you
what happened.

42
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,243
Why aren't you back in Mexico City?
Isn't that dope trial coming up?

43
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,828
Grandi? This Thursday.

44
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,455
I'd hoped to go back
on the morning plane, but now...

45
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,457
- You mean this business?
- I'm afraid so.

46
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,335
That bomb came
from the Mexican side of the border.

47
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,213
- The car did.
- Wow.

48
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,237
Lady, he says you don't understand
what he wants.

49
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,072
I understand very well
what he wants.

50
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,615
He saved your life, lady.

51
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,159
Tell him I'm a married woman.

52
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,788
And that my husband is a great,
big official in the government,

53
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,542
ready and willing to knock out
all those pretty front teeth of his.

54
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,252
That's it, lady, your husband.

55
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,170
That's what he wants
to talk to you about.

56
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,094
"Follow this boy at once.

57
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,097
"We have something
very important for Mr Vargas."

58
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,059
Well, what have I got to lose?

59
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,853
Don't answer that.

60
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,646
Lead on, Pancho.

61
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,733
Across the border again?

62
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,657
Hey, Doc. Here comes the D.A.

63
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,079
Where's Captain Quinlan?

64
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,124
Got him out of bed at his ranch.
He's on his way.

65
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,666
Old Hank must be the only one
in the county

66
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,543
who didn't hear the explosion.

67
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,507
Terrible thing, isn't it?
Has the daughter been told?

68
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,259
They're bringing her over right now.

69
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,345
- That's right.
- To identify her father's body.

70
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,852
An hour ago, Rudy Linnekar
had this town in his pocket.

71
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,188
Now you can strain him
through a sieve.

72
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,281
I guess that's my father.

73
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,242
Now, Miss Linnekar,
can you identify the woman?

74
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,455
I'm not acquainted
with my father's girlfriends.

75
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,248
OK, Miss Linnekar.

76
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,420
Well, here comes Hank at last.

77
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,132
Vargas, you've heard of Hank Quinlan,
our local police celebrity.

78
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:49,219
- I'd like to meet him.
- That's what <i>you</i> think.

79
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,480
Did they toss it in or was it
planted ahead of time?

80
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,026
- Who?
- Whoever did it, you jackass.

81
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,706
Hey, lady, look at the pretty baby.

82
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:37,392
My nephew says
you call him Pancho. Why?

83
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,397
- Why you call him Pancho?
- Just for laughs, I guess.

84
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,108
This note says
you have something for my husband.

85
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,319
Yeah, Sefior Vargas?

86
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,072
You know who I am?

87
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,951
- You want me to guess?
- My name is Grandi.

88
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,456
You have heard
that name before?

89
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,583
Well, aside from the case
my husband's been working on,

90
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,877
isn't Grandi
what that nightclub is called?

91
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,795
Yeah?

92
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,213
Yes.

93
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,718
Grandi's Rancho Grande.
Like <i>a...</i> kind of a joke.

94
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,055
Get it?

95
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,183
I can't say it's the funniest thing
lever heard.

96
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:22,020
The name ain't Mexican.
I got a permit for this thing.

97
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,732
The Grandi family is living
here in Los Robles a long time.

98
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:27,776
Some of us in Mexico,
some of us on this side.

99
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,236
- Must be convenient for business.
- Yeah.

100
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:35,158
- What business?
- Grandi business.

101
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,284
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

102
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,911
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

103
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,676
You know what's wrong with you,
Mr Grandi?

104
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,749
You've been seeing
too many gangster movies.

105
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,501
Mike may be spoiling
some of your fun...

106
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,337
- Mike?
- My husband. Yeah!

107
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,964
And if you're trying
to scare me into calling him off,

108
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,051
let me tell you something,
Mr Grandi.

109
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,220
I may be scared, but he won't be.

110
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,180
You figure it was a bomb then, Hank?

111
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,725
Well, Chief, Rudy Linnekar
could have been struck by lightning.

112
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,851
Where's the daughter?

113
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,646
Marcia? Got her right here
waiting for you, Hank.

114
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,231
Let her go.

115
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,858
You don't even want
to question the daughter?

116
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,152
Let her go and put a tail on her.

117
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,531
Let's see if there was some jane
that Rudy Linnekar had...

118
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,116
Just some, stripteaser.

119
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,661
Well, what do you know?
The D.A. in a monkey suit.

120
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,038
- Well, it's...
- You, too. You got one of them suits.

121
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,207
- Well, we were all at the banquet.
- A political rally?

122
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,627
- No, Tootsie's Steak House.
- G-Men, T-Men.

123
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,965
Quite a little tea party.
All for Rudy Linnekar's bonfire.

124
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,677
Yeah, I hear you even invited
some kind of a Mexic...

125
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,722
I don't think Mr Vargas
claims any jurisdiction.

126
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,015
Well, I should hope not.

127
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,810
Two people, Americans,
are blown to hash with dynamite,

128
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,271
practically in my own police station.

129
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,482
I wonder what makes you
so very sure it was dynamite?

130
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:50,942
<i>My leg.</i>

131
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,694
- Your what?
- His game leg.

132
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:57,031
Sometimes he gets a kind of a twinge,
like folks do for a change of weather.

133
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,075
Intuition, he calls it.

134
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,578
Vargas has a theory
that the murder was committed

135
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,288
outside of our jurisdiction.

136
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,833
Of course, we're all of us
going to cooperate with Mr Vargas here.

137
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,961
Don't worry, Captain. I'm merely what
the United Nations would call an observer.

138
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,714
Well, you don't talk like one.
I'll say that for you.

139
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,465
A Mexican, I mean.

140
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,844
Captain, you won't have
any trouble with me.

141
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,680
You bet your sweet life I won't.

142
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,310
As a matter of fact, Mike must be
looking for me just about now,

143
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,770
and that's bound to mean trouble.

144
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,147
What's so funny about that?

145
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,403
He wants to know
if your husband is jealous, Senora.

146
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,447
You silly little pig.

147
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,243
- Who are you talking about?
- I'm talking about you.

148
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,748
You ridiculous old-fashioned,
jug-eared, lopsided little Caesar.

149
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,335
I didn't get that, Sefiora.
You'll have to talk slow.

150
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,504
I'm talking slow.
But in a minute I'll start to yell.

151
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,799
I wouldn't do that, Sefiora.

152
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:05,391
See, just a little while ago,
this was a quiet, peaceful town here.

153
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,354
- And now this Vargas comes along...
- Mr Grandi! Mr Grandi.

154
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,731
You said you had something
for my husband.

155
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,576
Don't you think it's time
you gave it to me?

156
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,362
I think it's time for him
to lay off my brother in Mexico City!

157
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,947
That's advice.

158
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,659
That's what I got for him.

159
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,290
Then the conference is over?

160
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,377
I'm free to leave?

161
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,087
Free?

162
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,966
Nobody was holding you
or keeping you, Mrs Vargas.

163
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,093
Nobody laid a hand on you.

164
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,681
You were just paying us a little visit.

165
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,350
<i>Well...</i>

166
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,399
Goodbye, all.

167
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:10,123
Quinlan, we just can't cross over
into Mexico like this.

168
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,500
- Thousands do every day.
- Tourists, but...

169
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,877
So, we're tourists.

170
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,005
Captain Quinlan
wants to check on the girl

171
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,007
that was with Linnekar
in the death car.

172
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,092
I know. She was
one of the stripteasers.

173
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,846
- I think I told you.
- No, Pete told me before I left the ranch.

174
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,014
That's right.

175
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,892
And I told him that I wanted to see
all the stripteasers in the joint.

176
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,895
This is Mexican territory.
What can we do?

177
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:37,025
There's no law against visitors asking
questions, is there, Mr Vargas?

178
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,360
Hey, where'd he go?

179
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,781
- Susie, where in the world were you?
- Mike, darling!

180
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,451
- What happened?
- Just wait till I tell you.

181
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,202
The craziest thing...

182
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,289
- Who's the jane?
- His wife.

183
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:55,251
Well, what do you know?
She don't look Mexican either.

184
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,740
The key to this whole thing's
the dynamite.

185
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,742
The killer didn't just want
Linnekar dead.

186
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,328
He wanted him destroyed.
Annihilated.

187
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,289
Over here, Vargas.
We're going in the back way.

188
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,336
Sefior Vargas.

189
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,130
Sefior Vargas.

190
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,094
Yes?

191
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,740
Anything wrong, Vargas?

192
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,744
No, I just couldn't catch him.

193
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,251
I hardly knew her.

194
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,462
- Adair, come on.
- Yes, yes.

195
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,464
And I'm not finished with you yet. <i>I...</i>

196
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,426
- The show's over. I'm going home.
- No, no, ma'am.

197
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,177
Mr Adair,
as far as I could find out,

198
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,012
none of these people
even knew the murdered girl.

199
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,298
I have no time for that.
Let's talk to this young lady.

200
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,349
- Zita?
- Yeah.

201
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,809
I didn't know her.

202
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,186
She only joined this show
a few days ago.

203
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,772
Aw, we're wasting our time
around here.

204
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,190
I wouldn't say that!

205
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,817
Well, good night, my dear.

206
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,780
What happened
to Menzies and Vargas?

207
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,323
I don't know. They'll show up.

208
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,908
There may be
some more questions.

209
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,537
... a pianola.

210
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,206
Hank!
We, we go this way, you know?

211
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,710
Tana's still open for business?

212
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,417
I don't know what Quinlan thinks
she's got to do with it.

213
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,712
Tana? Maybe
she'll cook chilli for him.

214
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:48,216
Or, <i>er...</i> bring out the crystal ball.

215
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,068
We're closed.

216
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,665
You been cooking at this hour?

217
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,667
<i>Just cleaning up.-...</i>

218
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,754
Have you forgotten your old friend?

219
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,008
- I told you we were closed.
- I'm Hank Quinlan.

220
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,221
I didn't recognise you.

221
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,266
You should lay off those candy bars.

222
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,687
It's either the candy
or the hooch.

223
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,483
I must say, I wish it was your chili
I was getting fat on.

224
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,153
Anyway, you're sure looking good.

225
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,950
- You're a mess, honey.
- Yeah.

226
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,121
That pianola
sure brings back memories.

227
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,915
The customers go for it.

228
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,667
It's so old, it's new.

229
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,795
We got the television, too.

230
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,217
We run movies.

231
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,303
What can I offer you?

232
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,222
You haven't heard anything
about that bomb, have you?

233
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,518
That happened
on your side of the border.

234
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,771
In a place like this,
you hear things.

235
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,108
I heard the explosion.

236
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,444
Yeah.

237
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,530
Well, when this case is over,

238
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,784
I must come around some night,
sample some of your chili.

239
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,412
Better be careful.
It may be too hot for you.

240
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,208
- Hank!
- Yeah?

241
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,878
Looks like our friend Vargas
ran into some trouble.

242
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,464
- Where?
- In the alley behind the nightclub.

243
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,215
Yeah?

244
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,055
- What happened to Vargas?
- What happened?

245
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,556
- What was it, Al?
- Nothing.

246
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,099
- No?
- Al!

247
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,393
Certainly nothing to do
with this bombing affair.

248
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,103
Somebody threw acid at Vargas.

249
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,732
- It doesn't matter. He missed me.
- Well, who was it, Al?

250
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,193
- I don't know. He got away.
<i>- ...</i>

251
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,070
Maybe it's one of the Grandi kids.

252
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,822
What makes you so sure of that,
Captain?

253
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,241
- Intuition.
- Intuition?

254
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:23,913
Well, Vargas and these Keystone Cops
seem to be giving the Grandi family

255
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,540
quite a few headaches lately...
Yeah?

256
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,043
Does your intuition
also tell you about my wife?

257
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,169
Wife?

258
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,380
She was accosted in the street
a little while ago,

259
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,007
and led across to some dive
on your side of the border.

260
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:41,013
The Vargas family seems to be getting
into quite a lot of trouble tonight.

261
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,016
Can you describe this man?

262
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,268
- Well, the first one seems to have been...
- The first one.

263
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,772
- Young, good looking.
- So, there were two men?

264
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,982
- Not exactly.
- Not exactly?

265
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,151
Are you saying she was taken
to this dive by force?

266
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,238
Not by force, no.

267
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,408
One of the Grandis was there waiting.
"Short, fat, with a moustache."

268
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,660
That's Susan's description,
I haven't run into him.

269
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:03,786
What?

270
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,664
- They call him Uncle Joe... Grandi.
- That's right.

271
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,333
<i>- Go on.
- Well...</i>

272
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,712
What do you mean, "go on"?
I've told you what happened.

273
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,171
Aren't you going to do something?

274
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,340
If you're making a charge,
I've got to ask the complaint.

275
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,467
Or isn't that police
procedure in Mexico?

276
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,392
- Procedure?
- You say your wife was attacked.

277
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,680
- I did not say she was attacked.
- Would you say she was molested?

278
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,181
Not physically molested, no.

279
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,851
- Was obscene language used?
- I don't think so!

280
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:29,979
Well, how do you explain the fact
that your wife allowed herself

281
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,273
- to be picked up by this good-look...
- She was not picked up.

282
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,400
Now, Hank, I think we're getting off
on the wrong tack.

283
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,569
Then this good-looking young man
was a 'friend' of hers?

284
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:37,737
Obviously not.

285
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,156
You wouldn't call that
getting picked up in the street?

286
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,366
Now, now,
we mustn't forget, must we

287
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,952
that Mr Vargas
is not on the witness stand.

288
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,913
Hank's a born lawyer, you know?

289
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,208
Lawyer. I'm no lawyer.
All a lawyer cares about is the law!

290
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,044
Captain, you are a policeman,
aren't you?

291
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,798
Aren't you?
You don't seem very fond of the job.

292
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,384
There are plenty of soldiers
who don't like war.

293
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,386
It's a dirty job enforcing the law,

294
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,305
but it's what we're supposed
to be doing, isn't it?

295
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,307
I don't know about you,

296
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,893
but when a murderer's loose,
I'm supposed to catch him.

297
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,316
Well, Pete,
let's get back to civilisation.

298
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,996
Let's go, Hank. It's almost dawn.
You gotta get some rest.

299
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,916
No chance of that, partner.

300
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,919
We got a big day ahead of us.

301
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,425
See any better this way?

302
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,269
You can turn it off now, buster.
You're wasting your batteries.

303
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,740
Susie... what are you doing here
in the dark?

304
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,660
There isn't any shade
on the window.

305
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,914
Well, can we turn the light on now?

306
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,332
No, we can't.

307
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,378
- Why not?
- Because there isn't any bulb anymore.

308
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,631
Susie!

309
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,346
Risto!

310
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:10,723
Risto!

311
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,309
Uncle Joe is plenty mad.
He wants to talk to you.

312
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,687
Risto. Risto, come back here.

313
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,445
Sal, grab him! Stop him!

314
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,779
Grab him, Sal!

315
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,575
Who told you
to throw acid at Vargas?

316
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,577
Stop him!

317
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,250
Who told you
to throw acid at Vargas??

318
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,463
Who's the boss of this family?

319
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,256
- Who is the boss?
- My old man.

320
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,468
Yeah, Vic, sure.
But he's in the pen!

321
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,970
Until he gets out,
who's running this outfit?

322
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,348
- Stop it, will ya?
- Who's in charge?

323
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,016
All right, you.

324
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,811
What a set-up to work with.

325
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,189
One brother in jail,
two others dead!

326
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:03,901
And nobody left to carry on the business
but a bunch of nephews!

327
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,569
- Listen, Uncle...
- Don't do that!

328
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,031
- You lost your rug, Uncle Joe. The rug.
- Half of you too wet behind the ears.

329
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,992
This isn't the real Mexico.
You know that!

330
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,955
All border towns bring out
the worst in a country.

331
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,833
I can just imagine your mother's face
if she could see our honeymoon hotel.

332
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,251
- Sefior Vargas!
<i>- Un</i> momenta.

333
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,837
Does this mean you're taking
that early plane back to Mexico City?

334
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,297
Te/éfono/

335
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:26,423
<i>Teléfono...</i>

336
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,134
Because it doesn't leave
for another two hours yet.

337
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,473
All I can say is, if you are taking
that plane, I'm very glad.

338
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,017
I'm very glad you're very glad.

339
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,020
S/f

340
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:46,193
Who told you to start this funny stuff
with the acid?

341
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,779
Who told you?

342
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,424
I just wanted to give that wife of his

343
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,241
something to think about
on the honeymoon.

344
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,118
She's going to get plenty.
Don't you worry.

345
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,163
- Here, you lost your rug.
- She's gonna... What?

346
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,205
You lost your rug.

347
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,625
My old man is in no shape for the pen.
If they give him ten, he dies.

348
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,629
Yeah? And if Vargas gets hurt,
what happens?

349
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,550
My brother Vic
is just as good as convicted.

350
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,760
- You leave Vargas to me!
- Uncle Joe. Uncle Joe.

351
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,137
What?

352
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:26,108
Sal! This, take it to her.

353
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:38,454
I don't want any more postcards.

354
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,878
I don't speak any Spanish.
What is it? What do you want?

355
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,380
I don't know. I was told
to put this in your hands.

356
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,106
- Susie, that was the police.
- Mike, look <i>at...</i>

357
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,734
Quinlan has a lead.
I'm sorry, I have to meet him.

358
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,986
Now, you must tell me
what you want to do.

359
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:16,033
If you are going to Mexico City,
I have time to take you to the airport.

360
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,619
Perhaps that would be best,
just for a few days.

361
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,745
I don't think so.

362
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,499
- Butjust a minute ago, you...
- A minute ago I said a lot of things.

363
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,919
But now I think the best thing
is to stick close to my husband. OK?

364
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,589
Susie!

365
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,555
- So, Mike, I'm coming with you.
- Corning with me?

366
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,934
But I have to see Quinlan
at the American police station.

367
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,478
- I'll wait at the motel.
- What motel?

368
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,856
Well, there must be one somewhere
on the American side of the border.

369
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,733
The American side of the border.

370
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,694
Well, I'll be safe there
and you won't have to worry about me.

371
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,739
Did I say the wrong thing again?

372
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,577
No, I suppose it would be nice
for a man in my place

373
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,289
to be able to think he could look after
his own wife in his own country.

374
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:08,168
Mike, if I go to the American motel,
it's just for comfort.

375
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,504
- Sure, sure.
- Not for safety.

376
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,049
Whatever you say, <i>mi v/'da.</i>

377
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,806
'...wealthy contractor,
Rudolph Linnekar

378
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:24,810
'has definitely been identified
with the blonde nightclub dancer

379
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,605
'killed in the explosion a few yards
this side of the Mexican border.'

380
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:34,069
We're gonna get you
where it really hurts.

381
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,113
And without laying a hand on him.

382
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,203
He's got a reputation.

383
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,874
He's got a young bride.
He's gonna leave this town

384
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,794
wishing he and that wife of his
had never been born.

385
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,222
Don't you see, darling,

386
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:07,186
if the bomb was planted in Mexico,
and the accused is Mexican,

387
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,439
what a scandal this could turn into?
Internationally?

388
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:13,817
Might be kind of rough
on the tourist trade.

389
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,112
Susie, one of the longest borders
on earth

390
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:20,449
is right here
between your country and mine.

391
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:21,825
It's an open border,

392
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,538
fourteen hundred miles
without a single machine gun in place.

393
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,125
Now, I suppose that all sounds
very corny to you.

394
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,756
I could love being corny
if my husband would only cooperate.

395
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,133
Hey, Susie.

396
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,553
<i>Well...</i>

397
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,372
<i>Vargas?</i>

398
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,539
Hello there, Schwartz.

399
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,625
Quinlan's onto something new.
Corning with us?

400
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,919
I have first to drop my wife
at the motel.

401
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,047
Captain Quinlan wants you to go with him.
I'll drop your wife at the motel.

402
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,757
- Really, <i>l...</i>
- No trouble at all, ma'am.

403
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,259
Aren't you going to drive me?

404
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,427
I'll phone you, darling.
What's the name of that motel?

405
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,388
- The Mirador.
- Quinlan's in kind of a hurry, Vargas.

406
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,598
- Don't bother to phone.
- Try to get some sleep, Susie.

407
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,643
That Mirador's mighty hard to find,

408
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,312
with the new highway branching
off the way it does.

409
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,939
Hey!

410
00:29:34,064 --> 00:29:35,983
- That's all right. I can find the way.
- Gee, I for...

411
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,653
His cane!
I forgot to give him his cane.

412
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,322
He really needs it
for that game leg of his.

413
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,824
They ever tell you
how he got it?

414
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,951
- What, cane?
- No, his bad leg.

415
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:49,079
- Who're you talking about?
- Captain Quinlan!

416
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:54,293
He got it in a gunfight, Mrs Vargas,
that's how.

417
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,462
He was wounded stopping a bullet
that was meant for me.

418
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,175
I reckon the bravest thing
Hank ever did was to give up drink.

419
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,428
He used to be a terrible lush,
you know.

420
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,931
But look at him now.
No sleep, still at it.

421
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,349
Say, he never gives up.

422
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,631
What's wrong?

423
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,301
What are you following us for?
Get out of the car.

424
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:47,387
What? A man can't take a ride
in his own car? What's the big idea?

425
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,764
You'll find out! Come on!

426
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,974
Don't push me.
Keep your hands off me.

427
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,977
Wake up, Mrs Vargas.
We're here. This is it.

428
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,980
This can't be it.

429
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,566
It's all the motel
we got this side of town, ma'am.

430
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,443
The others are all
on the new highway,

431
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,529
and most of them
are closed up till the season starts.

432
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,742
- No.
- Yeah! Now listen, Sergeant,

433
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,161
How long are you gonna hold me here?
I haven't done nothing...

434
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,830
Shut up! Mrs Vargas,
can you identify this man?

435
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,291
Of course I can identify him.
That's Grandi.

436
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,936
- I know.
- I'm a member of the family.

437
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,629
Sure, but nobody
has laid a hand on her. Right?

438
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,756
Shut up! Get in the car!

439
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,218
- What about my car?
- You can leave it here.

440
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,552
Where? Here?

441
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,679
In the middle of nowhere?

442
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,807
- You're coming with me!
- On what charge?

443
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,768
I don't know yet.
That's for Captain Quinlan to decide.

444
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,229
Well, what was Grandi doing
way out here?

445
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:40,857
- He was following us in his car.
- Just driving along.

446
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,068
Well. Where are my bags?

447
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,821
We've already put them
by your cabin, Mrs Vargas. There it is.

448
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,614
The last one. Number seven.

449
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,951
If you should want to change,
just phone the man at the desk.

450
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:55,956
Off-season like this, I reckon
you're about the only one staying here.

451
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:52,804
Er, I turned the music on up for you
up at the office.

452
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,226
<i>Urn, I...</i>

453
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:05,525
I turned the music on up for you at the...
I thought you'd like it.

454
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,321
Not just now. It's past seven,
and I haven't been to bed yet.

455
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,780
Bed?

456
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,036
Well, you can get into it now.
I brought the sheets.

457
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,955
If they think I'm gonna help make it,
they got another think comin'!

458
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,417
I'm not gonna be
a party <i>to...</i> nothin'.

459
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,628
I'm the night, <i>er...</i>

460
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:26,796
<i>It...</i> it's day already.

461
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,382
I'm the night man.

462
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,676
Can't the day man
help me make the bed?

463
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,471
There ain't no day man.

464
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,517
He's supposed to be here
at six o'clock this morning,

465
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:42,229
and now they phoned me
and they tell me he ain't coming at all.

466
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:45,232
They're sending
a new man... new man.

467
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:48,652
If they think I'm gonna stay here
and wait for him, they got another think...

468
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,779
Well, won't you
help me make the bed?

469
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:53,865
Bed?

470
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,617
Hey, wait a minute.

471
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,831
That friend of yours,
Mr Grandi, <i>he...</i>

472
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,167
he ain't gonna leave you here
for long.

473
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,711
He is not my friend.

474
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,966
He brought you here
in that car, didn't he?

475
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:14,135
No, he didn't. As a matter of fact,
he's under arrest.

476
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:18,723
Under arrest? Mr Grandi?

477
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,767
Yes, he is.

478
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,528
Hold that second charge!

479
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:33,488
Stop that car!

480
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,616
Hold that car! Stop! Stop!
Hold it!

481
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:48,086
Hey, there was a complaint
about some stolen dynamite out here.

482
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:49,963
You fired anybody lately?

483
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,965
I figured you'd be asking about that.

484
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,758
Yeah, a boy named Sanchez?

485
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,846
Sure. He's been playing around
with the boss's daughter.

486
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:00,640
Say, Captain. I just recognised
somebody over there at the blaster.

487
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,933
With the big ears? Yeah.

488
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,060
Our office prosecuted that guy
for voluntary manslaughter.

489
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,188
Get him over here.
That's Eddie Farnum. Got five to ten.

490
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,984
You have to get out of here.
We're gonna blast again.

491
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,987
- How long you been out?
- Three months.

492
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,406
- Quick parole.
- Who got you this job?

493
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,117
- My lawyer, Howard Frantz.
- Grandi's lawyer.

494
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,785
'Come in, car ten.

495
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,330
'Suspect now in custody
at Five-O-Three lnnes Place.'

496
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,832
- Well, this is it.
- Suspect?

497
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,376
That the one you been talking about?
This Sanchez?

498
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,128
They've located him.
Right, Captain?

499
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,464
Yeah, Marcia Linnekar's apartment.
Come on.

500
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,591
Stand still. We're gonna blast.

501
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,097
What's wrong, Farnum?
You short of dynamite?

502
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,451
Captain, have you anything definite
on this boy Sanchez?

503
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,746
Not yet.
I'm just going on my intuition.

504
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,207
Hey, I think this car
belongs to Howard Frantz.

505
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,667
- Yeah?
- You remember him.

506
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,461
He was that slick lawyer
that got Farnum a parole.

507
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:14,589
Yeah, he was
Rudy Linnekar's attorney, too.

508
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,717
- Isn't that Quinlan?
- Quinlan?

509
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,387
It figured we'd have
Hank Quinlan to deal with.

510
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,712
- You finished packing?
- Yeah.

511
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,056
I heard about that guy.

512
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,184
Say nothing, my dear. Leave
everything to me. Let's get your bag.

513
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,914
Remember, I'll do all the talking.

514
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,125
How do we begin?

515
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,544
Do we play around first
with a few nasty questions?

516
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,337
Or does he get out
the rubber hose right away?

517
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,588
Take it easy.

518
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,343
Va rgas!

519
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,137
Yes, Captain.

520
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,932
I got my orders, Vargas.

521
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,935
I'm supposed to extend you
every courtesy.

522
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,480
That don't mean you...
you do the interrogating.

523
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,400
I know, Captain.
That's what I told Sanchez.

524
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,360
You're Ed Hansen?

525
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,405
- That's right, Captain Quinlan.
- Run out and get me some coffee, Ed.

526
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,949
How 'bout you. Miss Linnekar?
Marcia, isn't it?

527
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,326
- Want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

528
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,664
I really need it.
I'm an old man, Marcia.

529
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,250
I go a whole night
without sleep, I feel it.

530
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,754
Of course,
it was a lot worse for you.

531
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,258
Terrible thing
what happened to your dad.

532
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,344
Have you been living here
for some time, Marcia? How long?

533
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,888
- Four months.
- Marcia!

534
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,773
You have a little quarrel
with your dad?

535
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,308
Perhaps I should introduce myself.

536
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,268
- I'm Miss Linnekar's attorney.
- I know who you are.

537
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,479
- I'm Howard Frantz.
- Yes, Mr Frantz.

538
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,064
I'm Manolo Sanchez.
And I haven't got any attorney!

539
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,650
You two been sharing
this apartment?

540
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:01,488
I must explain. On my advice,
my client is moving elsewhere.

541
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,406
Well, that means
she has been living with this man.

542
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:07,035
She will hold herself available
for your later questionings.

543
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,079
- I will be present, of course.
- Of course.

544
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,499
Marcia, where was
your friend Sanchez last night?

545
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,919
Later, Captain, later.
After she's rested.

546
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,253
Come, my dear.

547
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:21,257
Casey, would you take a look
in the desk there?

548
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,218
Might see some letters
or somethin'.

549
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,637
That is, unless you've already
looked the place over.

550
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,598
We know better than that, Captain.
We were waiting for you.

551
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,231
I don't speak Mexican.

552
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:44,364
Let's keep it in English, Vargas.

553
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,283
It's all right with me.

554
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,328
I'm sure he's just as unpleasant
in any language.

555
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,830
Unpleasant? Strange!

556
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:54,541
I've been told I have
a very winning personality.

557
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,252
The very best shoe clerk
the store ever had.

558
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,255
Well, you weren't working as a
shoe clerk out on that construction crew.

559
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,757
- Stick around, Vargas.
- I intend to.

560
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,636
In English!
I don't like to repeat myself.

561
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,392
I merely asked him
if I could use his telephone.

562
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,059
English.

563
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,813
Translation - the telephone
is in the bedroom, Senor.

564
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,482
That's all he said.

565
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:25,405
Also, he told me he thinks
he's in for some sort of third degree.

566
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,949
I assured him
he had nothing to worry about.

567
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,910
Casey, go in with Vargas.

568
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,746
Maybe he don't know
how to use an American telephone.

569
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,541
I think I ran onto something here,
Captain. Some love letters.

570
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,459
You can read them
in the bedroom.

571
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,170
I don't want to leave
that Vargas guy alone.

572
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,715
- OK.
- Save the good stuff for me.

573
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,134
- Now, in English.
- What do you want to know?

574
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,303
Everything, the works.
Let's start with the shoe store.

575
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,188
- Want me to call the motel, Vargas?
- Later.

576
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:53,057
That's how you met Linnekar's
daughter, in the shoe store?

577
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,269
Yeah, selling her shoes.
And I've been at her feet ever since.

578
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,834
Then the construction job.

579
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,608
You stayed just long enough on that one
to get your hands on some dynamite.

580
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:02,734
What are you scared of, boy?

581
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:06,112
I'd only slap you again
if you got hysterical again.

582
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,655
It wouldn't be anything brutal.

583
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,034
Why, even back in the old days,
we never tried to hurt people in the face.

584
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,077
It marks 'em up.
We gave it to 'em like this.

585
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,498
The boy's getting a rough deal.

586
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,293
He could even be innocent,
you know?

587
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,836
Intuition?

588
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:25,506
Why not? Quinlan doesn't have
a monopoly on hunches.

589
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,675
Well, who do you like
for the killer?

590
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,553
Too early to tell.
Urn, that ex-convict.

591
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:32,680
You mean
out on that highway job?

592
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,390
- Farnum.
- Maybe.

593
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,726
Wait a minute.
Some dynamite was stolen.

594
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,854
Yeah, and that construction crew's
working for Linnekar.

595
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,230
Amigo, I think
you're onto something.

596
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,817
Yes, it's quite an apartment...
for a shoe clerk.

597
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,363
- Who pays for it? Marcia?
- What if she does?

598
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:50,281
How long
has this been going on?

599
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,742
Ever since her father had me fired
from the last job, if you want to know.

600
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,871
Well, naturally he objected to having
a Mexican shoe clerk for a son-in-law.

601
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,457
So, naturally, you had to put him
out of the way!

602
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,542
Naturally!

603
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,711
Now, just because
he speaks a little guilty,

604
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,713
that don't make him innocent,
you know?

605
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,298
You can show motive, yes.

606
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,133
But don't you need
a bit more than that?

607
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,720
We'll get it.
There's my coffee.

608
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,683
Didn't you bring me
any doughnuts or sweet rolls?

609
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,851
You'll have to put him
on the scene of the crime.

610
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,937
- We will.
- You've got to have some evidence.

611
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,147
We'll get it. We'll... Well?

612
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,392
Well, you didn't ask me
to get any doughnuts, Captain.

613
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,901
Where are you going?

614
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,612
This is not my case, Captain.

615
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,781
What finally convinced you of that?

616
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:35,159
This is not my country, that's all.
I'm not convinced.

617
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,204
Well, ain't that a shame.

618
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,708
- Is there another phone near here?
- Right across the street.

619
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,683
Excuse me, madam.
Could I use your telephone, please?

620
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,977
Right in front of you.

621
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,062
Do you have a phone book?

622
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,523
I'm blind, mister.
You'll have to ask for Information.

623
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,734
I'm sorry.

624
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:17,702
Hello, I'd like the telephone number
of the Mirador Motel.

625
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,947
- What is this place you're taking me to?
- Get going!

626
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,498
- Now listen, this is ridiculous.
- Now, go on!

627
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,001
- Who's this?
- Who are you? Don't push.

628
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,462
- Where's Captain Quinlan?
- He's in there making a search.

629
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:29,672
- What am I doing in here?
- Hank.

630
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,008
What's the idea,
barging in on me like this?

631
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,426
- I'm sorry, Hank.
- Who you got in here?

632
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,762
- I forgot to give you your cane.
- All right, sit down.

633
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,305
Queer thing, Hank.

634
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,141
When I was taking Mrs Vargas
to the motel,

635
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,517
I picked this guy on the way.

636
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,728
I know him. It's Uncle Joe Grandi.

637
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,188
Why'd you bring him in here?

638
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:48,691
For some crazy reason,
he was following me in his car.

639
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,651
- He was tailing you?
- Yeah.

640
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,283
Why would I be following a cop?
He's an idiot.

641
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,286
Maybe because you thought
he was a Mexican cop.

642
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,498
Because you thought he was Vargas.
He was driving Vargas's car.

643
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,416
Right?

644
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,711
So, you're right. So I thought
I was following Vargas. So what?

645
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,588
Sit down.

646
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,799
- It's a free country.
- Shut up.

647
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,228
'Is this the Mirador Motel?
I'm trying to...'

648
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,688
Yes, it's the Mirador Motel,
and it's me.

649
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:31,984
Darling. The news is bad.

650
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,113
Quinlan is about to arrest
that boy, Sanchez, and...

651
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,615
Mike,
is that why you called?

652
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,534
To tell me
somebody's been arrested?

653
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,621
No, that's not really
why I called. <i>It...</i>

654
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:49,168
It's to tell you how sorry I am
about all this.

655
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,629
'How very, very much I love you.

656
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,674
'Susie?'

657
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,593
I'm still here,
my own darling Miguel.

658
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,513
I thought
maybe you'd fallen asleep.

659
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,643
I was just listening to you breathe.
It's a lovely sound...

660
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,522
But I am sleepy.

661
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,776
Of course you are.

662
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,989
Well then, I'll be calling you back later.
Goodbye for now.

663
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,574
Mike?

664
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,416
- Hello.
- 'Yes?'

665
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,544
I just wanted to tell you
I'm awfully tired.

666
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:34,922
Excuse me.
This is Mrs Vargas talking.

667
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,593
'I know. It couldn't be anybody else.'

668
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:42,513
'You're the only guest we got here
just now... in the whole place.'

669
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:47,310
Well, as I started to tell you,
there's no sign to put up outside the door,

670
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:51,731
and I just wanted to make sure
I wouldn't be disturbed.

671
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,150
That is if you're the one
who's in charge.

672
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:58,779
Don't you worry, Mrs Vargas.
I'm the one who's in charge here.

673
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:02,658
Nobody's going to get through to you
unless I say so.

674
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:06,120
Vargas. Sergeant Menzies
wanted me to give you this.

675
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,955
- Your car keys.
- Thanks.

676
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,214
Well, I was beginning to think
we'd lost you for good.

677
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,382
I had a phone call to make.

678
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,594
Engfishl

679
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,512
They've got me measured
for the fall guy.

680
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:24,639
Now, just a minute.

681
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:27,850
Sure, I'm the fortune hunter
who hypnotised Marcia,

682
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,353
who made her kill her father
for his money.

683
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,438
Boy, if I had that kind of power,

684
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,440
I wouldn't be where I am today.
Believe me.

685
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,359
You mean you don't care
about the money?

686
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,110
Why should I lie?

687
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,363
If it hadn't been for the money,
I wouldn't have given her a tumble.

688
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,574
But I told her that right at the beginning.
But still she wanted...

689
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,618
Why bother?
You wouldn't believe it.

690
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,078
Try me.

691
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,288
I'm a good listener.

692
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:54,377
Well, instead of the man chasing the girl,
suppose she was the one.

693
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,504
Suppose she asked him
to marry her.

694
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,130
What should he do?
Draw himself up and say,

695
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,300
"No, my dear. You and I could never be
happy together because of your money"?

696
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,220
- What would you do, Vargas?
- The question is, what did you do?

697
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,472
Yeah, what did you do, boy?

698
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,397
- Well, you know what I did, Captain.
- Yeah, I know. I was asking you.

699
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,519
- Marcia and I made a bomb.
- That's right. You made a bomb.

700
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:15,314
- And we blew up her father, of course!
- At last you're admitting it.

701
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,235
Don't you see you don't help yourself
by treating this as a joke?

702
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,195
Are you finished?

703
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,823
Anything more
you want to say, Vargas?

704
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:24,949
- No, Captain.
- Good.

705
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,492
- Pete, since you're here...
- Yes, Hank.

706
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,327
<i>L</i> wish you'd search the place.

707
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,330
I'm too tired to go on with it.

708
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,124
Sanchez's desk
has been looked into.

709
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:36,335
- Take the bedroom, then the bathroom.
- OK, Hank.

710
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,255
I haven't been very thorough.

711
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,381
- Now, listen.
- Yeah.

712
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,174
How long do I have to sit here?

713
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,885
I wasn't breaking no laws.
I was just...

714
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,889
- I don't even know these people.
- You know Vargas, don't you?

715
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:52,101
- Who's this?
- Uncle Joe Grandi. Another Grandi.

716
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,937
Yeah, you nabbed his brother
on a narcotics rap.

717
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,189
- I don't know this Grandi.
- Yeah?

718
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,026
- I got nothing to do with you, Varg...
- Shut up.

719
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:01,944
I'm an American citizen.

720
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,114
Now listen, Vic was arrested
in Mexico City, Captain.

721
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,616
Vargas is gonna testify
at his trial Thursday.

722
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,910
It's got absolutely
nothing to do with...

723
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,872
You just try any rough stuff,
Uncle Joe, and you'll find out.

724
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,583
He's a big shot
in the Mexican government. Listen...

725
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,587
Anybody lays a hand on Mr Vargas
between now and Thursday,

726
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:23,174
and my brother Vic
is just as good as convicted.

727
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:24,759
- Hank?
- Yeah?

728
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,344
- What is it, Pete?
- I found it!

729
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:30,056
- Found what, partner?
- Come here and look!

730
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,141
I don't even know this Sanchez.

731
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,186
All right, boy.
Boy, you come in here!

732
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:38,439
Now, in English, just how much dynamite
was it you stole?

733
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,025
What good would it be to tell you
that I've never seen any dynamite?

734
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:44,362
Poor Rudy Linnekar. He did all he could
to keep you away from his daughter.

735
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:47,948
But she stands to inherit a million bucks,
so naturally you just moved in here.

736
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:51,577
- Marcia and I were married. Secretly!
- A million bucks. No secret about that.

737
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,662
And you got scared
he'd change his will.

738
00:47:53,746 --> 00:47:56,332
- Why don't you let up for a minute?
- So you got yourself this highway job...

739
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,417
You broke into the explosives bin
and stole it.

740
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,753
- That's a lie!
- You stole ten sticks of dynamite!

741
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,505
No, no!

742
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,217
Well, Hank has done it again.
He's nailed his man.

743
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:07,510
Thanks to you, partner.

744
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:11,472
Me? Say, if that dynamite had been
a snake there in the bathroom,

745
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,807
it would have bit me.

746
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:15,434
I told Chief Gould
that I'd keep you informed, Vargas.

747
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,062
So, I'm doing it. This is it.
We've broken the case.

748
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,399
Rudy Linnekar was blown up
with eight sticks of dynamite.

749
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,151
And Sanchez stole ten,
that leaves two.

750
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,903
And we found them both.

751
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,781
You heard that, boy.
We found the dynamite.

752
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,785
- That's impossible.
- Well, we found two sticks.

753
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,745
- Black Fox. The identical brand.
- It's the right brand.

754
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,705
- Where did you find this?
- Right here in your love nest.

755
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,671
- Where?
- Where you had it stashed, of course.

756
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,747
What are you trying to do?

757
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,914
We're trying to strap you
to the electric chair, boy.

758
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,964
We don't like it when innocent people
are blown to jelly in our town!

759
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,426
Yes. An old lady on Main Street
last night picked up a shoe.

760
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,594
And the shoe had a foot in it.

761
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,388
We're gonna make you pay
for that mess.

762
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:54,153
- They're trying to railroad me!
- Yeah...

763
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,976
I don't know why.
I never stole any dynamite.

764
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:00,438
You'll have to stop him yourself.

765
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:03,899
From now on, he can talk Hindu
for all the good it'll do him.

766
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,652
He swears on his mother's grave

767
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,864
that there has never been
any dynamite in this apartment.

768
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,490
Sure, sure.

769
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,785
- Take him in. Book him.
- Let's go.

770
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,456
You say you found this dynamite
in the bathroom?

771
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,021
Pete found it.
Show him the dynamite.

772
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,083
Right here.

773
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,461
Can't you do something
to help me?

774
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,715
What are you
scared of, partner?

775
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,344
That stuff isn't nearly as easy
to blow up as people seem to think.

776
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,888
It doesn't go off quite that easy.

777
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:37,224
- You found the dynamite in this box?
- Dynamite?

778
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:42,229
Yeah. Pete found it.
We told you that.

779
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,731
- <i>Captain...
- Yeah?</i>

780
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:50,112
I looked in that box... just now.
There wasn't anything there.

781
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,950
I know how you feel.

782
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,203
- Do you?
- Sure, I do.

783
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,372
You people are touchy.

784
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:05,419
It's only human you'd want to come to
the defence of your fellow countryman.

785
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,552
<i>Vargas?</i>

786
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,804
- Vargas, don't worry.
- Why should I worry?

787
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,140
You go right ahead
and say anything you want to.

788
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,559
Folks'll bear
your natural prejudice in mind.

789
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,187
I saw that shoebox
ten minutes ago, Captain.

790
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,231
Yeah? Well, maybe
you didn't notice.

791
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,149
I knocked it over
on the bathroom floor.

792
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,693
I couldn't very well have failed
to notice two sticks of dynamite.

793
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,946
- Tell any story you want to, Vargas!
- The shoebox was empty!

794
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,697
Go on saying it's empty!
Folks'll understand.

795
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,699
I'm saying more than that,
Captain.

796
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,412
You framed that boy.
Framed him!

797
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,631
What's the matter with him, Hank?
Is he crazy?

798
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,466
Yeah, that must be it. Crazy.

799
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,052
Hank, what are we gonna do
with this Grandi guy? Take him in?

800
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,178
<i>Grant“?</i>

801
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,473
I think you ought to realise that if a man of
Vargas's position is willing to testify...

802
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,393
Who are you working for?
The Mexican government?

803
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,603
I'm working
for the District Attorney.

804
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:08,566
Well, listen! I got a position in this
town, a reputation. Who's Vargas?

805
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,943
Vargas is
kind of important, too, Hank.

806
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,908
Somebody's gonna have to give in
on this thing.

807
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,197
Well, either that
or somebody's gonna be ruined.

808
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,950
- Captain Quinlan.
- What do you want?

809
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:21,787
Schwartz, you saw
that shoebox in the bathroom.

810
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,539
You know it was empty.

811
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:28,586
Well, now, I didn't happen
to see it myself, but I believe you.

812
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:38,220
We are both after
the same exact thing, Captain.

813
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,932
If Vargas goes on like this, shooting
his face off like he was just now...

814
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,184
Move along.
Stop making trouble, Grandi.

815
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,895
Trouble? Who's the one
who is making trouble?

816
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,981
Vargas. Sure!

817
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,317
For my brother Vic in Mexico City.
For you here.

818
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,068
Go peddle your papers,
Uncle Joe.

819
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,945
Why, you just said it yourself.

820
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,198
Somebody's reputation
has got to be ruined.

821
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,034
Why shouldn't it be Vargas's?

822
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,757
- What are you waiting for?
- Nothing, <i>I...</i>

823
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,290
- Well, we got work to do.
- OK, Hank, OK.

824
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,835
- Well, what do you want?
- Nothing, Captain.

825
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,631
- Nothing that you don't want, too.
- Go on, spit it out, then.

826
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,842
Captain, we cannot
stand out here in the street.

827
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,429
Why don't we go somewhere
nice and private?

828
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,307
Where we can sit down
and have a drink?

829
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,310
I don't drink.

830
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,281
- Look, Schwartz...
- Al.

831
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:22,741
Al.

832
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,703
We must show where Quinlan himself
got the dynamite.

833
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:29,164
If you're really with me on this,
we have still to get some proof.

834
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,042
- We've got your word.
- Let's do better than that.

835
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,796
In your country also, when explosives
are purchased, some record is kept, no?

836
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,424
Sure. And we're going
to the right place to look it up.

837
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,592
Hey, how about Quinlan's ranch?

838
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:43,220
- Where is that?
- Just outside town.

839
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,849
While you're looking up the
dynamite records, I might go out there.

840
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:49,518
Al, there is one thing
that worries me, still.

841
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,644
What's that?

842
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:55,315
I could be wrong about this.
And that would be very bad for you.

843
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:58,026
Let's see
if you're wrong first, amigo.

844
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:25,179
I wondered if you could
turn that music off.

845
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,059
Would it be possible to ask
those people next door to move?

846
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,020
Just to another cabin?

847
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,189
You see, I'm still trying
to get some sleep.

848
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:37,691
Where would you like me
to take you, doll?

849
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,741
- You got the stuff?
- Here.

850
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:51,663
I brought this.
Some of the other guys got more.

851
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,707
And the hypo?

852
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,628
Hi.

853
00:54:57,753 --> 00:54:59,379
What are you doing here?

854
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,298
<i>- Turn it down.
- I...</i>

855
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,428
I-I'm the night man.

856
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,765
Yeah? Well you're a little early,
ain't you?

857
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:13,060
Well, I thought I'd better come back,
see if the new...

858
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:24,196
Which... one of you
is the new day man?

859
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,116
<i>- Beat it.
- I...</i>

860
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:34,414
It's a mile and a half
down to the highway.

861
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:38,961
I think I'd better stay.

862
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,922
Go in the kitchen
and get yourself something to eat.

863
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,139
- I brought my lunch.
- Eat it now.

864
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,394
Eat it now? Yes.

865
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,110
I know you.
You're the Grandi boys.

866
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,613
Your Uncle Joe know you're here?

867
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,156
Who could that be?

868
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,618
Take it easy, Pretty Boy.
What're you in such a sweat about?

869
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,620
It's a tough rap
to get caught with this stuff.

870
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,831
It's only that Vargas dame again,

871
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:21,044
- Yes, ma'am.
- 'Get me State one-two-one-two.'

872
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,215
Very good, ma'am.
State one-two-one-two.

873
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:31,513
Hey! Hey!
That's the police department!

874
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,974
- Yeah?
- It's the police, all right.

875
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,727
- What do we do now?
- We do nothing.

876
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,646
We relax
and have ourselves a ball,

877
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,235
I'm very sorry, Mrs Vargas,

878
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,322
but the telephone
is temporarily out of service.

879
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,782
I'll call you just as soon
as it's repaired.

880
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,453
Better call Uncle Joe.

881
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:10,844
So that is our
little arrangement, see?

882
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:16,391
A real sweet set-up. And all the help
we need from the law...

883
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:20,020
Listen, you knock somebody off...
I don't care who it is.

884
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,897
There won't be any
"little arrangement".

885
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,941
Not with Hank Quinlan.

886
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,109
- Joe, a message for you.
- Yeah.

887
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,278
Vargas can't hurt me.

888
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,905
Well, maybe not.

889
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:34,826
But maybe with our little deal,
we can hurt him.

890
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,745
I don't make deals.

891
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,211
Yeah? Why, sure, I'm all right.

892
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:47,089
No, no, no, look.
Just go ahead like I said.

893
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:49,614
- Don't worry. No matter what...
- Something wrong out there?

894
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:51,134
No, no. Nothing we can't fix.

895
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,220
We? Where do you get
that "we" stuff?

896
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:55,681
I haven't given you
any answer yet.

897
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:57,849
Listen to you.

898
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:01,144
You keep talking as though
this was some kind of a deal

899
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:04,356
where I ask you
to get me out of a rap.

900
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,359
No. That ain't it at all.

901
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,778
In this thing
we're partners, see?

902
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,532
- Shall we drink to that?
- I don't...

903
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,999
Juanito,
two more double bourbons.

904
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,464
Make 'em nice and big.

905
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,364
All I can say is,
this better be important.

906
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,490
It is.

907
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,118
I think we're out of our minds
to be here in Mexico at all.

908
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:01,079
- Well, Vargas, you sent for us.
- Mr Adair.

909
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:04,708
Gentlemen. Now, it isn't really true
that I sent for you.

910
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,433
- Mr Schwartz insisted that I myself...
- Let's get down to cases.

911
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,421
- You know Chief Gould.
- How do you do, sir?

912
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:10,922
Where's this so-called document?

913
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,488
- Perhaps we'd better go to my room.
- Yes, by all means, yes.

914
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,469
- In here, gentlemen.
- Go ahead.

915
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,345
No, no, no. I'll walk.

916
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:20,432
- OK.
- The lift is rather small, I'm afraid.

917
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,850
Chief Gould.

918
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,730
Just press the button
for the second floor.

919
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,440
I'll meet you there.

920
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:32,486
I still don't know why Vargas
couldn't come to my office.

921
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,281
He has practically cabinet status
with the Mexican government, you know.

922
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,075
Well, if he's so important...

923
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,118
He can't make a formal call
on either of you

924
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,661
without going through
his consulate

925
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:44,039
and putting the whole thing
on an international level.

926
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:46,750
Cut out all the fancy talk
and what does it boil down to?

927
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,475
This Mexican
is bringing criminal charges

928
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,880
against one of the most respected
police officers in the country.

929
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,840
And that's
what it boils down to!

930
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:57,761
Well, Vargas,
you must be pretty quick on your feet.

931
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,138
It's just that the lift is slow.
This way, gentlemen.

932
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,598
Thank you.

933
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,106
After you.

934
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,485
I have it right over here.

935
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:18,865
There.
While you're looking at it,

936
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,660
perhaps you'll excuse me
if I finish a call I've put in.

937
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,455
Where'd you get this?

938
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,415
From your Department of Records
about an hour ago.

939
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,585
- They'll let anybody in there.
- Well, it doesn't mean anything.

940
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,921
- That's your wife you're calling, isn't it?
- Yes.

941
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,548
- You know who owns the Mirador?
- No, <i>I...</i>

942
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:38,635
"June 18th.
Hills Hardware in Los Robles.

943
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,889
"17 sticks,
Black Fox brand, to H. Quinlan."

944
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:46,393
Quinlan needed dynamite for work
on his ranch - simple coincidence.

945
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,562
Mr Adair... Hello?

946
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:53,650
Yes?

947
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,986
Mirador? My name is Vargas.

948
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,446
I'd like to speak
with my wife, please.

949
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:02,117
'I'm very sorry, Mr Vargas,
but your wife left definite instructions.'

950
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,952
She's not to be disturbed.

951
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,667
'Honey.

952
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,003
'You, in the next room.'

953
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:15,589
What is it?

954
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,758
'Come to the wall,
so I can whisper.'

955
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:24,931
Yes?

956
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:29,853
'You know what the boys
are trying to do, don't you?

957
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,527
'They are trying to get in there.
They went to get the master key.

958
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,698
'You know what marijuana is,
don't you?'

959
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,620
<i>Yes...</i>

960
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,748
'You know what a Mary Jane is?

961
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,794
'You know what a mainliner is?'

962
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,008
I think so.

963
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,093
But what's that
got to do with me?

964
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:06,598
'You take it in the vein.'

965
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:10,936
You're trying to tell me
these boys are drugged?

966
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,812
- Is that why...
- 'Shh.'

967
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,816
Hey, you think they're ready
for that stuff yet?

968
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,779
Not yet, kid.

969
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:27,160
The fun is only beginning.

970
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,206
Hank, I've been looking for you
in every bar in town.

971
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:33,291
Yeah, I've been in half of 'em.

972
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,710
But only here on the wrong side
of the border.

973
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,797
I never drink
on my own beat, partner.

974
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:40,548
Bartender, give him
some black coffee, quick.

975
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,759
- I don't need black coffee.
- He's called a meeting, Hank.

976
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,928
- A meeting?
- Vargas, at his hotel.

977
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:48,265
- The motel?
- No, right here across the street.

978
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:51,893
- Well, I don't need any coffee. Not yet.
- Not yet?

979
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,479
This is a swell time
to be getting fried, I must say.

980
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:55,647
My job's over, Pete.

981
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,691
- You ought to be working on Sanchez.
- Listen, Hank...

982
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:58,900
We gotta break him.

983
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,569
Vargas is telling the Chief and the D.A.
that you planted that dynamite.

984
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:03,154
He was a fool.

985
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,156
They're taking him seriously.
They came to him.

986
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:08,034
No, I mean Sanchez.
Dynamite's no way to kill.

987
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,495
Did I ever tell you
the smart way to kill, Pete?

988
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,248
Sure, sure, strangling.

989
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,958
Clean, silent.

990
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:17,877
- You told me all that. Finish that coffee.
- That's how my wife died.

991
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:21,089
- I don't usually talk about my wife.
- Never when you're sober.

992
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,844
- She was strangled, Pete.
- I know, I know.

993
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,096
Binding cord. She was working
up at the packing plant,

994
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,432
so the killer had it right to hand.
Smart.

995
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:34,436
You don't leave fingerprints
on a piece of string.

996
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,271
Bartender, what do I owe you?

997
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:38,773
That half-breed done it, of course.
We all knew that.

998
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,734
But I was just a rookie cop.

999
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:42,235
Four seventy-five.

1000
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,989
I followed around after him,
eating my heart out...

1001
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,950
trying to catch him.

1002
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,745
But I never did.

1003
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,913
Then in some mudhole in Belgium,

1004
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:56,833
the Good Lord
clone the job for me, 1917.

1005
01:03:56,958 --> 01:04:00,545
Pete, that was the last killer
that ever got out of my hands.

1006
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,172
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

1007
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:06,092
To Sefior Vargas's meeting.
He wants to fight dirty? OK.

1008
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,720
That's the kind of fight
he's gonna get.

1009
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,889
- Perhaps...
- Perhaps what?

1010
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:13,391
Perhaps he honestly thinks
that Sanchez is guilty.

1011
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,560
- 'Course he does!
- There's no perhaps about it.

1012
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:19,397
- Hank Quinlan is an honest cop.
- There are all kinds of policemen, sir.

1013
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,484
I don't have to tell you that.
A few take bribes.

1014
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,069
Hank Quinlan
never took a dollar in his life.

1015
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:25,737
Most are honest, yes!

1016
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:30,283
But even some of the honest men
abuse their power in other ways.

1017
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:32,869
Come in, Hank.

1018
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,414
<i>Well, I...</i>

1019
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:39,959
don't know
whether I'm welcome or not.

1020
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:41,586
I want you to hear this.

1021
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,632
I've heard it already.

1022
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:50,095
Our friend Vargas has some very
special ideas about police procedure.

1023
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,472
He seems to think it don't matter
whether a killer's hanged or not,

1024
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,974
so long as we obey the fine print
in the rule books.

1025
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,268
Captain, I don't think a policeman
should work like a dog-catcher.

1026
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,146
- No?
- Putting criminals behind bars. No!

1027
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,733
In any free country, a policeman
is supposed to enforce the law.

1028
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,860
And the law protects the guilty,
as well as the innocent.

1029
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:10,156
- Our job is tough enough. We got...
- It's supposed to be. It has to be tough.

1030
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,784
A policeman's job is only easy
in a police state.

1031
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,953
That's the whole point, Captain.

1032
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,289
Who is the boss?
The cop or the law?

1033
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,834
- Where's your wife, Vargas?
- What are you?

1034
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:23,159
What do you mean? You know
where she is as well as I do.

1035
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:26,423
Sergeant Menzies drove her.
She's at the motel.

1036
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:29,884
And you're still here?

1037
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,011
Yes. I'm checking out now
and joining her.

1038
01:05:32,137 --> 01:05:34,264
Do you have a reason
for asking, Captain?

1039
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:37,142
No, I had no special reason. No.

1040
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:39,144
No, I just wondered.

1041
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,188
Well, what do you know?

1042
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:45,233
A mother pigeon and her nest.
Pigeon egg.

1043
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,277
Captain.

1044
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:49,404
You did buy 17 sticks
of dynamite, didn't you?

1045
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:52,949
You tell your story, Vargas.
I don't have to answer your questions.

1046
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,576
A hired hand
at your ranch says...

1047
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,078
- My ranch?
- <i>he</i> used about 15 sticks.

1048
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:03,626
You been spying out at my ranch?
A foreigner?

1049
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,711
Without my knowledge, Hank!
Without my permission!

1050
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,797
At your ranch, you used 15 sticks
of dynamite, Quinlan.

1051
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,009
That leaves two sticks missing, and
two sticks were found in that shoebox.

1052
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,428
He's just asking, Hank. Hank!

1053
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,097
What's that for?

1054
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:20,351
- It's for... it's for letting him ask.
- Hank, wait a minute!

1055
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:24,314
Thirty years. Thirty years
of pounding beats and riding cars.

1056
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:26,316
Thirty years
of dirt and crummy pay!

1057
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,818
Thirty years I gave my life
to this department!

1058
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,778
And you allow this foreigner
to accuse me!

1059
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:32,363
We were just giving you
a chance to answer!

1060
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:33,990
Answer?
Why do I have to answer him?

1061
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,409
No, sir.
I won't take back that badge

1062
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:40,079
until the people of this county
vote it back!

1063
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:42,624
Hank, will you listen a minute?

1064
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:46,711
I don't want to ever see that man in
headquarters for any reason at any time!

1065
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,338
- Now, you backed him <i>up...</i>
- Me?

1066
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:50,673
You stood by
while he impugned the integrity

1067
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:52,759
- of Captain Quinlan and Sgt. Menzies!
- I tried to stop him!

1068
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,094
Do you realise
what Vargas has done?

1069
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,388
He's smearing
hundreds of fine men.

1070
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:00,183
- Men ready to give their lives.
- Have you caused enough trouble?

1071
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:01,643
Are you satisfied?

1072
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,394
- I want you to apologise!
- To Quinlan?

1073
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,521
And to Chief Gould.

1074
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,147
Would you like me
to get down on my knees?

1075
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:08,399
If you have any decency,
you will, yes! You'll crawl!

1076
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:12,695
Mr Adair, I won't give you the chance
to test your authority in this matter.

1077
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:21,746
Al, have I still any credit
left with you?

1078
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:23,915
Some.

1079
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,545
Tell me, where can I find the records
of Quinlan's old cases?

1080
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,879
I'll show you.

1081
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:33,049
I'd like to get back to my wife.
I hope this won't take too long.

1082
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:34,926
Hank?

1083
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,678
You're not going without this.

1084
01:07:44,143 --> 01:07:47,730
Well, now I guess I can talk.

1085
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,568
- What do you mean, Hank?
- Well, all I wanted to tell you was,

1086
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:53,820
that I couldn't really say
in my own defence that...

1087
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:54,988
Go on, Hank.

1088
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,657
What do you really know
about this Vargas?

1089
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:01,536
Isn't he in charge of some kind of
clean-up here on this side of the border?

1090
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,163
- Narcotics mainly?
- Yeah. Narcotics.

1091
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,250
He's a drug addict.

1092
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:10,545
He's got that young wife of his
hooked, too.

1093
01:08:11,546 --> 01:08:15,758
But good. If I hadn't seen that
hypodermic myself...

1094
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:19,220
- Hypodermic? You saw it?
- I just said so, didn't I?

1095
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,097
I saw it.

1096
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:24,934
That's how come he happened to imagine
all those crazy things. It's typical.

1097
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:29,731
That's what that wife of his
was doing in that dive on skid row.

1098
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:32,859
Both a couple of junkies.
Of course, he's using the job...

1099
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,194
".85 a cover-up.

1100
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:39,282
You don't mean he's mixed up
in this dope racket himself?

1101
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:41,993
Hank, if this is just one
of your hunches...

1102
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,370
I don't ask you to believe it!
I can prove it!

1103
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,539
I know it isn't my department, but...

1104
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:52,629
I'd like to show you I'm not talking
out of the back of my neck.

1105
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,005
Just be careful?

1106
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,424
Chief, I'll be very careful.

1107
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:02,555
This takes guts, Al.
Standing up to your boss this way.

1108
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,558
After today, amigo,
you can do me a favour.

1109
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,810
- Help me look for an office.
- How's that?

1110
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:11,773
Hank Quinlan's famous intuition might
still turn out to be better than yours.

1111
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:16,319
If so, my intuition tells me
I'll be going back to private practice.

1112
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:20,948
- Here are the other names you want.
- Look, Al, I can finish this alone.

1113
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:22,950
Yes, and maybe you can't.

1114
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:26,496
Well, let me try, anyway.

1115
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:29,540
I have no right
to drag you further into this.

1116
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:30,917
Gonna do it alone?

1117
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:32,585
All you got to do
is solve the murder

1118
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,838
and also prove that the idol
of the police force is a fraud,

1119
01:09:36,964 --> 01:09:40,426
Amigo, you've got your work
really cut out for you.

1120
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:31,436
HeHo, Tana?
Is Captain Quinlan there?

1121
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,480
- Now, Sergeant.
- Tana!

1122
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,191
- Hey, Tana!
- I'll be right there.

1123
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,155
Now, what would Hank Quinlan
be doing here?

1124
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,741
'Used to be he'd hole up at your place
for two or three days

1125
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:46,617
'with a case of whiskey.'

1126
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:50,037
That was years ago.
Now he's on candy bars.

1127
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:51,622
Not tonight, he isn't.

1128
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,099
Let me stay. I want to watch.

1129
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,853
Hold her legs.

1130
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,483
No, no, let me go!

1131
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,653
Don't touch me!
Let me go! No!

1132
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:05,530
- No! No!
- Close the door!

1133
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,796
So, this is where you've been
all afternoon.

1134
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:26,717
How'd they let you in here?
A foreigner.

1135
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:30,847
The Hall of Records is open
to the public, Sergeant.

1136
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,348
What're you doing?

1137
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:35,768
- You'll find out tomorrow morning.
- I want to know now.

1138
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,568
What's all this?

1139
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:45,194
Records of every case

1140
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:48,364
where you or Quinlan
uncovered the principal evidence.

1141
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:51,534
In each case, as you'll notice,

1142
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:54,537
the defence denied
the existence of that evidence.

1143
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:58,040
What are you trying to do?
Wreck him?

1144
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,835
Him? What about you?

1145
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:05,631
Are you telling me you never planted
any evidence, Sergeant?

1146
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:08,467
Of course not.
Neither did Hank.

1147
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:11,137
It's all there.
The axe in the Berger slaying.

1148
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:13,180
The dentures in the Ewell case.

1149
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,725
Planting evidence,
framing suspects!

1150
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,561
- That's a lie.
- I think I can prove it, Sergeant.

1151
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:21,147
Sure... you can smear him.

1152
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:24,692
Ruin his whole life's work.

1153
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,780
Vargas, <i>I...</i>
I don't even know where he is.

1154
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,658
That's what you've done to him.

1155
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,453
- What I've done to him?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1156
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:39,123
He's on an important case
and he's disappeared.

1157
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:41,834
Good and drunk probably.

1158
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:45,922
After twelve years on the wagon.

1159
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:48,674
That's what you've done to him.

1160
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:55,056
What about Quinlan, Sergeant?

1161
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:57,516
What's he done?

1162
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:02,021
What about all those people
he put in the death house?

1163
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,108
Save your tears for them.

1164
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:15,034
IWhen the roll is called up yonder

1165
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:18,371
IWhen the roll... I

1166
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,467
What seems to be the trouble?

1167
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,135
- Trouble?
- The lights.

1168
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:36,389
The lights seem to be out
in all the cabins.

1169
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:38,015
Yeah. Yeah, yes, sir.

1170
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:43,729
Somebody's been
monkeying with them fuses.

1171
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:47,316
They think I'm gonna fix 'em,
they got another think comin'.

1172
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:51,070
It ain't my job to fix 'em,
even if I know how. I'm the night man.

1173
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,823
Could you show me please
to my wife's cabin?

1174
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,452
No...

1175
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,706
There's nobody here.

1176
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:04,458
You must be mistaken, sir.

1177
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:08,170
My wife has been registered here
since this morning.

1178
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,092
- My name is Vargas.
- Vargas?

1179
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:16,137
Would you look, please,
in the register?

1180
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:17,930
The register?

1181
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,349
<i>Well...</i>

1182
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:29,316
- Urn, that might be cabin six.
- Yes, possibly.

1183
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,528
- Maybe seven.
- Yes, here.

1184
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,580
May I?

1185
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:48,044
There's nobody been
registered all week.

1186
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:52,214
No, no, it's off the season.

1187
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:56,302
Nobody hardly ever
comes around at all.

1188
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,263
<i>I... I'm the night man.</i>

1189
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,315
There was that party...

1190
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:12,234
Party? What party?

1191
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:18,074
- It's a mess. Awful mess.
- Where?

1192
01:16:18,199 --> 01:16:21,243
They think I'm gonna clean it up,
they got another think comin'.

1193
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,079
Terrible, terrible brawl.

1194
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,501
Cabin number seven.

1195
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,380
Right in the middle
of the afternoon.

1196
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,216
Cabin number seven.

1197
01:16:43,808 --> 01:16:45,476
This <i>brawl...</i>

1198
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,895
You mean there was
some sort of a fight?

1199
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,481
- Fight?
- Yes.

1200
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:54,693
No, no, it wasn't
that kind of a brawl.

1201
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:04,453
It was one of them wild parties.
You know the kind?

1202
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:27,059
This can't be my wife's room.

1203
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:30,187
This ain't her clothes?

1204
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:32,231
It stinks in here!

1205
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,443
Let's get some air in here.

1206
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:43,033
It's a mess. It's a stinkin' mess!
Having their wild parties.

1207
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:46,036
There's my briefcase.
I left it with Susan. <i>It...</i>

1208
01:17:48,205 --> 01:17:49,957
A stub here.

1209
01:17:53,085 --> 01:17:55,296
I'm getting out of here.

1210
01:17:56,964 --> 01:17:58,382
My gun!

1211
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:02,261
You haven't been here?

1212
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,680
You haven't been in that room?

1213
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:07,266
No, I just looked in.

1214
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:09,185
I had a gun in this case!

1215
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:12,229
You didn't take it?

1216
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,899
What would I want with a gun?

1217
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,234
Well, somebody wanted it!

1218
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,238
If they hadn't put that Grandi boy
on the desk this morning,

1219
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,866
- none of this would've happened.
- Grandi?

1220
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:27,119
Well, who do you think
this belongs to, anyway?

1221
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,704
Where are they?

1222
01:18:30,497 --> 01:18:32,208
- The kids?
- Yes.

1223
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:33,626
Please.

1224
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,045
Gr-Gr-Gr-Gr... Rancho!

1225
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:38,589
- Rancho Grande?
- Yes!

1226
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:13,332
You got her undressed?

1227
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:16,460
Yeah. We've scattered
more reefer stubs around.

1228
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:20,631
You kids didn't use
none of that stuff yourself?

1229
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,466
Think we're crazy?

1230
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:25,302
Nobody in the Grandi family
gets hooked.

1231
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,887
Understand? That's the rule.

1232
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,139
We blew the smoke
on her clothes, that's all.

1233
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:32,017
Like you said.
We put on a good show to scare her.

1234
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:34,728
Let's hope it was good enough.

1235
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:39,817
When she wakes up, she's gonna think
maybe something really did happen.

1236
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,695
All right, now beat it.

1237
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,321
What about our dough?

1238
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,241
We were not doing it for fun,
Uncle Joe.

1239
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:50,119
Beat it, beat it.
You're gonna get your dough tomorrow.

1240
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:51,745
OK.

1241
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,372
Beat it.

1242
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,222
Psst.

1243
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:13,434
OK.

1244
01:20:33,537 --> 01:20:35,456
- Turn out the light.
- Why?

1245
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:41,462
Nobody can see you up here.

1246
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:46,133
- You sure?
- Of course, I'm sure.

1247
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:54,558
Hey, what are you doing?

1248
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:58,645
I brought you up here
for a reason.

1249
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,230
I don't get it.

1250
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,069
I don't even see why
you wanted us to bring her

1251
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:07,404
all the way into town here.

1252
01:21:07,988 --> 01:21:11,533
I couldn't drive out to the motel,
my car is known.

1253
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:14,203
So what?
You're a cop making an arrest.

1254
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:16,038
The vice boys'll do that.

1255
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:18,791
What's that for?

1256
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:26,548
Turn around.

1257
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:33,180
Get the phone.

1258
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,057
The phone.

1259
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,355
Now dial one-two-one-two.

1260
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,525
- That's the police station.
- Go on, dial it.

1261
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,572
Stop, Quinlan. You're drunk.

1262
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:52,825
Just stop and think for a minute.

1263
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:56,829
See if they answer.

1264
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,084
Hello?

1265
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:05,170
Ask for Sergeant Menzies.
Menzies.

1266
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,340
Sergeant Menzies.

1267
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:14,930
Quinlan, if you turn me in,
I'll have quite a story to tell.

1268
01:22:16,974 --> 01:22:19,351
Yeah, you sure will.

1269
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,770
See if Menzies <i>is...</i>

1270
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,522
Hello? Menzies?

1271
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,232
Got him?

1272
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,609
Hand me the phone.
Hold it so I can talk now.

1273
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,414
Give me the receiver.
Give me the receiver.

1274
01:22:31,029 --> 01:22:32,406
Hello, Pete.

1275
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:37,077
Of course it's me, partner.

1276
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:38,495
<i>N“! news yet?</i>

1277
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:41,081
Sanchez still hasn't broken.

1278
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,251
What?

1279
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:47,045
Vargas's wife?

1280
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:48,464
A narcotics rap?

1281
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:53,302
One of the boys who was on this
wild party gave me the buzz, see?

1282
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:58,807
Now, just relay it to the vice boys
as anonymous.

1283
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:02,394
The Hotel Ritz, room 18.

1284
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,980
The way I hear it,
things got a little out of control.

1285
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:08,233
Don't be surprised...
what they find.

1286
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:10,903
But what about me, Hank?

1287
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:12,779
What do I do?

1288
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,449
Keep after him!
Break him! Break him!

1289
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,370
- Put up the phone!
- Put up the...

1290
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:24,291
Receiver.

1291
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,126
Now, give me the key.

1292
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:41,266
Told you I brought you up here
for a reason.

1293
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:39,658
No, don't!

1294
01:25:27,247 --> 01:25:28,498
Help!

1295
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,712
Help!
Somebody help me!

1296
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:39,426
Help! Somebody
come up here, please!

1297
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:44,514
Help me!

1298
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:04,368
Mike!

1299
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,413
Mike!

1300
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,130
Talk English, can't you?

1301
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,924
Listen, I'm no cop now,
I'm a husband.

1302
01:27:43,049 --> 01:27:44,968
What did you do with her?

1303
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,387
Where is my wife? My wife?

1304
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,323
Va rgas!

1305
01:28:07,574 --> 01:28:09,201
It's your wife, Vargas.

1306
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,453
They picked her up.

1307
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,247
What do you mean, picked her up?

1308
01:28:14,372 --> 01:28:15,791
The Vice Squad.

1309
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,126
Quinlan?

1310
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:21,630
You better come outside
with me, amigo.

1311
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,595
Now, tell me what happened.

1312
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:32,849
They found her at the Hotel Ritz
half-naked on one of the beds, drugged.

1313
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,060
- There were reefer stubs and a heroin fix.
- No.

1314
01:28:35,185 --> 01:28:36,394
Va rgas!

1315
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:40,398
The charge isn't just
possession of narcotics.

1316
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:41,650
What is it then?

1317
01:28:41,775 --> 01:28:42,984
Murder.

1318
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:45,445
Murder?

1319
01:29:01,044 --> 01:29:02,462
Susie.

1320
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,548
Susie, darling.

1321
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:07,008
It's all right now, Susie. Sue.

1322
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:13,557
It's all down in the report.
They found evidence of a mixed party.

1323
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:15,851
Mixed party?

1324
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:19,896
Articles of clothing,
half-smoked reefers, needle marks.

1325
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:22,148
Something else
could produce the same effects.

1326
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:24,776
Demerol, for instance,
or Sodium Pentothal.

1327
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:26,361
You could smell the stuff on her.

1328
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:29,239
Listen, this whole set-up stinks.

1329
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,199
Who the hell
does Quinlan think he is?

1330
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:34,870
- Hanging a murder rap on my wife!
- Mike. Mike.

1331
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:37,706
- Mike.
- Susie, lie down.

1332
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,583
<i>- Mike...
- Now, now.</i>

1333
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:42,460
- It's all right, Susie.
- Mike.

1334
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:47,382
- Take me home. Mike. Mike.
- Yes. Susie? Susie?

1335
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,092
Forgive me.

1336
01:29:54,472 --> 01:29:55,891
Mike?

1337
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,852
Don't go.

1338
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:02,105
I'm right here, Susie.
It's all right.

1339
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,214
You understand, Vargas, there's
no formal charge against your wife.

1340
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:31,226
Even the vice boys
are not pressing anything.

1341
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,929
The fact that Susan
won't actually serve time

1342
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:35,764
makes everything all right,
is that it?

1343
01:30:35,889 --> 01:30:37,307
I told you I got something
to show you!

1344
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:40,769
Her family? Her good name?
Nothing's been touched by all this...

1345
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:42,312
filth!

1346
01:31:06,419 --> 01:31:08,004
I found that in the hotel room.

1347
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:10,548
Yeah.

1348
01:31:12,425 --> 01:31:14,052
With Grandi's body.

1349
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:15,155
He's still just sitting in there.
Here, give me that.

1350
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:16,948
We've been waiting
three hours already.

1351
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:20,410
We won't get a word out of this,
as long as he's near that piano.

1352
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,455
If you would just go in
and shut it off.

1353
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,457
He'll never stand for that.

1354
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:28,334
- I have to get him out of there.
- Give me the microphone.

1355
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,170
Vargas, I can take care
of this thing.

1356
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:32,172
Not without me.

1357
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:34,049
You know, I was just checking
with the Department.

1358
01:32:34,174 --> 01:32:36,217
You know that Grandi kid
we picked up?

1359
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:38,636
- Stand quietly.
- He started to talk.

1360
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,181
He says the kids were all faking.

1361
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:44,142
- They didn't give your wife any real dope.
- Here's the antenna.

1362
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:47,520
The doc says
it was only that truth stuff.

1363
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:50,774
- Sodium Pentothal.
- Yeah, no harm in it at all.

1364
01:32:50,899 --> 01:32:51,941
No harm?

1365
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:55,320
Schwartz is driving your car
across the border.

1366
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:57,322
I told him
we'll be by the bridge here.

1367
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,657
He's bringing your wife along.

1368
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:02,160
She's feeling fine.

1369
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:04,579
- The doc says she can travel.
- Sergeant...

1370
01:33:04,704 --> 01:33:07,624
Look, all she wants is to catch
the early plane out of here.

1371
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:11,711
How can I leave here
until my wife's name is clean? Clean!

1372
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:14,214
What do you think
you're carrying that microphone for?

1373
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:18,051
- Now remember, don't cross your arms.
- I know, I know, I know.

1374
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:21,221
I've got to get the truth from Quinlan.
All on tape.

1375
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:24,057
He could stay there
the rest of the week, like he used to.

1376
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,018
Now, look, why don't you
just take your wife home

1377
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:29,145
and let me handle this thing?
It's my job.

1378
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,855
It's my job too, Menzies.

1379
01:33:30,980 --> 01:33:33,900
- 'It's my job.'
- 'It's my job too, Menzies.'

1380
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:37,028
You think I like it?
I hate this machine.

1381
01:33:37,153 --> 01:33:39,906
- Spying, creeping around back alleys.
- How do you think I feel?

1382
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:42,200
Hank is the best friend I ever had.

1383
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:44,536
That's one reason for my staying.

1384
01:33:44,661 --> 01:33:46,538
You don't trust me?

1385
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:48,665
Don't forget, I was the one
that showed you that cane.

1386
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,625
I didn't have to do it,
you know.

1387
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:55,004
- Yes you did, Sergeant.
- Somebody could have planted it there.

1388
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:57,674
- Menzies...
- Besides Grandi's corpse.

1389
01:33:57,799 --> 01:33:59,676
You know better than that.

1390
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:02,762
You say the reefers were planted.
Why not Hank's cane?

1391
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,931
You're an honest cop.

1392
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,474
Sure, I am.

1393
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:10,520
And who made me an honest cop?
Hank Quinlan.

1394
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:12,105
Come on, Menzies.

1395
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:14,315
I am what I am because of him.

1396
01:34:23,825 --> 01:34:24,951
What's my fortune?

1397
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:34,544
You been reading the cards,
haven't you?

1398
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:36,504
I've been doing the accounts.

1399
01:34:38,882 --> 01:34:41,301
Come on.
Read my future for me.

1400
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:46,097
You haven't got any.

1401
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:49,475
What do you mean?

1402
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,479
Your future is all used up.

1403
01:35:00,069 --> 01:35:01,946
Why don't you go home?

1404
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,424
Vargas? Vargas?

1405
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:24,344
'I don't know if you can hear me
over that piano music,

1406
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:26,349
'but I'll get him out of there
so you can hear.'

1407
01:35:58,294 --> 01:36:00,964
I'll get him out.
Away from that music.

1408
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:02,674
Be sure he doesn't see you.

1409
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,179
I must be drunk.

1410
01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:12,267
A minute ago...

1411
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:15,478
<i>l</i> thought you were Vargas.

1412
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17,939
Come on out, Hank!

1413
01:36:18,064 --> 01:36:20,525
- What's that?
- Come on out, Hank. I'm tired.

1414
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:23,361
- Who told you to come here?
- I'm tired of waiting, Hank.

1415
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:25,238
There's some questions
you got to answer.

1416
01:36:25,363 --> 01:36:26,614
Questions?

1417
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:29,951
Questions?

1418
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:32,704
I need another drink.

1419
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:34,998
You had enough.

1420
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:38,960
That's what Tana keeps telling me.
How much is enough?

1421
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:45,508
'Hank, I'm sick of chasing around
trying to get at the truth.'

1422
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:47,969
'You could use a drink
yourself, partner.'

1423
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:49,262
'You got to answer, Hank.

1424
01:36:49,387 --> 01:36:52,098
'All kinds of things.
First, about Vargas's gun.'

1425
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:53,516
'How do you know about the gun?'

1426
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:59,314
- 'He thinks you took it.'
- 'Vargas?

1427
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:02,108
'Or was it Grandi that stole it?'

1428
01:37:02,775 --> 01:37:05,820
- 'You been talking to Vargas?'
- 'And then you took it from Grandi?'

1429
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:09,157
'You've been getting kind of chummy,
you and that Mexican.'

1430
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:11,993
Does that explain that thing
you're carrying around now?

1431
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:15,455
What's it called?

1432
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:18,291
'That thing you're wearing?'

1433
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:22,587
- What I'm wearing?
- Sure.

1434
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:26,090
- That halo.
- Halo?

1435
01:37:26,215 --> 01:37:28,343
Looks real pretty on you, Pete.

1436
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:34,057
Pretty soon you'll be
flapping your wings like an angel.

1437
01:37:40,563 --> 01:37:41,564
'Look out.'

1438
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:46,986
Vargas'll turn you into one of these
here starry-eyed idealists.

1439
01:37:47,111 --> 01:37:49,989
'They're the ones making
all the real trouble in the world.

1440
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:51,674
'Be careful.'
They're worse than crooks.

1441
01:37:51,741 --> 01:37:53,910
You can always do something
with a crook.

1442
01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:57,080
You're the one who should be careful,
Hank. Dealing with crooks.

1443
01:37:57,205 --> 01:37:59,207
'Sometimes you can turn
into a crook yourself.

1444
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:04,087
- 'Look what happened with Grandi.'
- 'Partner, nobody ever called me a crook.'

1445
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,177
Look. Look up there.

1446
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:13,596
See?

1447
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:18,476
That oil pump pumping up money.

1448
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:23,314
Money.

1449
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:25,108
Don't you think
I could've been rich?

1450
01:38:25,233 --> 01:38:27,527
A cop in my position?

1451
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:29,404
- What do I have?
- Tell me about Grandi...

1452
01:38:29,529 --> 01:38:34,367
After thirty years... my little turkey
ranch. That's all I got. A couple of acres.

1453
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:36,494
We got to talk about Grandi.

1454
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:41,874
'An honest cop!'

1455
01:38:41,999 --> 01:38:44,836
Then this Mexican comes along,
and look at the spot he puts me in!

1456
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:47,213
You can't blame Vargas
for what happened to Grandi.

1457
01:38:51,092 --> 01:38:52,969
- I blame Vargas for everything.
- Hank, don't be crazy!

1458
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:54,095
Crazy?

1459
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,670
'If it wasn't for him,
do you think I'd be in a situation

1460
01:38:57,765 --> 01:38:59,142
'where Grandi
could blackmail me?

1461
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:00,977
'Then of course,
when I had to defend myself...'

1462
01:39:01,102 --> 01:39:03,104
'Defend yourself?
Hank, you must be crazy!'

1463
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:05,064
- 'Sure, sure, I'm crazy.'
- 'insane!'

1464
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:07,483
'Defend yourself! Hank.

1465
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:09,193
'You murdered Grandi.

1466
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:12,196
'I left my cane by his body.
That was sure crazy.'

1467
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:15,700
All right, let's start
in the beginning.

1468
01:39:15,825 --> 01:39:17,118
What about Vargas's gun?

1469
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:19,203
I was talking about my cane.

1470
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:21,330
- The gun!
- I forgot it.

1471
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:23,916
- The gun you stole from his briefcase!
- Gun? Gun?

1472
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:26,919
<i>- Vargas's gun'. Vargas' s'.
- Vargas'. Vargas'. Vargas'.!</i>

1473
01:39:27,044 --> 01:39:29,297
All you want to talk about
is Vargas!

1474
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,428
You took the gun from his briefcase,
but you didn't use it.

1475
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:38,514
<i>- 'Grancfi was strangled.'
- '(Branch was a crook.'</i>

1476
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,057
'You're a killer, Hank.'

1477
01:39:40,183 --> 01:39:42,226
Partner, I'm a cop.

1478
01:39:42,351 --> 01:39:43,978
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1479
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:47,273
Drunk and crazy as you must have been
when you strangled him.

1480
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:51,027
I guess you were somehow
thinking of your wife.

1481
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:52,904
The way she was strangled.

1482
01:39:53,029 --> 01:39:55,823
Well, I'm always thinking of her,

1483
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:57,700
drunk or sober.

1484
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:01,537
What else is there to think about?

1485
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:05,124
Except my job. My dirty job!

1486
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:09,962
- You didn't have to make it dirty.
- I don't call it dirty! Look at the record.

1487
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:13,591
- 'Our record, partner! '
- 'Sure, sure, sure.'

1488
01:40:13,716 --> 01:40:17,595
Well, all those convictions.

1489
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,848
Convictions, sure.
How many did you frame?

1490
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:21,974
'Nobody.'

1491
01:40:22,099 --> 01:40:23,768
Come on, Hank.
How many did you frame?

1492
01:40:23,893 --> 01:40:26,020
I told you. Nobody.

1493
01:40:27,188 --> 01:40:28,898
Nobody that wasn't guilty.

1494
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:30,775
Guilty.

1495
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:33,277
Guilty.

1496
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,949
Every last one of them.
Guilty.

1497
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:42,286
All these years you've been
playing me for a sucker,

1498
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:43,829
'faking evidence.'

1499
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:45,581
'Aiding justice, partner.'

1500
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:47,583
Yeah, like the axe
in the Berger case.

1501
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:49,252
Yeah, remember that?

1502
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:51,087
I was the one
that found the axe.

1503
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:53,412
Just where
you planted it for me to find.

1504
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:55,591
Just like the dynamite
with Sanchez.

1505
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:58,803
- Just like you planted that dynamite!
- Don't you think Sanchez is guilty?

1506
01:40:58,928 --> 01:41:00,638
He's guilty. He'll confess.

1507
01:41:02,348 --> 01:41:04,892
Hey, listen to that.

1508
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:10,064
- Hank, I'm gonna have <i>to...</i>
- Shut up.

1509
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:11,899
Hear that?

1510
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:15,570
- Hear what?
- Like an echo.

1511
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:27,748
<i>Vargas?</i>

1512
01:41:31,544 --> 01:41:33,796
'I got a feeling
he's someplace around here.'

1513
01:41:36,424 --> 01:41:37,967
Close to me.

1514
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:40,636
I got a hunch.

1515
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:44,181
- Why Vargas? Wh-Wh-Why should <i>he...</i>
- You sound kind of nervous, Pete.

1516
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,312
No, my game <i>leg...</i>

1517
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:54,108
<i>is</i> starting to talk to me.

1518
01:41:57,612 --> 01:41:59,238
Vargas.

1519
01:42:06,245 --> 01:42:09,165
Maybe he's tailing me with a bug.

1520
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:13,961
<i>Recording...</i>

1521
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:18,799
Hey, are you carrying a bug for him?
A microphone?

1522
01:42:18,924 --> 01:42:20,885
- Hank, <i>I...</i>
- Don't lie to me!

1523
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:23,304
All right, all right now!
You'd better give me that gun.

1524
01:42:23,429 --> 01:42:26,349
'Where is he? Where is he?'

1525
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:28,684
How did you figure
to frame Vargas with it?

1526
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:30,519
Framed? Who's been framed?

1527
01:42:30,645 --> 01:42:32,063
'Where is he?

1528
01:42:33,356 --> 01:42:34,690
'Vargas?

1529
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:36,192
- Where is he?
- Hank, look, <i>I...</i>

1530
01:42:36,317 --> 01:42:37,652
'I'm talking to Vargas now.'

1531
01:42:37,777 --> 01:42:39,612
Vargas? Do you hear me?

1532
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:42,156
I'm talking to you.

1533
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:45,368
Through this walking microphone
that used to work for me.

1534
01:42:45,493 --> 01:42:47,161
- No, I ain't working for Vargas.
- Vargas, Vargas.

1535
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:50,456
'I'm working for the Department, Hank.
Better give me Vargas's gun.'

1536
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:51,707
- 'OK, here it is.'
- Give it to me!

1537
01:42:51,832 --> 01:42:53,167
'Vargas?

1538
01:42:56,504 --> 01:42:57,713
Hank

1539
01:42:58,506 --> 01:42:59,715
<i>Hank...</i>

1540
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:50,850
<i>Well, Captain...</i>

1541
01:43:51,851 --> 01:43:55,646
I'm afraid this is finally something
you can't talk your way out of.

1542
01:43:57,606 --> 01:43:59,066
You want to bet?

1543
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:04,530
You killed him, Vargas.

1544
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:07,408
Come on, now.
Give me my gun back.

1545
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:12,413
You don't understand me.
You killed Pete.

1546
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:16,000
The bullet is from your gun.

1547
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,837
You think anyone
would believe that?

1548
01:44:19,962 --> 01:44:21,797
They always believe me.

1549
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:26,051
Anyway, they'd never believe
I killed him.

1550
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:30,014
- The gun?
- You're resisting arrest.

1551
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:34,852
How could you arrest me here?
This is my country.

1552
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:38,689
And this is where you're gonna die.

1553
01:44:44,653 --> 01:44:47,740
That was no miss, Vargas!
That was just to turn you around!

1554
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:49,784
I don't want to shoot you
in the back.

1555
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:54,580
Unless you'd rather
try to run for it.

1556
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:19,647
Schwartz!

1557
01:45:19,772 --> 01:45:22,107
Is she there?
Did you bring my wife?

1558
01:45:22,233 --> 01:45:23,359
She's in the car.

1559
01:45:23,484 --> 01:45:24,985
That's Menzies. He's dead.

1560
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:27,321
Quinlan's been shot, too.
He's lying by the recorder.

1561
01:45:27,446 --> 01:45:29,615
Down there!
I've got it all on tape.

1562
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:31,367
- You sure you got enough?
- More than enough.

1563
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:33,035
Go play it back. You'll see.

1564
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,794
- Susie.
- Mike.

1565
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:50,219
'All these years
you've been playing me for a sucker...

1566
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,388
'faking evidence.'

1567
01:45:52,513 --> 01:45:54,515
'Aiding justice, partner.'

1568
01:45:56,308 --> 01:45:57,852
Hank!

1569
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:00,980
- Susie.
- Mike.

1570
01:46:02,314 --> 01:46:05,985
It's all over, Susie.
I'm taking you home. Home...

1571
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:14,577
- 'How many did you frame?'
- 'Nobody that wasn't guilty. Guilty.'

1572
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:15,786
Hank!

1573
01:46:15,911 --> 01:46:18,873
- 'No, I ain't working for Vargas.'
- 'Vargas, Vargas!'

1574
01:46:18,998 --> 01:46:21,125
- 'Hank, you better give me that gun.'
- 'OK, here it is.'

1575
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:23,168
- 'Give it to me.'
- 'Vargas?

1576
01:46:26,338 --> 01:46:31,302
Pete, that's the second bullet
I stopped for you.

1577
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:55,326
His famous intuition was right,
after all.

1578
01:46:55,451 --> 01:46:58,704
He framed that Mexican kid, Sanchez,
but he didn't even need to.

1579
01:46:58,829 --> 01:47:00,623
The kid confessed
about that bomb.

1580
01:47:01,665 --> 01:47:05,336
So, it turns out
Quinlan was right, after all.

1581
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:10,049
Isn't somebody going to come
and take him away?

1582
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:11,759
Yeah, in just a few minutes.

1583
01:47:12,676 --> 01:47:13,996
You really liked him, didn't you?

1584
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:17,306
The cop did.

1585
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:19,058
The one who killed him.

1586
01:47:19,183 --> 01:47:20,184
He loved him.

1587
01:47:20,309 --> 01:47:23,687
Well, Hank was a great detective,
all right.

1588
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:25,439
And a lousy cop.

1589
01:47:26,231 --> 01:47:27,816
Is that all
you have to say for him?

1590
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,236
He was some kind of a man.

1591
01:47:34,949 --> 01:47:37,242
What does it matter
what you say about people?

1592
01:47:44,625 --> 01:47:46,085
Good bye, Ta na.

1593
01:47:47,628 --> 01:47:49,046
<i>Adios.</i>
