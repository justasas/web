1
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:05,150
Oh!

2
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:58,097
Well, Miss Timberlake, back again
for a little of the taxpayers' money, hmm?

3
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:05,145
- So did you work last week?
- No.

4
00:03:05,229 --> 00:03:07,273
- Are you available for work?
- Yes.

5
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:09,400
- Did you turn down any jobs?
- No.

6
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:12,403
- Are you busy tonight?
- Yes.

7
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:15,906
If, in our opinion,
the applicant hasn't exercised

8
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,868
proper diligence in seeking employment,

9
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:21,412
we can withhold payment of cheques.

10
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:23,539
Perhaps tomorrow night?

11
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:28,335
There's a wonderful little diner
round the corner from where I live

12
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:31,297
and after dinner we could, uh, well...

13
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:36,135
...perhaps...
- Go up to your apartment?

14
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:42,641
- Well, I, uh...
- If you want me to go up to your apartment

15
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:47,396
come out and ask. That way I can
think about it and make a decision.

16
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:51,066
Would you like to stop off at my place?

17
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,529
- May I have my cheque?
- Oh. Of course.

18
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:07,833
Well?

19
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:11,003
I would enjoy going out with you,
Mr Beasley,

20
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:14,298
if I didn't find you so personally distasteful.

21
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:19,303
You're a sneaky, crude, offensive man.

22
00:04:19,386 --> 00:04:21,430
That's just how I feel.

23
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:25,893
I'm sure there are hundreds of girls
who admire those qualities.

24
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:29,772
I circled the entire area, sir.

25
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:33,108
- There's no sign of her.
- Darn. Thank you, Collins.

26
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:40,115
Hit and run's a dangerous sport, Mr Shayne,
even for the privileged class.

27
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,119
Even if this victim survives,
what can she do? Sue you?

28
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:49,124
With your money, you can run down half
the girls in New York and still be solvent.

29
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:51,418
We hit a puddle, splashed the girl.

30
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:54,255
Would you have me stop, tie up the traffic,

31
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:57,508
crawl through the rain
and beg forgiveness?

32
00:04:57,591 --> 00:05:01,095
A decent gesture like that
would never occur to you.

33
00:05:01,178 --> 00:05:04,890
So I'll set up a foundation
for waterlogged girls.

34
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:07,601
Isn't it a little early for cocktails?

35
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:10,229
I'm perfectly aware of what I'm doing.

36
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:12,940
- I have an analyst. Dr Gruber.
- I know.

37
00:05:13,023 --> 00:05:17,778
A distinguished analyst. I know exactly
what started me drinking at this hour.

38
00:05:17,862 --> 00:05:20,823
- What?
- Dr Gruber, he's a lush.

39
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:23,617
Seven years of treating you could do it.

40
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:25,744
- Yeah.
- Look out.

41
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:29,165
- He's a brilliant man. Brilliant.
- Brilliant.

42
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:33,377
He put his finger right on my problem -
my lack of integrity.

43
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,715
You were a humble but respected
professor of economics at Princeton.

44
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:40,885
Students sat at my feet
absorbing my wisdom.

45
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:43,220
The lvy League Socrates.

46
00:05:43,304 --> 00:05:47,016
Then you came along
dangling $50,000 a year under my nose

47
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:49,810
and, to my everlasting shame, I sold out.

48
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:53,772
And every year you further humiliate me
by raising my salary.

49
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:57,193
Inexcusable.
Like rubbing salt in the wounds.

50
00:05:57,276 --> 00:06:00,529
And at Christmas
you gave me stock in the company.

51
00:06:00,613 --> 00:06:04,116
- Why are you trying to destroy me?
- Just my natural hostility.

52
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,953
Excuse me.
Benson's attorneys say he still won't sell.

53
00:06:08,037 --> 00:06:11,207
Roger, you researched that company.
What's it worth?

54
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,459
General Electronics? Six million.

55
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:16,670
Offer six and a quarter,
tell him it's top dollar.

56
00:06:16,754 --> 00:06:18,172
Yes, sir.

57
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:22,009
Roger, if that deal goes through,
you're in for a bonus.

58
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:23,761
Bonus?

59
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:26,639
- Haven't you any conscience?
- What?

60
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:32,102
Just when I'm reaching a point where I'll
have the courage to go back to Princeton.

61
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:34,522
- Would it help if I fired you?
- No!

62
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:38,025
Dr Gruber said this would be
the worst time for that.

63
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,152
- Why?
- I owe him quite a bit of money.

64
00:06:40,236 --> 00:06:42,696
He's brilliant!

65
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,823
Wait a minute. Yes?

66
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:50,079
- 'Mrs Haskell and Mrs Farnum are here.'
- I'll see them in a moment.

67
00:06:50,162 --> 00:06:52,206
- There she is!
- Who?

68
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,333
- That girl I splashed.
- Where?

69
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:58,504
Just went into the automat.
Roger, go and apologise for me.

70
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:01,882
She's a blonde in a raincoat
with a leather collar.

71
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:04,593
This is in case I damaged her clothes.

72
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:08,180
I'm a highly paid executive,
not a messenger boy.

73
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:11,642
OK, I'll go.

74
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:15,229
You hired me as your financial adviser.

75
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:19,275
Wouldn't send Bernard Baruch out
to pay off a girl for you.

76
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:22,152
Oh, yes, you would.

77
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,501
Connie?

78
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:39,837
Connie! Yoo-hoo!

79
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,798
- Where are you?
- In the cucumbers.

80
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:46,886
Hi.

81
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:50,514
That's the first smiling face today.
I only get hungry ones.

82
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:53,267
What'll it be? Chicken pie or turkey leg?

83
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,768
Chicken.

84
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:01,442
How'd it go today? Any luck?

85
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:06,530
All bad. Some idiot splashed me
with his car, practically ruined my dress.

86
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:09,533
You should see me. He never even stopped.

87
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:12,661
- Then I had to face Beasley.
- What a parlay!

88
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:16,373
How is the playboy
of the 8th Avenue unemployment office?

89
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:20,211
He asked me to his apartment.
I told him what I thought of him.

90
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:22,880
- Au gratin or baked potato?
- Baked.

91
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:29,220
He's not worth the trouble.
Does a snake know he's a snake?

92
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:32,139
He crawls on his stomach
and thinks he's a king.

93
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:35,726
Right. You know, you're a philosopher.

94
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:40,314
When a girl of my age still isn't married,
you either philosophise or get arrested.

95
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,233
- Carrots or peas?
- Carrots.

96
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:49,698
Cathy, your problem is how to keep
your honour AND your job.

97
00:08:49,782 --> 00:08:53,410
Men see you and suddenly their wives
just don't understand them.

98
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:56,080
I've never done anything to encourage them.

99
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:58,791
You don't have to, nature did it for you.

100
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:01,293
- Jell-o?
- Yeah.

101
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:06,757
Now, there are just so many jobs for girls
who can operate computing machines.

102
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:10,010
The next job you get, you'll listen to me.

103
00:09:10,094 --> 00:09:12,137
You don't comb your hair, no make-up,

104
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:15,933
wear military heels,
you remind them of their wives.

105
00:09:16,016 --> 00:09:19,854
They figure this they can get at home
so they leave you alone.

106
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:24,358
Have some cake, it might make your
skin break out. See you later, honey.

107
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:27,319
OK. Hey, I have an interview after lunch

108
00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:30,155
- so I'll call you when it's over.
- Good.

109
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,949
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

110
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:36,287
Mr Miller.

111
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,414
Miss Emerson.

112
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:42,251
Are you familiar with company policy
on giving away free food?

113
00:09:42,334 --> 00:09:45,212
No, sir. Are we for it or against it?

114
00:09:45,296 --> 00:09:48,591
That will cost you
one dollar and twelve cents.

115
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:52,386
However, I might be willing
to overlook the incident

116
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:55,222
if you, uh, introduce me to your friend.

117
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:58,934
- How is Mrs Miller?
- She doesn't understand me.

118
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:01,478
I could've made book on that answer.

119
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,158
Excuse me,
were you struck by a car this morning?

120
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:17,077
- What?
- Splattered by a limousine?

121
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,246
Oh. Yes, I certainly was.

122
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,459
The gentleman who owns the car
has offices across the street.

123
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:28,088
He saw you from his window
and sent me to convey his regrets.

124
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:31,759
I should think a gentleman
would apologise himself.

125
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:35,554
- Well, Mr Shayne's a very busy man.
- Oh, really?

126
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:40,184
Is that why he didn't stop?
That's leaving the scene of an accident.

127
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,394
If there was any damage done...

128
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:46,607
My raincoat was practically ruined.
And look at this dress.

129
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,611
I've been authorised to compensate you
for any damage done.

130
00:10:50,694 --> 00:10:53,322
- Well, you just tell Mr...
- Shayne.

131
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:56,534
...Shayne, that money
does not buy good manners.

132
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:58,661
I wish I could tell him that myself.

133
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:01,539
- Do you? Really?
- I certainly do.

134
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:03,457
You're right!

135
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:07,294
How would you feel?
Here I am, he practically runs me down

136
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:09,421
and then drives right away!

137
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:12,758
And doesn't have the decency
to apologise himself.

138
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:16,345
Furthermore I have a job interview
and have to go like this.

139
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:18,931
- He doesn't care.
- Ohhh.

140
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:23,853
- You know what I'd like to do?
- Throw the money in his face?

141
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:25,771
Exactly!

142
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:28,858
I'd like to throw that money right in his face.

143
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:30,985
- Would you?
- Yes, I would.

144
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:33,863
I've waited seven years for this moment.

145
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:35,990
You come with me.

146
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:43,414
Say, Connie,
there's a man dragging Cathy out.

147
00:11:43,497 --> 00:11:47,126
Gee. They don't even
give her a chance to eat.

148
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:57,553
She's gonna spend the rest of her life
saying, "I'm not that kind of a girl."

149
00:11:57,636 --> 00:12:02,099
I'm only afraid that some day,
before she can finish saying it, she will be.

150
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:07,104
There you are.

151
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:12,234
The Manhattan Home for Young Women
thanks you for your generous donation

152
00:12:12,318 --> 00:12:14,486
and for permitting us to use your name

153
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,948
- in our fundraising drive.
- Well, it's a worthy cause.

154
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:23,162
There's a great need to provide
an atmosphere of care and understanding

155
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:25,289
during this critical period.

156
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:28,501
You'd be shocked
that the rate of unwed mothers...

157
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:31,670
Charlotte, we don't
call them unwed mothers.

158
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:35,966
...that the rate of unfortunate girls
has tripled in five years.

159
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:38,802
- It's a deplorable situation.
- Yes, yes.

160
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:41,514
There's one consolation, Mrs Farnum -

161
00:12:41,597 --> 00:12:44,850
for every unwed mother,
there's an unwed father.

162
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:48,020
I never thought of it that way.

163
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:50,773
Well, thank you again, Mr Shayne.

164
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:53,108
- Goodbye, Mr Shayne.
- Goodbye.

165
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:59,615
Wasn't it sweet of him
to contribute so generously?

166
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:03,869
Mr Shayne doesn't deny he's responsible
for what happened to me?

167
00:13:03,953 --> 00:13:05,996
- No.
- The least he could've done

168
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,584
was come to see me himself instead
of sending someone over with money.

169
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:13,379
Some men have no sense
of moral obligation.

170
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:17,967
Same thing happened to my friend Connie.
He never even told her his name.

171
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,094
No. Have a seat.

172
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:22,221
I'll tell him you're here.

173
00:13:24,181 --> 00:13:27,685
My dear, when the time comes,
call this number.

174
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:30,896
Psst! Miss Timberlake.

175
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:41,031
No wonder he donated so generously.
Guilt feelings.

176
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:43,492
Now, Evelyn, we must be realistic.

177
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:48,581
When a man donates $200,000,
he's entitled to use the facilities.

178
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:54,170
He's in there, he'll be right out.
Don't forget what you're gonna say -

179
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:57,464
reckless driving,
leaving the scene of an accident,

180
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,967
bad manners, then the money in the face!

181
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,679
There are few other things I'd do
if I weren't a lady.

182
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:07,224
This is no time to think of sex. Now, go!

183
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:09,768
Mr Shayne, Miss Timberlake.

184
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,107
Miss Timberlake?

185
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:18,402
Go get him.
Miss Timberlake has something to say.

186
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:22,948
Yes?

187
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:25,576
I- I'd like to apologise

188
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:28,913
uh, for getting in your way this morning.

189
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:32,291
- It was entirely my fault.
- I was practically jaywalking.

190
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:36,212
- You had a perfect right to be on the curb.
- I was leaning over.

191
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:42,176
I'm sorry I couldn't stop. My driver circled
the block but when we got back you'd gone.

192
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,054
- Leaving the scene of an accident.
- Oh.

193
00:14:45,137 --> 00:14:48,682
I don't know why I left.
I must have gotten panicky.

194
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:50,351
Him, not you!

195
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:53,687
Roger, don't you have a letter
to get off to Princeton?

196
00:14:56,148 --> 00:15:01,320
I should've come down to the restaurant
to apologise but I had some people here.

197
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:05,783
Knowing how busy you are, I'm surprised
you found time to send anyone.

198
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:09,245
If I've damaged anything in any way...

199
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:11,372
Oh, not really.

200
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:16,544
Water's good for raincoats,
and there's just a few spots on my dress.

201
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:19,672
- I'll be glad to pay for a new dress.
- No, thank you.

202
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:22,758
I was going on an interview,
it wasn't important.

203
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:26,470
You can't go on an interview like that.
Come with me.

204
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:31,183
- 'Yes, Mr Shayne? '
- Send up the valet.

205
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:35,813
You can have your things back
in 20 minutes. You can change in there.

206
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:40,609
There's a bathroom on your right and in that
closet there's a topcoat you can wear.

207
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:44,405
Well, go on, do as I tell you.

208
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:46,490
That's right.

209
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:50,411
- Connie, it's for you.
- Oh. Thanks.

210
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:53,747
Hello? Cathy?

211
00:15:53,831 --> 00:15:57,001
- Where'd you go?
- Across the street in Mr Shayne's office.

212
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:59,879
- What about your lunch?
- Once I get my dress back.

213
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:02,631
What floor are you on?
Millie, get the cleaver!

214
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:04,592
Honey, we'll be right over.

215
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:10,055
Connie, I'm all right. He sent my dress out
to have it cleaned.

216
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,057
See you later.

217
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,061
Sent it out to have it cleaned?

218
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:20,941
I have heard of sneaky ways
to undress a girl but...

219
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:28,032
Isn't that the man
who took Cathy out of here?

220
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:29,783
Let me see.

221
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:32,828
That's the one.

222
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,678
The tractor division should show
an increase in earnings.

223
00:16:49,762 --> 00:16:53,307
Fine. Now we're back
to General Electronics.

224
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:57,144
Still no breakthrough.

225
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:59,271
Come in.

226
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:02,650
- Ooh, I'm sorry.
- Wait a minute, whoa.

227
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:07,238
- Come on in.
- Mr Shayne, I thought you were alone.

228
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:12,201
Um, it didn't come back yet
and I have an appointment.

229
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:14,328
All right, I'll check on it.

230
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:17,748
Wait a minute.
Gentlemen, this is Miss Timberlake.

231
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:20,167
- How do you do?
- Come on in.

232
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:24,046
- Oh, I didn't want to interrupt.
- You're not interrupting.

233
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:30,010
Miss Timberlake, we need to know
why a man won't sell a company

234
00:17:30,094 --> 00:17:33,556
when we've offered him
more than it's worth. Go ahead.

235
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:37,309
Well, we've tried everyone.

236
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:42,022
We talked to Benson's lawyers,
his directors and his executive assistant.

237
00:17:42,106 --> 00:17:45,526
Now, who else is there to talk to?

238
00:17:45,609 --> 00:17:47,653
There, you see.

239
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,701
- Have you talked to Mr Benson?
- Have you talked to Mr Benson?

240
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:55,828
Well...

241
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:57,580
no.

242
00:17:57,663 --> 00:18:00,457
No, they haven't talked to Mr Benson.

243
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:04,962
Well, the same thing happened
to my Aunt Rachel.

244
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:10,634
Um, this man she knows in the next town
kept sending her letters proposing to her,

245
00:18:10,718 --> 00:18:13,179
and she just kept turning him down.

246
00:18:13,262 --> 00:18:19,226
Now, she wanted to get married but
she felt that he should've asked in person.

247
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:22,938
There, you see, gentlemen.

248
00:18:23,022 --> 00:18:27,943
Perhaps Mr Benson is eager to become
a bride but has never been asked.

249
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:31,280
How would your Aunt Rachel have felt
about a phone call?

250
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:34,992
Oh, no. She wouldn't say yes
till he came to the house.

251
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:37,119
They have eight children now.

252
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:40,498
Well, that couldn't have happened
over the phone.

253
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:43,209
Miss Timberlake,

254
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:46,712
how would you like to go for a ride with me?
Come on.

255
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:49,173
What are you doing in Baltimore?

256
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:52,176
I'm here with Mr Shayne. We...

257
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:54,720
Well, of course I've got my clothes on.

258
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:57,765
Connie, we flew here in his private plane.

259
00:18:57,848 --> 00:19:02,269
Gosh, you should see it,
it's completely furnished. Even has a bar.

260
00:19:02,353 --> 00:19:06,023
Honey, this time
you've run into a shrewd one.

261
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:09,026
Once he gets you up there, you can't argue.

262
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:11,153
It's hit the silk or else.

263
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:16,617
Connie, he's here to buy a company and
he brought me along as a good luck charm.

264
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:20,371
I'll call you back. Bye.

265
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,875
- What happened?
- Well, Aunt Rachel said yes.

266
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,962
- Good.
- And I owe it all to you.

267
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:31,549
Miss Timberlake,
I'm glad I almost ran you down this
morning.

268
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:33,676
I am too.

269
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,304
Let's go and toast that puddle
that brought us together.

270
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:40,516
- Do you care for Italian food?
- Oh, I love it.

271
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:44,144
Good, I know a little place,
if you like fettucine?

272
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:47,314
- Er, yes.
- This is the only place to have it.

273
00:19:57,157 --> 00:19:58,784
- Hello?
- 'Hi.'

274
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:00,870
Cathy? Where are you?

275
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:04,165
- In Philadelphia.
- 'What are you doing there? '

276
00:20:04,248 --> 00:20:06,750
It's the only place to have fettucine.

277
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:12,214
I should've thought of that. I thought he took
you there to buy you the Liberty Bell.

278
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:17,136
Get off that merry-go-round. He's just
another Beasley with a flying bedroom.

279
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:22,016
Oh, Connie, he's not like anyone.
You've never met a man like this.

280
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:24,143
That's the problem, neither have you.

281
00:20:24,226 --> 00:20:27,813
- I have so much to tell you when I get back.
- 'If you get back.'

282
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:30,858
We're leaving, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

283
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:37,573
- Well, did you get your roommate?
- Yes. She said to be sure and say hello.

284
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:42,620
You'll have to pay the piper for dinner by
sitting through a report I'm due to deliver.

285
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:44,371
I don't mind.

286
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:50,002
How do you feel about untapped natural
resources of underdeveloped countries?

287
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,589
I think they ought to be tapped.

288
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:57,968
Hmm. You've condensed
a 40-minute speech into one sentence.

289
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:05,392
The wealth of a nation
is in the wellbeing of its people,

290
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:08,479
both spiritually and materialistically.

291
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:11,690
It's not a question of lowering our standards

292
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:14,610
but of helping others to raise theirs.

293
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:17,571
If all people everywhere could be content

294
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:21,867
and their living standards even
and compatible with ours,

295
00:21:21,951 --> 00:21:23,994
there would be no envy in the world

296
00:21:24,078 --> 00:21:27,414
and, therefore, less provocation of war.

297
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:32,920
When you encourage and help people
to develop their own natural resources,

298
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:35,422
you do more than put bread in their mouths,

299
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:37,550
you put dignity in their hearts.

300
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:45,599
Even the Russians are applauding.

301
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:52,690
- Isn't he magnificent?
- Yeah.

302
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,527
- His car nearly ran me down this morning.
- Ooh!

303
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,071
- Yeah.
- What a delightful way to go.

304
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,952
Now we've discussed
the world's natural resources,

305
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:07,079
let's explore some of our own.

306
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:11,834
Miss Timberlake, New York's a wonderful
city, what would you like to do with it?

307
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:15,629
I don't know.
I've never been offered a city before.

308
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:18,966
That doesn't speak well
for the boys back home.

309
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:24,388
It's really not their fault. "Miss Timberlake,
I offer you Upper Sandusky."

310
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:28,184
- You see?
- It doesn't have the same ring.

311
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:31,812
What is a pretty girl offered
in Upper Sandusky?

312
00:22:33,147 --> 00:22:34,648
Baseball.

313
00:22:34,732 --> 00:22:36,817
I went to a lot of baseball games.

314
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:40,154
A friend of mine has a box
behind the third base dugout.

315
00:22:40,237 --> 00:22:43,782
- Oh, that's nice.
- Cougars won the pennant in '58.

316
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:46,952
If you like baseball we've got a local team.

317
00:22:47,036 --> 00:22:50,456
Oh, the Yankees. Oh.

318
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,417
The Cougars they are not but they try hard.

319
00:23:02,218 --> 00:23:04,470
Strike!

320
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:10,309
Strike? Hey, ump! Shake your head,
your eyeballs are stuck!

321
00:23:10,392 --> 00:23:13,395
It was a ball! It was that far from the plate.

322
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:20,361
Little lady, will you let me umpire this game?
You've been on my back all night.

323
00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:24,073
- Mickey, you saw that pitch. It was a ball.
- It looked like it.

324
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:26,116
You're out of the game, Mantle.

325
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,536
What? Roger, how'd that pitch look?

326
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:31,539
- It could've missed the corner.
- You're out, Maris.

327
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:37,419
- Yogi.
- It's a perfect strike, the ump was right.

328
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:41,090
I don't like sarcasm, Berra.
You're out of the game too!

329
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:43,217
You can't do that!

330
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,344
Lady...

331
00:23:45,427 --> 00:23:48,806
- Where's the manager?
- I think he's hiding.

332
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:51,809
Oh! Ooh...

333
00:23:51,892 --> 00:23:54,979
I didn't mean to get
all those men thrown out.

334
00:23:55,062 --> 00:23:57,857
It proved they could win
without their starting line-up.

335
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,402
I always get that way at ball games.
I lose control.

336
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:03,529
Well, it's over now, we won.

337
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:06,907
I know just the place
where you could calm down.

338
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:09,285
- Where?
- My apartment.

339
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:31,182
It's not ready for a housewarming
but how do you like it?

340
00:24:31,265 --> 00:24:35,686
- It's beautiful up here.
- I might put in some walls over there.

341
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:40,482
And perhaps a ceiling,
just to give it that traditional touch.

342
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,610
That would be nice.

343
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:47,865
The, er, the living room will be there,

344
00:24:47,948 --> 00:24:49,992
and the bedroom there.

345
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:52,453
I think the bedroom should be there.

346
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:54,580
Wherever you say.

347
00:24:54,663 --> 00:24:56,707
And I love fireplaces.

348
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:01,128
There'll be one in every room.
And bookcases, I like books everywhere.

349
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:04,256
- And good reading lamps.
- That's the idea.

350
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,468
- Plenty of paintings.
- Mmm. And a built-in oven.

351
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:11,430
- And a sunken bathtub.
- Oh, I love taking sunken baths.

352
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:13,557
You'd always find me in it.

353
00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:18,979
I didn't mean it that way, I...

354
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:22,525
I know you didn't.
But let's not abandon the idea.

355
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:25,361
Cathy...

356
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:28,072
I've got to go to Bermuda for a few days.

357
00:25:28,155 --> 00:25:30,533
How would you like to join me there?

358
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:32,660
Then we could go on to Paris.

359
00:25:32,743 --> 00:25:36,080
- Have you ever been to Paris?
- No.

360
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:39,542
That's the best way to see it,
for the first time.

361
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:45,339
I know a restaurant in Paris where you can
get some marvellous French food.

362
00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:47,466
Then we'll go to Monte Carlo,

363
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:52,012
where I can get a friend to take us
for a cruise around the Greek islands.

364
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:55,516
That's the only way to see them -
slowly, by boat.

365
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,311
They're like fine paintings -
you mustn't rush up to them.

366
00:25:59,395 --> 00:26:04,275
We'll continue around the world, get back,
and this building will be finished.

367
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:09,405
If you don't like this apartment
you can have one of the others.

368
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:11,949
- May I ask one question?
- Go on.

369
00:26:12,032 --> 00:26:14,368
Did you just ask me to marry you?

370
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:16,162
No.

371
00:26:19,957 --> 00:26:22,877
- Oh.
- I didn't mean to mislead you.

372
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,004
Oh, you didn't.

373
00:26:26,338 --> 00:26:29,425
You're very honest and I admire you for that.

374
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:32,469
- Then you're not offended.
- No.

375
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:35,639
Well, then what is it?

376
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:39,268
I'm a little frightened of you.

377
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:43,397
Oh, I know many people
who can't stand me.

378
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,524
I can stand you all right.

379
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:48,444
Now, Cathy, if this presents a problem...

380
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:53,699
You know, Mr Shayne, I feel I can trust you.

381
00:26:53,782 --> 00:26:55,826
What would you advise me to do?

382
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,455
Oh, please, I'm hardly in a position
to give advice.

383
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:01,248
But I respect your opinion.

384
00:27:01,332 --> 00:27:05,419
That's like asking a man
to testify against himself.

385
00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:10,424
Cathy, you have rare qualities.
You're direct, sincere, uncomplicated,

386
00:27:10,508 --> 00:27:14,470
the type of woman who brings out
the worst in a man - his conscience.

387
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:17,598
Oh, I didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

388
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:19,725
It's rather disturbing.

389
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:25,022
See, a man's conscience is generally
in direct opposition to his best interests.

390
00:27:25,105 --> 00:27:29,026
And, in your best interests,
I'd better disqualify myself.

391
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:31,320
So this has to be your decision.

392
00:27:34,782 --> 00:27:36,075
There's only one decision.

393
00:27:37,034 --> 00:27:41,705
Get a lawyer, blackmail him, get a potful of
money and go to Bermuda without him.

394
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:45,960
You're condemning him
without even knowing him. You really are.

395
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:49,713
You should've heard
him speak to the United Nations.

396
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:53,759
Khrushchev spoke there too!
Would I let you go to Bermuda with him?

397
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:56,220
Connie, how can you compare them?

398
00:27:56,303 --> 00:28:00,891
All I know is this, he did not try to lure me
to Bermuda or anywhere else.

399
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:04,478
He was completely honest,
a perfect gentleman.

400
00:28:04,562 --> 00:28:08,899
A man meets you and in the same day
asks you to live with him?

401
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:12,695
I met a guy with a diamond stick pin
and a waxed moustache

402
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:15,239
and even he waited until the second date.

403
00:28:15,322 --> 00:28:18,576
If he's a perfect gentleman,
waxed moustache is Albert Schweitzer.

404
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,914
OK, answer me this - why didn't he try to
influence me when I asked for his advice?

405
00:28:23,998 --> 00:28:26,333
Because that's the way he operates.

406
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:30,546
Some guys ride the subways pinching girls,
he works out of a limousine.

407
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:32,047
But a pincher is a pincher.

408
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:35,885
Connie, I don't wanna hear
another word against him.

409
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,929
OK, if that's the way you feel about it.

410
00:28:40,472 --> 00:28:42,516
I tried.

411
00:28:44,435 --> 00:28:46,478
What's this?

412
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,734
Some woman
in Mr Shayne's office gave it to me.

413
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:54,445
Boy, has this guy got an organisation.

414
00:28:54,528 --> 00:28:57,406
He even has a medical plan for his victims!

415
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:03,245
Not another word.

416
00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:33,025
Connie.

417
00:29:35,277 --> 00:29:37,530
- Connie.
- Hmm? Huh?

418
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:40,825
What?

419
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:42,952
I think I'm in love.

420
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:48,123
Try to get some sleep, honey,
you'll feel better in the morning.

421
00:30:03,472 --> 00:30:05,307
Connie?

422
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:08,519
- Mmm?
- You sleeping?

423
00:30:14,817 --> 00:30:16,861
It's four o'clock.

424
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:19,280
Why would I be sleeping?

425
00:30:21,157 --> 00:30:23,909
I've made a decision.

426
00:30:23,993 --> 00:30:26,036
I'm not gonna go with him.

427
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,164
It's for the best.

428
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:35,296
- Connie?
- Mmm?

429
00:30:36,422 --> 00:30:40,926
When he calls, how do I tell him no
without hurting his feelings?

430
00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:49,268
Call this number,
you'll get some good suggestions.

431
00:30:58,235 --> 00:31:01,530
I wonder what shade of hair
I ought to wear this week.

432
00:31:01,614 --> 00:31:04,617
I didn't do too well as a blonde.

433
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,286
Raven. That wasn't bad.

434
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:09,413
I got whistled at by a bird.

435
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:13,834
Grey. Maybe they'll feel sorry for me.

436
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:28,224
Look, if you don't know how to tell him,
when he calls I'll talk to him.

437
00:31:28,307 --> 00:31:30,351
I'll talk to him.

438
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:36,482
But I just want to say it in a way that he won't
think it any personal reflection on him.

439
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:38,609
You're worried about him?

440
00:31:38,692 --> 00:31:41,403
Oh, boy, men really have this game beat.

441
00:31:42,404 --> 00:31:45,282
For 2,000 years we have had their children,

442
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:49,495
washed their clothes, cooked their meals
and cleaned their houses.

443
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:53,499
What do they give us in return?
The right to smoke in public.

444
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:55,626
We sold out for a cigarette.

445
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:57,753
And you don't even smoke.

446
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:02,049
Good morning, good morning!

447
00:32:02,132 --> 00:32:05,219
- It's a great day out.
- You're very happy, Roger.

448
00:32:05,302 --> 00:32:07,805
Check that with Dr Gruber,
it might be serious.

449
00:32:07,888 --> 00:32:12,059
I had a wonderful night's rest.
I've solved the trouble I have sleeping.

450
00:32:12,142 --> 00:32:16,647
Just before you go to bed, put three
tranquillisers in a jigger of brandy.

451
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,234
You still can't sleep
but you're so relaxed you don't care.

452
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:24,363
Fancy that. People who sleep
don't know what they're missing.

453
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:28,242
Here's your chance to analyse
the Harrington report.

454
00:32:29,118 --> 00:32:32,329
- 'Yes, Mr Shayne? '
- Did you call Miss Timberlake yet?

455
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:34,456
- 'No, sir.'
- Cancel it.

456
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,377
- Miss Timberlake?
- Yeah, the young lady from the automat.

457
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,713
- What happened with her?
- Nothing.

458
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:44,091
I've been wrestling
with my conscience all morning.

459
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:46,218
- And I lost.
- That's an upset.

460
00:32:46,302 --> 00:32:48,846
Her mother's a teacher,
father's a druggist,

461
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:51,807
brother's an eagle scout
and she sang in the church choir.

462
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:56,604
To take her to Bermuda is a desecration
of everything the Minutemen fought for.

463
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:58,898
- You asked her to go away with you?
- Yes.

464
00:32:58,981 --> 00:33:01,108
- But you're not gonna take her.
- No.

465
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:04,778
What a terrible thing to do to me.

466
00:33:04,862 --> 00:33:07,448
- To you?
- I've built this image of a man,

467
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:10,242
cold, ruthless, predatory,

468
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:14,830
now you go do a decent thing like this
to destroy that image.

469
00:33:14,914 --> 00:33:17,625
You've set me back years in my analysis.

470
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,543
Oh, I'm ashamed of myself.

471
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:25,090
Well, Roger, if I've done anything human,
I'll make it up to you.

472
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,595
Would it help if I fired
every employee over 60?

473
00:33:29,678 --> 00:33:31,722
No.

474
00:33:31,805 --> 00:33:36,185
Hey, wait a minute, take the wrapper off.
It's better that way.

475
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:41,106
11:30. He said he'd call
first thing in the morning.

476
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,194
Well, now you don't have to worry
about not hurting his feelings.

477
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:49,615
At least he should give me the courtesy
of hurting his feelings.

478
00:33:49,698 --> 00:33:53,202
A man picks you up off the street,
takes you to his office,

479
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:56,956
makes you take your clothes off
and propositions you.

480
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,626
- What can you expect from a man like that?
- Respect.

481
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:04,505
Respect.
On that note of logic, I'll go to work.

482
00:34:04,588 --> 00:34:08,384
He should've had the decency to call
and get my answer.

483
00:34:24,316 --> 00:34:28,863
Well, I'm not paying for you just to sit there.
Do something! Ring!

484
00:34:34,994 --> 00:34:36,829
Hello?

485
00:34:36,912 --> 00:34:40,166
Yes, I'll talk to her. Hello, Cathy.

486
00:34:40,249 --> 00:34:42,751
Weren't you supposed to call this morning?

487
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:46,755
I'm sorry, I didn't think I should
under the circumstances.

488
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,175
What circumstances?

489
00:34:49,258 --> 00:34:51,302
Cathy, I came to a decision.

490
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:54,680
I thought I was supposed
to make this decision.

491
00:34:54,763 --> 00:34:57,308
Yes, but considering the situation.

492
00:34:57,391 --> 00:34:59,435
What situation?

493
00:34:59,518 --> 00:35:03,022
Well, I'm sure Upper Sandusky
is a delightful town

494
00:35:03,105 --> 00:35:06,984
but it hardly prepares a girl
for this kind of situation.

495
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:10,654
I can see you don't know the girls
in Upper Sandusky.

496
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:14,033
- They're always prepared.
- I'm sure they are.

497
00:35:14,116 --> 00:35:16,660
We're not unsophisticated rustics.

498
00:35:16,744 --> 00:35:21,165
I'm not attacking you culturally. I'm sure
you have fine libraries and museums.

499
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:23,292
We also have a home for girls.

500
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:27,963
We may not be as large as New York
but we're just as progressive.

501
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:30,466
Last year we had a scandal
at the country club...

502
00:35:30,549 --> 00:35:34,845
- I'm sure it's a zippy little community.
- Things are hoppin' up there!

503
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:39,767
I apologise. I should have called you
and given you the opportunity of saying no.

504
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:44,063
- You certainly should have.
- And I respect that decision.

505
00:35:44,146 --> 00:35:46,565
- What decision?
- Not to go.

506
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:52,112
I hate to disappoint you, Mr Shayne,
but the answer is yes!

507
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:55,282
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure!

508
00:35:55,366 --> 00:35:58,077
- Unless you're thinking of backing...
- No.

509
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,664
I just suddenly see Upper Sandusky
in a new light.

510
00:36:01,747 --> 00:36:05,251
- Will I be hearing from you?
- As soon as I make the arrangements.

511
00:36:05,334 --> 00:36:07,586
- Thank you.
- Thank you for calling.

512
00:36:08,712 --> 00:36:11,382
Well, you heard. I tried to talk her out of it.

513
00:36:11,465 --> 00:36:17,221
No, I brought her to throw money in your
face. I delivered the sparrow to the hawk.

514
00:36:17,304 --> 00:36:21,433
The sparrow's flying south. She'll need
clothes so make the arrangements.

515
00:36:21,517 --> 00:36:24,812
No. I will not dress the victim for sacrifice.

516
00:36:24,895 --> 00:36:29,024
Bergdorf Goodman have a new line
of sacrificial evening gowns.

517
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:32,987
I have waited years to tell you
what you can do with your job,

518
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,823
your salary, bonuses and fringe benefits.

519
00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:38,367
- Yes, Roger?
- I've waited this long.

520
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:43,247
- And I can wait a little longer.
- Good. Wait over there, do it quietly.

521
00:36:44,206 --> 00:36:47,960
So he insulted Upper Sandusky,
this is no way to get even.

522
00:36:49,086 --> 00:36:51,630
You're carrying civic pride too far.

523
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:56,427
OK, if your mind's made up, fine.

524
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,554
Send postcards.

525
00:37:00,222 --> 00:37:02,266
Well, he did it.

526
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:04,393
Rasputin talked her into it.

527
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:10,482
Connie, look.

528
00:37:33,464 --> 00:37:35,299
- Miss Timberlake?
- Yes.

529
00:37:35,382 --> 00:37:38,594
They're waiting for you
at Bergdorf Goodman.

530
00:37:38,677 --> 00:37:42,097
- Who are you?
- Leonard. I'm assigned as coordinator.

531
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:46,227
Oh? What do you coordinate?

532
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,145
You.

533
00:39:49,517 --> 00:39:51,560
Thank you very much.

534
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:56,857
Oh, Connie, please stop crying.

535
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:59,151
I'm only going around the world.

536
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:01,987
I know.

537
00:40:02,988 --> 00:40:06,826
Oh, Cathy, you look so beautiful.

538
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,204
Just like a bride.

539
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:12,331
Oh, I'm sorry!

540
00:40:12,414 --> 00:40:15,292
Oh, Connie, I'm all right, really I am.

541
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:19,713
What can happen to me?

542
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,133
Oh, Connie, please, stop.

543
00:40:23,884 --> 00:40:25,928
Connie.

544
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:28,055
Please?

545
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,018
I'm all right now.

546
00:40:33,102 --> 00:40:36,313
Oh, Cathy, have a good trip.

547
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:40,192
Oh, I will. I'll write to you
as soon as I get to Bermuda.

548
00:40:41,735 --> 00:40:44,572
Oh, Cathy, you look lovely in that coat.

549
00:40:45,447 --> 00:40:47,992
You mother would be so proud of you...

550
00:40:48,075 --> 00:40:50,327
Oh, I'm so sorry!

551
00:40:53,914 --> 00:40:56,917
- Bye.
- Bye.

552
00:40:59,295 --> 00:41:01,338
Enjoy yourself.

553
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,633
I think.

554
00:41:17,229 --> 00:41:21,859
When she said she'd throw that money
in his face she became a symbol of hope.

555
00:41:21,942 --> 00:41:23,986
Look at her.

556
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:27,823
It's like watching Joan of Arc
on her way to the fire.

557
00:41:32,578 --> 00:41:35,706
'Good morning, welcome aboard flight 603.

558
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:41,212
'This is your pilot, Captain Miller.
Your copilot is Captain Saunders.

559
00:41:41,295 --> 00:41:45,966
'We will be cruising at 31,000 feet
at an average speed of 500 miles an hour.

560
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,594
'We hope you will have a pleasant trip.'

561
00:41:52,556 --> 00:41:55,434
- Are you comfortable, Miss Timberlake?
- Yes, thank you.

562
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:59,647
Is this the off season for Bermuda.
No, we're booked solid.

563
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,774
Mr Shayne bought every seat.

564
00:42:05,152 --> 00:42:07,196
Oh! It's all right.

565
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,945
Cathy, you're too much.
Here, let me take this.

566
00:42:48,028 --> 00:42:50,614
Mr Shayne, everything was so expensive.

567
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:53,909
I told Leonard not to spend so much
but he insisted.

568
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:56,745
- Who's Leonard?
- He works for you.

569
00:42:56,829 --> 00:42:59,165
- Oh, he does?
- He coordinated me.

570
00:42:59,248 --> 00:43:01,709
You know, he sort of put me together.

571
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:06,505
Well, no reflection on Leonard
but he merely put a frame on a Renoir.

572
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,854
Here's your key, Mr Shayne.

573
00:44:46,355 --> 00:44:48,607
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

574
00:44:50,276 --> 00:44:52,319
Come along.

575
00:45:04,415 --> 00:45:06,458
Stand there.

576
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:08,586
Don't move, don't go away.

577
00:45:14,258 --> 00:45:18,387
Nowhere else in the world can you see
beaches with pink sand.

578
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,265
Pirate ships used to anchor in that cove.

579
00:45:21,348 --> 00:45:26,645
Only pirates from the best families,
naturally. The others couldn't afford it.

580
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:40,493
There's the kitchen
in case you get hungry in the night.

581
00:45:40,576 --> 00:45:43,496
Oh, no. Once I get in bed I'm through.

582
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:45,623
I sleep like a rock.

583
00:45:45,706 --> 00:45:49,418
I wish I had that faculty.
Takes me hours to get to sleep.

584
00:45:49,502 --> 00:45:51,879
Have you tried hot milk and butter?

585
00:45:51,962 --> 00:45:54,256
No, I'm not that anxious to sleep.

586
00:46:02,848 --> 00:46:05,851
I want you to look at something.

587
00:46:05,935 --> 00:46:08,687
Have you ever seen anything like that?

588
00:46:09,939 --> 00:46:11,357
No.

589
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,319
It means so much more
when you can share it with someone.

590
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:19,573
How long will it take you to get ready?

591
00:46:19,657 --> 00:46:21,700
- For what?
- A swim.

592
00:46:21,784 --> 00:46:24,245
Shall we go to the pool? Can you swim?

593
00:46:24,328 --> 00:46:26,997
Oh, swim! That I can do.

594
00:46:27,081 --> 00:46:30,042
If you'd like to change,
I'll wait on the balcony.

595
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:34,630
No. A gentleman always allows
the lady to undress first.

596
00:46:57,403 --> 00:46:59,446
'She knows.'

597
00:47:23,095 --> 00:47:25,139
'They know.'

598
00:47:45,743 --> 00:47:47,786
'Everybody knows! '

599
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:09,016
I want to thank you for a wonderful day.

600
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:12,269
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Will I see you tomorrow?

601
00:48:12,353 --> 00:48:14,188
I imagine so.

602
00:48:14,271 --> 00:48:16,315
Good. Good night.

603
00:48:23,864 --> 00:48:25,950
I think I'm registered here.

604
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:28,285
Oh.

605
00:48:50,182 --> 00:48:52,226
Is there anything you'd like?

606
00:48:52,893 --> 00:48:54,937
How about a late movie?

607
00:48:55,729 --> 00:48:58,190
All the theatres are closed.

608
00:48:59,191 --> 00:49:02,820
- We can watch one on television.
- There is no television.

609
00:49:05,781 --> 00:49:08,617
What do people do here at night?

610
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:13,831
I mean, um, for entertainment.

611
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:16,500
I mean, um...

612
00:49:17,751 --> 00:49:20,713
to... pass the time.

613
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:24,175
They make up games, Cathy.

614
00:49:24,258 --> 00:49:26,594
Simple, fun games.

615
00:49:30,014 --> 00:49:32,057
Come over here.

616
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:37,396
Sit down.

617
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:42,318
Cathy, this is a very special place to me.

618
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:45,029
I've never brought a girl here before.

619
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:47,490
You're not sorry you came, are you?

620
00:49:52,286 --> 00:49:54,330
What are you doing?

621
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:56,457
I'm kissing you. Do you mind?

622
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:59,210
Not if you don't.

623
00:50:00,044 --> 00:50:03,756
Well, relax. I'll keep you informed
of my every move.

624
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:08,177
You have a beautiful back.

625
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,888
My mother always made me sit up straight.

626
00:50:10,971 --> 00:50:13,015
I'm grateful to your mother.

627
00:50:13,098 --> 00:50:15,309
And such attractive shoulders.

628
00:50:15,976 --> 00:50:18,854
Swimming was compulsory at high school.

629
00:50:18,938 --> 00:50:21,816
I'm grateful to the public school system.

630
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:24,944
There's so much to be grateful for.

631
00:50:25,027 --> 00:50:27,321
And so little time to be grateful.

632
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:56,433
Oh, I just remembered - I forgot
my toothbrush. I'd better go back for it.

633
00:50:57,184 --> 00:50:59,228
I always carry a spare.

634
00:50:59,311 --> 00:51:02,189
But it takes me months
to break in a new one.

635
00:51:02,273 --> 00:51:06,652
The Hindus use twigs,
they break them off the trees. We'll try that.

636
00:51:06,735 --> 00:51:09,947
- I'm going for a short walk.
- I'll go with you!

637
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:12,241
Stay here. Make yourself comfortable.

638
00:51:12,324 --> 00:51:15,911
Philip! There's something
you should know about me.

639
00:51:15,995 --> 00:51:18,289
I have an uncle who's a socialist.

640
00:51:18,372 --> 00:51:23,335
I respect you for telling me
but what we have transcends all politics.

641
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:49,820
- Hi.
- Hello.

642
00:51:49,904 --> 00:51:52,865
Er, my name's Harry Clark.

643
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:56,243
Philip Shayne.

644
00:51:57,995 --> 00:52:00,456
I just got married this afternoon.

645
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:03,626
Congratulations.
How do you like married life?

646
00:52:03,709 --> 00:52:05,461
I don't know yet.

647
00:52:09,924 --> 00:52:11,967
I, er, came out for a smoke.

648
00:52:13,344 --> 00:52:16,931
I thought I'd give Marie-Anne
some time to, er...

649
00:52:18,891 --> 00:52:23,020
Well, what is a decent interval
for a fella to stay away?

650
00:52:23,103 --> 00:52:25,272
How long have you been out here?

651
00:52:26,398 --> 00:52:29,610
- Two hours.
- That's as decent as you can get.

652
00:52:30,778 --> 00:52:32,822
Marie-Anne's kinda shy.

653
00:52:33,948 --> 00:52:38,869
I mean, psychologically,
I want her to feel secure.

654
00:52:39,745 --> 00:52:41,789
Harry?

655
00:52:43,249 --> 00:52:45,417
She sounds secure.

656
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:48,838
Well, awfully nice to have met you.
G- Good night.

657
00:53:07,189 --> 00:53:09,316
Oh, good evening.

658
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,443
Good evening.

659
00:53:14,488 --> 00:53:19,118
- Do we know each other?
- I'm Dr Richardson, the hotel physician.

660
00:53:19,201 --> 00:53:21,537
- Oh.
- I wouldn't go in just yet.

661
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:25,666
- What happened?
- The lady called to ask if we'd any sedatives

662
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:28,377
and she sounded agitated so I came up.

663
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,339
- Is she all right?
- Nothing serious, just a case of nerves.

664
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:36,594
May I ask a personal question, Mr Shayne?

665
00:53:36,677 --> 00:53:39,972
- Sure, go ahead.
- Is that Mrs Shayne in there?

666
00:53:40,055 --> 00:53:41,765
Er...

667
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:43,517
no.

668
00:53:43,601 --> 00:53:48,397
That's strange, this reaction
is more common amongst married women.

669
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:57,156
- Is he back yet?
- Yes.

670
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:00,993
Don't let him come in!
I don't want him to see me like this.

671
00:54:01,076 --> 00:54:02,786
I won't.

672
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:05,581
All of a sudden I started breaking out.

673
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:10,169
I always get rashes when I'm nervous.

674
00:54:10,252 --> 00:54:12,671
The ointment will take care of that.

675
00:54:12,755 --> 00:54:14,798
Here, take this.

676
00:54:19,595 --> 00:54:22,723
And get some sleep.
I'll stop by in the morning.

677
00:54:22,806 --> 00:54:26,352
Thank you. Oh, Doctor!
Don't tell him about the rash.

678
00:54:26,435 --> 00:54:30,815
- Tell him I had a stroke or something.
- I'll be discreet.

679
00:54:31,732 --> 00:54:33,234
Oh!

680
00:54:36,821 --> 00:54:40,199
- How is she?
- Fine. Needs a good night's rest.

681
00:54:40,282 --> 00:54:42,159
Uninterrupted.

682
00:54:42,243 --> 00:54:43,702
Naturally.

683
00:54:43,786 --> 00:54:47,164
Had a case in 207 last week,
honeymoon couple.

684
00:54:47,248 --> 00:54:50,543
Lovely girl, barricaded herself
in the bathroom.

685
00:54:50,626 --> 00:54:53,838
Claimed her husband
was making advances toward her.

686
00:54:53,921 --> 00:54:58,175
- The man should be horsewhipped.
- They're just not prepared.

687
00:54:58,259 --> 00:55:01,303
We give them one semester
of home economics

688
00:55:01,387 --> 00:55:03,848
and expect Madame DuBarry.

689
00:55:16,694 --> 00:55:18,737
Mr Shayne?

690
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:22,533
Yes, Cathy?

691
00:55:22,616 --> 00:55:25,953
- Mr Shayne, I'm sorry.
- You couldn't help it.

692
00:55:26,036 --> 00:55:30,291
But I don't want to ruin your evening.
You go out without me.

693
00:55:30,374 --> 00:55:32,293
It wouldn't be the same.

694
00:55:32,376 --> 00:55:35,504
Don't worry. We'll go back
to New York in the morning.

695
00:55:35,588 --> 00:55:38,090
I know you've gone to great expense.

696
00:55:38,174 --> 00:55:41,468
Plane, hotels, meals, tips...

697
00:55:41,552 --> 00:55:44,555
If you add it all up,
I'll be glad to pay half of it.

698
00:55:44,638 --> 00:55:47,016
We'll figure it out in the morning.

699
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:50,644
Now, you get a good night's sleep,
I'll be on the couch.

700
00:55:50,728 --> 00:55:53,522
If you wake up and need anything,
just call me.

701
00:55:53,606 --> 00:55:56,609
I won't wake up.
Once I get in bed, I'm through.

702
00:55:56,692 --> 00:55:58,402
Yes, I know.

703
00:55:58,486 --> 00:56:01,363
- Will you be all right on the couch?
- Fine!

704
00:56:01,447 --> 00:56:06,577
If you have trouble falling asleep,
don't forget the hot milk and butter.

705
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,704
This may be the night for it.

706
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,666
- Good night.
- Good night.

707
00:56:13,876 --> 00:56:16,629
- Oh, Mr Shayne!
- Yes, Cathy?

708
00:56:18,088 --> 00:56:21,759
I just want you to know that, sick as I am,

709
00:56:21,842 --> 00:56:25,179
this has been
the most wonderful day of my life.

710
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:27,097
I'll never forget it.

711
00:56:28,224 --> 00:56:30,267
Neither will I.

712
00:57:02,633 --> 00:57:04,718
Having trouble, too, huh?

713
00:57:04,802 --> 00:57:06,095
Well...

714
00:57:06,178 --> 00:57:10,224
Before you give them the mink coat
they all talk a big game.

715
00:57:10,307 --> 00:57:14,061
Now the lady gets headaches,
she prefers to be alone.

716
00:57:15,271 --> 00:57:18,190
- What did you do?
- I belted her.

717
00:57:18,274 --> 00:57:20,317
How about you?

718
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:22,444
Right across the chops.

719
00:57:22,528 --> 00:57:26,407
- We got a lot in common.
- We could pass for brothers.

720
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,659
Deal the cards.

721
00:57:30,995 --> 00:57:33,247
- Watch it, I cheat.
- So do I.

722
00:57:35,374 --> 00:57:40,838
And in view of its growth potential, I strongly
recommend purchase of said stock.

723
00:57:40,921 --> 00:57:44,842
Send a copy to Mr Shayne,
Victoria Hotel, Bermuda.

724
00:57:44,925 --> 00:57:47,678
- Yes, sir.
- Just a moment, Miss Jones.

725
00:57:48,971 --> 00:57:52,975
I've been very curious about
something for years.

726
00:57:53,058 --> 00:57:55,853
- Would you let your hair down?
- What?

727
00:57:55,936 --> 00:57:57,980
Let your hair down.

728
00:58:06,322 --> 00:58:08,574
Now take your glasses off.

729
00:58:11,827 --> 00:58:15,080
Strange, always seems to work
in the movies.

730
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:21,295
- Miss Jones, do you see what I see?
- Where?

731
00:58:21,378 --> 00:58:25,132
It's a miracle. Joan of Arc put out the fire.

732
00:58:35,184 --> 00:58:38,062
- Things went pretty badly?
- Pretty badly.

733
00:58:38,145 --> 00:58:41,440
- It was a disaster?
- That's what I like about you,

734
00:58:41,524 --> 00:58:45,569
no matter what calamity befalls others,
you can still laugh about it.

735
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:50,658
It's a victory for the little people. How often
does the sparrow down the hawk?

736
00:58:50,741 --> 00:58:53,828
The baron of the boudoir
shot down over Bermuda.

737
00:58:53,911 --> 00:58:58,082
- It had to happen sooner or later.
- I knew she was no ordinary woman.

738
00:58:58,165 --> 00:59:01,627
- She proved that all right.
- Something about her,

739
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,712
purity, innocence, honour.

740
00:59:03,796 --> 00:59:08,300
- All virtues that drive a man to drink.
- What a lift this is for me.

741
00:59:08,384 --> 00:59:11,887
There'll be dancing in
Dr Gruber's office today.

742
00:59:13,389 --> 00:59:18,060
Excuse me, sir. Miss Timberlake
asked me to return these things to you.

743
00:59:18,144 --> 00:59:20,146
Thank you, Collins.

744
00:59:20,229 --> 00:59:22,731
Why do that?
Why didn't she just keep them?

745
00:59:22,815 --> 00:59:24,608
It upsets you, doesn't it?

746
00:59:24,692 --> 00:59:29,822
The puppet master ran across a puppet who
won't perform and then cuts all his strings.

747
00:59:29,905 --> 00:59:34,577
She's become a symbol of hope to
all of us who sold out for that touch of mink.

748
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,036
Roger!

749
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,540
You give us good salaries,
paid vacations, insurance,

750
00:59:39,623 --> 00:59:43,335
you take away our problems
and act like you've done us a favour.

751
00:59:43,419 --> 00:59:46,672
Well, you haven't
and some day there'll be an uprising

752
00:59:46,755 --> 00:59:50,342
and the masses will regain
the misery they're entitled to.

753
00:59:50,426 --> 00:59:54,972
Neurotics of the world unite. You have
nothing to lose but your psychiatrist.

754
00:59:55,055 --> 00:59:59,310
Roger, I flew 800 miles
to a tropical paradise

755
00:59:59,393 --> 01:00:01,437
to drink hot milk and butter.

756
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:06,567
I spent half the night playing gin rummy
with a bookie. Not a memorable evening.

757
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:09,570
If you don't leave now, I'll raise your salary.

758
01:00:09,653 --> 01:00:11,864
You're sadistic enough to do that.

759
01:00:11,947 --> 01:00:15,242
If Miss Timberlake is your hope,
you get together with her.

760
01:00:15,326 --> 01:00:18,746
You, she and Dr Gruber
will make a lovely couple.

761
01:00:32,551 --> 01:00:37,431
You go back home for a few days
and see your family, you'll feel better.

762
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:41,685
I don't want to feel better. I don't deserve it.

763
01:00:42,812 --> 01:00:47,608
I was afraid of him.
I thought I wasn't good enough for him.

764
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:49,860
Afraid I'd disappoint him.

765
01:00:49,944 --> 01:00:53,614
So? You weren't asking for
a letter of recommendation.

766
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:57,535
The minute he bolted that door I got panicky.

767
01:00:57,618 --> 01:01:01,580
Of course. You're alone in a hotel room
with a strange man,

768
01:01:01,664 --> 01:01:03,916
what would the average girl do?

769
01:01:03,999 --> 01:01:09,380
Forget about the average girl, somebody as
sensitive as you are is bound to get nervous.

770
01:01:09,463 --> 01:01:13,175
Nervous? I broke out in a rash.

771
01:01:13,259 --> 01:01:15,135
I know, I know.

772
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:17,972
I had exactly the same experience once.

773
01:01:18,055 --> 01:01:23,102
This fellow and I stopped off
at a roadside inn - never forget it.

774
01:01:23,185 --> 01:01:26,355
Started shaking like a leaf,
broke out in boils.

775
01:01:26,438 --> 01:01:30,276
He was so sick I had to drive him home.
It happens to everybody.

776
01:01:31,402 --> 01:01:33,612
He was so understanding about it.

777
01:01:33,696 --> 01:01:35,739
He didn't even get upset.

778
01:01:36,866 --> 01:01:38,909
He just smiled.

779
01:01:38,993 --> 01:01:41,453
It was so awful!

780
01:01:41,537 --> 01:01:44,331
If only he'd got mad or yelled or hit me.

781
01:01:44,415 --> 01:01:48,544
- Men are so inconsiderate.
- And all that money he spent on me,

782
01:01:48,627 --> 01:01:51,547
he can't even deduct it, it's humiliating.

783
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:52,965
What is?

784
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:57,052
I'm not even important enough
to be a tax loss.

785
01:02:02,892 --> 01:02:05,895
- Good morning, Roger.
- Morning, Doctor.

786
01:02:09,565 --> 01:02:11,484
It's good to be home.

787
01:02:11,567 --> 01:02:14,987
How are things in the investment world?
Any good tips?

788
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:19,700
A new stock issue, Consolidated Wire.
It's a great buy if you get in fast.

789
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:25,456
I still haven't heard from my mother, not that
it bothers me but it has been two days.

790
01:02:25,539 --> 01:02:29,752
I know what's wrong, she's in a snit.
I forgot Grandpa's birthday.

791
01:02:29,835 --> 01:02:32,463
She has a real problem with her father.

792
01:02:32,546 --> 01:02:34,757
Let her analyst worry about that.

793
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:40,221
Doc, an exciting thing happened,
I think I'm about to make a breakthrough.

794
01:02:41,472 --> 01:02:45,309
I made a great discovery,
Philip Shayne is just a man!

795
01:02:45,392 --> 01:02:47,436
It took a woman to prove it.

796
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:52,566
There's this girl, let's call her...
Cathy Timberlake...

797
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:57,029
Walter? Dr Gruber.
What's Consolidated Wire?

798
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:00,282
12 and a half.

799
01:03:00,366 --> 01:03:02,493
Buy me... 500 shares.

800
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:05,913
Yes, I got it from the usual source.

801
01:03:05,996 --> 01:03:08,958
The way she stood up to him was inspiring.

802
01:03:09,041 --> 01:03:13,254
I kept thinking what would I have done
if I were in her shoes.

803
01:03:13,337 --> 01:03:15,381
Unemployed, no money.

804
01:03:17,716 --> 01:03:22,012
This very wealthy man
sees me walking down the street,

805
01:03:22,096 --> 01:03:24,598
he's terribly attracted to me.

806
01:03:24,682 --> 01:03:29,395
Had me brought up to his office,
I have to admit he's quite charming.

807
01:03:29,478 --> 01:03:33,065
After the usual preliminaries -
dinner and dancing -

808
01:03:33,149 --> 01:03:36,569
- he invites me to Bermuda.
- Just like that?

809
01:03:36,652 --> 01:03:40,823
This is a forceful man,
accustomed to getting his own way.

810
01:03:40,906 --> 01:03:42,491
Uh-huh.

811
01:03:42,575 --> 01:03:45,953
Get given a complete wardrobe,
including a mink coat,

812
01:03:46,036 --> 01:03:50,875
flown to Bermuda, taken to the best suite,
this man offers everything.

813
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:53,252
Excitement, comfort, security.

814
01:03:53,335 --> 01:03:57,131
Believe me, Doc, it's not easy
to turn down an offer like that.

815
01:03:57,214 --> 01:03:59,258
No, it's not.

816
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:02,219
Roger, something
quite urgent has come up.

817
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:05,472
- Would you mind cutting the session short?
- No.

818
01:04:05,556 --> 01:04:09,393
I want to see you in the morning.
We should examine this new development.

819
01:04:09,477 --> 01:04:12,438
- Exciting, isn't it?
- Yes, that's...

820
01:04:12,521 --> 01:04:14,857
quite a breakthrough you've made.

821
01:04:15,399 --> 01:04:19,695
Walter, Dr Gruber.
Cancel that order for Consolidated Wire.

822
01:04:19,778 --> 01:04:25,159
My informant has developed instabilities
which make his judgement questionable.

823
01:04:27,077 --> 01:04:29,538
Tell me when you're coming back
and I'll meet you.

824
01:04:29,622 --> 01:04:35,085
- I will. Better hurry, you'll be late for work.
- I know. Have a good trip. Bye.

825
01:04:42,885 --> 01:04:44,887
Bye.

826
01:04:46,013 --> 01:04:49,433
Cathy! How did you miss the bus?
You were on it.

827
01:04:49,517 --> 01:04:51,393
I've changed my mind.

828
01:04:51,477 --> 01:04:54,814
- We can still catch it.
- I've got to go back there.

829
01:04:54,897 --> 01:04:59,568
You are the husband, four children
and a cottage type, this isn't you.

830
01:04:59,652 --> 01:05:02,655
You got lucky once,
it may not be a rash this time.

831
01:05:02,738 --> 01:05:07,827
I can't let him think of me as I was last night.
I want him to remember me as a woman.

832
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:11,622
It's important to me,
I've got to prove to him I'm a woman.

833
01:05:11,705 --> 01:05:14,375
There are easier ways to prove it.

834
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:16,502
Send him your birth certificate.

835
01:05:20,464 --> 01:05:25,219
Mr Shayne, a long-distance phone call.
It came through from your office.

836
01:05:25,302 --> 01:05:27,638
- Who is it? Do you know?
- No, sir.

837
01:05:27,721 --> 01:05:29,807
All right. Thank you, Mario.

838
01:05:30,933 --> 01:05:34,395
- Hello?
- Philip, this is Cathy.

839
01:05:35,563 --> 01:05:37,606
'Guess where I am.'

840
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:39,191
Disneyland?

841
01:05:39,275 --> 01:05:42,820
Bermuda. At the hotel.

842
01:05:42,903 --> 01:05:44,697
What are you doing there?

843
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,116
Waiting for you.

844
01:05:48,325 --> 01:05:53,080
I already have plans for the evening.
I have a few things to catch up on.

845
01:05:53,164 --> 01:05:56,292
You could be here in two hours.

846
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:59,879
And I have a board meeting early tomorrow.

847
01:06:04,091 --> 01:06:07,636
Is that what you'd rather see
first thing in the morning?

848
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:13,434
That is something to think about.

849
01:06:13,517 --> 01:06:16,854
And it's all just two hours away.

850
01:06:16,937 --> 01:06:18,981
Er, just a minute.

851
01:06:19,064 --> 01:06:23,360
Isabella, I have
a hypothetical question to ask you.

852
01:06:23,444 --> 01:06:27,740
Darling, what would you do
if the situation were reversed?

853
01:06:27,823 --> 01:06:29,617
Grazie.

854
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,577
I'm on my way.

855
01:06:47,092 --> 01:06:50,387
Sorry to keep you this late
but just one more letter.

856
01:06:50,471 --> 01:06:54,225
To the Dean of Economics Department,
Princeton University.

857
01:06:54,308 --> 01:06:57,061
Dear Arnold, after an absence of six years

858
01:06:57,144 --> 01:07:01,524
I'm happy to announce I will soon be
returning to the academic world.

859
01:07:01,607 --> 01:07:05,986
It is my intention to fill the void
created by my leaving...

860
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:08,155
- Oh, Collins.
- Yes, sir?

861
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:11,534
- Taking everything back?
- Oh, no, the airport.

862
01:07:11,617 --> 01:07:16,288
Mr Shayne is flying to Bermuda.
He's meeting Miss Timberlake.

863
01:07:16,372 --> 01:07:18,207
Oh.

864
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:20,334
Thank you.

865
01:07:29,593 --> 01:07:33,722
Thank you, Miss Jones.
We'll finish in the morning.

866
01:07:33,806 --> 01:07:36,058
- Good night.
- Good night.

867
01:07:40,312 --> 01:07:45,067
Dr Gruber? Roger. I hate to bother you
but something's come up.

868
01:07:45,151 --> 01:07:48,362
- Remember what I told you this morning?
- 'Yes.'

869
01:07:48,445 --> 01:07:51,615
- It's happening again.
- 'A trip to Bermuda? '

870
01:07:51,699 --> 01:07:53,534
Yes, tonight.

871
01:08:05,796 --> 01:08:08,048
You don't scare me.

872
01:08:40,164 --> 01:08:43,167
- Good evening, Mr Shayne.
- Good evening.

873
01:08:58,724 --> 01:09:00,559
Cathy.

874
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:09,860
Cathy?

875
01:09:10,402 --> 01:09:11,779
Cathy.

876
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:19,203
Cathy!

877
01:09:20,746 --> 01:09:22,790
Hi!

878
01:09:30,381 --> 01:09:33,092
See... no rash.

879
01:09:36,011 --> 01:09:38,055
Well, that's something.

880
01:09:45,062 --> 01:09:47,523
Cathy. Cathy...

881
01:09:47,606 --> 01:09:50,818
Cathy! Did you drink this whole bottle?

882
01:09:50,901 --> 01:09:52,987
Beats hot milk and butter.

883
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:55,281
Oh, for...

884
01:09:55,364 --> 01:09:57,408
Come on, girl. Come on.

885
01:09:57,491 --> 01:09:59,535
Come on, let's sit up.

886
01:09:59,618 --> 01:10:02,454
There's a good girl. Sit up. That's right.

887
01:10:03,581 --> 01:10:07,084
- Are you glad you came here?
- Delighted. Come on.

888
01:10:07,168 --> 01:10:10,087
I bet you never expected
to hear from me again.

889
01:10:10,171 --> 01:10:12,298
Oh, I had a premonition.

890
01:10:12,381 --> 01:10:14,425
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah!

891
01:10:14,592 --> 01:10:16,510
Good.

892
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:21,640
- I'm a real woman, huh?
- Yeah, irresistible.

893
01:10:21,724 --> 01:10:23,767
Now, try to walk.

894
01:10:23,851 --> 01:10:25,978
That's the idea.

895
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:28,355
There you are, that's right.

896
01:10:29,607 --> 01:10:32,026
Do you like the way I walk?

897
01:10:32,109 --> 01:10:34,278
You're poetry in motion.

898
01:10:34,361 --> 01:10:36,739
- I learned when I was a baby.
- Uh-huh.

899
01:10:36,822 --> 01:10:39,158
- I been walking for years.
- Oh.

900
01:10:40,451 --> 01:10:42,495
Oh, dear.

901
01:10:44,371 --> 01:10:47,625
- Have you been drinking?
- Not yet.

902
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:50,127
Right, come on.

903
01:10:51,879 --> 01:10:54,757
There. Now, just stand there, don't move.

904
01:10:55,883 --> 01:10:57,927
Are you nervous?

905
01:10:58,969 --> 01:11:00,846
Petrified.

906
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:05,100
Now, take a breath of fresh air.
Come on, take a deep breath.

907
01:11:07,728 --> 01:11:10,272
Is that good? Fine... Oop!

908
01:11:10,356 --> 01:11:12,942
Now, just stand there. That's right.

909
01:11:14,443 --> 01:11:17,238
I'll call down and get some coffee.

910
01:11:17,321 --> 01:11:19,406
Room service, please. Hurry.

911
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:24,954
Hello, this is Philip Shayne.
Send up some hot coffee right away.

912
01:11:25,037 --> 01:11:27,081
As much as you can carry.

913
01:11:27,164 --> 01:11:30,334
I need a chaser for a fifth of Scotch. Yes, I...

914
01:11:38,384 --> 01:11:41,220
Don't move! Lie there.

915
01:11:41,303 --> 01:11:43,180
Oh, dear.

916
01:11:48,477 --> 01:11:52,398
I fell out of Mr Shayne's suite.
See that I'm returned.

917
01:11:52,481 --> 01:11:57,153
Luckily, the canopy broke her fall.
Nothing but a sprained wrist.

918
01:11:57,236 --> 01:12:01,115
- Where's Mr Shayne?
- Wandered off. Seems to be in shock.

919
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:05,035
Can't say I blame him,
the girl's hysterical one evening

920
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,580
and plunges off his balcony the next.

921
01:12:07,663 --> 01:12:11,625
Their relationship does
leave something to be desired.

922
01:12:14,128 --> 01:12:16,380
- Hi.
- Hi.

923
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:23,512
- I thought you left this morning.
- I did. Flew back.

924
01:12:23,596 --> 01:12:25,806
How's the little lady?

925
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:28,309
Got another headache. How's yours?

926
01:12:28,392 --> 01:12:30,394
Got loaded. Fell off the balcony.

927
01:12:30,478 --> 01:12:34,231
I'm glad I book horses.
Who can handicap women?

928
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:37,151
- Can't win.
- Why do we keep betting on them?

929
01:12:37,234 --> 01:12:41,697
It's like Adam said about Eve -
"It's better than apples."

930
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:43,949
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

931
01:12:44,033 --> 01:12:46,076
Deal the cards.

932
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:54,502
Thank you. Miss Jones, look!

933
01:12:58,255 --> 01:13:00,466
The hawk has crashed again.

934
01:13:00,549 --> 01:13:06,680
Call Dr Gruber. Cancel my appointment.
Tell him things worked out well in Bermuda.

935
01:13:06,764 --> 01:13:11,894
You can't just sit there for
the rest of your life staring out the window.

936
01:13:13,187 --> 01:13:17,650
Catherine, darling, look.
I've baked you a kugel. Eat.

937
01:13:17,733 --> 01:13:19,735
You need strength to suffer.

938
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:22,571
Believe me, no man is worth it.

939
01:13:22,655 --> 01:13:26,909
You'll see, you'll get a job, work for 20 years

940
01:13:26,992 --> 01:13:29,995
and then you'll get a pension,
who needs him?

941
01:13:32,331 --> 01:13:33,958
Well, say something.

942
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:36,502
I just wanna die.

943
01:13:37,795 --> 01:13:42,967
- Did you hear that? She wants to die.
- Maybe it'll make her feel better.

944
01:13:45,261 --> 01:13:47,304
No, no. Don't call one.

945
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:53,936
We better wait. I had a traumatic experience
driving in the rain the other day.

946
01:13:54,019 --> 01:13:57,815
- Anything serious?
- No, just left me a little puddle-shy.

947
01:13:57,898 --> 01:13:59,942
Let me ask you a question.

948
01:14:00,025 --> 01:14:03,362
If you saw a stray kitten,
helpless but very appealing,

949
01:14:03,445 --> 01:14:07,616
and every time you tried to pet it
you got scratched, would you avoid it?

950
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,828
- Naturally.
- Yet you can't leave it to starve,

951
01:14:10,911 --> 01:14:14,206
you've got a moral obligation
to help it survive.

952
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:18,169
- What does this kitten do?
- Works a computing machine.

953
01:14:18,252 --> 01:14:22,047
We own American Credit Card,
they use those machines.

954
01:14:22,131 --> 01:14:25,009
Arrange for a job but keep my name out of it.

955
01:14:25,092 --> 01:14:29,054
- How do we contact this kitten?
- With extreme caution.

956
01:14:30,514 --> 01:14:35,311
Don't worry, you go to work.
I'll check and see that she's all right.

957
01:14:35,394 --> 01:14:37,980
Boy, if I ever run across him again.

958
01:14:53,287 --> 01:14:56,707
- Excuse me, could you tell me...
- With pleasure.

959
01:15:08,093 --> 01:15:10,304
- What's wrong?
- It's him.

960
01:15:10,387 --> 01:15:12,431
You...!

961
01:15:21,148 --> 01:15:22,817
What happened?

962
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,444
Don't ask, get Herman.

963
01:15:25,528 --> 01:15:28,155
Herman. Herman!

964
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:30,366
Herman, come here.

965
01:15:30,449 --> 01:15:31,867
Get him!

966
01:15:46,423 --> 01:15:48,217
What happened?

967
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:52,429
I was knocked down two flights of stairs
and attacked by a dog.

968
01:15:53,764 --> 01:15:56,851
This has been the
most satisfying day of my life.

969
01:15:56,934 --> 01:15:58,686
What started it?

970
01:15:58,769 --> 01:16:02,731
When the cab crashed and
the women started hitting me, I found out.

971
01:16:02,815 --> 01:16:06,735
They had nothing against me,
they thought they were hitting you.

972
01:16:06,819 --> 01:16:11,240
Before I go to the hospital I wanted you
to see what people think of you.

973
01:16:11,323 --> 01:16:13,742
And you deserved everything I got.

974
01:16:18,622 --> 01:16:20,666
I wonder what I've done.

975
01:16:22,418 --> 01:16:24,336
The whole world's on credit

976
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:29,216
and I'm going with a man who won't
get married till he can pay for it in cash.

977
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:34,054
I told him people charge everything -
hotels, department stores.

978
01:16:34,138 --> 01:16:36,557
Some places won't even take money.

979
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,895
One of these days they'll even
charge funerals - die now, pay later.

980
01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:50,946
Stanley's cousin's in town.
We could make it a foursome tonight.

981
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:55,534
Thanks, but I have to start billing
the New England area tomorrow.

982
01:16:55,618 --> 01:16:58,245
I need to memorise these code numbers.

983
01:16:58,329 --> 01:17:02,541
Well, that'll be more interesting
than Stanley's cousin.

984
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:04,919
- See you in the morning.
- Night.

985
01:17:07,838 --> 01:17:10,841
How do you like working here,
Miss Timberlake?

986
01:17:10,925 --> 01:17:13,469
Fine, thank you. I just hope I do well.

987
01:17:13,552 --> 01:17:18,516
And if you don't, who's going to fire you?
My friend works in personnel.

988
01:17:18,599 --> 01:17:23,604
When the call came from Mr Shayne's
office to hire you it was like panicsville.

989
01:17:23,687 --> 01:17:27,191
Have you ever seen
a herd of vice presidents stampede?

990
01:17:27,274 --> 01:17:29,860
Mr Shayne recommended me for this job?

991
01:17:29,944 --> 01:17:34,573
Recommended? Honey, you are in
for a labour-management relationship

992
01:17:34,657 --> 01:17:36,867
Walter Reuther never dreamed of.

993
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:40,830
If you sneeze, they tear out
the air conditioning system.

994
01:17:40,913 --> 01:17:43,582
Well, that's life.

995
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:45,918
I'm glad one of us girls made it.

996
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:57,847
You don't have to
feel sorry for me, Mr Shayne.

997
01:17:57,930 --> 01:18:00,766
I'll get my own job. I don't need your help.

998
01:18:01,892 --> 01:18:05,813
If I never work again,
at least I've done it on my own.

999
01:18:05,896 --> 01:18:09,233
I'm not like these machines
where you push a button

1000
01:18:09,316 --> 01:18:11,485
and it does what you want it to do.

1001
01:18:11,569 --> 01:18:14,697
Push all you want,
you're not gonna push my buttons.

1002
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:17,116
I'm not a robot, I'm people.

1003
01:18:18,242 --> 01:18:19,827
And I quit!

1004
01:18:45,269 --> 01:18:47,813
- Telephone, Mr Shayne.
- Thank you, Mario.

1005
01:18:49,565 --> 01:18:51,609
Hello?

1006
01:18:53,152 --> 01:18:55,279
She did what to the machines?

1007
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:58,240
I'll be right there.

1008
01:18:59,241 --> 01:19:02,870
This is how I found it
when the night watchman called me.

1009
01:19:02,953 --> 01:19:07,458
It's awful. Buffalo gone.
Hartford, Connecticut almost wiped out.

1010
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:09,585
31,000 accounts.

1011
01:19:10,878 --> 01:19:14,590
This man had breakfast
at a Howard Johnson drive-in,

1012
01:19:14,673 --> 01:19:16,967
he's being billed for $128,000.

1013
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:20,346
Hm, it's that second cup of coffee
that gets you.

1014
01:19:20,429 --> 01:19:22,973
It'll take weeks to straighten out.

1015
01:19:23,057 --> 01:19:25,267
Do the best you can.

1016
01:19:25,351 --> 01:19:29,188
It's sabotage! She's an undercover agent
for the Diners Club.

1017
01:19:29,271 --> 01:19:32,525
No. No, I'm the one who placed
this atom bomb here.

1018
01:19:32,608 --> 01:19:35,528
I should have dropped her over the desert.

1019
01:19:37,488 --> 01:19:39,615
I've no one to blame but myself.

1020
01:19:39,698 --> 01:19:45,788
I felt sorry for this helpless kitten. Helpless?
She ought to be declared a disaster area.

1021
01:19:45,871 --> 01:19:50,960
- She's not the run-of-the-mill girl, is she?
- No. Even Darwin never figured on her.

1022
01:19:51,043 --> 01:19:54,213
The Four Horsemen
now have a riding companion.

1023
01:19:54,296 --> 01:19:58,968
There's War, Famine, Death,
Pestilence and Miss Timberlake.

1024
01:19:59,051 --> 01:20:02,847
Sir, this special delivery letter
just came for you.

1025
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,765
Thank you.

1026
01:20:04,849 --> 01:20:07,476
- It's from her.
- Open it.

1027
01:20:08,602 --> 01:20:12,356
- I should put it in a tub of water.
- Go on, open it.

1028
01:20:13,482 --> 01:20:16,026
Calm down, I'm opening it.

1029
01:20:18,195 --> 01:20:20,322
"Dear sir,

1030
01:20:20,406 --> 01:20:26,036
"Enclosed is an itemised statement of
all expenses incurred by you on my behalf.

1031
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:30,875
"This includes plane fare, hotel,
meals, tips and doctor's bills,

1032
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:34,128
"which comes to a total of $729.40.

1033
01:20:34,211 --> 01:20:38,924
"It is only an estimate.
If your figure differs, please let me know.

1034
01:20:39,008 --> 01:20:42,386
"Enclosed is money order
covering first payment."

1035
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:45,347
- Three dollars?
- That's integrity.

1036
01:20:45,431 --> 01:20:49,435
"You will receive a money order
for a similar amount each week

1037
01:20:49,518 --> 01:20:52,480
"until the entire obligation is discharged.

1038
01:20:52,563 --> 01:20:57,318
"With best wishes for
your continued success, Cathy Timberlake."

1039
01:20:57,401 --> 01:21:00,154
What a future, three dollars a week for life.

1040
01:21:00,237 --> 01:21:04,283
- I think it's touching. She has character.
- She's a menace.

1041
01:21:04,366 --> 01:21:08,078
Roger, I'm a man who leads
an orderly life, you know that.

1042
01:21:08,162 --> 01:21:10,789
I close doors and tighten bottle tops.

1043
01:21:10,873 --> 01:21:14,793
Miss Timberlake is a bottle
wandering around with a loose top.

1044
01:21:14,877 --> 01:21:18,631
She can't hold a job,
she destroys everything she touches.

1045
01:21:18,714 --> 01:21:22,551
She should get married. Only a husband
is equipped for such a beating.

1046
01:21:22,635 --> 01:21:26,555
That's it. Roger, you have plenty of friends,
find her a husband.

1047
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:28,933
A simple, dull, unimaginative man

1048
01:21:29,016 --> 01:21:33,938
who will smile tolerantly when he learns
she's misplaced the children.

1049
01:21:34,021 --> 01:21:36,690
Return it, mark it address unknown.

1050
01:21:51,789 --> 01:21:54,542
Dr Gruber? Roger.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

1051
01:21:54,625 --> 01:22:00,297
Not at all. I received your message.
Things worked out well in Bermuda?

1052
01:22:00,381 --> 01:22:04,135
There's been a fantastic development!
He's mentioned marriage.

1053
01:22:04,218 --> 01:22:06,971
And how do you feel about this?

1054
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:11,684
Naturally, I'm delighted. He just left me
and I tell you this is the real thing.

1055
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:13,811
I see.

1056
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:18,065
Roger, I'll be away for a while.

1057
01:22:19,483 --> 01:22:23,696
I think I'd better go back to Vienna
for a refresher course.

1058
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,034
He doesn't love me,
he just feels sorry for me.

1059
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:31,996
Doesn't love you?
He compared you to the plague.

1060
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:35,958
- What else could it be?
- He wants me to marry another man.

1061
01:22:36,041 --> 01:22:40,880
I drew up a list of 20 eligible bachelors
and turned he them all down. Why?

1062
01:22:42,631 --> 01:22:47,094
This one had a low hairline
and this one graduated from Purdue.

1063
01:22:47,178 --> 01:22:49,680
- He even turned him down.
- Rock Hudson?

1064
01:22:49,763 --> 01:22:52,725
He said you'd have to live in California.

1065
01:22:52,808 --> 01:22:57,730
When he talks about a simple, dull,
unimaginative husband, he means himself.

1066
01:22:57,813 --> 01:22:59,982
He didn't say he was in love.

1067
01:23:00,065 --> 01:23:03,944
It's like having a baby,
the man is always the last one to know.

1068
01:23:04,028 --> 01:23:08,157
And how do we awaken him?
Not with a kiss but with a sledgehammer.

1069
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:11,911
- But I'm going away with Beasley.
- It has to be a Beasley.

1070
01:23:11,994 --> 01:23:14,788
- If he's as repulsive as you say.
- Worse.

1071
01:23:14,872 --> 01:23:19,126
- How about running away with you?
- No, he'd admire your choice.

1072
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:21,295
It has to be someone inferior.

1073
01:23:21,378 --> 01:23:26,217
To shatter Philip's ego you have go off
with the lowest human you can find.

1074
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:30,763
That's Beasley. He's so low
when they bury him they'll have to dig up.

1075
01:23:30,846 --> 01:23:34,558
- Mr Beasley, please.
- We're doing this for Philip,

1076
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:36,936
it's for his own good, and yours too.

1077
01:23:37,019 --> 01:23:39,772
He's a very nice man
and I'm the last one to admit it.

1078
01:23:39,855 --> 01:23:44,235
Even if it worked, it wouldn't be honest.
I'd be tricking him.

1079
01:23:44,318 --> 01:23:47,279
- It's a terrible way to get a man.
- Let's re-examine...

1080
01:23:47,363 --> 01:23:49,031
Stop pressing her.

1081
01:23:49,114 --> 01:23:54,245
You have now arrived at the crossroads
that every woman eventually arrives at,

1082
01:23:54,328 --> 01:23:58,457
you can either be an honest old maid
or a happy liar.

1083
01:24:02,294 --> 01:24:04,672
- 'Hello? '
- Hello.

1084
01:24:06,966 --> 01:24:09,009
This is Catherine Timberlake.

1085
01:24:10,928 --> 01:24:12,763
Well, hello there.

1086
01:24:16,142 --> 01:24:18,060
Come on.

1087
01:24:18,144 --> 01:24:20,813
I've been thinking about you.

1088
01:24:20,896 --> 01:24:26,986
'I wonder if I could, er,
reconsider your invitation, Everett.'

1089
01:24:27,069 --> 01:24:29,280
I'm not one to hold grudges.

1090
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:32,616
Tonight?

1091
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,828
We could have a TV dinner
at my apartment.

1092
01:24:35,911 --> 01:24:37,496
Asbury Park.

1093
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:43,085
Er, I've heard of this charming place
in, er Asbury Park.

1094
01:24:44,128 --> 01:24:46,338
It's, er...

1095
01:24:46,422 --> 01:24:48,048
Al's Motel.

1096
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:53,637
That's a long drive.
What time do you have to be home?

1097
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:56,056
Oh...

1098
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:58,017
it all depends.

1099
01:24:59,059 --> 01:25:00,478
On what?

1100
01:25:00,561 --> 01:25:03,856
Oh... Everett.

1101
01:25:07,693 --> 01:25:11,822
- I'll borrow my brother-in-law's car.
- Pick me up at five.

1102
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:15,201
And I'll be waiting... Everett.

1103
01:25:17,536 --> 01:25:21,457
Ooh! He's like a snake.
When he smiles, he rattles.

1104
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:24,793
He'll pick you up at five
and at one minute past five

1105
01:25:24,877 --> 01:25:27,671
I'll drop the bombshell on Mr Shayne's lap.

1106
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:33,052
- What if he doesn't follow us?
- We're dealing with a monumental ego.

1107
01:25:33,135 --> 01:25:35,721
You'll never get halfway to Asbury Park.

1108
01:25:38,516 --> 01:25:42,686
My brother-in-law's car is
being repaired but he let me have this.

1109
01:25:48,484 --> 01:25:52,613
On the way back we have to make
a delivery for him in Hoboken.

1110
01:26:21,725 --> 01:26:23,894
- You've got to follow her.
- Why?

1111
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:28,941
She's going away with another man.
She's lost her confidence with you.

1112
01:26:29,024 --> 01:26:31,777
OK, send her a box of confidence.

1113
01:26:31,861 --> 01:26:34,572
Don't you realise what will happen?

1114
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:38,742
Nothing will happen, I speak as a veteran
of two Bermuda campaigns.

1115
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:40,870
But she's in love with you.

1116
01:26:40,953 --> 01:26:44,582
- She has a fine way of showing it.
- She's afraid of you.

1117
01:26:44,665 --> 01:26:47,960
- What does that mean?
- She's not afraid of him.

1118
01:26:48,043 --> 01:26:51,589
She doesn't care what he thinks.
That's how it happens.

1119
01:26:53,507 --> 01:26:55,551
Get my clothes.

1120
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:59,722
Get me a hairbrush, a comb,
get me everything.

1121
01:27:04,477 --> 01:27:07,521
- Where's my driver?
- He went out to eat, sir.

1122
01:27:07,605 --> 01:27:09,815
- Who sent him to eat?
- You did.

1123
01:27:09,899 --> 01:27:11,734
Cab!

1124
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,200
Asbury Park. Al's Motel.

1125
01:27:19,283 --> 01:27:21,327
This girl I've gotta see.

1126
01:27:24,455 --> 01:27:26,499
Go on, hurry.

1127
01:27:27,124 --> 01:27:31,629
- Who is this man?
- He's a clerk at the unemployment office.

1128
01:27:31,712 --> 01:27:33,589
How naive can she be?

1129
01:27:33,672 --> 01:27:37,551
What does she think
he's taking her there for? An aptitude test?

1130
01:27:37,635 --> 01:27:41,722
Haven't you ever seen a man dress before?
Give me my shirt.

1131
01:27:41,806 --> 01:27:46,977
Al's Motel! Sounds like a place
where you bring your own light bulbs.

1132
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:51,440
- Why would she do that?
- He's a man and she's a woman.

1133
01:27:51,524 --> 01:27:55,945
That's the most dangerous combination
to turn loose in a motel.

1134
01:27:59,698 --> 01:28:01,659
Please, keep your eye on the road.

1135
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:13,379
When I called for the reservation
I talked to the proprietor.

1136
01:28:13,462 --> 01:28:18,050
He said we could use the burner
in his kitchen to heat up the TV dinners.

1137
01:28:18,134 --> 01:28:20,177
We're having haddock.

1138
01:28:21,262 --> 01:28:23,681
Would you like a drink?

1139
01:28:23,764 --> 01:28:26,559
Oh, yes. That'd be fine. Let's stop for one.

1140
01:28:26,642 --> 01:28:29,979
No need to. I thought of everything.

1141
01:28:30,062 --> 01:28:32,648
Muscatel. For my lady's pleasure.

1142
01:28:35,109 --> 01:28:39,029
There's some paper cups
in the glove compartment.

1143
01:28:41,448 --> 01:28:45,369
Would you mind stopping at
the service station for a minute?

1144
01:28:45,452 --> 01:28:47,538
Oh, of course.

1145
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:09,852
- Can't you go any faster?
- This cab's got 300,000 miles on her.

1146
01:29:09,935 --> 01:29:13,606
Would you ask your grandmother
to run the high hurdles?

1147
01:29:13,689 --> 01:29:17,026
Why am I chasing her?
I should be grateful to the man.

1148
01:29:17,109 --> 01:29:18,903
Freud had a theory about that.

1149
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:23,365
If he'd ever met this girl,
he'd have opened a delicatessen.

1150
01:29:23,449 --> 01:29:24,783
Yes.

1151
01:29:24,867 --> 01:29:27,119
Freud's Famous Frankfurters.

1152
01:29:36,045 --> 01:29:39,048
Would you mind pulling into that station?

1153
01:29:39,131 --> 01:29:41,091
Sure.

1154
01:30:01,904 --> 01:30:05,991
- That convertible ahead, catch up to it.
- I'm doing 70 now.

1155
01:30:06,075 --> 01:30:08,118
I'll burn out a bearing.

1156
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:10,579
Maybe they'll stop off for dinner.

1157
01:30:10,663 --> 01:30:15,793
When a girl's taken to a place called
Al's Motel, she better not count on dinner.

1158
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,824
Amazing.

1159
01:30:52,621 --> 01:30:55,875
I told you she wouldn't make it. She's gone.

1160
01:30:55,958 --> 01:31:00,421
We'll see that she gets a decent burial.
Roger, give him a cheque.

1161
01:31:00,504 --> 01:31:03,799
First phone for another cab.
He'll be right back.

1162
01:31:12,183 --> 01:31:14,477
- Do you know Asbury Park?
- Yeah.

1163
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,480
- A place called Al's Motel?
- Yeah.

1164
01:31:17,563 --> 01:31:19,899
50 bucks if you get me there.

1165
01:31:19,982 --> 01:31:22,193
Well, it's a little out of my way.

1166
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:24,862
Here.

1167
01:31:24,945 --> 01:31:27,615
- Hop in the back.
- Right. In the...? Oh.

1168
01:31:53,432 --> 01:31:55,267
Oh!

1169
01:32:07,488 --> 01:32:10,741
But there's the motel,
we'll be in in a few minutes.

1170
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:13,410
You register and I'll meet you inside.

1171
01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:17,498
OK. But when you get back to New York,
you ought to have a checkup.

1172
01:32:30,302 --> 01:32:32,388
- This is it.
- Thank you.

1173
01:32:32,471 --> 01:32:34,890
A man spends an entire lifetime

1174
01:32:34,974 --> 01:32:40,771
trying to lead a civilised, dignified,
orderly existence and then he meets a girl,

1175
01:32:40,855 --> 01:32:44,316
five days later he's running round
New York in a bath towel,

1176
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:47,444
riding in a truck filled with dead chickens,

1177
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:50,739
tracking her down to
this beaverboard Taj Mahal.

1178
01:32:50,823 --> 01:32:53,951
And poets call it love.
No wonder they starve.

1179
01:32:54,034 --> 01:32:56,662
Oh, the nuts you pick up on the road.

1180
01:32:57,830 --> 01:32:59,665
- Hi.
- How do you do?

1181
01:32:59,748 --> 01:33:03,669
Did a couple just register here?
A blonde about so high?

1182
01:33:03,752 --> 01:33:06,672
Yeah! About ten minutes ago.
Mr and Mrs Smith.

1183
01:33:06,755 --> 01:33:10,134
- That's them.
- Are you a friend of the happy couple?

1184
01:33:10,217 --> 01:33:12,178
I gave the bride away.

1185
01:33:12,261 --> 01:33:17,224
- They're in the bridal suite. I'll ring them.
- No. Let me surprise them.

1186
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:26,901
Oh. All right, where is she?

1187
01:33:26,984 --> 01:33:28,861
- Who?
- Mrs Smith.

1188
01:33:28,944 --> 01:33:31,739
- She's in there, changing.
- Into what?

1189
01:33:34,033 --> 01:33:35,951
Now just a moment.

1190
01:33:36,035 --> 01:33:37,953
What she ever saw in you...

1191
01:33:38,037 --> 01:33:40,623
- Come out of there!
- What right have you got?

1192
01:33:40,706 --> 01:33:44,502
Every right. I least I took her to a hotel,
not a rabbit hutch.

1193
01:33:44,585 --> 01:33:48,255
- She went to a hotel with you?
- She collects hotel keys.

1194
01:33:48,339 --> 01:33:50,382
Are you coming out?

1195
01:33:54,595 --> 01:33:59,266
Congratulations, my friend.
You've got a great little girl there.

1196
01:34:02,061 --> 01:34:04,188
Who was that man?

1197
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:06,982
You librarians live it up pretty good.

1198
01:34:07,942 --> 01:34:11,529
He didn't follow me and Beasley's
checking in. What shall I do?

1199
01:34:11,612 --> 01:34:13,948
Don't fall apart, keep your head.

1200
01:34:14,031 --> 01:34:16,242
Remember your girl scout training.

1201
01:34:16,325 --> 01:34:18,869
We never covered a situation like this.

1202
01:34:18,953 --> 01:34:21,455
Stall for time. Go to the ladies' room.

1203
01:34:21,539 --> 01:34:26,001
I already hit every gas station
between Newark and Asbury Park.

1204
01:34:26,085 --> 01:34:28,629
Oh, what made me think it would work?

1205
01:34:28,712 --> 01:34:31,632
Why should he follow me?
He doesn't love me.

1206
01:34:31,715 --> 01:34:36,887
Oh, Connie, if only he'd show up.
I'd fall on the ground and kiss his feet...

1207
01:34:40,015 --> 01:34:42,101
Oh, Mr Shayne.

1208
01:34:42,184 --> 01:34:44,311
What a pleasant surprise.

1209
01:34:44,395 --> 01:34:47,439
Erm, are you stopping at
the same motel we are?

1210
01:34:47,523 --> 01:34:50,943
Don't press your luck. Kiss his feet!

1211
01:34:51,026 --> 01:34:52,945
Did you drive up with anyone?

1212
01:34:53,028 --> 01:34:54,780
Yes, a plucked chicken.

1213
01:34:54,864 --> 01:34:59,285
Oh. Maybe the four of us
can get together later for a drink.

1214
01:34:59,368 --> 01:35:03,372
Oh, honey. You're blowing the whole thing.

1215
01:35:03,455 --> 01:35:06,083
- Hang up the phone.
- I will not.

1216
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:08,210
Hang up that phone.

1217
01:35:08,294 --> 01:35:12,798
This is no time to argue.
Get married first, then fight.

1218
01:35:12,882 --> 01:35:14,717
Hello?

1219
01:35:15,843 --> 01:35:17,970
My lover's waiting for me.

1220
01:35:18,053 --> 01:35:21,015
After we're married, I'll invite him over.

1221
01:35:21,098 --> 01:35:25,519
- We can't get married, I have problems.
- We'll work on them.

1222
01:35:25,603 --> 01:35:28,981
I'm unstable.
What kind of mother would I make?

1223
01:35:29,064 --> 01:35:31,734
If you fail, we can breed poodles.

1224
01:35:31,817 --> 01:35:36,864
I also lie. And I can't stand Beasley.
It was a trap to get you to follow me.

1225
01:35:36,947 --> 01:35:39,200
And don't forget the rashes.

1226
01:35:39,283 --> 01:35:41,368
Put your hands in.

1227
01:35:41,452 --> 01:35:43,537
Hey!

1228
01:35:50,795 --> 01:35:54,298
Hey, come back!
I've already paid for the room!

1229
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:09,772
Did a couple just check in?
Blonde woman about this high?

1230
01:36:09,855 --> 01:36:11,899
Yeah. Number 9.

1231
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,985
But what was I to think when...

1232
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:19,281
You believe I never cared for
another man till you walked into the library?

1233
01:36:19,365 --> 01:36:22,076
- Of course!
- I won't be long.

1234
01:36:33,754 --> 01:36:35,798
All right, where is she?

1235
01:36:37,216 --> 01:36:42,263
You're even more repulsive than she said.
No wonder she begged me to come.

1236
01:36:44,265 --> 01:36:46,767
It's me, Roger.

1237
01:36:46,851 --> 01:36:48,853
Hello?

1238
01:36:48,936 --> 01:36:51,730
Mother! You were right about women.

1239
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,860
Yes, Momma. I'll wait outside.

1240
01:36:55,943 --> 01:36:57,987
Come and get me.

1241
01:37:02,616 --> 01:37:07,121
Nothing serious, just another rash.
Quite common on honeymoons.

1242
01:37:07,204 --> 01:37:10,541
I would recommend
an uninterrupted night's sleep.

1243
01:37:10,624 --> 01:37:12,460
Naturally.

1244
01:37:12,543 --> 01:37:14,128
Cathy!

1245
01:37:14,211 --> 01:37:16,922
- Yes, darling?
- I'm so sorry.

1246
01:37:17,006 --> 01:37:19,049
You couldn't help it.

1247
01:37:19,133 --> 01:37:21,760
But it never happened before.

1248
01:37:21,844 --> 01:37:25,097
You've never been in
this situation before - married.

1249
01:37:25,181 --> 01:37:27,224
Hmm, that could be it.

1250
01:37:28,142 --> 01:37:31,770
- I just had a horrible thought.
- What?

1251
01:37:31,854 --> 01:37:36,400
You break out when we're not married, I do
when we are, we may never get together.

1252
01:37:36,484 --> 01:37:41,197
If that's what you think, you don't know
the girls in Upper Sandusky.

1253
01:37:53,459 --> 01:37:58,255
Roger, take care of the baby, will you?
I want to take a picture of Cathy.

1254
01:37:58,339 --> 01:38:00,382
Come along, dear.

1255
01:38:07,181 --> 01:38:09,016
Dr Gruber!

1256
01:38:09,099 --> 01:38:11,602
Roger.

1257
01:38:11,685 --> 01:38:14,021
- How was Vienna?
- I just got back.

1258
01:38:14,104 --> 01:38:16,065
I've been meaning to call you.

1259
01:38:16,148 --> 01:38:18,484
What happened with that friend of yours?

1260
01:38:18,567 --> 01:38:20,444
The wedding was last July.

1261
01:38:21,779 --> 01:38:24,657
- How did it work out?
- Take a look.
