1
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:50,093
Oh, god!

2
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:05,983
It was a brilliant
lecture, doctor.

3
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:07,318
Yeah. the best
of the year.

4
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:10,475
Careful, all these bravos will
go to an old Ph.D.'s head.

5
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:12,790
And now, if you'll take
the Necronomicon

6
00:05:12,857 --> 00:05:14,341
and return it
to the library,

7
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:17,677
I'll meet you there
as soon as I can.

8
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:20,279
Doctor, don't forget we're
picking you up for dinner.

9
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:21,297
I'll be there.

10
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:23,232
And you take good care
of that book.

11
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:32,058
You know, some of
that stuff he said

12
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,125
sort of got to me.

13
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:34,193
It's ridiculous.

14
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:35,261
No, no. I know
what you mean.

15
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:36,495
Especially those
creepy people

16
00:05:36,563 --> 00:05:38,464
and some of the
things they did.

17
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:44,270
Can you lift that?

18
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:47,156
Could I see that
before you put it away?

19
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:50,292
Do you always sneak up
on people like that?

20
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,194
Oh, my, you scare easily.

21
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:55,530
I'd really like to glance
through that book,

22
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:57,398
the Necronomicon.

23
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:59,300
Well, that's
impossible.

24
00:05:59,368 --> 00:06:01,803
I've traveled a long way.

25
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:06,057
The library is closing.

26
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,892
Come on.
Give me 5 minutes.

27
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,827
Absolutely not!

28
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:11,429
Wait a minute.

29
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,097
I don't suppose
it would do any harm.

30
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,084
Are you crazy?

31
00:06:16,152 --> 00:06:19,754
Uh, why don't you
take it in there?

32
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:21,106
Thank you.

33
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:29,613
You must be
insane.

34
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,882
Oh, it'll be all right.
He'll take care of it.

35
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,184
He'll take care of it?
That book is priceless.

36
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:35,719
Oh, stop worrying
about the book.

37
00:06:35,787 --> 00:06:37,554
Did you notice his eyes?

38
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:40,090
He's really got great eyes.

39
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:41,858
Nancy, what do you do?

40
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:43,427
You're giving
his rarest book

41
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:45,962
to the first kook
that comes along.

42
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,031
Well, uh...
I... I trust him.

43
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,525
"Yog-Sothoth...

44
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:04,197
"it is the gate whereby
the spheres meet.

45
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:09,231
"only Them from Beyond can
make it multiply and work.

46
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:15,725
"Yog-Sothoth
is the key.

47
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:20,142
"and with the gate open,
the Old Ones shall be...

48
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:27,135
"past, present, future...
all are one.

49
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:31,723
"the Old Ones walk
serene and primal...

50
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,660
"undimensioned and unseen...

51
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:38,197
"the Old Ones broke through
of old...

52
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:40,199
"and they shall
break through..."

53
00:07:40,266 --> 00:07:44,453
The book, please.

54
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,555
The book, please.

55
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:49,824
Oh, there's no need
to be upset.

56
00:07:49,892 --> 00:07:52,461
I was only reading it.

57
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:55,796
Have you any idea
what this volume is worth?

58
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:57,764
It's one of a kind.

59
00:07:57,832 --> 00:07:59,967
Of course,
a generation ago,

60
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:01,768
there was
another copy...

61
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:03,204
40 miles from here.

62
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:09,127
Young man, I am familiar
with Dunwich.

63
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:10,628
I know.

64
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:13,631
You've read my paper
on Oliver Whateley?

65
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:15,566
He was a great man.

66
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:17,401
They hanged him.

67
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:19,904
They were fools.

68
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:21,873
Who's to say?

69
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,641
I'm Wilbur Whateley,

70
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,175
Oliver's great-grandson.

71
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:28,178
Then you know who I am.

72
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:30,080
Dr. Henry Armitage.

73
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:36,019
Yes. It's a pleasure
to meet a Whateley.

74
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:37,420
Thank you.

75
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:42,125
Doctor?

76
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:43,493
Oh, it's easy to see

77
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,029
why you 2 girls were
so effectively charmed.

78
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:47,864
I'm very glad to have
met this young man.

79
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:50,100
We share a mutual interest.

80
00:08:50,168 --> 00:08:53,920
In fact, I'd like to talk
further with you.

81
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:56,155
We might learn
a great deal from each other,

82
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:57,556
don't you think?

83
00:08:57,623 --> 00:09:00,125
About Dunwich, perhaps?

84
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:03,195
Dunwich, dr. Armitage,
might appear to you

85
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:06,031
as just another small town.

86
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:08,534
The people of Dunwich are
just like everyone else.

87
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:10,502
They're just more honest
about it.

88
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,439
You see man as a rather
dismal creature.

89
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:16,575
Yes. Why not?

90
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:18,643
Look around.

91
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:20,479
You'll see what's there.

92
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:23,199
Fear, and frightened
people who kill

93
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,568
what they can't understand.

94
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:28,403
It's late.
I should be going.

95
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,239
Dr. Armitage,
I'd like permission

96
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:37,095
to study
the Necronomicon.

97
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:40,148
For what reason,
mr. Whateley?

98
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:43,784
Well, I'm a student
of the occult.

99
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:47,171
And that book is
like a bible.

100
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,640
A rather odious comparison.

101
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,692
Uh, no, not really.

102
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,462
It's not enough to say
the book is irreplaceable?

103
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,031
No. You're afraid.

104
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:59,900
Afraid? Possibly.

105
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:01,701
In ancient times,
that book was said

106
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:04,571
to unlock the gates
to another dimension,

107
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,974
to another race of beings.

108
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,743
I do not share
those beliefs,

109
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,045
nor do I fully
understand them.

110
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:15,115
However, I know enough
about strange things

111
00:10:15,183 --> 00:10:16,716
not to laugh at them.

112
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:19,553
I don't have to tell you
I'd take good care of it.

113
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:21,221
I'm sorry,
I couldn't possibly

114
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,989
let the book
out of my hands.

115
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,825
I need it in my own
field of study.

116
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:28,460
Dr. Armitage, will you
lend me the book?

117
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,296
I will not.

118
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,664
That's your last word?

119
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,034
Yes.

120
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:35,885
Let me get
part of that.

121
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,052
Oh, nonsense.

122
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,304
Nancy's car
is here.

123
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:39,805
I'll take you
to the hotel.

124
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,708
Thank you.

125
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:43,876
Good night.

126
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,344
Good night.

127
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:47,679
Mr. Whateley.

128
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,249
Maybe we'll meet again.

129
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,550
Perhaps.

130
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:03,528
I guess I kind of put
the damper on a nice evening,

131
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:05,830
but I can't stand pomposity.

132
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,733
I think you've made
your point quite clear.

133
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,270
Do you know how much longer
he's gonna be in town?

134
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,756
Uh, his last lecture's
next Monday.

135
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:16,241
Monday.

136
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,276
That's only 3 days.

137
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,845
I wanted to hear
one of his lectures.

138
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:21,896
You won't be here
that long?

139
00:11:22,198 --> 00:11:24,416
No. I have to go back
to Dunwich tonight.

140
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,884
As a matter of fact,
I should get moving,

141
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,186
or I'll miss my bus.

142
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,487
What time's your bus?

143
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,955
9:15.

144
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:35,776
9:15?
You just missed it.

145
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,644
Dammit.

146
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:40,629
There isn't another bus
until tomorrow morning.

147
00:11:44,436 --> 00:11:48,572
Well, uh,
I could drive you.

148
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,774
Oh, it's too late.
I couldn't let you do that.

149
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:53,944
No, no, really.
I mean, I'd like to.

150
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,512
Oh, fine.

151
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,821
It's only a couple
more miles, Nancy.

152
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:09,976
I hope so. We're
almost out of gas.

153
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:11,677
Oh, saved.

154
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,738
It's past
closing time.

155
00:12:22,806 --> 00:12:24,574
Oh, couldn't I have
a little gas?

156
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:25,808
Ok. how much?

157
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,944
can you fill it up,
please?

158
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:31,614
Service
with a smile.

159
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:34,482
Say, how far
is the town?

160
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,585
Oh, it's down that way.

161
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:39,004
But we turn off
right up here.

162
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:42,975
I'm sorry.
I wanted to see Dunwich.

163
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,076
It's all right.

164
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:47,079
There's not much
to see at night.

165
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:50,983
Besides, everything in town
closes up pretty early.

166
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:01,526
$1!

167
00:13:01,594 --> 00:13:03,361
$1? I asked you
to fill it up.

168
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:07,365
$1!

169
00:13:07,432 --> 00:13:09,867
Aren't you gonna finish
the window?

170
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:26,249
Boy, I could never get
used to treatment like that.

171
00:13:26,318 --> 00:13:28,319
They've treated me that way

172
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:31,054
since the day
I was born.

173
00:13:31,122 --> 00:13:32,856
They never change.

174
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:35,458
They're still
the same frightened,

175
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,560
superstitious fools.

176
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:16,398
That's even crazier
than you said.

177
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:18,299
Would you like to come in
and see the inside?

178
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:19,601
Oh, no, no.
I'd like to,

179
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:21,236
but really,
I should start back.

180
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:24,239
Just have a drink...
or cup of tea.

181
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:26,575
I really shouldn't.

182
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:30,295
Please.

183
00:14:30,362 --> 00:14:31,396
Ok.

184
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:08,481
Well?

185
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:10,416
What do you think?

186
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:15,889
Well, I don't know
what to think.

187
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:21,027
I'm glad you find it
interesting.

188
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:23,196
Would you like
a cup of tea?

189
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:24,463
Please.

190
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:26,766
Fine.

191
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:28,034
It's been a long ride.

192
00:15:28,102 --> 00:15:29,702
If you feel
like freshening up,

193
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,373
there's a bathroom
right through that door.

194
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:38,194
Thank you.

195
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:48,977
Wilbur!

196
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:50,493
Wilbur!

197
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:57,453
This is my grandfather.

198
00:18:57,521 --> 00:18:59,855
I want to speak to you.

199
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,957
We were just going
to have some tea.

200
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:05,294
I'll see you
when we're finished.

201
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:08,473
I'll be waiting for you.

202
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:13,535
Sorry.

203
00:19:20,426 --> 00:19:23,728
Sit down, Nancy.

204
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,032
I thought you
lived alone.

205
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,435
Gee, I'm sorry
he frightened you.

206
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,969
Do you want
sugar or cream?

207
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,206
No, thank you.

208
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,308
Tell you the truth, I didn't
think he'd be up this late.

209
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,409
Oh, it's all right.

210
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,277
It's just that
he startled me.

211
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,481
Wilbur, when you
were in the kitchen,

212
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,683
I heard strange sounds.

213
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,951
Oh? what kind of sounds?

214
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:49,019
I'm not sure.

215
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:52,256
I mean,
it sounded like wind...

216
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,924
or the ocean.

217
00:19:53,991 --> 00:19:55,959
That's what it was.

218
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,728
This place is so old.

219
00:19:57,795 --> 00:20:00,514
When the wind blows,
everything kind of creaks.

220
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:01,615
Oh, Wilbur,
I'm sorry.

221
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:02,816
I dropped
something before.

222
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:03,917
Oh?

223
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:07,053
The... glass.

224
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:08,388
Oh.

225
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:17,897
That's nothing.

226
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:19,565
It's all right.

227
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:26,489
Well...

228
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:28,958
I guess I'd
better start back.

229
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:30,326
Finish your tea.

230
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,633
No, really, no.
It's late. I must go.

231
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:38,917
I understand.

232
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:57,052
Well, you come back and
visit soon, will you?

233
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,721
We'll see each other again.

234
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:03,858
What's wrong?

235
00:21:03,927 --> 00:21:06,828
Hell, I don't know.

236
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:09,031
I wish I could help, but I
don't know much about cars.

237
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:10,832
I don't think
this thing's gonna start.

238
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,834
Maybe we ought
to phone a garage.

239
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:14,002
You wouldn't believe it,

240
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,405
but I don't
have a telephone.

241
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:20,141
Well, that's great.
now what am I gonna do?

242
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:22,944
I don't know.

243
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,590
You-you know,

244
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:39,193
this is really
a good idea.

245
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,495
I'm completely
wiped out.

246
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:43,130
I... I don't even
think I could drive

247
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:44,765
if I had to.

248
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,267
I'm sure you'll feel
better in the morning.

249
00:21:47,336 --> 00:21:49,469
Oh, yes. yes.

250
00:21:49,537 --> 00:21:50,737
I'm sorry about this room,

251
00:21:50,805 --> 00:21:52,539
but it hasn't been used
for years and years.

252
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:54,006
Oh, no, no.
don't apologize.

253
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:56,876
it's fine, fine.

254
00:21:56,944 --> 00:21:59,111
Uh... let's see.

255
00:22:12,893 --> 00:22:15,895
Here's a nightgown
you can put on if you like.

256
00:22:15,963 --> 00:22:19,031
Thank you.

257
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:24,603
Wilbur...

258
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,238
Good night.

259
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:27,606
Good night.

260
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:45,491
Who is she?

261
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:46,758
Just a girl.

262
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:48,693
She gave me a ride home.

263
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:51,195
Does anyone know
she's out here?

264
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:52,597
No.

265
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:55,049
Suppose she goes up there?

266
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:55,950
She won't.

267
00:22:56,017 --> 00:22:58,385
She has no reason to.

268
00:25:14,903 --> 00:25:16,670
She didn't
come home last night.

269
00:25:16,738 --> 00:25:18,906
She must've driven
that boy home.

270
00:25:18,973 --> 00:25:20,607
I could see she was
attracted to him,

271
00:25:20,675 --> 00:25:22,009
but I don't think
going out there

272
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:23,577
was such a good idea.

273
00:25:23,645 --> 00:25:25,093
Well, didn't you
try to telephone?

274
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,662
I couldn't
get a listing.

275
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,930
Oh.

276
00:25:27,998 --> 00:25:30,132
It's not like her
not to have called me.

277
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,566
Now, if he were
a straight guy,

278
00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:34,103
I wouldn't be worried.

279
00:25:34,171 --> 00:25:36,371
I can't remember
much more,

280
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:39,158
except it was the weirdest
dream I've ever had.

281
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:42,411
Sounds kind of sexual to me.

282
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:48,851
Ok, dr. Freud, tell me
what it all means.

283
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:50,218
Well, this is
our first session.

284
00:25:50,286 --> 00:25:53,722
It's a little hard to tell.

285
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,992
Are you prepared
to answer some questions?

286
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,594
Ask me anything.

287
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:02,514
All right. How do you
feel about sex?

288
00:26:02,582 --> 00:26:05,817
I think it's great.

289
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:10,572
So do I, Nancy.

290
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:13,374
Well, I mean, I think
it's great if it's

291
00:26:13,442 --> 00:26:16,394
at the right time
and the right place.

292
00:26:16,462 --> 00:26:19,397
You've led a strange
life here, Wilbur.

293
00:26:19,465 --> 00:26:20,832
I was raised
by my grandfather,

294
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:24,001
and he taught me
all the things he knows.

295
00:26:24,069 --> 00:26:25,470
I had to work harder
than most kids,

296
00:26:25,538 --> 00:26:27,137
but it hasn't
been so bad.

297
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:29,106
Well, I come
from the city and...

298
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:31,275
well, I just... I don't
know, I never felt

299
00:26:31,343 --> 00:26:35,512
so relaxed or had
such peace of mind.

300
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,342
I think the country
does that for people.

301
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:47,090
Nancy, why don't you
stay the weekend?

302
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:48,259
well, I'd
like to, Wilbur,

303
00:26:48,326 --> 00:26:50,761
but I... I couldn't.

304
00:26:50,828 --> 00:26:53,196
But you'd
like to, though, huh?

305
00:27:06,744 --> 00:27:08,411
Her car's there.

306
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:10,480
She's gotta be
around somewhere.

307
00:27:30,883 --> 00:27:32,884
What do you want?

308
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:34,685
Pardon us.

309
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,256
We're looking
for our friend...

310
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,258
Nancy Wagner.

311
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,560
I'm dr. Armitage

312
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,695
and this is
Elizabeth Hamilton.

313
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:47,032
We met your grandson
Wilbur yesterday

314
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:47,982
in the university.

315
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,951
Armitage?

316
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:53,087
what would my grandson
want with you?

317
00:27:53,155 --> 00:27:54,973
He came to see me
about a book I own,

318
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,174
the Necronomicon.

319
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,242
Look, is my
girlfriend here

320
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,543
or isn't she?

321
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,579
No! go away!

322
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:03,764
Go away!

323
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:06,167
Were you looking
for us, doctor?

324
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:07,334
Nancy!

325
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:09,003
Are you
all right?

326
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:10,337
I was worried
about you.

327
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:11,572
Of course
she's all right.

328
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:13,074
She's not a child.

329
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:14,675
She drove me home
last night

330
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:17,078
and then she decided
to stay the weekend.

331
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,478
Didn't you, Nancy?

332
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:20,347
Yes. yes, I did.

333
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:22,783
So if that's what you came
to see about, doctor,

334
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:24,384
I guess we'll be
saying goodbye.

335
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,553
Nancy, wait
a second.

336
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,505
Do you know what
you're doing?

337
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,807
Of course I know
what I'm doing.

338
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:33,909
I'm staying
with Wilbur.

339
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,979
Nancy...
bye, Elizabeth.

340
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:56,432
Boy, I really
can't believe

341
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,833
She dragged
dr. Armitage

342
00:28:57,901 --> 00:28:59,369
all the way up here.

343
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:01,303
I mean,
that's something I...

344
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:04,272
I expect
from my mother.

345
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,975
Doesn't matter.

346
00:29:07,043 --> 00:29:09,694
Would you like
some more tea?

347
00:29:09,763 --> 00:29:11,230
Please.

348
00:29:11,297 --> 00:29:13,465
You tired, or is it
the company?

349
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:15,917
Oh, no, no, no.

350
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:19,888
I don't know,
I'm kinda sleepy.

351
00:29:19,955 --> 00:29:22,324
Well, we did take
a long walk today.

352
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:23,691
Yeah.

353
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,995
Maybe you could
use a little nap.

354
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:29,864
You know, that's
not a bad idea.

355
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:38,405
um, we are going
to town, aren't we?

356
00:29:38,473 --> 00:29:40,675
Sure. But I think you'll
enjoy yourself more

357
00:29:40,742 --> 00:29:42,877
if you can keep
your eyes open.

358
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,493
um, I'll be
all right.

359
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:13,557
You lied to me.

360
00:30:13,624 --> 00:30:14,858
Now tell me
the truth!

361
00:30:14,926 --> 00:30:16,159
Keep your voice
down, will you?

362
00:30:16,226 --> 00:30:17,961
Why is she here?

363
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:21,230
I told you, her car
broke down.

364
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:23,766
What about this?

365
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:24,918
Don't be ridiculous.

366
00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:26,753
And those people.

367
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:28,888
You told me no one
knew she was here.

368
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:30,156
They don't matter.

369
00:30:30,224 --> 00:30:33,325
That man Armitage wrote
the paper on my father.

370
00:30:33,392 --> 00:30:35,861
He knows all about us.

371
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:37,062
I don't have
to answer to you.

372
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,731
I do what I want.

373
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,735
Come back here!

374
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:44,803
Let the book be!

375
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:14,766
You know,
it happened

376
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,167
25 years ago.

377
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:18,102
They were
a strange family.

378
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,805
I just hope there's
something in there.

379
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:33,751
This used to be
the town bank, you know.

380
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:36,953
Ah, here it is.

381
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,873
This is the one.

382
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,458
Let's get it
out in the light.

383
00:31:49,734 --> 00:31:52,402
Ah, here it is
just like I told you.

384
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,205
"Mother named Lavinia,
father unknown.

385
00:31:55,272 --> 00:31:56,673
"Child called Wilbur."

386
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:59,743
I set that type myself
25 years ago.

387
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:01,478
Who was the delivering
physician?

388
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:02,746
Same old doc
that delivers

389
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:05,581
all of them around here...
doc Cory.

390
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:07,216
Thank you,
mr. Fuller.

391
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:08,283
Elizabeth...

392
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:09,485
Dr. Armitage!

393
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:14,289
If I were you, I'd stay
away from the Whateleys.

394
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:15,725
Elizabeth.

395
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:18,995
That was the original
town square.

396
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,463
70 years ago, there was a big
oak tree right there

397
00:32:21,532 --> 00:32:24,266
in the middle
of the street.

398
00:32:24,334 --> 00:32:26,001
That's where the
people of Dunwich

399
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,671
lynched my
great-grandfather.

400
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,206
They just let him
hang there

401
00:32:30,274 --> 00:32:33,209
for days and days
and days and days.

402
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:35,110
Then they burned the tree down
to the ground.

403
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:39,264
Wilbur, stop it.

404
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:40,765
It's just history.

405
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:49,641
Why did they do it?

406
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:50,775
Because he
didn't believe

407
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,010
in what
they believed.

408
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:55,413
Because he wasn't
afraid of their god

409
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:57,715
or their devil either,
for that matter.

410
00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:58,783
In fact, he thought

411
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,217
they were pretty
much alike.

412
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:03,838
What did he believe in?

413
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:05,173
In another
race of beings

414
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,975
from a different
dimension.

415
00:33:08,043 --> 00:33:09,643
An earlier race,
superior to man.

416
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:10,811
And he believed

417
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:13,213
they could be
brought back.

418
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:15,415
You mean they
Hanged him for that?

419
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:16,984
Yes.

420
00:33:17,052 --> 00:33:18,318
They trumped up
A murder charge

421
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:20,187
To cover it up.

422
00:33:20,254 --> 00:33:22,656
A girl had
disappeared and...

423
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:23,991
Then without
a shred of evidence,

424
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,960
They went after him.

425
00:33:26,027 --> 00:33:27,061
They claimed he used her

426
00:33:27,128 --> 00:33:29,063
In some sort of sacrifice.

427
00:33:35,854 --> 00:33:37,020
You must be worried, too,

428
00:33:37,088 --> 00:33:39,021
To go to all of this trouble.

429
00:33:45,078 --> 00:33:47,247
Ok, the doctor
will see you now.

430
00:33:47,314 --> 00:33:51,984
Thank you.
I won't be long.

431
00:33:52,052 --> 00:33:55,171
Dr. Cory?

432
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,339
Yes?

433
00:33:56,406 --> 00:33:58,975
I'm Henry Armitage,
doctor of philosophy.

434
00:33:59,042 --> 00:34:01,443
I'm lecturing at the university
in Arkham.

435
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:03,779
Oh, yes, yes,
well...

436
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:05,214
What can I do
for you, doctor?

437
00:34:05,282 --> 00:34:07,483
I'm... not sure.

438
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,650
I have a rather
strange request.

439
00:34:09,718 --> 00:34:11,219
Well, a country doctor is

440
00:34:11,287 --> 00:34:12,587
used to them.
Please, sit down.

441
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:16,958
Thank you.

442
00:34:17,026 --> 00:34:19,194
Well, now...

443
00:34:19,262 --> 00:34:20,929
Please go ahead.

444
00:34:20,997 --> 00:34:22,697
I'd like to ask you
some questions

445
00:34:22,765 --> 00:34:24,632
About the Whateley family.

446
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,835
Well, that's an odd
bird of an ailment,

447
00:34:28,104 --> 00:34:29,970
But it flares up now and again
in these parts.

448
00:34:30,406 --> 00:34:33,108
Haven't you
ever been there?

449
00:34:33,175 --> 00:34:34,742
Are you kidding?

450
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,477
I wouldn't go
near that place.

451
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:39,014
Why?

452
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:39,980
Oh, that place

453
00:34:40,048 --> 00:34:41,315
Gives me
the creeps.

454
00:34:41,383 --> 00:34:44,785
But why?

455
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:47,288
Well... some say

456
00:34:47,355 --> 00:34:48,355
That old Whateley

457
00:34:48,423 --> 00:34:50,657
and Wilbur aren't alone...

458
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:53,660
That there's
something else.

459
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:55,963
What do you mean
"something else"?

460
00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:59,550
I... I don't know
exactly, but, uh...

461
00:34:59,617 --> 00:35:01,018
When I was
a little kid,

462
00:35:01,086 --> 00:35:02,119
The other
children and I,

463
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:04,187
We thought the old Whateley house
was haunted.

464
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,173
Of course, I don't
believe that anymore,

465
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,524
But I keep away

466
00:35:07,592 --> 00:35:09,293
And so does
everyone else.

467
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,660
Anyway, the old man
and Wilbur,

468
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:12,128
they haven't
allowed

469
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,797
anyone on the place
in years.

470
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:15,898
Oh.

471
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:19,001
Well, a friend of mine
is out there right now.

472
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:20,336
What?
Yeah.

473
00:35:20,404 --> 00:35:21,871
She's out there
with Wilbur.

474
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:23,489
Wilbur Whateley
has a girlfriend?

475
00:35:23,557 --> 00:35:25,425
Oh, I don't
believe it!

476
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:27,677
Well, hasn't it ever
happened before?

477
00:35:27,745 --> 00:35:32,248
Not with any girl
around here.

478
00:35:32,316 --> 00:35:35,668
I saw your name
on the birth records.

479
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:37,170
Well...

480
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:38,304
You have me

481
00:35:38,372 --> 00:35:42,174
in an awkward
position, doctor.

482
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,309
And before
I can reveal

483
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:45,510
Anything to you,

484
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:46,612
I must know the purpose

485
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,413
of your inquiry.

486
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:51,149
Of course. Dr. Cory,

487
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:53,418
this will sound
quite fantastic,

488
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:54,786
but I ask
your indulgence.

489
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:56,521
Please bear with me

490
00:35:56,589 --> 00:36:01,126
and then decide
for yourself.

491
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:03,628
Where the Whateleys
are concerned,

492
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:04,696
there is very little

493
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,865
that is not fantastic.

494
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,317
I wonder what's going on.

495
00:36:09,386 --> 00:36:11,019
Look...

496
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,187
I don't want
to worry you,

497
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:14,321
but if I
had a friend

498
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,623
down at weird Wilbur's,

499
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:19,427
I'd get her
out of there.

500
00:36:19,495 --> 00:36:21,396
Let me put it
this way, doctor.

501
00:36:21,463 --> 00:36:23,030
The legend of
the Necronomicon

502
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,266
has it that long ago

503
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,634
the earth was inhabited

504
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:30,037
by a species
from another dimension.

505
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:33,374
With certain chants
from the book,

506
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:36,611
coupled with ancient
rites and sacrifices,

507
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:39,647
this race, the Old Ones,

508
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:42,917
can be brought back.

509
00:36:42,984 --> 00:36:45,752
And mankind?

510
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:50,524
Destroyed.

511
00:36:50,591 --> 00:36:51,691
And from what
you've seen

512
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:53,092
of young Whateley,

513
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,094
You think it's
actually possible

514
00:36:55,162 --> 00:36:57,030
That he might believe that?

515
00:36:57,097 --> 00:37:00,400
The book, the girl...

516
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:04,137
I don't know what to think.

517
00:37:04,204 --> 00:37:05,839
If he does believe the legend,

518
00:37:05,907 --> 00:37:07,307
from my impression of Wilbur,

519
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:09,275
he'd be capable of anything.

520
00:37:09,343 --> 00:37:10,343
If he does attempt

521
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:12,078
one of those rituals,

522
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,981
that girl is in grave danger.

523
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:19,318
Well, it's hard
to accept.

524
00:37:19,385 --> 00:37:21,554
But then, it wouldn't
be the first time

525
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:23,121
that someone else
paid the penalty

526
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:24,523
for Whateley fanaticism.

527
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:26,559
Oh?

528
00:37:26,626 --> 00:37:28,461
Yes, you see...

529
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:30,463
It wasn't I
who delivered

530
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,665
young Whateley.

531
00:37:32,732 --> 00:37:36,702
It was his
grandfather.

532
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:37,870
It's been
25 years,

533
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:39,304
but I'll never
forget that day

534
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:41,207
As long as I live.

535
00:37:41,274 --> 00:37:43,309
I was in Osborne's store,

536
00:37:43,376 --> 00:37:45,243
Just chatting with
a few of the locals.

537
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:47,145
Old Whateley
came running in

538
00:37:47,213 --> 00:37:49,180
all of a sudden,
all wild-eyed

539
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:51,049
and crazier than ever.

540
00:37:51,116 --> 00:37:52,383
But nobody
ever saw much

541
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:53,751
of the Whateleys
in town,

542
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:55,519
so it was a surprise
right off.

543
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:57,255
He always took
a lot of jeering

544
00:37:57,323 --> 00:37:58,489
from the townsfolk.

545
00:37:58,557 --> 00:38:00,258
Well, they didn't
waste a minute's time

546
00:38:00,326 --> 00:38:01,726
before they started
in on him.

547
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:04,362
I don't care what
you folks say.

548
00:38:04,429 --> 00:38:06,530
If Lavinia's boy
looked like his pa,

549
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:07,966
he'd wouldn't look
like nothing

550
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:09,267
you expect.

551
00:38:09,335 --> 00:38:10,534
You needn't think
that the only folks

552
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:12,170
are the folks
hereabouts.

553
00:38:12,238 --> 00:38:13,571
Lavinia's read some

554
00:38:13,638 --> 00:38:15,340
And has seen
some things

555
00:38:15,407 --> 00:38:18,375
that most of you can
only tell about.

556
00:38:18,442 --> 00:38:20,310
Some day,
you folks'll hear

557
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:21,711
a child of Lavinia's

558
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:23,180
Calling his
Father's name

559
00:38:23,248 --> 00:38:25,115
from the top
of Sentinel Hill.

560
00:38:25,183 --> 00:38:27,284
And then you'll know!

561
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:31,922
And you'll wish
to god you didn't!

562
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,724
All right, fellas, that's it.

563
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:36,559
As I entered
the bedroom,

564
00:38:36,627 --> 00:38:39,045
there were 2
elderly albino women,

565
00:38:39,113 --> 00:38:40,947
robed entirely
in black,

566
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:42,933
standing watchfully
over her.

567
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:44,501
She was burning up
with fever

568
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:45,802
and soaking wet.

569
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,003
God only knows

570
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,704
what went on
out there that day.

571
00:38:48,772 --> 00:38:50,006
It was plain to see

572
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:52,041
she'd been out
in the rain.

573
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:54,443
They told me
that she'd had twins.

574
00:38:54,511 --> 00:38:57,246
One of them
was stillborn.

575
00:38:57,313 --> 00:38:59,515
Though I never
saw the body.

576
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,250
And since old Whateley's
not allowed

577
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:03,019
anyone out there since,

578
00:39:03,086 --> 00:39:06,388
it's possible that baby
may have lived.

579
00:39:06,456 --> 00:39:08,057
It's a miracle
that Wilbur

580
00:39:08,124 --> 00:39:10,676
came through it
all right.

581
00:39:10,743 --> 00:39:13,963
Lavinia's insides
were all torn up.

582
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:16,966
Well, I did everything
I could for her.

583
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:18,232
She was so far gone,

584
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,402
I was lucky
to save her life.

585
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,939
Her mind was gone forever.

586
00:39:24,006 --> 00:39:26,908
Of course, we never did
find out who the father was.

587
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,910
And the 2 old women?

588
00:39:28,978 --> 00:39:30,311
I don't know.

589
00:39:30,379 --> 00:39:34,182
Never saw them around here
before or since.

590
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:39,320
Where's Lavinia now?

591
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:49,162
Incredible.

592
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,530
It is hard to believe

593
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:53,067
That she's only
45 years old.

594
00:39:53,134 --> 00:39:55,669
She's been here now
for more than 20 years.

595
00:39:55,737 --> 00:39:58,038
There's been no
appreciable change.

596
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,074
Walk unseen

597
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:02,076
In lonely places...

598
00:40:02,143 --> 00:40:03,744
Old Ones...

599
00:40:03,812 --> 00:40:05,278
Oh, my sons,

600
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:07,915
Open the Gate,
my sons!

601
00:40:16,157 --> 00:40:18,092
Could I go in
And talk to her?

602
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,692
I'm afraid not.

603
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,829
She's violent.
At times, extremely so.

604
00:40:22,896 --> 00:40:24,363
I'd like to try.

605
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:27,450
It wouldn't do any good.

606
00:40:27,517 --> 00:40:30,853
Lavinia?
Lavinia?

607
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:32,771
I want to talk
to you.

608
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,063
Kill them all!

609
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:44,066
Let them in!
Kill them all!

610
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,891
Do you think you've
had enough to eat?

611
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:57,712
Oh, plenty.

612
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,914
Well, let's take a walk.

613
00:40:58,981 --> 00:41:00,097
There's something
I want to show you.

614
00:41:00,165 --> 00:41:03,901
Okay.

615
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:05,303
You all right?

616
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:07,405
Yeah. I'm just
a little dizzy.

617
00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:10,174
I'll help you.
It's not far.

618
00:41:10,242 --> 00:41:11,909
I'll be all right.

619
00:41:50,648 --> 00:41:53,299
It's not much further.

620
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:58,004
What's in
the package?

621
00:41:58,071 --> 00:41:58,771
Look.

622
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:28,349
It's just fantastic.

623
00:42:28,418 --> 00:42:31,553
What is it?

624
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:34,222
No one knows exactly.

625
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,392
Legend has it that it's
been here forever.

626
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,694
It's called
the Devil's Hopyard.

627
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:26,639
Fertility rites
were practiced here,

628
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:29,976
so they say.

629
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:32,511
Is this an altar?

630
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:35,348
Yes.

631
00:43:35,415 --> 00:43:40,219
But what was it
used for?

632
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:41,754
When the seasons

633
00:43:41,822 --> 00:43:45,291
And the cycles
of the moon were ripe,

634
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:46,943
Then they came

635
00:43:47,011 --> 00:43:49,512
one by one

636
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,916
and gathered
among these stones.

637
00:43:52,984 --> 00:43:56,512
And they selected
a beautiful girl like you.

638
00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:03,675
Do you remember what we
talked about this morning?

639
00:44:03,743 --> 00:44:05,694
Yes.

640
00:44:05,762 --> 00:44:07,395
When you asked me
that question

641
00:44:07,463 --> 00:44:09,297
about sex?

642
00:44:09,365 --> 00:44:12,601
Yes?

643
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:15,571
I lied.

644
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:16,905
I know.

645
00:44:30,552 --> 00:44:32,553
Then they placed
the girl's virginal body

646
00:44:32,621 --> 00:44:34,689
upon the altar,

647
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:37,558
naked to the elements.

648
00:44:37,626 --> 00:44:41,178
And their black robes
blending into the night,

649
00:44:41,246 --> 00:44:44,882
they lighted candles
and gathered round

650
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:50,054
to observe and to relish
her nakedness.

651
00:44:50,122 --> 00:44:52,957
And then they waited.

652
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:54,258
They waited
for the moment

653
00:44:54,326 --> 00:44:56,260
When she would allow
the power of darkness

654
00:44:56,328 --> 00:44:58,761
to enter her.

655
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:03,466
The moment when
the gate would open

656
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,670
and the Old Ones
would come through.

657
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:10,773
And a strange chant

658
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:15,979
echoed in the night.

659
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:21,184
Yog-Sothoth...

660
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:23,786
Yog-Sothoth!

661
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:21,966
Hello! Is anybody
here?

662
00:49:22,034 --> 00:49:23,401
Hello!

663
00:49:29,942 --> 00:49:32,210
I thought I told you
to stay away from here.

664
00:49:32,278 --> 00:49:34,346
I'm not staying away
from anywhere.

665
00:49:34,413 --> 00:49:35,846
I'm looking for
my girlfriend,

666
00:49:35,913 --> 00:49:37,114
And I wanna see her now.

667
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:39,617
She's not here!

668
00:49:39,684 --> 00:49:42,586
Now get off my land!

669
00:49:42,654 --> 00:49:43,754
I'm going inside!

670
00:49:43,821 --> 00:49:45,889
No, you're...
Don't touch me!

671
00:49:58,837 --> 00:50:00,171
Nancy?

672
00:50:05,444 --> 00:50:07,344
Nancy, it's
Elizabeth!

673
00:50:16,354 --> 00:50:17,704
Nancy?

674
00:50:21,575 --> 00:50:22,858
Stop!

675
00:50:29,733 --> 00:50:31,968
Nancy?
Where are you?

676
00:51:40,968 --> 00:51:43,737
No!

677
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:35,620
There's a car
outside. Who's here?

678
00:52:35,688 --> 00:52:38,623
She came looking
for her friend.

679
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:40,691
Make sense,
will you?

680
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,493
Who's here?

681
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,796
She went up
those stairs.

682
00:52:45,864 --> 00:52:47,598
Elizabeth.

683
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:51,002
Wilbur, where's Elizabeth?

684
00:52:51,069 --> 00:52:52,269
I don't know.

685
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:53,237
He knows.

686
00:52:53,305 --> 00:52:55,406
Shut up,
you old fool!

687
00:52:55,474 --> 00:52:58,376
You're the fool!

688
00:52:58,443 --> 00:53:00,878
I know your plan!

689
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:03,247
You can't succeed!

690
00:53:03,315 --> 00:53:06,583
You disgust me.

691
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:07,818
You've taken
their abuse,

692
00:53:07,886 --> 00:53:10,587
and you've given up.

693
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:13,490
They've broken you.

694
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:17,494
But the Old Ones
are coming back.

695
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,662
I'm going to let
them through.

696
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:22,932
No! I tried

697
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,236
and I destroyed
your mother.

698
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,704
You'll fail, too.

699
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,517
You'll destroy her!

700
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:40,716
Oliver had the book.
It didn't help.

701
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:43,318
He had the wrong girl.

702
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,921
She resisted
and she died.

703
00:53:45,988 --> 00:53:48,524
Now you listen to me.

704
00:53:48,591 --> 00:53:51,660
I'm going to succeed
where you failed.

705
00:53:51,727 --> 00:53:54,196
I'll stop you!

706
00:53:54,264 --> 00:53:56,614
I'll stop you!

707
00:54:10,846 --> 00:54:13,614
Stop... him...

708
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:23,187
Wilbur... those birds...

709
00:54:23,325 --> 00:54:26,560
What does it mean?

710
00:54:26,628 --> 00:54:28,095
They were trying
to capture his soul

711
00:54:28,162 --> 00:54:31,365
as it left his body.

712
00:54:31,433 --> 00:54:33,701
But they're
quiet now.

713
00:54:33,768 --> 00:54:37,371
They didn't get him.
He's free.

714
00:54:37,439 --> 00:54:41,458
Darkness leads
unto darkness.

715
00:54:41,526 --> 00:54:44,927
Let this soul transcend
the bounds of earth

716
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:49,666
and be delivered
to the spirit of darkness.

717
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:53,536
Death shall be
the carriage of this soul.

718
00:54:59,743 --> 00:55:03,813
Let the cry of the birds
transport the spirit.

719
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,716
Yog-Sothoth...

720
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:11,621
Accept this man into
the death of darkness.

721
00:55:11,689 --> 00:55:14,324
Hear me, Old Ones,

722
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:18,193
for your time is coming.

723
00:55:18,261 --> 00:55:19,695
This death shall mark

724
00:55:19,762 --> 00:55:23,232
the beginning
of your journey.

725
00:55:23,299 --> 00:55:26,351
Yog-Sothoth.

726
00:55:26,419 --> 00:55:29,154
Yog-Sothoth.

727
00:55:29,222 --> 00:55:32,925
Nyagh Yog-Sothoth.

728
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:44,627
See? I told you
he was here.

729
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:46,096
He's burying
the old man.

730
00:56:46,164 --> 00:56:50,532
Like hell,
he is!

731
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:51,833
From darkness we came...

732
00:56:51,901 --> 00:56:54,270
All right, hold it!

733
00:56:54,337 --> 00:56:55,737
We bury our trash

734
00:56:55,805 --> 00:56:57,706
at the county dump,
not here!

735
00:56:57,774 --> 00:57:00,242
This is a christian
cemetery.

736
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:04,046
No place here
for your kind.

737
00:57:04,114 --> 00:57:05,547
From darkness
we came...

738
00:57:05,615 --> 00:57:07,016
I said hold it!

739
00:57:07,084 --> 00:57:07,983
Give me that book.

740
00:57:08,051 --> 00:57:09,051
Now, you get out here.

741
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,385
You take your
garbage with you!

742
00:57:10,453 --> 00:57:11,353
When I'm finished.

743
00:57:11,421 --> 00:57:14,289
You're finished now!

744
00:57:14,357 --> 00:57:18,292
All right, hold on!
Hold on, you two!

745
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,294
What in hell are you
trying to do?

746
00:57:20,362 --> 00:57:22,396
I was trying to bury
my grandfather.

747
00:57:22,464 --> 00:57:25,183
We got family
buried here.

748
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,184
We don't want

749
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:27,685
no Whateleys
among them.

750
00:57:27,752 --> 00:57:30,224
We own this plot, and
I have the right to use it.

751
00:57:32,108 --> 00:57:33,841
No one's getting
buried just yet.

752
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:35,310
There's been no
death certificate

753
00:57:35,377 --> 00:57:36,744
issued on this body.

754
00:57:36,812 --> 00:57:37,878
We'll have
to take it back

755
00:57:37,946 --> 00:57:40,115
till it's all
straightened out legally.

756
00:57:46,572 --> 00:57:48,038
Come on, Nancy.

757
00:58:25,142 --> 00:58:26,008
Now, Nancy,
you'll wait

758
00:58:26,076 --> 00:58:27,343
right here, won't you?

759
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:28,744
I'll wait.

760
00:59:34,675 --> 00:59:39,846
Put it back.

761
00:59:45,987 --> 00:59:46,853
Pick it up.

762
01:01:09,918 --> 01:01:11,185
Unh!

763
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:36,943
Hello?

764
01:01:37,011 --> 01:01:38,178
Uh, Cory here.

765
01:01:38,245 --> 01:01:40,246
Raskin just telephoned
me from the asylum.

766
01:01:40,314 --> 01:01:41,514
I thought
you'd want to know.

767
01:01:41,581 --> 01:01:43,149
Lavinia is dying.

768
01:01:43,217 --> 01:01:44,884
From what?
What happened?

769
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:46,485
Well, I'm not sure,
but it sounds as if

770
01:01:46,553 --> 01:01:47,954
all hell's
breaking loose.

771
01:01:48,022 --> 01:01:48,921
Well, can we go
over there?

772
01:01:48,989 --> 01:01:50,223
I'll pick you up.

773
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:52,925
No, it'll be faster
if I meet you there.

774
01:01:52,993 --> 01:01:55,861
Oh, do you remember the girl
that was with me yesterday?

775
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:57,162
Yes.

776
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:58,363
I still haven't been
able to reach her.

777
01:01:58,431 --> 01:01:59,898
It just occurred to me.

778
01:01:59,965 --> 01:02:02,934
She was talking
with your nurse.

779
01:02:03,002 --> 01:02:04,836
Well, Cora's right here,
I'll ask her.

780
01:02:04,904 --> 01:02:07,573
Cora, the girl
with dr. Armitage,

781
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,807
She didn't happen to say

782
01:02:08,874 --> 01:02:10,242
where she was going,
did she?

783
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,610
Why no, doctor.

784
01:02:11,678 --> 01:02:12,777
Well, I'm sorry, Armitage,

785
01:02:12,845 --> 01:02:13,745
You're out of luck.

786
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,080
I'll see you
at the asylum.

787
01:02:15,147 --> 01:02:18,350
All right. Ok.

788
01:02:18,418 --> 01:02:20,752
Now, Cora, I won't
be back tonight,

789
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,221
So why don't you
leave all that work

790
01:02:22,288 --> 01:02:23,622
till the morning?

791
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:25,290
No, I'd rather get it done
this evening, doctor.

792
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:26,658
All right.
Well, suit yourself.

793
01:02:26,726 --> 01:02:27,758
And be sure you...

794
01:02:27,826 --> 01:02:29,427
Be sure you
lock up, won't you?

795
01:02:29,494 --> 01:02:30,228
Good night.

796
01:02:30,295 --> 01:02:31,633
Good night.

797
01:03:02,226 --> 01:03:05,028
We've done
everything we can.

798
01:03:05,096 --> 01:03:06,396
Blood pressure, pulse,

799
01:03:06,463 --> 01:03:09,065
respiration...
Everything is sky-high.

800
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:12,969
So it can't last
much longer.

801
01:03:16,423 --> 01:03:18,458
What caused it?

802
01:03:18,526 --> 01:03:21,611
I wish i knew.

803
01:03:24,348 --> 01:03:26,083
Listen.

804
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:35,974
The birds are in rhythm
with her breathing.

805
01:03:38,512 --> 01:03:41,213
Listen!

806
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:44,917
Yes... my son.

807
01:04:07,823 --> 01:04:09,457
She's finished.

808
01:04:16,832 --> 01:04:17,999
They've stopped.

809
01:04:23,038 --> 01:04:28,359
What was she muttering?

810
01:04:28,426 --> 01:04:30,961
The birds.

811
01:04:31,028 --> 01:04:34,030
That chant.

812
01:04:34,098 --> 01:04:36,767
The Necronomicon.

813
01:04:36,834 --> 01:04:38,334
Dr. Cory,

814
01:04:38,402 --> 01:04:43,991
I've got to get to
the library right away.

815
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:07,513
Land of light...

816
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:13,085
the army of darkness
shall sweep down.

817
01:05:13,153 --> 01:05:17,399
They are gathered like
a horde of avengers,

818
01:05:19,526 --> 01:05:25,706
life within life,
the power that summons.

819
01:05:27,267 --> 01:05:31,970
Come back, Old Ones...

820
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:35,573
Princes of Darkness,

821
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:38,443
and repossess the earth.

822
01:06:22,787 --> 01:06:25,491
Yog-Sothoth.

823
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,880
Yog-Sothoth.

824
01:06:34,731 --> 01:06:37,508
Yog-Sothoth.

825
01:07:38,826 --> 01:07:40,961
I summon you.

826
01:07:41,029 --> 01:07:43,797
Come, brother of darkness.

827
01:07:43,865 --> 01:07:46,033
Leave your prison
and help me

828
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,251
bring the Old Ones through.

829
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:50,087
Brother of my blood,

830
01:07:50,154 --> 01:07:53,190
my soul, I summon you.

831
01:07:53,257 --> 01:07:55,192
The time has arrived.

832
01:07:55,259 --> 01:07:57,411
Now we wait no longer.

833
01:07:57,479 --> 01:08:01,098
We must act.
Upon this sacrifice,

834
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:02,900
shall the journey begin.

835
01:09:06,128 --> 01:09:10,264
"Yog-o-oth. Yog-o-oth.

836
01:09:10,331 --> 01:09:14,068
"Join the circle,
complete the chain.

837
01:09:14,136 --> 01:09:17,055
"Yog-Sothoth is the gate

838
01:09:17,122 --> 01:09:19,490
"whereby the spheres meet.

839
01:09:19,558 --> 01:09:21,525
"And with the gate open,

840
01:09:21,593 --> 01:09:24,762
"the Old Ones shall be.

841
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:28,599
"Man rules now
where they ruled once.

842
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:31,869
"They wait,
patient and potent,

843
01:09:31,937 --> 01:09:34,705
"for here they shall
reign again,

844
01:09:34,773 --> 01:09:37,741
"and rule where they
once walked.

845
01:09:37,809 --> 01:09:41,078
"The Old Ones
broke through of old,

846
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:44,409
"and they shall
break through again".

847
01:09:47,185 --> 01:09:49,902
Yog-Sothoth!

848
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:55,959
We thank thee, o Lord,

849
01:09:56,027 --> 01:09:57,493
for the food we are
about to take

850
01:09:57,561 --> 01:10:00,346
for the nourishment
of our bodies.

851
01:10:00,414 --> 01:10:03,549
Amen.

852
01:10:08,255 --> 01:10:10,656
Something's
bothering Rusty.

853
01:10:10,724 --> 01:10:12,792
Been acting strange,
all right.

854
01:10:14,895 --> 01:10:17,029
What's the matter,
baby lamb?

855
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:37,023
Please...

856
01:11:37,091 --> 01:11:38,658
Lucille?

857
01:11:53,390 --> 01:11:57,359
Ah!

858
01:12:33,062 --> 01:12:36,297
The gate is
opening now.

859
01:12:36,365 --> 01:12:38,366
We don't have
long to wait.

860
01:13:04,592 --> 01:13:07,761
You're one of us now.

861
01:13:16,236 --> 01:13:17,636
It's time.

862
01:13:42,145 --> 01:13:44,396
You saw what Wilbur did
to get the book.

863
01:13:44,464 --> 01:13:48,233
He's going to try to let
the Old Ones through.

864
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,069
Whether they exist or not
doesn't matter.

865
01:13:51,137 --> 01:13:54,172
He's not responsible
for his actions.

866
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,808
If you're right, how are
we going to handle it?

867
01:13:56,876 --> 01:14:00,379
What? Something's
going on.

868
01:14:00,446 --> 01:14:02,381
Well, that's
the Cole place.

869
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:27,204
Harrison.

870
01:14:27,272 --> 01:14:28,729
- I tried to call you, doc.
- What's happened?

871
01:14:28,807 --> 01:14:30,040
All hell's busted loose.

872
01:14:30,108 --> 01:14:31,642
Damn Whateleys.

873
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:34,978
No man would have mutilated
the bodies that way.

874
01:14:35,046 --> 01:14:36,514
I don't say
the Whateleys did it,

875
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:38,148
But damn it,
they're responsible.

876
01:14:38,216 --> 01:14:39,417
Settle down, Reeger.

877
01:14:39,484 --> 01:14:41,218
Settle down? There're
dead people in there.

878
01:14:41,286 --> 01:14:42,720
What do you mean
settle down?

879
01:14:42,788 --> 01:14:43,688
Reeger's right.

880
01:14:47,292 --> 01:14:49,025
Let's go get them!

881
01:14:49,092 --> 01:14:50,293
You can't do this.

882
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,061
You stop them,
Reeger, or I will.

883
01:14:52,129 --> 01:14:53,896
Well, let's go!
My family's not gonna...

884
01:14:53,964 --> 01:14:55,231
Come on, let's go!

885
01:14:55,299 --> 01:14:57,867
Stop! Stop, you can't
kill Wilbur Whateley.

886
01:14:57,935 --> 01:14:59,302
He didn't do this,

887
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:00,437
But he may be
the only man

888
01:15:00,504 --> 01:15:01,871
who can save us
from what did.

889
01:15:01,939 --> 01:15:03,606
Why should
we listen to you?

890
01:15:03,674 --> 01:15:05,107
Well, you all know me.

891
01:15:05,175 --> 01:15:06,909
I delivered most of you.

892
01:15:06,977 --> 01:15:08,645
I'm telling you
to listen to this man.

893
01:15:08,713 --> 01:15:10,179
He's the only one
who can help us.

894
01:15:10,247 --> 01:15:11,614
What do you
want me to do?

895
01:15:12,516 --> 01:15:13,717
Get in your cars,

896
01:15:13,784 --> 01:15:15,385
And meet us at
the Whateley place.

897
01:15:15,453 --> 01:15:20,923
Come on.

898
01:17:33,602 --> 01:17:35,302
Listen!

899
01:17:55,306 --> 01:17:57,907
What in god's name
is that?

900
01:17:57,975 --> 01:18:00,810
I've never heard
anything like that.

901
01:18:00,878 --> 01:18:06,683
Henry, it's really
happening, isn't it?

902
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:09,118
It's moving toward the hill.

903
01:18:09,187 --> 01:18:12,155
The Devil's Hopyard.

904
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:14,123
We've got to get up there.

905
01:19:35,053 --> 01:19:36,420
All right, now,

906
01:19:36,488 --> 01:19:37,954
Let's all spread out,

907
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,057
And all of you,
stay on your toes.

908
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:42,059
Hurry up, let's go.

909
01:20:02,513 --> 01:20:03,896
Start up that way.

910
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:12,037
You all right, Reeger?

911
01:20:12,105 --> 01:20:13,972
Yeah

912
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,140
Go on,
I'll catch up.

913
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,109
I jammed
the damn rifle.

914
01:20:25,251 --> 01:20:27,119
You find anything?

915
01:21:38,756 --> 01:21:42,525
Ah!

916
01:21:42,593 --> 01:21:45,245
Ah!

917
01:22:12,588 --> 01:22:17,525
Ah!

918
01:22:28,588 --> 01:22:30,439
Ah!

919
01:23:32,283 --> 01:23:33,882
My god, what's he doing?

920
01:24:43,484 --> 01:24:49,356
Yog-Sothoth.

921
01:24:49,423 --> 01:24:52,496
Yog-Sothoth.

922
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,094
Yog-Sothoth.

923
01:25:09,793 --> 01:25:12,528
Yog-Sothoth.

924
01:25:14,164 --> 01:25:18,067
Yog-Sothoth.

925
01:25:18,135 --> 01:25:22,138
Yog-Sothoth!

926
01:25:41,073 --> 01:25:44,326
Ah!

927
01:26:06,031 --> 01:26:08,365
No.

928
01:26:08,432 --> 01:26:11,468
Oh, no. No.

929
01:26:11,535 --> 01:26:14,537
I'm sorry, Nancy.

930
01:26:14,605 --> 01:26:16,106
There were 2 children
born that night

931
01:26:16,174 --> 01:26:18,475
25 years ago.

932
01:26:18,542 --> 01:26:20,310
Dr. Cory was told
the other one died,

933
01:26:20,378 --> 01:26:22,546
but it didn't.

934
01:26:22,614 --> 01:26:25,982
It was caught between
this world and another.

935
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:30,604
Wilbur's twin
took after the father.

936
01:26:30,672 --> 01:26:32,889
And the father?

937
01:26:32,958 --> 01:26:35,276
Not of this earth.

938
01:26:39,046 --> 01:26:41,447
It's all over now.

939
01:26:41,449 --> 01:26:43,549
The last of
the Whateleys is dead.
