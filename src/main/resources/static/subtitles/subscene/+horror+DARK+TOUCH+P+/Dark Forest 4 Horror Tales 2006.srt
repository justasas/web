1
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:17,133
lf you don't break your ropes
while you're alive,

2
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,933
Do you think ghosts will do it after?

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,533
Lee Jong-hyuk, So li-hyun

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,967
Kim Young-joon,
Choi Seong-min, Lee Ye-won

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,867
Park Choong-sun

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,067
DARK FOREST

7
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:53,467
The three suspects arrested and
taken into custody last March

8
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:55,167
for the murder of the writer Yoo ll-han

9
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:58,200
were transferred to the National
Mental Hospital yesterday afternoon

10
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,867
The court' ...

11
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:02,533
l'm sorry Jeong-ah.

12
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:10,233
l promised Mother that l won't
pass on this cursed gift to you.

13
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:16,333
Listen to me, Jeong-ah.

14
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:23,133
From now on, you'll be seeing
a lot of things you don't want to see.

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,067
Sometimes, even the deaths of
people you love.

16
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,967
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,467
But it can't be helped.

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,667
This is the only way to save you.

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,267
What' going on, Seon-ah?

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,067
One day,
when you're in my shoes,

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,267
you'll understand.

22
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,267
l just hope that will never happen.

23
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,000
What are you doing!

24
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,833
A bad dream?

25
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:18,933
Yes...

26
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:27,833
Did you know...

27
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:34,333
...that the last thing a person sees

28
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,667
before he dies becomes
his whole memory?

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,833
ls that so?

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,667
Then my memory will be of you.

31
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,167
Now, we'll be meeting our climbing team.

32
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,467
First up is Mr. JEONG Woo-jin,
the captain of this team.

33
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,467
Don't you have anything
to say for our viewers?

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,167
Who me?

35
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,667
Ah, nice to meet you.
l'm Woo-jin.

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,167
BlG BROTHER Woo-jin

37
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,100
Uh, actually l'm the chauffeur,
not the captain

38
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:09,033
Well, our captain' sense of humor
doesn't do justice to his good looks.

39
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:12,333
Now, Ms. KlM Jeong-ah,
our number one female member.

40
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey,

41
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:15,133
WlTCH Jeong-ah

42
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:16,833
leave me out of this.

43
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:20,433
Smile for the fans!

44
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,133
Now! Our one and only ladies man
Mr. LEE Jun-hu

45
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:26,933
This is Jun-hu,

46
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,433
TOMCAT Jun-hu

47
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,933
waiting for
all you lonely ladies out there.

48
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:36,233
l mean really,
that' sooo cheesy.

49
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:38,233
What do you mean?
This is all a part of a grand scheme

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,033
Scheme? What scheme?
Scheme to break girls hearts?

51
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,167
Me? l didn't mean that...

52
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,567
For your viewing comfort,
we'll skip to the next team member

53
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,267
LONELY Seung-heon

54
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,567
Mr. JEONG Seung-heon is so shy
that he' refusing to talk to us.

55
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Well, that' it for our climbing team.

56
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,900
TWlNKlE Se-eun

57
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,600
This has been OH Se-eun reporting
from Hangyeryeong.

58
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:13,800
- Seung-heon?
- Yeah?

59
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,933
Don't l look like a real TV reporter?

60
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,100
Sure.

61
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,333
Here.

62
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:37,133
You keep saying you'll quit...

63
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:43,433
l know...
Since it' no smoking in the forest,

64
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:45,933
l'm really going to quit this time.

65
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,333
This is the last one.
Really.

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,267
- l have your word.
- Yeah.

67
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,400
What are you writing?

68
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,400
You'll know
when you use them all up.

69
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:14,900
Keep smoking if you're curious.

70
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:18,900
Then l guess.
l'll just have to keep on smoking.

71
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,933
You are hopeless.

72
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:29,433
Hey, haven't we spent too much time
on the road?

73
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,533
Yeah, let' hurry up.

74
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:45,333
What do we do?

75
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:49,333
Hey, this isn't the only way in,
you know.

76
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:51,133
Yeah? Where else?

77
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,433
The entrance by the stone pagodas.

78
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,567
l thought they closed it off
last year after the forest fire.

79
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,867
No, from what l've heard,
they just sealed off the entrance.

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,233
You wanna bet?

81
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,033
What shall we do?

82
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,933
Let' ... just go back.

83
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:47,733
Go back my ass
Come and see for yourself.

84
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:50,533
There' another car besides ours.

85
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:07,167
l told you so.

86
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,933
What' up?

87
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:37,900
Can you see anything?

88
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:45,433
You surprised me!

89
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:49,133
Hey, Miss Reporter!
How about carrying some of the bags?

90
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,900
You won't need it unless you get lost

91
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:24,400
so don't look so touched.

92
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:28,100
You... You want me to get lost?

93
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:33,100
l know you're only here because
Jeong-ah asked you to, so cut it out.

94
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,000
Stop making others uncomfortable.

95
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:39,800
You are the only one who
finds me uncomfortable.

96
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:44,933
Hey but still...

97
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,000
We need at least two bottles
for all of us...

98
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:48,500
You are a raging alcoholic!

99
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:54,233
All right, all right.
l was just going to take one anyway.

100
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,467
Hey, be careful.

101
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:21,600
Be careful.

102
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:54,133
We are just getting started.
Keep up.

103
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:07,333
Wow nice! Turn the angle around
a bit and it'll look great.

104
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:10,633
- Shit!
- No? Then never mind.

105
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,567
Hey, look, stone pagodas.

106
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,267
Yes, right.

107
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,567
Hey, 10,000 won for anyone
who can hit it with a stone.

108
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,667
- OK?
- l'm in!

109
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,367
Okay.

110
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,367
Se-eun...

111
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,767
what?

112
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,167
Don't ...

113
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:11,333
You can't just throw things for fun at
what might be someone' ardent wish.

114
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:13,533
Like anybody would care.

115
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:19,133
Shall we go?

116
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:24,633
Hey, let' do it.

117
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,833
Yeah!

118
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,867
Nice...

119
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,667
You...

120
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,867
Jun-hu, about Jeong-ah,
what' up with her?

121
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,767
Oh, typical PTSD. You know,
the post-traumatic stress disorder.

122
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:04,700
After losing her sister in a car crash,

123
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:10,033
she hallucinates from the shock.

124
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:12,233
What about that freaky incident
l've heard about?

125
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,833
Well,

126
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:20,233
Jeong-ah thinks that was a divination,
not a hallucination.

127
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:24,533
As a matter of fact, Jeong-ah' sister
was a famous medium.

128
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,533
Then is she... possessed?

129
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:30,033
Possessed?
l don't know about that.

130
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:34,567
But after her sister died, Jeong-ah does
say some extraordinary things.

131
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,233
You know, the other day...

132
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,767
How are you holding up?

133
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,367
l'm fine...

134
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,567
Look at your shoes.
lt makes you look silly.

135
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,367
Well, you know...

136
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,467
lt' good to be out in the nature

137
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,267
lt' refreshing and feels great.

138
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,567
How about you, Seung-heon?

139
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,500
Huh?
Yeah, sure.

140
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:06,000
We should come more often.

141
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:10,033
Whatever you say.

142
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:35,933
l know it' hard but try to keep up.

143
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:40,133
Yeah, l'm fine.

144
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,733
- Ow!
- Se-eun!

145
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,933
- Are you okay?
- Se-eun!

146
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,633
My ankle...

147
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,267
l don't think it' serious but l don't think
she can keep going either.

148
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,967
l can carry her down on my back.

149
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,767
That' even more dangerous.

150
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,467
We can't go down, and we can't go up.

151
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,200
Bear with me, okay?

152
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,800
This isn't just for show, you know.

153
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:26,733
l guess we'll just have to camp around
here tonight.

154
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:31,833
What?
You... you want to camp here?

155
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:34,033
That' the only thing to do
in this situation.

156
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:07,200
Fresh air...
Glad you joined us?

157
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:11,600
Well, yeah, sort of...

158
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,400
Happy birthday!

159
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:24,233
You got me a birthday present?

160
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:30,933
Yeah, they say a knife brings good luck.

161
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,733
Good luck...

162
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:42,233
But... but... how did you know
it was my birthday?

163
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,633
Woo-jin told me, of course.

164
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,933
He shouldn't have...

165
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,967
Thanks for the present anyway.

166
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,500
Anyway, Jeong-ah.

167
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:08,400
What do you like most
about my brother?

168
00:16:11,133 --> 00:16:19,600
Well, l like him for who he is,
not for a specific reason.

169
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:26,200
For who he is... Yeah, me too.

170
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:34,333
You like him for who he is,
not because he' your brother.

171
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:41,033
What are you talking about?

172
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,033
You liar!

173
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:46,633
Did you know that you touch
your eyebrows when you are lying?

174
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,633
Eye, eyebrow?

175
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:54,133
l don't touch my eyebrows, never.

176
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,400
One thing' for sure, he really cares
about you and he really loves you.

177
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:22,600
Did you guys know that
you can set vodka on fire?

178
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:24,200
Yeah, whatever.

179
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:27,200
l mean it, you wanna bet?

180
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:30,500
Stop betting, you never win anyway.

181
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:35,300
That' just who l am.
Hey, isn't it strange?

182
00:17:35,467 --> 00:17:38,633
You know the forest fire last year
was supposed to be one of the worst.

183
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,933
lt burnt for three days straight.

184
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:44,800
Yeah, the forest must have grown
back really fast.

185
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:47,333
The trees and the plants look
more lush than ever.

186
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:48,633
That' right.

187
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:54,633
lt' as if the forest is
saying that 'you can never kill me.

188
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:58,733
Oooh... you're right.

189
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:00,133
lt' a bit spooky.

190
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,867
This forest lost its soul to the fire.

191
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,767
Lost its soul?

192
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,400
They say that the souls
of people who die

193
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:18,600
in forests are doomed
to wander forever.

194
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,500
That' bullshit.

195
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,000
What do you think, Jeong-ah?

196
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:32,400
Sometimes, unexplainable things happen
in this world.

197
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,467
Do you think
l'm too hard on Seung-heon?

198
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:24,300
l don't mean to
but l'm not sure...

199
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,800
l shouldn't interfere,

200
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:35,100
but maybe
you should try to understand him more.

201
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:42,200
He could be so much more,
but l think he' intimidated by you.

202
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,833
l thought he was going to
get some water.

203
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:54,233
What' keeping him?

204
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,633
He should be back soon.

205
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:15,333
What' wrong, Jeong-ah?

206
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:20,533
lt' Jun-hu, oh my god, Jun-hu.

207
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,733
What' wrong with Jun-hu?

208
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,967
Man, that was embarrassing.

209
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,867
Woo-jin.

210
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,167
Jun-hu' in danger.

211
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,167
What do you mean he' in danger?

212
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,467
l think...

213
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:03,233
Something' happened to him.

214
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:08,833
Jeong-ah, what are you saying?
That kind of things don't happen.

215
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,833
You still don't believe me.

216
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:20,033
lt' not a question of believing
or not.

217
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:28,733
You don't have to believe me.
Let' go find him anyway, please?

218
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,467
Let' go.

219
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,267
Be careful.

220
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,400
Where is everybody?

221
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:03,000
This isn't fun. l'm bored

222
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,433
What' happened to him?

223
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:27,633
Jun-hu! Jun-hu!

224
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,133
Jun-hu...

225
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,533
Jeong-ah, are you okay?
What' wrong?

226
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:51,667
Oh no, l think we're too late.

227
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,267
Too late for what?

228
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:03,400
l think Jun-hu...
he' had an accident.

229
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:06,400
Jeong-ah, please,

230
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:08,300
that' your imagination
running away again.

231
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:13,700
No, no...

232
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:19,000
Se-eun!

233
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:24,833
Se-eun, Se-eun' also in danger!

234
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:26,433
Se-eun?

235
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:39,033
That' it for our climbing team.

236
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:41,933
This has been OH Se-eun reporting
from Hangyeryeong

237
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:45,433
What is that?

238
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,567
This has been OH Se-eun...

239
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:09,400
Who is it?

240
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:13,700
ls it you Seung-heon?

241
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:17,900
Jun-hu?

242
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:21,433
Stop playing around.

243
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,200
Right now, l'm ...

244
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,333
Seung-heon.

245
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,000
What do we do?
Seung-heon is...

246
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,500
What' up?

247
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,300
Where have you been?

248
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,400
Where' Se-eun?

249
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:13,900
ln her tent, probably.

250
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,033
What, what' going on?

251
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:42,933
l don't know...
Jun-hu' gone too.

252
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:44,933
What do you mean he' gone?

253
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:54,633
Get your stuff together.

254
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:57,733
What are you going to do?

255
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,033
We have to find Se-eun
and Jun-hu.

256
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,600
Would, wouldn't it be better if...

257
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:03,867
lf we just went and
called the police?

258
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:08,600
No, we can't leave
without Se-eun and Jun-hu.

259
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:10,000
What?

260
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:17,900
But... but you saw it too.
Someone else' here...

261
00:27:18,633 --> 00:27:21,800
All right.
Then you go down and get help.

262
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:23,100
l'll go look for Se-eun.

263
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:27,800
l, how can l go alone?

264
00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:29,600
Seung-heon, please!

265
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:37,700
Seung-heon, we'll leave after
we search for them, okay?

266
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:48,333
Yes, Seung-heon,
we'll search for a while

267
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,033
and if we can't find them,
we'll go, okay?

268
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,867
Se-eun!

269
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:07,267
Se-eun!

270
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:10,567
- Se-eun!
- Se-eun!

271
00:28:11,933 --> 00:28:12,900
Se-eun!

272
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,700
OH Se-eun!

273
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:16,800
Se-eun!

274
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:45,900
Who...?

275
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,333
l heard her voice.

276
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:57,633
This way!

277
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,167
Who are you?

278
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:24,200
Help!

279
00:29:32,033 --> 00:29:33,500
Jun-hu?

280
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:45,400
Hey, it' me. Se-eun.

281
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,500
What' wrong?

282
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,833
What... what are you doing?

283
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,233
l've lost her.

284
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,767
Woo-jin...
Can we go now?

285
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,667
Seung-heon, l know you're tired but
let' look for them a little longer okay?

286
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,167
l... l'm scared.

287
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,667
When will you grow up?

288
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,767
Woo-jin?

289
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:57,567
Why do l have to do
everything for you?

290
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:05,200
What? l... l never asked you to!

291
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:11,033
Then try to act like an adult!

292
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:15,733
All right, from now on,
l won't say anything

293
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,533
so you don't have to worry about me.

294
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:30,767
Seung-heon! Slow down!

295
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:35,733
Mind your own business!

296
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,433
What the hell' matter with him?

297
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,933
Woo-jin...

298
00:32:57,967 --> 00:33:02,333
Did you hear that?
l can hear something

299
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:13,333
Woo-jin, can't you hear me?

300
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:18,467
Seung-heon, l said slow down!

301
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:29,467
Woo-jin, l said this way,
where are you going?

302
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:50,667
Woo-jin!

303
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,500
Where the hell did he go?

304
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,333
Seung-heon!

305
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,333
- Seung-heon!
- Seung-heon!

306
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:09,733
Woo-jin, l'm sorry.

307
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:22,400
Woo-jin!

308
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:25,433
Where are you?
Seung-heon!

309
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,467
Are you okay?

310
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,833
Seung-heon! Seung-heon!

311
00:36:14,867 --> 00:36:20,233
Jeong-ah... Seung-heon

312
00:36:26,133 --> 00:36:27,500
my little brother...

313
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:48,067
lt' weird, Woo-jin...

314
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:52,667
l don't feel anything.

315
00:36:55,333 --> 00:37:00,667
What' wrong Jeong-ah? l'll believe,
l'll believe anything you say.

316
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:03,267
What' going on?

317
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:06,300
What happened to Seung-heon?

318
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,733
l think Seung-heon...
he' still alive.

319
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,033
Yeah, he can't be dead right?

320
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,033
Let' look for him.
He can't have gone far.

321
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,000
- Seung-heon!
- Seung-heon!

322
00:37:37,467 --> 00:37:40,500
- Seung-heon!
- Seung-heon!

323
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:42,933
- Seung-heon!
- Seung-heon!

324
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:45,233
- Jung seung-heon!
- Seung-heon!

325
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:53,067
You want to rest a little?

326
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:08,467
lt' all my fault.

327
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:13,067
Woo-jin...

328
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,633
Seung-heon is fine...
Don't give up.

329
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,433
When we were little...
You know the boy scouts?

330
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,533
l used to envy the big boys wearing

331
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,900
cool uniforms
and camping in forests...

332
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:48,867
So l went into a forest one night
with Seung-heon.

333
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:54,367
But on the way back,
Seung-heon hurt his leg

334
00:38:56,733 --> 00:39:02,600
l had to go get help

335
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:04,500
So l left him alone

336
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:12,967
Once l came out,
l got scared.

337
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:17,700
What if Seung-heon died?

338
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,600
What should l tell Mom?

339
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,333
My parents asked me
where Seung-heon was,

340
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,433
but l couldn't say anything.

341
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,633
Seung-heon came home on his own
the next afternoon.

342
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,733
l see...

343
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
But the problem didn't stop there.

344
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:54,033
Seung-heon must have understood
my situation so he never said anything.

345
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:06,467
lt was me who pushed him away
and made him a loner.

346
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:08,967
Jeong-ah,

347
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,667
how can l make it up to him?

348
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:35,300
Who is it?

349
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,200
Se-eun?

350
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,367
Se-eun...

351
00:42:27,033 --> 00:42:31,267
You, you killed her!

352
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,133
No, l saved that thing.

353
00:42:41,567 --> 00:42:42,500
What?

354
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:40,733
What did you do with Seung-heon
and Jun-hu?

355
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:46,300
This is the gratitude l get
for saving you?

356
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:48,533
You saw for yourself.

357
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:52,100
Your friends...
They're no longer living.

358
00:43:52,667 --> 00:43:54,500
What bullshit are you talking about?

359
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,700
Yes, it' bullshit...

360
00:43:59,267 --> 00:44:03,533
But unexplainable things happen
in this world.

361
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:09,400
l see that you haven't shed any blood,
fortunately.

362
00:44:11,633 --> 00:44:12,600
What?

363
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:24,067
When l first arrived here
with my wife and children

364
00:44:26,433 --> 00:44:30,167
l never dreamed this would happen.

365
00:44:32,933 --> 00:44:34,367
Let' go.

366
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:35,867
Okay.

367
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:43,533
So nice and refreshing, right?

368
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:38,067
And l set the forest on fire.

369
00:45:38,733 --> 00:45:43,167
What? You expect me to believe you?

370
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:49,233
Whether you believe me or not
is your choice.

371
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:53,233
But if you turn into one of them.

372
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:55,733
l'm going to kill you
without any hesitation.

373
00:45:57,967 --> 00:45:59,133
You bastard...

374
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:01,933
The same goes for you too.

375
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:08,633
lf l turn into one of them,
you have to kill me.

376
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,533
lf you don't break your ropes while
you're alive,

377
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,533
do you think ghosts will do it after?

378
00:46:23,433 --> 00:46:25,800
lt' a poem by Kabir
An lndian poet.

379
00:46:30,433 --> 00:46:31,767
What the hell
are you talking about?

380
00:46:32,533 --> 00:46:35,267
l still have a rope to break.

381
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:41,267
So don't waste you
time and energy

382
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:43,367
and leave the forest immediately.

383
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:48,067
Keep in mind.
Do Not Bleed.

384
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:53,067
lf you meet your friends on the way
Kill them.

385
00:46:54,567 --> 00:46:57,933
Cut their heads off or
burn them

386
00:46:58,067 --> 00:47:00,767
Until they stop moving.

387
00:47:00,933 --> 00:47:02,900
That' the only way you can live...

388
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,833
Shut up, you murderer!

389
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:45,867
Damn it!

390
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:52,267
No, this can't be.

391
00:48:07,733 --> 00:48:09,567
Woo-jin...

392
00:48:47,233 --> 00:48:49,567
lt' okay Jeong-ah.

393
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:56,567
Woo-jin...
What happened to him?

394
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,067
l don't know, l think he' gone.

395
00:49:00,867 --> 00:49:02,200
Woo-jin, l...

396
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:05,800
l saw Jun-hu.

397
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:12,667
He was dead but he looked
as if he was still alive.

398
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,500
l'll call the police as soon as
my cellphone finds signal.

399
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,833
Wait,

400
00:49:42,633 --> 00:49:43,700
no signal.

401
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:52,000
Jeong-ah, Seung-heon is alive!

402
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:24,233
Seung-heon!

403
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:31,900
Seung-heon,
it' me, your big brother.

404
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,000
Woo-jin...

405
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:36,300
He' alive.

406
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,300
He' alive!

407
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:43,400
You remembered... the boy scouts.

408
00:50:44,267 --> 00:50:47,567
Of course, the boy scouts!

409
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:03,867
This? lt hurt like hell
in the beginning

410
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:09,767
but l think l'm numb now.

411
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,367
What happened?

412
00:51:13,633 --> 00:51:18,967
The thing is, l don't know.

413
00:51:20,433 --> 00:51:23,333
Someone came up from behind...

414
00:51:23,467 --> 00:51:25,333
Who...

415
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:38,667
Anyway,
l guess this has brought good luck.

416
00:51:40,067 --> 00:51:44,600
Yeah, l'm glad you're safe.

417
00:51:46,467 --> 00:51:49,200
Let' go now.
We're still in danger.

418
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,467
Woo-jin...

419
00:52:01,767 --> 00:52:02,900
Over there...

420
00:52:07,933 --> 00:52:09,167
This won't do...

421
00:52:10,733 --> 00:52:11,667
Run!

422
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:25,267
That way!

423
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:41,733
Seung-heon, we're nearly there.

424
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,700
Woo-jin, this sound...

425
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:46,900
- Seung-heon
- This sound... l don't want to hear...

426
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:49,000
Woo-jin, this sound...

427
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:05,200
Woo-jin, it hurts really bad.

428
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,433
Seung-heon, we're nearly there...
Hang on...

429
00:53:09,633 --> 00:53:11,600
Yes, it' just ahead of us

430
00:53:58,267 --> 00:53:59,500
Calm down, Jeong-ah.

431
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,033
Your fear' making you see things.

432
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,633
Woo-jin.

433
00:54:08,033 --> 00:54:17,700
What will you do if l turn into
one of them, like Se-eun?

434
00:54:19,633 --> 00:54:21,467
What the hell
are you talking about?

435
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,100
That will never happen.

436
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:27,067
l... l'm just saying... what if...

437
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:28,967
lt' never going to happen, okay?

438
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:31,367
What if it does...

439
00:54:33,433 --> 00:54:40,933
What if you turn into one of them
and try to hurt me and Jeong-ah.

440
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,733
Then what should l do?

441
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:50,333
Woo-jin, l've never...

442
00:54:52,367 --> 00:54:54,300
l've never blamed you for anything.

443
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,900
So...

444
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,733
lf l do turn into one of them,

445
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,833
l want you to finish me off.

446
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,333
Stop it, Seung-heon...

447
00:55:15,333 --> 00:55:19,200
That will never, ever happen.

448
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:31,667
We are... already... lost...

449
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,833
Just like that time
when we were playing boy scouts...

450
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,533
l'm keeping my word this time.

451
00:56:21,433 --> 00:56:24,500
l'll do everything to find help

452
00:56:24,633 --> 00:56:26,400
so take care of
Seung-heon for me, okay?

453
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:28,700
Won't it be dangerous alone?

454
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:34,167
Don't worry, we'll be safe as long as
we keep away from the forest.

455
00:57:01,333 --> 00:57:05,233
You see...
Now, get in and lock the door

456
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,433
Be careful, Woo-jin.

457
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,633
Don't worry about me.

458
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:53,267
What is this place?

459
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,467
Seung-heon...

460
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:53,400
ls that you Jun-hu?

461
00:59:59,133 --> 01:00:00,367
Dammit.

462
01:00:01,033 --> 01:00:03,767
Hey, wake up!

463
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:15,033
What' going on,
you don't remember me?

464
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:37,000
lf l turn into one of them,
you have to kill me.

465
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:04,533
Wait... wait...

466
01:05:21,767 --> 01:05:23,400
Wait... wait...

467
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:26,267
Wait!

468
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:18,733
Seung-heon, please,
come back to your senses...

469
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,500
Please, it' me.

470
01:06:24,433 --> 01:06:25,500
Please!

471
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:47,333
lf l'm to blame
for your transformation.

472
01:08:50,233 --> 01:08:52,267
l hope this sets everything right.

473
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,333
Seung-heon!

474
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,700
Where' Jeong-ah?

475
01:10:00,067 --> 01:10:01,233
You haven't ...

476
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:05,733
Seung-heon!

477
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:10,633
You can't have...

478
01:10:14,333 --> 01:10:15,367
Talk to me!

479
01:10:16,233 --> 01:10:17,967
Tell me you haven't
you bastard!

480
01:10:21,033 --> 01:10:22,167
You...

481
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:40,967
Wake up!

482
01:10:45,767 --> 01:10:49,400
lt' all my fault so please...

483
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,300
Get hold of yourself,
JEONG Seung-heon!

484
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,000
l'm your brother.

485
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:01,133
Yes,

486
01:11:04,867 --> 01:11:06,333
it' me, Seung-heon.

487
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,167
Seung-heon, please...

488
01:11:51,633 --> 01:11:52,667
Woo-jin?

489
01:11:54,967 --> 01:11:56,300
Please.

490
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,067
Jeong-ah!

491
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,667
Woo-jin...

492
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,333
Are you okay, Jeong-ah?

493
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:08,333
Yeah, lm fine...

494
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,733
Seung-heon...

495
01:14:16,733 --> 01:14:22,200
l'm sorry, Woo-jin...

496
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:12,933
l'm sorry...

497
01:15:15,233 --> 01:15:19,700
l'm sorry, Seung-heon...
So sorry...

498
01:15:22,733 --> 01:15:25,833
Woo-jin, l...

499
01:15:26,933 --> 01:15:36,867
Seung-heon... l promised that
l will never leave you alone again.

500
01:15:45,433 --> 01:15:48,067
Woo-jin, l'm sorry...

501
01:15:50,133 --> 01:15:51,667
l...

502
01:15:54,033 --> 01:15:58,467
No, l'm the one who' sorry.

503
01:16:00,433 --> 01:16:05,500
l didn't even carry out his last wish.

504
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,600
Woo-jin...

505
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:25,033
Jeong-ah, you set him free.

506
01:16:35,067 --> 01:16:36,233
Woo-jin...

507
01:16:49,033 --> 01:16:50,867
Now it' my turn.

508
01:17:03,633 --> 01:17:05,000
Get in the trunk, Jeong-ah.

509
01:17:05,133 --> 01:17:07,000
What will you do on your own?

510
01:17:07,133 --> 01:17:08,500
l have an idea.

511
01:17:08,933 --> 01:17:11,400
- But Woo-jin...
- Please, Jeong-ah!

512
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,233
l can't lose you.

513
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:20,833
Promise me that you'll live.
That you won't die...

514
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,033
l promise, l promise.

515
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,633
Hurry... now...

516
01:18:13,633 --> 01:18:14,667
Woo-jin...

517
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:50,633
l'm sorry Jun-hu.

518
01:19:15,433 --> 01:19:23,467
l think... you won the bet this time.

519
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,400
lt' all over.

520
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,133
lt' all over.

521
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:34,833
Woo-jin.

522
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,800
Thanks for staying alive.

523
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,667
What' wrong Jeong-ah?

524
01:20:15,033 --> 01:20:19,167
Nothing... Nothing...

525
01:20:21,167 --> 01:20:22,233
Jeong-ah...

526
01:21:14,133 --> 01:21:20,667
Remember
what Seung-heon said before?

527
01:21:22,333 --> 01:21:26,867
What? Sorry, Jeong-ah,
l didn't catch that.

528
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:33,433
lf l turn into one of them,
like Seung-heon,

529
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,533
can you kill,

530
01:21:39,667 --> 01:21:41,900
no, set me free?

531
01:21:46,567 --> 01:21:50,400
Jeong-ah... lt' all over.

532
01:21:50,567 --> 01:21:54,000
So answer me.

533
01:22:04,067 --> 01:22:11,433
l should have, if l loved that person,

534
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:14,433
like Seung-heon.

535
01:22:22,133 --> 01:22:25,067
You mean that?

536
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:32,667
Yes, even you.

537
01:22:35,467 --> 01:22:41,767
No... if it happened to you.

538
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,367
l'm not sure if l could.

539
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:55,200
lf you don't break your ropes
while you're alive,

540
01:22:58,067 --> 01:23:00,433
Do you think ghosts will do it after?

541
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:51,333
So this is how it should have been
all along...

542
01:23:54,267 --> 01:23:54,867
Jeong-ah.

543
01:23:55,067 --> 01:24:00,900
Woo-jin, please don't come near me.

544
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:10,333
l don't know why,
but this isn't over yet.

545
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:19,900
l... l saw you die.

546
01:24:20,567 --> 01:24:21,533
What?

547
01:24:25,433 --> 01:24:31,433
And the vision of me killing you.

548
01:24:35,433 --> 01:24:36,867
But l...

549
01:24:39,933 --> 01:24:42,867
lf you turn into one of them,

550
01:24:45,933 --> 01:24:52,133
l don't think l can set you free.

551
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:53,167
Jeong-ah, that...

552
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:54,533
Don't come near me.

553
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,167
What do you think you're doing?

554
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,333
Jeong-ah...

555
01:25:12,700 --> 01:25:15,933
This is the only way to save you.

556
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,133
What are you doing?

557
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,100
My sister saw my death.

558
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:26,400
That' why she killed herself
instead of me.

559
01:25:26,567 --> 01:25:28,433
And passed on this cursed gift to me.

560
01:25:28,567 --> 01:25:29,600
What?

561
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:32,533
Now l know...

562
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:38,967
From now on, you will also see
a lot of things that you don't want to see.

563
01:25:39,133 --> 01:25:42,667
Jeong-ah...
what are you talking about?

564
01:25:45,633 --> 01:25:47,367
This is my last wish so please...

565
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:51,367
Please.

566
01:25:54,367 --> 01:25:57,133
Please break my rope
while l'm still alive.

567
01:26:02,233 --> 01:26:04,267
No matter how l die here,

568
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:08,133
l'll turn into that horrible thing.

569
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:09,900
Jeong-ah...

570
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:14,933
l would rather...
that you kill me.

571
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:22,033
Set me free with your own hands.

572
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:32,000
Woo-jin, l can hear it.

573
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:33,000
Jeong-ah!

574
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:35,300
What shall l do?
Woo-jin, please...

575
01:26:35,467 --> 01:26:36,933
- Woo-jin!
- Jeong-ah!

576
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:45,467
Jeong-ah!

577
01:27:00,133 --> 01:27:01,167
Woo-jin,

578
01:27:06,933 --> 01:27:07,900
Please...

579
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:10,200
Please...

580
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,700
Woo-jin, please...

581
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:29,833
Woo-jin, please...

582
01:27:39,867 --> 01:27:40,900
Please...

583
01:27:56,033 --> 01:27:57,767
Shouldn't you quit?

584
01:29:50,567 --> 01:29:56,000
Thank you for becoming
my whole memory.

585
01:31:28,667 --> 01:31:30,033
Now, let' see

586
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:32,667
Ooh, not bad...

587
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,633
Good!

588
01:31:43,367 --> 01:31:47,700
Slow down, what' the hurry?

589
01:32:03,967 --> 01:32:06,433
Cheon-hye! Se-ah!

590
01:33:12,467 --> 01:33:15,433
l still have a rope to break.

591
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,267
Wow... nice...

592
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:01,733
What are you doing?
Hurry up!

593
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,033
We should be safe here, right?

594
01:34:14,533 --> 01:34:16,700
They wouldn't chase us
all the way up here.

595
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:21,533
lt' over, at last...

596
01:34:34,333 --> 01:34:36,867
What are you saying?
This is just the beginning

597
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,033
The three suspects previously in custody
at the National Mental Hospital

598
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,067
for the murder of the writer Yoo ll-han

599
01:35:00,233 --> 01:35:03,133
escaped this morning around 2 a.m.

600
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,533
They reportedly killed
more than ten wardens

601
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,133
and police officers
during their escape,

602
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:11,733
but the actual number of casualties
is yet to be confirmed.

603
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:14,133
This is breaking news.

604
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:18,233
The three suspects
who killed 18 people

605
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:21,000
During their escape
from the National Mental Hospital...

606
01:35:21,133 --> 01:35:22,900
...are still on the loose
but the police

607
01:35:23,067 --> 01:35:25,400
have found the car they used
for their escape...

608
01:35:25,567 --> 01:35:27,300
...in a forest
in Chungcheongbuk-do Province

609
01:35:27,467 --> 01:35:28,600
The police also found two other cars

610
01:35:28,767 --> 01:35:31,800
one belonging to the PARK family
who went missing in 2004

611
01:35:32,033 --> 01:35:35,533
and the other to a Mr. JEONG,
who disappeared in 2005.

612
01:35:35,733 --> 01:35:40,067
The police are focusing on finding out
the relationship between the two cases.

613
01:35:40,233 --> 01:35:42,767
Detail news will be on 8 p.m. tonight...
