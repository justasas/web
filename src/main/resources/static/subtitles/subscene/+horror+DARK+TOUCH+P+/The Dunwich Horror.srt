00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,260
                        OH, GOD!

7
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:51,155
             IT WAS A BRILLIANT 
             LECTURE, DOCTOR.   

8
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:52,490
                YEAH. THE BEST  
                 OF THE YEAR.   

9
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:55,960
CAREFUL, ALL THESE BRAVOS WILL  
GO TO AN OLD Ph.D.'s HEAD.      

10
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,962
AND NOW, IF YOU'LL TAKE         
THE <i> NECRONOMICON</i>               

11
00:04:58,029 --> 00:04:59,514
AND RETURN IT                   
TO THE LIBRARY,                 

12
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:02,850
I'LL MEET YOU THERE             
AS SOON AS I CAN.               

13
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:05,453
     DOCTOR, DON'T FORGET WE'RE 
     PICKING YOU UP FOR DINNER. 

14
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:06,470
     I'LL BE THERE.             

15
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,405
AND YOU TAKE GOOD CARE          
 OF THAT BOOK.                  

16
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:17,232
             YOU KNOW, SOME OF  
             THAT STUFF HE SAID 

17
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,299
             SORT OF GOT TO ME. 

18
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:19,367
         [Laughs]               
                IT'S RIDICULOUS.

19
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:20,435
     NO, NO. I KNOW             
     WHAT YOU MEAN.             

20
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:21,669
 ESPECIALLY THOSE               
 CREEPY PEOPLE                  

21
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,638
AND SOME OF THE                 
THINGS THEY DID.                

22
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:29,444
CAN YOU LIFT THAT?              

23
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:32,330
COULD I SEE THAT                
BEFORE YOU PUT IT AWAY?         

24
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,466
        DO YOU ALWAYS SNEAK UP  
         ON PEOPLE LIKE THAT?   

25
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:38,369
OH, MY, YOU SCARE EASILY.       

26
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:40,705
I'D REALLY LIKE TO GLANCE       
THROUGH THAT BOOK,              

27
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,573
THE <i> NECRONOMICON.</i>              

28
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,475
                 WELL, THAT'S   
                    IMPOSSIBLE. 

29
00:05:44,543 --> 00:05:46,977
I'VE TRAVELED A LONG WAY.       

30
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:51,232
         THE LIBRARY IS CLOSING.

31
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,067
             COME ON.           
        GIVE ME 5 MINUTES.      

32
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:55,002
                 ABSOLUTELY NOT!

33
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,604
             WAIT A MINUTE.     

34
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,272
            I DON'T SUPPOSE     
         IT WOULD DO ANY HARM.  

35
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,258
                 ARE YOU CRAZY? 

36
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:04,929
            UH, WHY DON'T YOU   
            TAKE IT IN THERE?   

37
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,281
THANK YOU.                      

38
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:14,789
 YOU MUST BE                    
    INSANE.                     

39
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:17,058
OH, IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.         
HE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.          

40
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,360
         HE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT? 
         THAT BOOK IS PRICELESS.

41
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:20,895
     OH, STOP WORRYING          
     ABOUT THE BOOK.            

42
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,730
    DID YOU NOTICE HIS EYES?    

43
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:25,266
HE'S REALLY GOT GREAT EYES.     

44
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,034
         NANCY, WHAT DO YOU DO? 

45
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:28,603
             YOU'RE GIVING      
             HIS RAREST BOOK

00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,138

            THAT COMES ALONG.   

47

THE BOOK, PLEASE.

61
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,639
         I WAS ONLY READING IT. 

62
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:40,975
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA               
WHAT THIS VOLUME IS WORTH?      

63
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,943
             IT'S ONE OF A KIND.

                     OF COURSE, 
             A GENERATION AGO,  

65
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,947
                     THERE WAS  
                 ANOTHER COPY...

YOUNG MAN, I AM FAMILIAR        
WITH DUNWICH.                   

68
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,807
             I KNOW.            

69
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:58,810
YOU'VE READ MY PAPER            
ON OLIVER WHATELEY?             

70
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:00,745
        HE WAS A GREAT MAN.     

71
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,580
     THEY HANGED HIM.           

72
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,082
         THEY WERE FOOLS.       

73
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,051
         WHO'S TO SAY?          

74
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:08,820
        I'M WILBUR WHATELEY,    

75
00:08:08,887 --> 00:08:10,354
        OLIVER'S GREAT-GRANDSON.

76
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:13,357
 THEN YOU KNOW WHO I AM.        

77
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:15,259
         DR. HENRY ARMITAGE.    

78
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:21,198
YES. IT'S A PLEASURE            
TO MEET A WHATELEY.             

79
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,600
             THANK YOU.         

80
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:27,304
[Nancy] DOCTOR?                 

81
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:28,673
        OH, IT'S EASY TO SEE    

82
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,208
         WHY YOU 2 GIRLS WERE   
         SO EFFECTIVELY CHARMED.

83
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:33,043
         I'M VERY GLAD TO HAVE  
         MET THIS YOUNG MAN.    

84
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:35,279
     WE SHARE A MUTUAL INTEREST.

85
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:39,100
IN FACT, I'D LIKE TO TALK       
FURTHER WITH YOU.               

86
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,336
    [Armitage] WE MIGHT LEARN   
 A GREAT DEAL FROM EACH OTHER,  

87
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:42,737
        DON'T YOU THINK?        

88
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:45,306
     ABOUT DUNWICH, PERHAPS?    

89
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:48,376
DUNWICH, DR. ARMITAGE,          
MIGHT APPEAR TO YOU             

90
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,212
AS JUST ANOTHER SMALL TOWN.     

91
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,715
THE PEOPLE OF DUNWICH ARE       
JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.        

92
00:08:53,782 --> 00:08:55,683
 THEY'RE JUST MORE HONEST       
 ABOUT IT.                      

93
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:58,620
    YOU SEE MAN AS A RATHER     
     DISMAL CREATURE.           

94
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:01,756
 YES. WHY NOT?                  

95
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:03,824
 LOOK AROUND.                   

96
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:05,660
YOU'LL SEE WHAT'S THERE.        

97
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:08,379
FEAR, AND FRIGHTENED            
PEOPLE WHO KILL                 

98
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:10,748
WHAT THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND.     

99
00:09:10,815 --> 00:09:13,584
            IT'S LATE.          
        I SHOULD BE GOING.      

100
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:16,420
DR. ARMITAGE,                   
I'D LIKE PERMISSION             

101
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:22,277
            TO STUDY            
        THE <i> NECRONOMICON.</i>      

102
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:25,329
     FOR WHAT REASON,           
         MR. WHATELEY?          

103
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:28,966
     WELL, I'M A STUDENT        
     OF THE OCCULT.             

104
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:32,353
     AND THAT BOOK IS           
        LIKE A BIBLE.           

105
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:34,822
     A RATHER ODIOUS COMPARISON.

106
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,874
 UH, NO, NOT REALLY.            

107
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:39,644
         IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SAY 
     THE BOOK IS IRREPLACEABLE? 

108
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:42,212
NO. YOU'RE AFRAID.              

109
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,082
             AFRAID? POSSIBLY.  

110
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,884
         IN ANCIENT TIMES,      
         THAT BOOK WAS SAID     

111
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:49,754
        TO UNLOCK THE GATES     
     TO ANOTHER DIMENSION,      

112
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:52,156
            TO ANOTHER RACE     
                 OF BEINGS.     

113
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,926
                 I DO NOT SHARE 
                 THOSE BELIEFS, 

114
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,227
                 NOR DO I FULLY 
                UNDERSTAND THEM.

115
00:09:57,295 --> 00:10:00,297
     HOWEVER, I KNOW ENOUGH     
     ABOUT STRANGE THINGS       

116
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,899
     NOT TO LAUGH AT THEM.      

117
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,735
    I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU    
    I'D TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT.   

118
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:06,404
                     I'M SORRY, 
             I COULDN'T POSSIBLY

119
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,172
                    LET THE BOOK
                OUT OF MY HANDS.

120
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,008
     I NEED IT IN MY OWN        
         FIELD OF STUDY.        

121
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:13,644
 DR. ARMITAGE, WILL YOU         
     LEND ME THE BOOK?          

122
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,479
                     I WILL NOT.

123
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:17,848
THAT'S YOUR LAST WORD?          

124
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:20,217
                 YES.           

125
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,069
LET ME GET                      
PART OF THAT.                   

126
00:10:21,136 --> 00:10:22,236
                OH, NONSENSE.   

127
00:10:22,304 --> 00:10:23,487
                 NANCY'S CAR    
                     IS HERE.   

128
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:24,989
         I'LL TAKE YOU          
         TO THE HOTEL.          

129
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,892
                THANK YOU.      

130
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,060
     GOOD NIGHT.                

131
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:30,527
                    GOOD NIGHT. 

132
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,863
     MR. WHATELEY.              

133
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:35,432
MAYBE WE'LL MEET AGAIN.         

134
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,734
                     PERHAPS.   

135
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:48,713
I GUESS I KIND OF PUT           
THE DAMPER ON A NICE EVENING,   

136
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,015
BUT I CAN'T STAND POMPOSITY.    

137
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,918
     I THINK YOU'VE MADE        
    YOUR POINT QUITE CLEAR.     

138
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,454
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER     
 HE'S GONNA BE IN TOWN?         

139
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,941
UH, HIS LAST LECTURE'S          
     NEXT MONDAY.               

140
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:01,425
         MONDAY.                

141
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,460
     THAT'S ONLY 3 DAYS.        

142
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:06,030
        I WANTED TO HEAR        
     ONE OF HIS LECTURES.       

143
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,081
     YOU WON'T BE HERE          
         THAT LONG?             

144
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:09,600
    NO. I HAVE TO GO BACK       
     TO DUNWICH TONIGHT.        

145
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:12,069
 AS A MATTER OF FACT,           
 I SHOULD GET MOVING,           

146
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:13,370
OR I'LL MISS MY BUS.            

147
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:14,672
         WHAT TIME'S YOUR BUS?  

148
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,140
    9:15.                       

149
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:20,962
                    9:15?       
             YOU JUST MISSED IT.

150
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:22,830
            DAMMIT.             

151
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:29,553
    THERE ISN'T ANOTHER BUS     
    UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING.     

152
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:33,757
                 WELL, UH,      
             I COULD DRIVE YOU. 

153
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:35,959
OH, IT'S TOO LATE.              
I COULDN'T LET YOU DO THAT.     

154
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,130
                 NO, NO, REALLY.
            I MEAN, I'D LIKE TO.

155
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:40,697
         OH, FINE.              

156
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,007
 IT'S ONLY A COUPLE             
 MORE MILES, NANCY.             

157
00:11:50,074 --> 00:11:55,162
         I HOPE SO. WE'RE       
     ALMOST OUT OF GAS.         

158
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,864
                     OH, SAVED. 

159
00:12:06,557 --> 00:12:07,925
                     IT'S PAST  
                 CLOSING TIME.  

160
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,760
        OH, COULDN'T I HAVE     
         A LITTLE GAS?          

161
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:10,995
                 OK. HOW MUCH?  

162
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:14,131
     CAN YOU FILL IT UP,        
            PLEASE?             

163
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:16,800
                 SERVICE        
             WITH A SMILE.      

164
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:19,669
                SAY, HOW FAR    
                IS THE TOWN?    

165
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:21,772
OH, IT'S DOWN THAT WAY.         

166
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,191
 BUT WE TURN OFF                
 RIGHT UP HERE.                 

167
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:28,162
                     I'M SORRY. 
        I WANTED TO SEE DUNWICH.

168
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:29,263
 IT'S ALL RIGHT.                

169
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,266
 THERE'S NOT MUCH               
 TO SEE AT NIGHT.               

170
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,170
BESIDES, EVERYTHING IN TOWN     
CLOSES UP PRETTY EARLY.         

171
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:46,714
                        $1!     

172
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,549
    $1? I ASKED YOU             
    TO FILL IT UP.              

173
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:52,553
                         $1!    

174
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,056
 AREN'T YOU GONNA FINISH        
         THE WINDOW?            

175
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:11,438
[Nancy] BOY, I COULD NEVER GET  
 USED TO TREATMENT LIKE THAT.   

176
00:13:11,507 --> 00:13:13,508
[Whateley] THEY'VE              
TREATED ME THAT WAY             

177
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:16,243
SINCE THE DAY                   
I WAS BORN.                     

178
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,045
     THEY NEVER CHANGE.         

179
00:13:18,113 --> 00:13:20,648
         THEY'RE STILL          
     THE SAME FRIGHTENED,       

180
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,750
     SUPERSTITIOUS FOOLS.       

181
00:13:58,253 --> 00:14:01,589
        THAT'S EVEN CRAZIER     
             THAN YOU SAID.     

182
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:03,490
 WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN      
     AND SEE THE INSIDE?        

183
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,792
                 OH, NO, NO.    
                I'D LIKE TO,    

184
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,427
                 BUT REALLY,    
            I SHOULD START BACK.

185
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:09,430
     JUST HAVE A DRINK...       
        OR CUP OF TEA.          

186
00:14:09,497 --> 00:14:11,766
             I REALLY SHOULDN'T.

187
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:15,486
             PLEASE.            

188
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:16,587
                    OK.         

189
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:42,596
                 [Nervous laugh]

190
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:53,674
     WELL?                      

191
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:55,609
 WHAT DO YOU THINK?             

192
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:56,743
            [Nervous laugh]     

193
00:14:56,811 --> 00:15:01,082
         WELL, I DON'T KNOW     
         WHAT TO THINK.         

194
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:06,220
I'M GLAD YOU FIND IT            
    INTERESTING.                

195
00:15:06,288 --> 00:15:08,389
     WOULD YOU LIKE             
     A CUP OF TEA?              

196
00:15:08,457 --> 00:15:09,656
                 PLEASE.        

197
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:11,959
            FINE.               

198
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,227
 IT'S BEEN A LONG RIDE.         

199
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:14,895
        IF YOU FEEL             
    LIKE FRESHENING UP,         

200
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:22,003
 THERE'S A BATHROOM             
RIGHT THROUGH THAT DOOR.        

201
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,387
             THANK YOU.

[Strange noises like wind]      

206
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,177
WILBUR!                         

207
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:40,117
WILBUR!                         

208
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:42,653
THIS IS MY GRANDFATHER.         

209
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,055
 I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU.        

210
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:47,157
 WE WERE JUST GOING             
 TO HAVE SOME TEA.              

211
00:18:47,225 --> 00:18:50,494
 I'LL SEE YOU                   
 WHEN WE'RE FINISHED.           

212
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:57,501
    I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU.    

213
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:58,736
     SORRY.                     

214
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:08,929
         SIT DOWN, NANCY.       

215
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:12,232
                 I THOUGHT YOU  
                 LIVED ALONE.   

216
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:15,636
 GEE, I'M SORRY                 
 HE FRIGHTENED YOU.             

217
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:17,170
DO YOU WANT                     
SUGAR OR CREAM?                 

218
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:19,406
                 NO, THANK YOU. 

219
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:21,508
TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I DIDN'T    
THINK HE'D BE UP THIS LATE.     

220
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:22,609
             OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

221
00:19:22,676 --> 00:19:24,477
                 IT'S JUST THAT 
                 HE STARTLED ME.

222
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:28,681
         WILBUR, WHEN YOU       
     WERE IN THE KITCHEN,       

223
00:19:28,749 --> 00:19:30,884
     I HEARD STRANGE SOUNDS.    

224
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:33,153
     OH? WHAT KIND OF SOUNDS?   

225
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:34,221
         I'M NOT SURE.          

226
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:37,457
             I MEAN,            
     IT SOUNDED LIKE WIND...    

227
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:39,126
         OR THE OCEAN.          

228
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:41,161
     THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.        

229
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:42,930
     THIS PLACE IS SO OLD.      

230
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:45,716
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS,            
EVERYTHING KIND OF CREAKS.      

231
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:46,817
                    OH, WILBUR, 
                     I'M SORRY. 

232
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,018
                     I DROPPED  
             SOMETHING BEFORE.  

233
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,119
         OH?

         OH. [Chuckles]         

236
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:03,100
                 THAT'S NOTHING.

237
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,768
                 IT'S ALL RIGHT.

238
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:11,692
             WELL...            

239
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,160
             I GUESS I'D        
         BETTER START BACK.     

240
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:15,528

         IT'S LATE. I MUST GO.

         I UNDERSTAND.          

243
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:42,255
    WELL, YOU COME BACK AND     
     VISIT SOON, WILL YOU?

                 WHAT'S WRONG?  

247
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,032
 HELL, I DON'T KNOW.            

248
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,234
     I WISH I COULD HELP, BUT I 
     DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT CARS.

[Sighs] I DON'T THINK           
THIS THING'S GONNA START.       

250

 MAYBE WE OUGHT                 
 TO PHONE A GARAGE.             

251

            HAVE A TELEPHONE.   

253
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:05,345

NOW WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

                THIS IS REALLY  
                 A GOOD IDEA.   

257
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:26,699
             I'M COMPLETELY

I'M SURE YOU'LL FEEL            
BETTER IN THE MORNING.          

261
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,674
                 OH, YES. YES.  

262
00:21:34,742 --> 00:21:35,942
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS ROOM,      

263
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,744
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN USED         
FOR YEARS AND YEARS.            

264
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:39,212
                     OH, NO, NO.
                DON'T APOLOGIZE.

     SHE'S OUT HERE?

277
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:40,257
SUPPOSE SHE GOES UP THERE?      

278
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:41,158
                 SHE WON'T.     

279
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:43,593
         SHE HAS NO REASON TO.

         COME HOME LAST NIGHT.  

289
00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:04,117
         SHE MUST'VE DRIVEN     
             THAT BOY HOME.     

290
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:05,818

         WELL, DIDN'T YOU       
        TRY TO TELEPHONE?

         NOT TO HAVE CALLED ME.

         I WAS RAISED           
     BY MY GRANDFATHER,         

315
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:09,215

 ALL THE THINGS HE KNOWS.       

316
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:10,683

    THAN MOST KIDS,             

317
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:12,352

        BEEN SO BAD.            

318
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,321
         WELL, I COME           
     FROM THE CITY AND--

        SUCH PEACE OF MIND.

419
00:32:01,017 --> 00:32:04,220
     THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL      
         TOWN SQUARE.           

420
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:06,689
                70 YEARS AGO,   
             THERE WAS A BIG    
            OAK TREE RIGHT THERE

421
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:09,492
                 IN THE MIDDLE  
                 OF THE STREET.

             PEOPLE OF DUNWICH

                 LYNCHED MY     
             GREAT-GRANDFATHER. 

424
00:32:13,964 --> 00:32:15,431

             HANG THERE

                TO THE GROUND.

429
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,868
         WHY DID THEY DO IT?    

430
00:32:34,935 --> 00:32:36,002
                 BECAUSE HE     
                 DIDN'T BELIEVE 

431
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,237
                     IN WHAT    
                 THEY BELIEVED. 

432
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:40,640
             BECAUSE HE WASN'T  
            AFRAID OF THEIR GOD 

433
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,942
     OR THEIR DEVIL EITHER,     
         FOR THAT MATTER.       

434
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,010
             IN FACT, HE THOUGHT

435
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:45,444
             THEY WERE PRETTY   
                MUCH ALIKE.     

436
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:49,064
 WHAT DID HE BELIEVE IN?        

437
00:32:49,132 --> 00:32:50,400
         IN ANOTHER             
         RACE OF BEINGS         

438
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:53,202
     FROM A DIFFERENT           
         DIMENSION.             

439
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,870
            AN EARLIER RACE,    
            SUPERIOR TO MAN.    

440
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:56,038
         AND HE BELIEVED        

441
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:58,441
             THEY COULD BE      
             BROUGHT BACK.      

442
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,643
        YOU MEAN THEY           
    HANGED HIM FOR THAT?        

443
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:02,211
                YES.            

444
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,546
             THEY TRUMPED UP    
             A MURDER CHARGE    

445
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,415
             TO COVER IT UP.    

446
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,883
             A GIRL HAD         
         DISAPPEARED AND--      

447
00:33:07,951 --> 00:33:09,218
             THEN WITHOUT       
         A SHRED OF EVIDENCE,   

448
00:33:09,286 --> 00:33:11,187
            THEY WENT AFTER HIM.

449
00:33:11,254 --> 00:33:12,288
        THEY CLAIMED HE USED HER

450
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:14,290
     IN SOME SORT OF SACRIFICE. 

451
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,248
                     YOU MUST BE
                 WORRIED, TOO,

             BIRD OF AN AILMENT,

471
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,400

472
00:34:14,468 --> 00:34:15,568

                     THE CREEPS.

479
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:30,016
     BUT WHY?                   

480
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:32,519
                 WELL...SOME SAY

481
00:34:32,586 --> 00:34:33,586
                        THAT OLD
                        WHATELEY

482
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,888

483
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:38,891
                    THAT THERE'S
                 SOMETHING ELSE.

484
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:41,194
     WHAT DO YOU MEAN           
     "SOMETHING ELSE"?          

485
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:44,781
             I--I DON'T KNOW    
            EXACTLY, BUT, UH... 

486
00:34:44,848 --> 00:34:46,248
             WHEN I WAS         
             A LITTLE KID,      

487
00:34:46,316 --> 00:34:47,349
                THE OTHER       
             CHILDREN AND I,    

488
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,418
         WE THOUGHT THE OLD     
             WHATELEY HOUSE     

489
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:49,903

490
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,404

         BELIEVE THAT ANYMORE,  

491
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:52,755

492
00:34:52,823 --> 00:34:54,524
             AND SO DOES        
             EVERYONE ELSE.     

493
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:55,892
         ANYWAY, THE OLD MAN    
             AND WILBUR,        

494
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:57,359
         THEY HAVEN'T           
             ALLOWED            

495
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,028
 ANYONE ON THE PLACE            
             IN YEARS.          

496
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:01,130
             OH.                

497
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:04,233
 WELL, A FRIEND OF MINE         
 IS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.        

498
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:05,568

        YEAH.

        WITH WILBUR.            

500
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,721
             WILBUR WHATELEY    
            HAS A GIRLFRIEND?   

501
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:10,657
             OH, I DON'T        
             BELIEVE IT!        

502
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:12,909
 WELL, HASN'T IT EVER           
     HAPPENED BEFORE?           

503
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:17,480
         NOT WITH ANY GIRL      
         AROUND HERE.           

504
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:20,900
         I SAW YOUR NAME        
     ON THE BIRTH RECORDS.      

505
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:22,402
                         WELL...

506
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:23,536
                     YOU HAVE ME

507
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:27,407
                 IN AN AWKWARD  
             POSITION, DOCTOR.  

508
00:35:27,474 --> 00:35:29,542
                     AND BEFORE 
                    I CAN REVEAL

509
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,743
                ANYTHING TO YOU,

510
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:31,845
         I MUST KNOW THE PURPOSE

511
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:33,646
            OF YOUR INQUIRY.    

512
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,382
OF COURSE. DR. CORY,            

513
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,651
        THIS WILL SOUND         
        QUITE FANTASTIC,        

514
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,019
            BUT I ASK           
        YOUR INDULGENCE.        

515
00:35:40,087 --> 00:35:41,754
     PLEASE BEAR WITH ME        

516
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:46,359
        AND THEN DECIDE         
         FOR YOURSELF.          

517
00:35:46,427 --> 00:35:48,861
         WHERE THE WHATELEYS    
             ARE CONCERNED,     

518
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:49,929
         THERE IS VERY LITTLE   

519
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:52,098
         THAT IS NOT FANTASTIC. 

520
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:54,550
 I WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON.      

521
00:35:54,618 --> 00:35:56,252
                 LOOK...        

522
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,421
             I DON'T WANT       
             TO WORRY YOU,      

523
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,555
                BUT IF I        
             HAD A FRIEND       

524
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:00,856
             DOWN AT WEIRD      
             WILBUR'S,

                     I'D GET HER
                 OUT OF THERE.  

526
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:06,629
         LET ME PUT IT          
        THIS WAY, DOCTOR.       

527
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:08,264
THE LEGEND OF

528
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,500

 LONG AGO                       

529
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:11,867
 THE EARTH WAS INHABITED        

530
00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:15,271
 BY A SPECIES                   
 FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION.        

531
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,608
WITH CERTAIN CHANTS             
FROM THE BOOK,                  

532
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:21,844
        COUPLED WITH ANCIENT    
        RITES AND SACRIFICES,

     THIS RACE, THE OLD ONES,

                 AND MANKIND?   

536
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:35,758
    DESTROYED.                  

537

                 WHATELEY,      

539
00:36:38,395 --> 00:36:40,329
                 YOU THINK IT'S 
             ACTUALLY POSSIBLE  

540
00:36:40,397 --> 00:36:42,265
                 THAT HE MIGHT  
                 BELIEVE THAT?  

541
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:45,635
    THE BOOK, THE GIRL...       

542
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:49,372
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.     

543
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:51,073

             THE LEGEND,        

544
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:52,542

             OF WILBUR,         

545
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,510
             HE'D BE CAPABLE    
                 OF ANYTHING.   

546
00:36:54,578 --> 00:36:55,578
             IF HE DOES ATTEMPT 

547
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,313
                ONE OF THOSE    
                    RITUALS,    

548
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:01,217
             THAT GIRL IS IN    
                 GRAVE DANGER.  

549
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:04,554
    WELL, IT'S HARD             
     TO ACCEPT.                 

550
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:06,789
 BUT THEN, IT WOULDN'T          
    BE THE FIRST TIME           

551
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:08,357
             THAT SOMEONE ELSE  
             PAID THE PENALTY   

552
