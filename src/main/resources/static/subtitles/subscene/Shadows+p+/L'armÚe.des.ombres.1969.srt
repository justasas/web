00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:02,019
<i>"Unhappy memories!
Yet I welcome you...</i>

2
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,108
<i>You are my long-lost youth... "</i>

3
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:57,718
ARMY OF SHADOWS

4
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,817
We're taking a little detour.
You're not in any hurry?

5
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,777
Not at all.

6
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,186
My partner's just gotta
pick up a few provisions.

7
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,314
You do what you can
in these lousy times.

8
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,649
Of course.

9
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,317
You'll be okay there.

10
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,280
It's the best camp in France.
A camp for Germans.

11
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,783
I don't understand.

12
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:47,370
During the Phony War,
we expected lots of prisoners.

13
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,414
Naturally,
we didn't take a single one.

14
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,125
But now the camp
comes in handy.

15
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,710
How lucky can you get.

16
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,046
You said it.

17
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:54,395
<i>Same old story.
Who are they? How do we treat them?</i>

18
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:58,524
<i>Some are sent without trial
and kept here indefinitely.</i>

19
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,654
<i>Others are released quickly
and regain influence in the region,</i>

20
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,866
<i>or the prefecture,
when it's not in Vichy.</i>

21
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:12,830
<i>"Philippe Gerbier, 41,
eminent civil engineer.</i>

22
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,959
<i>Quick-witted.
Independent-minded.</i>

23
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,504
<i>Aloof, sarcastic manner. "</i>

24
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,507
<i>Use the stick.</i>

25
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,552
<i>"Possible connections. "</i>

26
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,430
<i>Use the carrot.</i>

27
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,768
<i>"Suspected of Gaullist sympathies. "</i>

28
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,520
<i>Use the stick.</i>

29
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,691
<i>"Released for lack of evidence. "
Influence.</i>

30
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,152
<i>Use the carrot.</i>

31
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:52,578
I'm assigning you to a building
intended for German officers.

32
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,458
I appreciate the honor.

33
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,057
<i>Use the carrot... indeed.</i>

34
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:17,728
<i>But use it with caution.</i>

35
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,221
- Philippe Gerbier.
- Colonel Jarret du Plessis.

36
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:39,602
I don't know why you're here,
but I'll tell you why I am.

37
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:44,064
In a café, I called
Admiral Darlan a jackass.

38
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,401
Today I add
that Pétain is a jackass too

39
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,070
for letting the navy
bully the army!

40
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,489
At least you're here
for a good reason.

41
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,074
Aubert, pharmacist.

42
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,536
Know what a Mahler shell is?

43
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,998
It’s a cone-shaped container

44
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,251
for producing chemical reactions
under pressure.

45
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,214
I’m a chemist,
and naturally I had a Mahler shell.

46
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,966
I Was reported
for illegal possession,

47
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,510
but I never got a hearing.

48
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,596
Octave Bonnafous.

49
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,265
Traveling salesman.

50
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:22,770
I happened to be crossing a square
during a Gaullist demonstration.

51
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,564
No one's in charge.
They're all jackasses!

52
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,399
They cancelled my pension.

53
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,860
Where do I sleep?

54
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,279
As acting barracks officer,

55
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:36,784
I suggest you take
the corner mattress.

56
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,462
Legrain, communist.

57
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,258
His name's Armel.
A schoolteacher and a Catholic.

58
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,677
- He asleep?
- He’s very ill.

59
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,304
- No infirmary?
- Full up.

60
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,849
Do you play dominoes?

61
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,811
- Sorry, no.
- We can teach you.

62
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,647
Thanks,
but I’m not cut out for it.

63
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,607
Then excuse us.

64
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:12,319
We just have time to finish
our game before lights out.

65
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,823
<i>The commander's not stupid.</i>

66
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:20,577
<i>He sandwiches me
between three fools and two lost souls.</i>

67
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,579
Out walking so early?

68
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,081
I work at the power plant.

69
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,583
Good job?

70
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:12,254
Not even an extra crumb of bread.
But I work to keep in practice.

71
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,685
See you, comrade.

72
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,150
You a communist?

73
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,194
But I do have comrades.

74
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,500
<i>There were all nations and races.</i>

75
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,260
<i>Russians.</i>

76
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,349
<i>Poles.</i>

77
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,731
<i>Kabyles.</i>

78
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,625
<i>Jews of every nation.</i>

79
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,679
<i>Gypsies.</i>

80
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,809
<i>Yugoslavs.</i>

81
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,270
<i>Romanians.</i>

82
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,647
<i>Czechs.</i>

83
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,985
<i>Anti-Nazi Germans.
Anti-Fascist Italians.</i>

84
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,237
<i>Anti-Franco Spaniards.</i>

85
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,745
<i>And black marketeers
who stood out from the rest.</i>

86
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,678
Everything okay?

87
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,932
I once laid
a power line in Savoy.

88
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,436
- You an electrical engineer?
- Like yourself.

89
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,814
Oh, no, you must really
be somebody.

90
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,444
But we could talk shop
once in a while.

91
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:27,241
Sure.

92
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,914
<i>The Catholic teacher
died one night</i>

93
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,250
<i>without a sound, as usual.</i>

94
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,294
<i>Some Kabyles removed his body.</i>

95
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,297
<i>I never even heard his voice.</i>

96
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,174
I’m not sad.
Armel is better off this way.

97
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,949
The score will be settled.

98
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,119
Mr. Gerbier.

99
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,706
I have an idea.

100
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,584
I’ll tell you tonight.

101
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,360
Two things
make escape impossible:

102
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,695
the barbed wire and the sentries.

103
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,823
The ground
under the wire is uneven.

104
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:37,663
I can blind the sentries
long enough by cutting the power.

105
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,749
Why haven't you tried
to escape before?

106
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,378
I wouldn't go without Armel,

107
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,463
and I wouldn't do it alone.

108
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,466
You I can trust.

109
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,094
Why tell me all this?

110
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,554
They need you on the outside.

111
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,559
Turn off the light
and get some sleep.

112
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:01,978
Good night.

113
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,875
<i>The communist and I
secretly worked out an escape plan.</i>

114
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,043
<i>We gradually eliminated obstacles.</i>

115
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,838
Let's go, Gerbier.

116
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,257
Take your things.

117
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,477
Hurry up!

118
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,475
Tell Legrain good-bye for me.

119
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,438
But -

120
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,568
Jackasses.

121
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,153
Good-bye, gentlemen.

122
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,096
LINE OF DEMARCATION

123
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,106
Travel permit, please.

124
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,630
This is our chance.

125
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:46,591
I’ll get up
to ask the guard something.

126
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,427
You run through the two doors.

127
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,597
This one here
and the door to the street.

128
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,142
Good luck.

129
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:47,253
Excuse me, sir.
Could you spare a cigarette?

130
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:48,815
<i>The mighty fortress, Europe,
is fighting bolshevism.</i>

131
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:53,027
<i>Marshal Stalin wants
to defend his city, Stalingrad.</i>

132
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:54,570
What do you want?

133
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,824
<i>But Stalingrad
will be taken and renamed.</i>

134
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,160
A shave.

135
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:15,777
<i>The Marshal said...
The Marshal did...</i>

136
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,654
<i>The Marshal keeps his promises.</i>

137
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:46,265
All done.

138
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,274
I’ll get your change.

139
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,283
Take this.

140
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,748
It’s not very smart,
but it's all I have.

141
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,351
<i>A note from the organization
Paul Dounat belonged to -</i>

142
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,687
<i>his name was now
Vincent Henry -</i>

143
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,982
<i>had instructed him to be
in Marseilles mid-afternoon</i>

144
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,694
<i>to meet a comrade he knew
outside the courthouse.</i>

145
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,948
<i>Dounat had been
at the appointed spot for a few minutes.</i>

146
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,271
Police. Your papers.

147
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:28,201
Fine. But I must ask you to come along
for some simple fact checking.

148
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:09,784
A nasty job.

149
00:31:09,952 --> 00:31:13,329
You may hate bowlers, Félix,
but you still have to wear one.

150
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,248
Only when we get out.

151
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:17,917
Look at him.

152
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:22,213
He sold you out,
along with Zephyr and the radioman.

153
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,674
There's no point

154
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:28,010
in providing any proof
or asking you questions.

155
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,316
We should have
dropped him long ago.

156
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,193
It’s my fault.

157
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,613
We're too few
for so many missions.

158
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,116
Le Bison, can't you step on it?

159
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,910
Not unless you want
to attract attention.

160
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,454
I’m in a hurry too.

161
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,332
I have to fix that old transmitter...

162
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,128
and repair
our delivery agent's bicycle.

163
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:04,630
And there's
a parachute drop tonight.

164
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,550
- Do you have my new papers?
- They're on me.

165
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,177
Want them now?

166
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:37,997
Driving up there
will attract attention.

167
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,373
We'll walk.

168
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,626
- I’ll come too.
- It’s not necessary.

169
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,002
Really it's not.

170
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:49,342
I agree.

171
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,810
I’ll be back after dark,
just in case...

172
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,929
One false move
and you're a dead man.

173
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:55,199
Christ! That place was empty
When we rented.

174
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,118
Keep moving anyway.

175
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,753
In the back room.

176
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,548
Is he the traitor we have to...?

177
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:12,341
Yes, that's him.

178
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,301
And you're the chief?

179
00:34:24,104 --> 00:34:27,565
Claude Le Masque.
He’s been begging for a tough job.

180
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:32,278
I came early to prepare things
and discovered the neighbours.

181
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:36,115
They must've moved in
last night or this morning.

182
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,119
I phoned Félix at once,
but you were already on the way.

183
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:41,996
We'll manage somehow.

184
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,623
We can question him
in the attic.

185
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,668
I've set up a table
and some chairs.

186
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,503
We're not here for a trial.

187
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,297
We're here for this.

188
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:54,508
But you can't!
They'll hear everything next door.

189
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,802
Listen.

190
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,973
The walls are paper-thin.

191
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:04,310
The Brits could've sent
the silencers we asked for.

192
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,646
Let's try to find a better spot.

193
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,236
How could you do it?

194
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:23,746
Nothing doing.

195
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,249
The cellar connects
with the one next door.

196
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,252
The attic carries sound
even more.

197
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,131
We need a good knife.

198
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,719
Le Bison always carries one.

199
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,138
A knife?
You can't be serious!

200
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:42,973
I won't let you.

201
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,350
Félix...

202
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,353
check the dining room
or the kitchen.

203
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:51,065
You can't do this.
I’m begging you. This is murder.

204
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,443
In any case,
we're here to kill, correct?

205
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,405
Yes, but not like this.
We have to -

206
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,950
I know.
Do it the right way.

207
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,744
I’m not afraid.
I swear I’m not.

208
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,956
But it's my first time, you see?

209
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,835
It’s our first time too.
Isn't that obvious?

210
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,379
Nothing.

211
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,591
We could leave him here
till Le Bison gets back.

212
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,385
Out of the question.

213
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:22,930
We're all busy.
I want to tell the boss the job's done.

214
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,515
Damn it to hell!

215
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:28,686
We can't bash his head in
with a gun, can we?

216
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,440
Gag him.

217
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,277
Strangle him.

218
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,741
With our hands?

219
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,744
There's a towel in the kitchen.

220
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:40,716
Stop that!

221
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,802
Dounat has to die.
That's why you're here.

222
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:49,308
You wanted a tough job.
You got it. Don't complain.

223
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:22,633
Sit him up in the chair.
Félix, stand behind him.

224
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,804
I’ll hold his arms.
Le Masque will hold his legs.

225
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,359
I swear it won't hurt.

226
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,055
Let's go.

227
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,765
Coming.

228
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,075
I didn't think we could do it.

229
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,661
Neither did I.

230
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,292
Always carry
cyanide capsules on you.

231
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,420
If you're caught, use them.

232
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,883
I will.

233
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,716
Glass of rum.

234
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,006
Jean-François!

235
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,805
You haven’t changed.
Still young and handsome.

236
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:22,933
Neither have you.
What brings you to Marseilles?

237
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:27,020
I sold my garage outside Paris
and opened a bike shop here.

238
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,480
What are you up to?

239
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,315
Nothing at all.

240
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,653
I have an appointment.

241
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,613
Walk with me a bit?

242
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,448
Sure. I’ll be right out.

243
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,328
Wait for me five minutes?

244
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,747
Five minutes,
but not a lifetime.

245
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,219
Still on a lucky streak?

246
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:02,389
You got some nerve,
wearing that pilot's jacket.

247
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,516
Well, screw them!

248
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,184
Then what?

249
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:07,686
What?

250
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:09,646
Is that all you'd do to them?

251
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,524
As for the war,
if there's no sport in it -

252
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:15,110
What if I gave you some sport?

253
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,611
Real sport?

254
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,741
You'd have to get up early,

255
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,160
spend nights traveling,

256
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,829
and never ask questions.

257
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,748
Keep talking.

258
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,626
Come by my shop.
Here’s the address.

259
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,046
Nothing in writing.
Memorize it.

260
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,965
And not a word to anyone.
- You're crazy.

261
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,925
You say that,
but with a woman -

262
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,219
- I don't have one.
- And that girl?

263
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,264
I said five minutes,
but she'll wait a lifetime.

264
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,933
We always confide
in our parents.

265
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,852
Mine are dead.

266
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:52,189
My only brother's in Paris.

267
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,733
I worship him...

268
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:57,736
but there's no risk
of me telling him anything.

269
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,580
LYON TALENT AGENCY

270
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,588
Is the director expecting you?

271
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:18,590
No, Mr. Roussel.

272
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,675
Please come this way.

273
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,025
I came at once.

274
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:38,985
<i>We have an emergency.</i>

275
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,863
How many men
do you have for Gibraltar?

276
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:45,325
Two Canadian commandos
from Dieppe,

277
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:48,161
three RAF pilots
who were shot down,

278
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:52,290
and two Belgians sentenced
to death by the Germans.

279
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:54,584
With me, that makes eight.

280
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:58,713
Where will they wait for the sub?
They're watching the clinic.

281
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:04,469
Can't we scatter them around?

282
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,222
No. They'd do something stupid.

283
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:10,225
The Canadian colonel
goes to the café.

284
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,520
He thinks you can't detect
his accent.

285
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:20,152
We'll only know
when the sub arrives the day before.

286
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:23,655
Take them all to the Viellat farm.

287
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,532
All of them?

288
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:29,119
So much for total security.

289
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,705
We're not an insurance company.

290
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,583
In these conditions,
on the contrary.

291
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,712
It all depends on the man
in charge of them.

292
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,216
I have just the man.
You don't know him.

293
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:47,304
He did a few assignments for me.
He was just fine.

294
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:52,350
He’s in Paris delivering
a transmitter to Mathilde.

295
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,394
When's he due back?

296
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,521
Should be tomorrow morning.

297
00:46:56,731 --> 00:47:00,984
Brief him right away, so everything
is ready by tomorrow night.

298
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,987
I’ll join them at the last minute.

299
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:07,574
And you get some rest.

300
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:10,160
- After you're gone.
- No, before.

301
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,370
You won't have time later.

302
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:03,296
<i>We inform travelers
that all luggage will be inspected</i>

303
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,006
<i>at the exit.</i>

304
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,891
Open the suitcase.

305
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,690
No black market goods?

306
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,192
What's that?

307
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,447
As you can see, a radio.

308
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:54,866
All right, move along.

309
00:50:35,408 --> 00:50:36,574
No problems?

310
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,202
No problems.

311
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,912
Twice in a row.

312
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,554
Tell Félix the transmitters
need new crystals.

313
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:59,222
The wavelengths changed.

314
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,392
All right.
Can I help you?

315
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:04,352
Certainly not.

316
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,812
- The other radio's there.
- Okay. A bite to eat?

317
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,315
No, there's someone
I need to see.

318
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,164
Greetings, Saint Luc!

319
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:51,209
Little Jean.

320
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,465
All the books are in place.

321
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,176
As well as the harpsichord...

322
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:02,804
and the oboe.

323
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,557
Nothing's changed.

324
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,434
Oh, the temperature has.
No more coal.

325
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:12,230
So to keep from freezing,
I bought this.

326
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,237
For working at night
and for meals.

327
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:22,532
But say, how'd you get here?

328
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,701
I hope you have an Ausweiss.

329
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:29,622
Saint Luc has come down to earth!
Saint Luc knows what an Ausweiss is.

330
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:33,084
Yes, I have one.
And not only that -

331
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,547
Not only that, I’m starving.

332
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,883
We'll have lunch
right away. Marie!

333
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,509
Yes, Mr. Luc.

334
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:43,428
What's on the menu today?

335
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:46,472
Rutabagas,
like yesterday, Mr. Luc.

336
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,018
- What else?
- Unrationed cheese.

337
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:54,314
And there's some butter left,

338
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,316
but no more bread.

339
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,985
I’ve got loads of bread tickets.

340
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:03,281
I can let you have them.

341
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:09,579
You're doing badly.
You used to be a gourmand.

342
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,624
I still am,
but what's one to do?

343
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,793
What about the black market?
And resourcefulness?

344
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,545
Marie's scared of the police -

345
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,797
And so are you, Saint Luc.

346
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,484
I store up heat.

347
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,739
I felt the heat myself today.
Twice.

348
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:52,163
It’s those trains and crowded subways.
You can suffocate.

349
00:54:56,001 --> 00:55:00,672
<i>I wondered if Mathilde, whom
I'd only just met, wasn't closer to me</i>

350
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,758
<i>than you, dear brother,
whom I’d always loved,</i>

351
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:06,052
<i>whom I still love,</i>

352
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,180
<i>but with whom I share
nothing but memories.</i>

353
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:25,154
<i>I left for Marseilles that evening.</i>

354
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,658
<i>Much later, I recalled having felt</i>

355
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:31,494
<i>a sort of... foreboding.</i>

356
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:38,061
So, Madame Viellat,
quite a hotel you run.

357
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:46,069
Good evening, sir.

358
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,784
Well?

359
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,369
The fisherman will be ready
at midnight.

360
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,206
He can take everyone
in a single trip.

361
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:02,960
Madeleine will show you the way
to avoid any patrols.

362
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,295
Fine.

363
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,380
- Do I go back?
- No.

364
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:09,092
There'll be an extra passenger.

365
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:11,302
It’s the big chief.

366
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,097
There are too many in our boat.

367
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:17,975
You'll take him in another boat.
Le Bison will bring him.

368
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:22,230
Wait for my signal once I’m aboard.
Three short lights and one long.

369
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:23,689
Got it.

370
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,363
We're in a hurry tonight,

371
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:32,323
so how much do I owe you?

372
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:34,617
I’ll do the bill another time.

373
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:38,329
You always say that.

374
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:41,207
You keep coming back,
so you must like it here.

375
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:46,003
Walk in single file.

376
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,465
Not too close,
but stay in sight of each other.

377
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,301
Not a sound, not a word.

378
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:47,648
No nonsense. I’m armed.
What're you doing here so late?

379
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,650
And you?

380
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:51,986
I’m Augustine Viellat's
brother-in-law.

381
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,363
The farmer's wife?

382
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:57,158
I’m checking
if the coast is clear.

383
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:59,619
- And?
- No problem.

384
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,288
The gendarmes
passed by up above.

385
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:06,209
The Germans don't know the area
and trust customs.

386
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,627
And customs?

387
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,922
That's a good one.
Customs is me!

388
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,633
I’m the officer
for the whole area.

389
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,593
That is a good one.

390
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,595
Time to board.

391
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,501
Good luck, chief.

392
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:40,094
<i>Strange to think how the big chief
looks the same as anyone else.</i>

393
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:46,392
<i>In that boat, the apex and base
of the pyramid meet.</i>

394
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:53,691
<i>Odd geometry! I must ask
Saint Luc about it after the war.</i>

395
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:39,362
So glad to travel with you.

396
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,072
Same here.

397
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,189
I can't send
all the arms you request.

398
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:02,236
As you know, the English have little
confidence in the French Resistance.

399
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:06,323
They want all available planes
for missions in Germany.

400
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,576
But I can increase
your transmissions.

401
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:13,038
I’ll send you some available
radio operators

402
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,083
and provide backup
to your agents

403
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:19,795
to improve the landing fields
for our Lysanders.

404
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:02,004
<i>An hour before the ceremony,
Jardie asked me to attend.</i>

405
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:38,267
The war will be over for the French
when they can see this great movie.

406
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,711
<i>I heard about Félix
that same day.</i>

407
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:27,806
<i>I still had a lot to do in London,</i>

408
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:32,436
<i>but with his arrest,
I couldn't stay a minute longer.</i>

409
01:10:32,604 --> 01:10:35,439
<i>I decided to return that night.</i>

410
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:11,743
You've never jumped before?

411
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,036
No, never.

412
01:12:13,204 --> 01:12:17,040
Be careful
when your feet hit the ground.

413
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:19,459
Don't try to avoid falling.

414
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:22,129
Bend your knees and roll.
Understand?

415
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,464
More or less.

416
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:40,919
<i>In my absence and after Félix's arrest,
Mathilde had moved down to Lyon.</i>

417
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:44,297
<i>She proved herself
a first-rate organizer.</i>

418
01:20:44,632 --> 01:20:46,883
<i>I made her my assistant.</i>

419
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:17,497
<i>The chief had told me
she was a remarkable woman,</i>

420
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:19,332
<i>but she still astonished me.</i>

421
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,835
<i>She knows both how to command
and how to carry out orders.</i>

422
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:26,339
<i>She is strong-willed,
methodical and patient.</i>

423
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:34,055
<i>She spent days studying the layout
of the Lyon military medical school,</i>

424
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,807
<i>now Gestapo HQ.</i>

425
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:38,268
<i>She learned Félix was in the cell</i>

426
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,396
<i>reserved for those to be tortured.</i>

427
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:46,317
<i>She wanted to breach
the walls with explosives.</i>

428
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:49,862
<i>She had to give up that plan</i>

429
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:53,866
<i>for another one
requiring various disguises.</i>

430
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:20,852
<i>She found a new hideout
for my command post.</i>

431
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,864
<i>She couldn't have found
a safer spot.</i>

432
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:36,659
<i>My new host
was Baron de Ferté Talloir.</i>

433
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,287
<i>Ex-cavalry officer,
needless to say.</i>

434
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:42,999
Before the war,

435
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,752
I was a sworn enemy
of the Republic.

436
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:51,382
I organized my sharecroppers,
kennelmen and huntsmen

437
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:55,094
into a squadron armed
with hunting rifles and pistols.

438
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:59,515
I was ready
to lead a cavalry charge

439
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:03,519
against the local prefecture
in the event of a Royalist uprising.

440
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:11,194
<i>His squadron, perfectly trained
and organized, still exists</i>

441
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:13,279
<i>and guarantees my security.</i>

442
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:21,579
<i>The baron invited me to use his grounds
as a drop point and landing strip.</i>

443
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:25,625
<i>His wishes came true
beyond all expectations.</i>

444
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,255
<i>What a strange carousel!</i>

445
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:08,543
<i>As one plane descended,</i>

446
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:13,047
<i>another one just like it
circled low over the field.</i>

447
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:16,050
<i>The steady drone of its motor</i>

448
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:18,845
<i>covered the landing and takeoff
of the first plane,</i>

449
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:21,264
<i>which then covered
for the other.</i>

450
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:23,683
<i>That night,
in two operations,</i>

451
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:26,978
<i>four men arrived from London
and four others returned.</i>

452
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:31,190
<i>Le Bison, Le Masque,
Jean-François and Mathilde</i>

453
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,860
<i>handled security
for the operation.</i>

454
01:25:45,599 --> 01:25:49,018
And your husband?
Does he know about your activities?

455
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:50,937
Certainly not.

456
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:53,481
Neither does my daughter.

457
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:02,198
That's her.

458
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:04,992
She's 17.

459
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,955
Don't carry it on you.

460
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:12,208
You're right.
I’ll get rid of it.

461
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:16,754
Before we get back to what
I don't dare call "routine" matters,

462
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:20,383
we have to take care of Félix.

463
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:25,179
He has no cyanide tablets on him.

464
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,890
I’m not worried
about him talking...

465
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,811
but he probably
can't escape torture.

466
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:35,982
The Gestapo won't let you
commit suicide.

467
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:41,988
We have to spare him the suffering
that could go on for days, even weeks.

468
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,657
I’ve given it some thought.

469
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:47,994
There are no two ways about it.
- You found a way?

470
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:51,998
We have to get into Gestapo HQ
and bring Félix out.

471
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:57,336
Mathilde, I want to save Félix,

472
01:26:57,671 --> 01:27:02,300
but I can't commit a combat group
to such a desperate mission.

473
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:05,094
Who's talking
about a combat group?

474
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:09,348
With Le Masque, Jean-François,
and Le Bison, I should manage.

475
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:10,892
And how!

476
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:14,520
What's your plan?

477
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:17,857
Le Bison, can you get us
three German uniforms?

478
01:27:18,025 --> 01:27:20,276
- Sure thing.
- Go to it.

479
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:25,531
Our first obstacle is to contact Félix
and let him know.

480
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,743
I haven't figured it out yet,

481
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:30,369
but I will.

482
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:35,041
Félix has to be ready
and waiting for us.

483
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,878
I’ve been trying
to reach him myself.

484
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:43,007
You'd think a German architect
built that medical school.

485
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:46,886
You can't get in.
- True, it won't be easy.

486
01:27:48,639 --> 01:28:13,412
It’s hot.

487
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,607
<i>Mr. Gerbier...</i>

488
01:28:42,985 --> 01:28:45,528
<i>I have neither
Le Masque's courage...</i>

489
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,781
<i>nor Le Bison's strength...</i>

490
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:52,284
<i>nor Mathilde's daring.</i>

491
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:56,914
<i>I won't take part in this mission.</i>

492
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:00,126
<i>But I’m sure</i>

493
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:02,753
<i>that Mathilde</i>

494
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:05,798
<i>and my comrades will succeed.</i>

495
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,761
<i>Don't try to find me.</i>

496
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,359
"Mr. Dupont, 6 rue du Boeuf.

497
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:11,864
Saint Jean knows lots of things
about the Resistance. "

498
01:30:23,919 --> 01:30:25,586
How did you manage?

499
01:30:26,171 --> 01:30:27,505
Oh...

500
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:37,973
We'll only use two uniforms,
Guillaume.

501
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:40,976
I know, Madame Mathilde.

502
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:09,755
NO ADMITTANCE

503
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:32,278
You're not doing this
without me.

504
01:31:32,863 --> 01:31:35,656
We're certainly
not doing it with you.

505
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:38,576
Remember what you said.

506
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:41,579
"You have no right
to sacrifice anyone. "

507
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,123
Least of all when it's you.

508
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:47,334
But that goes
just as much for you.

509
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,545
Now, about Félix -
- May I?

510
01:31:50,297 --> 01:31:51,714
Two men -

511
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:54,258
that looks normal.

512
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:57,219
But three would be too many.

513
01:31:57,387 --> 01:32:00,306
When Jean-François was here,
you wanted three uniforms.

514
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:03,142
But at the last moment
I’d only have used

515
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,061
Le Masque and Le Bison.

516
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:08,314
Jean-François...

517
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,151
I trusted him.

518
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:14,653
Me too,
but that's not what I mean.

519
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:21,660
I just never thought
he'd leave us like that.

520
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:39,154
Who is this man?

521
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:41,740
<i>The man denounced in the letter.</i>

522
01:33:53,295 --> 01:33:55,004
You can go in.

523
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:24,700
Naturally, Dupont is
the only name you have.

524
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:26,327
Naturally.

525
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,579
What organization are you with?

526
01:34:28,955 --> 01:34:31,457
I don't understand.

527
01:34:31,624 --> 01:34:34,376
You know the risk you're taking?

528
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:41,008
Being shot under a false name.
Your fate would remain a mystery.

529
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:25,969
<i>I decided to leave that haven.
Maybe I felt it coming.</i>

530
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,806
<i>Three days later,
the baron and his men</i>

531
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:31,433
<i>were arrested
and shot without trial.</i>

532
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:30,200
What is it?

533
01:36:36,499 --> 01:36:41,170
We're to transfer
a certain Félix Lepercq to Paris

534
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:45,549
to the headquarters
of Obersturmführer Bömelburg.

535
01:36:47,844 --> 01:36:49,845
Yes, a terrorist. Hurry up.

536
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:53,015
It’s urgent.
- Get out.

537
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:36,934
Wait here.

538
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:50,734
An ambulance
from the Paris Gestapo

539
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:54,488
is here for a terrorist,
Félix Lepercq.

540
01:39:54,656 --> 01:39:57,115
Notify the doctor on duty.

541
01:39:57,283 --> 01:39:59,451
Let him issue
the transfer permit.

542
01:41:50,229 --> 01:41:52,022
Can you hear me?

543
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:55,066
Mathilde, Le Bison
and Le Masque are here.

544
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:57,861
I’ll help you.

545
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:01,990
Are you in a lot of pain?

546
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:52,499
It’s no use.

547
01:42:54,752 --> 01:42:56,670
He’ll be in great pain...

548
01:42:57,964 --> 01:42:59,631
right up to the end.

549
01:43:53,519 --> 01:43:55,061
It’s impossible.

550
01:43:55,688 --> 01:44:00,191
I can't let you transport
a dying man. I’m sorry.

551
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:04,821
Very well.
I’ll file a report.

552
01:46:57,745 --> 01:47:00,038
I have some cyanide capsules.

553
01:47:00,372 --> 01:47:02,207
Do you want one?

554
01:47:33,906 --> 01:47:36,282
We could have saved Félix.

555
01:47:38,035 --> 01:47:39,536
No one could.

556
01:47:41,622 --> 01:47:43,331
Not even you.

557
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:52,257
Besides, you're wanted
by the police.

558
01:47:52,883 --> 01:47:55,760
You'd better lie low for a while.

559
01:47:57,054 --> 01:47:59,514
Take the next plane out.

560
01:47:59,682 --> 01:48:01,391
You're not serious.

561
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:04,686
And the maquis groups
springing up all over?

562
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:08,273
They have to be organized,

563
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:11,317
trained and given supplies.

564
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:15,405
No one can replace me for now.

565
01:48:17,867 --> 01:48:21,327
And if you're caught?
Then we'd have to replace you.

566
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:44,475
Police!

567
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:48,646
So Germaine serves good food?

568
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:52,817
Meat at every meal
without tickets?

569
01:48:54,987 --> 01:48:57,947
Identity check for everyone!

570
01:49:01,744 --> 01:49:03,119
Get a move on!

571
01:50:22,074 --> 01:50:24,575
I’ll save it for later.

572
01:51:49,495 --> 01:51:51,579
He says to smoke quickly.

573
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:54,415
They're coming for us.
He could get in trouble.

574
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:57,168
To each his own troubles.

575
01:52:11,517 --> 01:52:13,309
This is it.

576
01:53:47,946 --> 01:53:51,115
TRANSFINITE AND CONTINUUM

577
01:53:53,202 --> 01:53:57,622
<i>Love has meaning for me
only as it applies to the chief.</i>

578
01:53:58,624 --> 01:54:00,833
<i>He means more to me
than anything.</i>

579
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:03,294
<i>More than anything
but less than life.</i>

580
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:07,840
<i>If Luc Jardie died,
I’d still want to live,</i>

581
01:54:08,008 --> 01:54:10,343
<i>but I’m going to die,</i>

582
01:54:10,511 --> 01:54:12,053
<i>and I’m not afraid.</i>

583
01:54:12,763 --> 01:54:15,723
<i>It’s impossible
not to be afraid of dying.</i>

584
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:19,644
<i>But I’m too stubborn,
too much of an animal to believe it.</i>

585
01:54:20,646 --> 01:54:24,524
<i>If I don't believe it to the very
last moment, the last split second,</i>

586
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:26,651
<i>I’ll never die.</i>

587
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:31,405
<i>What a revelation!
The chief would love it.</i>

588
01:54:32,407 --> 01:54:35,826
<i>I’ve got to look into this
more deeply -</i>

589
01:56:29,274 --> 01:56:31,233
You will turn your backs

590
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:34,779
to the machine guns
and face the far wall.

591
01:56:35,113 --> 01:56:37,323
You will run
as fast as you can.

592
01:56:37,491 --> 01:56:41,035
We will not open fire at once.
We will give you a chance.

593
01:56:41,244 --> 01:56:44,413
Whoever reaches the far wall
Will be shot later

594
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:46,957
With the next group
of condemned men.

595
01:56:47,793 --> 01:56:50,628
We can always try.
There's nothing to lose.

596
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:54,006
<i>He knows what my legs want.</i>

597
01:56:54,174 --> 01:56:56,801
<i>He's ready for the show.</i>

598
01:56:57,094 --> 01:56:59,929
<i>His confidence shackles me
more than my irons.</i>

599
01:57:06,478 --> 01:57:07,478
Go!

600
01:57:11,316 --> 01:57:12,566
<i>I won't run.</i>

601
01:57:14,277 --> 01:57:15,945
<i>I won't!</i>

602
01:59:20,237 --> 01:59:22,530
It had to be timed perfectly.

603
01:59:22,697 --> 01:59:24,114
Thank Mathilde for that.

604
01:59:26,368 --> 01:59:28,702
We were well informed.

605
01:59:32,457 --> 01:59:35,251
And what if I hadn't run?

606
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,379
Something wrong?

607
01:59:39,965 --> 01:59:41,632
Thinking about the others?

608
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:46,929
No, about the officer
who was so sure I’d run too,

609
01:59:47,097 --> 01:59:48,722
like a scared rabbit.

610
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:14,850
Step on it!

611
02:03:00,999 --> 02:03:03,208
Isn’t safety great?

612
02:03:19,601 --> 02:03:21,518
You have enough for a month.

613
02:03:21,686 --> 02:03:24,104
The water's okay,
but I’ll bring some wine.

614
02:03:24,272 --> 02:03:27,191
No, don't come back
for a month.

615
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:38,994
I’d better run.
The car mustn't be seen here.

616
02:03:39,162 --> 02:03:40,704
Then run along.

617
02:03:46,294 --> 02:03:48,587
See to your arm and thigh.

618
02:03:49,005 --> 02:03:52,132
Don't let them get infected.
- All right, Guillaume.

619
02:03:52,842 --> 02:03:55,552
You'll find a razor on the table.

620
02:04:53,278 --> 02:04:55,737
<i>For three weeks
I’ve been holed up alone</i>

621
02:04:55,905 --> 02:04:57,865
<i>like a frightened animal.</i>

622
02:04:58,491 --> 02:05:01,118
<i>I wrote a long report for London.</i>

623
02:05:01,494 --> 02:05:05,038
<i>I kid myself
that I’m still of some use.</i>

624
02:06:23,534 --> 02:06:26,203
<i>I haven't seen Mathilde
or anyone else.</i>

625
02:06:35,004 --> 02:06:39,132
ESSAY ON THE PROBLEM OF THE
FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS

626
02:06:43,137 --> 02:06:46,223
NOTES ON THE DEVELOPMENT
OF ABSTRACT SET THEORY

627
02:06:50,812 --> 02:06:54,982
ON LOGIC
AND THE THEORY OF SCIENCE

628
02:06:59,946 --> 02:07:02,364
AXIOMATIC METHOD
AND FORMALISM

629
02:07:02,907 --> 02:07:05,075
<i>My only link
to the outside world</i>

630
02:07:05,243 --> 02:07:08,495
<i>are the five books
Luc Jardie wrote before the war.</i>

631
02:07:08,663 --> 02:07:10,330
<i>They keep me company.</i>

632
02:07:34,605 --> 02:07:38,859
<i>At night, I’m haunted
by Jean-François' disappearance.</i>

633
02:08:45,510 --> 02:08:48,011
<i>Le Bison? Or Le Masque?</i>

634
02:08:55,395 --> 02:08:57,020
Is that you?

635
02:08:58,481 --> 02:08:59,940
It’s you?

636
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:14,204
We have to talk.

637
02:09:14,372 --> 02:09:17,249
- When did you get back?
- Four days ago.

638
02:09:18,334 --> 02:09:20,460
After Mathilde's arrest.

639
02:09:28,886 --> 02:09:31,221
We have to talk about her.

640
02:09:34,725 --> 02:09:36,601
We have to, Philippe.

641
02:09:39,897 --> 02:09:42,107
Mathilde was arrested
on the 27th.

642
02:09:42,567 --> 02:09:44,317
She wasn't hurt.

643
02:09:45,069 --> 02:09:47,529
She found a way to let us know.

644
02:09:48,573 --> 02:09:51,867
The Gestapo discovered
her real identity

645
02:09:52,743 --> 02:09:54,661
and her family's address.

646
02:09:55,121 --> 02:09:58,331
She was carrying
her daughter's photo on her.

647
02:10:00,168 --> 02:10:01,751
You can guess the rest.

648
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,087
The photo?

649
02:10:04,839 --> 02:10:07,299
Mathilde's only slipup.

650
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:11,761
The Germans sensed it was
that remarkable woman's weak point.

651
02:10:13,931 --> 02:10:15,557
The photo...

652
02:10:15,725 --> 02:10:19,227
How could she have kept it?
I warned her.

653
02:10:19,395 --> 02:10:21,021
It’s extraordinary, Philippe.

654
02:10:21,230 --> 02:10:24,065
She begged them
to give her back the photo.

655
02:10:25,401 --> 02:10:26,568
What?

656
02:10:26,736 --> 02:10:30,280
Mathilde sent us an SOS.
They've given her a choice:

657
02:10:30,781 --> 02:10:33,992
Either she names all the agents
she knows in our network

658
02:10:34,202 --> 02:10:37,454
or her daughter
is sent to a Polish whorehouse

659
02:10:37,622 --> 02:10:39,956
for soldiers
from the Eastern Front.

660
02:10:42,210 --> 02:10:44,586
Those are the givens
of the problem.

661
02:10:45,630 --> 02:10:47,464
We must find a solution.

662
02:10:49,008 --> 02:10:50,467
She can escape.

663
02:10:50,635 --> 02:10:53,094
She can neither escape
nor kill herself.

664
02:10:53,262 --> 02:10:57,265
The Gestapo is confident.
The daughter will answer for everything.

665
02:10:58,684 --> 02:11:00,477
She can play for time.

666
02:11:00,645 --> 02:11:02,437
How much time?

667
02:11:03,689 --> 02:11:06,191
That doesn't solve the problem.

668
02:11:06,359 --> 02:11:07,776
Here’s Le Bison.

669
02:11:08,694 --> 02:11:11,613
Don't tell him I’m here.

670
02:11:12,156 --> 02:11:13,907
Go into the back room.

671
02:11:55,783 --> 02:11:58,743
I got you a new pair of glasses.
The same as before.

672
02:12:15,261 --> 02:12:17,053
Any news from Mathilde?

673
02:12:20,099 --> 02:12:22,225
Well?
- I don't know anything.

674
02:12:22,727 --> 02:12:24,060
What?

675
02:12:24,604 --> 02:12:26,271
I don't know anything.

676
02:12:26,606 --> 02:12:28,398
It’s all in the letter.

677
02:13:09,649 --> 02:13:11,900
She was released
yesterday morning.

678
02:13:12,485 --> 02:13:15,111
Gerbonel and Arno
were arrested last night.

679
02:13:15,279 --> 02:13:16,780
Is that right?

680
02:13:18,157 --> 02:13:20,158
If that's what it says.

681
02:13:29,335 --> 02:13:30,877
Le Masque...

682
02:13:31,462 --> 02:13:33,129
you knew about this?

683
02:13:34,048 --> 02:13:36,257
I’m not in charge of reports.

684
02:13:39,637 --> 02:13:42,889
Mathilde is to be eliminated at once,
by any means.

685
02:13:44,141 --> 02:13:45,558
You can't be serious!

686
02:13:49,313 --> 02:13:52,273
I won't lay a finger
on Madame Mathilde.

687
02:13:52,775 --> 02:13:56,277
I worked with her.
She saved my skin.

688
02:13:56,445 --> 02:14:00,031
I watched her at Gestapo HQ.
She's a great woman!

689
02:14:00,825 --> 02:14:03,326
If it was a man,
whenever you say.

690
02:14:03,744 --> 02:14:05,662
As many as you want.

691
02:14:06,122 --> 02:14:08,039
But not Madame Mathilde!

692
02:14:08,207 --> 02:14:11,251
Over my dead body. Never!

693
02:14:11,419 --> 02:14:13,461
No arguments, Guillaume.

694
02:14:13,838 --> 02:14:15,547
She has to die and she will.

695
02:14:15,715 --> 02:14:17,132
You can't do that.

696
02:14:17,508 --> 02:14:19,551
We have other killers.

697
02:14:19,719 --> 02:14:21,177
If need be, I’ll do it.

698
02:14:22,012 --> 02:14:23,680
You wouldn't dare!

699
02:14:24,181 --> 02:14:26,015
You have no right!

700
02:14:26,183 --> 02:14:28,893
In the shooting range,
you could've run like mad,

701
02:14:29,061 --> 02:14:33,273
but she saved your life
with those smoke grenades.

702
02:14:38,571 --> 02:14:40,363
You mustn't do it.

703
02:14:40,990 --> 02:14:43,283
Let her sell us all out
if she wants.

704
02:14:43,451 --> 02:14:45,702
She protected me.
She protected you.

705
02:14:45,870 --> 02:14:48,413
Now it's her daughter.
We can't judge her.

706
02:14:48,581 --> 02:14:51,875
That'll do!
The matter is settled.

707
02:14:58,090 --> 02:15:00,550
If you're coward enough to do it,

708
02:15:00,718 --> 02:15:02,635
I’ll get you first.

709
02:15:20,237 --> 02:15:21,362
Stop!

710
02:15:21,530 --> 02:15:25,658
Get off me! You were still a kid
when I was in the Foreign Legion!

711
02:15:25,826 --> 02:15:29,913
Think I’ll stand by
and let you do this?

712
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:31,498
Are you crazy?

713
02:15:31,665 --> 02:15:34,042
Back off
before I kill you both!

714
02:15:47,848 --> 02:15:51,935
What we need here is a man
who knows nothing about weapons.

715
02:15:56,941 --> 02:15:58,733
Sit down, my friend.

716
02:16:01,362 --> 02:16:03,780
Have a cigarette.
It'll do you good.

717
02:16:05,282 --> 02:16:06,783
Right, Gerbier?

718
02:16:07,827 --> 02:16:09,619
You heard it all?

719
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:11,955
You're right.

720
02:16:12,122 --> 02:16:14,749
Mathilde is a marvellous woman,

721
02:16:15,167 --> 02:16:17,335
more than you know.

722
02:16:18,128 --> 02:16:20,588
But we're going to kill her.
- You can't.

723
02:16:20,756 --> 02:16:22,966
We can, and here's why.

724
02:16:23,259 --> 02:16:26,302
We're going to kill her
because she's begging us to.

725
02:16:28,138 --> 02:16:29,472
She told you that?

726
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:30,932
No, but it's obvious.

727
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:32,934
Think for a moment.

728
02:16:33,102 --> 02:16:35,770
If she just wanted
to save her daughter,

729
02:16:35,938 --> 02:16:39,732
she'd only have to supply some names.
You know her memory.

730
02:16:40,442 --> 02:16:44,821
Instead, she tells them
our agents keep moving around,

731
02:16:44,989 --> 02:16:47,407
that she needs
to re-establish contacts.

732
02:16:47,575 --> 02:16:51,452
So she gets herself released.
Isn’t that clear enough?

733
02:16:52,705 --> 02:16:55,623
Now put yourself in her place,

734
02:16:56,333 --> 02:16:58,668
forced to hand over your friends,

735
02:16:59,169 --> 02:17:01,254
and unable to commit suicide.

736
02:17:06,427 --> 02:17:08,511
I’d want to be killed.

737
02:17:09,972 --> 02:17:14,183
You think you're any braver
or better than Mathilde?

738
02:17:19,899 --> 02:17:22,775
- I’m sorry.
- Find a German car.

739
02:17:23,152 --> 02:17:26,779
Le Masque will drive.
I’ll be in back with you.

740
02:17:26,947 --> 02:17:28,531
Are you crazy?

741
02:17:28,699 --> 02:17:31,326
I’m sure she'll want
to see me.

742
02:17:31,493 --> 02:17:34,078
Don't! It’s no place for you.

743
02:17:35,581 --> 02:17:37,290
It’s an order.

744
02:17:38,417 --> 02:17:40,543
That wasn't necessary, chief.

745
02:18:04,693 --> 02:18:08,112
You sure of what you claim
about Mathilde?

746
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:09,572
How should I know?

747
02:18:13,369 --> 02:18:15,912
My theory might be correct.

748
02:18:16,830 --> 02:18:21,918
Or she wanted to see her daughter again,
making it harder for her to die.

749
02:18:23,295 --> 02:18:25,588
That's what I want to find out.

750
02:18:27,508 --> 02:18:30,718
I have to be with you
for the hardest part.

751
02:18:31,845 --> 02:18:34,097
You in a car full of killers!

752
02:18:35,307 --> 02:18:37,850
Nothing's sacred anymore.

753
02:18:45,067 --> 02:18:49,445
SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1943

754
02:19:39,121 --> 02:19:40,538
Go!

755
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:54,802
Claude Ullmann, alias Le Masque,
had just enough time

756
02:19:54,970 --> 02:19:59,432
to swallow his cyanide capsule
on November 8, 1943.

757
02:20:04,188 --> 02:20:06,731
Guillaume Vermersch,
alias Le Bison,

758
02:20:06,899 --> 02:20:11,277
was decapitated by ax in a German
prison on December 16, 1943.

759
02:20:16,658 --> 02:20:20,286
Luc Jardie died under torture
on January 22, 1944,

760
02:20:20,454 --> 02:20:23,873
after revealing one name:
his own.

761
02:20:29,004 --> 02:20:32,381
And on February 13, 1944,
Philippe Gerbier decided

762
02:20:32,549 --> 02:20:35,551
this time he wouldn't run.
