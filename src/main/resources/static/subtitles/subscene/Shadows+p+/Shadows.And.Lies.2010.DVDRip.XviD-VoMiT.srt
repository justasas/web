1
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:34,435
Dear Ann,
l've come back to New York,

2
00:04:34,435 --> 00:04:37,768
Some years ago you
asked me about myself,

3
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:39,734
''What are you doing,''
you asked

4
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:43,702
l didn't answer then
but l want to now,

5
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:47,069
When you've read this letter,
if you wanna come away with me

6
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,834
if you want me to take you
from here, tell Victor

7
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:53,636
you can trust him,
He'll find me,

8
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,768
I'll start somewhere
near the beginning,

9
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,569
William is not my name.

10
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,700
A few years before l met you

11
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,735
l was returning from a place
l'd always wanted to visit,

12
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:15,070
Japan, l was transferring in
San francisco to a flight home,

13
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,735
Once l was back on the plane l asked
if l could go back to the boarding area

14
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,700
because I had left
a book there.

15
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,736
By the time l found my book,
the gate had closed

16
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:29,570
so l sat and read my book until
the plane took off without me,

17
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,668
l decided to take the long bus
ride across the country to my home

18
00:05:32,668 --> 00:05:35,902
in Connecticut,
just outside of New York,

19
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:38,535
Several hours into the trip

20
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:44,404
l heard on the radio that the plane
l missed had crashed into a mountain,

21
00:05:44,404 --> 00:05:49,237
l closed my eyes and slept,

22
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:54,237
The next day l learned that they had
not been able to recover any bodies,

23
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:59,237
The plane and all the passengers
had been incinerated on impact,

24
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:10,337
l got off the bus in New York
and decided to stay for a while,

25
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:18,534
l realized that
for all anyone knew

26
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:21,768
l no longer existed,

27
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,034
for no particular reason

28
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:32,767
without really
thinking about it

29
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,167
l bought a passport

30
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:37,168
under the name
of William Vincent,

31
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,168
I took a class
and learned a trade

32
00:06:46,168 --> 00:06:50,135
and got a job editing nature
videos for use in the schools.

33
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,269
I think that's what they're
used for, I'm not really sure.

34
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:58,767
l managed to find
an empty storefront to live in

35
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:02,503
in a neighborhood
in Chinatown not far from the East River.

36
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,234
Okay,

37
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,933
Yes.

38
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,035
from ''They can hover
in midair,''

39
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:55,599
They can hover in midair

40
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,267
by rapidly flapping
their wings

41
00:07:57,267 --> 00:08:00,201
1 2 to 9O times per second,

42
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:03,067
They can fly backwards
and are the only group of birds

43
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,401
able to do so,

44
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:09,068
They can also stop in midair.

45
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:13,936
Hummingbirds are continuously
hours away from starving to death

46
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:16,202
and are able to store
just enough energy

47
00:08:16,202 --> 00:08:19,701
to survive overnight,

48
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:23,669
Hummingbirds are capable of slowing
down their metabolism at night

49
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:29,071
or any other time food
is not readily available,

50
00:08:29,071 --> 00:08:31,200
They enter
a hibernation-like state

51
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,600
known as torpor,

52
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,169
During torpor, the heart rate
and rate of breathing

53
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,767
are both slowed dramatically

54
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:44,671
the heart rate to roughly
5O to 18O beats per minute

55
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:47,135
reducing the need for food,

56
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:52,101
The most astonishing
quality of hummingbirds

57
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,901
is their ability
to broadcast color.

58
00:08:54,901 --> 00:09:00,171
Hummin9birds radiate
like hot coals in the sun,

59
00:09:00,171 --> 00:09:03,602
The color that reaches your eye
is created by pigment

60
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:07,403
which absorbs some
colors and rejects others,

61
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:09,668
Like soap bubbles

62
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:13,870
hummingbird's color
comes from iridescence, not pigment,

63
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,535
lt winks on and off

64
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:20,869
depending on the light source
and the angle of the viewer,

65
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:20,569
That's a nice dress.

66
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:25,335
Where'd you get it?

67
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,134
lt's a kimono.

68
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:33,335
l know it's a kimono.

69
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,534
l like it.

70
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:42,900
Change.

71
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,836
You know you don't
wanna fuck with me, ri9ht?

72
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:30,001
Of course l do.

73
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:35,067
Of course you do.

74
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:03,201
So he says, ''Hey,
you're right, but

75
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:04,933
''can we actually
do that, like

76
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:08,169
''who's in charge of this pro]ect,
you know

77
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,068
''and l'm like, listen

78
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:14,268
''if some noise needs to be
made, l will make the noise.

79
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:15,766
Okay? All right?''

80
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:19,002
And he says,
''Whoa, Jason, whoa.''

81
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:21,600
l'm like, whoa
what, Ted?

82
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,035
The problem with Ted is,
he doesn't get it.

83
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:27,235
He's like, pretty much like,
l can name off

84
00:14:27,235 --> 00:14:29,734
three or four executives
in this company alone

85
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,935
who in a few months are gonna be
redoing their resume

86
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:36,703
and who do you think they're gonna
ask to take one of those offices?

87
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:42,738
But, l think that comes from ]'ve done a
]ot of meditation over the years, l have to,

88
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:46,035
You would think that in, like,
the cutthroat business that l'm in

89
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:48,434
when you're dealing with
derivatives it's all crazy.

90
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:50,334
lt's very chaotic,

91
00:14:50,334 --> 00:14:53,535
But, you need to find
a time for peace,

92
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:56,034
When you're workin9
a ]ob ]ike that.

93
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:59,902
Because if you don't, you're
going to be chaotic yourself,

94
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:02,668
_'__ take it
one step further,

95
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:06,236
lf you really wanna know about financial
markets, Iet's talk about Per Bak

96
00:15:06,236 --> 00:15:07,500
Right?
[scoffs]

97
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,067
Right.

98
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:12,368
Let's talk about,
Iet's talk about, uh

99
00:15:12,368 --> 00:15:15,201
Kolmogorov.
[chuckles]

100
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:18,501
lf you wanna hear really
the theory of turbulence

101
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,869
order of chaos,
phase transition.

102
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:25,503
And that's where these guys
should be living right now

103
00:15:25,503 --> 00:15:27,267
if they want
to survive.

104
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:30,935
But they don't, they
can't possibly grasp that.

105
00:15:30,935 --> 00:15:35,537
Economic crisis, my ass. This
is an economic opportunity.

106
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:37,934
You should
-- You know what? You should check out a book

107
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:41,370
um, oh, what is
the name of that?

108
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,500
lt's, uh, Per Bak,
How Nature Wor--

109
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,668
-  I'll think of it.
-  Okay,

110
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:46,967
- You know,I'll be right back.
- Okay,

111
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,600
- And I'll think of it.
- Great,

112
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,000
l'll definitely remember it
before l get back, okay?

113
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,299
l can't wait,

114
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:57,249
Hi.

115
00:15:59,599 --> 00:16:01,534
Do l know you?

116
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:03,600
Uh, no.

117
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,535
Sorry if my, uh,
staring bothered you.

118
00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:10,436
lt's, uh, it's okay.
l don't mind.

119
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:17,701
l don't like
your friend.

120
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:20,535
Oh, you mean Jason?

121
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:22,434
Yeah. Do you
like him?

122
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:26,434
l don't know.

123
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:28,167
Why?

124
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:33,068
]ust asking.

125
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,768
Do you know him?

126
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:37,488
Hm-mm.

127
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,368
l'm Rebbecca.

128
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:46,118
Hi.

129
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:50,133
What's your name?

130
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,569
The scotch is--

131
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,800
You're very beautiful.

132
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,866
Wow.

133
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,868
Joseph?

134
00:17:47,868 --> 00:17:49,668
Sorry.

135
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:58,435
l enjoyed tormenting
the man in the bar

136
00:17:58,435 --> 00:18:01,869
and l think it was nice that l
might have made the woman happy,

137
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:06,270
Even for a moment. Even
if I didn't care about her.

138
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:22,933
There hadn't been many
that l had cared about,

139
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:25,702
Only two brothers
that l'd known

140
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:29,402
when l was a teenager back in the town
where I grew up.

141
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:39,435
l'd lost touch with the two
brothers, but l thought of them often

142
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:44,503
and saw them, in a way, in parks,
on the street, different places,

143
00:18:44,503 --> 00:18:47,402
And l saw them
as l'd known them

144
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:53,672
as young boys, not as the
adults they would be now,

145
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:58,304
lt was a lovely thing to imagine, but
I knew it was just that, Imagined,

146
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:03,868
But l saw them as if
they were really there,

147
00:19:03,868 --> 00:19:08,037
l wondered how they were,
where they were,

148
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:12,336
Anyway, wherever they are, it's
probably best that they don't know me

149
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:14,834
given the man l've become,

150
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,734
l knew them
when l was this age

151
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:32,903
the age l am now
in this shot, 16.

152
00:19:32,903 --> 00:19:38,338
l'm 30 now, so the things l
remember are from a long time ago.

153
00:19:38,338 --> 00:19:42,703
His name was Joseph
back then, not William.

154
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:47,170
He did some odd things,
but l think he was a nice person.

155
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,034
Maybe a little--

156
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:58,936
He could run very fast.

157
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,634
We used to race.

158
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,569
He was a beautiful runner.

159
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,335
Really beautiful runner.

160
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:31,436
I'd been lving as William Vincent
for three years before l met you,

161
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:35,903
ln that time, we might have passed
near to one another and not known it,

162
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:46,068
l wonder if either of us might
have felt something in the passing,

163
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:47,466
lf it happened,

164
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,936
for instance

165
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:06,935
l wonder if you were nearby
that night l saw

166
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:09,602
that man wearing
suspenders and a bow tie?

167
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,935
He's just kind of drifting down
the sidewalk Iooking at his phone,

168
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,167
What the fuck?

169
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:25,668
The man ]ust walked away

170
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:31,572
unaware that I had lifted
some things from his pocket,

171
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:35,602
Just a receipt and
a business card, Nothing,

172
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:45,734
But it seemed as if there was
something else in the air that night.

173
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,767
Something odd,

174
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:54,068
lt was an unusually
quiet, empty night.

175
00:21:54,068 --> 00:21:57,101
But l felt as if something
had happened,

176
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,768
There was something wrong
that night but I didn't mind.

177
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:08,168
l might have
even liked it,

178
00:22:54,966 --> 00:22:57,935
l went out to eat

179
00:22:57,935 --> 00:23:02,671
still with the sense that there was
somewhere wrong in this city, somewhere,

180
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:39,416
Hi.

181
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,401
Hey.

182
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:58,168
What time is it?

183
00:23:58,168 --> 00:24:00,267
lt's late.

184
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,668
What's the occasion?

185
00:24:06,668 --> 00:24:09,802
Do l need an occasion?

186
00:24:14,666 --> 00:24:17,168
You are an occasion.

187
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:19,683
This place sucks.

188
00:24:23,432 --> 00:24:26,268
Watching what's going on,

189
00:24:40,332 --> 00:24:43,001
You don't have to flatter
me, you know,

190
00:24:58,165 --> 00:25:00,100
ls that
a good tip?

191
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,533
Excuse me?

192
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,767
ls that
a decent tip?

193
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:05,901
Yeah, it is.

194
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:08,168
He's just trying
to earn a living.

195
00:25:08,168 --> 00:25:10,567
You're a fucking asshole.

196
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:50,769
Open the iris all the way
and bring the condenser up,

197
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:53,769
The subject now appears
against a dark background

198
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:58,337
]ust like aspen leaves
against a dark sky,

199
00:26:01,566 --> 00:26:03,868
The color seen
in dark filled lighting

200
00:26:03,868 --> 00:26:06,168
can give new information,

201
00:27:09,566 --> 00:27:11,567
Dark filled lighting
is a good technique

202
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:15,635
for viewing the smallest
observable lifeforms.

203
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:20,534
And also helps us understand

204
00:27:20,534 --> 00:27:25,503
that William
never meant any harm,

205
00:27:25,503 --> 00:27:28,568
Nor did he mean any kindness,

206
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:31,501
He never meant anything,

207
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:09,036
We can take the risk if,
if we're able to--

208
00:30:09,036 --> 00:30:10,400
Ri9ht.

209
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,367
l don't know that
we're able to

210
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:15,101
and l don't know that we
need to wait for everything--

211
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,068
Excuse me.

212
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,235
Excuse me.I think you might
have taken something of mine?

213
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:40,700
l don't think so.

214
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,234
Give me
my phone.

215
00:30:42,234 --> 00:30:44,501
Like l said,
l don't think so.

216
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:47,168
l'm not fucking around.
Give me my phone.

217
00:30:47,168 --> 00:30:48,866
Okay?

218
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:50,834
Does your friend have
a problem?

219
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:57,035
I don't know how I can
make this any clearer

220
00:30:57,035 --> 00:31:00,502
l want you to give me
my phone, Right now!

221
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:02,367
This your phone?

222
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:04,267
What the fuck?

223
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:06,167
You little prick!

224
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,434
We'll, fuck you.

225
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:19,100
fuck you.

226
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,067
Go fuck yourself,
asshole.

227
00:31:34,265 --> 00:31:36,667
Find out who he is.

228
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:50,735
William is standing
outside a door.

229
00:31:53,966 --> 00:31:55,600
On the other side
of the door

230
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,336
a woman and a man
are having sex,

231
00:32:04,432 --> 00:32:08,736
In a park, a child runs.

232
00:32:08,736 --> 00:32:11,101
Another rides a bike.

233
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:13,734
A little girl reads.

234
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:18,170
A man walks under a tree.

235
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:23,637
No, A man walks past some
potted bushes on the street,

236
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:27,501
He enters a restaurant.

237
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:06,901
You remember me?

238
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:09,634
l'm Victor.

239
00:33:11,232 --> 00:33:13,000
Uh-huh.

240
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,500
So, uh, listen, um--

241
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:19,266
Um--

242
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,667
So, anyway

243
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,936
this man l know
is very impressed with you

244
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:30,570
he saw the little thing you did
on the street a couple of days ago

245
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,068
with the phone
and a wallet, and uh

246
00:33:34,068 --> 00:33:35,028
you know

247
00:33:37,065 --> 00:33:38,499
l was there.

248
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:40,166
Um

249
00:33:41,165 --> 00:33:43,667
uh, he would
like to meet you.

250
00:33:49,232 --> 00:33:49,732
So

251
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,501
anyway this man, uh

252
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:56,869
l don't wanna-
l don't wanna be coy

253
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,201
or anything, but
this man has, uh

254
00:33:59,201 --> 00:34:02,334
a lot of interests
that are

255
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:06,401
not aboveboard.

256
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,399
So--

257
00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:14,233
Can l get you
something, sir?

258
00:34:14,233 --> 00:34:17,935
No, thank you.

259
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:21,603
So like l said, he, he, he, he, he, he,
he would, he would like to meet you.

260
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:24,935
Uh-huh. And what
is not aboveboard?

261
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:27,669
Let's let him tell
you about that.

262
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,534
Okay.

263
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:38,934
And you, uh

264
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:42,770
and you're a part of this thing
that you're talking about?

265
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,167
Mm-hm.

266
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:47,200
So you're the muscle?

267
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,450
Yeah.

268
00:34:49,799 --> 00:34:52,268
Are you muscling me?

269
00:34:52,268 --> 00:34:54,701
You'd know
if l was.

270
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:57,768
Yeah, l guess
l would.

271
00:34:57,768 --> 00:35:00,669
So this man

272
00:35:00,669 --> 00:35:03,769
uh, l don't know
what this is about

273
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:07,403
who he thinks
you are, but

274
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:09,100
he thinks you can earn
him money.

275
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,699
Maybe you can,
maybe you can't

276
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:12,334
but he thinks you can

277
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:15,935
so he would
like to meet you.

278
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:17,735
Yeah?

279
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:18,985
Yeah.

280
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,900
lt's so weird.

281
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,500
Please?

282
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:27,100
What's in it for me?

283
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,100
That would be money.

284
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,501
You sound like
you're in a movie.

285
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,751
Yeah.

286
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,668
What if l say no?

287
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:42,334
Don't.

288
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:46,269
What if l do?

289
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:50,102
lt's my job to bring you to him.
Please don't make me do my job.

290
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:55,136
So if l say no, somebody's
gonna come and beat me up?

291
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:58,601
Hm. l don't know.

292
00:35:58,601 --> 00:35:59,867
No?

293
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:01,401
See?

294
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:07,649
So?

295
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,035
l don't know, l'm just
trying to figure out

296
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,401
if l'm in trouble
here or

297
00:36:13,401 --> 00:36:16,268
who you are,
or what-- You know.

298
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:20,302
Please, just come with
me. l'm saying please.

299
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:34,900
Okay.

300
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:41,902
Idon't know why
l went with him,

301
00:36:41,902 --> 00:36:46,103
He seemed like a nice man, and maybe
his boss was interesting, I don't know.

302
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:49,501
As we drove to meet him

303
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:52,769
l thought of a photograph
l'd taken in Japan,

304
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:55,902
ln particular, a shaded area
in the corner of a frame

305
00:36:55,902 --> 00:36:57,701
where l could barely
make out a woman,

306
00:37:00,132 --> 00:37:04,536
l hadn't known she was there
when l took the picture,

307
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:07,234
I wanted to talk
to the brothers,

308
00:37:11,265 --> 00:37:13,600
When we used
to come here

309
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,668
you guys would race
over there, by that pond.

310
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:20,100
Yeah, l remember.

311
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,267
You used to race, too.

312
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:23,933
You won.

313
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:27,501
Yeah, l was pretty
fast, wasn't l?

314
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:29,200
The fastest.

315
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,899
Remember?

316
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:33,268
l don't remember,
l was too young maybe.

317
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:37,601
You used to sit
over there.

318
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:41,369
No, l used, l used to
sit here with you guys.

319
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:43,500
Sometimes.

320
00:37:51,332 --> 00:37:53,767
lt's nice to see
you again.

321
00:37:57,065 --> 00:38:00,935
l told this woman
in a letter that

322
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:04,937
l thought it was better that
you guys don't know me now.

323
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:07,502
lt was better for you.

324
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,468
Why?

325
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,867
l'm not so nice now.

326
00:38:14,867 --> 00:38:17,568
l never thought
you were nice.

327
00:38:17,568 --> 00:38:20,634
You're nicer than
you think you are.

328
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,401
No, l'm not.

329
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:27,335
So how'd you
become a criminal?

330
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,001
l don't know.

331
00:39:06,265 --> 00:39:08,000
Wait here.

332
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,935
This is William.

333
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:11,599
Hello, William.

334
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,068
Hi. Who are you?

335
00:40:14,068 --> 00:40:16,100
A friend.

336
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:22,368
l liked you manner on
the street the other day.

337
00:40:22,368 --> 00:40:26,169
Yeah, thanks
for stepping in.

338
00:40:26,169 --> 00:40:29,702
What would have
happened if l hadn't?

339
00:40:29,702 --> 00:40:32,101
l don't know.

340
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:34,834
Were you afraid?

341
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:35,584
No.

342
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:40,002
You didn't seem afraid,

343
00:40:40,002 --> 00:40:42,667
l, l guess.

344
00:40:44,899 --> 00:40:47,134
You're a secretive
one, huh?

345
00:40:51,766 --> 00:40:53,501
Are you a tough guy?

346
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:54,400
No.

347
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,700
No.

348
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,234
But you are secretive,

349
00:40:57,234 --> 00:40:59,901
That's my
impression, anyway,

350
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:04,437
You know, l don't much
like people who aren't

351
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:06,834
who aren't like that.

352
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,767
Victor, would you
give us a minute?

353
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,100
Sure.

354
00:41:21,766 --> 00:41:23,701
Actually,

355
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:25,834
give Ann a call,
would you?

356
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:44,599
ls she there?

357
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,435
Hang on a second,

358
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:53,667
Yeah, she's ready anytime,

359
00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:04,268
Well, thank you for coming,

360
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:07,401
l wanted to meet you,

361
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:11,002
You're a film
editor, right?

362
00:42:11,002 --> 00:42:12,599
Uh, yeah.

363
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,602
Why don't you
have any friends?

364
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:17,434
l do.

365
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,833
No, you don't.

366
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:20,083
Okay.

367
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:24,702
You know, there is someone
l'd like you to meet,

368
00:42:24,702 --> 00:42:27,435
Victor will
take you to her.

369
00:42:27,435 --> 00:42:30,902
She's a gift.

370
00:42:30,902 --> 00:42:33,935
You're giving
me a woman?

371
00:42:33,935 --> 00:42:34,685
No.

372
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:39,768
How could
l do that?

373
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:41,234
l don't know.

374
00:42:41,234 --> 00:42:44,535
No, just
a friend

375
00:42:44,535 --> 00:42:48,436
someone l'd like you to
meet, if you're willing.

376
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:53,804
A simple sign of respect which l'd
like to think that you'd reciprocate.

377
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:58,368
Uh, okay, great.

378
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:00,167
Great.

379
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:02,000
Victor.

380
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:20,869
No, uh, l don't,
l don't think so.

381
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:23,035
Not really my thing.

382
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:25,367
You'd be doing
me a favor.

383
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:27,934
Maybe some other time.

384
00:44:06,933 --> 00:44:08,334
H i.

385
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:13,501
l'm Ann. Victor
told me to come here.

386
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:17,469
Oh, you mean,
Victor's boss.

387
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:21,500
Somebody.

388
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,304
It'd really be better for me
if you let me in.

389
00:44:37,265 --> 00:44:38,933
Would you like
to take a seat?

390
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:41,068
Mm. Thanks.

391
00:44:47,132 --> 00:44:50,602
So you're what
he gives away?

392
00:44:51,899 --> 00:44:54,568
l wouldn't say that.

393
00:44:54,568 --> 00:44:57,034
l'm sorry.
That was really rude,

394
00:44:57,034 --> 00:44:59,000
l'm sorry.

395
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,168
Don't be. l can see how you
might think of it that way.

396
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,568
Anyway--

397
00:45:15,232 --> 00:45:17,000
So who are you?

398
00:45:28,466 --> 00:45:30,100
Um--

399
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,935
l can't really
offer you anything.

400
00:45:33,935 --> 00:45:37,770
Um, do you
want some water?

401
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:42,967
Okay.

402
00:45:45,899 --> 00:45:46,966
Okay.

403
00:45:57,165 --> 00:45:58,232
Here.

404
00:46:17,265 --> 00:46:19,433
Would you like some?

405
00:46:31,065 --> 00:46:33,901
l got lipstick
on the glass.

406
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,301
Anyway.

407
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:02,834
Here.

408
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:16,233
That's so pretty,

409
00:47:18,232 --> 00:47:19,833
You think?

410
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:22,332
Yes.

411
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:30,002
You sure you
don't want any?

412
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:52,268
So this is home and
work, Victor said?

413
00:47:52,268 --> 00:47:54,067
Yeah.

414
00:47:56,299 --> 00:47:57,139
Movies?

415
00:47:59,499 --> 00:48:01,167
Yeah, sort of.

416
00:48:04,666 --> 00:48:06,267
Can l see?

417
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:06,987
Mm-hm.

418
00:48:09,065 --> 00:48:11,066
Come on.

419
00:48:31,099 --> 00:48:33,234
A 19th-century naturalist

420
00:48:33,234 --> 00:48:37,236
called them little more
than organized water,

421
00:48:37,236 --> 00:48:41,770
They were in our oceans
65O,OOO,OOO years ago

422
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:46,270
before sharks and dinosaurs.

423
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:48,867
They do not have
a central nervous system

424
00:48:48,867 --> 00:48:51,035
a circulatory system

425
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:52,767
a respiratory system

426
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:56,002
or an osmoregulatory system,

427
00:48:56,002 --> 00:48:58,867
So it's understandable
that Louis Agassiz

428
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:01,502
the great 1 9th-century
naturalist--

429
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:10,302
I should probab]y
get back to work,

430
00:51:15,499 --> 00:51:17,000
Do you want me to leave?

431
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,250
Okay.

432
00:51:27,632 --> 00:51:29,300
So, um

433
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:33,268
what is it
that you do?

434
00:51:33,268 --> 00:51:36,168
Oh, things.

435
00:51:40,566 --> 00:51:41,833
How's that?

436
00:51:45,733 --> 00:51:48,435
lt's what l do.
So it's that.

437
00:51:52,332 --> 00:51:53,966
Sounds okay.

438
00:51:54,966 --> 00:51:56,167
ls it?

439
00:51:57,499 --> 00:52:00,034
Why wouldn't it be?

440
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:02,501
l don't know.

441
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:15,933
l'm Ann.

442
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:19,667
William.

443
00:53:31,332 --> 00:53:34,168
What can l do
for you, Victor?

444
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:45,802
There's a couple of things my
boss would, uh, like you to do.

445
00:53:52,933 --> 00:53:54,234
l'll be your contact,

446
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:57,068
lt's really very
simple, you just

447
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,466
go to this address

448
00:53:59,733 --> 00:54:02,168
deliver this

449
00:54:02,168 --> 00:54:05,602
pick up a couple of envelopes
from the women there

450
00:54:05,602 --> 00:54:08,502
and uh, l'll get
the envelopes from you,

451
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:17,602
Yeah, we__, uh

452
00:54:17,602 --> 00:54:21,202
here's the thing, you,
uh, you get a lump sum

453
00:54:21,202 --> 00:54:23,734
every week,
that look okay?

454
00:54:26,165 --> 00:54:28,667
lt'd be okay if l
needed the money.

455
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,834
Then give it back.

456
00:54:34,499 --> 00:54:36,500
There's a lot in here,
isn't there?

457
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,334
l think so,

458
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:40,267
All right.

459
00:54:40,267 --> 00:54:43,168
Maybe l can find
a use for it.

460
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,400
So, Ann

461
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,334
what's the deal there?

462
00:54:49,334 --> 00:54:51,000
She's a beautiful woman,

463
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,599
Yeah, so
what's the deal?

464
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:54,667
Pretty much
as you see it,

465
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:58,103
Care to elaborate?

466
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:03,400
You seem like
a nice boy.

467
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:09,505
This is not
a really nice group.

468
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:13,069
And, uh, you're
included in this group?

469
00:55:13,069 --> 00:55:15,067
Yeah, me, too.

470
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:16,500
And Ann.

471
00:55:21,332 --> 00:55:22,052
So, uh

472
00:55:25,966 --> 00:55:27,334
anyway, uh

473
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:32,416
Ann

474
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:36,034
uh, she's, uh

475
00:55:36,034 --> 00:55:36,534
uh

476
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,503
she's my boss's--

477
00:55:45,165 --> 00:55:47,534
She owes him.
l suppose we all do.

478
00:55:47,534 --> 00:55:51,069
Anyway, she's, uh

479
00:55:51,069 --> 00:55:52,766
she's there for him when
he need, when he needs her

480
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,901
not so much for
himself anymore

481
00:55:54,901 --> 00:55:57,535
but, you know, for others,
like yourself, as a favor,

482
00:55:57,535 --> 00:55:58,733
Mm-hm.

483
00:55:58,733 --> 00:56:00,834
So, uh, anyway, uh

484
00:56:01,966 --> 00:56:03,500
she was asking

485
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,580
about you

486
00:56:07,065 --> 00:56:07,915
uh, asking me, uh

487
00:56:11,632 --> 00:56:14,067
she knows she's not
supposed to ask about you

488
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:16,167
that's none of my
business why she did.

489
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:19,868
But you need to know that
this is very dangerous for her.

490
00:56:19,868 --> 00:56:23,036
And for you,

491
00:56:23,036 --> 00:56:25,868
You're talking like
you're in a movie, Victor.

492
00:56:25,868 --> 00:56:28,302
Like a gangster movie.

493
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,802
I'm not a violent
person, Are you?

494
00:56:39,432 --> 00:56:41,433
l'm not a gangster.

495
00:56:41,433 --> 00:56:43,300
You're not?

496
00:56:45,132 --> 00:56:46,733
l don't think so.

497
00:56:50,566 --> 00:56:52,768
No, I don't
think so either,

498
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,936
There anything l can
do for you, Victor?

499
00:57:05,933 --> 00:57:06,683
No.

500
00:57:09,065 --> 00:57:11,434
No, thanks.

501
00:57:11,434 --> 00:57:13,734
Uh, yes, you can

502
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:16,268
keep your distance from Ann.

503
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:19,100
l'd rather not,

504
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,134
Please, William. For Ann.

505
00:57:25,632 --> 00:57:27,934
When you need me
to do something

506
00:57:27,934 --> 00:57:30,435
uh, you'll ask.

507
00:57:30,435 --> 00:57:33,535
I assume that's
how this works,

508
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:37,002
And then, l'll either
say yes or no.

509
00:57:37,002 --> 00:57:40,234
Uh, and the piece
you took?

510
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:43,834
The silver?

511
00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:58,402
He, uh, he forgives
this because

512
00:57:58,402 --> 00:58:02,002
you didn't know who he
is, but now you do, right?

513
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:04,767
l guess.

514
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:33,834
William?

515
00:58:33,834 --> 00:58:35,200
Yeah.

516
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,733
H i.

517
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:38,267
H i.

518
00:58:50,566 --> 00:58:52,401
Excuse me.

519
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,768
Can l get you
something to drink?

520
00:59:01,768 --> 00:59:03,668
No, thanks.

521
00:59:05,466 --> 00:59:07,267
You wanna sit down?

522
00:59:27,933 --> 00:59:31,436
Juliette's got one
of these, too.

523
00:59:31,436 --> 00:59:32,933
Okay.

524
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:37,101
l'll go see if l
can get her up.

525
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:43,933
Juliette?

526
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:01,901
Juliette's a little
out of it

527
01:00:03,065 --> 01:00:03,899
right now.

528
01:00:03,899 --> 01:00:04,619
Mm-hm.

529
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,402
Do you have
something for me?

530
01:00:09,466 --> 01:00:10,800
Yeah.

531
01:00:12,165 --> 01:00:12,915
Oh.

532
01:00:13,933 --> 01:00:15,734
Thanks.

533
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,734
lt's heavy.

534
01:00:24,899 --> 01:00:25,699
Oh.
Good morning.

535
01:00:31,466 --> 01:00:33,000
You want some?

536
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,750
No.

537
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:37,900
Does she have
that envelope?

538
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,502
I don't know.
Why don't you ask her?

539
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:45,834
Juliette!

540
01:00:53,632 --> 01:00:54,382

Nice to meet you.

542
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,935

544
01:01:04,201 --> 01:01:05,432
What's that?

545
01:01:05,432 --> 01:01:06,366
William.

546
01:01:06,366 --> 01:01:07,266
William?

547
01:01:07,266 --> 01:01:08,366
Yeah.

548
01:01:08,366 --> 01:01:09,166
Hi.

549
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,299
Hi.

550
01:01:12,332 --> 01:01:14,000
l'm sorry?

551
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,367
Do you want some?

552
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:21,933
No, he doesn't.

553
01:01:21,933 --> 01:01:22,934
Did you already
ask him?

554
01:01:22,934 --> 01:01:24,201
Mm-hm.

555
01:01:24,201 --> 01:01:27,001
He really doesn't.

556
01:01:27,001 --> 01:01:29,434
Do you have
an envelope for me?

557
01:01:29,434 --> 01:01:30,684
Yeah.

558
01:01:32,766 --> 01:01:35,568
Do you wanna

559
01:01:35,568 --> 01:01:38,001
hang out with us
for a little bit?

560
01:01:38,001 --> 01:01:39,433
William.

561
01:01:39,433 --> 01:01:41,701
Come sit down,

562
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:44,833
Jesus Christ,

563
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,967
fucking 5 o'clock, Ann,

564
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,033
Thank you.

565
01:02:11,033 --> 01:02:13,267
Put some clothes on,

566
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:14,666
Whatever.

567
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,935
We have a guest
in the house,

568
01:02:19,332 --> 01:02:21,667
So, we'll see you
in like a week, right?

569
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:22,500
l don't know.

570
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,600
Bye.

571
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,134
Bye, William.

572
01:02:30,065 --> 01:02:31,332
See you!

573
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:32,833
He's totally gay,

574
01:02:52,766 --> 01:02:53,733
H i.

575
01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:54,483
Hi.

576
01:02:55,432 --> 01:02:56,900
l need
to pick up the money

577
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,435
you got
from the girls.

578
01:02:59,435 --> 01:03:02,201
Oh. Did you talk to Victor?

579
01:03:02,201 --> 01:03:04,533
Um, no, I will.

580
01:03:04,533 --> 01:03:06,734
Don't you trust me?

581
01:03:06,734 --> 01:03:09,401
Yeah, it's just
that l thought--

582
01:03:09,401 --> 01:03:12,202
Oh, well, yes, usually
Victor gets it but

583
01:03:12,202 --> 01:03:15,301
l was nearby so l
thought l would come.

584
01:03:17,132 --> 01:03:17,966
Okay,

585
01:03:25,632 --> 01:03:29,068
l like Victor.

586
01:03:29,068 --> 01:03:31,167
l do, too.
He's a nice man.

587
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:31,832
ls he?

588
01:03:33,799 --> 01:03:36,434
Well, who knows?

589
01:03:36,434 --> 01:03:39,501
Maybe not by your standards.
l think he's nice enough.

590
01:03:39,501 --> 01:03:41,501
What are my standards?

591
01:03:47,499 --> 01:03:49,100
l know he's having
a hard time, you know

592
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,600
his wife is pretty sick.

593
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,434
l didn't know that.

594
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:57,801
Yeah, she is.

595
01:04:06,566 --> 01:04:08,567
Where's the kimono?

596
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:25,966
Here.

597
01:04:36,299 --> 01:04:38,167
This for me?

598
01:04:45,432 --> 01:04:47,801
Can l try it on?

599
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:51,167
Sure.

600
01:05:50,499 --> 01:05:53,068
Can l lie down?

601
01:05:53,068 --> 01:05:54,766
M m-hm.

602
01:09:00,099 --> 01:09:04,436
So you stole a wallet
and threw it away?

603
01:09:04,436 --> 01:09:05,900
Yeah.

604
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,802
And that's how he--

605
01:09:12,966 --> 01:09:15,234
What are you doing?

606
01:09:19,165 --> 01:09:21,400
What are you doing?

607
01:09:23,265 --> 01:09:26,134
l know why l do
what l do.

608
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:33,001
You ought to stop,

609
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:35,000
Whatever you're doing,

610
01:09:44,265 --> 01:09:46,166
Maybe l will.

611
01:09:52,566 --> 01:09:54,801
You really ought to.

612
01:09:58,232 --> 01:10:01,001
What about you?

613
01:10:01,001 --> 01:10:03,600
Maybe we'll stop together,

614
01:10:05,566 --> 01:10:07,000
Yeah.

615
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:14,001
Stranger things
have happened.

616
01:10:40,466 --> 01:10:41,466
Yes.

617
01:10:43,132 --> 01:10:45,901
Yes, you will?

618
01:10:50,566 --> 01:10:52,334
Yes, l will.

619
01:10:53,799 --> 01:10:55,700
Okay.

620
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,167
l guess.

621
01:11:00,766 --> 01:11:03,168
There's the address.
It's this guy.

622
01:11:07,599 --> 01:11:09,434
You nervous?

623
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:30,666
Yeah?

624
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,367
l'm here to pick
something up for Victor.

625
01:11:32,367 --> 01:11:33,766
l don't know any Victor,

626
01:11:33,766 --> 01:11:35,935
Yeah, you do. l'm just
here to pick it up.

627
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,768
Pick what up?

628
01:11:37,768 --> 01:11:40,068
You know. Don't you have something
that doesn't belong to you?

629
01:11:40,068 --> 01:11:41,533
Who are you?

630
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,066
What's Victor's
boss's name?

631
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,032
What?

632
01:11:45,032 --> 01:11:46,433
You know Victor, right?

633
01:11:46,433 --> 01:11:47,333
Yeah.

634
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:48,099
You know his boss?

635
01:11:48,099 --> 01:11:48,965
Yeah.

636
01:11:48,965 --> 01:11:50,166
What's his name?

637
01:11:50,166 --> 01:11:52,200
Who are you again?

638
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,599
What's the boss's name?

639
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,601
l have no idea.

640
01:11:55,601 --> 01:11:57,100
You know Ann?

641
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:58,350
Yeah.

642
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:03,069
You're such
a piece of shit.

643
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:06,502
l really need
to ask you to leave.

644
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:08,601
l'm only gonna ask
one more time.

645
01:12:08,601 --> 01:12:10,534
Leave, asshole.

646
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:12,000
What's the boss's name?

647
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,499
Get the fuck
outta here,

648
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:16,232
Okay.

649
01:12:16,232 --> 01:12:17,099
Oh!

650
01:12:20,566 --> 01:12:21,533
fuck!

651
01:12:21,533 --> 01:12:22,283
Ah.

652
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,001
My boss wants
to see you.

653
01:14:28,733 --> 01:14:30,768
All right. Let's
go see him.

654
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:09,034
Victor, will you
give us a moment?

655
01:15:09,034 --> 01:15:10,467
Sure.

656
01:15:18,165 --> 01:15:22,936
That was quite a display you put
on at Russell's apartment yesterday.

657
01:15:28,432 --> 01:15:30,667
Do you think
it was necessary?

658
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:38,801
Did you enjoy it?

659
01:15:40,599 --> 01:15:41,349
No.

660
01:15:44,733 --> 01:15:46,468
No? Not even
a little bit?

661
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:08,834
Are you a sadist?

662
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:12,234
l'm sorry?

663
01:16:13,165 --> 01:16:15,433
A sadist.

664
01:16:15,433 --> 01:16:16,967
Are you sadistic?

665
01:16:19,232 --> 01:16:21,934
No. Are you?

666
01:16:21,934 --> 01:16:24,736
A little respect, please,

667
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,435
75,OOO dollars.

668
01:16:53,435 --> 01:16:56,635
lt's quite a bit more than
the occasion calls for, but--

669
01:16:58,899 --> 01:17:01,101
l consider that
a lot of money.

670
01:17:01,101 --> 01:17:03,000
l guess
you do, too.

671
01:17:06,632 --> 01:17:08,233
What's it for?

672
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:14,002
lt's to thank you for the
work that you'll do for me.

673
01:17:18,966 --> 01:17:21,001
Do you have
to think about it?

674
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,669
Because it might be
a problem if you do,

675
01:17:30,232 --> 01:17:32,867
No, it's good.

676
01:17:32,867 --> 01:17:34,100
Good,

677
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:35,399
Come,

678
01:17:38,466 --> 01:17:39,767
Okay.

679
01:17:43,332 --> 01:17:45,734
Victor will be in touch
at some point.

680
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:51,167
You like Victor,
right?

681
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,499
Yeah.

682
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,937
Also, you won't be doing any
more pickups or deliveries to Ann.

683
01:18:00,933 --> 01:18:02,834
Okay.

684
01:18:02,834 --> 01:18:04,133
ls that a problem?

685
01:18:05,933 --> 01:18:07,234
No.

686
01:18:07,234 --> 01:18:08,484
Good,

687
01:18:11,165 --> 01:18:15,002
Because l don't want you and Ann
to ever see each other again.

688
01:18:15,002 --> 01:18:17,100
lf you're wondering why
there's so much money in there

689
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:19,100
it's to thank you
for doing what l say.

690
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:24,567
Don't ever try
and see her again.

691
01:18:28,299 --> 01:18:30,334
lsn't that partly
up to her?

692
01:18:31,599 --> 01:18:33,734
lt's what she wants,

693
01:18:35,499 --> 01:18:36,900
lt is?

694
01:18:40,099 --> 01:18:42,935
More importantly,
it is what l want.

695
01:18:45,332 --> 01:18:46,052
l see.

696
01:18:47,332 --> 01:18:48,966
You do?

697
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:52,501
Yeah, l do.

698
01:19:36,432 --> 01:19:37,833
Sorry.

699
01:19:57,566 --> 01:20:00,035
Because light travels in waves

700
01:20:00,035 --> 01:20:02,734
with specific wavelengths

701
01:20:02,734 --> 01:20:07,236
with specific wavelengths, , ,

702
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:11,770
Objects become visible when they
are large enough to reflect light.

703
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:15,836
, , , uses an oil-immersion lens to
achieve a magnification of 1 , OOO

704
01:20:24,632 --> 01:20:29,103
, , , immersion lens to achieve
a magnification of 1, OOO, , ,

705
01:25:27,899 --> 01:25:29,200
Ugh!

706
01:25:43,499 --> 01:25:45,100
Get outta here.

707
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:47,167
Okay.

708
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:52,034
Do you have money?

709
01:25:52,034 --> 01:25:53,400
Yeah.

710
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,167
Okay, well,
then go.

711
01:25:55,167 --> 01:25:56,833
Go, right now.

712
01:25:58,899 --> 01:26:00,400
Come with me.

713
01:26:02,799 --> 01:26:04,233
No, William,

714
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:06,666
No.

715
01:28:46,165 --> 01:28:48,100
You remember William?

716
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,434
He's back,

717
01:29:04,566 --> 01:29:08,036
That episode was
back then, but

718
01:29:08,036 --> 01:29:12,102
like l said,
he's back, and

719
01:29:12,102 --> 01:29:14,400
well, you know,
he's probably

720
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,960
he's probably

721
01:29:19,165 --> 01:29:21,500
tried to get
in touch with you.

722
01:29:24,632 --> 01:29:25,833
Between us?

723
01:29:25,833 --> 01:29:27,567
Of course.

724
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:32,834
He wrote me a letter.

725
01:29:35,566 --> 01:29:36,566
And?

726
