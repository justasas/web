(William, off)
Dear Ann,
l've come back to New York,

15
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:37,768
Some years ago you
asked me about myself,

16
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,734
''What are you doing,''
you asked

17
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:43,702
l didn't answer then
but l want to now,

18
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:47,069
When you've read this letter,
if you wanna come away
with me

19
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:49,834
if you want me to take you
from here, tell Victor

20
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:53,636
you can trust him,
_e'll find me,

21
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,768
I'll start somewhere
near the beginning,

22
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,569
William is not my name.

23
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:06,700
A few years before l met you

24
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:09,735
l was returning from a place
l'd always wanted to visit,

25
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:15,070
Japan, l was transferring
in San francisco
to a flight home,

26
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:18,735
Once l was back on the plane
l asked if l could go back
to the boarding area

27
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:20,700
because I had left
a book there.

28
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:24,736
By the time l found my book,
the gate had closed

29
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:29,570
so l sat and read my book
until the plane took off
without me,

30
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:32,668
l decided to take the long
bus ride across the country
to my home

31
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:35,902
in Connecticut,
just outside of New York,

32
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,535
Several hours into the trip

33
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:44,404
l heard on the radio
that the plane l missed
had crashed into a mountain,

34
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:49,237
l closed my eyes and slept,

35
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:54,237
The next day l learned
that they had not been
able to recover any bodies,

36
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:59,237
The plane and all
the passengers had been
incinerated on impact,

37
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:10,337
l got off the bus
in New York and decided
to stay for a while,

38
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,335
[melancholy music]

39
00:06:16,065 --> 00:06:18,534
l realized that
for all anyone knew

40
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,768
l no longer existed,

41
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,034

42
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,767
without really
thinkin9 about it

43
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,167
l bought a passport

44
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:37,168
under the name
of William Vincent,

45
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,168
I took a c]ass
and learned a trade

46
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:50,135
and got a job
editing nature videos
for use in the schools.

47
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:56,269
I think that's
what they're used for,
I'm not really sure.

48
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,767
l managed to find
an empty storefront

in Chinatown not far
from the East River.

00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:03,067
They can fly backwards
and are the only group
of birds

60
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:06,401
able to do so,

61
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:09,068
They can also
stop in midair.

62
00:08:09,132 --> 00:08:13,936
Hummingbirds are continuously
hours away from starving
to death

63
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,202
and are able to store
just enough energy

to survive overnight,

65
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:23,669
Hummingbirds are capable
of slowing down their
metabolism at night

66
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:29,071
or any other time food
is not readily available,

67
00:08:29,132 --> 00:08:31,200
They enter
a hibernation-like state

68
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:33,600
known as torpor,

69
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:37,169
During torpor, the heart rate
and rate of breathing

70
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:39,767
are both slowed dramatically

71
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:44,671
the heart rate to roughly
5O to 1 8O beats per minute

72
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,135
reducing the need for food,

73
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:52,101
The most astonishing
quality of hummingbirds

74
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,901
is their ability
to broadcast color.

75
00:08:54,966 --> 00:09:00,171
Hummin9birds radiate
like hot coals in the sun,

76
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:03,602
The color
that reaches your eye
is created by pigment

77
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:07,403
which absorbs some
colors and rejects others,

78
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:09,668
Like soap bubbles

79
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:13,870

different places,

175
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:47,402
And l saw them
as l'd known them

176
00:18:47,466 --> 00:18:53,672
as young boys,
not as the adu]ts
they would be now,

177
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:58,304
lt was a lovely thing
to imagine, but I knew
it was just that, Imagined,

178
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:03,868
But l saw them as if
they were really there,

179
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:08,037
l wondered how they were,
where they were,

180
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:12,336
Anyway, wherever they are,
it's probably best that they
don't know me

181
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:14,834
given the man l've become,

182
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,434
[music continues]

183
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,734
l knew them
when l was this age

184

the age l am now
in this shot, 16.

185
00:19:32,966 --> 00:19:38,338
l'm 30 now, so the things
l remember are from
a long time ago.

186
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:42,703
His name was Joseph
back then, not William.

187
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:47,170
He did some odd things,
but l think he was
a nice person.

188
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:50,034
Maybe a little--

189
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:55,404
[music continues]

190
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:58,936
He could run very fast.

191
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,634
We used to race.

192
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,569
He was a beautiful runner.

193
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,335
Really beautiful runner.

194
00:20:27,232 --> 00:20:31,436
(William, off)
I'd been lvin9 as William
Vincent for three years
before l met you,

195
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:35,903
ln that time, we might have
passed near to one another
and not known it,

196
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:46,068
l wonder if either of us
might have felt something
in the passing,

197
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:47,466
lf it happened,

200
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,935
l wonder if you were nearby
that night l saw

201
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,602
that man wearing
suspenders and a bow tie?

202
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:12,935
He's ]ust kind of
drifting down the sidewalk

What the fuck?

205
00:21:22,632 --> 00:21:25,668

206

some things from his pocket,

]ust a receipt and
a business card, Nothing,

208
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:45,734
But it seemed as if there was
something else in the air
that night.

209
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,767
Something odd,

210
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:54,068
lt was an unusually
quiet, empty ni9ht.

211
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:57,101
But l felt as if something
had happened,

212
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,768
There was something wrong
that night but I didn't mind.

even liked it,

that there was somewhere

00:54:21,265 --> 00:54:23,734
every week,
that look okay?

534
00:54:26,165 --> 00:54:28,667
lt'd be okay if l
needed the money.

535
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,834
Then give it back.

536
00:54:34,499 --> 00:54:36,500
There's a lot in here,
isn't there?

537
00:54:36,566 --> 00:54:38,334
l think so,

538
00:54:38,399 --> 00:54:40,267
All right.

539
00:54:40,332 --> 00:54:43,168
Maybe l can find
a use for it.

540
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,400
So, Ann

541
00:54:47,666 --> 00:54:49,334

542
00:54:49,399 --> 00:54:51,000
She's a beautiful woman,

543
00:54:51,065 --> 00:54:52,599
Yeah, so
what's the deal?

544
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:54,667
Pretty much
as you see it,

545
00:54:54,733 --> 00:54:58,103
Care to elaborate?

546
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:03,400
You seem like
a nice boy.

547
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:09,505
This is not
a really nice group.

548
00:55:09,566 --> 00:55:13,069
And, uh, you're
inc]uded in this 9roup?

00:55:13,132 --> 00:55:15,067
Yeah, me, too.

550
00:55:15,132 --> 00:55:16,500

554

555
00:55:33,632 --> 00:55:36,034
uh, she's, uh

556

uh

557
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:43,503
she's my boss's--

558
00:55:45,165 --> 00:55:47,534
She owes him.
l suppose we all do.

559
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,069
Anyway, she's, uh

560
00:55:51,132 --> 00:55:52,766
she's there for him
when he need, when
he needs her

for himse]f
anymore

562
00:55:54,966 --> 00:55:57,535

563
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:58,733
Mm-hm.

564
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,834
So, uh, anyway, uh

565
00:56:01,966 --> 00:56:03,500
she was asking

566
00:56:03,566 --> 00:56:07,002
about you

567
00:56:07,065 --> 00:56:11,569
uh, asking me, uh

568
00:56:11,632 --> 00:56:14,067
she knows she's not
supposed to ask about you

569
00:56:14,132 --> 00:56:16,167
that's none
of my business
why she did.

570
00:56:16,232 --> 00:56:19,868
But you need to know
that this is very
dangerous for her.

And for you,

No, _ don't

There anything l can
do for you, Victor?

00:57:05,933 --> 00:57:07,401
No.
