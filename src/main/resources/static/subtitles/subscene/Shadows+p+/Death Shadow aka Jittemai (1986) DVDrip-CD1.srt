Record of Criminal Cases

18
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,626
Otomatsu, a servant at the Ise-ya
store in Shinbaba-mae, Shiba.

19
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:53,940
Injured the store owner in an attempted
murder out of personal grudges.

20
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:55,305
Sentenced to death.

21
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:01,777
Kanpachi, a servant at the
Nabeshima Clan's Edo Mansion.

22
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:06,378
Robbed a house and committed murder.

23
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,180
Sentenced to death.

24
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,991
Yasuke, an assistant officer in Atago.

25
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:17,463
Knowingly aiding criminals and
extorted portions of their loot.

26
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,896
Sentenced to death.

27
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:44,279
You all have returned straight from hell.

28
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:49,962
It takes nothing to send you right back.

29
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:56,625
If you wish to live again and serve
society, take these truncheons.

30
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:02,839
If you do, they'll save your lives.

31
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,815
Listen - as clear as a bell,
this is your one last chance.

32
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,682
You only have two choices now:

33
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:19,359
To fall into hell again or
join the shadow police.

34
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:22,624
Two choices only. Which will you choose?

35
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,034
All right.

36
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,477
As of this moment, you're
human but not individuals.

37
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:51,716
You're the shadow police that'll vanquish
great evil from behind the scenes.

38
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:57,925
From now on, you have nothing
to do with the outside world.

39
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:05,334
I've got your voices in my hand now.

40
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,010
20 years later

41
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,022
Boss, look out! It's the shadow police!

42
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,347
Boss! Boss!

43
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,803
Damn you!

44
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:05,412
You... you're my daughter.

45
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,955
What a surprise.

46
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,424
We knew from our investigation
that major merchants...

47
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,794
like Hizen-ya and Mine-ya are associated
with that shadow organization.

48
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:18,531
But this is Limori Kansa, Advisor in
Edo of the 1000 koku Hinoki Clan.

49
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:23,436
There are also daimyo Tachibana
Sakyo-no-suke and Horiuchi Juroza'emon.

50
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:25,738
They won't be quiet about it.

51
00:08:25,773 --> 00:08:29,141
They're the ones that'll be in
trouble if this case is exposed.

52
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,201
They're in cahoots with Denzo the Fang...

53
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,903
a major criminal who controls
appointed money exchangers...

54
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,350
for the Shogunate behind the scenes...

55
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:40,615
and schemed to make great profits
by disrupting the rice market.

56
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,049
Gonza the Badger.

57
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,552
Koda Denroku.

58
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,359
Matsu the Snake Neck.

59
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,571
That bastard was keeping a low
profile for a while since he broke jail.

60
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:01,507
I don't care about the small guys.
What's the story with Denzo?

61
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,771
Yes, well...

62
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,939
Yasuke the Viper - it's unlike him.

63
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:19,584
Please understand how I truly feel.

64
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,228
I want to talk with you.

65
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,568
What's that look on your face?

66
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:30,870
You run into your daughter for
the first time in 10 years...

67
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,805
and she's a member of
Denzo the Fang's gang.

68
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,737
Does that bother you so much?

69
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,814
You look exactly like your mom.

70
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,485
After all these years, you
want to rehash the past?

71
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,646
Well, just listen.

72
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,419
It was 20 years ago.

73
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,386
My vocal chords were cut and I lost
my voice in exchange for my life.

74
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,489
I became a shadow cop talking
only through sign language.

75
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:06,038
I was after a guy named Aioi
Kisaburo suspected to be...

76
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:09,201
the chief of all prostitution boat owners.

77
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,980
The bastard was the second
son of a 1000 koku daimyo...

78
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:16,540
untouchable by the town police.

79
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:21,287
I knew O'Saki was Kisaburo's lover...

80
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:25,018
but I had no idea how young she was.

81
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,530
I fell in love.

82
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:39,398
Frankly, I didn't care
about Kisaburo any longer.

83
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:47,977
I asked her not to sleep with
other men and be my girl only.

84
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,750
She wasn't doing it because
she wanted money.

85
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:07,356
My earnest plea moved her and
she told me where Kisaburo hid.

86
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:38,426
Looking back, it's laughable how a
shadow cop like me could act like that.

87
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:43,499
But I was simply ecstatic to
be with your mom O'Saki.

88
00:11:49,608 --> 00:12:00,951
Time flies, and I completely
forgot that I was a shadow cop.

89
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:08,351
They told me Aioi Kisaburo brilliantly
escaped from the exile island.

90
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,264
He killed three guards.

91
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,294
It appears one of his men aided him.

92
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:21,496
He disappeared on a boat the man
rowed into the dark on a stormy night.

93
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:29,675
You know what he looks like
more than anybody else.

94
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:36,183
I got information they're hanging out
in the vicinity of Joshu. Go there.

95
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,589
I've got a wife and kid.

96
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,797
Their happiness is my priority.

97
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,894
Please understand.

98
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:58,265
For 10 years, I let you have a good dream.

99
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,946
Please understand.

100
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:04,575
Do you still want to
continue living an easy life?

101
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,197
Are you gonna come back to us?

102
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:22,566
Tell me you'll be back
someday. Promise me you will.

103
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,871
It's over. It's all over.

104
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:34,205
Our marriage is over.

105
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,607
My tie with our girl is over.

106
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,983
The happiest time of my life is over too.

107
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,151
Darling!

108
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,340
Darling...

109
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,880
I wish I could show you...

110
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:17,182
how mom lived after you abandoned us.

111
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,026
But don't worry.

112
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:24,325
She didn't suffer too long.

113
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:29,333
She died in less than a year.

114
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:34,231
I trained hard to become a killer.

115
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:42,478
I promised myself I'd avenge her death
by killing you by my own hands someday.

116
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:49,855
A young little girl managed to survive
with the hope of that one promise.

117
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,291
I'm sorry, O'Cho. Please get out of here.

118
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:56,990
You've gotta be kiddin'.
You're letting me go?

119
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,431
You abandoned me like a cat or a dog...

120
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,834
and this is the best you can do for me now?

121
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:03,836
I'm not gonna listen to you.

122
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:07,740
I want you to be happy.
Please leave here.

123
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:15,146
Listen, though I grew in the mud
I'm as pure as a lotus flower.

124
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,342
I've managed to lean on
my own shoulder so far.

125
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,216
I beg you, please leave.

126
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:30,127
We suffered... both mom and I.

127
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:35,233
I won't let you... I won't let you...

128
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,002
What's this?

129
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,977
Please understand.

130
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:28,418
Don't ask me any questions.

131
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,585
Just abandon me.

132
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,163
Please let me go.

133
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:39,926
Viper.

134
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,397
What happened?

135
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:48,369
You let Denzo the Fang escape, but
I suspect there's something else.

136
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:53,302
You know what'll happen
to you when you quit.

137
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,411
Death is the rule.

138
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:15,430
Yasuke, you want to end your life so much
that you're willing to abandon them?

139
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,529
I don't want to know what
happened in your personal life.

140
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,497
But remember you're a shadow cop.

141
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,543
Human yet not a person.

142
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,083
Turn your heart into a rock, Yasuke.

143
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:33,984
Finish off Denzo the Fang and his gang.

144
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,449
There's a major criminal hiding behind him.

145
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,016
Your cleaning job hasn't even started.

146
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,778
Ms. O'Cho, give him just a
moment. Right now, the boss is...

147
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,716
Ms. O'Cho.

148
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,557
What's that look on your face?

149
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,675
Stop it, already.

150
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,650
What on earth is going on here?

151
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:17,316
Are you letting back in the
sneaky thief you once kicked out?

152
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:21,815
She may be a thief but I
forgive her when she's back.

153
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:26,664
Especially when she brings with
her a special piece of information.

154
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,260
Information?
- Yeah.

155
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:35,801
I heard you're the only
daughter of Yasuke the Viper.

156
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,076
When I think about it...

157
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:43,782
it was a total mystery how on earth
the shadow cops learned about...

158
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:45,918
our meeting that day.

159
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:48,320
No way, I'd never betray you.

160
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,311
Don't make me laugh!

161
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,648
I was waiting for you, dad.

162
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:27,483
Oops, hold it, don't be impatient.

163
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,916
If you want your daughter to live...

164
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:39,325
listen, Viper, back then I was the
one who got a surprise attack...

165
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,764
but from now on, I've got a better hand.

166
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,633
I saw it with my own eyes.

167
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:57,239
You were negotiating with
her behind closed doors.

168
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:08,285
Come on, I want you to give up
those powerful black truncheons.

169
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,519
Drop them!

170
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,816
What do you think, Viper?

171
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,082
I came up with this trick.

172
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,786
Do you like it?

173
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:47,087
Your dear daughter is next.

174
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,335
Please save her.

175
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,402
She didn't betray you.

176
00:22:56,341 --> 00:23:01,480
Torture me instead. You can
do anything you want to me.

177
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:04,716
What the heck is that? I have
no idea what you're saying.

178
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,617
Are they hand movements
in a dance or something?

179
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,692
Just save O'Cho.

180
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,752
All right, all right. No need to worry.

181
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,198
I'll kill you both, father and daughter. Right?

182
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:24,259
Look how helpless Yasuke the Viper is now.

183
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:32,576
All right, drag her down.

184
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,441
Dad...

185
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,740
Forgive me, dad.

186
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,120
From the bottom of my heart...

187
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,368
I ask for your forgiveness.

188
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:11,675
Forgive me, O'Cho, forgive me.

189
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:18,845
Dad...

190
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,545
Dad...

191
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,694
Forgive me.

192
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:40,666
Forgive me, dad.

193
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,040
Dad...

194
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,778
Forgive me, dad.

195
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,687
Come and see this everyone...

196
00:25:55,722 --> 00:26:00,725
This is O'Cho the Flower Storm,
the lover of Denzo the Fang who...

197
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,931
as the boss of the underworld, kept
the great city of Edo in turmoil.

198
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:09,501
Truly, truly it's this woman.

199
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,004
Look at her well and look at her again.

200
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,006
She's bound for execution.

201
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,474
She'll be tied to a stake,
decapitated in public...

202
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,210
then her head will be on public display.

203
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:23,874
This is her journey to hell!

204
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,643
I don't wanna die!

205
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,521
Spare me!

206
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:39,129
I don't wanna die!

207
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:46,797
Spare me! Spare me!

208
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,076
How distasteful of her
to struggle at this point.

209
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,177
Stab her!

210
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:49,691
The woman named O'Cho the Flower
Storm was executed today as scheduled.

211
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,099
This truncheon is his memento.

212
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:57,838
You'll now carry on as a
shadow cop in Yasuke's place.

213
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:03,913
It's just as I killed my dad.

214
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:10,320
So why do you want me to do this?

215
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,125
Dad let a rotten child like me get away.

216
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,357
He warned me to leave Denzo.

217
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:24,936
Had I only listened to him,
he wouldn't have had to die.

218
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:28,907
But I... I...

219
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:32,365
He must've died full of regret.

220
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:38,483
He wasn't after a small
time criminal like Denzo...

221
00:28:38,518 --> 00:28:47,482
but a high rank official in the
Shogunate that's behind it all.

222
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,728
He's such a major figure that even...

223
00:28:49,763 --> 00:28:52,663
the Magistrate or Chief of
Justice can't touch him.

224
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:57,130
Unless they've got
concrete evidence, that is.

225
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,974
What do you say, O'Cho?

226
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,843
If you don't want to be a
shadow cop, that's fine.

227
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,509
But don't you want to finish
the job Yasuke started?

228
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:16,285
You'll understand what he went through.

229
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:20,513
You'll understand the pain of a man who...

230
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,858
gave up his wife and daughter
and lived his life as a shadow cop.

231
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:37,573
The same dark blood of
Yasuke runs in your body.

232
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:45,472
It's not easy to wipe the stain off.

233
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,317
Pick it up.

234
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,458
Pick it up.

235
00:29:56,194 --> 00:30:01,496
That's the only way...

236
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:07,062
only way left for you to
console your dad's spirit.

237
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:22,847
Now, let me tell you what plan I have for you.

238
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:30,128
The merchant Kano-ya Genshiro was once a
member of the 65,000 koku Hamada Clan.

239
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:31,729
He was an intelligent samurai who served...

240
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:34,994
as a counselor to chief of the
clan, named Mukai Genshiro.

241
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,226
The chief of the clan, Matsudaira
Suo-no-kami Yasutomo...

242
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:42,273
used a trivial mistake Genshiro
made as an excuse to outcast him...

243
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:46,505
and declared he no longer had
anything to do with the clan.

244
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,680
But in fact...

245
00:30:48,715 --> 00:30:52,116
Suo-no-kami forged a trade license called
the inspection exemption license...

246
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:53,852
and gave it to Genshiro.

247
00:30:53,887 --> 00:30:58,089
He ordered Genshiro to take on the
front of a trade merchant and...

248
00:30:58,124 --> 00:31:01,693
engage in the crime of smuggling and
support the clan's finance unofficially.

249
00:31:01,728 --> 00:31:03,285
That's right.

250
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:07,696
Sir Matsudaira Suo-no-kami is
the shogun's blood relation.

251
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,469
Four years ago, he ran up the promotional
ladder to join the Shogunate...

252
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:14,461
and in a blink of an eye became
Chief of Senior Advisors.

253
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,366
He's now the shogun of darkness.

254
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:24,108
With the enormous amount of
money earned through smuggling...

255
00:31:24,515 --> 00:31:28,152
he ordered the appointed money
exchangers in Kuramae to buy up the rice...

256
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:31,849
in an attempt to turn the
rice market upside down.

257
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:36,157
O'Cho, you know well
about the scheme yourself.

258
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:39,620
Denzo the Fang worked for him.

259
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,235
The shogun of darkness
has no match in power.

260
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:49,195
There's only one thing that'll cause his fall...

261
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,974
a piece of concrete evidence.

262
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:58,906
We need to obtain the
inspection exemption license.

263
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,345
Do you understand, O'Cho?

264
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:08,724
There's no way to achieve
this by playing it straight.

265
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:14,898
A shadow cop's check mate, a
move Yasuke didn't get to make.

266
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:22,906
That's what you must accomplish.

267
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:29,411
Don't forget it, O'Cho,
your life is in my hands.

268
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,098
Mourning

269
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:22,733
Oh, the lady is dressed in
quite gorgeous clothes.

270
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:27,303
I'm certain she'll go
straight to heaven in peace.

271
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:35,509
Yes. Though she was our maid, we
loved her like our own daughter.

272
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:40,508
We were discussing her
marriage arrangements when...

273
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:43,317
a sudden illness fell upon her.

274
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:50,261
We felt so much for her that we wanted
to treat her in the best way we could.

275
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:56,667
So, we put on her the kimono and obi
I brought with me when I got married.

276
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,269
I see.

277
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:02,974
Well, well, it's quite a generous gesture.

278
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:07,604
I'll be sure to pray for her most thoroughly.

279
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,421
Idiot!

280
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:53,558
Did you give them the obi
and the obi fastener too?

281
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:56,594
Yes, she had no family.

282
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:58,529
I wanted to do for her the best
I could upon her departure.

283
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:02,795
I know I was on the road,
but without my consent...

284
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:07,305
What is it? Why so upset?

285
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,372
What is it about the kimono?

286
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,340
I don't care about the kimono.

287
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,676
It's the obi fastener.

288
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:13,578
In the fastener there was...

289
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:16,547
Get Sakichi here. Sakichi!

290
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,548
Yes.

291
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,917
You were right there and... how could you...

292
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,820
Idiot! Call a palanquin.

293
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:24,288
Yes.

294
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:25,156
Dismissed.

295
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:27,925
My dear, tell me what's going on.

296
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,260
Let go of me.

297
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:32,230
Before you interrogate me, be
ashamed of your own blunder.

298
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:34,164
Dear?

299
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,524
Dear!

300
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,671
Now, gentlemen...

301
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:43,307
They're silk embroideries.

302
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,410
The obi and its fastener are
woven with gold threads.

303
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:49,113
The lining is in crimson.

304
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,916
I'll have to set a higher price for this set.

305
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:53,217
3 ryo.
- 4 ryo.

306
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,785
5 ryo.
- 6 ryo.

307
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,521
Any more bids?

308
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:57,852
10 ryo.

309
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,003
Out of the way!
- What's wrong?

310
00:36:12,038 --> 00:36:16,874
The gold-threaded obi and the
fastener that the dead girl wore...

311
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:18,364
Where is it?

312
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:19,844
Did someone buy it?

313
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:21,679
Yes, it was quite high quality.

314
00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:25,115
Who did you sell it to? Tell me who bought it!

315
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,916
Hello.

316
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,021
Where are the silk
embroidered kimono and...

317
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:32,323
the gold-threaded obi and the fastener
that you bought from the priest?

318
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,559
Well, sorry, those items are...

319
00:36:34,594 --> 00:36:36,789
We sure did purchase them but...

320
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,763
How much are they? Well,
the price doesn't matter.

321
00:36:38,798 --> 00:36:41,599
I want to buy them back.
Twice the price? Three times?

322
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:43,034
Tell me how much you're
selling them for. Tell me.

323
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:46,237
Those items have already been...

324
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:48,005
Sold?
- Yes.

325
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,342
A singing teacher named
O'Chika in Hakusanshita...

326
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:54,312
had been asking for quality
material for a long time...

327
00:36:54,347 --> 00:36:56,280
Sir? Sir!

328
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:01,152
Hey... come on.

329
00:37:01,187 --> 00:37:05,223
Oh, don't woo me so persistently.

330
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:06,824
It makes me feel guilty.

331
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:09,418
I want you to be clear this is nothing serious.

332
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,466
Oh, you're so cold.

333
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:28,007
But that's what I hate and love about you.

334
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:31,315
Stop it now.

335
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:36,020
I'm not desperate enough to have
to play along an older lady's game.

336
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:37,749
What did you say?

337
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:44,583
I'm sick to the head from
the stink of your powder.

338
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,959
Don't you have the nerve.

339
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:53,036
What's that look?

340
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:57,475
You aren't so naïve that it
surprises you to hear it.

341
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,443
You're right.

342
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:07,543
I like it when you act bad like this.

343
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,354
I really like it.

344
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,618
You're suffocating me.

345
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:14,025
Let me kill you, okay?

346
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,826
I'm suffocating.

347
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,521
I'm gonna kill you.

348
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:24,133
I'll kill you, and then kill myself.

349
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:29,572
C'mon, I want you to kill me.

350
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,106
Let me die. Okay?

351
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,843
Hello.

352
00:39:05,878 --> 00:39:08,846
Sorry to call on you so late,
but I have urgent business.

353
00:39:08,881 --> 00:39:10,507
Please open up.

354
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:17,288
Sorry to call on you so late
but I have urgent business.

355
00:39:17,323 --> 00:39:18,846
Please open up.

356
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:57,689
Ms. O'Chika. Ms. O'Chika?
I have urgent business.

357
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,223
Ms. O'Chika?

358
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:08,535
I'm not a criminal. I have
a favor to ask of you.

359
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,232
Please open up. Ms. O'Chika.

360
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,997
Someone help! Somebody!

361
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,368
Master, madam has... madam has...

362
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,951
Hanae...

363
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,829
Hanae!

364
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,100
What on earth happened?

365
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:29,269
After you left, she locked
herself up in her room.

366
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,040
We kept asking how she was
and there was no answer.

367
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:39,610
We got worried and looked in the
room, and found her this way.

368
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,261
Why did you, Sanosuke?

369
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:58,026
I'm not blind.

370
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:03,202
Why did you - no, need to kill her?

371
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,835
It's your own fault.

372
00:44:06,243 --> 00:44:07,540
My fault?

373
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:12,547
You can't panic like that in front of
others, or eventually they might...

374
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,854
She... she didn't know anything.

375
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,253
Not yet.

376
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:20,721
But if she were alive...

377
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:24,791
She wouldn't have let up asking
you what it was that she did wrong.

378
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,921
And I know you'd have told her one day.

379
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,030
Sanosuke!
- Don't lose it, Genshiro.

380
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:40,572
We must take out any seed of trouble.

381
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,680
Completely.

382
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:45,945
It's all for the clan, for the survival
of the 65,000 koku Hamada Clan.

383
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:50,147
Wasn't that our mission?

384
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,658
Can't we get the obi fastener back?

385
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,937
It was a mistake.

386
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:13,533
It was a clever idea to hide it in the
fastener, but it wasn't well thought out.

387
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:19,008
If you'd just told me about it, you
wouldn't have lost your beloved wife.

388
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:26,722
Now that Denzo the Fang has been killed,
the police must be closing in on us.

389
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:29,953
If we leave things be...
- I know.

390
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:36,288
I promise to recover the
exemption license myself.

391
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:43,832
What time was it approximately
when you saw the man?

392
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,142
It was later than 11:30.

393
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,751
That's strange.
- What is?

394
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,483
Look.

395
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,984
It's not leaving an impression.

396
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:06,196
If she was killed later than 11:30...

397
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:08,499
pressing against her skin like this
would leave the spot discolored.

398
00:46:08,534 --> 00:46:10,267
Which means she had died much earlier.

399
00:46:10,302 --> 00:46:12,064
That's right.

400
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,500
But how could one kill
a sexy woman like this?

401
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,743
What a waste.

402
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,318
Damn you.

403
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:12,990
Sis... Sis, please forgive me.

404
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:15,993
Sis...

405
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:26,910
Sis, that woman was so persistent
I didn't know what to do. Sis...

406
00:47:26,945 --> 00:47:29,435
I don't care what happened.

407
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:34,413
I wanted the obi fastener you
strangled her little neck with.

408
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:42,324
There was an incredible treasure beyond
your imagination buried inside it.

409
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,790
That's enough.

410
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:51,565
There's no use torturing
a little guy like him now.

411
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:56,206
The fastener is in the
Hacchobori Police's possession.

412
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:57,407
But, sir, that's no excuse to...

413
00:47:57,442 --> 00:47:58,840
Hold on.

414
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:05,906
Genshiro is the only person who knows
what's inside the fastener besides us.

415
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,378
It's not too late.

416
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:18,227
We must take it back, no matter who
has it, and by all means necessary.

417
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:31,364
Hey, madam!

418
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,002
It's the Hacchobori Police.

419
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:37,371
I was told this is the House of Tricks.

420
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,079
Will you come out?

421
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,847
Is anybody home?

422
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:02,634
Are you the one they call O'Ren the Thistle?

423
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:09,479
I know you're a cop, but you can't invite
yourself into someone's private home.

424
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:11,310
Whoa.

425
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:15,252
Hidden behind the front of
a male prostitute house...

426
00:49:15,287 --> 00:49:18,085
you run an illegal business as a tattooist.

427
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:23,181
I think I'm giving you plenty of slack here.

428
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,231
Hand over the brat named Sentaro to me.

429
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:29,755
Sentaro?

430
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,374
I know what happened.

431
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,780
A singing teacher named O'Chika,
who was murdered last night...

432
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:47,944
used to meet Sentaro here
to fool around with him.

433
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:53,156
Murdered? Do you mean to say Sentaro did it?

434
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:54,453
Yeah.

435
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,092
He strangled her with this.

436
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,227
What a waste.

437
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,261
She was a sexy woman.

438
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,474
Hand him over.

439
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:12,976
I'm short tempered.

440
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:17,811
Listen, it was a big mistake for him
to commit a crime in Hacchobori.

441
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:21,918
If you try to protect him in
anyway, you'll get it too.

442
00:50:21,953 --> 00:50:24,654
I'm not protecting him.

443
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:28,784
He hasn't been around lately.

444
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:32,520
Is that right. Okay.

445
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:37,428
By the way, since you don't seem
to know, let me tell you something.

446
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:42,798
They call me Hell in this neighborhood.

447
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:51,372
Let me know if you find out where
Sentaro is. Sorry to have bothered you.

448
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:06,082
Don't just hide there and come out.

449
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,893
Sir...

450
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,362
I have a favor to ask of you.

451
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,028
A favor?

452
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,214
Oh, your wife's memento?

453
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:32,782
Yes.

454
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:36,820
It was something she'd always
cherished since we got married.

455
00:52:36,855 --> 00:52:39,923
Then, while I was away in Osaka...

456
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,857
my servants didn't know.

457
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,556
Is that so?

458
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,995
I didn't know it was a
post-funeral recycle item.

459
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:56,972
Anyway, how did you find
out it was in my possession?

460
00:52:57,307 --> 00:53:03,303
Yes, I asked the second-hand clothing
merchant who bought it. That's how.

461
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:12,055
Your story could bring
tears to someone's eyes.

462
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,623
I beg you please.

463
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:17,992
If money helps, I'm willing
to pay you any price.

464
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:20,491
Money?

465
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:23,255
Money?

466
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,401
Money sounds good.

467
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:34,302
I love it, I love it!

468
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:45,954
But you see, something's been
bothering me for quite a while.

469
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:51,390
After the singing teacher
in heat got strangled...

470
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:56,555
someone tried to take this
piece off her dead body.

471
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:12,209
Well, I'm not saying it's you.

472
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:17,684
But the maid who saw it told
me what the guy looked like...

473
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,783
and you seem to fit the description.

474
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:31,466
It looks like this piece has some
hidden value I'm not even aware of.

475
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,861
I wouldn't mind selling it to you...

476
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:37,629
but first I wanna find out what the
value is before I name the price.

477
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,839
Sir...
- Don't worry.

478
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,413
It's an important piece of
evidence of a murder case.

479
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:46,007
I'll wear it right next to my skin until then.

480
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,647
It looks like a shower.

481
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,314
I guess I'll borrow an umbrella somewhere.

482
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,959
Don't draw it!

483
00:54:55,994 --> 00:54:57,927
I've got eyes on my back too!

484
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:04,064
You're a samurai, aren't you?

485
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:11,733
How dare you damage my best jacket.

486
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,133
Don't play me!

487
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,879
Sir!

488
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:08,380
Sir!

489
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:26,303
I'd call it a draw due to an injury.
